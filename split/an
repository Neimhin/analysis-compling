14137	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	2	" I thank the Vice Chairman and committee members for allowing us to flag amendments which will be dealt with on Report Stage. As requested by members, my officials have brought copies of the ODCE's guide to directors' duties and powers. This document is available free of charge in both hard copy and on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, website. As I mentioned yesterday, the officials from my Department will arrange another briefing session for committee members prior to Report Stage to ensure that members are fully briefed on these proposed amendments. In this context, I wish to remind members about the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, which will be progressing through the Houses in the coming weeks. This Bill will contain provisions that are considered to be too urgent to wait for the completion of the ""Big Bill"". This Bill amends the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in relation to the jurisdiction of the courts in examinerships. It provides that companies that are deemed to be small companies by virtue of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 may make their application to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court. It also contains provisions concerning the making of annual returns for subsidiary undertakings. It facilitates the reporting of offences under the companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and his or her officers. It authorises IAASA to collect a levy or levies from statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public interest entities. Finally the Bill makes provision for the Minister to provide regulations in relation to third country auditors and audit entities, who carry out audits of the annual or group accounts of a company falling within certain EU regulations. As the ""small"" Bill has not yet been enacted, it is not possible to give a more precise detail of its final version, although obviously the members of the committee will contribute to it when it comes before them in the next few weeks. As the goal of the Companies Bill 2012 is to consolidate all existing law, it is intended that the ""small"" Bill will be subsumed into it, ideally by way of Report Stage amendments. I would also like to note that I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and also to ensure that the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is applied consistently throughout the Bill."

(9) A licence that— (a) had been granted by the Minister pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of the original section 24 to a private company limited by shares (being a company that has reregistered as a DAC pursuant to Chapter 6 of Part 2); and (b) is in force immediately before the commencement of this section, shall continue to have effect but with the modification that it shall operate to exempt the company from the use of the words “designated activity company” or “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” as part of its name and the publishing of its name. (10) Subsections (4) to (7) of the original section 24 shall continue in force in relation to the foregoing licence as if that section 24 had never been repealed, except that references in those subsections to the Minister, wherever occurring, shall be read as references to the Registrar. (11) An exemption that immediately before the repeal of the Act of 2001 operated, by virtue of the substituted section 24, in favour of a private company limited by shares (being a company that has re-registered as a DAC pursuant to Chapter 6 of Part 2) shall continue to have effect but— (a) with the modification that it shall operate to exempt the company from the use of the words “designated activity company” or “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” as part of its name and the publishing of its name; and (b) subject to subsection (12). (12) Subsections (4) to (7) shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to a foregoing exemption as they apply to an exemption under subsection (1). (13) In relation to a DAC that avails itself of the exemption under subsection (1), or continues to avail itself of a licence or exemption referred to in subsection (9) or (11), section 152 shall have effect as if, in addition to the particulars specified in subsection (2)(a) to (c) of that section to be included on all business letters and order forms of the DAC, there were specified in that subsection the fact of the DAC being a limited company. (14) In this section “Act of 2001” means the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.”.

As matters stand, under the Bill all companies which have, on or after March 2002, availed of the exemption, pursuant to section 24(1) of the Companies Act 1963 as substituted by section 88 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, from including ""limited"" in the name will have to reapply to the Companies Registration Office to obtain an exemption from including ""DAC"", designated activity company, in their name. This amendment is necessary as it will reduce the burden on such companies and they will not be required to claim the exemption a second time, a procedure which would result in filing fees and administrative overheads.

14143	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	15	 I move amendment No. 112: In page 778, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following: “Status of existing guarantee company, having a share capital 982. (1) This section— (a) makes provision as to the status of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital; and (b) continues in force the memorandum and articles of such a company. (2) In this section— “existing guarantee company, having a share capital” means a private company limited by guarantee, having a share capital, which— (a) was incorporated under any former enactment relating to companies (within the meaning of section 5); and (b) is in existence immediately before the commencement of this section; “mandatory provision” means a provision of any of Parts 1 to 14 (as applied by this Part) or of this Part that is not an optional provision; “optional provision” means a provision of any of Parts 1 to 14 (as applied by this Part) or of this Part that— (a) contains a statement to the effect, or is governed by provision elsewhere to the effect, that the provision applies save to the extent that the constitution provides otherwise or unless the constitution states otherwise; or (b) is otherwise of such import. (3) An existing guarantee company, having a share capital shall, on and from the commencement of this section, continue in existence and be deemed to be a DAC limited by guarantee to which this Part applies. (4) Section 983 contains provisions— (a) for enabling such a company to continue to use, for a limited period, “limited” or “teoranta” in its name despite the foregoing status that it has assumed; and (b) deeming the name of such a company, after a specified period and in default of its having changed its name in that fashion, to be altered by the replacement of— (i) “designated activity company” for “limited” at the end thereof; or (ii) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” for “teoranta” at the end thereof, as the case may be. (5) Reference, express or implied, in this Act to the date of registration of a company mentioned in a preceding subsection shall be read as a reference to the date on which the company was registered under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1862, the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 or the prior Companies Acts, as the case may be. (6) The memorandum and articles of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital shall— (a) save to the extent that they are inconsistent with a mandatory provision; and (b) in the case of the memorandum, subject to section 983(6), continue in force but may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which memorandums or articles, whenever registered, are permitted by this Act to be altered or added to. (7) References in the provisions of a memorandum or articles so continued in force to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act. (8) To the extent that an existing guarantee company, having a share capital was, immediately before the commencement of this section, governed by— (a) the regulations of Table D in the First Schedule to the Act of 1963; or (b) the regulations of any Table referred to in section 3(9)(b), (c) or (d) of the Act of 1963, it shall, after that commencement, continue to be governed by those regulations but— (i) this is save to the extent that those regulations are inconsistent with a mandatory provision; (ii) those regulations may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which articles, whenever registered, are permitted by this Act to be altered or added to; and (iii) references in the regulations to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act.”. I am trying to get into my own stride here. Effectively we are proposing to introduce a new amendment to chapter 3 of Part 16. The amendment provides that existing private limited guaranteed companies having share capital will convert to DACs limited by guarantee following the commencement of the relevant provisions. I am considering introducing an amendment to section 982 on Report Stage to clarify the position of DACs in respect of the prohibition on listing securities on regulated markets under volume 1.

(1) In this section— “existing guarantee company, having a share capital” has the same meaning as it has in section 982; “new provisions” means the provisions of this Part (and the relevant provisions of Part 2 as applied by this Part) relating to the use of either of the required sets of words (or their abbreviations) set out in subsection (2); “transition period” means the period of 18 months beginning after the commencement of this section. (2) For the purposes of this section, each of the following is a required set of words— (a) “designated activity company”; (b) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe”. (3) The reference— (a) in the preceding definition of “new provisions”; and (b) in subsection (4), to provisions relating to the use of any words includes a reference to provisions conferring an exemption from the use of those words. (4) During— (a) the transition period; or (b) if before the expiry of that period the company has changed its name to include either of the required sets of words, the period preceding the making of that change, the provisions of the prior Companies Acts relating to the use of limited or teoranta (or their abbreviations) shall apply as respects the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital in place of the new provisions. (5) On and from— (a) the expiry of the transition period; or (b) the company changing its name to include either of the required sets of words, whichever happens first, the new provisions shall apply as respects the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital. (6) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (5), on the expiry of the transition period (and the company has not changed its name before then to include either of the required sets of words), the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital, as set out in its memorandum, shall be deemed to be altered by the replacement of—-- (a) “designated activity company” for “limited” at the end thereof; or (b) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” for “teoranta” at the end thereof, as the case may be. (7) Where the name, as set out in its memorandum, of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital is altered by virtue of subsection (6), the Registrar shall issue to the company a fresh certificate of incorporation in respect of it, being a certificate of incorporation that is altered to meet the circumstances of the case.”.

There are review clauses inherent in the legislation so that the company law review group can be involved. It is a statutory body and has a mandate to monitor, review and advise the Minister about existing company law and to make recommendations about its implementation and the introduction of new legislation. I do not think that necessarily answers the Deputy's question, but aside from the criminal activities, there are specific ways of punishing dishonest or irresponsible directors of insolvent companies and of protecting the public from further wrongdoing by such persons, namely by restricting or disqualifying directors. There are specific and robust proposals in regard to criminal sanctions, the jurisdiction of the courts, the role and responsibilities of the directors or persons involved in a company. Some of this is updating pre-existing law and consolidating it. I do not know if that answers Deputy Conaghan's query.
14186	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	83	 I move amendment No. 131: In page 926, lines 19 and 20, to delete all words from and including “(1) Sections” in line 19 down to and including “members.” in line 20 and substitute the following: “(1) Without prejudice to subsections (4) to (6) (which contain transitional provisions),sections 348 and 349 shall not apply to a CLG if it satisfies the following conditions: (a) it has been formed for charitable purposes; and (b) it stands exempted from those sections by an order made by the relevant authority (which order the relevant authority is, by virtue of this section, empowered to make), and the exemption provided by that order may, as the relevant authority considers appropriate, be either for an indefinite or a limited period.”. Subsection (1) has been replaced to ensure the public guarantee companies may avail of the exemption in circumstances where such company is not trading for gain. This amendment effectively ensures continuity with current law. Amendment No. 132 is a technical amendment.
14187	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	84	 I move amendment No. 132: In page 927, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following: “(4) Sections 348 and 349 shall not apply to an existing guarantee company that, immediately before the commencement of this section, stood exempted from the requirements of section 128 of the Act of 1963 by virtue of subsection (4)(c) or (5) of that section, but this is subject to subsections (5) and (6).”.
14188	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	85	 I move amendment No. 133: In page 927, lines 11 and 12, to delete “subsection (4) of this section shall cease to apply to that company” and substitute “, thereupon, sections 348 and 349 shall apply to that company”.
14189	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	87	 I move amendment No. 134: In page 927, lines 20 and 21, to delete “Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland” and substitute “relevant authority”. The reference to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests has been replaced by a reference to the relevant authority. Together with amendments Nos. 135 and 136 this allows for the transfer of the operations of the commissioners to the new charities regulatory authority.
14190	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	88	 I move amendment No. 135: In page 927, to delete lines 26 to 30 and substitute the following: “then the relevant authority shall, by virtue of those circumstances, be empowered to declare in writing that sections 348 and 349 shall, on and from a date specified in the declaration, apply to that company and, where the relevant authority so declares,sections 348 and 349 shall apply to that company on and from the date so specified.”.

14192	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	90	 I move amendment No. 137: In page 931, line 17, column 1, after “State” to insert “and prohibition of certain activities”. This is a technical amendment to correspond with the amendment to section 18, which seeks to give further clarification to the existing law.
14193	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	91	 I move amendment No. 138: In page 931, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following: “ Certain particulars to be shown on all business letters Section 152(2) to (4) ”.
14194	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	93	 I move amendment No. 139: In page 931, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following: “ Majority written resolutions Section 195 Supplemental provisions in relation to section 195 Section 196 ”. Amendment No. 139 proposes to supply the requirements of sections 195 and 196 of the Bill relating to majority written resolutions in the supplemental provisions for unlimited companies. A similar amendment applies to public unlimited companies, with the share capital and public unlimited companies without a share capital.
14195	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	94	 I move amendment No. 140: In page 931, line 44, column 1, after “State” to insert “and prohibition of certain activities”. This is a technical amendment to correspond with the amendment to section 18, which seeks to give further clarification to the existing law.
14196	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	95	 I move amendment No. 141: In page 932, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following: “ Certain particulars to be shown on all business letters Section 152(2) to (4) ”. This is a technical amendment. I propose to further amend section 1224 to disapply the requirement to show the name and legal form of the company, its place of registration, registered number and the address of its registered office and letters, order forms and websites of public unlimited companies with a share capital.
14197	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	96	 I move amendment No. 142: In page 932, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following: “ Majority written resolutions Section 195 Supplemental provisions in relation to section 195 Section 196 ”.
14198	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	97	 I move amendment No. 143: In page 932, line 35, column 1 after “State” to insert “and prohibition of certain activities”.
14199	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	98	 I move amendment No. 144: In page 933, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following: “ Certain particulars to be shown on all business letters Section 152(2) to (4) ”.
14200	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	99	 I move amendment No. 145: In page 933, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “ Majority written resolutions Section 195 Supplemental provisions in relation to section 195 Section 196 ”.
14201	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	100	 I am considering introducing an amendment to section 1224 on Report Stage to disapply the obligation to file a return of allotment to ULCs as well as PLCs and make similar provision for unlimited companies, other than that which has been provided for public limited companies and companies limited by guarantee. The amendment will mean that the majority of written resolutions do not apply to any form of UC.
14202	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	101	 I am considering introducing an amendment to section 1225 on Report Stage to clarify that the European Communities cross-border merger regulations 2008 do not apply to unlimited companies.
14203	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	104	 Under section 216(9)(c), every company is obliged to allow any person to inspect its members' register on the payment of a fee, which must be €10 or less. Section 216(12)(c) obliges companies to send a copy of their members' registers to any person who requests it, again for a fee of €10 or less. This register contains the names and addresses of members and the number of shares held by each member. This also applies to unlimited companies. As there is currently no requirement to report this information to the Companies Registration Office, it would be costly to set up a register both for the Companies Registration Office and for the affected companies. The ongoing cost to the CRO and affected companies of making and processing thousands of notifications would also be significant. The costs involved in delays to transfer of ownership of shares would be unacceptably high and could interfere with constitutional rights to private property. The information is already publicly available on request and the cost of creating and maintaining such a public register would be considerable, so I am not in favour of this amendment.
14204	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	109	 There is no problem returning to this on Report Stage for further deliberations, but we must acknowledge that unlimited companies function within the Irish infrastructure, serving many legitimate business purposes. They are a feature of company law across the European Union. Issues have been raised with regard to transparency, and perhaps we can provide more clarity in that respect for the next Stage. Just as guaranteed and public limited companies are important for certain kinds of business, unlimited companies also serve an important purpose. I am not suggesting that anybody is necessarily seeking to remove them, but to do so would be a disproportionate act which could affect Ireland's competitive advantage. I do not know if it is possible to quantify the burden of cost but we can try to do some work on it between now and the next Stage of the Bill.
14205	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	112	 The issue mentioned by Deputy Wallace is due to be addressed in the coming months and I am sure the Deputy is aware that an accounting directive, 2013/34/EU, is to be introduced. It could be a more suitable way of addressing that issue. That is a potential resource for the committee. The matter could be addressed on Report Stage in order to provide greater clarity. The primary aim of this Bill is the consolidation of existing law and the provision of a user-friendly framework for businesses operating in Ireland. We must take into account the fundamental principle of the Bill. The issue that has been raised by a number of members could be addressed again on Report Stage.
14206	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	114	 That is a given.
14207	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	118	 I am considering the introduction of an amendment to section 1248 on Report Stage to provide more accurate cross-referencing and to include a cross-reference to sections 1084 to 1086.
14208	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	119	 Again, I am considering introducing an amendment to section 1251 on Report Stage to clarify that admission of new members to a plc is subject to the approval of the directors or as otherwise provided by the company's constitution.
14209	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	120	 I am considering introducing an amendment to section 1282 on Report Stage to correct an incorrect cross-reference.
14210	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	122	 I remind the committee that the section is substantially unchanged from existing law. It is drawn from section 9 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983.
14211	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	124	 The matter to which Deputy Calleary refers has been referred to the Company Law Review Group. It will be taken in that context.
14212	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	126	 Again, we are considering introducing an amendment to section 1293 on Report Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to make provision for the transposition of Article 1 of directive 2012/17/EU subsections (1) and (2) which concern the interconnectedness of registers between EEA states.
14213	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	127	" I move amendment No. 147: In page 975, line 30, to delete ""subsection (9)"" and substitute ""subsection (10)"". This is a technical amendment to resolve an inaccuracy in the Bill. It is proposed that this section shall not apply to a company that is a credit or financial institution."
14214	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	129	 It is proposed that this section shall not apply to a company that is a credit or financial institution.

14216	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	133	" On section 1318, the position is unchanged from existing law. Section 1327 is substantially unchanged from existing law. However, the definition of ""joint stock company"" is taken from existing law. Some of the wording in the existing definition has been modified slightly. With regard to section 1328, the position is substantially unchanged from existing law. Modification has taken place to account for the new company types under the Bill. As such, a joint company may at any time register as a CLS, DAC, CLG or unlimited company. With regard to sections 1329 to 1332, the position is substantially unchanged from the existing law."
14217	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	134	 I move amendment No. 148: In page 1007, line 8, after “to” to insert “in”. This section is new. It provides a saver for existing regulations made under section 46 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005. It expands upon paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 to the Bill, which provides that the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations, SI 324 of 2005, and any regulations amending those regulations will continue in force and may be amended or revoked accordingly.
14218	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	135	 This section is an artefact of the law of prospectuses as it stood before the prospectus directive and the markets in financial instruments directive, known as MiFID. An appropriate level of protection is achieved by these directives and various other aspects of EU law, and as a result this provision is redundant. We are proposing the deletion of the section.
14219	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	137	 By virtue of the directives under EU law.
14220	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	139	 If they are already incorporated into EU law, they are inherent. I have an open mind. They are already in the regulations. Sections 1338 to 1355, concerning public offers of securities, provide the statutory basis for regulations transposing the prospectus directive, 2003/71/EC. These provisions are taken from Part 5 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005. In essence, Part 23 speaks to the EU regulations governing the very section on which the Deputy has posed the question.
14221	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	142	 I am considering an amendment to section 1385 on Report Stage to correct the cross-reference in subsection 9.

The new wording will provide for the filing of financial statements without the filing of an annual return.
14223	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	145	" I move amendment No. 149: In page 1044, line 22, to delete “1 month” and substitute “30 days”. This amendment was discussed when dealing with section 404. The function is to improve clarity and precision. A simple reference to ""one month"" has the potential to cause confusion and inconsistency."
14224	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	146	 I move amendment No. 150: In page 1044, line 27, to delete “1 month” and substitute “30 days”.

14226	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	148	 I am considering introducing an amendment to this section on Report Stage to reference SI No. 333/2002 - European Communities (Corporate Insolvency) Regulations 2002.
14227	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	150	 I move amendment No. 151: In page 1056, line 1, after “takeover” to insert “or other relevant transaction”. These amendments are proposed in the interests of completeness to avoid legal uncertainty in the Irish Takeover Panel’s jurisdiction to regulate schemes, the purpose of which is to consolidate control.
14228	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	151	 I move amendment No. 152: In page 1056, line 4, after “takeover” to insert “or other relevant transaction”.

(1) Section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003 shall not apply in relation to this Act. (2) The text of this Act shall be made available electronically in each of the official languages as soon as practicable after its enactment.”. This new section will disapply section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003 to avoid an undesirable delay in the publishing of the new Companies Bill once enacted in paper form until it is translated into Irish and available in both official languages. Given the size of the Bill, there is likely to be a substantial delay if section 7 of the Official Languages Act is not disapplied.
14231	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	157	 The point was well made by Deputy Dara Calleary. This Bill will be translated into Irish as per the Official Languages Act 2003. However, we have to be practical and pragmatic. We know there are not enough translators within the system to deal with both Irish and European Union parliamentary business. The Bill will be published in Irish at some stage. We uphold the rights of those whose first language is Irish to have equal access to this legislation. They will have equal access to this Bill in their native tongue. However, we must be practical and apply a common-sense approach to how we deal with this issue. I ask the Deputy to give us some leeway.
14232	SeanSherlock	Labour	14945.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	162	 I move amendment No. 155: In page 1059, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following: “ S.I. No. 137 of 1987 European Communities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) Regulations 1987 The whole Statutory Instrument ”. The purpose of the amendment is to repeal the 1987 mergers regulations. Its omission from the table of revocations was an error.

I acknowledge the forbearance of the committee about the introduction of new amendments on Report Stage and thank them for that. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is scheduled to meet a group from the committee next week on the issue of the accountancy matter.

14343	SeanSherlock	Labour	14974.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-05 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013: Committee Stage	5	 I will explain the reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment. I understand Deputy Calleary, in his contribution on Second Stage, indicated that the Minister should consider a simplified version of the independent accountant's report and the application papers for the appointment of an examiner to streamline the application process. The current court process mirrors the requirements of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in respect of the appointment of an examiner. Section 3 of that Act requires that a petition for the appointment of an examiner be accompanied by a report prepared by an independent accountant. Section 3(3)(b) sets out the areas the report is required to cover. The Bill does not propose to change these arrangements because the report of the independent accountant is essential to assist the court in determining whether the company has a reasonable prospect of survival. If the court is not satisfied that the company as a whole or any part of the undertaking has a reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern, it is precluded from making an order appointing an examiner. Thus, the independent accountant's report is a crucial piece of evidence for the court to consider. It should explain, in a reasoned manner, why the independent accountant is of the view that the company, and the whole or part of its undertaking, has a reasonable prospect of survival. The report must have regard to a number of important matters, as detailed in section 3(3)(b) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990. The appointment of an examiner to a company will interfere with the rights of creditors and it is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the independent accountant's report provides evidence that will satisfy the court that the company has a reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern and whether a compromise or scheme of arrangement with creditors would offer such a prospect of survival. Modifying the terms which underpin the report would create a significant risk that the rights of creditors and their businesses, which may also have employees, would be impacted further as the evidential threshold would be lower. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has also advised that allowing the Minister to alter the arrangements in question by way of a statutory instrument would not legally be permissible as it would exceed the extent to which matters can be delegated to a Minister, having regard to the Constitution.
14344	SeanSherlock	Labour	14974.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-05 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013: Committee Stage	8	 In respect of Deputy Calleary's amendments which have been ruled out of order, it is a matter of common sense and prudence for individuals or companies with an intention to procure goods or services to establish first the cost or the estimated cost of these. It would be particularly pertinent in the circumstances in question here. The reforms being carried out are being brought through the Legal Services Regulation Bill which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is sponsoring and which is currently before the House. These will provide for further disclosure of actual and potential costs to clients of any proceedings for which the legal practitioner is being engaged. That Bill is introducing a series of enhanced transparency measures on legal costs and is the appropriate vehicle for debate on the legal costs aspect of this. In broader terms, it would not seem appropriate that the responsible regulator for the professions involved would advertise the fees of individual practitioners. This would be open to all types of misinterpretation, including, perhaps, a quasi-endorsement of the fees concerned. Alternatively, it could lead to the fees so publicised becoming set minima which, in effect, could impede competition among the relevant service providers who would have an officially published price list to hide behind. There is an inherent danger there. If the real purpose is to police levels of fees charged by the professions in question, I would contend that it is not appropriate to include such a provision in a specific and target measure as that under consideration here.

In response to an amendment proposed by Senator Barrett on Report Stage in the Seanad, I agreed to make an amendment to provide for what he was proposing. This relates to a provision that the regulations which the Minister is proposed to be empowered to make under section 8(2) will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In dealing with this proposed amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad, I proposed that, in incorporating the present measure into the Companies Bill 2012, the requisite amendment would be included as an amendment in that Bill. It has since transpired that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel can facilitate the drafting of this amendment in time for the Report Stage in this House and I am pleased to be able to confirm that I will be bringing forward this amendment at Report Stage of this Bill in this House.

14354	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	67	 The Government remains committed to the vision of using research and innovation to generate jobs and growth.  That is the fundamental philosophy underscoring our efforts in this area.  The 2014 science and technology programme budgets have been maintained at the 2013 levels, which will support this goal.  Within the constraints of our economic circumstances, we are maximising the funding available for research, development and innovation and, critically, seeking to maximise the impact of this investment on jobs and the economy.  Evidence from both the EU and internationally shows that the Government's strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our science, technology and innovation investment is paying off. We are first in Europe for jobs created in research and development and tenth out of 142 countries under the global innovation index for 2013.  Ireland is in 13th position for university-industry collaboration on research and development.  We are in the top 20 in global international scientific rankings, first in molecular genetics, second in probiotics, third in immunology, sixth in nanotechnology, eighth in material science and tenth in computer science.  We are ranked third in the EU on the new indicator of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, thereby making Europe more competitive and helping to create jobs. The provisional figures indicate that the target to support 100 high-potential start-up businesses in 2013 has been exceeded.  These businesses have committed to creating a total of 2,100 new jobs and will generate annual sales of €300 million by 2015.  The seven new Science Foundation Ireland research centres established in 2013 will directly support 800 jobs and are a key attractant for foreign direct investment.  In 2013, Science Foundation Ireland had links to 65% of the 3,085 jobs announced by IDA Ireland in the fields covered by SFI's legal remit.  We will continue the implementation of research prioritisation as well as a range of other initiatives to deliver on our strategy, ensure a more targeted investment of science, technology and innovation, and further enhance the effectiveness and impact of our research investment, with the aim of sustaining and creating jobs across the sectors to which I referred. This year, Science Foundation Ireland will establish two to three new large-scale research centres, which will support between 200 and 300 jobs in sectors of national strategic importance, such as medical devices, software, diagnostics, telecommunications, smart grids, and sustainable food production and processing.  SFI will also fund 3,000 researchers and more than 20 world-class research centres in 2014.  These are a key magnet for foreign direct investment and will help to ensure Ireland becomes one of the most attractive locations in Europe and globally in this regard. Enterprise Ireland will support 95 high-potential start-up businesses in 2014 which, as I said, will yield 2,100 jobs across a range of sectors.  We are also working hard on driving greater industrial and academic collaboration.  Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to promote and drive effective collaboration between the two.  The main driving force for this is the translational impact from research into economic activity. Does the Vice Chairman wish me to address the individual subheads?
14355	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	69	 If I understood the question correctly, it related to the various programmes that exist across the institutes of technology, through Enterprise Ireland and so on.  There is significant potential under Horizon 2020.  The negotiations on the €80 billion package were concluded during the Irish Presidency, an effort to which the team that is behind me today was integral.  Through Enterprise Ireland we have set up a national support network which will includes most of the State funders of research, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Health Research Board, Irish Research Council, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  What we have here is a set of national contact points which will liaise with the institutes of technology and with individual entities within the universities.  These are the go-to contacts for industry and academics. We are targeting an increase in regard to the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are engaged with programmes like Horizon 2020.  We have raised the bar up to 20% engagement in terms of a drawdown of funding.  The funding target is some €1.25 billion, which should present significant opportunities for the SME sector.
14356	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	74	 We have put in place a technology transfer strengthening initiative, TTSI programme, which is funded through Enterprise Ireland, and there are technology transfer offices within the individual organisations.  The national intellectual property protocol deals with how industry engages with academia in terms of collaborations and how it mines that intellectual property.  There should not, therefore, be any ambiguity for anybody who wants to talk to an institute of technology or university in regard to mining those types of opportunities. There are clear protocols in that regard. The major challenge, which Deputy Lawlor touched on, relates to how we encourage those in the SME sector, particularly those who own small and, quite possibly, intergenerational businesses, to engage with the institutes of technology in the context of innovation partnerships or innovation vouchers. There may be a job of work to be done in the context of improving the profile of innovation vouchers among small businesses, particularly in the context of their value. The LEOs may be the means by which that could be done. I do not wish to be parochial but I am aware of the intimate workings of the system in Cork and I know there is quite an advanced, if informal, network in place which allows businesses to interact with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT. However, I am not sure whether this is replicated throughout the country and there may be a need for work to also be done in this regard. The net point is that larger corporations will have relationships through the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres and the technology gateway centres. The relationship in this regard is quite formalised and deep. We want to encourage the participation of more businesses which would not have interacted on this level. Such businesses could, for example, be operating in the light engineering sector and could be intergenerational in nature. Those involved with firms of this nature may be extremely intelligent people who may not have gone through the formal system of third level education, but they are still running great businesses and they possess major skill sets. These individuals may not be thinking about growing their operations in a particular way or about moving in a direction which will facilitate new innovations. There is an opportunity for Ireland to improve its position in the context of this sector. We must ensure there is a greater knowledge among people with regard to the potential of innovation vouchers. There are those who may argue about whether the level of take-up in respect of the innovation partnerships has been sufficiently high. The position with regard to take-up may relate to people aiming for the top end, maximum amount of €250,000 rather than for the minimum amount of €50,000. The latter amount could, of course, have as much of an impact as the former in the context of the industry or SME academic partnerships which are driven by Enterprise Ireland.

I have with me the Technology Centre Expo 2013 booklet, which acts as a very good guide to the technology centres that exist within the institutes of technology, for example. Those centres are natural gateways for industries involved in a range of sectors, from the production of food right through to medical devices, to come on board. The key point is that the system relating to more well-established or technology-driven companies is quite advanced. What we are concerned with here is trying to get those who operate small or medium-sized businesses to start considering how they might obtain access to the information that is available. As stated, it costs nothing to get involved in a conversation. It could be argued that the walls are impenetrable. However, I am of the view that those walls are being broken down quite quickly. The Deputy would be surprised by the number of people who attended the launch of Horizon 2020. I met a man from my region who is a painter and decorator by trade and who was present at that launch to examine a business opportunity. There is a new confidence among people but we need to do more to drive business forward.

If a voucher is not working in a way that suits a particular company that is trying to drive innovation and if it is agreed, in principle, that there is scope for new innovation, then one would argue that Enterprise Ireland's suite of supports should be bought to bear in respect of that company in any event. I accept the point and it is important that Enterprise Ireland should analyse the output relating to innovation vouchers. That is certainly something which can be done.
14359	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	80	 Yes, but one could argue that we do not necessarily want the institutes of technology or the universities to see this as a revenue stream.
14360	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	85	 Is the Deputy referring to Horizon 2020?
14361	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	87	 The Government, through Science Foundation Ireland, has effectively done a deal with industry whereby it will provide €100 million in funding and the taxpayer will provide €200 million to facilitate the roll-out of research centres. The work at one of those centres specifically relates to marine renewable energy. This will be a world-class research facility.
14362	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	89	 We are also involved in the European Commission's Atlantic strategy, which was launched by Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and the Taoiseach.  This strategy relates to evaluating the Atlantic's potential in the context of renewable energy and would involve countries collaborating with each other. I take the point that has been made. There are knowledge and innovation communities and various themes that have been negotiated through Horizon 2020, in particular one in which we had a specific interest that related to food and that will be rolled out soon. Countries will have to collaborate with each other along those themes anyway. In respect of Horizon 2020, those research centres will be rolled out with the idea of leveraging greater funding from the EU because of their size. By creating those economies of scale and forcing more academic institutions to collaborate with each other along thematic lines, large entities are being created that will be able to leverage opportunities from Horizon 2020 from an €80 billion fund along those themes to which the Deputy referred. In view of the two jurisdictions, we are working very closely with Northern Ireland and InterTrade Ireland to enable those concerned pitch for that kind of funding as well. There are opportunities there. I would like to know to whom the Deputy spoke.
14363	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	91	 The system in Ireland is based on academic institutions.  There are other models like the Fraunhofer model in Germany which act as stand-alone entities.  We have the Tyndall National Institute but it is aligned to an academic institution.  I am not sure how to answer the Deputy's question other than to say that if a company is innovative and arguably has a relationship with a State agency, the chances are that if it is going to look for funding, it will already have a relationship with one of the State agencies and will find its way to one of the Enterprise Ireland or national contact points to seek those opportunities to draw down funding as per the SME targets about which I spoke earlier.  The company will already be alive to those opportunities so we do not think there is any need to change the model in that sense.
14364	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	93	 We are a small country.
14365	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	95	 What is the Deputy suggesting?  I do not understand what she is suggesting.
14366	SeanSherlock	Labour	15021.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2014	97	 If one looks at Food Health Ireland, one will see there is an alignment to a number of academic institutions.  The reason why it works here is because we have cross-collaboration between different academic institutions.  There can be more than one academic institution mapped on to a theme, which is normally the case.  If one looks at Teagasc in Moorpark or Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre in University College Cork, one can see that a number of State entities and a number of different and competing industrial partners are involved in that.  There is a mechanism to allow them to share knowledge, which is arguably a better model because it results in greater economic activity for Ireland at the end of the day.  Most companies will already have research arms with their parent companies.  The model we have in Ireland is one of Government collaborating with industry and it works.

Section 2 of the Act of 2003 is amended— (a) in subsection (1A), by inserting the following paragraph after paragraph (a): “(aa) the foreign national being employed outside the State by a foreign employer and being required by the foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, a person in the State who is connected to the foreign employer,”, (b) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (2B): “(2C) A person shall not permit a foreign national who is employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, that person where that person is connected to the foreign employer, except in accordance with an employment permit granted by the Minister under section 8 of the Employment Permits Act 2006 that is in force.”, (c) in subsection (3)— (i) by substituting “, (2) or (2C)” for “or (2)”, and (ii) in paragraph (b), by substituting “(2) or (2C)” for “(2)”, (d) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3): “(3A) It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (3) consisting of a contravention of subsection (1) to show that he or she took all such steps as were reasonably open to him or her to ensure compliance with subsection (1).”, (e) in subsection (4), by substituting “subsection (2) or (2C)” for “subsection (2)”, (f) by inserting the following subsections after subsection (10A): “(10B) Without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, this section does not apply to— (a) a foreign national who is in the State pursuant to the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, and (b) the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has certified in writing that the foreign national referred to in paragraph (a) falls within a reciprocal arrangement that permits a foreign national who is a member of the family of an assigned person, forming part of his or her household, to be in employment in the State. (10C) A foreign national referred to in subsection (10B) shall be entitled to be in employment in the State without an employment permit for the duration of the assignment to official duties in the State of the assigned person concerned. (10D) In subsections (10B) and (10C)— ‘assigned person’ means a person who is assigned, by a government of another state, to carry out official duty in the State on behalf of the government of that other state; ‘reciprocal arrangement’ means an arrangement (whether in the form of a memorandum of understanding or otherwise) that is entered into by the Government with another state.”, and (g) by substituting the following subsection for subsection (15): “(15) In this section— ‘connected’ has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2006; ‘foreign employer’ has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2006; ‘place’ includes any dwelling or any building or part of a building.”.”. The amendment amends section 2(1A) of the 2003 Act by inserting a new paragraph (aa) and ensures the transfer of a foreign national in an intra-company transfer is clearly included in the general requirement to have an employment permit.  The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfers.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder’s employer is outside the State, that is, a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is, the Irish entity.  It is the Minister's intention that the provisions of the Bill relating to intra-company transfer employment permits respect the employer-employee contractual relationship between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference to the connected person that could suggest it was the employer has been removed and sections have been redrafted accordingly.  Many of the Committee Stage amendments are drafted to achieve this aim. The new subsection (b) provides that a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person shall not be permitted to do so except in accordance with an intra-company transfer employment permit and that to do otherwise is an offence. The new subsection (c) applies the offence provisions where a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person does not have the required intra-company transfer employment permit. The new subsection (d) will provide a defence to a foreign national working without an employment permit who can prove he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with section 2. This defence is already provided in the 2003 Act to an employer who employs someone without an employment permit. This provision addresses an issue raised by Mr. Justice Hogan in his 2012 ruling in the Younis case, which he referred to the Oireachtas and the Minister. Acceptance of amendment No. 4 will involve the deletion of section 3 of the published Bill. The new subparagraph (e) in section 3 of the Bill applies the defence provisions of section 2(4) of the 2003 Act to the new subsection 2C. Subsection 2C makes it an explicit requirement that a foreign national employed by a foreign employer who undertakes duties for, or training with, a connected person in the State has a valid employment permit. The effect of this is to provide a defence for those charged with an offence consisting of a contravention of the new subsection 2C. The new subparagraph (f) in subsection 3 of the Bill is required to address the variance which exists between existing employment permits legislation and the State's obligations under international agreements concerning the employment of dependants of State employees assigned on official duty overseas, often referred to as working spouse or working dependant agreements, particularly the treaty agreement in place between Ireland and the US. The amendment provides an exemption from the terms of the proposed Act for foreign nationals in the State under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 who are assigned to a mission in a country with which the Government has entered into a working dependant agreement. Under the terms of the working dependant agreement with the US and Canada, both of which predate the employment permits legislation, relevant dependants of officials assigned abroad are entitled to an authorisation to work in the other country. This system has been applied in full to Irish dependants overseas, but following the introduction of the Employment Permits Acts, applications by relevant embassies based here must be accompanied by a formal job offer, in contradiction of the terms of these international agreements. While our partners in the US and Canada implement the terms of working dependant agreements in full, our legislation as it stands means Ireland cannot fulfil its obligations to our partners. The US has noted on several occasions that Ireland's insistence on receipt of a formal job offer before issuing the employment permit is in breach of the agreement being implemented in full by the US. It is not expected that the amendment will lead to a substantial increase in non-Irish nationals seeking work under the terms of working dependant agreements. In addition, the exemption ends upon completion of the posting of the assigned person, usually a four-year duration. The new subsection (g) in section 3 of the Bill assigns the definitions of new terms used in the legislation, which fall out of the treatment of the intra-company transfer situation in the Bill. I am considering further minor amendments to section 3 of the Bill and will revert on Report Stage.

14389	SeanSherlock	Labour	15177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-26 00:00:00	Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014: Committee Stage	13	" I move amendment No. 5: In page 6, line 11, to delete ""following section"" and substitute ""following sections"". Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment and consequential to the insertion of two sections in the 2003 Act, section 2B in the published Bill and section 2C under amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 6 is a drafting amendment to the new section 2B inserted into the 2003 Act by section 4 of the Bill and ensures consistency with use of the term ""service"" in these provisions.  With regard to amendment No. 7, I have followed the Younis case closely and we all agree it was shocking.  We were shocked at the exploitation and injustice it highlighted.  The objective of the new section 2B is to further deter employers from employing foreign nationals without an employment permit by permitting the foreign national and the Minister to take civil action for compensation against the employer, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract.  This is in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer. Deputy Tóibín's amendment deals specifically with this.  Without necessarily speaking too much on the amendment until the Deputy proposes it, it would raise the bar in terms of what a foreign national or the Minister, in deciding whether to take a case on behalf of a foreign national under the new provision, has to prove before a court to get paid compensation.  I will leave it at that until Deputy Tóibín speaks on his amendment."
14390	SeanSherlock	Labour	15177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-26 00:00:00	Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014: Committee Stage	14	" I move amendment No. 6: In page 6, line 26, after ""employment"" where it firstly occurs to insert ""or service""."
14391	SeanSherlock	Labour	15177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-26 00:00:00	Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014: Committee Stage	20	" I propose to deal with the amendments numerically.  Deputy Tóibín’s amendment would place the onus on the foreign national of proving that exploitative work practices took place.  Currently, the foreign national does not have to prove that this occurred in order to avail of the provision.  Unscrupulous employers who employ illegal non-EEA nationals continue to face the possibility of prosecution under the employment permits legislation.  If found guilty of an offence, such employers face a fine of up to €250,000, imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.  An Garda Síochána and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.  On this basis, we will not accept amendment No. 7. Regarding amendment No. 8, the new civil proceedings provide for compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract of employment – this point is important - and the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rate for the job.  These are rates provided for in law and there is no ambiguity or complex standards of proof for a court in determining how much the compensation should be.  It is also how the Labour Court determined Mr. Younis's compensation.  The Deputy’s amendment would add complexity and ambiguity to a court's determination of what the rate for a ""regularised employee engaging in the same employment"" would be and could actually result in the applicant's claim failing if such a rate could not be established to the court's satisfaction.  On the other hand, the national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  It would be different if the contract of employment were legal, but in such a scenario it is not.  We will not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 9 provides for retrospective effect of the provision so that a person taking proceedings pursuant to the new section 2B of the 2003 Act can claim an amount of money for work done or services rendered during a period prior to, as well as after, the commencement of the section.  The new section is providing a remedy to a defined class of persons who have not been properly recompensed for work done or services rendered by reason of the illegality of their contracts of employment.  It covers those who never had permits and those whose permits lapsed through no fault of their own.  The employer has benefitted from the work done or services rendered.  If the employee had held an employment permit, the employer would have had to pay him or her at least the national minimum wage.  As a matter of social justice, the Minister wishes to provide a remedy to the class of persons referred to in section 2B. New subsections (6) to (9), inclusive, inserted into section 2B, impose limitations on the right of action conferred by section 2B and are proposed, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, for the purpose of making the section more likely to withstand challenge whether on constitutional or European Convention on Human Rights grounds.  The new subsection (10) inserted into section 2B provides that, where the Minister institutes proceedings under section 2B, the court may award costs in favour of the Minister.  We are considering some further amendments to these provisions and I will revert on this matter on Report Stage. Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, are drafting amendments falling out of amendment No. 9, which inserts new subsections (6) to (10), inclusive, into the new section 2B of the 2003 Act and relates to the bringing of an action against an employer.  Amendment No. 13 is a drafting amendment and falls out of the insertion of a new subsection (14) into new section 2B, which is addressed in amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 14 defines terms used in section 2B.  It also provides that proceedings taken against an employer under section 2B may be brought in the District Court for claims of up to €15,000 and in the Circuit Court for claims of up to €75,000. We consulted the Courts Service regarding amendment No. 15.  It has indicated that, in the cases provided for by this section, the only relevant interim relief would involve applying for an order preventing the employer dissipating or reducing his or her assets that might be required to meet the claim if the plaintiff were successful.  Such relief would already be available by way of injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  If by this amendment the Deputy is proposing that the plaintiff could apply for an advance of money that he or she might get in a settlement or court determination, the Courts Service has indicated that it is unaware of such relief being available where there is a dispute and pointed to the danger that allowing relief as proposed would pre-empt the outcome of the proceedings where the case remained to be determined.  Therefore, on grounds that it is unnecessary or possibly ill advised, I am not accepting the proposed amendment. The shoulder note for section 4 of the Bill as published must be amended to read: ""Insertion into Act of 2003 of new sections 2B and 2C""."

This is where NERA comes into the equation.  When a complaint is made, there is a robust investigation of potential exploitation with clear outcomes. On the compensation issue, the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rates of pay for the job.  We determined this when dealing with Deputy Tóibín's amendments.  This is provided for in law so that there is no ambiguity.  The complex standards of proof arise where a court is determining how much compensation should be paid.  It is necessary to remove that ambiguity.  In terms of the specific case mentioned, the question that arises is whether there is a legal contract of employment.  What we are doing is moving to a situation whereby a person who makes a complaint and has acted reasonably in terms of his or her employment conditions and had a reasonable expectation of having a contract will also be covered by this legislation.  We are putting a belt and braces approach around the existing legislation such that there is a comfort for anybody who finds themselves in an exploitative situation that they can come forward and make a complaint and that there is a corpus of law that does not put a prohibitive cost on them in so doing because there is a statutory body, namely, NERA, that exists to err on their side where exploitation occurs.

The distinction that must be made is that this applies where no legal contract exists.  I will try to clarify the matter.  It is not the intention of the civil proceedings to provide compensation based on the market or statutory rate for the job but rather to provide compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract.  The national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  If there are other statutory provisions that apply to certain rates for certain types of jobs, then there is no ambiguity.

If an employer provides an employee with a contract of employment, there is a rate for the job inherent in that contract.  We are providing for a situation in which no legal contract is provided and to allow in respect of an employee who has no legal contract and is exploited for him or her to be compensated on the basis of the national minimum wage or as provided by statute.

For the first time we are providing clarity for the courts where exploitation takes place and a judgment is made in a case in which there is no contract.  We are bolting to it, for want of a better term, a de minimis compensatory regime which will at least allow a person where there is a finding in his or her favour to receive compensation based on statutory provisions.  In previous court cases there was a lack of clarity.  I respectfully contend the amendment as proposed by Deputy Peadar Tóibín could provide for a case in which proceedings could be delayed or the burden of proof on the person being exploited or who could be potentially exploited could become completely unwieldy, as clarity could not be provided for.  The sections before us provide clarity and there is absolutely no ambiguity about the rate of compensation being provided for where there is no legal contract.  It is on that basis that we are not accepting amendment No. 8.

The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfer situations.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's employer is outside the State, that is a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is the Irish entity. The provisions of the Bill regarding to intra-company transfer employment permits must respect the employer-employee contractual relationship that exists between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference in the Bill to the connected person, that could suggest that it was the employer, have been removed and a number of sections redrafted accordingly. Amendment No. 16 defines the term ""connected"", which refers to the affiliation between a foreign and an Irish company for the purposes of granting an intra-company transfer employment permit.  The intention of the amendment is to tighten up and more clearly define the nature of the connections between the foreign employer and connected person, and consequently the definition of the terms ""holding company"" at amendment No. 21 and ""subsidiary"" at amendment No. 23 are required. Amendment No. 16 also defines ""civil partnership registration"" in terms of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term is used throughout the Bill in the context of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit.  Amendment No. 21 also defines the terms ""health insurance"", ""health insurer"" and ""medical treatment"" as these terms need to be defined in the context of the revised definition of remuneration at amendment No. 24, which I will address later. Amendments Nos. 17 and 20 further amend the definitions of connected person and foreign employer and are consequential to amendment No. 16.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential to amendment No. 23.  Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, are drafting amendments and are consequential.  Amendment No. 48 is a consequential technical amendment. Amendment No. 49 provides for sector-specific employment permits.  Amendment No. 50 provides for the duration of an employment permit in respect of an intra-company transfer to be set out on that permit.  Amendment No. 52 specifies the persons to whom copies of an employment permit should issue.  With regard to amendments Nos. 72 and 104, it is critical that the Minister is satisfied that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of board and-or accommodation for the duration of the permit holder's stay in the State. Amendments Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, are consequential technical amendments.  Amendment No. 103 brings the connected person and relevant person, that is, the person in the State with whom a contractor has entered into a contract of service, into the scope of the revocation provisions of section 16 of the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 107 is a technical amendment and is consequential to amendment No. 106. Amendment No. 108 is consequential to the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.

Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8). Please forgive me but I have omitted a few amendments.  Amendment No. 113 allows the connected person to apply for a review.  Amendment No. 114 is a consequential amendment following on from the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.  Amendment No. 118 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 119.  Amendment No. 156 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 157 which inserts a new subsection (3A).  Amendment No. 158 provides that the connected person who contravenes subsection (3A) is guilty of an offence. Amendment No. 159 requires the connected person to surrender the copy of the employment permit where the employment it concerns has been, for any reason, terminated by the foreign employer or the foreign national ceases to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, the connected person.  Also, failure by the connected person or the permit holder to do so is an offence under section 24(2), as amended by section 24(c) of the Bill.  The amendment guards against abuse of the permits system by ensuring that all parties are aware of the employment status of foreign nationals who are permit-required. Amendment No 161 requires the connected person to retain records pertaining to the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's duties or training programme and the employment concerned.  Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8), as amended by section 27 of the Bill.

In regard to amendment No. 49, providing for sector-specific employment permits would only be possible were the Department to waive all checks on the employer, which the Minister cannot accept.  Currently, all employers of permit holders are on the Department's database which is regularly checked by the National Employment Rights Authority as part of their compliance with the permits legislation.  Part of the evaluation of the employment permit application is to check the bona fides of the employer as well as establishing that there are actual labour shortages for the job to be filled.  Refusals arise where the employer is not deemed to be operating legitimately and where no such labour shortage is demonstrated. The Minister considers that the Deputy's amendment would make a targeted approach to meeting labour market skills shortages through the permit system impossible.  It would also significantly weaken the ability of the State to control and monitor employers of permit holders.  It is on that basis that we cannot accept the proposed amendments.  However, it must be said that we exercise discretion in humanitarian circumstances and where it is less than 12 months-----

It should be noted that this is a “may” provision  -  this allows the Department to consider such an application within the 12 month period where the Department has exception policies that have general effect - for example, humanitarian grounds where the employer has moved to a different location in the country.   Such exceptions to section 12(1)(e), when finalised, will be made publicly available.  However, in such an instance, the foreign national will have to apply for a new permit and will have to adhere to the conditions applying to that permit where applicable - in other words, where there is a labour market needs test.

Regardless of the political party from which we come or our political hue or political persuasion, as citizens, we all subscribe to the notion that the human rights and the employment conditions under which any worker works comply with the law and that he or she enjoys full entitlements inherent in any contract he or she has.

The Minister's preference is for all employment holders to be employed, salaried and paid under an Irish employment contract.  However, in the case of the intra-company transfer employment permit and contract for services employment permit, he acknowledges that the employment in the State is temporary and so facilitates the permit holder remaining on the foreign payroll.  However, this concession has, in practice, introduced a level of complexity to the evaluation of documentation submitted to support such applications.  This has resulted in considerable engagement with applications leading to delay and in some cases refusal. Amendment No. 24 provides for the insertion of a new section 1A into the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 25 provides the new definition of remuneration for the purposes of the employment permits Acts and fulfils two important functions. On the one hand, it offers a clear definition of what is meant by remuneration and how it is to be provided for all categories of employment permit. This provides clarity and certainty to employers. On the other hand, it introduces clear rules for those applying for intra-company transfer and contract for services employment permits, covering remuneration, duration of time with foreign employer, requirements to top up to Irish statutory minimum wages as well as €40,000 minimum remuneration threshold, before a permit will be issued. Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 set out the principles applying to the remuneration paid to the holders of intra-company transfer employment permits and contract for services employment permits. Amendment No. 73 makes it imperative that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of the permit holder’s stay in the State. Amendments Nos. 74 and 76 enable the Minister to refuse to grant an intra-company transfer employment permit or contract for services employment permit where he or she is satisfied that the health insurance provided is not similar to that provided by a registered health insurer in the State. Amendment No. 75 is consequential to amendment No. 74, while amendment No. 81 is consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 82 allows the Minister to refuse to grant an employment permit for an intra-company transfer or a contract for services where the conditions relating to remuneration and the provision of information on remuneration set out in the amendments to section 6 of the 2006 Act are not met. Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 are also both consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 102 removes a reference to ""other benefits"" that can be taken into account so as to make it clear that only accommodation, board and health insurance are reckonable components for computing the remuneration to be paid to a foreign national. Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 provide the Minister with revocation grounds if the holder of the intra-company transfer or contract for services permit is not adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of his or her stay in the State. Amendment No. 109 clarifies that the remuneration in question is the salary as set out in the definition of remuneration at new section 1A to be inserted into the Act of 2006 and that the salary must not be less than national minimum wage. Amendment No. 110 inserts a cross-reference to section 12(6)(b) which pertains to the hourly rate specified under an enactment, such as any successor to the employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements. Amendment No. 111 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 112. The latter amendment provides for the revocation of an employment permit where the required statement of earnings does not comply with the requirements of new section 3D(1)(c) or section 3E(1)(b) to be inserted into the Act of 2006 in respect of intra-company transfer or contract for services employment permits. Finally, amendment No. 116 provides for information, documents and evidence to be prescribed under section 29 at renewal stage and the provision of such information within a prescribed period. It also requires the provision, at renewal stage, of information on the remuneration paid to the foreign national during the period for which a intra-company transfer or a contract services employment permit was granted. I am considering some further minor amendments to section 5 of the Bill and will revert at Report Stage on these."

(2) In this Act— (a) references to remuneration in relation to an application for the grant of an employment permit and the consideration of such application by the Minister shall be construed as the remuneration, specified in that application, that is proposed to be paid by— (i) the person who has made the offer of employment in respect of which the application is made, (ii) in the case of an employment permit for the purpose referred to in section 3A(2)(d), the foreign employer, in accordance with section 3D and the payments in respect of the remuneration to be paid, in accordance with section 3D, by the connected person, or (iii) in the case of an employment permit for the purpose referred to in section 3A(2)(e), the contractor in accordance with section 3E, and (b) references to remuneration after a permit has been granted shall be construed as the remuneration paid to the holder of the permit by an employer, a foreign employer in accordance with section 3D, a connected person in accordance with section 3D, or a contractor in accordance with section 3E, during the period for which the employment permit has been granted in respect of the employment for which the employment permit was granted.”.”.

14427	SeanSherlock	Labour	15177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-26 00:00:00	Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014: Committee Stage	92	 Regarding amendment No. 27, the purpose of providing access to the Irish labour market to the spouses, civil partners and dependants of critical skills employment permit holders and third country researchers under Council Directive 2005/71/EC is to differentiate Ireland by enhancing its attractiveness as a destination for this cohort of highly-skilled migrants when compared with our competitors.  As such, this is a deliberate policy decision.  During drafting of the Bill, the issue of separation and divorce was considered.  The legal advice the Department received was that the Bill cannot cross over into the legislative domain of the Minister for Justice and Equality determining or defining separation or divorce.  Second, the question for the Minister for the purposes of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit is whether there is a subsisting relationship of spouse, partner or dependant, that is, it is for the applicant of such permit to satisfy the Minister that he or she is a spouse, partner or dependant at the time of application or renewal. The status of relationships between the primary permit holder and his or her family members is a matter for the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The situation pertaining to the presence in the State of former partners or spouses of primary permits holders is in the first instance a matter for that Minister.  Establishing the situation of a spouse or civil partner whose relationship with the primary permit holder has come to an end is beyond the remit of the employment permits system.  However, the reactivation employment permit scheme should facilitate such individuals whose circumstances have changed and who have obtained permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to remain in the State in their own right.  On this basis, the majority of cases of separated spouses will be capable of being catered for in the new permits system and as such, I am not accepting the Deputy’s amendment

The statutory provisions still apply.  To be clear, a labour market needs test is not required for a reactivation employment permit.  For the record, the main criterion to be applied to reactivation is that the remuneration must be the national minimum wage or higher.  This applies to applications for employment permits in respect of all occupations except occupations in a domestic setting.  The prospective employee must possess the relevant qualifications, skills or experience required for the employment.  Applications will only be accepted in respect of employees who previously entered the legal market legally on foot of an employment permit, are holders of a temporary stamp 1 and have a reactivation employment permit letter from the Department of Justice and Equality.

This is to deter abuses of the proposed reactivation employment permit.  An application cannot be considered if the foreign national does not meet all of the criteria.  Deputy Tóibín's amendment would result in an additional mandatory provision that very few foreign nationals would be able to meet - that is, only foreign nationals who have entered into civil proceedings, which would significantly narrow the field of potential applicants under this permit type.  The Minister's intention in creating this type of employment permit is to facilitate those foreign nationals who have fallen out of the employment permit system to re-enter employment in line with employment permits legislation.  It is not a back door for illegal economic migrants who have not been, or would not be under current legislation, granted employment permits.  An amendment to facilitate this would run counter to the Government's broad policy on employment permits.  It is on that basis that I cannot accept this amendment.

Amendments No. 33 and 35 are consequential to amendment No. 34.  Amendment No. 34 ensures this type of permit is expressly linked to skills shortages clearly identified by the expert group on future skills needs.  Amendment No. 36 restricts its duration to a period of 12 months.  Amendment No. 77 is consequential to amendment No. 78, which enables the Minister to refuse to grant an internship employment permit if he or she is not satisfied that the course or the employment in question relates to skills that are designated by regulations and clearly identified by the expert group on future skills needs to be in short supply.  Amendment No. 79 is consequential to amendment No. 78.  Amendment No. 80 provides for the 12-month duration of an internship employment permit.

To provide greater context, this goes back to previous amendments. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, respectively, define the date of dismissal and dismissal by reason of redundancy, in terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. This is required in the context of provisions in section 22 of the Bill dealing with holders of critical skills employment permits and general employment permits who have been made redundant, as well as provisions in section 7 of the Bill that prohibit an employment permit application being made where the employment concerned was the subject of redundancy in the preceding six months. To provide further clarification on amendment No. 40, it ensures that employment permits are not issued in respect of vacancies that have arisen through or were positions subject to redundancy in the preceding six months. It is designed to prevent the possibility of an employer making existing staff redundant in order to replace them with non-EEA nationals. It is important that the legislation has safeguards against distortions to the labour market. This is one such safeguard. Amendment No. 45 adds a requirement that information regarding any recent redundancies which may relate to a vacancy for which an application is being made be submitted as part of the employment permit.

The labour market needs test, LMNT, seeks to ensure an offer of employment is first made to persons already in the local and European economic area, EEA, labour markets before an application is made for an employment permit to employ a non-EEA national.  This supports Government policy to ensure Irish and EEA nationals currently in the labour market are the first cohort employers should look to.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 60, inclusive, are technical.  Amendment No. 62 is also technical.  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting amendment.  Amendments Nos. 64, 65, 69 and 70 are technical and consequential to amendment No. 62.  Amendments Nos. 66 and 68 are drafting amendments and replace the word “advertise” with the term “publish a notice”.  Amendment No. 67 describes what Ministers can set out in the regulations.

Reviews of decisions on the granting of employment permits are provided for in section 13 of the Act of 2006.  That section sets out that a review of a decision to refuse an employment permit shall be carried out by an officer of a grade senior to the grade of the person who made the refusal decision.  The segregation of duties in the employment permits area is applied accordingly.  The clarity imposed by the new provisions, in conjunction with this clear review structure, ensures the application, the refusal and the review process are based on transparent and explicit rules with a basis in law.  In this context, it is the Minister’s view that setting up an independent process would create an unnecessary extra layer of administration with cost implications and no discernible benefits.  On this basis, I do not accept the Deputy’s amendment.

The Department has considered the waiving of fees in exceptional circumstances.  However, the Bill is intended to place the issue of employment permits on a clear, statutory basis to a level of detail which precludes consideration on a case-by-case basis of the widely varied circumstances of individual applicants.  This is what would be required were the Deputy's amendment to be accepted.  Furthermore, the grounds on which such a waiver might be applied would necessarily be based on a third-party and possibly unsubstantiated report into the circumstances of the applicant, or an investigation into those circumstances, which would likely cause considerable delay in the issuing of the permit and consequently might jeopardise the employment in prospect.  The levels at which fees are set will be stipulated by regulations and the Minister is committed to carrying out a review of the fees for employment permits later in the year.  More than 40% of applicants currently pay no fees.

Such documentation is likely to include a letter from the previous employer stating the permit holder has been made redundant within the past six months and an explanation as to why, the previous employer's certified copy of the permit issued for that permit holder and a copy of the P45 which must be dated within the past six months.  The provision of this documentation establishes the bone fides of the circumstances applying.  Only rarely does the Department come across instances where such documentation has not been forthcoming from previous employers.  In practice, where this does arise, it will request that the documentation be forwarded directly and the matter is resolved in this manner.  The amendment is not necessary.

14833	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 The target is 85 per annum reaching approximately 100 per annum up to 2016 and beyond.  One cannot give a definitive figure because many variables enter into the fray, including intellectual property and commercialisation of research, but the most important point is that we are in a space where we are seeking to spin out as many companies as possible on an indigenous basis.  I believe the number for last year was 31.  One would hope to see that increasing but on the high potential start-ups, the target is 85 reaching a final target of approximately 100 per year from 2016.
14834	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 I had a meeting with Mr. Cunningham yesterday.  The budget line is important because the event, which will take place in mid-July next year, will attract researchers and persons within the scientific community at the highest level to our shores.  This is a pan-European win, so to speak.  The fact that we were able to win that competition against stiff competition from places like Vienna is a good testament to where we stand within that global scientific community. That win and this investment is vital in terms of our reputation because in enabling us to attract top level researchers we are sending out further signals into the research and science field.  That will result in added wins for us in the future.  We will gain from it by virtue of its profiling in the first instance.  The programme is comprehensive and intensive.  It will roll out across the State over the 12 months but will be focused primarily within those four or five days.  The fact that there will be industry involvement and all of the stakeholders involved over those four or five days will ensure we will be able to lay a further foundation or ramp it up, so to speak, to ensure we can make further gains in this field ultimately in terms of foreign direct investment.
14835	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 One way of looking at the overall picture it is to consider the level of FDI in 2003, for example.  In that year, the proportion of IDA client wins with a research and development component was approximately 10%, valued at €120 million.  In 2009-10, some 50% of FDI was research and development investment and it was valued at €500 million.  That is one important metric upon which we can work. If one considers the budget for Science Foundation Ireland, €15.3 million, and the collaboration involving over 500 companies on joint research initiatives, one will note the arrangement supports €73 billion in exports.  It is a valuable component but we need to consider further how many indigenous companies we can spin out.  We must consider whether there is a value to continuing with the investment in the centres of excellence and research clusters.  I believe there is because it maintains a vital FDI component because of the collaborations with industry.  One must take cognisance of the investment in basic research because, if we do not continue to invest in basic and applied research, we will not be able to achieve the spin-outs in the medium to longer term.  We need to ensure we get the balance right between the investment in basic and applied research, maintaining Science Foundation Ireland investment through the clusters and centres of excellence and trying to set metrics or targets. Progressing from basic research into the commercialisation field remains a challenge.  We must ask where it is best for the State to invest.  This conversation is taking place and will continue.
14836	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	 The hosting of the event will cost €6 million.  The Exchequer contribution over the period 2009 to 2012 is to be €2.973 million.  The funding provided for 2011 is based on the 2009 decision by the previous Government.  One will not know the wins until the event takes place; they cannot be projected.  We want to use the event as a showcase for Irish science and research across all the disciplines. Let us consider the next EU framework programme, which I am told should be called Horizon 2020 rather than Framework 8.  If we are involved in this programme in its early stages, we will be able to influence funding lines by virtue of the enhanced reputation we hope to gain as a result of the hosting the event, which will attract top researchers and scientists from across the world.  There will be a win for tourism in that 5,000 delegates will be brought to the Convention Centre Dublin.
14837	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	 There is potential for delegates to spend up to €4.8 million, according to one estimate, and to raise €1.1 million in taxation.  There is a win by virtue of holding the event itself but there will be a further medium-term gain because of the reputation enhancement.

The figure of €8.5 million includes a new programme of €2.5 million born from the enterprise platform programme which was transferred from Department of Education and Skills.  It is funded from current funds.  I can get Deputy O'Dea a more comprehensive explanation in writing.
14841	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	128	 A total of 20 companies and eight research groups won new contracts for 2010 amounting to €10 million.  There is a return on the investment.  I visited a company, SensL, in Cork recently, which is doing work in this space.  The subhead supports indigenous industries and start-ups.  One would have had a healthy scepticism about this.  I believe we are getting the return on the investments.

14851	SeanSherlock	Labour	14203.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	6	" I thank the Deputy for his proposed amendment.  The amendment refers to section 5(3) and the motion is for the deletion of lines 6 to 10 and the insertion of ""no later than three months after the passing of this Bill into law"".  The text of section 5(3) is standard and allows for the Act to come into operation on a date or dates to be specified in an order or orders.  This gives ministerial discretion on when the Act would become effective in law. The purpose of the subsection is to allow for any administrative changes required before the Act can be commenced.  In this instance it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them into line with the London agreement.  The proposed amendments to the Patents Rules 1992 are being drafted at present.  I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to commence the Act and the new Patents (Amendment) Rules 2011 by way of an order or orders as near to the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Act 2011 as possible.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment on this basis."
14852	SeanSherlock	Labour	14203.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 I assure the Deputy there is a sense of urgency about this matter.  However, I cannot give him a definitive timeframe today.  Dialogue with the Office of the Attorney General is ongoing.  We are in a queue, if one will, in terms of our deliberations with the Attorney General.  We are pressing her office as much as possible to try to have the legislation expedited in as timely a fashion as possible.  While I am not in a position to give a definitive timeframe, I am cognisant of the need to ensure we get all the pieces together and expedite the legislation as quickly as possible.

14854	SeanSherlock	Labour	14203.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 If the Deputy wishes to check the record, the initiation process for this legislation was started some time ago under the previous Government.   I am not trying to fudge the question in any way but I can only speak about my time as a Minister of State.  We are discussing Committee Stage of the Bill in a new Parliament that was given a mandate this year.  I contend that we are proactively engaging with the matter in hand.  In terms of the historical perspective, there was a process of engagement and the legislation was initiated.  As to the reason the Bill did not come to Committee, Report and Final Stages earlier, one could argue - again I am not trying to fudge the question - that is a matter for previous Administrations.
14855	SeanSherlock	Labour	14203.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	18	" The message we are sending today is that the unitary patent is a matter of European Union policy, as agreed by all of the member states.  The concept of the EU patent, which was previously known as the ""Community patent"" is to provide a patent system that is affordable and devoid of administrative barriers across the member states.  We all buy into that process because it will benefit all stakeholders.  Any Irish businesses seeking to bring goods to market or exploit the potential of their intellectual property and so forth will be able to do so in a streamlined and consolidated process.  We are evolving towards that position.  What the Bill does is legislate for the London agreement to which Ireland signed up.  It is another staging post.  The Government is actively grappling with this matter and, as I indicated to Deputy O'Dea, issues have arisen in respect of further engagement with the Attorney General.  The matter is ongoing and we are taking a proactive approach to it as we are conscious of the need to expedite the legislation."

14862	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	10	" That is fine.  The proposed amendments are not accepted.  Amendments Nos. 1, 9 and 14 are rejected as there is no question of the abolition of the Teaching Council.  Education is at the heart of this Government's ambition to build a more cohesive, equal and successful society and economy, and teachers are at the heart of education.  The Teaching Council has a central role in delivering on the education reform agenda in ensuring that we have quality teachers to meet the challenges ahead.  The full implementation of the Teaching Council Act, when possible, will support a cohesive framework of teacher education, professionalism and registration based on quality inputs across the whole continuum of teacher education.  It is hoped to commence the few but critically important remaining sections as soon as is practicable. The Teaching Council's work directly impacts on the attainment of the strategic high-level goals of the Department of Education and Skills.  It has a central role in effecting the change necessary for implementation, for example, of the literacy and numeracy strategy, junior cycle reform and requirements for robust teacher induction processes.  Its statutory responsibilities of maintaining, promoting and improving standards of teaching are key to supporting the Department's priority of improving the quality, relevance and inclusiveness of education for every learner in our schools. As the professional standards body for the teaching profession, the Teaching Council seeks to set and uphold high professional standards for teaching and teachers.  It does this in the interests of pupils and the public good but equally for the reputation and status of the profession.  Quality of teaching has been determined as the single most influential factor towards achieving good educational outcomes for students.  The work of the council is focused towards the maintenance and improvement of the standards of teaching. Developments that have taken place or are under way include: developing and implementing a continuum of education which links the professional, education and training needs throughout all phases of a teacher's career; restructuring and extending the  programmes of initial teacher education so newly qualified teachers are better equipped for the needs of the modern day classroom; reviewing and accrediting teacher education programmes; putting in place higher qualification and teacher education standards for teachers in the three sectors of primary, post-primary and further education; putting in place strict good character and Garda vetting requirements; publishing a code of professional conduct for teachers, which is currently being revised; preparing to put in place induction and probation procedures for newly qualified or registered teachers; preparing for fitness to teach procedures and processes; developing a continuing professional development framework for teachers; promoting research and engaging in debate on policy issues related to education; and enhancing the status of the profession and promoting teaching as a career.  A new council has just been appointed on March 28 for a period of four years and I and my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Quinn and Cannon, look forward to working with the council to advance our common goals. The effect of amendment No. 10 would be to require the Teaching Council to provide an up-to-date online register listing available teachers to the Minister and each vocational education committee.  This would place an additional requirement on the Teaching Council to monitor the availability of registered teachers for employment, which is not appropriate to the remit of the Teaching Council.  The council's role is fundamentally to regulate the teaching profession and therefore I will not be accepting this amendment. There are already administrative arrangements in place to prioritise the appointment of unemployed registered teachers.  Under Circular 31/2011, issued by the Department of Education and Skills in summer 2011, schools are required to keep a list of those appropriately qualified registered teachers who inform the school that they are available for substitute teaching work.  Teachers who are in receipt of an occupational pension must be excluded from this list, thereby prioritising unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension.  Where the school wishes to source a teacher for short-term substitution duties, the above list or national services such as SubSearch or TextaSub should be utilised to source a registered teacher who is not in receipt of an occupational pension.  Only where an appropriately qualified registered teacher who is not retired is unavailable should the school move to employ an appropriately qualified and registered retired teacher.  The above regulations seek to provide the greatest possible opportunity for unemployed and newly qualified teachers while safeguarding the policy of the Department, which is that, to the greatest extent possible, only appropriately qualified and registered teachers should be employed in our schools. Amendment No. 11 seeks to ensure that a person could not be employed in place of a registered teacher without this being governed by ministerial regulation.  As written, the provision states that where the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to facilitate the urgent temporary or occasional staffing needs of recognised schools, he or she may from time to time prescribe regulations governing the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed in place of a registered teacher and any condition that might attach to that employment.  Those conditions could relate to a maximum time limit for his or her employment and the purposes for which he or she is employed.  The Act does not give the Minister discretion to do anything else through which an unregistered person could be employed in a teaching post. Therefore, if the Minister does not make regulations specifying the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed, such a person cannot be employed.  The Oireachtas is only permitting this to be done by regulation and not by any other instrument.  Amendment No. 11 is therefore unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it. With regard to amendment No. 12, the phrase of employing an unregistered person ""in place of a registered teacher"" is used in certain places in the new section 24, in subsections 8(a), 10(a) and 10(f).  However, there are also references to teaching positions in subsections 9(a), 10(a) and 10(b).  The reality is that in the very limited exceptions in which the employment of an unregistered person will be permitted, that person will be engaged in a teaching post.  The wording is simply designed to reflect this.  The fact that a person employed in such a post does not make him or her a teacher.  The amendment proposed is therefore unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it."
14863	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 We must defer to the expertise of the Deputies in these areas.  If one is to look at the Teaching Council, one could argue that the Teaching Council and this committee should have a qualitative analysis of the role of the Teaching Council in May.  I do not want to be controversial.  Some 22 of 37 members of the Teaching Council are teachers or are allied to the teaching profession through representative organisations.  Rather than the State or the Department dealing with qualitative issues, the conversation could happen in the committee.  With due respect to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, I cannot comment on the outcome or the number of people who voted in elections.  I take the point that the low turnout may reflect a certain annoyance.  The way to deal with this, if I may be so bold as to suggest it, is for the committee to engage with the Teaching Council on its qualitative role.  With 22 of the 37 members of the council allied to the teaching profession, many things can be worked out.  The new board is in situ, which should give grounds for hope.  It could serve as a potential new departure in dealing with the issues Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan raised. Regarding Deputy Smith's comments, qualifications for entry to the profession are set by the Teaching Council.  The Minister has the power to determine what qualifications the teacher should have for a publicly paid job, such as a special needs assistants or a resource teacher.  The right to set the qualification exists under the Education Act 1998. Regarding registration delays, a new teacher is registered within two weeks of application.  We readily accept there is a resource issue with vetting.  With 40,000 teachers, it will take time for the vetting process to succeed and be expedited.  The point is well made and we accept the concerns raised by the Deputy.  The Government is seeking to work through the issue.
14864	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 There is a dialogue to be had on this point.  It is a continuing challenge.  I will relate this point to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to see how it can be addressed.
14865	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	25	 A working group has been set up on this point.  It involves stakeholders, including unions, the Teaching Council and the Department.  I am happy to facilitate the process or relay the message to ask the Minister to communicate directly on that issue.
14866	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	32	 It is a technical amendment, not a qualitative judgment on educational disadvantage.  I do not accept amendment No. 2.  The definition of educational disadvantage as currently laid down in statute is not being amended but section 2 of the 1998 Act is amended to restore the definition of educational disadvantage.  The rationale for section 4(a) of the Bill is to safeguard the definition of educational disadvantage as currently laid down in statute.  The provision in the Bill is not to alter the definition of educational disadvantage but to include a technical amendment which, due to the repeal of section 32 of the Education Act 1998, requires the definition to be reinstated in the 1998 Act.
14867	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	37	" I move amendment No. 4: In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section: 5.—Section 7 of the Act of 1998 is amended— (a) by substituting the following paragraph for paragraph (a) of subsection (4): ""(a) shall have regard to— (i) the resources available, (ii) the need to secure, as far as possible, that the education system provides— (I) best practice in teaching methods, (II) value for money, and (III) quality outcomes for students, by setting standards for those engaged in the provision of education, including the determination both of procedures and such other matters as are provided for by this Act, (iii) the provision for education and training made by other agencies with funds provided by the Oireachtas, (iv) the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State, and (v) the practices and traditions relating to the organisation of schools or groups of schools existing at the commencement of this Part and the right of schools to manage their own affairs in accordance with this Act and any charters, deeds, articles of management or other such instruments relating to their establishment or operation, and"", and (b) by repealing subsections (5) and (6) (inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004).”. This is largely technical.  In the course of the legislative process, the Office of the Attorney General raised a question as to what guidance the Minister has when making procedures for the appointment, suspension and dismissal of school staff under section 24 of the Education Act.  There was a concern the sorts of considerations the Minister should have regard to in determining these and other procedures were not spelled out adequately in the Education Act.  The office has advised there is a need to set out the principles and policies the Minister must take into account in determining procedures such as these under the Act.  Amendment No. 4 will do this.  Section 7 of the Education Act 1998 provides for the functions of the Minister for Education and Skills, and subsection (4) provides for the considerations the Minister must have regard to in carrying out his functions.  The amendment being proposed adds a provision to that subsection requiring that in determining procedures, the Minister will have regard to best practice in teaching methods, value for money and quality outcomes for students."
14868	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 It is a checks and balances measure designed to ensure the Minister does not have a completely free hand in decisions.
14869	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 With respect, is the Deputy's question related to this amendment or is she speaking in the wider context?
14870	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	46	 For the purposes of the argument that I anticipate the Deputy will put forward on the issue of consultation, I think it may arise later in the debate.
14871	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	47	" I move amendment No. 5: In page 5, to delete lines 4 to 10 and substitute the following: ""(c) be responsible, together with the board, parents of students and the teachers, for the creation in the school of an environment which is supportive of learning among the students and which promotes the professional development of the teachers,”. The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to remove a comma from after the word ""school"" in the third line and to insert it after the word ""responsible"" in the first line.  This is to improve the readability of the provision and there is no substantive change to the provision.  This is a straightforward amendment."
14872	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	51	" We are dealing with amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 13 together.  The effect of the amendments will be to introduce a general requirement that the Minister must agree with the education partners any change in the numbers, qualifications, and terms and conditions of employment of teachers and other school staff.  It also continues the requirement to reach agreement with all parties on appointment, suspension and dismissal procedures.  These matters were discussed at length in the Seanad. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 introduce a requirement to consult and agree numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment generally of school staff.  This would set aside the existing provision, whereby the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform determine the terms and conditions of employment.  I am not accepting these amendments as they would diminish the existing powers in legislation given to the Ministers, and by extension the Government, regarding numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of teachers and other staff remunerated from public funds. In respect of amendment No. 13, the existing legal provision concerns three aspects of the terms and conditions of teachers and other staff, namely, appointment, suspension and dismissal.  The provision is limited to the procedures that apply or are to be carried out in respect of the three aspects.  The new provision ensures legal clarity in carrying out recruitment, suspension or dismissal as the procedures that apply in future will not be subject to a potential veto by one party withholding agreement.  I am not accepting amendment No. 13 because it would maintain such a veto.  I understand the concerns about substituting the word ""consultation"" for ""agreement"".  These fears can be allayed outside the statutory provisions by using the existing well developed partnership structures.  During the recent passage of the Bill through the Seanad my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruarí Quinn, set out the context for and the background to the provisions of the Bill.  There was clear affirmation of ongoing partnership within the school system.  He reminded the other House ""that ""agreement"" does not mean unanimity or veto and ""consultation"" does not mean diktat or imposition.""  He assured Senators that ""following enactment of this Bill, my officials will engage in discussions with the education partners on having a general consensus around the extent and quality of this consultation and on how agreements are reached.""  He has also given a commitment to ""utilising established procedures, such as the Teachers Conciliation Council, as a vehicle for these discussions.""  He has clarified that the Department of Education and Skills ""will also engage directly with patron bodies which are not members of the council."""
14873	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	55	 I do not.
14874	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	57	 The board of the school will remain as the employer.
14875	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	59	 Is the Deputy suggesting there will be a change in the status quo as a result of this Bill?
14876	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	61	 As a former principal, the Deputy will be aware that disciplinary procedures have been in place since 2009.  That should answer her question.
14877	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 No, it will not.
14878	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	80	 This matter was raised in the Seanad.  The provisions of the Bill, combined with section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, prohibit the payment of a person employed as a teacher in a school unless he or she is a registered teacher.  The only exception is where, due to urgent, temporary or occasional staffing needs, it is necessary to employ an unregistered person.  Therefore, the pay of a teacher is stopped if his or her registration lapses. The Bill does not provide for a direction to dismiss a teacher who is not registered.  Protection for schools against an unfair dismissals claim along the lines being advocated by this amendment would be arbitrary and disproportionate.  It would mean that a person whose registration lapses for even one day could be dismissed summarily and without recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The circumstances which may arise may be as varied as a teacher allowing his or her registration to lapse for a small number of days due to a circumstance where an individual does nothing about getting registered.  Where a person is unregistered for a small number of days but then becomes re-registered, he or she should be able to return to his or her job.  Where there is a longer period during which the unregistered person is prevented from being paid by the State, he or she may wish to avail of unpaid leave, such as a career break, to gain the necessary qualifications to become registered with the Teaching Council.  Under these circumstances, no termination of the employment of the unregistered person takes place.  He or she simply cannot be paid from Oireachtas funds while he or she remains unregistered.  If a teacher allows his or her registration to lapse and absents himself or herself from school without approval, established grievance and disciplinary procedures may be followed to resolve the matter.  Even in this scenario a person should still expect to have the normal law protections, including access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for an unfair dismissals claim. Interposing the Minister in the employment contract by essentially permitting the immediate dismissal with impunity of a teacher who has allowed his or her registration to lapse runs counter to the concept of equal treatment and fair procedures.  A one-size-fits-all approach would be unjust.  Giving employers a licence to dismiss teachers without scrutiny must constitute an indiscriminate attack on their employment rights.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
14879	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	 To respond first to Deputy Smith's point on further education, section 30 only applies to teachers in recognised schools and does not apply to teachers in further education settings that are not, if one will, recognised schools.  I hope that addresses his point. On Deputy Crowe's point, while we can examine some of the scenarios that could arise, to be honest there is no ambiguity about the manner in which we have responded to the amendment tabled by Deputy Smith.  As I stated, interposing the Minister in the employment contract by essentially permitting the immediate dismissal with impunity of a teacher who has let his or her registration lapse would run counter to the concept of equal treatment.  The Government is cognisant of the rights of employees and I hope Deputy Crowe and his party will give due regard to this issue, as they are doing to a certain extent.  While I do not see how the scenario the Deputy described could arise, if he foresees certain other scenarios arising, perhaps he will notify them to the Department and we will respond accordingly.
14880	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	85	 While I do not wish to open a discussion on this matter, if someone is dismissed, he or she is potentially dismissed with good reason, having gone through all the machinery or architecture of the State.  I am still a little unclear as to what exactly the Deputy has in mind in this regard.  I understand his position in terms of ensuring the legislation is watertight, and the bona fides of his point are secure in that sense.  If there are specific scenarios-----
14881	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	90	 Section 8 provides for a minor change to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to cross-reference the amendment of section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provided for in section 6.

There is no question of abolition of the Teaching Council and, therefore, this section should stand.

14903	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	37	 In the 12 months since the last Estimates process, we have been engaged in the research prioritisation exercise that was chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.  We have quite literally stripped down the areas of prioritisation into 14 specific areas.  While I do not believe I need to outline what those areas are, they vary from future networks in communications to innovation in services and business processes.  What we have been seeking to do in the past 12 months is to move into a space whereby there is a closer alignment between academia, through the research component, and industry in order that we can move a new metric into the fray, namely, the effective creation of jobs.  That is what has been informing Government policy in this period. That research prioritisation exercise has given rise to another exercise, the prioritisation action group, which will be chaired by myself.  Its purpose is to look at the 14 areas of focus in the research prioritisation exercise and to drive an agenda to find how we can get that alignment between research and industry in a way that creates the jobs while also seeking to get more accurate measurement of the impact of research, for example, with regard to analysing the spend for research and innovation across various programmes and how we can drive new enterprises and jobs arising from that.  That process is ongoing as we speak.  It is an interdepartmental approach involving all of the funding agencies for research, such as HEA, SFI, Enterprise Ireland and so on.  The group has met twice and is looking at the various themes.  We have already looked at medical devices and food for health and we are now moving into sustainable food production and processing.  We will move through each of the themes individually. We are also moving to create an intellectual property protocol so there is a standardisation across all of the higher education institutes.  If we are creating intellectual property through the higher education system, we need to ensure everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet and there is a clear understanding, because of the various cultures that exist between different academic institutions, of what intellectual property is and how it is mined for a national usage to create those types of companies, innovations and jobs we need to create.  We are on target on the EU programme, framework programme 7.  We have drawn down approximately €360 million and our target is approximately €600 million.  We are on target to reach that.  The next framework is Horizon 2020, which is chaired by our Commissioner, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  We seek to ensure that from the proposed €85 billion spend we can influence how the calls are made.  There is significant bilateral engagement ongoing currently and we are hopeful that we will reach a higher target than the €600 million already espoused. We are also moving to launch the research centres programme.  In essence, we are trying to see greater consolidation.  We have come from a position where, in the mid 1990s - former Minister, Deputy Martin, rolled out the original programme - we were building capacity through the capital spend and through the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, to now where we are seeking to move the research community with us in a way that ensures that everybody realises we need to create more jobs and that we realise the importance of the FDI infrastructure here.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said already, increasingly more of the investment is predicated on the pre-existing research infrastructure.  It is no longer just about corporate tax anymore, but as much about one's footprint across research, science, technology, innovation and research and development and innovation.  Those metrics and how the Government funds those areas is as important an indicator for inward investment.  What we are trying to do is to create a greater indigenous space of the types of companies that we are funding so that we rebalance the ship in a way that creates more sustainable indigenous Irish companies that can compete on a global scale.  This is a high level overview of where we are currently.
14904	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 On the last question, there has been an increase in the number of companies that have taken up innovation vouchers through Enterprise Ireland.  What we are seeking to do is to continue along that vein, but also to encourage smaller businesses, with 50 people or fewer, to engage more with the research infrastructure.  Very often Irish-owned businesses, particularly family businesses, do not move into that space.  These businesses are often in the services sector and do not see any need for interfacing with academia.  However, if they have a relationship with Enterprise Ireland and are creating new innovations, new intellectual property or new types of services, they will have the opportunity to avail of these innovation vouchers.  There were approximately 651 collaborative innovations between industry and third level in 2011, but I do not have the breakdown on these to hand. On the science, technology and innovation side, the chances are that if businesses in the SME sector have a relationship with Enterprise Ireland and are in the scientific or research related field, they will have a relationship with one of the research entities, either the strategic research clusters or the centres for science, engineering and technology.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's point.
14905	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	41	 I want to be satisfied the Deputy is okay with that response.
14906	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	43	 There was an increase last year, above the targeted level for 2011.  The output target for 2012 is 610, which is lower than the 2011 figure, but towards the end of last year there was a massive increase.  We must remember it is a demand-led scheme.  With regard to any of the companies employing 50 people or fewer to which I talked, what one seeks to do is to try to encourage them, through Enterprise Ireland, to see whether there is scope within their individual entity for a relationship with the RDI programme, the institutes of technology, UCD, UCC or whatever.  The more of those relationships that are established, the more likely we will, through the innovation voucher system, get some sort of a new process or product which will create the jobs we badly need. On the Patents Office, it was previously included under the administrative subheads, but it now has its own subhead under programme B.  The reduction is accounted for by a reduction in pay.
14907	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	45	 It should be processing 100% of patents, but forgive me for not having a direct answer.  It is a demand led provision, so if demand is down, activity will be down.  With regard to the PRTLI, there has been a significant reduction in construction costs on that.  As a result of expenditure cutbacks, we have had to make cuts also.  Instead of having a pro rata cut across the board, we have removed three structural PhD programmes for 2011 and have deferred them.  We will consider them again in the context of the 2013 programme.  I have the titles of the three programmes and can supply them to the Deputy later.
14908	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	49	 In my area, where UCC and CIT are based, it is easy for industry to get access to the institutions.  The Rubicon and Nimbus centres are based in CIT and UCC runs the IGNITE programme, which encourages interaction between industry, start-up businesses and the academic institution.  It depends on which way one looks at the case of a small business that wants to innovate.  A company that wants to innovate and create something new will go to the city or county enterprise board or Enterprise Ireland.  Is Deputy Tóibín suggesting the institutes should come out and engage with the business?  The creation of a liaison office is very easy.  I would be very surprised if there is not someone who interacts with business on a daily basis, through Dundalk IT, in the region Deputy Tóibín is talking about.
14909	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	52	 It is a very good idea.  Coming from Cork and having an eye to what is happening in the country, I see it in operation throughout the regions on a daily basis.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, it is a mechanism through which county enterprise boards can have an eye on what is happening academically.  We can explore that and I am prepared to talk to Deputy Tóibín about it.  The Department has an open mind on the engagement.  If Deputy Tóibín is saying there is a deficit in the Navan and Meath area, we should examine it to see if an improvement can be made.  This is an apolitical space so the more ideas we have coming from the committee on making the system more beneficial for users, the better.  I freely acknowledge that previous Governments started out on this road and we must give due recognition.  I also give due recognition to the visionary people within the Department, who interface with our agencies every day and play the ground hurling on this.
14910	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 The University of Limerick has the Lero software centre, which is a global leader performing world-class research.  The Government and SFI have invested €16 million in the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre.  The key to such centres is collaboration.  Its partners include DCU, Dundalk IT, NUIG, TCD, UCD and UL.  There is also an interface with the industry.  The SFI CSET award is augmented to the tune of €6.4 million by IBM Ireland, Intel, QAD, Kugler Maag CIE and Movidious.  That is the system we are trying to ensure works. The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre considers themes such as water management, smart cities, transport infrastructure and ensures output will be influenced by academic pursuits, industry and societal needs.  I refer to smart cities and the issue of water which is very prevalent.  The smart use of water and the application of technological advances to the delivery of water and using Lero, the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, as an example, there is a societal or beneficial outcome which will ultimately benefit the economy.
14911	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	57	 I may not have fully answered Deputy Toíbín's question.  Three more research centres are planned and I apologise if I did not state this in my initial reply.  One centre is for cloud computing and €1.2 million funding was announced by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in April.  There is provision for the learning technologies centre to be established in June this year.  It is hoped the financial services centre will also be established this year but some background work still remains to be done.  Enterprise Ireland is working on a structure for regional gateways.  To be helpful to the Deputy, I suggest he might engage with Enterprise Ireland with regard to his own specific area.
14912	SeanSherlock	Labour	14405.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 The European Space Agency is a hardy perennial.  Approximately 22 Irish companies and at least 12 research groups are involved in space-related activities.  In terms of our investment of €14.779 million in the agency, research carried out in 2008 showed that the financial investment to the economy of our investment of approximately €13.5 million in the agency in 2007 was approximately €21 million in foreign investment.  In a recent survey of 30 companies involved with the European Space Agency there were 19 respondents which reported growth increased in value terms from €51 million in 2008 to €71 million in 2010 and they project it will increase by up to €168 million by 2014. I can name two companies in this area with which I am familiar, Radisens Diagnostics and TreeMetrics.  They are both start-up companies effectively, but Radisens Diagnostics is funded by the European Space Agency.  It develops a point-of-care bloodtesting device and it will be used in the International Space Station.  The fact that its diagnostic device is being used in the final frontier has a beneficial impact because if it is rubber-stamped up there, the company will see a massive growth in its sales potential.  It will benefit from the kudos attached to the use of its device there.  While I would have been among the sceptics in questioning the value of our membership at the beginning, there is a qualitative impact from the spend of approximately €14.7 million in terms of the number of jobs it creates.  The number employed in Radisens Diagnostics will increase from 13 to approximately 35 in 2013.  One can imagine the impact on the economy of the creation of 35 jobs.  I, our Department and the Government believe that the spend is worth it because there is a return to the domestic economy. TreeMetrics is in the business of forest inventory management and it is developing new overseas markets.  As a result of it getting a grant from the European Space Agency, it projects the number it will employ in 2012 will be €16 million or 16 people.  It also works with Coillte.

The net point is that while membership of the European Space Agency might seem to be something that is quite esoteric and one might wonder why we should invest in it, the proof of the pudding is that it is generating jobs in the Irish economy.  It is helping Irish companies to grow their businesses, their output is increasing in monetary terms, and they are creating new jobs.  That is the bottom line.  We have to go by the 2007 figures, which are the latest ones I have available.  For a spend of €13.5 million in 2007, we had a return of €21 million.  Those are the most recent figures I have but we will try to get more up-to-date figures.

14925	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	111	 I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 27. WhatsApp is going to ask new users to confirm that they are aged 16 years, Facebook will ask children between 13 years and 15 years to nominate a parent or guardian to grant permission, children who do not have parental permission for Facebook will see a generic version of Facebook that is not customised, based on their personal data. This shows that children will continue to have access to the Internet, but their data will not be exploited. Setting the digital age at 16 years will not mean that a 13 year old cannot use Facebook, which I am using as an example, however, it will mean that Facebook cannot use the 13 year old. The child will be protected from targeted advertising derived from personal data. This is not so different from the rules placing a ban on advertisements targeted at children in the offline world, including broadcasting. The point is that while people may make the argument that no matter whether the age of digital consent is set at 13 years or 16 years, the technology is not yet available to check age verification at this stage and that a young person of 13 years could pretend to be older. We are putting an onus on social media companies to ensure they are adhering to a clear legal guideline; they are not allowed to exploit the data of somebody within that age cohort for commercial purposes. That is the protection we are seeking to put in place. We all agree with the arguments of prominent people like Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the issue of child protection. One could argue that the drafters of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child could not possibly have foreseen companies like Facebook and WhatsApp, commercial companies that can exploit children and use their information. They can use their name, address and date of birth and geotag them; they know exactly where they are and have access to all of their photographs. They can use that information for nefarious purposes and most definitely drive their bottom line. What we are seeking to do in putting forward this amendment is to keep in line with many other European countries that are also in this space. Those states are interpreting the regulation from the European Union. We are also seeking to ensure we do not have a situation where children aged 13 to 16 years are being exploited and their information is being used to commercial advantage. We wish to put the onus back on social media companies. I repeat that WhatsApp and Facebook have already announced their intention to adopt a uniform approach in line with that taken in other European countries in how they use data. They are putting protocols in place to that effect. I, therefore, ask the Government to accept a digital age of consent of 16 years on the basis that the market seems to be moving in that direction. Social media companies are moving in that way and we should not be behind the curve in how we interpret the regulation. We should at least be on it, if possible.

I think all of us in this House would like to see a compendium of legislation that deals with all the issues, particularly online. Mobile technology is now moving at such a pace that regulations in certain areas are soon outmoded by dint of advances in technology. We should therefore take an overarching view. I seek clarification on this amendment. I note the Minister of State's comments on the 1956 Act. I would like his confirmation on the following question. Since the Bill does not speak specifically to private members' clubs, could it be said - and I will be guided by the Chairman on this - that one would in effect, by dint of supporting this amendment, be making new law if one were to seek to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act? Nonetheless, I welcome the Minister of State's statement in the round.

Three cent to €10 per spin or per game is a significant increase. As legislators, we must consider the exceptions that can be created, no matter what type of figure one puts on the cost per game and the prize money. When legislating for specific figures, no matter what figure one puts in, even if it is low, one must not drive people into other forms of gambling. The advocates from the public health point of view, such as Mr. Barry Grant and Dr. Colin O'Gara, have made a legitimate case in terms of these specific figures. We have listened to them in that regard.

Would the effect of the amendments be such that if my neighbour, who is of pensionable age and likes the odd flutter on a Saturday night, and who might purchase a lottery ticket but also likes to go to the bookies to bet on two or three numbers, be prevented from having that flutter?

One would have to go into every single bookmaker's shop in the country and seek to measure the revenue arising from bets on the Lotto numbers on Wednesday and Saturday nights. I am not sure how feasible that is. The Minister of State might have a response to my remark nonetheless.

I ask the Minister of State to set out the Government's rationale for introducing a two-year period for retaining data in the case of telephony and a one-year period in the case of Internet data.  I seek a clearer view of the Government's position in this matter before justifying my amendment."
14942	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	 With respect, I asked the Minister to speak to my amendment in order that I could then respond.
14943	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 I presume that I am entitled to respond to the Government's justification for its position on the Bill.
14944	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 The Minister of State's justification for the Government's position, vis-à-vis the two-year retention period for telephony and the one-year retention period for Internet data, is on the basis of security and counter-terrorism measures.  I understand that rationale and no one would argue against it, but I take issue with the time periods.  That is the reason we have sought to have them reduced from two years to one and from one year to six months, respectively.  In the context of the transposition of a directive that dates back to 2006, one speaks to the historical context of that directive and also refers to any subsequent legislation enacted that has more than adequately dealt with counter-terrorism or crime prevention measures such as the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act.  I am looking at the permutations of the Government’s position vis-à-vis the cost to business.  I submit that placing on Internet service providers or telephony companies an obligation that they must store data for two years would result in an undue cost burden.  One will not have an impact in terms of crime prevention or detection if one has existing legislation on surveillance. The average period in Europe for the retention of data varies.  In France there is a one-year time period.  In Germany it is six months.  Holland, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Romania all favour a six-month period also.  We should be mindful of where we are coming from.  We are talking about the transposition of a directive, therefore, let us look at the historical perspective.  We must consider whether there is a necessity to have the periods at two years and one year, respectively.  I submit that there is not.  I ask the Government to examine the industry-wide position, which is significant because of the cost burden on business that will have an impact on Irish businesses, and also the average retention periods across the European Union.  All I ask is that the Minister of State look at that matter and report back on Report Stage.
14945	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 The period of retention applied with a view to protecting one's human rights could equally be shorter.  There is no restriction in this regard.  Nobody argues against the need to protect human rights.  I am not sure if the Minster of State understands my point.  If, for instance, one refers to the Internet as relatively new technology and considers all the various components, including social networking websites, and factors such as the number of e-mails one receives and the number of hits on websites, one will realise that, by extending the timeframe, one is building into the legislation a mechanism whereby Internet service providers and telephony companies will be subject to a cost burden.  Let me be clear that nobody argues against the principle of data storage.  My point on shorter timeframes in other member states is based on the fact that, if these states have shorter timeframes and ours is the longest allowable, we are putting ourselves at a comparative disadvantage relative to the other countries competing on an e-commerce platform with this country.  One must bear in mind an average person's Internet usage, including the number of websites visited and whether the person uses Bebo, Facebook, Twitter or other such websites.  If all the hits must be stored by the ISP, this imposes an undue cost on it.
14946	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 To finish my point, if it is to be proved that an individual visited a particular website or that a message was sent from person A to person B over the Internet, through Facebook or otherwise, one is imposing a cost on the ISP.  It is a question of competitiveness.  We have long since moved on from the directive in terms of the threat posed prior to its instigation.  The Government is now going too far down the line.  I do not argue this point from a civil liberties perspective but from an economic and cost to business perspective.  The ability of the Garda to investigate is already well met by existing surveillance legislation.  If one added a six-month or one-year period in regard to telephony and Internet access, it would be more than adequate.  Will the Minister of State reconsider this matter and revert to me on Report Stage?
14947	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 It is unrelated to the legislation.
14948	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	 Chairman, may I——
14949	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	 Let us revert to the amendment.
14950	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	29	 If one takes that example——
14951	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	31	 The Minister of State distinguished between the content and the storing of data.
14952	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	33	 Let me finish the point, as I also wish to make that distinction.  The data must be stored.  I agree that the content of a message or e-mail is the subject of a different point.  I also agree that one must store data on the interaction or communication between two parties.  However, discussing a murder investigation is not realistic.  Thanks to the surveillance Act, I guarantee the Minister of State that his argument on this legislation will not prove valid.  Most of the information gleaned from communications via telephony will have been gleaned within a period of one year or six months.  The statistics will bear this out down the line.  There is a storage component.  The UK Government made a fund of £20 million available to Internet service providers and telephony companies for the same process.  The Government is going beyond what the UK Government did, despite the fact that the latter's position on the detection of crime is more sensitive in terms of the need for counter-terrorism measures.  We are trying to create a competitive environment for businesses.  Allowing for a period of one year would be reasonable.  Reducing it from two years would not impact negatively on the detection of crimes such as the one outlined by the Minister of State.  It was disingenuous of him to mention that case, as in doing so he deliberately sought to obscure the point of my amendment.
14953	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	" I did not use the word ""redundant""."

14955	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	39	" I move amendment No. 4: In page 5, subsection (4), line 20, after ""State"" to insert the following: ""and includes traffic data or location data and the related data, generated or processed within the State, necessary to identify the subscriber or user and includes only data relating to services provided to the user and not to data travelling across networks"". Ironically, this amendment seeks to strengthen the provision which reads: ""The data referred to in subsection (1) include data relating to unsuccessful call attempts that, in the case of data specified in Part 1 of Schedule 2, are stored in the State, or in the case of data specified in Part 2 of Schedule 2, are logged in the State”.  The question of jurisdiction comes into play, as we are discussing data stored within the State.  I believe in the fundamental concept of storing data for the prevention of crime; therefore, strengthening the provision is the concept behind my amendment."
14956	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	41	 I will not press the amendment, as I accept the Minister of State's comments.

This amendment seeks to strengthen the provisions of section 6."
14958	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	45	 In essence, the purpose of the amendment was to ensure data would not be destroyed once a request for disclosure is made.  I accept the Minister of State's response in this regard.
14959	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	53	" I move amendment No. 10: In page 6, subsection (5), lines 41 and 42, to delete all words from and including ""within"" in line 41 down to and including ""made"" in line 42 and substitute ""forthwith"". If an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, a colonel or a member of the Garda not below the rank chief superintendent phones an ISP or makes a disclosure request by telephone, this amendment seeks to ensure that the request comes in writing immediately.  I would have used the word ""immediately"", but I am advised that I must use the word ""forthwith"".  If a request is made, this amendment ensures that it is backed up immediately in writing.  Given the lackadaisical approach to carrying out requests sometimes, a phone call might be made but we might wait up to two months for the subsequent request for disclosure in writing.  I just want to strengthen that."
14960	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	55	" I move amendment No. 11: In page 6, after line 42, to insert the following new section: 7.—A provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope in that the request is not so wide as to place an undue cost on the service provider."". I speak again to the commercial cost to the ISP or telephone company.  If a disclosure request comes in and if it is as wide ranging as a chief superintendent determines it should be, then we have to be mindful of the cost to the service provider in yielding up that information. Before the Minister of State throws the criminal investigation argument at me, I am trying to speak to common sense.  We do not want a chief superintendent or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners coming in with a disclosure request that is not focused, not narrow, or not targeted.  They may trawl the net as wide as possible.  Some degree of common sense should be applied whereby they are mindful of the cost to the ISP or the telephone company. There is no fund available to the ISPs or the telephone companies to meet the costs of the storage of this data, unlike in the UK.  There would obviously be an implied cost to them to provide the data.  We effectively want a degree of common sense."

One of the parties to the memorandum of association is the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, ISPAI.  Its submission on this legislation states that section 7 is far too wide and unwieldy and takes no account of what is reasonable, technically possible and not very expensive.  Its recommendation is that a provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope, namely, that the request is not so wide as to be very expensive to service.  My amendment is based on the wording of the submission of the ISPAI on this legislation. I understand what the Minister of State is saying about the memorandum of understanding.  Active stakeholders from the telephony and Internet service providers buy into the process.  We will make the assumption that their actions arising from this are based on common sense.  We are lawmakers and I am a little concerned about this provision.  It could be taken advantage of to trawl too widely.  The memorandum of understanding may not have any bearing because, once the request is made, there is no recourse to law.  If an Internet service provider is met by a request for disclosure, the Internet service provider must adhere."
14963	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	61	 There is no sanction against the service provider for not adhering.  I take the subtlety of the point.  Ireland is a small country and if I am an Internet service provider and I am phoned by the local chief superintendent asking for certain information, I am hardly going to refuse.  If that person was of a mind to trawl the net widely and I found it technically difficult to come up with that information within a reasonable timeframe, that creates problems.
14964	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	63	 The Minister of State refers to the designated judge and the oversight judge.  One must consider the actions of that judge over the past number of years and consider whether that person had the resources to investigate the applications of the Act under which the judge operates.  Since the position was created in 1993, it can be argued that this consisted of no more than a single line every year stating that the operation of the Act has been kept under review and its provisions have been complied with.  There has been no discussion of the steps taken to keep the operation of the Act under review, whether individual files were reviewed, the volume of surveillance being carried out and whether mistakes were made in carrying out surveillance.  This concerns the report on the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, under which there is a designated judge.  I presume this provision has the same arrangements.  In principle, the oversight judge is a fantastic concept.  Whether the judge has the resources to carry out the provisions to which the Minister of State referred is a moot point.  I oppose this provision.
14965	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	65	 Can I interpret from this that the Minister of State will review it for Report Stage?
14966	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	69	 I accept the Minister of State's response.
14967	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	71	" I move amendment No. 14: In page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection: ""(4) A report under this section shall contain details of the numbers of prosecutions actually commenced as a result of investigations to which requests related, and a detailed justification for any significant excess of numbers of requests over numbers of prosecutions actually commenced."". The justification for this amendment is that it speaks to a qualitative provision we are trying to work into the legislation which would ensure justification for a request for disclosure to rule against the possibility of requests for disclosures for nefarious purposes.  We are trying to ensure that if an innocent person becomes the subject of a disclosure request that a numerical value is put on it in the sense of the quantity of requests made.  One can then examine the number of prosecutions and tally up the ratio of requests made to prosecutions.  We are trying to ensure a degree of transparency in the provisions under the section.  We are also seeking to offset the risk of somebody using the provision in the law for wrongful purposes"
14968	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	75	 I strain to understand the Minister of State's logic.  He spoke about vindicating individual rights but the amendment highlights a potentially gross disparity between numbers of requests and the ensuing prosecutions. He referred to reviews of the working of the directive.  We seek to protect the rights of individuals in respect of whom disclosure is requested.  Under the Bill as it stands, an individual can only find out if a disclosure request has been made by first making a request to the Data Protection Commissioner on the basis that he or she believes personal data has been accessed.  We seek to require that a report be prepared which contains details of the number of prosecutions commenced as a result of requests for information.  We want quantitative rather than qualitative assessments.  Such a provision would offset the risk of somebody in a position of power seeking disclosure for purposes other than the investigation of a criminal, revenue or secret service matter.  We are trying to balance the need for data against the rights of the individual.
14969	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	78	 I will consider withdrawing the amendment if I can be assured that we will further discuss the issues arising on Report Stage.  I accept the Minister of State's objections in good faith.  He acknowledges the aim of the amendment.
14970	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	89	" I move amendment No. 19: In page 8, subsection (5), line 29, after ""fit,"" to insert the following: ""and with due regard to the rights of any person whose life, bodily integrity or property was sought to be vindicated in the criminal investigation concerned,"". The purpose of the amendment is to ensure some balance in the question of how to deal with a minor breach of section 6.  If there is a breach, the user will be notified and may be compensated but if any prosecution is to be quashed as a result of destruction of the evidence on the orders of the Data Protection Commissioner, there must be consideration of the rights of the victim concerned.  This is a qualitative look at the legislation to ensure that it does not militate against people who are completely innocent and law-abiding citizens.  They should have some degree of recourse."
14971	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	 I have previously raised the next matter.  Considering the reports which have been published under those Acts, they have quite literally consisted of one or two lines stating that the provisions of the Act have been adhered to.  They have been signed by the relevant person.  The danger is that this will be a complaints procedure in name only and is not backed up by any real or substantive provisions. The Minister of State and I both know he is lessening the provision for an innocent person against whom a disclosure request is made, and decreasing his or her chance of recourse.  It is weak legislation; that is the point I am making.  I agree there must be data retention, as we all do, but the provisions allowing for recourse for somebody who is innocent are weak as water.
14972	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	" I move amendment No. 22: In page 9, line 45, after ""repealed"" to insert the following: ""and where any data retained or accessed thereunder are adduced in evidence after the passing of this Act, such data shall be deemed to have been lawfully retained or accessed at all material times notwithstanding such repeal"". In order to be off assistance I accept the Minister's amendment and am happy to withdraw mine, if that is in order."
14973	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	" I move amendment No. 24: In page 10, paragraph 4, line 10, to delete ""1995"" and substitute ""2005"". This corrects an error in the collective citation by including a reference to section 1(4) of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005."
14974	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	118	 I thank the Minister of State for his assistance in this.  It was not my intention to deliberately make life difficult for the Parliamentary Counsel but we believed the matter was significant.
