12867	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 The target is 85 per annum reaching approximately 100 per annum up to 2016 and beyond.  One cannot give a definitive figure because many variables enter into the fray, including intellectual property and commercialisation of research, but the most important point is that we are in a space where we are seeking to spin out as many companies as possible on an indigenous basis.  I believe the number for last year was 31.  One would hope to see that increasing but on the high potential start-ups, the target is 85 reaching a final target of approximately 100 per year from 2016.
12868	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 I had a meeting with Mr. Cunningham yesterday.  The budget line is important because the event, which will take place in mid-July next year, will attract researchers and persons within the scientific community at the highest level to our shores.  This is a pan-European win, so to speak.  The fact that we were able to win that competition against stiff competition from places like Vienna is a good testament to where we stand within that global scientific community. That win and this investment is vital in terms of our reputation because in enabling us to attract top level researchers we are sending out further signals into the research and science field.  That will result in added wins for us in the future.  We will gain from it by virtue of its profiling in the first instance.  The programme is comprehensive and intensive.  It will roll out across the State over the 12 months but will be focused primarily within those four or five days.  The fact that there will be industry involvement and all of the stakeholders involved over those four or five days will ensure we will be able to lay a further foundation or ramp it up, so to speak, to ensure we can make further gains in this field ultimately in terms of foreign direct investment.
12869	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 One way of looking at the overall picture it is to consider the level of FDI in 2003, for example.  In that year, the proportion of IDA client wins with a research and development component was approximately 10%, valued at €120 million.  In 2009-10, some 50% of FDI was research and development investment and it was valued at €500 million.  That is one important metric upon which we can work. If one considers the budget for Science Foundation Ireland, €15.3 million, and the collaboration involving over 500 companies on joint research initiatives, one will note the arrangement supports €73 billion in exports.  It is a valuable component but we need to consider further how many indigenous companies we can spin out.  We must consider whether there is a value to continuing with the investment in the centres of excellence and research clusters.  I believe there is because it maintains a vital FDI component because of the collaborations with industry.  One must take cognisance of the investment in basic research because, if we do not continue to invest in basic and applied research, we will not be able to achieve the spin-outs in the medium to longer term.  We need to ensure we get the balance right between the investment in basic and applied research, maintaining Science Foundation Ireland investment through the clusters and centres of excellence and trying to set metrics or targets. Progressing from basic research into the commercialisation field remains a challenge.  We must ask where it is best for the State to invest.  This conversation is taking place and will continue.
12870	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	 The hosting of the event will cost €6 million.  The Exchequer contribution over the period 2009 to 2012 is to be €2.973 million.  The funding provided for 2011 is based on the 2009 decision by the previous Government.  One will not know the wins until the event takes place; they cannot be projected.  We want to use the event as a showcase for Irish science and research across all the disciplines. Let us consider the next EU framework programme, which I am told should be called Horizon 2020 rather than Framework 8.  If we are involved in this programme in its early stages, we will be able to influence funding lines by virtue of the enhanced reputation we hope to gain as a result of the hosting the event, which will attract top researchers and scientists from across the world.  There will be a win for tourism in that 5,000 delegates will be brought to the Convention Centre Dublin.
12871	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	 There is potential for delegates to spend up to €4.8 million, according to one estimate, and to raise €1.1 million in taxation.  There is a win by virtue of holding the event itself but there will be a further medium-term gain because of the reputation enhancement.

The figure of €8.5 million includes a new programme of €2.5 million born from the enterprise platform programme which was transferred from Department of Education and Skills.  It is funded from current funds.  I can get Deputy O'Dea a more comprehensive explanation in writing.
12875	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	128	 A total of 20 companies and eight research groups won new contracts for 2010 amounting to €10 million.  There is a return on the investment.  I visited a company, SensL, in Cork recently, which is doing work in this space.  The subhead supports indigenous industries and start-ups.  One would have had a healthy scepticism about this.  I believe we are getting the return on the investments.

12885	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 Deputy Brian Hayes has covered the questions fairly comprehensively.  My first question is on subhead B2.  If the charge for the school transport scheme has increased from €75 to €300 per pupil, with a maximum of €650 per family, how much does the Department hope to yield?  Is the amount over and above the increase of €10.5 million which the Department seeks for costs associated with increasing demand? Is the Department seeking an increase under C4 for special needs assistants alone?  There are major problems for caretakers and secretaries with pension provision and I understand the Department of Finance dragged its feet on the issue as it waited for the latest social partnership agreement to be ratified.  Now that the agreement has been ratified, will any of this increase be used to solve some of those problems? My second question relates to the strategic innovation fund, subhead E5, and research and development, E13.  Is the Minister saying there has been a decline in applications for the strategic innovation fund?  He says an amount of €27 million is not required in 2008, mainly due to the slower than profiled progress on the part of institutions.  I do not know what that phrase means in layman's terms but I would guess the amount allocated was not taken up or is being stretched from 2008 into 2009.  The Minister might clarify that.
12886	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	 To what does the Minister attribute the significant year-on-year reductions in the average award?
12887	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	24	 Is that more aspirational than factual?  There has to be a reason for the decrease.  I do not mean to sound facetious.

12891	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	" I move amendment No. 1: In page 7, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following: "" ""relevant trust"" means a trust, which may include a company, a body corporate other than a company or an unincorporated body of persons, established for charitable purposes and- (a) which is or was engaged in the management, administration, operation, supervision or regulation of an institution specified in the Schedule to the Act of 2002, or (b) which is a person listed in the First Schedule to the Deed made on 5 June 2002 between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education and Science of the one part and the persons listed in the First Schedule to that deed of the other part;”. This amendment replaces the definition of ""relevant trust"" in the Bill with a more extensive one.  It is essentially a technical amendment to ensure all congregations that managed scheduled institutions fall within the scope of the Bill's provisions on the charitable status of their contributions to the statutory fund or generally towards the costs of redress.  The new definition provides for a relevant trust to include a trust which is or was involved in the management of scheduled institutions for the purposes of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 or a congregation that was party to the 2002 indemnity agreement.  The amendment is in response to concerns that a particular congregation may not have come within the original definition."
12892	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 Sections 42 and 29 will facilitate that process.  I have given the definition for it.
12893	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 Exactly.
12894	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 I beg the Chair's indulgence.  Before addressing the substantive issues involved, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, sends his apologies as he is unable to attend today's session.  In addition, I acknowledge on his behalf the presence in the Visitors Gallery of representatives of the survivor groups. I believe strongly the Minister has addressed the points made by Deputy Clare Daly on Second Stage.  The effect of these amendments would be to widen significantly eligibility for the fund.  Some suggest former residents who would be eligible for a reward from the redress board should be eligible, while it is unclear in other instances as to whether the proposal is to include all former residents, irrespective of whether they were abused in scheduled institutions.  Amendment No. 7 also proposes to include family members of former residents in the case of education services. One must recognise the Bill's primary purpose is to establish a statutory fund to support the needs of survivors in keeping with the all-party motion agreed unanimously by Dáil Éireann in the aftermath of publication of the Ryan report.  As Deputies are aware, a maximum of €110 million will be available to the fund to assist approximately 15,000 potential beneficiaries.  Were eligibility to be significantly widened to include, for example, all former residents of scheduled institutions as is being proposed, the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be reduced greatly and the effectiveness of the statutory fund put at risk.  Some of the amendments refer to former residents who were eligible to apply under the redress Act.  Anyone could apply to the redress board and more than 900 applications to the board were withdrawn, refused or resulted in no award, generally on the basis that the person concerned had not been resident in a scheduled institution. The Government has deliberately proposed confining entitlement to the 15,000 survivors who have come through the redress process.  Were the fund to investigate applications to establish residence and injury consistent with the alleged abuse, clearly a considerable bureaucracy similar to the Residential Institutions Redress Board would be required.  The statutory fund is neither intended nor designed to consider issues such as abuse.  Because it accepts applications only from those who received an award from the courts or the redress board, all issues related to abuse have been dealt with, thereby allowing the fund to focus on needs.  Extensive efforts were made to facilitate claims to the redress board and the former residents who did not apply to the board can continue to avail of the counselling and family tracing services available. The motivation for amendment No. 7 appears to be to allow the child of a former resident who received an award from the redress board benefit from the fund in so far as it relates to educational services.  I should point out that the receipt of a grant or assistance for educational services from the education finance board was not linked to the receipt of an award from the redress board.  Any former resident and his or her relatives, including children and grandchildren, could benefit.  Widening eligibility to include children and grandchildren would result in a broadening of the scope of the fund beyond that which is intended. While amendments Nos. 15 and 16, which we will address later, also deal with the issue, I wish to say at this point that it remains the Government's position that eligibility for the new fund should be confined to former residents.  The education finance board did excellent work in terms of distributing the moneys that came from the religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  Former residents and their relatives benefited from this support.  It was always clear that particular fund would run out and we are now almost at that point.  I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Deputies regarding the range of eligibility issues but I urge them to see the sense of the Government's position or the manner in which we are trying to operate on this matter. On individual issues that were raised by Deputies Ryan and Ó Ríordáin, the redress board ran a comprehensive advertising campaign.  It cost approximately €900,000, involving press, television and radio advertising over a two-week period in January and February 2003.  In addition, it held 12 information days throughout the UK in 2004 and distributed 15,000 leaflets to the network of Irish societies.  It also placed advertisements in UK newspapers and in Irish publications in the United States and Australia.  The board placed advertisements in Irish and UK newspapers highlighting each ministerial order which added institutions to the schedule of the redress Act.  It also advertised the closing date in 2005 in Irish and UK newspapers and in Irish publications in the United States and Australia.  Since its establishment, the board has placed a total of 1,492 advertisements. In speaking of the grouping of amendments, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, addressed the specific points made.  On Second Stage, he stated: [N]ot to have an open-ended, long, tortuous, bureaucratic quango come into existence, we have decided pragmatically, in the full knowledge of the decision we were making, that we would use the database of the 15,000 people who have already been given awards.  That is the database that is already there - we know what it is. To start again, given their age and given the period when the abuse took place, would have taken an enormous amount of time in terms of processing and verifying that information. The Minister has been clear on this.  We must go back to the fact that if it is opened up again, it is not possible to quantify the number of persons who would come forward again.  There are no definitive numbers in that sense.  In terms of expectations, if the eligibility criteria were opened up, one could take as a fair barometer the 940 applications which were not deemed eligible under the redress board applications. The best approach is that outlined by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on Second Stage, which is to proceed on the basis proposed in the Bill.  The question of reviewing eligibility can be considered after the fund is established in the event of there not being a significant expenditure of the fund.  There is some scope.  I must, therefore, oppose the amendments.
12895	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	24	" I will respond to Deputy Ryan's point first.  When I mentioned advertising and so forth, I did so to show that the State sought in good faith to reach out and advertise.  I take the Deputy's point, which he also made in good faith. An amendment requiring a review within a certain timeframe could be considered on Report Stage, but only following the fund's establishment.  At that time, the committee could deliberate with the Minister on how to proceed.  Some consideration should be given to an amendment along the lines proposed.  I will reflect this point of view to the Minister. Members should examine the amendments' wording.  Deputy Crowe's states ""eligible to apply"" and Deputy Smith's states ""eligible to receive"", but eligibility needs to be established.  If persons did not come forward during the first process, one would need to set up a bureaucratic mechanism to establish eligibility.  We are not in a position to do so.  In the Minister's opinion, an estimate of 15,000 people is the fairest way to deal with the matter.  He has been clear in this regard.  We do not know what the numbers are, as they range from a few people to a couple of hundred to a significant cohort, depending on whom one asks.  There comes a point when a line must be drawn.  I do not want to use emotive language and we must be mindful of the sensitivities involved, but the Minister stated his intentions on Second Stage clearly.  We will oppose the amendments."
12896	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	 With all due respect, I wish to establish a barometer in terms of how we proceed.  I will not be patronised and I want to deal with the Deputies respectfully, but we have an understanding of the issues at hand and we want to address them with a degree of sensitivity and respect.
12897	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	" I may have used the word ""bureaucracy"" but I am not sure I used the words ""massive bureaucracy"".  If I did, it was not to imply that a whole machine would have to be created around this.  The central point is that the fund is €110 million in respect of which 15,000 have already made an application.  Some 940 people were deemed ineligible under the redress process because they were not residents of the scheduled institutions. On the legal advice issue, legal advice was taken up by 97% of those who applied under the original scheme.  That advice was independent legal advice which the people sought.  I am not suggesting that those people did not have an entitlement to that legal advice, I am merely stressing it was independent legal advice sought by them.  People had a degree of autonomy and discretion in terms of whom they chose as their legal advisers.  It was important that was inherent in the original scheme. On eligibility to apply, the bureaucratic aspect arises from the fact that we would again now have to establish where the injury took place, which re-opens the whole process.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has made clear his position in regard to the proposed amendments."
12898	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	 Clearly an annual reporting and review mechanism could be established once the fund is established.  It is reasonable to ask for the committee to have due regard to the workings of the fund or review the process.  We should all adopt an open mind on how it is structured.  When the Minister addresses Report and Final Stages there should be some response to the suggestions made on the fund, its uses, and where spare, if any, resources are deployed.  At this stage of the process, and not to be too specific, I acknowledge that the issue was raised, that the Minister will attend for the next stage and that members have asked that he have regard to the concerns that they raised.
12899	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	 Yes, there is potential for an oversight role.  I feel strongly that I should not make a definitive statement on it at this stage.  The Minister will have regard to the process and, effectively, with due deference to his role as the Minister for Education and Skills who sits at Cabinet, then we should give consideration to the role, and there should be a response to the suggestions.  The fund's  modus operandi should be determined by the Minister.
12900	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 There will be an annual report that should give rise to a process in terms of how it is parsed, examined or interpreted.
12901	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 Counselling services are specifically provided for in section 8 of the Bill as a class of approved service.  I am uncertain as to the intent behind some of the proposed amendments.  While I appreciate the concerns that a former resident's existing counsellor be retained once the fund is established, I do not see how that position would be threatened simply because the fund is established.  People can continue to attend their existing counsellor, which may be funded under the National Counselling Service, without recourse to the fund.  If individuals are privately attending counsellors and wish to apply to the fund to have this service funded, the person could advise the fund of this preference in their application.  Once the counsellor meets the criteria for service providers specified by the fund, it is difficult to envisage why the fund would not agree to such an arrangement.  I have no doubt that issues such as these are a concern to individual former residents, but they are matters of detail that should be left to the fund, which is required to act in the interests of the former residents.  In other words, what is inherent in the legislation is the interests of former residents and the fund, by its nature and the spirit in which it is set up, is to look after the needs of people in terms of counselling services. The proposal in amendment No. 10 that a one-off payment be made from the fund is not acceptable given that there is no apparent linkage with the needs of a former resident.  The purpose of the fund is not, and never was, a form of additional compensation.  That issue has been dealt with by the redress board.  It is, as advocated in the original motion passed by the House, intended for the support of victims.  Eligible former residents will have a range of needs, with some likely to require more significant interventions than others, and the approach set out in the Bill is intended to support these needs.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments.
12902	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	61	 I would like to open this up a little because it is worthy of discussion.  We agree counselling is a statutory entitlement provided by the National Counselling Service.  If it is a statutory entitlement, I do not see the need for this amendment, and I say that respectfully because there is a class of approved services in section 8.  I do not dispute the points made by the Deputies and I understand the spirit in which the amendments were tabled.  My instinct is perhaps to look at this on Report Stage but clarity around the purpose of the amendments is needed.  I understand the points made in regard to fears people have about autonomy and so on.  Is there an inherent fear that somehow the services will be reduced or withdrawn at some future date?  If that is the case, perhaps this can be revisited at a later stage and further clarification can be provided by the Minister.
12903	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	 I would like to ensure Deputy Crowe, or any Deputy, has access at all times to the officials in the Department.  If Deputy Crowe wishes to discuss that specific issue with the officials, there is no problem.
12904	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 The purpose of the amendment is to require the board to make information available in regard to its functions to all applicants to the redress board.  As the Deputy will be aware, more than 900 applications to the redress board were withdrawn, refused or resulted in no award generally on the grounds that they were not resident in scheduled institutions as defined in the Act.  I do not believe the amendment is required.  There is no need to contact the 900 plus persons to whom I referred as they will not be eligible to benefit from the fund.  Furthermore, there is no mechanism for doing so due to the confidentiality restrictions of the redress process.  The intention of the scheme is to oblige the board to make information available on its functions to former residents.  I respectfully argue that the amendment is not necessary and, therefore, I cannot accept it.
12905	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	69	 I will respond to the amendment first and will then maybe engage further with Deputy Crowe on it.  The amendment proposed would require the board to correspond with all applicants who applied to the redress board, even those who did not receive an award.  As I said in regard to the previous amendment, it is not permissible to contact individual recipients of redress board awards due to the confidentiality provisions of the 2002 Act. The Bill empowers the redress board to provide awardees' names, addresses and dates of birth to the statutory fund which will enable the fund to verify applicants' entitlements to apply.  That is the only purpose for which the information can be used.  The Attorney General's office has advised that any direct unsolicited communication with survivors could be open to a challenge as it might encroach on their right to privacy under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The redress board process was strictly confidential with the unauthorised disclosure of information being a criminal offence under the 2002 Residential Institutions Redress Act. Apart from the strict legal issues, the Deputy will also be aware that issues relating to abuse are extremely sensitive and the sending of unsolicited letters to persons' private addresses could pose difficulties.  As was noted on Second Stage, some survivors have still not told their partners what they experienced in childhood.  I cannot accept the amendment.
12906	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	71	 I acknowledge the point Deputy Crowe made and the spirit in which the amendment was tabled.  I utterly agree with the sincerity of the amendment.
12907	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	76	 I accept the points made by Deputy Crowe and his desire to ensure we learn from the mistakes of the past and provide for a degree of probity in this matter.  The amendment appears to require the board to engage consultants only by way of fixed-term contracts and provides for an annual review mechanism involving the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While I appreciate that the objective behind the amendment may be to restrict in some way the use of consultants, a legislative approach is not appropriate for such a matter.  The amendment appears to assume that consultants and legal advisers will be appointed on a regular basis.  It is not clear on what basis this assumption is made.  It is the Government's intention that the use of such external advisers be kept to a minimum, while enabling the board to fulfil its mandate.  The use of fixed-term contracts may not be the most appropriate or cost-effective way to bring in such expertise.  The board should be given flexibility to choose the most appropriate way of dealing with the issues, subject to overall public service guidelines in these matters.  The board will require ministerial approval to enter into contracts or engage consultants.  I believe this is sufficient oversight of the arrangements.
12908	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	78	 Section 7(3) states: In performing any functions conferred on it by or under this Act, the Board shall have regard to the existence of publicly available services and the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of the resources available in the investment account. We would argue that the subsection would sufficiently cover the spirit of the points raised by Deputy Crowe.  I see where the Deputy is coming from.  Perhaps there could be further consultation with the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, if the amendment was withdrawn, on how the matter could be clarified to ensure the Deputy's concerns are addressed.
12909	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	81	 I refer Members to section 10(1) in respect of directions of the Minister, which states: The Minister may, in relation to the performance by the Board of its functions, give a direction in writing to the Board requiring it to comply with such policies of the Government as are specified in the direction. The power of the Minister is clear in terms of giving the direction but in keeping with the concerns raised by the Deputies, this is a matter that could be discussed at a later stage.
12910	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	87	 We discussed this issue during the debate on amendment No. 7.  The effect of these amendments would be to extend eligibility for the fund to the children and grandchildren of former residents in so far as educational services are concerned.  They would also include employment opportunities.  I am aware that the Education Finance Board provided significant supports both to former residents and their relatives and the Deputies will be aware that the €12.7 million fund set aside for educational purposes under the 2002 indemnity agreement is now virtually exhausted.  Through this Bill, the Government is now focusing on meeting the needs of former residents across a range of service areas, having regard to the available moneys and the potential numbers eligible to apply.  I believe that to do this effectively, it must confine itself to the eligible former residents.  On that basis I cannot accept the amendment. There is not unanimity across groups representing survivors on this particular issue.  The fund is €110 million and there are 15,000 potential beneficiaries, but there is also the student grants scheme which has income thresholds, and 41% of full-time undergraduate higher education students are in receipt of such grants.  Therefore, there are statutory schemes in place already with clear income thresholds for which the children and grandchildren of the former residents are eligible.  I would again like to restate that a review of eligibility under the fund is possible if the demands are not significant.  That is where the review element of this comes in and the Minister for Education and Skills will respond to it at a further stage. We are saying that we cannot accept the amendment, but there could be further discussion of this at a later stage.  However, I think the Minister was clear about this on Second Stage.
12911	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	89	 Can the Deputy clarify the 2.8% figure?
12912	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	91	 How do we know that?  The confidentiality arrangements inherent within the initial redress scheme-----
12913	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	93	 Was it the-----
12914	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	95	 I am not disputing it, but I would like to seek clarification on that.  If there is a withdrawal of the amendments at this juncture-----
12915	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 There could be further discussion without prejudice to see if the Minister could take it on board at a later stage.  It is important to remember that the €12.7 million fund set aside for educational purposes is virtually exhausted, and this must be borne in mind for this process.
12916	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	100	 We have spoken about the issue.  We have been very specific about the €12.7 million fund and the fact that there was a significant fund available for educational attainment through the Education Finance Board.  In fairness, the State had given a clear commitment on that so the State's response is measured in that sense.  However, there is scope to have further discussion on the issues raised in amendments Nos. 7, 15 and 16 and the Minister will give a clear direction on them at a later stage.
12917	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	108	 I speak to the spirit of everything that has been said today.  No one with a shred of humanity in his heart would disagree or fail to empathise with what is being said but I must be clear about the scope of the Bill.  It goes beyond its scope to introduce a statutory entitlement.  Nevertheless I take in good faith the arguments made. These amendments have been disallowed.  However, on Report Stage there should be a conversation on meeting the physical needs, including housing and shelter of persons who find themselves in this morass.  Liaising mechanisms have been set up and are available try to assist people with these physical needs.  These are already inherent and available under various other pillars.  For the purposes of this legislation there is no plan to introduce a statutory entitlement.  The amendments have been disallowed but given the progress of the legislation it should give rise to a further discussion on Report Stage.  That is the best we can do at this stage.
12918	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	110	 Deputy Daly proposes the deletion of section 8(4) in its entirety.  The subsection is an important provision, however, in that it gives the board the flexibility to determine different classes.  These are classes not in a class sense as we understand it but in terms of trying to define a range of subjects, services, people or former residents.  It provides the board with flexibility, therefore, in terms of the determination of services.  For example, it could set different entitlements depending on the age of former residents.  It is not intended to be restrictive or exclusive; the opposite is the case.  It is designed to give the board the flexibility it needs to meet the wide range of needs of former residents.  I am rather concerned at the proposal to delete the wording set out in the Bill and I oppose the amendment on that basis.  Language is all important in this process.  Ultimately, this section serves to ensure that a flexibility is available.  It is like referring to a class of car.  It speaks to the range of services and there should be some flexibility inherent in it.  The word is used from a legislative point of view.
12919	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	113	" With respect to the Deputy, I suggest the word ""type"" is worse because a ""type"" of former resident could be deemed in certain circumstances to be interpreted as pejorative as well.  Let us normalise the word ""class"" here and now: it is a normal word.  There is no subjective nature to it.  The spirit of the word ""class"" in this sense is to ensure there is flexibility around the range of services that can be provided.  I am unsure whether another word could be used.  ""Class"" is a rather innocuous word and no offence is intended by it.  For the purposes of designing the legislation it gives flexibility in terms of the determination of services."
12920	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	115	" It is important to nail this down so that there is no misinterpretation.  Let us suppose we were discussing social protection legislation for the over 70s.  That segment of the population would be classed as the over 70s.  It is a class of the population.  With all due respect, one must class subsections when dealing with legislation.  The aim in this instance is to ensure flexibility in the determination of services.  If the services are being defined, there has to be a class of services or categories.  There is nothing pejorative or demeaning in the use of the word ""class"" in this instance.  It does not seek to stigmatise anyone in any way; that is not the intent in the use of the word."
12921	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	117	 The effect of the amendment would be to preclude the board from including in its criteria a provision that would require it to take into consideration the financial circumstances of an applicant.  The purpose of the fund is to allow it to target the needs of former residents.  By removing the power of the board to include financial circumstances in its criteria potentially it would allow a former resident with extensive means to apply to the board and receive supports and services on the same basis as a less wealthy individual, whereas the objective is to meet the needs of those most in need. I emphasise that this provision is not intended to introduce a general means test application to the fund.  It will be a matter for the fund to have regard to the need to take account of an individual's financial circumstances when determining its criteria for its decisions.  This provision is most assuredly not intended as a way of preventing vulnerable persons in need from benefiting from the supports that will be available under the fund.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.
12922	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 Section 14(9) allows the board to designate a staff member to perform the functions of the chief executive officer in the event of that officer being absence or the position being vacant.  This is a reasonable provision and while such situations may be rare, they may occur from time to time.  The amendment would have the effect of preventing any member of staff, including one designated by the board under section 14 to perform the functions of the chief executive officer, from giving evidence before a committee of Dáil Éireann. I find the proposal a little strange and I am unclear why an acting chief executive officer could not come before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions on various issues.  The Deputy is suggesting that if the Committee of Public Accounts wishes to examine issues relating to the books and accounts of the fund, it should be precluded from calling the senior staff member of the fund to appear before it.  I am unclear why the fund should be treated differently from other public bodies.  We are all committed to ensuring full accountability and I am not sure the amendment would sustain that level of accountability.
12923	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	126	 I acknowledge the points that have been made.  One might interpret the amendment as making a certain point about the power of the Oireachtas in terms of summoning witnesses before it.  I refer here to the spirit as opposed to the letter of the law.  The reality, however, is that there is no precedent, in so far as I am aware, where a chief executive officer of a statutory body or fund has failed to appear before the Oireachtas on being summoned.  It is pertinent and proper to ensure that the board can designate its staff to perform the functions of the chief executive officer in the event of the latter's absence or the position being vacant.  That is common sense.
12924	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	129	 The board could likewise decide to take that action.  The key point here is that we should not undermine our own role as legislators in terms of the ability to summon people before us, as per Deputy Smith's point.  I acknowledge the argument he has made in that sense.
12925	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	131	 I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances, a cap of €5,000 per annum on the remuneration, allowance and expenses of the staff of the board would be punitive.  I do not know whether the Deputy has included the amendment under this section in error.  Subsection (4) states: The members of the board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, hold office on such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to the payment of allowances for expenses) as may be determined by the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. There is no provision in the Bill for remuneration of board members.
12926	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	133	 To clarify, they will be entitled only to expenses.  It is a non-remunerated board.
12927	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	135	 Deputy Crowe's amendment relates to section 17, the provisions of which relate to the staff of the board.  There is a distinction between persons employed as administrators and those who are members of the board.
12928	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	141	 What is proposed here might not be deemed to be a charge on the Exchequer for the purposes of considering the amendment but it would be hugely costly to undertake large print runs of the report in order to furnish copies to every public library across the State.  It is the norm in this day and age that annual reports and other public documents are published electronically and accessed online.  The amendment also places a requirement on the board that the placement of the reports in public libraries be advertised in local and national newspapers.  That potential cost alone obliges me to reject the amendment.  There are sufficient ways of bringing reports of this nature into the public domain.  The cost of disseminating them to local libraries and advertising same would be utterly prohibitive.  The question arises as to who would fund that cost and how it would be determined.
12929	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	143	 I assure members that I acknowledge the spirit of the proposals they have brought forward.
12930	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	145	 I appreciate that Deputy Crowe is endeavouring to ensure that any payments made to former residents will not affect their social welfare entitlements in this jurisdiction or outside the State.  I am sympathetic to the general principle involved.  However, I do not believe that this legislation is the appropriate vehicle to address the concerns raised.  The board would not be in a position to ensure an outcome such as that intended.  An amendment to the social welfare regulations would, if deemed necessary, be more appropriate.  This issue could certainly be pursued in the event that difficulties emerge down the line.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Oireachtas cannot legislate in respect of the affairs of other jurisdictions.  A provision such as that being proposed is unenforceable.  I cannot accept the amendment on that basis.
12931	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	147	 Let us keep in mind the purpose of the Bill, namely, to provide services in the first instance.  If the Deputy is suggesting that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection should liaise further in respect of the issues he has outlined, I am of the view that this should be done prior to Report Stage.  If the Deputy so wishes, we can engage in such an exercise.
12932	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	149	 If it relates to matters outside the jurisdiction, then it would be unenforceable.
12933	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	152	 Again, let us keep in mind that the fund is designed to assist and be proactive in terms of meeting people's needs.  It is not meant to place a block in the way of applications.  The amendment seeks to delete section 20(4)(b), the provisions contained in which are reasonable in the context of assisting the board in considering applications.  It is not unreasonable for the board to seek certain basic information or consents from applicants.  It must be borne in mind that this information will be sought for the purposes of assisting in the consideration of applications.  If an applicant fails to provide information, it would be reasonable for the board to refuse to consider the matter further until such information is provided.  It is on this basis that we cannot accept the amendment.
12934	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	154	 If the Deputy is seeking to soften the language used or the approach being taken, I can appreciate what she is trying to do.  Again, however, we must have regard to the fact that the fund is designed to assist people in a positive fashion.  One cannot then be prescriptive or set out schedules as to how people in varying circumstances should be dealt with.  That may not be what the Deputy was driving at but she can clarify the position when she responds.  I accept that there are sensitivities involved but we must create a scenario whereby employees of the fund who are dealing with requests for funding or a service will be allowed to gather any information which may be required.  It is also necessary to put in place structures to deal with instances where requests for such information are refused, namely, an application will not proceed unless the required information is furnished.  I am of the opinion that this is reasonable because, by its very nature, the fund is designed to assist people.
12935	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	156	 I am going to stick to my guns on this one on the basis that this is enabling legislation.  To use the example of medical circumstances where assistance is being provided in that respect, one must have regard to an individual's medical circumstances.  If one does not have the information, one cannot make a determination and proceed any further with an application.  Once the fund is set up, one must have a mechanism to provide structures to allow the board to refuse to consider an applicant if the person is remiss in not yielding certain information.  There must be a degree of co-operation, otherwise the process becomes intractable.  One could have a body of cases awaiting a determination that could drag on for years.  We need to be able to expedite every case efficiently to ensure that those who will become clients of the service want to ensure there is an efficiency built into the service in order that it runs smoothly and in their favour. I do not believe there is anything wrong with what is being suggested in subsection 4(b).  It states, “enabling the Board to refuse to further consider the application if the request under paragraph (a) is not complied with and the Board may so request or refuse to further consider the application in accordance with the procedures”.  Any public servant I know of who deals on a front-of-house basis with individuals or fellow citizens will seek to assist a person along but if the person does not co-operate or stonewalls in terms of providing particular information, there comes a time when one must make a call on it, and this provision allows for that.  One must reflect on the spirit of the legislation.  The Bill is designed to try to assist people.  By its very nature it is set up to assist and enable people to gain assess to the services.
12936	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	161	 No, not at this stage.
12937	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	164	" I would point out that section 23 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of information and provides for it to be a criminal offence.  Disclosure is not unauthorised in specific circumstances such as to the Garda Síochána, child protection services, etc. Section 24 provides that ""personal information"", defined as being the name, address and date of birth of an applicant, can be furnished by the Residential Institutions Redress Board to the board of the statutory fund.  It further provides that this information can only be used to determine whether a person is eligible to make an application to the board and for no other purpose. Amendment No. 31 would make it a requirement that the applicant providing the information would be informed while amendment No. 32 would prohibit disclosure of information to third parties.  I fail to see that either of these amendments are necessary or that they add to the Bill.  I do not see that there is anything to be gained by informing an applicant that information is being disclosed and perhaps there is much to be lost, particularly if sensitive information needs to be brought to the attention of the statutory authorities urgently.  Given that the provisions of section 24 are already restrictive, the amendment is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept either amendment."
12938	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	166	 I will get an explanation for the Deputy and we can revert to her.  Section 24 provides that personal information defined as being the name, address and date of birth of an applicant can be furnished by the Residential Institutions Redress Board to the board of the statutory fund, namely, the fund in question.  It further provides that the information can only be used to determine whether a person is eligible to make an application to the board and for no other purpose.  Amendment No. 31 would make it a requirement that the applicant providing the information would be informed but that it would prohibit the disclosure of information to third parties.  I do not see how that is necessary for the purposes of determining the Bill. In section 23, on page 21 of Bill, confidential information means information that refers to a former resident or that could reasonably lead to the identification of a former resident.  In terms of disclosure issues, we seek to introduce a belt and braces approach to how information is dealt with to ensure that the privacy of individuals is utterly sacrosanct.  That is already inherent within the sections as laid out in the Bill.
12939	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	168	 That is it.
12940	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	170	 The amendment to section 31 proposes that no disclosure shall be made prior to informing the applicant.  I suggest that one must think carefully about how one would communicate that, to whom and to which house it would go.  One must still have a degree of security around ensuring that no third party could potentially have access to the information if, for example, a person changes address.  One must be careful to ensure one does not compromise the confidentiality that exists.
12941	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	172	 Again, if the Deputy looks at section 23(3) on page 22, a person does not contravene section 23(3) by disclosing confidential information if the disclosure is made to or authorised by the board or is made to the Garda Síochána where the person is acting in good faith and reasonably believes that such disclosure is necessary in order to prevent an act or omission constituting a serious offence, or is made to an appropriate person within the meaning of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, where the person is acting in good faith and reasonably believes that such disclosure is necessary to prevent, reduce or remove a substantial risk to life, or to prevent the continuance of abuse of a child.  Section 23(2)(d) and (e) are also relevant.  We feel strongly that the legislation is sufficient in terms of the disclosure of information as per Deputy Daly’s amendment No. 32, but in terms of amendment No. 31, by virtue of section 23(3) it is set out how one must be careful about how one communicates.
12942	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	179	 Nobody would disagree with the Deputy.  There is no question that we all share that sentiment.  I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment.  I cannot accept the amendment because under the terms of the indemnity agreement reached with the religious congregations and the then Government on 5 June 2002, the congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the redress scheme.  The contribution comprised cash, the provision of counselling services and the transfer of properties.  The full amount of the cash contribution has been received.  The congregations have met their contribution in terms of the provision of counselling services.  Property transfers valued at €41.37 million, that is 41 properties, have been fully completed and there are 20 remaining properties which have not been fully and finally accepted by the Department. The congregations had agreed to transfer these properties under the indemnity agreement subject to good and marketable title being furnished.  All of these properties are in use or available for use by the intended recipients.  Nevertheless, the Chief State Solicitor's office continues to pursue the legal requirements issue under the indemnity agreement.  Regular meetings are continuing involving our Department, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office to finalise the transfer process under the terms of the indemnity agreement.  In the event of a shortfall regarding the value of the properties offered and that provided under the agreement, the shortfall could be made up by the relevant congregation providing alternative properties.  In any event, the agreement provides for the full amount of €128 million to be recovered, whether received in property or in cash form. While one cannot put a timeframe on completion due to the complex nature of the remaining transfers, I can assure the committee, as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has assured it, that every effort is being made to complete the process as expeditiously as possible.
12943	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	181	 The section as drafted allows for the interest accrued on the €21.05 million held on deposit in the Central Bank to be paid to the fund.  The cap of €110 million in subsection (4) only refers to the contributions paid under subsection (1)(a) or expected under subsection (2)(a).  Any associated interest can be paid into the fund and is dealt with in subsections (1)(b) and (2)(b).  Deputy Daly’s proposed amendment, therefore, is unnecessary and I oppose it.  However, Deputy Daly may wish to withdraw the amendment in light of the explanation. I can advise the committee in this general context that interest of almost €250,000 has been earned on the contributions lodged to the Central Bank to date.  The congregations made their contribution offers in late 2009, and some agreed to pay their cash contributions due in the short term in interest bearing accounts pending the establishment of the fund.  The section allows for that interest to be contributed to the Minister outside the €110,000 cap. I wish to signal our intention to bring forward a further technical amendment to this section to address some of the charities' concerns that their payments to the fund are consistent with charity law obligations.  Officials are continuing to liaise with the congregations' legal advisers and the Attorney General's office in this regard, and it will be necessary to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to address those concerns.
12944	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	" I move amendment No. 36: In page 24, lines 38 to 44, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following: ""(5) Moneys in the investment account that are not required for the purposes of section 30 shall be invested by the Agency and any income, capital or other benefit received in respect of moneys invested under this subsection shall be paid into the investment account or invested under this subsection.”. Section 29 provides that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will establish an investment account for the fund.  This technical amendment provides the agency with greater flexibility in regard to investment decisions.  Moneys standing to the credit of the fund are likely to be invested by the NTMA over a range of maturities depending on the fund's view of the likely schedule of draw-downs from the fund.  This technical amendment ensures that the NTMA has discretion to roll over investments and vary the maturities of investments without having to seek the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in each case."
12945	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	185	" The amendment will not have any material effect because if the words ""and other costs"" are deleted it will not materially affect the provision.  The definition of an ""expense"" in the Oxford English Dictionary refers to a cost incurring.  We could consider agreeing to an amendment on Report Stage as it would have no material effect.  Perhaps Deputy Daly will consider that matter and we can have a further discussion."
12946	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	187	 We can.  Can we consider it on Report Stage?  The wording of the amendment does not change the legislation substantially.
12947	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	189	" If I agree with the sentiments the Deputy is expressing, the amendment will still have no bearing.  It is a technical amendment.  The phrase  ""and other costs"" does not necessarily speak in terms of the amendment, bearing in mind the aspirations of the Deputy regarding the expenditure of public resources and remuneration."
12948	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	191	" If we are to legislate expeditiously, it must be stated that the phrase ""and other costs"" will not materially affect the provision.  That is the ultimate point, regardless of the semantics of the argument.  The Government is willing to re-consider this on Report Stage."
12949	SeanSherlock	Labour	14449.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	193	" I move amendment No. 38: In page 31, subsection (7), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following: "" ""terms"" in relation to a relevant trust means terms whether or not in writing;"". This is a technical amendment to ensure the reference to the terms of a trust in subsections (1) and (3) includes both written and unwritten terms.  The section is designed to facilitate the charities that ran the scheduled institutions in making contributions, be it in cash or via property, towards the costs of redress generally or specifically towards the cost of the statutory fund.  It provides that such contributions are charitable gifts and enables the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to approve of property sales, mortgages and transfers within the context of the charities making such contributions.  We intend to table a further technical amendment to the section to address some of the charities' concerns that their contributions are consistent with charity law obligations.  Officials are continuing to liaise with the congregations' legal advisers and the Office of the Attorney General in this regard.  It will be necessary to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to address these concerns."

13011	SeanSherlock	Labour	18074.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-01 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	36	 I move amendment No. 22: In page 31, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following: “Rights in relation to diagnosis, maintenance and repair of electronic equipment 26. (1) In relation to digital electronic equipment sold in the State, a manufacturer shall make available, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment— (a) to independent repair providers, and (b) to owners of the equipment, in a timely manner and on fair and reasonable terms, relevant documents, parts and tools, including any updates to information or embedded software. (2) Where a manufacturer has made an express warranty with respect to digital electronic equipment and the wholesale price of the equipment is €100 or more, the manufacturer shall provide such parts, tools, and documents as to enable the repair of the equipment during the warranty period at an equitable price, with due regard to— (a) the actual cost to the manufacturer of preparing and distributing the parts, tools or documents, exclusive of any research and development costs incurred, (b) the ability of owners and independent repair providers to afford the parts, tools or documents, and (c) the means by which the parts, tools or documents are distributed. (3) In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment. (4) Both an owner and an independent repair provider may maintain an action against a manufacturer who contravenes subsections (1), (2) or (3), and the court may order the manufacturer to take such action as may be necessary to observe the requirements of the subsection concerned, or to pay damages. (5) (a) Nothing in this section requires a manufacturer to disclose a trade secret, save as and to the extent necessary to provide documents, parts and tools on fair and reasonable terms. (b) Subject to paragraph (c), nothing in this section alters the terms of any agreement between a manufacturer and an authorised repair provider. (c) A provision of an agreement referred to in paragraph (b), or any other agreement, is void insofar as it purports to waive, avoid, restrict or limit a manufacturer’s obligations under this section. (6) In this section— “authorised repair provider”, in relation to a manufacturer, means a person who is not a connected person and who has an agreement with the manufacturer— (a) pursuant to a license to use a trade name, service mark or other proprietary identifier, to offer the services of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of digital electronic equipment under the name of the manufacturer, or (b) otherwise to provide such services on behalf of the manufacturer, provided that a manufacturer who offers the services of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of digital electronic equipment manufactured by it or on its behalf, and who does not have an agreement with a connected person for the provision of such services, is an authorised repair provider with respect to that equipment; “connected person” has the meaning assigned to it by section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; “digital electronic equipment”— (a) subject to paragraph (b), means any product that depends for its functioning, in whole or in part, on digital electronics embedded in or attached to the product, (b) does not include— (i) mechanically propelled vehicles designed and constructed to be suitable for use on roads, or (ii) medical devices within the meaning of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; “document” includes any manual, diagram, reporting output, service code description, schematic, or other guidance or other information used in effecting the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment; “embedded software” means any programmable instructions provided on firmware delivered with digital electronic equipment, or with a part for such equipment, for the purposes of operating the equipment, including all relevant patches and fixes made by the manufacturer of such equipment or part for this purpose; “firmware” means a software program or set of instructions programmed on digital electronic equipment, or on a part for such equipment, to allow the equipment or part to communicate within itself or with other computer hardware; “independent repair provider”, means a person who— (a) in relation to a manufacturer and any authorised repair provider of the manufacturer, is not a connected person, and (b) is engaged in the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment, provided that a manufacturer or an authorised provider of a manufacturer is, when engaged in the diagnosis, service, maintenance or repair of digital equipment that is not manufactured by or sold under the name of the manufacturer, an independent repair provider; “manufacturer” means a person engaged in the business of selling, leasing, or otherwise supplying new digital electronic equipment, or parts of such equipment, that has been made by or on behalf of the manufacturer; “owner” means a person who owns or leases digital electronic equipment; “part” means any replacement part, whether new or used, made available by a manufacturer for purposes of maintenance or repair of digital electronic equipment manufactured by or on behalf of, sold or otherwise supplied by the manufacturer; “tools” includes any software program, hardware implement or other apparatus used for diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment, including software or other mechanisms that provision, program or pair a new part, calibrate functionality, or perform any other function required to bring the equipment back to fully functional condition. (7) A reference in this section to making a document or thing available on fair and reasonable terms means making the document or thing available on terms that are equivalent to the most favourable terms under which a manufacturer makes the document or thing available to an authorised repair provider— (a) regard being had to any discount, rebate, convenient means of delivery, means of enabling fully restored and updated functionality, rights of use, or other incentive or preference the manufacturer offers to an authorised repair provider, or any additional cost, burden, or impediment the manufacturer imposes on an independent repair provider, and (b) not conditioned on or imposing a substantial obligation or restriction that is not reasonably necessary for enabling the owner or independent repair provider to engage in the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment made by or on behalf of the manufacturer.”. This amendment is grounded in the right to repair movement. We are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. One need only visit a local civic amenity site on a Saturday morning to see piles of electronic waste or look at the number of mobile phones that we all have lying in drawers at home and that are beyond use. The amendment is grounded in the idea that we protect the right to repair and ensure that we are part of the movement that fights back against the idea that global companies can build planned obsolescence into products. By passing this amendment, we will fight back against the idea that we should be sold products by some of the world's largest companies knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years. Having built in that obsolescence, we as consumers should have the right to repair the same products. I am speaking specifically about smartphones and tablets, but we are also seeing it now in Kindles, coffee machines, large household appliances and the whole panoply of products that are sold to consumers. The Minister of State will tell us that we should not be moving ahead of prospective EU legislation but, by accepting the amendment, there is an opportunity for him to be radical and for Ireland to become a leader in ensuring that we as consumers build in the right to repair the products sold to us as we see fit, that consumers are not penalised and that the same conglomerates do not go after entities that repurpose or refurbish iPhones or, to keep this generic, smartphones. My amendment will not be accepted, so I am anticipating that I will be revisiting this matter on Report Stage. In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I will not be pressing the amendment, but I wish to keep it on the agenda. We need to ensure that we fight back. I am sick of the fact that if I purchase an iPhone, the software architecture of which allows the hardware to work with the Houses of the Oireachtas, email, WhatsApp and all of the other software that we need to survive in the modern world, that piece of kit will last less than five years or, if I am lucky, five years. Processes and the software start slowing down after two years and the battery cannot be replaced. There is no means by which someone can continue using the product for which he or she has shelled out considerable amounts of money. People are sick of the fact that they are sitting on a mountain of this electronic detritus. They are sick of the fact that phones are locked or bricked, to use that term. They want to buy products that are recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer, and that is essentially what this amendment, as long winded and all as it is, is about. I see no reason to say anything else. I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say on my amendment.
13012	SeanSherlock	Labour	18074.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-01 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	39	" I sometimes feel – I would have been accused of this in the past as a Minister of State – that we are perhaps hiding behind EU rules. However, I think there is an opportunity within the amendment not to fall foul of EU rules, because we are merely giving an additional right to the consumer to have that which they have purchased in good faith to be repaired. The amendment describes a particular element. It reads: ""In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment."" I do not see how that is injurious to the rights of the manufacturer in terms of fair competition rules from an EU point of view or maximum harmonisation rules. Again, I know the Minister of State is frankly not of a mind to accept the amendment. If I understand the Minister of State correctly, he is sympathetic to what the amendment seeks to do. However, at a time when we are talking about the circular economy - there is legislation before us on that very issue - I think people are just absolutely fed up with the idea of built-in obsolescence. I think we have crossed the Rubicon of people’s patience around it. This amendment, in its own small way, seeks to push back against this rampant consumerism. The Minister of State said he will repair and fix shoe leather and I am of a similar mind. There is a strong movement around people not necessarily wanting the best, new or shiniest, but wanting to repair, reuse and recycle. Longevity is a key thing now in terms of products that we purchase. I will withdraw the amendment. However, I seek to submit it again or have it revisited on Report Stage."
13013	SeanSherlock	Labour	18074.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-01 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	129	 I move amendment No. 107: In page 103, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following: “(4) (a) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, where a trader supplies a service to subscribers, it is an unfair term of the contract under which the service is provided if the trader, in relation to provision of the same or substantially the same service, charges consumers who are renewing their subscription a higher fee than the trader charges consumers who are new subscribers. (b) In paragraph (a) “subscriber” means a consumer who receives a service from a trader pursuant to a contract where, on payment of a periodic fee, the contract with the trader under which the service is supplied is successively renewed or rolled over, whether the fee is calculated solely by reference to a period of time or by reference to the amount of service received during that period, or by a combination of both; and “subscription” shall be construed accordingly.”. The essence of this amendment is that it is a ban on penalising loyal customers more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers. It goes back to the theme of the previous amendment, which basically buttresses the rights of consumers, which is what the legislation is about. We have seen in the past, however, the practice whereby customers of long standing find themselves at a price disadvantage relative to new customers where one seeks to attract new customers to a service, whether a digital service, an online service or whatever else that service may be. From a consumer rights point of view, it is a matter of ensuring, as I said, that loyal customers are not penalised more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers.

He has left the door ajar for me on this. On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment with a view to resubmission on Report Stage, pending further discussion, as offered by the Minister of State.
13016	SeanSherlock	Labour	18074.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-01 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	169	 I move amendment No. 142: In page 135, after line 37, to insert the following: “Amendment of section 66 of Act of 2007 (consumer complaints) 158. The Consumer Protection Act 2007 is amended by the insertion of the following after section 66: “Part 4B SUBSCRIBER COMPLAINTS HANDLING Interpretation and application of Part 66C. (1) In this Part— ‘complaint’— (a) means any expression of a subscriber’s dissatisfaction and his or her expectation of a response or resolution, and (b) includes any request by a subscriber for information or assistance, made to a trader and arising from difficulties experienced in relation to a service provided by the trader to the subscriber; ‘subscriber’ means a consumer who receives a service from a trader pursuant to a contract where, on payment of a periodic fee, the contract with the trader under which the service is supplied is successively renewed or rolled over, whether the fee is calculated solely by reference to a period of time or by reference to the amount of service received during that period, or by a combination of both; and ‘subscription’ shall be construed accordingly. (2) This Part applies to traders who supply a service to subscribers. Requirement to establish complaints handling scheme 66D. (1) The Commission may— (a) by regulation require traders to which this Part applies to establish a scheme for handling subscriber complaints (in this Part referred to as a ‘scheme’) in relation to the trader’s service or the supply of the service, and (b) prepare and publish guidelines applicable to traders concerning the establishment, form and operation of a scheme. (2) Before making regulations or publishing guidelines under this Part, the Commission may prepare draft regulations and draft guidelines and may consult with any person, as the Commission considers appropriate. (3) Regulations under this Part may, as respects to schemes, specify different requirements by reference to the class of trader concerned (being a class defined by reference to the commercial sector, the turnover of traders, the number of subscribers to the service or such other matters as the Commission considers appropriate). Provisions of complaints handling scheme 66E. Regulations under this Part may— (a) require traders to attempt to resolve subscriber complaints and, as appropriate, to provide subscribers with a satisfactory explanation, an apology or some other form of redress, (b) require the provision of information to subscribers in relation to the scheme and how it may be availed of, including details of how to contact the trader and specifying minimum requirements in relation to a trader’s response to contacts initiated by post, telephone and electronic communications, (c) require procedures under a scheme to comprise specified steps, and require one or more of the steps to be taken or completed within specified periods, (d) require traders to notify subscribers of the timescales for each step, and of the trader’s commitments and standards in relation to response times, (e) require traders to include a procedure for escalating complaints to a more senior specified person where a subscriber is dissatisfied having completed the first step in the complaints process, (f) require traders to provide subscribers with details of how the Commission can assist in resolving complaints which the trader has not resolved to the subscriber’s satisfaction and how the Commission can be contacted, and (g) prescribe such other requirements as the Commission considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling complaints to be dealt with or resolved. Remedies and penalties 66F. (1) A trader who is required by regulations under this Part to establish a scheme and who fails to do so is guilty of an offence. (2) A trader who establishes a scheme in accordance with regulations under this Part and who persistently fails to comply with the provisions of that scheme is guilty of an offence. (3) For the purposes of Part 5, ‘prohibited act or practice’ includes: (a) the failure by a trader to establish a scheme where he or she is required by regulations under this Part to do so; and (b) the persistent failure by a trader who establishes a scheme in accordance with regulations under this Part to comply with the provisions of that scheme.”.”. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response before I speak to the amendment.
13017	SeanSherlock	Labour	18074.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-01 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee	171	 The justification for the amendment is the lived experience of consumers who take out contracts, with broadband providers in particular. Often, the consumer purchases a broadband product, such as fibre to the home or a copper line, that is advertised as providing 1 GB but it provides less than that and there are dropouts and blackouts in the service provision. The consumer might pay €80 for that. I raised this on Second Stage. I know there is a withholding arrangement built into the legislation in relation to moneys. I fully accept that I may not be on the right track here so I have an open mind on this matter. I am trying to ensure that, where the consumer goes through all the steps with the provider and where it is found that the trader did not adhere fully to the legislation, there is a stick built in whereby the provider will become guilty of an offence. We have enough anecdotal evidence based on our own experiences as public representatives of services having failed people where there is a contract to supply. I am open to correction on this but there do not appear to be sufficient penalties built in to ensure manners are put on the providers. This amendment seeks to provide some remedy for the consumer, as well as some penalty for the provider. Most people's experiences are positive and that is fully acknowledged. Establishing a scheme that is unambiguous in its nature will provide a clear charter, for want of a better expression, to the consumer and the provider where there is an absolute understanding of the expectations on the provider or the trader. That is where I am coming from. ComReg is overloaded and is not resourced. Let us call a spade a spade. We know that so let us acknowledge that. There are not enough personnel in ComReg and policing these issues has been a perennial problem. People will be reluctant to withdraw a part of their payment for lack of a service if they do not feel there are enough protections built in.

I am grateful to you for your forbearance in allowing me to speak to the amendment. My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, received correspondence from you on 2 June where you expressed regret at the fact that amendment No. 97 is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill, could impose a charge on the revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Orders 187(1) and 212(3). We put forward this amendment on the basis that we wished to support the Government's attempts to ensure there is a meaningful piece of legislation on climate action and low carbon development. I merely wish, from a procedural point of view, to understand the logic of disallowing the amendment, which seeks a sectoral adaptation plan in respect of afforestation and targets therein, and similarly in respect of the remediation of bogs without impinging whatsoever on individuals' turbary rights, in the first instance. I would hope that the Chairman or perhaps the Minister of State could help my understanding of the logic behind the decision to disallow the amendment in the first place. That is merely what I wish to ascertain. Second, and depending on the answer to that, I do not see how a sectoral adaptation plan in relation to afforestation which I would consider to be germane to the issue of climate action could be injurious to a Bill of this nature unless, of course, it is a matter of interpreting the Minister of State's position thus far, which is that ""not ... everything ... needs to be stuffed into this Bill"". I would have thought that afforestation targets are absolutely germane to this legislation. While we acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in relation to her current afforestation travails, notwithstanding the challenges in relation to licensing, the Labour Party strongly feels there is an issue here that is absolutely germane to the issue of climate action. I wish to seek a justification for ruling that amendment out of order. Thank you, Chair, for allowing me to intercede. I appreciate it."

13029	SeanSherlock	Labour	17717.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-09 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	57	 If the Minister of State could respond to me, I would be ever so grateful. The Bill, by its nature, in terms of what it seeks to do, could be argued to impose a charge on the revenue if you take some of those amendments that have been accepted. I refer to the interpretation here. I would love to have seen the advice of the Oireachtas officials in respect of this one. I wish merely to argue that every action in here and within this legislation where amendments are accepted could arguably impose a charge on the revenue. We find the decoupling of afforestation targets from this legislation to be extremely incongruous to the spirit of the legislation. If the Minister of State could give me some response or some words of comfort regarding the effect of afforestation targets - this is a major issue now - I would gladly accept those comments. Indeed, I would gladly accept any offer that the Minister of State might make for further engagement on the issue. Chair, I thank you again for your patience.

13061	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	21	 I ask the Chairman for his forbearance at the outset, because we will operate a question-and-answer format while I have the floor.
13062	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	23	 Yes. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new role. I have a few policy-related questions. He said in his speech that he would fulfil the existing level of service and there would be no policy change. I want to flesh this out. Does he mean the status quo will obtain from 2015 to 2016 and there will be no new departures in terms of policy implementation, particularly for the management of heritage? I note that the Minister of State referred to heritage services. He mentioned very specific sites and talked about co-operating with Fáilte Ireland on initiatives such as Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. A pot of approximately €65 million has been made available for capital projects by Fáilte Ireland. How will that money be disbursed? Will it be disbursed outside the keynote sites that are normally referred to in terms of tourist attractions? He referred specifically to Kilmainham Gaol, Glendalough, Clonmacnoise and Killarney National Park. There are other sites that I would advocate, such as Doneraile Wildlife Park in Cork, which has approximately 450,000 visitors per annum. Will there be a change in policy that would allow such sites to be marketed along with either the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East? I want to get a sense from him of how he views heritage sites, tourism potential and job creation in rural areas. There are sites that are a little off the beaten track but they are no less important than the big keynote sites. With regard to CFRAM, Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the Cork project and insurance issues. The Munster Blackwater, and specifically the flood alleviation works that were carried out in Fermoy and Mallow, are keynote OPW projects that have delivered significant benefits. My next issue is demountable walls. Has an actuarial analysis been done to assess the cost of insurance in cases in which demountable walls have been put in place? There is clear evidence that the presence of demountable walls alleviates flooding. I do not mean to be too parochial but I am referring to the Munster Blackwater, where the OPW did a stellar job in two specific towns. There is proof that demountable walls work because they have stopped towns from being flooded. That should, from an actuarial point of view, have the knock-on effect of driving down insurance premiums. We need to be more vociferous and stronger when sending a message to the insurance companies about such issues. In my opinion, insurance companies are using the excuse that there is a lack of evidence to support demountable works or that there is some actuarial analysis or mitigating risk factor associated with demountable walls. Perhaps this is an issue that the Minister of State could take up. Can I have a specific start date for the Bandon and Skibbereen projects? My next point also concerns CFRAM. It could be argued that the OPW maps trawl well beyond certain curtilages, especially in villages with arterial drains, minor rivers or streams. Even if one were to assess the 100-year flood risk in certain places, the analysis would drive up the cost of insurance for the people who live there. Has CFRAM looked at towns and villages that have tributaries? Has CFRAM adopted a belt-and-braces approach to alleviating flood risk in such places? The area for further assessment identifies the risk. How does CFRAM measure the risk? Does it use the usual formula of the 100-year flood? Is it less than that? I thank the Minister of State for his statement. Notwithstanding his statement that there will be no policy change, are there specific issues related to the timeframe in which to deliver projects? What does he wish to achieve, on his watch as Minister of State responsible for the OPW, in terms of heritage, the management of natural resources and flood alleviation? I would like him to outline, in his own words, his vision for the Department. Have functions been clearly delineated and delegated to him in terms of the management of his budget?
13063	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	25	 Is the Minister of State chairing the interdepartmental group?
13064	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	27	 Yes. My point about flood mapping is that if one takes CFRAM and a small village with a stream going through it where there has not been a flood within living memory, the insurance maps will show clearly at present that the curtilage of the stream is very wide and the area is deemed to be a flood plain. I might not have explained myself clearly. When the CFRAM study on the villages and towns we are talking about sees the light of day there must be a realistic mechanism built in such that one looks at the 100-year risk. If a village has not flooded, or the stream has not burst its banks, in living memory, and people are paying an extra premium for their insurance because the mapping is such that the curtilage is very wide either side of the bank, then I contend that the OPW or the Minister of State must look at the issue because it is driving up the cost of insurance and some places are uninsurable as a result. Barryscourt Castle in Cork is another prime OPW site. We all acknowledge the excellence with which the OPW carries out its work in terms of care, maintenance and enhancement, because it has spent considerable resources recently enhancing such sites off the beaten track. Barryscourt Castle in Carrigtwohill is on a main thoroughfare and it is an example of wonderful work conducted by the OPW but it has been closed for some time and it is still closed. If the Minister of State cannot respond to me on the issue today perhaps he could revert to me.

13066	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	31	 I appreciate that because it is another key site for the south and it would be fantastic if it could be open this summer but I think we are too late.
13067	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	33	 I thank Mr. McMahon.
13068	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	35	 Will the Minister of State comment on his delegated functions? Have they been clearly defined and is there a very clear budget? Will the Minister of State have absolute autonomy and policy control over his budget? Has it been notified to the Dáil at this stage? I am not aware that it has been.
13069	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	37	 The Minister of State is not being facetious.
13070	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	206	 There is a further point.
13071	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	210	 In terms of learning about how the OPW operates as an organisation, it might be helpful as well to distinguish between the role of the Minister of State and the commissioners in terms of how the law operates regarding the autonomy of the commissioners in respect of making decisions. Perhaps that should be dealt with in this forum, even today, to give us an insight into the role of commissioners because it arguably differs from other Departments because commissioners are appointed. It would be helpful for people who are watching these committee proceedings to get a two or three-minute insight into the role of the commissioners in respect of how the policy of the OPW plays out.
13072	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	251	 I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to the committee. My questions concern the Vote before us, but before I put them I will make a broad point about the need for this committee to make time for a discussion on the summer economic statement and the recent report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Notwithstanding the time constraints we face today, I would welcome the opportunity to have a broader discussion on the very macroeconomic issues that affect us all, particularly how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform fits into that firmament, because there are legitimate questions relating to the summer economic statement concerning the costings for 2017 of recent announcements such as the Revised Estimate for health and the €200 million local investment fund for local authorities. On the latter, we need an opportunity to interrogate the modalities of that scheme and its cost in terms of public expenditure but also in respect of-----
13073	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	253	" I appreciate that. Other issues include medium-term objectives and the stability programme update. These are all issues that this committee needs to have time to discuss with the Minister, so I appreciate that and I thank the Minister. The EU referendum in Great Britain is on the horizon. In respect of subheads A6 and A8 and the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, which is within the Minister's Department, we have given a lot of resources and time to ensuring that this North-South body is adequately funded and that the PEACE programme is funded adequately from an EU perspective. Has the Minister a view on the effect on those programmes if the UK exits the EU? Subhead A8 concerns the Ireland Wales Territorial Co-operation Programme. I am very worried that if the UK exits the EU it will have a profound effect on programmes operating on a North-South basis from both a social and an economic point of view. I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that. In respect of procurement, I note that reference was made to savings of €80 million to €100 million and previous savings. I have a worry about Irish SMEs. I note that there has been a lot of work done with regard to the local enterprise offices and ""meet the buyer"" events and so on, and savings have been made. Has the Department calculated whether more Irish SMEs have taken up this opportunity and whether pre-existing Irish companies and SMEs have been crowded out by virtue of the fact that they lack the economies of scale required to compete for business? I make specific reference to the education sector, where there is anecdotal evidence that companies that supplied arts and crafts supplies, books and other products in the education sphere feel they will not be able to retain the market share they had and are being crowded out by the new regime for procuring savings. I do not necessarily need an answer to that today. I am just putting down a marker, and we might have a further discussion on it because there are companies that are feeling a bit of pressure in that space. Is PeoplePoint operating at full capacity? Have the individual line Departments' HR and payment functions migrated to PeoplePoint in a seamless fashion? We all acknowledge that there will be a lag on that and that there will be issues that must be dealt with, but I would like to hear the Minister's perspective on whether PeoplePoint is up and running and whether it is responding to individual workers' queries in a timely fashion. In respect of Vote 19, provision is made for issues such as prisoner complaints, clinical judgments and direct provision to be dealt with by the Office of the Ombudsman. I understand it has a budget of €9.7 million. Will the Office of the Ombudsman have an expanded role? Is the cost of this being met in respect of the potential need for increased personnel to deal with an expanded service? I have a bugbear concerning our own services here. Our own IT infrastructure has not migrated to the cloud. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing a very good job of ensuring that build-to-share and cloud service platforms are built through the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. I note the statement relating to data mining and so on. Is this is a matter for further discussion somewhere down the line? We could discuss how the Oireachtas operates in respect of our own ICT infrastructure and making loose systems available, because the systems we are operating at the moment are a bit anachronistic and arcane and might need to be looked at. That is a very minor issue, but I said I would take the opportunity to raise it with the Minister while he was here. I welcome the comments on the opening up of a dialogue with the public sector unions on the commission. The Minister made a very clear statement about how any sudden elimination of the FEMPI measures is not feasible. I was hoping for more time today to discuss the summer economic statement, the fiscal space and the new moneys that appear to have been made available, because I wonder whether there is scope to accelerate the unwinding of FEMPI, given the increased resources that would appear to be available as an outcome of the summer economic statement."

13077	SeanSherlock	Labour	15904.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Business of Select Committee.	262	 I am not criticising anybody working within our IT system here. The system is what it is. If Government is talking about open data, open government and the system we operate as a parliament, compared with others such as the Estonian parliament, which has moved lock, stock and barrel into the cloud, then - while I note there may be security issues, with firewalling and whatnot - we need to bring our system kicking and screaming into this century, because I contend that it uses last-century technology. If the Minister can have an open mind about that and, in his responsibility for public expenditure and reform, ensure that we make our system fit for purpose, that will send a signal.

From his wisdom and experience, what does the Minister see as the potential impact of Brexit on foreign direct investment in this country? The programme for Government has clear targets for job creation over the lifetime of the Government’s mandate. If the UK tax position becomes more competitive, particularly regarding financial services and the lowering of VAT rates or even corporation tax rates, does the Minister have a sense of the potential impact that will have on job creation in this country, as well as the ability to attract foreign direct investment? While there might be an early boost of foreign direct investment into Ireland, the UK still remains the largest attractor of foreign direct investment in Europe. In the context of the financial services sector, there is a concern that Ireland may not be sufficiently diversified in access to markets and exports of financial services. Is there an over-reliance on exports of financial services to the UK? Has there been a significant diversification of exports to the Asian and North American markets? The Minister stated that there are still 85,998 mortgage accounts in arrears. While this represents an 18% decline, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine further measures to support borrowers. Have any of those measures been advanced at this juncture?
13100	SeanSherlock	Labour	15912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-30 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2016	14	 My question was in respect of financial services and the IFSC. Let us suppose the UK departs from EU taxation legislation or case law in respect of VAT. Is the financial services sector in this country sufficiently diversified such that there is no over-reliance on the UK market? I have in mind exports of financial goods and services, the financial technology industry and everything that sails in that ship. This includes exports of services from Ireland to the UK. Have we diversified sufficiently into Asian markets, EU markets and North American markets? That is really the question. Is there contingency planning in place? I am asking the question insofar as it is possible because we are in a state of flux politically and economically and it is impossible to predict what is going to happen in terms of the effect on the Irish economy, the UK economy and the European economy no matter how much contingency planning we put in place. All we can do is go by the ESRI and the Department of Finance predictors in so far as that is possible. Can I get a sense from the Department of Finance or the Government of whether there is contingency planning under way? Is the Department seeking to ensure that the gains made by the financial services sector will not be lost and that we will continue to grow? That is an important message and signal.
13101	SeanSherlock	Labour	15912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-30 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2016	170	 I welcome the Taoiseach to the committee. I will start with the Vote. I acknowledge the role of everybody involved in the 1916 commemorations. I know this was a cross-party initiative led by the Taoiseach's Department. We must acknowledge the inclusivity of the programmes and the fact that the occasion was participated in by communities right across the country. It is a programme of which everybody can be very proud. When will the citizens' assembly be established? There is provision for it in the Estimate, but will it still meet the October timeline? The Cabinet committee on rural and regional affairs deals with rural development, broadband and flooding. I know it has a particular eye on the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM. I hope to get a signal from the Taoiseach that this is not just a talking shop and that the Cabinet committee has a budget line with real actions around it. Will the Taoiseach provide an insight on that? Will I start with that opening gambit and come back with a few more?
13102	SeanSherlock	Labour	15912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-30 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2016	173	 I will make a political point about the citizens' assembly. We are in a citizens' assembly. Notwithstanding the Government's decision, we have received a mandate from the people regarding governance and decisions, so we are well equipped by virtue of that mandate - and its diversity - to deal with the issue. I am worried about the number of Irish personnel serving in EU and international institutions. I know there is a specific job to be done and the Department is working on that. When the United Kingdom exits the European Union, the number of staff with English as a first language will decrease significantly, so there is scope for Irish people to take up the slack. I hope we will be strategic in that respect. Are all the case files in the Chief State Solicitor's Office being managed and is it being done in a timely fashion? Is there much of a backlog in the office and are enough resources being allocated there? I am very conscious of the time but I will speak about Brexit. I do not know why Mr. Tusk refused to meet the Scottish First Minister. I recognise some concerns were raised by the Spanish Prime Minister, who is a member of the European People's Party, of which the Taoiseach's party is also a member. There may have been some issues relating to how Scotland is not recognised as a state but rather as a region. One can consider the political issue of Brexit and that Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay within the European Union, as did Scotland. The question did not arise for Ireland. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is an avowed Brexiteer and the First Minister of Northern Ireland has a very explicit position on the UK's membership of the European Union. That presents a serious challenge for us, particularly in ensuring there is a negotiated position that does not leave us weakened economically as a result of the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. I wish the Taoiseach well in the coming months with the economic diplomacy that will have to be gone through, as well as the political diplomacy. Anglo-Irish relations have never been as good as they are now, arguably, and I would like to get a sense from the Taoiseach now or in future as to how we will address the political conundrum of ensuring that once there is a new British Prime Minister we can up the ante in that diplomatic onslaught. At this stage I acknowledge the role of our ambassador in the United Kingdom, Mr. Dan Mulhall, as well as the role of the consulate in Edinburgh in ensuring we did everything we could to encourage Irish people in the United Kingdom to vote on the referendum. In future there should be a mechanism to ensure the terms of trade are enhanced and we do not become disadvantaged due to the potential of the United Kingdom to lower its corporation tax and VAT rates, for example, making us even less competitive for inward investment. It is a political point but I want to put it on record.

I will start with estate management. I also join with the Chairman in welcoming the new Chairman of the OPW. I too worked in a previous guise with him through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I am delighted to see him appointed to this role. It may not be possible for the Minister of State to answer my questions directly at this session. If he cannot, I would be grateful if somebody would revert to me. I want to raise sites like Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Annes Grove Gardens in Castletownroche, County Cork, and Doneraile Court. They are three key reference sites that come under the ambit of the OPW's sphere of responsibility. I know that works are ongoing in Barryscourt Castle, for instance. The people who use these facilities are anxious to ensure there is continuing maintenance and development. I note the Minister of State's remarks with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the reference to developing the heritage element of the OPW offerings. I ask the Minister to revert to me with regard to what the plans are for those three particular sites. The Annes Grove Gardens site, in particular, is a recent acquisition and a very valuable one in terms of its history and place in north Cork. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the resources are deployed in such a way as to ensure its future development. I note that there has been a 12.8% increase in revenue streams. I ask the Minister of State to delve further into how that 12.8% is arrived at in terms of attendance figures across the sites throughout the country. It is a cumulative increase. People like me, who represent the people of north and east Cork, would like to see how that translates to sites like Doneraile Court, Annes Grove Gardens and Barryscourt Castle, which is obviously closed at the moment. I would be very grateful if we could get some solid information from the Minister of State on the figures as they relate to those three reference sites. My next question is about the children's science centre. What is the actual state of progress on that? That is the first half of my intervention. The second half of my intervention relates to Cork in particular and the proposed flood works. I note the Minister of State said that the deadline for submissions has moved out to a date in March. There have been some concerns raised, of which the Minister will be aware, regarding the aesthetics that this project will bring and how that will impact on the visual amenity that people enjoy on the River Lee. Historically, on schemes like the Munster Blackwater in Fermoy as well as in Mallow, similar concerns were raised by people living within those regions. I can understand the concerns of the people of Cork city. I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of those concerns. I understand a process is under way. I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the aesthetic value of the River Lee and to be mindful of the need to ensure the visual amenity that is there. There are other concerns that will come into the public forum as time goes on. The Minister of State mentioned small schemes. There is still a situation arising from Storm Frank in 2015 where works are ongoing on the N25, east of Castlemartyr. I travelled on that road the other day and work has been carried out opposite a particular property. I do not want to name the person in question but he and his family have been very much affected by Storm Frank. There are turloughs present in the area. There has been no communication between the OPW and this person. To be fair to the person in question, aesthetically, opposite his house looks a bit like a bomb site at the moment. I do not want to inflame the situation in any way. However, if the OPW or its agents could communicate more with the people affected in that particular region, I believe it would be a good day's work. I also want to ask about the voluntary home relocation scheme. I would like to know what criteria apply. Do they include a person moving to an elevated site on their own property and building from scratch? Is that one of the areas that the Minister of State is examining? I would like to hear more about the modalities of the scheme, maybe not today, but perhaps at some future session. In fairness to the Minister of State with regard to his engagement on the insurance issue, he has been quite proactive to my mind. I had a meeting with the Minister of State prior to the Christmas recess. We are perhaps still sceptical about whether Insurance Ireland will actually take on board the CFRAM process and, having done that, whether it will reflect in lower costs in the premiums of people living in areas affected by CFRAM. That remains to be seen and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State. Many people have carried out works in smaller areas, such as Castlemartyr in County Cork, which was badly affected, and places like Midleton. Some of those people had insurance, but others did not and had to pay out quite an amount of money to repair damaged property. They are looking for an answer to the question of whether Insurance Ireland will realistically engage and whether a real protocol will be put in place to ensure that, once the OPW has future-proofed a particular area that is within a certain flood plain, the cost of insurance will be reduced for people in the future. I acknowledge it is an ongoing process and I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on it. Those are my opening remarks.

13115	SeanSherlock	Labour	16142.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-15 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	14	 I have a final question on flood insurance and the Minister of State's engagement with Insurance Ireland. The demountable walls meet best international practice.
13116	SeanSherlock	Labour	16142.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-15 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	16	 The Munster Blackwater scheme, at Fermoy in particular, was carried out by an internationally recognised consulting engineering firm, one of the best in the business globally. I cannot tally why that would not be accepted by Insurance Ireland or any insurance provider, if it is best international practice and these insurance houses are international insurance houses. It seems to me that the companies are refusing point blank to insure. That seems to be closer to the truth. The ultimate question for people who live in areas where work has been carried out and demountable walls are in place is whether there is a power to compel the companies to provide insurance.
13117	SeanSherlock	Labour	16142.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-15 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	182	 I would like to move the conversation onto macroeconomic policy, specifically the Stability and Growth Pact. We are looking at the eurozone growth figures for the fourth quarter of this year and they are being revised downwards to something like 0.4% from 0.5%. I understand that letters have been issued to something like seven countries, although not to Ireland thankfully. Increasingly what we are seeing in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact is that there is a lot of focus on the stability but very little on the growth. I would like to get a perspective from the Minister as to where Ireland stands on, for instance, recent comments by the German finance Minister that there may need to be a review of the Stability and Growth Pact and where the politics of that rest at present within the EU. If we are looking at growth in our own economy and capital spending, obviously there is going to be a turf war on the capital spend. The Minister and I both inhabit the great province of Munster. We would be looking at regional economic development between Cork, Limerick and Galway and that Atlantic corridor. People representing the eastern side of the country would be looking at metro north, the M50 and other such projects. If we are to be realistic about proper investment in projects of this nature, there needs to be some degree of flexibility built in to, or a revision of, the Stability and Growth Pact because I think it is actually impeding the potential for growth. There cannot be growth without proper regional infrastructure. I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that and on whether that conversation is being had by ECOFIN Ministers.

13131	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	4	 I thank the Minster and his officials for attending today's meeting. We are currently going through a process to establish various commissions of inquiry and tribunals. Taking the last two or three years, to date, how much have we spent on tribunals of inquiry, commissions of investigation and Oireachtas inquiries?
13132	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	6	 I thank the Minister for his reply. The sum of €420 million is an extraordinary figure over such a relatively short period. I agree with the Minister that every party needs to have natural justice and the truth needs to be sought. However, I wonder whether such a cost should be borne, ultimately by the taxpayer, in seeking truth and justice, regardless of the subject matter. I think we all agree that these are important issues that should be the subject of tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation. However, does Deputy Donohoe, in his role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, believe there is now a case to be made for these costs to be considered? I imagine the vast bulk of them are legal costs which accrue to legal practices. Has the Minister given any thought to the idea that we need to find some mechanism whereby truth and justice are sought and reported on in a way that does not put such a burden on the taxpayer? I take the point the Minister may make about the relatively recent referendum and so on but I do not believe that the Irish taxpayer wants to continue to bear these costs, particularly if they are, in the main, legal costs. There may now be some need for reform of this process because it is arguable that it is unsustainable.
13133	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	8	 I take the point the Minister makes. Ultimately, it is the Minister's Department that will sign the cheque, or through which the cheque will come, regarding the fees structure and the entirety of the costs. Lest there be any ambiguity about my position on this, let me state that the right to have one's rights vindicated and be represented legally is absolutely sacrosanct, and I think we would all agree with that. However, is there a process by which costs can be capped while recognising the rights of all parties before a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry? Going back to the 2008 report, it seems that if the Comptroller and Auditor General is acknowledging the spiralling costs - at the risk of putting words into his mouth - then those costs are out of control. They are astronomical and ridiculous as regards the pursuit of justice or truth, depending on the content of the inquiry. The Irish taxpayer has the right to ensure that the most cost-effective mechanism is used, even if this means legislating for an upper cap on costs per hour or whatever formula is used to determine costs. I put it to the Minister that it is not possible for the Irish taxpayer to sustain over ten years a cost of €420.593 million. There needs to be a policy shift somewhere.
13134	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	10	 I am not trying to be partisan in my approach here, and I do take the point-----
13135	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	12	 -----about the cost of tribunals. The mechanism is one thing. Whether it is a tribunal of inquiry or a commission of investigation, the appropriate mechanism is found. There is still the issue of the cost. I will close the matter off now because I take the point the Minister is making. Moving on, I think we all support the work of the Public Service Pay Commission. We support the Minister's endeavours in this regard because I think we want to ensure there is a formula that allows for a transition that is as seamless as possible after the Lansdowne Road agreement sunset. How does the Minister envisage the outworkings of the Public Service Pay Commission and how it will transition into the potential for a further negotiation downstream on public sector pay? I ask for his personal perspective on this.
13136	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	14	 The emergency framework is still in place but is the issue of those who are above the current threshold in respect of pension restoration working its way into discussions?
13137	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	16	 Is the Minister satisfied that the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 is working?
13138	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	18	 The move towards transparency has been welcomed by everybody and I hope vested interests will not seek to undo that or try to restrict the legislation in any way in the review. It is important that everybody has sight of who is registered as a lobbyist, for obvious reasons.
13139	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	20	 Has the Minister had regard to the post-programme surveillance report?
13140	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	22	" Has the Minister a perspective on that in respect of the need to ensure ongoing capital investment for infrastructural purposes from a stability and growth perspective? The report is anaemic. It is a little like the teacher using the red pen to mark the copybook. That does not necessarily educate or offer solutions to the student as to where he or she has gone wrong or outline whether the teacher's own practices could be better. The report seems to be very much a desktop exercise. I do not criticise the originators of the report but the limiting factors of the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of our ability to invest more in capital expenditure for infrastructural purposes to boost the domestic economy is a bugbear of mine. How are the politics of that being played out at European Council level? We are facing uncertain times and there is turbulence ahead. It is not enough for the authors to describe the scenario here; there must be more about where the European Commission or the Council intervene to assist us to meet the Stability and Growth Pact and other targets in order that we can meet the challenges of the so-called ""clouds on the horizon"", to use their phrase. The pact is too restrictive. It does not allow the Government to operate within a wider envelope to boost the European economy further and to boost the domestic economy, in particular. What is the Minister's perspective on that?"
13141	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	24	 This is the point, is it not? Whether it is articulated through some flexibility in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact or European Council agreement on the point just made by the Minister, there must be some political formula that allows that to happen. It is arguable that we are overly constrained by the rules that exist at the moment. There must be, at an EU level, some mechanism to allow Ireland, from a macro-economic point of view, to invest without falling foul of the very strict rules that exist at present.
13142	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	26	 The liability can be financed out over a relatively long period of time. If one is talking about roads or transport, for instance, there are ways of factoring that in. Financing over a long period of time allows one to meet the repayment costs in a relatively easy fashion.
13143	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	28	 We need to move away from the current situation where, for example, I would make a pitch for the Atlantic corridor and connectivity between Cork, Limerick and Galway and on up the western seaboard. Often it is a case of whoever shouts the loudest, from a political point of view, gets the spoils in terms of capital investment. We must find some other model. If I understand the Minister correctly, there is a suggestion that PPPs and engagement with the EIB on projects of the type to which I have just referred could be viable as options in terms of building out funding for transport-related capital infrastructure.
13144	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	30	 Mallow and Charleville but there is a constituency boundary-----
13145	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	32	 There is an irony in the fact that I am talking about PPPs and the Minister is talking about State investment.
13146	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	34	 I thank the Minister for his responses. I will direct my last question, which is on the post-programme surveillance report, to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. That reports makes reference to the potential for volatility in global financial markets to spill over into the Irish financial sector. Perhaps the Minister of State has not studied the report yet in detail but I would welcome his views on it. There is a suggestion that Brexit-related volatility could spill over into the Irish financial sector and could have a downstream effect on jobs. That seems like a strange thing to say, given that there is apparently a lot of interest in the Irish financial services sector at the moment from parties across the pond. Does the Minister of State have a view on that?
13147	SeanSherlock	Labour	16164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-09 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2017	42	 Quality of life. These are all important factors.

13175	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	4	 I have two lists of amendments, one dated 5 April and the other dated 31 March. To ensure that I am singing off the same hymn sheet as everyone else, is the 5 April list the updated one?
13176	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	6	 I thank the Chairman.

My understanding of the Chairman's earlier intervention is that sections 26 and 27 may be pertinent with regard to Members of the Oireachtas. Rather than explaining all of the sections at this stage, could we move to deal with the amendments, extrapolate their meaning and dispense with them as we go along? Obviously, I will be guided by the Chairman.
13178	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	41	 The standards commissioner, as I understand it, will be able to appoint - a board will be appointed, if I am not mistaken. May I seek a clarification on that? It would be necessary in my view to ensure that there is a representative on that board who is either a former Oireachtas Member or former councillor, somebody within that new arrangement who would speak to the dynamic that exists for public representatives.

However, section 7 poses questions in relation to-----

If a further process is necessary to examine the content of section 7, one must be mindful of what the Chairman said if section 7 is passed today.
13181	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	73	 To be frank about it, I am quite happy with the amendments to section 7. However, that still does not deal with the questions that have been posed by Deputy Dara Calleary and the Chairman on section 7. I am happy to agree to the amendments to section 7, but if there are content issues in section 7, the question is, do we pass section 7? If section 7 is passed, can one still submit amendments on Report Stage?
13182	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	91	 I have a question about chief executives of local authorities. I am glad to see they are included in this Bill. Will chief executives of local authorities have to make a declaration for the purposes of the Bill?
13183	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	93	 I thank the Minister.

I am thinking of the county councillor, for example, who may be a solicitor, a commissioner for oaths or an auctioneer. Where a local development plan is being made, and if that person has a declarable interest in selling or ownership of that land, is there anything in this new section that strengthens the declaration or the necessity to declare an interest? Is it as is? I am trying to understand the ad hoc declaration which the Minister has described. I am not fully au fait with it yet. I think it is pertinent to section 7. If it is not, the Minister can inform me.
13185	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	109	 If I were a teacher and also a county councillor, for example.

The Bill states: ""Each of the interests specified in this section is a declarable interest for the purposes of this Act, and the following forms of interest are dealt with by the following subsections-----"". I seek guidance on this issue. Does any part of the Bill explicitly say that one has to declare the source of the income as opposed to ""the income""?"
13188	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	155	 I seek clarification on periodic and ad hoc disclosures. Under section 7 and its attendant subsections, the ad hoc disclosure applies. My understanding is that the ad hoc disclosure is made if and when a conflict of interest arises. It is generally more effective than periodic disclosure in identifying interests likely to give rise to a conflict as the nature of the private interests to be disclosed can be defined in more general terms. Consequently, it is also better at bringing such interests into the public arena. There is an obligation on any persons or entities subject to section 7 to make the declaration. Where is the composite investigative function? Is there a composite or opposing investigative function on the part of the Standards in Public Office Commission?

I would have a problem with SIPO or the commissioner going direct to Revenue because a person may not be compliant at a given time, but not for nefarious reasons.

The existing culture in respect of the Standards in Public Office Commission is such that one can go and speak to people in that office and get guidance. To see it clearly written into legislation is to be welcomed.

Most of us would have a fair sense of the value of a gift and I am sure that a couple of phone calls would let a person know what the value of the gift was, depending on its nature.

In practice, their value is more nominal than monetary in nature.

The provision to the effect that the identity of the person making the complaint is not disclosed is fine, as is the provision that it relates to a private matter and is unrelated to the functions of the respondent.

13211	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	346	 -----but that is on the basis of submissions that have been made where the public official has been through an informal process in engaging with the officials within the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. It is only after a long period and informal engagement, and a lack of satisfaction on the part of the commissioner, that the commissioner can suggest - not make a finding - that an investigation be opened up. The commissioner's reason would be that he or she believes that the engagement with the public official has been insufficient and that the official has not furnished the commissioner with all the details required. The commissioner would believe that there was potential for material contravention and could then trigger an investigation. As Deputy Calleary has said, there are sufficient checks and balances built in to the process.
13212	SeanSherlock	Labour	16192.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	348	 Is the preliminary inquiry held before it hits the fan, so to speak?

The Minister is potentially going outside the fold of the Standards in Public Office Commissioner. If I were to be subjective, I would say he is conferring on the deputy commissioner powers to appoint, hire, fire and pay at will. It would be better - the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - to have an in-house investigation staffed and properly resourced rather than putting it out to tender. I assume there would have to be a tender process. If it is not open to a tender process, what other process would it be open to? I fear that the person who could be appointed, although appointed by the sheriff, so to speak, could be a bit of a lone wolf. We cannot speak to the bona fides of that person and, without prescribing this in legislation, we are relying on the discretion of the deputy commissioner. That is a little worry that I have.

Whether or not the investigation officer proceeds by virtue of an appointment internally by the deputy commissioner or the commissioner, the commissioner can still do what is outlined anyway. What is pertinent here is that the legislation provides for entering and searching a premises. For the purposes of the current legislation, we have gone from a position where I, as a public official, will interact with a professional person to ensure that my house is in order and I am compliant with the legislation to one where, if there are sufficient grounds, subject to all the criteria proposed and if all else fails, this power is conferred on them. I am not against those powers being given. I am just trying to get a sense of where the Minister is coming from on that. Deputy Calleary asked if these are new sweeping powers and the motivation for them. Is it to say that we are taking a belt and braces approach to this standards in public office legislation and to have powers that are so sweeping, someone will have no other choice but to be absolutely compliant because failure to be compliant means they will literally have people knocking on their door, which is not necessarily the case at the moment? I am trying to get an understanding of the motivation.

Would it be possible for a report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps annually? I do not want to anonymise the efforts but I am referring to a report stating publicly the number of cases that have been investigated or where these powers have been used. In that way we would have a sense of how this new legislation will take shape. Is that a reasonable request?

We have to vindicate a person's good name as well. I do not believe any of us are against this legislation but we want to make sure that sufficient checks and balances are built into the investigatory powers provisions to ensure that nobody acts in a nefarious fashion to bring somebody down, so to speak, in a malevolent way. We want to make sure that the person who puts his or her name on the ballot paper or the person who is deemed to be a public official has a fair crack of the whip in terms of the way the legislation is crafted. Those are my concerns and, to be frank, I think the Minister has addressed them.

13298	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	99	 I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks. With his permission, I will deal with the questions that were asked before I make my statement, as I am conscious that some people need to move on to deal with other issues. On the Palestinian question, the Minister mentioned monetary commitments of €10 million, but there is a further funding commitment in 2015 to the bilateral co-operation unit, for which €4.2 million will be provided by Irish Aid. This will support the Palestinian Authority's education development strategic plan and civil society organisations. Effectively, this is about promoting human rights and ensuring funding is focused on educational needs. We are confident that there is no corruption in regard to that fund because, by virtue of the fact that the bilateral arrangement is in place, we have people on the ground in Ramallah and we closely monitor the situation there. In regard to Uganda, when the issue there arose in 2012 at the office of the Prime Minister, Ireland acted expeditiously to suspend funding of over €16 million in development assistance. We compiled a full report, completed in 2014, through our Department's evaluation and audit unit. We are satisfied that the funds have been recovered and steps have been taken to ensure proper management systems are put in place for the future.
13299	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	101	 Yes - no doubt about it. Since that time, the budget for Uganda has decreased, from €21 million in 2014 to €16.2 million in 2015. An interim programme is in place for Uganda and we are considering developing a new five-year country programme. That process is ongoing as we speak. We are taking a vigilant line in Uganda. A positive result of what happened is that there has been a strengthening of the system for the key partner countries. On the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan, having visited some of our key partner countries and considering how much funding we divest, I fully agree with her that it would be good to meet more parliamentarians and build links with them at bilateral level, rather than just meeting people at ministerial or presidential level. Through that engagement, we would better see where the rubber hits the road in terms of the impact of the programmes within those key partner countries. I will give some energy to encouraging that. Perhaps we should take up that theme during future visits to these countries, and I hope to visit some of them in the not too distant future. The Deputy's point is valid.
13300	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	103	" Vote 27 - international co-operation - covers the main elements of the Government's international development assistance programme, Irish Aid. The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver the Department's high-level goals to contribute to the reduction of global poverty and hunger, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. We can be proud that against a background of great economic and budgetary challenge, the Government has largely managed to protect and stabilise the ODA budget over the past three years. This is recognised as a significant achievement internationally. This year, the Government has provided slightly in excess of €600 million for official development assistance, a modest increase on the 2014 allocation. Of that total, some €476 million will be administered under Vote 27 and the remaining €125 million is made up of contributions by other Departments and Ireland's share of the EU development co-operation budget. The 2015 ODA allocation represents a significant contribution by Ireland to international development and is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the aid programme. The Government remains firmly committed to building our aid programme and to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP as ODA. However, we can only make progress towards the target when economic circumstances allow. Now that the economy has resumed a path to sustainable growth, I will set out the case for building further on our commitment during 2015. Based on projected GNP figures for 2015, the expected ODA GNP percentage this year is likely to be approximately 0.4%. This will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most significant donors internationally on a per capita basis. On the policy and framework for action, our development co-operation programme, One World One Future, which is guided by our policy on international development, was approved and launched by the Government in 2013. This policy clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world and provides a solid basis for maximising the effectiveness and impact of Ireland's efforts. Recently, we published a framework for action to guide the implementation of our policy, a copy of which I have here. This framework will enable us to strengthen the effectiveness, accountability and impact of our work to measure performance and demonstrate accountability, and is the basis of our detailed operational plans for 2015. As Deputies are aware, the OECD development assistance committee, DAC, published its positive peer review of Ireland's aid programme last month. The review praises our aid programme, particularly its contribution to tackling hunger and poverty. It highly commends Ireland on having a clear overall vision for development co-operation and on grounding policies in the needs and priorities of our partner countries, noting that partners ""value Ireland as an honest broker and a trusted and long-term partner"". The review praised Ireland's commitment to delivering its development programme according to international best practices and principles for making aid more effective. In particular, the review noted that Ireland consistently continues to punch above its weight - the committee will forgive me if the cliché is overused today - on humanitarian and resilience issues. We are carefully reviewing the recommendations in the peer review report, which will assist us in continuing to improve the effectiveness of our development during 2015 and beyond. This year will be a critical year in the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger as we maximise progress under the millennium development goals and negotiate a new framework for international development post-2015. The new framework will mark an important shift to sustainable development with clear and ambitious goals and targets universally applicable to all countries to end extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition in a single generation. Ireland is actively engaged at the United Nations in negotiating the new sustainable development goals. Recently, the president of the UN General Assembly appointed Ireland and Kenya to co-facilitate the final international negotiations to agree the sustainable development goals at the United Nations over the coming year. Universally, the challenge will be to build consensus among the member states on a broad and comprehensive agenda to be adopted at the major summit of world leaders in New York in September of this year. Other priority areas for 2015 include reviewing our engagement with the UN and other multilateral organisations to ensure their priorities are aligned with ours, and enhancing our economic links with African countries, particularly our key partner countries. We will also continue to strengthen our systems across the programme to further improve management, accountability and transparency. Ireland's aid programme has often been praised internationally for its effectiveness, its sharp focus on poverty reduction and its commitment to tackling hunger. Development co-operation is at the heart of our foreign policy. Our key objective for 2015 is to continue to deliver a world-class programme aimed at some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives and build livelihoods. We appreciate the continued strong support and engagement of the committee, and I welcome any questions."

13302	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	114	" As some of the questions are quite technical members might intervene if I miss any of the points made. In regard to the questions posed by Deputy Smith, as I understand it DAC praised Ireland for its work on policy coherence across Departments. A wide range of Departments participated in the review. Perhaps I missed something in the question articulated by the Deputy. An interdepartmental committee on development, which I will chair, is to be established. The task of that committee will be to build on the progress of the DAC review and to examine the new sustainable development goals. We should examine the possibilities for further engagement between NGOs and the committee. I have been at the Department for a relatively short time, and my experience so far has been that the relationship between Irish Aid, the Minister, Department officials and the NGO community is flexible and open. There is very much an open door policy. A question was asked about the response to Ebola. The Department of Health is the main funding Department to the WHO. With regard to the Irish response to Ebola, given that Sierra Leone is one of our partner countries in which we have an embassy and embassy staff, we were able to influence, cajole, nudge and ensure the international response was robust. There is a critique of whether the international response, through all of the international multilateral organisations, was quick enough, and the answer is patently ""No"", but if one kicked the tyres on the Irish response one would see it was robust and immediate. The very weekend I was in Sierra Leone, after we had begun meetings with the President and various ministers in key departments, the UN mission was arriving, but we were already there on the ground. This allowed us to state what needed to happen in the response by virtue of our experience of working with key partner organisations such as GOAL, Concern and Plan. We knew exactly what needed to happen with regard to contact tracing and establishing phone banks so people could report in. I would argue our abilities on the ground were without par."
13303	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	116	 I know that.
13304	SeanSherlock	Labour	15393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-28 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2015	118	" I take the point the Deputy is making and I assure him that absolutely and utterly there has been a response from the Irish Government at Geneva on these issues. The danger of situations such as these is the mistakes are repeated. I reassure the committee that not only were we very responsive and we influenced the international response, and great credit is due to our embassy staff, but we were also able to feed back into multilateral organisations, such as the EU, which is represented in Sierra Leone, the UN, WHO and other UN-affiliated organisations. When I say Sierra Leone, I mean the three most affected countries in west Africa. There is no doubt that we will use our experience to be able to influence future responses on issues such as Ebola should it arise again. I wholeheartedly agree with the point made by Deputy Smith on tied aid, and I am in agreement with the Deputy on the idea of looking at potential procurement opportunities for Irish companies in order that they can build capacity, or at least they can be assisted. The Department title includes the word ""trade"" and there is no contradiction in assisting Irish SMEs with their relationships to build capacity for procurement opportunities through multilateral organisations such as the UN World Food Programme, or seeking to open doors in order that they can bid competitively for services which might be provided internationally. I hope this answers the question which has been posed. The 0.7% target was set in 1973 - I was going to say as I recall but I was only a year old - and we should consider where Ireland was then. We are talking about Ireland now and this programme. The world has changed. In monetary terms, we provided €667 million in 2011, €629 million in 2012, and €637 million in 2013. There has been a slight increase on the 2012 figure. I take the point that one could contend that changes in GNP figures, which are the national accounting statistics, from the point of view of the EU or EUROSTAT, has probably made it look a little better than it is. The Government is focused on stabilising it, which is what we did in the budget, and beginning to increase it, and staying focused on the 0.7% target. Obviously this target is predicated on future economic growth and the economy growing sustainably. We are still very mindful of this and we should not take our minds off the target. We should very much keep the focus on it, particularly in light of the upcoming negotiations vis-à-vis the sustainable development goals, in which Ireland will have a key part through the co-facilitation of talks. I absolutely and utterly understand the point made, but we will try to increase the monetary value and create an impact. On Deputy Crowe's point on bilateral and multilateral engagements, we have had to keep faith with our commitment to multilateral organisations, particularly the European Development Fund. We have seen a monetary increase in total terms on the overall vote and package but with a slight decrease in Vote 27. Overall the monetary terms have increased. It speaks to the fact that while in percentage terms there has been a positive change of 0.3% between 2014 and 2015 and overall overseas development aid is increasing, Vote 27 has decreased slightly and we acknowledge this. We still retain the commitment and we are increasing it in monetary terms. There is no shift in policy. I feel strongly that we are as good as the Irish Aid team we have, which I feel is excellent. The Department has many experts in humanitarian development and development related specialists. There is a strong sense of ensuring the relationship with the NGOs is strengthened. If I had one thing to say, which is a personal viewpoint subject to a tyre-kicking exercise, we could foresee further collaboration between organisations and NGOs on key thematic areas in certain geographies. It is an area I would like to examine further. Concern, GOAL, Plan and Trócaire are all excellent organisations, and there is no organisation which does not have excellence as part of its brief, but in certain geographical areas in which we are working, such as South Sudan or Ethiopia, with which we have a key partner country relationship, we could consider bedding down a greater degree of collaboration between organisations such as GOAL and Concern, which are already there giving humanitarian assistance and providing other programmes, to build a brand Ireland platform. The Development Assistance Committee's report states the impact is very strong with regard to taxpayer funding and how the agencies work and deliver. There is no shift in policy. We need to have a good mix of multilateral and bilateral engagement. Our bilateral engagement has become more successful because we have very strong ambassadorial teams in the key partner countries. We also have very strong NGOs, and there is a seamless relationship between the two. All of the members of the committee and I have seen this at first hand through various visits to the key partner countries. I am not concerned about transparency. The Ugandan example and the systems that have been put in place since then allow us to ensure that there is an effective approach and a clear managerial line in relation to how we look at the programmes and the impact that they are delivering. If one looks at the key partner countries, because we have embassies there, we have embassy teams. The teams interact with government officials if the programme is being delivered at a governmental level, and they interact with NGOs if the programme is being delivered at NGO level. I am confident that there is a robust mechanism to ensure transparency in how the funding is delivered, but sometimes it is very hard to put a metric on it. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I saw how metrics could be used. One could put a euro in at one end and one would know the impact in terms of intellectual property or if a job was created. However, it is very difficult to measure the number of lives one assists in a process such as we are discussing because aid is more nebulous, but one can see the effect when on is on the ground. When one meets workers from GOAL or Concern, one can see the number of people they feed every day. That is sustaining life, but with development programmes, for example, sustainable agriculture programmes in places such as Tigray, one can see farmers and know that because of programmes supported by Irish Aid through the NGOs, not alone are they sustaining life and limb but they are also layering education and other benefits. Deputy Crowe referred to the example of fistula and the work we are doing through the fistula hospital. There are further opportunities in terms of using the research infrastructure or knowledge we have to assist in garnering greater information in geographies such as Tigray which is part of a country with in excess of 90 million people. We must examine how we can work with people on the ground to get better statistics or to provide good maternal health programmes for women and to encourage them to go to community centres to deliver babies in a healthy space. Such an approach will ensure that we help Ethiopia to wipe out this problem once and for all. That is a key area on which we support action. In response to Deputy Eric Byrne’s question, one has international agreements through multilateral organisations such as the UN. He should forgive me if I have missed the point he made or the question he asked. The Government, through our ambassadorial teams in Geneva and New York, has a monitoring system of the human rights elements and the labour clauses and we are a constituent part of the UN organisations themselves. I refer to the UN High Commission for Refugees, for example. There is a monitoring element in that regard. I will speak from my experience of dealing with the key partner countries we fund in sub-Saharan Africa and Vietnam. The framework for action is an excellent document, if I do say so myself, in terms of the work the people within the Department have done. There are high level outcomes. Three goals have been set out. The first is reduced hunger and stronger resilience. The second is sustainable development and inclusive economic growth and then one has better government, human rights and accountability. Ten outcomes are listed which I will not go into now. Underpinning that are key results areas that one expects. Everything we do has a monitoring effect. Our staff and people in the key partner countries are clued into the policy. If I am representing the Government in an engagement with the president of the Tigrayan region and, for example, we are supporting a programme in Tigray, it means that we must ensure that any programme we support measures up to the goals we have set ourselves on issues such as human rights. There is a mechanism in place. One could take an approach to human rights to the effect that we are pulling the plug on the money if a country does not do X. Our foreign policy must be predicated on the idea that one deepens relationships and builds capacity, for example, from the point of view of education in order that an educated population grows up and has a better chance. We take a long-term view of what we do. There is no better example of engagement at bilateral level than when on a recent visit to China the President had to deliver a very nuanced message about what needs to be done from a human rights point of view. One takes opportunities like that while building up and deepening the relationships. There is a diplomacy to it, if one likes. I hope I have answered the questions adequately. Please let me know if I have not."

13313	SeanSherlock	Labour	15687.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-18 00:00:00	Economic Partnership Agreements: Motions	2	" I thank the Chairman for his expression of congratulations. I will be sure to convey the message to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the team involved in the talks at Stormont House. I am joined by Ms Dympna Hayes and Ms Mary Barrett from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ms Lorraine Benson from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. If there are any very technical questions which I am not able to answer, we have three experts here. I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to discuss the two motions before us, which have been referred to the select committee for consideration. The motions seek Dáil approval of the terms of the EU’s economic partnership agreements with 15 Caribbean countries and with 16 west African states and their two regional economic organisations. As members of the committee are aware, the agreements in question involve mixed competence. This means they cover matters falling within the exclusive competence of the European Union, such as the common commercial policy, as well as issues which remain within the competence of member states, such as development co-operation. For this reason, each EU member state is a party to these two agreements and they can only formally enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states. In Ireland’s case, the approval of Dáil Éireann is required prior to ratification whenever the terms of the agreement involve the possibility of a charge on public funds. As it can take a considerable length of time before ratification procedures are completed in all 28 member states, arrangements are usually made for some aspects of agreements such as these to be applied on a provisional basis pending their formal entry into force at a later date. These two agreements are significant in that they are the first full economic partnership agreement, EPA, signed between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries. Members of the committee will recall that historically ACP countries benefited from unilateral trade preferences with the EU. However, these were deemed to violate World Trade Organization, WTO, rules on the basis that they established unfair discrimination between developing countries. In 2000, the EU and 77 ACP states concluded an agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement. This provided for a new trade and development framework based on EPAs. These are a new type of multilateral agreement combining both trade and wider development issues in a unified framework and containing reciprocal preferences in trade between the EU and ACP states. On this basis, in 2001 the WTO agreed to give a waiver to the EU to continue the unilateral preferences until 31 December 2007 when these agreements were expected to come into effect. The original intention was for the EU to conclude comprehensive EPAs with the six regional groupings of ACP states. Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only the Caribbean was in a position to initial a full EPA before the December 2007 deadline. Twenty-one other ACP countries initialled interim agreements in smaller subgroups or individually. In west Africa, two interim EPAs were concluded with Ghana and the Ivory Coast. The interim agreements have been acting as building blocks to full EPAs, negotiations on which have been ongoing in Africa and the Pacific. Last year, a full EPA was signed with west Africa and negotiations were concluded on two full EPAs with the east African community and southern African development community EPA states. These EPAs are pioneering agreements in the international trading system. They are the first genuinely comprehensive north-south trade agreements which seek to promote sustainable development, build a regional market among developing countries and help eliminate poverty. The agreements seek to put trade at the service of development. The EU’s trade and development partnership with the ACP states stretches back more than 30 years. These agreements build on that partnership. The aim is to make it easier for people and businesses from the EU and the Caribbean and west Africa to invest in and trade with each other, thus helping Caribbean and west African countries grow their economies and create jobs. I will now introduce the EU-CARIFORUM economic partnership agreement to the committee for approval. The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the Caribbean forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific states, CARIFORUM. The CARIFORUM members party to this agreement are Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. The agreement was signed in the Caribbean on 15 October 2008 and Guyana signed on 21 October 2008. It entered into provisional application on 29 December 2008. The EU worked together with the Haitian authorities to adjust some of that country’s tariff commitments in light of its specific needs as a least developed country. This made it possible for Haiti to sign the agreement on 10 December 2009. As of now, it has been ratified by 17 EU member states and eight CARIFORUM states. The agreement comprises six parts. Part I, trade partnership for sustainable development, sets out the objectives of the agreement with specific articles on sustainable development, regional integration and monitoring. It recognises development co-operation as an essential factor of the agreement with the EU to support implementation of the agreement via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments. EU member states undertake to provide support via its development policies and instruments, in accordance with complementarity and aid effectiveness principles. Part II, trade and trade related matters, removed tariffs and quotas on CARIFORUM exports to the EU immediately. From the Caribbean side, there is a gradual opening of markets covering 61.1% of the value of CARIFORUM imports from the EU over ten years, 82.7% over 15 years and 86.9 % over 25 years. The agreement contains considerable flexibility for the Caribbean countries to exclude sensitive products and industries from liberalisation. The main exclusions from tariff cuts are agricultural and processed agricultural products, some chemicals, furniture and other industrial products. The agreement provides for rephasing of the CARIFORUM liberalisation schedule if serious difficulties arise in respect of specific imports. It also provides for possible modification of the CARIFORUM commitments, having regard to the special development needs of nine of the CARIFORUM countries. Part II also includes provisions on investment, trade in services and electronic commerce. The EU is making substantial concessions in the services sector, opening up new markets for Caribbean companies, investors and professionals to offer services in the EU in areas like international phone calls, banking and architectural services, including new services sectors such as entertainers, chefs de cuisine and fashion models. In turn, CARIFORUM countries have also made offers, in particular in export-oriented and infrastructure sectors key for their development, such as telecommunications, transport, tourism, manufacturing and environmental services. Part II covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff measures. It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to customs and trade facilitation, agriculture and fisheries, technical barriers to trade as well as sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The agreement seeks to improve the business climate and boost trade. To this end, Part II also covers commitments in trade related issues such as competition, innovation and intellectual property, public procurement and the protection of personal data, along with complementary co-operation and assistance. There are provisions to protect and uphold environmental standards and workers’ rights while guaranteeing the rights of the CARIFORUM countries to regulate and manage their own affairs. On the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol I, Caribbean countries now benefit from improved rules of origin that support the development of industries that import materials to make goods for onward export to the EU. This is important for industries such as processed food or fisheries which might import raw materials from outside the Caribbean. Part III outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement. Part IV provides for general exceptions, for example, in the areas of security and taxation. Part V provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives. Part VI covers sundry general and final provisions. Last July, the Caribbean EPA ministerial joint council reviewed the first five years of implementation of the agreement. A study conducted as part of the review found that efforts to implement the EPA were hampered by the global recession which hit just as it was being signed in 2008. Our Caribbean EPA partners are all small island developing states and were particularly impacted, given their openness to the global financial and economic system and high dependence on a narrow range of income-generating sectors such as tourism. Nonetheless, the study found a positive EPA effect for some agricultural and industrial exports from the Dominican Republic and for products such as rice, frozen shrimp, citrus and rum in the other CARIFORUM countries. The study identified five big ticket items to be addressed. The first of these is ratification by all CARIFORUM and EU states. With my attendance at the committee today, I hope Ireland can play its part in addressing the recommendation. Other actions recommended are continued support to the regional and national EPA units and substantive discussion on a regional development fund, and continued engagement with the private and public sector on the EPA. The other two recommended actions have already been addressed, namely, the establishment of a sub-committee on development and the convening of the consultative committee, and the establishment of a monitoring task force. The July EPA CARIFORUM-EU ministerial council concluded that in spite of the challenges which had so far confronted implementation, the EPA has tremendous potential for contributing to the sustainable development of CARIFORUM states. Between 2008 and 2013, the EU, including Ireland through our contributions to the European Development Fund, supported a €75 million EPA implementation programme for governments and businesses. This was part of a wider €165 million EU package promoting regional integration in the Caribbean. Additional support was provided bilaterally by the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. From 2014 to 2020, the EU will provide a further €102 million for region-wide development programmes, with regional integration and EPA implementation among their main goals. This is one of three focal sectors in a package of €346 million, the others being climate change and crime and security. Implementation in all three sectors will be boosted by the work of the Caribbean Investment Facility, which will receive €135 million to blend grant resources with additional funding, notably from European and regional finance institutions and the private sector, to facilitate the mobilisation of much-needed key infrastructure investment. I introduce the EU-West African EPA to the committee for approval. The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the west African states, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA. The 16 west African states are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. The agreement was signed by Ireland on 12 December 2014 and in west Africa on 15 December 2014. All EU member states and 13 of the 16 west African states have signed. Gambia, Nigeria and Mauritania have yet to sign. The agreement comprises seven main parts. Part I, entitled ""Economic and trade partnership for sustainable development,"" sets out the objectives and principles of the agreement, with specific articles on economic growth, sustainable development and regional integration. Part II, entitled ""Trade policy and questions concerning trade,"" removes tariffs and quotas on west African exports to the EU immediately. West Africa will liberalise 75% of tariff lines over 20 years, with no liberalisation in the first five years. A wide range of west African goods considered most sensitive are permanently excluded from the requirement to liberalise, ranging from agricultural goods to industrial goods and including the following: meat and poultry; processed meat; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; eggs; cocoa and cocoa preparations; cement; and textiles and apparel. At the same time, the progressive elimination of tariffs on goods such as equipment and other inputs will make them cheaper for local businesses. In addition to this gradual and controlled liberalisation, west African countries will be able to avail of safeguards if imports of liberalised products are increasing too quickly and jeopardising local markets or where food security is threatened. Special protection is also foreseen for infant industries. In addition, the agreement recognises the special development needs of west African countries and provides scope to change their tariff commitments. Part II of the agreement also covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff barriers. It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to the following: technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures; facilitation of trade, customs co-operation and mutual administrative assistance; and agriculture, fisheries and food security. Specifically on agriculture and fisheries, the EU will not subsidise exports of EU farm products to the region, and a high-level dialogue on agricultural policies will be established, creating transparency and improving coherence on agricultural matters within the region and with the EU. In conclusion, on the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol 1, west African countries will benefit from improved rules of origin which will allow them to source materials from other countries to produce duty-free exports to the EU. Part III of the agreement, entitled ""Cooperation for implementation of development and achievement of the objectives of the EPA,"" provides for support from the EU via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments and from EU member states in accordance with aid effectiveness, co-ordination and complementarity principles. The agreement links support to the EPA development programme, known by its French acronym PAPED. The PAPED was developed during the negotiations by the west African parties. The conclusions of the EU Council of Ministers of 10 May 2010 and 17 March 2014 confirmed the commitment of the EU and its member states, with more than €8.2 billion provided in the period 2010 to 2014 and a commitment by the EU to provide at least €6.5 billion for the period 2015 to 2020. The latter amount corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities. Of the €3 billion to be delivered by the EU institutions, the delivery of almost €1.2 billion by 2016 has already been committed to. Following discussions with west African countries, support will focus on key priority sectors relating to trade, including agriculture, infrastructure, energy and capacity building for developing civil society. The European Commission is in discussions with member states and the west African countries to co-ordinate the response to the PAPED, and Ireland is taking part in these ongoing discussions to determine how we can best assist in implementation of the agreement. Part IV of the agreement outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement. Part V provides for general exceptions - for example, in security and taxation. Part VI provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives. Part VII covers final provisions. These include a provision for the suspension of trade benefits where any party fails to fulfil its obligations on human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance under the Cotonou Agreement. There is also a revision clause providing for the agreement to be assessed or reviewed every five years while also allowing review as required. I thank the committee for its time. I am happy to recommend these two agreements for approval. They present a strategy to assist our Caribbean and west African partners to build larger markets and foster trade in goods and services as well as stimulate investment. They reaffirm the EU's commitment to a close trade and development partnership with the two regions. I encourage the committee to recommend to Dáil Éireann that the two proposed motions be approved so that Ireland is in a position to notify the Council of the completion of its ratification procedures. I am happy to take questions, and if there are any very difficult questions that I cannot answer, I have a very competent team of experts with me."
13314	SeanSherlock	Labour	15687.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-18 00:00:00	Economic Partnership Agreements: Motions	6	 I will address those questions but there are technical aspects to them with respect to poultry, sugar and so on. In terms of how we trade with developing countries, I am satisfied that this country's foreign policy with respect to Irish Aid policy is clearly structured in a way that ensures we trade on the basis of such trade being a sustainable relationship. That feeds into our position in terms of an EU position on these negotiations. Specific reference was made to sugar and I want to make a broad point in response to that. I hail from the town of Mallow and if people check the historical debates of this House, they will note my surname is possibly synonymous with some of those historical debates. A political decision was taken at Council of Ministers level on the future of that industry. I take the point made by Deputy Durkan regarding the ACP Cotonou Agreement with respect to the broader sugar industry, globally speaking. The global market for sugar has transpired in a way in which it was not sold to us at the time. I would make that objective point. I want to defer to Ms Mary Barrett. Dare I say it, the people accompanying me are global experts on these agreements and we are lucky to have the benefit of their expertise here. If there is further political response needed, Ms Barrett can defer to me.
13315	SeanSherlock	Labour	15687.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-18 00:00:00	Economic Partnership Agreements: Motions	17	" With your permission, Chairman, we will reply as a team. I wish to make a broad point about EU trade policy, to which we subscribe. I refer members to ""Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy"", a document published last month by the European Commission. It contains a foreword by Cecilia Malmström, the EU Trade Commissioner. The new approach ""also involves using trade agreements and trade preference programmes as levers to promote, around the world, values like sustainable development, human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption. We will use future EU agreements to improve the responsibility of supply chains."" In terms of seeking to have a debate on the issue, and referring to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point, I agree that there is a need to discuss the wider EU policy implications of trade agreements of this nature in the House and in this committee. I will do anything I can to facilitate such discussions. If one is to interpret this forward, there is definitely a shift in the thinking by the Commission on trade policy and I encourage members to engage with that document. I am aware of the position of CONCORD in respect of the west African farmers' organisation. I note that Germany, one of the countries that was mentioned, has signed up to this agreement. The focus of CONCORD with regard to the west African farmers was on unfair competition from EU agricultural products, fiscal losses, trade diversion towards the EU and the undermining of regional integration. On unfair competition from EU agricultural products, west Africa decided internally to exclude almost all agricultural products from liberalisation. We are confident that if difficulties arise, the agreement also contains robust safeguards which west African countries can use. Mary Barrett referred previously to the Irish Aid report which kicked the tyres, as it were, on this. That was in 2012. On the issue of fiscal losses, there was a general tendency to over-estimate the direct fiscal losses resulting from an EPA, but it was found that the greatest fiscal impacts were to be expected in west and central Africa. The report suggested possible strategies to address this. One was playing with liberalisation schedules in the EPA, second was direct compensation, third was accompanying assistance leading to higher tax collection through economic growth and fourth was using EPAs as a catalyst for wider tax reform to broaden the tax base and increase compliance. All of these strategies have been accommodated with the agreement with the west African countries, taking sensitivity for revenue purposes into account in their excluded product lists, and the EPA development programme, or PAPED, to deliver assistance in this regard and provision for dialogue on tax reforms and associated support from the European Union. It was the recognition of potential for fiscal losses to be a bigger issue in west Africa that led to the detailed discussions on the PAPED and the associated commitments outlined in the Council Conclusions in 2010 and 2014. The European Commission has clearly stated in its latest fact sheet on the EPA that the amount allocated under the PAPED corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities and that the EU will continue helping west Africa throughout the implementation process. The EU support will continue beyond 2019. On trade diversion, which was another point raised by CONCORD, under the agreement west African states have agreed to grant each other at least the same treatment as they are granting the European Union, which speaks to a point made by Deputy Eric Byrne. This is designed to encourage regional integration and prevent trade diversion by EU products. On the issue of undermining regional integration, the negotiation of the EPA actively supported integration in west Africa as the 16 countries and two regional organisations define common positions and policies on the issues at stake. The west African market access offer to the EU is fully aligned with the ECOWAS common external tariff adopted in October 2013 which lays the basis for the ECOWAS customs union. The implementation of the EPA and the ECOWAS-CET are going hand-in-hand and they will mutually reinforce each other. Regional integration will be enhanced as the agreement's provisions make customs procedures easier and more efficient. Issues were raised regarding the Irish dairy sector, exporting certain types of products and whether those products had been lessened in quality in any way. That is something on which we need further engagement. If there are specific and concrete examples of that, we would wish to hear about them. I am confident, and I speak objectively on this, that there is transparent production from farm to fork with anything we export. We adhere to the highest standards in that regard and we are bound by EU rules regarding the standards of those products, whether they are exported within the European Union or externally. The use of the farm to fork motto is something Deputy Smith might have fashioned when he was Minister with responsibility for agriculture. My central point is that we must be careful about assertions being made about Irish product going to third countries. If there is a contention that some of those products are being undermined or devalued in any way to meet export goals and bottom line and profit margins, we must engage further on that. However, we are absolutely clear in terms of Irish Aid policy and Irish foreign policy. Irish Aid policy has always been about ensuring that whatever we bring to internal trade negotiations, in terms of an Irish position vis-à-vis a final EU position, it has been on the basis that the best rules of probity apply and that it is not a paternalistic trade relationship but a relationship of equals. That is inherent in Irish Aid and in Irish foreign policy. Integrating values into EU trade policy also means using trade policy as a lever to promote European values with all parties around the world. Trade agreements and trade preference programmes can be vehicles to enhance respect for sustainable development, human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption. The Commission is saying that it will use future EU agreements to better address those issues. For example, for the first time the Commission has proposed to include anti-corruption rules in EU free trade agreements. I hope we will have more time in this committee to debate that policy, ""Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy"". With regard to TTIP, before engaging on the current Irish farmers' response to TTIP, it is important, with the Chairman's indulgence, to give a technical brief as to the current position of those trade negotiations. Sometimes there is a perception that it has been locked down and absolutely concluded but that is not the case. There are some political points in respect of the concerns of Irish farmers with regard to the TTIP rules. If I may defer to Ms Benson, she might give a current overview of TTIP."

13327	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	2	 I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss the motion I have proposed and which has been referred to the select committee for consideration. The motion seeks Dáil approval of the terms of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, of the other part. Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN. Co-operation between the EU and ASEAN members is currently based on the 1980 co-operation agreement between the European Community and ASEAN, which was extended to Vietnam in 1999, and the 1995 agreement between the European Community and Vietnam. In 2007, the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate a framework agreement on partnership and co-operation, PCA, with Vietnam. The PCA was signed by all parties on 27 June 2012 and represents an important step towards enhanced political and economic engagement by the EU in the south-east Asia region. It replaces agreements on co-operation between the EU and Vietnam dating from the mid- and late 1990s. The new agreement is intended to strengthen political, economic and sectoral co-operation across a wide range of policy fields, including peace and security, conflict prevention, crisis management, trade, environment, energy, science and technology, as well as good governance, tourism and culture, migration, counter-terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime. It also aims to further enhance co-operation in responding to global challenges, where both Vietnam and the EU are playing an increasingly important role. Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and Vietnam, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement. It is called a “mixed competence” agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence, while others remain within the competence of the member states. Vietnam has now become one of the EU's main partners in south-east Asia. In 2014, the EU was the second trading partner for Vietnam after China, not including trade within ASEAN, representing 10% of total Vietnamese trade. The EU was Vietnam’s second export destination, after the US, with the EU purchasing as much as 18% of Vietnam's global exports. In 2014, EU-Vietnam trade in goods was worth more than €28.2 billion, with €22.1 billion of imports from Vietnam into the EU and €6.2 billion of exports from the EU to Vietnam. Vietnam's key export items to the EU include telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing, coffee, rice, seafood, and furniture. EU exports to Vietnam, meanwhile, are dominated by high-tech products including electrical machinery and equipment, aircraft, vehicles and pharmaceutical products. Total bilateral trade in services amounted in 2013 to €2.9 billion, with a slight surplus for the EU. The EU is one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam. In 2013, EU investors committed more than €500 million in foreign direct investment and thus it remains Vietnam's sixth largest foreign investor partner. Since 2013, Vietnam has been the EU's fourth most important trading partner among the ten ASEAN member states, surpassing the EU’s bilateral trade with Indonesia. The conclusion of the PCA facilitated the launch of negotiations on a free trade agreement, FTA, with Vietnam. The EU is looking forward to the realisation of the potential of the trade and investment principles established in the PCA through this future EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, which will bring two-way trade and investment to new levels. The FTA negotiations started in 2012 and agreement was reached in principle in August 2015, with some technical issues and legal text just finalised. On 2 December, the European Commissioner for Trade and the Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade issued a declaration announcing the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the FTA, which also referenced the soon-to-be-ratified partnership and co-operation agreement as representing milestones on the path towards a maturing comprehensive political partnership. Signature of the FTA will take place at a technical level, most likely in January 2016. The aim is to have the FTA ratified as soon as possible in order that the agreement can enter into force in early 2018. The partnership and co-operation agreement is to enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the other of the completion of the relevant domestic legal procedures necessary for its entry into force. As the agreement involves mixed competence, it must be signed and ratified by all 28 member states. Some 24 member states already have ratified the agreement. Four member states, including Ireland, have yet to ratify. The other three are France, Italy and Greece. In Ireland’s case, the approval of Dáil Éireann is required prior to ratification of the agreement. On 23 February 2015, the European Parliament was officially requested by the Council to give its consent to the draft Council decision on the framework agreement for the comprehensive partnership and co-operation agreement, PCA, between the EU and Vietnam. This debate will take place in the European Parliament’s plenary session today, 16 December. Only after the ratification by all member states and by the European Parliament may the Council finally ratify the PCA and the PCA can enter into force. The ratification of the EU-Vietnam agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Vietnam but charts a course for much-needed political and economic reforms. Through Ireland’s ratification of this agreement, we will show our own support for the people of Vietnam. The EU will provide assistance to Vietnam with the implementation of the reform measures. In terms of financial assistance the EU, between the years 2007 and 2013, made available €298.4 million to Vietnam to support national reforms and modernisation efforts. The EU will continue to provide assistance in the current and future years and has approved a new multi-annual indicative programme, for the period 2014 to 2020, of €400 million to support Vietnam's socioeconomic development. In conclusion, I thank the select committee again. I hope this motion will meet the committee’s approval and that Dáil Éireann will approve the terms of the agreement in order that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future. For the information of the Chairman and members, I am accompanied by Kevin Dowling, director of the Department's bilateral co-operation unit, and Paul Griffin, who is on my left, as well as Maeve Collins, regional director for the Asia-Pacific unit and a former ambassador to Vietnam, and Fiona Nic Dhonnacha, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific unit.
13328	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	8	 I thank the Chairman. Vietnam is showing increased interest in importing agricultural produce from the European Union, that is, from individual member states. This should present an opportunity for Ireland under the free trade agreement, FTA, but in particular with regard to access to the Vietnamese market for pork. I have to hand a note that tells me the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has sent, relatively recently, a chief veterinary officer letter that expressed interest in beef access, as well as a proposed draft veterinary health certificate for beef. In addition, separate letters have been sent in respect of sheepmeat and pork offal. The Government is awaiting replies to these letters and will then take it from there. As the Chairman is aware, Irish milk product has been in the Vietnamese market since August 2015 and it is expected that dairy products on offer within the Vietnamese market will increase significantly in 2016. This outline will give members an insight regarding the potential there. On the aid programme, Vietnam is a key partner country I have not visited but the Government remains firmly committed to the aid programme. I understand the Chairman has visited.
13329	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	10	 I thank the Chairman. Vietnam is Irish Aid's only key partner country located outside sub-Saharan Africa and the Government remains committed there. I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has been there and that a delegation from that committee, led by its Vice Chairman, travelled in early March to Vietnam where they visited Irish Aid programmes in Quang Tri and Ho Chi Minh City. Ireland's commitment to the Irish Aid programme is consistent. If the Chairman wishes, I can ask Ms Maeve Collins, or Mr. Kevin Dowling, rather, to give the committee further insight on the status of the programme in real and financial terms.
13330	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	19	 I will endeavour to answer all of the questions.
13331	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	21	 If I do not answer them comprehensively, I might defer. There are some specific questions on certain areas of Vietnam of which I would not necessarily have knowledge and on which I will defer to others. On the issue of human rights, for the information of the committee, only yesterday the EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue took place. It is an important mechanism for us at both bilateral and multilateral levels, but through the prism of the European Union, to have a very frank, open discussion with the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues. As members know, this is led by the European Union, but our embassy in Hanoi is represented. Let me provide an insight into some of the issues discussed yesterday. The dialogue is broadly constructive but with an emphasis on concrete co-operation in the protection and promotion of human rights. Some of the key areas we have flagged are judicial and legal reforms, freedom of expression, the rights of persons of concern, and space for stakeholders promoting human rights in the civil society space. Also included are multilateral issues, including UN mechanisms, and HRC membership and co-operation. Vietnam has now ratified the UN Convention against Torture. This happened earlier in the year. The European Union offered some technical assistance on this and on implementation. The European Union welcomed the reduction in the number of crimes eligible for the death penalty. Seven offences were removed from the list. The Union recalled its support for a moratorium on Vietnam. Vietnam indicated it has focused its judicial and legal reforms on protecting and enhancing rights linked to the millennium development goals and vulnerable social groups. Also in the area of human rights, there was an opportunity to raise a number of individual cases, particularly those of prisoners and other persons of concern. The European Union also raised the matter of police brutality and the growing number of attacks on human rights and civil society activists. Ireland, through our embassy and in co-operation with other EU embassies, consulates and missions, is vigilant in the area of human rights. On the broader question on the scrutiny of trade agreements, free trade agreements, or in this case a partnership and co-operation agreement, time should always be found for greater exploration of agreements. This committee is the obvious place for that, but I take the broader view that Ireland, through its economic diplomacy in terms of increasing its trade potential across a broad range of sectors, should not jettison the need to ensure that we remain vigilant with our EU partners regarding the very issues discussed here, such as human rights. By continuing to co-operate economically, there is no variance between the needs of our development co-operation programme and the need to ensure we trade substantially on a bilateral level, or through the European Union, with countries such as Vietnam. We all see the potential in Vietnam. The Irish taxpayers' commitment to the Irish Aid budget for 2015 amounts to €12 million, which is substantial by any standard in terms of mapping a single bilateral relationship from an Irish Aid perspective. That allows us to work with the Vietnamese Government, for instance, on its own socioeconomic development strategy in providing general budget support. That accounts for resilience in economic activity and also for sustainable economic growth, which is one of the key pillars of our own foreign policy and Irish Aid policy. That allows us some degree of traction at bilateral level regarding workers' rights or exploitation. It allows us to ensure that we fund programmes that are acting with probity with regard to the treatment of Vietnamese workers. However, there is obviously a long way to go in the realisation of full rights, and we must remain vigilant in this respect. I would argue that we do so. On the question of why the agreement was signed in 2012, there is no particular reason. I would not necessarily regard it as a delay because we have excellent bilateral relationships. That we are dealing with this now is not a reflection on our support for Vietnam. We continue to ensure we maintain the investment in strengthening political and trade links with Vietnam for the future. We are also awaiting the consent of the European Parliament. The matter is being discussed in the European Parliament today. Therefore, there is no question of Ireland holding up any progress. There were some very specific questions on the church, particular geographical areas and the protection of the environment. There was a question on anti-dumping measures. Before I defer to Mr. Kevin Dowling and, perhaps, Ms Collins, who can give some insight based on her in-country experience, and noting what was said by Deputy Crowe about the AWEPA meeting, it must be noted that I approved yesterday funding for our commitment to AWEPA in Ireland. There are anti-dumping measures within the free trade agreement. Perhaps Mr. Dowling could elaborate on these. I will defer to Ms Collins on some of the very specific issues Deputy Eric Byrne raised.
13332	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	23	 There were some questions on Article 5, so we will address the technical aspects of that.
13333	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	29	 Can I get clarification from Deputy Crowe on dumping? Have specific examples of dumping been referenced by NGOs or civil society?
13334	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	31	 Okay.
13335	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	34	 I think so, too.
13336	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	38	 I will ask Ms Collins to discuss the trigger mechanism further.
13337	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	40	 Deputy Durkan sought clarification on aid for trade. It is widely known that Ireland does not tie its aid to trade. We see our bilateral partnership with Vietnam as one whereby one works through general Government support for programmes to ensure economic sustainability and raise standards within the local country. At the same time, through diplomacy and trade missions, we continue to examine trade opportunities that exist between both countries. We do that in a mutually respectful way. In the relatively short time that I have been in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my experience is that from a trade promotion viewpoint the relationship is not paternalistic. It is one where there is mutual respect. We continue to work on the aid programme and the development agenda, while at the same time trying to enhance economic and social co-operation. It must be recognised that the social and cultural elements of this agreement are also important. Based on despatches from Hanoi, there is a strong recognition of the need to develop that relationship as much as the economic one. I cannot speak for other countries' specific aid arrangements, but I can say that Ireland does not tie aid to trade. It is a fundamental pillar of our Irish Aid policy.
13338	SeanSherlock	Labour	15715.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	43	 I take the Deputy's point. It is well telegraphed that there is a certain dynamic between certain larger countries and their relationships with sub-Saharan Africa and other regions globally. In terms of long-term sustainable relationship building, I have emphasised sub-Saharan Africa in the past 12 months or so to enhance trade co-operation and to consider the opportunities and challenges that exist. Sometimes there is a tendency to regard sub-Saharan Africa, or Africa as a whole, as a homogenous block, but it is as varied as the European Union if one takes that as a comparable block. Our historical relationship with Africa is different from the relationship with Vietnam and that is for historical reasons in the main. I am not uncomfortable with the idea that, notwithstanding the fact that there are certain issues in relation to human rights, enhancing trade, cultural, multilateral and bilateral links provides the leverage to continue to have frank dialogue such as the one which took place yesterday on human rights. That can only benefit the bilateral relationship in the long term. I have found that relationships are often sustained by visits by Oireachtas Members and Ministers. There have been quite a few ministerial visits and visits by committee members. The Committee of Public Accounts was out there recently. It is true that person-to-person, parliamentarian-to-parliamentarian and business-to-business contact is where one gains on the relationship. That is where the terms of trade become more beneficial. I do not see us tying our aid at all. Our philosophy, based on the fundamental principle of not tying aid, has allowed us to send difficult messages which needed to be imparted, albeit respectfully, to various bilateral partners.

13351	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	2	 I thank the Vice Chairman and the members of the select committee for the opportunity to discuss the motion proposed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, which has been referred to it for consideration. I am joined today by Caoimhe Ní Chonchuir, Paul O'Hara, Elisa Cavacece and Karl Finnegan from the Department. The motion seeks Dáil approval of the terms of the agreement establishing an association between the European Union and its member states, on the one hand, and Central America, on the other. The six countries which form Central America are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Diplomatic relations between the European Union and Central America were formally established with the San José dialogue in 1984 and were driven partly by the desire of Europe to help bring to an end the political violence and instability that afflicted the region at that time. Europe and Central America concluded a framework co-operation agreement in 1993 and a political dialogue and co-operation agreement in 2003. In 2007, the European Council authorised the Commission to begin negotiations on an association agreement. Talks on the agreement concluded in 2010 following the EU-CELAC summit in Madrid. The association agreement was signed by all parties in Honduras in June 2012 and received the approval of the European Parliament in December of that year. Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and the republics of Central America, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement. It is called a mixed competence agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence while others remain within the competence of member states. The agreement contains three pillars: political dialogue, co-operation and trade. It was agreed that the trade pillar of the agreement, which involves European Union rather than member state competence, would be provisionally applied pending the ratification by all EU member states of the agreement. The trade elements of this agreement therefore came into effect during 2013. To date, all six Central American republics have ratified the agreement, while on the EU side, 12 member states, including Ireland, have yet to notify the European Commission that they have completed all internal procedures necessary for the ratification of the agreement. For Ireland, receiving the approval of the Dáil is the last step of our domestic procedures necessary for its entry into force. I will turn now to the substance of the agreement. This agreement has real value for the European Union and its people and for the people of Central America. There are significant economic advantages for both sides. The trade pillar of the agreement will eliminate high tariffs, tackle technical barriers to trade, open up services markets and public procurement markets and protect EU geographical indications. For Europe, this means new business opportunities for European exporters and investors. For Central America, it means access to the European market of 500 million consumers and a chance to move up the industrial value chain and create better quality jobs for workers. Over time, under the agreement import duties on industrial goods and fish will be eliminated. It is estimated that the overall value of tariff elimination on European exports will be in the region of €90 million. Agricultural trade will also open up, while protecting sensitive products in both regions. Central American exporters of fruit and vegetables stand to gain significantly from the agreement. Conversely, key European exports such as whiskey and wine will enjoy zero tariffs. This is good news for the producers of Irish whiskey which we already export in significant quantities to Panama. The agreement also simplifies customs procedures. All Central American countries will, within three years, use a single customs document, thereby reducing the administrative burden for European exporters and traders within the region. In addition, our partners in Central America have committed to removing barriers to services, trade and investment, which will make the region more attractive for European investors. When fully enacted, the reduced costs of trade should have a beneficial impact on growth and job creation in all Central American countries and it is expected that the agreement will have a poverty-reducing effect overall in the region. EU data suggest Central America’s GDP could grow by over €2.5 billion as a result of the agreement. Economic resilience will also be improved by reducing reliance on the United States as a destination for Central American exports. In 2014, the first full year in which the trade pillar of the association agreement was in effect, goods trade between the European Union and Central America was worth €10.5 billion, an increase of 1.2% on the figure for the previous year. The European Union is Central America’s second largest trading partner after the United States, excluding intra-regional trade. In 2014 there was a trade surplus of €1.7 billion in favour of Central America. The chief imports to the European Union from Central America are data processing machines, coffee, bananas and pineapples. The main EU exports to Central America are machinery, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and steel products. I reassure the committee that the agreement contains very strong safeguards for human rights, the rule of law, democratic principles, respect for the environment and workers’ rights. The very first article states human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles constitute an “essential element” of the agreement. This means that, in a situation where a government violates this essential element, any of the parties would be able to react unilaterally by taking proportional measures that could go as far as the suspension of the whole agreement. This provision is a powerful statement of our commitment to uphold our values. The co-operation pillar of the agreement commits the two sides to co-operate to achieve full compliance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the building and strengthening of democracy. It commits the parties to work together in promoting good governance, fighting against corruption and supporting the participation of civil society in decision-making. The agreement has sustainable development at its heart and commits both sides to respect, implement and enforce a series of universal standards for labour rights and the environment, including the eight core conventions of the International Labour Organization. The agreement contains a binding arbitration mechanism to ensure these commitments are respected, which can be triggered unilaterally by the European Union or any of the Central American countries, even against the will of the country concerned. In regard to oversight, the agreement foresees the creation of a committee of parliamentarians, composed of MEPs and Deputies from the Central American parliaments. The committee will have the right to demand information and make recommendations to the European Commission and Central American governments. The agreement will also establish a civil society dialogue forum and a consultative committee, designed to allow civil society to hold government parties accountable. I now turn to what the agreement means for Ireland. Many Irish people feel an affinity with Central America. From the late 1970s up to the 1990s, a solidarity movement grew up in Ireland in reaction to the political upheaval and civil wars affecting El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras and many Irish people travelled to the region in that period as volunteers. There is also a tradition of Irish missionaries in Central America, particularly from the 1970s onwards. Our relations with Central America received a significant boost with the visit of President Higgins to El Salvador and Costa Rica in 2013, where he received a very warm reception. We do not have an embassy in Central America and most Central American republics are accredited to Ireland from their embassies in London. There is, therefore, significant potential to develop our relations, which can only be assisted by an agreement such as this. Ireland’s trade with the region is small but growing. Ireland’s chief exports to the region include medicines, infant food, medical equipment, industrial machinery, computers and alcoholic beverages. Our chief imports from Central America include vegetables and fruit, coffee, sugar and honey. In 2013, total trade in goods between Ireland and the region was worth €106 million. In 2014, the first full year of operation of the free trade agreement, total trade grew to €126 million, representing growth of almost 20% in our trade. Figures from January to November 2015 show continued strong growth in Irish exports, particularly in trade with Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica. While it is not possible to prove causation, trade data seem to indicate that there is at least a correlation between the entry into force of the trade elements of the association agreement in 2013 and recent growth in Ireland’s trade with the region. This agreement will provide a framework for strengthening the relationship between the European Union and Central America in trade, policy dialogue and co-operation. It provides a platform for bi-regional engagement on issues concerning health, the environment, climate change, energy, education, employment and science and technology and will allow us to work together to tackle global challenges, such as migration, terrorism, money laundering, organised crime and corruption. It contains important safeguards for human rights, workers’ rights and the environment. The ratification of the EU-Central America Association Agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Central America but also charts a course for political and economic reforms. Through Ireland’s ratification of this agreement, we will show our support for the people of Central America. I thank the committee again. I hope this motion will meet with the committee’s approval and that Dáil Éireann will approve the terms of the agreement so that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future. I am happy to take questions at this point.
13352	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	7	 I wish to thank Deputies in general terms for their comments. I will endeavour to reply to some of the issues that have been raised. As regards labour rights and the universal standards that apply to them, the eight core principles of the ILO are part of that agreement. As regards the main provisions of the agreement concerning human rights, if one examines the various articles inherent in the agreement, for instance, article 1 deals specifically with protections around human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. Climate change is inherent in articles 50 and 51, so there are specific references to responsibilities in respect of those issues. It is evident through Irish Aid support that we have committed more than €17 million since 2012 to this region. We do much work through our partners, including Trócaire, which is a key example in terms of capacity-building to assist the people who are most directly affected, namely, the primary producers. We do much work at ground level in that respect. Articles 41 to 46 specifically refer to addressing poverty, inequality and exclusion. Provisions are made through specific programmes in that regard. There is a programmatic element which ensures decent work for all, respect for workers' rights, equal access to education and public health and special initiatives aimed at vulnerable groups such as indigenous communities, something on which we are very strong from an Irish perspective. Let us look at the trade terms. As I said, they favour Central America in trading with the European Union. In that sense, we are on a good footing. It means that primary producers trade in coffee and fruits, in particular. As Deputy Eric Byrne said, in Ireland we are good consumers of coffee. In the case of Fairtrade Ireland, Java Republic, Bewleys and other brands, not to be too brand specific at this committee meeting, there is a very strong impetus towards purchasing unroasted beans directly from producers through intermediaries but giving a fair price to the primary producer. This is now inherent within the Irish consciousness when we consume coffee. We have moved a long way from buying jars of instant coffee.
13353	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	9	 As a nation, we are now very discerning when it comes to ensuring a proper dividend is paid to the worker who operates in the field. We are satisfied that the agreement contains protections in that regard. I will restate the following for the benefit of the committee. In 2014 there was a trade surplus of €1.7 billion in favour of Central America. That shows that the trade terms favour Central America. Ireland is growing its level of trade on a bilateral basis. On climate change, Ms Cavacece might want to reiterate what the nature of the relationship is with NGOs from an Irish Aid perspective. We are confident that everything we are doing in respect of the agreement corresponds with our foreign affairs policy on inclusive economic growth. I will come back to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on her question on Belize. I am pretty sure Ms Ní Chonchúir has the answer. On Cuba, I met Dr. Herrera in the past few weeks and we had a very positive discussion on how we could enhance and improve the relationship between Ireland and Cuba across a range of sectors, including medicines, pharmaceuticals and education. Work is ongoing between him and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that regard. If there are specific areas about which the committee has ideas, I can assure members that the Department operates an open door policy when it comes to areas in which we can enhance co-operation. When we talk about equivalence, there are very specific measures in the areas of food safety, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, energy, mining, tourism, science and technology, as well as governance in terms of taxation and small to medium-sized enterprises. We are trying to reduce technical barriers to trade. Sometimes there is a certain connotation surrounding the liberalisation of markets, but we are satisfied that the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated is such that there will be very stringent checks and balances explicit within it. Also, there will be a parliamentary oversight function through the European Parliament. If one also has directly elected Members of the European Parliament overseeing these agreements, it means that when issues arise, they will come to the fore through the European Parliament.
13354	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	EU Framework Agreement: Motion	16	 I would not disagree with anything Deputy Smith has said. I share some of his concerns, as do certain European member states, on the dispute mechanism. However, we must remember that this agreement is far from being concluded. We are currently engaged in the 12th round of talks and a mechanism has been proposed by the European Union on the investment courts but we are a long way off an agreement. I absolutely concur with Deputy Smith on the protection of agriculture standards in particular. We have exacting food health, food provision and food production standards. There is no way we would want those in any way diminished. Agriculture is a key component of our export strategy. I totally agree with the points made by Deputy Smith, which have now been put on the record. However, an agreement is still a long way off. On the procedure around the negotiation of TTIP, for an association agreement, it is not just about trade as we are talking about it today. There is also political dialogue and co-operation given TTIP is a trade agreement. Mr. Karl Finnegan, who represents the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is with us here today and if the committee would like a little insight - after the meeting - on where negotiations are from a technical point of view, we would be happy to facilitate that. In political terms, we are a long way from an agreement and we all, as parliamentarians, have concerns about the dispute mechanism and the power of corporations relative to member states.

This amendment proposes to provide that skill levels in addition to length of service be also taken into account in setting pay rates.  A Government amendment to section 12, amendment No. 68, provides that proposals for EROs may provide for a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned, as well as the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned.

In future, JLCs will be permitted to set out a basic adult rate and two supplementary minimum rates.  This will subsequently reduce the number of rates while acknowledging the freedom of JLCs to establish two higher hourly rates based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned or the attainment of recognised standards or skills.  Sub-minimum rates expressed as fixed percentages of the adult basic rate will apply as in the case of the national minimum wage to employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  All other rates of pay will be agreed at firm level.  The effect of the proposed Sinn Féin amendment would be to remove the ""sub-minima"" elements from the scope of proposals for remuneration from a JLC with only the adult rates remaining. On amendment No. 70, section 12 provides for a number of amendments that are required to the legislative provisions relating to the formulation of proposals for employment regulation orders by joint labour committees, including in relation to the principles and policies that should guide the formulation of such proposals on the fixing of remuneration and conditions of employment.  In this context, section 12 inserts into the 1946 Act a new section 42A(5) which clarifies the relationship between the adult wages rate that may be proposed by a JLC and the sub-minimum rates under EROs expressed as the same fixed percentage of the minimum hourly rate of remuneration as set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in respect of employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  Specifically, subsection (5)(d) provides that proposals for EROs shall provide that a worker who has attained the age of 18 years and during normal working hours undergoes a course of study or training prescribed in regulations made by the Minister under section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 shall be remunerated at an hourly rate reduced to the percentage set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of that Act.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Prescribed Courses of Study or Training) Regulations 2000 sets down the comprehensive criteria a course of study or training must satisfy for the purposes of section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  The criteria include that the duration of the course is for a minimum period of three calendar months, that the training enables the acquisition of skills and-or knowledge expected to enhance the work performance of the employee at the end of the course, and assessment and certification procedures.  In addition, a separate amendment proposed by the Minister will provide that proposals for employment regulation orders, EROs, may provide for a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned as well as the length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned which was contained in the published Bill."

By way of explanation, section 12 inserts a new section 42A into the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a joint labour committee, JLC, must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders, EROs.  These principles and policies are set out in section 42A(6)(a) to (d) of the Bill.  This amendment proposes to require a JLC to take account of rather than have regard to such principles and policies.  On the advice of the Attorney General, the Government has agreed that the catalogue of principles and policies contained in sections 5, 11 and 12 should be developed to provide for a more explicit ordering of their priority ranking, and Government amendments are proposed.  In this regard, when formulating proposals for EROs, a priority consideration for a JLC is that the terms of the recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest. The Minister has put forward separate amendments to these sections to deal with the necessity for providing for a hierarchy of principles in this regard.  Such a hierarchy of principles is needed not least in anticipation of further legal challenge to address tensions between constitutional issues, that is, freedom of contract and property rights on the one hand and the common good, that is, harmonious industrial relations on the other.
13378	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	212	" I move amendment No. 73: In page 17, to delete lines 45 to 51 and in page 18, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following: ""(b) the general level of wages in comparable sectors; (c) where enterprises in the sector in question are in competition with enterprises in another Member State, the general level of wages in the enterprises in that other Member State taking into account the cost of living in the Member State concerned; (d) the national minimum hourly rate of pay declared by order for the time being in force under section 11 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, and the appropriateness or otherwise of fixing a statutory minimum hourly rate of pay above that rate; and (e) the terms of any relevant national agreement relating to pay and conditions for the time being in existence.”. Section 12 as presented inserts a new section 42A into the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a JLC must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders, EROs.  Section 42A(6) as presented provides that a JLC must have regard to, among other factors, the general level of wages in comparable sectors, including, where appropriate, the general level of wages in such comparable sectors in other relevant jurisdictions.  The objective of amendment No. 73 is to ensure that comparisons of minimum wages for the purposes of framing EROs would take account of differences in price levels between European Union member states reflecting purchasing power parities for household consumption expenditure. While particular attention had been given to providing that wage comparisons, having regard to the rates paid in other jurisdictions, should only be conducted on the basis of a ""fair and reasonable assessment"", the parliamentary counsel's advice in respect of the provisions in sections 5 and 12 was that the specific concerns raised in this regard could best be addressed by specifying instead, first, the cost of living and, second, a restriction of the field of comparison to only those EU member states with which firms covered by JLCs and registered employment agreements, REAs, can be found to be in competition, and that they should be included as factors to be assessed in setting wages. A similar provision as regards wage comparisons has been addressed already in subsection 3B(k) inserted by amendment No. 3, which I understand has been agreed.  Accordingly, comparisons are only applicable where firms covered by JLCs can be found to be in competition with enterprises in other EU member states.  The European Union has developed a model of economic and social development which extends beyond the diversity of national situations and is based on common values and principles, in particular, the objective affirmed in the treaty of promoting hand in hand economic and social progress. EU member states have already ratified a large number of ILO conventions relating in particular to core labour standards, labour inspection, labour administration, employment, social security and wages.  Most EU member states currently have statutory or otherwise legally binding or generally applicable minimum wages in place.  The impact of a national minimum wage on both demand and supply can differ markedly across member states depending on the level set as well as other labour market policies and institutions.  The thrust of EU employment policy is that wage floors need to be sufficiently adjustable with the social partners actively engaged in ensuring wage settlements reflect overall economic developments."
13379	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	215	 I believe the issue was also raised with regard to an earlier amendment as we debated this particular issue.  If I am not mistaken the Minister, Deputy Bruton, gave an undertaking to examine it.  We feel taking the cost of living into account and restricting the field of comparison to only those EU member states with firms covered by JLCs and REAs is an equitable way forward.  I am trying to understand the Deputy's point in respect of employers but, respectfully, I did not quite understand the point made on how they are given a greater role.
13380	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	217	 The Deputy proposes to apply more qualitative criteria to the process.
13381	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	219	 The Government feels the criteria are well met and that the JLCs sit above the national minimum wage in any sense.  I do not think we should look for increased criteria above the level of wages.  This is the Government's view on the matter.
13382	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	225	 The stark political reality in regard to the national minimum wage is that this Government restored it.  We brought many people back into a wage that, arguably, is more of a living wage than those who served in previous mandate sought to have available given that it reduced their rights and entitlements.  We must take that into account as well. I refer to the amendments and to section 42A(7).  This amendment provides for a new commonsense or straightforward definition of remuneration for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs so that such proposals may no longer include pay or time off from work in lieu of public holidays; compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, resulting for required work on a Sunday, a section that will continue to apply separately and should not be duplicated in any ERO; payments in lieu of notice; or payments referrable to a worker's redundancy.  This amendment would include these provisions in the definition of remuneration.  This definition is provided in order to comply with the Government's decision that in future JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  In particular, provision for a Sunday premium will be removed from the scope of EROs while preserving workers' entitlements under section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  In this context, it is proposed to complement the removal of the Sunday premium from the purview of JLCs with a direction to the Labour Relations Commission to devise a code of practice for Sunday working.  The proposed code would provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives, in sections covered by EROs, on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options as specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The code of practice will subsequently be given formal status by means of a ministerial order.
13383	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 To reiterate, section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides protection.  If we are talking about the status of the EROs, what is their status post July and post the High Court?  One must ask oneself that question.  What we are seeking to do through this legislation is to give a protection through the proposed code which at least provides guidance in respect of sectors covered by the EROs on arrangements that could be put in place to comply with section 14 of that very same Act. I refer to those workers who would have had certain premia prior to July.  The question we must ask ourselves is where the evidence is of people bringing cases to rights commissioners post July, where they would have recourse to do so?  We have to find a mechanism here and we believe strongly that the LRC approach, with the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, provides the best way forward in terms of the protection of those workers.
13384	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	234	" I move amendment No. 79: In page 19, to delete lines 13 to 31 and substitute the following: ""(7) When making a recommendation under subsection (6), the Court shall— (a) be satisfied that the terms of the recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest, and (b) have regard to the following: (i) the representations made by the parties at the hearing; (ii) any relevant code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act 1990; (iii) the economic and commercial circumstances in relation to the sector to which the joint labour committee relates; (iv) the rates of remuneration and conditions of employment of workers in similar employment sectors, including workers in a sector to which another joint labour committee relates; (v) the merits of the dispute and the terms upon which it should be settled.""."
13385	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	235	" I move amendment No. 81: In page 19, to delete lines 44 to 47 and substitute the following: ""equal division of votes the chairman shall cast his or her vote having regard to the recommendation of the Court."". This amendment provides for the removal of the reference in section 9 of the Bill to the chairman of a joint labour committee having ""a second or casting vote"" in the circumstances envisaged in the proposed new section 42B(9).  The intention of the amendment is to clarify the purpose of the section and to improve the drafting of the Bill.  The general policy objective of the new provision is that the chairman of a joint labour committee will be a non-voting member of the committee other than in circumstances in which the procedure set out in the new section is exhausted and the employer and the working members of the joint labour committee agree on the implementation of the labour court recommendation in question.  It is proposed that in such circumstances, the chairman will be allowed to cast a single vote, having regard to the recommendation of the Labour Court, but not ""a second or casting vote"" as provided for in the new section 42B(9).  Essentially, this amendment has been tabled to make a correction."
13386	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	241	 I have an open mind on the Deputy's comments but I also have regard for the Minister's comments on encompassing some of these issues on workplace relations and future legislation.  I shall try to be helpful and approach the matter pragmatically having regard for the arguments made.  I suggest that we examine the issue again at Report Stage and a specific view can be given then.
13387	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	243	 With regard to NERA, the Deputy wants to create the maximum leeway for workers and he gave prescriptive examples.  Perhaps we can examine it again at a further stage.
13388	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	246	 We should examine all three of the amendments and their nuances.

(c) Where an application is made under paragraph (b) the Court shall not extend the period of the exemption for more than 24 months from the date on which the exemption was granted. (d) Where the period of the exemption has been extended by the Court under paragraph (b), the Court shall not further extend the period.”."

13393	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 I move amendment No. 95: In page 30, paragraph (a)(i), line 40, to delete “subparagraph (xxvi)” and substitute “subparagraph (xxvii)”. Section 17 amends the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to ensure that payments due to a worker, due to decisions of a rights commissioner or a determination of the Labour Court made under this Act, shall be treated as debts for the purposes of employees' rights on the insolvency of their employer.  It adds to a long list of debts in Acts that are covered by section 6(2)(a)  of the 1984 Act.  Since the publication of the Bill the Property Services Regulation Bill 2011 was enacted which contained a similar amendment to the 1984 Act.  Accordingly, as a consequence of the Property Services Regulation Act 2011, section 6(2)(a)(xxvi) of the Protection of Employees (Employers’ Insolvency) Act 1984 was introduced and has necessitated a consequential adjustment of the numbering of the subsections listed in section 17 of this Bill.  It is a technical amendment.

13398	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	261	 The amendment proposes the addition of a new section 19 that would result in a firm, in receipt of an exemption to pay the REA or ERO rates, from tendering for a public procurement contract as has been espoused.  There are already protections in the Bill to address the concerns that the amendment seeks to deal with.  First, as regards REAs, it will be a matter for the parties to the REA to determine whether an REA should have a provision for an ability and inability to pay clause.  Second, in respect of EROs and REAs, the Labour Court will be required to take into account whether, if granted, the exemption would have an adverse affect on employment levels and distort competition in the sector to the detriment of employers not party to the application but subject to the ERO or REA.

13444	SeanSherlock	Labour	14442.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	9	 To continue the canine theme, perhaps we would not be in the situation we are in now if we had put a few more dogs in the manger. I agree with the points that have been made by Deputies Lawlor and O'Dea.  It is imperative to ensure the concerns they have espoused are taken on board when regulations come to the fore on foot of the European Commission's auditing proposals that are before us at present.  The bottom line is that it is sensible to provide for a strong and robust auditing regime that is regulated by way of legislation.  If it can be done at EU level, that is the way to go.  I anticipate that this matter will be considered during the Irish Presidency.  It is vital for us to ensure that concerns of this nature are articulated and can work their way into the final legislative outcome.  There is no question about the fact that we take this issue seriously. As public representatives, we all have experience of dealing with community groups.  I am familiar with the credit union movement, which has been audited by particular firms and had to go back to those firms again following changes in the regulatory regime at Central Bank level.  Credit unions have had to pay considerable sums to those companies.  Certain issues arise in that regard.  There is no doubt that the voluntary pillar, including the various community groups, is completely and utterly robust in how it conducts its business.  The groups in question often have to pay for audit reports on two or three occasions to demonstrate that.  That aspect of the system has to be examined and cleaned up.  I take the points the Deputies have made.  There is no question about the need for a robust auditing regime. Deputy O'Dea mentioned that he and others have received a submission from the Professional Insurance Brokers Association.  I understand that Deputy Lawlor has contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to highlight the issue.  I anticipate that a significant response will be given on Report Stage and the matter will be dealt with.  If amendments are proposed, or if further discussion can be facilitated, we will be very open to that.

13449	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	5	 The big ticket item at present is negotiating Horizon 2020, which is the next framework for research expenditure in the European Union. The Irish Presidency is chairing those negotiations, which will be subject to co-decision procedure with the Commission and the European Parliament. Horizon 2020 will offer a package of measures worth €70 billion or more, with a specific target of 20% for SME engagement compared to 15% in the current framework programme. We believe this will have a major stimulus effect in terms of SME engagement and job creation throughout the European Union and in Ireland in particular. Our overarching philosophy is to accelerate the economic and societal return from the public investment in research in order to deliver high quality jobs. In addition to Horizon 2020, we are also implementing our own research prioritisation exercise which brings together the State funders of research. We have prioritised 14 key areas to maximise the economic and societal impact of our investment in research. A process is under way of developing the 14 action plans, involving all the State funders of research and the HEA to ensure maximum impact. We are also pursuing smart investment in research centres at scale and with critical mass. In 2013, we announced seven new large scale SFI research centres supporting more than 800 scientists. These centres will enhance IDA's capacity to attract foreign direct investment. The recent €300 million announcement included €200 million from the State's funders of research and €100 million from industry. Many of the industrial players are in the FDI sector. Activities funded through the research centres include big data, advanced food research and marine energy research. Later this afternoon we will be discussing the extension of SFI's mandate to include applied research and to allow it to fund research proposals closer to the applied research arena in order to accelerate the exploitation of research for economic benefit. We are setting targets in a number of other areas, including high-potential start-up units, technology centres through the institutes of technology and the SFI funded strategic research clusters. I would be happy to speak further on these activities if members so wish.
13450	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	68	 A wide range of questions have been asked. Horizon 2020 involves a co-decision procedure and will require the agreement of the European Parliament, the Commission and the member states. I am presiding over the negotiations with our team in Brussels, through the permanent representation. Ours is a partial general approach, whereby the Council of Ministers has agreed a negotiating position relative to the European Parliament. There are certain areas of inflection, or certain challenges regarding the full cost model. We are trying to move towards a simplified procedure under which calls can be issued. The simpler the mechanism, the greater the access for individual researchers and research entities. There are other differences between the Council and the Parliament, for example, on the rules of participation. We have gone through six trilogues, under which the three entities have tried to move on to the next stage. We are on trilogue No. 7 and will move towards trilogue No. 8 in the latter half of this week, if I am not mistaken. We hope to reach a final conclusion by the end of the Irish Presidency because we want to ensure a smooth transition between the seventh framework programme, FP7, and Horizon 2020 so that there can be clarity regarding the latter throughout the EU's research infrastructure, particularly in Ireland, and it can start seamlessly on 1 January 2014. We are still in the midst of the political negotiations with the other two institutions. An additional €5 million was provided to the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, to allow for payments that would otherwise have been made in 2013. This allowed for a lower allocation in the overall budget cut. Some 18 capital projects are still progressing, as are 15 current projects. Eighteen current projects were originally targeted, but the 15 are delivering approximately the same outputs, namely, 339 PhDs as opposed to the original target of 342 PhDs. Seven new Science Foundation Ireland centres have been announced. Is Deputy Tóibín seeking clarity on these?

The overarching philosophy is to ramp up into world class research centres and to increase industry engagement but this does not preclude us from continuing our funding of regional technology centres, which are not necessarily mapped onto the 14 research prioritisation areas. Industry engages with the technology centres through the institutes of technology after identifying industry challenges. We should have distributed a note on the distribution of the centres as well as the activities ongoing in same. I can discuss this matter now, if the Deputy wishes.

13454	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	77	 Technology gateways are housed within institutes of technology in Letterkenny, Athlone, Limerick, Cork, etc. They have various themes. For example, Waterford's theme is software solutions and mobile devices and the theme of CIT's Technologies for Embedding Computing, TEC, centre is embedded electronics for energy, water and location-based applications. Where specific thematic areas exist, industry has go-to points to optimise its opportunities. I am trying to get through all of the committee's questions.

The intellectual property protocol allows for arrangements to be agreed between industry and publicly funded research organisations as regards individual entities.

13456	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	87	 There is a set of guidelines as well as an agreed IP protocol, a document on which is published. Regarding the research centres, one must allow for a certain degree of flexibility if one wants a greater degree of industrial engagement in the funding of research. A designated technology transfer officer within each institution manages the relationship between principal investigators and industry. If one is too restrictive, one might curtail the level of economic activity or the opportunities arising from the engagement between publicly funded research and industry.
13457	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	89	 I will revert to the Deputy on this matter, as I must on the other figures to which he referred, namely, the value of the equity holding in Enterprise Ireland. We will establish tech centres for medical devices, connected health and pharma-manufacturing. These will map onto the 14 priority research areas. Dairy technology and analytics are two of those areas. I will revert if further questions must be answered. Turning to Deputy Conaghan, the fundamental question is not of whether it is basic versus applied research. They are on the same continuum. However, we borrow approximately €300 million per week. In this light, it is pertinent that the State and its funders of research would outline a set of priorities to maximise the impact of that research in terms of creating new economic opportunities, namely, creating jobs and high-potential start-ups as well as resourcing the small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that will sustain the economy. We look at it from the perspective that perhaps 250,000 jobs were lost between 2008 and 2011. Through this prioritisation programme, and the technology sector centres and prioritisation areas I mentioned, we can begin to leverage more from industry to create those new opportunities. We have State funding and taxpayers' money coming together with industry cash or in-kind contributions to try to ensure we can retain the number of jobs we have within the foreign direct investment sector and also that we can grow new opportunities within the domestic or indigenous sector. There is a strong belief that by leveraging that intellectual property and creating more opportunities for scientists to move into the entrepreneurial sphere, the economy can be sustained over a longer period. One does not come at the expense of the other, however. The research prioritisation exercise is part of the funding puzzle, if one wishes. As well as the HEA bloc grant there are other areas such as the Irish Research Council and other funding agencies that can still fund areas of blue-sky or basic research. There are reasonable amounts of money to sustain the relatively small pockets within the humanities and social sciences, areas, for example, that may feel they are outliers in any new process of prioritisation. The two are not mutually exclusive. Even within the humanities and social sciences, specifically the latter, there are potential opportunities within the prioritisation areas which can be mapped onto health or data analytics to provide new opportunities. It is about taking a more lateral view about how we fund into the research space. I hope that answers the question adequately.
13458	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	91	 We are doing a metrics paper at present and will bring it to Cabinet. This will give the Deputy the context of metrics and how patents map onto it - or not, as the case may be. The question one must ask oneself is whether patents are an accurate measure of economic activity. What long-term effect do they have in terms of creating jobs, etc.? Of themselves, as intellectual property, patents are important in terms of protecting the good ideas and the new innovations people develop. What we have sought to do from the research perspective, and are doing, is to bring a paper to Cabinet. The Minister has a strong input in this regard. Its purpose is to ensure that wherever the State invests, through all the funders of research, for example, the HEA, Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board and all the other State funders, it will map out or measure the impact of that research funding. That is measured in terms of publications and in the numbers of jobs created. One tries to measure the societal impact by looking at indicators such as the European Union innovation index, and so on. There are metrics around publications of papers, etc. The key point is that we are ensuring that where we are investing we have a set of criteria laid down such that the metrics have to be measured in terms of the impact and the number of jobs created. As that is done it informs our approach. I refer to the SFI centres.
13459	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	93	 This work cannot be measured geographically - the geographical spread is incidental. It is based on excellence, as it must be. If one were to skew it, based on geography----
13460	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	95	 The criterion is excellent science. A criterion of excellence exists in terms of how one funds research; it is the fundamental pillar for any funding call or new opportunity. One cannot discriminate between various geographical areas. If, for example, one wanted to fund into south Kerry it has to be based on the pillar of excellence; it cannot be because the funding call is from south Kerry. If one examines the calls and looks at where the money has been disbursed, what has been forced is a major collaboration between institutions that might not, historically, have collaborated with each other. I refer to the CLARITY and INSIGHT centres, for example, where DCU, UCD and NUIG are coming together, which is a significant investment in the area of data analytics. One also maps the industry engagement, which involves industry from all across the country, geographically speaking. The geographical indicator takes second place to the pillar of excellence. One has to fund excellent research regardless of where it comes from, geographically. I hope that makes sense.

We can provide a further briefing note on Enterprise Ireland's research and development programmes. The committee has received a good note detailing the practical overview of the innovation vouchers, the research and development fund, technology centres and high-potential start-ups, HPSUs. Were the committee to facilitate me, I would welcome an opportunity to return and delve deeper into the issue of research and innovation. Since the Estimates process is condensed, leading to a concertina effect, one would appreciate an opportunity to return, interrogate the landscape further and encourage members to visit some of the research centres in a co-ordinated fashion. Before I became a Minister of State, these matters could be nebulous and theoretical. If one gets one's fingers dirty by seeing what the researchers are doing in the centres and how they engage with industry, one has a chance to understand the situation fully. I am not saying that members do not understand it, but my experience of visiting the centres and seeing their work for myself helped me to capture what they were doing. I wish to address the issue of silos. The Minister hit on it in terms of the health innovation hub. As the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, my role is to try to break down those silos. The recent announcement represents the largest investment ever, with €300 million from the industry as well as State funding for research organisations, institutes of technology and universities. This will break down the traditional silos, elements of the industry will collaborate with one another along thematic lines, and the silos within academic circles will also be broken down. We are in a new disposition, in that people must collaborate if they are to flourish and survive. This is the underlying principle. I thank the Chairman and will leave matters there.

I thank Deputies Calleary and Tóibín for submitting the various amendments and the first proposed amendment is essentially already captured when one considers section 7(1) in conjunction with section 7(6), specifically lines 13 to 18, inclusive. The wording of the Bill as presented has been undertaken in consultation with the advisory council on science, technology and innovation, and I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill as it stands is appropriate. It will enable us to leverage more from the ever-increasing SFI investments and it also grants SFI some flexibility with regard to future funding calls for the development of Ireland's enterprise development and without diminution in standards of research excellence. Therefore, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
13466	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	152	 With regard to amendment No. 5, it is the Government's intention to inform the Houses of the Oireachtas of the strategic areas of opportunities for Ireland. This will largely be centred on priority areas as set out in the recommendations arising from the national research prioritisation exercise and through the prioritisation action group, whose work continues. I am currently chairing that process. I am satisfied that we could consider this for further discussion on Report Stage, taking into account the submission made by the Deputy.

I was concerned that by including ""by another review process equivalent to relevant international best practice"" we might somehow lessen the rigour of SFI's renowned review process of excellence. There is a danger inherent in that if it is dissipated in any way, the core of SFI would be diminish. I assure the Deputy that nobody is seeking to diminish that in any way and the inclusion of the words ""review process equivalent to relevant international best practice"" is absolutely necessary. Such a requirement is primarily due to the smaller grant-funded programmes that SFI is now supporting in the promotion of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, where SFI's rigorous international scientific peer review process is not an appropriate mechanism to use. Deputies should be aware that in March 2012, as part of our reform programme, we transferred responsibility for the Discover Science & Engineering, DSE, programme from Forfás to SFI, given the synergies that exist between the DSE-supported actions and certain SFI science awareness supports. In addition, some of the smaller grants that SFI administers, such as the conferences and workshops programme that works to attract top-class conferences and leading scientists to Ireland, are not internationally peer reviewed and nor should they be. As is increasingly the case, where opportunities arise for SFI to co-fund with another agency, Department or research entity - in Ireland or in collaboration across international borders - it may not always be appropriate or possible to utilise an international scientific peer review process. It is critical that we ensure in such instances that whatever review mechanism is used by SFI or it is party to, such a process should be of an appropriately high standard and of international best practice. For these reasons, the inclusion of the words ""or by any other review process equivalent to relevant international best practice"" is absolutely necessary in the section."

The peer review process has been the bedrock of Science Foundation Ireland since its establishment in order to ensure continued scientific excellence and relevance to the enterprise base. We do not want to dilute that in any way, shape or form and we want to continue that strong pillar while allowing flexibility in other areas of opportunity, as I referred to earlier.

On page 5, lines 20 onwards, particularly lines 32 to 39, inclusive, the Bill clearly sets out how the extension of the remit of SFI will be provided for on an all-Ireland basis. This section therefore already provides for the inclusion of any relevant institution in Northern Ireland, including those established under the Good Friday Agreement, and the important operational matter will be whether any such institution, be it based in the North or the South, meets with SFI criteria to be deemed an eligible body to compete for SFI funding calls. It is not necessary to accept the proposed amendment. We all adhere to the belief that the underlying principle of creating those opportunities subject to the right criteria is the overarching principle in the legislation.

Appointments to the board of SFI are made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in consultation with the Minister for Education and Skills and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In reality, this proposed amendment captures what is already established practice when, annually, the two longest serving SFI board members must retire from the board each July. As part of the board appointments process, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation actively considers the existing competencies of the SFI board membership and examines the gaps arising from board retirements or other vacancies that might arise separately to the annual retirement process. The Minister also examines the emerging scientific or industrial expertise needs and trends from which the board would benefit, the gender representation on the board at all times, the ongoing evolution of Ireland's research system and in particular the maturing and increasing relevance of SFI investments, foreign direct investment, linkages and our indigenous base. The Government has also established a practice whereby appointments to State boards are advertised publicly via the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and applications invited. Such an advertisement regarding the forthcoming July 2013 SFI board vacancies is live on the PAS website, publicjobs.ie. As part of this process there is a detailed list of competencies which potential SFI board members would need to meet and if we were to accept the Deputy's proposed amendment in this regard, we would also need to significantly broaden the proposed wording of the Bill further. In this case on page 6 between lines 6 and 7 we would include text along the following lines: ""In appointing members of the board the Minister shall seek to ensure it contains a balance of expertise in such areas as academic research, commercial research and development, corporate governance, entrepreneurship, research funding, development and venture funding, public engagement-outreach education, research and development, industrial policy development implementation and assessment both internationally and nationally, awareness and detailed knowledge of Ireland's research landscape, public sector experience and higher education systems,"" among many other things. However, given the established practice undertaken by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding board appointments and the openness of the PAS process which the Government has established regarding appointments to State boards, and the lengthy list of competencies I have just mentioned, I am of the view that the Deputy's proposed amendment is unnecessary, therefore I am not in a position to accept it."
13474	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	175	 The question here is whether one adheres to that by way of primary legislation or does it require a cultural or systemic change in our thinking. The view regarding the specific amendment is that while one would absolutely and utterly accept the sentiment expressed and the spirit of the amendment, putting forward a specific quota target for this piece of legislation would not be appropriate. Culturally, within SFI three of the past five appointments have been female. I take the point about driving a cultural and behavioural change across the State board and agency infrastructure but in SFI there has been a significant redistribution in gender balance.
13475	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	178	 While I am not accepting the amendment, I agree with the sentiment and spirit of the amendment. If one was to look at the scientific or the research landscape, there is clear evidence that female researchers can reach a certain stage but very few break through that glass ceiling. That applies to other sectors of the economy. I am not in a position to accept an amendment to enforce a gender quota at this stage.
13476	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	180	 I am willing to look again at the issue on Report Stage but we must distinguish between the role of the chief scientific adviser and the director general of Science Foundation Ireland. The question is whether the chief scientific adviser has a role in interrogating or advising on Government policy because Government policy is determined by those who are given the mandate by the people to direct how policy is implemented, subject to advice, but not necessarily through the chief scientific adviser role. We are lucky that we have a chief scientific adviser and we have continued to keep that position in Ireland. As there are only about seven countries worldwide that have a chief scientific adviser, we are in a unique position given that we have been able to keep that role in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. I understand the amendment and perhaps we need to examine it further. The appointment of the chief scientific adviser is co-terminous with his appointment as director general. The current arrangement will not always necessarily be the case. We can have a further discussion on the issue on Report Stage.
13477	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	183	 There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that we are taking the foot off the pedal in terms of basic research and moving into applied research. We are extending the remit but, as I said at the earlier committee meeting, one is the logical extension of the other. It is an almost impossible task and would require significant additional resources to be deployed within Science Foundation Ireland and also across the higher education sector and would be burdensome for the scientific community. In reality, such a proposal would add little value over and above the systems that Science Foundation Ireland has in place. Perhaps I can explain it briefly. One needs to appreciate fully the nature and increasing complexity of the research continuum which is not just at the national level but is global. One needs to realise how it spans from the blue skies fundamental research through oriented basic research and on towards the applied research arena. Internationally, there is the ever-increasing convergence across different scientific disciplines as well as significantly different timelines in certain sectors. For example, ICT related research evolves far more rapidly than the life sciences and biosciences research areas, and the lines between pure fundamental research and truly applied research can be very difficult to distinguish. Research can often span different areas and across different types. For instance, ICT related research will cross over into the life sciences, energy and many other research areas and will typically encompass basic clinical translational and applied research. Science Foundation Ireland administers more than 450 live research grants with an awards commitment value of €400 million spanning out to 2019. On top of these SFI commitment levels there are also industry contributions in excess of €100 million from a significant cohort of the 700 plus industry partners directly connected to SFI funded researchers. The SFI grants awards will have differing durations and review processes which means that the SFI funding model and grants commitments and expenditure process is constantly evolving. Invariably, there will also be a range of other funding streams in research teams that involve certain SFI supported scientists whereby the SFI element may be only one aspect, along with private industry funding, EU funding, contributions from other private sources or other national funders. Committee members will appreciate that in recent years, Science Foundation Ireland-funded teams leveraged in excess of €150 million per annum from sources other than its SFI grants, and usually close to 60% comes from non-Exchequer sources. In 2012, the amount leveraged from other sources was approximately €171 million. There is a complexity involved when trying to analyse and breakdown the funding between the various points on the research continuum. There is the SFI provided element and we must also distinguish between the other funding sources within a year and in each year. Funding is a constantly evolving and highly complex process. SFI already manages the process very tightly and effectively with its small staffing cohort of about 45 persons. Furthermore, one must remember that SFI is one of our research funding agencies. Even if one was keen to undertake the very resource intensive ask arising from the amendment, one would still not have a full picture of Ireland's overall research landscape. Typically, SFI research investments account for just over 25% of Ireland's overall public research investments. The proposal would also place an added burden on those in the scientific community if we were to constantly press them to categorise their various projects and associated funding between oriented, basic and applied research. Such an exercise would, most likely, also eat further into the Exchequer's research provision to the higher education institutions. It would mean that colleges would have to deploy additional administrative supports. We need to ease the administrative burden on the scientific community in order for them to do what they do best which is to undertake excellent research with impact and relevance. On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
13478	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	186	 The first thing to remember is that research prioritisation does not account for the entire SFI budget. We seek to move or evolve the research landscape in a way that will ensure that all of the State funders of research are, pretty much, on the same trajectory. One then seeks to identify new areas of opportunity where co-funding arises. For instance, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Teagasc and the SFI recently. It identified new areas of opportunity in a food related space. Even though food for health is within the priority area, there are other areas of basic research opportunities that can be mined from that type of memorandum of understanding. Similarly, the Irish Research Council funds an industry-based PhD. One of the areas in which I am trying to drive a greater coherence in education is the area of stem science technology, engineering and maths. We have a National Centre of Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning. Perhaps we could drive new areas of funding opportunities into stem science through entities like the national centre of excellence, DCU, UCC and other areas. I do not just mean on the pedagogue side but also funding to ensure that teachers at primary and post-primary have the ability and the benefit of excellent research that would inform continual and professional development. That initiative would build up new knowledge areas that would provide for a throughput of students into tertiary education and help them to become the best engineers, technologists, mathematicians and scientists that the country has to offer. The point that I am making is that the SFI has other areas of opportunity outside of the prioritisation exercise. We have just announced funding of €6.9 million for basic research with the potential for entrepreneurial activity to support basic scientific researchers in areas such as health. In that sector it will enable us to research whether there are economical or societal impacts. SFI core funding will be invested into that type of an endeavour. SFI is not just concerned with prioritisation in the 14 areas. It is involved in a raft of other activities and one shall not be at the expense of the other. In other words, prioritisation is not applied at the expense of basic research and both aspects will continue together.
13479	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	192	 I shall respond in general terms. I have always contended that science research and innovation is an apolitical space. With regard to the amendment, I ask that we debate the matter on Report Stage. I am openly disposed to accepting it as it would give the Houses of the Oireachtas a better opportunity to interrogate relevant issues, and I do not mean that in a loaded fashion. It would derogate how the role of SFI translates in terms of its operational structures and programmes and its impact from a societal and economic point of view. Even SFI, as an entity, would welcome that opportunity. Consequently, I am favourably disposed and ask the Deputy to allow me to return to the matter on Report Stage. I will try to deal with it then.
13480	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Estimates for the Public Services 2013	195	 For the same reasons I outlined in respect of amendments Nos. 10 and 11, there is a danger inherent within the amendment that too short a view might be taken. At the time of SFI's establishment, it was generally recognised that the research it began to fund in 2000 would not generate the desired outcomes or impact for a horizon spanning perhaps ten to 15 years and we have not yet even reached that stage. It is important to have perspective and I acknowledge the Deputy's point regarding the opportunity it presents to highlight the value of research and so on. However, if one is to account for every single cent or euro that is spent and if one seeks to put in place an appraisal mechanism around that, is one then in danger of creating huge bureaucracies or administrative functions that are unserviceable precisely for the reasons I outlined previously? For instance, under the new opportunities that will arise under Horizon 2020, the foreign direct investment landscape mentioned by the Deputy will, while working with the research landscape in Ireland, retain jobs. However, we can now use the investment made of €300 million as leverage to create further opportunities during the lifetime of the next framework programme, because we believe we can ramp up that activity and surpass the €600 million target under the current framework. If one were obliged to create an administrative function to drill down into that to the last cent, I do not know whether one would be able to achieve that goal. I do not know of any research landscape in the world, even the most highly evolved, that would be able to achieve it. For instance, if one takes the Fraunhofer model, that is, the funding cost model that exists at present under FP7, there is a certain resistance by some larger research institutions against the simplification model the member states are trying to establish. This is because it suits them as they can fund administrative models that allow them to get greater leverage from European Union funding calls. Consequently, while I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, I believe it is far too prescriptive. Its timelines are too short and were members able to develop a mechanism here whereby this matter was being debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas or was at least discussed in a formalised and structured way, they could drill down into such debates and arguments. In that sense, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. Title agreed to.

13515	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	6	 I move amendment No. 3: In page 77, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following: “ “sealed”, other than in provisions governing the use of a company’s common seal or of any official seal of it, means executed in the manner specified in section 64 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 (but only to the extent that that section 64 obviates the need for a seal);”. Amendment agreed to.
13516	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	7	" I am considering introducing amendments to section 2, as amended, on Report Stage. These amendments will tidy up the language used in the definition of ""statutory auditor"" by removing the incorrect reference at the beginning which states ""(within the meaning of those Regulations)"" and purport to clarify further how sole directors are treated within a company's constitution. I am aware that there is a need to define a system for the interconnection of registers which is provided for in Directive 2012/17/EU."
13517	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	8	 I move amendment No. 4: In page 85, line 21, to delete “NACE Rev. 1” and substitute “NACE Rev. 2”. Sections 16 and 17 agreed to.
13518	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	10	 I move amendment No. 5: In page 86, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following: “Company to carry on activity in the State and prohibition of certain activities 18. (1) A company shall not be formed or registered unless it appears to the Registrar that the company, when registered, will carry on an activity in the State. (2) A company shall not carry on the activity of a licensed bank or an insurance undertaking.”. I propose this amendment to give further clarification to the existing law.
13519	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	15	" This series of amendments inserts the words ""managed and controlled"" into sections of the Bill. The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance. The proposed amendments are illegal under EU law and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law of freedom of establishment, a core aspect of EU law. The European Commission closely monitors compliance with this law. The Commission has recently required Ireland to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland. This proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting these amendments."

13521	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	19	 I do not have that information to hand and I am not in a position to answer that question but I am happy to try to facilitate the Deputy. If he tables a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance, I am sure that information would be forthcoming.

(1) Where a company authorises any person as being a person entitled to bind the company (not being an entitlement to bind that is, expressly or impliedly, restricted to a particular transaction or class of transactions), it shall notify the Registrar in the prescribed form of the authorisation and the Registrar shall register the authorisation. (2) A person so authorised, where his or her authorisation is registered in the foregoing manner, is referred to in this Act as a “registered person”; where, in a provision of this Act, that expression appears without qualification, it shall be taken as a reference to a registered person authorised by the company to which the provision falls to be applied. (3) Where a company revokes an authorisation of a person as a person entitled to bind the company (being an authorisation notified to the Registrar in the prescribed form), the person shall, notwithstanding that revocation, continue to be regarded for the purposes of this Act as a registered person unless and until the company notifies the Registrar in the prescribed form of that revocation.""."

Furthermore, I am considering adding the words ""committee of the directors"" to subsection (3) to correct an omission. Section 44 agreed to."
13530	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	32	 I am considering tabling an amendment to the section on Report Stage to change the section back to the existing law as was intended by the CLRG.

13539	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	46	 I am considering introducing an amendment to section 59 in order to clarify whether Parts 1 to 15, inclusive, of the Bill apply to an existing company upon delivery of its constitution or following the registration of the constitution by the registrar.
13540	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	48	 They have not been devised in the past few days. The sheer volume of amendments meant there were certain pressures in regard to the drafting of the Bill. I have given some latitude to the drafters in terms of the pressures they faced. I hope members, likewise, will make allowances for that and engage with the proposals on Report Stage.
13541	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	51	 The objective here is to consolidate an item of legislation that is the size of a telephone book.
13542	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	53	 I do not accept that there is any sense of pulling anything out of the hat in terms of the substance of the legislation. Section 59 is effectively a new section which stipulates that during the transition period, the law applicable to an existing private company limited by shares will be contained in Part 16. There is still some work to be done on that. I ask members for some latitude in terms of the sheer volume of the legislation. I am proceeding in accordance with the protocol that we notify the committee of our intent to introduce amendments on Report Stage. There is no attempt to pull anything out of the hat at the last minute in terms of the entirety of the procedure. However, there are issues that will arise between now and Report Stage.
13543	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	56	" To clarify, there is no intention to make substantive changes to the law itself in terms of its qualitative aspect. However, there has been some engagement since Second Stage with practitioners, in the light of which several amendments will be introduced on Report Stage. The word ""technical"" is not quite correct, but their purpose will essentially be to make the law more efficient in the longer term. That is the main reason I expect to bring forward further amendments on Report Stage."
13544	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	58	" I move amendment No. 19: In page 108, line 24, to delete ""regulations."" and substitute the following: ""regulations; for the avoidance of doubt, the requirements of sections 19 and 26(1) relating to a company’s name shall apply despite any exemption of the kind referred to in section 62(3) that had been enjoyed by the company under the prior Companies Acts.""."

The amendment proposes, unless the Bill otherwise prohibits, to allow an existing private company which re-registers as a designated activity company to continue to enjoy an exemption conferred by section 62(3)."
13548	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	62	 I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and to ensure the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is consistently applied within the provisions of the Bill. In regard to section 65, I am considering Report Stage amendments to insert a cross-reference to section 70 and to clarify that the payment to a third party is the discharge of a liability owed by the company to that third party or otherwise adds value to the company. Otherwise the manner in which the section is worded may be interpreted as allowing, in effect, for shares to be allotted at a discount.
13549	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	63	" I move amendment No. 23: In page 116, line 33, to delete “redeemable shares” and substitute the following: ""shares that are redeemable (which shall be known, and are referred to in this Act, as ""redeemable shares"")""."
13550	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	64	" I move amendment No. 24: In page 117, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following: ""(8) In subsections (9) and (10) ""bearer instrument"" means an instrument, in relation to shares of a company, which entitles or purports to entitle the bearer thereof to transfer the shares that are specified in the instrument by delivery of the instrument. (9) A company shall not have power to issue any bearer instrument. (10) If a company purports to issue a bearer instrument, the shares that are specified in the instrument shall be deemed not to have been allotted or issued, and the amount subscribed therefor (and in the case of a non-cash asset subscribed therefor, the cash value of that asset) shall be due as a debt of the company to the purported subscriber thereof."". This amendment proposes to provide for the abolition of bearer shares in line with the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, recommendation in its 2011 report. The review group recommended that the general provision for bearer shares should be abolished by way of an express prohibition and that transitional arrangements should be provided to take account of companies that may have legitimately issued bearer shares in the past. This prohibition should not affect the position governing renounceable letters of allotment of fully or partly paid-up bonus shares or beneficial interests in shares, and arrangements should be put in place to take account of the specific regulatory regime for collective investment funds."

The purpose of this amendment is to use the words ""securities"" instead of ""debentures"". Further, the purpose of this amendment is to bring the language used in the Bill in line with European Regulation 2003/71 EC."
13552	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	66	 I am considering introducing amendments to section 70 on Report Stage to clarify which shareholders may participate in a pre-emptive offer, correct an error on pre-emptive offers of shares, clarify whether the holders of preference shares are excluded from pre-emption rights in the issue of new shares, ensure no loophole exists in the statutory pre-emption rights of shareholders, insert a cross-reference to section 65, set out the consequences for allotting shares in a manner contrary to the requirements of the Bill to reflect the existing law in section 27 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 and provide that any pre-commencement share allotment authorities must elapse no later than five years after commencement.

This amendment deletes section 71(7)(b). This amendment is proposed on foot of a recommendation from the Revenue Commissioners who advised that recent developments in the direction of self-assessment make reference to adjudications by Revenue obsolete. Does that explain it?

The proposed amendment would be to address other reserves that now exist as a result of recent developments in accounting and company law. That should cover the basis of Deputy Calleary's query-----

13621	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	155	 I understand the Deputy's proposal. I am advised that his suggestion is part of the law as it stands and that, therefore, no amendment is required. Under section 18 of the Interpretation Act, a person includes a body corporate. This is why the definition is not explained specifically in this section. It has been upheld in the High Court in Fyffes plc v DCC plc & ors, IEHC 477, and in the Supreme Court in respect of the liquidation of Worldport Ireland Limited in 2008. Therefore, the law is sufficient as it stands and I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.

13623	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	164	 Under existing law, directors are required to have regard to the interests of employees. This amendment would change it to a duty to employees. This may mean that members and employees would have a directly enforceable right against directors where they act contrary to their respective interests. This would compromise the fundamental structure of the directors' relationship with the company, which is described to be fiduciary, that is to say it requires directors to prefer the interests of the company over their interests or those of others, even where those others include some members of the company. The amendment puts into question the status of the law of oppression, which is the principal protection of minority shareholders under the current law and much of the employment law. Such a vague and general declaration of a duty without any explanation as to how it interacts with existing law would serve to create great uncertainty in company law. This is directly contrary to one of the key objectives of the Bill, which is to clarify directors' duties. The amendment may also breach constitutional property rights. Ultimately, bolstering protections for employees should be done using employment law. These provisions only serve to complicate company law and do nothing to protect employees of partnerships and sole traders and public employees. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.
13624	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	170	 No.
13625	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	177	 Notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy has been brushing up on his neo-Marxist economic theory - it sounds vaguely familiar from my college days - this question was dealt with comprehensively by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in its 2005 report on directors' compliance statements. If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business. The set-up cost for a business was an estimated €90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at €40,000. A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas. Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties. More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement. There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries. The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.
13626	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	180	 I beg the Chairman's indulgence. To a certain extent, I understand the motive behind the amendment, but one must factor into the equation a corpus of environmental, health and safety and employment law. The issue of negative or positive externalities does not arise. We must ensure that there is robust legislation. Every citizen is subject to the existing corpus of law and companies are legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas. That is already inherent, thereby rendering the amendment unsupportable in that sense.

13629	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	192	 The purpose of this amendment is clarificatory in nature. The current text refers to the directors having a duty to have regard to the interests of members in addition to the general duty owed to employees under section 225. However, section 225 does not impose such a duty on directors to their employees. Section 225 provides that the matters to which the directors are to have regard in the performance of their functions shall include the interests of the company's employees in general.

13631	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	196	 We can look at that again on Report Stage for Deputy Calleary.
13632	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	198	 Such documents are already in circulation and are available free from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement's website. The Companies Registration Office already sends these documents to directors of newly formed companies. However, because most companies are formed by company formation's businesses, the documents generally do not get to the directors at all. More important in this respect is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10, that is to say, before they receive the paper copy. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment. However, even though this is not a matter for primary legislation, I acknowledge that the idea is a good one. For this reason, I will consider introducing a live link to the relevant ODCE documents so that directors can read and understand their duties online before completing the electronic form when it becomes available.
13633	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	200	 When people sign up as directors they have obligations. As I said earlier, more important in this respect, is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10. Therefore, that obligation is already there.
13634	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	207	 I do not think anybody would disagree with the sentiments expressed. This is not a matter for primary legislation. It could be dealt with through the ODCE and CRO simplifying the language or ensuring that people are made aware in the starkest terms of their obligations in relation to any legal entity of which they become part. That is perhaps all one can do. If somebody decides to become part of a community-voluntary body or legal entity, there is only so much that the State or Government can do to legislate in respect of that decision. One would expect that people when signing up to such bodies are fully aware of their obligations. People have a personal responsibility to find out their obligations. If it is possible to simplify the language around those obligations the matter should be taken up by the ODCE and CRO.

(1) The discretions of a company under this Part with respect to the length of its financial year or to its annual return date are subject to the overall limitation that those discretions must be exercised in a manner that results in compliance by the company with the following requirement.

Financial statements relate to the company's financial performance and not its tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government were to require businesses to obtain and publish a certificate of tax compliance it would do so in tax law to catch both company and all non-company businesses that also pay taxes. The introduction of this requirement would be entirely without precedent in Europe. I am not, therefore, in favour of accepting the amendment.

13650	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	229	 Since group financial statements relate to a corporate group, the group financial statements of a subsidiary, which is also a parent company, would not give any more information than the group accounts of the company at the top of the corporate group. Therefore deletion of this exemption would benefit no one other than the lawyers and accountants who would have to prepare and file thousands more group financial statements than they do at present. Many foreign direct investment companies rely on this exemption to avoid having to prepare intermediate level group accounts that simply replicate a part of their general top level group accounts. The economic benefit of investing in Ireland would be substantially eroded by requiring these companies to prepare many different sets of group accounts. This would also be a departure from established international practice. Most notably this exemption exists in the United Kingdom. This deletion might constitute a breach of articles 7, 8 and 11 of the seventh accounting directive. For those reasons I am not in favour of changing the section.

This is effectively avoiding a duplication or proliferation of reporting mechanisms. The Deputy seems to seek greater clarity on those companies that are Irish-registered but non-resident companies. Section 301 reads: ""Subject to its not having elected to prepare IFRS group financial statements and to subsection (4), a holding company is exempt from the requirement to prepare group financial statements if the holding company (the “lower holding company”) is itself a subsidiary undertaking and its holding undertaking is not established under the laws of an EEA state and one or other of the following cases applies."" It continues to list exemptions and so on. I am trying to get to the nub of the question."

As he will know, in the case of any Bill consultations take place with a number of stakeholders. There may be a departmental view, there will be a CRO view and there may even be a Revenue view on the matter. The original figure is six months but, following consultation with various stakeholders, it was felt that a figure of three months would be the most expeditious period, rather than 30 days.

13773	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	469	 It brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions found in existing legislation, a change that will provide greater transparency. The giving and acceptance of restriction and disqualification undertakings from directors are facilitated, thereby saving costs and court time. One of the Bill's most far-reaching reforms involves the introduction of a new four-tier categorisation of offences. This follows on from a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. It is proposed that, except for the most serious offences, namely, fraudulent trading and market abuse, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme. At the higher end of the scale, category 1 offences carry, following conviction on indictment, a term of imprisonment of up to ten years and-or a €500,000 fine. A further new provision allows a trial court to order a person convicted under the Bill to remedy any breach thereof in respect of which he or she is convicted.
13774	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	472	 One of the questions that has arisen in relation to this section is around prosecutions of breaches of company law and whether the Bill will rectify this issue. The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate. The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed. Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers. Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender. As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted. This must be taken into account in terms of the context of this section. Section 798 as drafted under existing law is unchanged.
13775	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	473	" This section is also substantially unchanged from that provided in existing law. However, the court may make an order restraining a company or an officer of the company from removing his or her assets from the State or reducing those assets below a specified amount. This extends to the current law in that it also applies to the company and not, as provided under existing law, only to officers of a company. The circumstances in which an injunction can be granted are now limited to cases where the primary cause of action also arises under this Bill. Alternatively, the cause of action must arise under the provisions of the constitution of the company or relate to the holding of an office of the company. Question proposed: ""That section 800 stand part of the Bill."""

In such circumstances, the court may make an order requiring any other party or former party to the share acquisition agreement to give information to the court in relation to matters affecting the application of section 807 as it applies to the share acquisition agreement. The court may exercise this power on the making of an application for a disclosure order or at any time subsequent to this an application to the court by a person having a financial interest in the company or by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

13784	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	495	" The section has some changes when compared with the existing legislation. It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director. The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company. The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels. It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted. The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group. The additional requirement is that the person concerned ""...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company"". The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator. Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company. Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital. The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than €100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. In the case of an investment company, subsection (3) will be read as if the requirements are that the value of the issued share capital of the company is not less than €100,000 and that an amount of not less than €100,000 in cash has been paid in consideration for the allotment of shares in the company, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. A person restricted arising from his or her conduct in relation to a company limited by shares is restricted as regards all other company types as well."

This is a new section to deal with a situation in which a director becomes disqualified under the law of another state. In such a case, where the company fails to notify the registrar of such a situation, as required by section 150(8) of this Bill, the relevant director will be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order for a period not exceeding the remaining period of the foreign disqualification. This section is new and tightens up the position under the current law whereby a person is only required to notify the registrar of their disqualification under the law of another state upon becoming a director of a company and not where the foreign disqualification occurs subsequent to their becoming a director of an Irish company. Question put and agreed to.
13794	SeanSherlock	Labour	14944.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	508	 This is a new section. It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions, such as fraudulent trading and market abuse, the majority of offences under the Companies Acts should be classified according to a four-tier system. As I outlined earlier, category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine, currently set at €6,394 by the Fines Act 2010, previously £5,000. That is an amount no greater than the District Court can impose for any other criminal offence. Category 3 offences will likewise be prosecutable only summarily but on conviction may give rise to a prison sentence of up to six months or a class A fine or both. Both category 2 and category 1 offences attract the same consequences when prosecuted summarily, namely, a class A fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Both these categories may also be prosecuted on indictment. In such a case, a category 2 offence will attract a fine of not more than €50,000 or a prison term not exceeding five years or both. A category 1 offence will have a penalty of a fine of not more than €500,000 or up to ten years in prison or both.

(2) In making an order under subsection (1) the court may order that all costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the person against whom the order is made.”.
