8585	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 I thank the witnesses for attending. They have yielded much information in their presentations and posed many questions, particularly relating to child protection and preventative elements relating to child sexual abuse imagery. What more can parents do to protect children from becoming vulnerable to that macabre world of child sexual abuse? Most children live in protected, loving homes where there is an element of vigilance by parents, but many children globally do not have such privilege. What more can governments or state agencies do to intervene and to protect? Is the law currently robust enough? Is there glaring ignorance - a term which I do not use pejoratively - about the so-called dark web among policymakers like ourselves with regard to what the dark web actually is? Much of this activity allegedly takes place there. It is something that most parents and citizens have no concept of. Perhaps more education is needed. Might I get an answer to those questions first and then, with the Chairman's indulgence, ask one or two more?
8586	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 If the ISPAI which Ms Niculescu represents is aware of it, while the State responds through legislation and trying to deploy resources, and if one looks at the innovation cycle and the ability to bypass protocols, is there a sense in which the ISPAI's members have a responsibility to police this activity? If Internet service providers, ISPs, or other providers are the conduit for this type of content, should they police it and ensure that content is not available or is blocked? I am being a bit controversial in saying that because I understand the role of the conduit. There is a sense where many parents or anybody else with a sense of decency who has an interest in this issue would ask the question of why the content is not blocked. Why do search providers such as Google or Yahoo! not just block them? I know it is a very simplistic question but perhaps it warrants an answer.
8587	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 Would blocking remove it?
8588	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 Why not remove it then?
8589	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 So the ISPAI is effectively building a file?
8590	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 For a criminal case?
8591	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 I have two final questions. I thank the witness for her reply because it was extremely informative. I appreciate her response. In respect of the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, and the Department of Education and Skills, what is the budget for Webwise? How much of the budget is allocated to this endeavour?
8592	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	 Is that €740,000 per annum or for the project?
8593	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Over how many years will the programme run?
8594	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 On the PDST, how many teachers have taken up continuing professional development in respect of Webwise and Internet safety awareness?
8595	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 Is this content included in the mainstream social, personal, health and education, SPHE, curriculum? Is it a de facto part of it? Is it compulsory for students or is it undertaken by choice? Can school principals or teachers say that they have an interest in this area, that they want to take it on board and that they will go for the CPD and teach their pupils about the content? Are the witnesses saying it is not compulsory and that it is not part of the mainstream curriculum?
8596	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	 I appreciate that.
8597	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 It is not a de facto part of the SPHE curriculum, however. If one talks about, for example, student safety, it is very much down to whether a teacher decides to inculcate this programme within his or her SPHE pedagogy or content. If a school or an individual teacher does not want to subsume this into its curriculum, it does not necessarily have to do so. Should we think about making this a compulsory part of the curriculum? That is the key question. While that is a matter for Government and policymakers, I am sure there is a provision within the Department to have a discussion about bringing this into the mainstream and about every teacher teaching the SPHE curriculum having to include this.

8613	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	44	 That is three people in total.

8615	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	48	 That brings it up to 78. How many people work in the Garda national cybercrime bureau?
8616	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	50	 I ask Mr. Daly to repeat those numbers.
8617	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	52	 I am trying to get a sense of the overall numbers. For the pilot programme in New Ross and Ballincollig, are they extrapolated from the numbers Mr. Gubbins has outlined?
8618	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	54	 How many are in Ballincollig and New Ross?
8619	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	56	 That is three.
8620	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	58	 I want to speak to the issue of resourcing. The numbers are quite finite. Given the scale of the challenge it could be argued that the numbers are quite small. What is the business case being made for additional resources? Is such a business case being made?
8621	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	60	 I appreciate that point. I am trying to ascertain what the numeric strength is and I recognise that other resources are deployed as needed. Will Mr. O'Driscoll give me a perspective on how the relationship with Internet service providers, ISP, of Ireland works with regard to a notice and take-down procedure? The Hotline, as I understand it, will serve an ISP with a notice of removal or take-down. Mr. O'Driscoll referred to a blocking mechanism. Maybe this is a false analogy, but it is a bit like when I block somebody who is abusive to me on social media, such as Twitter of Facebook, it does not necessarily stop the activity. How is the activity investigated? It is one thing to block it, but how is it stopped and investigated? How do gardaí investigate, since their jurisdiction is the Republic of Ireland and the crime may be transnational? What is the nature of the investigation and how are crimes investigated subsequently? Is it merely a blocking mechanism or is it subsequently reported to other jurisdictions? For those instances that happen in Ireland, specifically, how many investigations are under way at present and how many cases are before the courts for this type of activity?
8622	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	63	 How many sites are hosted in Ireland?
8623	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	65	 Can Mr. Daly say if it is in fives or tens?
8624	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	67	 How many cases come before the courts?
8625	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	69	" The witnesses made a statement on the Communications (Retention of Data) Act. There is a specific section in their statement, ""However, if internet providers fail to provide the Garda Síochána with data pursuant to the Communication (Retention of Data) Act 2011, our ability to identify people involved in the sexual exploitation of children or the distribution of child pornography on the internet will be restricted"". Is there a lacuna in the law relating to this? Have there been incidences where ISPs have refused to yield information? I am trying to get a closer interpretation of that statement."
8626	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	72	 We would all acknowledge that the work of the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland and Hotline is laudable and proactive. There are mobile telephony and Internet service providers. The witnesses made a very pertinent point about how technology has moved on. A phone is no longer merely a phone but it is also a computer. Does the Communications (Retention of Data) Act as it relates to this subject matter pertain to mobile telephony too with regard to the retention of data?
8627	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	74	 My point, to be helpful, is that it would be very good to have a perspective in order for this committee to make determinations and recommendations.
8628	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	141	 I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting today. This is an insightful discussion and it builds a deeper understanding for members of the committee. I wish to get a sense of the nature of the collaboration. There is the ISPAI, the Garda, CyberSafeIreland, the Office for Internet Safety and so forth. There are myriad organisations. What level of collaboration takes place? There are a finite number of actors in the field but what level of real collaboration is there at present? Perhaps the representatives of CyberSafeIreland will respond to that first. Do the witnesses have a genuine critique of the system as it exists?
8629	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	144	 I am glad the witness mentioned Webwise because I intended to ask about the office's relationship with same. The witness speaks a great deal about education and continuing professional development, CPD, in schools for teachers. There is a conflict in my mind around this. I am a parent. Is there an onus on the parent to have the primary responsibility in respect of educating his or her child about Internet safety? To say that I have mental blockages about using the technology and so forth is not really sufficient in this day and age. A parent teaches his or her child the safe cross code, road safety and all sorts of other safety mechanisms. I have a perception, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, that sometimes parents will say that it is the role of the school through the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, Webwise and so forth to educate their children on Internet safety. Webwise does not necessarily reach every school and not every teacher has taken up the CPD. Representatives of Webwise have appeared before the committee. If the CPD is not inculcated within the teaching and academic institutions as a core subject, it is likely that there will be a great deal of slippage in this regard. What is the witnesses' perspective on that? I believe every teacher should be equipped compulsorily, but how do we marry the role of the teacher with the role of the parent? I am sorry if I am a little long-winded but the witnesses understand what I am saying.
8630	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	146	 There is a role for schools. The school is probably the primary institution with which parents will interact in respect of their children up to the age of 18 years. We are talking about distilling this down and creating a platform nationally whereby parents voluntarily interact with schools and the programmes are delivered through that. Parents go to parent-teacher meetings. There is no reason that on one night per year there could not be outreach programme, for example, for every school in the country. It would only require two or three hours. Parents would interact with each other thereafter and natural collaborations would begin to build up through parents interacting with each other. If it were to be distilled down to community level, it would not take a massive amount of resources or money to do that.
8631	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	151	 I hope Ms Cooney will forgive me for cutting across her but time is limited. The one thing I have noted is that teachers need access to materials. Ms Cooney is, in effect, saying that it is not only about access to materials but about the confidence to be able to-----
8632	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	153	 -----have the pedagogical skills and understand the content in order to deliver it. That is certainly an issue which this committee could take forward. I am very conscious that the Chairman has to progress the agenda. I want to speak very specifically about the research component of this issue. These are straightforward questions. Are funding lines available through the Irish Research Council for the area the witnesses have spoken about?
8633	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	155	 There is no bespoke funding line. Are there any funding lines from industry? For instance, is there any funding from the bodies represented by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, which is a global body, or from any of the top global Internet-based companies, nine out of the top 10 of which have facilities in Ireland? Has Dr. Brennan, or anyone from the academic side, approached these companies and told them that they need to start cutting checks? Forgive me if I mix up qualitative and quantitative research. It is okay to do a kind of surface mapping of Whatsapp, but to drill down one needs proper quantitative analysis of what exactly is happening in this field. Good research leads to good policy. Has the Government made any funding available in this space through the Department of Justice and Equality? It seems to me that for small amounts of money - a grant of €10,000 here, a €50,000 grant there - a very solid research platform could be created within the academic field, where there is collaboration between UCC, DIT and so on.
8634	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	157	 If that is mapped, could the witnesses drop the committee a line on where the research landscape is at the moment?
8635	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	159	 Will Ms Cooney provide the committee with a copy of that research?

8640	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	169	 This is the point.
8641	SeanSherlock	Labour	16394.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Cybersecurity: Discussion (Resumed)	171	 I will make one final point and then I am finished. We have a disparate system but everyone is working with the same aim in mind. There might be a role for this committee in trying to map the system. If we can simply map what is happening throughout the Irish landscape, we can begin to work on solutions and outcomes.

8673	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	58	" I was hoping that the witnesses would come before us today with a very clear, metric-driven response to each of the points which were raised in the HIQA report. These points are addressed in quite general terms in the witnesses' statement, but I was hoping that we would be able to go through the six standards with which there was moderate non-compliance, for instance, and that the witnesses would lay out a very clear timeline as to what actions were being taken to address that non-compliance and when they would be completed. I would also like the witnesses to address the two standards with which there was major non-compliance. I am hopeful that the witnesses can come back to us with a very clear, definitive action plan as to when those actions will be completed. I will start with something which is a little bit outside of what has gone before. There was a major incident on the campus in August 2016. There was a fire. The dates of the announced inspections in the HIQA report range from 27 March to 30 March. In that report it is stated that there was moderate non-compliance in respect of standard 9 - premises, safety and security. For instance, ""Staff were found to have inconsistent responses with regard to the procedure to be followed in the event of a fire."" The report identifies that doors were of varying sizes and, in respect of national standards, ""Appropriate annual inspection and testing certificates were not available to demonstrate that the emergency lighting system was in compliance with the appropriate standard."" Notwithstanding the positivity of what the witnesses have presented to the committee regarding deconstruction of some of the cultural, staff and managerial practices and the fact that they are engaged in a process to try to rectify many of these issues, by any fair analysis there is a long way to go if there was a fire in August 2016 and in March 2017, a good number of months later, HIQA was still identifying deficiencies in respect of something as simple as fire safety. That is the first point the witnesses might address. The second point relates to the recent High Court judgment against Oberstown in which the judge clearly stated that there was a limited breach - and I emphasise the word ""limited"" - of constitutional rights in respect of deprivation of physical exercise; loss of contact with families; lack of procedural safeguards relating to the imposition of separate and associated deprivations, particularly the formal written recording of decisions; and regarding imposition of the separation regime. As I understand it, and I would like the witnesses' perspective, this case was taken by four people. It related to a specific incident or incidents which took place in August 2016. Is Oberstown Children Detention Campus still breaching the constitutional rights of citizens - children and young adults - in respect of separation and associated deprivations, particularly in respect of the formal written recording of decisions? Is it still breaching these rights or has it rectified the matter in the intervening period? I am not a lawyer, but the HIQA report of March 2017 would clearly suggest that there was major non-compliance in respect of standard 2 and that ""Some children spent long periods of time in single separation and the reasons for this were not always clearly recorded."" I suggest that, notwithstanding the positivity in the witnesses' embracing of cultural and managerial change in a real and meaningful way, the witnesses still have not dealt with these issues satisfactorily. These are simple issues which can be dealt with without expenditure of major resources and within a short timeframe. When will the witnesses satisfy the committee, the Minister, and the users and staff of this service that this will be rectified?"
8674	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	60	 For the record, in respect of the witnesses being cautious in their response, the High Court judgment is a matter of public record.
8675	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	62	 Is the witness saying the issue has been addressed?
8676	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	64	 The principle is simple.
8677	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	 I thank Mr. Bergin.
8678	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	69	 I am happy to help Mr. Bergin to understand where I am coming from.
8679	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	71	 How many reviews of Oberstown have been carried out over the years? How many reviews have there been in the past five years, for example? I will accept an approximate figure.
8680	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	 I apologise for interrupting. I asked a very specific question. How many reviews have taken place?
8681	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	75	 Okay. That has been over a period of a year. I would say that by any operational standard, if five reviews were carried out internally or externally it would set off some kind of signal or alarm to the effect that action needs to be taken in a short timeframe.
8682	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	77	 I have a final question. Is the management structure flat or hierarchical? Are there any comparable management structures in the public sector? Does it mirror the structure in the Prison Service, the Civil Service or the public service? Is it the case that there is a director and a deputy director with a management team underneath them?
8683	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	79	 Mr. Bergin did not answer Deputy Neville's question about the number of agency staff.
8684	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	81	 What is the turnover of staff?
8685	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	 Okay. I would like to ask about the culture in Oberstown.
8686	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	 Yes. I thank the Chairman for his forbearance. I am very grateful. Can an individual employee feel comfortable in addressing an issue that he or she might have directly to Mr. Bergin, or is there a line of command through which such a person has to go?
8687	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	 Okay.
8688	SeanSherlock	Labour	16408.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	 That might seem obvious, but it is a very important point for us in terms of our understanding.

8705	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 Professors Goldson and Hardwick are referenced in the report. How does what they were doing and what HIQA does differ? Their purpose, according to the report, was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice, to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards. Is that not what HIQA does?
8706	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 The committee has had some consideration of that issue at hand, because it is the one piece we have not had the opportunity to interrogate although, as Ms Dunnion noted, we have sight of the recommendations. Notwithstanding that, I want to understand HIQA's point of view and if she is comfortable now with the cultural and procedural changes and the improvements that have been articulated by the chairman of the board and the chief executive. They have made a submission to this committee and I am pretty sure that Ms Dunnion has had sight of that submission. Is there anything in that submission that has been stated previously that she would critique in any way?
8707	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 On the single separation issue, which I think HIQA adjudicated on the fact that it was not consistently adhered to by staff or management. Obviously there is a process under way where that is being monitored. What methodology does HIQA use? Does it involve inspectors going in and talking to staff, inspecting the physical facilities and so on? How does it actually work?
8708	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	 What criteria do HIQA apply? Presumably, it will use best international practice. What is best international practice for the purposes of the HIQA inspections? HIQA refers to how the authorisations for the approval of the use of single separation and the extension to the time spent in single separation were not always completed by managers in line with policy. One can overcome that by documenting, time keeping and so on, but one must see the justification in the first instance for single separation. As HIQA obviously has regard to best international practice, can Ms Boyle enlighten us as to what best international practice is?
8709	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 The measure of success for those who read the report and examine the Oberstown campus will be evidence of cultural change. I perceive that cultural change is taking place in Oberstown and that it is moving towards a more positive disposition with regard to tackling these issues from a staffing point of view. I also perceive that internal communications have dramatically improved. Are my perceptions correct?
8710	SeanSherlock	Labour	16428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 I do not necessarily expect Ms Boyle to comment on my concluding remarks. If there are real time improvements across all the HIQA standards, it will be necessary for members to see a copy of the Goldson and Hardwick report. It is not enough that we have the recommendations without seeing what is in the body of the report. While I understand that legal issues may arise in respect of the report, if the improvements are taking place in real time, I do not see any reason the committee cannot have regard to the report. We need to have a greater interrogation of the Goldson and Hardwick report. That may not be the correct name but those are the names of the report's authors.

8717	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 I thank the delegates for their attendance. Dr. Muldoon's report presents some sober reading for members. With a certain degree of collective responsibility in mind, it is perhaps an indictment of how the political system engages vis-à-vis protecting the rights of children in this State. My head is slightly hung down on this one because there is a certain sense of embarrassment or shame that the political system has not prioritised the care of our children within the State to the extent that it should. As a Member of the Dáil for ten years at this stage, I also consider myself partly responsible for that to a certain extent. As an individual and a new member to this committee, care of children has not been in the top echelons of political priorities. I say that in a honest and open fashion. In the short time available to me, I wish to speak to Molly's case. I am startled that there are 471 children with severe disabilities who are in foster care, in de facto State care, who need additional supports but who are fighting for those additional supports. I am aware of one case in my own area. Did Molly have a care plan? My understanding is that every child should now have a care plan and that care plan should be followed up upon. If Molly did have a care plan, why was that not acted upon? Whose responsibility was that?
8718	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	" The irony of this is that the person representing the agency that was supposed to provide and enact the care plan was so frustrated that she gave advice to Molly's foster mother. I am delighted that Ms McKenna-Keane is using the term ""foster mother"" because she was caring for her since the age of four months. I am making a kind of aside here but we do not see them as integral to the care of the child in question. They are always living in the fear that the child could be taken from them at any point."
8719	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 The key point here is there was a care plan in place but the resources did not follow the care plan. It is the key point in Molly's case.
8720	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 There are 471 children. In the short time I have, I am trying to drill down into whether the 471 children spoken of in the report are now in the same position as Molly, with the same risk profile pertaining to those children.
8721	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 I would like some forbearance. There was no guardian ad litem in this instance. Is it not the case that there is a serious flaw in the system, where children with severe disabilities not the subject of court cases and availing of the guardian ad litem scenario are already at a disadvantage relative to other children in foster care who are the subject of court cases? The case must now be made that every child with a disability - whether it is a severe, moderate or intellectual disability - in foster care should have a guardian ad litem to advocate independently and ensure those agencies, including Tusla and the HSE, will deliver on those rights.
8722	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 Is this down to a turf war between two agencies?
8723	SeanSherlock	Labour	16477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 It is a turf war and the kids get caught in the middle. That is the bottom line.

We are involved in the process of examining this issue. Very often we hear voices from academia and industry but the most important voices of all are those of the witnesses. What they have done today is to articulate a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and they have done so with such clarity that I want to get copies of their submissions. They have distilled the issues with such clarity that it has given me, as a member of the committee, a clear sense of what we need to achieve now. I express our gratitude to the witnesses. I have a few questions arising from the submissions. My first question is for Ms Reynolds on the role of parents. We are trying hard to grapple with where parents come into the equation. Do the witnesses think the vast majority of parents have the confidence to monitor, as Ms Reynolds said, the activity of their children online so they can make the Internet safe for their children?
8734	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Cybersecurity for Children and Young Adults: Discussion (Resumed)	19	 How would this be done? If I asked Ms Reynolds to design a workshop or programme to educate or help parents would she do it in the school community or in the sporting community? If I gave her €1 million to design a programme for the country, what would be her vision and how would she do it? Would it be done during school time or out of school time? Parents are looking for programmes they can grab onto in their communities so they can educate themselves. Mr. Burke spoke about peer to peer programmes and young people teaching young people but there is a big gap in adults' minds on this issue. Will Ms Reynolds give me a sense of this? It might help in the devising of schemes here also.

Probably like most people, I am somewhere in the middle. One does not necessarily have to fully understand the technology to be able to use it. I am an early adopter of technology but I am probably in the minority. The majority of people do not feel confident about trying to reach in and understand what their children are doing. Where is Comhairle na nÓg on this? It has its charter. How do we implement the charter? How do we get it to a point where every citizen in the country, young and old, has a sense we are designing a safe place for people to inhabit when they use the Internet? How do we get there?

Do the witnesses believe there is a cut-off point with regard to children and young adults? Smartphones have been spoken about quite a bit recently, and people are saying children under the age of 12 or 16 should not have access to a smartphone. What is the view of the witnesses on this? Ms Muireann Whelan wants to answer it.

We have had some engagement with the Department of Education and Skills and with parents about the role of teachers. What I am picking up from the witnesses is that it depends on what school someone goes to. Some teachers are very confident with technology and some are not. Should we start rolling out programmes at undergraduate level for teachers in training so they do a compulsory module on Internet safety? They would then be able to roll out programmes in their classes through RSE and other programmes.

There is so much that is in what the witnesses have said that I am finding it hard to internalise it in live stream, so to speak. It is devastatingly pertinent and, thankfully, there is a language relating to it that is coherent. I thank the witnesses for that because this is what we, as legislators, really need to hear. We are getting down to the nub of the matter. I wish to speak specifically to the Data Protection Bill. Professor O'Sullivan referred to section 29, which acts coterminously to Article 8 of the regulation. We have had before the committee entities that represent the rights of children state with goodwill and solid bona fides that the digital age of consent should be retained or legislated for at 13. Professor O'Sullivan makes the point that there is a distinction to be made between the article and the legislation. In other words - and this is what I want clarification on - is he saying that the article is not about a child's general capacity to enter into a contract?

I shall quote the antiquated language used in the law of contract in Irish common law. It states: Where necessaries are sold and delivered to a minor he must pay a reasonable price for them. Necessaries in this section are defined as meaning “goods suitable to the condition in life of [a minor] ... and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and delivery"". If this aspect of the law is left in place and not amended, it seems possible that a minor will have the capacity, at 13 years, to consent to the processing of his or her personal data but will not have the capacity to enter into the substantive contract in question on the grounds that it is not one for necessaries."

I need an explanation as to how that would work in practical terms. Ireland is one of the most innovative countries in the world and nine out of the top ten ""born on the Internet"" companies are here. Their European, Middle East and Asian, EMEA, headquarters are operating out of Dublin. We have the Insight Centre, a Science Foundation Ireland-funded body. We are investing significantly in big data analytics. The innovation the witnesses are talking about to crack that code could be done on the island of Ireland. We have the scientific personnel and the excellence in science to be able to do it. I want to get the witnesses' perspective on the fear I have. The top companies I referred to have commercial sensitivities and are looking for market share. My fear is that if one tries to legislate for or create the innovations to block and filter access, Mr. Facebook, CEO, or Ms Facebook, CEO, and others may ring the Taoiseach to say they do not like what we are doing in Ireland where they have made a solid commitment to their investments. The threat of pulling out could be used to push back."

8767	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 I will do a rapid-fire question-and-answer session within my five minutes. I thank the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group for appearing before the committee today. The presence of the group reaffirms the work done previously by the group. It refreshes our memories with regard to the 30 recommendations made by the group. I wish to ask about the recommendations, especially with regard to the office of the digital safety commissioner. What is the understanding of the group representatives at present of the nature of that office and how it should be constituted?
8768	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 My second question relates to what Professor O'Neill said about the digital age of consent. We took part in lengthy deliberations last week with Dr. Mary Aiken, who is also a member of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group and Professor Barry O'Sullivan. They are advocating for the age to be 16 years. They made compelling arguments for the age to be increased from 13 years to 16 years. Can Professor O'Neill enlighten us with his understanding of the interpretation of the EU regulation as it relates to the distinction between Internet freedoms and a 13-year-old child yielding all personal data to a website, social media site or whatever? Can Professor O'Neill understand that some of us are fearful of keeping it at 13 years and not increasing it to 16 years? We fear that if a child at the age of 13 years is yielding all this information to an unknown entity, then that information can be used for all manner of nefarious reasons. It is possibly the case that we misunderstand what is in the regulation. I am keen to hear the opinion of the group representatives. I will focus the question towards Mr. Lupton.
8769	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 We have to be specific-----
8770	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 I have a final question.
8771	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	 May I please-----
8772	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	52	 In support of the other speakers-----
8773	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	 -----may I ask that we not hear an intervention from Professor O'Neill at this stage? I am asking the committee to move to the other speakers.
8774	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	145	 I seek clarification on the law of contract as it relates to the law of the land and the law of contract as it relates to the GDPR and this regulation. In other words, is the 13-year old entering into a contract for the procurement of services and does the law of the land not supersede that law, in effect?
8775	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	147	 Could Mr. Lupton give the short answer?
8776	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	149	 In other words, the law of the land could supersede it if it is put to the test, the age of consent being 13.
8777	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	175	 I sincerely thank the Ministers for appearing before the committee today. Which of the Ministers present will have responsibility for the digital safety commissioner when that office is established? We need a clear unambiguous answer to that question. The Internet content governance advisory group was constituted in 2013. One of its recommendations was that there would be a specific senior or junior Minister responsible. We need to find out who has political responsibility for online safety. My second question is for the Minister for Justice and Equality. Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Driscoll, and Mr. Declan Daly appeared before the committee in October. They told us that fewer than 100 Garda personnel were involved in the Garda national protective services bureau and under that the online child exploitation unit. They give us clear figures on the number of personnel, but it amounts to fewer than 100 people, if civilians are included. If we are talking about cybercrime and the protection of children and minors, we need to better resource the Garda national protective services bureau. Having additional numbers there would go a long way to the cause of protecting children effectively. We were all disgusted by the Horan case. The initial inquiry on that case came from an American intervention on a Gmail account. That set off a chain of events in the investigation. Had that email not come from the authorities in America or had there not been an intervention on that, the Horan case might not have come to light. I speak about resources specifically in that case. I know the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is a very strong advocate of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We are all very supportive of the STEM initiatives in the junior and senior cycles and the short courses in the junior cycle. Some parents argue that it is the responsibility of the schools to look after online safety - to teach the children or young adults well so to speak. Insufficient resources are allocated to the professional development service for teachers, PDST. We need more resources for PDST because the translational effect is not happening in every school and we need to reach beyond post primary and right down into primary level. We need to educate teachers and make them online safety advocates. We should appoint an online safety advocate in every school or region so that they can deploy a lot of these resources in teaching across regions.
8778	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	177	 As it is a technological issue, I would start with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.
8779	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	 Is that still a live report?
8780	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	 Is the Minister saying the digital safety commissioner will not come under his Department's remit?
8781	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	 We need guidance as to where that will sit.
8782	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	233	 I also asked a supplementary question on that issue. Perhaps the Minister may------
8783	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	235	" I thank the Chair. In terms of the EU general data protection regulation, GDPR, on the age of consent, section 29 of the Data Protection Bill 2018 provides that, ""The age of a child specified for the purposes of Article 8 is 13 years of age."" Article 8 itself says that, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. It also states that member states by law can provide for a lower age, not below 13. Processing the data of a child below that age is lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. Following on from Senator Freeman's question, how does the common law of contracts apply to the Minister's proposed legislation? In other words, as I understand it, under Irish common law, which has not been updated for a long time, a minor does not have full capacity to contract. That is my understanding. In the circumstances in which the Minister is devising legislation, it seems, on the face of it, to give consent for the minor to enter into a contract to yield onto the relevant service provider whatever service it happens to be, personal details and enter into a contract. Is there a distinction to be made here between where a transaction takes place or does not take place? Does the law supersede the new legislation, or does the new legislation supersede the law of the land as it relates to contract? I hope that makes sense."
8784	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	240	 I would like to contribute on the same point?
8785	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	256	 With the Ministers' forbearance, may I ask a final question for clarification purposes?
8786	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	258	 I am sure the Ministers will not mind.
8787	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	260	 Could you give me ten seconds?
8788	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	262	 It is just ten seconds. I beg your indulgence.
8789	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	266	 Initially, I asked about the age of consent and the issuing of entering a contract. The new article is not about a child's general capacity to enter into a contract but it is about a child's capacity to consent to the processing of personal data. The Minister has answered that but I want full and final clarification because it speaks to the issue of the digital age of consent being either 13 or 16. I am scared that if the age is 13, one might be entering into a contract to give up all one's data to an entity. That is why I remain to be convinced, along with this committee, on the matter. It is a general point.

8813	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 I was very impressed by the submission because it gets to the nub of the issue and provides a set of recommendations that are easily digestible for generalists such as ourselves. I welcome the submission that has been provided here today. I tend to ask rapid-fire questions, if I may. The W82GO! team is a multidisciplinary one. How many multidisciplinary teams are in this country?
8814	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 Is the W82GO! team the only one?
8815	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 Why has the team not been replicated throughout the regions? Why must a child who presents in Cork, Kerry or Limerick travel to Temple Street Children's University Hospital in Dublin?
8816	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 If I understand what has been said correctly as a layman, is it appropriate that severe cases are referred to the centre of excellence in Temple Street Children's University Hospital? Yes. As a former Minister of State who had responsibility for research, I note the team has clinical leads and I seek to understand both the resourcing and the research element in this regard. The W82GO! multidisciplinary team receives funding from the Temple Street Foundation and the HSE. Have peer-reviewed research papers and outputs been produced? Obviously the research is peer reviewed as Ms Sheridan has nodded her head. I seek an insight into what is happening on the research side.
8817	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 The HRB.
8818	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 Yes.
8819	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 I am happy to hear from other people on this matter. Research is a particular area of interest for me because I know that strong peer-reviewed research leads to successful outcomes. It has been stated that as many as 145,000 children attend the hospital every year and the team has extrapolated a figure of 4,000. Am I correct?
8820	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	 Yes. Am I correct to say that there were 4,000 attendances in the years 2014 to 2018, inclusive?
8821	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 It has also been stated that 49% of patients in 2017 were aged under ten years. Is the unit conducting live research into the types of children who attend in terms of demographics, backgrounds and the psychosocial elements? Does all of that form part of the research? There are short, medium and long-term effects. I note that the unit is part of Growing Up in Ireland, the national longitudinal study of children. Has the research and study had a bearing on the issue? Fundamentally, this committee wants to find ways to stamp out obesity. What tools are needed to tackle the problem? To me, research is one element. Obviously resources are required to be invested in the clinical area. If I have read the situation correctly, there are not enough clinicians working in the sector as it is relatively new. What can we do about that aspect?
8822	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 I want to discuss the statement that families with financial challenges are more likely to be prone to obesity and 40% of the children who attend the unit come from seriously deprived backgrounds. How do those facts present themselves? I am open to hearing about this matter from other witnesses too.
8823	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 Is that element the exception or the norm?
8824	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	 How can we disrupt that dynamic and improve things? People have called for safe play environments for children.
8825	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 Yes.

8832	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	 I thank the Chairman for his indulgence. Let us say the witnesses were given a magic wand tomorrow that granted them all of the resources they needed. What would the development of an implementation plan and evaluation framework for the provision of services to children and adolescents with clinical obesity throughout Ireland look like in real terms? Would it be a case of staging what Dr. O'Malley is doing and scaling it out to the regions or would it be a question of adding more layers of resources to what she is doing with her team?
8833	SeanSherlock	Labour	16541.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	 Can I take it from Dr. O'Malley's request for increased funding that there a shortage of funding?

8867	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	97	 Dr. McCrory said that 19% of children aged three are overweight and 6% are obese and that 50% of obese children will become obese adolescents. How do we disrupt the behaviour? What happens to the other 50% who do not become obese? Where do the two cohorts separate, one becoming obese and the other non-obese? This committee's goal is to support anything that disrupts behaviour. Both programmes before us, Food Dudes and Super Troopers, are about behavioural change. How do we create Government policies that give effect to disrupting behaviour in a positive way?
8868	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	99	 I was going to come to that. My next question was going to be about the zero to three-year age category. Dr. McCrory spoke about breastfeeding and it being a disrupter of obesity in kids. Will he give me some sense of how we can disrupt behaviours at a much earlier age?
8869	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	101	 Some 54% of parents of overweight children and 20% of parents of obese children in the Growing Up in Ireland cohort reported that they were about the right weight for their height. Will Dr. McCrory help us to understand how it is possible to get into those houses? He made a specific reference to lower socio-economic groups having a greater propensity towards obesity. If children have already been involved in an early childhood scheme, a crèche and primary and post-primary education, how do we talk to or educate the parents? Are we talking about public health nurses having a role or direct intervention in primary healthcare services? Are we talking about resourcing such interventions to a greater extent or carrying out studies to a greater extent? Where does the intervention take place to disrupt behaviours in the zero to three-year age cohort?
8870	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	103	 The metrics Dr. McCrory has shown us create a picture that is - I am not saying it is dystopian - negative. If we are talking about a longitudinal societal scenario, for want of a better expression, the future does not look too bright. Is Dr. McCrory suggesting we have more public health nurses at the very early intervention stage and that their role be expanded? We all know what they do at the early childhood stage, but are we talking about greater public interventions and developing a cohort of public health nurses who would deal specifically with trying to disrupt that pattern? Does that make sense?
8871	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	105	 Dr. McCrory is in Trinity College Dublin, as is Professor David Hevey. Has Dr. McCrory spoken to him about the Laya Healthcare research?
8872	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	107	 I am a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and a great believer in breaking down silos. We can see the effects of the research when we look at the translational elements of the Laya Healthcare and Super Troopers programmes. The metrics for the satisfaction levels under the Super Troopers programme probably somewhere map the GUI longitudinal study. When we, as a society, start breaking down silos and get two eminent researchers such as Dr. McCrory and Professor Hevey to work across platforms such as psychology and health, perhaps we might start to see the programmes have a greater translational effect. I thank Dr. McCrory for his interaction. I have been reading the Super Troopers handbook which is mightily impressive. I have a little fellow at home who is almost ten months of age and look forward to engaging in the animal antics, doing the scissors jumps, the pasta dance, the magic numbers and taking part in the ball alley and potato races. It is about creating something that is about fun and subtle behavioural change. It is very positive. The statistics for take-up rates by schools speak for themselves. There were 330 primary schools in the pilot project; there are now 1,500 schools, with 238,000 children. If we, as policymakers, can do anything to help to have it fully translated into all schools, I ask Dr. McCrory to please contact us. It is a very worthy programme. Perhaps we might kick the tyres a little more on the research Professor Hevey has conducted and then bring it back to the Government and especially the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health. I would love to see bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland putting more funding into this space to see if we can really disrupt the trajectory towards obesity. I do not need to tell Laya Healthcare how much it is costing by way of interventions every year. We all pay our subscriptions to the Layas and VHIs of this world. Our premia are increasing and this is obviously because we have community rating and we are funding more and more health interventions for probably preventable diseases. Therefore, anything we as policymakers can do that, in the long term, supports such initiatives as Super Troopers, we absolutely must do. The one question I have is where this needs to go. If the witnesses had one ask of Government as to the next steps, what would it be? They mentioned resources earlier. Are they satisfied they have the resources to take this a step further? What would be their wish list if they had the Minister for Health or the Taoiseach here, for instance? Mr. O'Connor can answer the questions after Ms O'Reilly.

Perhaps we could also write to the Taoiseach directly to see if there is any way we could either meet with him or facilitate some meetings between the stakeholders here and the Taoiseach, with a view to seeing how we can translate a programme such as this right across the schools and whether there is anything we can do to assist the programme.

8879	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	123	 And the Taoiseach.
8880	SeanSherlock	Labour	16583.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	126	 On that point, Ms O'Reilly referred to the active flag and the fact that Super Troopers is a stakeholder in that regard. We have all visited schools as Deputies and Senators where there has been the raising of a green flag, and one need only see how that behavioural change is having an effect translating into the home. I have not seen the evidence of this yet in respect of the active flags. That is not to say it does not exist; I just have not seen any research. If we are talking about positive public health policy, obviously there would have to be some more tyre-kicking regarding the research the witnesses have conducted. However, I do not see any reason that could not be done. If we are serious about tackling obesity, it will require the deployment of resources, and if there are programmes that one can just take on or partner with, that is the model we must use because there is an evidence base here of it having an effect. This is why I would love Dr. McCrory to talk to Professor Hevey. Perhaps that can be facilitated because that is the space we need to be in. The different sides are quite complementary, I would argue, and they are both within the same organisation. If there is a way of talking to one another to see how we can work on this one and come up with practical solutions, we should try to do so.

8899	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	 Does Mr. Elliot mean in the context of safeguarding?
8900	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 Yes.
8901	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	45	 I thank the Chairman for his generosity.
8902	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	 I do not know where to start because I am flabbergasted at some of the evidence that has been presented to us. I want to gain a deeper understanding of the distinction between governance and safeguarding issues. There will be some repetition in the delegates' answers. Mr. Ian Elliott has been appointed to look at a sample of between 500 and 600 cases in which safeguarding issues arise, dating back to 2003. Is that correct?
8903	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	75	 There is a box of files on all of the cases somewhere within the bowels of Scouting Ireland. Is that what the delegates are telling us? We are talking about paper files.
8904	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	77	 The Garda, Tusla and all of the relevant agencies-----
8905	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	79	 The CEO has been in office since 2012. Has he been involved in any of the safeguarding cases since his appointment?
8906	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	81	 That is not what I am asking about. My question is specific. Has the CEO been involved directly between both parties - the complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been made?
8907	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	 Therefore, Dr. Lawlor has been directly involved in specific cases as CEO.
8908	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	 In normal circumstances is it appropriate for the CEO to be directly involved in safeguarding cases?
8909	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	 Yes.
8910	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	 I am looking for help to understand this issue. It is probably awkward to ask Mr. Elliot the question when the CEO is sitting beside him, but the CEO has brought in Mr. Elliot to do a job and I will proceed on that basis. There are a number of sample cases on file during the tenure of the CEO and Mr. Elliot is going through an internal process, albeit with an external consultant. I have dealt with him in the past on the Cloyne report. Historically, we have had much engagement on the national board for safeguarding children in the Catholic Church. Had it not been for him, the Cloyne report would never have seen the light of day. We did a great deal of work on it and I appreciate the work he has done in safeguarding children. However, I have a difficulty in understanding why, for instance, if an investigation is ongoing into a sample number of files during the CEO's tenure, the board and the CEO have not stepped aside from the process and the investigation has not become a fully external process on the basis that there is considerable taxpayer funding at play and there is a massive disparity between the ordinary experiences of the leader of a scout troop and the children and those who operate in the upper echelons of the organisation. This speaks to the issue of governance to which I will come shortly. Should the entire board and leadership step aside while the process is ongoing and should somebody else step in to act as an honest broker in order that everybody can have confidence in the process?
8911	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	 That is the safeguarding element, about which there are further questions. However, the Minister suddenly announced the appointment of Ms Jillian van Turnhout, a former Oireachtas Member. I still do not have a proper understanding of what her role will be. She is the Minister's appointee, but what will she do exactly? What is Mr. Elliot's interpretation of her role in this process?
8912	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	94	 Is it Mr. Burbridge's understanding Ms van Turnhout does not yet have a sense of what her role will be? Did she articulate that to him?
8913	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	96	 This is an issue because, as a committee, we are still in the dark. Last week in the Dáil I asked a question about Scouting Ireland, but I am still none the wiser about what Ms van Turnhout's role will be.
8914	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	98	 I do not need them. I will continue with my questioning.
8915	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	100	 I appreciate that, but it would be good to have Scouting Ireland's perspective. As yet, there has been no articulation of or contact on the terms of reference and how the investigation, whatever it will entail, will proceed. We are, therefore, still a little in the dark in that sense. I refer again to the issue of governance. Reference was made to a new board of directors. Dr. Lawlor is subjecting himself to an internal process to appoint a new board of directors to reflect the new realities in which he finds himself. That is not an appropriate way in which to proceed and he should subject the board's governance procedures to an external review, whether it is the van Turnhout review or another. I refer to the public, individual scout leaders, scouts, cubs and volunteers, in particular. How are they going to be confident, if they are not fully confident at present, that the new board of directors has clean hands and will result in a new culture with stronger and more robust governance procedures? I have questions about whether there have been documented complaints made by volunteers - this is adult scout leaders - against members of the board, right up to CEO level, or other staff, or whether there have been allegations of bullying, for instance. Have reports been commissioned by Scouting Ireland to examine complaints and the mechanisms by which it can resolve those complaints in a mediated fashion? Have the reports been published and have they been provided, for instance, to all parties involved? Those are just some of the questions that are still on our minds, which have not been presented to us here as representatives of taxpayers' interests in relation to the submissions today. We do not know if there are any legal cases open against the organisation by volunteers for alleged harassment, for instance. If we are talking about change management and if it is a change management structure from within and the board is hoping to bring all of these people with it, I suggest that it does not necessarily have the confidence of a lot of people in the organisation on the ground. I am a layman in this regard but my perception is that what the board is trying to do is to give effect to change internally and trying to manage it internally using the same people and the same resources.
8916	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	 The witnesses do not have to answer the question if they do not want to.
8917	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	105	 In the interests of transparency, it is in everybody's interest that the witnesses are as forthcoming as possible with this committee because the answers and the truth will out ultimately on these processes anyway.
8918	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	108	 Who is managing that process?
8919	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	110	 Mr. Burbridge should forgive my ignorance, but he is honorary vice president of Scouting Ireland and the team lead on this crisis and he is also managing the change management.
8920	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	113	 I am only getting warmed up.
8921	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	115	 I appreciate that answer because at least it gives me some knowledge that this is subject to some sort of external tyre-kicking, if one wants to call it that. What the volunteers need is some signalling from the upper echelons that change management is going on because they are floored by what is going on at present. They were not too happy at the fact that Scouting Ireland did not come before the committee sooner because it created a very bad perception. That said, I appreciate the fact that Scouting Ireland is here today. I did ask whether there are internal reports on complaints. Are there internal complaints about bullying and harassment? I think that is a fair question. It can be answered. I do not think there is a legal impediment to it being answered. First I am trying to establish whether there are complaints of bullying within the organisation or complaints by volunteers or individual scout leaders and, second, that a process is under way to deal with them in a robust fashion.
8922	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	118	 I am trying to understand the process.
8923	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	 Could I ask for a little bit of indulgence, just for two minutes?
8924	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	122	 Deputy Mitchell has nodded in affirmation of my request.
8925	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	124	 I appreciate that. The Chairman took a fair amount of time himself. I will wrap it up, so to speak. Are there live cases of bullying and harassment? Does Dr. Lawlor as CEO deal directly with those cases or is there a process under way where a staff member deals with the case?
8926	SeanSherlock	Labour	16590.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-05-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	 Has Dr. Lawlor dealt with cases?

8955	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	22	 We all know where this is going.
8956	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	28	 I join in welcoming Mr. Regan to the committee today. We have heard of a number of tremendous and positive initiatives. It is good to have crystallisation of what the GAA is doing right down to the local community, because sometimes we think of the GAA in binary terms, whether hurling or football, camogie or handball and so on. Often, we think of the GAA in binary terms and in an intercounty context only. As policymakers we might not fully appreciate what happens across the land except perhaps through the prism of our individual clubs. Given that we are good parochial people, I am keen to hear more about the fun and run activity. My club in Mallow, County Cork, has world-class facilities. We have a multimillion euro facility. It is something that could be used as a hub for the Munster region for outworking in that regard. I would be delighted to work with the GAA on this. We should not simply look at the facility in terms of Mallow but from the Munster or regional perspective given its specific location. Perhaps I will share more with Mr. Regan on that afterwards. We cannot underestimate the metrics Mr. Regan has given us today. The key metric is the top-line metric, which is a total of 142,467 participants in the Cúl Camps. It is the biggest child sport promotion in the world. That is a phenomenal metric for what is an indigenous sport when we look at it in global terms. We should be shouting that metric from the rooftops. It is testament to the lateral thinking that now exists within the GAA. The GAA sees itself as having a clear social function. The association sees itself as having responsibilities to its community right down to the neighbourhood. Committee members are delighted to hear the metric in the context of our deliberations on tackling obesity. Does Mr. Regan believe more needs to be done in outreach to primary schools? Are some primary schools not being reached? Is the ability to get in the front door hampered for certain reasons? If so, what are the reasons?
8957	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	30	 Excellent.
8958	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	34	 I have another question on primary schools and how to reach a penetration rate of 100%. Mr. Regan stated that the GAA is willing to reach out into other areas. He referred to the principle of getting basic movements, how the GAA does not claim ownership of this, and how the association is willing to work with others. The committee will have to make recommendations. If Mr. Regan were to make recommendations, is there anything he would recommend by way of an action to try to reach a 100% penetration rate for every school so that every child in the country could hit that target?
8959	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	36	 My last question is more of a shout-out for handball.
8960	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	38	 It is a minority sport.
8961	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	40	 We have produced world champions in handball in my great town of Mallow and have invested heavily, through sports capital funding, in retrofitting our club. I would always put my hand up for having handball. The GAA, from a global perspective, should consider that sport. It is developing slowly but it could develop quickly if it was given a global platform. I would welcome if handball could be translated into the work Mr. Regan is doing and be considered in some of these initiatives, particularly with respect to catching, throwing, forward movement and so on.
8962	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Tackling Childhood Obesity: Discussion (Resumed)	42	 Indeed.

8980	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	144	 That is a straight question.

8983	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	150	 It is Q4.
8984	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	 How much is Tusla is paying Q4 for the engagement of such services?
8985	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	154	 I need an answer.
8986	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	156	 Does Mr. McBride acknowledge that this is taxpayers' money? We need a full breakdown of these costs being incurred by the taxpayer for the consultancy services Tusla has procured for preparation for events such as this one. Will Tusla explain in ten seconds or less if the Signs of Safety programme is dependent on assurances and commitments given by families themselves regarding their interaction with Tusla? How can Tusla be sure the programme works in real terms?
8987	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	158	 If a child is at risk, particularly in a sexual abuse case, who is Tusla relying on for communications? Is it the child or the adults within that relationship?
8988	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	160	 I did not understand what Dr. Gillen meant by being loaded through the front door and more senior social workers are at the front door. What does that mean?
8989	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	162	 Mr. McBride said there were 53,000 referrals last year.
8990	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	164	 Does that mean all senior staff are at the front door------
8991	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	167	 Hold on. I will finish my question. Does that mean all senior staff are involved in ensuring there is absolute capture? Yesterday's Irish Examiner states: Tusla failed to address 65 abuse cases despite concerns children were still at “potential risk”; Tusla closed 164 suspected child sexual abuse cases despite not knowing if the matters were resolved. How can anyone watching these proceedings be reassured when Mr. McBride is telling us that Tusla does not have enough staff, that there is a massive rate of attrition and that there is only a small cohort of senior staff which is not increasing to any great extent? How can the witnesses assure us that when cases are presented at the so-called front door of Tusla they will be filtered, assessed for risk and managed properly? Tusla got an additional €40 million last year and its overall resources for 2018 amount to approximately €753 million. The organisation is in receipt of three quarters of a billion in taxpayers' money, yet HIQA reports are showing utterly disgraceful failures on the part of Tusla. Are the witnesses not ashamed of the fact that this situation pertains? I direct that last question to Mr. McBride, as head of the organisation.
8992	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	 Is that a high priority case?
8993	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	 Page 46 of the report notes a 72% reduction in high priority open cases awaiting allocation. Where is the filtration process and who decides what is high priority? Clearly, in 65 of those cases, notwithstanding injunctions and so forth, delays occurred. That is the fact of the matter.

8995	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	 I wish to raise two other issues which may have been dealt with in my absence. I had to go to the Dáil Chamber earlier so if this has already been answered, I apologise. How do the witnesses explain the fact that supervisors do not have the appropriate training in managing child sexual abuse cases, including retrospective allegations? Were the witnesses aware of this and, if so, how can they stand over it? I also remind the witnesses that I want an answer to the question I posed on quarter 4. My final question is on CARI, an organisation with which Tusla interacts. I have relatives living in the Munster area who are waiting for an appointment with CARI for their child. The child is in a state of turmoil but I will not go into the details here. Why have I not been able to get an answer as to the reason that child is still awaiting an appointment?
8996	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	 That is not an answer.
8997	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	 Hold on one second. That is not an answer. The question-----
8998	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	186	 I am getting a bit exercised because the witness is playing down the clock.
8999	SeanSherlock	Labour	16632.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-20 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	188	 There are children out there who have been sexually abused who are awaiting appointments and as of now, they have not been able to get them with organisations such as CARI with which Tusla has service level agreements or for which it is responsible. I want a straight answer.

9031	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 I would like to join in welcoming all the witnesses here before the committee today. Their submissions are very interesting, and there are some very pragmatic and practical recommendations therein. They are based on common sense but very often common sense is not applied when one is trying to conduct a public policy and a set of outcomes that have a beneficial effect for the general population. We all have an instinctive view on what needs to happen, but then how is that translated into practical policies and actions? That is what we are trying to get to the nub of here in this committee. We are trying to come up with a report that has very practical suggestions. The witnesses' recommendations are very beneficial to that process. Before I question anybody, I want to congratulate Mr. John Treacy on his appointment as chairman of the board of Concern. It is a very welcome appointment, which I think we would all wholeheartedly welcome. On the Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study of 2010, the witness has openly acknowledged in his submission that it now needs to be updated and made fit for purpose for 2018, 2019 and onwards. Could I ask if the effects of the use of technology are mapped onto that study in any way? Has the use and preponderance of technology in homes and society been examined? The reason I ask is we are hearing that technology has a massively negative impact on very basic activity levels in children, and other people who have submitted to this process here have said that. Is that part of the study?
9032	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 Who owns that study? Is Sport Ireland just a participant?
9033	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 Where is the academic research being carried out?
9034	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	 That is fine. I think it would be useful for us-----
9035	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	 I appreciate that. Two hours of screen time seems almost nostalgic by today's standards, which is ironic. If they are to report in November, which is only a few months away, and if that is not included in the study, it would be very useful for us to know, perhaps through Sport Ireland or one of the other stakeholders, whether the use of technology is being mapped onto those types of longitudinal studies. It would be useful to us and our work here. When we speak about obesity in Ireland, we speak about targeting lower socio-economic groups. I often wonder how that happens in real terms. Can Mr. Treacy give a practical example of a local sports partnership, of the 29 on the €6 million budget line, where there is a clear targeting of a lower socio-economic group?
9036	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 I appreciate that. If some clear examples of those projects could be outlined to the committee, it would help us in drafting our report. Perhaps Dr. May could outline in that submission how this could be replicated across a number of different areas. We need practical examples like that to help us in our work. I am grateful for that. safefood is a North-South body. What is the budget of the Start programme?
9037	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 It is less than €1 million.
9038	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	" I do not quite understand the expression Dr. Foley-Nolan used at the outset to the effect that we almost see the situation as ""inevitable and insoluble"". I cannot think like that, and we cannot think like that as a committee. I have to be optimistic about what we can achieve and keep driving on and pursuing this issue. I do not see it as being necessarily inevitable and insoluble. Can Dr. McGloin give us a high-level view of how the START programme works? It may not be possible today. There is a €900,000 budget line. It is across the island of Ireland. Is safefood trying to reach into schools or into houses? I note the recommendations of improvements in co-ordination between community and hospital-based health professionals, the 70:30 ratio for healthy eating and physical activity and more community cooking programmes such as Cook It. How is safefood translated across those initiatives? That is what I am trying to understand."

I am working on the assumption that most parents have common sense. I am not talking about educational attainment, what socio-economic group they are in or anything like that. Is Dr. McGloin saying to me that Irish parents are expressing concerns about what constitutes proper screen time? Are we at that level of-----
9040	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	 Change is needed.
9041	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	 Could Dr. McGloin send us a note on that? That is practical and would be helpful.

9053	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 I welcome the Minister here today. She has given us some very devastating news based on what she heard late last night. We heard that there are 71 alleged abusers historically and 108 survivors that we know about. It is pertinent for us to empathise with the fact that there are potentially more than 108 people out there who are potentially traumatised by their experiences. When Mr. Elliott came before us on 9 May he gave an undertaking that he would look at the historical cases pre-2003 and the review has come up with that devastating news. In light of this news very late last night I want to get an understanding of the Minister's interaction with the new board in terms of how she and the Department will deal with it. Is it the case that all bets are now off regarding future funding until such time as the situation is clarified and rectified? Notwithstanding what I have said, I should add a proviso to the effect that 99.9% of those involved in Scouting Ireland are honest, decent volunteers who are doing an excellent job and will be devastated by the news. They will be traumatised by this as well and they will want the funding to continue. How do we find a mechanism to ensure that scouting continues and that the new board, which we wish well and which has been given a clean slate, can operate and that we find a mechanism to deal with the historical issues and also ensure that scouting can continue safely and without any cloud hanging over it? The Minister's human response will perhaps give some solace to people who are honest and decent and who constitute the vast majority of scouters, their parents and friends. We need to hear from her on how it is intended to deal with the issue.
9054	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 A lot of our focus in the main meeting of the committee was on the barrister's report on the alleged event that took place in 2009. This new information is shocking.
9055	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 I am viscerally shocked by the information we have received today. I want to get clarity in my own mind that the Minister is satisfied that those files have now been sent to the Garda. Given that the Minister only received the information late last night I would like to know what has occurred, procedurally, in the less than 12 hours or so since she has been in receipt of the information. I am sure we will have an opportunity to speak to the board in respect of its handling of the issue but I wish to get the Minister's perspective.
9056	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	 If the Minister is telling us there are 71 alleged abusers and that there are 108 victims, is it fair to assume it is only a sample? I am making that assumption and I could be wrong. I would like to be corrected or educated on whether that is the case. If it is only a sample, the question then arises as to whether the Minister or Department has been informed about whether this is representative of a much larger figure that is under investigation.
9057	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	 To try to assist my understanding of this, is it safe to assume that in Larch Hill, there are a number of files in addition to the numbers we are talking about here today?
9058	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	 It is pertinent to this because what it means is that what the Minister is presenting us with today - to speak to the Minister's bona fides - is that the figures she has articulated to us are exactly the number articulated to her as Minister.
9059	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	" We have made a great deal of progress since the witnesses' appearance in May. At that point, there was much that we did not know. Mr. Elliot had said at that stage that records were ""kept securely in fireproof filing cabinets in Larch Hill"" and the Garda and Tusla had been informed about that. We are a number of months on in the process and we have a picture of the number of alleged abusers. We may not have been presented with a finite number but we understand that it is an iterative ongoing process and that the number of victims may increase as well. As he said, in the case of one or more alleged perpetrators there are no files. I am satisfied as to the openness of Scouting Ireland's engagement with us today in ensuring that there is confidence on the part of Members present but, most important, on the part of the ordinary decent people who give of their time every day to the organisation and those who fund the organisation, namely the taxpayers. Notwithstanding the devastating numbers of people who are survivors or victims, some of whom are deceased, we cannot even imagine on a human level what the survivors are going through at present. It is unconscionable. We have to have some confidence in the fact that the organisation is now, to use its own phrase, ""taking ownership"" of the issue and that they are putting in place a victims policy. That certainly gives me some confidence. Is Scouting Ireland making a financial contingency on its books for a number of cases where the DPP decides that there is a nolle prosequi with some cases because of insufficient evidence? I do not want to presume the outcome here but, for example, there was a recognition in the Cloyne diocesan investigation where certain cases came before the court with the same modus operandi that on the balance of probabilities etc. that there was enough proof, notwithstanding the lack of proof in the book of evidence, and that there should be some form of compensation. Is the new board discussing those issues? I do not expect the board to say that it is but I want this issue on the agenda to get some sense from the organisation that it is dealing with that issue."
9060	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	 There are precedents in cases brought to the DPP where nolle prosequi was the determination of that office but there was an acknowledgement by the organisation that abuse took place. Is Scouting Ireland discussing the possibility that some fund will be made available for financial compensation or for services to be wrapped around the person in question?
9061	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	 Is litigation outstanding?
9062	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	 Can Ms Kelly say how many cases are outstanding?
9063	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	 But Ms Kelly acknowledges that there are cases outstanding specifically in respect of alleged abuse.
9064	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	 I would like further engagement with the committee regarding progress on those matters. The second issue is the complaints policy. Ms Kelly's intervention deals with three thematic areas: safeguarding; accountability and disciplinary policy. As a member of this committee, I wish the new board well. The mood music has changed on ensuring that there is a new transparency in how matters are dealt with. The new board has received a strong mandate from the individual members of the scouting organisation. When it comes to a new disciplinary policy, am I correct that the organisation has engaged an employment lawyer who has externally reviewed the policies, and that it has adopted new procedures since 18 November?
9065	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	 If there are complaints then, for instance, by a senior member of the organisation against an individual, which were registered prior to that, what is the status of those complaints now?
9066	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	 It does but only to a certain point, because I am in receipt of correspondence about individuals. There are outstanding issues that I want to deal with. There is, for instance, a complaint against an individual who is now the subject of a disciplinary procedure because he was critical of a senior officer within the organisation. There are allegations against the complainant by a senior officer of the organisation, who has stated in a letter that the complainant has actively supported criticism of him and of his performance of his duties and has called for his resignation. The person who called for the resignation of the senior person is now being brought in front of Scouting Ireland under page 11 of the disputes and adults policy, etc. When we are members of organisations and put our heads out there, it is likely that people will criticise us. There is a fine line between criticism and something that is actionable or subject to a disciplinary procedure. Has the new board examined whether the four live complaints will proceed? Have they the support of the board?
9067	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	 I am keen to understand the new structures. The voluntary board is disaggregating itself from the procedures. Is that correct?
9068	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	101	 I am suggesting now that this will become a live issue if there are four live complaints. It is something that Ms Kelly, as chairperson, should have cognisance of in respect of the nature of the complaints. That is all I am saying. I am keen to keep this in a positive vein. Again, I thank the representatives of Scouting Ireland for coming before the committee. We have a clear sense and understanding now of where Scouting Ireland is going, and that is important. I wish to ask about the advertising of the safeguarding manager position. Ms Kelly said the safeguarding manager was advertised in the national and international press. When was that exactly?
9069	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	 Scouting Ireland representatives were before the committee in May. In the time since then, was it the position of the board that Scouting Ireland would have an interim position with Mr. Elliot in place and then move to advertising?
9070	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	144	 Is Ms Kelly referring to the barrister's report?
9071	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	146	 As laypersons looking in on Scouting Ireland, we all want to give the organisation a fair wind. However, in the answers being given today I am hearing that the organisation will decide if and when the barrister's report will be published. I want to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and I believe we need to hear something stronger to assure us that there is full transparency around the report. I do not get a sense of that at the moment, on account of the time that has passed.
9072	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	148	 On the disciplinary procedures, I am very heartened to hear that the organisation has brought in an external lawyer with expertise in the area of employment and labour law. However, I and others are in possession of letters about complaints made against individuals. I accept Ms Kelly's statement that there is a disaggregation between her role as a volunteer and as a member of the executive but if she is aware that there are four live complaints, I assume she is aware of the nature and content of those complaints.
9073	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	150	 I am discussing policies and procedures. A submission was before us-----
9074	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	 There is correspondence and we are told a new policy is in place for disciplinary procedures, which was agreed on 18 November. Disciplinary letters were issued prior to that, the content of which I have not gone into. I am trying to ascertain whether the new board had regard to those letters when it was considering the new policy which was agreed on 18 November. In other words, does the new board stand over the letters that were issued and the policy around them?
9075	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	154	 I thank Ms Kelly for her frankness, which is refreshing. There needs to be a clear demarcation between roles and everything should be upfront. A person who is listening to this meeting and who may be the subject of a complaint will know that there is a policy and procedures for how the complaint is dealt with. I wish the new board well. There will be a role for us in seeking to examine how the transition between the old and new boards progresses. Mr. Elliott was very honest with us on the challenges he found and I imagine that the new board will have to challenge a pre-existing culture. I am not saying there is a black mark against existing cultures but one has to let in the light and certain people might not be favour of that.
9076	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	 Who is the current national secretary of Scouting Ireland?
9077	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	 If a disciplinary proceeding was issued under the signature of the national secretary in October, what is the status of that if the association is wound down?
9078	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	 On 1 October.
9079	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	 The policies have remained the same.
9080	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	 How?
9081	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	176	 To be straight about it, will Ms Kelly indicate what the status of a complaint is if a letter was issued on 1 October by an Accounting Officer, in Civil Service parlance, or a paid official, and if it involves disciplinary proceedings against an individual?
9082	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	178	 Of the association.

9084	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	 It is my intention to pursue, in so far as I can, while I have a mandate here, natural justice in respect of any complaints that are made. I have an obligation to certain people who have approached me to ensure-----

9119	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	105	 I will try to give the Minister a fair hearing and look at the issue in a cold and rational way. I understand from her response that a set of substantive recommendations, arising from the operational review, is being enacted but that she will not publish a report which underpins the recommendations. Is that assessment correct?
9120	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	107	" I wish to tease out the reasons for the Minister's decision. We have all received most of the freedom of information legislation material based on the work of Justine McCarthy of RTÉ. I also have correspondence dated 17 November 2017. The report was received in February 2017, almost a full two years ago. I am reluctant to name people, but there is correspondence from the chairperson of the board to a senior person in the Department which states the board's view remained that it was not legally safe to place the report in the public domain and that it could see no basis for deviating from the position or distinguishing between different types of publication. I understand some of the reason for the use of the phrase ""legally safe"" on the basis that, in giving it to certain stakeholders, it could be deemed to be legally published. However, I am confused and worried about the Minister's submission, in which she stated: When I was last here I advised the committee that the board of management of Oberstown had decided that it was not safe to publish the report on that review. This decision was based on a careful and lengthy process of deliberation, including the commissioning of independent legal advice. The board has its own independent legal advice, while the Minister has the advice of the Attorney General. Is there a conflict between the advice of the Attorney General and the board's legal advice on whether the Minister could or could not safely publish the report?"
9121	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	 Was the Minister minded to publish the report?
9122	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	 If the Attorney General's report states, on more than one occasion, that there was no impediment to publication of the report, it would be logical for the Minister to deem it safe to publish it. What are the risks? Was the advice received from the Attorney General clear on the publication of the report? Did the Attorney General hedge his position? I understand the Minister will not go into the detail of the content of the Attorney General's advice, but it would be helpful if we could be given the sense that it was the Minister's intention to publish the report. There is always a risk, but there does not appear to have been a prima facie case against the report's publication from the Government's point of view. Is there a statutory entitlement on the part of the board not to publish?
9123	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	113	 Frankly, I do not understand that. I am not a lawyer, but I look at it from the layman's perspective. Many stakeholders have had access to the report.
9124	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	115	 Did HIQA not have access to the report?
9125	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	117	 Did the Department of Justice and Equality have access to it?
9126	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	 Are HIQA and the Minister's Department the only two stakeholders that had access to the report?
9127	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	121	" What does the Minister mean by ""fair procedure""? Can she spell it out in very simple terms?"
9128	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	123	 That is the point. Individuals were named in the Goldson-Hardwick report. Are there specific named persons who it is believed are entitled to fair procedure? Is that the reason the report is not being published?
9129	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	125	 The Minister is saying the process of the report-----
9130	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	 I appreciate that.
9131	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	129	 I am keen to have the point clarified to ensure I understand it correctly. Is the Minister saying there was a flaw in the process? Perhaps I do not mean a flaw in the process but rather the question of whether the process was imperfect to the point of saying there was nothing built in to allow persons possibly named in the report to be afforded due process and an entitlement to their good name, to use the language of the law of tort.
9132	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	131	 To be helpful to the Minister, I will refer to correspondence received from senior officials. The relevant date is 13 November 2017. The correspondence states the Department is of the view that the following are mechanisms to progress matters to ensure the matters raised are addressed in respect of the board and principal people within it. The first mechanism is a response to the authors of the report pointing to the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management at Oberstown to ensure persons criticised in the report have been fairly heard. The alternative mechanism would involve a submission by the board and management of the Oberstown campus on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the Oireachtas joint committee, with the report. The officials sought to arrange a meeting between the relevant people and the Department to discuss the matter since the Minister was due to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on 22 November. As I recall, the issues did not arise at that meeting, but the Minister did anticipate that they would arise. They are arising now. On what we are strident - I think the Minister is seeing unity across the members of the committee in that regard - is the fact that I would not be doing my job if I left here with questions on my mind about the content of a report from eminent persons such as Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but is there some cover-up of practices at the Oberstown centre about which we need to hear in the public interest? Are people being protected unduly? The conflict I have in my mind is that I must always take steps to protect the good name of individuals and due process, but there is also the matter of the public interest. Notwithstanding the facts that the recommendations are being implemented, that HIQA is now in Oberstown and that there is a clear pathway in the improvements being made, we still have the sword of Damocles of the report hanging over our heads as an Oireachtas committee and I do not believe we will be satisfied until we receive clearer answers on its publication. I do not believe the public will be satisfied until it is published.
9133	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	133	 We need clear answers to certain questions. What is the level of risk inherent in the Attorney General's advice to the Minister? There was possibly more than one piece of advice. Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter. There may have been more than one engagement with the Attorney General's office. Frankly, I do not think the Attorney General said to the Minister of the day that it was the advice of the office not to publish the report.
9134	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	 I come at it from the point of view of being respectful of the Minister's position.
9135	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	 Have they responded since? I am asking the question specifically about whether the process of publication of the report-----
9136	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	139	 The persons named in the report. I am referring to the persons or entities and practices criticised in the report. Have they had a chance to respond?
9137	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	141	 Were they invited back?
9138	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	144	 Were they invited back? Was the process designed to accommodate it? That is why I am talking about the process.
9139	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	146	 Was the process designed in such a way that if findings were made against persons or the entity, there would be a right of reply?
9140	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	148	 They did not do that.
9141	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	151	 I think it is a little clearer now.
9142	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	203	 I am trying to reconcile in my own mind the interpretation of the Minister and the Department regarding the status of the report. If there is respect for due procedures, then there is an entitlement on the part of those who are the subject of the report to due process. Given that there was no further interaction between Professors Goldson and Hardwick, and notwithstanding the fact Oberstown is implementing the recommendations and HIQA is across that, does this mean this report is still, arguably, in the Minister's or the Department's interpretation, not a full but a draft report, and incomplete in that sense as per the terms of reference?
9143	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	205	 This is where the FOI data come into play. I refer to a document of 15 August 2017 in this regard. I have a full set of the documents through FOI. The source is RTÉ and this is in the public domain. There is a letter in the Department which states that there is confusion generally as to the status of the report and that, while the reviewers consider the report to be the final report, this was not necessarily the view of the Department or Oberstown.
9144	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	207	 If the Minister tells us there is a conflict between the reviewers in terms of an understanding of what the status of the report is, that will provide some clarity. However, notwithstanding the advices of the Attorney General in the context of risk, as I understand it, the Minister still has full discretion, based on those advices, as to whether she wishes to publish the report. I am only one Member of the Oireachtas. I note the Minister's earlier comments in respect of the mandate of this committee but we are all also Members of the Oireachtas and we speak to the public interest and can question anything at any time. Notwithstanding the mandate of this committee, it is my view that the Minister should publish and be damned, as they say, and put it all out there in the public domain.
9145	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	210	 I suggest we will be revisiting this.
9146	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	219	 To give the Minister some food for thought, I did not get into the statement that was issued by Professor Barry Goldson on 10 November, where he states very clearly in the public domain that he gave the board and the various stakeholders every opportunity to engage with him in respect of the issues before they went to publication. On the face of it, there seems to be a contradiction between the Minister and the Department's position and that of Goldson and Hardwick in this respect.
9147	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	224	 In terms of the procedures-----
9148	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	227	 I asked previously in terms of fair procedures whether the reviewers went back and my understanding of the Minister's response was that they did not go back.
9149	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	229	 They are saying in their statement that they offered every opportunity before coming to their final report for the individuals involved, or for Oberstown, to provide further details or clarification of points they had made.
9150	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	231	 It seems to me that perhaps the mechanisms or procedures operated by the reviewers were more robust than we had previously understood. The impression has been given here that they were less than robust. I would contend, based on that statement, that Goldson and Hardwick were more than comprehensive in respect of their interaction with Oberstown. This needs to be teased out further.
9151	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	233	 Is the Minister finished with the process following the Oberstown report? I apologise to the Chairman for taking up so much time on this.
9152	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	235	 It would appear, on the face of it, based on Goldson and Hardwick, that everybody in Oberstown was given the right to reply or was allowed due procedure. I am certainly of the impression, however, based on the Minister's interaction with us, that this is not her interpretation of events. That is where the question lies in my mind.
9153	SeanSherlock	Labour	16813.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	237	 That is the point made by Deputy Lisa Chambers.

9189	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	89	 I am delighted the witnesses are here today because this has given us much clarity and has probably answered some of the questions we had on the processes undertaken. The witnesses should know that neither our committee nor I have had access to or seen the report.
9190	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	91	 This committee is flying blind. We had a sense from the Minister's interaction with us prior to Christmas that the HIQA recommendations were being worked through. I certainly had the impression from that interaction with her that that was as a result of work that had flowed from the witnesses report. My questions are about the terms of reference. We have been given an impression that observations were made by the witnesses that were outside the terms of reference of the report. What are their views on that? I am quoting the Minister directly.
9191	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	93	 In response to a question from Deputy Rabbitte at the last committee meeting, the Minister stated: The report was written and conclusions, observations and recommendations were made. I answered Deputy Rabbitte's question about observations made that were outside the terms of reference and which went into policy issues. It was not provided for Oberstown House for people to review. People may have been named. People are named within the report. I ask Professor Hardwick to forgive me if he has answered this question already.
9192	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	95	 On that basis, do the witnesses see any impediment, in the public interest, to this report coming into full public view?
9193	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	97	" Again, I will quote from my own question to the Minister at our last committee meeting about this. I asked her ""Was the process designed in such a way that if findings were made against persons or the entity, there would be a right of reply?"" The Minister replied: Yes. They were asked to provide the report for the people concerned before there was a final report. That is what I am saying. From what I have heard so far, the witnesses are satisfied in their own minds that this actually took place and that they openly said that if anybody wanted to discuss the findings of the report, they would make themselves available to do so."
9194	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	99	 The Minister did say following that-----
9195	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	101	 The Minister said: The Oberstown centre envisaged that the visit would take place before the reviewers finalised the report - that was included in the terms of reference - in order that comments could be taken into account in the final version of the report. However, the reviewers maintain that it would not have been possible to provide feedback until the final report had been completed. Is that what the Deputy wants to have published? The reviewers consider it to be final. I acknowledge the witnesses are repeating themselves. What I am trying to reconcile is that while we have not had access to the report, we do have access to the recommendations and we know that HIQA has had access to the report and there is a process of working through it. Ultimately all of this is to ensure that Oberstown is fit for purpose and there are robust procedures, protocols and standard operating procedures. If there is still a sword of Damocles hanging over Oberstown in respect of this report, we are trying to tease out the fair procedure the Minister told us about in this committee. As she has not published the report, she must have received advices against publishing it. We are trying to reconcile that with the fact that to our minds, the public good is not being served by not publishing the report to date.
9196	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	103	 Does Professor Hardwick think the board of Oberstown has nothing to fear from the publication of the report?
9197	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	105	 I mean from a personal responsibility point of view.
9198	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	107	 And to embrace it. As a final question, I wish to ask about the methodology. Professors Hardwick and Goldson are both academics and most of us in this House are not, although we have interfaced with academics. Can the witnesses give us confidence that the methodology they used was in line with international best practice? I am not questioning their bona fides. There may be others who would come before this committee and question the methodology. I want to be sure in my mind that the methodology is robust.
9199	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	110	 I thank Professor Goldson.
9200	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	135	 Professor Goldson made a point about the Minister's interaction in respect of the legal advice. I will go back and quote directly what the Minister said: I have indicated in terms of the legal advice as well as the experience of the board, the staff and my officials, that fair procedures were not followed. Therefore there is a lack of fairness there, which leads to the legal risks, which is why there is not a publication. I do not in any way wish to put words in Professor Goldson's mouth but perhaps he can enlighten us. Does he agree with that statement?
9201	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	137	 Okay, so there is no reason from a legal standpoint for the report not to be published.
9202	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	141	 To be helpful, the legal advice to the Minister is from the Attorney General's office and we do not have access to that legal advice in this House. Therefore, one can assume the representatives of Oberstown do not have access to that legal advice either. It would be contrary to the law. On that basis, my understanding is that the Minister has discretion, on the basis of the advice, as to whether to publish. What we are hearing here, based on what has been an enlightening interaction with the delegates, is that there is now a clear need for the report to be published and put in the public domain so the questions that arise may be answered satisfactorily and so members of this committee can make some determination as to their interpretation of matters.
9203	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	159	 This is a political domain, not a legal one. To reiterate the points made previously, we do not have sight of the report. However, we do have sight of the recommendations and take in good faith the statements made in respect of the implementation of those recommendations. What we find hard to reconcile is the non-publication of the report. I listened very carefully to Professor Kilkelly in respect of the constitutional element in terms of implicating people in the report. I appreciate that dynamic because Professor Kilkelly states that while nobody was specifically identified, the language of the report could be deemed to identify individuals. In light of what Professor Kilkelly said, what was the exact nature of the independent advice given to the board?
9204	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	161	 What was the nature of the independent advice given to the board? Could she be more specific about it? What was the nature of the interactions with the Minister or her officials regarding that independent advice? When the Minister appeared before us, she stated that she had been advised by the board that its decision not to publish the report of the operational review was not one it either expected or wanted to make and that it resulted from a lengthy, careful and extensive process of consideration that weighed up the legal risks associated with publication in light of the independent legal advice. We are in the political domain and we perceive that the non-publication of the report could arguably be perceived to be covering up or protecting practice, culture or individuals. We need some reassurance from Professor Kilkelly that the board's independent legal advice is robust and some greater articulation of what Professor Kilkelly means by the implications of that advice.
9205	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	163	 Could I ask Professor Kilkelly to hold it there? In light of that very statement, was an opportunity given to those individuals, or were discussions held with them with a view to interacting with the two eminent experts in respect of the content and language of the report?
9206	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	165	 That is not what I asked.
9207	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	167	 There is a tendency sometimes in this House to go after people and witnesses. The dynamic of this committee has been such that it has been very patient on this issue. We seek to ensure witnesses' bona fides are respected. That is why we need very clear, succinct and simple language. My question was very simple. I want to know whether the individuals who might be implicated by virtue of the language of the report were given an opportunity to interact with the eminent professors in respect of the report's content or the implications of the language used in the report. Yes or no?
9208	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	169	" I believe Professor Kilkelly used the word ""property"" in respect of the report."
9209	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	171	 I am just quoting the professor and she may correct me if I am wrong. She said the report is the property of those who commissioned it. On that basis, who owns the report?
9210	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	173	 The board owns the report. If the board owns it, notwithstanding the issues of timing, the fact that the committee has demanded the publication of the report, and our interactions with the Minister, is there still scope and time, on the basis of the evidence of Professors Goldson and Hardwick in respect of their willingness to engage at all levels and with all stakeholders, to go over the report again and work through its content if it is deemed that there are adverse findings against or implications for certain individuals? From my perspective in seeking to address the issues concerning the recommendations published in July 2017, even if those recommendations are implemented, the sword of Damocles of this report will still be hanging over us. As I said at the outset, we are in the political domain, not the legal domain. Reports perceived to have been suppressed always get published, one way or another. I say respectfully to Professor Kilkelly that I perceive defensiveness here on the part of the board. I did not perceive the same defensiveness on the part of Professors Goldson and Hardwick. This is perception; it is reality in the political domain. Both sides need to go through this report again and find some common ground, irrespective of whether this process is brokered by the Minister or someone else. One way or another, the report will have to be published. The public interest absolutely demands it.
9211	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	175	 Is there not a contradiction there? Professor Kilkelly is saying findings have been reached. Has she not accepted the findings and content of the report on the basis that she is implementing its recommendations?
9212	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	177	 Arguably, then, the report is not a final report.
9213	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	264	 I have a question before Professor Kilkelly concludes.
9214	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	315	 I will reinforce the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. Correspondence was made available on 13 November 2017 as a result of a freedom of information request. The board had received legal advice on 13 March 2017. The correspondence is from a principal officer, who I will not name, in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It stated that the Department was of the view that the following are mechanisms to progress matters in order to ensure that the matters raised by the board were addressed. This is the independent legal advice. There follows a set of proposals. The first was a response to the authors of the report pointing out the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management of Oberstown in order to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard. Alternatively, the board of management of Oberstown campus could make a submission on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the joint Oireachtas committee along with the report. To reinforce Deputy Daly's point, members are very much of the view that everything was done to try to facilitate the board, either through further engagement with the authors of the report or through the legal mechanisms of the highest offices of the State, to publish the report, yet it refused to do so on the basis of its own independent legal advice. The arguments the witnesses are making do not hold water.

9216	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	328	 I placed on record the contents of the Department's correspondence with Professor Kilkelly. By any interpretation, the Department was seeking to suggest further engagement with the staff and management to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard. Notwithstanding the point that a finding had been made, which Professor Kilkelly made previously, there was still scope for further engagement with the various stakeholders before the publication of the report. Professor Kilkelly seems to be saying that in spite of those suggestions, the board decided to proceed on the basis of its independent legal advice. A pathway was being sought for the board but it refused to take it.
9217	SeanSherlock	Labour	16856.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-30 00:00:00	Oberstown Children Detention Campus Operational Review Report: Discussion	355	 Fair procedure has been the defence here. I believe that Professor Kilkelly's argument in respect of the findings militated against fair procedure. The Department made an offer to the board of Oberstown to discuss the issue of fair procedures. Professor Kilkelly is saying the board took up that offer. I do not understand her answer to that, because the evidence we heard from Professors Goldson and Hardwick today would suggest otherwise, namely, that there was no further qualitative engagement with them on the issue of fair procedures. It is very hard to find Professor Kilkelly's answer to be credible.

The motivation for asking them to appear was to gain an understanding of the dynamics within and between HIQA and Tusla. I am trying to understand the dynamic that exists in terms of the regulation of social workers. CORU is the regulatory body for registration and so on. However, I do not have an understanding of the dynamic that exists between HIQA and, for example, the social care or social work framework. HIQA may have, for example, 14 inspectors operating across the country. Its opening statement states: Tusla cannot rely on recurring staff shortages as the default reason for failing to deliver an efficient and safe service to children and their families. Nor can they use this as an excuse for not providing an environment where social workers and social care workers can enjoy doing the core job they are qualified to do. Is that statement based on a determination or examination of the dynamic that exists as between the client or service user and the social worker? Does that mean that HIQA's 14 inspectors speak to each social worker throughout the country in order to allow that adjudication to be made? How does HIQA determine the level or quality of contact time? How does it determine the level of bureaucracy and paperwork? Can it manage that time? Can it measure the time social workers spend in contact with their clients and the time they spend on paperwork? Does HIQA go down to that level of granularity?

The statutory investigation shone a light on the processes. The standard operating procedures and protocols were offered up to HIQA and it could determine from that how the overall organisation was operating.
9249	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	27	 Is adherence a systematic issue within Tusla?
9250	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	29	 HIQA interacts with the Department on that group. What is the current rate of progress on those issues?
9251	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	32	 The natural instinct of committee members is to empathise with social care workers and social workers. Our limited interaction with them through our constituency offices indicates that caseload is a significant factor for them. If there is a finite number of social workers and social care workers and the rate of attrition is high, one can reasonably extrapolate that the number of cases each worker must manage is increasing. I would contend that there are not enough hours in the day for them to deal with every case from a time management point of view. There must be some sympathy for the position in which they find themselves, notwithstanding the immediacy of the need of the child or family. Are social care workers and social workers now being put through the ringer? The statutory investigation was very challenging in terms of its conclusions and was instigated in the wider context of a tribunal. Are Tusla staff now subject to a higher level of bureaucracy that is challenging their ability to deliver for the people they serve and putting them under even more pressure?
9252	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	34	" To give some of the context, we all understand very well how HIQA operates. We know, for instance, what it does in tertiary hospitals in measuring bed spaces and processes within acute hospital settings. However, should it be so strident within social care settings in human contact between a social worker and the client and his or her family? As stated, I know that it is not possible to compromise in dealing with risk, but we need to give them a bit of a break and recognise that they find themselves under massive pressure. I do not think it is fair to state ""nor can [Tusla] use this as an excuse for not providing an environment where social workers and social care workers can enjoy doing the core job they are qualified to do."" Ms Dunnion can correct me if I am wrong, but social workers and social care workers might not be able to do the job they are qualified to do because they do not have the toolkit to do it and their caseload is getting heavier. Therefore, the risks also increase, which is not necessarily always the fault of the social worker. I am fearful that we could be putting the blame on the head of the social worker or the social care worker. That is my key point. I ask Ms Dunnion to dissuade me in holding that view."

I have one final question. I want to understand the dynamic in the relationship between HIQA and the institutes of higher education. HIQA has made specific recommendations on the need for more graduates, etc. Does it have a statutory role in determining that dynamic? Does it have influence in leaning on Tusla and the Department to be able to suggest that if certain courses of action are taken, certain programmes are created or there is engagement with a particular institution, more places could be created to meet the shortages? I understand HIQA can make recommendations, but is that all it can do? Does it have any power to follow through on them?

Some of us have questions to the Minister, who is in the Chamber so I will not delay. I thank the witnesses for coming. Tusla's statement is very clear in that it sets out pathways and challenges. I welcome this and acknowledge the recruitment and retention challenges Tusla faces. I also acknowledge the challenges it faces in respect of the HIQA reports and investigation and the outworkings of that. The expert assurance group, EAG, which was established to oversee and advise on the implementation of the recommendations of HIQA's investigation, has published its first quarterly report.

9272	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	92	 How much?
9273	SeanSherlock	Labour	16870.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-13 00:00:00	Recruitment and Retention of Social Workers: Health Information and Quality Authority	94	 Can Mr. Smyth supply us with general figures regarding this dynamic? If it is €31 million, it is a big chunk of change out of Tusla's annual budget. If 10% is going to recruitment agencies, that is an unmitigated scandal. I am not blaming the witnesses for that - that is the way the system is working - but there is something inherently wrong in that. My next question concerns fostering. Of the 1,453 social workers, how many are in fostering? There is a perception that people are moving more and more into fostering. Mr. Smyth may correct me if I am wrong in my perceptions, but child protection, for instance, is incredibly difficult work both psychologically and from the point of view of stress. I imagine that there may be a perception that fostering is a little easier. I am not saying it is not challenging - I am trying to understand the dynamic - but I imagine there is a high rate of attrition, not people leaving the service but moving into another service within the overall family. How many are moving across from child protection or other areas?

The witnesses may not have the answer now. I perceive that the role of a social worker in society today is potentially very much more complex than it might have been ten, 15 or 20 years ago. Is there a natural rate of burnout? Is there a period of years beyond which one should not work so as to guarantee the well-being of the individual social worker? Again, this is just perception. One would imagine that if one were working at the coalface of child protection for ten, 15 or 20 years, managing those stress levels would become harder and harder. Is there a period after which one should leave? I ask this because if the answer is in the affirmative, that has a bearing on the strategy for graduate recruitment and so on. I just wonder if Tusla is dealing with that dynamic. It is a complex question, to which a complex answer is probably required. If the witnesses cannot answer now, I understand, but it would be useful if they could revert to the committee to give us a sense of that dynamic.

9309	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 I nominate Deputy Neville.
9310	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 I find myself in a strange position. We are addressing an issue in respect of Mr. Rabbitte's chairing of Tusla. He is a former colleague so it feels very strange to be on this side of the table when he is on that side. I acknowledge Mr. Rabbitte's stellar public service. As he stated, he has spent much of his life in public service. On a personal level, I am of the view that he will bring a perspective that reflects that public service to his role as chairperson of Tusla. He will have a very strong understanding of the dynamics that drive the type of work we, as public representatives, so and the challenges we face in representing constituents whose families interface with organisations like the HSE and Tusla. He will have a very intimate knowledge of that and, because he has that perspective, it will very much drive the type of culture to which he refers. I welcome Mr. Rabbitte's opening statement. I sense from it that there is a need for Tusla to be very open in terms of how it operates and also in recognising the challenges that it faces as an organisation. I wish Mr. Rabbitte well in the role. Today is perhaps just a starting point in deepening the relationship between Tusla as an organisation and this committee. Mr. Rabbitte made reference to the challenges he faces, particularly in respect of the shortage of social workers, which has a massive bearing on the interaction between the family unit and the State in terms of the societal issues that exist. I want to delve a bit deeper into the issue of recruitment. We had a very positive interaction with Tusla in respect of the challenges it faces and the interactions it is having with academia in the context of trying to recruit social workers in a very competitive space where, arguably, the issues that exist mean that it is competing on a global level for talent. I wonder if there needs to be a stronger political input at Government level and on a cross-departmental basis between the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills, for example, in the context of ownership of this as a policy issue. I would like to hear Mr. Rabbitte's perspective on that, although I am conscious that he cannot stray too much into the political space. We know there is a shortage of social workers and what the consequences of that shortage are. We know people are doing their best within the organisation to manage their caseloads. We also know that those caseloads are increasing exponentially, with a consequent rate of attrition among social workers. If we can crack that nut collectively as between the Oireachtas, the Minister and Tusla, we will be doing a good day's work in respect of the operation of Tusla. My only intervention today is to see if we can get a greater perspective, even at this early stage, in respect of what the Oireachtas needs to do or focus on in respect of the recruitment issues and what Government could be doing in respect of facing those challenges.

I do not expect a substantive answer at this stage. I want to put on record the fact that this committee had been dealing with matters in Scouting Ireland and that a helpline has now been set up. More than 200 cases, and possibly well in excess of that number, have been reported in The Irish Times. If we are talking about the relationship between the Oireachtas and Tusla, my concern is that there should be some understanding of the dynamic between Tusla and Scouting Ireland in respect of the handling of those cases. If the number of cases has gone north of 200 - and there is a Scouting Ireland helpline in respect of that issue - I would like to return to the issue at some point in the future, perhaps when the chief executive has been appointed, in order to inform ourselves of the dynamic that exists with regard to the handling of those cases. I do not even expect a response to that point at this juncture. I just wished to put it on the record.

The meeting of the committee is adjourned until Wednesday, 13 March at 10 a.m., when the committee will meet with the Irish Foster Care Association and the Irish Association of Social Workers to discuss the recruitment and retention of social workers. Members are reminded that the select committee will meet on Wednesday, 6 March at 4.30 p.m. to discuss the Revised Estimates for 2019 in respect of Vote 40 - Children and Youth Affairs with the Minister.
9319	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	 I will start with the helpline, as we are on that theme and to follow-on from Deputy Mitchell. There seems to be, if I am interpreting it correctly, common ground emerging between Scouting Ireland and Tusla in respect of the helpline. Will Mr. Gibson help me to understand what the independent review will mean in real terms? If they go to an academic institution, what will it be tasked with doing? Will it examine every case and does it have the statutory authority to be able to examine every case? Is it a logging and documenting exercise? What is the nature of the independent review? If there are clear statutory obligations in respect of the historical cases - I make the distinction between the historical and contemporary - I still do not understand from what Mr. Gibson stated how that process will be managed. If Mr. Gibson can enlighten me on that in the first instance, I would be grateful.
9320	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	 On that, Scouting Ireland will tell us that it has a team of professional staff who have listened and engaged and it would have notified Tusla to that effect. Personally, as one member of the committee, I take in good faith that a process is under way in respect of the historical cases, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Elliott, who has a strong track record on this, is also involved in that process and has good form in respect of Cloyne and other issues. I take that in good faith and I am satisfied with that. I refer to the 18 February letter from Tusla to Scouting Ireland. The explosive line in that letter relates to the overnights. Did Tusla have any sense of the hurt and shock that it would cause when that letter went into the public domain in respect of the thousands of volunteers and parents who have gone through Garda vetting and child protection training and would see themselves as being protective and compliant in every way? Did Tusla have any sense of the sheer hurt and the magnitude of that statement, as well as of the potential effect of closing down an organisation in one fell swoop? One of the main modus operandi of scouting is that children experience overnight camping. The letter was devastating to the thousands of innocent and decent people who give hours of their time to Scouting Ireland, who are dedicated to this lifestyle, and do so for the common good and the purpose of bringing benefit to society. Does Tusla feel any regret for including that in its letter of 18 February?
9321	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	52	 With respect, the letter came into the public domain via the Minister herself on foot of a Topical Issue matter which Deputy Rabbitte and I put down. I will not go into the modalities of that now. The fact is that the letter is in the public domain and was put there by the Minister herself. Notwithstanding the child safeguarding statement and the Safety First legislation, Tusla is stating there is a job of work to be done in respect of compliance with the safety statement. That is the role of the professional staff in Scouting Ireland. I want to make a distinction between the role of the professional staff regarding their obligations. It is mapped on to the letter Tusla sent. In three – certainly two - of the cases, a professional person in Scouting Ireland made an intervention that could be deemed to be inappropriate in respect of whether it was compliant with the child safeguarding statement. We need to make the distinction between that and those episodes. One could argue that when those incidents occurred, that the volunteers who were on the ground came in straight away and notified the relevant person in charge of safeguarding. It was thereafter that there might have been a failure of process. It is important to make the distinction that the volunteers on the ground, who go through the child protection training and receive their instructions from the professional staff as to their obligations, are without blemish in this instance. I want an understanding of that dynamic from Tusla. If it acknowledges this distinction today, that will go some way towards assuaging the thousands of people who perceive that Tusla came down heavily on volunteers. One has to accept there is always risk but, in the main, the bulk of volunteers across the country are compliant and au fait with their obligations as parents and volunteers.
9322	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	 It is not subtle. It is obvious.
9323	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	56	 The bottom line is that, as a layperson, I interpreted the letter from 18 February as stating there were to be certain actions to be carried out by the person in charge of safeguarding within the organisation. It is clear from the letter that certain matters were not dealt with. Again, that is at the professional staff level. I reiterate there is a difference between that level of engagement and a parent's or a volunteer's level of engagement on the ground on a typical weekend. As a parent, I would have no hesitation in sending a child off to a camp with Scouting Ireland. I am happy and satisfied that the volunteers are compliant with their obligations. The committee needs to be satisfied that the process under way with Scouting Ireland is actually addressing the issues of the letter of 18 February, that there is a cascade effect regarding Children First and that Tusla is satisfied that a process is under way which will give confidence to everybody, particularly those outside of Scouting Ireland who are not necessarily au fait with policies, procedures, practices or the culture which exists within the scouting family. It is the public which needs to have confidence on this matter.
9324	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	58	 When is Tusla meeting Scouting Ireland next?
9325	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	 I am sorry to interrupt but I must ask Mr. Gibson to repeat what he has just said as I could not hear him.
9326	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	160	 Chairman-----
9327	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	162	 I am helping the Chairman. It is on his point.
9328	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	164	 The Chairman has raised a pertinent issue. To follow on from what he said about Scouting Ireland's update on its action plan, it acknowledged issues related to structural policy monitoring and what else?
9329	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	 Scouting Ireland is acknowledging they are on hold. I deduce from that that they are being actively worked on.
9330	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	203	 On point 4 of that, relating to historical cases and the agreed action plan, if there is some articulation back to us about how the historical cases are being dealt with, that would be very helpful. My last question relates to the interaction between Tusla and the Department. Tusla issued a letter on 18 February which clearly outlined specific issues about the adherence to Children First, the legislation, and so on. On 21 February, the Minister announced through The Irish Times that State funding for child protection improvements would be increased and that €220,000 was received by Scouting Ireland. I am trying to reconcile the concerns of Tusla as of 18 February, addressed in the witnesses' letter, and the vote of confidence of the Minister about safeguarding procedures. It seems to be incongruous that the Minister or her spokesperson said it was on the right path. Was there a line of communication between Tusla and the Minister's Department, officials or office about concerns that Tusla had on safeguarding issues?
9331	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	205	 Had Deputy Rabbitte and I not raised this as a Topical Issue matter and if Mr. Elliott had not put the correspondence from Tusla in front of the Minister, which she then put on the public record, we would not be sitting here today.
9332	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	207	 The Minister would have been none the wiser and would have continued in good faith to restore the funding and make funding available.
9333	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	210	 Specific funding, some €220,000, was made available for safeguarding and that is the question here. We are trying to understand this. I speak as a former Minister. Protocols relating to letters of this nature, that relate to a public issue which affects thousands of people, are a key component of Tusla's statutory work. Tusla is a statutory agency with the power of legislation behind it. We have to acknowledge that one would have thought there would be a clear line of communication to the Minister's officials, if not directly to the Minister's office, for a response to the granting of an extra €220,000 for safeguarding, which was reported on 21 February, when clear concerns were raised by Tusla on 18 February.
9334	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	247	 Is it Mr. Elliott?
9335	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	312	 There is much to try to internalise and understand from the contributions. My earlier intervention was based on the idea that there needs to be progress while we are all moving forward, which means the State agencies, the statutory bodies, Scouting Ireland, as a voluntary organisation, and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are all on a journey to ensure that an organisation that is cherished within Irish society emerges stronger as a result of what has happened. While we are on that journey, there remain questions to be teased out. If we have concerns, no matter how seemingly ill founded they might be, they are nonetheless concerns. It is important that we reserve the right to ask questions, and so doing should not be taken as having a particular view on an organisation or individuals within it. As Deputy Rabbitte noted, she and I raised the Topical Issue matter but if we had not, we would arguably not be having this discussion. The motive for raising the matter was predicated on the concerns we had that information was entering the public domain via The Irish Times and we read the information but there was no mechanism where the Minister would report to us in the committee or to the Oireachtas in respect of the process. We merely wanted to establish the facts of the process for the historical cases. I understand the point Mr. Elliott made about historical cases but given that the numbers were in the public domain, we felt that it was necessary to interrogate the process. It was at that juncture that the Minister put the Tusla letter on the record of the House. That leads me to my first question. The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has stated on the record that the letter of 18 February was not copied or issued to any person outside of Scouting Ireland or Tusla. On Wednesday, 27 February 2019, Tusla received a request from the Department to provide a copy of the letter dated 18 February 2019. The Department had received direct communication from Scouting Ireland's interim safeguarding manager, Mr. Ian Elliott, on Tuesday, 26 February 2019 in connection with Tusla's letter. That letter was provided to the Department, and the Minister read its recommendations into the Dáil record and later published the letter on the Department's website. Will Mr. Elliott confirm his version of events vis-à-vis Tusla's interpretation of events? The letter exists - that is a statement of fact - and it was sent to Tusla. How did the letter then return to the Department? Did Mr. Elliot furnish that letter to the Department?
9336	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	314	 By whom?
9337	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	316	 From the Department.
9338	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	318	 Mr. Elliott did not send a copy of the letter.
9339	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	320	 It is important to make the distinction that Scouting Ireland emailed the Department-----
9340	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	322	 -----but the letter was sought by the Department and Scouting Ireland did not furnish it with same.
9341	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	324	 Did the two officials which Mr. Elliott named say why they wanted the letter?
9342	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	326	 The email was sent on 26 February, which coincides with the raising of the Topical Issue matter in the Dáil.
9343	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	328	 I am conscious of time.
9344	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	330	 Mr. Elliott has proof through the correspondence, a log of the call and so on that it was the departmental officials who contacted Scouting Ireland. They wanted a copy of the letter. Did they say why?
9345	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	332	 How did they know that the letter existed?
9346	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	334	 Without furnishing them with the letter.
9347	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	336	 A question mark now hangs over this process. We may need to contact the Department and the Minister about this issue, given that she has now arguably been put into this process. She stood before the Dáil and said clearly that she was in receipt of the letter. I do not have the transcript before me, but she certainly said that she had received the letter. Tusla says that it-----
9348	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	338	 She had received the letter only a matter of hours before. I will park that for the time being, as it is pertinent to the issue and there is now a question mark over the nature of the Minister or her Department's involvement in this process. The interagency meeting was held on 25 February.
9349	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	340	 What transpired at that meeting?
9350	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	342	 Regarding the timeline, 18 February was the date of the letter and 25 February was the date of the interagency meeting.
9351	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	344	 Was the 18 February letter discussed at that 25 February meeting? Mr. Elliott did not receive it until 22 February, but the letter was dated 18 February.
9352	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	346	 Were the issues contained in the letter addressed at the interagency meeting on 25 February?
9353	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	348	 Mr. Elliott felt that, in line with his obligations vis-à-vis his interaction with Tusla and given the confidentiality of these matters, there should have been a clear-----
9354	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	350	 The Minister came into the House on 27 February, put the letter of 18 February into the public domain and the bombshell was dropped in respect of the weekends and overnights, but that issue had been addressed prior to 27 February in the interagency meeting.
9355	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	352	 What was the nature of the discussions with the Garda?
9356	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	354	 Mr. Elliott got that assurance from the Garda.
9357	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	356	 Will Mr. Elliot explain that? No case record has been examined.
9358	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	358	 No staff member has been interviewed.
9359	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	360	" This has opened up a whole new can of worms. Tusla appeared before us earlier and gave a version of events, and we now have Scouting Ireland's interpretation of events. It throws up a set of new questions. I wish to discuss the letter of 18 February again. Arising from the evidence we have just heard, there are questions to be asked of the departmental officials and the Minister in respect of this matter. Regarding the helpline, I will ask Mr. Elliott to put himself in the politician's position for a second. The Minister appeared before the House and put the key points of the Tusla letter on the record. When an Oireachtas Member hears the words, ""Scouting Ireland should consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips"", the natural and immediate reaction is to wonder whether something explosive that we did not know about had happened and to take the Minister in good faith. Having parsed this situation out a little further and consulted people on the ground regarding their obligations in respect of safeguarding, and given that overnight camps took place at the weekend, there is public confidence in matters at ground level. Notwithstanding all of that, legitimate issues were raised in the letter of 18 February regarding the three cases at hand. They should not be glossed over, and I am not saying anyone has. It is not that the incidents did not take place. There was arguably a response at the time by the designated liaison officers. One could safely conclude that. If there was not, the cases would not have been highlighted in the way they have been. I am not happy at the manner in which professional staff responded. For me, the issue is the manner in which Scouting Ireland responds to matters. I make no apology in that regard. In two of the cases Tusla highlights that the intervention and interrogation of children were inappropriate. That is where the failing was. We all appreciate and understand risk is inherent in any voluntary organisation, but in this instance the manner in which the eight professional staff responded was inappropriate. That is the issue for Tusla. It was mentioned that it had been raised at the inter-agency meeting on 25 February. What was the response of Tusla to Scouting Ireland in raising it, or did it raise in the manner I have just articulated it?"
9360	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	362	 In the three cases.
9361	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	364	 We have the sample cases to go on.
9362	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	367	 I would like to ask one more question because new information has come to light that is explosive.
9363	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	369	 I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue again. What is so injurious in the letter from Tusla in respect of the helpline that Scouting Ireland is seeking to refute it? The letter states further concerns arise about the management of a recent situation and that confidential information was shared with a Children First information and advice officer, CFIAO, etc. My impression from earlier interventions by Mr. Elliott is that it is injurious to Scouting Ireland.
9364	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	371	 We are all trying to understand the issue. I am not a child protection expert, but Mr. Elliott is saying that, in respect of case A and case B, Tusla's interpretation of the course of events is incorrect? In other words, there are question marks over Tusla's interpretation of events in regard to the interventions made by eight professional safeguarding officers for Scouting Ireland.
9365	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	373	 What does that mean?
9366	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	378	 Mr. Tennant read his interpretation of the barrister's report, about which I have a number of questions, but we do not have time to deal with them today. We need a further iteration in that regard.
9367	SeanSherlock	Labour	16898.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	 As it is almost 3 p.m., this is almost our fifth hour of meetings and I am very conscious the members of Scouting Ireland who are before us as witnesses and in the Visitors Gallery have been here since we started at 10 a.m. I thank all of them for their participation, as I thank the members for their diligence and attendance this morning and this afternoon. There are a great many positive aspects to be highlighted in any such environment, particularly this one, as to the efforts of Scouting Ireland. In the context of why we are here, it is even more important that we get to grips with some of the detail. To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response. As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways. For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response. It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla. However, personally speaking, I am very pleased to hear it reiterated over and over that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla and is working with it. That provides the opportunity to restore the trust that, in fairness, and I am not alone in saying this, Scouting Ireland has been working steadfastly to rebuild following the announcement in January or February of 2018 that there were historical case files that were throwing up difficulties for the movement in this country. From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in. I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago. On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance, participation and responses and, indeed, for their volunteer spirit in everything they do. The committee will adjourn until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 2019, when it will meet representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and the Irish Association of Social Workers to continue its consideration of the topic of recruitment and retention of social workers.

There are a great many positive aspects to be highlighted in any such environment, particularly this one, as to the efforts of Scouting Ireland. In the context of why we are here, it is even more important that we get to grips with some of the detail. To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response. As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways. For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response. It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla. However, personally speaking, I am very pleased to hear it reiterated over and over that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla and is working with it. That provides the opportunity to restore the trust that, in fairness, and I am not alone in saying this, Scouting Ireland has been working steadfastly to rebuild following the announcement in January or February of 2018 that there were historical case files that were throwing up difficulties for the movement in this country. From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in. I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago.

From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in. I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago. On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance, participation and responses and, indeed, for their volunteer spirit in everything they do. The committee will adjourn until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 2019, when it will meet representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and the Irish Association of Social Workers to continue its consideration of the topic of recruitment and retention of social workers.

As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways.

There are a great many positive aspects to be highlighted in any such environment, particularly this one, as to the efforts of Scouting Ireland. In the context of why we are here, it is even more important that we get to grips with some of the detail. To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response. As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways. For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response. It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla. However, personally speaking, I am very pleased to hear it reiterated over and over that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla and is working with it. That provides the opportunity to restore the trust that, in fairness, and I am not alone in saying this, Scouting Ireland has been working steadfastly to rebuild following the announcement in January or February of 2018 that there were historical case files that were throwing up difficulties for the movement in this country. From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in. I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago.

I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago. On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance, participation and responses and, indeed, for their volunteer spirit in everything they do. The committee will adjourn until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 2019, when it will meet representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and the Irish Association of Social Workers to continue its consideration of the topic of recruitment and retention of social workers.

To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response. As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways. For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response. It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla.

There are a great many positive aspects to be highlighted in any such environment, particularly this one, as to the efforts of Scouting Ireland. In the context of why we are here, it is even more important that we get to grips with some of the detail. To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response. As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways. For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response. It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla. However, personally speaking, I am very pleased to hear it reiterated over and over that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla and is working with it. That provides the opportunity to restore the trust that, in fairness, and I am not alone in saying this, Scouting Ireland has been working steadfastly to rebuild following the announcement in January or February of 2018 that there were historical case files that were throwing up difficulties for the movement in this country. From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in. I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information. As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find. We need to look at that. I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain. If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately? I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred. I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago. On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance, participation and responses and, indeed, for their volunteer spirit in everything they do. The committee will adjourn until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 2019, when it will meet representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and the Irish Association of Social Workers to continue its consideration of the topic of recruitment and retention of social workers.

9415	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 I thank the witnesses for being here today. This meeting is certainly assisting us in understanding the dynamic between the IFCA, the people it represents, and officialdom. How would the witnesses characterise the IFCA's relationship with Tusla? Is it a positive relationship? Does the IFCA leadership feel it is being listened to and its recommendations are bearing some fruit?
9416	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 The witnesses noted that foster carers do not have a link social worker. That suggests to me that there is a big gap. The foster carer and the child have the right to a social worker. Could the risk increase dramatically if the relationship between the carer and the child deteriorates in any way? If we do not have an accurate figure for how many of the 5,000 children in foster care arrangements are without a link social worker, there is a possible or potential risk of some of those relationships being in a state of disrepair. We might not know that.
9417	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 The theme here is recruitment and retention. We are trying to plug that gap, so to speak. If there is no link social worker for a particular family and issues arise for the foster carer or the child, the risk is offset by a mechanism allowing the foster carer to contact the IFCA via the helpline. Does recourse exist for a child where he or she is at risk? We assume the relationship is benign and positive and we concur with Ms Bond about the good work done by people who care for children in a fostering arrangement. We have to have regard, however, to the fact that if there is a shortage of social workers, the risk profile increases and child protection issues become even more prevalent. If there are 5,000 children in foster care arrangements, and like the witnesses we do not have exact figures, there is a major gap in the service and the risk to children is potentially increased. That is my impression. Perhaps the witnesses can disavow me of that or help me to understand further.
9418	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	 If I understand Mr. Murphy correctly, some foster carers do not have a link social worker and as such they do not have access to supports as required. If I interpret that correctly, he is saying there are gaps. Does the IFCA have a numerical analysis of the gaps? How many children are without a link social worker at present?
9419	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 There is nobody in the system who is literally cast adrift.
9420	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	 This discussion is all about developing our understanding of the dynamic. Who exactly is on the foster care committee?
9421	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	 I refer again to recruitment and retention. The former Deputy Pat Rabbitte is now chair of Tusla. He came before the committee some weeks ago and the recruitment and retention of social workers was a key area that he wanted to discuss. In parallel with the IFCA, he also raised bridging education that would upskill social care staff. If people have identified this as an issue that has been ongoing for many years, why has the system not bridged that gap? Why is it that instead of going back into full-time education, social care staff cannot do a bridging or postgraduate course that would see them suitably qualified? What is the IFCA's perception of the gaps there? Why has that not happened?
9422	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	 It was suggested that bursaries could be provided by Tusla.
9423	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 Demand for foster care places is increasing. The figures are approximately 6,000 in care and 5,000 in foster care. How do we encourage people to become foster carers or foster parents, to use that expression? Where is the gap and why are more people not taking up that challenge?
9424	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	 Would Ms Bond characterise the challenges that foster carers face at the moment as being extremely difficult in the main? The perception I have is that for foster carers, the placement can be quite difficult if they do not have supports. Presumably foster carers are constantly fighting with the HSE and Tusla for additional services.
9425	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	 I sincerely thank the witnesses for being here today. Five minutes do not do justice to the wider submission IFCA supplied to the committee and I sincerely thank them for articulating a way forward for us, as a committee, to deal with the issues of recruitment and retention. I also thank Ms McGuirk for defending her colleagues because we live in times where it is easy to beat up on the social worker and he or she, in a judicial or societal setting, can be seen as the easy target for public opprobrium. While there have been cases in the recent past and historically, relating to the quality of engagement with social workers, that was the exception and not the norm. I have an appreciation on the basis of the submission and our deliberations on this issue of recruitment and retention generally, that it is the hidden work, which is undocumented, defines the quality of the engagement. One cannot put a HIQA, stamp on or tick a box for the relationship building, which is vital to sustain the very system that we have. Again, I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today and for their important submission because we now have something on which we can roll up our sleeves. I would like to be educated on the day-to-day role of a social worker. My first question is on child protection and the welfare of children. We have had a very good interaction on foster care but I want to better understand how a case is triaged when it comes in the front door of Tusla or any other agency. How does a child protection case land on the desk of a social worker? We have a good interaction on foster care but I would like to discuss child protection. How does a social worker, typically, secure a care order? Where is the social worker in the pecking order in respect of the legal framework to secure a care order? Let us say a social worker must go to court. What does a typical social worker have to do from the time a case lands on the desk front-of-house to securing a care order? How much paperwork is involved? Once the care order is successfully applied for, what is the ratio of contact time to administrative time? Is it 50:50 or 80:20? Does a social worker now have to do much more administrative work with much less contact time? Is that, within the existing cohort of social workers, having a bearing on outcomes for the relationship between the social worker and the child? Has that contributed to a malaise or a set of circumstances whereby a social worker, after a couple of years, faces burnout and decides to leave his or her post citing an inability to deal with the work any more? How can the nature of the relationship be changed in such a way that there is a larger quotient of social workers, a manageable workload and family-friendly hours? Social work is a female dominated profession. Women, in particular, will inevitably have families. What arrangements are put in place for a female social worker who wants to continue in her profession yet wants the requisite time off and work within hours that meet the needs of her own family while allowing her to continue professionally, progress careerwise and so on? I have offloaded a load of issues. I have a picture in my own mind about social work but the witnesses will present a picture that will help us to deal with the key issues of recruitment and retention. I ask them to paint a picture for us of some of the points that I have outlined it will prove very useful.

9427	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	 I appreciate the point that Mr. McCarthy is making, but to assist us and notwithstanding the fact that I made a lot of points to him earlier, where for instance a case comes in, is triaged and goes on for further assessments, if the case goes to court and a care order is required, I have a number of questions arising from that. I will be as brief as possible, allowing for the amount of time I have available, and forgive me if I took a lot of time at the start. What is the status of the social worker in the court setting? What is the contact time versus the administrative time? I would like to have an understanding of those two dynamics from our committee's interaction today with the Irish Association of Social Workers. The new chair of Tusla spoke about bridging courses to get people from social care to social work. What are the views of the association on that suggestion? How are academia and Tusla dealing with this idea? Everybody has acknowledged and knows the problem of recruitment. Should we be putting better therapeutic solutions and counselling in place for social workers themselves who work in child protection settings? Should we be designing family friendly policies for social workers? All of these thematic areas could contribute to a better outcome for social workers themselves and, ultimately and most importantly, for children and families.
9428	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	128	 Okay.
9429	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	130	 Is the social worker, however, subject to cross-examination?
9430	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	132	 There is massive element of stress involved in that.
9431	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	 However, they are represented by a solicitor.
9432	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	 My understanding is developing now. If the social worker goes into court he or she is represented in an adversarial system. Presumably, the social worker historically would have made the assessment and made a recommendation that the child should go into whatever setting is the most appropriate. Historically, that would have been accepted by the judge of the day. I am assuming this and Mr. McCarthy can correct me if I am wrong. We now have a system where there is a guardian ad litem and a social worker. Presumably the guardian ad litem has legal representation, the social worker has legal representation, the child is represented by the guardian ad litem and then there is the respondent. There could be five or six lawyers and probably a layer of experts on top of that again. There could be a psychologist or psychiatrist in the court. Is Mr. McCarthy saying that the psychologist or psychiatrist - he can tell us which is the appropriate profession - is then tasked with doing the assessment of the need or of the parent before a judgment is made?

9457	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	51	 Tusla would prosecute in the event that a service is unregulated.
9458	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	151	 I welcome the witnesses before us today. I want to start by saying that I have much sympathy for the predicament that parents find themselves in at present, particularly those parents whose children are attending some of these facilities as we speak and who are absolutely and utterly conflicted about sending their children to these facilities but have no other choice other than to go back to these facilities because they have no alternative arrangements. Such parents seek clarity from us as to whether the interactions we are having today will provide some degree of confidence to those parents. As a parent, if my child were in any of those facilities and I had no choice but to send my child there, I would be racked with guilt, feeling ambivalent about what I should be doing and I know for a fact that some of the children have been withdrawn from such facilities because I have been talking to some of the parents of those children. I am not sure I have heard anything today that would give me crumbs of confidence or give those parents grounds for confidence. I wanted to make that point at the very start. Correct me if I am wrong, but everything I have heard today points back to Tusla saying it is reverting to Children First guidelines. Earlier, the acting chief executive stated: It is important to state in the clearest terms possible, however, that Tusla’s early years inspectorate had no evidence of the serious child protection concerns or the high degree of serious non-compliance with standards that was shown in the RTÉ programme. Indeed, the behaviours displayed are unlikely ever to be evident during an inspection and we rely on good governance practice and appropriate mandatory reporting under Children First or through Tusla’s unsolicited information office for the notification of child protection concerns. To parse the language, Mr. Smyth was saying that if people do not report child protection concerns to Tusla within the facilities themselves, as childcare workers, Tusla has no way of knowing what is going on. Is that correct?
9459	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	153	 I want straight answers from Mr. Smyth, please.
9460	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	 I appreciate that and we have been through that.
9461	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	157	 I appreciate all of that.
9462	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	159	" My time is limited. I do not want to be ambiguous, I want clear answers. Mr. Smyth is saying that if the Children First and mandatory reporting guidelines are not being adhered to by the staff on the ground in the facility, if they are not compliant, then Tusla has no way of knowing what is going on outside of the inspections that it carries out. Is that correct? Please answer ""Yes"" or ""No""."
9463	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	161	 That is what we are talking about.
9464	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	163	 On that basis, it is reasonable to objectively say that the regulatory regime is not working comprehensively in a way that ensures that a parent can have absolute confidence that the misbehaviour, putting it mildly, that we saw in that programme is dealt with. There is absolutely no guarantee for any parent, across the country, that the regulatory and inspectorate regime can move across or cover those types of eventualities. I am making a point. I again go back to Mr. Smyth's submission. Hyde and Seek has been on the radar of Tusla for quite some time and Mr. Smyth has clearly articulated that to us today. Did he ever look at the culture that existed within Hyde and Seek? Was he ever concerned about the management structure of Hyde and Seek such that it might be difficult for an individual childcare worker, if he or she had concerns, to find a mechanism to air those concerns in a way that would ensure that they would be protected, short of making a protected disclosure or going to Tusla's-----
9465	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	165	 -----unsolicited information office? My fear is for junior staff who might be afraid, if a particular regime existed, to make known their concerns because of the potential repercussions that might be visited upon them if they made a complaint. It happens across business and in the public and private sectors. Is there a flaw in the inspectorate regime if it does not pick up on those type of conflicts when talking to staff during inspections?
9466	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	 When?
9467	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	 Was that through the prism of RTÉ?
9468	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	 When?
9469	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	 The timelines here are very important, Chairman.
9470	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	176	 What does Tusla say to parents-----
9471	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	179	 Nobody is suggesting that the vast bulk of facilities are beyond reproach. Let us nail that to the mast. That is self-evident because we have relationships in our constituencies with childcare facilities and they are excellent. I have a lot of sympathy for what I would call junior staff, as opposed to management staff, who are working under duress in some instances in these facilities. However, there is a systemic failure somewhere because if there was not, we would not be sitting here today and we would not have witnessed the scenes we witnessed on the RTÉ programme. What I am trying to do is nail down where the obligations lie. There are obligations regarding mandatory reporting and there seems to have been a failure somewhere in that respect and we need to address that failure. Similarly, parents listening to this discussion will hear some sympathetic language about improving the quality of the conversation with parents and involving them more in respect of policy and so on. However, if a parent who sent his or her child to one of these creches today had an inkling that something was going on, he or she will not go to the Tusla website or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website to check the criteria. They would not necessarily act on their instinct because they have trust that the regulatory regime is robust enough to ensure their child is protected. That is a failure in the system. As mentioned by other speakers, we need to get to a point now, arising from this episode, where parents are given power on a statutory basis to be part of a communications set-up, so to speak, with whatever facility their child happens to be in or attending in a way that ensures there is proper communication with them because they are being left out of the loop. I repeat that parents are racked with guilt. I am a parent. I was racked with guilt watching that programme. One could not but be racked with guilt. Parents already feel guilty sending their children to childcare daily, given the society we live in where the two parents have to work. We will have an opportunity to address and engage with the academics about whom Ms McNally spoke because it is our intention to have a second committee hearing, for which I thank the Chairman, to which those academics will be invited because it is important that we kick the tyres, so to speak, in respect of what the witnesses are telling us and have a robust discussion. We will need to hear from parents also in respect of what we are hearing today. I want to drill down into the programme. Obviously, the people working undercover made representations, disclosures or notified Tusla. I am concerned that too much time elapsed between the notification by those undercover workers and the lack of communication with parents such that some parents were not notified other than via RTÉ. Nobody is blaming RTÉ. It has done a public service on this issue. However, the parents want to know why Tusla did not phone them to notify them this was going on and if they could be given a guarantee that their child will be safe in the intervening period. That is the bottom line.
9472	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	181	 Mr. Lee said that already. Let me be clear. When an-----
9473	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	 What I want clarified is when the undercover reporters-workers notified Tusla of their concerns, aside from RTÉ, as a corporate body, writing to Tusla.
9474	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	189	 In the period from April to July there were children in a facility who could have been subjected to the behaviours we have witnessed and who could have been at risk.
9475	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	 I am treading very carefully. There is the law and there are the regulations but then there is right and wrong. From the point of view of what is right and wrong, no matter what the law states, if one is in receipt of information in April, one should not take the bureaucratic path.
9476	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	196	 I have two final points.
9477	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	198	 I would like to take the same amount of time as the Chairman took.
9478	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	200	 We need to create a culture in which there is adequate parental representation, because parents need to have a voice in all of this. Access for parents via CCTV or apps has to be looked at. Is there a requirement on the manager and owner of a crèche or child care facility, who also works in the crèche, to have all the necessary qualifications?
9479	SeanSherlock	Labour	17038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	202	 I also put a question on management.

9507	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	78	 I thank the representatives for coming before the committee. I do not doubt but that they seek to make a genuine effort to tackle these sensitive issues. A common theme which is emerging here is that of resources. I acknowledge the role played by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in seeking to progress matters, particularly in mental health, and the challenges she faced in trying to get a greater slice of the health budget assigned to mental health. I understand the constraints. I will speak specifically on Cork. How many inpatient beds are there in Cork at present?
9508	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	80	 That will be the operational number. How many are there now?
9509	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	82	 Are they at capacity every night of the week?
9510	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	84	 I know.
9511	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	86	 My motivation in asking is, whether or not there is full occupancy, in an effort to understand the culture that exists within the acute inpatient facilities. I am trying to have some degree of knowledge about the decision-making process whereby a person finds himself or herself in one of the these units. Due to the culture or decision making process, there are situations from time to time when some of those beds are left vacant for prolonged periods when there is clear evidence of a demand for them. I do not have sight of that and Mr. Ryan might not be able to give an answer on it today, but I would be happy to revisit it with him and the HSE at a future meeting. If there is such a demand for services and if it is the case that there are empty beds, there is a disparity that must be addressed.
9512	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	 I do not wish to extrapolate too much from what Dr. Doody said or to put words in his mouth, but he referred to Linn Dara versus the Cork facility, Eist Linn. Eist Linn is a refurbished facility.
9513	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	 Would that come up to the mark as a fit-for-purpose or appropriate setting post-refurbishment for the type of structures he just spoke about?
9514	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	" My time is brief and I will refer back to Dr. Doody on the Cork facility at a future date as there are further questions to be asked about it to shed light on, and understand better, the dynamics that inform the running of the facility. There have been legitimate questions in the past about the culture that exists there. There are 130 individuals waiting more than 18 months for CAMHS assessments in my neck of the woods. If I am reading information relating to interventions correctly, and without putting words in anybody's mouth, the term ""resources"" is the key. It is preventing children and families in my area from receiving proper assessments. I understand there is a multidisciplinary team and that there are constraints with regard to recruitment and so forth. Has the HSE examined the multidisciplinary team model with regard to reducing the numbers on the waiting lists in such a way as to redeploy resources from other areas or through outside recruitment on short-term contracts or by ensuring that with proper supervision it might not necessarily have to be a psychiatrist who would make the initial assessment and it could be somebody else under the supervision of a psychiatrist? The bottom line is that the families I know must be able to get assessments. If we are talking about staving off problems down the line, as Deputy Lisa Chambers mentioned, intervention at the earliest stage is required. That is self-evident, and I am not a physician. It can prevent many problems down the line. Are more imaginative solutions being considered at present to ensure we can get the waiting list down in spite of the capacity and resource constraints?"
9515	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	 I apologise for cutting across Mr. Ryan but Dr. Doody is saying that 50% are seen within four weeks. I have 130 families waiting 18 months. That is based on a reply to a parliamentary question, which was Mr. Ryan's reply.
9516	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	 There is a big gap there.
9517	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	 What is best international practice vis-à-vis the multidisciplinary teams? Is it a flat structure or is it a hierarchical structure whereby the psychiatrist is the head honcho, as it were? Is that best international practice or does it differ in other countries?
9518	SeanSherlock	Labour	17094.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	101	 I will follow up with Mr. Ryan. We might have a meeting in Cork in respect of services there.

9531	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 I welcome Mr. Gloster and his colleagues to the committee. I congratulate him on his appointment as CEO. It is heartening to hear that he has some experience as a front-line professional in this space. That gives us some grounds for comfort. I am also encouraged by his attempt to ensure a transparent process in which we as public representatives are seen as key stakeholders in communications and the transparency of Tusla's functions. I wish to ask about the culture of the organisation. Mr. Gloster has spoken about ensuring a process of local ownership. I do not fully understand what that means. Is he talking about flattening the structure and getting rid of silos? What does that mean for social care workers, social workers, childcare workers or anybody under the employ of Tusla? We have to move beyond words and take actions. Every person working in the organisation must feel he or she has a pathway right to the top. There must be no Chinese walls. I would like Mr. Gloster's perspective on that.
9532	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 I welcome that. My second question is a programmatic one. The school completion programme, the guardian ad litem service and the creative community alternatives pilot programme are under way. They are three key programmes. I ask Mr. Gloster for his perspective on ensuring proper standards in the school completion programme and standardisation across the country. On the guardian ad litem legislation before the House, what is the full year cost of the guardian ad litem service? What transition planning is taking place to cede the service to the Department and what is Mr. Gloster's perspective of how the transition is proceeding? As a public representative I already see the outworking of the creative community alternatives programme, even though it is a pilot. It is having a positive impact on the ground. I am familiar with Cloyne Diocesan Youth Services, CDYS, in north Cork, an organisation that is probably typical of the many organisations that act as agents for this programme. CDYS is concerned that there will be staff lay-offs if its funding is not continued into 2020. Is it envisaged that the programme will continue? What tyre kicking, so to speak, has taken place in respect of that programme? From the conversations that I, as a Deputy in the area, am having with the people working on the programme, it is clearly having a positive impact on families. I am hopeful that we will see the continuation of the programme into 2020 and that Tusla will find a funding pot for it to ensure there will not be any lay-offs. I ask Mr. Gloster for his perspective on those questions.
9533	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 Is the €16 million adequate to meet the needs of the service as it is currently constituted?
9534	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	 That is the key. It is a demand-led service, which is at the discretion of the District Court. If the judge makes a determination, Tusla has to resource it.
9535	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 I appreciate the response. I spoke not only on behalf of CDYS but also in respect of the principle because-----
9536	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 -----by Mr. Gloster's own admission, it is a very good programme. It could become a flagship programme for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in future if resources can be allocated.
9537	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 I thank Mr. Gloster.

9545	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	81	 Mr. Tennant said that the RTÉ programme made a number of allegations relating to individuals in senior positions in these organisations and their failure to act on information relating to sexual abuse in scout groups across Ireland. Will he expand on that? What exactly does he mean by that statement?
9546	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	 Mr. Tennant would agree that they are his words. There is an agreement that there is a failure to act on information. In other words, staff or responsible persons in a safeguarding role arguably failed to act on information relating to sexual abuse. Is that the case?
9547	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	 No, I would like Mr. Tennant to answer the question.
9548	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	 They are Mr. Tennant's words. Mr. Tennant has to stand over them as chairman.
9549	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	" Something is fundamental to this. We all understand that there is Scouting Ireland now. We all accept that and have given goodwill to the new procedures and protocols that have been put in place relating to governance. However, Mr. Tennant is here as head of Scouting Ireland. I argue that he must also answer for what happened in the CBSI and the SAI. Our job here is to interrogate the dynamic that led to allegations against persons not being dealt with by the organisation. I am still unclear in my mind as to why, if the Children First guidelines were adopted in 2012, it took a full five years before Scouting Ireland brought in Ian Elliott. During that time, and arguably now, there were persons in the organisation, and I do not know if they are still in the organisation, who took receipt of information from people who were traumatised and those case files were put into a filing cabinet. A review was to have taken place in 2012 but we remain blind about where that review went, how those cases were managed and whether there are people who are part of the 2017 to 2019 review who are taking receipt of the information who are still part of the staff. We want to understand the culture that existed within the organisation. If, as Mr. Tennant suggests, the new broom is sweeping clean, are there people who were in receipt of information in 1987 and 1996, the years which were subject of the ""RTÉ Investigates"" programme, who are still on the staff and are part of the old culture who continue to be employed? That is the kernel of the matter. Mr. Tennant speaks of Scouting Ireland opening up its processes and creating helplines, but I find it hard to understand how anybody who was dealt with by personnel in 1987 or 1996 might find themselves being dealt with by the same personnel in 2017, 2018 or 2019. Does Mr. Tennant understand how that might look extremely bad for an organisation such as Scouting Ireland? Mr. Tennant is putting a lot of store in the Ian Elliott process. Everyone here accepts Ian Elliott's bona fides, but what they do not buy is that regardless of whether he is a consultant, he is paid by Scouting Ireland to conduct a review and therefore he is an employee of Scouting Ireland. We are questioning the independence of the process. What we are trying to get at is what will arise from the Elliott process when he reports. Regardless of whether he likes it, Mr. Tennant has an idea of how this will play out because he strikes me as someone who has gamed this, which I do not mean in a pejorative sense. He knows how the process is going; we do not. I do not know the contents of Ian Elliott's report. I am very concerned that it will go into the public domain and the people who made complaints in 1987 and 1996 and the people who were the subject of the ""RTÉ Investigates"" programme will have no justice, recourse or right of reply. Does Mr. Tennant see my point?"
9550	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	 Mr. Tennant should start with the staff.
9551	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	94	 I am asking the CEO to answer this question.
9552	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	 I thank Mr. Begley. That clarifies that matter.
9553	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	101	 Please talk about the 2012 review because I am trying to clarify in my mind what the status of that review is. Correct me if I am wrong but my interpretation of that was Scouting Ireland failed to carry out a scoping exercise to see if further work was required on the files of complaint. My understanding is that was never done, that an undertaking was given to carry out such work and that there are minutes to that effect. What was pertinent there was that Scouting Ireland would carry out the scoping exercise, it would have a statistical analysis for all child protection cases, especially for the files in Mount Melleray. We are being told it is ongoing process and I am confused why that is so because we are now in 2019.
9554	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	104	" I have a question about the traffic light system. Mr. Tennant said in his opening statement: ""Scouting Ireland has always reported any reportable offences"". What is the threshold for a reportable offence?"
9555	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	107	 I understand the current framework. We would be well versed in Children First, Signs of Safety and all of that but I want to know about happened historically because that is what is pertinent to this hearing.
9556	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	243	" I wish to distil this matter down to the ""RTÉ Investigates"" programme and extrapolate what Deputy Rabbitte has mentioned about the reporting mechanism. If we accept absolutely the bona fides of those who bore witness on that programme and accept them as genuine witnesses, it is arguable that there was a failure of reporting in that instance. That bridges the divide between the historical and the current. If the complaints go back to 1987 and 1996 and people in 2019 are saying there did not appear to be a process in respect of their individual stories, one would have to contend that there is a failure of reporting. Irrespective of the processes Scouting Ireland engaged in in 2012, the distinction it makes between the CBSI, SAI and the creation of Scouting Ireland in 2004, the start of the process, the Children First guidelines and the so-called review in 2012, all of those processes map across the narrative of the individuals who bore witnesses on the ""RTÉ Investigates"" programme. Having watched that programme, at a human level I would say there was a failure of reporting and a failure to deal properly within whatever protocols Scouting Ireland had designed post 2012 to deal with the trauma suffered by those people. Does Mr. Tennant agree that is the case and that we are still dealing with failures of reporting? We all acknowledge what Scouting Ireland is trying to do with its new governance procedures. We all acknowledge the involvement of those 14,000 families. We represent them also; they live among us in our communities. We are very much aware of the good work that goes on in Scouting Ireland right down to troop level. At the same time, we need to be satisfied beyond any doubt that the system is robust. It is hard to be convinced that it is robust in light of the ""RTÉ Investigates"" programme."
9557	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	245	 Indeed.
9558	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	247	 That is acknowledged, but I am talking about the present day.

9575	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 I welcome the Minister, who is appearing before us at short notice but with potential solutions. I am seeking a greater degree of clarity around the programme support payment of €1,500. I wish to show the Minister examples whereby, notwithstanding the process that providers have been through, in particular providers of long standing who have always been compliant and whose risk profiles have not increased, providers who are today able to get insurance are being told that the cost will increase twofold in one instance, fourfold in another and sixfold in another with which I am familiar. Notwithstanding everything that the Minister is saying and the exit from the market of a certain insurance operator, even where providers' risk profiles have not increased because they have always been compliant as per Child and Family Agency and HSE regulations, their premia costs are increasing. One is left with the impression that the insurance companies are taking advantage of the lacuna in the market by stepping in to profit from the challenge facing providers. How will the programme support payment be divided? Is it a one-off payment for every provider? What formula will be used? Under what heading will it be done? Will it be deemed a supplementary payment to meet the cost of overheads? Will it be a direct grant just by dint of the fact that someone is a provider? Is it the case that providers can benefit without having to go through a rigorous process? The Minister will be conscious of the fact that many providers will benefit from the time extension, but as public representatives, we are all conscious that the capital costs incurred by providers to become compliant and continue their operations have put them into debt.
9576	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 We should not overburden the sector to the extent where facilities are being forced to close because their capital and insurance costs are too high and the €1,500 payment is not enough to meet the challenges they face.
9577	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	 The Minister has stated that, by 28 December, the process will have been gone through.
9578	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	 I fail to understand how the Minister is going to get through a process where the childcare providers that I represent can interact with Pobal or the county childcare committee to benefit from this grant by-----
9579	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	 So it is not an application process.
9580	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	 Then there is the issue of the current insurance model-----
9581	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	 -----and the need to address the fact that people have received quotes with twofold, fourfold or sixfold increases, as in the three examples to which I can speak.
9582	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	 With respect, what the Minister stated does not give any comfort to those providers. There are also those people who have yet to be registered up to June. What can they derive from the process to which the Minister refers?
9583	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	 Did the Minister say 30%?
9584	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	98	 A provider who is not a member of Early Childhood Ireland paid €550 last year and is now being quoted €2,100. She will pay only €1,500 if she pays €245 to Early Childhood Ireland, but the risk profile of someone who is a member of Early Childhood Ireland does not increase or decrease.
9585	SeanSherlock	Labour	17178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	101	 The Government has skin in the game because the Minister partly funds Early Childhood Ireland. Therefore I believe she has some muscle in this regard with the insurance companies.

9597	SeanSherlock	Labour	17499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 I thank the Minister for coming before the committee today. I welcome his words in respect of rebuilding trust, particularly on the mother and baby homes issue. I note his remarks during the passage of the legislation in respect of requesting this committee to have regard to this issue. However, we are unclear what the Minister means by that. It would be useful to have his perspective in that regard. Underpinning all of that is the commitment by the Minister in regard to the information and tracing Bill. When will that Bill come before us? The general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues are matters on which we also need to have the Minister's perspective. We have received correspondence from Dr. Maeve O'Rourke on rights of access to information. I am sure the Minister will be in possession of that same information. The Minister told us that he had met with survivors and groups. I am sure they notified him of some legislative changes they seek in respect of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which would provide people with their birth certificate. In the case of the Clann project and the data protection issues, I understand a Bill on access to historical care-related archives is being drafted. I am raising many issues to which I do not expect the Minister to respond fully today but I want to put them on the record. On the issue of the interpretation of the GDPR, which we understand provides for access to information, and the information and tracing Bill, what are the timelines in that regard? How important will the information and tracing Bill be in dealing with the mother and baby homes issue? If it is to deal with the issues, the committee must see the Minister show good faith in respect of a throughput of work from a legislative point of view to ensure we do not end up hearing from stakeholders and then nothing happening after the fact. We need to work with the Minister, the stakeholders and everybody else involved in this matter. From a legislative point of view, we need to work in a process of partnership with all of the stakeholders to ensure the voices of the Maeve O'Rourkes and Claire McGettricks of this world are heard and that what they say is dealt with in a meaningful way so that we work through all of the issues. I am sure other members will make similar points on this issue. Has the Minister given consideration to amending the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide all adopted people with a birth certificate? When will the commission's report be published? I do not wish to deal with any of these issues until the committee has had sight of that report and read through its recommendations. I also want to give more time to the GDPR considerations and the information and tracing Bill considerations because they are all vital if we, as a committee, are going to deal with this issue in a sympathetic and meaningful way. These are general points. I realise that the clock is ticking down. I do not expect the Minister to reply completely in the one minute that is left but I am sure he will have an opportunity to do so in the course of proceedings.
9598	SeanSherlock	Labour	17499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 I thank everybody for their co-operation particularly on the time aspect. It is difficult with Covid considerations when we must work within a certain timeframe. There were a few technical glitches but in general it went very well. I thank the Minister and his officials for appearing today. We very much look forward to working with him and to our ongoing engagement. I propose that we publish the Minister's opening statement to the Oireachtas website. Is that agreed? Agreed.
9599	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 I welcome the witnesses. I would like to start with foster carers. How many additional foster carers were recruited as a result of the awareness-raising campaign?
9600	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	 I thank Mr. Gloster. I would like to draw his attention to a recent report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on services in Cork. The report identified unacceptable delays in respect of the child protection notification system. Has there been an improvement in those services? What improvement has arisen from that report?
9601	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	" I would like to move on to Kerry. Recent media reports highlighted the failure to refer 365 cases of suspected child abuse in the Kerry area. One report in The Irish Times said some delays were attributed to ""efforts by social workers to substantiate the abuse allegations before making a referral"". In asking these questions one tries to be as sympathetic as possible to those on the front line who had to go through each of the cases. I understand that 122 cases related to suspected abuse of children under the age of 18. Of these, 19 were given a high priority. I understand that about 115 cases were deemed to be of medium priority. Mr. Gloster used the word ""consistency"". I have highlighted it in his submission to the committee. Where do services in Kerry stand now as a result of this noted failure? One does not want to attribute blame but if there are delays we must ask why. Are delays a function of people within Tusla being overloaded or overworked? Is an excessive burden placed on individuals or teams seeking to ensure these cases are dealt with appropriately and in accordance with protocol and law and that they are watertight? Are people in Tusla getting the resources they need to triage these cases?"
9602	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	 I appreciate that. If I was to extrapolate from Ms Duggan's answer, it could be argued that there were people who were dealing with cases that arguably were beyond their experience. I think that would be a fair comment. Yes or no?
9603	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	 Can I make one more intervention?
9604	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	" I apologise. I will ask my question. We are endeavouring to understand how the culture of the Child and Family Agency works. I accept the statement of the CEO today in respect of moving the culture on or changing practices, culture and structures. We accept the bona fides of the CEO in that respect. When we use a term such as ""variation"", it is meaningless to me. It suggests to me there is a massive variation in practices in different parts of the country when it comes to timelines and to how cases are dealt with. If we are to be helpful to our constituents, we need to have a greater understanding of the culture that exists within. To be frank about it, notwithstanding the CEO's statement today, which I find very helpful, my perception is that there is still a long way to go before a lot of the practices that are happening within the Child and Family Agency are deconstructed such that the services flow more seamlessly, as constrained and all as it is by staffing and other administrative challenges. That is the point, essentially. There is more work to be done and we will have to revisit this."
9605	SeanSherlock	Labour	17520.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 That is fine.

9611	SeanSherlock	Labour	17527.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-01 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 I wish to record my appreciation for Dr. Muldoon and his colleagues appearing before the committee and for their report, which has given us a clear framework and overview. It has given me some riding instructions on where to pursue the specific issues. On foot of the report, I have been submitting parliamentary questions that seek to gain answers in respect of metrics and where moneys will be allocated across the CHOs for assessments of needs. What is becoming apparent to me is that there is a major disparity between individual CHOs. For example, if one is living in CHO 1, the funding allocated from the €7.8 million is €214,000, but if one is living in CHO 9, the allocation is approximately €1.9 million. My question is on processes and standardisation. This is a small country and I do not understand why there is such disparity between the CHOs in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme for children. I am still unclear as to how the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, will be able to work effectively based on the funding allocations they have received. Has Dr. Muldoon's office been able to critique that model in any way? I rely on his office and we rely on the replies from the HSE, although it must be said that the HSE has a way of responding to Deputies' questions and couching the language in a particular way that does not always give us the answers to the questions we asked. Based on the allocations provided, I remain sceptical about the ability of each CHO to deliver on the assessment of needs and diminish or tackle fully the lists for initial assessments in the first instance. I would dearly love to hear what the witnesses have to say about whether the teams are the right structures to tackle this problem.
9612	SeanSherlock	Labour	17527.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-01 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	 I thank Ms McKenna-Keane. Dr. Muldoon mentioned CAMHS. Is it his view that it operates differently depending on the region? It could be argued that there is a perception that the culture within CAMHS in some regions - these are my words - can be enclosed and silo based depending on which party of the country one is in and there is a protectiveness about each region's work such that it might be difficult to deconstruct the culture in order to deliver the service where it is most required.
9613	SeanSherlock	Labour	17527.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-01 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Will Dr. Muldoon confirm that what he said in his opening statement in respect of reimbursement was that there should be reimbursement for those families who seek a private assessment of needs? This would chime with many of us who want to see children get the services. If there was a mechanism for reimbursement by the State for those services, that would assist us greatly in dealing with these issues.
9614	SeanSherlock	Labour	17527.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-01 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 Is there a standard international metric of the cost of assessment per child? The new standard operating procedure for assessment of need was addressed in a reply to a parliamentary question of mine, which stated that the HSE has developed a standard operating procedure for the assessment of need process to ensure that children with disabilities and their families access appropriate assessment and intervention as quickly as possible, and the approach of assessment of need is consistent across all areas. This ultimately comes down to funding, resources and money. We know what the price of an assessment of need is in the private sector. I do not know if there is a costing in the public sphere. If there was an internationally recognised cost, depending on the needed level of intervention, that would help us in our understanding when interrogating the figures that the Minister, whoever that might be, puts before us.

9619	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	17	 I thank the witnesses. It has been compelling evidence that has dovetailed very much with the evidence of the ombudsman last week. The AOTI submission states: The new SOP does not facilitate the diagnosis of, for example Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability and will no longer be provided as a part of the AON protocol. Instead children will be identified as ‘health needs’ in the service statement. Mr. Smyth might help me to understand that more fully, as succinctly as possible. If it does not take in ASD and ID, what does it take in? If they come under health needs, will that not exclude potentially thousands of children? Children are being de facto reclassified, which means the services do not have to follow. Is that the case?
9620	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	19	 I would like Mr. Smyth's perspective on this, if I may, because he is a front-line professional.
9621	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	22	 I do not want to put words into anybody's mouth but my assessment of this, for what it is worth, is that with the SOP, some €7.8 million will be spent by the various community health organisations, and there will be any number of PTAs through the SOP model, but it will not deliver services, in essence, for children. Is that correct?
9622	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	24	 It is retrospective.
9623	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	26	 It is now the case that the ombudsman has objectively critiqued this model, as have three compelling witnesses. There is an evidence base, based on any rational , independent or objective assessments, to suggest that the policy is completely wrong and needs to be reviewed, reversed, rescinded and reshaped into a new policy, taking into account voices such as those of the three compelling witnesses we have heard from during this meeting. That is something the committee will take seriously. What are the witnesses' views on the consistency of outcomes for children among the CHOs? Reference was made to recruitment. I received a response on 17 September 2020 to a parliamentary question in which I asked the number of occupational therapists hired from each university by the HSE. The witnesses might note the following figures on the back of an envelope if they have a pen handy. In 2016, 135 were recruited, while in 2017, 120 were recruited, which was a reduction. In 2018, there was a further reduction to 119. Thus far in 2019, there have been 73. The difference between 73 and 119 is stark and I imagine that when the figures come in for 2020, there will have been a further reduction. How are we going to crack the conundrum of ensuring there are sufficient trained personnel to deliver the services, depending on what that service needs to look like, following our forthcoming interaction with the Minister? I will ask him these same questions. How are we going to deliver for children if there are not enough people who are suitably qualified to assist children such as Linda's? What is the best way to ensure we recruit enough people in order that every child can get access to the services?
9624	SeanSherlock	Labour	17534.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-12-08 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Discussion	29	 Does the PTA-SOP system call into question whether professionals are adhering to their codes of conduct in terms of how they deal with from a moral or ethical point of view with the child who comes before them for a 90-minute desktop service?

Like many other Deputies and Senators, I deal with this topic regularly in my constituency. The committee feels passionate about the issue and wanted to examine it as one of our first topics but we do not want to be part of a report that sits on a shelf gathering dust. I do not want to be the Chair of a committee that oversees anything like that. It was fantastic that we had these presentations today in advance of our meeting with the Minister of State because we can directly put those issues, concerns and questions to her and we will have further engagement in the new year. Then we can meet as a committee about some of the suggestions that were made, such as the cross-party motion. The good thing about this committee is that it is cross-party. All parties, as well as Independents, are represented. It is the appropriate forum in a way to try to get that cross-party approach that everybody wants to see. I sincerely thank the witnesses. The testimony of Ms Murphy and Ms Comerford was powerful. I know they are tired and that it is a battle and a struggle but we really appreciate them giving up their time and coming before the committee today and telling us their stories. When I speak about this topic I always say people should not have to tell their stories to their local Deputy or anybody, and the system should not be like that, but we appreciate being able to hear first hand from people exactly what they are going through so that, hopefully, we can use it to help fight the battle alongside them. I thank Mr. Noble, Mr. Smyth and the other witnesses. We really appreciate it. As I said, we will continue with this topic next week, when we will have engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte. We will possibly consider it again in the new year.

While we are on very friendly terms and I am conscious of not throwing any brickbats at her, I have some very direct questions. I think she will appreciate that. I represent the area covered by community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, which comprises Kerry, north Cork, north Lee and south Lee. Of the €7.8 million that was allocated for the 6,558 people, €1.1 million was allocated to CHO 4. The Minister of State said that as of 30 June, a total of 1,798 assessments of need have been completed over September to November, inclusive. Will she provide me with a breakdown of how this cuts across CHO 4? I ask because it is still not clear to me whether these assessments of need, which the Minister of State says are historical, are under the new SOP and are, therefore, under the 90-minute bracket. If the answer is that they are, then, given evidence that has come before the committee, I have serious concerns about that. The case for CHO 4 can be extrapolated to all the CHOs in the country. I need some words of comfort from the Minister of State for the families and children whom I represent so that they do not come back to me in a matter of months, having received the initial assessment of need, to say there has been no follow-up of services, or saying the assessment of need, as previous witnesses have suggested, is a sub-par method by any international standard of assessing a child with needs. That is the first reassurance I seek.

As this will be an ongoing issue, I would appreciate if she offered to communicate with the committee's Chairman to give figures for each of the CHOs to assess those numbers on an ongoing basis. This would be very useful. We will put down our own parliamentary questions anyway. When the ombudsman was before the committee, he suggested without any ambiguity that some sort of a refund scheme could be established for those families who wished to procure private assessments. The Minister of State, in a parliamentary reply to me dated 30 October 2020, referred to a letter from Dr. Cathal Morgan in which it was stated that, in relation to Sláintecare funding, which is the €7.8 million provided on a once-off basis and which is time limited, the CHOs would engage with private providers in their areas to procure private assessments where appropriate. Will the Minister of State provide us with a breakdown of the cost and the number of private assessments? As I understand it, the €7.8 million is not fully allocated or spent yet. To what extent is that funding being given over to private providers? Once that funding is spent, is there scope for families who wish to seek private assessments to get a refund? That would provide a massive alleviation because the €7.8 million will not cover the full extent of the demand. That is the point I am making.

After this backlog is cleared, or even if this backlog is cleared, there will always be demand and the resources will not always follow. The Minister of State will know from her own experience that families are forced into a situation where they are waiting on the public list for an inordinate time. The pressure comes on them to take out a credit union loan to get a private assessment. All families will do that if needs be. Is there any scope, as per the ombudsman's suggestion, for some sort of recoupment of those costs for individual families at the family level? Could the State intervene to facilitate that family or, if the family made a request for the recoupment of expenses, could an application or some sort of protocol or process be set up to facilitate that?

As she will know, having watched or listened to these meetings over the past few weeks the stories told here have been heartbreaking. It was not just in this committee room that we heard such stories because we have all experience in dealing with people in these situations and we all want to find a solution. Therefore, we, as a committee, welcome the opportunity to engage further with the Minister of State. We are on board with doing anything we can to further such provision for these children and their families. I welcome the monthly meetings and the fact that they will continue. I thank the Minister of State and her officials, Ms Jenny Anderson and Mr. Noel Byrne, for appearing via video link. We look forward to an ongoing engagement with the Minister of State. Is it agreed that we publish the Minister of State's opening statement? Agreed. As this is our last meeting before Christmas, I wish everybody a happy Christmas and thank everybody, the members and the secretariat for all of the work that they have done. This year it has been a lot more difficult than normal to organise meetings due to the arrangements that must be observed to prevent the spread of Covid, including only having two hours for a meeting. Thankfully, the arrangements have worked well so far. I wish everybody, the Minister of State and her staff a very happy Christmas.

9643	SeanSherlock	Labour	17604.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	" I acknowledge the statement of Councillor Mary Linehan Foley, Mayor of Cork. I wish to quote from the statement she issued last week. As many will be aware, I am the child of a mother and baby home. I was born in Bessborough Mother and Baby Home. This is a fact I never shied away from. I have come to know my birth mother and consider myself to be very fortunate. But I know there are many who have not been so fortunate. She goes on to say: It’s almost a contradiction for me to issue an apology on behalf of an organisation that I was myself a survivor of; and now a member of. But I want all survivors to know that I mean this truly and sincerely. I know that while these actions took place in the not too distant past, as a society we have transformed entirely. But we must never forget the part we played in this painful past, never forget what happened and ensure it never happens again. I want to acknowledge her words because it is important to listen to somebody who is a public representative who was born in a home. She wants a process and wants us to move on, but the process must be a robust one. That is the reason we are here today. My first question for the Minister is a technical one. Are the minutes of the collaborative forum recorded? ""Yes"" or ""No""."
9644	SeanSherlock	Labour	17604.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 The second question relates to narrative. The Minister, I think it is fair to say, has described the language of the executive summary as being cold. In the absence of us having recourse to questioning the members of the commission - they have refused invitations to be here and I am not going to pass judgment on that - the Minister is the person in the firing line for questions on the narrative. The process of correcting the narrative has yet to be fleshed out. If I understood him correctly, what he is saying is that through the interdepartmental process he is going to seek some mechanism that he has called a right to rectification. I would like to know the following, in very simple terms. Will he consult with external bodies, such as the Collaborative Forum on Mother and Baby Homes, about what that will mean in real terms for people like the following? Today, I spoke to a lady that I will call Mary. She said to me that she gave evidence to the commission, not the confidential committee. She said that she did receive her transcript. She said it was reflected in report but she tells me that there were inaccuracies. Normally, politicians are good judges of character and when I spoke to this person today I knew well within a minute or two that this was a reasonable, rational person who, crucially, did not give evidence to the confidential committee, she gave it to the commission but there are inaccuracies. No matter how small or big those inaccuracies are, they are inaccuracies. What can I tell this person in respect of a process that the Minister will now create in the absence of, we assume, the commission not being reconstituted again although we would support calls for that? What process can that person rely upon now to ensure that her story is accurately reflected in this report? The Minister, dare I say it, has to give a simple, clear answer in respect to the right of rectification. Will there be a restorative process? Will he open up a whole chapter again in respect of people such as I have described? There are many of them out there, we all have testimony of it and the Minister has acknowledged those people and the fact that there has been no correct interpretation of what they said to the confidential committee and the commission. What will the Minister do to ensure that the narrative is corrected for people? We cannot talk about burials legislation, and information and tracing, until there is confidence that the narrative has been corrected.
9645	SeanSherlock	Labour	17604.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 If material has been destroyed, how does the Minister reconcile what he has just said with that fact? What will be the entire cost of this process in terms of a compensatory process, building out a package with access to medical cards, counselling, healthcare and so on? What is the indicative budget for this entire process, as we stand?
9646	SeanSherlock	Labour	17604.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 I thank the Minister and all of the members for their co-operation. It is really difficult when we have to fit everything into two hours. Deputy John Paul Phelan wanted to contribute but, unfortunately, a member needs to be within the Leinster House complex to contribute to public sessions. I thank all the officials for attending. Is it agreed to publish the opening statement on the Oireachtas website? Agreed.
