However, presumably the Department of Health, ergo the Minister, ergo the taxpayer, has some mechanism by which it can express an opinion on the level of claims. I refer both to the cost of those claims and the number of those claims. In other words, has there ever been an expression of worry by anybody in the Department of Health, at a sufficiently high level - right up to the Minister - in respect of the level of claims?

This leads me on to the next question. In his opening statement, Mr. Dempsey stated ""The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project."" To what extent is the claims process mapped onto that ""long and detailed analysis""? If I understand the previous witnesses correctly, it seems to me that if one was trying to map who is winning the battle of the claims war, the board is about a nose ahead at present but in the long-term analysis, it could be that the contractor might come out on top from a financial point of view. In other words, is there a deeper analysis of this taking place around the claims process?"

1215	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	137	 I join in welcoming the witnesses this morning. I have a short time so if I can have a rapid fire round of questions, I would be grateful for that opportunity. Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing? Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses. I speak specifically for Cork. I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time. Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that. We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit. In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane? How soon will that happen?
1216	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	139	 On remuneration, am I given to understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been notified of the remuneration of all persons employed by HRI or its subsidiaries?
1217	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	141	 In essence, while Mr. Kavanagh is saying a derogation has been sought — I refer specifically to there being a conflict between the derogation and GDPR requirements in respect of readily identifiable persons, to use Mr. Kavanagh’s phrase — is the information on the remuneration of the relevant person or all persons still held with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine? I want to be very clear about this. If we cannot get the information from HRI directly, can this committee, in this era of transparency, seek it directly from the Department? Where an individual is serving on a State body, is a member of a board or holds an executive position, and where significant amounts of taxpayers’ money are being given to the board or organisation in question, the least we should expect is the notification of the remuneration package. I do not believe it is fair to say the information is commercially sensitive because HRI is, de facto, operating a monopoly in respect of the horse racing industry in Ireland. Does Mr. Kavanagh agree?
1218	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	143	 I thank Mr. Kavanagh. My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse. I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman. HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow. There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair. Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar? I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity. I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them. I am putting my hand up for the garden fair that takes place in Mallow every year. Can we expect the resumption of events like that in the not-too-distant future, subject to public health guidelines?

I wish to ask about the existence of the EU procurement directive. I profess to be somewhat ignorant on this issue but I will seek the witnesses' guidance. I understand that Article 20 of the directive allows for reserved contracts for certain types of entities. I am speaking specifically about social enterprises or those people who operate within the disability sector. My understanding is that this provision of the directive is not being operated in Ireland. I am seeking some sort of appraisal or response from the witnesses from the OGP with regard to whether it is being operated. If it is not possible to answer my question within the timeframe allocated to me today, could there be a report of some written correspondence to the committee about whether or not disability-focused organisations are being excluded from applying for reserved contracts?
1224	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	2019 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	94	 Am I to understand that the OGP is not obliged to police, a word which I use lightly, whether or not local authorities or public bodies are actually exercising the reserved contracts or the Article 20 provision? Is that the case?
1225	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	2019 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	96	 Mr. Quinn says that the OGP has transposed the directive faithfully, verbatim, if I understand him correctly. It is not a leading question but it would be worrying if we are not using reserved contracts to encourage certain categories of workers who are able to access them. One would hope that the OGP would be as proactive as possible, especially in the disability sector and social enterprise.

1229	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	6	 I thank the Chairman. I thank Mr. Black and his colleagues for attending before the committee today. I want to start with the situation of Ulster Bank, which is a key lender in the SME food sector. In my analysis, it has been seen as the key bank to go to for small to medium-sized food companies seeking to access lending for productive purposes. I want to get a sense from Mr. Black as to, first, whether there is now a high level of exposure for that sector, given the decision of Ulster Bank to pull out of the market, and, second, whether SBCI is aware of this and if it is something that is on its agenda. If we take the two challenges of Covid and Brexit, as well as the importance of the food sector and the recognition of Ulster Bank as being a go-to bank for small to medium-sized food companies that are export driven, is there a consciousness within SBCI of the need to plug that gap in lending? Is this a conversation that is taking place at present? I would like to get that perspective from Mr. Black, if I may.
1230	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	8	 Is my perception right and is my research solid in saying that there is a strong relationship between food companies and Ulster Bank in particular? I accept that there are strong relationships with other banks. Ulster Bank is, however, the go-to bank for certain entities in the food sector. I refer, for example, to small, mainly family-run start-ups or, perhaps, high potential start-up companies that are scaling up and exporting. I am seeking comfort from the SBCI on what Mr. Black said about the MOU. Is that Mr. Black's view, insofar as he can speak for Ulster Bank and insofar as we are still going through a process here? I do not want to see a chunk of lending potential slipping off the radar and a chunk of a sector that is vital to Ireland's economic interests finding itself in a position where it has no go-to bank for the type of funding the SBCI provides to the on-lenders. Can Mr. Black give me some level of comfort in that regard? A signal from the SBCI in respect of that matter would give some assurances to people who live, breathe and work in this sector every day.
1231	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	10	 I understand that the agriculture fund set up by the SBCI was oversubscribed. Is it the view of the SBCI that there is potential for a new funding facility in that sector? Again, this is a vital sector. It is export-driven and faces the headwinds of Covid-19. Obviously, Brexit still hangs above many companies and producers like the sword of Damocles. Is it the intention of the SBCI to look at potential funding in the agriculture sector? It is lending for productive purposes. The fund in question was oversubscribed in the previous round. Mr. Black might also give us his perspective on that.
1232	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	12	 Can Mr. Black talk me through the strategic review for the period 2020 to 2025? He referred to new SME funding for the energy retrofit sector. How advanced is that conversation at present? When does Mr. Black see the SBCI moving into that sector for productive lending? How does he propose that those moneys will be disbursed? Reference was made to the credit unions. To what extent does Mr. Black see credit unions as a viable option for funding into this sector? It very much filters down to the local economy. Where stands the conversation in that regard?
1233	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	14	 Mr. Black mentioned the Department. Obviously, the SBCI is in discussions with the parent Department. Detail is important for people like us in the committee. Is that money proposed to be divested through the SBCI's on-lending partners? What are the entities through which Mr. Black is talking about divesting moneys?
1234	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	16	 I will move very briefly on to the issue of pay. Are pay rates for employees set by the NTMA?
1235	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	18	 They are performance-related pay rates.
1236	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	20	 Why were performance-related payments made in 2019, for instance, when SBCI had a loss that year of €408,000?
1237	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	22	 If I may please Mr. Black, as I have limited time, I am not being facetious in any way but I want to understand the dynamic or the metrics Mr. Black uses when determining pay rates. Respectfully, I fail to see the link between quantitative easing and the setting of pay scales.
1238	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	25	 There was some mention in the review relating to the abatement and pulling back of SBCI. I would read that language as withdrawing. Is the bank's existence justified at the present time?
1239	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	287	" I appreciate the Chair for letting me back in. I have an example of an SME that is operating in the tourism, leisure and outdoor sector. The owner made approaches to Close Brothers and KBCI in respect of SBCI funding. When he contacted KBCI, he was informed that it was using the SBCI future growth loan scheme fund, but it was, and I quote from the email, ""only offering loans to businesses registered with a professional body"". I ask the SBCI to carry out an examination of that interaction internally. I can give the witnesses the name of the company following the meeting. None of us wants to see unnecessary impediments being put in the way of SMEs if they happen to be seeking funding in a sector of the economy that might not pass muster with ""banking types"". I might be a little unkind in my use of language. The application is somewhat left field, but nonetheless, it is worth further examination. The owner seems to have to jump through hoops with the SBCI in order to pass muster. The main point that I am making is that certain sectors of the economy should not be discounted on the basis that they are not deemed to be fashionable or de rigueur."

Is it agreed to ask the clerk to seek any follow-up information and to carry out any agreed action arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed. The committee will adjourn until 2 p.m. on Thursday, 11 March when it will meet in private session. The next public meeting is on Tuesday, 23 March when the committee will consider correspondence it has received and that members wish to deal with in public.
1251	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	82	 I will go straight into questions. I thank Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for being here. I want to ask about the fishery harbour centres financial reporting and financial management review group within the Department. It is quite a mouthful of a name. First, when specifically will the work of that group be completed? Second, there is to be a report on debt management. I am trying to understand why specifically there is to be a report on debt management; what is the nature of that debt and how much is that debt?
1252	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	84	 I apologise for interrupting Mr. Gleeson. What is the nature of the debt? Are we talking about the charging regime within those entities?
1253	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	86	 How much is outstanding in debt on the books of the six centres?
1254	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	90	 Forgive my blinding ignorance. In real time, as of today, how much is outstanding in dues?
1255	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	92	 That is a fair lot of invoices.
1256	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	94	 I understand. I will move on. I thank Dr. Beamish because that is enlightening. Regarding the review of the review of the charging order, when does Mr. Gleeson propose to go to the public consultation process? Is he going to the public consultation process with a view to increasing the charging order?
1257	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	96	 I thank Mr. Gleeson. It does my heart good to hear him say that, because all businesses in the current climate need a fighting chance, especially those people who live in coastal communities. I will draw a line under that and thank him for that.
1258	SeanSherlock	Labour	17667.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-20 00:00:00	Business of Committee	98	 In the 2012 charging order, which is the last one I looked at, the schedule of charges-----

1271	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	93	 I join in welcoming Ms Forbes and her team before us today. I acknowledge the work RTÉ has done throughout the pandemic as part of its public broadcasting remit, particularly in reassuring people and relieving their anxiety over the past 12 months or so and imparting information based on science and fact. I only have a few minutes. There are so many things I would like to talk about but I will focus on the independent sector. As I understand it, the independent production sector is protected under the Broadcasting Act 2009. I want to delve a little deeper into how Ms Forbes proposes to increase that funding as we open up society and the economy. What reassurances can she give to that sector that it will be the beneficiary of increased funding for output for the next 12 to 24 months?
1272	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	95	 I thank Ms Forbes. She has hit the nail on the head. There is an obligation on RTÉ as per the legislation and she has confirmed that it will fulfil that commitment. That is where I was going with my point so I welcome that reply. I wholeheartedly agree about how people procure their content now and the multiplicity of devices that are available to people. We have not been strong enough politically in acknowledging that content is not free. There is a price to be paid and a cost incurred in creating content. We will all watch with interest what happens in Australia and Ms Forbes made a point about how that might permeate through to Ireland. I am interested in whether RTÉ is now thinking about 5G and things like the roll-out of enhanced fibre broadband. Donnybrook and the citadel that is RTÉ was a place where there was a lot of production going on but surely to goodness with the advent of 5G, and people are already talking about 6G, there is a mechanism to use more geographical locations to produce content and give voice to the regions in how we produce content in this country, because the technology would allow us to do that.
1273	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	93	 Okay. I thank Ms Forbes. I apologise for the earlier technical issues. As a result of holding meetings remotely due to Covid, there can sometimes be a bit of overlap between witnesses and committee members and they can end up talking over one another. We have tried to manage as best we can. I thank the witnesses for their patience and assistance with all of that. I also thank them for joining us today and for the information they have provided. I also thank Mr. McCarthy and his staff for attending and for assisting the committee in today's meeting. Is it agreed that the clerk to the committee will be requested to seek follow-up information and carry out any actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we will note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed. The Committee of Public Accounts is adjourned until 2.30 p.m. tomorrow, 28 April, when the committee will meet in private session.

1275	SeanSherlock	Labour	17702.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-25 00:00:00	Business of Committee	33	 I support Deputy Catherine Murphy on this. It is an area we need to devote more time to. There are myriad questions arising from that response. The mapping of contracts across the higher education institutions, HEI, landscape is unclear and opaque. Further light needs to be shone on it because it has permutations for the public purse. I would support 100% any attempts by this committee to devote some considerable time as necessary to this issue. The Minister stated at an Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, conference that he wishes to do something about precarious contracts. I recognise that is a matter of policy; however, it seems that even at ministerial level there is a recognition of the nature of these contracts and we should continue the work of the last Committee of Public Accounts on this issue. I would like to explore further the relationship from a spending point of view between Enterprise Ireland and some of the institutes of technology, IOTs, for instance, in relation to things like innovation vouchers and partnerships. There is a whole space that warrants further examination in respect of how funding is used to support the scaling-up and spin-out of companies, and how the spin-out infrastructure is supported within these organisations. Where is the money really going? Is it resulting in the level of output it is supposed to result in, in relation to job creation or the creation of companies that are productive, as opposed to companies sustained within a system, in some cases for inordinate amounts of time? It begs the question about productivity. I would support that call.
1276	SeanSherlock	Labour	17702.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-25 00:00:00	Business of Committee	33	 The time limit of two hours is very restrictive and I have tried to stretch that five minutes out, particularly where a member is in the middle of trying to get an answer or an Accounting Officer is in the process of answering a question. I have tried to stretch it to six or seven minutes and to get a second round of questions in. We have managed that, I think, at every meeting since last September. Please God everything will go well with vaccinations and with Covid-19 and we will move into a situation where we can have longer meetings and get all members into one room, where I will be able to see the whites of members’ eyes. There is better chemistry where people are in one room. Online is an improvisation but it is not as satisfactory. For now, however, we are bound by the health regulations. We can reschedule another meeting. We will be bringing them back in on emergency accommodation. For the other matters, we should seek to do that as well. There is a big spend on housing, which is welcome. Some of us would argue for more but that is a separate issue. It is important we deal with that Department as fully as possible. We will try to do that. Last week, we agreed our draft report on our engagement with the Office of Public Works, OPW. We asked the clerk how we might launch the report. A launch on the Plinth is not seen as practical for committee report launches as there are difficulties with physical distancing, limitations on numbers attending and the weather, although it is supposed to pick up. The AV room also has restrictions on the numbers that can attend. It is possible to launch the report on Teams. While we would need a committee room for it to be a public broadcast, we could also hold a launch on Teams that is not publicly broadcast. The advantages of that are we would not need a committee room to do it, there are no restrictions on the numbers of members or journalists attending, members can join remotely from a place of their choosing as it is not a formal meeting of the committee and the launch can be recorded and published on the committee’s web page. I propose that, subject to the necessary arrangements being made on time, we launch the report at 12 noon on Thursday after our public meeting with the Department of Transport. As usual, a press release will be send out by email and shared on social media. Are members happy to agree to that approach? Agreed. If no member wishes to raise any other matter, we will adjourn until Thursday, 27 May at 9.30 a.m., when we will engage with the Department of Transport.
1277	SeanSherlock	Labour	17704.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-27 00:00:00	2019 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	25	 I thank the Chairman for facilitating me as I had some technical issues. I welcome the officials. I will focus on programme B, land transport, which is 80% of the overall gross expenditure for 2019. I also acknowledge that the 2021 total is €3.3 billion. Arising from land transport, there is the Road Safety Authority, RSA. The Secretary General will be aware that there is a serious backlog in driver theory testing and driver testing. Approximately 100,000 people are waiting for driver theory testing and the number is similar for the other test. Today's issue is the relationship between the Department of Transport and the RSA in working through the backlog of lists. I wish to explore further that relationship in how resources are deployed by the Department to the RSA. The reason I am asking specifically about the RSA is that notwithstanding the positive engagement that I have had with the agency on driver theory testing and driver test backlogs, the announcement in the past number of days of an interim solution to be provided by moving driver theory testing online did not get off to a great start because the number of people who will be tested under that online system will be 4,000. There are also further inherent issues then as to how the technology is deployed. Why, for instance, are only 4,000 people being tested online with this new interim solution? How is the Department resourcing that? What is the nature of the relationship of the RSA with the Department to ensure that we move from 4,000 being tested up to the full cohort and backlog being tested, which is the full 100,000 plus of people who are waiting for tests? What are the technological issues arising from this interim solution where we are being told that to apply for the online driving test someone has to have a Windows 8 personal computer, PC, or above and that those using a phone, tablet or Mac computer will be excluded, as will those using android or iOS? Applicants must also be able to use Google Chrome and the minimum speed has to be 5 Mbps. I want to explore with the Department its relationship with the RSA on the basis that it is a key Department in getting Ireland moving again in a post Covid-19 society. If we are to get people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Department of Social Protection payments to enable them to move, we need driver theory and driver testing to be fit for purpose. What is Mr. Spratt's current appraisal on when the Department expects that full cohort of people to be tested and what resources are being deployed by his Department to ensure that the RSA is fully resourced so that people can get back on the road?

The 100,000 people waiting for the driver theory test and the 100,000 who are waiting for the full test may take some comfort from those words. For the cohort who are waiting on the driver theory test, the technology needs to be user-friendly and fit for purpose and there should be protocols put in place in terms of the use of the technology, in that when camera technology is being used, assurances are given to the person who is being tested that any data collected is collected in a safe and appropriate way. That is important for people who have decided to put trust in the system. If the RSA can reach a target of 50,000 per month, the lists will be got through within a short space of time. I welcome the statement by the Secretary General on providing us with an update and commitments in respect of close of business tomorrow. It is important we ensure we can get people moving again. So many people are reliant on this. It is an important service for everybody in this country.

I do not want Mr. Spratt to give me an answer now, in terms of the roads in County Offaly. There is a special case for north County Offaly, because the roads are over peat. Mr. O'Leary is nodding in agreement. There is a serious issue there, in terms of road safety. Can someone please have a look at the R400? The engineers and councillors need the money for it. The local population needs it. There are road safety issues with the R400 in the area where the old Derrygreenagh works were. There is a serious situation in north Offaly, because it is going over peat. The other thing I wanted to briefly mention was the 1951 CIÉ pension scheme. I do not want to go into it in detail. There are people there for 40 years who have paid into a pension scheme and are left in a precarious situation. The trustees have made a High Court application. There should be no further discussion of the 1951 scheme, until that happens. Another member of the committee has already raised this. The Department needs to keep an eye on it, because there are people who have paid into that scheme throughout their term of employment with CIÉ. The last thing I want to raise with the witnesses is the issue of bus shelters. I have had to write, as a member of a local authority and as a Deputy, to the chair of the National Transport Authority, about bus stops for Mountrath, Castletown, Borris-in-Ossary, Doonane, Crettyard and Ballylynan. It is crazy stuff. There is provision under the local authority Act brought in by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, whereby that power is given to local authorities. I did not agree with him on many things, but one of the things he did was the provision in that Act. There is huge frustration at local authority level, because they feel there is significant micromanagement by the Department of Transport. Local authorities have excellent engineers. There are good local authority members. There are good management systems in place. I know it is a matter for the Minister of Transport more than the witnesses, but I do not want to let the opportunity pass. We need to allow the local authorities to breathe. We need to breathe a bit of life and democracy back into local authorities. Can the issue of bus shelters be delegated back to local authorities? If one goes over the Border, into the Six Counties, there are bus shelters all over the place. There are bus shelters at every half-mile point on the road, including for school buses. We cannot seem to get them in counties Laois or Offaly and every other Deputy here will concur with me on this, in terms of their counties. It is too bureaucratic. It is the local authority. Give it the money. Let it do it. It will do it cheaper as well. I ask Mr. Spratt to come back to me with a note on that. I am saying that in a constructive way. It is good news about the driving tests. I welcome that staff numbers are being increased. We look forward to that being expedited. We are out of time. I thank all the witnesses for joining us and the Department for the information it provided on a wide range of issues. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting the committee. It is agreed for the clerk to seek any follow up in the information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed we publish any opening statements and briefings provided for us today? I remind members of the committee that directly after the meeting there will be a photo shoot outside, on the Plinth, so they should have their best suits on. I remind members also that we will launch a report on our engagement with the Office of Public Works at 12 o'clock and that the launch will be published on the Oireachtas website. I thank everyone. Go raibh míle maith agaibh. The committee is adjourned. On 9.30 a.m. next Tuesday, 1 June, the committee will meet in private session.

1281	SeanSherlock	Labour	17711.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-03 00:00:00	Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government (resumed)	28	 On the inspection regime in respect of HAP and RAS, I have a parliamentary question from Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I will speak specifically about the local authorities of Cork County Council and Cork City Council. It shows that the number of inspections carried out to September 2020 in County Cork was 611 and in the city of Cork was 434. Notwithstanding the public health restrictions, we can take out all of the last 12 months in terms of the inspection regime. Is the Secretary General satisfied that the inspection regime is properly funded - we all speak from our own experiences as public representatives – such that it can be ensured that the policy and legislation are working effectively and we do not have families living in absolute slums? That is how I would describe some of the properties I have seen that are beneficiaries of RAS or HAP payments. I contend that the inspection regime is not fit for purpose. I do not want to put the blame on the local authorities. What is the link between the Department and the local authorities in respect of ensuring the inspectorate passes muster and is fit for purpose? I put the question to the Secretary General.

The point I make here is that the witnesses acknowledge that there is an issue with inspections. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a bearing in terms of the number of inspections. I ask that this is prioritised, so that the Department would liaise with the local authorities in order to ensure that the inspection regime is fit for purpose, robust, and properly resourced, and so that there is a significant increase in the number of whole-time equivalents, WTEs, that would be tasked with this. That is the only ask I have. I do not think it is fair to ask a tenant to walk around with a mobile phone to look at his or her house. We have to get people back into houses as quickly as possible. This is about taxpayers’ money at the end of the day. If we are talking about taxpayers’ money, we cannot have a situation where we have quite literally slum landlords. This is the outworking and the resourcing of the policy. Families with children with respiratory illnesses are coming to me because they are not in proper, fit-for-purpose accommodation. That is a poor day for Ireland in terms of how we deal with families under those schemes.

1285	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	15	 Thank you, Chairman. I hope you are picking me up, load and clear, there.
1286	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	17	 First of all, I will start by wishing Niall well. Forgive me, if I refer to you in an informal manner. I am a former Minister of State in that Department and I have worked with you in the past. We have all been tremendously impressed by the leadership that you have given in such challenging times. I note that you said you were retiring, but you are stepping down as Secretary General. We hope that you will stay within the service in some way, shape or fashion. Personally, I wish you well. It is important that we acknowledge the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, both for the work that it does at the bilateral level in terms of its bilateral relations with countries throughout the globe and also at the multilateral level where it deals with the United Nations and other such organisations. We are lucky to have a Department of Foreign Affairs that is staffed by what I would I call the A team in terms of the work that it does as a Department throughout the globe. I note, in particular, the reference to consular services. For us, as TDs, and for Senators, our primary interface with the Department of Foreign Affairs is normally through either consular services or the Passport Office. I want to acknowledge that that often hidden and silent work is very significant and that it has helped so many of our constituents throughout the country, particularly where bereavements have occurred. I fully acknowledge that role because it is vitally important, and also that it would be resourced appropriately. Let me start with that. On passports, where stands the foreign birth registrations process? That might be one that the Secretary General might want to defer to his colleagues.
1287	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	21	 I am happy to receive a note after this meeting, if that is possible, in terms of a real-time analysis of where the foreign birth registrations is at present. I will move on. It is significant that today we have a British-Irish intergovernmental meeting here in Dublin. The organisation of that will consume a lot of the resources of the Department. Where are the priorities in respect of the reconciliation fund in the light of the challenges of Brexit and Covid and is there a clear earmarking of funds now to meet those challenges? I would like an understanding of where the thinking is on how those resources are deployed and if there is a pivot towards the challenges of Brexit, or not.
1288	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	23	 I thank Mr. Burgess. I will move now the Irish Aid programme. A number of conflicts have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Ethiopia where there is an Irish embassy and aid programmes. I refer to the Gambella and Tigray regions. I am concerned about Irish citizens who are working in those regions. I am concerned on the one hand that there may not be a sufficient deployment of resources to ensure the safety and security of Irish citizens and, on the other, that the programmes, in particular what are known as the safety net programmes to ensure food security, are being hampered by the conflict. Can Mr. Burgess reassure us that there is sufficient protection of Irish citizens, in particular embassy staff, Irish, non-Irish and local, and of those working in NGOs in the conflict areas in order that they can carry out their work? What is their status? It would be helpful to know if increased resources have been deployed into that effort in real time.
1289	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	25	 That is reassuring. That is the first time that we have heard that. We have read about the conflict in Tigray but it is reassuring that there are clear protocols for the safety of both embassy staff and those working on the ground. I cannot let the opportunity pass to ask about Bóthar and whether there was any financial exposure of Irish Aid or the Department to the recent Bóthar scandal. Can the Secretary General tell us anything about any exposure that the taxpayer has had?
1290	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	27	 I am conscious of what the Chair is saying. I will put the question another way. Has Irish Aid ever funded Bóthar? That is a factual yes-no answer. I want to get a perspective without prejudicing any ongoing case.
1291	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	30	 I wish to ask about the occupied territories and the disbursement of funding, the latest round of which is about €12.7 million but I am open to correction on that. Is the Department satisfied that this disbursement is going exactly where it needs to go? I know there is a particular emphasis on funding education within the occupied territories. Can Mr. de Búrca or the Secretary General provide a perspective on the importance of funding by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish taxpayer into the occupied territories?
1292	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	32	 I wish to thank the people in Ramallah as well for the work they do on behalf of the Irish citizens. They do a great job there.

There are 906 claims notified under clause 10.3 for determination by the employer's representative. Mr. Devine has sent us the document on the 10.3 clause and there are six subheadings. People will be able to interpret them quite easily. If I understand it correctly what the witnesses have stated today is the value of those 906 claims is now approximately €446 million. Is that correct?

We do not have the mechanical, electrical or lift contractors before us. We have to take everything Mr. Devine is saying at face value. I am trying to dig a little bit deeper on this. It seems to me the claims arise from variations made. Notwithstanding the line, which is well co-ordinated, that has been put forward to us today by the Department of Health and Mr. Gunning that external costs will drive this project well beyond whatever figure is to be determined and well beyond the initial costs and the stated public cost, there is also the issue that the development board, and I am trying to be as objective as possible, is part of the process of driving up costs because of the variations it is making. Is this a reasonable statement to make? Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations. The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is. Where there are such variations to the order outlined, any mechanical, electrical or lift variations have to come from the subcontractor to the main contractor through that postbox to the board. Is this correct? Do I have that right or am I wrong?

This is a matter of public record so it should not be sensitive information. Can the witnesses quantify the number of proceedings that have ended up in the High Court? On how many occasions has the development board ended up in the High Court? Who has instigated those proceedings and what has been the cost to the taxpayer, ultimately, of that?

1349	SeanSherlock	Labour	17816.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-16 00:00:00	Business of Committee	121	 I, too, join in thanking Mr. Reid and his colleagues throughout the HSE for the work that has been undertaken during this pandemic, for which there has been no playbook and no precedent. It was something that had to be managed in an emergency context and the level of care people received has, by and large, been excellent. I acknowledge that Mr. Reid has always made himself available to members of the Oireachtas on issues that have arisen throughout the pandemic. When certain matters arose within my constituency, they were responded to so I have to acknowledge that. I will focus on non-compliance in procurement. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that the HSE is developing systems and is making significant improvements in that regard. That is to be acknowledged. I will focus on the more than €40 million that has been spent by the HSE to date across a range of services provided by Ernst & Young, PwC, Grant Thornton, Deloitte and KPMG, both pandemic related and non-pandemic related. Does €40 million represent value for money for the taxpayer?
1350	SeanSherlock	Labour	17816.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-16 00:00:00	Business of Committee	123	 We know that Ernst & Young has provided services to the tune of €12 million and that PwC has provided services for €5.1 million. A total of €17.5 million has been spent across the five companies up to March 2021. We know it is governed by a framework agreement. What we do not know, and this is what I am trying to get at, is how those individual contracts are managed within the work stream. We know that individual companies provide different types of services, as per the procurement rules. However, in terms of the scope of work, what is perplexing me is how Grant Thornton can receive €4.2 million for the year up to March 2021, Deloitte can receive €4.2 million and KPMG can receive €3.1 million. These are astronomical figures. What I do not have sight of and the taxpayer-----
1351	SeanSherlock	Labour	17816.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-16 00:00:00	Business of Committee	125	 How many minutes do I have left?
1352	SeanSherlock	Labour	17816.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-16 00:00:00	Business of Committee	127	" What the taxpayer does not have sight of are the line-by-line accounting procedures in respect of how those hours are billed for. Please do not throw commercial sensitivity at me on this one because all of the consultancy houses have benefited remarkably from the provision of these services under presumably clear procurement rules. What we do not have sight of is how many people were seconded or deployed and how that is being managed internally by the HSE in terms of due diligence and managing the contracts and costs. There is no document anywhere I have sight of that shows me, or by extension, the taxpayer, the dynamics that informed those individual contracts in the public interest and in terms of protecting the ""public purse"", to quote Mr. Mulvany. This is an issue to which we need to return. We need more transparency."

1357	SeanSherlock	Labour	17823.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-23 00:00:00	Business of Committee	111	 I want to ask Mr. Reid if he is aware there is a proposal by the HSE to close the Owenacurra centre in Midleton, County Cork, where 19 residents will be rehoused across a number of other settings throughout the county and possibly beyond.
1358	SeanSherlock	Labour	17823.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-23 00:00:00	Business of Committee	113	 I have two points. First, we still do not have sight of what the costs of refurbishment would be. Second, it is our understanding that it is proposed to rehouse or rehome some people in institutional settings like St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire and also in St. Catherine's, and possibly on the site of St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork. If it is the case that the HSE is proposing to re-institutionalise people at a time when the HSE policy and Government policy is to decongregate, I think that would be taken very seriously. I ask that the HSE take another look at this decision on the basis that people are very concerned, given where it is proposed that people will be sent to, in that this further institutionalises them. All I am asking at this stage is that Mr. Reid take another look at this and run the rule over it, as chief executive officer. I will leave it there. SouthDoc is very important. During the pandemic, a number of cells were taken out of action, and that is the fact of the matter. Mitchelstown and Fermoy, as well as the Cork centres, were taken out. This meant that cars were going much further afield to cover off services on an out-of-hours basis. It meant that doctors were much more stretched, if they were doing home visits. Please do not tell us how the service works. We know how the service works. There is a fear that the €7.5 million of taxpayers’ investment in this service is not buying enough scrutiny of the service that is being provided, notwithstanding the fact it is a separate entity. There is a presence by the HSE on the board of SouthDoc. To my mind, that buys the taxpayer and the HSE greater scrutiny of how SouthDoc operates. On Deputy Colm Burke's point, which he ran out of time on, I share his view. More and more people are now going to Cork University Hospital, CUH, on an accident-and-emergency basis and bypassing SouthDoc because they do not feel confident that they will be seen at times by SouthDoc. We need to deal with perceptions in the public mind as to how SouthDoc operates. I am very familiar with the Mallow service and the Mitchelstown-Fermoy service. They are excellent services staffed by brilliant people. I could not say enough good things about them. However, we do not have a service in Youghal out of hours. Someone who phones from Youghal is expected to go to Midleton. That is a journey of about half an hour. The services at times are stretched between the Waterford border and the Kerry border. There needs to be a review of how SouthDoc operates. It is our view that the €7.5 million investment of taxpayers' money buys the HSE greater scrutiny to ensure that it is triaging and building out a public message in a way that ensures that if people can avoid the accident and emergency department in CUH and go through their local services, while those services are very good, there might need to be a greater degree of scrutiny or some sort of review as to how the services operate, particularly within the city. There needs to be a look back on why the Blackpool and Fermoy-Mitchelstown services were closed because the HSE took out a massive geographical area there. They were taken out during the pandemic. I ask - this is my only ask - that the HSE look back on how SouthDoc operated during the pandemic. A little report could be furnished to Members of the Oireachtas or there could be just a look back on the basis of what lessons can be learned, how the service, which is by and large an excellent service, can operate more efficiently and whether it can cover more sufficiently east Cork. I am convinced that it is not covering the Youghal area. It does not have sufficient resources to cover the Youghal area and ensure that people in Youghal or further afield are not forced to go to Midleton or onward to Cork, directly to an accident and emergency department.

1361	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	7	 I will start with the Dublin docklands SDZ. My understanding of this is that in 2014 NAMA adopted a secondary objective of the facilitation of the development of office accommodation in Dublin and had an interest in 17 ha of the 22 ha of the undeveloped land in the Dublin docklands SDZ. My understanding is that Mr. McDonagh's board approved a business plan for those sites in September 2014 and that there were no formal targets set out in that business plan. I also understand that by the end of 2018 construction was under way or had been completed on 70% of the land in which NAMA had an interest and that by May 2020 construction was under way or had been completed on sites accounting for 86% of the land in which NAMA had an interest. Regarding the commercial development of the Dublin docklands SDZ, can Mr. McDonagh confirm for me what percentage of the NAMA land has seen full construction to date?
1362	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	9	 May I hear Mr. McDonagh's understanding of the impact of Covid on commercial developments? We now know that more people will be working from home and that fewer people will be required to inhabit, if you will, commercial developments. Can Mr. McDonagh give me an insight into NAMA's thinking in respect of the future of commercial developments, such as the Dublin docklands SDZ in particular, in the context of the impact of Covid on commercial space into the future? What I am getting at is whether there will be a need to pivot back to residential. That is ultimately what I am trying to figure out.
1363	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	11	 We understand NAMA's remit and the legislation, but there is the potential for 3,500 residential units at the Poolbeg West site. That is clearly understood. We know that there is about 93,000 sq. m of commercial development. Will Mr. McDonagh talk me through where Poolbeg is at present? My questions are specific. Has a preferred bidder been identified for NAMA's venture partner in the old glass bottle site at Poolbeg West? At what stage of development is the Poolbeg West SDZ? What impact has Covid had on the development of Poolbeg? What impact, if any, have increased construction costs had on the budget for the development of Poolbeg West? On the 3,5000 residential units, it would be useful to have a breakdown or understanding of how that will be divided between social, affordable and commercial development. If social houses are to be developed on the site, what will the ownership structure of the land be? Will it be leased? Will it be used by approved housing agencies? I ask Mr. McDonagh to give a more in-depth analysis of the Poolbeg site.

1369	SeanSherlock	Labour	17837.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	354	 I thank the Chairman for facilitating me in this. I am very grateful. I wanted to understand better the relationship between An Taisce and various Departments and statutory funding bodies. We all understand, possibly on a superficial level, the work An Taisce does in respect of education. It is inherently good work, particularly when it comes to blue flag and green schools initiatives. It would be very useful for us to understand the financial relationship. We can bear in mind that between 2018 and 2019, there was a restatement of figures. I wish to understand that better and how the Department has dealt with that matter. I also would like to get an overview of the relationship that exists, including whether there are service level agreements in place. If there are, how do they operate? Do the line Departments that are funders, particularly in the context of restricted funds, have an expectation about the governance of any organisation that they may fund, even if it is a charitable organisation? I am seeking the support of the committee for us to write to the line Departments with a view to getting further information in order to better inform ourselves.

1375	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	98	 I welcome Mr. Gloster and his team to the committee. An article appeared on Monday, 27 September, in the Irish Examiner where Mr. Gloster spoke at length in respect of private provision of residential care. The article stated: Mr Gloster said that many private care placements were working well but added: “The bigger risk of that level of dependency on private care is private operators can leave the market; they can leave quickly, they can sell on; company structures can become very complex, and the reality is that if you have a private provider in a house with four young people, if that private provider left the market, the State has only one option and that is for us to take over that provision there”. Is there a shift in policy in Tusla such that it is going to wind down private care providers? Is that a signalling of a policy shift? What is the real-time position in respect of that? The witnesses might bear in mind that I have ten minutes and there are four questions I would like to ask.
1376	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	100	 I have a couple of questions following on from that. As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers. A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses. Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services. What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance? It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver. I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.

Tusla providers are inspected by HIQA but Tusla inspects the private providers on its list.
1378	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	104	 At what stage does Mr. Gloster anticipate there will be a change in that regime such that the private providers are inspected by HIQA?

It is about as frank as one can get. I hope the regime will change to reflect it. Historically, the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported significantly on the cost of the guardian ad litem service. We are all mindful that the Child and Family Agency is about providing care for children and ensuring, in a court hearing or any judicial process, that the voice of the child is heard. I am concerned about the costs of the guardian ad litem service. We had gone some way towards legislating for change in that area during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. What is the Child and Family Agency's understanding of the status of the draft heads of a Bill to make changes to the guardian ad litem service and what engagement has it had with the Department in that respect?

It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease."" Have all of those 70,000 referrals been expedited? Is Tusla on time and ahead of the curve in terms of all referrals that come to it in respect of any child or family?"

We will also forward it to the health committee and include the question from Deputy Carthy as to whether, in that committee's opinion, this committee is required to examine the matter further. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next business is the work programme. The Dáil is not scheduled to sit next week. That brings us to 4 November, when we are planning to engage with RTÉ on its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. A representative from the Department will be in attendance. When we agreed our work programme to the end of the year last week, I mentioned that we might need to reschedule some engagements depending on availability. The secretariat received a response from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to advise that it is scheduled for oral parliamentary questions on 11 November, which is the date on which we wanted departmental officials to attend. Representatives of the Department of Transport were scheduled for 25 November but have agreed to swap with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 11 November. The secretariat has requested that the officials from the Department of Transport make available to the committee the information we have requested on MetroLink, BusConnects, the DART and the strategic rail fleet review no later than 5 November, to ensure we have it before the meeting on 11 November. I note that there is information flagged up regarding the search and rescue service, which is included in the invitation to the meeting. Accordingly, the schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: 4 November, Exchequer funding of RTÉ; 11 November, Department of Transport; 18 November, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; 25 November, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; 2 December, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; 9 December, Department of Social Protection; and 16 December, Department of Health. At our meeting last week, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November or early December. I suggest that we do so at the end of November rather than letting it go on too long. The list of engagements to the end of the year has been circulated. Does any member wish to raise any other matter relating to the work programme? As no matters have been raised, that concludes our consideration of the work programme. Finally, under any other business, I note that we have work to do on a number of reports, which we will discuss in private session. Do members want to raise any other issues? As there are no other matters to discuss, we will, as agreed, go into private session, after which we will adjourn until 4 November, when we will engage with representatives of RTÉ on Exchequer funding.

1387	SeanSherlock	Labour	17872.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-11 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	46	" I would like to echo Deputy McAuliffe’s comments in seeking to request that the NTA would come before us. It would be vital, if at all possible, that we would hear from it on this issue. I will be brief. As is usual on a Thursday there are sometimes conflicting diary requirements. I want to seek reassurances in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s special report 113 on procurement to vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard, that there is a clear matching up between the four recommendations that are aimed at strengthening. I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report that they are aimed, “at strengthening the Department’s procurement procedures for the future”. Can we be assured of the following for each of the recommendations for the strategic plan for equipment requirement: that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements should be based on formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department would carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes? I want a short reassurance from the Secretary General that that is all now under way. The Secretary General states that the Department has strengthened its analytical tools for procurement analysis. I remain to be assured that we have a robust and fit-for-purpose system. Can the Secretary General give us those assurances? That is my first question. I will ask three questions specifically and then I will take my leave. The second question is about national secondary routes. Major construction projects begun in 2020 are under way. I believe strongly that there is a need for a policy intervention by the Department in respect of those national secondary routes that are in a deplorable state, such as the N73, in such a way that would ensure that TII, funds projects like that relating to the Mallow to Mitchelstown road. The latter is, arguably, one of the worst national secondary routes in the country, even though it is a vital artery for commercial and domestic traffic in the north Cork area and a vital route between Kerry and Dublin. I continue to make the case for funding for this road. I ask that the N73 project remain on the agenda, and I make no bones about raising the matter at this forum. On the Leap card, the Secretary General informed us that ""Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable."" I am seeking to expand Leap card services in my county of Cork, specifically on routes between Mallow and Cork, where there a massive number of commuters on a daily basis and where there is still not a Leap card service, even though it could be argued that it is a viable route. I can travel from Bray to Pearse Station using a Leap card, but I cannot go from Mallow to Cork. There is an inequality between services on the eastern seaboard and those in the regions. I ask that, as a policy, the Department looks at the roll-out of Leap card services for the towns that service big cities, such as Cork. It is vitally important."

The meeting schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, 18 November; Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, 25 November; Revenue Commissioners, 2 December; Department of Social Protection, 9 December; and Department of Health, 16 December. We agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year later this month. As nobody wishes to raise anything related to the work programme, that concludes our consideration of same. Does any member wish to raise any other matter before we go into private session? No. As agreed, we will now go into private session. At our next meeting on 18 November, we will engage with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

It is nice to see some familiar faces from my old Department. I am delighted to have the opportunity to pose some questions. I will stay on the Covid-19 restart grant schemes. In that context, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated: A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls. One of these is the completion of post payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received. The Secretary General stated: ""I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched"". We have to try to reconcile the two. It would be useful to articulate in concise terms how the Department intends to answer the questions posed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is widely acknowledged that money flowed into businesses quickly and it was a responsive scheme in that regard. However, questions have been posed and it would be useful to understand the timelines for any review or what such a review would look like."

I thank the Secretary General for that. Will she give a timeline for the conclusion of the review? She has hired outside consultants. When will that look-back be completed?

The expenditure on the innovation programme for 2020 was €414 million. A total of €332 million was spent on the science and technology development programme. Will there be a Science Foundation Ireland call for further centres to be established in the near future? I request a simple ""Yes"" or ""No""."

No. 879C is correspondence I submitted to the committee on 9 November 2021 requesting the committee to make inquiries with IDA Ireland arising from HSE correspondence regarding the procurement of ventilators from China. Obviously, that is self-explanatory. I again ask the committee to agree to make those inquiries. Is that agreed? Agreed. No. 881C is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 9 November 2021. It requests an update on the implementation of the recommendations in our report regarding the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 110 - Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme), which was published in January. One of the recommendations was that the value for money review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme be published without delay. It was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019. Over two and a half years later it has still not been published. We looked for an update on this review and on the report concerning the costs and timeline for the national children's hospital from the Department on 18 October and issued a reminder earlier this month but have not yet received a response. It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence. We could hold it over. That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it. If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year. We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November. It is suggested that we do so next week. Is that agreed? Agreed. Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan? We will be coming back to it next week anyway. Is there any other business? I take it there is not. We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.

1399	SeanSherlock	Labour	17886.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-25 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	14	 I thank the Secretary General and her colleagues for appearing before the committee. I wish to focus in the first instance on cultural institutions, programme B, specifically subheads B1 through to B15, of the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media Vote. The entire budget of the Department is rapidly nudging up to €1 billion. As a result, I assume that will give rise to many new challenges. Under the Project 2040 national development plan, NDP, there is €460 million allocated to the national cultural institutions investment programme. The projects incorporated into that programme include the conversion of the Bishop Street warehouse into a secure, environmentally controlled archival repository for the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland redevelopment, the development of the Crawford Art Gallery in my native Cork and the proposal to renovate the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the Chester Beatty Library. The National Museum of Ireland is preparing a design procurement of the history of Ireland galleries. All are laudable projects and are to be supported. However, they will all bring challenges for the Department. The big shift in the spending capacity of the Department in respect of these cultural institutions under the NDP gives rise to a number of specific questions. First, what expertise and systems have increased at Department level to ensure the efficient disbursement of funding for approved capital development projects?
1400	SeanSherlock	Labour	17886.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-25 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	16	 If I may, I have further specific questions that may assist the process before Ms Licken defers to her colleague.
1401	SeanSherlock	Labour	17886.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-25 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	18	 They are very specific questions. First, who will be responsible for procurement and project management for the capital development projects in the cultural institutions? What is the precise role of the Department, the cultural institution and, where applicable, the OPW in this? Who ultimately manages those relationships? Who undertakes the procurement and daily project oversight? Who signs off on procurement and spending, the Department or the cultural institution? If overspends occur and if the Legislature, through this committee, needs to interrogate certain issues, who will appear before this committee? Looking at the projects I referred to, it is statistically possible there might be issues that may arise in respect of overspends and public procurement that may give rise to questions that have to be answered. If overspends occur, who would appear before this committee? Would it be the Secretary General and her Department or the cultural institution? Furthermore, what additional resources and expertise have been made available to the cultural institutions to deal with this increased oversight and workload? That is just one parcel of questions. There are further questions on this issue.

The context in which I ask these questions is that I worry that the voluntary boards of the institutions that are earmarked for capital development projects, notwithstanding their expertise on cultural and governance matters, might not have expertise on procurement matters. With this money coming down the track to these laudable projects, I worry that there might not be the capacity within the institutions to be able to have that expertise. I am trying to tease out whether it is the intention of the Department to buttress those institutions with additional skill sets as befit the specific project as it arises. The Secretary General said a dedicated team has been established comprising economists. I would like to be assured whether there are teams of procurement specialists and governance specialists being readied for the delivery of these projects. There is a gap there and it is giving rise to concern. I do not feel assured by the answers so far, if I may say that.

We will examine the matter further as time goes on. I thank the witnesses for that. I want to move on to a quite bespoke issue, namely, that of storage within the cultural institutions. My understanding is that there is a storage facility for the National Museum which is housed in Swords. The National Museum of Ireland's collections resource centre in Swords houses 4 million objects. This is an extraordinary figure. What does the future hold for the storage of the key objects in our national collections, regardless of the institution? I understand that, in the case of the National Museum of Ireland, there are only eight years remaining on the existing lease and that a rent review that was due in September 2020 has still not been concluded. If we are seeking to animate any of the projects I outlined, we will have to decant many of the artefacts or pieces, be they artistic or otherwise, to other sites. How are the witnesses dealing with the issue of the storage of these precious items within our national collections, specifically in the National Museum of Ireland? What are the witnesses doing to ensure there is a sustainable storage facility for the National Museum of Ireland and other cultural institutions?

I have 40 seconds left in my slot so I ask Mr. Falvey not to tick down the clock on me. I would like a very specific answer in the 30 seconds I have left.

I asked a specific question about rent reviews. What was the outcome of the rent review? Can the witnesses assure this committee and the people of Ireland that there will be, from 2030 onwards, a fit-for-purpose, modern storage facility for any collection within the national collection, be it art or the remains of an Irish elk, for instance?

I might have a different view to Deputy McAuliffe on the amount of content that people in the regions perceive that is attributed to Dublin. I will begin by saying ""well done"" to RTÉ on its latest partnership with Virgin Media Television in respect of the Six Nations Championship. That is a wonderful example of collaboration. Speaking as a proud Munster man and a Munster rugby supporter, I also commend RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector on the provision of United Rugby Championship, URC, output. I strongly believe that model has provided excellent content for the average punter sitting at home who wants to view rugby or sporting output at the highest level through the terrestrial channels. The URC is a great example of where the licence payer sees the best of the utilisation of that fund. Are there plans to expand that further? Can we expect to see more of that? Does the director general perceive that RTÉ will do more collaborations of that nature and exploit further opportunities so that more and more people can enjoy - because that is what it is about - the output that is coming through collaborations of that nature?"
1418	SeanSherlock	Labour	17942.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-20 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	192	 Is there anything in the pipeline at present that Ms Forbes can tell us about in respect of that collaborative model? She spoke about the diversification of sport and, specifically, gender, which is absolutely vital, but what is in pipeline that will embed that model further? From the ordinary punter's point of view, and I am an ordinary punter in this regard, when I look at the URC coverage I see the best of RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector collaborating. Looking at the Irish Examiner model of delivering sport at the most local level through a streaming package, I can tune in to my local team at a county final from the comfort of my living room. Should we go down to that level of granularity? Should the national broadcaster be getting on that wagon to see where the opportunities lie to further embed itself into that collaborative model so that there is more output and RTÉ is taking feeds from a more diverse range of venues across a more diverse range of sports? The technology allows us to do that now. Presumably, RTÉ does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that. I would love to see more of that from our national broadcaster: more localised, more regionalised and more diverse output. If Ms Forbes can tell me it is now part of a policy in RTÉ to continue with that, it will give many people a lot of confidence.
1419	SeanSherlock	Labour	17942.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-20 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	194	 I thank Ms Forbes. I will move on to the independent sector. My understanding is that there is a statutory requirement for RTÉ to spend in respect of it. For instance, in 2020, the statutory requirement was to spend approximately €40.2 million - Ms Forbes might correct me if that is wrong. My understanding is that RTÉ spent approximately €36.5 million, which is about €3.7 million under target. I understand that the Covid pandemic was a deciding factor in that because of cancelled productions and so on, but the underspend is then required to be spent within two years. Will Ms Forbes elaborate, or educate us, on how RTÉ plans to spend that underspend? Again, I speak specifically for the independent sector, which is starved of funding at present, has plans afoot to deliver content and is anxious to get going again.

I welcome and acknowledge the fact that the Department has corresponded with us in respect of An Taisce. However, I am a little confused about questions Nos. 3 and 4, specifically the reply to question No. 4, which states: On 5th August 2021, An Taisce responded to the Department's letter noting the concerns expressed therein and confirming that they are ""fully in compliance with the DPER circular 13/2014."" That still does not answer the question about the issue of restricted funds and whether or not the Department is fully satisfied that there should have been, within the final accounts, specific reference to Circular 13/2014 and those same restricted funds. I am wondering if, with the agreement of my colleagues and the Chairman, we can ask the Department for further clarification on questions Nos. 3 and 4 and whether there is an obligation for specific reference to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014. We should ask how the Department has asked questions and satisfied itself that An Taisce is fully compliant with that circular. It seems that the Department has merely said it accepts the response from An Taisce. That is my interpretation and I am open to correction on that and to guidance from the Chairman. I would like to interrogate that further to satisfy my mind."

The Secretary General stated: there are robust arrangements in place to monitor funding from the Department to An Taisce and to ensure that such funding is in compliance with the conditions of Circular 13/2014. This includes service level agreements, ongoing engagement, reporting and vouched expenditure. I am still not satisfied that the 2019 accounts were as they should have been. If the Secretary General comes back to us and states the Department is absolutely satisfied it has done everything, then fair enough, but I would like to pursue the issue a little further, if I may.

1439	SeanSherlock	Labour	17949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-27 00:00:00	National Transport Authority: Financial Statements 2020	407	 I thank the Chair. I apologise profusely for missing the entirety of the meeting thus far but that was unavoidable. I apologise also if some of my questions have been asked and answered. If they have, that is fine. I can take the answers from the record afterwards. I want to talk about the Cork-Dublin line. There was an announcement of approximately €91 million, as I understand it, for the upgrading of that line to ensure that the speed at which commuters could travel between Cork and Dublin and vice versa is speeded up. I want to get a deeper understanding of where that spend is going and how it is proposed to spend the moneys. I understand that signalling upgrades are a component part of that, and possibly new intercity railcars, ICRs. I could be wrong but Ms Graham will clarify that for me. The reason I ask is because, while I am a weekly traveller on the Cork to Dublin line and I am a regular DART user, I wonder whether the Mark 4 engines are fit for purpose in a modern railway infrastructure and whether there is a proposal to replace those with more energy-efficient carriages and train sets. Where is the NTA in terms of that conversation with Irish Rail? That is my first question.
1440	SeanSherlock	Labour	17949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-27 00:00:00	National Transport Authority: Financial Statements 2020	409	 I thank Ms Graham. The other issue relates to correspondence that we would have received in relation to bus shelters. People may ask why am I asking a question about bus shelters. Bus shelters are important to people who do not have their own transport, particularly if they live in intermediate towns. For instance, if you are living between Cork and Limerick in a town such as Buttevant, which has been waiting for a bus shelter for a number of years, it is entirely appropriate for me to ask where the NTA is in terms of the provision of such shelters and why they are not being rolled out at a quicker pace to ensure that we encourage more people to use public transport.
1441	SeanSherlock	Labour	17949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-27 00:00:00	National Transport Authority: Financial Statements 2020	412	 I thank Mr. Creegan. I appreciate the answer. I used Buttevant as one example and I am unashamedly parochial in this sense. Buttevant is an example of where infrastructure is not being rolled out in towns and villages that depend on intercity routes. If some attention could be given specifically to Buttevant, I would be very grateful for that. My final question relates to fare structures. I have a mountain of correspondence with the NTA in respect of fare structures between Mallow and Cork. Mallow is a typical example of a town that is within commuting distance of a big city and where I perceive that there is an inequality as between the commuter who commutes to Cork from Mallow and the person who travels, for instance, from Greystones to Pearse Station in terms of fare structures. I note and welcome the correspondence that I have received from the NTA in relation to the introduction of commuter fares. I wish to raise the issue of commuter fares because there are thousands upon thousands of people who will make the modal shift from car to train if the fare structures are right throughout the country. Mallow is a typical example of that. The sooner we get those new fare structures this year, the better. Overnight, you will see a demand for those services among students, workers and citizens in general. That is why I asked the question about the Cork-Dublin upgrades in relation to speed. If we can get more rolling stock on those lines between Cobh, Midleton, Cork, Mallow and Charleville, for instance, and open up new intermediate stations as well, you will create demand. Quite frankly, that is where the Minister is at. That is where the citizens are at. The more the NTA can influence that and bring that about, the more positive the impact it will have for citizens. If there is a confirmation of the fact that commuter fares will be introduced, as per the NTA's correspondence to me already, I would welcome that. That is my final question.

1449	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	211	 I welcome the refreshingly honest answers to the questions we are posing, even if they are not necessarily the answers we want to receive. I will continue in the vein of asking very straight questions. I will start by asking about the N73, especially the stretch between Mitchelstown and Mallow. Has Mr. Walsh ever travelled that road?
1450	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	213	 May I cordially invite Mr. Walsh to travel that road as soon as he possibly can? It is only then that he would realise just how awful a stretch of road it is. It is arguably one of the worst national secondary routes in the country. Be that as it may, I welcome that there is an allocation in respect of Annakisha South, Clogher Cross and Waterdyke. I am disappointed, however, that the parcel for 2022 is only €900,000. I am seeking reassurances that a notification will be sent by TII to Cork County Council to give formal notice that Cork County Council can move to go to tender on that project. Is that the case?
1451	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	215	 Has formal notification been issued to Cork County Council?
1452	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	217	 Mr. Walsh will appreciate the point I am making. If TII is only allocating €900,000 this year out of a budget line of approximately €10 million, the fear is that Cork County Council will get stuck in the gap.
1453	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	219	 Let me just finish the point, which I am making in good faith and respectfully. If Cork County Council gets stuck in the gap, having spent €900,000, but cannot go to tender, it cannot proceed to spend up to the figure of €10 million. I am seeking a commitment that following 2022, we will see the tender issued, boots on the ground, a shovel-ready project and that TII is proceeding with the commitment. That is what I am seeking here.
1454	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	221	 Let me reiterate that. TII is issuing the notice to Cork County Council to go to tender and there will be a budget line for 2022 to 2024 that will absolutely deliver that project.
1455	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	223	 I thank Mr. Walsh. He could not be any clearer than that, which I appreciate. That gives us great hope. I refer again to the N73 and other such projects. Has TII given consideration to the budget line for major schemes in relation to County Cork? For instance, the Ballyvourney to Macroom project is coming in this year at approximately €60 million, or €61 million if one wants to round it up. The perception held by people like me is that the effect of all of the moneys going into the Dunkettles and Macroom bypasses of this world, which are the subject of national priority, is to suck the marrow out of the bone for other smaller projects. I acknowledge that they are smaller roads and lesser priorities, but this means that people like me are fighting on our backs for projects that are in abeyance for five, ten, 15 or 20 years. Is it not incongruous that, if a road is a national priority under a national development plan and so on and it is politically prioritised at Government level, it should have a negative bearing on a local authority's ability, in partnership with TII, to deliver on national secondary routes, tertiary routes and so forth? Does Mr. Walsh believe that there should be a rebalancing of priorities so that Exchequer funding for national secondary routes, which are usually the main routes serving counties, do not get caught up in a Samson versus Goliath struggle where, for example, the N73 is completing with the Macroom bypass?
1456	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	225	 The perception is that the rest of the county is paying for these projects.
1457	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	227	 That is the perception.
1458	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	229	 Fair enough. I will move on. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made mention of the efficacy of relief roads. I hail from the great town of Mallow. There is a budget allocation of €900,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is welcome and we are delighted. It has been a long-running campaign, as has the N73 campaign. These are decades-old campaigns. What will the €900,000 that TII has allocated for the Mallow relief road get us? Once spent, will it buy a further commitment that the relief road will actually be delivered? This is a bit like my N73.
1459	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	231	 I thank Mr. Walsh for his response. I welcome the commitment he has given on the N73. It gives me some hope, but we will have to keep an eye on it.
1460	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	233	 If he could please give me a commitment that he will travel that road himself-----
1461	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	235	 Doing that will absolutely and utterly change Mr. Walsh's perception or give him first-hand knowledge of just how bad that road is. I hope it might cause the situation to move more rapidly.
1462	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	237	 No, but Mr. Walsh is the chief executive and he carries a great deal of influence.
1463	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	535	 I raised a matter with the Department at our meeting. I am still trying to understand what the future of arts and antiquities storage will look like for the State. We were given chapter and verse on the current regime in north County Dublin, but what I am failing to understand is where future-proofing is taking place, given the involvement of local authorities, local museums, national museums, national collections and so on. Is there anything in the language of the letter that gives us, as per our questions, comfort in respect of the future-proofing of what I euphemistically call the national collection, be that arts and antiquities, statues or anything else? I am not sure that we have been given the answer, but I remain-----
1464	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	537	 As the Chairman can tell, I am asking his advice and I thank him for that, but how would it be articulated in practical terms short of bringing someone back to the committee? I presume it would be done via further correspondence from this committee to the line Department.
1465	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	539	 I am in the late fossilised stage myself now.
1466	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	541	 I thank the Chairman.
1467	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	543	 We can anticipate that there will be an exponential increase in the types of works. New technologies are constantly emerging, which may necessitate the need for a permanent and fixed venue or venues, but we do not have a permanent and fixed venue now. It is on a leasehold basis. I will take advice from the Chairman and the secretariat, as I wish to pursue this matter further. Forgive me if I am slightly ignorant of the facts in this case, but what does a sustainable stand-alone site that is in the ownership of the State and is future-proofed and cost effective look like?
1468	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	554	 I raised the issue in the context of seeking to understand how each of the line Departments operates its relationship with An Taisce. I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week. I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce. When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts. An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward. That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body. That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification. Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding. That provides one with a degree of confidence. In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement. The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----
1469	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	556	 -----and allocating it to An Taisce, which I understand is essentially a membership organisation. When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them. I just wanted to seek clarity on that. Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts. I am not a financial or management accountant. If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation? In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds? That is just a curiosity of mine. The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation. Hopefully, that can be clarified for me. It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified. Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that. It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes. It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level. It is important that we preserve that and protect it in every way that we can. It does a vital piece of work. However, at the same time, I imagine that we should satisfy ourselves that everything that is being done is absolutely with financial probity in mind.

1471	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	572	 I have no political agenda to undermine any organisation. I feel I have to put that on the record. Clean Coasts Ballynamona is in my constituency. I raised many a green flag myself when I was a Minister of State. The Chairman will know from the tone of the language of my questioning that it was not with a view to seeking to undermine any organisation. I stated very clearly on the record the great work that An Taisce does in respect of the delivery of the programme but since I am not a financial or forensic accountant, I have to rely on the guidance we receive from the secretariat and the correspondence we receive from the Departments. We are fully entitled, as I understand it, to ask a question of any organisation. I am merely posing the questions and am entitled to do that.
1472	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	574	 However, I do not want it inferred that, because I have asked the question, there is a certain political motivation. I take grave exception to that. It is wrong that it should be inferred from my questioning; it is unfair. I feel aggrieved by the fact that I would be impugned in that way consequent to my line of questioning. My question was asked with a view to seeking clarification.
1473	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	576	 Absolutely not.

I do not see how the Deputy is loading the basis by asking that question. It is merely with the purpose of finding fact. For that word to be weaponised now, in some fashion, I think is quite patently wrong. It does me a disservice when all I am seeking to do is find facts.

I will return to it soon, given it will not take very long if we allow it to happen. There was a suggestion that we would have two meetings but that would add a further complication. I ask members to bear with me while we nail this down conclusively. I qualify this by saying that, if we decide to take 10 March as the meeting on mental health and if we accept the Deputy's suggestion to hold a further meeting on 24 March, that will push other issues a week or two down the road. I reiterate what has been agreed. Last week, we agreed we would schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick, UL, and include in our invitation a request that the chancellor, Mary Harney, would attend, given the nature of her position and the duration of her tenure, along with the president, who is the accountable person. That is on 7 April. UL's financial statements for the year 2019-20 should be available to us at that point. In accordance with our work programme, we would then engage with the Department of Finance on 14 April and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the Easter break, on 5 March. I ask members to agree to that on the basis that we will sort out later what we will do about the meeting on mental health, that is, whether we should introduce it for the meeting of 10 March or whether we should schedule a double meeting for 10 and 24 March. I am not asking members to agree on the exact dates but rather I propose we take them in that order, subject to sorting out of the business of the mental health issues. Is that agreed? Agreed. I propose we go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 10 February, when we will engage with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of expenditure on the national broadband plan.

In accordance with our work programme, we would then engage with the Department of Finance on 14 April and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the Easter break, on 5 March. I ask members to agree to that on the basis that we will sort out later what we will do about the meeting on mental health, that is, whether we should introduce it for the meeting of 10 March or whether we should schedule a double meeting for 10 and 24 March. I am not asking members to agree on the exact dates but rather I propose we take them in that order, subject to sorting out of the business of the mental health issues. Is that agreed? Agreed. I propose we go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 10 February, when we will engage with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of expenditure on the national broadband plan.

1503	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	139	 The articulation of all of this for Deputies like me, who represent both urban and rural constituencies, is that we have villages and townlands that are being split down the middle. The only way I can articulate my point is by giving a practical example and that is the village of Ballyhooly, in north County Cork. Typical of every small village throughout the country, it is quite literally being split down the middle in that part of it is to be provided with broadband through the national broadband plan and the other part is to be provided for by the market. In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard. While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages. It is extremely frustrating. Can Mr. Hendrick provide any reassurance to public representatives like me that people in Ballyhooly and every village like it throughout the country who want to get connected and have a right to be connected will be guaranteed access, that they will not be denied access in the times we live in?
1504	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	141	" I appreciate and understand all of that. When the national broadband plan was rolled out there was an expectation - Mr. Hendrick can tell me if it is not a legitimate expectation - that there would be a more timely intervention in those areas where there are serious gaps. I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type. There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability. Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product. Is NBI guaranteeing those speeds or is it, as set out in the small print, ""up to"" those speeds. There is a big difference between ""up to 1G"" and actually guaranteeing 1G. The term ""up to"" could mean anything up to that level. Those are the issues that we are trying to deal with here and that, as public representatives, we are trying to navigate. We are quite literally reflecting back to NBI what we are hearing on the ground from countless numbers of citizens in the types of villages mentioned, who are deeply frustrated that there is no intervention that appears to be serving them. Mr. Hendrick is telling me about something that is going to happen in the future, the future is now as far as those people are concerned. The pandemic has fast-tracked remote working and they want results now. What can I tell the people of Ballyhooly arising from my engagement with the witnesses today that would give them some hope that there will be an intervention to meet their needs and they will get a service?"

1506	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	707	 It is a nice segue that we are talking about the reliance on external advice. If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan. I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services. The figure I got back was €14.3 million, of which €10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project. If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received €3.9 million, EY business advisory services received €5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received €846,000. That adds up to approximately €10.1 million. Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned? The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice. None of us are against the idea of external advice. It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered. That is understood. However, €10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure. What were EY's business advisory services, for example? The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to €5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money. Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours? What is the Department getting for €5.3 million? What is it getting from Analysys Mason for €3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for €846,000 so far? That is only for 2021. It would be very useful if this committee had a further understanding of just how much money is being spent on consultancy services, not only for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - officials from that Department are here today - but for every Department of State, for that matter.

What I would like is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of these costs. We need that for every single line Department that relies on external services and consultancy. I am not sure we have a deep understanding of that. Certainly, I speak for myself in that regard. The question then, and Mr. Griffin can fold this all into the reply in two minutes, is do I take it from his reply that the Department will continue to require the services of external consultants for this? If the answer to that is ""Yes"", which I think it is, for how long more will it require them? It has spent €10.1 million so far. What does Mr. Griffin anticipate the future spend will be on external services for the lifetime of this project?"

I think we all appreciate that there is a reliance on external services. We have all acknowledged that. I am merely asking at this juncture - I think Mr. Griffin was about to defer to his colleagues on the matter - about the breakdown of costs and to have sight of the breakdown of those costs. If I could come away in the short time I have with some understanding of that and a commitment that the Department will write to the committee in that regard, I would be grateful for that.

1512	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	883	 With respect, Mr. Mulligan should understand that we are at the front line in understanding people's needs. We are the people who run constituency offices. We understand full well the significance of the NBP. We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service. I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it. I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI. I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved. I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made. Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out. The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation. I think we would all agree on that point. Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one. I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely. Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions. I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood. They need the access; that is the bottom line. They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation. If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that. Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go. They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at nbi.ie and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable. The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately. That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard. I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are. I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household. I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place. That is where people like are coming from, quite simply. We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made. We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions. My second point relates to the BCPs. How many BCPs are up and running and live as we speak?

I would like Mr. Griffin to go away from this meeting understanding that there is a little village in north County Cork called Ballyhooly, and I deliberately use the example of Ballyhooly because he will remember that name. There is a new estate in Ballyhooly called Lios Ard, peopled by the professionals I am talking about from all walks of life, and one half of the village can get broadband and the half other cannot. This is why I am frustrated by this amber mapping. We all bought into it and now it seems that this amber map has become such an arbitrary tool that we are going to end up with a situation where there will be those people who will have and those who will not all because of a mapping exercise, ultimately. I do not know what can be done about that. The question is: what can I tell the people in Lios Ard, Ballyhooly, tomorrow morning? They are representative of thousands of people throughout this State. What hope can I give them tomorrow morning that they are going to be guaranteed a connection? That is the bottom line. That is ultimately what people want to hear.

I understand there are a set of regulations going back to 2019 relating to standards in private rented accommodation, which are very clearly delineated. I am struck by the fact, notwithstanding Covid-19 and the inability of people to inspect private rented accommodation that is subject to housing assistance payments, or even the rental accommodation scheme as we used to know it, of the dramatic drop-off in the number of inspections taking place. The Minister's response to a parliamentary question I posed on 25 January clearly shows that up to quarter 3 of 2021, 11,731 inspections took place. Those are the most up-to-date figures I have. There may have been an advance on that since then.
1528	SeanSherlock	Labour	17970.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-17 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	58	 It was 2021. We are factoring in Covid-19. We know there will be a drop-off so the officials do not need to respond to that. That is a given and that is understood, but the number of prohibition notices that have been served out of those inspections is 15. Even if we track back, taking into account Covid-19, in 2018, approximately 28,000 inspections were carried out with 99 prohibition notices served. In 2019, 40,000 inspections were carried out with 106 notices served. In 2020, approximately 26,000 inspections were carried out with 57 notices served and, as I said, there were 11,700 inspections up to quarter 3 of 2021 with 15 notices served. Do the officials agree that the number of prohibition notices served is extremely low? I ask that because I have visited people of late who are in receipt of the housing assistance payment. To describe the conditions they are living in as Dickensian would be to put it mildly. I understand the local authorities have a tough job to do, but I would like to see some language coming from the Department in respect of buttressing the inspections regime by way of ensuring there is a clear policy that the regulations, which are laid down in law, are adhered to such that people have the right to live in some sort of decent accommodation. I invite the officials to visit some of these dwellings for themselves. They will see just how poor the level of accommodation is. These people are caught in a major bind because they cannot go back to their landlord to ask him or her to fix this or that as they would be out on their ear before they know it. This is a major issue right across society when we are paying €465 million on the housing assistance payment. We should look at the rent supplement figure from the Department of Social Protection for 2021. Under what we call provisional expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme 2021, the Department of Social Protection paid out €122,957,000 in rent supplement. We are paying out a massive amount of money. I can understand why we are doing so. We need to keep people in housing in the private rented sector until supply is sufficiently provided for, but the inspection regime is just not working. I ask the officials to please not come back to me with Covid-19 as a reason. A regime needs to be put in place such that the inspectorate is robust and local authorities are resourced commensurate with the number of properties in their purview. That is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us the metric of 60,000 tenancies and €465 million, which is coming in at, give or take, €7,800 per tenancy. Obviously, there has been no provision to revise upwards the rent provision to reflect the market in 2017. The Secretary General will tell me there is a working group on that but there needs to be a greater degree of urgency. If I could have an answer to that in two minutes or less, I would be delighted because there is one other issue I would like to cover as well.

I appreciate the answer. With regard to water services, as a typical Deputy trying to get schemes up off the ground in regard to wastewater treatment plants and sewage treatment plants, and generally improve the condition of services, in particular water services, I recognise that some very good projects are under way right across the country under the ambit of Irish Water. However, I am trying to understand what is the dynamic that is informing the relationship between Irish Water and the local authorities. Is it the case that the service level agreements that are in place between the two entities will be set aside, such that all staff are now to transfer across to Irish Water? If that is the case, what is the status of that process? That is the first question. The second question relates to whether a scheme will be provided where there are small settlements or villages where the local authority is ready to go on a project, but it is not necessarily on a priority list for Irish Water. Is there scope for the Department to step in to provide funding for local authorities for smaller schemes that are shovel-ready and that could get off the ground? It would have tremendous impact. If we do not have those types of schemes, people are subjected to an Irish Water list and they could be waiting until kingdom come to get their little village or settlement sorted out.

We discussed engaging with the Policing Authority as well, so I propose that the secretariat seek to schedule the Policing Authority on the afternoon of 31 March, the same date on which we will be engaging with An Garda Síochána. Is that agreed? Agreed. Alternatively, we could schedule it for 7 April. There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter which means the next meeting will be on 28 April, with the Department of Justice. There will be a run of justice issues together. We will then look to engage with the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the University of Limerick. I know the committee is anxious to get the university back before us. Fairly early on, we may look to ascertain the availability of the chancellor. We should do that in good time. Is it agreed that the secretariat will work to make these arrangements? Agreed. Are there any other matters members wish to raise relating to the work programme? That concludes consideration of the work programme for today. The last item is any other business. Apologies were received from Deputy Verona Murphy. Unfortunately, she had a bereavement in the family. I convey the condolences of the committee and the staff to Verona on the loss of her mother. I know she had been ill in recent weeks. We pass on our sympathies to Verona. The meeting is adjourned until 24 February, when we will engage with the Residential Tenancies Board on its 2020 financial statements.

1541	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	47	 To continue on a similar vein to the Chairman, in respect of HSE national service plan and its relationship with the health Vote, is Mr. Reid aware of the report commissioned by the Parliamentary Budget Office?
1542	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	49	 Mr. Reid will be aware that the report states, “The programming of expenditure under the Health Vote was another priority of Future Health and aligning the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE’s internal allocations would make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more direct.” The key words there are “what the Oireachtas approves”. We are elected by the people and we approve the expenditure, and the HSE spends the money and has that relationship with the Department of Health and the line Minister of the day. Ultimately, there is an accountability mechanism here. The Comptroller and Auditor General holds a constitutional position. If he is making reference in his opening remarks to that specific report, that report has to be taken seriously by the HSE. It is important. Let us not make light of it. It is a vital transparency mechanism.
1543	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	51	 On the accountability mechanism, consider what happens when a mere mortal like me, who represents the people of Cork East, submits a parliamentary question on CAMHS, as I did in January when I sought information on the number of persons waiting to be seen by CAMHS by local health office, in tabular form, and the length of time persons were waiting to be seen. It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan. The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357. When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone. If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting. For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4. What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas. When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations. I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard. It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly. If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach? In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families. We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed. From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done. How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?
1544	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	54	 I accept the response and the distinction Ms O'Connor is making, but the universal and most important point is that we still have 3,000 children waiting. What is the current status of the children's disability network teams?
1545	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	56	 Does Ms O'Connor consider them to be working?
1546	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	58	 Is Ms O'Connor aware that parents are coming to Members of the Oireachtas saying they feel like they are now going through another process of incessant form-filling and that the services are moving further and further away from them? Again, it is almost Kafkaesque that they are in this vortex of constant form-filling. They feel extremely frustrated. Can Ms O'Connor sympathise and empathise with their experience of children's disability network teams so far?
1547	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	60	" Absolutely. I am not a specialist in this field so I rely on the information being imparted to me by the HSE. Would person-to-person intervention not have been the starting point anyway as opposed to sending people into an assessment process that some families describe as nightmarish? I am going to leave it at that because I have three minutes left in my slot. I ask our guests to have regard to that and to be conscious of the points we are making as we reflect them for our constituents. What is the status of the Owenacurra Centre? I am told it is an approved centre. Will our guests explain what, in HSE speak, an ""approved centre"" is?"
1548	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	63	" The Mental Health Commission is clear in its definition. It states an approved centre is intended ""to provide in-patient treatment to people suffering from mental illness. The MHC maintains a register of all approved centres."" The chief executive stated the HSE is going to move to close the Owenacurra Centre. Will Mr. Reid reconsider that position? I am not convinced, and I imagine I speak comfortably for all the Members of the Oireachtas who represent the Cork East constituency, there is a proper, fit-for-purpose local alternative solution to respond to the centre’s closure. Mr. Reid made reference in his opening remarks to Glenwood, but from what I can see in the planning application, that is not to be designated as an approved centre. In fact, there was no mention of the fact it would become an approved centre. Right now, there are 11 people who do not know where they are supposed to go, yet they have expressed a clear will and preference. Mr. Reid used the expression ""will and preference"". I would contend that as long as they continue to express a will and preference to stay at the Owenacurra Centre, they should be allowed to do so for as long as is necessary, in accordance with their will and preference. I do not believe our guests have presented to us a fit-for-purpose and local alternative for them. Sending them 30 km up the road is not a solution. That is not how we treat people in this day and age. If they continue to express a will and preference not to move, that must be respected. Furthermore, the moneys the HSE has spent on improving the Owenacurra Centre have to be taken into account. I understand more than €359,000 has been spent there since 2016. There is no alternative for the residents at present. Our guests have presented the Carrigaline centre as an alternative, but it is not an approved centre. The residents – 11 souls - are almost being cast out. I ask Mr. Reid to please reconsider and to have a bit of heart in respect of these people."

The request can be made. That can be done but, certainly, there can be no means of compelling its representatives to attend because it is a private company. Once upon a time, it was a semi-State but even commercial semi-States are not compelled, although if that was the case, there would be a greater level of expectation that it would attend. At this stage, however, Eir has been a private company since 1999. I suggest, to be fair to Deputy Dillon, that we put it off until the next meeting of the committee and we deal with it then, finally, one way or the other. I do not want to defer it any longer. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next item on the agenda is the work programme. Next week is a non-sitting week due to Lá le Pádraig. The week after that, on 24 March, we will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. As usual, if there are any particular matters of interest to members that they would like to receive a briefing on in advance of the meeting, please let the clerk know. On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings for which the following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda Síochána on 31 March, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April. There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April. That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service. That is the last confirmed meeting. We previously agreed that we will engage with the University of Limerick, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the meeting with the Department of Justice, but these meetings have not yet been scheduled. On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE’s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE’s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House. The committee did that for a good reason. Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee. The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented. In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE’s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer. The next available date is 5 May. We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well. I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that. What order do members wish to take those meetings in? Does anybody have any views on that? Okay. The next available date is 5 May. We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee. Is that agreed? Agreed. We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well. I will request the secretariat try to schedule those meetings. Obviously, it will depend on their availability as well. We had quite a strong engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health this morning so we will check that. For the month of May, we will have the HSE and the Department of Health on the same day. We will try to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick because there are a number of issues relating to it that we want to examine. We can try to schedule meetings with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. We will leave that with the secretariat and ask it to get dates that are suitable for all involved and that fit in with our work programme.

There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April. That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.

A very good report was issued by Age Action Ireland in respect of the need for a new energy poverty strategy. The existing poverty strategy is out of date, as I think we all know. I hope to get a sense from the SEAI of where it sits in respect of ensuring scarce resources are deployed in a manner that ensures those people who are on very low incomes and who live in fuel-impoverished houses can be targeted in a way that makes sure the resources flow down to those who are most in need. The new national retrofitting plan, which is part of the climate action plan for 2021, has a target of bringing 500,000 homes to a B2 building energy rating by 2030. Our guests can question my figures, but we know that something like 18,400 retrofits were completed in 2020, approximately 4,000 of which raised the homes concerned to a B2 standard. We must, of course, take the pandemic and the associated challenges around meeting targets into account. That was challenging in terms of meeting targets. I want to get a sense from SEAI, from a corporate point of view, whether it sees its role as one that ensures it is not just people with means who take the lion’s share of the grants available for retrofitting because right now that is the case, and we can argue justifiably that that is the case. I want to make sure we have a system in place that ensures people who are fuel impoverished and who are on lower incomes get a greater chunk of that grant aid.

We are all talking the language of the just transition but nobody has been able to identify what that means in real terms. Dr. Byrne talked about ""energy poor"", but that does not necessarily mean income poor. A distinction has to be made here. I could be living in a well-appointed, high-value house in south Dublin, for instance - I do not mean to unfairly target south Dublin or characterise it in a particular way - and it could be worth up to €1 million, but it could be energy poor. Yet, the income coming into the house might a multiple figure of what might be coming into a typical 1970s bungalow in rural north Cork, for instance. In the income levels there could be a massive disparity. I am seeking an understanding from SEAI on whether or not Government policy is being directed to ensure that SEAI targets fuel-impoverished or energy-impoverished homes, but also households where the income levels are much lower. That is the key."

However, you could be living in an E, F or G BER-rated house and be a multimillionaire with plenty of cash in the bank. I am trying to get a sense as to whether the SEAI has received direction from the Government from the point of view of having a social policy instrument that targets people who depend on the State for their income, who are on meagre pensions or who are on low incomes.

What is the scaling up of the skill set of the labour force in order to meet a target in excess of 500,000 homes to be retrofitted? Where does the SEAI fit into the conversation that is happening about meeting the labour needs that are required.

Does that mean that when the technological solution becomes cheaper, that is where things will land in terms of a demand, supply and a price point? I ask this because, based on Dr. Byrne’s previous replies in respect of electric vehicles, that while it has built in thresholds in terms of grants, it seems it is ultimately waiting for the market to decide the cost of the vehicle. With respect, I am not sure if that is the right policy intervention. I would be glad to hear his views on that.

I suppose I am trying to get at whether it is seen as a priority for An Garda Síochána on the basis of the growth of cybercrime. It is now such a vast area of crime. It is a relatively new frontier or phenomenon. One worries that not enough resources are being deployed at the coalface to meet the crime detection requirements. If one could be disabused of that notion, it would certainly give some confidence.

The Commissioner made reference to the digital recording Bill. The Garda Representative Association has been very strong on the need for body-worn camera, bodycam, units. These will be legislated for in the digital recording Bill, presumably. What engagement has the Commissioner had with the Minister for Justice on that Bill? Assuming that the Bill becomes law, how will the Garda deploy resources? While my question is theoretical in advance of the legislation being passed, I am sure the Commissioner is planning for the eventuality of body-worn cameras being rolled out. I would like a sense of his perspective on this issue and how he envisages the technology being deployed as a resource for gardaí.
1572	SeanSherlock	Labour	18012.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-31 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	216	 I thank the Commissioner. I have less than one minute left. I want to dovetail with Deputy Colm Burke's point in respect of Macroom. The issue relating to Macroom is important for policing in an entire region, as the Commissioner can imagine. It is quite literally policing from the Kerry border over to the Waterford border and north to counties Limerick and Tipperary. That is not an insignificant area. It is arguable that Fermoy, which is the pre-existing divisional headquarters in County Cork, is a building that was fit for purpose when it was constructed but that is no longer suitable. Until Macroom comes on stream, an increasing number of gardaí will be going into pre-existing infrastructure. I wonder what kind of affect that has on the morale of gardaí when they are going into buildings that are substandard or not fit for purpose. What we want is modern buildings for gardaí to police from. That would be my humble opinion. I am sure if one is in a fit-for-purpose building, one's morale is that bit higher and so forth. I support Deputy Colm Burke's point about the need to ensure resources are deployed. I might have views with regard to Fermoy and Mallow, for instance. I might be a bit parochial about the fact that we found it strange that it was going to Macroom, but that is a matter of policy. We need to ensure that resources are deployed in terms of capital expenditure on buildings, however, and they need to be rolled out as quickly as possible. That is the general point in support of Deputy Colm Burke.
1573	SeanSherlock	Labour	18012.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-31 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	206	 That is fine. No other items of correspondence have been flagged. The next issue is the work programme. On 7 April, we will continue our series of justice-related meetings with two engagements. We will examine the financial statements of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission that morning and those of the Policing Authority that afternoon. At our meeting last week, we agreed to have separate speaking rotations for each engagement. The speaking rota and work programme have been updated accordingly. There are two non-sitting weeks over Easter. Our next meeting thereafter will be with representatives of the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service on 28 April. With regard to that latter engagement, I suggest that we request an update on the independent review of the voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons and seek clarity as to whether the report of that review can be available to the committee in advance of the engagement. Is that agreed? Agreed. Members might recall we highlighted that issue in our report. Our engagements for May are as follows. Representatives of the Department of Finance will be before the committee on 5 May. Representatives of the University of Limerick will be before the committee on 12 May. Representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be before the committee on 19 May. Representatives of the Department of Health and the HSE will attend on 26 May. That meeting will relate to a number of issues that are in the public domain. For the meeting with representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May, it is open to us to include on the agenda Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances, Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. Do members wish to include all of the Votes on the agenda for 19 May or would they rather examine any one of those Votes as a separate engagement? Members seem happy enough to address them all at the same time. We examined the Office of Government Procurement separately last year. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is a new Vote. How do members wish to proceed? Are they happy that we address all of those Votes at the one meeting? I take it they are. The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also responsible for Vote 15 - secret service, which cannot be examined in any substantive way. It is proposed to exclude that Vote from that agenda. Is that agreed? Agreed. That Vote has to do with State security. As agreed earlier, we will also include the format and content of the appropriation accounts on the agenda for that meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It was noted at last week's meeting that a response has not been received from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the committee's request for further information regarding the closure of the Benefacts database. The Department provided a response yesterday and it will be circulated on Monday for consideration at next week's correspondence meeting. It is also proposed to include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department on 19 May. We felt the Benefacts database was an important matter. Is that agreed? Agreed. As usual, if there is any specific area of interest to members and which they wish to raise, I ask them to notify the clerk so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can be prepared to engage on the issues. Are there any other matters that members wish to raise for inclusion on the work programme? There are not. A list of subjects that members have mentioned is attached to the documents before committee members, if they want to review it and come back to future meetings with it. That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today. The final item on the agenda is any other business. Do any members wish to raise any other matters? If not, we will go into private session before adjourning until 7 April, when we will examine the 2020 financial statements of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the 2020 appropriation accounts of Vote 41 - the Policing Authority.

For the meeting with representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May, it is open to us to include on the agenda Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances, Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. Do members wish to include all of the Votes on the agenda for 19 May or would they rather examine any one of those Votes as a separate engagement? Members seem happy enough to address them all at the same time. We examined the Office of Government Procurement separately last year. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is a new Vote. How do members wish to proceed? Are they happy that we address all of those Votes at the one meeting? I take it they are. The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also responsible for Vote 15 - secret service, which cannot be examined in any substantive way. It is proposed to exclude that Vote from that agenda. Is that agreed? Agreed. That Vote has to do with State security. As agreed earlier, we will also include the format and content of the appropriation accounts on the agenda for that meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It was noted at last week's meeting that a response has not been received from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the committee's request for further information regarding the closure of the Benefacts database. The Department provided a response yesterday and it will be circulated on Monday for consideration at next week's correspondence meeting. It is also proposed to include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department on 19 May. We felt the Benefacts database was an important matter. Is that agreed? Agreed. As usual, if there is any specific area of interest to members and which they wish to raise, I ask them to notify the clerk so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can be prepared to engage on the issues. Are there any other matters that members wish to raise for inclusion on the work programme? There are not. A list of subjects that members have mentioned is attached to the documents before committee members, if they want to review it and come back to future meetings with it. That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today. The final item on the agenda is any other business. Do any members wish to raise any other matters? If not, we will go into private session before adjourning until 7 April, when we will examine the 2020 financial statements of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the 2020 appropriation accounts of Vote 41 - the Policing Authority.

She is very welcome. Any dealings I have had with her have always been honourable, honest and straightforward. Although very rarely have I agreed with her from a politically ideological position, I have to say that my dealings with her have always been honest, straightforward and forthright. Could I focus on the funding position in respect of the HEA? Based on correspondence we have received, we are given to understand that core funding amounting to €1.7 million has been withheld to date. Is that the current position?

To my knowledge, there are not enough people in proper career progression. Many lecturers are still below the bar and are going from contract to contract. I speak for staff within the University of Limerick. It seems to me that if there is a withdrawal or holding back of funding, it stymies the ability of the university to fulfill its mission and obligations to its own staff but also its wider mission to the mid-west and Munster region. I say this as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation. I am very much aware of the work of EPI-STEM, Lero and other such entities and the translational effect of the research provided by the University of Limerick. I worry that if the HEA is withholding funding, it will have a downstream effect on the university's ability to allow staff to progress from below the bar to above the bar positions or to allow the university to ensure that people progress and that there is a career path for employees within the university. Is it the case that the holding back of this funding is affecting staff's ability to progress?

What reason was given in that conversation between the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the president?

This is all money that has been spent on external services. Will the president tell me why the university spending €595,000 on project management services and what are these services? That is my first question for her. Also, in respect of the brand refresh and implementation, €87,000 would pay the fees for one lecturer above the bar, if I can put it that way. My focus here is on staff and students, on what they are receiving and on what I would call their rights and entitlements. It seems to me the amount of money, which is approximately €3.1 million and is a significant amount, is all money that has been in spent on external services that could reasonably have been expected to be ploughed into investing in staff, educational output, and research output.

In 2019, the university spent €1.04 million on legal expenditure alone. It is a hell of a lot of money on legal fees.

Two meetings have also been confirmed in June, namely, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 2 June and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 June. We also agreed to schedule an engagement to examine local government oversight and accountability in June. If we were to hold one engagement in relation to local government on 23 June, that would leave three meeting slots before the summer recess. I ask members to review the work programme in advance of next week’s meeting so that we can prioritise engagements for those remaining meeting slots. We had a discussion earlier about how to handle the local government issue and agreed that we would bring in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Is that agreed? Agreed. Again, I ask members to review the suggestions that were submitted for the work programme and to let the clerk know if there is any issue they would like to prioritise for the vacant slots before the summer recess and we can agree them next week. As there are no matters that members wish to raise in relation to the work programme, I will take it as agreed. As I said, if there are any specific items of interest, please revert to the clerk. Is there any other business that members wish to raise? As everyone is happy, we will adjourn the meeting now.

The secretariat has been examining them to establish their admissibility and how best to progress them for consideration by the committee. There are five petitions to be discussed and we will now deliver our decisions on these. The first petition is petition No. P00013/16 from Mr. Paul Lorigan entitled Extend Offer of National Reunification to Northern Ireland and Scotland. The petition relates to the recent decision by the electorate in the United Kingdom to exit Europe and the fact that the majority of the electorate in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in Europe. The petitioner is requesting that the people of Ireland invite Northern Ireland and Scotland to share in an equal, fair and democratic nation. He is calling for a representative union based on equality and fraternity to be given fair consideration by public representatives in the Dáil and Seanad and that this suggestion be debated both Houses. In his response the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade outlined the Government's approach to the UK's exit from the European Union and the priority placed on the Northern Ireland peace process. The Government is committed to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK's exit from the European Union. The Agreement provides for the possibility at some stage in the future of a united Ireland providing a majority voted for that option. A Border poll which would test this consent in Northern Ireland can only be directed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. As regards the petitioners reference to Scotland, there is no similar basis on which to consider the petitioner's proposal. The decision of the committee is to forward a copy of the response received from the Department to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. We move on to petition No. P00014/16 from Mr. Damon Mathew Wise Âû entitled Petition for Exemption from Audit for small grassroots members-driven volunteer political parties. The petitioner highlights the fact that the Electoral Act 1997 and the Electoral Amendment (Political Funding) Act 2012 requires that the accounts of all political parties must be audited by a public auditor. The petitioner is of the opinion that volunteer-run political parties which do not have any paid membership should be exempt from having to pay for public audits. The petitioner suggested that we report to the Dáil and Seanad with recommendations, request that this report be debated by both Houses and an amendment be made to the political funding Act. The secretariat engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and a response was received on 28 October. The response outlines the reasons for the current legislation. Both GRECO and SIPO, the Standards in Public Office Commission, have made recommendations in their published reports on audits of accounts and political funding. The response also outlines the guidelines on the formation and size of a political party. The committee's decision is to forward a copy of the response received from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is

1593	SeanSherlock	Labour	16079.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-14 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	 There are five petitions to be discussed today and we will now deliver our decisions on them. The first petition is No. P00017/16 from Mr. Aidan Devlin regarding kindness and support to native American nations in times of need, with specific reference to the campaign to stop the North Dakota pipeline. We have considered the summary of the petition. As the petition asks the Government to make a statement on a matter that is outside the legislative powers of the State, it is considered inadmissible under Standing Orders. The decision of the committee is to inform the petitioner under the Standing Orders of the committee that the petition is inadmissible and is now closed. Is that agreed? Agreed. The second petition is No. P00027/16 from Mr. Andrew O'Connell regarding direct debit payments for motor tax in all classes. In its response, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has outlined a number of issues with the possible introduction of a direct debit payment. It has confirmed that its officials are monitoring the UK's decision to abolish the requirement to have a motor tax disc. The decision of the committee is to forward to the petitioner a copy of the response received from the Department and to advise him that the committee will respond to this letter recommending that the Department continue monitoring the situation with a view to looking favourably at abolishing the motor tax disc at a future date. In addition, the committee will liaise with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to recommend that it should continue monitoring the situation with a view to looking favourably at abolishing the motor tax disc at a future date. We are also proposing to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The third petition for consideration is No. P00028/16 from Mr. Daniel Lannon and relates to the purported unconstitutionality of the Courts Bill 2016. The decision of the committee is to inform the petitioner of the decision of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality and to close this petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The fourth petition for consideration is No. P00032/16 from Mr. Eamon Honan and argues that the petitions process should be reformed on the basis that the best ideas are not always the most popular. It is recommended to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C (1)(g). A petition is admissible unless it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system. It is also recommended that we correspond with the petitioner to outline the petitions process and that we close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration today is No. P00033/16 from Mr. Eamon Honan, proposing to change the name of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Legal Affairs. The decision of the committee is to deem the petition inadmissible and to close the petition. Under Standing Order 111C (1)(g), a petition is admissible unless it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system. Is the committee's recommendation agreed? Agreed.
1594	SeanSherlock	Labour	16121.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	" The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00020/16 from Mr. Desmond Lafferty which is entitled, ""Negotiating Norms"". The petitioner has engaged on a number of occasions with the Ombudsman and former Ministers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He is not satisfied with the outcome of this engagement to date and in his new petition is requesting the following: that the Ombudsman recognise the contradictions, mistakes and negligence of her staff in handling his case; that an external office monitor an ombudsman; a declaration that the previous committee was negligent and ill-informed in its handling of his petition; and the establishment of an explicit set of rules that would recognise the inalienable right of a private citizen to negotiation, reason and jurisprudence - the theory or philosophy of law - and that apologies not be casually retracted. It is proposed to inform the petitioner of the changes to the remit of the committee in respect of its engagement with an ombudsman, that the committee will not revisit a decision taken by the previous committee as petitioners can resubmit a petition and write to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requesting that it outline the procedures followed in dealing with complaints of this nature. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is Petition No. P00026/16 from Ms Laura English which is entitled, ""Driving test requirements"". This is the second time the petition has come before the committee. The petitioner is of the opinion that driving lessons are too expensive and that the cost precludes some persons from being in a position to learn how to drive and apply for a driving test. The petitioner outlines that a phased method of completing essential driver training, EDT, would be more beneficial. At its meeting on 15 November 2016 the committee agreed to write once again to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting clarification on who had responsibility for regulating the price of EDT lessons and whether it would look favourably at following in the United Kingdom's footsteps in having no limit on the number of lessons required. The response from the Department confirmed that the lessons delivered in Ireland were more structured than in the United Kingdom and that statistics showed it took an average of 47 lessons in the United Kingdom to pass a driving test. The cost of lessons, while not regulated by the Department, is set by market forces in a competitive market. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response to the petitioner and close the petition as the committee has taken it as far as it can. Senator Kelleher signalled."
1595	SeanSherlock	Labour	16121.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	3	 The proposal is agreed by the members. In discussing the petition, it is clear there are pure market forces driving the cost of driving lessons. One has some sympathy for the plight of the individual driver in this instance because of the cost of the lessons. The committee has articulated a view but is limited in its scope. If the members wish to comment, they are welcome to do so.
1596	SeanSherlock	Labour	16121.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	5	" We have agreed a course of action in respect of the petition. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00029/16 in the name of Mr Oisín Tuohey, entitled ""Reduce Maximum Working Week to 40 hours"". The petitioner seeks to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to reduce the maximum average working week for many employees to 40 hours per week. It is currently at 48 hours per week. The petitioner is of the view that this amendment would boost productivity and relationships in the workplace and result in fewer days of holiday and sick leave being taken and could reduce stress. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has responded, outlining the reasons for the legislation. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The last petition for consideration is petition No. P00035/16 in the name of Mr. David Geary, entitled ""Financial Ombudsman Review"". The issues raised in this petition arose after the petitioner submitted a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, regarding his standard variable rate mortgage provider. He was not satisfied with a decision taken by the FSO regarding his case and requests the committee to undertake the following actions. He wishes to have the decision of the Office of the Ombudsman independently reviewed to see if the handling of the original complaint was correctly adjudicated in accordance with the statute and to rectify any other similar cases in which the ombudsman has come to an incorrect decision, request that the ombudsman confirm if it was in compliance with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 regarding the petitioner's case, and quality assure and review the appeals procedures of the ombudsman. The FSO has commissioned a comprehensive review of its operational services and, following this review, has implemented significant changes by the introduction of a dedicated dispute resolution service and the issuing of preliminary findings regarding complaints received. It is proposed therefore to inform the petitioner of Standing Order 111C(1)(h), which precludes the committee from examining parts of this petition, and to forward a copy of the response from the Financial Services Ombudsman to the petitioner and close the petition. It is important to note that we intend to invite the Financial Services Ombudsman to appear before the committee regarding this petition to discuss the outcome of the independent strategic and operational review and its progress to date and into the future. Is that agreed? Agreed. I now turn to No. 10, which relates to the role and remit of the committee. I wish to inform members that the committee received correspondence dated 20 December 2016 from the clerk to the Standing Sub-committee on Dáil Reform regarding a request of the committee to broaden its role and remit to include matters of general public concern or public policy. The sub-committee, at its meeting of 14 December, agreed not to allow this request. Along with the request from the committee to broaden its remit, the Sub-committee on Dáil Reform also received correspondence from the Ombudsman Forum expressing its concern that the remit of the former Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has not been retained and requesting that this decision be reviewed. On this issue, the sub-committee agreed the following: ""Where a Select Committee does not under Standing Order 84A(8)(b) consider an Ombudsman report, or a portion or portions thereof, within two months (excluding Christmas, Easter or summer recess periods) of the report being laid before either or both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Committee shall proceed to consider the Ombudsman report, or any portions thereof not considered by the Select Committee."" At this stage I open the correspondence to the members for further discussion. As we have previously discussed, there was a genuine expectation that the role and remit of this committee would be expanded. This was articulated through interactions I had as Chairman when attending the Working Group of Committee Chairmen. It is a statement of fact that the role and remit of this committee has been reduced relative to the equivalent committee that sat under the previous Dáil. It is arguable that if we are the first line of contact for the petitioner, the citizen, it is perhaps not adequate that the committee's role would be reduced to such an extent that we are left only to consider sectoral committee ombudsman reports that have not been considered within a two-month period in the various sectoral committees. In other words, we are left only to consider those sectoral reports that have not been considered by other committees and petitions that come before us. I open the floor to the members to give their opinions on the role and remit of the committee."
1597	SeanSherlock	Labour	16121.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	9	 Members are unanimous in their view that there is a role for the committee. There was a legitimate expectation in our interaction with the Working Group of Committee Chairmen that its role would be expanded, that it would not seek to duplicate the work of other committees but would work to complement it. If an issue of public policy arose at this committee, for instance, it was to liaise with the sectoral committee and seek to have a workflow that would not necessarily be facilitated in the sectoral committee because of the sheer volume of work being done by it. We are all members of other committees. I do not understand why the sub-committee on Dáil reform came to the conclusion that it did, but we have agreed that we will write to it and seek to engage further with it. As has been said, there is a legitimate role for the committee. This is the first line of contact for people if they wish to raise an issue and see it elevated within the Houses of the Oireachtas.
1598	SeanSherlock	Labour	16121.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	11	 The key point is that we are not trying to invade the pitches of others, so to speak, but we are trying to complement the work of other committees. We could play a very relevant role in that respect.

1606	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	 We have a quorum and will commence the meeting. I propose we go into private session to deal with matters before resuming in public session. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1607	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	" We are now in public session to discuss decisions of the Committee on Public Petitions. The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00021/16 from Mr. Michael Callanan entitled, “Investigate circumstances relating to flawed implementation of fishing Legislation”. The petitioner is claiming that correspondence forwarded on behalf of the Chairman contained serious inaccuracies, which conflicted with that given by individual members of the previous committee when contacted by the petitioner; that the value for money review of the decommissioning schemes 2005 and 2008 fully vindicates his claims in relation to the administration of the scheme; that the information relating to the two test cases are readily available; and that it would take an impartial independent individual less than two hours to adjudicate on the matter. It is proposed to inform the petitioner that the committee is satisfied with the response from the Department with regard to all aspects of the issues raised in his petition, except the decision in relation to one of the cases provided. Therefore, it will correspond with the Department requesting that it confirm that all 490 successful applicants fully met with the following qualifying criteria: demonstrated a track record in commercial sea fishing by means of pots in the Irish inshore; and were not in full-time employment outside of the fishing industry. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00022/16 entitled, “Ireland should join the Antarctic Treaty”. The petitioner is asking the Irish Government to sign the Antarctic Treaty to demonstrate that Ireland is committed to preserving the continent of Antarctica. There are 303 signatures supporting the petition. The Department in its response stated that there was no compelling reason, either strategic or economic, for Ireland to ratify the treaty; that ratification would require a number of Departments to prepare legislation for the Oireachtas and would place considerable strain on Department resources; that Ireland is proud of our positive legacy in the Antarctic; and that Ireland is deeply committed to combating global warming and climate change through ensuring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00023/16 in the name of Mr. Norman Wilson, entitled ""Acknowledgment of, and response to, correspondence by Government Ministers"". The petitioner is requesting that all correspondence by e-mail to Ministers, Departments and An Garda Síochána be acknowledged within 24 hours of receipt and comprehensively responded to within one calendar month. The reform delivery office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the quality customer service initiative, as part of which all Departments, Government offices and other public bodies are required to publish charters covering a three-year period, based around a four-step cycle involving consultation, commitment, evaluation and reporting. In adhering to the requirements of this initiative, the Department of Justice and Equality published its 2016-18 customer service charter in 2016. This charter outlines the aims of the Department in improving customer service, for example by setting out response times to written and e-mail communications. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the petitioner and to refer the petition to the Department of Justice and Equality for response. Is that agreed?"
1608	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	" Okay. Is the proposal in respect of No. P00023/16 agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00025/16 in the name of Mr. Robert Carty, entitled ""Creating a Tobacco Free Generation"". The petitioner would like to see a tobacco-free Ireland and would like the Government to discuss introducing legislation similar to a Private Members' Bill that has been introduced in Tasmania, which proposes to prohibit the sale of tobacco products to anyone born after 1 January 2000. Following consideration by the Tasmanian Legislative Council, it has been determined the Bill could lead to limitations on the fundamental rights of citizens. The Department of Health has an action plan for a tobacco-free Ireland and is continually making progress in this area. The Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, have expressed their gratitude to the petitioner for submitting a petition on this issue. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response that has been received from the Department of Health to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00005/17 in the name of Ms Christine Cullen, entitled ""Make Co-operation with Trump Administration Conditional on Human Rights"". The petitioner proposes that the Government should make the same statement as the Chancellor of Germany on co-operation with the Administration of the United States of America. This petition is calling for a statement to be made by the Government. While this request is not a matter of public concern in relation to legislative powers, it could be deemed to be a matter of public policy under Standing Order 111B. For the purposes of clarification and to ensure the petitioner gets a fair hearing, it is intended to refer the petition to the Department of the Taoiseach for response. I remind the committee that Standing Order 111B(1) provides that ""a petition may be addressed to the Houses of the Oireachtas on a matter of general public concern or interest in relation to their legislative powers or an issue of public policy"". Arguably, the question of whether this petition is a matter of public policy remains open. In order to allow the petitioner a fair hearing, it is recommended that we refer the matter to the Department of the Taoiseach."
1609	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 The key point is that as parliamentarians, we would join the Government in pointing out that Ireland has signed various human rights declarations and treaties and a whole corpus of human rights law. As the members have concluded, the best course of action is to refer this petition to the Department of the Taoiseach. Is that agreed?
1610	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	" Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00006/17 in the name of Ms Grace Holmes entitled ""Stop the Taoiseach attending St. Patrick's Day event with Donald Trump"". The petitioner objects to the Taoiseach attending a St. Patrick's Day event with the President of the USA. The petitioner feels that Ireland should take a stand against some of the President's policies, for example banning refugees and people from specific countries from entering into the USA. This request is neither a matter of public concern in relation to legislative powers per se nor a matter of public policy. Therefore, is not admissible under Standing Order 111B(1) or Standing Order 111C(1)(a). It also requests Dáil Éireann to manage the diary of the Taoiseach of the day when he or she receives an invitation to attend an event somewhere, which is something it does not have the power to do under Standing Order 111C(1)(b). It is proposed to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Orders 111B(1) and 111C(1). Is that agreed? Agreed. As there is no further business, the committee stands adjourned until Wednesday, 8 March 2017, when we will meet officials from the Citizens Information Board.

It also requests Dáil Éireann to manage the diary of the Taoiseach of the day when he or she receives an invitation to attend an event somewhere, which is something it does not have the power to do under Standing Order 111C(1)(b). It is proposed to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Orders 111B(1) and 111C(1). Is that agreed? Agreed.

1615	SeanSherlock	Labour	16149.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	" Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00006/17 in the name of Ms Grace Holmes entitled ""Stop the Taoiseach attending St. Patrick's Day event with Donald Trump"". The petitioner objects to the Taoiseach attending a St. Patrick's Day event with the President of the USA. The petitioner feels that Ireland should take a stand against some of the President's policies, for example banning refugees and people from specific countries from entering into the USA. This request is neither a matter of public concern in relation to legislative powers per se nor a matter of public policy. Therefore, is not admissible under Standing Order 111B(1) or Standing Order 111C(1)(a).

1616	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	1	" The next item on our agenda is an engagement with the Financial Services Ombudsman. Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones. I welcome Mr. Ger Deering, the Financial Services Ombudsman, and Ms Elaine Cassidy, deputy Financial Services Ombudsman. I thank them for coming before the committee. The Joint Committee on Public Petitions received a petition from Mr. David Geary entitled ""Financial Ombudsman Review"", petition No. P00035/16. As part of its deliberation of this petition, the committee considered a response from the Financial Services Ombudsman and agreed at its meeting of 25 January 2017 to close the petition. However, it was further agreed to invite the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Deering, to appear before the committee to discuss the three-year change programme currently in operation. Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to advise everyone here that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind our guests that their opening presentations should be of ten minutes' duration or less. Members have been given a copy of the presentation that was submitted to the committee. I now invite Mr. Deering to make his opening statement."
1617	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	14	 The Senator has the floor. She can take that forward in the context of the Bill she is proposing on another day but my instinct is to give people the floor and as much time as they need.
1618	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	57	 I have one or two questions. What was the total number of complaints in 2016?
1619	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	59	 So 2,491 were resolved. Have complainants the right to legal representation?
1620	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	61	 What is the modality of the dispute resolution service? If I make a complaint as a citizen, I am contacted by the ombudsman's office. What happens then?
1621	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	63	 Can the Financial Services Ombudsman requisition documents and telephone records from the banks in dealing with a person's complaint?

1630	SeanSherlock	Labour	16177.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-22 00:00:00	Engagement with Financial Services Ombudsman	85	 That is fair enough. I recall it now. Please forgive me. We have a new development in the motor industry regarding the provision of 0% finance. The personal contract plan, PCP, is one model and there are others. I have anecdotal evidence that people have taken out a PCP product. It is so prevalent at this stage that I do not think I will offend anybody by naming the brand. The anecdotal evidence I have been hearing is that after people have paid the interest and it comes to paying back the principal, they get the shock of their lives because they never read the small print. They then realise they must pay a capital amount in financing the car. Have the delegates received complaints of this nature or have they had any interaction with the finance houses on ensuring customers of these products have absolute knowledge of what they are buying into and what the permutations will be at the end of the lifetime of these products?

1648	SeanSherlock	Labour	16191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	 We are now in public session. Petition No. P00024/16 from Mr. Thomas Mackey is on the criteria used to qualify for a primary medical certificate. It is proposed that we invite the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, to appear before the committee to discuss the issues raised in the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00036/16 from Mr. Neil Tolan, which proposes that a regulator be set up for the gambling-gaming industry. It is proposed to correspond with the Department of Justice and Equality and request that it outline a proposed timeline for the introduction of a new executive agency that will act as both the licensing authority and regulator for the gambling sector and to keep the committee updated on any progress in this regard. It is also proposed that we forward the response from the Department to the petitioner and that the petition will remain open to await the outcome of the Gambling Control Bill 2013. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00038/16 from Ms Abigail Mulligan to stop the use of Depo-Provera in Ireland. It is proposed, following consideration of this matter, that we forward a copy of the response from the Health Products Regulatory Authority to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00001/17 from Mr. Oisin Turakhia on the responsible service of alcohol. It is proposed that the committee further examine the issue and write to the petitioner to request that he produce further evidence. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00003/17 from Mr. Brian Houlihan on a public consultation on the feasibility of developing a hemp industry. It is proposed that the committee correspond with Teagasc and request an update on recommendations from the 2009 future of the industry study on the development of a hemp industry in Ireland. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00004/17 from Mr. Frank Considine on equality for school secretaries. It is proposed that the committee forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00013/17 from Ms. Tara O'Sullivan on making the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding an extra 30 minutes. It is proposed that we invite officials from the Department of Education and Skills and State Examinations Commission to appear before the committee to discuss how the mock examination papers provided by commercial suppliers to schools will be scrutinised in advance of sale to schools. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1649	SeanSherlock	Labour	16191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	3	 I concur with the Deputy. Once we have issued the invitation to the Department and State Examinations Commission, it may be a good idea to invite Ms O'Sullivan to appear before the committee, subject to her school schedule. We can consider that issue.
1650	SeanSherlock	Labour	16191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	5	 That is agreed. It is proposed to continue our deliberations in private session.

I thank Deputy Harty for attending. I will return the favour. The usual rules apply in relation to phones. I am just checking my own now. It is on airplane plane.

1655	SeanSherlock	Labour	16219.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	" The first petition for consideration is petition No. P00034/16 from Mr. Joseph O'Shea entitled, Lack of Appeal Opportunity for Pension Assessment. The petitioner is seeking an appeals mechanism to appeal decisions of the Minister for Justice and Equality on the determination of the level of disablement under the Garda Pensions Order 1925. He also claims the Pensions Ombudsman does not have the same powers as his counterpart in the United Kingdom when examining decisions of the Minister in relation to the awarding of this pension. The Pensions Ombudsman cannot ensure that the level of disablement assessment carried out by the Department of Justice and Equality is conducted in a proper and fair manner. Also, the Pensions Ombudsman cannot determine if the medical practitioner was given incorrect information or if the medical practitioner erred in conducting the assessment. It is proposed that we correspond once again with the Department to seek clarification on whether the Minister has responsibility for approving all applications to the scheme, or only cases where the initial decision has been appealed. That is the first recommendation. The next recommendation is that we ask the Department to correspond with the petitioner, outlining the policy elements as opposed to the personal elements of the issue at hand. Third, we will correspond with the Pensions Ombudsman to ascertain his view on an appeals mechanism to appeal decisions to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the determination of the level of disablement under the Garda Pensions Order 1925. We will also seek to examine the procedures followed by the Defence Forces when processing applications for a special pension where the applicant was injured in the line of duty. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00002/17 from Mr. Thomas Geraghty entitled, Civil rights for Civil Servants. This petition has been resubmitted by the general secretary of the Public Service Executive Union on behalf of the PSEU. It is in regard to the restrictions placed on civil servants in relation to running for election to public office and membership of a political party. Governed by circular 9/2009 and in particular paragraph 14, civil servants, other than those in the exempted categories in paragraph 13 must not speak in public on matters of local or national political controversy or express views on such matters in the media, including electronic media and the press, or in books, academic papers, articles or leaflets. In effect, certain categories of civil servants are restricted from making comments on matters whether or not such matters have relevance or not to their jobs. The petitioners agree that there needs to be some restrictions, but this should not involve the removal of basic civil rights for all civil servants. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform responded to the previous Administration confirming that it had no intention of amending the current terms and conditions of employment for civil servants. The committee considered responses from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Department. It is proposed to correspond with the Department to ascertain the following: first, its views on amending the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, to provide an explanation as to the political activity that is prohibited under the code, and the disciplinary action that is applicable when civil servants take part in political activity; and second, whether the Department would consider the drafting of legislation to deal with this. It is further proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to the petitioner and the petition will remain open. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00005/17 from Ms Christine Cullen, entitled, Make Co-operation with Trump Administration Conditional on Human Rights. We have previously gone through the outline of the petition. I propose to forward the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs, along with a copy of the Taoiseach's speech, to the petitioner and close the petition. The Taoiseach stated: ""The European Union is, above all else, a community of nations built on shared values – these values include human dignity, freedom and democracy, equality, and the rule of law. Values that I know are shared on this side of the Atlantic."" Is the recommendation agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00016/17, from Mr. Norman Wilson, entitled, The Cost of Irish Passports. I do not propose to go into the petition in greater detail and I suggest that we forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition.

Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P000036/16, which was submitted by Mr. Neil Tolan and which proposes the establishment of a regulator for the gambling industry. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise that the petition will remain open. The secretariat will correspond with the Department periodically to seek an update on the progression of legislation. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00001/17 regarding the responsible service of alcohol.

It is proposed to correspond once again with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government outlining that while the committee welcomes the progression of the Mediation Bill 2017, that Bill does not address the issue of the absence of legislation to tackle overhanging trees. The committee further requests that the Department examine current legislation and regulations in the UK with a view to considering a similar system for Ireland. The committee also requests that the Department report back to it. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise of further steps being taken by the committee. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00015/17 on widening the eligibility requirements for Irish citizenship by descent. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00017/17 from Mr. Mark Llewellyn, entitled ""Introduce refundable deposits on bottles and cans in Ireland"". It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed?"
1659	SeanSherlock	Labour	16247.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-31 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	3	 Yes.
1660	SeanSherlock	Labour	16247.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-31 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	5	" The Deputy will be aware that the Department published a report, entitled ""Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative Model in Ireland"" in July 2014. As part of that review, the introduction of a refundable deposit scheme for bottles and cans was considered. However, the report concluded that the scheme would be inappropriate because there was a scheme in operation by Repak. I agree with the Deputy in that there may be recourse for further examination of what Repak is and does. Perhaps a more appropriate course would be through the line committee responsible for oversight of these matters, if I might make that suggestion."

Members are requested to ensure their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to flight mode for the duration of the meeting. It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode as they will interfere with the broadcasting and recording systems. I propose that we go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1669	SeanSherlock	Labour	16289.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-07-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 We are now in public session to record the decisions of the committee. The first petition for consideration is No. P000024/16 from Mr. Thomas Mackey. The petitioner is of the view that the criteria for qualification for a primary medical certification is outdated and does not provide a criteria for upper limb amputees to qualify for the service. It is proposed that we write to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform expressing our concerns as to the rigid eligibility criteria of the scheme and highlighting to him the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman on this issue and the recommendation of the 2002 report. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00001/17 from Oisín Turakhia relating to the responsible service of alcohol. It is proposed that we correspond with the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00002/17 from Mr. Thomas Geraghty on behalf of the Public Service Executive Union, entitled civil rights for civil servants. It is proposed to correspond once again with the Minister acknowledging his detailed response, outlining that the committee welcomes his intentions to introduce a public sector standards commissioner under the proposed public sector standards Bill, requesting that he keeps the committee informed on progress on this matter and outlining that the petition will remain open with the committee, which intends to working closely with a public sector standards commissioner on addressing any gaps in the current circular and codes on this matter, and to forward a copy of the response from the Minister to the petitioner and advise of the above steps being taken. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00007/17 on the eradication of homework for children in primary school. The petitioner seeks to amend the policy of the Department of Education and Skills and eradicate homework for children in primary school. The petitioner is of the opinion that there is little educational benefit to homework and that homework can be a cause of stress and frustration for children. Having discussed this, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the petitioner, seek her views on the response from the Department of Education and Skills, leave the petition open and see what the response is. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1670	SeanSherlock	Labour	16289.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-07-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	 We have agreed a process on this one and it will remain open. We are all agreeable to that, so I will move on. The next item is petition No. P000010/17 from Ms Pauline Bleach on public consultation in the planning process. There are two aspects to the petition which seeks to make public consultation a legal requirement and to account for 20% of outcomes in planning decisions and to create an independent arbiter of facts and process with power to order revisions or reruns using correct processes and facts. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The last petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/17 from Ms Judith Dunphy and Mr. Shane Clarke seeking the opening of an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, unit in all primary and secondary schools. The petition outlines that parents often have to bring their children to other counties, towns or locations which are miles away from their homes to access schools with ASD classes. We propose to correspond once again with the Department asking it to outline the criteria required for a school to quality for an ASD class, the steps it takes to ensure there are ASD places for eligible primary schools and statistics on the geographical locations of all new ASD units in the past five years. We propose to correspond with Autism Ireland and other autism advocacy groups to ascertain their views as to whether there is a need for ASD classes in all mainstream schools and if they have evidence of same. We will forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioners, advise them of the further steps being taken by the committee and outline that the petition will remain open.
1671	SeanSherlock	Labour	16289.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-07-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 The contention in the petition is that parents should not have to bring their children miles to avail of education. It is very pertinent that the committee would seek to interrogate why that is and try to influence a proper outcome for affected families. We are all too aware of families who are adversely affected by the situation in which they find themselves. I want to get the committee's formal agreement to keep the petition open.
1672	SeanSherlock	Labour	16289.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-07-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 Proximity is key. Some logic must be applied. Is it agreed to keep the petition open? Agreed. There are no further petitions to consider today.

The usual rules apply on mobile phones. I will follow my own direction on that and put my phone on airplane mode. I propose that we now go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1679	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 The next item on the agenda is to record the decisions of the committee. The first petition for consideration is No. P000007/17, from Mrs. Alexandra Koster, relating to the eradication of homework for children in primary school. We have agreed to forward a copy of the petitioner's response to the Minister for Education and Skills to establish whether there is any intention to review the type of homework distributed to children in primary schools and also to seek clarification as to how the Department monitors the engagement by schools with parents and students in establishing a homework policy. We would also request that the petitioner substantiate her suggestion of the following: that there is firm evidence based on extensive research which suggests that homework for young people is of little or no educational benefit and can often be the cause of stress and anxiety from a young age; and the teaching of young children should be play and activity based with lots of outdoor time and opportunities to move around physically. We recommend that we keep the petition open and ask the petitioner to advance further some of the assertions she has made. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P000012/17 to devolve full legal responsibility and decision-making for archaeology and heritage to the Heritage Council. The suggestion is that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Heritage Council of Ireland to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1680	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	 It is recorded that the committee will close the petition. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000019/17, from Mr. Johnny Anderson, that the Lough Foyle ferry service should be maintained by the British and Irish Governments. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from Donegal County Council and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. The committee will also outline that, due to the uncertainty of the effects of Brexit, the committee recommends the Department assist Donegal County Council in seeking funding for ferry services which have the potential to increase tourism in coastal areas; request that the Minister report any progress on funding back to the committee; correspond with the Northern Ireland Assembly on the funding of this route; correspond with Donegal County Council; and outline that the committee will correspond with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as with the Northern Ireland Assembly, on funding for ferry services which have the potential to increase tourism in coastal areas. We will forward a copy of the responses received to the petitioner and, due to the uncertainty of Brexit and its impact on the areas mentioned, the petition will remain open. Is that agreed?
1681	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	 Does the Deputy agree with the committee’s proposals?
1682	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000024/17, from Mr. Christian Fuglsang, on regulatory action on insurance claims and premiums. Given the work of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and the working group on insurance, it is recommended that copies of the report of the working group and the first quarterly progress report are forwarded to the petitioner. It has been agreed, however, in private session to keep the petition open. Is that agreed?
1683	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 That is agreed then. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000030/17, from Ms. Arjita Chawla, a request for amending legislation relating to dog control. It is proposed the committee corresponds with the Department responsible and requests that clearer communication on this matter be available in each city council and local authority public office. The committee will also seek clarification of the enforcement powers relating to a court decision under current legislation; correspond with the County and City Management Association and request that it also contact all its members and suggest that clearer communication on this matter be available in each city council and local authority public office; and forward a copy of the response from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the petitioner, informing her of the decision of the committee on the petition. It is also proposed that the committee requests that she provides proof of a decision of the court not being executed. Are the recommendations agreed? Agreed. The last petition for consideration is petition No. P000032/17, from Mr. Frederic Vidal, entitled Catalan Civil Rights Compromised. The petitioner wishes to invite representatives from the Houses of the Oireachtas to Spain in advance of the referendum on Catalan independence as he is of the opinion that the civil rights of citizens are not being respected. We have had to deem the petition inadmissible as per Standing Order 111C(1)(a), “a petition is admissible unless it requests the Dáil to do anything other than the Dáil has power to do”. It is an interesting petition nonetheless. I am sure committee members have their views on the legality or otherwise of the forthcoming referendum. However, we are constrained by Standing Orders and, accordingly, must deem the petition inadmissible. Is that agreed?
1684	SeanSherlock	Labour	16366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 Certainly. I expected you to make a political point on this.

1702	SeanSherlock	Labour	16422.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	 Apologies have been received from Deputy Eugene Murphy and Senator Denis Landy. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.
1703	SeanSherlock	Labour	16422.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 I remind members, delegates and persons in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system. We will consider petition No. P000013/17 from Ms Tara O'Sullivan on how to make the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding 30 extra minutes. I welcome Ms O'Sullivan and her colleagues. She submitted the petition in her own name but in so doing was assisted by three of her fellow students, Ms Adrianne Ward, Ms Ellen McKimm and Ms Faye Dolan who have accompanied her to present it. We are delighted to have them before the committee. This is a significant day for them as secondary school students in appearing before a parliamentary committee, as it is for members. They are the first petitioners to be invited to appear before the committee since it was established in July 2016. It is, therefore, a momentous occasion for those on both sides of the equation. We compliment them on taking the initiative and, as third year secondary school students, participating in the petitions process. They have submitted a petition on an issue about which they all feel passionately. It took great strength of character to have the confidence to engage in the petitions process. As Chairman of the committee, I want to see more engagement of this nature. The committee is absolutely delighted that we have four formidable young people who are blazing a trail and setting the benchmark. We also welcome their parents and members of the school community who are in the Visitors Gallery. I am sure they are all extremely proud in seeing four formidable young women presenting before a parliamentary committee. Before I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission, I wish to update her on a few developments. The committee deliberated once again on the petition in private session and agreed to further actions in it progression. It has agreed to forward to her a copy of the latest response received from the Department of Education and Skills. We will seek submissions from the Irish Second-Level Students Union and the Teaching Council of Ireland on their views on the duration of the English junior certificate examination and the importance of holding mock examinations. We will invite the State Examinations Commission to appear once again before the committee in early 2018 - because of the nature of the work programme, it will not happen before then - to provide an update on the progress made in its engagement with stakeholders and their feedback on the service it provides. Ms O'Sullivan made a pertinent and appropriate point about the use of plain English. It was well made. The committee is acutely conscious of it and will have further discussions on how we can work through the issues involved. It is important that those who petition Parliament do not face impenetrable language. The language used has to be as accessible as possible to all people, regardless of who they are. The point was well made and we are working on the issue. I ask Ms O'Sullivan to address the petition and take at face value that we are working through the plain English element. In advance of her commencing her presentation, in accordance with procedure - this is where the language used gets at little legalistic - it is important that I read the note on privilege which is part of our protocols in Parliament. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. A copy of the petition has been circulated to them. Without further ado, I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission.

1705	SeanSherlock	Labour	16422.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	 I thank Ms O'Sullivan for her very comprehensive submission. I will now open up the discussion to members who want to interact with the witnesses by way of questions and answers.
1706	SeanSherlock	Labour	16422.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 Does the Deputy have any supplementary questions on that issue?
1707	SeanSherlock	Labour	16422.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 To be helpful, all four witnesses should feel free to respond. We want to hear all four voices.

The line committee, the committee that would have competence in relation to content, etc., would be the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. We are currently engaged with that committee on some of the issues highlighted. One of the points that threw itself up in lights for me was the issue of how the content within the Civic, Social and Political Education, CSPE, subject relates to the role of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions of Parliament. That is a major takeaway for me. The petition remains open. We will take on board some of the points the petitioners have made here today. We will engage further with the stakeholders involved. If the final outcome of this is that there is no change or the status quo remains, what is most important, both for me and for the members, is that the petitioners are here before an Oireachtas committee, they have taken the time to put forward a petition and they have impressed us with their depth of knowledge in terms of answers that they have given to questions. In the first instance, any of their cohort who are looking at this, anybody throughout the country, any teacher worth his or her salt, will use this segment of their submission as a teaching tool to educate their fellow students about what they, too, can do on issues of public concern and they now have the ability to come forward and make submissions to a petitions committee. If they do not get the desired outcome, I would say: ""That's life."" One will accept the results, one way or the other. It may go your way and it may not. However, the fact that they have been here before us today is as, if not even more, important because it clearly signals to us that there are excellent young people out there. Like Deputy Dara Murphy, I do not want to patronise the petitioners in any way but I am not sure whether I would have had the confidence when I was going through my junior certificate if somebody had invited me in to the Committee on Public Petitions or any committee of the Dáil to make a submission. I am here as a Member of the House but on a personal level, I do not think I would have had the confidence to do what they have done. We are very grateful to the petitioners for coming before the committee today. If I may say, the Loreto ethos, with which I have personal interaction in my own part of the world, is alive and well. The petitioners are fine examples, not only of that ethos but of the best what we have to offer, and what the future holds. If four articulate students such as these can come before us and hold themselves with dignity in front of an Oireachtas committee, they are up there with the best of them. I thank them very much for being here. We wish the petitioners well in their continuing studies. I hope that everything went or will go well for them, in terms of the junior certificate examinations. I am hoping that in life everything will go well for them because they have been a fine example of the best that we have to offer in this country, and I mean that sincerely. I will adjourn the meeting now. We will make refreshments available to the petitioners afterwards. We have a little pack to give them as well, just as a little gift. We hope that there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of students who will look at this. We hope that teachers will look at this and use it in the best possible way as an example of what the Committee on Public Petitions is available to do for people. I thank our guests for being here. We are delighted to have them."

The petitioners are fine examples, not only of that ethos but of the best what we have to offer, and what the future holds. If four articulate students such as these can come before us and hold themselves with dignity in front of an Oireachtas committee, they are up there with the best of them. I thank them very much for being here. We wish the petitioners well in their continuing studies. I hope that everything went or will go well for them, in terms of the junior certificate examinations. I am hoping that in life everything will go well for them because they have been a fine example of the best that we have to offer in this country, and I mean that sincerely. I will adjourn the meeting now. We will make refreshments available to the petitioners afterwards. We have a little pack to give them as well, just as a little gift. We hope that there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of students who will look at this. We hope that teachers will look at this and use it in the best possible way as an example of what the Committee on Public Petitions is available to do for people. I thank our guests for being here. We are delighted to have them."

The line committee, the committee that would have competence in relation to content, etc., would be the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. We are currently engaged with that committee on some of the issues highlighted. One of the points that threw itself up in lights for me was the issue of how the content within the Civic, Social and Political Education, CSPE, subject relates to the role of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions of Parliament. That is a major takeaway for me. The petition remains open. We will take on board some of the points the petitioners have made here today. We will engage further with the stakeholders involved. If the final outcome of this is that there is no change or the status quo remains, what is most important, both for me and for the members, is that the petitioners are here before an Oireachtas committee, they have taken the time to put forward a petition and they have impressed us with their depth of knowledge in terms of answers that they have given to questions. In the first instance, any of their cohort who are looking at this, anybody throughout the country, any teacher worth his or her salt, will use this segment of their submission as a teaching tool to educate their fellow students about what they, too, can do on issues of public concern and they now have the ability to come forward and make submissions to a petitions committee. If they do not get the desired outcome, I would say: ""That's life."" One will accept the results, one way or the other. It may go your way and it may not. However, the fact that they have been here before us today is as, if not even more, important because it clearly signals to us that there are excellent young people out there.

Members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device used. It is not sufficient for them to leave them in silent mode as they maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system. I propose that we go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters.

It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00017/17 . It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner, inform him of the Private Members' Bill, Waste Reduction Bill 2017, and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00042/17. It is proposed to deem the petition to be inadmissible, as set out in Dáil Standing Order 111C.(1)(f).

The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00044/17 on ending the Irish arms trade with Israel. The reply from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade addresses the issues raised by the petitioner. It states that Ireland does not have an arms industry and is not an exporter of weapons to any country. The purchase of arms, it continues, is subject to a tendering process, the principal criterion being the best equipment that can be obtained for the protection and operational effectiveness of Irish troops. In that regard, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?"
1726	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	6	 The proposal is to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner. In doing so, the committee recognises and respects the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration has been the subject of some public discourse in the past 48 hours. Petition No. P00026/17 from Ms Aideen Darmody seeks the removal of the statue of Prince Albert from the grounds of Leinster House on the basis that it pays tribute to a monarch whose values are in opposition to those of the Irish Republic. The petitioner suggests that the statue be auctioned and the proceeds donated to a homeless charity. We have received correspondence from the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas stating that the Houses do not own the statue of Prince Albert and that information on its ownership can be supplied by the Office of Public Works art management unit. The physical implications and potential cost of removing the statue would also be best answered by the OPW. The statue dates back to the Royal Dublin Society's ownership of Leinster House. It is worth noting that the sculpture was done by John H. Foley, who was a renowned sculptor. The proposal before us is to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(a) because it is asking the Dáil to do something that it does not have the power to do. When we discussed this in private session, the view was that the committee does not wish to have the statue removed, that it should remain but that it would be pertinent to seek clarification from the OPW or the powers that be as to who owns the statue. However, I wish to have a discussion and will seek members' views.
1727	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	11	 I thank the members for sharing their views. It is the view of the committee that the statue should remain. From a technical point of view the petition is deemed inadmissible because it is asking us to do something we do not have the power to do. However, it is an interesting one. Deputy Mitchell is right. Sometimes there is an eclectic range of petitions before us and we are respectful to the petitioners but there is a clear view in this case that, as the emeritus professor of history at University College Cork, John A. Murphy, said when quoting from George Santayana, a philosopher poet, a civilised people does not tear out the pages of history, it simply turns them over. We acknowledge the presence of the statue and that it is symbolic. However, the artistic merit attributed to the statue given that it is the work of John H. Foley probably supersedes the statue's subject. We are clear on our position and I thank the petitioner for-----
1728	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	13	 To be helpful, perhaps we should establish the ownership in the first instance.
1729	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	15	 We have agreed to correspond with the OPW on that. Perhaps we can discuss it when a response is received.
1730	SeanSherlock	Labour	16499.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Business of Committee	17	 To respond to Deputy Mitchell's earlier point, I have been going through that gate for ten years. One passes the statue by and does not take much notice of it, to be honest. Like the Deputy, I had to go out the other day to take a look at it to see who it was and so forth. It took me a while to find it. It is quite an imposing structure but it is hidden by the hedge. I would not necessarily opt for relocating it. If, however, some treatment can be done in or around the location of the statue by the OPW or the internal management of the Houses, that might be the way to proceed. I thank the members for their agreement on this issue and I again thank the petitioner. A decision has been made. Is that agreed? Agreed. As there is no further business, the meeting is adjourned until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 2017.

1738	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	1	 I thank the witnesses for coming in. There are the usual provisos in respect of mobile phones. I will just turn my own to airplane mode. I propose we go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters before returning to public session.
1739	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	2	 The next item on the agenda is engagement with officials from the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills. Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery to switch their phones to airplane mode please. I welcome, from the State Examinations Commission, Mr. Aidan Farrell, chief executive officer and Dr. Tim Desmond, acting head of the examinations and assessment division. Ms Rita Sexton, assistant principal officer, is from the Department of Education and Skills. I thank them for appearing before us. The witnesses have been invited here today to discuss petition No. P000013/17 from Ms Tara O'Sullivan on how to make the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding 30 extra minutes. Ms O'Sullivan is requesting that the Department of Education look at the possibility of extending the length of time of the English paper for the junior certificate by 30 minutes to allow students enough time to complete the paper. Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to read the following. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind our guests, as we indicated in the committee's invitation, the presentation should be no more than five to ten minutes duration. I am proposing that, rather than read out the submission verbatim, because all of the members have received the submission, if the witnesses were in a position to summarise it in five minutes or so then we can have a question and answer session on the nature of the submission. If that is okay, I will call Mr. Farrell to open the proceedings.
1740	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	4	 I understand that approximately 60,000 people completed the examination.
1741	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	6	 Plus four individual complaints were made about time constraints.
1742	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	8	 Was there a geographical spread in terms of the four complaints? Did they come from one entity?
1743	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	10	 Mr. Farrell's colleagues can also respond to my queries.
1744	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	13	 It is reasonable to presume that if there were only four complaints from various parts of the country then the vast bulk of the 60,000 people who participated in the examination were satisfied with the two hour allocation. I do not mean to put words into anybody's mouth here. I just want to get a sense of the matter from the witnesses.
1745	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	16	 Some of us are under time constraints today and I apologise to the witnesses. Time is always a big issue here. I know the committee has sent correspondence to the witnesses about other issues as well but I want to open up the debate to other members. I call on Senator Kelleher to commence.
1746	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	21	 For clarification, is that under the statement of strategy?
1747	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	29	 Deputy Eugene Murphy wishes to intervene but with regard to your point about content, one of the issues we highlighted related to the role of Parliament and parliamentary committees. We perceive that there is a phasing out of that knowledge, as it were, at junior cycle level. I am relying on my notes but with the new well-being programme the current civic, social and political education, CSPE, is being phased out under the junior cycle reform programme. Where lies the ability of students to glean knowledge on the role of Parliament and parliamentary committees, for example?
1748	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	35	 The complaint desks did not receive 11,000 calls.
1749	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	38	 To be fair, given the degree of parent and pupil power we have these days and given that 11,000 people signed the petition, I expect people know their rights.
1750	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	40	 It is a fair question.
1751	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	44	 I thank Mr. Farrell very much for that comprehensive response. Do members have any further questions?
1752	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	46	 There has to be some deconstruction of the thinking that existed heretofore where everything was geared towards the terminal exam. It is quite a struggle for many schools to try to deconstruct the pedagogical element and the content aspect of this. Where a school was geared towards trying to squeeze as much as possible in to the terminal exam, it was in the confined space of time because they were getting the desired points or desired results for the onward trajectory towards third level institutions and so on. The previous junior cycle was part of that trajectory or continuum. Maybe some schools continue to struggle in this regard. I do not refer specifically to Loreto College, which generated this petition, but maybe some challenges remain in the system around trying to deconstruct some of that thinking. This gives voice to petitions of this nature, and I speak in general terms. The committee has heard absolutely compelling evidence here today. By any reasonable or objective analysis, the witnesses have given a very robust account of the nature of the correspondence entered into with the petitioners and have engaged willingly and openly with the petitioners. The witnesses have answered all of the questions on the time challenge. The research and qualitative analysis carried out clearly shows that the time was not such an issue as it related to last year's English exam and that people were able to get to the questions in a timely fashion. I believe the committee members are in agreement with that analysis. The procedures in place for individual students to interface with the State Examinations Commission are robust; in this instance in this exam, there were only four people in the State who made a complaint about the time element out of 60,000 students who sat the same exam - and protecting their anonymity I assume they were not four individuals from one school and that they represent a wider geographical spread. The vast majority of students who took the exam were satisfied about the time constraints under which they were operating. I believe this to be a fair assessment. Having regard to the evidence submitted to the committee by the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills the committee deems it appropriate to close the petition and to send a copy of the submission made by the State Examinations Commission and the Department to the petitioners. The committee will thank the petitioners for their engagement with the committee. On behalf of the committee members, I express my gratitude to the witnesses for coming before the committee today.

1753	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	1	 There has to be some deconstruction of the thinking that existed heretofore where everything was geared towards the terminal exam. It is quite a struggle for many schools to try to deconstruct the pedagogical element and the content aspect of this. Where a school was geared towards trying to squeeze as much as possible in to the terminal exam, it was in the confined space of time because they were getting the desired points or desired results for the onward trajectory towards third level institutions and so on. The previous junior cycle was part of that trajectory or continuum. Maybe some schools continue to struggle in this regard. I do not refer specifically to Loreto College, which generated this petition, but maybe some challenges remain in the system around trying to deconstruct some of that thinking. This gives voice to petitions of this nature, and I speak in general terms. The committee has heard absolutely compelling evidence here today. By any reasonable or objective analysis, the witnesses have given a very robust account of the nature of the correspondence entered into with the petitioners and have engaged willingly and openly with the petitioners. The witnesses have answered all of the questions on the time challenge. The research and qualitative analysis carried out clearly shows that the time was not such an issue as it related to last year's English exam and that people were able to get to the questions in a timely fashion. I believe the committee members are in agreement with that analysis. The procedures in place for individual students to interface with the State Examinations Commission are robust; in this instance in this exam, there were only four people in the State who made a complaint about the time element out of 60,000 students who sat the same exam - and protecting their anonymity I assume they were not four individuals from one school and that they represent a wider geographical spread. The vast majority of students who took the exam were satisfied about the time constraints under which they were operating. I believe this to be a fair assessment. Having regard to the evidence submitted to the committee by the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills the committee deems it appropriate to close the petition and to send a copy of the submission made by the State Examinations Commission and the Department to the petitioners. The committee will thank the petitioners for their engagement with the committee. On behalf of the committee members, I express my gratitude to the witnesses for coming before the committee today.

Having regard to the evidence submitted to the committee by the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills the committee deems it appropriate to close the petition and to send a copy of the submission made by the State Examinations Commission and the Department to the petitioners. The committee will thank the petitioners for their engagement with the committee. On behalf of the committee members, I express my gratitude to the witnesses for coming before the committee today. We strayed in to other areas also, but it was very useful to engage with the witnesses because it is helpful to members, as parliamentarians, to understand the dynamics of the State Examinations Commission and the Department on the exam structures. It was a useful tutorial for us and we are grateful for it. I thank the officials for coming before us today and for engaging with the committee.
1766	SeanSherlock	Labour	16513.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-02-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	44	 There has to be some deconstruction of the thinking that existed heretofore where everything was geared towards the terminal exam. It is quite a struggle for many schools to try to deconstruct the pedagogical element and the content aspect of this. Where a school was geared towards trying to squeeze as much as possible in to the terminal exam, it was in the confined space of time because they were getting the desired points or desired results for the onward trajectory towards third level institutions and so on. The previous junior cycle was part of that trajectory or continuum. Maybe some schools continue to struggle in this regard. I do not refer specifically to Loreto College, which generated this petition, but maybe some challenges remain in the system around trying to deconstruct some of that thinking. This gives voice to petitions of this nature, and I speak in general terms. The committee has heard absolutely compelling evidence here today. By any reasonable or objective analysis, the witnesses have given a very robust account of the nature of the correspondence entered into with the petitioners and have engaged willingly and openly with the petitioners. The witnesses have answered all of the questions on the time challenge. The research and qualitative analysis carried out clearly shows that the time was not such an issue as it related to last year's English exam and that people were able to get to the questions in a timely fashion. I believe the committee members are in agreement with that analysis.

1770	SeanSherlock	Labour	16527.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-07 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	" The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00038/17, from Mr. Paddy Lambe, entitled ""Bureaucracy and the Public Services Card"". It is vital that the person who applies for and passes the driving theory test is the same person who sits the subsequent practical driving test. A person's identity is established to a substantial level of assurance through the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, registration process, which results in the issuing of a public services card, PSC. The Department accepts that this requires effort from citizens but asserts that this is a once-in-a-lifetime process. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0048/17, from Mrs. Anna McKenna, entitled ""Drogheda City Status"". It seeks city status for the town of Drogheda. The committee agrees to keep the petition open pending the publication by the Government of its report on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability. We are proposing to put a six-month horizon on this petition. I seek the agreement of members on this proposal. Perhaps members would like to say a few words about the petition before we make a final determination on it."

We have essentially agreed that we will keep the petition open and put a horizon of approximately six months on it, pending the publication of the Government's report. I want to pay due respect to what Deputy Cassells has said about the issues relating to the jurisdiction of County Meath. When petitions come before us, it is important in the first instance that they come before us in the correct and appropriate manner. We are keeping this petition open because the committee feels that the petitioners have the right to be heard. I agree with Deputy Cassells that from a territorial perspective if the petition seeks to traverse a border for which it has no mandate then one could argue on the basis of common sense and practicality that it would be very easy to close the petition. The committee has given due consideration and this is the reason we are keeping it open and also in deference to the Members of the Oireachtas who are representatives of Louth, who have spoken on this issue. The committee proposes to forward a copy of the correspondence we have received on this issue from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to all Members of the Oireachtas, Senators and Deputies, for the Louth and Meath constituencies, so they will all be furnished with a copy. I thank the committee members for agreement on this issue. The next petition received for consideration is Petition No. P0001/18. It is proposed to forward to a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner informing him of the Private Members' Bill on waste reduction and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. I shall now turn to Petition No. P00040/17 regarding Respreeza. I understand that the petitioner has withdrawn the petition. The committee respects her right to withdraw the petition but we acknowledge that we received the petition and gave it some consideration. This petition will be withdrawn. Is that agreed? Agreed.

We decided to look at this as a committee because we had a presentation from Leigh Gath, who was presenting on her role but who also spoke about her own personal experience and therefore we got interested in the personal assistants. This has been a very educative process for me today as it was about the impact of a PA service on a person's life in terms of accessing employment, a social life and so on. I thank Owen, Eileen and Jerry for painting that picture very clearly. I thank the Department witnesses also for giving us the facts and figures on the number of people and hours. We had an interesting debate about the definition. Can it be called a personal assistant service with ten hours being provided? We also spoke about the juggling, the rationing and the need for a policy on all of that. One of the things committees like ours can do is draft reports. Given that this is a policy development area, it might be helpful for us to do so that we could draw together the experiences. Senator Buttimer spoke about hearing from the PAs. It would not be fair of us to put them on the spot today but we could take a submission from them to complete our knowledge. We might take submissions from elsewhere as well. I propose that the committee would issue a report on the personal assistant service. Their policy is in development so it might be a useful contribution to their thinking and capturing the benefits but also some of the current critical issues. The meeting has been very useful. I thank the people in the Gallery who attended also.

I thank Owen, Eileen and Jerry for painting that picture very clearly. I thank the Department witnesses also for giving us the facts and figures on the number of people and hours. We had an interesting debate about the definition. Can it be called a personal assistant service with ten hours being provided? We also spoke about the juggling, the rationing and the need for a policy on all of that. One of the things committees like ours can do is draft reports. Given that this is a policy development area, it might be helpful for us to do so that we could draw together the experiences. Senator Buttimer spoke about hearing from the PAs. It would not be fair of us to put them on the spot today but we could take a submission from them to complete our knowledge. We might take submissions from elsewhere as well. I propose that the committee would issue a report on the personal assistant service. Their policy is in development so it might be a useful contribution to their thinking and capturing the benefits but also some of the current critical issues. The meeting has been very useful. I thank the people in the Gallery who attended also.

1799	SeanSherlock	Labour	16625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 The first petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/17 from Ms Judith Clarke and Mr. Shane Dunphy seeking the opening of an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, unit in all primary and secondary schools. They state that parents often have to bring their children to other counties, towns or locations which are miles away from their homes to access schools with ASD classes. This is the third time we have considered this petition. We propose that the committee forward the response of the Minister for Education and Skills to the petitioners and close the petition. We propose to ask the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to take account of the recommendations of all three advocacy groups, to whom we have reached out on this issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.

The petitioner proposes that consolidating statutory instruments would be publicly beneficial as it would make laws more accessible and transparent to all and could result in the reduction of legal fees. It is proposed that the committee would close the petition, forward a copy of the responses from the Office of the Attorney General and the Law Reform Commission to the petitioner and inform the petitioner of the upcoming report by the Law Reform Commission on this issue.

1809	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	2	 We will now consider the public petitions. The first is Petition No. P0008/17. It is proposed that the committee forward a copy of the latest reply from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the petitioner with a copy of the Mediation Act 2017 and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0006/18. The decision of the committee is to forward a copy of the reply from Dublin City Council to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1810	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	4	 Thank you, Deputy. I am going to move on. The final petition for consideration is Petition No. P00024/18. This is in respect of a two-tier system whereby those who can afford a newer car pay less motor tax. This relates to the pre-2008 legislation cars subject to the old regime on motor tax. The committee is proposing that we forward a copy of the reply from the Office of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and close the petition. I need your agreement on that. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1811	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	6	 Thank you, Deputy Cassells. We have agreed to forward a copy of the reply from the office of the Minister to the petitioner and we are closing the petition. The point is made. There is sympathy for the case being made in this instance by the petitioner on the basis that 2008 was such an arbitrary year. Not everyone has been in a position since then to change or upgrade their vehicles. Many people are still driving a 2008 vehicle or a pre-2008 vehicle and find themselves in a different motor tax band. There is a difficulty therein. There is sympathy but in terms of dealing with the petition we have decided to send a copy of the reply from the Minister to the petitioner.
1812	SeanSherlock	Labour	16639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-06-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	8	 You will be riding this horse in the Committee of Public Accounts as well, Deputy.

1822	SeanSherlock	Labour	16653.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-07-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	 It is duly noted. I thank the Deputy. We are agreed on the course of action to taken on the petition. The next petition is No. P00002/18. It is proposed that the committee decide that the petition is inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(h) and forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition is worthy of further discussion. It is No. P00016/18 and was received from Ms Sarah Joyce. It concerns orchestral provision in Ireland. The petitioner believes orchestras are an intrinsic part of our culture and is seeking to call a halt to the report by RTÉ on the review of its orchestral provision and the establishment of a national strategy on the matter by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. She believes it is not a matter for RTÉ alone. We had a discussion on it in the previous session. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, will establish an oversight group, to be chaired by her Department, to begin the discussion on the implementation of RTÉ's independent report and ensure the successful transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, NCH. In addition, a working group from RTÉ and the NCH will undertake consultation with the staff concerned. The issue is worthy of further discussion.
1823	SeanSherlock	Labour	16653.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-07-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 For the purposes of clarification, in some respects the petition has been superseded by the fact that RTÉ has replied to the joint committee with a copy of the independent report published on 23 April. It is worth going into its content. It is entitled, RTÉ Orchestras: Ensuring a Sustainable Future, and was produced by the former director of BBC Radio and BBC News, Ms Helen Boaden, with the support of the strategy consulting firm Mediatique. The review looked at the best way to provide high quality and sustainable orchestral services for the Irish public and covered the National Symphony Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. It is important to distinguish between the two. The report's core conclusion is that it is not in the national interest for either of the two orchestras to be closed and that they should be brought up to full strength. However, the report also concludes that it is hard to see how RTÉ can fund even the current level of provision, let alone cover the increase in budgets that would be required to enable the orchestras to return to full strength and undertake touring and educational programmes. It recommends that the National Symphony Orchestra be established as a national cultural institution in its own right, or as part of the National Concert Hall, and be funded by the Government. I believe committee members are agreeing to a further discussion on the matter. Many people are confused about what is going on. Many of us absolutely agree that the output of both orchestras is absolutely vital to Ireland's cultural life, but it is also pertinent for the committee to agree to the suggestion that we invite the director general of RTÉ to come to give us its perspective on the issue. I propose that we do not close the petition at this point in order that we can have that further discussion. We can then see what action the committee might take arising from that discussion.

We will correspond with the director general of RTÉ and invite her to come at the first available opportunity in the autumn for a further discussion on the issue. Is that agreed? Agreed. I should have said we propose to forward copies of the replies received from RTÉ, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and the office of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the petitioner. Is that agreed? Agreed. As we have concluded our business, I propose that we adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 September. Is that agreed? Agreed.

1835	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 At a previous meeting, we considered the issue of the Ombudsman's Nursing Home Casebook. To help us to consider this matter further, I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly. I advise any witnesses present to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and will interfere with the broadcasting of the meeting. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. It is perhaps ironic that I am reading this to somebody who is also a Member of the House but we must abide by the rules. I welcome the Minister of State. Perhaps he could give us a five-minute overview of his submission followed by a quick question-and-answer session and we can take it from there.
1836	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	 I thank the Minister.
1837	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 Please do.
1838	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 Would the Minister of State like to respond?
1839	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 I thank the Minister of State. I have a few questions for him. He has spoken about future planning. As the population ages, housing solutions will need to have greater complexity. I am sure he will agree that the modus operandi will need to involve facilitating independent living as near as possible to the end of life. I wonder whether the space exists in the current housing crisis to think through the challenges we are facing with regard to the zoning of land, the housing policy of local authorities and the mapping of Government policy. I would like to get his perspective on that. My second question relates to residents of nursing homes whose houses are vacant. There has been some public discussion on the possibility of facilitating occupancy of those houses while people are in nursing homes. How stands that possibility? It could do a lot to help to solve the current housing supply crisis. The third issue I would like to raise relates to public nursing homes. There are some vacant beds in Fermoy Community Hospital. If hospital management personnel are seeking to hold beds for a greater level of acuity, I can understand that. The effect, in real terms, of HIQA bed management rules relating to the operational space for each bed has been to restrict the number of beds in wards that had a greater number of beds up to now. Has consideration been given to the capacity of nursing homes - particularly in the public sphere, where there is a shortage of beds at present - to provide a greater number of beds where there is serious demand?
1840	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	 That is significant.
1841	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	 How close are the Departments to making a decision?
1842	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	 Okay.
1843	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	 My point related specifically to the HIQA bed management recommendations. As a result of new restrictions that have been put in place, a previous 16-bed ward in a community nursing home is now a 12-bed ward. I use those figures for the sake of argument. I note that Senators will have to leave because there is a vote in the Seanad. I thank Senators Buttimer and Wilson. I am not sure whether the HIQA recommendations I have mentioned are governed by statutory instruments. I wonder whether there is flexibility. If demand increases, can we allow for greater flexibility within the current arrangements without going into large-scale capital expenditure for new beds and wards? Can we make use of current facilities and still allow for the dignity of the person and all of that to be preserved? Can we facilitate greater scope through bed management within the existing hospital structures or community hospital structures?
1844	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	 I have one final question regarding additional charges. I acknowledge the Minister of State is expecting the report from the interdepartmental working group. Can he be more specific on the timeframe for that?
1845	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	 It comes with a health warning.
1846	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	 I thank the Minister of State for attending and for engaging on the nursing home casebook. We are to meet with the various ombudsman offices shortly. We might allow for a further engagement as needs be if the Minister of State is willing further down the line.
1847	SeanSherlock	Labour	16730.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	 That relates to the contractual arrangements.

1868	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	 As we have the required number of members present I propose that we go into public session. Is that agreed? Agreed. We have not received any apologies thus far. I wish to advise members that the usual provisos apply in terms of mobile phones. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
1869	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 We propose to consider some of the public petitions, the first of which is No. P00019/18 from Ms Angela Dunne. We propose to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00033/18 from Mr. Daniel Ryan on the issue of freedom of speech. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration is No. P00037/18 from Mr. David Layton. It is proposed that we deem the petition inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order No. 11C(1)(a). Is that agreed? Agreed.
1870	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	 At a previous meeting, we considered the issue of orchestra services at RTÉ on foot of a petition. To help us further consider this matter, I welcome Mr. Aodán Ó Dubhghaill from RTÉ, the head of RTÉ Lyric FM and RTÉ Orchestras, and Mr. Rory Coveney, special adviser to the director general of RTÉ, and Mr. Mathew Horsman of Mediatique, co-author of the recent review of RTÉ's orchestral services. I advise our witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and will interfere with the broadcasting of the meeting. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee. If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise them that the opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Mr. Ó Dubhghaill to make his presentation, which we will follow with an interactive question and answer session.
1871	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 I propose we hear the submission from Mathew. I am dispensing with the formalities here, so forgive me for referring to the witnesses by their first names. It is just the way we operate in this committee and it is much easier. Does Mathew want to add to that and give us his overview?
1872	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 Please go ahead.
1873	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 I call Deputy Cassells.
1874	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	 I am conscious of time restraints, so we might just stick to the petition.
1875	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Does Mr. Ó Dubhghaill wish to add to that?
1876	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	 Is Senator Buttimer okay with that? I will move on. I call Deputy Eugene Murphy.
1877	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	 Is Deputy Murphy happy enough?
1878	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	47	 I have a few questions myself. In practical terms, how do the oversight and working groups work? What are the groups' modalities? Do they meet on a regular basis? When do they reach their end state? What is the timeline for the completion of that work?
1879	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	49	 I do not wish to put words in anybody's mouth and I seek the witnesses' viewpoint but it could be argued that the process is still somewhat nebulous. We have the recommendations. They are very clear. There seems to have been a political welcome and the political mood music - forgive the pun - from the Ministers, Deputies Madigan and Naughten, has been quite positive, if their statements on 5 July and 28 April are anything to go by. There seems to be a clear sense of wanting to engage and wanting to work through to a solution. If I am interpreting the witnesses correctly, we still have something of a gap in terms of how the oversight group works and what the timelines are. It would be very useful for us, when I conclude proceedings here today, to not close any petition, pending further information in respect of the actual process, and to seek more definitive timelines in that regard.
1880	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	51	" On the point Mr. Ó Dubhghaill made earlier on the stream from Cúil Aodha, Baile Bhúirne and places like that, we have gone from ""Mise Éire"" right up to Jenny Greene. If one is talking about cultural output and the value, it is very difficult to put a monetary value on something which is so deeply imbedded, cultural and ingrained in the Irish psyche. I believe there is a clear thread between ""Mise Éire"" and Jenny Greene and people bopping about at Electric Picnic. There is that thread. The tie that binds is the orchestras. We should not lose sight of that. It is important that we, as individual Members of this Oireachtas, ensure that we find some mechanism to support their continuation in every way that we can. I believe I can reasonably speak for my fellow members here when I say that it is for us to give further consideration to what the witnesses have brought to us here today. It has been a very valuable contribution to our understanding. I know there are other mechanisms through which that can be done in this House but the Committee on Public Petitions is the one mechanism we have in which the citizen engages with us. When the citizen engages with us, raises this important issue and garners so many signatures, it is incumbent on us to ensure that we take some of the messages the witnesses have delivered today and feed them back into the political landscape. There is tremendous goodwill. The campaign around loving our orchestras is resonating deeply with anybody who has an appreciation of the cultural output of RTÉ. I thank the witnesses for their contributions here today. They have been very valuable. We will give this further consideration now. We are definitely more educated by virtue of our deliberations with the witnesses today. There are further questions concerning the process, to which this committee must give more consideration. Everybody has largely welcomed the report. I believe that the report is very digestible and easily understood. We just need to further interrogate the workings of the oversight and working group and perhaps hold a further discussion."
1881	SeanSherlock	Labour	16744.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-10 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	53	 I appreciate that.

We should keep Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan's petition open. I am getting a direction to the effect that we should correspond with Dublin City Council. I suggest we say to it that we do not accept the correspondence it has furnished to the committee. It states in it that the traditional location for the Christmas lights switching-on ceremony was on O'Connell Street. It seems it does not want to inconvenience people by asking the operator of the Luas cross-city line to stop operating it in order to accommodate the ceremony. Moreover, it seems there have been issues in managing the large crowds which have attended the lighting ceremony in recent years. The council has also stated it has created winter lights in Dublin city and brought Christmas lights and building projections to more locations and people than ever before. I think we all accept that the council is trying to do its best. Let us suppose I was a first, second, third or fourth generation Dubliner and going to see the switching on of the lights. It is a real family event, something that is synonymous with Dublin at Christmas time. It is firmly the view of the committee that some mechanism should be found to facilitate the process.
1908	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 There is no cross-city Luas line in Cork.
1909	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 There are no cars in Cork either in that area, but sin scéal eile. It is clearly the view of the committee that it has been progressive in seeking to make suggestions. Senator Buttimer's suggestion is laudable and one that could be communicated to Dublin City Council. The petition remains open and we will correspond with the council. We thank the petitioner, Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan, for having the wherewithal to address the issue to us. I propose that the committee adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 December. I thank members for their attendance.

1920	SeanSherlock	Labour	16841.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-15 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	 There is a proposal that we would discuss this further. What we have are the latest responses from the Department of Justice and Equality. The gaming and lotteries (amendment) Bill is still with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The general scheme of the gambling control Bill gives rise to the intention to establish an independent regulatory authority. There is arguably robust legislation coming down the line. The question is how should we seek to influence the acceleration of such legislation. It might be advisable to seek to have the Minister before the committee to discuss this issue specifically. I suggest the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is taking a lead role on this, might be the most appropriate Minister who might come before us. If that suggestion is agreeable, maybe we should propose that and see where we go from there.
1921	SeanSherlock	Labour	16841.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-15 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 There is a suggestion.

Is that agreed? Agreed. Moving on to petition No. P00040/18, the proposal is to forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition.

Before I ask for agreement on that, I want to state that the petition was deemed to be premature on the basis that the petition clearly said, ""The Irish people must decide on their own future instead of awaiting a Border poll from a nation that has blatantly dismissed their grievances and sentiments"". There is very clear language in the Good Friday Agreement in respect of the Border poll which we have all signed up to. We are all republicans, so we all have a perspective on the future of the island and there is a lot more common ground on that than people might think. Is it agreed that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00220/19 from Ms Laura Hackett. The petition concerns the well-being of breeding dogs in Ireland.

1965	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	 Apologies have been received from Deputies Dara Murphy and Heydon and Senator Ruane. I will now put my phone on airplane mode. The usual rules apply in respect of telecommunication.
1966	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00048/17 from Ms Anna McKenna who would like to see Drogheda, County Louth attain city status. Members have addressed some concerns about the issue at play and I want to give them a chance to intervene at this stage before we make a final determination on the petition. I invite Deputy Cassells to contribute.
1967	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 We have before us a proposal to keep the petition live and open. We must have regard to the response that we received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through its assistant secretary general. Once one reads the document, one realises that it does not address the issue of city status, which is the subject of the petition that we are dealing with today. On that basis, there is a proposal here to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Cassells has addressed his concerns about the population of 6,500 that would come from the Meath side and the issues addressed by Deputy O'Dowd in respect of the CSO projections about reaching city status within five years or thereabouts.
1968	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 Given the fact that the Department's response to this committee has not necessarily addressed, or adequately addressed I would contend, the issue of city status, there is a proposal here to keep the petition open, to correspond with the Department again and ask for further clarification in respect of the petition for city status, and to be very clear about that. There are other issues concerning the growth, development and planning issues. I respectfully suggest that they would be dealt with within the relevant line Department or line committees that deal with the environment and housing as that is the most appropriate way to do so.
1969	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 I propose that we ask members for their support to keep the petition open, correspond with the Department again and ask specifically about city status. Is that agreed?
1970	SeanSherlock	Labour	16884.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 The good people of Drogheda seated behind Deputy Cassells cannot see his face at the moment.

Is that agreed?
1981	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	 Yes. Is Senator Buttimer making a proposal?

1984	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 The petition remains open. We want to get a specific response from the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the specific question asked by the petitioner. There is a proposal to invite the Minister of State in, and Senator Ruane is making a proposal to invite one of the stakeholder groups that works in this specific area. Senator Ruane can make a formal proposal and seek agreement, then it is a matter for the committee to agree. Is she making such a proposal?

1986	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 That is one element of it. Is that agreed? Agreed. I will move on to the next petition. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00036/18 from Mr. Paul Kavanagh. The petition concerns the Fermoy weir on the River Blackwater in County Cork. I propose that we correspond with Cork County Council to ask for an update on the status of this issue and that we would forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and inform him that this petition remains open. I also propose that we invite the petitioner and possibly one other stakeholder to come before us in this committee for a short interaction in respect of discussing the issues that are at play concerning the River Blackwater in Fermoy. Is that agreed?
1987	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 The issue concerns the collapse of the weir on the River Blackwater in Fermoy. It is also in respect of the imposition or construction of a fish pass. There is a suggested breach of boat structures, which have to be repaired. There is also the question of whether Ireland is in compliance with EU directives in respect of the safe migration of fish, particularly salmon. That is causing significant consternation for fishing interests on the ground but also there is the question of whether the Government is to fund the repairs or whether because Cork County Council is the owner of the weir it has the obligation. There is also the question of what that budget would be. The petitioners are seeking to have the issue addressed and for clarity to be provided in respect of who, in effect, would foot the bill.
1988	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 It is a significant undertaking.
1989	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	 We have agreed the proposals in respect of that petition. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0008/19 from Mr. Darragh Fitzgerald. His petition would like to see the Freedom of Information, FOI, Act extended to the Office of the President. Do any members wish to comment?
1990	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	 What we propose is that we correspond with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for an update on the issue, when available, with a view to reviewing this within a six-month timeframe. We will forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and inform him that the petition remains open. That speaks partly to the concerns that have been agreed. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration today is Petition No. P00012/19 from Mr. Robert Ewing. The petition appears to concern a dispute over land ownership and subsequent legal proceedings dating back to the 1980s. What we propose to do is to deem the petition inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order 111C (i)(a), and to correspond with the petitioner informing him the petition is inadmissible and to return the supporting documents. Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank Senator Kelleher and Deputy Denise Mitchell for their time on the committee and in their place I formally welcome Senator Ruane and Deputy Buckley. I look forward to working with them. I also note the apologies from Deputy Heydon. I propose that we adjourn the meeting until Wednesday, 10 April 2019 at 1.30 p.m. Is that agreed? Agreed.

We will forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and inform him that the petition remains open. That speaks partly to the concerns that have been agreed. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration today is Petition No. P00012/19 from Mr. Robert Ewing. The petition appears to concern a dispute over land ownership and subsequent legal proceedings dating back to the 1980s. What we propose to do is to deem the petition inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order 111C (i)(a), and to correspond with the petitioner informing him the petition is inadmissible and to return the supporting documents. Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank Senator Kelleher and Deputy Denise Mitchell for their time on the committee and in their place I formally welcome Senator Ruane and Deputy Buckley. I look forward to working with them. I also note the apologies from Deputy Heydon. I propose that we adjourn the meeting until Wednesday, 10 April 2019 at 1.30 p.m. Is that agreed? Agreed.

The usual provisos apply regarding the use of mobile phones. I propose we now go into private session to deal with some matters before resuming in public session.
2004	SeanSherlock	Labour	16996.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	 I thank Mr. Ward. That concludes this matter. I thank the witnesses for appearing before us today. The petition will remain open so the committee will meet to deliberate on the evidence that has been heard and will follow up at a later stage. We will move on to consideration of public petitions. The committee will now make formal decisions on six petitions. Petition P00015/19 from Ms Mmoley Taylor would like to see Irish citizenship offered to all British spouses of Irish nationals who are currently resident in Ireland and have been married for over five years. This petition cites the uncertainty of Brexit and potential hardships for British citizens as reasons for doing this. Does any member wish to contribute to this matter? I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition P00016/19 from Ms Molly O'Brien would like to see visa exemptions for non-EU spouses of Irish citizens in the case of short-stay visits only. The petition cites the excessive documentation required for the application and lead-in in time required in the application process. End of Take This is the first of two petitions by the same petitioner on a similar theme. Unless any member wishes to contribute on this matter, I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00024/19 is from Ms Laura Moore. This petitioner would like to see the immediate end to all badger culling and the implementation of a tuberculosis, TB, vaccination programme for badgers. The petition states that a vaccination programme was proposed by the Government in 2018 but has not been actioned. Does any member wish to contribute to this matter? No. I propose that we keep this petition open. Is that agreed? Agreed. We will correspond further with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ask for further details on the roll-out of the vaccination programme, including a timeline. We will correspond with the petitioner and inform her that the petition remains open. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00015/19 is from Mr. Joseph Guerin. The petitioner objects to an official visit to the State by dignitaries and cites security fears. Does any member wish to contribute to this matter? No. I propose that we deem this petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(a). Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00030/19 is from Ms Molly O'Brien. This petition concerns the documentation required in the Irish visa application process. The petitioner specifically references the requirement for six months of bank statements from applicants. The petitioner considers this a breach of privacy. As an alternative, this petition suggests that a certificate of balance be used. That would show the balance of an applicant's account on a certain date. Does any member wish to contribute to this matter? No. I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close this petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00011/18 is from Ms Josephine Boles. This petition concerns mandatory training for Irish mainstream schoolteachers on spectrum disorders. This petitioner would like to see mandatory training given to all primary and post-primary mainstream teachers in the various elements of spectrum disorders. This would include autism, Asperger's syndrome, dyspraxia, developmental co-ordination disorder, DCD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and sensory processing disorder. Does any member wish to contribute to this matter? No. I propose that we forward a copy of the Official Report of the meeting and the documents supplied by the Department of Education and Skills and AsIAm to the petitioner and also inform her that the petition remains open. Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank everybody for their attendance at this meeting. I propose that the committee adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 July 2019. Is that agreed? Agreed.

2006	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	 I propose that we dispense with some official business before we hear from our guests, who are very welcome. Before we commence, the usual provisos apply regarding the use of mobile phones. They need to be switched off or put on airplane mode. This meeting needs to adjourn at 4 p.m. to facilitate a meeting of another committee in this room. Petition No. P0003/17 is from Mr. Brian Houlihan. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response, including submissions received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00011/19 is from Mr. Ben Marren. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport be forwarded to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. P00014/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. P00022/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality and a copy of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. P00041/19, it is deemed that the petition is inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order 111C (1)(a), under which a petition is inadmissible if it requests the Dáil to do anything other than the Dáil has the power to do. Is that agreed? Agreed.
2007	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	 Petition No. P00044/19 from Mr. Robert Ewing concerns a dispute over land ownership and subsequent court cases dating back to the 1980s. It is proposed that the committee deem the petition inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order 111C (1)(f) and correspond with the petitioner informing him that this petition is deemed inadmissible and returning the supporting documents. Is that agreed? Agreed.
2008	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 We will now deal with Petition No. P00036/18 from Mr. Paul Kavanagh, which is the subject of our public consultation today. I welcome the witnesses and the people in the Visitors Gallery. This petition concerns the Fermoy weir on the river Blackwater in County Cork. It states that the State has failed to adhere to the water framework directive and that the structures of the weir have deteriorated which, in turn, is affecting the safe migration of salmon and other species. This is the third time that the committee has considered this petition. In accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of attendees to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I wish to advise the witnesses that opening statements and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statement and submissions from the witnesses have been circulated to members. I remind the witnesses that their presentations should not exceed ten minutes in duration but they may be shorter. The shorter the presentation, the more time there will be for a questions and answers session in order that we can shed some light on the issues at hand. I welcome Mr. Niall Healy and Mr. Kevin Morey from Cork County Council; Mr. Denis Maher, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Dr. Greg Forde, head of operations, Inland Fisheries Ireland; Mr John Sydenham and Mr. Ezra MacManamon, Office of Public Works; Ms Cliona O'Brien, wildlife inspector in the scientific unit, National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS; and Mr. Colin Byrne and Ms Deirdre Dunworth, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. I invite Mr. Niall Healy to make his opening statement.

2010	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 I apologise, but there is definitely a phone on. It is impossible to record the proceedings if a phone is on. Will our guests check that all their phones are off?
2011	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 I thank Mr. Morey and Mr. Healy for their presentation. I invite Mr. Maher to make his opening statement. I understand it is a joint statement on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Inland Fisheries Ireland.
2012	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 I thank Mr. Maher. I propose we hear from Mr. John Sydenham.
2013	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 I thank Mr. Sydenham. Mr. Byrne has the floor on behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.
2014	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 I thank Mr. Byrne. That concludes the presentations. Do members wish to pose questions? I call Deputy Buckley.
2015	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 Are the Deputy's questions directed at any of our guests in particular?
2016	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Do those proceedings specifically relate to the weir on the River Blackwater?
2017	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 Briefly, does this form part of the statutory consents required?
2018	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	 Does Deputy Buckley have any further questions?
2019	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	 I will go straight into some questions. My first is for the local authority representatives. I do not think there is any ambiguity about the fact that the structure is owned by Cork County Council. That is correct, is it not?
2020	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	 We have a submission here which is an observation from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It is one of the documents which is part of the file before us. I will quote directly from it. It is also understood that Fermoy Town Council (now Cork County Council) originally agreed the repair works would be undertaken by OPW as part of the Fermoy Flood Relief Scheme, and would be paid for by the Council. However, the Council did not proceed with repair works as part of the Flood Relief Scheme, but rather advised DCCAE [that is, the Department] that the works on the ancillary fish pass solution were included as part of the tender process for Phase II of the Flood Relief Works. The Council then advised that as tender prices received were in excess of what was originally envisaged, they were proceeding with the Flood Relief Works but would be investigating the procedures for retendering separately for the fish pass. Can either Mr. Healy or Mr. Morey clarify how they interpret this statement from a local authority perspective?
2021	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	" I assume Mr. Sydenham is, from an OPW point of view, corroborating that statement by Cork County Council in respect of the observation made by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Forgive me if we are getting into surreal territory here but, as a local public representative and a Teachta Dála, I find it extraordinary that we have all the silos of Government in one room. Whether a local authority, IFI, whichever Department or the OPW, there is a certain amount of: ""We do not hold the funds to do the job."" The points have been made by previous speakers. There needs to be a whole-of-government approach to this. We take at face value and in good faith every statement made today. Regarding overall Government expenditure, I do not buy the arguments about voted expenditure or voted funding and line Departments. Creative mechanisms can always be found to find a relatively small parcel of money to do a job that would meet all the State's obligations, and that is the point. It is the State that has these obligations in respect of EU legislation and directives. As Chairman, I perceive that we are hiding behind certain directives. We are saying that there is a statutory obligation and that statutory consents are required. This has been very enlightening because it has highlighted the clear line of demarcation that seems to exist between Departments in respect of who holds the can. The times in which we are living are not as constrained as 2011. Considering the figures of €1.34 million and €1.7 million in their entirety in the context of overall Government expenditure, one would be hopeful that all stakeholders could come to some agreed, co-ordinated and unified position in tandem with the stakeholders on the ground so that this could be funded. I fail to understand what the €350,000 will buy. We have heard from TJ O'Connor and Associates and White Young Green. There have been other reports on the needs in this regard. For the sake of argument, we will call what is on the table a northern relief pass. There is also a repair and restoration project. They represent two discrete budget lines. The council says that it does not have the funding to carry out either project. It has extended its lámh amach to the Minister for a few bob, a small amount of money, for more consultation. Does it not understand why the people of Fermoy are exasperated and weary at this stage?"
2022	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 My understanding is that the local authority is seeking a loan facility from the European Investment Bank, EIB. Will Mr. Morey confirm that? I refer to a loan facility for general purposes.
2023	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	 Has that loan facility been secured? How much is available under it?
2024	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	 Cork County Council has publicised the fact that it is seeking this facility.
2025	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	 The public perception was certainly that it had been secured, if I may be bold enough to say so.
2026	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	 Everybody, including the various stakeholders here, agrees that Cork County Council owns the structure and has responsibilities in respect of heritage, conservation, protecting local amenity, and the migration of fish under the habitats directive and the water framework directive. If the Department of the Minister, Deputy Murphy, is saying, as I interpret it, that it is an issue for the OPW or Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is saying that it is a matter for the council, and the OPW is saying that it is not a matter for its office, it seems that all roads lead back to the council. In the absence of any signal from the witnesses representing the line Departments or of a political cheque being written, is it beyond the bounds of possibility that this could be funded through an EIB loan facility? I am not playing devil's advocate here. I am trying to find a solution or to find some ground on which we can start talking about solutions. Would Cork County Council consider such a proposal?
2027	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	 To unpack what Mr. Healy has said, the loan facility is not guaranteed. It has not been secured and therefore the repair and restoration of the weir and fish pass is not being considered as a potential project to fund through it. Is that a fair assumption?
2028	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	52	 The council is not considering the repair and restoration of the weir in Fermoy and a northern bypass as projects to be funded through the loan facility that may be offered by the EIB.
2029	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	 It falls outside it. That is the unambiguous answer I am looking for. If it cannot be funded through the loan facility, we are now back to either the local authority's own resources or central government. It is effectively one or the other. Is that a fair assessment?
2030	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	56	 How much does the council have in the kitty at the moment? It is mapping out the potential cost of works. Does it have money in the kitty to meet its statutory obligations? Does it have anything put aside?
2031	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	58	 Is Mr. Healy referring to the seed funding of €175,000?
2032	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	60	 That is all the council has towards the cost of this project.
2033	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	62	 Before I bring Mr. Morey back in, did Mr. Sydenham want to say anything? He was signalling.
2034	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	 Does it include any parameters?
2035	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	 I think I understand what Mr. Morey is saying. We live in a world of couched language here. Will Mr. Morey distil his point so that I can internalise and understand it? Is he saying that the parameters or loan criteria are being set out in general terms?
2036	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	69	 We are back to central government again. There is a political prerogative which has to be brought to bear here. That seems to be the bottom line. Rather than concluding matters here, with the agreement of the committee, I suggest that we have to digest what has been said. Some of us are familiar with this issue and have an overview of it because we have had meetings at individual level with the witnesses over the years. I believe that this may be the first time that all of the stakeholders have come into one room and given their positions. We now know what those positions are, as frustrating as it may be to hear him, although I say that respectfully. We are talking about individual silos and not a cross-governmental approach to this. I accept the witnesses' bona fides. They all have vast experience and we have had personal experience of that in the past, with quite robust interactions in some instances. With the permission of the one member who remains, Deputy Buckley, I propose to express our gratitude and then take the witnesses' submissions under advisement and consider them further. Perhaps the committee will then draw up a set of conclusions based on the submissions received. The petition would remain open. Did Ms O'Brien wish to speak again?
2037	SeanSherlock	Labour	17010.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	71	 Ms O'Brien has just opened another silo but we will engage with the Department. The witnesses will all be back in three weeks and officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be here. I appreciate Ms O'Brien's intervention. We are trying to distil this and reach a fair assessment of what the positions are. Some of us have been living and breathing this issue and the people of Fermoy know the issue inside out at this stage. It should be accepted that there is one stakeholder group that involves local angling and rowing interests and has an interest in local amenities, including providing for people with disabilities. Rowing has become a key sport in the country and we have to recognise Fermoy's status in that regard. The Munster Blackwater is a key reference river for salmon, although there are questions about that status. We all want to find a solution and we will all work with Government to that end. I propose that we leave the petition open. I thank the witnesses for attending. I believe all documents, no matter how indicative they are, even drawings or schematics that have been laid before us, should be placed in the public domain. That includes the local authority document but the witnesses can discuss that with their colleagues. It does not necessarily mean that they will be interpreted by people accessing them in the public domain in a literal fashion if it is clearly communicated that the documents from the consulting engineers, TJ O'Connor & Associates, are merely indicative high level documents and are not to be interpreted any other way. I note the request that the witnesses have made about not having these be published on the website. I ask that they reconsider that. The committee tries to publish all materials and keep everything online so that everybody has access. The witnesses' public statement has been to the effect that it is a high level document and not a finished document. The witnesses might consider that, if Mr. Morey and Mr. Healy want to come back to us. We will send the opening statements to the petitioner. We intend to keep the petition open because there is more work to be done on this. We are genuinely grateful to the witnesses for attending and giving their time. This is our final meeting before the recess. I thank everybody who has submitted a petition and those who have attended. I thank the staff in the secretariat who do an excellent job in preparing documents and interfacing with the public. They are the A team in that regard. I thank all of the staff who record these proceedings and our press people. Much work goes into preparing a committee meeting and I acknowledge those who work on our behalf.

It should be accepted that there is one stakeholder group that involves local angling and rowing interests and has an interest in local amenities, including providing for people with disabilities. Rowing has become a key sport in the country and we have to recognise Fermoy's status in that regard. The Munster Blackwater is a key reference river for salmon, although there are questions about that status. We all want to find a solution and we will all work with Government to that end. I propose that we leave the petition open. I thank the witnesses for attending. I believe all documents, no matter how indicative they are, even drawings or schematics that have been laid before us, should be placed in the public domain. That includes the local authority document but the witnesses can discuss that with their colleagues. It does not necessarily mean that they will be interpreted by people accessing them in the public domain in a literal fashion if it is clearly communicated that the documents from the consulting engineers, TJ O'Connor & Associates, are merely indicative high level documents and are not to be interpreted any other way. I note the request that the witnesses have made about not having these be published on the website. I ask that they reconsider that. The committee tries to publish all materials and keep everything online so that everybody has access. The witnesses' public statement has been to the effect that it is a high level document and not a finished document. The witnesses might consider that, if Mr. Morey and Mr. Healy want to come back to us. We will send the opening statements to the petitioner. We intend to keep the petition open because there is more work to be done on this. We are genuinely grateful to the witnesses for attending and giving their time. This is our final meeting before the recess. I thank everybody who has submitted a petition and those who have attended. I thank the staff in the secretariat who do an excellent job in preparing documents and interfacing with the public. They are the A team in that regard. I thank all of the staff who record these proceedings and our press people. Much work goes into preparing a committee meeting and I acknowledge those who work on our behalf.

The Munster Blackwater is a key reference river for salmon, although there are questions about that status. We all want to find a solution and we will all work with Government to that end. I propose that we leave the petition open. I thank the witnesses for attending. I believe all documents, no matter how indicative they are, even drawings or schematics that have been laid before us, should be placed in the public domain. That includes the local authority document but the witnesses can discuss that with their colleagues. It does not necessarily mean that they will be interpreted by people accessing them in the public domain in a literal fashion if it is clearly communicated that the documents from the consulting engineers, TJ O'Connor & Associates, are merely indicative high level documents and are not to be interpreted any other way. I note the request that the witnesses have made about not having these be published on the website. I ask that they reconsider that. The committee tries to publish all materials and keep everything online so that everybody has access. The witnesses' public statement has been to the effect that it is a high level document and not a finished document. The witnesses might consider that, if Mr. Morey and Mr. Healy want to come back to us. We will send the opening statements to the petitioner. We intend to keep the petition open because there is more work to be done on this. We are genuinely grateful to the witnesses for attending and giving their time. This is our final meeting before the recess. I thank everybody who has submitted a petition and those who have attended. I thank the staff in the secretariat who do an excellent job in preparing documents and interfacing with the public. They are the A team in that regard. I thank all of the staff who record these proceedings and our press people. Much work goes into preparing a committee meeting and I acknowledge those who work on our behalf.

I propose that we leave the petition open. I thank the witnesses for attending. I believe all documents, no matter how indicative they are, even drawings or schematics that have been laid before us, should be placed in the public domain. That includes the local authority document but the witnesses can discuss that with their colleagues. It does not necessarily mean that they will be interpreted by people accessing them in the public domain in a literal fashion if it is clearly communicated that the documents from the consulting engineers, TJ O'Connor & Associates, are merely indicative high level documents and are not to be interpreted any other way. I note the request that the witnesses have made about not having these be published on the website. I ask that they reconsider that. The committee tries to publish all materials and keep everything online so that everybody has access. The witnesses' public statement has been to the effect that it is a high level document and not a finished document. The witnesses might consider that, if Mr. Morey and Mr. Healy want to come back to us. We will send the opening statements to the petitioner. We intend to keep the petition open because there is more work to be done on this. We are genuinely grateful to the witnesses for attending and giving their time. This is our final meeting before the recess. I thank everybody who has submitted a petition and those who have attended. I thank the staff in the secretariat who do an excellent job in preparing documents and interfacing with the public. They are the A team in that regard. I thank all of the staff who record these proceedings and our press people. Much work goes into preparing a committee meeting and I acknowledge those who work on our behalf.

2094	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	7	 The point is well made. I will move on. The decision is that we will forward a copy of the response from the Department of Finance to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00023/19 is from Mr. Wayne Hester. He would like to see 30 April designated a public holiday in honour of Riverdance. It is decided that we will forward a copy of the response from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
2095	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	9	 Petition No. P00034/19 is from Ms Tanya O'Neill, who would like to see new labelling on all non-recyclable packaging stating that it is not recyclable. We have agreed that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner. We will not quite close the petition yet but will give it further consideration.
2096	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	13	 The proposal before us is that we communicate with Repak and perhaps ask it to consider the content of the petition and respond on the work it is doing. To be fair, the response from the Department is comprehensive in answering the issues raised by the petitioner. We are going off on a tangent to the extent that it is not possible to adhere to what is being specifically sought in the petition. However, members understand the importance of packaging, which is one of the biggest issues in the area of climate action. It would be useful for the committee to gain an understanding of the position of Repak and industry representatives on this agenda. Is it agreed that we keep the petition open, communicate with Repak and see where we go from there? Agreed. Petition No. P00035/19 seeks to have more funding allocated to create additional and larger autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and special classes in mainstream schools. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?
2097	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	17	 Is there a proposal before us to keep the petition open?
2098	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	20	 A report was published by the relevant committee in October 2018. Like every other public representative here, we are all inundated with people contacting us about a range of issues in this area, from assessments to issues concerning bricks and mortar and the provision of capital expenditure. If we look at the issue narrowly through the prism of Clondalkin, I propose that we close the petition.
2099	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	22	 There is a wider issue and the solution may be as simple as this committee communicating with the Department and the relevant line committee, as per Standing Orders, asking if there has been any response or update to the 2018 report. It is such a live issue. The numbers are increasing all the time. I propose that we close the petition but write to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and ask the committee to have regard to the petition we received. Is that agreed?
2100	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	24	 That is agreed. It is deemed that Petition No. P00042/19 is inadmissible, as per Standing Orders, and we will inform the petitioner as to the reasons. Is that agreed? Agreed. I understand Deputy Buckley wants to raise an issue under any other business.
2101	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	26	 I propose that we discuss the matter in private session, before we adjourn. Is that agreed? Agreed.
2102	SeanSherlock	Labour	17122.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-23 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	27	 I refer Deputy Buckley to the discussion we have just had on the petition we received from the Save Fermoy Weir and Save Our Salmon group. We are in receipt of correspondence from the group rebutting in a comprehensive document the submissions laid before the committee and spoken to by individual stakeholders on 3 July. It is proposed that we note the correspondence from the stakeholders in Fermoy and submit the latest correspondence to each of the stakeholders, including the line Departments and State agencies that were party to the particular petition hearing at this committee, asking them to respond to each of the points raised in rebuttal to the points made on 3 July 2019. Is that agreed? Agreed.

2113	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	 Good afternoon. We are now in public session. On Petition No. 00021/19, the decision of the committee is to forward a copy of the response from the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. 00033/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
2114	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	3	 I agree with Deputy Cassells. The two issues that are before us are absolutely worthy of discussion. One's instinct is of course to seek to keep the matters on which they are based alive, but for the purposes of the Standing Orders of the committee and so on, we are constrained to a certain extent in terms of seeking to further the issues. There are plenty of other line committees through which the broader issues that Deputy Cassells referred to can be addressed, such as the committee which addressed it last night.
2115	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	5	 I thank Deputy Cassells. We have agreed to forward a copy of Petition No. 00033/19 and close it. On Petition No. 00038/19, I am seeking the committee's agreement that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. 00039/19, it is proposed that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank you for your attendance at the meeting today and I propose that we adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 20 November. Is that agreed? Agreed.

2119	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	 We will now move to the consideration of public petitions. Petition 00047/19 seeks to triple the number of Irish resident election observers placed on foreign election observation missions in the next 12 months. The petition states that Ireland is lagging behind in sending Irish observers abroad. Do any members wish to contribute?
2120	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	3	 I thank Senator Buttimer. I call Deputy Buckley.
2121	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	5	 The proposal is that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition 00048/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner with a copy of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, advising the petitioner that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has held hearings and is currently preparing a report on online harassment and harmful communications and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition is 00049/19. I think Deputy Buckley has a view on this.
2122	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	7	 I thank Deputy Buckley. We have a proposal to keep the petition open subject to further correspondence. Deputy Cassells would like to respond.
2123	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	9	 Would any other members like to contribute? No. There is a proposal that we keep the petition open pending the publication of the expected report. Is that agreed? Agreed. We will still forward a copy of the response to the petitioner, but we will not close the petition. Deputy Buckley would like to respond.
2124	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	11	 To clarify, that petition remains open. We have received, as members will know, correspondence from the petitioners in response to the submissions made by the various State agencies. That petition is by no means closed.
2125	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	13	 My understanding is that we are still awaiting correspondence, but there may come a time where we need to correspond with the agencies that have been corresponded with by the secretariat in respect of when we will receive a reply. It is fair to say that petitions have to be dealt with in a timely fashion as well and particularly where we are corresponding with State agencies or State-funded agencies and particularly North-South bodies. I would hold the view that there is a reasonable amount of time that one would give to allow people to respond, but one's patience wears thin as well if one perceives that the process here is being delayed in any way. That petition very much remains open.
2126	SeanSherlock	Labour	17164.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-04 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	15	 Thank you. I propose that the committee adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 January 2020. Is that agreed? Agreed.

2135	SeanSherlock	Labour	12608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 How much will that benefit farmers?
2136	SeanSherlock	Labour	12608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	124	 I know a lot about farmers.
2137	SeanSherlock	Labour	12608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	122	" As it is now 8.15 p.m. I am required to put the following question in accordance with the resolution of the Dáil of this day: ""That Dáil Éireann approves the nominations by the Taoiseach for the appointment by the President to be members of the Government."""
2138	SeanSherlock	Labour	12608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	124	" As it is now 8.15 p.m. I am required to put the following question in accordance with the resolution of the Dáil of this day: ""That Dáil Éireann approves the nominations by the Taoiseach for the appointment by the President to be members of the Government."""
2139	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	284	 I join other Members in congratulating the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his elevation and wish him well for the future.
2140	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	 If I am in order——
2141	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	 I thank sincerely the people of Cork East for the privilege they have afforded me by electing me to the House.  I look forward to working for them and on their behalf. To be blunt, the Minister's reply has been heard many times before.  He did not answer the question as I posed it and as it pertained to the Greencore site specifically.  Although he met the Taoiseach and others in March 2006, much progress has been made since, in so far as a special local area plan has been adopted for Mallow.  I was glad to participate in drawing up the plan, in which we designated 30 acres within the site to be used as a high environmental, quality enterprise and employment zone.  The question on everyone's lips in Mallow and north Cork is whether an enterprise will be located on the site.  The north Cork and wider east Cork region has been dealt a savage blow in terms of job losses and the people of Mallow have high expectations for the site.  The Minister should state whether there is a specific proposal because before the general election a Government backbencher made an announcement to the effect that an American company would make an announcement on job creation.  Was the Minister aware of this so-called announcement?  If such negotiations took place, did they bear fruit?
2142	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 As for the Government's support for the workers when the redundancy argument was ongoing, it washed its hands of the issue.
2143	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	 Were it not for the intervention of Mallow Town Council and the members of Cork County Council, I believe strongly they would not have received their redundancy payments.
