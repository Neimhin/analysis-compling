15008	SeanSherlock	Labour	13489.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	118	 Under Standing Order 87 the following message will be sent to the Clerk of the Dáil: The Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights has completed its consideration of the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2009 and has made amendments thereto.
15009	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	8	" I move amendment No. 1: In page 3, subsection (2), line 30, after ""provisions"" to insert the following: "", provided that Part 2 shall come into operation in its entirety on a specified day”. There is something of a contradiction between giving the Minister power to commence the Act in an open-ended fashion and to commence different sections at different times in section 1(2), whereas the commencement date for section 2 presupposes that the whole of Part 2 will commence on a specified single date."
15010	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	10	 I thank the Minister for his response.  I will withdraw the amendment.
15011	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	14	 My amendment is along the same lines as that of Deputy Flanagan.  We seek a certain amount of flexibility to reflect changes in monetary values to allow the Minister of the day, by order, to amend the amounts so the Bill is not outdated in terms of the tabular form in which the fines are set out.  That is the justification.
15012	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 I would have thought our amendment on this issue would have developed an efficiency in the system in terms of how one deals with it into the future.  If it can be looked at again on Report Stage I would accept that.
15013	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	20	" I move amendment No. 3: In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: "" ""Oireachtas"" includes the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann.""."
15014	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	23	" I move amendment No. 5: In page 4, subsection (1), line 17, after ""enacted"" to insert ""amended by or"". The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate the interpretation of the legislation amended by section 9 of the Bill.  The intention of section 3(1) is that, in future, legislation will use the simple expression ""class A fine"" rather than the long-winded expression ""class A fine within the meaning of Part 2 of the Fines Act 2009"".  It is important to get the terminology off to the right start."
15015	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	35	" I move amendment No. 17: In page 9, subsection (1), line 21, after ""the"" to insert ""fine or"". The amendment is designed to cover a case where the statute has a fixed fine rather than a maximum fine."
15016	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	37	 I accept the Minister's response.
15017	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	39	" I move amendment No. 19: In page 9, subsection (1), line 29, after ""number"" to insert the following: ""or to a fine not exceeding €10,000, whichever is the greater"". Section 7(5) of the 2007 version of this Bill sets forth a minimum fine on indictment of €10,000 prior to the commencement date.  This has disappeared from the Bill although it seems an appropriate provision to maintain the hierarchy of penalties as between summary, which carry a maximum of €5,000, and indictment.  The amendment proposes reinserting this."
15018	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	42	" I move amendment No. 22: In page 10, subsection (1), line 7, to delete ""within the meaning of Part 2 of the Fines Act 2009”. This amendment is linked to the earlier amendment regarding the interpretation of subsequent legislation.  It suggests that future legislation should not use the long-winded phrase ""class A fine within the meaning of Part 2 of the Fines Act 2009""."
15019	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	57	 I speak as a layman, not a solicitor or lawyer.  Forgive my seeming ignorance, but the Minister says the section addresses indexation.  In the case of earlier amendments relating to inflation, the Minister said they must be dealt with by primary legislation.  Does this section override that?
15020	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	63	" I move amendment No. 25: In page 11, line 13, after ""income"" to insert the following: ""and the amount and nature of the person's annual outgoings"". I will address the three amendments.  The Minister has stated the ultimate aim is to try and keep as many people out of prison as possible.  That is the aim of these amendments also.  The Minister speaks with some sympathy of the need to ensure that people's circumstances are taken into account.  What we seek through these amendments is to try and get as full a picture as possible of an individual's circumstances, before a decision is made as to the sanction to be applied.  Amendment No. 25 proposes the court should be required to consider an offender's outgoings as well as income.  The purpose of amendment No. 26 is to ensure the court considers all assets, not just real or personal property, and debts due to the person.  There could be other assets that do not fall within the provisions of the Bill as drafted.  These might include intellectual property, for example.  The purpose of amendment No. 27 is to delete paragraph (d) because an earlier amendment proposes to amalgamate that paragraph with a general paragraph, (b), dealing with assets. These three amendments act as a precursor to later amendments, Nos. 28, 29 and 32.  We believe that if the purpose of the legislation is to try and keep as many people out of prison as possible, the State must try and create the necessary conditions by which that can occur.  Statistically, one does not find many rich people in prison as a result of non-payment of fines.  Those in prison are mainly those people who are more marginalised.  While I agree some sanction is necessary, I ask the Minister to ensure we create a situation whereby their financial circumstances are taken into account to a greater degree than in the Bill as drafted."
15021	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	66	" I move amendment No. 28: In page 11, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection: ""(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), where a person is convicted of an offence for which a fine or a sentence of imprisonment, or both, may be imposed, the court— (a) shall consider whether a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case; (b) shall, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, take into account the person’s financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine to impose in respect of the offence; (c) shall not, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case but that, having regard to the person’s financial circumstances, undue hardship would be caused by the imposition of a fine of any amount greater than a nominal amount, impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of such a fine if a sentence of imprisonment would not be appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, but may in that event direct the payment of the fine by instalments for such period as the court shall fix, but without prejudice to the power of the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of payment of a fine in such amount as the court considers is within the capacity of the defendant to pay.”. This amendment strengthens the amendments we put forward earlier.  We suggest that where a person of full age is convicted of an offence, the court shall, in determining the amount of the fine, if any, to impose in respect of the offence, take into account the person's financial circumstances or difficulties, as is most likely the case.  The purpose of the amendment is to address the situation where fine and-or imprisonment are available to the court and to ensure that imprisonment is not imposed simply because the defendant does not have the means to pay what would otherwise be an appropriate fine.  We ask for some leniency for those most impoverished who find themselves before the courts that their circumstances be taken into account.  That is the justification for that amendment."
15022	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	68	 Amendment No. 29 seeks to insert section 15(3) into a more logical place in the Bill.  The purpose of amendment No. 32 is to make clear that imprisonment should not be imposed for failure to pay a fine which is caused by the inability of a person to pay the fine.  If people are not able to pay and can prove they are unable to pay then they should not be sentenced to imprisonment.
15023	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	70	 I accept that.  For what type of offence does the Minister envisage that a community service order would be carried out?  Does he envisage it would be for a specific type of offence?
15024	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	72	 I accept that.  If a person reneges on a fine would the community service order be for X number of hours?
15025	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	75	 I take it that the Minister will revisit amendment No. 32.
15026	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	77	 I appreciate that.
15027	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	82	 The amendment goes some way towards addressing the issue of a person's outgoings, assuming that any such information with regard to financial circumstances is made available to the court and assuming that a person's outgoings can be included in that particular provision.  If that is the case it lends weight to the idea that an overall view is taken of a person's circumstances before a decision is made.  I welcome the amendment.
15028	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	91	" I move amendment No. 33: In page 12, subsection (1), line 36, after ""fine,"" to insert ""or upon the court's own motion,"". The purpose of this amendment is to allow the court to impose a fine by instalment on its own motion, without the individual having to make an application.  In the absence of our amendment the court must first impose a blanket fine and the defendant would have to apply for an instalment order.  The court would then make the instalment order.  The court is not permitted to make an instalment order from the outset.  This is unduly cumbersome and we suggest the court be given that discretion. The purpose of amendment No. 34 is to set a lower threshold for the court in making an instalment order.  We contend that for the court to be satisfied would involve quite a high level of proof.  The amendment proposes that it appears to the court as a more satisfactory test.  That is a self-explanatory justification for the amendments."
15029	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	93	 I see the logic of the Minister's response.  On that basis, I will withdraw my amendment.
15030	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	94	" I move amendment No. 34: In page 12, subsection (1), line 36, to delete ""the court is satisfied"" and substitute ""it appears to the court""."
15031	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	99	 No.  I agree with the thrust of Deputy Flanagan's comments.  It is fine by me.
15032	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	103	 I move amendment No. 39: In page 13, lines 44 and 45, to delete subsection (9) Subsection (9) prohibits the courts from allowing payment by instalments in relation to a fine of €100 or less.  However, in our view there would be many people who would find it difficult to pay fines of €100 or less at one time and may require that  the payment be made in instalments.  In this amendment, we are trying to provide for those people who are issued with a fine of €100 or less to pay it off in instalments.
15033	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	105	 The reason we tabled that amendment is that I know people who are in arrears with the local authority for refuse charges to the tune of €200 to €300, which on the grand scale of things seems quite a small amount, but who are paying the local authority as little as €5 per week to reduce that debt.  There will be instances where fines are imposed on people in similar circumstances who are most likely to carry multiple debts, for whom €100 will be a significant amount. I understand the point the Minister made about striking the balance between the fine being instigated in the first instance and the need to pay it.  If the Minister would look at this issue again before Report Stage with a view to ensuring that for fines of €100 or less, there could be a minimum or maximum number of instalments to bear out the point he made about the number of transactions vis-à-vis the Courts Service.  I want to ensure that the Minister takes cognisance of the very small proportion of people for whom fines of €100 or less will be quite significant.
15034	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	107	 I ask the Minister to look at it again and come back to us with the exact statistics.
15035	SeanSherlock	Labour	13495.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	109	 The Minister cannot say the vast majority of fines relate to road traffic offences.

I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together as all three amendments are to section 2. Section 2 is the interpretation section of the Bill and provides for the definitions. Amendment No. 1 is to provide a definition of ""duties of customs"", which is used throughout the Bill. The definition will ensure that the phrase will have the same meaning in the Bill as it has in the EU customs legislation. Amendment No. 2 deletes the definition of ""other Member States"", which on an analysis of the Bill following its publication, was found to be no longer needed. Amendment No. 3 amends the current definition of ""officer of customs"" in the Bill as published. The purpose of the amendment is to widen the inclusion text to provide for the inclusion in the definition of ""officer of customs"" of an officer of the Revenue Commissioners."

The effect of the amendments, if accepted, would be to place in section 6 a legal requirement on the Minister for Finance to make regulations as to how controls of vessels and aircraft are to be applied to foreign military naval craft and foreign military aircraft, respectively, which land in the State. At present section 6 does not contain provisions relating to the control of either vessels or aircraft arriving into or departing from the State. Therefore, the two amendments are not relevant to the section. Provisions relating to the control of vessels and aircraft are, however, contained in sections 8 to 11, inclusive. It is the intention that the Revenue Commissioners will make regulations under these sections specifying the arrangements that will apply to different types and classes of vessels and aircraft arriving in or departing the State. Under section 39, regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners regarding, inter alia, the procedures relating to conveyances, including vessels and aircraft, are to be laid before the Dáil. However, on the substantive point in both amendments, namely, the controls that are to be applied to foreign military naval craft and foreign military aircraft which land in the State, such aircraft or vessels are not liable to inspection or search due to internationally accepted principle and customary law on sovereign immunity. Essentially, there is no right in international law for any state's military aircraft to enter the sovereign airspace of another state nor is there a right of naval vessels to enter the territorial waters of another state. Entry requires the consent of the state concerned and, of course, there is no obligation to grant it. However, once granted, the vessel or aircraft concerned enjoys sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction of the consenting state and if it violates any conditions attached to that consent, the only remedy available to the consenting state is to require it to leave its waters or airspace. As the proposed amendments would impinge upon internationally agreed principles and customs law, the Government cannot accept these amendments.
15069	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	12	 This is the Customs Bill 2014. If the Deputy wishes to bring forward a Bill or an amendment to other legislation to address the issues outlined by him there are appropriate ways of doing so. The Government is not in a position to accept these two amendments because, as I have stated, this is a customs Bill. Permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports is subject to policy conditions, including that the aircraft carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of any military exercise or operation. As I said, this is a customs Bill. Arguably, it is a consolidation of legislation dating back to the 1800s in relation to the issue of customs. There is a more appropriate mechanism available through which the Deputy can address the issues he raised.
15070	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	14	 For clarity, in regard to civil aircraft, An Garda Síochána has statutory powers of entry and arrest. However, these powers can only be exercised where a garda knows or reasonably suspects that a person has committed an offence. There is no legislative basis to permit random or routine entry to or a search of civilian aircraft for the purpose of the detection of any offence. Amendments to these legislative provisions are the responsibility of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Day-to-day implementation of these provisions is an operational matter for An Garda Síochána. The Deputy has spoken specifically of military aircraft. The situation in this regard is different. Under the Chicago Convention, which provides the basis for the regulation of international civil aviation, military aircraft are deemed to be state aircraft and are excluded from the application of that convention. Accordingly, section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946 excludes state aircraft from its provisions. This is subject to the wider provisions of the Chicago Convention. Again, for the purposes of this legislation, which is a customs Bill, I cannot accept the amendments.

Amendment No. 9 provides that the master of a vessel entering the State is required to berth the vessel, land the goods and disembark the passengers at an approved place within the customs port. Amendment No. 11 makes a corresponding technical change to section 10 which deals, inter alia, with the obligations of the pilot in command of an aircraft in a similar force majeure scenario. Amendment No. 12, also to section 10, concerns the obligations of the pilot in command of an aircraft entering into or departing from the State. In effect, section 9 requires that the operator of the airport notify Customs and Excise of any arrivals or departures in contravention of the conditions of approval of that airport."

(1) The master of a vessel, whether laden or in ballast, entering the State shall— (a) under and in accordance with regulations under subsection (3), submit or cause to be submitted a report of the vessel to the Commissioners, and (b) answer all questions relating to the voyage, vessel, passengers, crew, baggage, conveyances and goods or stores carried on board, as may be put to him or her by an officer of customs. (2) The master of a vessel, whether laden or in ballast, departing the State shall— (a) under and in accordance with regulations under subsection (3), submit or cause to be submitted a report of the vessel to the Commissioners, and (b) answer all questions relating to the voyage, vessel, passengers, crew, baggage, conveyances and goods or stores carried on board, as may be put to him or her by an officer of customs.

(4) A person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of €5,000."". Amendment No. 10 is to section 9, which provides that the master of a vessel arriving at, or departing from, the State is required to deliver a report of the vessel to Customs and Excise and to answer all questions relating to the voyage, vessel, passengers, goods carried and the crew. The amendment substitutes a revised text for section 9. Amendment No. 13 makes a corresponding change to section 11, which provides that the pilot in command of an aircraft arriving at, or departing from, the State is required to deliver a report as outlined earlier. The amendment also provides that the revised text does not constitute any change of substance to the requirement in the original text as published."

(1) A person entering or leaving the State shall— (a) at such place as the Commissioners may designate and in such manner as the Commissioners may determine, declare to an officer of customs any goods included in his or her baggage or brought with him or her, which are liable to any duty or tax, or are subject to any prohibition or restriction on importation or exportation, (b) answer such questions as may be put to him or her by an officer of customs, in exercise of the powers conferred on the officer by section 31, with respect to— (i) the person’s arrival or departure, (ii) the person’s identity, usual place of residence and actual or intended address within the State, (iii) the person’s baggage, and (iv) anything included in that baggage or brought by that person by whatever means, (c) if required by that officer, produce and unpack that baggage and any such thing for examination, and repack it following such examination, and (d) remain present for the duration of such examination. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), where a channel system is in place at a customs port or customs airport, a person entering the State shall declare, by electing to enter and entering the red channel, that he or she has in his or her baggage, or has brought with him or her goods that are liable or may be liable to any duty or tax, or that are subject or may be subject to any prohibition or restriction on importation. (3) A person entering the State who leaves a place approved under section 7(1), or who leaves a customs port or customs airport, without making a declaration under subsection (1) shall be deemed to have declared that there are no goods included in his or her baggage or brought with him or her, that are liable or may be liable to any duty or tax, or that are subject or may be subject to any prohibition or restriction on importation. (4) A person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of €5,000. (5) In this section and in section 13, “duty or tax” means duties of customs, excise duty or Value-Added Tax payable on goods imported or exported."". Amendment No. 14 to section 12 provides that a person entering or leaving the State is required to declare to a customs officer anything in his or her baggage, to answer all questions in respect of his or her arrival or departure and in respect of his or her baggage, to unpack the baggage for examination and to remain present for the duration of the examination. The amendment in subsection (1)(b) is to provide that a person entering or leaving the State shall also answer any questions put to him or her by an officer of customs in respect of the person’s identity, place of residence and address within the State. This is considered to be an important and necessary provision in respect of the Customs and Excise’s control of persons and their baggage entering or leaving the State. The amendment in subsection (2), and the corresponding insertion of new subsection (3), is to clarify the manner in which a person makes a customs declaration where a red and green channel system is in place at ports and airports. The new subsection (3) provides that where a person leaves a customs port or airport, or other customs place, without making a declaration under subsection (1), he or she is deemed to have declared that there are no dutiable or prohibited or restricted goods carried in their baggage. If that person is subsequently found to have in their baggage or on his or her person goods that are liable to duty or tax, or that are subject to a prohibition or restriction on importation, the person has left himself or herself open to prosecution for contravention of subsection (1)."
15078	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	30	 Amendment No.15, in the name of Deputy Doherty, is to section 12. The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be that any person either searched or found to be liable for duty or tax on imported goods could request in writing the reason that he or she had been searched or the reason he or she had been charged the duty or tax. The charging of any duty or tax on imported goods only arises where such goods are so liable under the law in force at the time. Information regarding rates of duty and tax applicable is freely and widely available, for example, on the Revenue Commissioners' website and in public notices. Any assessment to duty or tax made by customs would be fully explained to the person concerned at the time of importation or at any subsequent time, if so requested. Accordingly, it is considered that a provision in legislation, as laid down in the amendment, is absolutely unnecessary. As regards the search of baggage, the selection of baggage for examination is based on a combination of customs risk assessment criteria, intelligence information and an element of random selection. Search of passengers’ baggage by customs is a standard control mechanism at ports and airports worldwide and it is not considered necessary or desirable from an operational point of view to disclose to the passenger the reason his or her baggage was selected for examination.

This amendment makes it an offence to smuggle goods into the State without payment of duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction on their importation. It also makes it an offence to export goods without payment of any duty that may be payable or contrary to any prohibition or restriction on their exportation. Amendment No. 19 to section 15 provides for a number of miscellaneous offences associated with smuggling, ranging from failure to comply with the lawful requirement imposed by an officer of customs to damaging customs property.

Amendments Nos. 20 to 24, inclusive, deal with the same substantive point in one section. These are technical amendments to section 21 of the Bill which provide for the rules for court proceedings in relation to customs offences. The first four amendments clarify that section 21 applies to proceedings in respect of any offence under the Customs Acts. Consequently, the fifth amendment is to delete subsection (9), is superfluous.

15088	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	44	 Section 22 provides that in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant on account of the seizing or detention of anything, the plaintiff will not be entitled to any damages or costs and the defendant will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds probable cause for the seizure or detention. No change of substance is involved. This section protects officers seizing or detaining goods or anything where a civil or criminal case is taken against such officers, provided that the court or judge certifies that there was probable cause for such seizure or detention. This provision mirrors a similar provision, namely, section 129 of the Finance Act 2001, in respect of the seizure of exciseable goods. It is considered that this is a reasonable safeguard for customs officers when carrying out their official duties and acting in good faith. From the plaintiff’s point of view, he or she has the safeguard that the court must find that there was probable cause for the detention or seizure. If the section were not included, customs officers would be unable to carry out their official duties for fear of exposing themselves to threats of vexatious litigation. Forgive me for not understanding the question posed. Perhaps the Deputy can pose it again.
15089	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	46	 Customs officers, when they have probable cause for detention or seizure, must be protected when enforcing the law. This type of protection has existed for customs officials this since the early days of customs law and also exists for other officials of the State enforcing law. For example, Revenue officials enforcing excise law have had this protection since the early days of excise and it was renewed in the 2001 Finance Act. If the court or judge fails to find that the customs official had any probable cause for detention or seizure, the section does not provide any protection and the owner or holder of the goods seized can, if they so wish, seek compensation through the courts.

The amendment provides for powers of entry, inspection and patrolling of certain places for an officer of customs, and any person assisting such an officer, for the purposes of carrying out functions under the Customs Acts, at any time and without warrant.

The amendment provides for the power to carry out a search of a person who is at or in the vicinity of a port or airport, the coast, the land frontier or any premises or land being searched under a search warrant. This power is a necessary control provision to combat smuggling.
15092	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	49	 I move amendment No. 27: In page 30, lines 25 to 28, to delete all words from and including “(1) An” in line 25 down to and including line 28 and substitute the following: “(1) An officer of customs may, subject to subsection (2), stop any person entering or leaving the State and question that person with respect to— (a) the person’s arrival or departure, (b) the person’s identity, usual place of residence and actual or intended address within the State, (c) the person’s baggage, and (d) anything included in that baggage or brought by that person by whatever means, and the officer may examine any such baggage or thing.”. This authorises an officer of customs to stop and question a person entering or leaving the State with regard to their journey and their baggage. It also authorises the officer to search such baggage.
15093	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	51	 In general terms, the Deputy referred to being citizen-friendly and it is important we recognise the work of customs officials is citizen-friendly. If fines are issued successfully, it is because there has been a breach of regulations. We all subscribe to the rule of law in that context. I will explain to the Deputy the Government's position and the Deputy can explain why he seeks a return to a District Court judge and give us some insight into the Sinn Féin position on this. The amendment gives a customs officer, on reasonable grounds of suspicion, the power to detain goods and conveyances being imported or exported pending the outcome of inquiries and investigations into whether the goods in question are in compliance with the Customs Acts. Section 33(4) provides that a customs officer may detain any goods being imported or exported that he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect might be required as evidence in any criminal proceedings under any enactment other than the Customs Acts and to place such goods in the custody of the Garda Síochána or other appropriate authority for the purpose of such proceedings. Section 33(4) is a new power and is being proposed to cover instances where Customs and Excise officers, in the course of their duties, discover items that, while not in contravention of customs law, could be required as evidence in criminal proceedings involving breaches of other laws. An example would be false passports discovered in a postal consignment. These would not be in contravention of any customs laws but would clearly be evidence of wrongdoing under other legislation and could be required as evidence in criminal proceedings. The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be to limit the period of detention of such goods to 30 days and, after each period of 30 days, to require the officer to seek permission from a District Court judge to continue to hold the goods. It is considered that a determination as to whether goods detained under this provision are required as evidence in proceedings would, in the vast majority of cases, be made without undue delay and certainly within the 30-day period proposed in the amendment. However, it would be restrictive and time-consuming to lay down in legislation a requirement to return to the courts on one or more occasions while inquiries were ongoing. On this basis, I do not accept the amendment.
15094	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	53	 If the Deputy examines the Bill, section 33(3) includes the provision that if, within 30 days of the detaining goods, the customs officials do not have any good reasons to seize the goods, they must be released. Other provisions are included in the paragraph the Deputy wants to amend, section 33(4), which are for cases where other goods, which may be evidence in criminal proceedings, are detained. These goods will be handed on to the custody of the Garda Síochána as soon as possible. The goods will no longer be in possession of the customs authorities. In the first case, the customs authorities either release or seize within 30 days and in the second case the Garda Síochána has custody of the goods.
15095	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	55	" To be helpful to the Deputy, perhaps we need to distinguish between what is a customs issue, in effect, and what is an excise issue. If this amendment were accepted, its effect would be to introduce a new section in the Bill under which the Minister for Finance would be statutorily obliged to ""lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effect of fuel, tobacco and other types of smuggling on the economy and propose in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Assembly measures to tackle these crimes."". The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners monitor the illicit trade in excisable goods on an ongoing basis and continually make recommendations to tackle the issue. The Minister has used successive Finance Acts to introduce measures to tackle the illicit trade in fuel and tobacco and will not hesitate to do so again in this year's finance Bill, if he sees a need to do so. I hope any such measures will gain the support of all parties. Three reports in this field have already been completed this year. The Revenue Commissioners recently published an analysis of oil duties, entitled The Oil Market in Ireland: Duties, Prices and Consumption. This report included an examination of consumption and revenue loss to the Exchequer due to laundering and smuggling. This report indicates that the overall strategy being pursued by Revenue to combat fuel laundering is working. A report recently published by a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, entitled Cross-border Police Cooperation and Illicit Trade, found that ""the current level of cooperation between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI was excellent with evidence that both police forces worked closely together, formally and informally, on many issues"". It also found that ""the joint Cross-border Policing Strategy, first launched in 2010, which has contributed to the detection of criminal activity and better public safety across the island of Ireland by enhancing the policing capabilities of both police services"". It also found that ""an all-island approach is necessary to tackle cross-border illicit trade"". The committee welcomed ""the development of the multi-agency Cross-border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group and the Cross-border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group since its last inquiry"". The 2014 annual report of the Revenue Commissioners, which was published last week, states: Revenue's response to the threat posed by criminal activities such as fuel and tobacco fraud and drug smuggling includes intelligence gathering, profiling of suspects and implementation of effective operational intervention programmes. Inter-agency cooperation involving other national and international law enforcement agencies is also critical. This includes the sharing of intelligence, proactive profiling of criminal networks, and joint operations. The Minister for Finance and officials within that Department continue to monitor this issue through interaction with industry and with national and international customs and law enforcement agencies. It also operates on the basis of its own experiences on the ground. The Minister has always maintained that he will act on the advice received and introduce whatever measures are required to tackle the issue. It is on this basis that we do not propose to accept this amendment"

15099	SeanSherlock	Labour	15483.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Customs Bill 2014: Committee Stage	61	" I move amendment No. 33: In page 37, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following: ""Controls of cash entering or leaving European Union through the State 42. (1) As provided for by Article 2 of the 2005 Regulation, the Commissioners, as the customs authority in the State, are the competent authority to apply that Regulation. (2) As provided for by Article 3 of the 2005 Regulation, any natural person entering or leaving the European Union and carrying cash of a value of €10,000 or more is obliged to make a declaration to the competent authority and, for that purpose, the declaration shall be made in writing and in such form and manner as the Commissioners may determine and be made to the Commissioners in the case of such person so entering or leaving the Community through the State. (3) An officer of customs may seize and, in accordance with this section, detain any cash worth not less than €10,000 that is being imported into or exported from the European Union through the State in contravention of the 2005 Regulation and this section. (4) For the purposes of checking if a person has complied with the obligation to declare, on entering or leaving the European Union, that he or she has possession of cash worth not less than €10,000, an officer of customs may do one or more of the following: (a) question the person on so entering or leaving the European Union through the State for the purpose of establishing whether or not he or she has in his or her possession an amount of cash worth not less than €10,000; (b) search the person’s baggage and means of transport. (5) Where as a consequence of any response or lack of response to any question asked under subsection (4)(a) or a search carried out under subsection (4)(b), or both, an officer of customs has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person— (a) is importing into or exporting from the European Union through the State in contravention of the 2005 Regulation and this section, or (b) intends or is about to so import or export in contravention of the 2005 Regulation and this section, an amount of cash worth not less than €10,000, then the officer may search the person or cause the person to be searched by another officer of customs and section 30(2), (3), (4) and (6) shall apply to the carrying out of such a search under this section. (6) Where it is intended to prosecute for an offence under subsection (7), cash seized by virtue of this section may continue to be detained until the prosecution is finally determined. (7) A person who fails to make a correct and complete declaration as required by subsection (2) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of €5,000. (8) In this section ""2005 Regulation"" means Regulation (EC) No. 1889/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005. (9) A word or expression that is used in this section and is also used in the 2005 Regulation has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Regulation."". Amendment No. 33 proposes the insertion of a new section in the Bill relating to controls of cash entering or leaving the European Union through the State. Amendment No. 43 is a technical follow-through provision that is necessary as a consequence of amendment No. 33. The effect of these amendments will be to ensure the 2007 statutory instrument is revoked by the Bill."

Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 deal with the same section of the Bill. Amendment No. 34 deals with appeals made to the appeal commissioners where a person is aggrieved with an appeal decision by the Revenue Commissioners under section 45. This is a technical amendment to clarify that, at present, appeals to the appeal commissioners against decisions made by Revenue are, in fact, submitted to Revenue. The appeal is then passed on to the appeal commissioners for their hearing and determination."

Where any duties of customs which a person is liable to pay to the Commissioners are not so paid, simple interest on the amount shall be paid by the person to the Commissioners and such interest shall be calculated from the date on which the duties of customs became payable and at the rate specified in section 991(1)(d) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997."". Amendment No. 36 inserts a new section in the Bill relating to the charging of interest on late payments of customs duties. The purpose of the new section is to provide for the rate of interest due on customs duties not paid by the date on which such duties became payable. The customs code already provides for the liability to interest charges on unpaid customs duty, but leaves the rate of such interest to be determined by the member state."

Amendment No. 37 inserts a new section in the Bill relating to the amendment of section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Section 1078 of the 1997 Act relates to Revenue offences. The new section makes two amendments to section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Paragraph (a) substitutes paragraph 1078(2)(d) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 so as to expand it to provide for an additional offence in relation to the issuing or production of an incorrect document in connection with the importation or exportation of any goods that are subject to a prohibition or restriction on their importation into or exportation from the State. Paragraph (b) substitutes paragraph 1078(2)(j) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 so as to expand it to provide for an offence where an officer of the Revenue Commissioners is obstructed, impeded, assaulted or interfered with in the exercise or performance of his or her powers or duties for the purpose of any tax or in connection with the importation into or exportation from the State of any goods in contravention of any prohibition or restriction on the importation or exportation of such goods. We may have to make a further amendment to the section on Report Stage."

15161	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	70	 I welcome the contributors here this morning. I want to start with the 18 May deadline. That was the deadline that was fixed in the minds of all of us here in terms of the expectation that childcare for healthcare workers would be provided at that point. I am talking about the roadmap. That deadline was missed. What I find extraordinary, and this what I would like to get a view on from both SIPTU and the INMO, is the litany of correspondence between the INMO, in particular, and the various line Departments. I have the dates here in the INMO's submission: 6 April; 16 April; freedom of information requests in respect of 8 April and 9 April; again two more on 9 April; on 27 April; and even on 6 May. There seems to me to have been a very proactive and progressive attempt by the INMO to engage with the HSE and through the ambit of NPHET and the line Departments in respect of putting in place something to meet the deadline of 18 May. If I look at the evidence base here, based on the litany of correspondence, I would have to conclude objectively that there was never going to be a serious attempt on the part of the HSE, NPHET or even any of the line Departments to provide any kind of childcare for healthcare workers. I would like to get the reaction of the witnesses to that. It seems to me that there was no concerted effort. There was maybe a bit of pageantry being gone through, a bit of choreography, or a pretence that they were going to deal with that issue. I would like to get the perspective of the witnesses on whether they felt they were taken seriously as healthcare workers in respect of whether the Government was actually going to come up with a scheme that was fit for purpose and to which everybody would subscribe. Looking at the scheme up to 18 May, it was going to be devised along the lines of childcare professionals going into the homes of healthcare workers. In my opinion, for what it is worth, and I would love to hear the witnesses' opinion, they had never fully worked through what the protocols around that would be. It seems to me that what we are at here is the Government is going through a charade in respect of taking the issue seriously. That is the first point. I would love to get the reaction of the witnesses to that in the short time that I have.
15162	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	72	 I appreciate that. The message to take away for us, as public representatives and Teachtaí Dála, is that the issue of the clawback of parental leave needs to be addressed. There has to be recognition of healthcare workers in respect of the amount of parental leave and other leave that they have taken to meet their childcare needs. The State owes them a service or favour in that respect in terms of seeking to claw that back. Is Ms Ní Sheaghdha confident that all of her colleagues will have access to childcare on 29 June?
15163	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	223	 I join others in thanking the witnesses for their contributions today and for the clarity of thought they bring to these proceedings. The messages they are imparting to us are well rehearsed, perhaps, in that they have spoken on these challenges previously. My first question relates to the temporary wage subsidy scheme. If it is the case that public funding accounts for approximately 58% of wages in the sector, is it now time to consider continuing with the temporary wage subsidy scheme for the providers who will reopen in September and to use that as a launch pad to build out the employment rights and proper wages akin to people's qualifications, so we can get the wages element of this resolved once and for all? There was an opportunity, which was articulated very well to me by Darragh O'Connor of SIPTU recently, whereby this could have been a launch pad for resolving the wages element of this. We see the high rates of attrition and the fact that some people will now cease to avail of the temporary wage subsidy scheme as it relates to the childcare sector. This has created a massive amount of uncertainty, which the witnesses have just articulated. Perhaps it is time for the State to fund paying wages in a way that is done in primary and post-primary schools.
15164	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	225	 I have only two minutes left.
15165	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	227	 I thank Ms Byrne and gaibh mo leithscéal for intervening. Is that shared by the other witnesses?
15166	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	229	" I apologise to Ms Daly but I have very little time. That is a ""Yes""."
15167	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	231	" I take it that is a ""Yes"" from all the contributors here. We need a launch pad for a proper wage commensurate with people's qualifications across the sector. Public funding accounts for 58% of childcare providers' income. This is what we will be told later on by officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We therefore, as a society, need to grasp that nettle. I will move to my second and final question. There are many disparate groups representing childcare interests. I have to be honest; they are all excellent people but there are many different voices and I believe that now is the time for the sector to unite as one voice because it is sometimes difficult for us, as politicians, to distinguish which group represents what interest. I put it to the witnesses, as advocates on behalf of children and parents and as providers, that now is the time for some sort of citizens' assembly to look at the future of childcare provision and the early years sector in Ireland. Perhaps it is time to consider having one coherent voice in that regard because, quite frankly, if I was not spokesperson for children, I would be largely ignorant of the childcare model. I am telling the truth in that. I am a father of two young smallies as well, so I have a particular interest in this area, but sometimes speaking with one voice is more coherent and can strengthen one's message in interacting with Government."
15168	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	390	 I will gladly take the balance of the Green Party member's time, if I could.
15169	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	392	 Deputy Costello is very kind. I thank the witnesses for appearing before us. I want to go back to the staff ratios. There are two stories here; there is the 29 June scenario and the September onwards scenario. What is the Department's assessment of the level of demand in percentage terms for 29 June onwards with regard to staff? Will 50% or 40% be back? I ask the witnesses to give us a picture on that.
15170	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	394	 Staff and parental. I want to get a clearer picture of what the sector will look like.
15171	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	396	 If that is 50%, and if we are looking at the new pod type arrangements, because we had a considerable discussion on this in the Dáil some time back, the question arises as to how staffing will be applied to the new pod arrangements in September. I presume it will go back up to 100%. Can the new pod system be made work, particularly for smaller and older providers that have been providing services in the community for a decade or two or even longer, if a serious constraint is put on them if the pod system is to be adhered to, notwithstanding the fact that reopening grants and once-off capital grants are being made available? I note what was said about providers feeding back that they would be able to manage it, but even if €18 million is put in place for additional staffing costs, training and staff guidelines, additional resources, hygiene and cleaning consumables, if the regulatory regime on the spatial requirements is applied uniformly throughout the system it will have a major impact on providers throughout the State, such that there will be an even higher rate of attrition in the number of providers. What I am getting at is if we could get some assurance from the Department and Tusla that the hammer will not fall too hard and common sense will be applied, such that people will be allowed to survive as long as they meet, by and large, the requirements expected of them.
15172	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	398	 I appreciate that. We had a good engagement with the INMO and SIPTU earlier regarding healthcare workers. The evidence is there about the level of engagement with the INMO, in particular, in respect of 18 May, which was the date on which childcare was supposed to be provided for front-line workers. I contend that there was a failure on the part of the State to live up to its promise to deliver for those workers. It is incumbent on us to acknowledge that there was a failure in respect of those people. Do the witnesses acknowledge that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and all Departments failed those front-line workers? There is a major issue whereby it considerably added to the stress and strain placed on those workers in trying to do their jobs. These people had a legitimate expectation, which was preannounced in the context of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, that they would have access to those childcare facilities but this never happened. Should we not now acknowledge that there was a failure on the part of the State towards those people? Do they not deserve an apology for that or some acknowledgement of the failure to which I refer?
15173	SeanSherlock	Labour	17366.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-06-23 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	400	 I apologise for cutting across Dr. Lynch. Why was that not signalled at an earlier stage to the organisations that represent those workers? It would have been much easier for people to digest if there were legitimate issues such as those relating to insurance.

15189	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 To satisfy my curiosity, why was amendment No. 1 ruled out of order when it is more of a semantic amendment than a substantive one?
15190	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	" I move amendment No. 2: In page 18, subsection (1), to delete line 28 and substitute the following: "" ""repealed enactment"" means the Value Added Tax Act 1972 repealed by section 122;” This is a drafting amendment.  As it stands the definition of ""repealed enactment"" refers to section 121, which defines it for the purposes of Part 14, however, the expression ""repealed enactment"" is used outside Part 14 for example, in section 15(5) (a).  It seems to us more appropriate to delete section 121 and simply define “repealed enactment” in Part 1."
15191	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	 I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.
15192	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	56	" I move amendment No. 4: In page 59, subsection (1), lines 9 to 23, to delete paragraphs (a) to (d) and substitute the following: ""(a) zero per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to goods in the circumstances specified in paragraphs 1(1) to (3), 3(1) and (3) and 7(1) to (4) and (6) of Schedule 2 or of goods or services of a kind specified in the other paragraphs of that Schedule; (b) 4.8 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of livestock and live greyhounds and to the hire of horses; (c) 13.5 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to goods or services of a kind specified in Schedule 3; (d) 21 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable other than in relation to goods or services on which tax is chargeable at any of the rates specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).”. This is a drafting amendment.  We are setting out a more logical listing in numerical order.  A logical listing of the rates should be in order of amount from 0% to 21%.  This is basically the reasoning."
15193	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	59	 The longer I spend in this institution the more I am beginning to realise that parallel logical positions are often taken.  I accept what the Minister is saying and I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.
15194	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	62	 Is there scope for me to come at this again at the next Stage?  I accept at one level that the Chairman maintains there are substantive amendments and he has ruled some of them out of order.  Is it possible for the Opposition to reserve the right to take a view on this in the intervening period and then come back on Report Stage?
15195	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	66	" I move amendment No. 7: In page 99, lines 12 to 16, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following: ""(2) An invoice shall be stored within the State unless— (a) it is stored by electronic means in a manner which conforms with requirements laid down by the Revenue Commissioners in that respect, or (b) the storing of the invoice is otherwise in accordance with the agreement of the Commissioners and is subject to any conditions set by them.”. This is a drafting amendment.  At the moment the subsection could be deemed to be contradictory because it states ""any invoice...shall be stored within the State"" but the phrase ""may be stored outside the State"" is used afterwards.  We propose a re-draft which makes the exceptions to storing within the State clearer and which makes more sense grammatically as well.  It is more of a semantic amendment."
15196	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	69	 I appreciate that.  The logic of the amendment is based on the recent Data Retention Act which, although it was designed for specific counter-terrorism purposes and to assist Garda investigations, the issue here is still the retention of data and if it should be stored for a specified time.
15197	SeanSherlock	Labour	13852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	71	" I move amendment No. 9: In page 164, line 29, to delete ""Tax"" and substitute ""Value-added tax chargeable by virtue of this Act"". This is also a drafting amendment.  It is not strictly necessary having regard to the definition of tax but section 106 as it stands does not read well in our view."

However, presumably the Department of Health, ergo the Minister, ergo the taxpayer, has some mechanism by which it can express an opinion on the level of claims. I refer both to the cost of those claims and the number of those claims. In other words, has there ever been an expression of worry by anybody in the Department of Health, at a sufficiently high level - right up to the Minister - in respect of the level of claims?

This leads me on to the next question. In his opening statement, Mr. Dempsey stated ""The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project."" To what extent is the claims process mapped onto that ""long and detailed analysis""? If I understand the previous witnesses correctly, it seems to me that if one was trying to map who is winning the battle of the claims war, the board is about a nose ahead at present but in the long-term analysis, it could be that the contractor might come out on top from a financial point of view. In other words, is there a deeper analysis of this taking place around the claims process?"

I have a short time so if I can have a rapid fire round of questions, I would be grateful for that opportunity. Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing? Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses. I speak specifically for Cork. I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time. Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that. We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit. In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane? How soon will that happen?
15232	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	139	 On remuneration, am I given to understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been notified of the remuneration of all persons employed by HRI or its subsidiaries?
15233	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	141	 In essence, while Mr. Kavanagh is saying a derogation has been sought — I refer specifically to there being a conflict between the derogation and GDPR requirements in respect of readily identifiable persons, to use Mr. Kavanagh’s phrase — is the information on the remuneration of the relevant person or all persons still held with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine? I want to be very clear about this. If we cannot get the information from HRI directly, can this committee, in this era of transparency, seek it directly from the Department? Where an individual is serving on a State body, is a member of a board or holds an executive position, and where significant amounts of taxpayers’ money are being given to the board or organisation in question, the least we should expect is the notification of the remuneration package. I do not believe it is fair to say the information is commercially sensitive because HRI is, de facto, operating a monopoly in respect of the horse racing industry in Ireland. Does Mr. Kavanagh agree?
15234	SeanSherlock	Labour	17611.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-23 00:00:00	Horse Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	143	 I thank Mr. Kavanagh. My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse. I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman. HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow. There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair. Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar? I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity. I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them. I am putting my hand up for the garden fair that takes place in Mallow every year. Can we expect the resumption of events like that in the not-too-distant future, subject to public health guidelines?

I wish to ask about the existence of the EU procurement directive. I profess to be somewhat ignorant on this issue but I will seek the witnesses' guidance. I understand that Article 20 of the directive allows for reserved contracts for certain types of entities. I am speaking specifically about social enterprises or those people who operate within the disability sector. My understanding is that this provision of the directive is not being operated in Ireland. I am seeking some sort of appraisal or response from the witnesses from the OGP with regard to whether it is being operated. If it is not possible to answer my question within the timeframe allocated to me today, could there be a report of some written correspondence to the committee about whether or not disability-focused organisations are being excluded from applying for reserved contracts?
15240	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	2019 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	94	 Am I to understand that the OGP is not obliged to police, a word which I use lightly, whether or not local authorities or public bodies are actually exercising the reserved contracts or the Article 20 provision? Is that the case?
15241	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	2019 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	96	 Mr. Quinn says that the OGP has transposed the directive faithfully, verbatim, if I understand him correctly. It is not a leading question but it would be worrying if we are not using reserved contracts to encourage certain categories of workers who are able to access them. One would hope that the OGP would be as proactive as possible, especially in the disability sector and social enterprise.

15245	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	6	 I thank the Chairman. I thank Mr. Black and his colleagues for attending before the committee today. I want to start with the situation of Ulster Bank, which is a key lender in the SME food sector. In my analysis, it has been seen as the key bank to go to for small to medium-sized food companies seeking to access lending for productive purposes. I want to get a sense from Mr. Black as to, first, whether there is now a high level of exposure for that sector, given the decision of Ulster Bank to pull out of the market, and, second, whether SBCI is aware of this and if it is something that is on its agenda. If we take the two challenges of Covid and Brexit, as well as the importance of the food sector and the recognition of Ulster Bank as being a go-to bank for small to medium-sized food companies that are export driven, is there a consciousness within SBCI of the need to plug that gap in lending? Is this a conversation that is taking place at present? I would like to get that perspective from Mr. Black, if I may.
15246	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	8	 Is my perception right and is my research solid in saying that there is a strong relationship between food companies and Ulster Bank in particular? I accept that there are strong relationships with other banks. Ulster Bank is, however, the go-to bank for certain entities in the food sector. I refer, for example, to small, mainly family-run start-ups or, perhaps, high potential start-up companies that are scaling up and exporting. I am seeking comfort from the SBCI on what Mr. Black said about the MOU. Is that Mr. Black's view, insofar as he can speak for Ulster Bank and insofar as we are still going through a process here? I do not want to see a chunk of lending potential slipping off the radar and a chunk of a sector that is vital to Ireland's economic interests finding itself in a position where it has no go-to bank for the type of funding the SBCI provides to the on-lenders. Can Mr. Black give me some level of comfort in that regard? A signal from the SBCI in respect of that matter would give some assurances to people who live, breathe and work in this sector every day.
15247	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	10	 I understand that the agriculture fund set up by the SBCI was oversubscribed. Is it the view of the SBCI that there is potential for a new funding facility in that sector? Again, this is a vital sector. It is export-driven and faces the headwinds of Covid-19. Obviously, Brexit still hangs above many companies and producers like the sword of Damocles. Is it the intention of the SBCI to look at potential funding in the agriculture sector? It is lending for productive purposes. The fund in question was oversubscribed in the previous round. Mr. Black might also give us his perspective on that.
15248	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	12	 Can Mr. Black talk me through the strategic review for the period 2020 to 2025? He referred to new SME funding for the energy retrofit sector. How advanced is that conversation at present? When does Mr. Black see the SBCI moving into that sector for productive lending? How does he propose that those moneys will be disbursed? Reference was made to the credit unions. To what extent does Mr. Black see credit unions as a viable option for funding into this sector? It very much filters down to the local economy. Where stands the conversation in that regard?
15249	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	14	 Mr. Black mentioned the Department. Obviously, the SBCI is in discussions with the parent Department. Detail is important for people like us in the committee. Is that money proposed to be divested through the SBCI's on-lending partners? What are the entities through which Mr. Black is talking about divesting moneys?
15250	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	16	 I will move very briefly on to the issue of pay. Are pay rates for employees set by the NTMA?
15251	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	18	 They are performance-related pay rates.
15252	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	20	 Why were performance-related payments made in 2019, for instance, when SBCI had a loss that year of €408,000?
15253	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	22	 If I may please Mr. Black, as I have limited time, I am not being facetious in any way but I want to understand the dynamic or the metrics Mr. Black uses when determining pay rates. Respectfully, I fail to see the link between quantitative easing and the setting of pay scales.
15254	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	25	 There was some mention in the review relating to the abatement and pulling back of SBCI. I would read that language as withdrawing. Is the bank's existence justified at the present time?
15255	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland: Financial Statements 2019	287	" I appreciate the Chair for letting me back in. I have an example of an SME that is operating in the tourism, leisure and outdoor sector. The owner made approaches to Close Brothers and KBCI in respect of SBCI funding. When he contacted KBCI, he was informed that it was using the SBCI future growth loan scheme fund, but it was, and I quote from the email, ""only offering loans to businesses registered with a professional body"". I ask the SBCI to carry out an examination of that interaction internally. I can give the witnesses the name of the company following the meeting. None of us wants to see unnecessary impediments being put in the way of SMEs if they happen to be seeking funding in a sector of the economy that might not pass muster with ""banking types"". I might be a little unkind in my use of language. The application is somewhat left field, but nonetheless, it is worth further examination. The owner seems to have to jump through hoops with the SBCI in order to pass muster. The main point that I am making is that certain sectors of the economy should not be discounted on the basis that they are not deemed to be fashionable or de rigueur."

I thank Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for being here. I want to ask about the fishery harbour centres financial reporting and financial management review group within the Department. It is quite a mouthful of a name. First, when specifically will the work of that group be completed? Second, there is to be a report on debt management. I am trying to understand why specifically there is to be a report on debt management; what is the nature of that debt and how much is that debt?

I acknowledge the work RTÉ has done throughout the pandemic as part of its public broadcasting remit, particularly in reassuring people and relieving their anxiety over the past 12 months or so and imparting information based on science and fact. I only have a few minutes. There are so many things I would like to talk about but I will focus on the independent sector. As I understand it, the independent production sector is protected under the Broadcasting Act 2009. I want to delve a little deeper into how Ms Forbes proposes to increase that funding as we open up society and the economy. What reassurances can she give to that sector that it will be the beneficiary of increased funding for output for the next 12 to 24 months?
15288	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	95	 I thank Ms Forbes. She has hit the nail on the head. There is an obligation on RTÉ as per the legislation and she has confirmed that it will fulfil that commitment. That is where I was going with my point so I welcome that reply. I wholeheartedly agree about how people procure their content now and the multiplicity of devices that are available to people. We have not been strong enough politically in acknowledging that content is not free. There is a price to be paid and a cost incurred in creating content. We will all watch with interest what happens in Australia and Ms Forbes made a point about how that might permeate through to Ireland. I am interested in whether RTÉ is now thinking about 5G and things like the roll-out of enhanced fibre broadband. Donnybrook and the citadel that is RTÉ was a place where there was a lot of production going on but surely to goodness with the advent of 5G, and people are already talking about 6G, there is a mechanism to use more geographical locations to produce content and give voice to the regions in how we produce content in this country, because the technology would allow us to do that.
15289	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Committee	93	 Okay. I thank Ms Forbes. I apologise for the earlier technical issues. As a result of holding meetings remotely due to Covid, there can sometimes be a bit of overlap between witnesses and committee members and they can end up talking over one another. We have tried to manage as best we can. I thank the witnesses for their patience and assistance with all of that. I also thank them for joining us today and for the information they have provided. I also thank Mr. McCarthy and his staff for attending and for assisting the committee in today's meeting. Is it agreed that the clerk to the committee will be requested to seek follow-up information and carry out any actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we will note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed.

I welcome the officials. I will focus on programme B, land transport, which is 80% of the overall gross expenditure for 2019. I also acknowledge that the 2021 total is €3.3 billion. Arising from land transport, there is the Road Safety Authority, RSA. The Secretary General will be aware that there is a serious backlog in driver theory testing and driver testing. Approximately 100,000 people are waiting for driver theory testing and the number is similar for the other test. Today's issue is the relationship between the Department of Transport and the RSA in working through the backlog of lists. I wish to explore further that relationship in how resources are deployed by the Department to the RSA. The reason I am asking specifically about the RSA is that notwithstanding the positive engagement that I have had with the agency on driver theory testing and driver test backlogs, the announcement in the past number of days of an interim solution to be provided by moving driver theory testing online did not get off to a great start because the number of people who will be tested under that online system will be 4,000. There are also further inherent issues then as to how the technology is deployed. Why, for instance, are only 4,000 people being tested online with this new interim solution? How is the Department resourcing that? What is the nature of the relationship of the RSA with the Department to ensure that we move from 4,000 being tested up to the full cohort and backlog being tested, which is the full 100,000 plus of people who are waiting for tests? What are the technological issues arising from this interim solution where we are being told that to apply for the online driving test someone has to have a Windows 8 personal computer, PC, or above and that those using a phone, tablet or Mac computer will be excluded, as will those using android or iOS? Applicants must also be able to use Google Chrome and the minimum speed has to be 5 Mbps. I want to explore with the Department its relationship with the RSA on the basis that it is a key Department in getting Ireland moving again in a post Covid-19 society. If we are to get people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Department of Social Protection payments to enable them to move, we need driver theory and driver testing to be fit for purpose. What is Mr. Spratt's current appraisal on when the Department expects that full cohort of people to be tested and what resources are being deployed by his Department to ensure that the RSA is fully resourced so that people can get back on the road?

The 100,000 people waiting for the driver theory test and the 100,000 who are waiting for the full test may take some comfort from those words. For the cohort who are waiting on the driver theory test, the technology needs to be user-friendly and fit for purpose and there should be protocols put in place in terms of the use of the technology, in that when camera technology is being used, assurances are given to the person who is being tested that any data collected is collected in a safe and appropriate way. That is important for people who have decided to put trust in the system. If the RSA can reach a target of 50,000 per month, the lists will be got through within a short space of time. I welcome the statement by the Secretary General on providing us with an update and commitments in respect of close of business tomorrow. It is important we ensure we can get people moving again. So many people are reliant on this. It is an important service for everybody in this country.

I do not want Mr. Spratt to give me an answer now, in terms of the roads in County Offaly. There is a special case for north County Offaly, because the roads are over peat. Mr. O'Leary is nodding in agreement. There is a serious issue there, in terms of road safety. Can someone please have a look at the R400? The engineers and councillors need the money for it. The local population needs it. There are road safety issues with the R400 in the area where the old Derrygreenagh works were. There is a serious situation in north Offaly, because it is going over peat. The other thing I wanted to briefly mention was the 1951 CIÉ pension scheme. I do not want to go into it in detail. There are people there for 40 years who have paid into a pension scheme and are left in a precarious situation. The trustees have made a High Court application. There should be no further discussion of the 1951 scheme, until that happens. Another member of the committee has already raised this. The Department needs to keep an eye on it, because there are people who have paid into that scheme throughout their term of employment with CIÉ. The last thing I want to raise with the witnesses is the issue of bus shelters. I have had to write, as a member of a local authority and as a Deputy, to the chair of the National Transport Authority, about bus stops for Mountrath, Castletown, Borris-in-Ossary, Doonane, Crettyard and Ballylynan. It is crazy stuff. There is provision under the local authority Act brought in by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, whereby that power is given to local authorities. I did not agree with him on many things, but one of the things he did was the provision in that Act. There is huge frustration at local authority level, because they feel there is significant micromanagement by the Department of Transport. Local authorities have excellent engineers. There are good local authority members. There are good management systems in place. I know it is a matter for the Minister of Transport more than the witnesses, but I do not want to let the opportunity pass. We need to allow the local authorities to breathe. We need to breathe a bit of life and democracy back into local authorities. Can the issue of bus shelters be delegated back to local authorities? If one goes over the Border, into the Six Counties, there are bus shelters all over the place. There are bus shelters at every half-mile point on the road, including for school buses. We cannot seem to get them in counties Laois or Offaly and every other Deputy here will concur with me on this, in terms of their counties. It is too bureaucratic. It is the local authority. Give it the money. Let it do it. It will do it cheaper as well. I ask Mr. Spratt to come back to me with a note on that. I am saying that in a constructive way. It is good news about the driving tests. I welcome that staff numbers are being increased. We look forward to that being expedited. We are out of time. I thank all the witnesses for joining us and the Department for the information it provided on a wide range of issues. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting the committee. It is agreed for the clerk to seek any follow up in the information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed we publish any opening statements and briefings provided for us today? I remind members of the committee that directly after the meeting there will be a photo shoot outside, on the Plinth, so they should have their best suits on. I remind members also that we will launch a report on our engagement with the Office of Public Works at 12 o'clock and that the launch will be published on the Oireachtas website. I thank everyone. Go raibh míle maith agaibh. The committee is adjourned. On 9.30 a.m. next Tuesday, 1 June, the committee will meet in private session.

15295	SeanSherlock	Labour	17711.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-03 00:00:00	Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government (resumed)	28	 On the inspection regime in respect of HAP and RAS, I have a parliamentary question from Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I will speak specifically about the local authorities of Cork County Council and Cork City Council. It shows that the number of inspections carried out to September 2020 in County Cork was 611 and in the city of Cork was 434. Notwithstanding the public health restrictions, we can take out all of the last 12 months in terms of the inspection regime. Is the Secretary General satisfied that the inspection regime is properly funded - we all speak from our own experiences as public representatives – such that it can be ensured that the policy and legislation are working effectively and we do not have families living in absolute slums? That is how I would describe some of the properties I have seen that are beneficiaries of RAS or HAP payments. I contend that the inspection regime is not fit for purpose. I do not want to put the blame on the local authorities. What is the link between the Department and the local authorities in respect of ensuring the inspectorate passes muster and is fit for purpose? I put the question to the Secretary General.
15296	SeanSherlock	Labour	17711.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-03 00:00:00	Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government (resumed)	31	 I am conscious of my time. The point I make here is that the witnesses acknowledge that there is an issue with inspections. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a bearing in terms of the number of inspections. I ask that this is prioritised, so that the Department would liaise with the local authorities in order to ensure that the inspection regime is fit for purpose, robust, and properly resourced, and so that there is a significant increase in the number of whole-time equivalents, WTEs, that would be tasked with this. That is the only ask I have. I do not think it is fair to ask a tenant to walk around with a mobile phone to look at his or her house. We have to get people back into houses as quickly as possible. This is about taxpayers’ money at the end of the day. If we are talking about taxpayers’ money, we cannot have a situation where we have quite literally slum landlords. This is the outworking and the resourcing of the policy. Families with children with respiratory illnesses are coming to me because they are not in proper, fit-for-purpose accommodation. That is a poor day for Ireland in terms of how we deal with families under those schemes.

15300	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	17	 First of all, I will start by wishing Niall well. Forgive me, if I refer to you in an informal manner. I am a former Minister of State in that Department and I have worked with you in the past. We have all been tremendously impressed by the leadership that you have given in such challenging times. I note that you said you were retiring, but you are stepping down as Secretary General. We hope that you will stay within the service in some way, shape or fashion. Personally, I wish you well. It is important that we acknowledge the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, both for the work that it does at the bilateral level in terms of its bilateral relations with countries throughout the globe and also at the multilateral level where it deals with the United Nations and other such organisations. We are lucky to have a Department of Foreign Affairs that is staffed by what I would I call the A team in terms of the work that it does as a Department throughout the globe. I note, in particular, the reference to consular services. For us, as TDs, and for Senators, our primary interface with the Department of Foreign Affairs is normally through either consular services or the Passport Office. I want to acknowledge that that often hidden and silent work is very significant and that it has helped so many of our constituents throughout the country, particularly where bereavements have occurred. I fully acknowledge that role because it is vitally important, and also that it would be resourced appropriately. Let me start with that. On passports, where stands the foreign birth registrations process? That might be one that the Secretary General might want to defer to his colleagues.
15301	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	21	 I am happy to receive a note after this meeting, if that is possible, in terms of a real-time analysis of where the foreign birth registrations is at present. I will move on. It is significant that today we have a British-Irish intergovernmental meeting here in Dublin. The organisation of that will consume a lot of the resources of the Department. Where are the priorities in respect of the reconciliation fund in the light of the challenges of Brexit and Covid and is there a clear earmarking of funds now to meet those challenges? I would like an understanding of where the thinking is on how those resources are deployed and if there is a pivot towards the challenges of Brexit, or not.
15302	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	23	 I thank Mr. Burgess. I will move now the Irish Aid programme. A number of conflicts have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Ethiopia where there is an Irish embassy and aid programmes. I refer to the Gambella and Tigray regions. I am concerned about Irish citizens who are working in those regions. I am concerned on the one hand that there may not be a sufficient deployment of resources to ensure the safety and security of Irish citizens and, on the other, that the programmes, in particular what are known as the safety net programmes to ensure food security, are being hampered by the conflict. Can Mr. Burgess reassure us that there is sufficient protection of Irish citizens, in particular embassy staff, Irish, non-Irish and local, and of those working in NGOs in the conflict areas in order that they can carry out their work? What is their status? It would be helpful to know if increased resources have been deployed into that effort in real time.
15303	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	25	 That is reassuring. That is the first time that we have heard that. We have read about the conflict in Tigray but it is reassuring that there are clear protocols for the safety of both embassy staff and those working on the ground. I cannot let the opportunity pass to ask about Bóthar and whether there was any financial exposure of Irish Aid or the Department to the recent Bóthar scandal. Can the Secretary General tell us anything about any exposure that the taxpayer has had?
15304	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	27	 I am conscious of what the Chair is saying. I will put the question another way. Has Irish Aid ever funded Bóthar? That is a factual yes-no answer. I want to get a perspective without prejudicing any ongoing case.
15305	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	30	 I wish to ask about the occupied territories and the disbursement of funding, the latest round of which is about €12.7 million but I am open to correction on that. Is the Department satisfied that this disbursement is going exactly where it needs to go? I know there is a particular emphasis on funding education within the occupied territories. Can Mr. de Búrca or the Secretary General provide a perspective on the importance of funding by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish taxpayer into the occupied territories?
15306	SeanSherlock	Labour	17732.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-24 00:00:00	2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	32	 I wish to thank the people in Ramallah as well for the work they do on behalf of the Irish citizens. They do a great job there.

It is not the main contractor making the variation, it is the board making the variation that gives rise to the claim. I would like a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer. I am trying to understand this correctly."

The architect is the designer of the project from day one but the architect is also the arbiter in respect of the decisions on claims. Is this correct?
15323	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	149	 In broad terms I am correct in what I am saying.
15324	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	151	 Mr. Devine is saying an independent person is built in but it is still the architect and it is still coming from the project board side. That is the point.
15325	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	153	 That is fine. There are 906 claims notified under clause 10.3 for determination by the employer's representative. Mr. Devine has sent us the document on the 10.3 clause and there are six subheadings. People will be able to interpret them quite easily. If I understand it correctly what the witnesses have stated today is the value of those 906 claims is now approximately €446 million. Is that correct?
15326	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	155	 There are nine disputes agreed and no longer in dispute management to the value of €2.9 million.

We do not have the mechanical, electrical or lift contractors before us. We have to take everything Mr. Devine is saying at face value. I am trying to dig a little bit deeper on this. It seems to me the claims arise from variations made. Notwithstanding the line, which is well co-ordinated, that has been put forward to us today by the Department of Health and Mr. Gunning that external costs will drive this project well beyond whatever figure is to be determined and well beyond the initial costs and the stated public cost, there is also the issue that the development board, and I am trying to be as objective as possible, is part of the process of driving up costs because of the variations it is making. Is this a reasonable statement to make? Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations. The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is. Where there are such variations to the order outlined, any mechanical, electrical or lift variations have to come from the subcontractor to the main contractor through that postbox to the board. Is this correct? Do I have that right or am I wrong?

Is this Mr. Devine's experience as a project director? The project is running into billions of euro at this stage. Is this normal practice?
15332	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	167	 Mr. Gunning has spoken about an inordinate number of claims. He referred to the heat of the battle.

Have we determined that the estimated cost of outstanding claims is €446 million?
15335	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	244	 I am sorry. That is what the contractor is claiming. Can Mr. Devine clarify what has been settled from that €446 million?
15336	SeanSherlock	Labour	17751.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-07-13 00:00:00	National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: 2019 Financial Statement (Resumed)	246	 This leads me to my next question about the legal processes. This is a matter of public record so it should not be sensitive information. Can the witnesses quantify the number of proceedings that have ended up in the High Court? On how many occasions has the development board ended up in the High Court? Who has instigated those proceedings and what has been the cost to the taxpayer, ultimately, of that? That is public knowledge-----

15363	SeanSherlock	Labour	17823.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-23 00:00:00	Business of Committee	111	 I want to ask Mr. Reid if he is aware there is a proposal by the HSE to close the Owenacurra centre in Midleton, County Cork, where 19 residents will be rehoused across a number of other settings throughout the county and possibly beyond.
15364	SeanSherlock	Labour	17823.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-23 00:00:00	Business of Committee	113	 I have two points. First, we still do not have sight of what the costs of refurbishment would be. Second, it is our understanding that it is proposed to rehouse or rehome some people in institutional settings like St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire and also in St. Catherine's, and possibly on the site of St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork. If it is the case that the HSE is proposing to re-institutionalise people at a time when the HSE policy and Government policy is to decongregate, I think that would be taken very seriously. I ask that the HSE take another look at this decision on the basis that people are very concerned, given where it is proposed that people will be sent to, in that this further institutionalises them. All I am asking at this stage is that Mr. Reid take another look at this and run the rule over it, as chief executive officer. I will leave it there. SouthDoc is very important. During the pandemic, a number of cells were taken out of action, and that is the fact of the matter. Mitchelstown and Fermoy, as well as the Cork centres, were taken out. This meant that cars were going much further afield to cover off services on an out-of-hours basis. It meant that doctors were much more stretched, if they were doing home visits. Please do not tell us how the service works. We know how the service works. There is a fear that the €7.5 million of taxpayers’ investment in this service is not buying enough scrutiny of the service that is being provided, notwithstanding the fact it is a separate entity. There is a presence by the HSE on the board of SouthDoc. To my mind, that buys the taxpayer and the HSE greater scrutiny of how SouthDoc operates. On Deputy Colm Burke's point, which he ran out of time on, I share his view. More and more people are now going to Cork University Hospital, CUH, on an accident-and-emergency basis and bypassing SouthDoc because they do not feel confident that they will be seen at times by SouthDoc. We need to deal with perceptions in the public mind as to how SouthDoc operates. I am very familiar with the Mallow service and the Mitchelstown-Fermoy service. They are excellent services staffed by brilliant people. I could not say enough good things about them. However, we do not have a service in Youghal out of hours. Someone who phones from Youghal is expected to go to Midleton. That is a journey of about half an hour. The services at times are stretched between the Waterford border and the Kerry border. There needs to be a review of how SouthDoc operates. It is our view that the €7.5 million investment of taxpayers' money buys the HSE greater scrutiny to ensure that it is triaging and building out a public message in a way that ensures that if people can avoid the accident and emergency department in CUH and go through their local services, while those services are very good, there might need to be a greater degree of scrutiny or some sort of review as to how the services operate, particularly within the city. There needs to be a look back on why the Blackpool and Fermoy-Mitchelstown services were closed because the HSE took out a massive geographical area there. They were taken out during the pandemic. I ask - this is my only ask - that the HSE look back on how SouthDoc operated during the pandemic. A little report could be furnished to Members of the Oireachtas or there could be just a look back on the basis of what lessons can be learned, how the service, which is by and large an excellent service, can operate more efficiently and whether it can cover more sufficiently east Cork. I am convinced that it is not covering the Youghal area. It does not have sufficient resources to cover the Youghal area and ensure that people in Youghal or further afield are not forced to go to Midleton or onward to Cork, directly to an accident and emergency department.

15367	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	7	 I will start with the Dublin docklands SDZ. My understanding of this is that in 2014 NAMA adopted a secondary objective of the facilitation of the development of office accommodation in Dublin and had an interest in 17 ha of the 22 ha of the undeveloped land in the Dublin docklands SDZ. My understanding is that Mr. McDonagh's board approved a business plan for those sites in September 2014 and that there were no formal targets set out in that business plan. I also understand that by the end of 2018 construction was under way or had been completed on 70% of the land in which NAMA had an interest and that by May 2020 construction was under way or had been completed on sites accounting for 86% of the land in which NAMA had an interest. Regarding the commercial development of the Dublin docklands SDZ, can Mr. McDonagh confirm for me what percentage of the NAMA land has seen full construction to date?
15368	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	9	 May I hear Mr. McDonagh's understanding of the impact of Covid on commercial developments? We now know that more people will be working from home and that fewer people will be required to inhabit, if you will, commercial developments. Can Mr. McDonagh give me an insight into NAMA's thinking in respect of the future of commercial developments, such as the Dublin docklands SDZ in particular, in the context of the impact of Covid on commercial space into the future? What I am getting at is whether there will be a need to pivot back to residential. That is ultimately what I am trying to figure out.
15369	SeanSherlock	Labour	17830.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-30 00:00:00	Business of Committee	11	 We understand NAMA's remit and the legislation, but there is the potential for 3,500 residential units at the Poolbeg West site. That is clearly understood. We know that there is about 93,000 sq. m of commercial development. Will Mr. McDonagh talk me through where Poolbeg is at present? My questions are specific. Has a preferred bidder been identified for NAMA's venture partner in the old glass bottle site at Poolbeg West? At what stage of development is the Poolbeg West SDZ? What impact has Covid had on the development of Poolbeg? What impact, if any, have increased construction costs had on the budget for the development of Poolbeg West? On the 3,5000 residential units, it would be useful to have a breakdown or understanding of how that will be divided between social, affordable and commercial development. If social houses are to be developed on the site, what will the ownership structure of the land be? Will it be leased? Will it be used by approved housing agencies? I ask Mr. McDonagh to give a more in-depth analysis of the Poolbeg site.

I wanted to understand better the relationship between An Taisce and various Departments and statutory funding bodies. We all understand, possibly on a superficial level, the work An Taisce does in respect of education. It is inherently good work, particularly when it comes to blue flag and green schools initiatives. It would be very useful for us to understand the financial relationship. We can bear in mind that between 2018 and 2019, there was a restatement of figures. I wish to understand that better and how the Department has dealt with that matter. I also would like to get an overview of the relationship that exists, including whether there are service level agreements in place. If there are, how do they operate? Do the line Departments that are funders, particularly in the context of restricted funds, have an expectation about the governance of any organisation that they may fund, even if it is a charitable organisation? I am seeking the support of the committee for us to write to the line Departments with a view to getting further information in order to better inform ourselves.

15381	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	98	 I welcome Mr. Gloster and his team to the committee. An article appeared on Monday, 27 September, in the Irish Examiner where Mr. Gloster spoke at length in respect of private provision of residential care. The article stated: Mr Gloster said that many private care placements were working well but added: “The bigger risk of that level of dependency on private care is private operators can leave the market; they can leave quickly, they can sell on; company structures can become very complex, and the reality is that if you have a private provider in a house with four young people, if that private provider left the market, the State has only one option and that is for us to take over that provision there”. Is there a shift in policy in Tusla such that it is going to wind down private care providers? Is that a signalling of a policy shift? What is the real-time position in respect of that? The witnesses might bear in mind that I have ten minutes and there are four questions I would like to ask.
15382	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	100	 I have a couple of questions following on from that. As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers. A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses. Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services. What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance? It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver. I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.

Tusla providers are inspected by HIQA but Tusla inspects the private providers on its list.
15384	SeanSherlock	Labour	17851.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-10-21 00:00:00	2020 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General	104	 At what stage does Mr. Gloster anticipate there will be a change in that regime such that the private providers are inspected by HIQA?

It is about as frank as one can get. I hope the regime will change to reflect it. Historically, the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported significantly on the cost of the guardian ad litem service. We are all mindful that the Child and Family Agency is about providing care for children and ensuring, in a court hearing or any judicial process, that the voice of the child is heard. I am concerned about the costs of the guardian ad litem service. We had gone some way towards legislating for change in that area during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. What is the Child and Family Agency's understanding of the status of the draft heads of a Bill to make changes to the guardian ad litem service and what engagement has it had with the Department in that respect?

It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease."" Have all of those 70,000 referrals been expedited? Is Tusla on time and ahead of the curve in terms of all referrals that come to it in respect of any child or family?"

We will also forward it to the health committee and include the question from Deputy Carthy as to whether, in that committee's opinion, this committee is required to examine the matter further. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next business is the work programme. The Dáil is not scheduled to sit next week. That brings us to 4 November, when we are planning to engage with RTÉ on its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. A representative from the Department will be in attendance. When we agreed our work programme to the end of the year last week, I mentioned that we might need to reschedule some engagements depending on availability. The secretariat received a response from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to advise that it is scheduled for oral parliamentary questions on 11 November, which is the date on which we wanted departmental officials to attend. Representatives of the Department of Transport were scheduled for 25 November but have agreed to swap with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 11 November. The secretariat has requested that the officials from the Department of Transport make available to the committee the information we have requested on MetroLink, BusConnects, the DART and the strategic rail fleet review no later than 5 November, to ensure we have it before the meeting on 11 November. I note that there is information flagged up regarding the search and rescue service, which is included in the invitation to the meeting. Accordingly, the schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: 4 November, Exchequer funding of RTÉ; 11 November, Department of Transport; 18 November, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; 25 November, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; 2 December, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; 9 December, Department of Social Protection; and 16 December, Department of Health. At our meeting last week, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November or early December. I suggest that we do so at the end of November rather than letting it go on too long. The list of engagements to the end of the year has been circulated. Does any member wish to raise any other matter relating to the work programme? As no matters have been raised, that concludes our consideration of the work programme. Finally, under any other business, I note that we have work to do on a number of reports, which we will discuss in private session. Do members want to raise any other issues? As there are no other matters to discuss, we will, as agreed, go into private session, after which we will adjourn until 4 November, when we will engage with representatives of RTÉ on Exchequer funding.

I note that there is information flagged up regarding the search and rescue service, which is included in the invitation to the meeting. Accordingly, the schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: 4 November, Exchequer funding of RTÉ; 11 November, Department of Transport; 18 November, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; 25 November, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; 2 December, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; 9 December, Department of Social Protection; and 16 December, Department of Health. At our meeting last week, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November or early December. I suggest that we do so at the end of November rather than letting it go on too long. The list of engagements to the end of the year has been circulated. Does any member wish to raise any other matter relating to the work programme? As no matters have been raised, that concludes our consideration of the work programme. Finally, under any other business, I note that we have work to do on a number of reports, which we will discuss in private session. Do members want to raise any other issues? As there are no other matters to discuss, we will, as agreed, go into private session, after which we will adjourn until 4 November, when we will engage with representatives of RTÉ on Exchequer funding.

We will also forward it to the health committee and include the question from Deputy Carthy as to whether, in that committee's opinion, this committee is required to examine the matter further. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next business is the work programme. The Dáil is not scheduled to sit next week. That brings us to 4 November, when we are planning to engage with RTÉ on its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. A representative from the Department will be in attendance. When we agreed our work programme to the end of the year last week, I mentioned that we might need to reschedule some engagements depending on availability. The secretariat received a response from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to advise that it is scheduled for oral parliamentary questions on 11 November, which is the date on which we wanted departmental officials to attend.

15393	SeanSherlock	Labour	17872.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-11 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	46	" I would like to echo Deputy McAuliffe’s comments in seeking to request that the NTA would come before us. It would be vital, if at all possible, that we would hear from it on this issue. I will be brief. As is usual on a Thursday there are sometimes conflicting diary requirements. I want to seek reassurances in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s special report 113 on procurement to vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard, that there is a clear matching up between the four recommendations that are aimed at strengthening. I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report that they are aimed, “at strengthening the Department’s procurement procedures for the future”. Can we be assured of the following for each of the recommendations for the strategic plan for equipment requirement: that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements should be based on formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department would carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes? I want a short reassurance from the Secretary General that that is all now under way. The Secretary General states that the Department has strengthened its analytical tools for procurement analysis. I remain to be assured that we have a robust and fit-for-purpose system. Can the Secretary General give us those assurances? That is my first question. I will ask three questions specifically and then I will take my leave. The second question is about national secondary routes. Major construction projects begun in 2020 are under way. I believe strongly that there is a need for a policy intervention by the Department in respect of those national secondary routes that are in a deplorable state, such as the N73, in such a way that would ensure that TII, funds projects like that relating to the Mallow to Mitchelstown road. The latter is, arguably, one of the worst national secondary routes in the country, even though it is a vital artery for commercial and domestic traffic in the north Cork area and a vital route between Kerry and Dublin. I continue to make the case for funding for this road. I ask that the N73 project remain on the agenda, and I make no bones about raising the matter at this forum. On the Leap card, the Secretary General informed us that ""Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable."" I am seeking to expand Leap card services in my county of Cork, specifically on routes between Mallow and Cork, where there a massive number of commuters on a daily basis and where there is still not a Leap card service, even though it could be argued that it is a viable route. I can travel from Bray to Pearse Station using a Leap card, but I cannot go from Mallow to Cork. There is an inequality between services on the eastern seaboard and those in the regions. I ask that, as a policy, the Department looks at the roll-out of Leap card services for the towns that service big cities, such as Cork. It is vitally important."

Is that agreed? Agreed. That concludes our consideration of correspondence for today. The next item on our agenda is the work programme. Last week, we agreed our work programme to the end of the year. The meeting schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, 18 November; Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, 25 November; Revenue Commissioners, 2 December; Department of Social Protection, 9 December; and Department of Health, 16 December. We agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year later this month. As nobody wishes to raise anything related to the work programme, that concludes our consideration of same. Does any member wish to raise any other matter before we go into private session? No. As agreed, we will now go into private session. At our next meeting on 18 November, we will engage with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

It is nice to see some familiar faces from my old Department. I am delighted to have the opportunity to pose some questions. I will stay on the Covid-19 restart grant schemes. In that context, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated: A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls. One of these is the completion of post payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received. The Secretary General stated: ""I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched"". We have to try to reconcile the two. It would be useful to articulate in concise terms how the Department intends to answer the questions posed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is widely acknowledged that money flowed into businesses quickly and it was a responsive scheme in that regard. However, questions have been posed and it would be useful to understand the timelines for any review or what such a review would look like."

I thank the Secretary General for that. Will she give a timeline for the conclusion of the review? She has hired outside consultants. When will that look-back be completed?

The expenditure on the innovation programme for 2020 was €414 million. A total of €332 million was spent on the science and technology development programme. Will there be a Science Foundation Ireland call for further centres to be established in the near future? I request a simple ""Yes"" or ""No""."

No. 879C is correspondence I submitted to the committee on 9 November 2021 requesting the committee to make inquiries with IDA Ireland arising from HSE correspondence regarding the procurement of ventilators from China. Obviously, that is self-explanatory. I again ask the committee to agree to make those inquiries. Is that agreed? Agreed. No. 881C is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 9 November 2021. It requests an update on the implementation of the recommendations in our report regarding the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 110 - Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme), which was published in January. One of the recommendations was that the value for money review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme be published without delay. It was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019. Over two and a half years later it has still not been published. We looked for an update on this review and on the report concerning the costs and timeline for the national children's hospital from the Department on 18 October and issued a reminder earlier this month but have not yet received a response. It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence. We could hold it over. That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it. If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year. We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November. It is suggested that we do so next week. Is that agreed? Agreed. Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan? We will be coming back to it next week anyway. Is there any other business? I take it there is not. We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.

15405	SeanSherlock	Labour	17886.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-11-25 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	14	 I thank the Secretary General and her colleagues for appearing before the committee. I wish to focus in the first instance on cultural institutions, programme B, specifically subheads B1 through to B15, of the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media Vote. The entire budget of the Department is rapidly nudging up to €1 billion. As a result, I assume that will give rise to many new challenges. Under the Project 2040 national development plan, NDP, there is €460 million allocated to the national cultural institutions investment programme. The projects incorporated into that programme include the conversion of the Bishop Street warehouse into a secure, environmentally controlled archival repository for the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland redevelopment, the development of the Crawford Art Gallery in my native Cork and the proposal to renovate the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the Chester Beatty Library. The National Museum of Ireland is preparing a design procurement of the history of Ireland galleries. All are laudable projects and are to be supported. However, they will all bring challenges for the Department. The big shift in the spending capacity of the Department in respect of these cultural institutions under the NDP gives rise to a number of specific questions. First, what expertise and systems have increased at Department level to ensure the efficient disbursement of funding for approved capital development projects?

First, who will be responsible for procurement and project management for the capital development projects in the cultural institutions? What is the precise role of the Department, the cultural institution and, where applicable, the OPW in this? Who ultimately manages those relationships? Who undertakes the procurement and daily project oversight? Who signs off on procurement and spending, the Department or the cultural institution? If overspends occur and if the Legislature, through this committee, needs to interrogate certain issues, who will appear before this committee? Looking at the projects I referred to, it is statistically possible there might be issues that may arise in respect of overspends and public procurement that may give rise to questions that have to be answered. If overspends occur, who would appear before this committee? Would it be the Secretary General and her Department or the cultural institution? Furthermore, what additional resources and expertise have been made available to the cultural institutions to deal with this increased oversight and workload? That is just one parcel of questions. There are further questions on this issue.

The context in which I ask these questions is that I worry that the voluntary boards of the institutions that are earmarked for capital development projects, notwithstanding their expertise on cultural and governance matters, might not have expertise on procurement matters. With this money coming down the track to these laudable projects, I worry that there might not be the capacity within the institutions to be able to have that expertise. I am trying to tease out whether it is the intention of the Department to buttress those institutions with additional skill sets as befit the specific project as it arises. The Secretary General said a dedicated team has been established comprising economists. I would like to be assured whether there are teams of procurement specialists and governance specialists being readied for the delivery of these projects. There is a gap there and it is giving rise to concern. I do not feel assured by the answers so far, if I may say that.

We will examine the matter further as time goes on. I thank the witnesses for that. I want to move on to a quite bespoke issue, namely, that of storage within the cultural institutions. My understanding is that there is a storage facility for the National Museum which is housed in Swords. The National Museum of Ireland's collections resource centre in Swords houses 4 million objects. This is an extraordinary figure. What does the future hold for the storage of the key objects in our national collections, regardless of the institution? I understand that, in the case of the National Museum of Ireland, there are only eight years remaining on the existing lease and that a rent review that was due in September 2020 has still not been concluded. If we are seeking to animate any of the projects I outlined, we will have to decant many of the artefacts or pieces, be they artistic or otherwise, to other sites. How are the witnesses dealing with the issue of the storage of these precious items within our national collections, specifically in the National Museum of Ireland? What are the witnesses doing to ensure there is a sustainable storage facility for the National Museum of Ireland and other cultural institutions?

I asked a specific question about rent reviews. What was the outcome of the rent review? Can the witnesses assure this committee and the people of Ireland that there will be, from 2030 onwards, a fit-for-purpose, modern storage facility for any collection within the national collection, be it art or the remains of an Irish elk, for instance?

I might have a different view to Deputy McAuliffe on the amount of content that people in the regions perceive that is attributed to Dublin. I will begin by saying ""well done"" to RTÉ on its latest partnership with Virgin Media Television in respect of the Six Nations Championship. That is a wonderful example of collaboration. Speaking as a proud Munster man and a Munster rugby supporter, I also commend RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector on the provision of United Rugby Championship, URC, output. I strongly believe that model has provided excellent content for the average punter sitting at home who wants to view rugby or sporting output at the highest level through the terrestrial channels. The URC is a great example of where the licence payer sees the best of the utilisation of that fund. Are there plans to expand that further? Can we expect to see more of that? Does the director general perceive that RTÉ will do more collaborations of that nature and exploit further opportunities so that more and more people can enjoy - because that is what it is about - the output that is coming through collaborations of that nature?"
15424	SeanSherlock	Labour	17942.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-20 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	192	 Is there anything in the pipeline at present that Ms Forbes can tell us about in respect of that collaborative model? She spoke about the diversification of sport and, specifically, gender, which is absolutely vital, but what is in pipeline that will embed that model further? From the ordinary punter's point of view, and I am an ordinary punter in this regard, when I look at the URC coverage I see the best of RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector collaborating. Looking at the Irish Examiner model of delivering sport at the most local level through a streaming package, I can tune in to my local team at a county final from the comfort of my living room. Should we go down to that level of granularity? Should the national broadcaster be getting on that wagon to see where the opportunities lie to further embed itself into that collaborative model so that there is more output and RTÉ is taking feeds from a more diverse range of venues across a more diverse range of sports? The technology allows us to do that now. Presumably, RTÉ does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that. I would love to see more of that from our national broadcaster: more localised, more regionalised and more diverse output. If Ms Forbes can tell me it is now part of a policy in RTÉ to continue with that, it will give many people a lot of confidence.

I will move on to the independent sector. My understanding is that there is a statutory requirement for RTÉ to spend in respect of it. For instance, in 2020, the statutory requirement was to spend approximately €40.2 million - Ms Forbes might correct me if that is wrong. My understanding is that RTÉ spent approximately €36.5 million, which is about €3.7 million under target. I understand that the Covid pandemic was a deciding factor in that because of cancelled productions and so on, but the underspend is then required to be spent within two years. Will Ms Forbes elaborate, or educate us, on how RTÉ plans to spend that underspend? Again, I speak specifically for the independent sector, which is starved of funding at present, has plans afoot to deliver content and is anxious to get going again.

I welcome and acknowledge the fact that the Department has corresponded with us in respect of An Taisce. However, I am a little confused about questions Nos. 3 and 4, specifically the reply to question No. 4, which states: On 5th August 2021, An Taisce responded to the Department's letter noting the concerns expressed therein and confirming that they are ""fully in compliance with the DPER circular 13/2014."" That still does not answer the question about the issue of restricted funds and whether or not the Department is fully satisfied that there should have been, within the final accounts, specific reference to Circular 13/2014 and those same restricted funds. I am wondering if, with the agreement of my colleagues and the Chairman, we can ask the Department for further clarification on questions Nos. 3 and 4 and whether there is an obligation for specific reference to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014. We should ask how the Department has asked questions and satisfied itself that An Taisce is fully compliant with that circular. It seems that the Department has merely said it accepts the response from An Taisce. That is my interpretation and I am open to correction on that and to guidance from the Chairman. I would like to interrogate that further to satisfy my mind."

The Secretary General stated: there are robust arrangements in place to monitor funding from the Department to An Taisce and to ensure that such funding is in compliance with the conditions of Circular 13/2014. This includes service level agreements, ongoing engagement, reporting and vouched expenditure. I am still not satisfied that the 2019 accounts were as they should have been. If the Secretary General comes back to us and states the Department is absolutely satisfied it has done everything, then fair enough, but I would like to pursue the issue a little further, if I may.

I apologise profusely for missing the entirety of the meeting thus far but that was unavoidable. I apologise also if some of my questions have been asked and answered. If they have, that is fine. I can take the answers from the record afterwards. I want to talk about the Cork-Dublin line. There was an announcement of approximately €91 million, as I understand it, for the upgrading of that line to ensure that the speed at which commuters could travel between Cork and Dublin and vice versa is speeded up. I want to get a deeper understanding of where that spend is going and how it is proposed to spend the moneys. I understand that signalling upgrades are a component part of that, and possibly new intercity railcars, ICRs. I could be wrong but Ms Graham will clarify that for me. The reason I ask is because, while I am a weekly traveller on the Cork to Dublin line and I am a regular DART user, I wonder whether the Mark 4 engines are fit for purpose in a modern railway infrastructure and whether there is a proposal to replace those with more energy-efficient carriages and train sets. Where is the NTA in terms of that conversation with Irish Rail? That is my first question.
15446	SeanSherlock	Labour	17949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-27 00:00:00	National Transport Authority: Financial Statements 2020	409	 I thank Ms Graham. The other issue relates to correspondence that we would have received in relation to bus shelters. People may ask why am I asking a question about bus shelters. Bus shelters are important to people who do not have their own transport, particularly if they live in intermediate towns. For instance, if you are living between Cork and Limerick in a town such as Buttevant, which has been waiting for a bus shelter for a number of years, it is entirely appropriate for me to ask where the NTA is in terms of the provision of such shelters and why they are not being rolled out at a quicker pace to ensure that we encourage more people to use public transport.
15447	SeanSherlock	Labour	17949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-01-27 00:00:00	National Transport Authority: Financial Statements 2020	412	 I thank Mr. Creegan. I appreciate the answer. I used Buttevant as one example and I am unashamedly parochial in this sense. Buttevant is an example of where infrastructure is not being rolled out in towns and villages that depend on intercity routes. If some attention could be given specifically to Buttevant, I would be very grateful for that. My final question relates to fare structures. I have a mountain of correspondence with the NTA in respect of fare structures between Mallow and Cork. Mallow is a typical example of a town that is within commuting distance of a big city and where I perceive that there is an inequality as between the commuter who commutes to Cork from Mallow and the person who travels, for instance, from Greystones to Pearse Station in terms of fare structures. I note and welcome the correspondence that I have received from the NTA in relation to the introduction of commuter fares. I wish to raise the issue of commuter fares because there are thousands upon thousands of people who will make the modal shift from car to train if the fare structures are right throughout the country. Mallow is a typical example of that. The sooner we get those new fare structures this year, the better. Overnight, you will see a demand for those services among students, workers and citizens in general. That is why I asked the question about the Cork-Dublin upgrades in relation to speed. If we can get more rolling stock on those lines between Cobh, Midleton, Cork, Mallow and Charleville, for instance, and open up new intermediate stations as well, you will create demand. Quite frankly, that is where the Minister is at. That is where the citizens are at. The more the NTA can influence that and bring that about, the more positive the impact it will have for citizens. If there is a confirmation of the fact that commuter fares will be introduced, as per the NTA's correspondence to me already, I would welcome that. That is my final question.

I will continue in the vein of asking very straight questions. I will start by asking about the N73, especially the stretch between Mitchelstown and Mallow. Has Mr. Walsh ever travelled that road?
15456	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	213	 May I cordially invite Mr. Walsh to travel that road as soon as he possibly can? It is only then that he would realise just how awful a stretch of road it is. It is arguably one of the worst national secondary routes in the country. Be that as it may, I welcome that there is an allocation in respect of Annakisha South, Clogher Cross and Waterdyke. I am disappointed, however, that the parcel for 2022 is only €900,000. I am seeking reassurances that a notification will be sent by TII to Cork County Council to give formal notice that Cork County Council can move to go to tender on that project. Is that the case?
15457	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	215	 Has formal notification been issued to Cork County Council?
15458	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	217	 Mr. Walsh will appreciate the point I am making. If TII is only allocating €900,000 this year out of a budget line of approximately €10 million, the fear is that Cork County Council will get stuck in the gap.
15459	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	219	 Let me just finish the point, which I am making in good faith and respectfully. If Cork County Council gets stuck in the gap, having spent €900,000, but cannot go to tender, it cannot proceed to spend up to the figure of €10 million. I am seeking a commitment that following 2022, we will see the tender issued, boots on the ground, a shovel-ready project and that TII is proceeding with the commitment. That is what I am seeking here.
15460	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	221	 Let me reiterate that. TII is issuing the notice to Cork County Council to go to tender and there will be a budget line for 2022 to 2024 that will absolutely deliver that project.
15461	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	223	 I thank Mr. Walsh. He could not be any clearer than that, which I appreciate. That gives us great hope. I refer again to the N73 and other such projects. Has TII given consideration to the budget line for major schemes in relation to County Cork? For instance, the Ballyvourney to Macroom project is coming in this year at approximately €60 million, or €61 million if one wants to round it up. The perception held by people like me is that the effect of all of the moneys going into the Dunkettles and Macroom bypasses of this world, which are the subject of national priority, is to suck the marrow out of the bone for other smaller projects. I acknowledge that they are smaller roads and lesser priorities, but this means that people like me are fighting on our backs for projects that are in abeyance for five, ten, 15 or 20 years. Is it not incongruous that, if a road is a national priority under a national development plan and so on and it is politically prioritised at Government level, it should have a negative bearing on a local authority's ability, in partnership with TII, to deliver on national secondary routes, tertiary routes and so forth? Does Mr. Walsh believe that there should be a rebalancing of priorities so that Exchequer funding for national secondary routes, which are usually the main routes serving counties, do not get caught up in a Samson versus Goliath struggle where, for example, the N73 is completing with the Macroom bypass?
15462	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	225	 The perception is that the rest of the county is paying for these projects.

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made mention of the efficacy of relief roads. I hail from the great town of Mallow. There is a budget allocation of €900,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is welcome and we are delighted. It has been a long-running campaign, as has the N73 campaign. These are decades-old campaigns. What will the €900,000 that TII has allocated for the Mallow relief road get us? Once spent, will it buy a further commitment that the relief road will actually be delivered? This is a bit like my N73.

I welcome the commitment he has given on the N73. It gives me some hope, but we will have to keep an eye on it.

I am still trying to understand what the future of arts and antiquities storage will look like for the State. We were given chapter and verse on the current regime in north County Dublin, but what I am failing to understand is where future-proofing is taking place, given the involvement of local authorities, local museums, national museums, national collections and so on. Is there anything in the language of the letter that gives us, as per our questions, comfort in respect of the future-proofing of what I euphemistically call the national collection, be that arts and antiquities, statues or anything else? I am not sure that we have been given the answer, but I remain-----

I presume it would be done via further correspondence from this committee to the line Department.

New technologies are constantly emerging, which may necessitate the need for a permanent and fixed venue or venues, but we do not have a permanent and fixed venue now. It is on a leasehold basis. I will take advice from the Chairman and the secretariat, as I wish to pursue this matter further. Forgive me if I am slightly ignorant of the facts in this case, but what does a sustainable stand-alone site that is in the ownership of the State and is future-proofed and cost effective look like?
15474	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	554	 I raised the issue in the context of seeking to understand how each of the line Departments operates its relationship with An Taisce. I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week. I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce. When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts. An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward. That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body. That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification. Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding. That provides one with a degree of confidence. In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement. The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----
15475	SeanSherlock	Labour	17956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-03 00:00:00	Transport Infrastructure Ireland: Financial Statements 2020	556	 -----and allocating it to An Taisce, which I understand is essentially a membership organisation. When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them. I just wanted to seek clarity on that. Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts. I am not a financial or management accountant. If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation? In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds? That is just a curiosity of mine. The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation. Hopefully, that can be clarified for me. It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified. Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that. It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes. It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level. It is important that we preserve that and protect it in every way that we can. It does a vital piece of work. However, at the same time, I imagine that we should satisfy ourselves that everything that is being done is absolutely with financial probity in mind.

I feel I have to put that on the record. Clean Coasts Ballynamona is in my constituency. I raised many a green flag myself when I was a Minister of State. The Chairman will know from the tone of the language of my questioning that it was not with a view to seeking to undermine any organisation. I stated very clearly on the record the great work that An Taisce does in respect of the delivery of the programme but since I am not a financial or forensic accountant, I have to rely on the guidance we receive from the secretariat and the correspondence we receive from the Departments. We are fully entitled, as I understand it, to ask a question of any organisation. I am merely posing the questions and am entitled to do that.

I take grave exception to that. It is wrong that it should be inferred from my questioning; it is unfair. I feel aggrieved by the fact that I would be impugned in that way consequent to my line of questioning. My question was asked with a view to seeking clarification.

I do not see how the Deputy is loading the basis by asking that question. It is merely with the purpose of finding fact. For that word to be weaponised now, in some fashion, I think is quite patently wrong. It does me a disservice when all I am seeking to do is find facts. In fairness to the secretariat, it has put together a very comprehensive response. I want to state for the record that the responses we got from the Departments have also been extremely comprehensive. We accept those."

I will return to it soon, given it will not take very long if we allow it to happen. There was a suggestion that we would have two meetings but that would add a further complication. I ask members to bear with me while we nail this down conclusively. I qualify this by saying that, if we decide to take 10 March as the meeting on mental health and if we accept the Deputy's suggestion to hold a further meeting on 24 March, that will push other issues a week or two down the road. I reiterate what has been agreed. Last week, we agreed we would schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick, UL, and include in our invitation a request that the chancellor, Mary Harney, would attend, given the nature of her position and the duration of her tenure, along with the president, who is the accountable person. That is on 7 April. UL's financial statements for the year 2019-20 should be available to us at that point. In accordance with our work programme, we would then engage with the Department of Finance on 14 April and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the Easter break, on 5 March. I ask members to agree to that on the basis that we will sort out later what we will do about the meeting on mental health, that is, whether we should introduce it for the meeting of 10 March or whether we should schedule a double meeting for 10 and 24 March. I am not asking members to agree on the exact dates but rather I propose we take them in that order, subject to sorting out of the business of the mental health issues. Is that agreed? Agreed. I propose we go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 10 February, when we will engage with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of expenditure on the national broadband plan.

15509	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	139	 The articulation of all of this for Deputies like me, who represent both urban and rural constituencies, is that we have villages and townlands that are being split down the middle. The only way I can articulate my point is by giving a practical example and that is the village of Ballyhooly, in north County Cork. Typical of every small village throughout the country, it is quite literally being split down the middle in that part of it is to be provided with broadband through the national broadband plan and the other part is to be provided for by the market. In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard. While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages. It is extremely frustrating. Can Mr. Hendrick provide any reassurance to public representatives like me that people in Ballyhooly and every village like it throughout the country who want to get connected and have a right to be connected will be guaranteed access, that they will not be denied access in the times we live in?
15510	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	141	" I appreciate and understand all of that. When the national broadband plan was rolled out there was an expectation - Mr. Hendrick can tell me if it is not a legitimate expectation - that there would be a more timely intervention in those areas where there are serious gaps. I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type. There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability. Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product. Is NBI guaranteeing those speeds or is it, as set out in the small print, ""up to"" those speeds. There is a big difference between ""up to 1G"" and actually guaranteeing 1G. The term ""up to"" could mean anything up to that level. Those are the issues that we are trying to deal with here and that, as public representatives, we are trying to navigate. We are quite literally reflecting back to NBI what we are hearing on the ground from countless numbers of citizens in the types of villages mentioned, who are deeply frustrated that there is no intervention that appears to be serving them. Mr. Hendrick is telling me about something that is going to happen in the future, the future is now as far as those people are concerned. The pandemic has fast-tracked remote working and they want results now. What can I tell the people of Ballyhooly arising from my engagement with the witnesses today that would give them some hope that there will be an intervention to meet their needs and they will get a service?"

15512	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	707	 It is a nice segue that we are talking about the reliance on external advice. If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan. I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services. The figure I got back was €14.3 million, of which €10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project. If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received €3.9 million, EY business advisory services received €5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received €846,000. That adds up to approximately €10.1 million. Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned? The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice. None of us are against the idea of external advice. It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered. That is understood. However, €10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure. What were EY's business advisory services, for example? The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to €5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money. Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours? What is the Department getting for €5.3 million? What is it getting from Analysys Mason for €3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for €846,000 so far? That is only for 2021. It would be very useful if this committee had a further understanding of just how much money is being spent on consultancy services, not only for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - officials from that Department are here today - but for every Department of State, for that matter.

I am conscious he wants to develop the point but I have a limited amount of time.

What I would like is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of these costs. We need that for every single line Department that relies on external services and consultancy. I am not sure we have a deep understanding of that. Certainly, I speak for myself in that regard. The question then, and Mr. Griffin can fold this all into the reply in two minutes, is do I take it from his reply that the Department will continue to require the services of external consultants for this? If the answer to that is ""Yes"", which I think it is, for how long more will it require them? It has spent €10.1 million so far. What does Mr. Griffin anticipate the future spend will be on external services for the lifetime of this project?"

I think we all appreciate that there is a reliance on external services. We have all acknowledged that. I am merely asking at this juncture - I think Mr. Griffin was about to defer to his colleagues on the matter - about the breakdown of costs and to have sight of the breakdown of those costs. If I could come away in the short time I have with some understanding of that and a commitment that the Department will write to the committee in that regard, I would be grateful for that.

15518	SeanSherlock	Labour	17963.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-10 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	883	 With respect, Mr. Mulligan should understand that we are at the front line in understanding people's needs. We are the people who run constituency offices. We understand full well the significance of the NBP. We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service. I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it. I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI. I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved. I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made. Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out. The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation. I think we would all agree on that point. Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one. I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely. Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions. I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood. They need the access; that is the bottom line. They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation. If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that. Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go. They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at nbi.ie and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable. The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately. That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard. I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are. I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household. I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place. That is where people like are coming from, quite simply. We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made. We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions. My second point relates to the BCPs. How many BCPs are up and running and live as we speak?

I would like Mr. Griffin to go away from this meeting understanding that there is a little village in north County Cork called Ballyhooly, and I deliberately use the example of Ballyhooly because he will remember that name. There is a new estate in Ballyhooly called Lios Ard, peopled by the professionals I am talking about from all walks of life, and one half of the village can get broadband and the half other cannot. This is why I am frustrated by this amber mapping. We all bought into it and now it seems that this amber map has become such an arbitrary tool that we are going to end up with a situation where there will be those people who will have and those who will not all because of a mapping exercise, ultimately. I do not know what can be done about that. The question is: what can I tell the people in Lios Ard, Ballyhooly, tomorrow morning? They are representative of thousands of people throughout this State. What hope can I give them tomorrow morning that they are going to be guaranteed a connection? That is the bottom line. That is ultimately what people want to hear.

I understand there are a set of regulations going back to 2019 relating to standards in private rented accommodation, which are very clearly delineated. I am struck by the fact, notwithstanding Covid-19 and the inability of people to inspect private rented accommodation that is subject to housing assistance payments, or even the rental accommodation scheme as we used to know it, of the dramatic drop-off in the number of inspections taking place. The Minister's response to a parliamentary question I posed on 25 January clearly shows that up to quarter 3 of 2021, 11,731 inspections took place. Those are the most up-to-date figures I have. There may have been an advance on that since then.
15534	SeanSherlock	Labour	17970.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-02-17 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	58	 It was 2021. We are factoring in Covid-19. We know there will be a drop-off so the officials do not need to respond to that. That is a given and that is understood, but the number of prohibition notices that have been served out of those inspections is 15. Even if we track back, taking into account Covid-19, in 2018, approximately 28,000 inspections were carried out with 99 prohibition notices served. In 2019, 40,000 inspections were carried out with 106 notices served. In 2020, approximately 26,000 inspections were carried out with 57 notices served and, as I said, there were 11,700 inspections up to quarter 3 of 2021 with 15 notices served. Do the officials agree that the number of prohibition notices served is extremely low? I ask that because I have visited people of late who are in receipt of the housing assistance payment. To describe the conditions they are living in as Dickensian would be to put it mildly. I understand the local authorities have a tough job to do, but I would like to see some language coming from the Department in respect of buttressing the inspections regime by way of ensuring there is a clear policy that the regulations, which are laid down in law, are adhered to such that people have the right to live in some sort of decent accommodation. I invite the officials to visit some of these dwellings for themselves. They will see just how poor the level of accommodation is. These people are caught in a major bind because they cannot go back to their landlord to ask him or her to fix this or that as they would be out on their ear before they know it. This is a major issue right across society when we are paying €465 million on the housing assistance payment. We should look at the rent supplement figure from the Department of Social Protection for 2021. Under what we call provisional expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme 2021, the Department of Social Protection paid out €122,957,000 in rent supplement. We are paying out a massive amount of money. I can understand why we are doing so. We need to keep people in housing in the private rented sector until supply is sufficiently provided for, but the inspection regime is just not working. I ask the officials to please not come back to me with Covid-19 as a reason. A regime needs to be put in place such that the inspectorate is robust and local authorities are resourced commensurate with the number of properties in their purview. That is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us the metric of 60,000 tenancies and €465 million, which is coming in at, give or take, €7,800 per tenancy. Obviously, there has been no provision to revise upwards the rent provision to reflect the market in 2017. The Secretary General will tell me there is a working group on that but there needs to be a greater degree of urgency. If I could have an answer to that in two minutes or less, I would be delighted because there is one other issue I would like to cover as well.

I appreciate the answer. With regard to water services, as a typical Deputy trying to get schemes up off the ground in regard to wastewater treatment plants and sewage treatment plants, and generally improve the condition of services, in particular water services, I recognise that some very good projects are under way right across the country under the ambit of Irish Water. However, I am trying to understand what is the dynamic that is informing the relationship between Irish Water and the local authorities. Is it the case that the service level agreements that are in place between the two entities will be set aside, such that all staff are now to transfer across to Irish Water? If that is the case, what is the status of that process? That is the first question. The second question relates to whether a scheme will be provided where there are small settlements or villages where the local authority is ready to go on a project, but it is not necessarily on a priority list for Irish Water. Is there scope for the Department to step in to provide funding for local authorities for smaller schemes that are shovel-ready and that could get off the ground? It would have tremendous impact. If we do not have those types of schemes, people are subjected to an Irish Water list and they could be waiting until kingdom come to get their little village or settlement sorted out.

We will see what comes back and we will make a final decision next week regarding 24 March. On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings. The secretariat has established availability as follows: An Garda Síochána on 31 March and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission on 7 April. We discussed engaging with the Policing Authority as well, so I propose that the secretariat seek to schedule the Policing Authority on the afternoon of 31 March, the same date on which we will be engaging with An Garda Síochána. Is that agreed? Agreed. Alternatively, we could schedule it for 7 April.

15547	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	47	 To continue on a similar vein to the Chairman, in respect of HSE national service plan and its relationship with the health Vote, is Mr. Reid aware of the report commissioned by the Parliamentary Budget Office?
15548	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	49	 Mr. Reid will be aware that the report states, “The programming of expenditure under the Health Vote was another priority of Future Health and aligning the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE’s internal allocations would make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more direct.” The key words there are “what the Oireachtas approves”. We are elected by the people and we approve the expenditure, and the HSE spends the money and has that relationship with the Department of Health and the line Minister of the day. Ultimately, there is an accountability mechanism here. The Comptroller and Auditor General holds a constitutional position. If he is making reference in his opening remarks to that specific report, that report has to be taken seriously by the HSE. It is important. Let us not make light of it. It is a vital transparency mechanism.
15549	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	51	 On the accountability mechanism, consider what happens when a mere mortal like me, who represents the people of Cork East, submits a parliamentary question on CAMHS, as I did in January when I sought information on the number of persons waiting to be seen by CAMHS by local health office, in tabular form, and the length of time persons were waiting to be seen. It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan. The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357. When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone. If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting. For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4. What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas. When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations. I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard. It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly. If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach? In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families. We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed. From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done. How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?

What is the current status of the children's disability network teams?
15551	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	56	 Does Ms O'Connor consider them to be working?

Again, it is almost Kafkaesque that they are in this vortex of constant form-filling. They feel extremely frustrated. Can Ms O'Connor sympathise and empathise with their experience of children's disability network teams so far?

I am not a specialist in this field so I rely on the information being imparted to me by the HSE. Would person-to-person intervention not have been the starting point anyway as opposed to sending people into an assessment process that some families describe as nightmarish? I am going to leave it at that because I have three minutes left in my slot. I ask our guests to have regard to that and to be conscious of the points we are making as we reflect them for our constituents. What is the status of the Owenacurra Centre? I am told it is an approved centre. Will our guests explain what, in HSE speak, an ""approved centre"" is?"
15554	SeanSherlock	Labour	17991.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-03-10 00:00:00	Mental Health Services - Financial Statements 2020	63	" The Mental Health Commission is clear in its definition. It states an approved centre is intended ""to provide in-patient treatment to people suffering from mental illness. The MHC maintains a register of all approved centres."" The chief executive stated the HSE is going to move to close the Owenacurra Centre. Will Mr. Reid reconsider that position? I am not convinced, and I imagine I speak comfortably for all the Members of the Oireachtas who represent the Cork East constituency, there is a proper, fit-for-purpose local alternative solution to respond to the centre’s closure. Mr. Reid made reference in his opening remarks to Glenwood, but from what I can see in the planning application, that is not to be designated as an approved centre. In fact, there was no mention of the fact it would become an approved centre. Right now, there are 11 people who do not know where they are supposed to go, yet they have expressed a clear will and preference. Mr. Reid used the expression ""will and preference"". I would contend that as long as they continue to express a will and preference to stay at the Owenacurra Centre, they should be allowed to do so for as long as is necessary, in accordance with their will and preference. I do not believe our guests have presented to us a fit-for-purpose and local alternative for them. Sending them 30 km up the road is not a solution. That is not how we treat people in this day and age. If they continue to express a will and preference not to move, that must be respected. Furthermore, the moneys the HSE has spent on improving the Owenacurra Centre have to be taken into account. I understand more than €359,000 has been spent there since 2016. There is no alternative for the residents at present. Our guests have presented the Carrigaline centre as an alternative, but it is not an approved centre. The residents – 11 souls - are almost being cast out. I ask Mr. Reid to please reconsider and to have a bit of heart in respect of these people."

The request can be made. That can be done but, certainly, there can be no means of compelling its representatives to attend because it is a private company. Once upon a time, it was a semi-State but even commercial semi-States are not compelled, although if that was the case, there would be a greater level of expectation that it would attend. At this stage, however, Eir has been a private company since 1999. I suggest, to be fair to Deputy Dillon, that we put it off until the next meeting of the committee and we deal with it then, finally, one way or the other. I do not want to defer it any longer. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next item on the agenda is the work programme. Next week is a non-sitting week due to Lá le Pádraig. The week after that, on 24 March, we will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. As usual, if there are any particular matters of interest to members that they would like to receive a briefing on in advance of the meeting, please let the clerk know. On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings for which the following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda Síochána on 31 March, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April. There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April. That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service. That is the last confirmed meeting. We previously agreed that we will engage with the University of Limerick, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the meeting with the Department of Justice, but these meetings have not yet been scheduled. On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE’s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE’s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House. The committee did that for a good reason. Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee. The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented. In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE’s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer. The next available date is 5 May. We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well. I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that. What order do members wish to take those meetings in? Does anybody have any views on that? Okay. The next available date is 5 May. We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee. Is that agreed? Agreed. We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well. I will request the secretariat try to schedule those meetings. Obviously, it will depend on their availability as well. We had quite a strong engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health this morning so we will check that. For the month of May, we will have the HSE and the Department of Health on the same day. We will try to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick because there are a number of issues relating to it that we want to examine. We can try to schedule meetings with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. We will leave that with the secretariat and ask it to get dates that are suitable for all involved and that fit in with our work programme.

Do any members wish to raise any other matters? No. The committee will now go into private session before adjourning until 24 March 2022, when it will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland regarding its 2020 financial statements.

I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that. What order do members wish to take those meetings in? Does anybody have any views on that? Okay. The next available date is 5 May. We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee. Is that agreed? Agreed. We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well. I will request the secretariat try to schedule those meetings. Obviously, it will depend on their availability as well. We had quite a strong engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health this morning so we will check that. For the month of May, we will have the HSE and the Department of Health on the same day. We will try to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick because there are a number of issues relating to it that we want to examine. We can try to schedule meetings with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. We will leave that with the secretariat and ask it to get dates that are suitable for all involved and that fit in with our work programme.

Do any members wish to raise any other matters? No. The committee will now go into private session before adjourning until 24 March 2022, when it will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland regarding its 2020 financial statements.

She is very welcome. Any dealings I have had with her have always been honourable, honest and straightforward. Although very rarely have I agreed with her from a politically ideological position, I have to say that my dealings with her have always been honest, straightforward and forthright. Could I focus on the funding position in respect of the HEA? Based on correspondence we have received, we are given to understand that core funding amounting to €1.7 million has been withheld to date. Is that the current position?

To my knowledge, there are not enough people in proper career progression. Many lecturers are still below the bar and are going from contract to contract. I speak for staff within the University of Limerick. It seems to me that if there is a withdrawal or holding back of funding, it stymies the ability of the university to fulfill its mission and obligations to its own staff but also its wider mission to the mid-west and Munster region. I say this as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation. I am very much aware of the work of EPI-STEM, Lero and other such entities and the translational effect of the research provided by the University of Limerick. I worry that if the HEA is withholding funding, it will have a downstream effect on the university's ability to allow staff to progress from below the bar to above the bar positions or to allow the university to ensure that people progress and that there is a career path for employees within the university. Is it the case that the holding back of this funding is affecting staff's ability to progress?

This is all money that has been spent on external services. Will the president tell me why the university spending €595,000 on project management services and what are these services? That is my first question for her. Also, in respect of the brand refresh and implementation, €87,000 would pay the fees for one lecturer above the bar, if I can put it that way. My focus here is on staff and students, on what they are receiving and on what I would call their rights and entitlements. It seems to me the amount of money, which is approximately €3.1 million and is a significant amount, is all money that has been in spent on external services that could reasonably have been expected to be ploughed into investing in staff, educational output, and research output.

In 2019, the university spent €1.04 million on legal expenditure alone. It is a hell of a lot of money on legal fees.

Two meetings have also been confirmed in June, namely, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 2 June and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 June. We also agreed to schedule an engagement to examine local government oversight and accountability in June. If we were to hold one engagement in relation to local government on 23 June, that would leave three meeting slots before the summer recess. I ask members to review the work programme in advance of next week’s meeting so that we can prioritise engagements for those remaining meeting slots. We had a discussion earlier about how to handle the local government issue and agreed that we would bring in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Is that agreed? Agreed. Again, I ask members to review the suggestions that were submitted for the work programme and to let the clerk know if there is any issue they would like to prioritise for the vacant slots before the summer recess and we can agree them next week. As there are no matters that members wish to raise in relation to the work programme, I will take it as agreed. As I said, if there are any specific items of interest, please revert to the clerk. Is there any other business that members wish to raise? As everyone is happy, we will adjourn the meeting now.

Again, I ask members to review the suggestions that were submitted for the work programme and to let the clerk know if there is any issue they would like to prioritise for the vacant slots before the summer recess and we can agree them next week. As there are no matters that members wish to raise in relation to the work programme, I will take it as agreed. As I said, if there are any specific items of interest, please revert to the clerk. Is there any other business that members wish to raise? As everyone is happy, we will adjourn the meeting now.

15575	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	284	 I join other Members in congratulating the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his elevation and wish him well for the future.
15576	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	 If I am in order——
15577	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	 I thank sincerely the people of Cork East for the privilege they have afforded me by electing me to the House.  I look forward to working for them and on their behalf. To be blunt, the Minister's reply has been heard many times before.  He did not answer the question as I posed it and as it pertained to the Greencore site specifically.  Although he met the Taoiseach and others in March 2006, much progress has been made since, in so far as a special local area plan has been adopted for Mallow.  I was glad to participate in drawing up the plan, in which we designated 30 acres within the site to be used as a high environmental, quality enterprise and employment zone.  The question on everyone's lips in Mallow and north Cork is whether an enterprise will be located on the site.  The north Cork and wider east Cork region has been dealt a savage blow in terms of job losses and the people of Mallow have high expectations for the site.  The Minister should state whether there is a specific proposal because before the general election a Government backbencher made an announcement to the effect that an American company would make an announcement on job creation.  Was the Minister aware of this so-called announcement?  If such negotiations took place, did they bear fruit?
15578	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 As for the Government's support for the workers when the redundancy argument was ongoing, it washed its hands of the issue.
15579	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	 Were it not for the intervention of Mallow Town Council and the members of Cork County Council, I believe strongly they would not have received their redundancy payments.
15580	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	 A statement was made by a Government backbencher prior to the election to the effect that an announcement on job creation at that site was imminent.  The Minister has not answered this question adequately.
15581	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	301	 The people of Mallow would like to know whether the jobs are coming.
15582	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	284	 They are indeed.
15583	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	 They are indeed.
15584	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	 They are indeed.

15587	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	 They are indeed.
15588	SeanSherlock	Labour	12628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	301	 They are indeed.
15589	SeanSherlock	Labour	12713.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter: the proposal under the national cancer strategy to close 13 cancer services located throughout the country, particularly breast cancer services at Mallow General Hospital.
15590	SeanSherlock	Labour	12713.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 There are two aspects to the question put down by the Deputy.  The first relates to siltation at the harbour and in this regard a Dumping at Sea Permit was issued to the council on 22 December 2006 to facilitate maintenance dredging. The second aspect relates to the drafting and acceptance by the relevant parties of a lease in respect of the proposed breakwater at Buncrana.  The council requested a reduction or total waiver of foreshore charges on the basis that the facility was to be used by the RNLI. Following extensive discussions and as an exceptional matter, the Department, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, informed the council that it would consider waiving the rental charges if the council could confirm that the proposed facility would be for the exclusive use of the RNLI.   In addition, the council was also informed that if it was unable to confirm that the facility would be used exclusively by the RNLI, the Department was prepared to apply a reduced rental charge based on the ratio of usage of the facility by the RNLI. On 20th December last the council confirmed that the works being proposed at Buncrana Harbour are being constructed solely for the use of the RNLI and are not being constructed for the benefit of any other party.    On foot of this confirmation the Department entered into detailed discussions and correspondence with the Chief State Solicitor's Office with a view to preparing an appropriate draft lease, which will best facilitate the council's proposal and also safeguard the State's ongoing interest in the management and protection of the foreshore in the public interest. The draft lease will involve the insertion of specific conditions, which will reflect the fact that the arrangements involved are unusual and are based on the need to provide a permanent location for the RNLI, which will enable the launch of their boat on a 24-hour basis.  The Department's discussions with the Chief State Solicitor's Office have focussed on the public interest provisions of the Foreshore Acts, the proposed arrangements which the Council will need to make with the RNLI and other legal issues designed to protect the interests of all parties.  The lease, when drafted, will require the agreement of all relevant parties. Every effort is being made to expedite the completion of the draft lease and, to that end, a further meeting has been scheduled between my Department and the County Council to further clarify outstanding issues. 
15591	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 I raised this question in the context that Ireland has up to €8.1 billion in food exports on an annual basis.  Recently we saw that approximately 1.3 million tonnes of pigmeat are imported from outside the EU into Ireland and then branded and packaged here.  My question is based on the fact that Irish pig producers are rapidly going into decline because long-established brands are being marketed in such a way as to give the impression that they use Irish pig meat.  The European Union is currently reviewing the conditions and I understand the issue may be only within the competence of the Union.  However, the Government has a certain responsibility in the issue.  If there is no provision in our law to amend legislation, I call on the Government to ensure that labelling, through marketing and Bord Bia, is done in such a way as to ensure that where a consumer purchases a product perceived to be Irish, a clear label is attached to the product attesting to that fact.  This has serious implications for pig producers and I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the Government is making provisions in that regard.
15592	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 Is the Minister aware that Galtee Foods in Mitchelstown, a company that has sustained people in the area for many years, recently closed?  One of the main reasons is the clear perception among consumers that, though its products were branded as Irish, they were imported and the Galtee brand has diminished in stature as a result.  It is a result of a certain degree of Government intransigence on the issue that we now see the demise of a traditional company and the Government needs to do more to ensure the industry, which has sustained many farming families for a long time, is supported.
15593	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 I preface my question by stating the strong belief within my party that the loss of an industry that sustained many farm families and industrial workers throughout the land for generations was a travesty. I put it to the Minister that the Indecon report, on which the Government based its recommendations, was incorrect.  The Government, therefore, cost taxpayers untold sums of money and put them through the process of going to the High Court which subsequently reversed the decision.  It was utterly needless and a waste of taxpayers' money.  Will the Minister respond on that issue?  The fundamental question is when the restructuring package will be introduced and the growers paid.  What level of consultation has there been with growers on the issue?  Has there been final and full agreement on the matter?
15594	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	259	 The Indecon report is important.  I want to find out exactly how much the Indecon report cost the taxpayer, how much it cost to go to the High Court.  The issue here concerns the public purse and how moneys are expended on behalf of taxpayers.  Can the Minister guarantee that Greencore will not challenge this decision which, although it has been taken at a political level, has yet to go through the board of Greencore?  It should be stated that the Minister is a shareholder or has a golden share in that company.
15595	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	303	 We have heard the quintessential civil servant's answer.  Every farmer takes responsibility for ragwort or any noxious weed.  Nevertheless, it exists extensively throughout the country.  One can have all the public awareness and information campaigns in the world, but action is needed. Would the Minister consider funding local authorities to ensure this blight is wiped out, particularly on roadside verges?  Farmers and landowners take responsibility for noxious weeks when they occur on their land.
15596	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	350	 I take the view that the glass is half full but there is a trend in Irish agriculture of flight from the land.  This is largely due to global trends.
15597	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 The WTO is influenced mainly by global corporations and that has an effect on small Irish family farms.  Will the Minister bear that in mind when she attends WTO talks or Council of Ministers' meetings?
15598	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 The information requested by the Deputy is being compiled by my Department and will be furnished to the Deputy within the next week.
15599	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 The information requested by the Deputy is being compiled by my Department and will be furnished to the Deputy within the next week.

15605	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter of public interest: the serious economic and employment implications for the Cork East constituency and Cork in general following the announcement that the Amgen project which was to deliver more than 1,000 jobs is not to proceed, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the background to the decision and the steps he intends to take to ensure the project proceeds or is replaced as a matter of urgency.
15606	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 On a point of order, considerable amounts of taxpayers' money have been expended on attracting this industry to Cork East and the people of the region——
15607	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	 ——want to know exactly how much was spent.  We are seeking to bring the Minister before the House so that we can have an opportunity to ask him those relevant questions.
15608	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	283	 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The announcement by Amgen has come as a body-blow to the east Cork region.  The economic loss to Carrigtwohill and surrounding areas is unquantifiable.  I empathise with those people who have lost their jobs in the company.  While global corporate entities like Amgen are subject to the vagaries of international markets, the people of the region accepted in good faith statements made by the company in April that a delay of two years in the project would not amount to a complete cessation of it.  I put it to the Minister that a second announcement yesterday to the effect that the project is indefinitely postponed is nothing more than spin and a deliberate attempt to play down the decision not to proceed.  Anyone with common sense must conclude that two postponements in six months is tantamount to a cessation. The Government has serious questions to answer.  Questions arise as to whether Amgen or IDA Ireland is the beneficial owner of the site at which the project was to proceed.  We must also ask what will happen to the site in the event of a further postponement or acknowledgement of cessation.  The project was to be the mainstay of the region and Middleton, Youghal and other centres of population had placed their bets on it.  Many young people invested in housing in the region on foot of the promise of foreign direct investment by Amgen.  I put it to the Minister that we have been dealt a hammer blow and that people are extremely disappointed.  Expectation in this context has not been managed well by the Government, which now has a serious case to answer.  The Minister has a responsibility to deliver to the people of the region.
15609	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	 Am I allowed to make a point of order?
15610	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 On a point of order, the Minister said he is teasing out the ownership of the site.
15611	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	 That needs to be a distinguished comment.
15612	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the regional fisheries board routinely fulfilling its role under Section 294 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 as amended by Section 17 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991 and therefore I have no function in the matter.

15623	SeanSherlock	Labour	12733.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-17 00:00:00	Prelude	82	 I ask the Taoiseach to report on the progress of the decentralisation of Fáilte Ireland to Mallow and Bus Éireann to Mitchelstown.  These two towns, which have been decimated by job losses, held high expectations of the decentralisation process and made many preparatory plans.  There has been no reporting on the decentralisation process as it pertains to these towns and we would like to know what exactly is going on.

15631	SeanSherlock	Labour	12739.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	206	 Congratulations, Deputy.
15632	SeanSherlock	Labour	12739.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	287	" I wish to share time with Deputies Martin Ferris and Mary Upton. If Deputies Doyle and Connaughton are selling those calves, they might give me a shout because I am thinking of increasing my herd by 200%. I speak in support of the Fine Gael motion.  Between 2005 and 2006, the agrifood sector accounted for 163,400 jobs, or 8.1% of the working population.  Irish agrifood exports accounted for more than €8 billion.  As a country we discount the importance of this sector of the economy at our peril.  At a time when increased consolidation of the agrifood sector is driving the market, we must not forget the importance of ensuring that consumer interests are maintained.  We must also continue to ensure that the protection of consumer health lies at the core of agriculture and food policy. In recent times, the standards set for Irish farmers in the production of beef and pig meat are not being subscribed to by producers from third countries who have access to Irish and European markets.  In essence, Irish farmers are being asked to ensure that their produce is of the highest standard before going to market while their counterparts in countries outside the European Union can compete on an uneven playing field.  The regulatory framework is clearly not working in this instance.  The EU legislative framework, as it stands, works against the Irish farm family and the competitiveness of Irish agriculture is compromised as a result.  More important, the health of the Irish consumer is compromised if there is so much as the slightest doubt about the standard of produce being imported into Irish markets from third countries.  Brazilian beef is a case in point.  Brazilian producers in many instances produce to the highest standard but there are legitimate concerns about the traceability and production methods of some Brazilian beef which finds its way on to Irish tables. This motion rightly calls for a regulatory framework to ensure that all operators produce to the highest standard.  As a country, we must ensure our competitive advantage in the production of beef.  If third country producers are not operating to the same standard as ours and if there is a risk to the Irish and European consumer, the EU Food and Veterinary Office must be given the legislative teeth to expedite a ban or other such mechanism within a reasonable timeframe to address the concerns of Irish farm families and consumers.  Government policy on the protection of consumers in so far as it pertains to guarding against health risks in food importation is too weak at present. On substantial transformation, I realise that responsibility for the enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The issue of substantial transformation, whereby a primary product can enter Ireland, be processed in some way and subsequently be branded as Irish, is governed by EU legislation.  However, it is not good enough that the Government would hide behind EU legislation in tackling this problem, nor is it good enough for the Minister to say it can only be amended at EU level.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled on 3 October last, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent, expressed the following concern: ... this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and the Minister has raised our concerns at EU Council level. If the Minister of State shares my concerns, we need to know how he will address them and what proactive measures he will take to ensure the viability of producers and confidence of consumers, who should be the primary concern.  It is not sufficient for him to say: ""The concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem."" A weak legislative base on labelling allows consumers to be duped into believing products of the kind in question are of Irish origin.  The Government's primary concern must be to protect the health of consumers and ensure the competitiveness of Irish farming.  In seeking to be proactive on this matter, we must work with the farming organisations and processors to ensure that the quality assurance mark takes pride of place on every packet leaving the factory floor.  A clear marketing strategy, with a strengthening of legislation, is the key to solving this problem. On 3 October last I asked the Minister if she would amend legislation to ensure that foodstuffs of foreign origin would not be labelled as ""produced in Ireland"", ""processed in Ireland"" or ""sourced and produced in Ireland"".  I asked the question to remedy the circumstances whereby consumer and producer interests are not being protected and to ensure that our comparative advantage as a nation would be maintained.  I realise the Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and that food labelling is governed by Directive 2000/13/EC. The Government stated in response to the Commission paper Labelling, Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation for the EU, published in 2002, that there is an unsatisfactory practice at play regarding substantive transformation.  The Government made certain recommendations in this regard but they have not come to fruition.  Why has the Commission not acted on the Irish recommendations to date and why has the Minister not been more proactive on the matter?  The Commission is now preparing to forward proposals but I understand this involves a co-decision procedure.  We could be back in this House in 12 months still with no resolution to the issue of substantial transformation.  I urge the Minister to fast-track the process, where possible."
15633	SeanSherlock	Labour	12739.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	291	 On 29 September last, the Irish Farmers Journal reported that Reox Holdings, a subsidiary of Dairygold, was in the process of selling Breeo Foods.  Breeo Foods carries top brands such as Dairygold, Shaws, Galtee Meats, Roscrea, Mitchelstown, Calvita and Sno.  These brands are long-established in the minds of consumers and are perceived to be Irish in origin and content.  The truth is otherwise and some of these brands are marketed in a way that suggests they are Irish.  In the minds of pig producers and workers in Mitchelstown and beyond, the closure of Galtee Foods was as a direct result of substantial transformation. If there is to be no provision in Irish law to amend legislation in the short term, the Government should ensure that labelling, through a proper marketing strategy by Bord Bia, will be implemented clearly.  The Government must also allow open access to those plants that are being marketed by Bord Bia to ensure that the content of all produce is as it says on the packet or tin.  I am not ashamed to say we must protect our national interest.  We have a comparative advantage over other countries and we must maintain this competitive edge.  The future of Irish agriculture depends upon it. It is not my job to criticise the Government for the sake of criticism but it is necessary to critically assess its response to agricultural issues as they arise.  The Labour Party is not against the science of genetic modification and does not adopt a fundamentalist view thereon.  We believe biotechnology can coexist with natural biodiversity without compromising the latter.  It is in this context that we seek to ensure that the competitiveness of Irish agriculture is maintained.  With that in mind, it is beyond our comprehension that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food chose to abstain from a crucial vote on genetically modified animal feeds at a meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels last month.  The Minister's logic for this abstention, that is, that it did not affect the eventual outcome, is beyond belief. We welcome the fact that the European Commission will move to approve genetically modified feed imports.  The internal party machinations of the Green Party are of no concern to us.  What is of concern to us is the need to ensure that the EU scientific committee moves at a pace that is in keeping with the market and provides for a level playing pitch for Irish agriculture.  The Government's intransigence on this issue, by way of abdicating its responsibility, is grossly negligent and undermines our ability to negotiate on further matters of this nature. We support the Fine Gael motion.  It marks a pragmatic approach to the best means of maintaining the competitiveness of Irish agriculture while protecting the right of consumers to perfect knowledge of their purchases and ensures that Irish farming families can compete on a level playing pitch.

The company has had two postponements.  On 15 October, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin met with Amgen.  The people of Carrigtwohill and the region want to find out what the future holds for Amgen.  Is it in a position to state whether it will proceed with the plant?  If anybody is to be accused of playing politics with this issue it is the members of the Minister's party and his backbenchers.

15639	SeanSherlock	Labour	12740.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-24 00:00:00	Prelude	192	 We all accept the vagaries of the international market, that negotiations are delicate and that landmark projects of this nature sometimes do not proceed.  If Amgen is retaining ownership of the site, the people of the region will want to know why it is doing so when they have postponed the project twice.  Is the Minister continuing negotiations with Amgen?  Will Amgen make a final decision on its intentions in a reasonable time?  The people of the region want to know where Amgen is going?  If it does not locate within the site will someone else do so? Given that €4 million has been expended to attract this industry, a legitimate question hangs over the use of taxpayers' money to attract industry.  The Amgen project could be used as a benchmark for foreign direct investment projects throughout the country and for global trends in industries of that nature.  If the global financial and economic infrastructure is changing and Amgen can make a sudden decision of this nature, questions must be posed regarding the nature of foreign direct investment throughout Ireland.  That is why we are asking these questions.

15651	SeanSherlock	Labour	12747.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-31 00:00:00	Prelude	563	" He would have given me more time but I am sure he will address the salient points in the argument. There is a gross disparity resulting from the outsourcing of driver testing to private companies.  The list of centres on the on-line driving application form on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, website does not include every centre to which drivers may apply.  I know of people who waited months for their test only to be informed by telephone that it had been outsourced to a private company at a test centre other than the one to which they had applied.  They received no notification of this change in writing. Applicants who move to live in another part of the country encounter serious difficulties in transferring their application to test centres at their new location.  I know a man who applied for a driving test in Tallaght where he was living but who later moved permanently to Mallow.  He sought in writing to do his test at the Mallow test centre.  Since then he has received two test dates from SGS in Tallaght.  He has received no correspondence acknowledging his request to change test centres.  SGS management told him it had nothing to do with the contract for testing in Cork.  He will soon have to move to his third provisional licence before receiving a driving test date. The testing system is farcical and until this is sorted out, the rate of fully qualified drivers will increase only marginally, not at the rate the Government and the RSA anticipate, certainly not in the ten week timescale determined by the Minister or, as he put it, ""on demand""."

The timelines are as we anticipated and I welcome the establishment of the consultative committee.  I refer the Minister to a speech given by Commissioner Fischer Boel in Paris last month.  She referred to the Health Check, the strengthening of competitiveness, supporting rural society and so on.  It was all very aspirational in its aims.  Farmers are worried about the issues of cross-compliance and modulation under the single payment scheme and, particularly, whether the Commission will place upper or lower limits on payments to them under the scheme in the context of the Health Check.  They are worried about the nature of cross compliance and the stringent controls under which they are placed.  Has the Government defined a clear negotiating position on those issues because farmers have strong views on them?

15657	SeanSherlock	Labour	12753.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	134	 I thank the Minister of State for his verbose answer and his advertising blurb for RTE.  I appreciate the fact that Bord Bia and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs through the Leader programme are doing much to encourage farmers' markets.  However, on the ground, many farmers' markets are striving — I will not say they are struggling — to boost their popularity locally.  Much of this work is done through voluntary effort.  While programmes are in place through Leader to help them, if some sort of direct support was made available to them for advertising through local media, it would be of great assistance to them. Judging from the Minister of State's answer, he is not telling me that his Department necessarily will be directly responsible for that and I accept this point.  I also accept the fact that there is serious potential within this country for the growth of local markets.  Will the Minister of State consider the idea of direct finance for marketing and advertising?

15664	SeanSherlock	Labour	12755.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 As previously stated, most recently in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 530 on 9 October 2007, the approach to determining the hardship payments is fair and reasonable and there are no plans to revise the scheme. The €25m Salmon Hardship Scheme adopted by Government is intended to provide a measure of relief to individiuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of mixed stock fishing for wild salmon. The overall sum takes account of the levels of payment recommended by the Independent Group and the recorded catch history of the eligible licensees. An additional €5 million is being provided under a Community Support Scheme, the focus of which primarily will be those communities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric of the area.
15665	SeanSherlock	Labour	12761.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-14 00:00:00	Prelude	206	 The transfer of functions to the Department of Transport seems logical and laudable in some respects.  It can only be effective if it deals with a certain range of issues.  I can only speak for my constituency of Cork East and for the general Cork area, where funding for non-national roads has been absolutely derisory.  If this Bill is to mean anything, it must ensure funding is effective and will trickle down through the various divisions within Cork County Council and its engineering areas. What we have seen to date is that roads prioritised under Transport 21 receive funding, which is welcome, but non-national roads or secondary roads receive no funding whatsoever.  The N72 and N73 are particular examples.  If we are to take Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, which are on those routes, one will serve the main tourist route between Waterford and Killarney and the other will serve the main route from Kanturk, west of Mallow and through to Dublin. Mallow currently has hub-town status but we are not getting the trickle-down effect of financial incentives to create the northern relief road, which is vital to a town like Mallow and its surrounding areas in terms of its attractiveness for inward investment and the creation of infrastructure around the town. We need a change in policy and funding for roads such as these.  They are vital arteries for towns such as Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, but they have become dangerous roads because of a lack of proper funding.  To travel the road from Mallow to Mitchelstown on a day such as today, in some instances one is taking one's life in one's hands.  Two lorries cannot pass each other comfortably on some parts of the road without stopping or slowing down to speeds of 5 km/h or 10 km/h.  That speaks volumes about the Government not investing properly in such infrastructure. Deputy Ferris spoke of community involvement and local improvement schemes.  There is almost a begging-bowl mentality in this regard for public representatives such as myself.  I have to go cap in hand to local area engineers to seek funding or to have certain roads prioritised within divisional engineering areas, which is completely ludicrous in this day and age.  If people pay road tax and a development contribution for the building of a house in a rural part of the county, I do not see why they should have to pay extra to have a road included in a local improvement or community involvement scheme.  These people should have the same rights and entitlements as any other citizen of this State to have the road outside their houses in an acceptable condition. The Cork to Limerick road also speaks volumes about Government policy, as we in Mallow and north Cork have been waiting for this northern relief road but are almost at the mercy of Transport 21 and the funding streams of the NRA.  There is also the question of whether the NRA will get the requisite funding to be able to create the Atlantic corridor between Cork and Limerick, and whether a spur will be created for the northern relief road. These are policy issues as to how funding is implemented at the local level but they have a great effect on people's lives.  That is what we are speaking to in debating this legislation.  Will a change in legislation bring about a marked increase in the quality of people's lives, as we must ensure it does? I spoke about development contributions and the current funding of local government is completely inequitable.  If a young couple applies for planning permission today, they will be levied at exorbitant rates for contributions on the building of their house.  It adds to the cost of building and they do not see a return in terms of increased lighting or improvements in the road surface outside the house.  The money is centralised within the county council and then divvied out through the division.  The northern division of a county council would compete with the southern division for funding into specific areas. The entire area of Government policy as it pertains to roads must be looked at.  If we are to enhance the quality of people's lives, any effect or change in the legislation must ensure this happens.
15666	SeanSherlock	Labour	12761.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-14 00:00:00	Prelude	476	 If the Government's proposals succeed, there will be dire consequences for the provision of not-for-profit child care and the significant contribution made by this sector to our communities will be rolled back.  Any changes to the subvention structure under the national child care investment programme that result in a reduction in staffing levels will mean a reduction in funds available to pay staff in many community-based child care centres.  This possibility contradicts the commitment in the national development plan to provide an additional 28,000 child care places and 8,000 jobs in child care.  It could be argued that this subvention is being introduced in reverse.  That is to say, the highest rate of subvention is being suggested for parents who are in receipt of full social welfare.  If a parent stops receiving social welfare and takes up employment that parent's subvention for child care is reduced.  This reduces the incentive to take up employment. The Government, through its actions, is contradicting its own stated policy.  At present, community child care facilities serve a mix of families reflective of the local community.  If this subvention scheme is implemented according to the current proposals, community child care facilities may be seen as centres at which only the children of social welfare recipients are facilitated.  This is contrary to any social inclusion remit.  How will working families on marginal incomes who are not entitled to any form of State support have access to affordable child care?  Community child care facilities which have been in receipt of staffing grants since 2002 will now be obliged to consider increasing their fees as a result of these measures.  Where is the commitment to quality child care centres and to the benefits of early childhood education and socialisation?  Where is the commitment to the volunteers all over the country who have given of their time, and are still doing so, to find sites, apply for funding, fill in forms, set up services and become employers?  I call on the Government to rethink its proposals and let common sense prevail.

Although no specific legislative proposal is due to come before the House, will the Government, in view of the serious nature and importance of the issue, make arrangements for such a debate?
15670	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	 I accept the Taoiseach's point.  The matter will obviously be discussed by the joint committee.  However, in view of its serious nature, it is worthy of a debate in the House.
15671	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	264	 I wish to share time with Deputy Wall.
15672	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	266	 In speaking to this motion one wonders what is the Government's primary motivation in putting it before the House.  It is not a legislative proposal.  It contains no concrete provisions.  It is short on detail and long on aspiration and therein lies the rub.  The Government is high on aspiration but low on delivery.  The motion is so broad that one senses there is a clear agenda by the Government to pay lip service to the idea of addressing the young people's issues throughout this island.  What young people want are concrete legislative proposals that will speak directly to their concerns.  These concerns are well documented and have been brought to Government through representative bodies such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI.  The NYCI is a social partner and the genuineness of this motion will be measured by the Government's response to concerns outlined by groups such as the NYCI.  I fear, however, that this motion is meaningless and full of platitudes and that young people have become used to hearing from a Government about the provision of services. In the limited time afforded to me I wish to address a number of specific areas.  The first relates to the health of children and our young people.  The NYCI, in its budget submission, calls on the Government to deliver on its promise to double the income threshold for full medical card entitlements for parents of children under six years of age in this year's budget.  I believe this is attainable.  The Government must look positively on this proposal.  Approximately 1.1 million children and young people under the age of 18 live in Ireland.  According to the NYCI, only 305,000 of them are covered under the medical card scheme.  Access to a GP is vital to ensure that a young person can avail of services to assist him or her through these difficult years.  A young person needs to be able to do this without incurring a financial cost.  This service would serve as a positive move that would give young people the confidence and independence to avail of vital services but in a way that would ensure confidentiality.  Young people living in rural areas in particular where counselling and other services are not readily available would benefit in particular.  The Government must also look favourably on families with children over the age of seven and under the age of 18 with a view to ensuring that income thresholds are raised to allow more children to avail of primary and secondary health care. The second issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of adequate facilities and services for young people who are in need of counselling and require access to mental health facilities.  In my constituency of Cork East the organisation Lets Get Together was set up to help others affected by suicide and to examine ways of preventing it.  In 2005 the Lets Get Together Foundation linked up with a number of similar organisations throughout the country to set up an all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy, thereby raising awareness of the issue and speaking to local and national media.  If this motion is to mean anything, the Government must assist organisations of this nature.  The highest rate of suicide is found among young men aged under 35 — this age group accounts for 40% of all Irish suicides.  There is a clear lack of a coherent Government policy to encourage young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives to talk to others about it.  The lack of available facts on a range of health and lifestyle issues linking potential users to relevant help services throughout the country is exacerbating the travesty of suicide which has reached epidemic proportions throughout this land.  We have the fifth highest suicide rate in Europe among the 15 to 25 year age group and death by suicide is the number one cause of death among young Irish men.  The Government, if it is serious about this motion, needs to fund more campaigns of representative organisations such as the NYCI, through the primary care strategy, to reduce the large number of deaths by suicide.  Awareness must be raised.  Young people need options and to be able to access them in a safe and non-judgmental manner.  We have all experienced tough times.  Many of us have been fortunate in that we had family and friends to support us.  Not every young person has that luxury.  Issues such as coming out to parents, unexpected pregnancy, low self-esteem and depression need to be tackled in a non-judgmental way. On the issue of unwanted pregnancies, now that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has admitted that VAT on condoms can be cut to as low as 5%, will she not bring a proposal to Cabinet that the Minister for Finance should cut the tax from 21% to 5%, as was done in the UK and other EU member states?  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has stated that 32% of people have indicated that the cost of contraception is a major factor in the decision not to use condoms, resulting in a rising incidence of sexually transmitted disease and unintended pregnancies.  I could go on as there are many issues.  However, since I am sharing with my colleague, Deputy Wall, I am happy to do so and will leave it at that.
15673	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	387	 I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The Defence Forces camp at Kilworth, County Cork, has been designated as the location for a prison covering Munster and it will replace facilities at Cork Prison in particular.  The proposed location of the prison will be within the 1,200 acre camp located close to the M8 motorway between Mitchelstown and Fermoy and it is destined to house up to 450 prisoners.  On Monday last, the residents of the immediate area called public representatives to a meeting to discuss the proposals and to air their genuine concerns.  In seeking this Adjournment debate, I wish to speak about a number of those concerns.  Given that this prison will be constructed under the terms of the strategic infrastructure legislation, there is genuine concern that local residents' fears will not be addressed.  The construction of such a large prison within a very rural area raises a number of fears.  For example, landowners who leased land from the Department of Defence for agricultural purposes now wonder where their future lies.  They had a long-standing arrangement and have asked will they be able to stay on the land or will this scenario change. People have also asked whether the land acquisition process for the prison has been completed.  If not, there is a strong school of thought within the community that the footprint of the prison should be moved to a more suitable location within the overall landholding.  The community also believe the prison should be constructed within contours that make it more suitable.  It is strongly perceived that the current proposal, as we understand it, is a site within 162 acres.  If the land acquisition is not completed, residents believe that the case could be made for the prison to be moved, even if that is beyond the current 162-acre footprint. From an environmental point of view, there are concerns that three streams within the footprint of the proposal will be compromised.  The area in question is served by the Killally, Ballinrush and Graigue group water scheme.  The source of this scheme is approximate to the footprint of the site. The Minister, in response to a question I tabled on Thursday last, stated that normal planning provisions do not apply to a prison development.  There is an understanding that for security reasons one does not broadcast or make known the exact plans.  We all acknowledge that fact, but further concerns have been raised about the transport provisions to and from the prison.  People in the nearby village of Kilworth, where at times traffic causes a bottleneck, are seeking, through their community council, assurances on the traffic management provisions of the proposals.  They also seek a buffer zone around the prison from an aesthetic and security point of view. Those who live in Cork city are used to the presence of a prison within their city.  The construction of a prison of this nature in a very rural area would give rise to genuine causes for concern and anxiety. If the proposal is being presented as a fait accompli and is not subject to normal planning considerations, I respectfully ask the Minister to ensure any provisions relating to public safety and environmental concerns are addressed.  To assist the community further, I respectfully request of the Minister and his officials that he would meet a deputation of residents and public representatives in the area so they can have their concerns addressed at an early stage.

That people's confidence in the system has been shaken to its foundations is putting it mildly.  That thousands of women who are at risk of breast cancer face a cloud of uncertainty is a sad indictment of the Government.  That a committee of this House was informed by the HSE that 97 women would have to be recalled for tests before the women themselves were informed speaks volumes.  That these women had not been contacted personally within 24 hours is nothing short of a scandal. When Dr. Peter Naughton told the Minister in 2005 that breast cancer services at Portlaoise were a shambles, did she listen to his concerns?  Yes, she did.  Did she act in a manner that was reflective of her position as Minister for Health and Children?  The answer is ""No""."
15681	SeanSherlock	Labour	12775.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	781	" If the answer was ""Yes"", the Minister would not only have referred the matter to the HSE, she would have followed this issue to its proper conclusion and taken total responsibility.  That conclusion should have been the restoration of confidencein a system upon which thousands of women rely. What is the culture that now pervades the politics of health?  It is one where responsibility is passed from the Executive to the bureaucracy and where political accountability is non-existent.  The Minister was wrong to adopt a hands-off approach.  That is plainly and simply wrong.  A Minister for Health and Children cannot adopt a hands-off approach.  Otherwise, Angola will surely follow. If this motion achieves nothing else, it will have put down a clear marker to the Government that the issue of political accountability must be placed at centre stage in terms of health care facilities and delivery.  That the Minister for Health and Children has been forced to give an account of her actions is a victory for political accountability and for those women who tonight live in fear for their futures and those of their families.  No longer will the people of this country endure a system that leaves no person or organisation accountable for the lack of delivery of cancer care and other services. Our role as public representatives of the people must be respected.  If we seek answers, we must get answers, not carefully worded attempts to dodge the issue.  The Minister should not take us for fools.  Nor should she take the women we represent for fools.  If we deem it necessary to seek answers on behalf of the countless victims of the current health care regime, the Minister must respect that and must respond in kind.  We can no longer accept a lack of political accountability.  The question tonight is whether the Minister acted with due diligence.  She did not."

15685	SeanSherlock	Labour	12782.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-05 00:00:00	Prelude	107	 I wish to share time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.
15686	SeanSherlock	Labour	12782.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-05 00:00:00	Prelude	109	" In recent times, November has been one of the best months of the year for the Minister for Finance.  Today, of all days, will tell a different story.  The serious decline in the housing construction market clearly confirms the continuing fall in Exchequer receipts from taxes such as stamp duty.  Exchequer figures for November show that total tax receipts are almost €2 billion behind the target set out in last year's budget.  The Department of Finance signalled last Friday that taxes collected this year would be approximately €1.7 billion below target. What will today's budget bring and what will be the Minister for Finance's priorities for the economy for the year ahead?  With inflation running at 4.8% — among the highest rates in Europe — the scope for an expansive budget is limited.  The budget is very relevant to the Fine Gael motion.  There is not a great deal in that motion with which I disagree.  The issues of competitiveness and rising labour costs are key drivers for any economic outlook.  The budget will determine whether the calls within the motion will bear fruit. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, outlined a number of fundamental points relating to the lack of investment in infrastructure and issues of public sector pay.  It is true that infrastructural spending in this country is well below par.  There may have been serious spending on inter-urban routes such as that between Cork and Dublin, but there are still regional disparities which have not been sorted out.  How long does it take a train to get from Dublin to Sligo?  If a burst water pipe can turn Dublin's principal motorway into a car park for eight hours, then what can we seriously expect from a Government that is lunging from one crisis to another?  There are secondary and non-national roads throughout this island that are rarely travelled by Ministers, and that eminent backbencher from south Kerry himself admitted that if there was a pothole to be filled in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle, he would look after it.  Should we be living on an island as prosperous as this with even one pothole to our name in this day and age?  The fact they exist at all is a testament to the lack of investment in non-national roads throughout the country. In regard to broadband, there are parts of north Cork where people are still dialling-up to access the Internet.  Dialling up in 2007 is a joke.  Data published by the European Commission shows that in 2007, 74% of households in the Netherlands have broadband access compared with 31% in Ireland.  Who is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its goal of becoming what the Government calls a ""world-class knowledge economy"" in just over five years?  How can we compete on a global scale if the roll-out of broadband is at such a paltry level? The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to take necessary actions on public sector pay.  It is difficult to comprehend just exactly what this means.  The vast bulk of both public sector and private sector workers are operating at wage levels that keep them and their families' heads just above the water-line.  A total of 1.5 million people have salaries worth less than €38,000.  To survive on a wage of €38,000 in today's terms is a difficult task.  Real people operate and survive within this bracket, but they are under pressure in this society.  Their mortgages have increased and they have borrowed to meet the demands of day to day living.  They are overworked, overcharged for child care and overstretched.  Their average basket of food items is increasing at a rate of 4% to 5% per annum.  People on this income bracket can ill afford to absorb such increases, yet they are the back-bone of this economy. Today the Minister will present the usual budget of tax and social welfare changes.  He must look at this income bracket and provide some measure of relief to increase real income to offset the increasing cost of living.  Fianna Fáil made generous election promises on health, education and justice with more teachers, more gardaí and more consultants promised.  Today will tell whether the Minister intends to fulfil those promises. There is a nervousness about Ireland's economic prospects, and much talk of a tight budget.  This motion largely addresses those concerns.  There is a school of thought that says we should not play politics with the economy.  I do not wish to score points, but I do want to remind this Government that its handling of the economy has a bearing on people's jobs and their mortgages and how they provide for their families.  In supporting the spirit of this motion, but not the full tenet of it, we believe it is the role of an Opposition to contribute constructively on how to maintain economic prosperity and further economic development. There are serious issues about our competitiveness and we have to face up to that.  However, there is also a lot that is positive about the economy.  In that respect, as a nation we need to focus on opportunities.  The economic review and outlook, produced by the Department of Finance last month, predicted that the economy will grow by about 3% next year.  It is not what we would want but it is growth and we should acknowledge that.  We still need to focus on the possibilities.  Growth in the economy is no longer driven by the export of goods.  However, growth of services exports is very healthy.  We need to continue the focus on sectors such as sales, research and development and high-value traded services.  We need to ensure, not just that we invest in research in our universities, but that the knowledge being generated is turned into commercial activities and that young indigenous companies survive. The agricultural sector is a mainstay of our economy.  Food and drinks exports account for over €8 billion.  We must also look to our rural economy and ensure that investment continues in the agri-food sector.  We ignore the potential of the rural economy at our peril.  At the same time, we must continue to ensure we can attract foreign investment."

If the price of cigarettes was prohibitive, it would probably have that effect.  However, if one is a committed smoker, it will not change one's behaviour at all.  If it is proposed as a health measure, the Government must look at the issue of smoking cessation.  If some of these moneys could be diverted to smoking cessation measures, then perhaps it would be seen as a more productive move. I also urge the Government to look at nicotine replacement substances, such as gums and patches, which are very prohibitively priced.  Their sale is also restricted in that they are only available in pharmacies, although they are widely available in supermarkets and multiples in other mainland European countries.  If one is to discourage people from smoking, one needs to look at the distribution of those products as well.

15709	SeanSherlock	Labour	12796.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	269	" I noted with interest the contribution of the Minister for State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to this debate last night.  Not once did he mention the word ""pharmacist"" or even acknowledge the problem that exists for the IPU.  He stated: ""the Bill before us today is, in effect, championing price fixing, which is a serious crime carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years"".  This gives rise to the question of whether the Minister of State has decided by implication that the general medical scheme as it stands is administered by pharmacists in a manner that is not in keeping with the law.  He must clarify his opinion. The current impasse between the IPU and the HSE is characterised by the latter seeking to enforce its will on the former without even the courtesy or corporate social responsibility of allowing negotiations.  The very nature of this unilateral decision to slash the payments made by the HSE to pharmacists for the purchase of medicines will undermine the viability of pharmacies everywhere. I do not speak for the large multiples which will soak up the reductions in margins without pain but for community based and family run pharmacies which have a wealth of knowledge of their clients and are acutely aware of the intergenerational health issues that run within families.  The vast majority of these pharmacies are located in rural and marginal areas.  In my constituency of Cork East, towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Youghal, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Midleton are characterised by the presence of independently owned pharmacists who rely heavily on the general medical scheme.  I speak for those who may have taken over a pharmacy from a parent and are carrying on a proud tradition.  They deserve the opportunity to at least negotiate their position. This move by the HSE is dolled up as reform but we can see it for the bullying tactic it is."

That is why we are seeking to ensure that by amending the Competition Act, organisations such as the IPU will at least have the right to negotiate a position that will not leave them stranded on this or any other issue. If the concepts of engagement and social partnership are to mean anything, the Government will at least afford them that right.  This unilateral action by the Health Service Executive, HSE, runs contrary to long-held beliefs that the primacy of negotiation with any representative body is paramount.  The Labour Party seeks to defend that right.

I wish to speak about the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious delay in granting permission to St. Mary's community school, Buttevant, County Cork, to build a new school to provide for an increase in the student population. This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years.  It was last raised by my predecessor and late father in April 2007.  As yet, no progress has been made in this regard.  The staff and pupils, as well as the people of Buttevant, have been waiting for ten years for this project to be expedited and I now call on the Minister to tell the people of Buttevant when she intends to notify County Cork Vocational Education Committee of her approval of the new school. When I was a member of Cork County Council, it took a proactive decision to rezone lands for the purpose of designating an educational site to provide for this school.  At present, the school principal and those who are involved in the school only seek the appointment of a design team to enable them at least to move to a stage from which progress can be made on this issue. The school itself is characterised by buildings which in some instances date back to pre-Famine times.  As the enrolment has increased from 182 last year to 194 this year, is set to rise by at least a further ten next year and is increasing on a yearly basis, the people of Buttevant and the school authorities wonder when the Department will expedite this matter. The layouts of the buildings are of a very poor standard and design because the building is not a purpose-built school.  The staffroom is very cramped and there are no sporting facilities.  The school is obliged to use the local GAA facilities for physical education and other sporting uses.  As the site has been purchased on foot of the rezoning, that step of the process has been undertaken.  I call for some progress on this matter and for the Minister for Education and Science at least to deliver on a promise and commitment to the people of Buttevant because the population of Buttevant and the school's catchment area is increasing yearly.  It is anticipated that Buttevant's location on a main national primary route will make it a far more attractive place to live in future and the needs of the local secondary school on a new greenfield site must be met in that context. This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years and the people of Buttevant and of north Cork wish to see some progress in this regard.  I ask the Minister to take this on board and expedite the matter and bring it to design stage in 2008.  I will conclude by wishing the Acting Chairman, the staff and Members all the best for the season and for 2008.

15725	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 There are measures in the Finance Bill that are laudable, such as the welcome measures to encourage companies to invest in environmentally-friendly equipment.  The measures under the save as you earn scheme are also a step in the right direction.  The health measures, such as the VAT reduction on non-oral contraceptives, including condoms, do not go far enough.  It is our contention that the Minister should have further reduced the rate to 5%, in line with the EU VAT directive. I will specifically refer to the research and development tax credit.  The Minister should fix indefinitely 2003 as the base year for availing of the tax credit.  The Bill, as I understand it, extends the base year of 2003 for the purposes of the research and development tax credit for a further four years to 31 December 2013.  However, the Bill provides that the subsequent years' expenditure, for calculating the incremental spend, will be the ten years before the end of the relevant accounting period.  For example, 2014 will have a base year of 2004.  One can compare this to the UK position, which is based not on an incremental position but on all research and development spend.  This gives the UK a comparative advantage so we should consider adopting this approach. If there is a new Minister of State responsible for innovation policy, I assume the Government is giving the notion of intellectual policy and innovation some degree of stature.  A gesture such as this would assist many companies and enterprises throughout the country which are increasingly endeavouring to heighten research and development spend. Considering the matter vis-à-vis foreign direct investment and its current unstable nature, we will have to rely on many indigenous industries.  Much work is being done within universities and third level institutions, and many spin-off companies are established from that and through venture capital.  Research and development will increasingly be a component of this process so we should incentivise it where possible.  Fixing 2003 as the base year rather than just limiting the credit to 2013 would have provided increased certainty and would have been a more favourable measure. I will comment on my constituency of Cork East and the relevance of this Bill to such a constituency, where unemployment figures are rising.  It has been proven that in towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cobh and Midleton, the figures are going up year on year.  The current Amgen issue——
15726	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	257	 I have an answer to a parliamentary question which clearly proves the unemployment figures are rising.  I can make them available to the Minister of State if he so wishes.
15727	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	260	 We are currently losing jobs in Cork East.
15728	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	262	 We have lost traditional industries and, for example, the food industry is not what it once was and is going into decline.  Irish Sugar is no longer with us and Dairygold is downsizing its operation.  There is increasing uncertainty about Amgen.  In trying to be positive about how we proceed economically and taking north and east Cork as a region, if a similar situation becomes evident, we will have to rely on indigenous industries.  The Government must proactively seek to upskill those people working within existing industries and introduce some measures for employers to enable them to upskill and grow existing companies.  There are many family-based companies in these towns and I am sure they could do with some incentivisation to grow.  The Government should consider the issue given the current global economic climate.  I am not advocating looking inward but we can start thinking more locally about how to provide incentives to grow jobs. These are the essential points I have sought to cover.  I would have liked the Finance Bill to provide for some composite scheme like the town renewal or urban renewal schemes.  Towns such as Mitchelstown, Mallow and, to a lesser extent, Fermoy are still characterised by certain areas where development has not kept pace with corresponding development on the outskirts of towns.  The Government could be in a position to consider some urban renewal scheme or an adjunct to the existing programme.  I realise a Goodbody report on the performance of the urban renewal schemes was published which indicated a slow take-up in some aspects of the schemes.  The climate is right for towns such as Mallow, Fermoy and Mitchelstown to benefit from those schemes so we could get rid of some of the dereliction still existing within the towns. I have probably used much less than 11 minutes but I do not believe in filling time for the sake of it.  I have covered the points I wished to make and others which I could expand have been expounded upon by our finance spokesperson.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board.  I will be very happy to make the figures available to the Minister of State which prove beyond any doubt that unemployment figures have increased exponentially in these towns.

How can I speak for Paul Quinn in a way that does not patronise his family or politicise his memory?  How can I, who did not know him personally, possibly speak in a manner that will pay adequate tribute to his independence and single-mindedness that ultimately cost him his life? I can only speak to the fact that neither he or his family nor the community of Cullyhanna has received justice.  If we are to subscribe to the ideals of the republic and all the beliefs going with it, we must speak up for Paul Quinn.  We must condemn, without equivocation, his murder, and that condemnation must come from all facets of the political spectrum. If there are those who seek to equivocate, they must reverse their position.  If this island, which has left so many families bereft of justice, is to move on we must hold Paul Quinn up as an example that justice can prevail.  In order for this to happen, those in the shadows must be rooted out and take responsibility for their actions.
15734	SeanSherlock	Labour	12846.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	118	" Decisions on any necessary actions to be taken by the Department and/or the Commission for Energy Regulation as a consequence of any changes to the UK gas regulatory regime will be taken in the context of the publication by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), of revised proposals to the current regime.  The publication of such proposals is awaited.  OFGEM is the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets, which supports the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA), the regulator of the gas and electricity industries in Great Britain. On 10 July 2007, the U.K.'s Competition Commission (CC) quashed a decision by the GEMA to reform the gas offtake regime for Great Britain's high-pressure National Transmission System.  The principal initiative behind OFGEM's proposals was the creation of a ""user commitment"" model, requiring all shippers who offtake at a UK gas transmission network exit point to secure sufficient capacity to meet their needs 3-7 years in advance.  This would have resulted in a number of changes to the Irish market with regard to the booking of gas capacity from the Moffat exit point of the interconnector between Scotland and Ireland.  The decision is currently being reconsidered by OFGEM, having regard to the Competition Commission's views, and I am advised that revised exit reform proposals are likely to be published in the near future. In the meantime, while awaiting OFGEM's final decision, the CER, supported by my Department, has taken a proactive approach to this matter, and both are in regular contact with Bord Gáis Éireann and with our UK counterparts in relation to it."

The timeframe for dealing with applications for the allowance is too lengthy and causes undue hardship for those applying in respect of minors.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. In the HSE south area expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance which forms part of the rent supplement scheme amounted to €43.56 million in 2005, €46.30 million in 2006 and €49.21 million in 2007.  Annual increases in expenditure in this area would be unwarranted if the Government was doing its job and delivering an adequate social housing programme.  Every year the number on the social housing waiting list who contact me grows exponentially.  Rent supplement is directly linked to the increase in the number on the social housing waiting list and continues to cost the State exorbitant amounts every year.  The moneys expended under the scheme are pocketed by landlords.  If an adequate programme for dealing with social housing was in place, the expenditure allocated to rent supplement could be redirected to more needy sections of society. The rental accommodation scheme is one way of supplanting the rent supplement scheme.  My party advocates a ""begin to buy"" approach which would allow more people to move from social housing onto the housing ladder.  We need more joined-up thinking on this issue.  While the supplementary welfare scheme may be a necessary mechanism in the short term, we must examine the reasons expenditure on it is increasing every year.  More and more people are being forced onto social housing waiting lists.  I ask the Minister to address this issue."

The 100 general practitioners who wrote to the Minister in September stated they are in despair and that ""a blinkered vision of health delivery is slavishly following foreign models without taking into account the existing nature and makeup of the Irish Health Service"".  They contend, as do I, that all patient contact should be in centres of excellence, be it in primary, secondary or tertiary care.  MGH is a primary example of a secondary facility that has punched above its weight, in spite of concerted efforts to downgrade it. The Government, by reducing the hospital's budget by more than €500,000, did not take into account the fact that the information being supplied to warrant a cut is at best misleading and does not take into account certain factors.  The hospital networks section of the HSE south, when asked to provide specifics in reply to questions I have posed to the Minister, responded with generalities which leave us none the wiser.  I have tabled numerous questions to the Minister on the future of the hospital, the appointment of an executive management structure, the appointment of a radiologist, casemix, and the appointment of a radiographer to oversee the CT scanner that has been sitting in an empty room for years. On the issue of casemix, I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 400 on 30 January 2008, where the HSE in response to my question on the €500,000 cut to the hospitals budget stated: Mallow General Hospital has received a negative casemix adjustment of €571,233 for 2008 (which is based on 2006 activity).  Management at the hospital are examining the underlying causes of the negative casemix adjustment for 2008 and a rigorous scrutiny of the hospital's base costs will be carried out. MGH's budget had been cut because the workload of the hospital had been under measured through casemix because of a lack of clerical staff, but it does not suit the HSE to admit this.  I have it on good authority that only 95% of MGH's workload was captured.  The HSE's official line is that the budget was cut because of ""inefficiencies"".  Nobody disputes that MGH's budget is the lowest in the country or that its workload is greater than many comparable  hospitals.  How is it then that its budget is cut? I refer to the appointment of an executive management board.  Why has Bantry hospital, with a smaller catchment area than Mallow, an EMB?  I applaud Bantry hospital in this regard but it is lucky.  The answers I received are an insult to the people I represent.  I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 119 of 31 January 2008, in which I asked about the make up and reintroduction of the executive management structure.  In its reply, the HSE stated that management of both the Cork University Hospital group and Mallow General Hospital are keen to enhance the management structures at the hospital and have over the past several months been working with the HSE's performance and development unit to facilitate the process of establishing an executive management board at Mallow hospital.  It continued that key stakeholders have been met on a one-to-one basis to explore concerns, expectations, visions for the future and development needs, that discussions are ongoing and that a proposal to re-establish the executive management board at the hospital is currently being finalised. According to the HSE, the review has taken slightly longer than anticipated because its scope was broadened to incorporate community-based services and to allow wider consultation with key stakeholders, including medical staff from the Mallow catchment area.  Again, the HSE speaks in generalities but is short on specifics.  It fails to acknowledge that an executive management board was in place Mallow General Hospital which ceased to operate and was never replaced.  As for its assertion that there was a consultation with key stakeholders, this is stretching the truth.  I can name 95 GPs who are key stakeholders in the area but were never consulted.  I know of nobody in community-based services who was consulted.  Which key stakeholders and medical staff from the Mallow catchment area were consulted?  What does the HSE regard as the Mallow catchment area? In the same reply, the HSE states that the acute hospital services review in HSE south will determine overall governance arrangements.  To whom has the proposal for an executive management board for Mallow General Hospital been sent?  On the issue of the CT scanner, which is also addressed in the reply, if the HSE see the benefits of the scanner, why did it not put a proper management plan in place in 2005? We are concerned for the future of the hospital and that the acute hospitals review will seek to downgrade our accident and emergency services, postpone further appointments when current surgical terms of employment end and further delay the building of a day procedures unit.  We want to see the appointment of a radiographer because we have waited too long for one.  We want Mallow General Hospital to be a centre of excellence for secondary care.  We are proud of our Hospital.  If the HSE persists in downgrading the hospital by stealth, we will protest vigorously."

15751	SeanSherlock	Labour	12866.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	539	 In the five minutes allocated to me I will do my best to cover the issues I feel are pertinent.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and to support it unequivocally.  I wish to address a number of general points relating to the national broadband scheme, the lack of roll-out of broadband to rural areas and the need for the Government to adopt a universal service obligation similar to that which exists for postal and telephony services. With regard to a universal service obligation, on 7 February last I received a letter from the Commission for Communications Regulation following representations by me on the issue of inadequate or no broadband provision in villages such as Ballyhooly and Glanworth.  I speak of these villages because they are typical of many rural areas throughout the country.  I was told in this letter that ComReg imposed certain obligations on Eircom but these obligations stretch only to the rights of a citizen to a functional telephone line, capable of carrying voice and data over 28.8 kbits. While this obligation might have satisfied the Ireland of 20 or even ten years ago, it no longer goes far enough in terms of providing adequate telecommunications to the Ireland of today.  Universal service obligation broadband must be enshrined in legislation as an entitlement. The politicians of my parent's generation made representations on matters relating to the provision of telephones when no one could get access to a telephone line.  Politicians of my generation make representations on the issue of broadband, when parts of this country are bereft of what is now considered an essential service.  That people of my generation are being told that next generation networks are being rolled out when people living beyond the Pale are still using dial-up and can only rely on that narrow bandwidth is a joke when the average modem for a computer is 56 kbits.
15752	SeanSherlock	Labour	12866.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	541	 A regional disparity exists and it has a negative effect both socially and economically for those living in rural areas which are not covered.  The admission by ComReg that a universal service obligation applies under EU regulations only for the provision of telephones and not in respect of broadband belies a serious flaw in the system.  Every citizen should have an entitlement to broadband in the same way they have entitlement to an operational phone line.  Consequently, I propose a review similar to that carried out by the European Commission in 2005 which would result in a legislative change and give a voice to the thousands of people living in rural Ireland denied access to what is an essential service by today's standards. The broadband availability map found on the Department's website simply does not reflect the situation on the ground.  I would go so far as to state the map is largely a work of fiction and so would many of my constituents.  There is a glaring disparity between those who will eventually be able to avail of the next-generation networks and others, many of whom I represent in a mixed urban and rural constituency, who must still dial up for Internet access.  There is an inequality at play here.  The criteria laid down in the national broadband scheme must ensure there is 100% broadband coverage.  The Minister must ensure those white areas depicting no coverage on the departmental map will have broadband access by June 2008.  Broadband access is a right in today's Ireland.

15769	SeanSherlock	Labour	12880.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	901	 I thank Deputy Lynch for her excellent time keeping.  I hope what I have to say will be equally and not more important than what she said in her contribution. The Government stated last night, in the course of this debate, that in 2008 the Department of Education and Science will pay €167 million to primary schools to cover day-to-day running costs and that a €21 increase to €330 per pupil means primary schools receive unprecedented levels of funding per pupil to meet running costs.  This belies a fundamental lack of understanding of the true nature of educational provision as our citizens understand it, as the parents understand it, and as the principals and teachers understand it. When a parent sends a child to school, an unwritten social contract that is enshrined within the Irish psyche is entered into that the child will receive the best education possible.  That social contract was not on the basis that the parent must also fundraise, take part in raffles, sing karaoke, hillwalk, play bingo and join in pub quizzes so that the child can have the benefit of water, electricity and a myriad other services within their school. In real economic terms the costs of maintenance of schools has increased considerably in recent years and the burden now faced by schools to meet these additional costs ultimately places a further financial strain on parents of children who find themselves fundraising for schools on a constant basis. Educational provision should not have to be subjected to this form of pressure.  It is enough for any school in these times to have to educate and educate alone.  That in itself remains the fundamental challenge and, arguably, it should be the only challenge.  I acknowledge that the Government has increased the capitation grant since 1997.  However, by doubling the capitation grant now, it does not have to come at the expense of providing extra teachers, a theory which has been posited elsewhere in this debate, and somewhat disingenuously. The logic of our position is to ensure that the headache of maintenance and running costs is taken away from all schools so that they can concentrate on providing education and continue, in certain instances, to do battle with the Minister on the capital programme for the provision of adequate school buildings in places such as Castlelyons, Rahan, Grange and Midleton where no proper buildings have been provided for considerable periods.  Not only have schools to raise funds, they also are operating in substandard buildings.  This is the reason the Labour Party is raising this issue.  If the capitation grant is increased, it will at least take some of those pressures away.

When will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be published?  A publication date of 2009 is given.  This acute hospitals review will have serious permutations in terms of the delivery of hospital services in places such as Mallow General Hospital.  The Ceann Comhairle should know that we are awaiting this review because of its serious permutations for Mallow.

15787	SeanSherlock	Labour	12907.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	51	 I welcome the reply from the Minister of State and my response will be very brief.  Does the FEPS encourage the growth of native woodland?  Will the Minister of State potentially consider an additional premium for those farmers, landowners or forestry owners who wish to grow more forestry on the basis that it would reduce CO2 emissions for this country?  Perhaps an additional premium could be given to those farmers who are not already growing forestry but who may potentially embark on growing it.
15788	SeanSherlock	Labour	12907.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 I accept the Minister of State's answer but there is potential to give a further premium purely on the basis there is room to have carbon off-setting, for want of a better expression.  There is major scope for the private sector to become involved in forestry.  As I understand it, to date there is less than 20% involvement of the private sector in forestry and it is an area of agribusiness that has even more potential. I am not convinced the €7,604 per hectare payment, the maximum, is adequate given that one would have to operate on large economies of scale in order to get some sort of a decent return.  Many smaller forestry owners do not currently have the economies of scale to be able to thin back forests to allow for greater potential.  The cost of thinning and maintenance would eat into the premium. We are trying to make a case, in essence, for more grant aid or financial incentives to be provided.  Will the Minister of State consider that?
15789	SeanSherlock	Labour	12907.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 Perhaps we should consult the churches on this matter.

We do not know the exact content of fertilisers imported from third countries because there is no policing of urea and other contents.

15806	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	301	 In response to the Ministers present, it is fair to say that we all have this country's interests at heart.  In terms of the debates that have been facilitated by this House, it is right, proper and pertinent that Opposition Members would hold the Government to account on its position vis-à-vis the WTO negotiations and that the Government would not take any pertinent questions from this side of the House as a slight, given that we all have as our best interests the future interests of Irish agriculture and Irish agribusiness. By way of response to the speech of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, I wish to clear up the notion that she seemed to convey on the issue of the single farm payments.  It is our clear understanding that to convey the impression somehow that the single farm payments will be undermined and that she is endeavouring to save them under the WTO agreements under the green box issues, is something of a misnomer.  My understanding is that they are not part of the WTO negotiations in any event and to say they are conveys the wrong impression.
15807	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	303	" The fundamental question that we must ask ourselves today is what the Doha Round will mean for Irish agriculture and for farm families who form the bedrock of our rural society.  The WTO is informed by a modus operandi that seeks, with the World Bank and the IMF, a global market devoid of trade barriers.  Since 2001, at Doha, the WTO has embarked on a strategy of liberalisation of global trade resulting in a view, by countries such as our own and, I might add, poorer countries, that the indiscriminate liberalisation agenda will be detrimental to our interests and the interests of poorer countries seeking to raise their economic output. For the purposes of analysing the Government's amendment to this motion, there is absolutely nothing in its response that would give solace to the thousands of farmers who today had to leave their homesteads in the quest to have their voices heard. Our critique of the current Doha Round is simple.  The WTO is not on the correct path to deliver worldwide economic prosperity.  It will not raise the economic tide of all comers and, from this island's point of view, will have a disastrous effect on the rural economy and agricultural sector.  Moreover, it will decimate the Common Agricultural Policy, to which we all subscribe and which has been negotiated by a process of pooled sovereignty of EU member states through many years of diplomacy. All of us recognise the primacy of agricultural negotiations and this sector has become an easy target for the EU Commission in its quest to gain concessions on a neoliberal trade agenda because of the subsidisation of agriculture.  Our view is simple.  To use developing countries as a bargaining chip to unravel CAP is a disingenuous argument and one to which we do not subscribe.  It is our analysis that concessions will be fought for on agricultural issues as a substitute for agreement on the liberalisation of services.  Developing countries rightly argue that it is unfair to expect them to open their markets on services while clear barriers to entry exist amongst developed countries on the provision of services.  The key worry for services liberalisation is what it means for the ability to regulate foreign service-based companies operating in less developed regions. Furthermore, the availability of micro-credit in Africa has had the positive effect of lifting tens of millions of small farmers out of poverty.  An agrarian revolution is taking place in Africa about which one will not hear on radio or TV.  Our concern is that the growth of urban populations in Africa, which are fed through the rural African economy, may be compromised in the quest to achieve a rate of liberalisation, which may be detrimental to their economic interests.  Therein lies the comparison with the Irish farmer.  While the Irish farmer relies on the subsidisation of agriculture, the African farmer relies on a new system of micro-credit which may allow him to survive, and even in time, flourish. In that context, Ireland and developing countries are united in their opposition to the Doha round, albeit for differing reasons.  To state that our interests are somehow detrimental to those of developing countries is a naked lie which must be firmly nailed.  To say that we are being protectionist and self-interested is true.  We should not be afraid to state that we as a nation must ensure the primacy of agriculture as an integral part of our society and any attempt to diminish hard-fought gains on CAP must be resisted at ministerial level. A fairer global trading system is something we all want.  Any agreement should also encompass bilateral deals in which the EU is engaged, particularly with the poorest and most vulnerable economies through economic partnership agreements.  As we in Ireland look at the potential cost of cuts in tariffs, the poorest countries are being asked to eliminate more than 80% of their tariffs by the EU.  There is no equity in that proposal which signals a bad deal for both developing countries and developed countries such as Ireland. Global food security is an issue that not only effects those who are more prone to adverse weather conditions but also this island.  If it advances, this deal will compromise the food security of this nation.  The African farmer may also be left with a stark choice if this process is to succeed as envisaged by the EU Commission.  The African farmer may find himself at the end of a trade liberalisation agenda that forces him to buy his seed from a conglomerate such as Monsanto, thereby risking his livelihood, chaining him to another form of bonded labour and potentially compromising his biodiversity. Doha and the WTO failed to consider the cultural and societal permutations of ramming this deal down our throats.  If it succeeds, we can wave goodbye to a traditional way of living.  Those farmers who are able to acquire more land and develop economies of scale will flourish and the traditional farm family will no longer exist.  I may be accused of expounding rhetoric but the implication of this deal will be a flight from the land.  This will be due to the influx of cheaper imports devoid of any controls, standards or traceability. The Doha round is predicated on a globalisation agenda.  It relies on unrestricted global market forces.  In this scenario, transnational corporations will commandeer advantageous terms of trade.  Small local interests will no longer be able to secure, control or protect market share.  Co-operatives will be swallowed up by larger food multiples and the ""Tescofication"" of agriculture will become the norm.  When these larger food multiples control the means of production, they will control the price the consumer pays and the price the producer derives.  We have already arrived at this scenario, albeit on a smaller scale. The structure of an unaccountable WTO rule-making militates against the small producer, be he or she European or African.  The structures give an advantage to large corporations and foreign direct investors at the cost of weakening the traditional equity-orientated economic programmes such as CAP, from which we as an island have benefited."

15811	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	311	 I thank the Acting Chairman. In reality, these shoddy proposals will bring major changes in the market structures of developing countries in terms of ownership.  It is our view that trade liberalisation will transform subsistence farming into arid export monocultures, stifle the power of micro-credit and put poor countries at the mercy of western countries such as the US.  Furthermore, the price sensitivity of markets will be more keenly felt. In essence, the WTO proposals as they currently stand are overly ambitious in terms of trade liberalisation and rule implementation.  Developing countries, as well as this country, rightly fear that they have nothing to gain from this deal.  We feel that we have made enough concessions and have gained nothing in return.  If this is the case, it is then clear that the process has failed both ourselves and lesser developed countries and is, therefore, unworkable in its current terms.  Contiguous to the analysis arrived at in recent weeks is the notion that perhaps no deal is better than a bad deal.  This is something that needs to be teased out in greater detail. The EU Commission agenda is detrimental to both Irish agriculture and agriculture in developing countries.  The Irish farming position is one which has genuine fears about cuts to beef and dairy tariffs.  The question is whether enough support is evident at Council of Ministers level for such a cut.  If this is the case, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has questions to answer about whether she feels this is a tenable position and if not, what her counter argument is and if there is a sufficient blocking minority to force a rethink on this deal. There are no grounds for believing that Pascal Lamy can push through a deal ahead of the meeting of Agriculture Ministers on 19 May.  As I understand it, the Doha agenda is unpopular and there are question marks over whether the end of the Bush regime in the US will signal any mood for a deal in advance of a new president being appointed. It is our view that, while guaranteeing food security for EU citizens is a priority and this can best be achieved through a combination of supporting EU food production and through imports set in the framework of the WTO rules, this food security also depends on the EU's contribution to the building up of world stocks, which are today dramatically low.  This allows the EU not only to protect itself against shortages but also to take responsibility with regards to global food security. We must take cognisance of the need to protect the farmers of Europe, including Irish farmers, against a liberalisation agenda that will ultimately compromise Irish comparative advantage in both the beef and dairy sector and will add nothing of value to developing countries' terms of trade.  Our view is one which unashamedly seeks to protect the national interest.  In seeking to do so, we are protecting our economy, particularly the rural economy, and a way of life that is under threat.  Commissioner Mandelson has an agenda which is incongruous with the founding principles of the European Union on issues of subsidiarity and its position as a Community-based trading bloc.  We are now left with an appalling scenario whereby the Mandelson agenda is totally at variance with that of certain members of the Council of Ministers, including our Minister.  The Commission must take its mandate from the Council of Ministers.  It must not exceed its mandate.  It is a supra-national organisation and it must derive its negotiating stance from the Minister and her colleagues.  The Minister has a hard task, therefore, in building the alliance of interests that is necessary to protect our interests. We cannot and must not trade away the rural economy at a time when other sectors of the economy have been undermined.  The agribusiness sector is the one that has remained constant through thick and thin throughout the history of the State.  It is the sector that will always be there.  If we are to trade away the concessions that have been hard won through tough negotiations and diplomacy, all those concessions will have been in vain.

15819	SeanSherlock	Labour	12921.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	 I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children, who has primacy for this issue, has left the Chamber.  I would have liked if she stayed for the five minutes allocated to me on this issue.  There was a proposal made at the end of March that the number of consultants operating at Mallow General Hospital be reduced from three to two.  This was on the termination of a contract of employment.  The result of the termination would have been to reduce accident and emergency cover within the hospital from seven days to five, resulting in Monday to Friday cover from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  This decision was already taken, a fait accompli and, but for the actions of people such as the Mallow Hospital Action Committee, of which I am secretary, Friends of Mallow Hospital and general practitioners who came out fighting and held a press conference, deciding that an expression of “no confidence” would be placed in the management of Mallow General Hospital, the management would have proceeded with the decision without a “by your leave”. Because of the action, the furore, and the amount of public protest as a result of the decision, the HSE has stated that it is in a position to fill the post with a locum consultant until the end of May.  We have no commitment in writing that the HSE is intent on the continuation of a third surgical position at Mallow.  We fear the intention of the HSE and the Minister to downgrade our hospital and reduce by stealth the number of surgical posts in the hospital, thereby reducing the accident and emergency services and funnelling everything to CUH which, if one believes the HSE, is the new Jerusalem in the south and will solve all our ills.  We believe the process will have a detrimental effect on the lives of the 100,000 people in the catchment area of Mallow General Hospital, having an adverse effect on medical outcomes.  CUH is ill-equipped to deal with the extra work load this development will entail. I call on the Minister of State to give guarantees in writing that Mallow, as a secondary care facility, will continue as the centre of excellence that it is, that the 100 GPs referring patients to the hospital will have the accident and emergency cover they need and that there will be three surgeons or more to provide the service to more than 100,000 people who require it.  We also want to ensure that the hospital — an excellent facility — goes from strength to strength and will not be downgraded any further. We demand a clear commitment in writing from the HSE, that it will ensure the continuation of a third surgical position so that we can deliver services to our people on the ground.  We have no confidence in the current management system because we have listened to promises on the roll-out of a CT scanner, which has been idle for more than three years.  We have no radiologist in the hospital, which was promised.  We have no executive management board, which was promised and for which the HSE stated it would embark on a consultation process.  The dogs on the street know that a 15 minute consultation with one or two GPs does not constitute a consultation in our book.  We call for the instigation of an executive management board so that we can call into question any decisions on the future of the hospital and examine and provide an audit report of any accounting procedures relating to the hospital. We want to see a centre of excellence at Mallow.  It has a positive effect on the outcomes of patients in the region and we will oppose vehemently any attempt by the HSE to downgrade services.  We want to see firm commitments from the Minister of State and to see the third post instigated in perpetuity so that the people of the region can have a proper standard of care, and excellent care at that.

15825	SeanSherlock	Labour	12922.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	229	" I wish to share time with Deputy Broughan. Most of the arguments in this debate have been well thrashed out and I will not repeat points that have already been made and that I support.  I am in favour of the Lisbon treaty and will vote for it.  I worked in the European Parliament for three years and, though it is an august institution, the first 12 months of my time there were spent seeking to interpret the Byzantine language that emanates from it.  This is an issue for ordinary citizens of the European Union who find it hard to interpret national legislation at the best of times, never mind European treaties and some of the language used therein.  This has negative consequences for the relationships citizens have with the European Union and terms like ""co-decision"" and ""subsidiarity"" may be examples of language used in a manner that is sometimes deliberately designed to obfuscate or confuse people.  Be that as it may, my experience of the European Union has led me to see it as a positive force. I grew up in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s and transfers from the European Union helped members of families like mine to attend college and benefit from the European Social Fund.  I was able to get a grant for third level education.  The investment in education through the fund helped thousands of people of my age who, otherwise, may not have benefited from a third level education.  Neither would we have seen the resultant economic benefits derived by this country.  This is, however, more of an historic context. What is needed is a simplification of the language used in EU documents.  The treaty should be voted for if for no other reason than that it incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a simplified document that codifies the rights of EU citizens.  Whether one is from Ballyhooly or Budapest, one is a citizen of the European Union and, therefore, one's rights are guaranteed by this provision.  The problems encountered by people in this country are exactly the same as by those in other countries.  Our rights should be as inalienable as those in other member states. I speak as a republican and subscribe to the ideals of this republic.  No provision in the treaty is at variance with any of these ideals.  Everything enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives succour to those ideals of egalitarian principles and seeks to ensure every citizen has a defined set of rights.  That is the most important issue. The farming organisations have stated a position on the referendum vis-à-vis the WTO negotiations.  While I am sympathetic to their arguments, I would not advocate a vote against the Lisbon treaty on the basis of an argument over the WTO negotiations.  The treaty will broaden the powers of the European Parliament through enhanced co-decision procedures.  The Council of Ministers it would seem has sway over agricultural decisions affecting this country.  If the powers of the agricultural committee of the European Parliament are broadened and national parliaments are given a greater say in transposing EU legislation, the voice of Irish agriculture will be strengthened and have more power on decisions affecting it. It is important to note we have had little in transparency on the decisions made at EU ministerial council level.  I would bet any money that if the attendance records for EU Council meetings were checked, Irish Ministers would be noted for a fair degree of absenteeism.  Little information is available publicly as to what goes on at these meetings.  Returning to the demise of the Irish sugar industry, a deal was hammered out at European level yet we do not know what happened on that fateful night in November 2005 at the relevant EU Council meeting.  We do not know what Minister took what decision or what was said.  The treaty will make every Council of Ministers meeting more transparent.  I welcome this and it will allow us to know what our Ministers and the Permanent Representation are doing in Brussels. When the Convention on the Future of Europe was held first, the imposition of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing probably set a negative tone.  There was a large-state view on how the proposed EU constitution should proceed with the larger member states seeking to control the agenda.  I do not blame smaller member states for kicking over the traces.  There was a clear modus operandi of seeking to impose a certain set of values in the constitution.  I am glad this has been rolled back and its replacement is a treaty. The ideals of the constitution have been simplified in the treaty.  If the treaty gives more power to the European Parliament, it gives more power to the people of Europe.  If it gives more to national parliaments, it gives more power to us as Irish citizens to have a say in how the European Parliament proceeds on any legislative matter, which can only be welcomed. The treaty also puts in place further checks and balances against the Commission, a necessary mechanism.  EU Commissioners such as Frits Bolkestein have been hell-bent on a liberalisation agenda.  Some from a left-wing perspective will oppose the Lisbon treaty because of that very agenda.  I contend we should agree with the treaty so that checks and balances can be put in place against that neoliberal agenda.  It is also an agenda for which our own Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, has been a strong advocate and has done us no favours in that regard. I support the Lisbon treaty.  While it is not perfect, on balance we will derive far more benefits than negatives from it."
15826	SeanSherlock	Labour	12922.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	313	 I welcome this debate and I wholeheartedly support the motion, which calls for some simple, pragmatic solutions to a problem that afflicts the 10,000 and more people who are affected by acquired brain injury.  The motion also requests the establishment of a regional network of rehabilitation facilities and services to be established in the context of a national rehabilitation strategy.  The response from the Government side offers nothing that would provide comfort or encouragement to those suffering from acquired brain injuries in the context of addressing their needs. There is a regional disparity in the delivery of health care.  If one lives in Cork, Kerry, Galway or Donegal, one is already at a disadvantage if one suffers with an acquired brain injury.  The disparity to which I refer must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Not only does this disparity exist in the area of health, it is also prevalent in the economy and in the Government's regional policy. I recently made representations to a neurologist on behalf of a person with an acquired brain injury.  He confided in me that if he was to close the doors of his practice tomorrow, he would have sufficient clients to deep him in business for the next two years.  That illustrates the seriousness of this issue. Those on the Government side stated that the development of a new rehabilitation centre is at the planning stage and that this will hopefully be up and running by 2012.  That assertion does not provide any grounds for confidence.  The motion before the House calls for an increase in the number of approved posts for consultant neurologists from 24 to 42.  Such a development would almost, if not quite, bring us up to a standard which obtains in other European countries and would represent an immeasurable improvement on the existing position. What we are ultimately concerned with is people's dignity.  There are those who have no access to the services of which they should be able to avail as a matter of right.  These individuals will gain no comfort from what is being said by those on the Government side because there does not appear to be a sense of urgency about this matter.  The Labour Party is requesting that there be such a sense of urgency in order to preserve people's dignity and give them the right to a standard of health care their tax euros should afford them.  Be they resident in Dublin or the regions, they should be treated as equals.  That is what we are calling for in this debate.

15835	SeanSherlock	Labour	12943.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-14 00:00:00	Prelude	508	 In the past 24 hours we have heard much from the Government side about the ESRI report.  If I were a construction worker or a manufacturing worker who had lost his job in the past three months, the ESRI report would not mean a whole pile to me.  I would not be able to bring home the ESRI report on Thursday evening instead of a cheque and put it on the table to feed my family.  The Government has engaged in a degree of spin on the issue in the past 24 hours.  There is a state of denial on this issue. The Labour Party seeks to lobby the Government to examine this issue positively, take in hand certain aspects of the economy and re-jig its thinking on how to work our way out of the downturn, notwithstanding the potential long-term gains as outlined in the ESRI report.  To arrest the decline in the construction industry the Government must come out in favour of infrastructural spending.  It is not sufficient that the NRA and other agencies concentrate spending on interurban or intercity projects.  The NRA must be adequately funded to develop road networks between towns, especially for secondary roads that are not better, in some instances, than boreens.  If regional development, which should be a main plank of a country such as this, is to mean anything, then the national spatial strategy must be returned to the forefront of economic thinking.  A typical hub town such as Mallow must benefit from Government policy that delivers infrastructure, as should towns such as Cobh, Youghal, Midleton and Fermoy.  These towns have not benefitted from the boom except in the area of construction.  Investment in the infrastructure of road networks, business and enterprise parks will encourage local economic growth. The Government must also find ways to take a punt on innovation.  Given that we have €8 billion invested in property overseas we must find ways to claw this back and encourage those who invest in bricks and mortar overseas to take a chance on the commercialisation of technology.  We must support venture capital and divert investment in bricks and mortar to innovation.  On his website David McWilliams states that out of every €1 we borrowed in 2007, 86 cent went into property.  Speculative investment in property, unlike other investment, creates no added value, no products, exports, patents, no skills and no basis for future national wealth.  The Government's recent announcement of €500 million funding is welcome but it must go further given the recent downturn we have encountered.  Enterprise Ireland's €60 million growth fund to support Ireland's small and medium sized companies is minuscule given the potential in this sector.  The cost base to small local family owned firms, through massive local authority charges, is a testament to the contempt in which this Government holds local authorities.  Properly funded local authorities would mean fewer charges for business and more output locally.  There must be a paradigm shift in thinking towards taking the burden of charges away from small businesses.  For too long they have been a soft focus for the Government in terms of overcharging. The local economy will be the key to our future.  This, along with entrepreneurial endeavour through knowledge, will sustain us.  I call on the Government to acknowledge the potential for venture capital and greater investment in the millions of ideas outside these walls, waiting to come to fruition.  For this to take hold, the Government must become an active stakeholder in the process.  Section 23 type tax breaks that fuelled construction must now apply to the venture capital sphere, which fuels ideas, where the risks are higher but the potential for the economy in the long run is greater.

I am advised that the ESB controls the fishing rights of the entire River Shannon and the role of maintenance and preservation of the fishery resources is undertaken by ESB Fisheries Conservation, part of the ESB Hydro Group which operates within the ESB Power Generation directorate.  I am advised that certain protection activities on the Shannon catchment are managed on behalf of the ESB by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. Under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1961, the ESB is required to provide me with an annual report, statistics, returns and accounts in relation to fisheries under its management.  This report includes turnover, expenditure, payroll, operational costs and net loss figures which are extracted from the financial statements of the ESB for the year ended 31 December.  The report includes details for the various fishery activities undertaken by ESB Fisheries Conservation throughout the State.  No breakdown of the figures is provided for the Shannon Catchment.

The reason for the question is the degree of uncertainty which is having a marked result in this country in that we are now paying more for food.  Families are paying much more for staple items and that gives rise to the question.  If the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted, that will have a further uncertainty for food production throughout the European Union into the future.  Many people are asking whether the Government has a coherent policy.  Irish farmers and food producers will be asking whether that €8.6 billion in exports will be compromised in any way if global trends continue as they are.  We are trying to elicit whether, notwithstanding the CAP health check and the FAO agenda on a global basis, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a coherent strategy on the way forward for Irish producers to attain some degree of self-sufficiency — and ensure we take a long-term view on food production in Ireland.  That is the premise of the question.
15838	SeanSherlock	Labour	12949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	124	 Does the Minister acknowledge that if the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted at present, this will have a further adverse effect for producers in developing countries — as well as for Irish producers?  Ultimately, and this harks back to what the Fine Gael spokesman is saying as regards the current WTO deal, there are political considerations, both domestically and internationally.  Irish farmers want to hear that there will be no dismantling of the long-term achievements of CAP into the future.  It is clearly the case that the WTO deal, as it stands, will compromise those gains and indeed, diminish and destroy them.  They want to hear a firm voice from the Government as to its intentions on the WTO deal.

15849	SeanSherlock	Labour	12957.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	83	 Transport is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  It is widely acknowledged that transport is one of the most difficult areas in which to affect a reduction in CO2 emissions.  Biofuels offer one potential means to counter rising emissions levels in the transport sector.  The recent EU proposals setting the biofuel obligation targets for 5.75% in 2010 and 10% by 2020 have included the provision that any new fuels have at least a 35% emissions reduction and have to show that they come from sustainable sources which do not destroy natural habitats.  Biofuel production and use will enhance security of supply and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to direct CO2 benefits, biofuels offer opportunities for waste recycling as biofuel production can use this waste oil as a feedstock.  The development of a supply line of alternative fuel supplies which would still be available should there be a disruption to essential oil supplies is essential so that we can continue to provide basic services in such circumstances. Recent events have shown us that biofuels are not without their complexities.  The diversion of food crops into biofuel production has been one factor in the recent rise in world fuel prices.  There has also been concern that new biofuel production has lead to the conversion of natural forest systems into crop production. It is for this reason that we will ensure that our expanding use of biofuels must take place within the context of the EU sustainability criteria regime, currently under negotiation. The European targets will not be pursued in a manner which threatens the long-term food security of the developing world. By establishing the longer-term targets early, and announcing our intention to move to a biofuels obligation, we aim to create a level of long-term certainty for potential investors, particularly in second-generation biofuels.  These new technologies offer the potential to generate fuels from a number of feedstocks which would not be competing with fuel supplies.  A public consultation on Ireland's biofuels obligation will be launched shortly and we will be encouraging all stakeholders to input into this process.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie. The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers. The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.  Homes and premises that are more difficult to reach are also being examined and potential solutions are being considered.  Consequently, it is expected that all homes and premises in currently unserved areas will be offered a broadband service.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in August 2008. As regards MANs a Value for Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme is currently being finalised in my Department.  I am also finalising a consultation paper on next generation broadband.  Both documents will be published shortly and will inform future Government investment in broadband.

15865	SeanSherlock	Labour	12978.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	306	" The language used by the institutions of the European Union is not understood by the general populace or politicians.  A practical example of this would be to ask any Member what the co-decision procedure means.  I am sure the majority would find it difficult to explain.  If one cannot explain the co-decision procedure, how can one explain what the Lisbon treaty means for enhancing the powers of the European Parliament?  How can one explain that the treaty would give more powers to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  If that language deficit exists, it is difficult for the general populace to latch on to an idea of what the treaty means. I supported the treaty because it aims to enhance the powers of the European Parliament, make the European Council more transparent in its dealings and give, by extension, more powers to the people.  It would address the issues that turf cutters, fishermen, farmers and others have because the European Parliament, and by extension the people, would have extended powers.  However, we voted ""No"" to that.  Therefore, we need to ask ourselves how we should start to educate ourselves as to how the European Union works and what is the inter-relationship between the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament and how this inter-relationship and pooling of sovereignty affects us as citizens of the European Union. The argument of sovereignty was used against the treaty.  When we joined in 1973, we did so on the basis not that we were giving up our sovereignty but that we were pooling our sovereignty and becoming part of a decision-making process of which we were also members and stakeholders.  This treaty was going to enhance that very provision but, as other speakers have said, we found ourselves on the back foot, rebutting arguments that were spurious in the main.  I respect people's decision to vote ""No"".  I have to respect that decision because if there is a fundamental lack of understanding as to how the institutions work, how can a person buy into and believe in the process?  The question is how we are going to address this attitude and make people believe in the process.  Will there now be a complete recasting of our relationship with the European Union?  Do we now proceed backwards into a process of intergovernmentalism or do we enhance and deepen the process by means of inter-institutionalism?  This is the question that needs to be asked. I found it difficult to explain that very relationship to people on the doorsteps.  We must wait for the time when the people of Ireland understand the positive aspects of that relationship and we begin to use a language that does not regard Brussels as some foreign entity but merely as a city in which decisions are taken by us as equal partners to a decision-making process that is the European Union.  Until we begin to decipher the language and change the language we use and make it more amenable and understandable to people, we will continue to have this deficit."
15866	SeanSherlock	Labour	12978.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	420	 My sojourn here for the past year has been one during which there has been a dearth of legislation and a proliferation of statements on everything under the sun.  On a personal level, I could say I have enjoyed the experience but I expected when I came to this House that I would be up to my oxters in legislation and debate but the contrary has been the case.  I sense a malaise and a lack of appetite for the issues which relate to the governance of this country from the Government side of the House. Today we debated the Lisbon treaty referendum and I, as a Deputy for Cork East, had five minutes to discuss and put forward the ideas I had but I could not do so in the time available.  The time available in this House for political discourse and debate is becoming shorter all the time.  That sends a message to the people that politicians could not care one fig about the issues relating to their everyday lives. We are now going to extend this session by one week.  That will feed into that increasing cynicism which exists beyond these walls about political discourse in Ireland.  The Labour Party has many ideas and positive contributions to make in working with this Government, in constructively opposing ideas which this Government puts forward and in offering better solutions, if it can.  However, the space for discourse and debate has been cut to shreds.  That is what exists in the country at present and it needs to be addressed. I have a particular competence as Labour spokesperson for food provision and agriculture.  I have ideas that I could put forward that would, I hope, lead to expanding the base for agricultural production and for dealing with the issues of increased food prices.  However, I am not able to do this because the Government and the leaders of the country will not allow me the opportunity to do so, thereby denying me the opportunity to represent the people who put me here.  This House has primacy in terms of its democratic function but this is not recognised.  The Government is running scared from any kind of debate and is not facing up to its responsibilities.  It needs to start doing so straight away.

The remaining candidates have been engaged in ""Competitive Dialogue"" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements. Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter."

15871	SeanSherlock	Labour	12979.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	456	 I propose to share time with Deputies Tommy Broughan and Brendan Howlin, if I may. I received the same e-mail as Deputy Creed and I believe it has summed up the situation as it relates to a family that is completely reliant on fishing for its livelihood.  A husband and wife re-mortgaged a house to invest in a boat, employ a crew of five people and take to the seas.  In one instance, it spent ten days, or 240 hours, at sea for a return of €725 per man before tax.  Basically, they were earning €3 per hour.  Moreover, the same fishermen then are obliged to incur the stringent regulations applied by the authorities in Ireland, while French, Spanish and fishermen from other countries are looking on and laughing at the regime here. This pertains to realising that a group of people exists within our society who, because of climactic and bureaucratic conditions, incur serious losses of income.  However, they wish to sustain their livelihoods and their coastal communities because they have done so for generations.  As the lady who wrote the e-mail stated, when they hit bad times they want a leg up and not a handout.  Moreover, they do not wish to incur the bureaucratic nightmare that relates to fisheries policy.  However, they want to see put in place a realistic mechanism that would assist them through, if one pardons the pun, choppy waters.  During times when crewmen and women are not bringing in catches and their incomes are being seriously depleted — they are deemed to be self-employed —  they should not be obliged to go cap in hand to the local community welfare officer to beg to supplement their income.  A form of tax incentive or tax break could be put in place on the basis they are sustaining communities in coastal regions.  Moreover, the Government should consider a form of social welfare mechanism to assist such men and women on the basis that their income fluctuates between one end of the year and the other, that would not necessarily be breaking EU direct aid rules. I ask the Chair to let me know when I have spoken for four minutes.  I am anxious about the other Members——

Is the European Union serious about tackling the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing?  Short of stating and acknowledging the problem, is the Government going into that meeting with a serious view on this problem?  It seems it is costing Irish and other European Union fishermen billions of euro annually because of the international nature of the problem.  This matter must be taken up at the WTO.  It must be taken up seriously at Irish level because it is taking food from the mouths of fishermen and is having an impact on a sector of our economy and society that could do very well, were this problem targeted in an effective manner.

15877	SeanSherlock	Labour	12984.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	450	 I am sharing time with Deputy Ciarán Lynch and I propose to speak for two minutes. Cork County Council announced last week that it would be cutting a range of grants designed to help people to make modifications to their homes, namely, the essential repairs grant, the mobility aids grant, the housing adaptation grant and the housing aid for the elderly grant.  The reason is that it is not in a budgetary position to deal with the number of applications being made.  The county council has stated that where possible it will try to process the disabled person's grant.  That specifically relates to Cork County Council's northern division. We are asking that the Minister consider an increase in the funding stream.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, will tell the House there has been an increase year on year in the overall allocation for 2008 and the total amount disbursed in 2007.  The announcement in February by the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, caused the other schemes announced to become so successful that hundreds of people applied for them.  That created an expectation.  We now find in the northern division of Cork County Council that there is a lack of funding to meet the schemes of which many vulnerable and older people are in need to carry out necessary modifications to their homes.  I call on the Minister to see if there is any way to provide an increase in the funding stream.

15880	SeanSherlock	Labour	12986.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	196	" I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I echo the sentiments of our spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, on this Bill.  The legislation, as it is put to us, and the subsequent statements by the Minister, would leave one wondering what is the purpose and content of this legislation.  There are few meaningful sections in the Bill.  The culture and sale of alcohol in this country would probably be better dealt with in the sale of alcohol Bill.  However there are some good provisions in the Bill that are worthy of support. In this country we cannot talk about alcohol without its having some very deep cultural meaning.  Our relationship with alcohol has been ambiguous and we have spoken about it since Adam was a boy.  In my research I came across a study in the Journal of Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland entitled Issues for Irish Alcohol Policy: A Historical Perspective with some Lessons for the Future, published in 1991.  The author of that report, Mr. Daniel McCoy, cited a quotation: “No one can be competent to discuss the drink question unless he has thought over it sufficiently to realise how complicated the subject necessarily is.”  On page 21 of that study the author refers to historical views of the relationship we have with alcohol in this country: Irish drinking was seen as convivial rather than ritual and was used as a bonding with people of the same or other groups.  Irish people ... have a ""social acceptance"" of drunkenness something that is completely opposite to the Islamic view. While I do not advocate that we all turn to Islam, neither do I advocate some of the points raised in this piece of legislation that seeks to modify behaviour.  For example, I do not believe the provision on sale of wine in supermarkets is good.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to reverse that trend.  The vast majority of people drink responsibly and like to imbibe and share a bottle of wine in their homes.  The notion that somebody would have to go to a supermarket that has an off-licence and ask for a bottle to be handed out by a member of staff so that he or she could handle it before purchase is ludicrous.  I am glad the Minister has reversed that provision. I want to speak briefly on theatre licences.  There should not be uniform closing times for nightclubs.  Having hundreds of people spilling out onto the streets at one given time is not an effective method of regularising alcohol consumption, if that is the modus operandi of the Bill.  By modifying or regulating closing times in a very uniform way one will not modify behaviour.  The core of the legislation should be to seek to change the culture.  By staggering closing times, particularly for nightclubs with theatre licences, there would be more of a drip-feed onto the streets and it would be easier to control.  The legislation proposes to have CCTV cameras installed and that would be a good way to monitor the behaviour of clientele exiting onto streets at night time.  However restricting licences, particularly theatre licences, will not be a good way of modifying alcohol consumption.  The two do not correlate. I have attended the Gaiety Theatre, which has a late licence, on a number of occasions.  According to its website, this weekend four different events will take place simultaneously in the theatre's four bars.  There will be a live band playing indie and retro music, on another stage there will be northern soul and there will also be some hip hop.  In a city the size of Dublin one is catering for a wide range of musical tastes and a clientele that likes to go out clubbing.  These people do not necessarily see themselves as deviant in any way when they have taken alcohol and will go home after enjoying a responsible night out.  Curbing that person's behaviour through legislation will not necessarily create a panacea for how alcohol is consumed in this country.  The vast majority of people behave responsibly, like to go out and have a varied night, such as the night provided by a facility such as the Gaiety Theatre.  Restricting those types of licences will not necessarily change the culture.  Although the alcohol advisory group made recommendations with regard to closing times, not all of its recommendations are necessarily contained in the Bill, from what I have read.  I repeat Deputy Pat Rabbitte's point that the sale of alcohol Bill must deal with the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption in this country by modifying closing times and the right to be able to purchase alcohol in a supermarket or off-licence.  Making provisions whereby a certain aspect of a supermarket has to be closed off and all alcohol moved behind a counter was totally ludicrous.  I welcome the changes announced in the Minister's speech and the overtones in that regard. With regard to early morning houses, while I understand the Bill must go through Committee Stage, as it is constituted at present it almost criminalises those who have early morning licences and seeks to convey an impression that anyone with such a licence is the purveyor of all sorts of iniquity.  Many people, some of them constituents of mine, have worked either as dockers or have worked night shifts all their lives.  Due to their pattern of sleeping following a night shift, they will enjoy a pint in the morning in the early house and will then proceed home in a proper and orderly fashion.  Of course, there have been instances where early houses have probably had some degree of anti-social behaviour but this is not outside the norm of any other establishment holding a normal licence. The advisory group did not undertake any quantitative or qualitative studies.  I do not know of one licensee in the early morning trade to whom I spoke who had a visit from any departmental official during the framing of this legislation.  I believe this measure was included as an afterthought and I am glad the Minister has made some concessions in this regard. In conclusion, I am glad the Minister has seen sense.  If we are talking about the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption, the link between the cultural aspects and education have to be expounded more vociferously by the Government.  The only way we will change the culture is by a process of education.  I do not believe some of the provisions in the Bill would necessarily change that culture and, in fact, they would drive alcohol more into an underground mode.  While I welcome the Bill in some respects, I am glad the changes the Minister has proposed will now be made."

The Government found out how much it would cost to clean up the site and is now seeking to spin the matter in such a way as to suggest that the subcontractors on the site were acting outside their station or ultra vires and is now seeking to put the blame on them.  When the Government realised that it had unearthed such a problem, it refused to acknowledge it and sought to cover it up.  Its intention, in the first instance, was never to fully assess and continue the works that are necessary on the site. This is a bombshell to the people who reside in the vicinity of the site.  They thought that the Government was acting in good faith when it decided that the Haulbowline site would be cleared.  For the Government to state that the contract only covered above-surface works and not sub-surface works is an attempt to cover up the problem that exists from a subterranean point of view.  Its intention was never to expend the funds necessary to clean up the site and make it safe for those who reside and work in its vicinity.  I ask the Minister to specifically address the point in the letter dated 18 April 2008 because it is the most pertinent point relating to this issue.

Given the material was transported by a company based in Mallow, when did it transfer to Mallow?  Is the material still in Mallow or has it been deposited in municipally licensed dumps in north Cork?  Is material deposited in non-licensed facilities?  Can the Minister confirm whether some material has ended up in other locations in north Cork?

Will he widen the remit of the current assessment of the site to ensure all traceable material, both on and off site, comes within the remit of that investigation?  In light of these revelations, I also call on the Minister to meet the elected representatives of east Cork and the harbour area and, in particular, the mayor of Cobh immediately to listen to their concerns.

The amendment on the financial aspects — I refer specifically to amendment No. 24 — to the effect that an equity stake could be taken by the State in the event of a call on one of the loans is something that should be considered.  The people of this country would then have some sort of a stake and say in the control of the banking system into the future. The other issue relates to the power of the Minister for Finance.  In any parliamentary democracy there must be checks and balances.  What is being proposed by the Government in its current form gives undue power to the Minister for Finance and the amendments that we have put forward would seek to keep that in check. I do not want to engage in a rhetorical speech here about the nature of global financial capitalism, but what we need in this country, which we can bring about only through our membership of the European Union, is a greater degree of regulation that will ensure that the confidence that has always been in the banking sector will continue.

That is what is being proposed, and that there would be complete transparency in that process as well.  Our amendments are reasonable and should be taken on board.

May we have the exact dates for publication?  With regard to the animal health and welfare Bill, given that this legislation has been included in the legislative programme for over a year and extensive consultation has taken place, why has the Bill not being brought before the House to date?  Although I have been in the House for over a year, I have not yet received a proper explanation as to the reason the Bill has not yet been published.  I am Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and I am dying to get my teeth into legislation, but we have not had any from the Department during this time.  We also deserve an explanation for this. We go through the same charade every week.  Members want to raise issues affecting their constituencies, but are prevented from doing so.

15903	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	364	 In reference to the Minister's speech, particularly where he dealt with the principles of taxation, he said the imposition of taxes must be fair and equitable and that a higher rate must apply to those on higher incomes.  That sounds familiar in that it reads exactly like my old leaving certificate economics Folens textbook and whoever wrote that probably did the leaving certificate around the same time as myself.  However, I always understood from my leaving certificate economics that taxation should be progressive, not regressive.  In this instance, the 1% levy is regressive.  Those on the margins and people who predominantly probably voted for Fianna Fáil are being punished for their loyalty.  They are the people who did not benefit extensively during the boom years.  Instead, they went out every day to do as they always did and now they are being punished.  It is the wrong strategy and a regressive measure.  When one takes account of the increases in VAT and other increases in the cost of living, it will have a negative impact on their real income.  The real incomes of those in the low income bracket will be severely affected and for that reason we oppose this measure.
15904	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	409	 On the price of tobacco, the Labour Party will support the measure on the basis that it will act as a deterrent.  However, in an effort to curb tobacco consumption, we should encourage people to use substitute products and allow those products to be free of VAT.  Products such as Nicorette should be delisted — as currently they can only be sold in pharmacies — and allowed to be sold in supermarkets and to a wider range of people.  I called for such a measure in the previous budget.  I suspect one of the things at play here is that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is firmly in control of that issue.  I take the measure at face value if it is a question of equity but it should be considered in a wider context if it is considered as a health measure. If I were an average Fianna Fáil voter, a male, who liked to back a horse, maybe enjoyed a glass of wine——

Many people who fit that demographic voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election and now they will think seriously about how they will vote the next time.  I am also pleased that the Government did not put any VAT on children's clothes or footwear because, by God, if it did, we would definitely be going back to the 1980s.
15907	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	509	 I refer to the stamp duty on cheques and bills of exchange.  While many people engage in on-line banking and make electronic payments, we have not reached the stage where the bulk of people make such payments by those means.  The facilities do not exist in the community or the commercial sector.  For example, if one goes to a builders' providers it is not always possible to make electronic payments.  This is an unfair measure, especially for older people who still rely on the use of a cheque book.  This is a sneaky way to raise a few bob. Let us suppose a person has a mortgage and there is a life assurance policy tacked on to that mortgage.  Is that person susceptible to the proposed increase vis-à-vis life assurance and investment funds?  This would have the net effect of increasing the cost of mortgages for a certain sector.  It is proposed that this would yield €13 million per year.  I seek clarification on this matter.

15921	SeanSherlock	Labour	13098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-16 00:00:00	Prelude	601	 I wish to share time with Deputies O'Shea and Ferris.
15922	SeanSherlock	Labour	13098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-16 00:00:00	Prelude	603	 I wish to speak about the subject of this motion.  I will stick to the point of this debate, which has gone all over the shop, quite frankly.  The purpose of the motion is to seek an extension to the farm waste management scheme.  The Labour Party would support such an extension, not for political expediency or point-scoring, but because we realise that a certain number of farmers will not be able to make the deadline.  We support such farmers for reasons of common sense and pragmatism, some of which have already been outlined.  I am aware of farmers who have not been able to get contractors to do the works which are required under the scheme.  The poor weather we have endured this year has delayed some building works.  Many farmers will not be able to meet the deadline as a consequence of a myriad of other circumstances, which I will not repeat.  There is merit in raising, in a genuine way, the possibility of an extension to the deadline.  Some people will be adversely affected if a change is not made. The valid point made earlier by Deputy Deenihan, which has also been raised by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Organisation, ICMSA, deserves further examination.  I refer to the interpretation of State aid and the interpretation of the scheme.  I wish to quote from a letter sent by the president of the ICMSA to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 25 August last.  The letter, which gets to the heart of the debate on this motion, reads: Dear Minister I wish to refer again to the 31 December 2008 deadline under the Farm Waste Management Scheme.  While we are all aware of the background to the scheme and the setting of the December 2006 and December 2008 deadlines, there is clearly a major problem for a growing number of farmers if the 31 December 2008 deadline is to be interpreted as meaning that the work must be completed and approved by your Department on or before that date. We do not accept that this is the only interpretation.  I believe, based on the EC Guidelines for State Aid in the Agriculture and Forestry Sector, that Ireland should propose that the 31 December 2008 deadline can be met by an individual farmer where the building work is to be completed or commenced after the 31 December 2008 if that farmer has a legally binding contract for the construction of the building and or supply of materials in place on or before 31 December 2008. This procedure, reliance on a legally binding contract, is used quite often for the phased introduction or termination of tax relief measures.  I believe that this procedure can be readily adopted by your Department and would meet the requirements set down in the EC Guidelines for State Aid in the Agriculture and Forestry Sector. That proposal, which is based on a valid interpretation of the state aid guidelines, represents common sense.  I echo Deputy Deenihan's comments on it.  In his response to this motion, the Minister, Deputy Smith, did not respond to Deputy Deenihan's point.  I call on one of the Government Deputies to respond to the issue that has been raised in an honest manner.  Is this interpretation of the guidelines valid? I do not wish to play politics with this issue.  A balanced and reasonable view is being put forward by a group of farmers who will not be in a position to submit the card A due to genuine reasons.  It is reasonable for us to echo the views of those farmers, notwithstanding what Deputy Conlon and others have said in support of the scheme.  We have had superfluous speeches by Government backbenchers, but there is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.  Before the clock runs down on this debate, I hope that the Government will come back with a response to the points that I and Deputy Deenihan have raised.  There is a genuine concern among a small minority of farmers and that must be addressed.

Those who have reached the autumn years of their lives once had the cushion, the safety and the peace of mind of knowing they could go to a GP in an hour of need, but that luxury is no longer afforded to them.  We had lectures last week from the Taoiseach about his republican and egalitarian ideals.  What was done and visited upon these people last week was neither republican nor truly egalitarian.  It ran counter to anything that is republican or egalitarian. In the short time I have, I implore the Government to reverse this decision.  If the thousands of people who came onto the streets of Dublin today are anything to go by in terms of delivering a short sharp message to the Government, today was the day it happened.  The Government must listen to those people who have reached their autumn years and are now worried and full of angst about these measures.  If we are truly to be a republic in the purest sense of that word, we must reverse this measure.

In the meantime the Department is working with the school to find a solution to  the schools immediate accommodation needs and the Department expects to have a  satisfactory solution in place when the school returns for mid term break. In relation to progression of the schools permanent project, the Department is  cognisant of the site restrictions  which would impede further expansion of the existing school.

15931	SeanSherlock	Labour	13111.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	" Every time I walk into this Chamber, I pass a statue of Thomas Davis, a fellow Mallow man famous for the quote, ""educate that you may be free"".  The Government, by its actions in recent weeks, has sought to curb these freedoms.  When Davis spoke of freedom, he may have spoken in the context of political liberation but he also spoke in the context of the freedom of ideas, thought and consciousness. If we are to educate our children in this nation in the context that Davis spoke about we must give them all the tools we can.  The Government, by its actions last week, sought to limit those freedoms and limit the giving of those tools to those children and it should be ashamed of its actions. When I look across the benches of this House I see certain Members of the Green Party playing the Tadhg an dá thaobh and running with the hare and hunting with the hound.  I say to them that if they are true to their political conscience and creed they will vote with the Labour Party on this motion and vote for the children of the nation and for the proper education policy that we wish to see in this land. In speaking to this motion I speak for the schools in my constituency.  I speak for the children of Ballyhooley national school and the people in Carrigtwohill, Fermoy, the Mercy national school in Cobh, Midleton College and Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann.  These are among many who made representations to me about the swingeing cutbacks that will be implemented and the adverse effects they will have on the day to day operations of their schools. It must be admitted that great strides have been made in many aspects of education during the past ten years, although not at a pace we would wish to see.  However, it is wrong for any Government to roll back those achievements in one fell swoop and send us headlong back to where we were in the 1980s.  This is not the mark of a nation making progress.  I urge the Government to think hard about its actions. If we are going to flourish as a nation we must look to future generations.  The way we can flourish, socially and economically, is by ensuring every child bar none has the best chance in life he or she can have and having an education system that is world class.  Anything else is not what we want. This motion is reasonable.  It speaks to the genuine fears the people have about the way they see the education system going.  The people beyond these walls, the people of this land, who have shouted loudly, and thank God for their voices, do not want to see their children treated this way nor should the Legislature treat their children this way.  We want to give them a fair chance and a fair opportunity.  This is what we seek through this motion. On Friday, as I walked down the main street of Mallow I was approached by transition year students from St. Mary's secondary school.  They flocked around me to tell me they will not be able to carry out many of the projects and aspirations they have for their transition year because of the cuts.  They asked me to let their voices be heard in Dáil Éireann when next I spoke on the subject.  I speak for those girls and for the aspirations they have.  I speak for the aspirations I had when I was their age and for the educational opportunities I had which were limited because of the times I grew up in during the 1980s.  Do not send the education system back to the 1980s.  Let us think forward and consider the investment that can be made now and the payoffs in the long run as a result."

15937	SeanSherlock	Labour	13117.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	" I will begin with a quotation from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment report entitled Innovation in Ireland published in 2008: Ireland's ability to build and sustain its innovation capacity depends on developing and maintaining our skills at world-class levels, and on high quality, continuous education.  Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability;... I repeat the second sentence: ""Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability"".  I listened carefully to the Minister and it is hard to disagree with what has been said in that one senses there is a proactive approach and a continuation of strategies to maintain employment.  However, were I one of the 32,000 plus persons made redundant and thus having to apply between 1 January and the end of this month for assistance under the redundancy scheme, this would not provide me with too much solace. I know of a particular apprentice — there are hundreds like him — who, even if he wanted, could not return to complete his course because there are no jobs in his particular field.  The construction industry has dried up.  The proof of this is the current lack of house building.  Given these trends, apprentices are reluctant to continue their training. I know of an apprentice who, having completed his leaving certificate examination in 2006, decided to embark on a few years' travelling.  When he returned home he took up an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker but was subsequently laid off.  He then decided, given the trends that were emerging, to do a public relations course.  When the person concerned, who was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, approached the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of a place on a public relations course he was told he would have to be signing on for 156 days before he would quality for the back-to-education allowance.  This is wherein the nub of the problem lies. I referred earlier to the thousands of people already laid-off and made redundant, many of whom want to get back into the education sphere.  I acknowledge the €1.5 billion allocation for FÁS and the investment in SMEs.  However, many of the people who previously worked in research and development and high-end IT jobs now want to do MBAs and to upskill but there is no mechanism through which they can re-enter the FÁS or SME framework without their incurring serious economic hardship.  These people do not qualify for third level grants or the back-to-education allowance as they are already in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance. Were I on the opposite side of the House I would be re-examining the demographics of this situation in terms of where the lay-offs have taken place and the educational attainment of those involved.  I would also be much more flexible in my approach, which is what the Government will have to be if unemployment continues to rise.  A person who is eligible for jobseeker's allowance for 12 months should also be eligible for a back-to-education allowance if he or she wishes to upskill by re-entering the education system. The 22,500 people currently engaged in community employment schemes do exceptional work.  However, many of these people are hampered after a few years by the principle of progression, of which we hear so much.  I would also be a little more flexible in respect of the requirement to quit a community employment scheme after a specified period.  I would allow for a greater degree of flexibility in terms of permitting these people, where possible, to continue to work in their communities and would pay them the allowances required in this regard.  This would help to sustain communities and would provide these people with employment. There have been lay-offs in a wide range of areas, including agriculture, banking, finance and insurance.  A wide array of people will not necessarily fit into the training schemes envisaged by Government.  Many people working in the energy, manufacturing, building and civil engineering areas have been laid-off and will not get work any time soon.  Many of them were reliant on the construction industry and on the IT sector, in particular the research and development component of the IT sector, an area almost always hit first during a downturn.  These people are unable to return to the education system unless they pay for it themselves.  While an unemployed single person with savings has a good chance of accessing a third level course, an unemployed person within a family structure will need to put aside every penny to meet his or her family circumstances. The Government needs to apply some lateral thinking in this area.  It does not appear to have internalised the full extent of the problems facing unemployed people in the future.  Instead of quoting chapter and verse in this House on that which we know already — one has only to look at the Departments' websites to learn what is being spent — it should bring forth fresh ideas in regard to how our people can upskill. I acknowledge the investment in FÁS training for installation schemes and so on.  It was once said to me that the next boom might result from our having to fix some of the faulty and dodgy houses constructed in haste during the past ten years.  It may be that such a scheme will be required.  However, we must also cater for high end jobs.  We must bear in mind that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are currently unemployed. We need to look after those people who will not necessarily fit into the mechanism prescribed by the two Ministers in their response.  I reiterate the Government's words that individuals need to respond.  Individuals want to respond to the changing market and to this downturn.  However, they may want to diversify into completely different areas of education.  This, for some people, is an opportunity to re-assess from where they come.  If we are talking about entrepreneurial spirit in this country, the only way it can be reinvigorated is if the €179 million allocated to Science Foundation Ireland or €90 million spent on encouraging FDI is re-examined and perhaps apportioned at least in part to localised schemes for people who have that kind of spirit and who wish to create indigenous and SME-type industry."

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.  What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago. In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006 which, inter alia, suggested that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  Therefore, while having to make difficult decisions for the 2009 estimates, particularly in the current financial climate, my main focus has been to retain resources in the schools targeted under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) initiative. DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools have been included in the programme.  These comprise 673 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools. In the case of those schools that have not been identified for inclusion in DEIS it will now be necessary to withdraw disadvantaged posts and additional financial resources from them with effect from 31 August 2009.  These resources had been historically provided to schools under previous disadvantage schemes. As the school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme it is now necessary to withdraw its Disadvantaged Areas scheme post and additional financial resources with effect from 31 August 2009.

15951	SeanSherlock	Labour	13138.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-25 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 One question needs to be addressed regarding this banking crisis, namely whether the Government guarantee will result in the writing off of private debt and turning that into public debt for which the Irish citizen will ultimately pay.  In that context, should we be contemplating the writing off of private debt to avoid a probable recourse to the taxpayer?  In September of this year, the Central Bank published data showing that the M1 money supply — the physical currency circulating in the economy and the moneys held on deposit accounts — is shrinking rapidly.  What does the 11% year-on-year decrease in the M1 money supply tell us?  Irish businesses have less money in their accounts.  They have become stifled, they cannot repay their debts and they cannot access credit.  If Irish businesses are not able to repay their debts or access credit, the banks will incur further losses.  Who will cover such losses?  The bank guarantee scheme provides for the Irish taxpayer to cover losses to banks through shrinkage in the economy.  If banking activity is shrinking, then bank losses are inevitable. The Labour Party is proposing a set of practical measures, as outlined by Deputy Penrose, to stimulate the economy.  The European Investment Bank, rather than the private equity capitalists, has to become our saviour.  Private equity capitalists do not care about the future of the Irish economy.  As soon as they get their pound of flesh, they move on to the next target.  It should be noted that the Carlyle Group, which is currently flirting with one of this country's banks, was funded by Osama bin Laden's family at one stage of its history.  I wish to make it clear that we are dealing with people of that kind.  We should be very careful about who we flirt with when we are looking for people to invest in the Irish economy and the Irish banking infrastructure. The Labour Party is in favour of sustainable and responsible investment.  That has not been a mainstream feature of this country's banking culture.  Having a sustainable and responsible approach to investment is not part of Irish banking culture.  There is no proper risk assessment of lending and there is no proper model of corporate social responsibility.  As Deputy Penrose has said, we need to change the culture of banking in this country so that we begin to lend in the real economy.  Irish businesses should not continue to be stifled, as they have been stifled to date.  The new type of lending we advocate will, inter alia, champion social capital.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, used to speak about Mr. Putnam’s book, Bowling Alone, in the context of the need for volunteerism and investment in social capital.  Why should we not use the banking guarantee scheme that the Government is sponsoring as a means of ensuring that we enforce change in this country’s banking culture and thereby enhance investment in social capital?  Why should preferential lending rates, below the ECB rate, not be offered to community organisations, sporting clubs and schools for any measure that involves effort that enhances our communities? The banking crisis has given us an opportunity to set up an ecological loan book, whereby preferential lending rates can be made available to commercial and domestic projects that seek to reduce our dependence on carbon.  Such loans would be offered in respect of everything from residential solar panels to biodiesel plants.  Such a system would help us to offset some of the obligations we have under the Kyoto Protocol.  We need to be imaginative in our approach to lending and getting out of this crisis.  Nothing I have seen from the Government benches gives me confidence, as a Member of this House and as a citizen, that this country is in safe hands and that our banking infrastructure is secure for the future.

15955	SeanSherlock	Labour	13139.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	502	 The Minister for Finance made a call to patriotic action.  It was more of a cull in terms of patriotic action because despite the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the current difficulties we face and the external factors that have affected this economy, there was no imagination in terms of the framing of this budget.  There was little by way of providing an economic stimulus that would create jobs and build a foundation on which we could climb out of this morass if not in the short term at least in the medium term.  Instead of putting in place some inventive measures, the Government decided to slash and burn across the divide. To take one sector, agriculture is a primary producer.  Food and drink exports amount to €8.2 billion to €8.6 billion every year but at a time when production was going on in that sector and in the face of a global food scarcity, the Government decided to take money out of that productive part of the economy by way of cuts in the installation aid scheme and not extending the farm waste management scheme. It has been proven that every euro spent within the rural economy has a multiplier effect and it stays within the rural economy.  In cutting the installation aid scheme and other such schemes, the Government is automatically reducing that multiplier effect and the potential within what was a productive sector.  That did not make economic sense.  I ask the Minister, when replying, to address that particular aspect because we need to be imaginative about the direction in which this country is going in this tough economic climate. The issue of VAT is one on which I would like the Minister to respond.  If we are in an inflationary period and if there is less money in the economy, and public and consumer sentiment is non-existent, why would the Minister increase VAT at a time when people are not spending money?  The returns to the Exchequer will be significantly reduced anyway.  If the Minister could stimulate such demand by reducing VAT he would, by extension, increase returns to the Exchequer.  That seems to be the most logical approach.  He should not increase VAT but maintain it at the current rate or reduce it marginally but he certainly should not increase it in the current climate.  I do not understand the reason the Minister has done that, and perhaps we could get an answer as to his logic in that regard. On the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 relating to research and development activity, we all agree that foreign direct investment has been very good for this country.  That is something that has been a bedrock of policy for a number of years but we need to consider whether we should continue to rely on foreign direct investment. I welcome the tax credits for research and development but I again question the reason for the base year of 2003.  If a company is involved in research and development there is a good possibility that its research could predate that date.  I would have favoured 2000 as a base year to try to exercise a credit of that nature but perhaps there is a logic to the Minister's position on that.  He might respond to that when replying. On the issue of banking, we need some consistency.  Banks, by their very nature, have been profligate in the way they have lent in that much of it was developer led.  There is an opportunity now through this State guarantee to enforce a new culture on banking.  I argued last night in our Private Members' motion that an ecological loan book could be set up.  At a time when not everybody will be eligible for the national insulation scheme we could set up a system of preferential rates that would allow people to borrow for improvements to their homes that would offset carbon.  As I understand that scheme, the State has the control to enforce that type of lending and I do not understand why it does not do that.  That would have a knock-on multiplier effect in terms of job creation.  If preferential loans could be given to people who are not eligible for grant aid for home improvements, it would have a positive knock-on effect for the local economy.  We need a little more imagination.  While we all acknowledge the position we are in, four Ministers are involved in the Enterprise, Trade and Employment brief and surely many actions can be taken to stimulate the economy.  This party has given many ideas about what we would do if we were on that side of the House and there is scope for those to be taken on board. There has been much battering of the public sector of late.  I know umpteen local authority outdoor staff on Cork County Council's northern division who have been let go.  They were either on temporary contracts or had tendered for jobs.  One of them has worked for the council as a JCB operator for more than 30 years of his life, was out on call at 2 a.m., 5 a.m. or whenever the council wanted him and gave a good service.  If we are to have an argument in this House about culling the public service we must be careful.

They have an equally dire need for a new school.  They have been campaigning for such a school for over 11 years.  When I was a member of Cork County Council, we co-ordinated with the local VEC on the rezoning of a specific parcel of land to allow the new school to be developed.  That site was purchased over 12 months ago.  As I understand it, a schedule of accommodation was submitted in September of this year.  Nothing has come back from the Department yet.  The school authorities are seeking the appointment of a design team.  Such an appointment should not incur an undue cost.  On behalf of the community, I want the next stage of the process to be reached. Like their counterparts in hundreds of schools throughout the State, the pupils and teachers of the vocational school in Buttevant are having to work in dire circumstances.  The building in question dates back to pre-Famine times.  Its structures are not in line with what one would expect to see in a modern school.  Notwithstanding the financial circumstances the State finds itself in, if it is to be progressive it needs to move this project onto the next stage.  That would not involve a major outlay.  All I am calling for at this stage is the progression of the project — it should not be stalled. I will leave it at that because I have summed up my point.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter in the past and have raised it on the Adjournment previously.  I will continue to raise this issue.  I appreciate that the Minister of State will give me a pro forma reply.  I appeal to the official in the Department of Education and Science who will be responsible for reading the transcript of this debate to take up this case and try to move it on to the next stage.

15965	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	428	 I will share time with Deputies Penrose and Ferris.
15966	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	430	 I wish to begin by replying to Deputy Collins.  Not every farmer in the country wants to build houses or become a developer on his or her land-holding.  Those people are in the minority.  I remind the Deputy that the arrangements he spoke about are only guidelines and that the county development plans of each county take precedence over those guidelines.  In response to Deputy Brady, the Government in question was not a Democratic Left-led Government.  There were three parties in that particular arrangement. I represent a party that traditionally would not be aligned to the farming community.  However, in terms of my wholehearted supported for this motion, I can give an analysis that is unfettered and devoid of political expediency.  I do not intend to be politically expedient tonight, but to speak of the facts. We reside in a European Union where UK young farmers represent 5.6% of the total farming workforce and Irish young farmers represent 10.5%.  These percentages are from a report from the European Parliament issued in May 2008 and represent farmers under the age of 35.  If we are to be innovative in the manner we create jobs during the current downturn, we need to create incentives.  The only way to create incentives is to ensure that coterie of the population — the under 35s — who are interested in becoming involved in agriculture get the financial incentives to do so. There is an economic rationale for ensuring the early retirement scheme and installation aid scheme for young farmers are maintained.  By allowing these new farmers to enter the sector, which is a productive sector and generates revenues of €8.6 billion per annum in food and drink exports about which the Minister spoke, we encourage innovation.  However, by culling the scheme, we create a disincentive.  At a time when, for example, FÁS has a budget of €1.05 billion, we have spent €48.4 billion on the indigenous sector through Enterprise Ireland and we are spending €90 million on capital expenditure for IDA Ireland, all of which is for job creation, there is a ratio of that kind of investment for every job created.  Therefore, every job created costs the economy a certain amount, a specific figure which I have not been able to ascertain. Therefore, by creating, allowing or facilitating the installation aid scheme and by investing in each and every one of the young farmers new to the sector, the Government is progressing the sector and creating a job, or in economic terms a multiplier effect, that ensures the rural economy will continue to be maintained.  This is a rational, objective and cold view that is devoid of any political expediency. These schemes are essential if we are to maintain our comparative advantage within the rural economy.  If the Government continues to remove funds from the rural economy, the rural depopulation we have witnessed, the lack of proper infrastructure and the lack of expenditure within that economy will have a further detrimental effect.  Any person who avails of a scheme such as the young farmer installation aid does not spend the money in Santa Ponsa, but invests it in his or her own farmholding, generally in a way that is innovative and will increase the yield or return to that farm. To return to the demographics, the bulk of farmers are within a certain age group and there is a certain wisdom that comes with that intergenerational solidarity that occurs within the sector.  However, with every new influx of blood, there comes new ideas.  We talk about issues such as carbon off-setting and the possibility of micro-energy production, but if we talk about innovative ideas, we need to ensure the incentive is there to allow young people come into the sector.  What the Minister has done by culling the scheme is to disincentivise them and that is not the way to go. I represent a rural-urban mix of a constituency.  My constituency traditionally had large agribusiness interests, but these have declined over a period of time.  There is now a real opportunity for people of my generation to come into the sector.  These people will have a farming mix that will involve energy creation and a different type of product mix that will yield benefits to the country in the long run.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to rethink the changes. I conclude by quoting from Macra na Feirme, which has a rational position on these issues: Macra is demanding the complete reopening of the young farmer installation aid scheme.  This scheme was agreed under the Social Partnership for 2007-2013 and is co-funded by the EU. If it is a co-funded procedure devised under social partnership pillars, we must honour the agreement, just as we honour all the other pillars of the social partnership arrangement in the country.

15970	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	55	 I will share time with Deputy Willie Penrose. I express solidarity with all pig producers in the organic and non-organic sector, craft butchers, processors and every worker who has been adversely affected by this crisis.  Public health and consumer confidence must be restored immediately.  This will be the indicator of the future viability of the pigmeat industry.  Producers have been unfairly plunged into a crisis which is not of their making.  Farms which purchased contaminated feed did so in good faith and on the basis that the product was licensed. The pork industry is the fourth largest in the agriculture sector and is worth approximately €400 million per annum.  I understand exports of pigmeat were worth €212 million in 2007.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the fact that only ten of a possible 400 producers have been affected by contaminated feed.  I understand the producers in question produce less than 10% of the overall kill.  The minimal number of producers affected should help restore public confidence because if the figures I cite are correct, 90% of the pig kill is beyond reproach and scientific evidence will show that the risk to human health diminishes significantly. We cannot underestimate the importance of the meat industry.  Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach and Minister, I note that neither of them referred to a timeline for the return of pork to the shelves.  I understood from the Taoiseach that the European Food Safety Authority must make this call from a scientific perspective.  I call on the authority and European Commission to make allowance for the importance of the meat industry to this State.  These institutions must act as soon as possible to ensure products are placed on the shelves again and public confidence restored.  If the European Union will not provide a compensation package, at least Commissioner Kuneva and the EFSA should issue a statement within 24 to 48 hours indicating that production can commence again. The true test of patriotism, if I may use that word, is to stand in solidarity on this issue.  We should not use it to score political points off the Minister.  We all know family farmers or workers in processing plants whose livelihoods depend on a viable pig and beef industry.  At the same time, however, fundamental questions must be asked of the Department.  I call on the Minister to act with greater urgency and to implore the European Commission to make a statement forthwith to enable the industry to start working again. While the Government was correct to introduce a total recall of pork products, if the problem affected less than 10% of producers and 90% of pork products are thereby deemed to be safe and fit for human consumption, the Minister should have made a statement in the 24 to 48 hour period following the total recall indicating that production could recommence.  He should clarify the reason this has not been done. If the traceability system was working adequately and the one-step-up, one-step-back principle was being adhered to, it would have been possible to isolate the relevant producers and stop their production.  This would have allowed other producers who never used this material to continue to provide product for the market.  This issue must also be addressed. The national feed inspection programme is a rigorous regime applied to all primary producers, whether pig or beef farmers.  Everything which reaches the farm gate is subject to the most stringent inspection controls in the world.  Why did the inspection process for feedstuffs fail in respect of the producer in question?  The systems failure which occurred has significantly diminished the potential of the pig and pigmeat industry.  The sector will take a long time to claw its way back to its previous position.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. We need to show solidarity with all the players in the industry.  This is a national issue on which the Labour Party will support the Minister in every step of the process.  Nevertheless, the problem must be handled with a greater sense of urgency.

Will there be a new regulatory framework dealing with non-food grade oil, as I understand it?  My second question relates to the routine sample of pork fat.  The Minister stated on 28 November that a routine sample of pork fat taken as part of his Department's national residue monitoring programme was shown to be positive for the presence of non-dioxin-like marker PCBs.  Is there routine testing for PCBs on an ongoing basis throughout the food industry?  On Friday, 28 November we were told that this indicative testing took place.  On 4 December the Department issued a press release confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.  The Dutch authorities contacted the Department and the FSAI regarding their independent investigation.  When they communicated that, how long had the Dutch authorities' investigation been in train?  When was the rapid alert system kicked into action?  This is also an important point.  The Minister has told us this all happened on this island, effectively.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests the rapid alert kicked in long before this process and we need some clarification on that point.

15974	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	344	 I wish to share time with Deputy Willie Penrose and I propose to take seven minutes.
15975	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	346	 Something that does not necessarily relate to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, given that we do not have many opportunities to discuss fisheries is the additional funding emergency measures were agreed in July.  It is still urgent that progress be made to make funds available at the earliest possible date.  I understand that the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, has made submissions and there is an ongoing campaign.  We all know that fuel prices have decreased dramatically but the cost inputs for fishermen during that period were significant as were losses incurred during that period.  We should support that measure. Will that €37 million expenditure be expedited?  Perhaps the officials could revert to us in due course on this matter. With the pending December Council of Ministers meeting due on 18 and 19 December, it is important that this House give time to debating the issues at hand.  I have had some significant briefings today from the FIF, more specifically from the Irish South and West Fish Producers' Organisation, on the issues.  It is worth reiterating some of the points they make. They state that the decisions taken at the December Council meeting will be vital to the future of the industry.  I note the Minister of State said he supports the appropriate conservation measures for Celtic Sea cod such as spawning area closures which were originally proposed by fishermen and are delivering positive effects on stock levels in that area.  The organisation's position is such that it proposes that the creation of a sub-divided management area separating the English Channel from the rest of the existing Celtic Sea, has certain implications for Ireland.  The organisation's briefing paper states: The separation of Area VIId, the English Channel, from the remainder of Area VIIb-k for the purposes of management, and the establishment of a separate Total Allowable Catch for that area has significant implications for the Irish fishing industry. While the measure is not objectionable in itself, the subdivision of the stock must not disadvantage Irish fishermen by directly dividing the quotas, giving Ireland quota in an area (VIId) where Irish fishermen do not fish. Irish fishermen catch most of the Cod in the west of the existing management area, to the south of Ireland.  This must be reflected in the new subdivision of quota between the management areas. I could not have put the argument any better. With regard to the proposals on the fishing effort, there is a school of thought that suggests that the European Commission is effectively re-writing, after the fact, the decision reached by the Council.  The FIF state that the Commission is re-writing the text of the decision on fishing effort in the Irish Sea and the north west which was reached at last month's EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  This cannot be allowed as it would mean an immediate 25% cut in fishing possibilities in 2009, from what was in the decision which was in itself misguided, draconian and punitive.  The November Council of Fisheries Ministers reached a decision on a new and intensified series of measures for fisheries in the Irish Sea and the north west.  I also understand that the Irish Government and industry succeeded in thwarting the efforts to have this approach extended to the south and west coasts.  The FIF has stated this to me today.  The measure agreed which affect the Irish Sea and north west, clearly curtailed fishing effort in the form of kilowatt-days to the amount of effort in previous base years.  It has only come to light in recent days that the Commission is going significantly beyond what was agreed and it now proposes in 2009 to impose a further 25% cut from the base effort.  This is contrary to all understanding of what was agreed.  I understand the Minister may share this position but he needs to put it on the record of the House at some stage. I note the Minister of State's statement on the Hague Preferences, that they are an integral part of the TAC, total allowable catch and quota allocations system and they must continue to be allocated or formally incorporated into the TAC and quota system and not perhaps subjected to the annual approval which they must undergo.  I understand the point made by the Minister of State when he states that certain member states would seek to denigrate or downgrade that agreement.  The position adopted by the FIF in continuing to ensure that the Hague issues are maintained, is paramount to the industry in the future.  More recently there has been positive interplay between the fishermen's organisations and the Minister.  The emergency package agreed in July, however, needs to be expedited.  It is a matter of grave importance to the industry.

15983	SeanSherlock	Labour	13153.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	451	 The amendment in the Bill that replaces section 45(5)(a) of the Health Act 1970, coupled with the fair deal legislation on nursing homes, by their very nature, seek to destroy any semblance of public provision and universality in the health care system, as it relates to older people.  The research indicates that 20,000 people who have had access to a medical card will no longer have such an entitlement.  This sends the wrong message about how the country deals with public health to those who are in their autumn years.  Notwithstanding the pre-existing deal done with general pracititioners, whereby the payment per patient would be significantly more than it is today, the health outcomes for patients in that category were significantly better as a result of having a universal right to a medical card.  For men, in particular, having the medical card meant a much greater likelihood that they would go to their GP to monitor their health.  I know of people in my constituency who were more inclined to go because they had the medical card.  From talking to GPs, I also know that they achieved far better outcomes for their patients owing to the entitlement to a medical card.  When we talk about public health and primary care provision which is woefully inadequate in the part of the country that I represent, I do not understand why the Minister would row back on a decision made to provide a medical card when the net benefit to the Exchequer is positive in terms of improved health outcomes because it keeps people out of secondary and tertiary care facilities. Fianna Fáil backbenchers spoke about hysteria and the media frenzy whipped up over this issue.  The people who marched on Leinster House were not whipped up into a frenzy of hysteria.  At the time they took the rational view that their rights were being undermined.  They were rightfully fearful of the possibility that their entitlements would be taken from them in one fell swoop.  I am glad they decided to organise and exercise their right to protest.  If they had not done so, we would not be here today and the Government would not have rowed back on the position it took on this issue on budget day.  If we are to exercise public health policy correctly, it is clear that the campaign to maintain the automatic right to a medical card will need to have a positive outcome.  We need to continue in that vein.  I do not see how the Minister will be able to garner savings in this instance.  It seems that she intends to reallocate resources from those whose automatic entitlement is being withdrawn to others who might be able to avail of a medical card.  People on lower incomes will not receive a medical card in the current climate because the thresholds have not been increased sufficiently.
15984	SeanSherlock	Labour	13153.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2008-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	451	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 to 223, inclusive, together. Language support teachers are appointed to assist schools in providing  additional English language support for pupils for whom English is a second  language. There are currently 554 Language Support Teachers allocated to post- primary  schools, at a current cost of approximately €35 million per annum. The number  of teaching posts in each second-level sector is broken down as follows: 288 in  voluntary secondary, 88 in community and comprehensive and 178 in VEC schools. The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalents (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools. The budget measures announced recently will mean that the level of language  support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a  maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007. As I announced on budget day we will provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis. At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out the allocation process for 2009/10 in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for individual schools  or list of schools could not be justified and would actually impede this  process. Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the  OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning  that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively  unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high  concentrations of newcomer children. I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching  resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the  inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing  the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises  that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided  to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our  provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the  question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to  ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an  intercultural Ireland. My Department is providing support and training for teachers of English as an  additional language in the current school year. At post primary level, the  Second Level Support Service (SLSS) have identified members of their team to  provide training and support for teachers of English as an additional language.  The training has been designed and will be rolled out in early 2009. The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalent (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools: WTE No of schools Between 0.1-1 310 1-2 100 2-3 41 3-4 24 4-6 14

15995	SeanSherlock	Labour	13159.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy. The  Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over  the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably  extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the  Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the  past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public  finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put  ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future. However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that  they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country. My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme. I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will  impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced  levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary  services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this. The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of funding for the day to day running costs of primary schools which will  see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  The Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit. Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of  absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave. In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent. In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of  the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with  the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the  additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are  met.

15996	SeanSherlock	Labour	13159.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	124	 I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy. The  Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over  the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably  extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the  Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the  past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public  finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put  ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future. However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that  they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country. My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme. I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will  impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced  levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary  services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this. The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of funding for the day to day running costs of primary schools which will  see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  The Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit. Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of  absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave. In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent. In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of  the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with  the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the  additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are  met. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
15997	SeanSherlock	Labour	13209.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 I respectfully ask that time be made available for a debate on the 2009 allocations made by the National Roads Authority for non-national roads.  The reason I seek a debate is that County Cork has received an allocation of €61 million, the 27th lowest of the 29 local authorities.  The county has more than 11,000 km of roadway.
15998	SeanSherlock	Labour	13209.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 The reason I ask for a debate is that it is important to examine the allocations made by the NRA in relative terms and in the context of Exchequer expenditure on roads, particularly in County Cork.

16001	SeanSherlock	Labour	13209.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	656	 I wish to record my utter disgust, as well as that of the staff and patients of the Heatherside Hospital in north Cork, at the HSE's unilateral decision to close the facility which has housed 42 patients for many years.  The decision is illogical and without any common sense basis.  It was taken without any consultation with the stakeholders, the nursing staff or the patients.  This is a facility that has looked after patients with mental health issues for several years.  What is happening in society is disgusting.  These 42 patients will be moved into a facility that was already closed down, unfit for human habitation and with Dickensian conditions. I do not know what the Government or the HSE is at, particularly when they give us much rhetoric on how well they look after mentally ill patients.  I am calling on them to put a stay of execution on this decision until such time as there is consultation with the patients' representatives, the families and the community to ensure everyone's rights and entitlements are vindicated.  If we have any sense of decency, this issue will be re-examined.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to intervene directly with the HSE to ensure the rights and entitlements of the affected patients are protected and common decency prevails.

16010	SeanSherlock	Labour	13210.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	164	 With all due respect that is an inadequate answer.  We have been asking this question for the past year.  It is an insult to the people on this side of the House that we are not getting the right answer.
16011	SeanSherlock	Labour	13210.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	309	 In light of the Taoiseach's announcement on Tuesday, I wish to refer to the Financial Regulator's proposal to examine a specific code on mortgages.  Can the Minister provide a clearer picture as to what that entails?  The vast bulk of expenditure by those in the private and public sectors is on mortgages.  When will the Government introduce some scheme to grant relief to mortgage holders who lose their jobs?  While the current rate of home repossessions is quite low, it can be reasonably assumed that the rate will increase seriously in the next few years.  I would like to get some response from the Minister in that regard. The Taoiseach's statement also referred to tax credits available to companies and exemptions on capital gains tax.  If the exemptions were significantly increased beyond €40,000 it would give a further incentive for people to come into that sector.  The back-to-education allowance should be amended to allow people who are going to become unemployed to avail of educational training, including how to start up their own companies, without losing their entitlements.  We need to be a bit more imaginative.  If we are going to create tax exemptions based on production in the smart economy, one must create incentives for people to get into that sector in the first instance.
16012	SeanSherlock	Labour	13210.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	326	 I asked about tax exemptions, but got no reply.

16017	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	531	 The Minister neglected to mention that before the Common Position was reached, it was proposed to reduce the quantities of pesticides supplied or used by 50%.  That proposal did not take into account the national plant health requirement to have certain substances available.  Similarly, it did not take into consideration the properties of the substances concerned.  Will a list of the specific pesticides that are to be prohibited as a result of the directive, or the Common Position that has been reached, be provided?  The Minister mentioned that people will have to be trained to use pesticides.  Will such training comprise another layer of bureaucracy to be dealt with by landowners and farmers before they can set about their daily business of growing crops?  What is the Irish position on this directive?  I accept that the directive is specifically aimed at protecting human and animal health, which is laudable.  We need to find out, within the remit of Question Time, what impact the directive will have on farmers and landowners.  Will a list of pesticides be prescribed?
16018	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	533	" When Ministers speak about EU legislation, they have a tendency to use words like ""lacuna"".  The Minister's response was somewhat confusing.  I will try to interpret it as best I can when I read the Official Report.  If there is a Common Position and a framework for Community action, there will be a prescribed set of pesticide uses or functions.  Will there be a defined list?  Will pesticide users be required to undertake training?  Does the Minister envisage that this will be implemented within a certain timeframe?  The Minister has said that Ireland had an alliance with Britain and Hungary on this issue, but what position did the three countries take?  Did Ireland abstain when the vote was taken on the final Common Position?  Did Ireland vote against it?"
16019	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	551	 I understand the target set by the EU Commission for the production of biofuels is 10% by 2020.  The European Parliament and its environment committee, which consists of members from across the political divide, voted to scale down the proposed EU-wide target of 10% by 2020 to 4% by 2015.  Notwithstanding the 1,800 hectares of miscanthus planted, to which the Minister of State referred, we have moved from the planting of 137 hectares of energy crops in 2003 to just more than 9,000 hectares in 2007, which represents approximately 0.02% of all agricultural land.  Teagasc has estimated that potentially 75,000 to 100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on food production. Are the targets that have been set realistic?  Is the Government doing enough to encourage farmers to get into the business of growing crops for fuel?  How will the food versus fuel debate impact on Ireland?  What is the Government doing to encourage more farmers to diversify into such production?  Is there a ready market available for fuel crops?
16020	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	553	 I put it to the Minister that it is hardly a bureaucratic target, it is a political target that was reached partly with the agreement of the green movement throughout the European Union.  I do not mean to be facetious when I say that.
16021	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	555	 We are currently at a point where fuel prices have decreased due to the fall in oil prices.   The Government has a tendency to take its foot off the pedal with regard to developing a coherent and long-term policy.  Post CAP reform, there will be an abyss into which many Irish farmers will fall.  There will be significant loss of revenue.  This is one way in which the slack can be taken up.  I put it to the Minister that the Government must come back to the House with a defined Government policy on how farmers can look to the future with regard to alternative energy production and the creation of markets.
16022	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	 The question is whether there will be a loss of money to farmers.  The point of modulation, as the Minister has stated, is to contribute towards environmental measures such as water conservation.  Will the moneys involved be controlled by the Department?  Will they be paid directly to farmers, or will they be paid to other agencies as determined by the Department to administer those schemes?  The point is whether farmers will lose money through the measures that are supposed to be incorporated within modulation.
16023	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	640	 To what extent does the Minister believe that the commodification of dairy products and the fact that they are tradeable commodities has an effect on the markets and on the price of milk for Irish farmers?  This should be taken into account.  Are there discussions at EU level or within the WTO framework to tackle the fact that commodification is causing great vagaries in prices?  That is having an impact on the market here.
16024	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	661	 I anticipate that the Minister of State will spend some time in the air to visit some of the events.  I welcome the fact that there is a significant budget for Bord Bia.  It is money well spent when one thinks of the return.  The €8 billion to €9 billion in food exports will be one of the saviours if this economy is to lift itself out of recession.  The emphasis on food production will be vital in that sense. Has there been a full restoration of the markets in light of the pork dioxin scare?  I refer to the markets prior to 6 December.  As I understand it, we have lost some market share to the UK because of the sterling differential, which is a major factor.  I welcome the Minister of State's answer but we need to step up our efforts in terms of the potential of continental Europe given that we have 33% of exports there currently.  There is a greater potential in continental Europe.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to come back with a reply on that one given the timeframe — it is just by way of a general comment.
16025	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	 We wish to support the motion on the basis that the permutations of the HSE Teamwork-Howarth report for the delivery of care for people in the mid-west will have untold consequences for those who do not live in the region served by Limerick Regional Hospital.  In addressing this motion I wish to speak specifically for the southern region, where the national service plan has been published.  We have also recently received a document from the HSE stating that new efficiencies to the value of €80 million are sought in its operations.  The Teamwork-Howarth report has not been published in the south.  Having read the Fine Gael motion and the prescriptions of the Teamwork-Howarth report for the mid-west, I do not doubt that the delivery of services in the combined Munster region, as espoused in this document, will have a negative effect on hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and Mallow.  While I might be accused of being parochial, it is important to note that the hospital in Mallow is like those in Ennis and Mallow, and to address this as a Munster-wide issue. There has been no politically accountable, coherent analysis of the HSE's proposals.  This is the first time that the House has had an opportunity to properly debate their implications and it is happening on Opposition time.  The Government should make time available to debate the issues adequately so that we can go through the implications of these proposals euro by euro, and hospital by hospital. We have witnessed the erosion by stealth of services at the former county hospital in Mallow.  A CT scanner was put in place a few years ago and became operational last year for approximately ten to 15 hours per week, but now runs for between four and six hours per week.  Last week, we found out that the ear, nose and throat services will be taken away in one fell swoop.  We have also been notified that no children under the age of 16 will be treated within the hospital and that the long-term plan is to replace the accident and emergency unit with a nurse-led minor injuries clinic. The motion notes that between 15 and 30 people are regularly on trolleys for over 24 hours in Limerick Regional Hospital.  If services in Mallow are further reduced the same will apply to Cork University Hospital.  We in the Munster region are arguing for a re-think of the policy.  Clinicians who advise me, and the 120 GPs who serve the hospital, say that there should be no diminution in services in Mallow general hospital until the HSE can guarantee that the services are available in Cork University Hospital.  That is the logic of the argument being applied to Limerick Regional Hospital and to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  There is a complete lack of foresight in the approach to this.  Every time I raise the issue with the upper echelons of the HSE management in the southern region, I meet vague answers and lack of specifics. I do not see how the Minister can dress up the service plan for the southern region as a configuration, or a reconfiguration, because it drives a coach and four through the services being delivered to the catchment areas of Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh.  Those who reside in the catchment areas will have to travel further to get into Cork University Hospital and Limerick Regional which will force more people through a narrow bottleneck.  The services and capacity do not exist within those hospitals.  There is no logic in seeking to further downgrade the satellite hospitals that serve Cork University and Limerick Regional Hospitals.  We want a proper debate on this and I ask that the Government make time available for it.  I appreciate that Fine Gael raised this issue and we support it. How much time do I have left?
16026	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1086	 Why are Fianna Fáil Deputies elected by these constituencies allowing this to happen?  Why do those Deputies constantly move to blame it on the HSE?  Are we to believe that Professor Drumm, by virtue of his management of the HSE, is the de facto Minister for Health and Children?  Is there no voice on the Government backbenches from the Munster region served by the hospitals at Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh that will call a halt to what the HSE is trying to do?  If we proceed with the degradation of services at these hospitals there is no way that hospitals such as Cork University and Limerick Regional will be able to deal with the capacity.  That will have untold consequences. The hospital in Mallow serves over 100,000 people in four counties.  I speak to the staff in Cork University hospital and if one visits it on any given day, one will see that the accident and emergency unit cannot cope with the numbers coming through.  Why would the Government seek to further diminish services to the satellite hospitals? We support the motion and believe that if the Government backbenchers who represent constituencies served by the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and Mallow have any backbone they will support such motions because in that way they will support the people.

The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However, it was decided to prioritise the placement of the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible. The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over €100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country, thereby reducing the demand for prefabs. It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame.

In the case of schools that have over-quota teachers, vacancies do not arise as a result of teachers approved for job-sharing or career break. This position is no different from that pertaining in previous years. In these schools that have over-quota teachers, applications for job-sharing and a career break may be considered by the authorities of the schools concerned in the normal way. Because the school is over its allocation of teachers my department will not give automatic replacements. It is, of course, open to the school authority to apply to my Department for additional teaching hours by way of curricular concessions to cover part or all of the hours in respect of an approved job-sharer/career break teacher. Each such application is considered on its merits.

16050	SeanSherlock	Labour	13236.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	511	" I propose to take ten minutes. The Bill is being presented to us against a backdrop of an announcement today that AIB is to write off €1.8 billion in bad loans for 2008.  The Minister is asking the House to support a Bill that will recapitalise that same bank to the tune of €3.5 billion.  That is laudable but only if it results in provision of credit lines to businesses and borrowers in general. The Labour Party must critically assess the proposals brought before us in the Bill.  As I understand it, €4 billion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund's current resources will be used as part of that recapitalisation, out of the total of €7 billion.  Bearing in mind that the global markets are not touching Irish stocks currently, I wonder whether that is a wise move and whether the methodology the Minister proposes in the Bill is not without its flaws. We are told by the Minister that he has consulted widely with financial and property experts in drafting this Bill.  I would like to know who were those financial and property experts.  I become a little afraid when I hear of Ministers taking the advice of property experts given the culture we have been used to in recent years.  I would like to know the nature of that advice and whether there was an alternative advice to that on which he has based his Bill. For example, what was the alternative advice, if any, on devolving more power to the Minister with regard to directing the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission ""to make investments in such institutions and to underwrite their share issues""?  Such a concentration of power must be questioned and the Minister must tell us whether there is scope for this power to be abused.  It is a theoretical question but in terms of the enactment of a law it is worthy of answer by the Minister in his reply. For instance, if the Minister determines, for political expediency, that an investment should be made in a specific financial institution, and if the NPRF determines that this is contrary to any responsible investment policy, it is powerless to act against such a move.  My understanding is that the responsible investment policy is one of the key components underpinning the governance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Furthermore, investing such powers in the Minister bypasses this House and any scrutiny we may wish to pursue in this regard.  I would like the Minister to address that point when replying to the debate. In his contribution the Minister told us that the State will get a direct return for its investment.  In the current climate, and in the context of AIB's write-down of €1.8 billion today, it is difficult to envisage any return to the taxpayer any time soon.  I understand that if we take the long-term view an alternative view could be argued but the fundamental principle underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund is the responsible investment policy.  That is a stated policy that gives rise to the need to meet the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the years 2025 to 2055. On the face of it, the Bill should, ceteris paribus, yield a return to the Exchequer over a long-term period if a number of assumptions are taken.  If we assume there is no restructuring of the banking regime in this country within that period of time, that is, that no banks will merge or there will be no rationalisation or consolidation of banking, then it is reasonable to assume that the taxpayer will see a return on his or her investment but I question the Minister’s strategy in that regard.  That we invest with the possibility of a return is fair enough but the manner in which the Minister has pitched the proposed return on the investment speaks to me of an ill-thought out strategy that allows the banks to dictate the terms by which they will be recapitalised and not the people, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, whose moneys will be used for this purpose. The Minister proposes to get a preference share with a fixed dividend of 8% or ordinary shares in lieu.  I would like the Minister to explain the reason he is proposing to take preference shares in the first instance instead of ordinary shares.  If the Minister is buying preference shares with a fixed dividend at today's prices, what will be the total yield to the National Pensions Reserve Fund if those shares are bought back by the bank within the five year period?  I understand they have a provision to do so or they are allowed to do so.  It seems to me that the Minister has allowed the banks a provision to buy back shares within the five year period at today's prices. I question the validity of such a strategy and wonder if it would have been more expedient for the taxpayers' money, through the NPRF, to be used to buy ordinary shares.  That would have been a more responsible strategy.  If the two banks report losses within the next five years, what will be the status of the 8% yield on those preferences?  Also, what will happen to the yield?  If there is a return of 8%, where will that yield be invested?  Will it be awarded to the NPRF? I would also like to know what the Minister means, in layman's terms, when he states that he will allow the commission to set up a special purpose investment vehicle.  Notwithstanding that I have a degree in economics, I admit with a degree of humility that I do not have a clue what a special purpose investment vehicle is.  When we are writing legislation in this House, and if we are using taxpayers' money to underpin a strategy of recapitalisation, we must have it set out to us in clear terms what exactly that means.  If the Minister is to be given devolved powers and if we are setting up special purpose investment vehicles, we must know for exactly what purpose they are designed and, if there is a return on such a vehicle, the nature of that return and how those investments will be pitched.  Will they be for philanthropic purposes?  Will they be a sop to our learned friends in the Green Party?  Will there be a sustainable element to those vehicles?  What will be the nature of those vehicles?  The people are entitled to know that and it must be set out clearly in any legislation that is brought before the House. I wish to address some points made by Deputy Gogarty.  I do not mean to be personal in my response to his contribution earlier but I wish to state for the record that I have never taken a bribe or a red cent from any corporate entity, except through a fund-raising race event I held whereby local companies bought in to a race night I ran when I was raising funds to try to get elected to this House.  There is a desire by Deputy Gogarty to impugn certain Members of this House and develop a language that states that we are not credible to critically analyse any measure that comes forth from this Government in respect of any tract of legislation because somehow our respective parties in opposition are dirtied by the fact that they may have taken corporate donations.  I wish to state for the record that I have never taken corporate donations in that sense of the word."

16053	SeanSherlock	Labour	13237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	823	 The financial crisis is due to both external and internal factors, external in that the beliefs we held regarding the behaviour of banks and financial markets as actors in a real economic setting have been challenged like never before.  It must be said that somewhere in the recesses of our minds there was a nebulous idea that the global financial economic structure was based on a false premise but we never realised just how much the Irish banking sector was tied to that false premise.  We are now left with a new rhetoric from the centre left and centre right about the role of the State.  The question for all of us is how to construct a new narrative for the position we are in and a solution for the next generation. This country was over-reliant on tax receipts from stamp duty.  That issue will be analysed until kingdom come and there is nothing that I can bring to that analysis that is new.  The question now is how we get ourselves out of this morass and restore our economic well-being, and what we can do to ensure a sustainable economic and social model into the future. The restoration of the economy must be based on strong Government intervention and co-decision making with our European Union partners.  The Stability and Growth Pact has vanished and the question remains as to what will replace it.  This country is nowhere near a fiscal stimulus plan and all talk of change, President Obama style, is futile.  What we need now is a new definition of the role of markets and the role of the State regarding market behaviour. I am encouraged by the fact that the European Commission published proposals last week that would set up a pan-European regulatory body with strong powers to intervene in national regulation.  Unfortunately, that is a necessary consequence of Ireland's soft attitude in regulating the behaviour of financial institutions.  We await the political outcome of such proposals and I hope the Government will support that initiative.  It is necessary if it is to send a message to global markets that Ireland is getting its house in order.  If the Government is to restore public finances it must also restore confidence.  The restoration of confidence will ensure that investors will once again begin to look at Ireland. Given that we are an open economy, it is vital that our membership of the European Union is seen in a positive light.  I am encouraged by the fact that the EU monetary affairs Commissioner has stated publicly that any country in crisis will receive financial assistance in advance of the International Monetary Fund knocking on our door.  We must be encouraged by those signals.  In terms of the motion before us, we must acknowledge that any Government strategy has to incorporate our European Union partners.  Without them, we are doomed. In putting forward these ideas I am conscious that a new language must emerge, which is one of social solidarity.  This Government has sought to pitch sectional interests against each other.  We need a new language that does not put the private sector against the public sector or the urbanite against the rural dweller.  Any interventions made by Government must be based on equity and on the basis that each bears the pain in accordance with their ability to pay. We all have ideas.  Our membership of this House is based on the notion that we put forward ideas to get elected here.  I suggest we examine the notion of social capital.  Amidst this economic storm there are practical solutions that would put thousands to work if the Government thought more laterally about its policy interventions. Many communities are in need of serious investment in terms of public works that could be carried out at an extra marginal cost but that would yield a massive return in terms of adding to the quality of this country's citizens' lives.  We need a proactive Government intervention at the most basic and community level to ensure our communities can survive. In that light and in light of the fact that in the past six months my colleagues within the Labour Party have put forward some concrete proposals, we wish to work in a positive sense to try to do what we can to get this country up and running again.  Today I spoke with my colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who put forward proposals on the inclusion of certain persons within the tax net.  In the past two weeks or so, we have heard many social commentators speak about the fact that 38% of the population is currently outside the tax net.  If we are talking about a mini-budget in the coming months and if we are talking about changing the tax code or increasing personal taxation, we must take cognisance of the fact that there are large numbers within that 38% bracket who are pensioners and low paid.  If the Government proposes to bring more people into the tax net, it must be on the basis of equity and not on the basis of making sure that those people on marginal or lower incomes are not taxed unfairly.

This school building is planned to come on stream in 2009 and will operate under the patronage of  County Dublin VEC.  Based on current demographic trends, my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils. My Department has been in contact with South Dublin County Council regarding a potential site for future educational provision in the area, and has arranged a technical inspection of the various site options identified by South Dublin County Council.  These options are currently being considered and the Department will be in further contact with South Dublin County Council in the coming weeks regarding the matter.

I will start with a simple question — will the Minister close Mallow General Hospital?  I want a clear ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer from her.  If it is the Minister's intention to keep the hospital open, people want to know the extent of its services in future.  We have been met with nothing but confusion and obfuscation concerning the provision of services in the HSE south region in recent months.  We have had the national service plan 2009, the reconfiguration of hospitals report for the HSE south region, which was also published this year, and we have also had the teamwork report and the Howarth report.  Now we are being told that Professor John Higgins will examine proposals on savings that will be garnered as a result of the cuts to be implemented. The people of the HSE south region want to know what will happen by way of facts, figures and timelines.  We are sick of this culture that exists whereby the only person who will answer publicly for HSE decisions is Professor Drumm.  We want to know why people in the hospital networks office of the HSE south region, and other such high-ranking figures, are not speaking publicly and answering in proper, public fora for the decisions they are taking. There is a positive alternative to the scenario that is currently provided by the HSE south region.  The Minister must listen to GPs who are referring to hospitals like Mallow and Cork University Hospital.  She must listen to people working at the coalface.  If we listened more to doctors and other health professionals and less to the coterie of managerial mandarins, we would be able to effect a proper system that could guarantee health services to the public. With respect to the Minister, I want to know today if she intends to close Mallow General Hospital.  On behalf of that region's taxpayers, I also want to know what future scenario she envisages for the hospital.  We can rotate far more disciplines from Cork University Hospital through to Mallow General Hospital.  In addition, we can enhance the services at Mallow and add value to them.  That case is also being made by health professionals who are operating in that catchment area.  We need proper answers without obfuscation."

I would like a clear ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer.  I understand the Minister replied by stating it would be subject to revised service plans.  In the event that the subject plan does not adhere to standards laid down by the Department, what does she envisage for the future of the hospital?  We need clarity on this once and for all."

An appeal from the school management is under consideration and a decision will  be conveyed in due course. I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September. My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed. The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.

This is the second time in a short period that the Minister has clarified the situation in respect of Mallow General Hospital.  When will the Teamwork report be published?  The reconfiguration document was published on 15 January and laid before the regional health forum.  The document stated that the only services rotated through Mallow General Hospital would be outpatient and obstetrics and gynaecology services and no other services were envisaged.  ENT services are now being cut, which does not tally with the Minister's statement.  Will the Minister further clarify what day procedure services she envisages would rotate through Mallow General Hospital in future?

16065	SeanSherlock	Labour	13265.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-01 00:00:00	Prelude	396	 I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  How did we arrive at a stage in the country's development where thousands of people are on local authority waiting lists yet thousands of houses throughout the land are unoccupied?  When did we, economically and socially speaking, decide that a house would become a tradeable commodity to be used as an instrument for investment primarily and not as a place of refuge or to raise a family?  Until such time as we legislate in this area with people in mind and give up our obsession with the property market we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes.  We have, through this legislation, an opportunity to provide decent housing for all those who need it, if only we can embark on a little lateral thinking. My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, stated that recent figures published showed a massive jump from 43,700 on the social housing waiting lists to nearly 60,000 in just three years.  How did we come to this point when so many houses were being built during this period?  With the right thinking, this legislation provides a golden opportunity to address the imbalance that exists within the social housing sector. The relationship between the Department and the local authorities needs to reflect the realities on the ground.  For instance, in my constituency of Cork East, there is a local authority scheme at Stag Park in Mitchelstown where affordable houses remain unsold and are boarded up.  I have queues out the door of my clinics in Mitchelstown with people on the social housing list who would dearly love to obtain one of these modern, well-appointed and fantastically designed houses.  However, they will remain unsold until such time as the Department frees up the financial obligation of the local authority to the Department with regard to their sale.  The current market conditions dictate that they will remain unsold because they have been boarded up for so long that a certain stigma is attached to them. The Department must become more flexible in its approach.  A house which is designated as an affordable house and which is unsold within a specific period must be allowed to be occupied at the discretion of the local authority if the local authority has made a decent attempt to sell the house.  The Minister of State must examine this.  Countless thousands of affordable houses throughout the State could be used for social housing but this cannot be done because of certain constraints placed upon them. Generally, I am in favour of voluntary housing associations but I have certain reservations about trends that I have seen within this sector.  I am anxious that voluntary housing associations would not supplant the role of the local authority in terms of the provision of social housing.  It is true that they fulfil a need in terms of catering to a certain demographic.  However, I have documented cases and had representations from quite a number of constituents who find that once they occupy a voluntary housing association property, they find they have no recourse to eventual purchase or to an independent arbiter with regard to the conditions of their tenancy.  In one case I encountered, the rent of a couple on a fixed social welfare income was increased substantially by the voluntary housing association and they had no recourse to an independent arbiter when they sought to question the increase.  This issue must be addressed. Irish people will always want to own their own home.  This is ingrained within our psyche.  This trait must inform how we formulate policy.  If one provides a social house it must be on the basis that it will become available for purchase in the medium to long term.  This choice and right must exist even if it is not exercised.  The current tenant purchase scheme is woefully inadequate, in that there would be a golden opportunity to sell off older housing stock if it were discounted at a more favourable rate.  Most local authority houses I visit which have long-term tenancies have so much invested in them by the occupiers that the valuations they get when they seek to purchase the house have no bearing on the original real cost of construction and the amount invested in the intervening period. If one wishes to purchase one's home in the current climate there is a discounted rate but it has become an instrument of the market by virtue of a valuation which must be sought.  This is in spite of the fact that people have built communities around their homes and have ensured the upkeep of the houses for the duration of their tenancies.  If we are to incentivise the ownership of houses we must create better conditions to allow older people to purchase their homes.  There is a net benefit to the State in that it would yield a massive dividend and would provide an opportunity in terms of significantly reducing maintenance costs to local authorities. Section 16 provides that making a draft plan is required.  The country is facing a pensions nightmare for the future.  On several occasions, I recall the Minister for Health and Children reminding us that life expectancy has risen dramatically since the Government came into office.  I question her claim to fame in this respect, but if we are living longer, then any draft plans must be formulated on the basis that housing provision for older people in the future is encapsulated within such plans.  We cannot keep shoving people into nursing homes, and sheltered housing is only part of the solution.  Where a draft plan is formulated on foot of a county development plan, lands must be zoned specifically for housing for the elderly.  There must be some degree of forward planning which must start now to deal with that issue. If people are currently residing in quite large houses, they will want to downsize in the future.  It is probable that there will be a demand for smaller units.  County development plans — by extension, the draft housing plans — must take account of that kind of planning.  We cannot just plan for the next two or three years, but for 20 years hence.  We need a little bit of foresight in that respect.  In my experience, I have found that planning policy units lack the necessary resources to carry out demographic studies of population trends for future housing provision.  The Government must take cognisance of this.  The CSO could be a viable instrument in assisting local authorities in that respect. The rental accommodation scheme with which I am most familiar is in north Cork, and it has been well deployed.  This is the case because the staff have used the scheme to best effect, which is a tribute to people who are using limited resources.  How did we get to a stage where we would use taxpayers' money — approximately €450 million — to pay a rental subsidy to a landlord with a second or third home, to ensure housing provision for people on the housing list?  There is an economic fallacy to that argument.  It defies any kind of logic or common sense.  We need to wean ourselves off this dependence on rent allowance.  There would be no need for a rental accommodation scheme if resources were being allocated to provide houses for people in need.  If we take approximately €450 million per annum, there is a multiplier from that which would adequately provide capital spending for all of the social housing needed.  I am not railing against the scheme as it currently exists, because it has done well in the circumstances in which it operates, but there must be more lateral thinking about how we provide social housing.  That is something that needs to be examined. The over-supply of housing in large parts of the country in the recent past must teach us that the relationship between demand and supply must be a qualitative one and not based on quantity alone.  We must re-jig our thinking in this area.  I wish to speak specifically on antisocial behaviour in this respect.  We had a scheme on Mallow Town Council whereby the council and other sources funded a tenant liaison officer.  Since that officer's contract of employment had to be terminated because there was not adequate funding to meet the need the qualitative relationship between the tenants and the local authority has deteriorated.  The work the person in question carried out on a three year contract was so valuable that the relationship between tenants and the local authority improved dramatically during that period and the incidence of antisocial behaviour reduced dramatically.  One way to deal with antisocial behaviour is to build relationships by ensuring that a tenant liaison officer is appointed under statutory provision in every local authority jurisdiction.  The relationship building process in this instance was done over time and with a very meticulous approach and it yielded results.  That needs to be examined in this Bill. Section 30 states that the housing authority can delegate some or all of its management and control functions in respect of its dwellings to a designated body.  I would like the Minister to expand on that provision.  I have a certain reservation that if we move to cede power to the voluntary housing associations, we would cede exclusive control of social housing policy to non-statutory bodies.  The Minister should speak about this in his response. There is land zoned in Mallow that is owned by the town council, in which a plan for more than 100 houses was formulated.  The entrance to that site is currently no wider than the width of two cars.  There is a lack of joined up thinking where land owned by a council is zoned for local authority housing.  There must be proper access to the site.  The land adjoins a private estate and if one considers the multiplier of 100 houses for cars and traffic movements, then without any rectification of the access, we are storing up difficulties for the future.  We cannot speak about antisocial behaviour or about building communities unless we have proper zoning and proper access to local authority housing sites.  That is something that needs to be addressed as well. For too long, social housing has been a poor relation in long-term planning.  Successive Governments have built houses with the sole aim of getting people off the list.  That in itself is worthwhile, but we have never thought about the implications of crowding hundreds of houses into one area without any thought for the implications of lack of proper space, amenity space and proper access to the sites.  That is why so many problems exist.  There will be a great opportunity presently for the Government to ensure social housing provision in a way that provides for everyone in need of housing.  We must have some foresight in our thinking in that regard.

This restriction applies to every student who already holds a qualification at the same level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained or whether or not funding was previously awarded.  The objective of the student grant schemes is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to postgraduate studies.  There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in the light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.
16067	SeanSherlock	Labour	13271.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Prelude	268	" The statement by the Minister for Finance to the effect that the Government has taken care ""to ensure that the measures are equitable and highly progressive"" is incorrect.  Based on an initial analysis of the figures, today's budget will create a larger demographic sector of the working poor.  When the income levies and health levy are factored in as well as the fact that most people working in the private sector have had to endure pay cuts across the board, the real income they will be left with will be so marginal that it will not enable them to have an adequate standard of living.  We all appreciate that measures had to be taken.  However, they should have been taken on the basis that they would not be regressive.  There is now a large demographic cohort of ordinary working families who will be devastated financially by the proposals within this document. With regard to income tax, we were always told that the canons of taxation dictated it should be progressive.  I do not see anything in the budget that ensures high net worth individuals will pay a proportionate amount of their incomes towards getting us out of the mess we are in.  I do not see why the Minister for Finance could not have introduced a higher tax rate at this time so as to cushion the blow against middle and low income earners.  It is completely regressive and when people wake up to the fact of what this document contains, it will make them even more angry at the Government than they already are.  That is why I will not support this resolution."

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

16072	SeanSherlock	Labour	13286.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	457	" Was it not a very cynical move to introduce such a measure at this time of the year, knowing it would not affect people until the winter?  It speaks volumes about how this Government treats older people that it did not have the guts to try this in December, during normal budgetary times, because if those who marched when the Government tried to take medical cards from the over-70s numbered thousands, they would be out in their hundreds of thousands during December. We now live in a society with a breakdown in the intergenerational solidarity that always sustained the communities in this country.  That a Government would take away an economic measure that gives comfort to older people, at a time when people spend extra on their families and themselves, was miserly and unbelievable.  No Fianna Fáil leader, such as Lemass or de Valera, would have countenanced such a move during their tenures.  It is a measure of how far right this Government has moved in distancing itself from the very people who would ordinarily have supported it. The philosopher Bertrand Russell stated, ""To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future"".  This Government is increasingly isolating our older people, taking measures that are dumping people in nursing homes who cannot get nursing home subvention, putting older people into penury in respect of how they pay for care in their autumn and winter years and now the Government is taking away a measure that gave some small assistance to see them through the winter months. Those who I represent are not upper middle class people living in urban conurbations.  They are living in rural areas, in older housing stock, have modest pensions and must have the fire lighting all day every day to keep the back boiler going to run the radiators to ensure there is heat in the house.  By reducing this payment, the Minister is telling us these people can pay for their heating costs but when they go to the community welfare officer to ask for a supplementary payment they will not be given it.  They would ordinarily have used the bonus to pay for the extra bag of coal or other such simple measures that sustained them through the hard winter months.  I ask the Minister to think of the intergenerational solidarity we always had in this country, the social solidarity to which previous Fianna Fáil Governments adhered, and I ask her to reverse this miserly, mean measure.  To introduce it at this time of the year, when it is not so high on the political agenda, is a cynical move.  It is symptomatic of the cynical politics that inhabit this country."
16073	SeanSherlock	Labour	13286.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	704	 I represent a rural constituency where many people live in isolated areas and this scheme allowed them to have the peace of mind and feeling of security brought about by having a monitored alarm system.  Their relatives were also reassured by the scheme.  I do not understand, therefore, why the scheme is being suspended.  I hope the Minister will be true to his word when he says it will be reinstated in September. This signifies a further erosion of services, particularly for older people.  Tonight we debated the loss of the Christmas bonus for pensioners and we all remember the fiasco of the medical cards for the over 70s.  Now many older people who live independently in isolated areas no longer feel safe as a result of the loss of this scheme. It also gives a certain degree of comfort to people who might embark on robberies in rural areas.  People are now storing money at home and older people have always had a tendency to do so.  The reduction in home help hours means there are fewer callers to people in rural areas, so the lack of monitored alarms will have an effect.  In the Fermoy area of my constituency of Cork East, 51 monitored alarms were distributed since January.  A further 28 older people were on the waiting list.  They will now have to pay approximately €300 from their pension to get an alarm. According to Irish Rural Link, Muintir na Tire and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the scheme costs approximately €3 million but €2.4 million of that is recouped through VAT paid to the Exchequer.  It is a worthwhile scheme and I ask the Minister to reinstate it.

16077	SeanSherlock	Labour	13293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	336	" I welcome the publication of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pat Rabbitte in introducing the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill, which I believe is the forerunner to the legislation before the House today.  I also acknowledge the very helpful document published by the Oireachtas Library and Research service, which was an invaluable source for me, in particular, in seeking to interpret the legislation. The basis on which we would support the legislation is the morass that exists in Irish society today.  This is exemplified by the spate of ruthless killings we have borne witness to over a number of years.  The question outside these walls is whether the tipping point has been reached — and whether this legislative proposal will facilitate that tipping point to restore some semblance of peace, again, on our streets.  We were previously told that the murder of Veronica Guerin was the turning point in the context of gangland killings.  That point came and went and now we are being told that the murder of Shane Geoghegan in Limerick is the turning point.  I hope it is, and I continue to hope that this legislation, while it will not be a panacea, will facilitate a process that will allow the Garda Síochána to have the necessary tools to allow it to carry out its work in this regard. As Deputy Rabbitte has said recently, in outlining the Labour Party position on this, the fundamental question is whether the response by way of legislation is reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.  I believe that it is and that the Garda must be given powers to respond in a manner that facilitates a preventative mechanism.  The powers within this legislation, on first reading, would deem that to be the case.  I am encouraged, also, by the statement on 17 April by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which gave a cautious welcome to the Bill.  Its statement said that intelligence-led policing and not the restriction of fair trial rights was the most effective way to tackle gangland crime.  I refer specifically to Mr. Mark Kelly, the ICCL's director who stated that the Bill would at last place Garda surveillance on a lawful basis that broadly conforms to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  He went on to say that the need for judicial authorisation of most forms of surveillance was welcome.  However, it remained unclear why it was felt unacceptable to allow tracking devices to be placed on people's vehicles on Garda authority alone. While the ICCL has reservations, I am sure many of them can be worked through on the later Stages of the Bill.  Mr. Kelly said that in the interests of protection of privacy, the ICCL was urging the Minister to publicly disclose before the Bill becomes law the proposed content of the regulations foreseen in section 8(2) in order to ensure that there will be a human rights framework for the use by gardaí of tracking devices.  I understand that Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier that this would also be teased out on later Stages.  However, I welcome the ICCL's support while appreciating its concerns in relation to Article 8 under the European Convention of Human Rights 2003, and the recognition of the need to ensure that the right to a fair trial is maintained, or not compromised in any way. I hope that putting into effect an explicit statutory provision in relation to surveillance will assuage any fears regarding the rights of an individual and the need to reduce crime.  I believe that ICCL support for this, while qualified, is significant.  My interpretation of this support is that there is no danger such an Act would contravene Article 40.3 of the Constitution in term of the personal rights of the citizen.  Such Article 40.3 rights are germane to the tipping point or the turning point I spoke of earlier.  What Shane Geoghegan's murder teaches us is that at some crucial point the personal rights of a citizen must not be unqualified.  That is to say, they are not absolute.  If we are to pursue his killers and those of others, then the constitutional rights of some must be subservient to the common good, and as the late Mr. Justice Hamilton previously stated, subject to the requirements of public order and morality. I believe that is what this legislation is about.  It is about ensuring that we can reach a stage where a person's personal rights are vindicated but that the common good and the desire for the rule of law is maintained or restored within this country.  We need to get to a point where we can have some confidence that the powers the Garda have will be used to such an extent. If I was never involved in the legislative process, I would still take the view that it is necessary for the Garda to have such powers to enable it to carry out its functions.  That this Bill will provide a statutory framework for carrying out such surveillance by gardaí and others is the right approach at this time.  In fact, it is overdue and if the gardaí are not given such powers, then the morass that this society finds itself in, which incorporates the slaughter of innocents, will continue and go unpunished in some cases. In addressing the specific provisions of the Bill, there are a number of questions to which I seek answers.  Section 5 provides that ""an authorisation may be madeex parte  and shall be heard otherwise than in public”.  I hope that the power to seek authorisation for surveillance in such circumstances is balanced against the power of the judge to grant a specific authorisation.  If I interpret that provision correctly, there is no onus on the superior officer to state a particular offence and I hope that this power will be used wisely.  However, I am satisfied the specifications in regard to the authorisation leave no grounds for a potential abuse of power. Section 5 outlines that where an authorisation is sought, there are specifics in regard to the particulars of the surveillance device authorised to be used, the person who or the place or thing to be the subject of the surveillance, the name of the superior officer to whom it is issued, the conditions subject to which the authorisation is issued and the date of expiry.  It is necessary that there are specific provisions within that authorisation which will ensure there is no vagueness about the authorisation and, therefore, it will not be potentially open to abuse.  I welcome that provision in regard to the authorisation and I hope it will be stringently adhered to when implemented. In regard to sections 5 and 6, where an authorisation is sought, it may authorise the superior officer named in it or any member of the Garda Síochána, member of the Defence Forces or officer of the Revenue Commissioners designated by that superior officer.  There is a provision where a superior officer may seek the authorisation but that any other member of the Garda Síochána can also be subject to that authorisation.  If another garda who is not a superior officer is subject to that provision, is he or she named in it? If we are to grant new powers of surveillance, will there be specific training or will resources be allocated to train junior officers under the legislation?  If the legislation is to work, it must be on the basis that every officer, whether in the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces, is given specific training which will ensure there is no scope to challenge the provisions of the legislation thereafter where criminal proceedings are brought.  Will the Minister address that in his reply? I refer to section 8.  What does the Minister interpret as a ""tracking device""?  I have watched many cop shows and we all know what a tracking device is.  In practical terms, how will this play out?  I know it provides for specific vehicles to be tracked.  I would like to hear the Minister's take on that section when he responds to the debate. I refer to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the powers vested in section 11.  There is a complaints procedure in the legislation which states specifically that recommendations can be made and that a matter can be reported to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  What are the powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in regard to the legislation?  There is a reporting procedure but is there a power of intervention or recommendation which must be acted upon where a complaint is made? I understand the provision in regard to the power of a Circuit Court judge and the complaints referee.  That is very clear.  However, the powers in regard to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are unclear to me and I would like a more specific interpretation of that. I hope from a societal point of view, that we have reached a tipping point where we can now restore some semblance of peace on our streets and that once this legislation is enacted, there will be a pressure on people who have acted with impunity which will stymie their activities and put them out of business for a long time to come.  It is necessary to enact this legislation and in that sense, I welcome it.  It will not provide a panacea for all our ills but it will provide the start of a real process which will restore some semblance of peace."
16078	SeanSherlock	Labour	13293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	336	 The animal health problems on the farm referred to by Deputy White have been ongoing for several years and relate mainly to ill-thrift and stunted growth of cattle on the farm in addition to reduced milk yield.  I thank Deputy White for her tenacious determination to pursue this investigation in recent years on behalf of Mr. Dan Brennan, his family and the wider community of Castlecomer.  The farm in question, which I have visited, has been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years.  Since late 2006 it has been the subject of further thorough and comprehensive investigations by the Department's centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis, CVERA, based at University College Dublin.  A high degree of inter-agency involvement and co-operation has been a feature of the investigations.  The agencies involved have included the EPA, Kilkenny County Council, Teagasc, the HSE — previously, the South Eastern Health Board was involved — and my Department. In 2004, my Department's veterinary laboratory service arranged for a wide-ranging study to be undertaken into the problems on the farm, following which a report was produced in June 2006.  The report documented the range of the investigations, the methodology involved and the results of different aspects.  The farmer involved had certain difficulties with some aspects of the report and, at his request, the report was not published. As part of the inter-agency investigation, several reports, in addition to my Department's 2006 report, were produced.  These included the UCC report of 2006 commissioned by the EPA entitled, An Impact Assessment on Epiphytic Lichens; the Ambient Air Quality Survey report of 5 May 2006; the John J Gardiner report, entitled Condition of Trees on the Farm of December 2005; and the EPA summary report of the work completed by the EPA as part of the multi-agency investigation of animal health in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny of September 2006. Apart from these reports my Department and others have also been involved in several initiatives on this farm.  For example, a herd health programme was developed by the farmer's private veterinary practitioner and supported by my Department, to deal with respiratory disease in calves and mastitis in cows.  The Department also funded treatment for mastitis, a vaccination programme, the provision of calf hutches to segregate the calves from each other and feeding trials.  Other initiatives included a grassland management plan, monitoring growth of calves at grass and checking sources of water to the farm. Following finalisation of the Department's veterinary laboratory service report in 2006, the then Minister met a delegation of interests, including the farmer, in July 2006 and confirmed that the authorities were more than willing to pursue the investigation further and to seek to get to the root of the problems on the farm.  The Minister also met with the director of the EPA to discuss a report it had produced on the environmental impact of emissions.  Arising from this process, in 2006 the then Minister asked the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis to conduct a further thorough and comprehensive study. The centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis study is designed to complement the work to date and used some different approaches to investigate the production problems on the farm.  The study entails a major sampling and testing programme, including investigation of various metabolic pathways, as well as epidemiological studies.  In addition, a comprehensive and detailed soil survey is included in the remit of the study.  A draft report arising from this work has now been sent for peer review and when this is completed the report will be finalised and published. The article in theKilkenny People refers to a report.  However, I am not aware to which document the newspaper refers and I trust the Deputy would agree, therefore, that it is inappropriate for me to comment in detail upon it.  I emphasise that my Department and I, along with the other agencies involved, are determined to establish the underlying cause of the problems on this farm.  It is inappropriate at this stage to make any further comment on the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis investigation until the report is finalised and published, which will take place shortly.
16079	SeanSherlock	Labour	13308.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-14 00:00:00	Prelude	173	" We broadly welcome the legislation, which is long overdue, and wonder why the draft Bill from 2007 has not been introduced before now.  However, it is now before us.  It is ludicrous that a significant number of people are incarcerated on the basis that they are unable to pay fines.  It is expeditious and proper that the State put in place a system to allow people to pay their fines by instalment or other means, thus negating the need to go to prison.  The case was already made by my colleague in Fine Gael that the problems that persist in prisons as a result of overcrowding are in no small way attributable to the fact that people are in prison due to non-payment of fines.  This is leading to an undue burden on the State and must be rectified. There was a previous judgment in this regard. I believe it was Mr. Justice Henchy who stated that in no circumstances should a court impose imprisonment as an alternative to a fine solely on the grounds that the defendant could not afford to pay the fine considered by the court to be appropriate.  Imprisonment is the most serious punishment, and if it is not appropriate because the case is not sufficiently serious, a fine should be imposed as a lesser penalty.  If the defendant cannot afford an appropriate fine, the amount should be lowered, and if he or she cannot afford any fine, imprisonment should not be considered as an alternative solely on the grounds that the fine cannot be paid.  This is an important point.  According to that judgment, it is better for someone to walk free without punishment rather than be punished by imprisonment just because he or she has no money to pay a fine.  Otherwise we are imprisoning people on grounds of poverty rather than according to the seriousness of the offences they commit.  This legislation will facilitate a process whereby those people who are unable to pay their fines in one fell swoop will be able to pay by instalments.  This results in greater equity in that somebody who is convicted of a crime but is not a criminal in the classic sense of the word now has an opportunity to pay the fine in smaller instalments, which is to be welcomed. I do not understand why, when the Law Reform Commission introduces recommendations — which in this instance date back to 1991 — the legislature does not come forward with proposals in a more timely fashion to rectify matters or make the law better.  This Bill was first published in 2007 and the Law Reform Commission has been speaking on this issue since 1991.  Any functioning democracy should have within its remit the ability to enact laws in a timely fashion.  If one considers the cost factor alone, based on the number of people who have served prison sentences for non-payment of fines, we could have saved the State countless thousands of euro if better legislation had been introduced earlier.  The Law Reform Commission, from any document I have seen, has been far-reaching in its approach to these issues.  This is a matter that needs to be addressed. I do not think it is fair that the limit above which instalments can be paid is €100.  This limit should be removed so that fines of less than €100 can be also paid in instalments.  There are many people out there who survive on subsistence wages or rely solely on income from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and to whom literally every penny counts.  To those people a fine of as little as €50 would be a considerable burden. Provision should be made in the Bill so that a fine of less than €100 can be paid by instalment.  Daily, I deal with people who find themselves in difficulty over the non-payment of refuse charges, for example.  Local authorities have systems whereby €5 per week could be paid.  In many such instances, the outstanding debt could be as little as €70 or €80.  The same type of principle should apply to this provision, a matter I hope can be addressed. The legislation's net effect should be to reduce the number of impecunious offenders being sentenced to imprisonment.  There should be careful monitoring of sentencing practices across the board to ensure the objective is achieved.  For this reason, the Bill should provide for some form of statistical analysis whereby its net effect can be quantitatively and qualitatively measured in order that we can see the knock-on effect in terms of any reduction in the number of people presenting to prison and the success or otherwise of the legislation as enacted.  If the legislation is updated in future, it is important that there be a statistical analysis.  In this context, the Courts Service would be an important actor. I refer to the Bills Digest.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service issued a good document from which it is worth quoting.  It states: A problem inherent in a system of penalties based on fines is the changing value of money over time.  This can deprive a fine of its punitive nature and reduce its deterrent effect. In terms of indexation, the Schedules are clearly set out in section 2, but we will submit some amendments that will be of a semantic nature as opposed to a substantive one.  A good job has been done in the legislation's drafting in terms of the changing monetary effect that will persist in future.  This is welcome. The issue of a statement of means should be addressed.  If someone presents himself or herself before the court and claims an inability to pay a fine despite possessing sound financial means, by what mechanism can the judge determine whether the person has the ability to pay?  While there is provision in the legislation, should it be more prescriptive?  As mentioned by the Minister of State, section 13 creates an offence of knowingly or recklessly making a statement ""that is false or misleading in any material respect to a court conducting an inquiry into a person's financial circumstances"".  Should the section be more prescriptive in seeking a statement of means by the convicted person to prevent those with means from claiming otherwise?  As there is scope for someone to misrepresent his or her position to the court, it might be desirable that a statement of means be sworn by the offender who is seeking an abatement of the fine by reason of his or her circumstances. Two issues are not provided for in the Bill, to which the Minister of State might respond.  Under the Bill, could judges be trained to analyse the types of scenario that appear before them and to work with the Courts Service to ensure efficiency is built into the system?  There seems to be no specific provision regarding revenue offences.  Is there such a provision? I do not wish to repeat the points made by my colleague in Fine Gael, although I could.  I would like to see specific issues addressed.  The Labour Party is broadly in favour of the Bill and strongly believes that it is high time to reduce the numbers presenting to prisons for, in many instances, being unable to pay fines.  It is proper that legislation be introduced to prevent such occurrences.  The Government must take into account the fact that many people find it difficult to pay fines of less than even €100.  We also believe that, since some people might try to misrepresent their true financial positions before judges, the Bill should have a prescriptive provision vis-à-vis the presentation of a statement of means.  Judges should be trained on the Bill’s mechanisms and its effect should be monitored by the Courts Service to ensure its intended impact because only by means of a statistical analysis can we measure the Bill’s true impact."
