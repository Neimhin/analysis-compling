9648	SeanSherlock	Labour	17604.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-02-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 I thank the Minister and all of the members for their co-operation. It is really difficult when we have to fit everything into two hours. Deputy John Paul Phelan wanted to contribute but, unfortunately, a member needs to be within the Leinster House complex to contribute to public sessions. I thank all the officials for attending. Is it agreed to publish the opening statement on the Oireachtas website? Agreed.

I thank the witnesses for coming before us. I will put my questions to the witnesses in a rapid-fire way. The questions are short, and I hope to get short answers as I only have seven minutes. Has there been a discussion internally on the ethical basis on which the SOP has been devised and has anybody within the HSE or academia raised issues about it? My first question is for Dr. Morgan.
9650	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Engagement with Health Service Executive	28	 So how would the witnesses characterise the statement that this new SOP is merely a defensive process for legal reasons? Perhaps Dr. Morgan might want to take that question. The implication is that the system was devised using approximately €7.8 million purely for legal reasons to offset the risk of legal action against the HSE downstream.
9651	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Engagement with Health Service Executive	30	 I accept the answer. Regarding community child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the setting up of interdisciplinary teams, I tabled Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 2 December 2020 asking the Minister for Health for the reasons for the delay in all interventions for children under the age of 18 years of age. The subsequent HSE response to me of 17 December was that in respect of community CAMHS services, the waiting times for young people to be seen by the child and adolescent mental health services continue to be an issue in a number of CHOs. It stated that a renewed focus on improving capacity and throughput was in place in this area and some improvement was being shown. I cannot say that is the case in CHO 4. Dr. Morgan spoke about silos previously. In the very short time available, if we are talking about knocking down silos, then CAMHS needs to be put under the microscope. He can correct me if I am wrong, but my perception is that CAMHS operates as a silo and until that silo is smashed and there is a greater interdisciplinarity about the way in which teams operate at a community level then we are not going to see the throughput in respect of the therapeutic effects based on the assessments of need. Is that a fair characterisation of CAMHS now in terms of the challenges faced?
9652	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Engagement with Health Service Executive	32	 How am I on time, Chairman?
9653	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Engagement with Health Service Executive	34	 Parliamentary questions are the limited power Deputies have in respect of getting answers. To be fair to the HSE, I always receive comprehensive replies to my questions. I submitted a parliamentary question in September 2020, which sought the numbers on the initial assessment nationally. The figure that came back was 13,273. I tabled the same question in December and the same cohort had risen to 16,466. That is a 24% increase on the numbers nationally waiting for initial assessment. The HSE has mapped in €7.8 million but in real terms, the waiting lists are increasing. That is fact; it is based on the HSE's own figures. In CHO 4, covering Kerry and Cork, the number of children awaiting initial assessment rose from 930 in September to 1,436 in December. I tabled two questions, one in September and one in December. The numbers in CHO 4 indicate 242 additional people are awaiting assessment. Nationally, the number waiting for an initial intervention has increased by 7%. Even if Dr. Morgan is talking about changes to community teams – we take what he is saying in good faith – in real time, the real figures show there is still an exponential increase in the waiting lists. Notwithstanding the amount of money that has been mapped onto this and the entirety of the budget, the figures show me that it is still difficult to keep pace with demand. That is something that must be addressed. I am sure I am out of time but I will make a final point and Dr. Morgan can come back to me later. I wish to raise the issue of deaf schools, in particular the fact that site-specialised speech and language therapy services are being taken away from deaf schools at present. That is wrong and it needs to be revised. They are people who always had a service within those schools and it seems now that it is being excised out of the system by the centralisation of services under the progressing disability services strategy. I ask that the decision would please be revised, in particular as it relates to deaf schools throughout the country.
9654	SeanSherlock	Labour	17618.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-02 00:00:00	Children's Unmet Needs: Engagement with Health Service Executive	65	 I welcome this process and see it as being part of an ongoing process of communication with the HSE and Dr. Morgan and the team so I welcome most of the responses. It gives rise to further questions but we will interrogate them in due course. The €7.8 million is still hanging out there for me. I received a reply to a parliamentary question dated 22 December from Dr. Morgan in respect of the breakdown of the €7.8 million. I use CHO 4 because it is the area with which I am most familiar but it is representative of many CHOs. He stated that assessments of need completed went from 29 in September 2020 to 69 in October and 257 in November. This is a massive jump. What I wanted to find out was the breakdown of the costs. How was that €7.8 million distributed? I did not get a sufficient answer to that answer. I ask him to revisit Question No. 422 of 10 December 2020, and come back to me again.

9661	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	 I am taken with the submissions we have received today because it has shed new light on this legislation and has allowed me to think more critically about the flaws inherent in the legislation. We, collectively and in a non-partisan way, need to find some mechanism to come together to ensure that this is a robust piece of legislation and that it deals with all of the issues that have been put before us today by the esteemed persons who have come before us and given of their time. I want to pose one question to Professor Scraton or Dr. O'Rourke in respect of the transitional justice model, and this is something Ms Lohan has also raised, in particular in regard to the issue of accountability, truth telling, reparations and reform in a transitional justice model. It seems to me that it is not inherent or present within the legislation as it is constituted. We are talking today about finding a model that speaks to the bereaved families. To me, there is a model that could be used, and that is the Stormont House Agreement, where there was an historical investigations unit, an independent commission on informational retrieval, an oral history archive and an implementation and reconciliation group. I wonder if some of those ideas could be inculcated into this legislation to deal with the issues of local knowledge, so there is information gathering, retrieval and processing so as to build a more complete picture for everybody. That is the first question. The second question relates again to Professor Scraton. As we heard in the opening remarks: The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinternment on the one hand and the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when he or she died, where he or she died and, most important, how he or she died. Will Professor Scraton elaborate on that? It seems to me that he and Dr. O’Rourke are saying that if we proceed with the legislation as it is constituted at present, we are potentially in breach of Article 2 of the EHCR. What I do not want, as one legislator, is to be in breach of any articles that deny people their natural rights. That is all I will say.
9662	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	110	 I thank Professor Murphy. In terms of how this legislation is constituted or drafted at present, how would Professor Murphy propose to deal with the issue of transitional justice? Transitional justice is a common theme running through every submission we have considered so far today, and I now have an honest understanding of what transitional justice is. How would Professor Murphy inculcate that into the legislation properly to vindicate the rights of those who should have the right to know what happened to their loved ones?
9663	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	112	 May I come in there, please, Chairman? I am aware the time is short and I thank Professor Murphy. In conclusion, and to ensure I adhere to the time constraints, I ask if the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is advocating for a separate process inculcated within the legislation but a separate or independent process that would find truth and speak to all of the issues that the professor has just spoken to there.
9664	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	 I thank the Vice Chairman.
9665	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	 I thank Ms Ansbro and Ms Carthy for coming before the committee. We are again seeing a consistent message from everyone who has submitted to the committee in respect of the flaws inherent within the legislation. It seems it has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese and considerable work will have to be done to amend it to make it fit for purpose. It is encouraging to hear so many Government representatives on the committee, as well as Opposition members, coming together in what I interpret as one voice in respect of the need to amend the legislation. Returning to the coronial process, there has been consistency in respect of the messages we heard from everyone from Ms Lohan to Professor Scraton and Dr. O'Rourke. Everybody has consistently said that this legislation could put us at variance with our Article 2 obligations. Does Ms Ansbro or the ICCL have a view on the coronial process as it is constituted and on whether the legislation as drafted deals sufficiently with the Article 2 provisions? Does either the legislation relating to the coronial process or the legislation we are discussing need to be amended to take account of the statement by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the effect that mass graves are crime scenes? There is no ambiguity in what Ms Ansbro said or in what the UN rapporteur says and, therefore, there should be no ambiguity in regard to how the legislation should be constituted to deal with the rights of those who are interred in those graves, how they came to be there and what the causes were. I am trying to get a continuing sense of understanding of where the ICCL sits in respect of the current coronial system and whether Ms Ansbro agrees with statements made by other people who have submitted to the committee in respect of the Article 2 provisions. Do we need amended coronial jurisprudence or legislation, or should we buttress this legislation further?

9667	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	 May I make a very short intervention, with the permission of the Vice Chairman? I think I was well within the three-minute limit in my first contribution. I am only asking for 30 seconds here and, furthermore, some members have had-----
9668	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	 I appreciate the forbearance of the Vice Chairman. The question on which I am conflicted relates to the rights of those people who wish to be memorialised versus the law of the land, as it were, where in unnatural circumstances, the coronial process kicks in. How do we balance the rights of those people who want to memorialise sites such as Bessborough, for instance, and establish whether that wish is superseded by the law of the land?
9669	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	216	 If any members or witnesses participating remotely are experiencing any sound or technical issues, will they let us know through the chat function? Otherwise, I will proceed. I think we are okay. We have received apologies from Senator Keogan. Before I begin, I remind Members participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak. When they are speaking, I ask where possible that they have their cameras switched on and be mindful that we are in public session. In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public hearings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she does not adhere to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in this meeting from outside the precincts will be refused. We will continue our deliberations. We are considering pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of a certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill. I wish to inform members and witnesses present that, due to unforeseen circumstances, Ms Terri Higgins has had to send her apologies as she is unable to attend the meeting. The witnesses in attendance in the Dáil Chamber are as follows: Mr. Kevin Higgins, spokesperson for Tuam Home Survivors Network, who is joined by Mr. Peter Mulryan, chairman of Tuam Home Survivors Network; and Mr. Martin Parfrey, representing Know My Own. Witnesses appearing virtually before the committee from a location outside of the Leinster House precinct are as follows: Mr. David Dodd, BL, representing the Cork Survivors & Supporters Alliance, who is joined by Mr. Stephen Kirwan, solicitor at KOD Lyons. They are all very welcome to our meeting on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme. Before we commence this session, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the witnesses for taking the time to prepare their opening statements and to thank those of them who provided written submissions. I also wish to take the opportunity to set out the purpose of today's meeting and how proceedings will be conducted in order to avoid any confusion during the meeting. While acknowledging the harrowing experiences of survivors during their time in mother and baby homes and county homes, the purpose of our meeting today is to consider the policy provisions of the proposed legislation. A discussion will take place on the provisions of the general scheme as they relate to the statutory basis and framework under which the Government may decide to authorise interventions at certain sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place associated with institutions operated by or on behalf of the State, or in respect of which the State had clear regulatory or supervisory responsibilities. There are also provisions for the establishment of an agency to carry out such interventions. I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to adhere strictly to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today. I also advise witnesses that the opening statements they read into the record should be the statements they provided in advance of this meeting. Any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair. We are all very much aware of the restrictions Covid-19 has brought to all our lives. It has also severely impacted the scheduling of public committee meetings. However, members of the committee felt it important to hear from some of those who may be impacted by or have a professional view on the provisions of the general scheme. It is the responsibility of parliamentary committees to consider and discuss topics in a balanced and fair manner. In achieving this goal it is the committee, and only the committee, which determines the witnesses it engages with and it will do so in an unhindered manner. This level of engagement will greatly assist the members of the committee in finalising our scrutiny report on the general scheme. For this reason, and while strictly adhering to Covid-19 safety requirements, four public meetings of the committee have been scheduled over the course of today. It is also expected that further public meetings will be scheduled in the near future to consider this matter further. The committee wishes to have a productive public engagement. However, I must remind witnesses that they should not mention names of individuals and organisations, even if that information is already in the public domain nor should they make charges against anyone by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable. These are normal parliamentary procedures and exist to ensure that engagements are conducted in a constructive way. Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will read out the standard text regarding the provisions of the Defamation Act to remind them of their rights and obligations. I want to take a minute to brief the witnesses on the work of the committee since the publication of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and the pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee to date on the general scheme under scrutiny here today. While the committee has been limited in the number of public meetings held due to Covid-19 restrictions, it has afforded priority in its consideration of the following: the scrutiny of this proposed Bill; the issues that have arisen following the publication of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and the desire of members of the committee to ensure justice for the survivors of mother and baby homes. These matters have been discussed at eight of the nine meetings of the joint committee held this year. The committee has corresponded with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on five occasions in relation to various matters and has met with the Minister and his officials to discuss these issues wherever possible. The committee has prioritised these issues above the other competing demands of its vast work programme, insofar as it reasonably can. It stands ready to help to facilitate delivery of the recommendations and actions contained in the report into mother and baby homes however possible, and to undertake robust scrutiny of any and all related legislation referred, such as the general scheme under discussion here today. A public call for submissions on the general scheme opened on 22 January with a deadline of 19 February. This was later extended to 26 February. Every effort was made to ensure maximum reach and accessibility during this process. In total, the committee received 426 submissions. The committee has also had substantial standalone correspondence from the public on these issues and appreciates the engagement and effort the public have made to date on what are difficult issues. I wish to highlight some of the support services available to anyone affected by the matters under discussion today. The HSE has a dedicated counselling service for former residents of mother and baby homes. For more information on this people can call 1800 817 517 or visit the HSE webpage. The Samaritans are available by telephone at 116123 and further supports can be found at yourmentalhealth.ie. I am obliged to give the following advice on parliamentary privilege. For the witnesses present in the Dáil Chamber the following will apply: witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. Witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Acting Chair to ensure it is not abused. If a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks. It is imperative any such direction is complied with. For witnesses appearing virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to evidence given from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House. Therefore, if a witness is directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction. I call on the witnesses in the following order: Mr. Higgins, Mr. Parfrey and Mr. Dodd.
9670	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	218	 I remind Mr. Higgins that he has three minutes and 32 seconds left----
9671	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	220	 I respectfully suggest Mr. Higgins read his submission or not. He is here and the most important thing-----
9672	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	222	 I ask Mr. Higgins, with respect, to continue. We have the legitimacy of the Dáil and the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider this matter and I am satisfied that we are considering it intra vires.
9673	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	227	 I inform Mr. Dodd that he has gone over his allocated time. We will deal with the rest of his submission through questions and answers if that is okay.
9674	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	229	 Before advising members of their speaking allocation, I advise all witnesses that it is the decision of members as to the questions they wish to ask and the witness they wish to respond to their questions. Each member will be allocated five minutes. I ask members to ensure they leave adequate time to allow witnesses to respond to those questions. As members are attending the meeting virtually from their offices and cannot see a clock to monitor the speaking time, I will advise them when they have one minute remaining. I ask members to adhere strictly to time allocations to facilitate all members participating in the meeting. I ask them to confirm their location when making interventions so as to ensure they are here in Leinster House. I will call on members to speak in the order agreed at the meeting of 30 March. Senator Seery Kearney is first.
9675	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	232	 Thank you. I am anxious to ensure that everybody gets in.
9676	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	235	 No, I making a ruling on this. We are going to stick to our guns. The next person on the list is Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor. That is the way we have done it all morning and I think we should stick to that rule, if that is okay. The Senator will have an opportunity to come back in.
9677	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	237	 I thank the Deputy. There are no specific questions directed to any of our witnesses in the Deputy's contribution.
9678	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	239	 There is a question for Mr. Parfrey on the issue of DNA. Perhaps the Deputy might repeat the question briefly, please.
9679	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	259	 I am anxious to ensure that we get through the first round of questions in good time to enable us to devote as much time as possible in the second round to follow-up questions. As Deputies Costello and Cathal Crowe are not online, I invite Senator Ruane to put her questions to the witnesses.
9680	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	270	 We are now coming up to 4 o'clock. Deputy Ward's slot is followed by Senator McGreehan's, Deputy Phelan's and mine. I am happy to forgo my slot to the Chairman, Deputy Funchion. We will have an hour to get through the rest of the speakers. We will stick to five-minute slots until we get through the first run of speakers. We will then have sufficient time to have a good, wide-ranging discussion. Does Deputy Ward wish his question to be directed to the four witnesses or the three witnesses here?
9681	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	272	 Can Deputy Ward repeat the question?
9682	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	276	 I am conscious of time.
9683	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	279	 Thank you, Mr. Mulryan. Senator Keogan has sent her apologies.
9684	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	282	 I thank Mr. Dodd. I am going to move on. I understand Senator Dolan is present as well. I will give her the floor in lieu of Deputy Phelan. She has five minutes.
9685	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	286	 I thank the Senator and I thank Mr. Mulryan again. I call Deputy Funchion.
9686	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	288	 I want to notify people that we are back in broadcast mode again. I understand that we lost it for part of the proceedings. For anybody who lost part of the broadcast, it will be put up on the website for everybody to watch. We appear to be back live again so apologies for any loss of broadcast in the intervening period. As Acting Chairman, I will take a few minutes to acknowledge all of the correspondence before us today and the compelling testimony the witnesses have given. As I have stated in the earlier sessions, this is about ensuring that we, as members of this committee, broaden our perspective so that we try to make the best legislation possible. We cannot do that without hearing from persons such as the witnesses. Regarding Bessborough, I am proud to be from Cork but what is happening in Bessborough at the moment is very disturbing for any decent Cork person. We all want a process that ensures there is memorialisation but that we do not fall foul of the coronial process where remains are found because that is a long-established process and it is based on legislation. We need to find some compromise in the legislation between the two views around that and that will be a challenge for us; I say that honestly and openly. I ask Mr. Dodd about the balance of arguments as between memorialising the entirety of the site and the responsibilities that exist in respect of adhering to the coronial process in circumstances where remains are found. I ask whether the creation of an agency in such circumstances could undermine any process as to natural justice for the persons who may be buried in Bessborough based on the balance of probability and Mr. Parfrey's submission. How do we strike a balance between memorialising the entirety of the site and the need to ensure that the coronial process where remains are discovered is not compromised?
9687	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	290	 I am talking about the legal element of this, as seen from Mr. Dodd's position as a barrister at law. The legislation before us is clear on creating an agency. Mr. Dodd has expressed a very legitimate view on closing off a specific element of the site, and we are very cognisant of the fact that he is speaking about a very specific part of it. He has already articulated that very well. I am referring to the law, however. Could Mr. Dodd express an opinion on the law and the coronial process as it relates to the entirety of the Bessborough site? It may be that he has not considered that point, which is entirely legitimate, but if he has an opinion on it I would dearly love to hear it.
9688	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	292	 We will keep going. I will take further questions from those who wish to contribute more to the process.
9689	SeanSherlock	Labour	17661.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	297	 Are there any other contributors? We are about to wind down proceedings but, before we do, we must have regard to the fact that there will be an oral hearing in respect of the Bessborough planning application on Wednesday, 21 April. It will be interesting to see what that process will bring in terms of closer investigation of the issue of investigations. I am hopeful that if there are people watching from An Bord Pleanála now, they will have regard to how the Oireachtas is considering these matters and the pertinent points that have been made by our contributors today. It should be noted that our contributors have made the point that survivors are not against planning per se, but there must be due regard and recognition of the sensitivities of the site and a process must put in place to deal with all of those. That is absolutely noted. Will either of the parties from Cork be parties to that An Bord Pleanála process when it emerges?

On that note, I propose that we close proceedings. Before doing so, as somebody who is chairing this session, I personally thank the witnesses - Kevin, Martin, David and Peter - sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the compelling evidence that each and every one of them has brought before us today. I speak as just one member here but please be assured that there is much in what they have said to which we must now give consideration. While there is a view that we need to make haste with the legislation, we need to make haste slowly and have due consideration to the compelling arguments that have been made here today. I thank the witnesses sincerely for the time that they have given us in coming here today. Please do not underestimate the potency of what you have said. Without further ado, unless there is any other official business, I propose that we publish the opening statements on the Oireachtas website. Is that agreed? Agreed. On behalf of the committee, I again thank all the witnesses for their engagement with the members of the committee and for appearing before the committee today, both in person and virtually. I assure them that all members of the committee, as well as the Chair, Deputy Funchion, are united in prioritising the work programme of the committee to assist the Minister in the implementation of the recommendations and actions provided for in the commission of investigation report into the mother and baby homes. I thank our staff, who are working under tremendous pressure in terms of these hearings, for their work thus far today.

It adds to the body of knowledge of people's experience. I am being influenced by what I have heard today and the previous day too. I am still trying to get my head around the coronial process. I would like to hear Ms Ryan-O'Brien's perspective in light of the submission we received from Professor Phil Scraton on the disapplication of the coroner's existing mandatory jurisdiction. We have a coroner system here. Has Aitheantas considered the effects of the legislation as drafted on the coronial process?
9732	SeanSherlock	Labour	17674.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	59	 I thank Ms Ryan-O'Brien for those answers. We are trying to interrogate the whole issue around things such as DNA storage. We know from Mr. Tansey, in a submission to the committee from the group he works with in Tuam, that survivors would have their DNA taken and stored for possible matching with babies' remains that are exhumed. Since then, two of their group have died but no DNA has yet been collected from any survivors who accordingly are increasingly anxious. Therein lies the terrible hurt that can be relieved in the short term. It is about creating a system where evidence gathering is robust such that the restorative justice and the transitional justice that is being spoken about is based on a set of structures and protocols whereby a person has somebody to interface with where things such as DNA are examined and there is an investigatory process that tallies with the law of the land. That is why I am asking about the coronial process. Perhaps Mr. O'Brien could address that further because I am grappling with it at the moment.

I thank the Minister of State for being present. I also thank her for the very professional manner in which she deals with queries from my constituency office on individual cases. I record my gratitude to her for her engagement with me on behalf of my constituents and people in the Cork region who live outside my constituency. I will start with the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party last week. I questioned the Minister of State about the figures during the debate. I had tabled a parliamentary question for answer on 8 April which showed that the total number of overdue applications for an assessment of need, AON, was running at 5,078, give or take. I need some reconciliation of the figures given what the Minister of State is telling us today. There was a slight discrepancy between what was in the script we received and the script the Minister of State delivered. She stated she was pleased to inform the committee that by the end of April we had reduced the waiting list to approximately 1,500 cases. The information I received was 5,078 versus 1,500 cases. That is the first point. Could the Minister of State give us a perspective on that? Perhaps in accountancy terms, a reconciliation statement needs to be done and that might require me tabling a further parliamentary question or perhaps the Minister of State could write to the committee.

I take her point and thank her for her clarification. I will run through my questions very quickly as I am conscious of time. The interim review of the SOP is due to take place. Is there a set of terms and conditions or terms of reference for the SOP and will that include taking testimonials from parents? Following on from the point made by Deputy Cairns, it would be vitally important that parents would be part of that process. If this issue is a matter for jurisprudence at the moment, that would certainly worry me. As a member of the committee I would have to be confident that this is not going to be just a box-ticking exercise. I am concerned about the possibility that it is going to vindicate the existing SOP and then we are out the gap in 2022 with the boxes ticked and we must do retrospective work on what could potentially be flawed AONs. I am genuinely worried that we would have a problem down the line.

Again, it is about a response to a parliamentary question on 30 April where I asked about additional staff recruitment in CHO 4 since 2018. The reference number of the question was 20364/21. I was informed that there was one whole-time equivalent speech and language therapist for the Cope Foundation, one speech and language therapist for north Cork in St. Joseph’s Foundation, one occupational therapist for the South Lee Brothers of Charity, one occupational therapist for the Cope Foundation in north Lee, one occupational therapist for north Cork in St. Joseph's Foundation and one speech and language therapist in south Lee. I do not expect the Minister of State to internalise all of that, but I have given her the reference number of the parliamentary question and her staff will probably have regard to that. The point is that there has only been one of each type of therapist in each of the sectors in north Lee, north Cork, south Lee, north Cork, north Cork and south Lee. I refer to speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. It is never going to be enough to meet demand. Those are dismal figures in terms of the follow-on from the AONs and the need for access to the services. It is very hard to see how the Minister of State will be able to provide services to support people in each of those areas unless there is a serious effort in respect of recruitment. I put that information before the Minister of State.

9743	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	 I thank the Chairman. I am in Leinster House. I join others in welcoming the Minister to the committee. I will read briefly from the Minister's opening statement: Careful attention is being paid in drafting to the specific relationship between the coroner and the agency to make sure that investigative obligations which currently lie with the coronial service are not undermined. The position is that nothing in the legislation should preclude further investigation if that is warranted. The Minister will hear very clearly from members the doubts and worries that are being expressed with regard to the disapplying of the powers of the coroner. We all know that a person of no less standing than Professor Phil Scraton submitted to the committee, which I am sure the Minister heard. When talking about the legislation, Professor Scraton said: ... its enactment would disapply existing powers of the coroner in whatever locations and in respect of all deaths over which a new agency is given jurisdiction. The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinterment ... [or] the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when ... [they] died, where ... [they] died and, most important, how ... [they] died. I put it to the Minister that he has not adequately addressed thus far the proposal to disapply the power of the coroner. I remain very doubtful about this piece of legislation at present on the basis that witness after expert witness, from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to Professor Scraton, have all expressed their deep concern about the disapplication of that power. I do not care if this is a misuse of that word. I do not believe the Minister has adequately addressed the elephant in the room today. I would love to hear his view on that first point.
9744	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 I do understand this. I apologise for cutting across the Minister but my time is limited. I have noted this and I have internalised what the Minister has said in respect of this point. If he is saying that we cannot have a cross-jurisdictional regime and there has to be consistency in respect of the coronial process, or a system of investigation, I put it to the Minister that the legislation before us still does not robustly instill within it a coronial process akin to the laws of the land and the standards that apply in respect of deaths and the investigative process arising from them. I put it to the Minister that he still has not adequately addressed this issue in the proposal before us today. This is the elephant in the room. I cannot move on with the legislation until we have dealt with this issue sufficiently. The Minister is saying he will consider this element of the legislation to ensure no element could be construed as providing a barrier to any investigation. I am not seeing the evidence of this coming forward in the wording. Forgive me if I have missed this in dispatches.
9745	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	 I ask the Chair to forgive me if I am over time. I do not know how much latitude I have.
9746	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	" What makes me uncomfortable is the issue of what the Minister described as ""manifestly inappropriate"" and the criteria that are to be set down in the first instance by the agency to determine what is or is not manifestly inappropriate. Even if we take exhumation and investigation, is there a fear that the power of the coroner and the coronial process will be undermined? To refer to what Professor Scraton told the committee, 9,000, or 15%, of infants born in the institutions examined died there, in addition to the deaths of 200 mothers. We know the rates of mortality are extremely high and I would have thought this alone would be sufficient to ensure there is no ambiguity on the issue of the discretion of the Government of the day to put in place, or set up, an agency as it sees fit. If the number of deaths is so high, and if we know from the commission's reports that the mortality rate in institutions was extremely high, this in and of itself surely is worthy of investigation, such that a Minister cannot limit the power to investigate it if the Government of the day decided for economic reasons not to go there and not to open that casket because it could be at it for years and investigations could cost the State millions of euro. If we go down the road in the Bill of being influenced by economic factors and not factors of transitional justice, such as the convention on enforced disappearances, the obligations of investigation and the rights to remedy, then we will come back to this down the line. I am on the side of the Minister but I want to be reassured by what he is telling us about the legislation being robust enough to ensure justice will not be denied in future to people or relatives and to those poor souls who have the right to justice. Forgive me as I do not mean to be rhetorical about this but I want to be sure we get it absolutely right."
9747	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	 Forgive me if I repeat some points that have already been made. If we accept the fact that the powers of the coroner are being disapplied on two out of three sets of criteria, which is what the Minister is saying, but that the power of investigation is not diminished in any way because that is the law of the land, the legitimate question arises about the number of agencies involved. Referring to Tuam specifically - and thank goodness for the work of Catherine Corless and others - we reasonably know where we stand and what is ahead of us in the road ahead as this application applies. If I refresh my memory, we had a presentation from the historical burials legislation unit - the Minister's own colleagues - where they said that the legislation was being applied because existing jurisdiction to authorise exhumations does not readily apply to the particularly unusual circumstances arising at Tuam, and similarly the legislation governing the identification of remains by means of DNA comparison is not suitable for those circumstances. We know why we are legislating. I have a final request for the Minister. If we accept that the power of the coroner is not diminished in any way will the Minister give this committee some comfort that resources will be made available for the recruitment of an additional number of coroners, or give us an assurance that the coronial process as it applies to the creation of an agency in respect of a specific site or other follow-on sites will not be hampered by the lack of adequate coronial services, such as for the efforts in seeking justice and the efforts in seeking to identify remains, and that these services are not undermined by a lack of resources? That is my question, fundamentally. I have a second point for the Minister. There is one limited power that individual Members of the Oireachtas have, which is the power to submit the parliamentary question. I hope that something would be built into this legislation on the accountability feature that allows for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas, to make representations on behalf of a person or families who may wish to seek information. I hope that the making of those representations or the advocating for families, which is what we all do as Members, would not be diminished in any way and that some structure could be put in place so Members could assist such persons, and that GDPR and other barriers would not be put up in front of us.
9748	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	 Again, I just want to be very clear. I ask the Minister to forgive me, and I know he is not deliberately misinterpreting what I am saying. I am talking about the resourcing of the coronial service, and that is a matter for the Government. I recognise that silos exist in Departments, but the Minister is the line manager, as it were, for the setting up of this agency. Therefore, if there is to be an extensive coronial investigative process in this regard, I ask that it will not be hampered. That is presumably a whole-of-Government matter and not just for the Minister for Justice. Therefore, I take the point the Minister is making about the review, but I ask him to use his good offices to ensure that when an agency is created that it will not be hampered by the lack of investigative powers due to the unavailability of a coroner or coroners or other such appropriate staff as might be deemed necessary to carry out investigations.
9749	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	 Again, I am not asking for the disapplication of the-----

9751	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	72	 That is fine, but I want to be clear that I am not asking for the disapplication of GDPR.
9752	SeanSherlock	Labour	17695.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	74	 GDPR is sometimes put up as a block to Teachtaí in respect of certain agencies which are subsets of Departments. It is sometimes misapplied, and I do not want that to happen in this case. The Minister is again telling us that the coronial process is being disapplied in two out of three criteria, if I understood him correctly. I may be mishearing the Minister, but he appears now to be saying that the coronial process is being completely disapplied. My hearing could be at fault or I might be misinterpreting the Minister. If I am, I will stand corrected. However, there needs to be clarity in this regard, because I am a little more confused after the Minister's last intervention than I was before. I ask the Minister to forgive me if I am wrong.

I thank everyone who has made a submission to this process. It has been informative for us, and certainly me. I did not expect to be called so soon, as I did not realise that there were so many members missing, but I will start with the many questions that were raised by the Adoption Authority in its opening statement. Does Ms Traynor believe that there are still many questions on resourcing, timeframes and so on that have not been adequately answered in the authority's interactions with the Department on this legislation? I do not want to misinterpret her but it seems that, from her questioning at this meeting, the import is that there are still many unanswered questions in respect of this legislation. Am I right in assuming that or am I reading too much into it from Ms Traynor's submission? She can be as frank as she likes.
9764	SeanSherlock	Labour	17723.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 In its submission, the Adoption Authority wrote: Can birth parents apply to get their children’s birth and adoption records? Could this be included in proposed legislation? The Authority believes that consideration needs to be given on the implications of releasing personal information, for example, a person named as birth father on record which later proves to be incorrect. What is informing that point? What exactly is Ms Traynor saying there? What is her concern, in plain language?
9765	SeanSherlock	Labour	17723.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	 Is there a statistically significant number of examples - and I suppose one is statistically significant in this case - of a person being named as birth father on a record that proves to be incorrect. How many such scenarios has Ms Traynor encountered? How many does she envisage encountering in the future?

If it reaches the point where there is a dispute, where does the DPC see itself in terms of the existing legislation in respect of dispute resolution and in the context of this legislation when it is passed? In other words, when there are competing parties, as I understand it, the DPC seeks to mediate between them. If a situation arises, however, that is beyond mediation or agreement, where stands the DPC in all of that? I hope that question makes sense. If it does not, tell me straight out."

Mr. Sunderland has confirmed what I thought. This is an iterative process and the DPC has yet to fully analyse or process the data protection impact assessment. In light of that, and once that analysis is done, I ask the Chair if there is a possibility of hearing further from the DPC on how this legislation works in the context of its responsibilities? I would welcome a further submission on that. I will leave it at that.

Starting with the individual family support plans, I had a parliamentary question on this issue answered by Mr. O'Regan. It was dated 24 May 2022. In that question, I asked the Minister of Health the number of individualised family service plans issued and accepted by each CDNT, broken down by CHO area. The response I got was that the individual family support plan process is a live one, in that the team and family keep it under review while service supports and strategies are being implemented and as the needs and achievements of the child and family change. Is the output of the individual family support plans being measured as this process is being rolled out? Where I am going with this question is towards trying to get at the experience of the family that interfaces with the service.
9778	SeanSherlock	Labour	18075.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-02 00:00:00	Joint Meeting with Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth	33	" On this same issue, we have now created another bolt-on aspect to the experiences of the family and the child. The experiences of families of which I am aware, whether we like it or not, reflect a lack of confidence in the service. Families are afraid that they are being sent down yet another road and to another service that they must sign up to get access to services. I am not going to be rhetorical. I just ask the HSE to be mindful of this point and if it can do that, it would be good. We know what the experiences of families are. We all know they are jaded now. Let us take that as a given. We all accept that. If I dovetail the individual family support plan process now with the creation of the CDNTs, then this is again about measurement. Turning to Ms O'Neill, another parliamentary question I submitted asked ""the number of children that have been transferred from Children's Disability Network Team back to primary care on foot of assessments since April 2021, by age, CHO and LHO in tabular form and general categorisation for such a transfer back to primary care operations"". Ms O'Neill's response to me stated, ""Though there is no specific timeline on when the system will be available, I can confirm that there has been a procurement process and the system is now at the development stage."" Again, we do not have a live measurement of the families' experience as they are going through the system. They are again being asked to sign up to a CDNT process and they are wondering how many more arguably bureaucratic processes they will have to go through before they can get access to the speech and language therapist, SLT, the occupational therapist, OT, the psychologist and all the therapy services. Do the witnesses appreciate where I am coming from in this regard? We must ensure that parents and children are minded in this context. The bottom line in all of this is still access to the services, notwithstanding all the issues we are talking about here concerning recruitment, which is, effectively, the big elephant in the room. I just want to hear from witnesses from the HSE that they are going to be careful and mindful of families in this process."

Do we know how many therapists, by their designation as SLTs and OTs, have left the CDNTs since January 2022? If we know the answer to that question, do we know if those people have been replaced? What is the status of the individual files? I ask this because, again, we have the child interfacing with a service, and he or she has already started to do so in these cases. One person who was a part of delivering that service then leaves, for all sorts of appropriate reasons, and, suddenly, that child and the family are left in limbo. They do not know where they stand. I will ask my fourth question and then I will be done.

If I am reading Mr. Reid and the Minister of State correctly concerning the need to address the imbalance here on the pay parity side, there is a responsibility, and I say this respectfully, on the Government to engage with the trade unions and the representatives of employees to address this subject. I say this because, and the Co-Chair will attest to this, we have a facility in north County Cork, namely, St. Joseph's Foundation located at Cooleens House, and every time I submit a parliamentary question - and there is a plethora of them now - the response I get back refers to the problem of recruitment and being unable to recruit. My fear is that what has happened is that people have moved over from one service to another, because, whether people like it or not, there is this perception that there is this type of Darwinian system where the HSE has recruited and taken on people from section 38 and 39 organisations because of better terms and conditions. If we do not address this aspect, we will be at nothing.

I refer to the specific question I had about what happens in a CDNT when somebody leaves and there is a live file. What happens to the file? What is the legitimate expectation of the child and his or her family in respect of that file? I need an answer to that question because I have cases where that has happened. The second point I made that was not addressed was pay inequalities. Mr. Reid said he met with the section 39 organisations, I think he said specifically. I would like to know what the nature of those discussions were and whether the issue of pay parity and equality of pay came up. There is an elephant in the room here. I referenced St. Joseph's Foundation but it is one of many service providers where the same thing is happening, namely, they cannot open services and they remain closed because the providers cannot recruit. I am being told they cannot because they are competing with the HSE. I would like to hear from Mr. Reid about how the HSE intends to grasp the nettle on that one and where the Minister of State is then as far as ensuring we have parity is concerned. Deputy Tully was here earlier and opened up with that very point. We need to address that point. I would like some response from-----

I thank the delegation from the HSE, the Minister of State and officials from the Department for being here. This has been a joint meeting aimed at trying to address the issue under discussion. It is important that it has been accepted here this morning there are failures in respect of children right across the spectrum. When I took the job of Chair of my committee, I stated that the Taoiseach would go before the Houses to apologise for the way the State has treated children with disabilities. That was evident from the meeting. A number of themes have arisen on what needs to be done. At the very outset of the questions I thought there might have been an HSE versus the Department of Health discussion as to what legislation needs to be changed and what needs to be done. From the way the meeting has gone, however, it is clear the recruitment drive needs to be made to ensure, as regards the teams that are being proposed,that we have the recruitment of full teams and the retention of staff. I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed. They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things. That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations. As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services. We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained. We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain. We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services. The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services. I made the point in the Dáil yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well. On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here. The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this. We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this. We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in. That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that. I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.

It is important that it has been accepted here this morning there are failures in respect of children right across the spectrum. When I took the job of Chair of my committee, I stated that the Taoiseach would go before the Houses to apologise for the way the State has treated children with disabilities. That was evident from the meeting. A number of themes have arisen on what needs to be done. At the very outset of the questions I thought there might have been an HSE versus the Department of Health discussion as to what legislation needs to be changed and what needs to be done. From the way the meeting has gone, however, it is clear the recruitment drive needs to be made to ensure, as regards the teams that are being proposed,that we have the recruitment of full teams and the retention of staff. I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed. They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things. That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations. As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services. We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained. We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain. We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services. The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services. I made the point in the Dáil yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well. On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here. The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this. We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this. We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in. That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that. I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.

9793	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	4	 I thank our guests for their submission. It was very well researched. This is the first time I have seen some sort of crystallisation of the issue of vulnerability among that cohort of about 10,000 people, including the 1,274 in the 18-to-24-year-old category. They come to us, as public representatives, and they present in some way, shape or form but we just do not know how to deal with the issue. There is no playbook for any Deputy or Senator for dealing with that cohort of people. If they have been in the care system, there is no transition, and if they have not and they are identified as having had, as Mr. Stanley noted, an adverse child experience, they just fall through the gaps. When I talk to local authorities, there does not seem to be a solution there either. The question is how we can help these people transition and what our guests have come up with is, potentially, a way forward. Are they confident they can get sufficient traction with this strategy such that resources will be provided, given this will be about resources following on from their organisation's advocacy? Can we sort it out? Is there a sympathetic ear at departmental level?
9794	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	6	 I am not sure how much time I have. The Galway example involves placing people in accommodation. What is the real-time experience of somebody who presents to a local authority, for instance, where he or she has to fill out a housing application form and go through this bureaucratic process?
9795	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	8	 Is it known by people on the ground that there is a front door they can go through?
9796	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	48	 I went to college in Galway. I always found the Galway people industrious and when it came to finding solutions to problems, that people came together.
9797	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	50	 The mighty Corrib unites them. I am fascinated that they have developed a model where all of the stakeholders are willing partners and they have been able to find accommodation and to have the wraparound supports. How could I get this service going in Cork, for instance, which is where I am from? I could see some challenges in breaking down the silos between all of the constituent partners that would be needed to come together on this. Although not insurmountable, these are challenges nonetheless. Have the Simon Community carried out research, either academic or their own, around the results and the follow-ons of individuals coming through the system? How they are getting on now, because I would love to see this model replicated? If I, as a public representative, could guide somebody into such a service, that would be meaningful for me instead of having to go through the usual frustrations that we experience as Deputies trying to advocate for our own people. I would love to take their model. I would love to engage in the research that they have carried out, if any, and bring it to Cork, for instance, and say that here is a model and it works. It would force people to shake off their own preconceptions about young people who are presenting to them because often their experience is not a good one. Ms Feeney crystallised it for me perfectly in terms of the snakes and ladders. When somebody is vulnerable, it is easy for me to talk as I have the capacity to advocate for myself. Not everybody else does and they need those support. What is their perspective on how we could replicate this model and get the political buy-in for that? I would welcome their views on that. It is a big question and I am sorry for that.

9799	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	55	 Can I presume that Mr. Finnerty would be more than familiar with the model in Galway?
9800	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	82	 I welcome our guests. I want to speak about foster carers. I received correspondence from a foster carer who is also a social worker. She wrote to me in a private capacity. In her letter she states her worry is that many foster carers will not be able to continue to do what they do and that it will not be affordable for people to consider becoming foster carers, especially as fostering impacts on a carer's ability to be available for other paid work. She has layered much more into the letter but this is the kernel of it for me. Mr. Gloster has stated that Tusla's strategic plan on foster care services was approved by the Tusla board on Friday, 30 September 2022. I will reflect some of what I have heard from foster carers about the letter issued to them. They found the letter extremely patronising. It is important that Tusla hears this because it is what I have been hearing from foster carers. They engaged in what they thought was a meaningful process after which one of the recommendations was an increase in allowances and financial and other supports. This is highlighted in the letter from Tusla to them. Mr. Gloster and Ms Duggan said they heard loud and clear what the foster carers said. The budget came after this. All that arose for foster carers from the budgetary process, in which I assume Tusla was directly involved with its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was an allowance of €325 or €350. Did Tusla, through its parent Department, make a specific recommendation that the allowances to foster carers should be increased in budget 2023?
9801	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	84	 Are copies of this correspondence available?
9802	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	86	 Yes, I do.
9803	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	88	 I thank Mr. Gloster. If I understand him correctly he is saying that as an organisation Tusla advocated through the budgetary process with the Department for an increase in allowances.
9804	SeanSherlock	Labour	18206.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-11 00:00:00	Alternative Aftercare Services for Young Adults: Discussion	90	" If there were some evidence of this it would assist me, and perhaps the committee, in advocating for those foster carers. If this is the case and we have the proof of it, we can ask where the Department was in its engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We can ask why we have been left with a situation whereby foster carers feel extremely patronised by the fact the allowance was a paltry sum by any objective analysis. The great job they do is acknowledged in the language that is used but concrete supports are not forthcoming in real terms. I acknowledge there is a strategic plan but I am not sure whether, following what happened with the budget, foster carers now have confidence in that. There is a political element to this. There needs to be engagement with Government parties on the non-delivery of supports. If it is the case that Tusla has actively advocated then, I say ""fair play"" to it. This must be acknowledged and there is a line of questioning that must be pursued with the Minister. What is happening with Positive Care Ireland? Has it been wound down? Is it still in existence? What is its status?"

9825	SeanSherlock	Labour	18213.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-10-18 00:00:00	Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020: Discussion (Resumed)	27	" This is an instructive discussion and I am leaning a great deal. I welcome the Bill. Labour supports it and notes the observations made on it. I understand that IBEC was invited to attend this meeting but is not present. It would have been instructive for IBEC to attend because that would have broadened the discussion and we would have heard the employer's perspective. In my humble opinion, that IBEC is not present creates the perception that this is not a matter that it wants to engage on constructively with the Houses of the Oireachtas. Maybe it is waiting for further discussions with departmental officials and the Minister on the Government's Bill. Fair enough if that is the case, but it is rare that we have discussions of this nature where we have the trade union position and the academic position. These are good days in that respect, even though we are tackling a subject matter that is horrific. I do not want to offend Dr. Nata by mispronouncing her surname, so I will call her ""Dr. Nata"", if that is okay. I wish to ask her about the key issues to consider to improve the effectiveness of the Bill. She referred to assessing ""the universality of the application of the law."" I have not fully internalised what she means by what she stated next: While there is no reference to the size of the enterprise, there is concern about the extent to which this law would apply to small entrepreneurs hiring only one or two employees, or employees without contracts, such as volunteers or other informal workers. When considering domestic violence, it is important to understand that domestic employment or employment in a family enterprise [her written submission refers here to farms and households, which were the key words for me] puts more women at risk of experiencing domestic violence. These employees are outside the ambit of the Organisation of Working Time Act... According to her, it was not clear that this group of workers come under the remit of the Bill. I have no doubt that Deputy O'Reilly will comprehensively address this point, but is there a potential wording that could be offered up by way of amendment or suggestion to the proposer of the Bill that would strengthen it, having regard to, ceteris paribus, the Deputy's answer? If this provision could be buttressed, doing so would be vital. There is not only Deputy O'Reilly's Bill, but also the Government's Bill, and we are dealing with both. In the interventions that all of the witnesses have made today, we have a set of tools to strengthen both Bills or one or the other, depending on which is before us first. I welcome this Bill. If it could be strengthened, particularly in respect of farm holdings and domestic situations, I would welcome that."

We as Irish people have a responsibility to play our part. Notwithstanding all that, I feel we should be allowed to question policies, as we are doing today. When issues arise, we should be allowed to address them freely without any labels being applied. We all encounter specific scenarios in our constituencies. One such scenario that arose very recently for me was where there was a proposed accommodation site in County Cork, which is being made ready at present and is co-located with an educational establishment. I will not be specific about where or what the educational establishment is. Concerns have been expressed to me by parents about having a co-located facility with shared access to public spaces for adults and children. What issues might there be from the point of view of child protection? Could I guide the educational establishment to an identifiable person in Tusla or another body who could liaise with it? If people have information, a lot of the heat will be taken out of issues. I can make the Minister aware of the specific site after this meeting. If some work were done now, that would alleviate some of the pressures I see building up within the community. The second issue I raise relates to where buildings are being renovated or repurposed. I have encountered a couple of examples of this. In one case, the building that is being made ready for accommodation purposes would have had to go through the local authority and apply for planning. We all recognise that that hurdle has to be jumped at the moment. Nevertheless, this is one tool we as public representatives can use on behalf of adjacent neighbours where concerns have been expressed and where buildings being renovated feature clear breaches of planning law. I am no engineer or architect but clear breaches of planning law may be taking place to make way for accommodation. There is no apparent recourse for the nearest neighbour who, because of this retrofitting or refurbishment, might be very negatively impacted by it in terms of rights of way, access and so on. Can any mechanism be found through liaising with the local authorities to ensure that where buildings are being retrofitted, there will be a set of standards that are apparent and transparent to everybody? Therefore, if a person were making way for accommodation that is needed, he or she would know to adhere to those guidelines and be cognisant of who his or her neighbours were. On modular accommodation units, technically, this comes under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but it would be useful to hear from the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, regarding the proposed 500 modular accommodation units that are proposed to house 2,000 people. Do we have any further information as to the status of that? He may have spoken to this earlier and I apologise if he did. When we think of modular units historically, we think of them as damp, dank prefabs, but the technology relating to modular units has advanced a great deal. There can now be 60- or 70-year timelines on them. I am very glad to hear the Minister say tents will not be used, for example, but we could do a lot if there were a serious advance in respect of putting in place modular units that pass all the standards that are required. That would be a good and quick way to provide accommodation. The Minister might give his perspective on that.

I had not been conscious of the parent in all of this. I have looked matters through the prism of people who come to our constituency offices, and very often it is about a social protection query or a medical card query, but once one starts to open the box one sees that there are other issues, but one never really fully engages with the trauma or other difficulties that a parent would have in these circumstances. This meeting has been very useful for me in being more conscious about that from now on. I will not single anybody out in particular, and not to exclude anybody else, but the Clarecare model seems to be most sympathetic and empathetic model. Is this the model that can be replicated and transposed throughout the State? I am not an expert, but if that was the model that could be used it seems to me to really to get down into the weeds of an issue. It really forms the basis of very strong relationships and understanding of people's issues. It probably pulls a lot of information out of people that heretofore they may not have felt the capacity to give. If that was to be the model, I believe it would be a very good model. I would love to have the witnesses' perspectives on that. This is not to denigrate or to undermine anybody else's potential model. I would just like to get our guests' perspectives on whether that could be the model. I believe it is a great model. That is my first question.

We must understand and appreciate the service has only been operational for a matter of weeks really. It is an iterative process. I absolutely acknowledge that. My second and final point is in relation to the courts. We have been talking about reform of the courts for donkey's years and for decades. I believe that we think too rigidly in this country about how the Courts Service operates: one must present in an adversarial fashion in a building that is very clearly identified. In my constituency of Cork East in Youghal I have seen two instances where domestic violence issues and family related issues have been consolidated into Cork city. For a lot of people that might not seem so far away but for a lot of families it is a gargantuan task to have to think about how they will engage with those services. Similarly, in my home town of Mallow the District Court will close for six months for refurbishment, which is necessary, but some of the services I have just mentioned will now be consolidated in Cork city for the duration. I do not think there is an appreciation by the Courts Service of the effect this will have on families. I do not see why one cannot build or refurbish buildings within towns throughout the country that could hold these hearings. The settings are vitally important and the representatives here have made very strong reference to that. I believe needs to be a modal shift in how we think about courts, the architecture around courts, and the nature of the buildings themselves. I welcome the representatives' interventions and their observations in that regard. I am hopeful that the current Minister, who has set out her stall with regard to domestic violence in particular, would be mindful of the need for family courts to be designed in such a way as to ensure they are conducive for families who engage with them. I thank our witnesses for their submissions here today.

9843	SeanSherlock	Labour	18318.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Disability Services: Discussion	22	 First of all, I am from Cork and I heartily welcome all our guests here today. These testimonies are the most impactful for us. When people tell their personal stories, it allows us to internalise it and see how we can drive on with solutions, which is what the witnesses are ultimately looking for from politicians. I listened carefully to Ms Moran when she spoke about the recruitment costs. The figure of €15 million was provided on foot of a parliamentary question I tabled. Imagine what one could do with that money for a lot of families. I know that sounds like a simplistic thing to say on my behalf, but the HSE is paying recruitment companies to hire people and they are clearly not hiring them. They are not doing what they are supposed to be doing and €15 million of taxpayers' money is being used when we could be providing the services for people. It seems from our guests' experience that bespoke solutions can be tailored locally, depending on where a person is living or what part of the country he or she is from, to provide the services. I am always tabling parliamentary questions because that is the tool of our trade in this House. I refer to CHO 4 - forgive me for not including other parts of the country - because Cork and Kerry are represented at this meeting. Looking at the top-line figures for waiting lists for CHO 4, which is the Cork-Kerry region, the number of children waiting for an initial speech and language assessment is over 1,200 and for initial therapy the figure is 1,700 children. People with Down's syndrome obviously come into those categories as well. Similarly, there are more than 2,000 children waiting for further therapy in the Cork-Kerry region and we are spending €15 million on recruitment companies. It is easy for us to blame the HSE but, at some stage, there needs to be a shift in Government policy to take ownership of the recruitment piece. What is screaming out to me, based on cases in my constituency of Cork East and it being confirmed here by the witnesses, is the number of people waiting for speech and language therapy. It is absolutely frightening. It upsets me if a child cannot communicate to a parent. I am a dad of three kids. One thing we all as parents work on assiduously is getting the child to communicate with us because we want to know how the child is feeling. If that service is denied to a parent, that is something we need to work on. Similarly, ophthalmology is another area coming up on my radar in a big way. The number of children in Cork and Kerry waiting for ophthalmology services is 3,200. Whatever about everything else and the other ancillary issues and therapies, the ability to see and talk are two key for any parent. What can I do in the Cork region, or in my constituency, to try to assist that process? The variation in the experience of the parents coming out of Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, with their child is phenomenal and actually frightening. That is not a reflection on individuals. It is that there is no system-wide approach. I would have thought there would be universality in terms of protocols being put in place for every baby born and, obviously, that is not the case. Very often, it depends on the midwife who picks up on things. We all know of very experienced midwives who know mothers and the pattern of births and so on and so forth and who are very perceptive. I have heard of situations where the midwife was the key person in assisting the parents in where they need to go. My question is simple. Is there something I should be doing now, as a Deputy in the Cork area, such as contacting CUMH as a starting point for future and existing parents? Do I need to pick up the phone and speak to the chief officer of the Cork-Kerry area for instance, or wherever? Do I need to say that he or she needs to sit down with Down Syndrome Ireland and talk about what is happening in Cork, that we need to start looking at this from birth through to education and the transitions that Senator Seery Kearney mentioned? Is there something more that I as a public representative can do to push the door open for parents and act as an intermediary, an interlocutor, or an advocate in the Cork-Kerry region, and to say that little changes here and additional services there would make a world of difference? That is what I would like to hear from our guests. I would demand it and be very happy to do that. Our guests have heard all the politicians and the platitudes. They have heard it all before a million times. Following this meeting - in deference to our colleagues from Carlow and Kilkenny - I would have no qualms from a Cork-Kerry point of view about picking up the phone to the chief officer in the HSE to say that we need to get a meeting and start talking about access to services. I would be very happy to do so. I am sorry if I am ranting on a little bit but the testimony of our guests is very compelling.

9848	SeanSherlock	Labour	18318.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Disability Services: Discussion	32	" If the witness tells me that Down Syndrome Ireland are, at a national policy level, talking to the NCSE about the transitions we are discussing then I will be satisfied. If the answer is ""no"" then people like me could contact the NCSE. What I am finding in schools is a piecemeal, almost pernicious approach by the NCSE. Schools will get an allocation of half a person here and a quarter of a person there. This is how surreal it has become in this country. If Down Syndrome Ireland could talk to the NCSE and if people like us could push that along we might be able to open a door there as well."

9851	SeanSherlock	Labour	18318.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Disability Services: Discussion	40	 We now have the creation of the CDNTs and the primary care teams and all of this new policy. It seems to me that under the old system using a provider like Down Syndrome Ireland seemed to reach the child or person a lot quicker than is happening now. Even if one factors Covid and lockdown out of the equation there seemed to be a greater reach or at least there was more connection between parents and the service under the old system. That is the impression I have.

9873	SeanSherlock	Labour	16736.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 I, too, welcome Professor Stott to the committee. This has been a useful tutorial for us in an academic sense and a fruitful exercise. One of the professor's slides mentions the global average surface temperature change from 1850 to 2000. Are we talking about an increase in temperature of up to 5° Celsius? What will be the permutations for life on the planet if the average temperature increases by that amount by 2100? Will we be in an existential crisis at that stage if we keep going the way we are going? What kind of radical measures do governments need to take now in respect of policies that will halt the effects of human-induced climate change? The key message that I have taken from Professor Stott's intervention is that human-induced climate change is a major contributory factor to the increases in temperature. If I understand the professor correctly, he is stating that if we continue to go in the way we are going in terms of the production of carbon, we will overshoot what is envisaged in the Paris Agreement as a result of human-induced climate change and that the lack of policy interventions by governments across the globe means that the change being implemented is not radical enough to halt the effects of temperature increases as measured on the Celsius scale. Will the professor expand on that a little?

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on global warming of 1.5° C as a result of CO2 emissions from industry, pathways limiting global warming to 1.5° C are projected to be approximately 75% to 90% lower in 2050 relative to 2010. That is compared with the 50% to 80% figure for global warming if we are projecting up to 2° C. Will Dr. Quinn indicate the emissions trajectory for Irish industry from now to 2030 and from now to 2050? Will I continue with my questions?
9880	SeanSherlock	Labour	16752.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-18 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	32	 That is the first question. If there is a difference in that respect, how different is the current trajectory in terms of the requirement for industry to cut emissions by more than 75%? I cannot see any specific figures in Dr. Quinn's submission on cutting emissions. I would like to see information from the Department in respect of those figures. The second theme also emanates from the recent IPPC report. How will the Department assess the specific actions it must take to lead Irish industry in delivering what we call the deep cuts in overall emissions in the next 12 years? We have gone from a 2030 to 2050 outlook to a 12-year outlook, which I believe will be the modus operandi of this committee. I refer to the recent IPCC report dealing with the 12 years from now. How will individual Departments move towards radical policies across their agencies to target those deep cuts that are so necessary? What specific actions will the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation take? On the research, development and innovation, RDI piece, priority areas were noted in the submission. I have some degree of familiarity with those priority areas. How much money is being allocated across those thematic areas, specifically relating to energy, climate action and sustainability, including the decarbonisation of the energy system and sustainable living? What are the names of the research centres? How much money is each research centre receiving? What is the total amount of moneys being received for each of those centres? Is the issue of climate change or radical climate action in respect of the 12 years mapped across the area of food, for instance, in terms of smart and sustainable food production and processing and on manufacturing and novel materials, including advances in smart manufacturing?

Wednesday is a day when one has to attend other committees as well. I welcome the submission, which I have read. I merely want to ask some key questions. On the theme of building capacity in relation to the LCDCs and the PPNs, communities are coming together and generating ideas about what they want to do and there is an articulation of those ideas or projects through the local authorities. I want to glean a better understanding from the Department of how it is facilitating or helping to build capacity so that we can see a greater throughput of these localised projects with a climate change theme. One specific project with which I am familiar is the IRD Duhallow project on warmer homes. I am not sure whether Mr. McCarthy is familiar with that project. It is an extremely good project whereby those who are dependent on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment can be facilitated with a grant and the project will come out and retrofit houses for attic insulation. That is one bespoke and valuable project for the community I represent. I wonder how the Department can translate that across a wider geographical spectrum and how one builds capacity on that kind of project and other types of projects. The LCDCs and the PPNs have considerable potential to build capacity and deliver projects for everybody, and have a real impact. I want to get an understanding from the Department of that dynamic. That is my first question.

Such projects have the potential to be real game-changers locally. If, arising from our deliberations here in committee we compile a report, it would be helpful if we could speak to that potential. That is the second question. In regard to planning policy, to follow up on Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point, I want to get an understanding of whether there is a need to ensure that houses in rural areas are built near settlements so as to reduce the dependency on cars. Mr. McCarthy may say that is a Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government competence but I wish merely to have the Department of Rural and Community Development's perspective on that as well.

9900	SeanSherlock	Labour	16758.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-24 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	244	 I am grateful to have the opportunity to interact with the commissioners in the OPW. In terms of management of the State property portfolio and the built environment the Citizens' Assembly report makes a specific recommendation, for which 100% of the members voted, that the State should take a leadership role in addressing climate change through mitigation measures including, for example, retrofitting public buildings. The witnesses would have read that before coming in here today. Why is it that, according to the OPW, 79% of buildings are rated either C or D, which comprise 42% and 37%, respectively? I appreciate the point that most poorly performing buildings have exceptional electric loads, data centres and so on but can we be more ambitious about that target? Is there language that can be used to say we are looking at the 12-year window and can the OPW become more radical in getting those C and D-rated buildings up to ratings of B and A? According to the IPCC report, the trajectory now is completely different and that must give rise to more radical policies by Government and, by extension, the Departments. I want to get a sense of urgency from the witnesses or a sense that these new limit warnings are scary. I would love for us to be able to write a report that says we are satisfied that the OPW, which manages the State property portfolio, is moving more radically towards BER ratings of A and B.
9901	SeanSherlock	Labour	16758.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-24 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	247	 On CFRAM, I am from the great county of Cork. Deputy Eamon Ryan's people were baptised in the River Lee. I was baptised in the Blackwater, metaphorically speaking. We do speak about flood defences and there is very clear evidence of structural works on the Munster Blackwater at Fermoy and Mallow, which are phenomenally successful. For anybody who has any doubts about whether demountable walls work there is incontrovertible proof that they do. Notwithstanding that, the problem for migratory fish and so on, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan has referred, is a slightly different issue, not quite pertinent to this one because it relates to a fish pass in disrepair and is not necessarily in the witnesses' remit. It is important to put that on the record. There are 118 flood relief schemes and flood relief programmes were always designed with the 100 year flood in mind. I was formerly a mayor of my town and when we went through the process we were told we were designing for the 100 year flood. I fail to understand Mr. Adamson's intervention on the planning, maybe I missed something in the dialogue. Have we now surpassed the 100 year flood mark or benchmark in planning for flooding events? Should we now be using agricultural land to slow down flooding and should we be paying farmers who are on flood plains some sort of compensation and telling them not to build on their land, not to plant or graze and allow for natural drainage schemes to take place? That would be a structural solution to flooding and a more natural solution that is not just engineering but another solution in terms of land use.

Did I hear the witness correctly when he said that the cost of a Thames-type barrier structure for Cork would be €1 billion? If that is the figure I heard, has the Office of Public Works, OPW, arrived at it by doing some scenario planning or engineering a solution? The witness did not pluck the figure of €1 billion out of the air. The OPW must have had some internal discussions on that. There is angst in Cork city, which I do not share at this juncture. I differ with my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this one but I have an open mind. As I understand it, the OPW is moving towards a demountable solution. I would like some clarification on that point.

He said that output is outpacing efficiency gains in respect of the national herd. He referred specifically to milk production. In layman's terms, I would like to gain an understanding of how that gap is being narrowed or closed. A question arises if the gap is narrowed and one has maximum efficiency gains, and one is still planning on increasing output. If I understand the interventions correctly, output will keep increasing. We will continue to produce beef and more milk or milk products or derivatives thereof. If that is where we have put our eggs in terms of the market - Dr. O'Mara keeps referring to the market - then how do we close the gap? If we close the gap between efficiency gains and increases in output and if we were trying to peg it out in years, at what stage of the process will we get there? Will it be 2025, 2040, 2050 or 2100 by the time the gap is closed? The IPCC's report has brought what we are facing into stark focus. This morning I got a sense of the work the Department was doing, which is laudable, but there was no great sense of urgency, particularly in forestry and making efficiency gains. I say this because tackling climate change requires resources. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance spoke about the environment efficiency pilot scheme for the beef section, yet I do not know what is the overall figure for the scheme. When one examines the initiative a little, it seems that it will cost €40 per cow and that the weight of cows will have to be recorded at marts. Has the rhetoric at the working groups of the European Union changed owing to the 40% figure in the CAP negotiations? Can the rhetoric be tracked to dialogue within the Department that states, ""If we keep going the way we are, we are going to far surpass the target set of 32.3% for Ireland's overall emissions in agriculture""? I firmly believe we cannot maintain such a trajectory. I am trying to be evidence-based in dealing with this matter. Based on the interventions made today, it seems that there is no way in hell that we will be able reach the figure of 32.3% at the current rate of intervention. It is just an impossibility. I would prefer the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to tell us how much we need in pounds, shillings and pence, outline what policy interventions are needed and how much money is required for same. My last questions are about forestry. If I run out of time, the Secretary General can supply the committee with his answers in writing. Is 18% of the land area of the country under forestry? We are talking about schemes under which farmers will be paid X amount for 15 years. Surely we need to be telling them, ""Do not farm that land any more because this is what we are going to pay you in perpetuity and your antecedents,"" because otherwise, frankly, we are on a hiding to nothing."

If it does not have an answer to that today, it could perhaps provide a note on the process. If we are reflecting the views of the Citizens' Assembly, it had a clear majority in favour of looking after workers in this process. It is clear from the language that it is the company's intention to do so, but it would be useful to add detail. Even a note providing more detail would be welcome. This is a front-line sector in which we face job losses to mitigate the effects of climate change. As such, we are conscious of the need to ensure workers are protected. I would like a note on how the process is being managed, what the end game is, when it is hoped to conclude it and what the projected outcomes are. How many hectares will be deemed to be usable as carbon sinks at the end of the process? I listened with interest to Mr. Shier earlier on some of the challenges in that regard and it would be useful for the committee to have a more detailed note on the potential for carbon sinks. It would help us in the preparation of a final report reflecting the views of the Citizens' Assembly.

This is all about behavioural change and one of the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations sought the establishment of an independent oversight body. Mr. Watt has used language here today of considering what structures might be necessary. Is there an articulation of that vision across Government about what type of structure could be created or would it continue to be housed in a particular Department looking across other departmental silos? Do we need an overarching structure that would benchmark the actions of individual Departments because I take some solace from the two interventions that we have had here today and the fact that there is a clear outlining of a vision in respect of what needs to be done and the urgency of the problem? Frankly, it is the first articulation that I have heard from Departments on the urgency of this. I am trying to deconstruct some of the language that was used. I do not mean this in a pejorative sense but some of the language can be coded such as: ""more stringent central mandates"" and ""least cost abatement options"". This language needs to be simplified if we are to produce a report that is fit for purpose and reflects the Citizens' Assembly's report. The Citizens' Assembly made a recommendation on the establishment of a central, independent body. Are we moving towards a similar structure across Government that would kick the tyres on what individual Departments are doing?"

9955	SeanSherlock	Labour	16779.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	 I am loving this frankness from the Secretary General. Would that all Secretaries General were so frank.
9956	SeanSherlock	Labour	16779.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	176	 How many minutes do I have left?
9957	SeanSherlock	Labour	16779.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	178	 What are Mr. Watt's thoughts on the mechanisms for introducing carbon budgets?
9958	SeanSherlock	Labour	16779.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	 We have spoken about reaching targets and we are already surpassing the 5% reduction in emissions there need to be each year between now and 2050. We are just looking for help in producing the best report we can produce in order that the Government might map onto it.
9959	SeanSherlock	Labour	16779.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	 That concludes our session.

9967	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	88	 I apologise for missing the first part of the witnesses' engagement with the committee. We have other committees to attend also, but I apologise. I thank the representatives for being here today because it is so important that we have the weight of academic opinion in respect of what needs to be done. It will greatly assist us in trying to form a report that responds to this crisis. I am grateful for the witnesses' attendance today. What are the representatives' views on carbon budgets whereby governments or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are allocated a carbon budget and there is also a universal view on what each Department is emitting through its agencies or activities?
9968	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	90	 So there is a precedent whereby-----
9969	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	92	 That is very useful. If there is some paper that would help this committee, it would be very useful for us to see if there is a translational effect into an Irish context.
9970	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	94	 Does Dr. Aubert believe that it is a good model that should be used? I ask the other witnesses to respond also.
9971	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	97	 This is very interesting because again there is a clear example of a city, perhaps we could call it a city state, with autonomy in respect of its own governance. It is clearly working on this topic. Professor Masson-Delmotte states that there would have to be a clear disaggregation between CO2 and other emissions. For people who may be watching these proceedings, what is the reason for that?
9972	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	99	 I see.
9973	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	105	 Does that mean that policy interventions can be designed once a weighting has been given? Would it be possible to say that this is what we need to do in transport, this is what we need to do in agriculture or buildings and whatever it may be?
9974	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	107	 Yes, that is fine.
9975	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	109	 Is that not the point? We have line Departments reporting to this committee. I do not get a sense of that type of urgency, given the timescales involved, in Ireland moving towards carbon budgeting. Perhaps that is something this committee could include in its recommendations. I am also interested to hear the views of Professor Seneviratne on carbon budgeting.
9976	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	111	 On that, if we establish the principle in the first instance, then we can roll it out. It is important that there are examples in Zurich and France that we can look towards. My next question is on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. That is the big beast. In respect of the witnesses' interactions with other governments, academics and entities such as the European Commission, is there a sense that the next CAP will deal with agricultural production in a way that will allow farmers to reshape food chains, to use witnesses' term? Will it also be dealt with in a way that will allow us, in any Irish context, lessen our dependency on intensive farming and move towards policies such as afforestation or horticulture? Do the witnesses have a sense from the early workings on CAP that the European Commission is moving in a particular direction with climate change and agriculture?
9977	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	113	 I thank Dr. Aubert.
9978	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	115	 Is Dr. Aubert hopeful about the schemes being devised by the European Commission? I understand what he is saying about the member states’ application or implementation of those schemes. I would have thought, however, perhaps naively, that the European Commission is realistic now about the challenges member states are facing in respect of climate change. The European Commission, as an entity in and of itself, notwithstanding any critiques I might have of it on other issues, has no other choice now but to make sure there is a proofing mechanism to ensure there is not, as Dr. Aubert put it, a race to the bottom.
9979	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	117	 I thank Dr. Aubert.
9980	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	132	 I have grappled with carbon capture. Is it ethically sound to use it as a policy intervention?
9981	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	134	 I accept that. I would like the professor's opinion.
9982	SeanSherlock	Labour	16786.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-11-21 00:00:00	Business of Committee	138	 I do not understand the third point.

10000	SeanSherlock	Labour	16799.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-04 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	149	 I thank the speakers for appearing before us today. I want to extrapolate a little from the Bord na Móna scenario. For us, it was to be the exemplar for the just transition. It was to be the example to which we could all refer as the big glorious project in which the workers transitioned and were treated fairly. We are getting a very strong sense today, however, that the workers are not getting packages that are commensurate with their years of service. This committee has to take that very seriously. When the Bord na Móna representatives were before us, they spoke about the 11 town hall meetings they had. I hope no gloss or spin was put on that. They spoke about renewable energy projects at a number of wind farms and anaerobic digestion facilities. They spoke about aquaculture and afforestation of 20,000 to 30,000 acres to develop the biomass biochain. Mr. Noone has expressed some views on that. They spoke about recycling and tourism. My question is simple. There was mention of town hall engagement with workers but do workers who are not seeking to subscribe to the voluntary redundancy scheme have a legitimate expectation within Bord na Móna currently to transition to other areas in the company? From the perspective of the congress or SIPTU, is there an expectation among workers that they will be redeployed into one of these areas of activity and there is a legitimate expectation to retain a job or employment?
10001	SeanSherlock	Labour	16799.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-04 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	151	 Are the goalposts being shifted on a constant basis by the management?
10002	SeanSherlock	Labour	16799.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-04 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	153	 I outlined the six activities that were articulated to us. From Mr. Noone's perspective, there is no understanding that workers will transition to these areas of activity.
10003	SeanSherlock	Labour	16799.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-04 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	155	 There is the language of the just transition. It is important for us to acknowledge as a committee that recommendation No. 7 speaks of making proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted. There was an overwhelming mandate. Today's interaction has been very useful and we are now beginning to develop the language of the just transition and tease it out. Does the witness agree with the language of the just transition, what it means and how it would be populated in terms of funding, specifically the types of structures set up? It is very much an iterative process but there must be some formal process and the Government must be a key stakeholder in that. It will take pounds, shillings and pence. If we are talking about the social protection element of the just transition, the State and the Government will have to fund that activity. Taking the Spanish example of transition, €250 million was spent, which is not an insignificant amount of money. We are talking about a serious funding pot that will have to be made available by the Government if we are talking about decarbonising the economy. Does the witness agree with the proposition?
10004	SeanSherlock	Labour	16799.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-04 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	158	 The midlands has a particular geography. Mr. Healy has mentioned deep retrofitting schemes and the housing stock in an area that might have potential. Has congress engaged with the company on the retraining and upskilling potential? Is it something that must be elevated beyond current talks or dialogue with the company on terms and conditions, voluntary redundancies and so on? How do we as a committee take the language of the just transition and deal with a very bespoke example like the peat industry? Rather than speaking rhetorically about what we need to do, what action is required? Is there any activity from agencies in the engagement, or even from academic institutions like Athlone Institute of Technology that could help in figuring out how to transition workers? Is there any experience of that?

He has been very open and engaging. I perceive from him a sense of energy regarding what needs to be done here. With that in mind, is the all-of-Government approach modelled on a Cabinet sub-committee whereby all the line Departments will report directly to the Taoiseach via the Minister's Department?
10016	SeanSherlock	Labour	16800.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-05 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	111	 My view, bearing in mind that I was involved in the action plan for jobs with the Minister, is that having clear metrics to be measured and clear targets is the only way to reach milestones. We now need to start reaching serious milestones. If it is perceived that the mechanism in question is one by which people turn up without identifiable actions, right down to the micro level, it might fail.

The Minister spoke highly of the intervention of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt. Is is envisaged that carbon budgeting will be used as a tool by line Departments to ensure a decarbonisation agenda? Representatives of the IPCC who were before the committee spoke about the successful application of carbon budgets. They gave the example from France. Is it being considered here as a tool?

We would welcome any move towards that. The Minister gave very specific examples, including on market failure and regulatory frameworks. I am sure he is interested in ensuring the deep retrofitting of buildings, including public buildings, private dwellings and schools. We had very positive engagement with the Tipperary Energy Agency. I believe strongly that if the Minister were to visit Nenagh and speak to staff in the agency, he would note three bespoke examples. One is a primary school, one is a municipal health centre and the third is a house. The Tipperary model is a very good stakeholder model based on a social enterprise model. If the Minister could engage on replicating it regionally or right across the country, it would be possible to use the carbon fund, and also possibly the green fund, in a way that would allow a financing instrument to bring the model to fruition.
10021	SeanSherlock	Labour	16800.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-12-05 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	122	 The SEAI is an agency of the Minister's Department. I respectfully ask him to examine the Tipperary model and kick the tyres in that regard. It is an excellent model. The other point relates to the just transition. If the Minister cannot respond now, he can come back to me. The language of the just transition has gained serious traction. It refers to fairness for workers who are moving into a decarbonised society to ensure that there are supports and social protection-type structures put in place so that the transition is just. This matter has been discussed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. Will the Minister consider engaging with ICTU to see if funding similar to that available in Spain and other countries could be put in place? In the mining industry in Spain, for example, a €250 million fund was put in place to assist workers who are getting out of the sector. I am merely putting this on the agenda for further discussion, perhaps offline.

Why is it taking so long for community energy projects and community energy initiatives to get connections to the grid? I am hearing stories of projects which have been waiting for seven to ten years. Why has this not been sorted out?

There is much talk of the front end of what consumers will see and the choices they might have relating to energy supply into their homes. That is fine and wonderful. I have had some briefing from the ESB about smart metering. I want to get to the back end. If we are going to encourage a move towards renewables, we need to hear from the CRU about how it will unlock the regulatory burdens for community energy projects to get on the smart grid, as it has been called, and incentivise people to start producing electricity.

What is that reasonable expectation?

There are 500 MW now being generated and it is approximately 5% of renewable capacity in Scotland. It has hit that specific target. If we can translate a Scottish model into an Irish context, we would be doing a good day's work.

We are grateful for their insights thus far. My question is simple. I will have an interactive session with the deputation, if I may, in the time I have. I want to get a sense from Lord Deben about Brexit and to what extent Brexit is informing his thinking as chairperson in terms of the challenges faced throughout the United Kingdom in the foreseeable future.

This is a feature of the landscape in the United Kingdom. We do not have that system here but we are talking about that system at the moment. It is developing as a concept. There are some signals coming from Government that it might be a way for Government to proceed. I am keen to get a sense or understanding of the dynamic that exists between the UK Prime Minister's office relating to setting targets and how individual UK line Departments measure up to those individual targets. If a Department does not reach a given target or hit a milestone, is there a punitive effect thereafter for individual Departments? It would be useful for those of us on this committee to have a sense or understanding of the dynamics that exist between the UK Prime Minister's office and the actual principle of carbon budgeting in the first instance.

It spoke about creating an independent body above Government with legislative teeth that could put manners, as it were, on individual Departments. The idea was that it would take the matter out of the silo-based system that we all understand so well. Is there merit in that argument?

10057	SeanSherlock	Labour	16842.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-01-16 00:00:00	Third Report of the Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	106	" Somebody once said we should not knock the weather because if it was not for the weather, nine out of ten conversations would never start. The hearings we are having today show a clear obsession with the weather. If one follows that logically, the weather seems to be the mechanism by which one can communicate so much because Irish people are obsessed with it and one can use it as a tool with which to disseminate information to those who may not have a conceptional understanding of what climate change might be. Therein lies an opportunity. I am conscious that we cannot put too much of an onus on RTÉ. The organisation has such a wide remit and only collects so much from the broadcasting fee. It would be easy for us to say RTÉ needs to do more. I note there is an audience council report from 2014 - I do not know whether there has been one subsequently - which showed clearly the need for greater messaging around climate change. We must take in good faith what has been stated here today in respect of the various initiatives in which RTÉ is involved through programming, through Science Foundation Ireland and in inculcating more stories through current affairs programmes such as ""Morning Ireland"". The witnesses will correct me if I am misinterpreting the late Professor Marshall McLuhan's assertion that ""the medium is the message"". I accept that the medium of television and the television schedule are limited. I also accept the point made in respect of the weather slots and whether they present an opportunity to communicate a message. I would contend that is probably not the case. However, if Met Éireann and RTÉ are partnering through the RTÉ Player, they have an infinite opportunity to message to countless numbers of people and therein lies the opportunity. We are all now dependent on the player. I cannot be at home at 9 p.m. or 10 a.m. but I can watch programmes afterwards. The player is a major resource. If we have meteorologists who are talking about the attributional effect - in that regard, we need to do more to use language that ordinary people can understand - and if we have Met Éireann partnering with RTÉ on the player to disseminate bespoke simple messages around the effects of weather patterns in three, four or five minute segments, it would become as popular as a YouTube clip. There is no reason Met Éireann could not use YouTube as a medium as well to get that message out. We have an opportunity here. This meeting has been informative. My question arises from my lack of understanding of how Met Éireann sees its remit. While I understand the partnership with RTÉ and the element of disseminating information, does Met Éireann see its role as being an advocate for messaging around the dire impacts of climate change? In its statement, Met Éireann used the word ""unequivocal"" in relation to the evidence base that exists around climate change. To take that one step further, does Met Éireann see its role as being an interpreter of the science and a disseminator of a message in respect of that? I sense some reticence - the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong - from Met Éireann about its role. I understand the partnership and the dynamic between Met Éireann and RTÉ. We have all come to depend on the weather reports, which are part and parcel of our lives, but I sense some reticence on the part of Met Éireann about where it sees itself in terms of the dissemination of the message to the wider populace. I ask Mr. Moran to correct me if I am wrong."

There are those who are much younger than us who are ahead of us. There are also those who are in our age range and maybe older, who are voters. They are consumers. There is the causal link between weather patterns, the effects of climate change and the heating of the planet which is attributable to human behaviour. If such link were more widely understood it could influence how they make decisions about such matters as how they consume energy and the type of car they drive. Somewhere there is a role for Met Éireann to link the two, for example, where the weather is changing as a result of planet heating that were we to do X it would have a bearing. Deputy Heydon made the point about the daffodils in bloom in January. We were going into the Christmas period at 12°. I asked people older than myself if they ever remembered Christmases of 12° in their living memory. The answer was ""No"". These were people in their 70s. That is not to say it has not happened in the past. That is as a result of the heating of the planet. It has to be, if the science is to be believed. How one links behavioural change with that fact is where Met Éireann has a role to play. The Chairman will forgive me, if I have gone on too long."

For Ms Forbes there is the question of the audience council. I do not understand how it works and do not expect her to answer that question. Was 2014 the last year in which there was an audience council or was there another in the intervening period? If there has been another report in the intervening period, is she getting the same feedback on the need for messaging on climate change? She can revert to me at some other stage on the issue, if she so wishes.

To end on a positive note, there is an inherent trust in Met Éireann, which is a key point and that public trust in Met Éireann is its greatest asset - even though we do not always like the weather reports.

While, by and large, there is a recognition of the €80 per tonne by 2030, which was set out by Professor FitzGerald and others, there is also a need for actions built into the recommendations of this committee to ensure there are plans to ensure that funding is put in place to protect those people who are in fuel impoverished households and, in particular, those who are on low incomes. We are all very mindful of that. I seek clarification from the Chairman on what is actually before us as an amendment. As I understand it, we are to divide on one element of the recommendation, namely, the word ""accepts"" versus ""agrees."" In other words, we either accept the expert advice in favour of this measure from the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory that rises to €80 per tonne by 2030 and that this should be supported in legislation by 2019. The rest of the wording of that paragraph speaks to the issues here in supporting Citizens' Assembly, recognising the negative impacts for people who are on lower incomes and so on, accepts the international consensus around the need for behavioural change and increased investment towards mitigation and away from fossil fuels and agrees that carbon pricing should be ring-fenced. The clarification I am seeking is on whether we are dividing on the issue of whether we accept the 2030 target, as set out by an independent body outside of this House, or whether we can find a mechanism to recognise that target and not divide the committee. There may be a compromise. Instead of using the word ""accepts"" for the expert advice, perhaps we could say that we ""recognise"" the expert advice of the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory. Therefore, we would be acknowledging the outside expertise on this issue and we would be obviating the need to divide the committee on the issue."

I appreciate the points Deputy Bríd Smith is making in respect of the critique of the State's JobPath programme. My worry is that by making that amendment we could dilute recommendation 4(iv) which relates to transitioning people away from carbon production into local economic diversification, where workers themselves become partners in that transition. If they are active stakeholders in that transition, the risk of exploitation, as Deputy Bríd Smith is probably arguing here, is diminished because they are partners in their own transition. That was the point or philosophy behind the ICTU's submission to the committee. I accept the amendment that Deputy Smith is making but I would not want to introduce issues - I will not call them extraneous issues - into the purity of the just transition task force. However, if there is a critique to be had of social protection policy this might not be the chapter or the forum in which to do that. I accept the Deputy's right to bring forward the amendment, but I ask that we do not diminish in any way the success that we have managed to secure in this report through the mere existence of a just transition task force. That is a success in itself. Social protection policy should be critiqued, attacked or changed elsewhere but not necessarily in the forum of this report.

The wording before is: ""The implementation of agreed interventions for transition as developed in the framework should involve a partnership approach involving Government, employers, farmers, trade unions and civil society"". Trade unions are the backbone, specifically as it relates to the midlands. It will move into the farming sector and others. I would have thought the wording, as it stands, would have absolutely negated the opportunity for exploitation because civil society and trade unions were included. Notwithstanding that, if members are landing on a particular view, I will absolutely and utterly support whatever compromise they want to reach."

We would be saying no worker should be forced into a labour activation measure prescribed by the Government against their will or something like it. We have spent hours discussing this issue and I have made it a red line issue from my party's perspective. The idea behind a just transition was that a decision would not be made against a worker without bringing him or her on board, whether he or she was a peat worker in the midlands or working in a carbon intensive industry. No decision would be made over his or her head and he or she would be brought along or part of the movement towards a just transition. I am not against what Deputy Smith is saying. The philosophy is absolutely right, but she is trying to prescribe something very specific. I do not think we should be so prescriptive about JobPath. We can talk about ensuring there would be no exploitation of workers or that no worker would be shoehorned into a scheme that would work against his or her transition or best or personal interests, but I want to ensure we will not lose anything in pursuing the concept of a just transition. I want to try to work with Deputy Bríd Smith and other members to come up with a wording. If we talk about ensuring there would be no exploitation of workers and find such a wording, we can find a compromise.

Is Deputy Bríd Smith saying she is opposed to any kind of labour activation programme? Is she saying that by their nature labour activation programmes, regardless of what they are called, are exploitative because if that is the case, we will have to divide on the issue?
10076	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Third Report of Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	200	 I have been here for a long time, and I understand that people are here to deputise today. I absolutely respect their wishes to compromise. Deputy Bríd Smith has suggested that we divide on this issue. I am happy to discuss this matter further. It will have to be dealt with anyway, and taking it offline is not necessarily going to rectify the matter. I want to say very clear that I accept Deputy Bríd Smith's point about ensuring there is no exploitation of workers in a just transition to a decarbonised economy. We must find a wording that respects the premise but is not so prescriptive about one particular programme, which might cease to exist.

What is the status of the wording in respect of recommendation No. 16, arising from the two votes that we have had? As I understand it now, we have reverted back to the original draft text-----
10078	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Third Report of Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	215	 If we are going to consider this overnight, the question arises as to what can conceivably be done overnight that will amend this or not amend it, as the case may be. Clear political fault lines are now emerging in respect of recommendation No. 16. I am of the view that we should keep going tonight, to be honest but I will listen to what other members have to say on that. I have specific amendments in respect of the contentious wording and would like an opportunity to discuss those further. Unless people are going to come back in here tomorrow with something new or innovative, we are just going to be rehashing the same old arguments again and I am not sure that is the best use of our time.

I am not going to speak for too long on the Labour Party amendment except to say that it seeks to give some power to the standing committee in respect of exploring issues like fuel poverty and the effects of a carbon tax on households. It gives a voice to the committee itself.
10081	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Third Report of Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	232	 My concern is around the fact that we already have had an iterative process here in respect of the issues of fuel poverty and so on. There is scope within the wording of recommendation No. 16, even if we do not take my wording to the letter of the law, to allow for the standing committee, in its ongoing work after the publication of the report, to deal substantively with the issues that we all have in respect of fuel poverty. Again, nobody has been able to clarify for me what it is that will happen overnight. It is only 6.50 p.m. now. I suggest as a compromise that if we are going to meet tomorrow, that we park chapter 6 and try to get the other chapters out of the way this evening. That might be a good way of doing it so that we are not reconvening-----

For example, if I was a general operative in Moneypoint and I went away and retrained as a lawyer or the like, is the amendment saying that everything that applied in the old job should now apply in the new job? I am trying to understand it.

Let us look at all the amendments that are crossed out here. I have a number of amendments, as have other members, that were, for want of a better expression, triaged by the advisers and dealt with at adviser level with political input. My understanding is that these issues may not have come up for discussion. Members can correct me if I am wrong.

The worry I have about the amendment is that industrial jobs will be lost. There is a potential negative impact on prices at the farm gate and, in the co-operative model, there is a risk that employees who are not shareholders, such as accountants, technical advisers, marketing and sales staff, will get the chop if there is a profit warning. These people are living mainly in rural communities and in small and medium-sized towns that are allied to co-ops. By seeking to put in place an inquiry, I would fear that industrial workers in the areas I represent would be the first to be put out of the door. In any case, the wording in the body of the report could facilitate the process of an inquiry where there are specific recommendations by the Department of Finance for public consultation.
10090	SeanSherlock	Labour	16912.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-03-27 00:00:00	Third Report of Citizens' Assembly: Discussion (Resumed)	350	 I want to ensure we will stick to the spirit of the Citizens' Assembly report. We had a specific amendment with a target of approximately 100,000 houses per annum, but as a committee we have settled on a figure of 75,000. I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on ensuring there would be a social element also such that we would not make it too technocratic. That may not be the specific intention, but it could be interpreted in a way that would be too technocratic. We want to ensure we will develop infrastructure that will have the requisite skill set and the pot of money required to do this and set clear targets for retrofitting. The 45,000 target is too low, notwithstanding the fact that in reality far fewer than that number are achieved on an annual basis. There is scope to beef up the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and work with stakeholders such as the Construction Industry Federation and academic institutions to develop short courses, for instance, to try to get more highly skilled graduates into the space to create a demand for retrofitting. We need to create an infrastructure that will ensure the primary user will not face an arcane or overly bureaucratic set of guidelines when he or she applies for a grant. That process should be made as seamless as possible. Our interaction with the Tipperary Energy Agency was very effective because it ensured it acted as an interlocutor with the service provider, the engineers and so on.

To conclude, we should keep the wording in recommendation No. 35 as simple as possible. It is on that basis that I ask Deputy Corcoran Kennedy to consider keeping it as it is.

I wonder if the two can be separated and whether there can be compromise regarding the amendments. If we have to recommend that all current transport infrastructure programmes be revised, I imagine the assumption is a revision downwards or away from investment in some of the projects Deputy Neville, for example, outlined. The people I represent rely heavily on cars. Deputy Eamon Ryan hopes there will be a transition from diesel and petrol cars to hybrids and electric vehicles, EVs. He is hoping that will happen as soon as possible and transport will be decarbonised in that way. My fear is that large infrastructural projects will be taken off of the table. I refer to those necessary to move people and sustain their livelihoods. These projects are required to allow people get to their places of work, to college and to hospitals to access medical appointments and services. The transition from car to bus or train will not happen quickly enough if we start questioning or recommending another mechanism. I would like to see the standing committee take part of this amendment and have robust engagement on what a 2:1 ratio actually means. I refer to having real analysis of that suggestion and bringing in witnesses regarding what that means. I am broadly in favour of what Deputy Eamon Ryan is trying to achieve. It would mean having to axe current infrastructure projects in the short term, however. That could have a detrimental impact on livelihoods. What the Deputy is proposing can be done in Dublin, Limerick or Galway. I am not sure it can be done in the towns and villages in between those cities. I would like to keep an open mind, however. I would also like the standing committee to engage further on this matter, if we are keeping in line with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly."

While we are talking technically about amendments that are on the table to be agreed or voted upon, the Labour Party has two very specific amendments Nos. 26 and 27. On the basis of the agreed text that has now come forward - agreed by the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party, we are now happy to withdraw our amendments. We feel that the proposal of the compromise for mechanisms to be put in place to look at how carbon taxes would affect those people in fuel impoverished houses - and that a mechanism is put in place so the most vulnerable people are protected - means we can sign up to this. At this stage, I am quite happy to withdraw amendments No. 26 and 27.

Carbon tax is in existence and yields approximately €400 million but that €400 million goes to the Exchequer. This committee is seeking to ring-fence moneys collected from the tax so that retrofitting can be done and we can transition from carbon to meet our targets. If we agree to this amendment the Government would conduct a review, to be completed by June 2019, of what may be the most appropriate measure and what is the nature and extent of fuel poverty across all cohorts. We are building into the amendment a set of measures that seeks to protect the most vulnerable but ensures that we do not move until the review has been done. June 2019 may be too short a timeframe and it may need to be pushed out to July. It is important that we study what is in the amendment first, before we draw any conclusions.

The issue now before us is that the text of the stand-alone amendment that Deputy Bríd Smith has put forward seems to have changed, and subsequently additional wording must be brought forward to reflect the amendment she seeks to have as a Standing Order.

10157	SeanSherlock	Labour	16996.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-19 00:00:00	Climate Action Plan: Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment	95	 I apologise for being late. I was chairing a meeting of another committee. I thank the Minister for attending. I hope we can have a further engagement with him on a line-by-line basis, if time allows, at some future date. Our committee has 42 recommendations, whereas 183 actions are outlined in the Government's report. I perceive a gap between the all-party committee's recommendations and the Government's position. Notwithstanding the positive aspirations in its approach, I hope the entire Government can work with the joint committee to iron out some of the gaps. One such gap relates, as Deputy Pringle indicated, to the relevant legislation. There is a sense of urgency on the part of the joint committee in respect of the need to put in place, sooner rather than later, a legislative base for the legally-binding targets leading to 2030 and, thereafter, the net zero target for 2050, which is one of the recommendations. I am a little concerned that the Government's approach means that a Bill might not be published until next March and that it would not be enacted until the end of 2020. Another year could conceivably pass before we address the binding targets. The Minister might comment on that point. The second and probably more important aspect relates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 60 million tonnes to 33 million by 2030. In the Government's plan, I do not see clear metrics on how we will do this and adhere to the 2030 targets. Respectfully, having worked with the Minister in other Departments and knowing what he has delivered, I am worried that there might be slippage and that we might overshoot the 2030 targets in favour of an aspiration to net zero by 2050. By 2030, however, we may still be far off target for our commitments under the Paris Agreement of 2015. I wonder whether there should be a greater sense of urgency for clear, bespoke actions. For community energy, rural transport, active travel and the rewetting of peatlands, for example, my fear is that within the Government, there will be a siloed approach, without a proper reporting mechanism or smacht for individual Departments to deliver on those actions. If there is not a properly overarching Cabinet sub-committee or a robust climate action delivery board, I worry that Departments will slip in their obligations to deliver on climate action. Respectfully, it is not enough for the Government to appear before the committee and say it is for, say, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to examine the rewetting of peatlands in view of the fact that we already have evidence, through our deliberations in the committee, that only 1% of peatlands in Ireland are under rehabilitation or restoration. I would like to hear the whole-of-Government approach to that rather than having to wait from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

In summary, will the Minister comment on the delays in legislation, primarily due to a lack of urgency, and the fact that the targets for 2030 have been overshot, which is a deep worry? Will there be a proper whole-of-Government approach to carbon budgeting and clear repercussions if individual Departments do not deliver? What is the legislative basis to enforce the legally-binding targets?

If we disseminate information for public discourse, Opposition Members like me will ask how the 60 million tonnes of emissions will be reduced to 33 million, which is the most important metric.

10163	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 This has been very interesting so far. I thank the witnesses for their contributions because they have certainly broadened my perspective regarding the issue of cycling and what can be delivered. From listening to the witnesses, one thing strikes me. There seems to be a common denominator based on my interpretation of what they said. If we look at Cambridge, Brussels or Manchester, we can see there is a cultural shift in the mindset of policymakers at ground, local authority and government level towards wanting to make this happen. They are now embracing this as a concept and clear policy provision. The challenge we face in this country involves shifting the psychology towards creating the infrastructure. What is it that Brussels can do? I lived in Brussels and used to cycle everywhere. I could move from the city centre to the countryside in Flanders. It is effectively cycling heaven because the cyclist is king or queen. It is a mindset that favours the cyclist whereas in this country, the car is king or queen. If I have a car, I have the God-given right to go anywhere and own the public thoroughfare, and everybody else is incidental to my enjoyment of my vehicle. How do we get policymakers at local authority level to shift their thinking away from designing infrastructure? Based on my experience as a former member of a local authority and a Member of this House, I can say that everything was designed by engineers. I do not want to criticise engineers in any way but they think in straight lines from A to B and there is no input from architects or town planners. What advice can the witnesses give us in respect of seeking to shift that mindset within the local authority paradigm? Where do we get the paradigm shift?
10164	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	 Mr. Deegan pulls in advocates and the Chris Boardmans of this world because they are influencers - stars, so to speak, to borrow that awful phrase that has been used by Mr. Johnson and his like - to begin to change the mindset and to begin to influence politicians, and then we see it flowing within the system, as it were.
10165	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	 I would love to talk forever but I have only five minutes. Could I hear about the Brussels and Cambridge experience because Cambridge is a university town while Brussels is, arguably, a cosmopolitan university city that is very international? I imagine that it is easier to roll out cycling infrastructure in a place with a lot of students. The witnesses talk about the Cambridge busway and cycleways project, which involves moving out into rural areas. It is a bit like Galway where the car is still king but many students use their bikes and one can plan accordingly because there is a population base for cycling that demands facilitation. The demand is there. How did the federation get the local authority in Cambridge to buy into what it is doing? I imagine that it is easier there than in a city such as Manchester or London.
10166	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	 Can that tool be plugged into any scenario?
10167	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	49	 The Netherlands has reached 7%. Are the local authorities driving that or is it the government?
10168	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	 On that note, the joint committee is adjourned until Wednesday, 10 July. I thank the witnesses for coming before us.

10173	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	104	 No, thank you.
10174	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	145	 I wish to come back to financing and scalability, which are the two elements to this that I can discern. If questions about finance have already been asked and answered-----
10175	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	147	 How can we get banks and credit unions to finance this opportunity for people living in typical 1970s bungalows? Such people might have some savings and can benefit from the SEAI grant. However, they still fall short of the a cost of a deep retrofit or a better energy solution. How do we fill that final piece of the pie? I have not been able to figure that out. The credit union movement and the Irish League of Credit Unions have talking about getting into this space. I imagine the banks could not care less about this space. However, relatively small loans could be scaled up to achieve a lot.
10176	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	149	 That is the first question.
10177	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	151	 Yes, please.
10178	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	155	 I appreciate that. There is more work to be done around financing but at least we can take some empirical models from the SEAI research. I welcome Mr. Tom Parlon back to the House, if that has not been done already. I am sure it has. I refer to Part L of the building regulations and the skill set needed for retrofitting. A finite pool of labour is available for construction in Ireland at present but that is going to ramp up. I have a two-part question. First, how will the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others train the type of people the Tipperary Energy Agency is supplying in order to meet the demand?
10179	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	157	 As I said at the outset, for efficiency's sake if my questions have been answered already the witnesses need not answer them. The second question concerns Part L of the building regulations. We have discussed nearly zero energy buildings. What is the energy fit in these buildings? Is it boilers, advanced boilers or heat exchangers? What is the CIF's interpretation of Part L for new builds? My fear is that solar and heat exchangers might not be part of it. Is there any thinking within CIF on that?
10180	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	161	 That is the challenge. We are now going to load the grid. We will effectively use fossil fuels to add more power to the grid to meet the targets from a building perspective. At the same time, there will be an exponential increase in the amount of fossil fuel we use to keep the grid going. I am playing devil's advocate now-----
10181	SeanSherlock	Labour	17017.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-07-10 00:00:00	Housing and Retrofitting: Discussion	104	 I thank the witnesses for attending. As there is no other business, the joint committee is adjourned until after the recess.

10189	SeanSherlock	Labour	17101.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-02 00:00:00	Citizen and Community Measures: Discussion	95	 I am delighted to be in the presence of the gentlemen from Tipperary again. One of the committee's first actions was to visit Tipperary and it was a very useful tutorial for us. Speaking for myself, I was largely ignorant of the work that was being done by the Tipperary Energy Agency and we certainly learned a great deal from that visit. I am not sure how long ago that was, but if we are to be honest it would appear that little or no progress in furthering the agenda has been made in that time. Having said that, we have an opportunity, through this interaction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, to ensure that when it develops proposals for the next round of connection policy on its electricity connection policy, ECP-2, to quote the witness, it engages formally or informally with the Tipperary Energy Agency to benefit from the insights of the Tipperary Energy Agency and its constituent parts. One cannot design community-led energy projects without talking to the Tipperary Energy Agency. That is self-evident and quite obvious from our interaction so far. I am very much taken with the approach of the Tipperary Energy Agency. I would describe it as democratising energy supply. It provides a mechanism by which communities, particularly rural dwellers, can feel they have a stake in providing energy. Regarding wind energy, for instance, an opaque community dividend that the big players mete out to individual communities can be intangible for many individual households. They do not necessarily see the benefit of it. Instead of that, this model means that people are part-owners of the turbines they see going up. That is something they have a stake in. Starting from that premise, we have to work back and devise a model that ensures democratisation of energy supply. That is an opening remark. The climate action plan is now very clear on microgeneration policy. If I can walk away from today's meeting with a commitment from the stakeholders to engage with each other, the committee will have done a good day's work. Other speakers have already made that point. Our committee recommendations were very clear on the solar and photovoltaic element. If I recall correctly, we wanted to see progress on ensuring that farms or individuals could use solar power by March 2020, with the relevant statutory instrument amended to overcome that hurdle. I am surprised to hear that this process has not been expedited. That is something that we as a committee could take up directly with the Minister, perhaps through the Chair. The Chairman may already be engaging with the Minister on that issue. Achieving that could provide the Trojan horse that is necessary for farms in particular, which can accommodate bigger solar arrays because of barns, outbuildings and so forth, to realise this potential. I suggest the committee write to the relevant line Minister to see where that stands. The Chair may have a view on it.
10190	SeanSherlock	Labour	17101.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-02 00:00:00	Citizen and Community Measures: Discussion	97	 If that is possible.
10191	SeanSherlock	Labour	17101.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-02 00:00:00	Citizen and Community Measures: Discussion	99	 We could then respond and it would be a matter of public record.

10194	SeanSherlock	Labour	17101.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-02 00:00:00	Citizen and Community Measures: Discussion	105	 I do not have too many questions to ask. Regarding smart metering, Deputy Eamon Ryan gave me my very first smart meter in 2008, when he rolled out the pilot scheme as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The smart meter is now in a box somewhere in my attic. We have been talking about smart metering in this country for well over ten years. I welcome the move by ESB Networks, but I wonder if we could learn a little more about where the pilot scheme stands. I do not mean that the witnesses must report back now. It would be useful if we could have a further engagement with ESB Networks. Bandon and Portlaoise are the two towns involved. If we are talking about behavioural change, which is ultimately what this committee is all about, I would hope for ambition for a greater roll-out on the part of ESB Networks and the regulator.

10207	SeanSherlock	Labour	17115.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-16 00:00:00	Climate Change Advisory Council Annual Review 2019: Discussion	44	 I will do some rapid fire questioning, if the Chairman does not mind. Professor FitzGerald is looking hale and hearty before his impending birthday. I congratulate him as he has been a great figure on the public landscape and he has always spoken with a great degree of common sense. It is very easy to listen to what he has to say as it is always based on common sense. I want to speak to the binary argument of beef versus forestry. Given the years of experience, what is the perspective of Professor FitzGerald? That is either wearing the Climate Change Advisory Council hat or the professor hat. Can horticulture drive a wedge into that binary argument and force us to think more laterally about what food we are producing and land use? Can we get a short perspective on that from Professor FitzGerald to begin with?
10208	SeanSherlock	Labour	17115.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-16 00:00:00	Climate Change Advisory Council Annual Review 2019: Discussion	46	 Does the Climate Change Advisory Council have a mandate to look at that?

What would such legislation look like? If the Climate Change Advisory Council were to legislate for this tomorrow morning, what would it advise the Government to do? What would that legislation look like? Would it be highly prescriptive on the trajectory? Would it set out a certain price for every year leading up to a given target?
10211	SeanSherlock	Labour	17115.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-10-16 00:00:00	Climate Change Advisory Council Annual Review 2019: Discussion	52	 My next question relates to the financing of climate action. It is difficult for us as Members to draw a line under what is currently allocated for climate action. The whole philosophy is based on behavioural change. The people I represent are not in a position to switch from a diesel engine to a fully electric engine. They are not in a position to spend between €50,000 and €80,000 retrofitting a 1970s bungalow. If we are talking about financing, incentives have to be provided. Local authority housing has extraordinary potential to take carbon out of the atmosphere. What would a scheme look like? Has the Climate Change Advisory Council given consideration to the cost of such a scheme? Has it looked at the entirety of the local authority housing stock in the country? We are starting with a project in the midlands, for which €20 million has been provided. We all absolutely welcome that, but I represent the people of Cork East. There are many people in Cork East living in local authority houses who do not believe they are eligible for such schemes. It is a question of how we incentivise private homeowners and those in local authority houses. I put it to Professor FitzGerald that if we do not have an entire figure for what has been allocated to retrofit houses, it is difficult to do an assessment of what we could allocate per house. Does the advisory council have a perspective on how we would finance that? I suggest that it must be part grant and possibly part savings. It is conceivable that when people reach a certain age, for example, when their children have flown the nest, there may be a few bob in the credit union. Maybe we could combine a grant, part savings and part loan. Has the advisory council given some thought to this?

I will set out a preamble before asking some very specific questions. Very few of us think about climate action in the context of the global north and the global south. My experience as a former Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made me conscious that the actions in the global north have a massive effect on the global south. I am taken by what Professor Sweeney said about Ireland's contribution to the Green Climate Fund. I contend, however, that Irish Aid, through its partnership with the key partner countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, has been instrumental and a key driver in negotiating the financing round in Addis Ababa, leading to New York. Ethiopia has been a key international player in driving programmes such as the Productive Safety Net Programme, which offsets against the worst ravages of climate change. My point is that while we may be deemed to be climate laggards on the one hand, we seem to be leaders on the other in ensuring there are protective programmes for the global south, with which we have key relationships. I would like Professor Sweeney's perspective on this. Perhaps there is in the Irish position a dichotomy between being very proactive in ensuring the global south has some protections and being way behind when it comes to our own actions. I wish to defend Ireland's position on the global south and seek Professor Sweeney's perspective on that. I seek that perspective before asking further specific questions.
10222	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Conference of the Parties, COP, 25: Discussion	14	 I seek to be educated on the Article 6 rules, which are the focus of the suspended COP in Chile. I do not understand the so-called accounting mechanisms and modalities for a new form of international integration of carbon markets and offsetting to ensure carbon markets can support countries in enhancing the ambitions of their stated climate actions. Could somebody please distil that for me and the people I represent? Instinctively, I believe it is a key driver but I would like to hear from the witnesses what it means in layman's terms. What does it mean for Ireland in terms of its obligation to adhere to the Article 6 rules?
10223	SeanSherlock	Labour	17136.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-11-06 00:00:00	Conference of the Parties, COP, 25: Discussion	16	 Has anybody written a paper in layman's terms, for digestion by those who are not well versed in Article 6, on the very dynamic Professor Sweeney is talking about? It would be useful for this committee to have sight of views and interpretations such as those of Professor Sweeney. I acknowledge what Ms Higgins, Ms Sharkey and Mr. Coghlan, but particularly Mr. Coghlan, are saying about engaging with the Minister on the points raised here. We will have an opportunity to do that in December.

10229	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	78	 We have had much to contemplate today because the submissions from each of the constituent parties here have been very thought-provoking. I will start with Forest Industries Ireland. I was pleasantly surprised by the submission we received because if I interpret it correctly, there is a very clear message from Forest Industries Ireland involving a reaching out to all other stakeholders in respect of a vision for forestry for the future. I perceive - correct me if I am wrong - that there is a tension between the forestry industry and people in NGOs who are advocating for mixed use, greater use of broadleaf species and mixed forests, and there is an ongoing battle involving the dreaded conifer and so on. Am I interpreting Forest Industries Ireland's statement correctly when I state that there is a mood within Forest Industries Ireland that wishes to reach out to those NGOs and a broader set of stakeholders to have that engagement to see if there can be some meeting of minds regarding what the future looks like?
10230	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	80	 We need actions to follow the statements that are made here. If there was a clear offer on the part of IBEC, Forest Industries Ireland, FII, or the relevant NGOs to start this process with some sort of summit on the future, that would be a very good result. I would welcome that. The second issue concerns the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the multi-annual financial framework. I do not know what stage it has reached or where forestry sits in that. Farmers are arguably farming to schemes. We recognise that from a social and cultural point of view it is very difficult for farmers to give up farming livestock if they have been doing so for three or four generations and switch to afforestation. I take the point made by the two doctors about the proportion of a given holding that is given over to forestry. Is there scope within the next round of CAP and the next multi-annual financial framework to have clear schemes and financial packages to incentivise climate action among farmers on this island? That could include afforestation or biodiversity measures. Is it the understanding of Mr. Moore or Mr. Hayes that the CAP is moving in the direction of incentivising climate action on the part of farmers and landowners?
10231	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	82	 We will keep our answers brief. Where is CAP at the moment? What is the current position of the negotiations?
10232	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	84	 I refer to the COFORD Council. Can the witnesses disabuse me of my perception that the COFORD Council is nothing but a talking shop and that no real policy interventions arise from it? Can they disabuse me of the perception that if the COFORD Council was working properly we would have increased forestry cover and stakeholders, including the very NGOs that I spoke about previously, would be triaging the issues we are talking about today to a much greater degree? There would be real policy outcomes, real delivery of climate measures and the potential of the forestry sector would be realised.
10233	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	86	 I will start with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but I will go around the houses.
10234	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	88	 I would like to hear from Coillte after that.
10235	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	92	 Could I hear from Coillte on that? I know that organisation is a stakeholder.
10236	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	 In my remaining ten seconds I would like to ask about Coillte's six regional strategic plans. My understanding is that under the climate action plan Coillte is committed to replanting or restocking a total of 34,770 ha between 2016 and 2020. Is that effort on target? Moreover, the witnesses mentioned that 20% of the estate is managed for biodiversity. Will that be extended across that 34,770 ha?
10237	SeanSherlock	Labour	17171.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-12-11 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	78	 I thank all the witnesses for coming before us this afternoon.

10245	SeanSherlock	Labour	17492.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	" I thank the Chairman for affording me the opportunity to join the committee today. This debate has been really useful and proved to be a very useful tutorial for somebody such as myself. On the role of local authorities, in the wording of the legislation is there insufficient direction given to local authorities on the interpretation of national climate action plans and how they translate at the most local level into adaptation and mitigation measures? Does either witness have a view on the role of local authorities? Does the wording need to be buttressed or tightened up? I see a role for local authorities. Transport and housing are two key elements of taking carbon out of the equation so the role of local authorities would be important. Slightly tangential to that is the role of public participation. If there is a facility for local authorities to invite members of the public to make submissions then that could be an opportunity for the citizen to engage at the most local level. Can consideration be given to tightening up the wording? Do the witnesses have a perspective on the wording? We have a climate change advisory committee and there is the Committee on Climate Change in the UK. Let me explain the way I look at the Irish committee. The Professor John FitzGeralds of this world keep us honest. By that I mean, when they talk people listen because they do not have a ""political"" agenda. To what extent does the UK Houses of Parliament view the UK Committee on Climate Change? Does it have a real beneficial impact in terms of influencing policymakers and Government? Can we learn form the UK experience? Can we translate the lessons learned into a legislative text here that gives greater weight to the Irish climate change advisory committee such that it has more power, better powers of intervention and the power of persuasion? My questions are more philosophical but the witnesses might have perspectives on them. Finally, I thank both of the witnesses for their submissions to the committee."
10246	SeanSherlock	Labour	17492.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2020-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	 If the witnesses can send in their observations in writing regarding the question of offsetting, we would welcome that.

I also appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State. I will start with the Minister of State's last comment to the effect that the Government of the day had accepted the anti-fracking legislation. It was passed with the goodwill of the Members of the House on a unanimous basis. There were no dissenting voices. If one takes the view that fracking, by its very nature, is subject to licences and exploration, a term I use loosely, it is surely the case that the same concept and understanding could be applied to exploration offshore. Is that not the case? That is my first question.
10248	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	129	 The principles the Government applied in dealing with the issue of fracking and its support, as the Minister of State stated, for anti-fracking legislation included issues related to climate action, the injurious effect on the environment and the disturbance caused for communities. At least two of these three principles can be applied to the Bill under discussion.
10249	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	131	 I take the point made by the Minister of State. However, if revenues forgone from the issue of licences is the justification for requiring a money message to prevent the Bill from proceeding to the next Stage, why was the same principle not applied to the fracking legislation?
10250	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	133	 There were licences. Why is the same principle that was applied to the anti-fracking legislation not being applied to this Bill if the Government of the day had, in fact, issued the licences in the first instance?
10251	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	135	 I am not sure I accept that answer which warrants further exploration. However, I realise we do not have a great deal of time. My second question is related to the process of examining what defines a money message for the purpose of allowing a Bill to proceed to the next Stage. I do not intend to get into an interpretation of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, except to say there is a memorandum of understanding between all Members of the House and the Government of the day on Private Members' Bills. It is arguable that the Government has contravened the spirit of that memorandum of understanding and it is arguable that it has been disrespectful to the individual Members of this House who have brought forward legislation. What is the process, in the simplest terms? I do not understand what the Minister of State needs to do to define this for the purposes of justifying the Government's argument on what needs to be done to deliver or not on the money message. What does the Minister of State need to do to justify his position with regard to the requirement for a money message?
10252	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	137	 The Ceann Comhairle has determined that a money message is required. That is my understanding. For a money message to be delivered on, it is not the Ceann Comhairle who will go and do that business but the Government. What needs to be done to deliver the money message or not deliver it, depending on the Minister of State's justification? I suspect the Government has already made its decision and is seeking now to quash this legislation.
10253	SeanSherlock	Labour	16988.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-11 00:00:00	Financial Implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018: Discussion	139	 What does that mean?

What criteria does the Government use in making that decision? Does it look at the opportunity cost forgone in respect of licences? What is the process? If I introduce legislation about health or education and I am told that it requires a money message because there is a charge on the Exchequer, whether a first order charge or an incidental charge, if I am the proposer of the legislation, surely I am entitled to know exactly what the Government intends to do with the legislation that I have drafted, as per Deputy Smith's contention, and how the Government intends to deliver the money message? What is the process and mechanism that the Government must now follow to decide on a money message? If that question cannot be answered, then I would contend that there has been a subversion of the democratic process here.

It would be useful for me as a Member of this House to understand that process, which I do not understand.

I am seeking to understand, within the Minister of State's line Department, the criteria when the Secretary General or assistant secretary generals and principal officers sit down to go through this process. We must now report to the Dáil on our decision about the delivery of a money message. What are the criteria about the decision on the delivery of a money message? What criteria are we setting out internally for the justification of our position, regardless of what that is? I do not expect the Minister of State to answer that now.

It is worthwhile, because we have a Minister of State in front of us, to question the Minister of State in respect of the internal dynamics of the process of examining the money message procedure from his Department's point of view. The Ceann Comhairle has written on this. The Department must now respond.

I contend that it is a geopolitical issue. Organisations such as Trócaire are advocating on behalf of this legislation. It is an organisation that is funded from the public purse, which seeks to bridge the divide between the global north and the global south. It seeks to advocate on issues such as the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals and in respect of how the global north does its business and how that has a significant impact on the poorest people living on the planet. I suggest that this legislation is germane to this very issue and that is a point I want to address with regard to Senator O'Reilly's earlier point. It is very germane to a geopolitical context.

10279	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	76	" I am the last person standing and many of my questions have been answered so I will not detain the witnesses or the Chairman. I thank the delegation as this has been a very clear-headed and lucid presentation that has gone a long way towards helping my understanding of the matter, and particularly the timelines. It was a very good idea to give us the timelines in respect of the company's involvement with the national broadband plan. There is a very clear message from the witnesses that it was two years ago and they are talking about the future. It is a very unambiguous message. Having said that, I might detain the witnesses a while longer to help my understanding of the engagement with the Department up to the point in September 2017 when SIRO withdrew from the process. I am trying to imagine myself in the room where SIRO is engaging with the Department after the mapping exercise has been done and there is a revised intervention area. How did it come about that the company decided it was out and finished with the process? Is it because, as the witnesses stated earlier, the revenue reduction was such that it would just make it untenable? Was there any profit or return on investment where it could be said that even with the 542,000 premises in the amber area, the company could still persevere with the process? I may not be putting it across very clearly but what would it have taken for SIRO to have stayed in the game? That is the kernel of my question. Mr. O'Leary has stated ""it would also have led to a much bigger reduction in revenue and thus our overall potential target revenues were significantly reduced also"". He also outlined the Mitchelstown example, which is fairly close to home for me, and the doughnut effect. At what point did the company say ""that is it, we are gone"". There was engagement and the witnesses have said it was a positive engagement with the Department. The company had just seen 300,000 connections being taken up by another entity so what would it have made this commercially viable for the company? I still cannot fully grapple that. Personally, I found it a pity that SIRO pulled out because of its international reputation, which was mentioned earlier, and the ability to get projects done in a very seamless and quick fashion. That is why there was a certain amount of disappointment."
10280	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	78	 That is what I cannot understand.
10281	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	81	 What I cannot reconcile is that there was a de facto change in the process. The tender process was designed to deliver X number but the numbers changed. They were reduced because of the actions of another entity. I would have thought there was a clear justification for all bidders to sit down at that juncture with the Department and say that the process had changed. The terms of the other parties may have been reasonable because of those material changes. I cannot reconcile the justification of the Department in saying that parties are in the middle of a tender process and there are restrictions in what can be said, etc. I will refer to the current roll-out of services from SIRO. There were 242,000 homes passed and by virtue of this, there is potential for them to be enabled.
10282	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	83	 The company has made 42,000 connections to customers.
10283	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	85	 Is there a metric of cost per house?
10284	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	87	 That is fine. I can appreciate that it might be commercially sensitive. The company's aim is 450,000 connections.
10285	SeanSherlock	Labour	17003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2019-06-26 00:00:00	National Broadband Plan: Discussion (Resumed)	89	 I have absolutely internalised that as Mr. O'Leary said it in earlier interventions. If my constituent is supposedly encapsulated within the 300,000 connections to be provided by Eir but is in the last house on the link and is waiting for months on end or put on the never-never, is there potential for him or her to be included in the 450,000 connections that SIRO envisages?

Starting with the individual family support plans, I had a parliamentary question on this issue answered by Mr. O'Regan. It was dated 24 May 2022. In that question, I asked the Minister of Health the number of individualised family service plans issued and accepted by each CDNT, broken down by CHO area. The response I got was that the individual family support plan process is a live one, in that the team and family keep it under review while service supports and strategies are being implemented and as the needs and achievements of the child and family change. Is the output of the individual family support plans being measured as this process is being rolled out? Where I am going with this question is towards trying to get at the experience of the family that interfaces with the service.
10294	SeanSherlock	Labour	18075.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2022-06-02 00:00:00	Joint Meeting with Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth	33	" On this same issue, we have now created another bolt-on aspect to the experiences of the family and the child. The experiences of families of which I am aware, whether we like it or not, reflect a lack of confidence in the service. Families are afraid that they are being sent down yet another road and to another service that they must sign up to get access to services. I am not going to be rhetorical. I just ask the HSE to be mindful of this point and if it can do that, it would be good. We know what the experiences of families are. We all know they are jaded now. Let us take that as a given. We all accept that. If I dovetail the individual family support plan process now with the creation of the CDNTs, then this is again about measurement. Turning to Ms O'Neill, another parliamentary question I submitted asked ""the number of children that have been transferred from Children's Disability Network Team back to primary care on foot of assessments since April 2021, by age, CHO and LHO in tabular form and general categorisation for such a transfer back to primary care operations"". Ms O'Neill's response to me stated, ""Though there is no specific timeline on when the system will be available, I can confirm that there has been a procurement process and the system is now at the development stage."" Again, we do not have a live measurement of the families' experience as they are going through the system. They are again being asked to sign up to a CDNT process and they are wondering how many more arguably bureaucratic processes they will have to go through before they can get access to the speech and language therapist, SLT, the occupational therapist, OT, the psychologist and all the therapy services. Do the witnesses appreciate where I am coming from in this regard? We must ensure that parents and children are minded in this context. The bottom line in all of this is still access to the services, notwithstanding all the issues we are talking about here concerning recruitment, which is, effectively, the big elephant in the room. I just want to hear from witnesses from the HSE that they are going to be careful and mindful of families in this process."

Do we know how many therapists, by their designation as SLTs and OTs, have left the CDNTs since January 2022? If we know the answer to that question, do we know if those people have been replaced? What is the status of the individual files? I ask this because, again, we have the child interfacing with a service, and he or she has already started to do so in these cases. One person who was a part of delivering that service then leaves, for all sorts of appropriate reasons, and, suddenly, that child and the family are left in limbo. They do not know where they stand. I will ask my fourth question and then I will be done.

If I am reading Mr. Reid and the Minister of State correctly concerning the need to address the imbalance here on the pay parity side, there is a responsibility, and I say this respectfully, on the Government to engage with the trade unions and the representatives of employees to address this subject. I say this because, and the Co-Chair will attest to this, we have a facility in north County Cork, namely, St. Joseph's Foundation located at Cooleens House, and every time I submit a parliamentary question - and there is a plethora of them now - the response I get back refers to the problem of recruitment and being unable to recruit. My fear is that what has happened is that people have moved over from one service to another, because, whether people like it or not, there is this perception that there is this type of Darwinian system where the HSE has recruited and taken on people from section 38 and 39 organisations because of better terms and conditions. If we do not address this aspect, we will be at nothing.

I refer to the specific question I had about what happens in a CDNT when somebody leaves and there is a live file. What happens to the file? What is the legitimate expectation of the child and his or her family in respect of that file? I need an answer to that question because I have cases where that has happened. The second point I made that was not addressed was pay inequalities. Mr. Reid said he met with the section 39 organisations, I think he said specifically. I would like to know what the nature of those discussions were and whether the issue of pay parity and equality of pay came up. There is an elephant in the room here. I referenced St. Joseph's Foundation but it is one of many service providers where the same thing is happening, namely, they cannot open services and they remain closed because the providers cannot recruit. I am being told they cannot because they are competing with the HSE. I would like to hear from Mr. Reid about how the HSE intends to grasp the nettle on that one and where the Minister of State is then as far as ensuring we have parity is concerned. Deputy Tully was here earlier and opened up with that very point. We need to address that point. I would like some response from-----

I thank the delegation from the HSE, the Minister of State and officials from the Department for being here. This has been a joint meeting aimed at trying to address the issue under discussion. It is important that it has been accepted here this morning there are failures in respect of children right across the spectrum. When I took the job of Chair of my committee, I stated that the Taoiseach would go before the Houses to apologise for the way the State has treated children with disabilities. That was evident from the meeting. A number of themes have arisen on what needs to be done. At the very outset of the questions I thought there might have been an HSE versus the Department of Health discussion as to what legislation needs to be changed and what needs to be done. From the way the meeting has gone, however, it is clear the recruitment drive needs to be made to ensure, as regards the teams that are being proposed,that we have the recruitment of full teams and the retention of staff. I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed. They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things. That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations. As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services. We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained. We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain. We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services. The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services. I made the point in the Dáil yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well. On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here. The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this. We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this. We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in. That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that. I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.

I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed. They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things. That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations. As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services. We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained. We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain. We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services. The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services. I made the point in the Dáil yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well. On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here. The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this. We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this. We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in. That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that. I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.

10310	SeanSherlock	Labour	12795.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	 I am not sure if I am in order proposing that which I am about to propose.  The role of ComReg in broadband could be examined.  When I table a question to the Minister with regard to a specific location I am told that it is an operational matter for the various service providers.  Given that it is Government policy to roll out broadband and achieve maximum penetration, does ComReg have a role and where does it lie in respect of this committee?
10311	SeanSherlock	Labour	12795.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-18 00:00:00	Prelude	27	 We will go through each of the regulators to regulate the way in which the regulators regulate.

We are in a new era of regulations and several regulators have not been in the job for long.  This is an opportune juncture to examine how they perform.  I am mindful of the plethora of quangos which have sprung up in recent years.  A key role of this committee will be to pull it all back and ensure bodies are held to account and regulators do a decent job.

10315	SeanSherlock	Labour	12844.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 I am happy, if the Chairman so wishes, to allow Mr. Doherty to field these wide ranging questions at this stage.  I would come in later if that is all right?
10316	SeanSherlock	Labour	12844.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 I will be brief.  I thank the commissioners for their presentation.  I am probably typical of most people in not being a technophile, although neither am I a technophobe.  I have a BlackBerry and access to all the communications I need, which I am fortunate that my position in this House allows but which is not typical of everybody.  There is a glaring disparity between those who will eventually be able to avail of the next generation networks and others, many of whom I represent in a mixed urban and rural constituency, who must still dial up to gain access to broadband.  If ComReg's modus operandi is one which seeks to protect the consumer, it is incumbent on me to ask why there are people in rural areas who do not have access to broadband.  How soon can they expect access to it?  Given the glaring disparities between those who can avail of next generation networks and those who are still dialling up, questions have to be asked of somebody.  Is this a result of Government policy?  If I ask the Minister a question on the rates of penetration in respect of broadband roll-out, I am told it is a matter for the individual companies involved and a commercial consideration.  If that is the case, does ComReg have any competence in that regard?  Can it put its boot up a company’s proverbial backside to force it to roll out broadband? My other question relates to the situation involving a typical person living in a rural area of County Cork when an application for the erection of a mast is suddenly made to the county council, whose policy of co-location means that three masts can be erected in one area.  That is of great concern to people in the community who are powerless to do anything about the matter.  Can ComReg assess the level of radiation in the area to allay their fears?  Does it have the power to ensure the policy of co-location espoused by the county development plan of a local authority can be overridden?  What redress does an individual have if he or she has legitimate concerns about that policy? My next question relates to the postal sector.  We are all familiar with the Bolkestein directive on the liberalisation of postal services and the stormy passage it enjoyed.  Liberalisation of postal services has been on the cards for a considerable time.  Concerns have been expressed to me on the question of whether it can be guaranteed that there will be a universal service obligation.  If somebody lives in a remote rural area, does he or she have the same rights to a postal service as somebody living in a town such as Mallow, Fermoy or Mitchelstown?  Will ComReg have a substantive role in ensuring this? I understand there is provision for a certain amount of radio spectrum or bandwidth to be given over to religious or community organisations.  I refer to WPAs but as I do not even know what they are, the commissioners must forgive me.  I am not, as I said, the most technically minded.  What has been the take-up of that facility?  What is the percentage of broadband penetration in the country as a whole?
10317	SeanSherlock	Labour	12844.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	24	 Effectively, the group broadband schemes were done away with.  The SWRA which operated the scheme in my constituency was making great progress in this regard.  However, it is to be replaced by the national broadband scheme.  As I understand it, the criteria governing eligibility for the provision of broadband have changed.  Where it is deemed there is a service provider in a particular area, no other person may apply to provide a service.  While parts of north Cork are serviced by a service provider, more rural parts of the county do not fall within its remit.  Arguably, people will be left behind, despite the introduction of the new scheme.  I wonder if ComReg has a role in this regard and hope my point is clear.
10318	SeanSherlock	Labour	12844.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	30	 How did the problem arise?  Was a broadcast of mass interfering with aviation signals?

10325	SeanSherlock	Labour	12858.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 I welcome Mr. Guiomard's informative contribution.  The aviation industry faces major challenges.  The commissioner referred to a reassessment of current regulatory structures.  Will he flesh out this comments? I have a particular interest in the regional imbalance.  Dublin Airport is increasingly becoming a bottleneck and one has little joy in using the facility.  There appears to be a perceptible diminution in the role of Cork and Shannon airports which have lost slots or had certain slots changed.  Does the Commission for Aviation Regulation have a role to play in addressing this imbalance or at least in seeking to encourage the use of slots beyond Dublin Airport and in the regions? I am surprised, given the number of passengers who use Irish airports annually, that only two people deal with the rights of passengers, although I am open to correction on this.  We have all subscribed in our habits to the low cost airline culture in that we engage in a contract with a low cost airline and are at its mercy and whims.  One pays one fee, boards the flight and the devil takes the hindmost.  Is there a case for increasing the rights of passengers?  Does the current regime give proper and due recognition to the rights of passengers when delays occur or in terms of baggage charges and the application of more stringent rules by all airlines?  Does the commission have a role in this regard?  Should the joint committee make a case to the powers that be, namely, the Minister, that increased funding should be made available to employ more personnel to deal with the rights of passengers? On slots, while it is important to protect the national interest, if we all subscribe to a market philosophy, airlines will find their own market.  As an island nation, however, can a case be made for protecting certain slots?  The loss of the Aer Lingus slots at Shannon Airport recently was a debacle.  Given that London is a major hub and the Shannon region is a major economic hub, one could argue that the change of the slot resulted in a serious loss of comparative advantage for the region.  Does the commission have a role in the context of our pursuit of a balanced regional economic policy aimed at preventing all investment going to the Pale?
10326	SeanSherlock	Labour	12858.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 The Jacob's report published in 2006 analysed the capacity.  Is a different picture emerging for Dublin?  Is the commissioner satisfied that projected capacity is adequate for five or ten years hence?  I do not have an economic analysis to hand but common sense suggests that airline traffic will grow unbelievably.  Will the commissioner seek a further expansion?  I appreciate the commissioner's remarks about his responsibilities in respect of regional policy, but people will ask this question. The commissioner's staff of 21, with four economists and two legal people, seems minuscule given the size and volume of the industry and that we live in a litigious environment.  Will the commissioner elaborate a little on the nature of the litigation?  Could it be argued that the aviation regulator will spend a great deal of time and resources, unfairly perhaps, staving off challenges from various airlines and that the Government must consider this in respect of funding?
10327	SeanSherlock	Labour	12858.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak again.  I am learning as I go.  When companies are litigious the regulator has to use resources on going into court every other day, which is a cost burden.  It affects how one defends the rights of passengers.  It diminishes the commission's role in defending passengers because it cannot expend resources in that regard. In its submission the commission referred to alternative arrangements which would have the impact of a judicial judgment but in a non-judicial setting.  What role is envisaged for legislators in that regard? I am tired of reading newspaper headlines of airlines taking challenges every other day of the week.  I wonder if it really is for the common good.  I can understand a company trying to protect a competitive advantage which is sound economics, but we must be cognisant of the rights of passengers.

10331	SeanSherlock	Labour	12872.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 I welcome the taxi regulator and her colleague.  Most of the points I wished to make have been covered.  There has been a tangible improvement in the level of service, particularly in larger urban areas such as Cork city and Dublin.  It is easier to get a taxi, day or night, than it was heretofore.  The regulator has been instrumental in bringing that about. I come from Mallow, north Cork and licences there used to be issued by the local authority, which gave an element of control.  Now, we see the local authority no longer has that power, which is vested in the regulator, and there is no interaction between the local authority and the regulator in terms of provision of spaces.  In Mallow, which is typical of many towns, more and more licences are being issued but the main street or the taxi ranks cannot cope.  Has there been consultation?  The regulator's submission refers to consultation with the local authorities but has there been consultation specifically with regard to the provision of taxi spaces?  There are currently 47 taxi licences in Mallow and the town does not have the space to cope with these. I differ from my colleague from the Green Party regarding the nine-year vehicle standard rule.  The German case is different in that there is a German brand, the Mercedes-Benz, in which there is national pride.  It is much easier to impose a certain type of car or colour in that scenario. I would argue that as long as a vehicle is up to certain standards in respect of cleanliness and its operation, I do not see why it cannot be used as a public service vehicle.  I differ in this regard.  Given that it is his or her business, a taxi driver who has the wherewithal to invest moneys in a licence should have a certain degree of autonomy as to the vehicle that he or she could choose to use. I seek clarification as to whether it is envisaged that a standard would be imposed whereby any vehicle that was more than nine years old could not be used.  While I may be wrong in this regard, I would be vehemently opposed to such a proposal.  Many vehicles, such as the aforementioned famous German marque, will go on for ten, 15 or 20 years and can be operated as effectively as any two or three year old car as long as they receive proper maintenance.  At present, people operate with older marques, many of which are more than ten years old, which are in perfectly good condition and I do not see why such vehicles cannot continue to be used. While those are the basic points, I also seek clarification on the ownership of taxi licences.  My understanding is that plates will no longer be transferable.  If that assumption is correct, will it be the case that if someone invests in a taxi business, this plate, which costs approximately €6,000, will be non-transferable and cannot be used as an asset should the person in question decide to dispose of it to a family member or otherwise?  Were this to be the case, I would have an issue with it.  Someone who builds up a business and invests approximately €6,000, should be able to transfer that licence as he or she sees fit, subject to certain provisions being put in place.  It should be subject to certain rules and regulations and the person taking over the licence should adhere to certain regulations and training.  If the plates are non-transferable, perhaps the regulator will clarify the reason and expand on this subject.  I thank the regulator for her submission.

10337	SeanSherlock	Labour	12928.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 I apologise for missing the initial contribution.  I join members in welcoming the delegation before the committee.  I, too, am on a steep learning curve.  Generally speaking, there is confidence in the system of regulation while there is a lack of confidence in the market mechanisms.  It is important to make that distinction. My questions are predicated on practical matters, for instance, the high degree to which the banking sector has issued loans on foot of what is effectively property speculation.  I do not know the percentage but I wonder if the downturn in that sector has left the banking sector vulnerable to a situation similar to that of Northern Rock and other institutions.  I realise we make the distinction between the sub-prime market and the position as it relates to Ireland in that Ireland would not have been a victim of the sub-prime lending scenario, so to speak, but it appears a great deal of money is tied up in property.  If a downturn occurs in the construction sector and there is potential for defaulting on loans, does that leave the banking sector vulnerable?  Is there a role for the regulator in that regard in seeking to modify the behaviour of banks in terms of the way they loan to their customers in the future?  I am sure there has not been much lending to other sectors with growth potential within the economy, and perhaps that is something that should be examined.  In agriculture, for example, only 2% of all lending relates to agricultural output but I would like to hear the representatives' view on that. In terms of the potential for a banking crisis, I imagine the risk to be low but it always exists.  In regard to the amount of money on deposit by individual citizens, do the representatives believe there is enough protection in place to ensure that if one or two banks go bust, the money they have on deposit is adequately protected?  I understand there is a mechanism in place and a fund with the Central Bank for depositors but in the current climate, and given what has happened abroad, are there grounds for enhancing that provision? With regard to the European Union financial services action plan, the first question is a practical one.  Is it a binding action plan on all member states and, if so, what percentage of that action plan has been transposed into law?  How are the representatives monitoring the transposition of those laws and regulations?  Is there scope for better legislation, given that the Lamfalussy report in 2001 instigated the financial services action plan?  Is there scope for a review of that or could we have better regulation to achieve the maximum amount of output in the economy, which is what we are talking about? I am heartened that the organisations have put themselves up for external review.  That is always a good benchmark because self-regulation is not always the most effective.  The fact that they constantly review their operations would give some grounds for confidence also.
10338	SeanSherlock	Labour	12928.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 The financial services action plan allows for, say, Bank of Ireland or AIB to set up operations in other countries.  In doing so, would they be subject to their host nations' regulatory regimes?  Are banks which set up operations in this country subject to our regulatory regime governing, for example, issues relating to liquidity, or are they only subject to the regulatory regime of their home country?  It is important to maintain confidence in the system because if confidence fails, it has implications down the line.

10341	SeanSherlock	Labour	12942.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	" I welcome the submission as a fellow citizen who has a bank account.  It appears those who have genuine complaints against banking organisations have no recourse to mechanisms that would provide a remedy. I am amazed that in response to the question of whether it kept a record or reported on a case for which it claimed it was not responsible, the Financial Regulator stated: ""This was not possible in your case because your complaint falls outside the definition of a consumer"".  That is an extraordinary scenario.  It would be appropriate for this committee to ask the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator the questions Mr. Beades posed in his conclusion.  We should at least write to them to seek answers to some of these questions.  If we are now in a situation whereby complaints made by individuals are defined as ""non-consumer complaints"", what recourse is open to anybody who holds a bank account in this State?  If the role of the Financial Regulator and the ombudsman is protecting consumers, it is clear that a flaw exists in the system.  Questions must be answered by these taxpayer funded bodies in regard to the practices of the banking sector."
10342	SeanSherlock	Labour	12942.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I thank the delegates very much for their presentation and their frankness on this matter.  As members said, serious issues have been raised and we must deal with them either by bringing in the regulator or expanding the role of the financial ombudsman.  We will take up the issues raised and follow through on them.  The committee will communicate with the delegates again.
10343	SeanSherlock	Labour	12956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I welcome Mr. Callaghan's presentation on behalf of Ryanair.  I am trying to get a read on the issue from the point of view of how it impacts on the end user, the customer at the airport.  We are hearing numerous costings for Terminal 2.  The question is whether the charges being imposed by the regulator are being imposed in a manner that seeks to meet the cost of the new terminal.  If that is the case, what is the true cost of T2?  When Mr. Guiomard appeared before the committee he mentioned a figure of €1.2 billion.  The Dublin Airport Authority states the cost will be in the region of €395 million at current prices and Ryanair has its own figures on this.  What is the true picture as regards the pricing mechanism of the cost of the terminal?  With regard to RAB, the regulated asset base, what is the alternative model of costing in that sense?  I am a layman and I am seeking to broaden my understanding of the issues.  If we had a different model would it be more efficient?  What does Ryanair think is the more efficient model?   What are the powers of this committee to question until we get to the bottom of what is quite a confusing issue? I am not completely convinced the regulator is acting in the best interests of the consumer.  I am not convinced that it is an openly competitive model, but I cannot explain the reason for not being convinced.  I need further information.  Perhaps it was naivety and lack of understanding on my part, but when the Commission for Aviation Regulation was here it give us a rose-tinted view of matters.  I called specifically for Ryanair to attend today to obtain another point of view and then we could recall the Regulator so that we can see the true picture.  I am not convinced the cost model that pertains to Terminal 2 is necessarily the correct one.  As a Corkman who finds it necessary to use Dublin Airport every time I go to Dublin, I do so reluctantly because of the sheer hassle one must go through and the charging structures that apply to everything one does from the time one parks one's car to when one boards the plane.  Perhaps the aviation regulator should be brought to book in regard to some of these charges that are applied to consumers, to whom we have ultimate responsibility. I do not know whether it is appropriate to ask, but would it be possible for Mr. Callaghan to expand on his views in regard to the servicing of debt vis-à-vis Cork Airport and the future of that airport.  Is Ryanair’s potential involvement in Cork Airport hindered by virtue of the debt the airport is saddled with and the cost structures that arise as a result of that debt?
10344	SeanSherlock	Labour	12956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	 I will come in on the second round.
10345	SeanSherlock	Labour	12956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	 I thank Mr. Callaghan for those answers.  We need to distinguish between discretionary and airport charges.  I have flown to far flung places with Ryanair.  I slept on the floor of Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, not a very comfortable place to sleep, while awaiting a transfer to Ciampino to watch Ireland play Italy in the Six Nations Championship.  However, had I travelled with Alitalia or Aer Lingus, I would have paid through the nose for the privilege. There are many customers who will take whatever steps are necessary to reach their final destination, including, if they must, sleeping on an uncomfortable airport floor.  The argument is not about the extra charges Ryanair imposes.  The bottom line is to pack a smaller bag.  Most people I know travel at weekends and can simply put their bags in the overhead locker.  We must distinguish between that charge and those levied by airports on consumers.  That is the point. I do not wish to harp on about the cost of Terminal 2 but who will its end users be?  Who will pay for it?  If Ryanair or any other airline will not use it, will they have to pay for it?  Will it be the taxpayer who will ultimately pay for it?  Who will be the net beneficiaries when it is completed?  This issue must be hammered out.  If I have learned anything today, it is that more questions must be asked of the regulator who must be brought back to address the points outlined in the submission.
10346	SeanSherlock	Labour	12956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I thank Mr. Callaghan for his presentation which probably raises more questions than it answers.

10349	SeanSherlock	Labour	12970.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I thank Mr. Burgess for his presentation.  I shall be brief and to the point. Arising from this document, which is fairly self-evident, from what he says, is there scope for looking at the role of the consumer panel to intervene with the Financial Regulator or to intervene publicly in forums other than this one to highlight some of the issues Mr. Burgess talks about?  It seems that there is a culture within banking, which has always been secretive, for commercial and other cultural reasons.  That type of culture seems to pervade the remit of the Financial Regulator.  Is there scope for increasing the powers of the consumer panel to bring the Financial Regulator to book on some of the issues Mr. Burgess has outlined?  The role of the consumer panel as it is constituted at present, while it has a remit on committees such as this, is perhaps very limited in its scope and may need to be expanded somewhat. In terms of Mr. Burgess's presentation vis-à-vis the credit union movement, notwithstanding the regulator’s intervention on the loss of €40 million, I have often thought that this sector was underperforming in terms of its potential.  Given the amount of money on deposit within the credit union movement — I do not know the exact sum — and its purchasing power, is there scope to expand its operations in terms of credit facilities and increased banking facilities?  The credit union as it is constituted is owned by its membership.  Is there a role for the consumer panel?  While that question may be a little off the point, Mr. Burgess referred to the credit union movement.  From a consumer perspective, is there increased scope for the credit union movement to perhaps increase or widen its remit from a credit or financial institution perspective?
10350	SeanSherlock	Labour	12970.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	7	 I will return to this point after Mr. Burgess has responded to Deputy Kirk's questions.
10351	SeanSherlock	Labour	12970.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	19	" Mr. Burgess mentioned the paragraph on selling investment products to the elderly.  There seems to be a glaring deficiency.  According to the 2006 report, the ombudsman referred the issue of misselling to the elderly to the regulator who, following a relevant ""Prime Time"" programme in 2008, reported that there was no information to verify a widespread problem.  Besides the ombudsman's report, the ""Prime Time"" programme showed clear evidence.  Is it a question of resources?  Is the Financial Regulator so consumed by the prudential rules governing banking and financial institutions that the consumer element of its operations is not as prioritised as it should be?  I want Mr. Burgess's opinion, not to put words in his mouth. The majority of people have faith in financial institutions, given that they have bank accounts, mortgages and so on.  Due to an inherent faith in the system, the bulk of transactions are carried out without question.  However, people do not visit their bank branches and ask difficult questions about banks' functions.  Speaking for myself, there is a certain degree of ignorance born of an inherent trust.  Were more consumers to begin questioning at ground level the nature of the transactions, charging mechanisms, etc., there would be a different culture that would not give rise to the points being addressed by Mr. Burgess or programmes such as ""Prime Time""."

10355	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 I have listened to what the Financial Regulator had to say.  When he addressed this committee on 29 April I asked the following: If a downturn occurs in the construction sector and there is potential for defaulting on loans, does that leave the banking sector vulnerable?  Is there a role for the regulator in that regard in seeking to modify the behaviour of banks in terms of the way they loan to their customers in the future? Aside from other questions I asked on the day, the response I got to that particular question from Mr. Neary was as follows: There is no evidence that lending for speculative property development starved other sectors of resources.  I have no sense of that happening but will reflect on the question and, if there is any evidence that it has taken place, I will revert to the Deputy with a reply. The Financial Regulator's submission to the joint committee on 29 April when we dealt with the exposure of Northern Rock is remarkably different from its submission today.  I put it to Mr. Neary that he has failed in his task, that at best the regulatory regime was very weak and that ultimately the cost for those seriously exposed will fall to the taxpayer.  At what point did he telephone the Minister for Finance to set alarm bells ringing about the banking crisis bound to unfold, in the light of the information now available, in terms of the exposure of Irish banks?  He must have known about this, as he must have had his ear to the ground and, if not, why not? Following on from Deputy Ardagh's question, I would be more blunt.  Is Mr. Neary's position untenable?  If not, does he think the measures he is proposing will give solace to those with 35 year 100% mortgages who are seriously exposed in the current climate?  Does he believe the European regulatory framework is a proper regulatory framework?  Does he believe one regulator per country acting unilaterally is not the way to go?  The only way to deal with the crisis — we do not know what will happen tomorrow — is through a cross-compliance structure, an inter-European regulatory framework, whereby all member states would subscribe to the same set of rules.  In the absence of such a structure, the euro is under threat.  On 30 September the Government acted in what it termed as the country's best interest but it could be argued that it acted unilaterally.  Others followed suit but now the game has changed in the light of the United Kingdom's intervention. I do not understand how such a level of borrowing was allowed to continue.  Mr. Neary will have to explain to the joint committee why the banks were able to lend money hand over fist without anybody putting a halt to it or without political responsibility.  Perhaps it is a fact that he did not communicate with the Minister for Finance.  If he did to set alarm bells ringing, we would like to hear how and when it was done.
10356	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 On a point of order, Mr. Neary said in his statement to the committee that speculative lending to the construction and property sectors amounted to €39.1 billion, of which €24 billion was supported by additional collateral or alternative sources of cashflow.  This leaves a balance of €15 billion secured directly on the underlying property.  Correct me if I am wrong, but this potentially leaves the taxpayer exposed to a guarantee of €15 billion if the loans are defaulted on.  At what point was this information known to Mr. Neary?  Has it only come to light in the past week or so or was it known some months ago? My main question for the Financial Regulator is what relationship does it share with the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance?  It must have known much earlier that things were not going according to plan and that they were not right in the banking sector.  What mechanisms have been used by the regulator?  Mr. Neary is using certain language and it is hard to argue vociferously against him.  He seems to be genuine regarding what he was trying to achieve.  I am worried that the Financial Regulator did not bang the table enough, if I may put it that way, in its interactions with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and that this is part of the crisis.
10357	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	72	 That is what we are here to do.  If the taxpayer is to underwrite a guarantee for the banking sector, it is fair that we should ask pertinent questions and have an open dialogue on the issue.
10358	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	147	 If €69.3 billion has been loaned, a question arises in respect of the insurance covering that debt.  In addition, the issue of speculation on credit default swaps has emerged of late.  To what extent, ultimately, are the Irish taxpayer, Government and banks exposed in this regard?  Does the regulator take a view on the issue of credit default swaps? Moreover, the point that was made about securitisation and its relevance to the position in which we find ourselves at present should be repeated because I did not quite follow it.
10359	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 We will communicate with it in the matter.

10363	SeanSherlock	Labour	13097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I welcome the delegation.  The purpose of the visit and the establishment of an ombudsman is a reasonable request.  We support this and I do not know if it is within the remit of this committee to create such a post but it is certainly within our remit to lobby for such a post.  I will be bringing the suggestion to the Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise and employment.  It should be on the political agenda. I represent a constituency that has a mix of urban and rural areas.  There are many businesses like those represented by the CSNA in rural settings and they find it difficult to survive.  Not only are they faced with the cost and bureaucratic nature of doing business but local authority charges are increasing year on year.  If there is a move towards expansion, the development levies and contributions that small businesses must pay to the county council are regressive.  Business is being used as a means to fund local government, something that must be reviewed.  If we continue to punish small businesses that operate in a rural environment, it will have a knock-on effect on the presence of those businesses in the future.  Something must be done and the establishment of an ombudsman would be beneficial to take an overview of the regulatory framework and the punitive costs placed on businesses in those settings. I was interested in the comments on the National Consumer Agency and Repak.  I have not figured out what Repak does.  I see the wonderful advertisements it puts out and the impression is created that the recycling regime in this country is wonderful.  However, it raises questions about the nature of the recycling regime. Through their membership of Repak, the larger multiples are let off the hook with regard to the packaging directive because there is no requirement to recycle at the point of purchase.  I would like to hear more about this.  If there is a position paper outlining the delegates' views on that relationship perhaps that might be sent to me.  We must look at that issue. I did not realise that such a high percentage of turnover related to communications, if I might broadly describe it that way.  Perhaps this committee might bring in the National Consumer Agency and put more stringent questions to it.  In essence, I disagree with nothing that has been said by the witnesses.  It is common sense and highlights the situation of independent retailers who are sustaining businesses in difficult times against competition from larger multiples.  There must be a regulatory framework in order to make it a bit easier for the representatives and their members.  Rather than hinder them, it should facilitate doing business because of the people and the communities they serve.  This is a basic commonsensical argument and it should be supported.
10364	SeanSherlock	Labour	13097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 There is a time constraint, as another committee is due to meet in this room at 11 a.m.  I thank the delegates for attending.  They have made their points well.  They have raised many issues concerning the retail sector which we will examine and on which we will possibly have further discussions with them.
10365	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 I welcome Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's clarification of the position vis-à-vis credit rating versus credit referencing.  The objectives set out by the Irish Credit Bureau are clear and a distinction has been made in that sense.  An issue arises regarding the objective of aiding avoidance of over-indebtedness.  If my mode of putting questions is wrong, Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh may correct me.  If somebody who is not part of the group of 80 members seeks information on a particular person, is a facility available whereby the ICB will provide information on a particular individual to third parties?  Is information on the credit histories of individuals freely available to the 80 members of the ICB?
10366	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 To clarify, is it correct that the Irish Credit Bureau does not make lending decisions, as such, and is, as has been stated, a librarian or facility for storing data?
10367	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 There is, in effect, an element of rating involved in the activity of the Irish Credit Bureau.
10368	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 I beg Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's indulgence on this issue.  I am trying to enhance my understanding of the issue and ask him to forgive me if my questioning appears persistent.  Is there scope for the Irish Credit Bureau to develop as a credit rating agency?
10369	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 On behalf of the committee I thank the Irish Credit Bureau for attending the meeting.
10370	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 On behalf of the committee I thank the Irish Credit Bureau for attending the meeting.
10371	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 On behalf of the committee I thank the Irish Credit Bureau for attending the meeting.
10372	SeanSherlock	Labour	13124.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 On behalf of the committee I thank the Irish Credit Bureau for attending the meeting.
10373	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	75	 I will couch my questions with a reference to the role and remit of the committee in looking at the regulatory framework and, more generally, where the banking sector stands today.  We have seen the downgrading by Standard & Poor's and Moody's which speaks volumes about the current banking culture in the State. On contracts for difference, what is the internal audit unit's regulatory role, as the delegates understand it, in terms of their internal procedures?  What is the regulatory framework for reporting contracts for difference in Anglo Irish Bank's operations?  What involvement has the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator had with the bank in these transactions?  Was there an internal auditing procedure to govern them?
10374	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	77	 If, for instance, a number of shareholders were loaned money to buy shares using the shares as collateral, would Mr. Tyrell have a role in that regard?
10375	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	79	 There is a loan issue and there is a shareholder issue.  I understand the distinction Mr. Tyrell makes in terms of his role vis-à-vis a shareholder issue.  If there were loans which were acquired by people who are shareholders for the purposes of purchasing stock or shares in Anglo Irish Bank, would Mr. Tyrell have a role?  If I ask this question I am doing so as a layman who seeks an understanding, on behalf of the people who are looking at Anglo Irish Bank and wondering what in God’s name is going on.  We are trying to get an understanding of how the financial regulatory system works in terms of banking operations and how risk management and internal auditing functions are carried out.  I would like that information dissected and disseminated in such a way as to give the ordinary man and woman in the street some degree of understanding of how these things work, mindful of the fact that this bank is nationalised.
10376	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	81	 If Mr. Tyrell is looking at the lending controls, is he mindful, in terms of his operations, as to what is happening within the market or is it merely an internal compliance risk management issue?  Is Mr. Tyrell mindful of the fact that if a person, who was a shareholder for the purposes of purchasing shares, was to seek a loan, the internal auditors in that instance have no role whatsoever in terms of the lending policy?
10377	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	83	 If the internal auditors have a role is it flagged up or does one call time on it?  What is the exact procedure by which internal auditors act in such instances if it were to happen?
10378	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	85	 Therefore, the final decision is not that of the internal auditor.
10379	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	87	 I thank Mr. Tyrell.
10380	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	116	 If the process was working so well, why does Mr. Tyrell think we are where we are today in terms of Anglo Irish Bank?  Can he give an overview, given his 12 years experience with Anglo Irish Bank and the fact that he was appointed head of internal audit in 2005 and is the former head of Anglo Irish Assurance Company?
10381	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	118	 Will Mr. Tyrell please elaborate on that?
10382	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	273	 In Deputy Kelly's world, Fianna Fáil was never in power during the last ten years.  That was just a dream also.
10383	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	275	" I am seeking a better understanding of the submissions being made to the committee.  No human being with any sense of reason could believe that if a chairman of one of the banks in Ireland approached that bank for a loan, he or she would be subject to the same stringent internal audit procedures as, for example, me, if I sought a loan from Anglo Irish Bank.  The delegates cannot realistically expect us or the people to believe what has been said about the internal auditing procedures as they applied to the loans of various directors. I am trying to look at this from the perspective of an ordinary shareholder such as a pensioner who had ordinary shares in the bank as an investment and was hoping for a return on that investment in their autumn or winter years.  There appears to be a sense of duplicity in how internal auditing procedures were effected with regard to directors' loans and how they were effected in the case of other loans such as to business.  I spoke about the contracts for difference.  I am anxious to understand before I leave this committee whether there was a procedure whereby loans were made to individuals who were shareholders for the purpose of purchasing shares, where contracts for difference were transferred into ordinary shares, if I understand the process correctly.  I have not received a satisfactory answer to assist my understanding of how the internal auditing procedures operate in such instances. It has been stated publicly or in the press that there were a number of what I call ""angel investors"" who assisted shareholders for the purpose of buying what was reported to be a 10% shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is also stated some of those were existing shareholders.  We are trying to find out the extent of the borrowings, what was used as collateral for these borrowings and whether there was a reporting procedure to the Department of Finance.  The delegates have stated they cannot talk about individual shareholders; therefore, I will put my question in another way.  If somebody who is a shareholder purchases shares and takes out a loan from Anglo Irish Bank for the purpose of purchasing these shares, is there an internal auditing procedure in that regard and is there a reporting procedure that must be undertaken to the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator?"
10384	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	277	 I appreciate the position——
10385	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	279	 That is not exactly what I am stating.
10386	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	281	 My point concerns whether people took out loans using a particular form of collateral, namely, shares in the bank, to purchase shares in the bank.
10387	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	283	 I appreciate that, but it goes to the heart of what the committee is examining for whatever input we have into a legislative framework to shore up some of these matters in the future.  It assists our understanding of how we might proceed in that regard.
10388	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 What would lending of this nature typically be given for?
10389	SeanSherlock	Labour	13208.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	356	 I am trying to increase my understanding of the internal audit process, the risk management function in respect of lending and the credit control function.  We are just trying to find out what the nature of the loans might be.

10407	SeanSherlock	Labour	13238.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I welcome Mr. Moynihan to the joint committee.  I will first make a number of basic, broad points. We are witnessing how capitalism is being redesigned.  I do not say this in an ideological manner.  The Anglo-Saxon model to which Mr. Moynihan referred has been effectively turned on its head.  We are still in a state of flux and no one knows what new model will emerge from the current system.  We have the Japanese and Korean model of capitalism, the Anglo-Saxon model and the German model.  While Germany has been affected by the financial crisis, it has not been to the same extent as other models.  The German federal structure allows for a system of banking which ensures regulation is tight.  I ask Mr. Moynihan for his opinion.  Could Ireland use the German model?  Will he also, in broad strokes, give a view on how we should develop a regulation model which would insure us against shocks such as those we have seen in the recent past?  I accept, however, that no model will be perfect. When the internal auditors of Anglo Irish Bank appeared before the joint committee recently, members sought to question them on loans to directors and the fact that loans could be made to directors with impunity.  How do we change relationships between internal audit committees, credit control committees and boards of directors who pass loans of a certain nature?  How do we tighten such practices?  Regulation is needed to grapple with these issues. The European Union, in the Jacques de la Rosières report, has produced a set of recommendations.  Heretofore, the British were outside the tent in reaching political agreement at EU level on European regulation.  This was mainly due to the city of London.  It appears, however, that it will, through the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Alastair Darling, get on board and accept a European model of regulation.  Can the Oireachtas introduce legislative measures to ensure Ireland stays on the curve or will the European Union be ahead of the curve?  Should we accept the EU model in its entirety?  What can we do to ensure our regulatory framework is at least compliant with the European Union model?  I would like also to get a sense of what is happening in Europe, if Mr. Moynihan has an opinion on that.  I will leave it at that for now because there will be many questions.
10408	SeanSherlock	Labour	13238.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	74	 The Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009, currently making its way through the Houses, gives the Government, through the reserve fund, the power to take a stake in the specified institutions through preference shares.  Does Mr. Moynihan expect there will be a return for the State on this investment in the coming years?  The results posted by AIB this week include a reference to potential loan write-downs of more than €8 billion.  It seems likely, therefore, notwithstanding the Government's undertaking to recapitalise each bank to the tune of €3.5 billion, that the banks in question may be caught short. The view of the global financial markets is that Irish banking stocks are untouchable.  In this context, the measures the Government is taking are not necessarily being recognised as positives.  It seems more must be done if confidence in our banks is to be restored.  Aside from the regulatory issues, therefore, there is the question of why the markets do not necessarily view the recapitalisation measures as a positive development.  If they did, there would have been some increase in the share price in recent days. I am interested in Mr. Moynihan's views on nationalisation.  What would be the logical conclusion of such a process?  If, for example, AIB were to be nationalised, what signal would that send to the markets in terms of how Ireland is conducting its business?  Given that nationalisation requires the suspension of shares, what impact would that have on a bank's ability to fund debt into the future?  If the taxpayer is to own 100% of the banks, can those banks continue to operate within the market in the same manner as they have done heretofore?
10409	SeanSherlock	Labour	13238.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 On behalf of the joint committee, I thank Mr. Moynihan for his attendance and for his excellent presentation, which has given members plenty of food for thought.  The joint committee will adjourn until 10.30 a.m. next Tuesday, when the Governor of the Central Bank will appear before it.
10410	SeanSherlock	Labour	13238.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	74	 On behalf of the joint committee, I thank Mr. Moynihan for his attendance and for his excellent presentation, which has given members plenty of food for thought.  The joint committee will adjourn until 10.30 a.m. next Tuesday, when the Governor of the Central Bank will appear before it.
10411	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 On a point of order, it is midday and Government members have spent the past hour questioning the Governor of the Central Bank.  I ask for equity.  Will the Chairman allow for the fact that the committee has other members?
10412	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	89	 I too welcome Mr. Hurley and his colleagues to the committee, especially as he is a fellow Mallow man to boot. On what I have heard so far, it seems that the Central Bank has been a largely irrelevant institution in recent years.  If the regulatory authority would have been largely feeding into the financial stability assessment reports, if those reports were being ignored, and if monetary and fiscal policy was being determined by the European Central Bank, then why did we have a Central Bank in the first instance? Coupled with that is the question on the de Larosière report.  De Larosière is being rolled out as the new John Wayne to whose train we all will hitch our wagons and somehow he will save the day.  It is a little incongruous.  My analysis of the situation — Mr. Hurley may correct me if I am wrong — is that where any prudential rules were sought to be put in place over the past ten years, they were fiercely resisted and we and the UK were probably the fiercest opponents of any change in the rules in favour of a more prudential system of governance vis-à-vis the banks.  If a European systemic risk council — a funny-sounding name — will be set up and it will run through the individual regulatory supervisors, I question the role of any individual nation state’s central bank if it will be the regulator that will govern the behaviour of banks in such a scenario.  Perhaps Mr. Hurley will comment on that. Will €7 billion be sufficient to recapitalise AIB and the Bank of Ireland?  Legislation was passed by the Oireachtas two weeks ago.  What role had the Central Bank in advising the Department of Finance on the amount that would be required?  In light of JP Morgan's assessment that bank liabilities in Ireland total €26.9 billion, was sufficient money put into the banks in the first instance? With regard to credit risk, my understanding of economics is that, traditionally, banks could loan on the basis of deposits and they could loan a multiple of that amount.  Historically, the cash ratio was 10% but that went out the window and new rules were introduced at Basel and so on.  The Central Bank became the so-called lender of last resort.  When did that model dissipate?  Where did that all go wrong?  The perception of ordinary people is the central bank of any country is the institution that regulates banks and they haul them over the coals if they misbehave.  Credit risk has defined the crisis in which we find ourselves.  No analysis was conducted on the level of credit risk and banks could lend greater multiples based on the fact they were parcelling off credit risk as a financial instrument in itself.  Did the Central Bank even have the expertise to analyse what was happening with regard to credit risk?  Did it have a role?  Should it have a role in future?  If not, does the Central Bank have a future?
10413	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	 Essentially we are talking about regulation.  The fundamental issue is how the markets will be regulated into the future.  One analysis is that we do not know where we are at the moment, that we are in the morass and nobody has been able to come up with a way to get out of it and start going again.  Even if we start going again we do not know what the nature of that will be. There has been a fundamental rethink regarding how things will be done from now on.  It is fair comment to say that the system of regulation here was weak.  It was weak because there may not have been an understanding of the financial instruments being used by the markets.  There may not have been an expert analysis of what was happening internally within the banks.  If we are to have a system of regulation, what should be the characteristics of a regulator in terms of its interrelationship with the Irish Central Bank?  It seems, if I am to be honest about it, that the Central Bank is blaming the Financial Regulator or the failure of regulation, and that it is saying there is no culpability on the part of the Central Bank.  What it is saying is that it warned everybody through its stability reports but was effectively powerless to act or to intervene because that was the role of the Financial Regulator or the Department of Finance.  I wonder about that interaction and whether or not——
10414	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	93	 We are now seeing an admission by key personnel in the country's finances that there was a lack of knowledge of the financial instruments which caused the explosion in global economies.
10415	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	 I thank the Governor for that.  We must learn from the mistakes made and go into the future with a new model of governance. The United States advocates a zero interest rate policy.  Does Mr. Hurley have a view on that?  Should we move towards zero interest rates within the eurozone?
10416	SeanSherlock	Labour	13243.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 Spoken like Jean-Claude Trichet.

10423	SeanSherlock	Labour	13264.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	73	 I welcome the delegation.  I am a layman.  I am not an accountant and do not have any qualification in that regard.  If I was reading the statement which the authority has made about issuing requests for information, explanations and clarification in respect of 84 of the reports reviewed and that there was amended financial information in respect of 50% of reports, I would be thinking that the culture of compliance in this country is still a long way off target in respect of certain financial institutions.  I seek clarification because perhaps I misunderstood these statements.  If I understand correctly what Mr. Drennan is saying, that it was because certain ISA standards were not met to the full letter of the law, my view as a layman is that I think there is still something rotten in the state of Denmark, so to speak, in terms of the culture of compliance and that people are still not providing or fully disclosing proper financial information or meeting the required standards. I refer to the European Commission's recommendation on quality assurance of auditors.  If this is a Commission recommendation, to what extent should it have been transposed into Irish law?  To what extent is the Government responsible for that transposition?  I ask for an opinion from the delegation as to what constitutes a recommendation in terms of transposition into Irish law and what constitutes a regulation as laid down by the European Communities in terms of the quality assurance of auditors of public interest entities as that speaks volumes about the culture in this country where quite often laws, recommendations or regulations that are supposed to be transposed to assist the culture of compliance are not transposed in the manner in which they should be.  This may be something on which the chief executive is not in a position to make a comment but I am sure the Senator may be in such a position.
10424	SeanSherlock	Labour	13264.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	75	 It is fair to say a large proportion of the mess in terms of compliance is partly due to a lack of political action in enforcing EU recommendations and regulations.  It is very easy to blame the culture of regulation, but the Government must also take responsibility for its actions or inaction.

A number of things would need to happen for that to come about, but it could be helpful in order to assist the committee in terms of the questions we pose to people who come before it.  In the event of such people asserting that what they say is confirmed by legal advice, if that is made available to us, it might be of assistance to us in some instances.

10437	SeanSherlock	Labour	13273.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 I welcome the submission but the only conclusion I can draw from it is that there is now a change in culture in the regulatory regime here.  Since the appointment of Sir Andrew Large, what potential for sanctions now exists other than for administrative sanctions?  If there was a culture of overcharging, which is the same as theft, the only recourse in law is an administrative sanction or a fine.  The banks knew that was the case and carried on with the practice.  We must change from administrative to other sanctions and change the law so that where overcharging occurs on a systematic basis, those responsible do time.  If we are to effect change in the regulatory regime, that is necessary. I would like to hear more about the Minister's announcement that Sir Andrew Large has been appointed to look at the prudential supervision regime and the regulatory regime.

10441	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	" I welcome the commissioners from the Commission for Communication Regulation.  The language that has grown up around communications is one I do not really understand.  I hear phrases such as ""ensure seamless transition of the new responsibilities"" but to speak in real terms, broadband provision is woefully inadequate in large tracts of rural areas. We must ask why is that still the case.  Mr. Doherty mentioned Japan, where if I am not mistaken there is almost full broadband penetration and at speed in excess of the Irish average.  Why is that still the situation in 2009? Will there be another takeover of Eircom, because the ""Australians"" left it in a dire mess and with a severe lack of investment.  Will it be in a position to carry out its public service remit in the future?  Has the Commission had any contact with Eircom to discuss its future in recent months?  Would the people not be better served if Eircom was re-nationalised so that one could achieve the aspirations and aims that are set out in the presentation?  As long as Eircom remains as it is, the country will be at a severe disadvantage in growing the economy, achieving broadband penetration and maximising our potential in terms of new platforms. It has been estimated and I think reported that RTE will require €70 million to roll out digital television.  If we believe the reports of the cutbacks, it would appear that RTE would not be in a position to do that.  Will RTE be in a position to meet its obligation to roll out digital television, and if not will it incur penalties? My final point concerns postal services liberalisation.  The last time the delegates were before thie committee, we spoke about the Bolkestein directive.  What is its current position?  Will we see complete liberalisation of postal services?  Will An Post continue to be the sole provider of postal services or will there be a multiplicity of postal service providers?  What are the permutations for the public service obligation, PSO, given that there might be a multiplicity of providers in the postal services sector?  The concerns I have in this regard are based on whether one can guarantee that the service for people living in rural areas will continue into the future if there is a multiplicity of players in the market.  If there is further deregulation, will the PSO continue to be maintained and protected?"
10442	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 With all due respect, the country went to the market in regard to privatisation.  Mr. Doherty is telling us the penetration rate is 62%.  There are exchanges which have not been upgraded because of a lack of investment.  It is not an ideological argument at this stage but a pragmatic one that suggests if the infrastructure is brought back within its control, the State can invest the necessary resources to allow us to reach the rates of penetration we need to reach in order to compete in the manner we all want to compete, both economically and globally.  The bottom line as far as the people are concerned is that Eircom has failed in its purpose.  The unbundling of the local loop in accordance with European Union legislation has not been a success.  There is a school of thought that the market would not go near Eircom with a bargepole such is the state it is in.  I do not understand how Mr. Doherty can suggest it should be kept within the market structure.  Is anybody interested in Eircom?  Has anybody been in consultation with the commission in that regard?
10443	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	 Nobody would argue against that but is Mr. Doherty saying the national broadband scheme will deliver the rates of penetration necessary to turn the white areas of the map into red areas?
10444	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	 Does Mr. Doherty think that, in this day and age, one meg is adequate?  The benchmark is much too low here and the policy framework for broadband, on whatever platform, is not ambitious enough to enable us to compete with countries such as Japan.
10445	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 That is not the reality for people living in rural society.  Mr. Doherty is referring to conurbations or areas in which there are other platforms but the capacity is not available in certain areas of my constituency.  In the context of driving the rural economy certain areas, because of topography or geography, will not be served by those speeds. The delegates mentioned WiMax and other platforms that will evolve over time and I welcome them but when will we sort out the Eircom mess?  Is it a political decision?  Does ComReg have a role to play or will it be left to the vagaries of the market?  If it is the latter we will have another conversation in 12 months' time on the capacity of Eircom to meet its public service obligations.

10451	SeanSherlock	Labour	13348.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	71	 I join other members in welcoming the regulator.  Will she clarify the extent of her powers and competences?  Is she saying she does not have the authority to impose a moratorium on the issuance of licences and that it is a matter for the Government or the Minister?  Is she saying she has no power even to make recommendations in that regard? Ms Doyle referred to the new CD and manual.  Will she clarify that from 1 July, new entrants to the market will have to undergo a more rigorous examination than is currently the case?  Will existing licence holders have to take a revised examination?  Driver knowledge is still severely lacking, particularly in Dublin.  For a culchie such as myself who uses the city taxi service intermittently, to have to explain how to get to Coolock or another suburb indicates a serious lack of knowledge among some drivers.  What is the regulator's view of the situation in London, where there is a rigorous examination process for drivers, with applicants having to undergo several examination stages before a licence is granted?  Knowledge of the city is of paramount importance for London taxi drivers.  Does the regulator envisage similar requirements being put in place in the future for Dublin taxi drivers? I understand the CD and manual include a skills development programme.  I admit to some scepticism in this regard.  If I were a new entrant to the taxi industry driving around Mallow town, for example, the likelihood of me taking three or four hours to read a manual and listen to a CD would be slim.  What information do these tools contain that will add qualitatively to one's experience as a taxi driver?  What was the cost of producing them? I represent a constituency that has a rural and urban mix.  It is characterised by provincial towns, some of which are almost satellites of Cork city.  While some of these towns do not have town councils, those which do, such as Mallow, Fermoy, Cobh, Midleton and Youghal, are encountering problems because of the increase in the number of licences.  It is simply impossible to provide additional spaces in taxi ranks in certain town centres and an increase of two or three licences per annum in a town such as Mallow is significant in terms of the number of people who are plying for trade in off-peak hours.  The issue is causing tension among traffic wardens and taxi licence holders.  Incumbent drivers who work on a full-time basis see new entrants who are driving part time or not parking correctly.  Is the regulator liaising with local authorities in regard to rectifying problems of this nature? No mention was made in the presentation of the number of plates issued to cater for people with disabilities.  The Labour Party published a document which recommended an initial target of making 20% of the fleet wheelchair accessible by 2012 and a longer term objective of 100% accessibility.  How near is the current fleet to meeting these targets?
10452	SeanSherlock	Labour	13348.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	73	 I want to challenge the language used by Ms Doyle.  She stated that there was a decline in the rate of new entrants relative to last year but the number of licences being issued is increasing.  In County Cork, the number of licensed vehicles has increased from 2,238 to 2,382 and driver licences have increased from 4,285 to 4,555.  She asserts that light touch regulation is the way to go and that the market should be allowed to settle into its own equilibrium.  If I follow through on the logic of her argument, the rate of increase will probably drop to zero or 0.1%.  Then the market will find its equilibrium.  At the end of the day, it will have major consequences for the livelihood of people in full-time employment.  It will have major consequences for smaller towns throughout the country which are not able to deal with the extra capacity.  In towns such as Mallow, where more than 50 licences have been issued, the number of taxis is having a major impact on traffic movement in the town and is causing major tension for the existing licence holders.  The regulator may say that the market will find its own level but the market is imperfect because one cannot apply the permutations of the market evenly across the country because of topography and geography. The regulator may talk about Washington DC, which is a major metropolitan area, but when considering the issuance of licences in Ireland, one must take account of having too many licences in certain parts of the country.  That is my central point.  One has to factor that into the model when issuing licences.  One cannot take a global figure and apply it globally because of the other factors that are not being taken into account.
10453	SeanSherlock	Labour	13348.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	75	 Has the regulator refused a licence on the basis of the negative permutations of adding one extra licence in a smaller town?
10454	SeanSherlock	Labour	13348.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	77	 How does the regulator propose to tackle the issue as part of her review if one does not propose the number of licences that will be issued?

10459	SeanSherlock	Labour	13460.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 I apologise for missing the initial contribution as I had to be in the Dáil Chamber.  Having read the submission in the meantime, I echo the points made by Deputy Kelly. I represent part of County Cork and the strong message I receive from local authority workers, particularly in the north of the county, is that the burden of health and safety legislation and regulation is impeding essential maintenance work.  Will Mr. O'Halloran clarify the role of the Health and Safety Authority in the area of road maintenance as opposed to construction?  Without wishing to raise spurious examples, many roads in north Cork are in poor state and require works to be done to fill potholes.  Perhaps I am lacking knowledge in this respect but I understand a crew comprised of four or five local authority personnel which wishes to fill a pothole must first erect signage on both approaches, install a signalling system and erect bollards.  This is ludicrous.  I am not aware of legislative provisions requiring such measures to be taken to comply with health and safety regulations when filling a pothole.  Health and safety regulation has become excessive and the health and safety industry has mushroomed in the past decade. Members of the Oireachtas are legitimately the subjects of remarkable levels of scrutiny.  Similar scrutiny should apply to the €22.6 million annual budget of the Health and Safety Authority.  With the virtual demise of the construction industry in recent years, I presume the agency's 126 inspectors have less work to do.  Where are their skills being employed?  Some €13.5 million of the HSA budget is expended on wages, while €2.2 million is spent on accommodation and €1 million alone is spent on travel and subsistence.  These figures add up to €16.7 million. As a layman in this matter, I take the forthright view that health and safety legislation places an undue burden on the ability of companies to carry out work.  We have lost the ability to employ a degree of common sense, as is borne out by my point that a whole industry has grown up around health and safety legislation.  Perhaps we should withdraw some of the burden in the light of the downturn in the economy. The issue of generic accidents at work was raised, particularly in agriculture, a sector in which I have a particular interest.  Many of these accidents can be ascribed to human error.  I do not agree that the HSA should send an inspector to every farm.  Adults who operate a business must assume a degree of responsibility for their day-to-day activities.  While I sympathise with anyone who has a workplace accident - God knows, I am aware of many who have had this misfortune - there is a degree of human error for which one cannot legislate and upon which one should not impose a regulatory regime, especially one which costs €22.6 million to the Exchequer every year in a period of major economic contraction. I am raising these matters to elicit an opinion from Mr. O'Halloran.  There may be a valid justification for the authority's budget in the current climate.  What is the average salary of a field inspector?  A distinction was made between policy and field inspectors.  If there are 197 staff, of whom 126 are inspectors, what is the role and function of the remaining 71 employees in the organisation? Reference was made to a judicial review in connection with local authorities.  I did not understand the point that was being made, although I may have misheard it.  I seek clarification on the process of judicial review and the demarcation between the role of the Health and Safety Authority and that of local authorities.
10460	SeanSherlock	Labour	13460.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 I thank the delegates.  In the value for money report, the economic regulatory unit found the HSA had relatively low costs compared with other national and international regulators.  Perhaps the HSA would be kind enough to forward the report to the committee.  We would appreciate it.

Ms Smith's contribution suggests that there is a difference in approach to the regulation of brokers compared with the banking sector, which is subject to a lighter touch.  What is the solution?  PIBA is seeking one primary codified set of regulations embodied in legislation.  Ms Smith stated, ""A primary objective is to collate all applicable legislative requirements and then provide brokers with guidelines to assist them in how best to ensure that they comply with all legislative obligations in their day-to-day business"".  Is current regulation weak in general?  Does legislation need to be changed?"

10465	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	36	 I welcome the delegation to the committee.  It is extraordinary that there has been such a shift in the language from the Irish Banking Federation.  We are now into the language of corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, trust, regulation and regaining of trust.  It is as if there has been a sea change in terms of attitudes within the banking sector.  If the story on the ground is to be believed, it would appear that for real people who bank in this country there has been absolutely no change whatsoever in the culture and that the small businesses and the like continue to be squeezed.  Why is it that the banks are cutting off credit to small businesses?  It is impossible to get figures.  If I line up 100 people, small businesses, I can guarantee that at least 60% to 70% will say there has been a surreptitious squeezing of their credit lines.  There is no question about that and one cannot deny it.  I ask the Irish Banking Federation to come clean about it and state why it is doing it, how long it will continue and give some degree of transparency to that notion. I listened carefully to what the witnesses said about the difference between the consumer mandate and the prudential mandate in terms of supervision.  They said that the consumer mandate was prioritised over prudential supervision.  To my mind, that is another way of hanging the pre-existing regulator out to dry.  I do not believe for one moment that the witnesses cared one jot about the whole regulatory regime in this country in recent years because, metaphorically speaking, you were all like pigs at a trough making potloads of money and the whole regulatory regime did not exist.  I remain to be convinced as to whether the witnesses are genuine when they say they will buy into the new European regulatory framework.  We will all watch Brussels and the position of the Irish Banking Federation and its lobbying arm at the European table on whether it will buy into new supervisory EU rules.  It remains to be seen whether it is genuine in that regard. I wish to ask about the SPV again because I did not quite understand the answer given by the Irish Banking Federation.  Is it that the witnesses do not fully understand the nature of the SPV as it relates to NAMA or that they have not been given any direction from the Government as to whether the banks could be investors in the private segment of that particular vehicle?  Will they clarify their understanding of the SPV at present?  If they say they are not sure how it will pan out, then it beggars belief to a layman like me that a chief executive of the Irish Banking Federation would come before an Oireachtas committee and state that. In regard to the mutually acceptable arrangement or the formal agreement with MABS, will the Irish Banking Federation and the banks in this country take an active, fiduciary stake to ensure that MABS will be able to operate at an efficient level?  The reason I ask that question is that the people who approach me with mortgage difficulties, whom I refer to MABS, have to wait three, four or five weeks to get an appointment.  MABS is currently at the pin of its collar.  I am sceptical when I hear bankers saying they are now working with MABS as active stakeholders in seeking to ease the burden for people who find themselves in financial difficulty.  If the witnesses tell me there is formal agreement there I will take that in good faith.  If the banks are about to become active stakeholders in the MABS process — I realise we are talking about a State body — by lending personnel or making a financial contribution, I welcome that.  However, I would like an expansion of the explanation to determine the qualitative nature of the relationship. Mr. Farrell stated that there had been 21 repossessions, but how many applications for repossession have the banks made?  There is a difference between the number of repossessions in a particular year and the number of applications made.  For example, if the bank was about to repossess my house tomorrow morning, the chances are that I would go to see my bank manager on an informal basis and we would seek to work things out.  The distinction between applications and actual repossession must be made.  This is related to the announcement today about the six-month grace period for mortgage holders who cannot meet their payments.  I give credit to the federation for stating it would extend that period beyond six months if necessary.  However, unless it is put on a statutory basis, the level of trust in the banks may be a bit sketchy.  We remain doubtful. I would like to see a shift in corporate social responsibility.  I am a customer of a bank and my relationship with the bank on a local level is quite a good one which, like all customers, I have built over time.  However, for many people at the moment it seems to be a one-way street.  I do not think customers feel, necessarily, that the banking regime is working in their favour in assisting them, their own customers, in getting out of the difficulties they are in.

Mr. Farrell is saying he is sure some applications are being treated in certain ways.  Is he saying there are lines of credit extended to people who should not have them?
10467	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 I would like some clarification on that.  Is Mr. Farrell stating that the Irish Banking Federation supports the current European Commission proposal without qualification?
10468	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	45	 If Mr. Farrell answers the question about the number of applications for repossession I am sure Mr. O'Regan can tell me how many of those people were referred to MABS in the first instance before IBF members made those applications.  I am not being disingenuous about this.
10469	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 Perhaps Mr. O'Regan might answer my question on the number of applications for repossession.
10470	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	49	 If Mr. O'Regan can say that definitively then he can give me the numbers.
10471	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	52	 My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, will speak in greater detail on this.  We are trying to establish how it might be possible to ease the burden for mortgage holders who find themselves suddenly unemployed.  Given what we have read about the banking sector and the goings on in recent years I must have a sense that I can go back to my constituents in Cork East and tell them with some degree of confidence that if they find themselves in trouble with their mortgage there is a good chance the new six-month regime will work.  Because of the level of mistrust of the banking sector at present there are still questions about that process and whether it will work if it is not put on a statutory footing.
10472	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 That is all back office work.

10475	SeanSherlock	Labour	13488.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	71	 I would like to respond to that for fear my remarks are misinterpreted.  I am very mindful of the fact that we need to protect jobs in the financial services sector, I worked in that sector.  I am concerned about the damage that has been done to our international reputation by practices in the banking sector.  That is where I am coming from.

10488	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	140	" I welcome Professor Honohan to the committee and congratulate him on his appointment.  I have witnessed a perceptible shift today in the language to which we have become accustomed from officials when dealing with the financial crisis, something which must be acknowledged.  I do not wish to denigrate other officials in any way for the language they use, but we are now in an era where we want things to be explained to us by officials such as Professor Honohan in a manner which everybody can understand and which is frank.  That is important for the future. I appreciate the fact that Professor Honohan is answering these questions honestly and openly.  It is refreshing.  I hope, when we look forward to the quarterly Central Bank reports, that if there are whisperings of bad omens on the wind they are not buried imperceptibly in language in the reports and are backed up by strong language from the Governor of the Central Bank, if that is a necessary course of action. I wish to return to the issue of Anglo Irish Bank.  I have to ask a question on behalf the people of Cork East, who I represent.  Like many people throughout the country, they are asking why, in the name of God, are we bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and nationalising it?  I do not think that question was answered sufficiently.  I appreciate that the decision is made and that Professor Honohan is coming from an academic background — he has stated that — but is now a banker.  As he is a banker I would like an honest view on whether we should cast it adrift.  If the capitalist model into which we have bought in this country is to be followed logically, whatever about AIB and Bank of Ireland, there is a school of thought which suggests Anglo Irish Bank should be let off.  The €4 billion and the €4 billion eile it is looking for will cast a noose around the necks of Irish people which we will have to wear for a long time. My second questions relates to the issue of prudential rules.  In his opening statement, Professor Honohan said, ""There has been greatly intensified and what has been termed ""intrusive"" supervision of the operations of the main banks covered by the guarantee"".  If I read this sentence one way, it could suggest ""intrusive"" was negative, but if read another way it could be positive.  It is negative in that the existing staff in the banks which are covered by the guarantee are not too happy about the intrusive nature of the new staffing arrangements with Professor Honohan's people.  Is that causing friction?  If so, why is it causing friction?  Will it need to continue for a considerable period of time until this issue is worked out?  How long will the situation continue for? The new prudential rules which will come into force will be largely determined by Brussels and the European Union.  The fear I have is that the Irish Government, as is often the case, will follow the City of London or the Government of the United Kingdom in terms of prudential rules regarding financial services.  If we are to be realistic about overhauling prudential rules in the future, and if there is a majority view which is contrary to the position of the United Kingdom, we should take a very responsible position.  I would like to hear Professor Honohan's views on the matter. On the macro situation, last night a Minister said on television that at least we are not Greece and that we should look at how bad things are there, which was an extraordinary statement.  If we are now being compared with Greece, we know things are really bad.  Is there a role for the Governor of the Central Bank vis-à-vis the European Central Bank, in terms of influencing monetary policy in particular, and fiscal policy?  I am not necessarily espousing that but I want to get a view on the theory that a devaluation of the currency would sort out some of our problems.  I am looking for a macro view but I would also like to hear Professor Honohan’s personal opinion on that. On the issue of remuneration, will the staff of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority be taking a pay cut?  I refer Mr. Honohan to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill 2009 being debated in the House as we speak.  The Schedule to that Bill clearly shows that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland are bodies to which the definition of ""public service body"" does not apply.  Those bodies were excluded from the Schedule to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act and presumably they were subjected to the levies imposed as a result of the enactment of that legislation.  My question is whether Mr. Honohan will be taking a hair cut — that term has been used — and, if not, why not?  In Mr. Honohan's opinion, why has the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland been included in the Schedule to the No. 2 Bill when it was not previously?  Was the Minister for Finance lobbied in regard to that issue? I raise this issue because the previous regulator, and this must be restated, got out of Dodge with approximately €600,000 in his back pocket.  A constituent of mine would ask me these questions and how he managed to do that.  If public sector workers, for instance, who are on €30,000 a year are taking a haircut of €1,500 as per the legislation proposed today, why are bodies like the regulatory body not doing the same?"
10489	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	144	 I have a number of questions and I ask for some leeway from the Chair.
10490	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	146	 Is any man or woman worth that amount of money?  Professor Honohan will talk about the relativity of taking the pay cut vis-à-vis——
10491	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	148	 He would not have come for less.
10492	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	150	 How is this country still in a scenario where we are paying that kind of money to people to overhaul a regulatory framework given that the European Union regulatory framework will be overhauled and there will be a large buy-in by the Irish State into that process anyway? It could be done for a considerably reduced cost than the princely sum of €400,000 plus the bonus if he reaches a target.  We need to move away from the culture of spending that kind of money on public officials when there are other people in the State who are taking savage cuts.  It does not make sense to ordinary people.  Ordinary people will look at that and say it is obscene.
10493	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	152	 I will park that issue and respectfully agree to disagree with Mr. Honohan.
10494	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	160	 In a pre-guarantee scenario---
10495	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	162	 In a pre-guarantee scenario there is a school of thought that says that Anglo Irish Bank is a failed entity and that one should have cast it adrift.  While there would have been a tremor, the systemic effects for the economy as a whole would arguably not have been too high on the Richter scale.
10496	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	164	 I appreciate that and I suppose we are trying to look to the future.  With that in mind, does Professor Honohan feel he has perfect knowledge as to what is going on within Anglo Irish Bank?
10497	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	166	 My other question was about Greece.
10498	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	168	 If we buy into that scenario — and arguably the main political parties have bought into that agenda — the question that is still outstanding for people of my generation, who have taken on massive amounts of debt, is that the debt is not being restructured in any great shape or fashion, but wages are coming down significantly.  There is a real problem there.
10499	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	170	 We are trying to get to the nub of the situation.  If one has a statutory pension scheme then arguably one will provide a greater degree of security for people.  If there is a code of conduct, however, there is nothing to suggest at this stage that the banks will adhere to any kind of code.
10500	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	172	 It concerns the operation of the mortgage moratorium where somebody finds himself or herself in trouble.
10501	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	174	 I am not convinced that mortgage interest relief is necessarily the only way to go.  That will provide some relief, but there will be a certain number of people who cannot repay mortgages.  For instance, when this Bill is enacted, which it invariably will be, a certain percentage of the population earning €40,000 or less, will no longer be able to pay their mortgages, in spite of the fact that prices are falling in the economy.  That will have a knock-on effect.  They remain to be convinced that the banking structure, as it currently exists, will adequately give them a break if they find themselves in difficulty and start missing payments, which they invariably will after this on Thursday.  I appreciate that Professor Honohan is not necessarily in a position to comment on the legislation that is going ahead, but from a layman's point of view, and anecdotal evidence of those who are now in real financial difficulty, there is a perception that the banks are getting off lightly in terms of putting together something that would give people a break on their mortgages.
10502	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	176	 If we increase capitalisation, that scenario will prove to be the case.

10519	SeanSherlock	Labour	13572.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	" I welcome the delegates to the joint committee.  On page 7, the submission states: ""Our concerns in this regard have already been heightened by the recent news that the Registrar of Credit Unions, when recruited, will report to the newly appointed assistant director general for financial supervision in general, rather than the Director General or CEO, as is currently the case.""  On page 9 it states: ""In light of this, the ILCU board is proposing that a new independent credit union regulator be established under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.""  Even if the regulatory regime was such that the ILCU reported directly to a director general under the auspices of the Central Bank, what is the difference between that and a new regulatory regime under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment? We all recognise the role of credit unions and the amazing work they do.  As Deputy Ardagh said, they have provided a backbone for many communities because their ethos is very different from that of banks and other financial institutions.  We want to find a compromise that will ensure the future growth of the credit union movement and put in place a regulatory regime that ensures there is confidence.  If the new regulatory regime was under the Central Bank would it not be a safer house, given that the regulatory regime should change for the better once the de Larosière and European Commission proposals are introduced?"
10520	SeanSherlock	Labour	13572.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	 With regard to the availability of credit, the credit union movement has a particular view on section 35 of the Act.  I understand section 35 provides that not more than 20% of credit unions' loan books may be out on loan for longer than five years.  In these constrained times when vast numbers of people seek to reschedule their loans, does this have a negative impact on credit unions' ability to deliver a surplus, operate properly or allow a greater degree of flexibility for ordinary members throughout the country who might want to reschedule?  Has the Minister given any consideration to amending section 35 to allow for that so that the people who take out the car loans and who cannot make payments can extend the life of the loan?  Currently they are hampered from doing so because section 35 has not been amended.  What is the view of the delegates on that?  I understand a submission has been made in this regard, but we are unaware of the position on that currently.
10521	SeanSherlock	Labour	13572.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	30	 Has the Minister given a specific date for that order?
10522	SeanSherlock	Labour	13572.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	 With respect for the submission made, I have yet to be convinced.  We all recognise that a different ethos exists within the credit union movement from that which created the fiasco that was the banking crisis, with some notable exceptions within the credit union movement.  However, as a percentage of overall credit union activity, the less than kosher practices used in some credit unions seem minuscule.  By and large we all agree credit unions are well marshalled because of the individual ethos of members and boards at local level who do a great job in ensuring the ethos is maintained.  However, if the movement is to convince me, as one humble member of this committee, that it should have an independent regulator, it would need to make a stronger case for inclusion under the current central bank commission than that it is separating from the banking regime.  The changes that will come down the line in that regard will be stringent.  If the credit union movement, where the regulatory regime is already quite strong, is within that framework, I do not see how this would be a problem for them.

10527	SeanSherlock	Labour	13586.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Prelude	12	" I welcome the delegation to the committee meeting.  At the last meeting the credit unions' role in society was acknowledged. Is there a gulf in the positions on the regulatory framework between the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, and the CUDA?  I remain to be convinced about the ILCU's position.  The only way one can guarantee that individual members have maximum security for their deposits is through the auspices of the Central Bank commission. The opening statement stated: ""CUDA believes the current structure is appropriate.  The performance and future development of credit unions needs to be underpinned by a properly resourced, separate and differentiated system of statutory regulation for the credit union sector within the overall Central Bank and the Department of Finance structure."" Will the delegation clarify exactly what this means? The CUDA obviously recognises the role of the Registrar of Credit Unions but it is also seeking to differentiate between its role and that of the banks while keeping under the umbrella of the Central Bank.  Are the credit unions happy reporting to the assistant director general under the Financial Regulator's office?  Would it suggest any modifications to this system? Mr. Mark Bailey of the ILCU told me at the last meeting that it had been in negotiations with the Department concerning the provisions governing the percentage and periods for loans in section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  He said the Minister will shortly sign an order which will increase the percentage provision to 30%.  Some people I have spoken to informally about this have reservations about it from a liquidity perspective.  It is important the committee fleshes this out if it is going to take a rational long-term view on it.  How would such a proposal impact on the CUDA?  It represents 275,000 credit union members through 11 credit unions. Credit unions offer mainstream financial services including savings, loans, various insurance, foreign exchange, ATM cards, electronic funds transfer payments, child benefit and social welfare payments, mortgages in limited cases and other mainstream financial services.  It is impossible to see how anyone can justify a different regime of regulation for one set of industry operatives such as banks and building societies and argue for a lesser form of protection to apply to credit unions when they are dealing in the exact same products.  Ultimately, the committee is left with the ILCU, representative of the majority of credit unions, and the CUDA.  The committee wants a system that both bodies will buy into and that will stand up to scrutiny."
10528	SeanSherlock	Labour	13586.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 Increasing the loan percentage allowed from 20% to 30% would allow a credit union a greater degree of flexibility in individual loans.  For instance, if I had a car loan with my credit union but was put to the pin of my collar financially, I could extend the loan's lifetime.  What are the permutations for individual credit unions?  If there are still difficulties with extending it by 10%, what is the optimal solution?
10529	SeanSherlock	Labour	13586.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 Section 35 needs to be clarified then.  The extension from 20% to 30% is not providing the panacea.  The committee may need further clarification on this matter from departmental officials or the Minister about this proposal.

10535	SeanSherlock	Labour	13593.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	" I will be blunt.  When I read sentences such as, ""It does not permit stakeholders an opportunity to show flexibility in the application of regulatory instruction or a measurement of appropriateness in its interpretation"", I can understand it but will the delegates give a layman's view?  We have had representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions before us and will receive representations from managers shortly.  We are trying to listen to as many stakeholders as possible.  We are trying to get a view on section 35, for example, and the current regulatory regime.  The delegates have spoken about opportunities to show flexibility.  In the context of Irish legislation, does this mean amending section 35 of the Credit Union Act?  When speaking about the appropriateness of interpretation, does this refer to section 35 or something completely different?  The two issues in which I have a particular interest concern section 35 of the Act and the current regulatory regime.  There is one school of thought which suggests it must be under the auspices of the regulator's office under the umbrella of the Central Bank.  However, there is another school of thought which suggests it should be a function of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or other such Department.  I am trying to get the delegates' view and ascertain whether we should be moving towards the Australian model.  Are we okay where we are? If CUNA is the body for credit unions in North America, I presume the model in place there is not dissimilar to the one in place here.  Will the delegates explain the differences from the punter's perspective?  In the Irish context the guy on the street will use a credit union to take out a car loan.  Does the credit union in North America serve a similar function, or is it a more extensive function more like a banking facility?  If that is the case, is CUNA Mutual Europe's aim for us to move in that direction?  Where does it see itself relative to the ILCU and other representative credit union organisations?"

10539	SeanSherlock	Labour	13600.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	" I wish thank the officials for appearing before the committee.  On a first reading of the submission, it appears that Mr. Kearns is talking common sense in terms of the approach to prudential supervision, the stabilisation fund and the need for some degree of flexibility in section 35.  While the Minister seems to be sympathetic to people who find themselves constrained by the fact that their loans have finite term limits, and one needs to reflect the reality of people's lives by extending the lifetime of a loan, the question now arises as to the effect that will have on liquidity ratios and so forth.  I would like to hear a view from the officials to flesh that out and explain in practical terms what the Minister or the Department might propose on section 35 for allowing people to have more flexibility, but without affecting a credit union's own liquidity ratios.  How will they get around that particular issue? I acknowledge that things have moved on significantly since the McDowell report.  In his statement, Mr. Kearns said that ""recognising these factors, the Government decision of June 2009 on the reform of financial regulatory structures determined that there would be no change in the positioning of the Registrar of Credit Unions within the framework of the new, integrated structure for the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator"".  To be clear, does that mean that the regulation of credit unions will remain within the ambit or under the umbrella of the Central Bank?  If that is the case, will the reporting procedure be changed in any way?  For instance, will the registrar report directly to the head of financial regulation, or is it proposed that the registrar will report directly to the assistant director general?  Given the nature of credit unions, and the differentiation that we make between banks and not-for-profit friendly societies whose surplus is redistributed, could we make a case that the reporting procedure would be such that they would report directly to the Financial Regulator?  That covers section 35 and the reporting mechanism. Is it now proposed that the review will examine the stabilisation fund with a view to bringing all credit unions, no matter what their size, into that remit?  How will that play out in practical terms?  Mr. Kearns said the Minister for Finance has stated that his preferred option is to have a proofed stabilisation arrangement in place for all credit unions in addition to having the deposit guarantee scheme in place.  There is a double effect then with the stabilisation fund, so how is it envisaged that the stabilisation fund will work for smaller credit unions which would not be operating on the same economies of scale as larger ones?  I would be glad if Mr. Kearns could tease out those points."
10540	SeanSherlock	Labour	13600.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 Mr. Kearns stated they will look for specific recommendations.  Will they come from the sector itself or will he make recommendations?

I want to continue in the same vein as Deputy O'Donnell.  I am trying to gain a better understanding of our regulatory position, particularly regarding the activities of stockbrokers.  If I understand the matter correctly, the markets in financial instruments directive has actually left a gap in the regulatory framework as it relates to non-consumer activity.  In other words, stockbrokers may not be investigated by the Irish Stock Exchange in regard to certain types of activities.  If I am wrong, I stand corrected.  Will the delegates flesh out the matter in layman's terms? I make this point because the delegates' submission states: It is important to note that MiFID did not provide an explicit mechanism for investigating non-consumer complaints against providers of financial services, including stockbrokers.  As the definition of ""consumer"" in Irish legislation is relatively narrow, the exchange was concerned that this previously available mechanism was to be removed. I presume it is still removed but housed under the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator."

10555	SeanSherlock	Labour	13607.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 That clarifies the issue.  I appreciate the clarification.  With regard to reporting mechanisms or the ongoing communication between the Financial Regulator and the Irish Stock Exchange, it appears there is a weakness in the communications strategy.  Is it the case that there is potential for a positive role for the Irish Stock Exchange in strengthening the regulatory framework but that it is leaving it to the Financial Regulator to effect change?  There seems to be no formal communications network or strategy.  Will the delegation give me a sense of whether this is correct?
10556	SeanSherlock	Labour	13607.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Prelude	41	 That has clarified the matter.  I asked for short selling to be put on the agenda precisely because the ban has been lifted in other jurisdictions.  I accept the explanation of the Irish Stock Exchange in this regard.  We all accept, on some level, that it is a necessary function in terms of liquidity provision.  That is a given but it is a matter of how the instrument is used in particular jurisdictions.  In our jurisdiction, it gave rise to certain questions. With regard to the disclosure regimes, Ms Somers stated: A degree of stability has returned to the markets and many regulators have withdrawn the bans that were imposed, replacing them for the most part with disclosure regimes.  However, the Irish market is unique [...].  For this reason, withdrawing the ban in a similar manner to other jurisdictions is not necessarily the correct decision for Ireland at this time. However, in Ms Somers's conclusion, she stated the replacement of the short-selling ban with a move to an Irish approach consistent with a harmonised European disclosure regime may be the correct approach.  Could a disclosure regime operating according to a pan-European rules-based approach be introduced to the Irish market?

10563	SeanSherlock	Labour	13621.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-23 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I welcome Ms Gilleece and Mr. Molan to the committee.  It is unfortunate that the Cabinet reshuffle is taking precedence today. I welcome the presentation which is direct and unequivocal.  The language is not coded in any way and clearly sets out the intentions and aspirations of CUMA.  That is what we need to hear in the committee.  A number of disparate views have been expressed on the application of section 35 and on the regulatory regime.  There is a clear divide between the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, and the ILCU with regard to the regulatory framework.  Has CUMA a criticism to make with regard to the ILCU proposals to have the regulatory framework housed under a Department?  If I remember correctly, the ILCU attested that the regulatory framework for credit unions should be outside of the Central Bank commission.  The only route to take is under the umbrella of the Central Bank commission, but how that is finessed is a matter for discussion.  I take the same view as CUMA with regard to a direct reporting system to the head of financial regulation rather than to a sub-head or assistant director.  If we are to recognise the importance of the credit union and the primacy of its role within society, it must be given due recognition with regard to the reporting role.  That is common sense.  What is the CUMA position with regard to the ILCU position? I am amazed that CUMA is not part of the working group on section 35, as I was given to understand that all of the stakeholders would be actively involved in the process.  Bearing that in mind and based on what CUMA has said about the section 35 working group and the indebtedness working group, the committee should take a strong stance with regard to CUMA membership of both of those working groups.  If we are to achieve anything from this meeting, the committee should request the Minister, or demand of him if that is within our remit, to involve CUMA in those two working groups.  This makes sense.  CUMA is made up of credit union managers and it would be remiss not to involve it as part of the working group. Section 35 is the big issue.  CUMA has set out clearly the permutations for the ordinary credit union member.  While CUMA is not part of the section 35 working group, it appears from its submission that it has an insight into the proposals.  What is the optimum solution with regard to section 35?  CUMA has outlined its critique of the section, in terms of the 20% of the loan book over five years provision and whether this is effective in terms of the liquidity scenario for a given credit union.  What direction should the Minister take on section 35?  If CUMA was to write or amend the legislation or the particular section, how would it do that?  CUMA's submission makes sense.  We need common sense in terms of the approach the regulatory framework should take and in terms of section 35.  CUMA is speaking my language on this matter.  However, if I am to push a position along the lines of an unequivocal analysis of section 35 with regard to what CUMA would like to see occur, it would be very helpful to me and members of the committee to have CUMA's views on what should be done.
10564	SeanSherlock	Labour	13621.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-23 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 Ms Gilleece mentioned the withdrawal of banking services.  Does CUMA aspire to filling a gap and expanding its services even further?  The ordinary layman is concerned that credit unions will become de facto banks and, therefore, lose some of their ethos.  I do not have particular concerns about that, but it is something that may be said.  If that is its aspiration, how far does CUMA want to take it?  At what point might it stop being an organisation with a duty of care?  It was stated that every financial institution has a duty of care to its stakeholders, depositors or whatever, but that is not always the case in reality.  I would like to understand the aspiration and whether we are talking about a potential reshaping of the credit union movement or whether the original ethos will be protected.  Is there a danger the ethos could falter?  I would like to understand and get some sense of CUMA's aspiration.

10569	SeanSherlock	Labour	13628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I welcome the former Registrar of Credit Unions.  He is certainly not pulling any punches, which we welcome.  Sometimes what is needed is plain language.  Is Mr. Logue aware that the Central Bank Reform Bill has been published?  What are his views on the section 35 issues we have been addressing here in recent weeks? Mr. Logue's submission referred to the appointment of officers through the AGM.  Is he suggesting that there should be changes to that mechanism?  While he will forgive me if I am misinterpreting what he said, perhaps his view is that the person appointed is the lowest common denominator, but he or she might not always be the right person for a job on a board.  Any credit union board member I have ever met was appointed because he or she has a significant body of experience and knows his or her individual credit union intimately.  Is he suggesting that there should be a regulatory framework for the appointment of particular officers to boards and that there should be rules governing that?  I know there will be in-house rules.  Stemming from that, the voluntary nature of credit unions is such that I would have certain concerns if we were to apply barriers to entry for certain persons by virtue of the fact that they do not hold certain financial qualifications.  At the same time I have an open mind on it. The committee has been offered differing views on the reporting mechanism for the Registrar of Credit Unions.  One view is that the regulatory framework for credit unions should be housed under a Department.  Another view is that it should be housed under the umbrella of the Central Bank of Ireland, but that the reporting mechanism should be either directly to the director or to an assistant director.  There might be sense in having a reporting procedure that ensures that within the regulatory office under the umbrella of the Central Bank of Ireland there would be a board that contains experts in the credit union field to which each of the credit unions or each of the bodies would then report.  It seems that within the Financial Regulator's office there might have been a dearth of intimate knowledge on the workings of the credit unions.  It is fair to say that Mr. Logue's role as registrar was one which was quite effectual — I do not mean to plámás in saying that — in that he had a very firm hand in terms of the rules and regulations.  However, if a new regulatory regime comes in, we need to find how the credit union movement would best fit into that new regulatory regime, where it would be housed, where the reporting should be and whether there should be a separate board or body of people with specific expertise within the regulatory house under the Central Bank of Ireland to deal with credit unions.
10570	SeanSherlock	Labour	13628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 A credit union customer of long standing, for example 20 years, who had a car loan, might lose his job and his financial circumstances would change literally overnight.  He may be paying a set amount per week over a fixed period of time.  While he might default on one or two of those payments he might take responsibility and go in to visit his credit union manager.  If that loan can be stretched out for a longer period of time on a reduced payment on the proviso that he will honour his commitments, is that not part of the credit union ethos?  It allows for a degree of flexibility and there is an element of trust.  By and large the ratio of impairments for credit union customers is probably negligible — I do not have exact figures.  However, where a degree of flexibility is shown, the likelihood is that the loan will be repaid albeit over a period of time, by relaxing the section 35 provisions the credit union would take cognisance of the realities of the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment.
10571	SeanSherlock	Labour	13628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 If Mr. Logue agrees with the changes to section 35 and takes flexibility into account how can he address that in the accounting procedures to ensure there is no profligacy and that he keeps a tight stricture on those same procedures?
10572	SeanSherlock	Labour	13628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Prelude	12	 God forbid.
10573	SeanSherlock	Labour	13628.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	 Is Mr. Logue referring specifically to the amendment to the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order that allowed credit unions to invest in such investments?  There was a relaxing of the order in, I believe, 2006 which if I am not mistaken allowed credit unions to undertake such investments.  It could be argued that this change to the regulation, although it did not exactly force credit unions to invest outside their normal investment vehicles, meant that if they wanted to do so this was perhaps the only way for them to go.  It is one school of thought.  I do not necessarily say I subscribe to it myself.

10579	SeanSherlock	Labour	13643.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-14 00:00:00	Prelude	10	" I welcome Mr. Elderfield to the committee in his role as Financial Regulator.  He will be aware that he has been dubbed the ""sheriff of Dodge city"".  I was expecting him to come wearing a Stetson and star.  I am delighted to see that clear, unequivocal language is developing in the regulatory regime between the regulator and Professor Honohan.  There is no room for ambiguity.  We are getting a clear message that the so-called Dodge city needs to be cleaned up.  There is an acceptance among the general public in that regard. This is a broad ranging discussion in which I wish to raise a number of issues.  I would like to focus directly on Mr. Elderfield's submission on Anglo Irish Bank.  There is a school of thought that suggests it should be wound down.  Mr. Elderfield's view is that the cost of winding down the bank would be prohibitive.  How did he come to that conclusion and what is the basis of his logic in that regard? Mr. Elderfield stated a small new bank was likely to be carved out and that he would apply his process on that entity.  Will he elaborate on what he means by the process?  I presume that once all of the bad assets are transferred to NAMA he will be left with an entity.  Does he believe a new entity will be created from this?  What is the vision from his perspective? I appreciate that Mr. Elderfield would prefer to deal with the Quinn issue on a separate occasion and realise that matters are before the courts.  However, this is the first opportunity for the tribune of the people to ask questions of the regulator about Quinn Insurance.  Will Mr. Elderfield give us an insight into the motivation for his actions up to the point at which a legal process started?  For instance, did he have a mandate to tackle the solvency issues?  The reason I ask that question is that 5,000 workers feel the regulator's approach was perhaps heavy-handed.  Perhaps there was a lack of clarity as to what his motivation was and the mandate for the actions he took.  Will the regulator give us some insight into the process and the reasons behind the action he adopted? Is it technically possible for Anglo Irish Bank to take a stake in Quinn Insurance?  Some claim it is not and that this is all just optics so Anglo Irish Bank can start a bidding war among other insurance companies for Quinn Insurance.  What are the regulator's views on this, if it is possible for him to give them to the committee at this stage? The committee is examining the regulatory regime for credit unions.  There is broad consensus on section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 which will be addressed in the new Central Bank Reform Bill. However, there is no consensus among the representative bodies on the regulatory framework.  Some credit union representative organisations argue regulation in the past was overly stringent due to a lack of knowledge as to how the credit union model worked.  It is argued that to achieve more efficiency in this regard a separate regulatory board for credit unions compromising credit union managers and members should be established under the Financial Regulator's framework.  What are the regulator's views on this? Financial markets being what they are, there will always be some financial wizard to design an elaborate mechanism for making money.  Accordingly, those who regulate the markets must be almost ahead of them.  Will the cream of the financial services workforce need to be working in the Financial Regulator's office to ensure the banks do not sidestep any regulatory regime by creating elaborate mechanisms?  Does a recruitment embargo apply to Mr. Elderfield's office?  Does his office need more staff?"
10580	SeanSherlock	Labour	13643.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-14 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 On that, there is the process that led up to the instigation of judicial proceedings, and the idea of a State owned bank taking a stake in an insurance company was mooted in the public domain.  We have the regulator before us.  It is completely legitimate for us to ask questions about the process by which that could come about and whether that is a legal process, whether it is in compliance with any rules of the European Union and whether we are not setting up a potentially monopolistic position because the VHI is already in existence.  These are completely legitimate questions which are being asked by people outside these walls in any case.  I do not understand why they cannot be answered.
10581	SeanSherlock	Labour	13643.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-14 00:00:00	Prelude	138	 Are the solvency ratios for all insurance companies adequate?  I may have misheard Mr. Elderfield earlier but I thought he said two insurance companies were under investigation.  Will he clarify whether he has investigated or begun proceedings against other companies?  If that is the case, will he elaborate on which companies are involved, if possible?
10582	SeanSherlock	Labour	13643.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-14 00:00:00	Prelude	10	 I thank Mr. Elderfield very much for this afternoon's deliberations.  It was an extremely beneficial meeting and we look forward to further meetings with the regulator in the not too distant future.

10585	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	11	 I join in welcoming Mr. Delaney to the committee.  I return to the regulatory burden and the €300 million to €400 million estimated cost of regulation to small businesses.  He stated that the process ongoing is positive.  It sounds as if he hopes there will be a positive outcome.  In practical terms I wonder whether, for instance, the taxation burden to small businesses is seen as one of those inputs into reducing the cost burden, and whether, for instance, matters such as health and safety rules and regulations are part of that cost burden, and also the sub-contracting element. I suppose I am tacking slightly differently on the sub-contracting issue.  One of the issues arising is the inability of sub-contractors to collect on invoices.  It appears that there does not seem to be a set of rules on obligations in that sense and many small businesses have been left high and dry by bigger contractors.  Would a regulatory framework cover that relationship also?  When the small guys, particularly those in the construction industry who sub-contracted for the bigger construction firms were left swinging in the wind when they came to collect their money, they were told in no uncertain terms where to go and where they were in the pecking order.  Is that covered in the regulatory burden as well in terms of rules and regulations that could be put in place? I mention health and safety as a regulatory burden because the regulatory burden on small businesses, especially in the food industry is particularly onerous.  Under HACCP legislation the HSE is bearing down on them like a ton of bricks in pursuit of small menial type jobs and it places a cost burden on those businesses that one does not see in other countries.  Has that been explored? I mention the tax burden because two small businesses with which I have dealt, which have met their VAT obligations, for instance, for the 12 month period, because the preliminary payment was underpaid found that they had to pay the interest on that thereafter.  That too is something that needs to be overhauled.  All of these are cost inputs for the business into the future, regardless of what type of business one runs.  We cannot look at the regulatory framework without looking at those cost burdens that businesses must bear. Perhaps I am tacking slightly away from the substantive issue before us but the small business sector has become a soft target for revenue collection in the absence of being able to collect it from the traditional sources.  I would welcome IBEC's view on it.  The burden has been shifted considerably towards this system.  When I look at small businesses, particularly family-run businesses which are operating today, which have operated intergenerationally, and which have also cut their cloth to measure, I see that the burden being placed on them through increased regulation is stifling them.  Perhaps Mr. Delaney would give a view on that. On the country that we should emulate, is there a suggestion that the UK is the benchmark by which we should operate?  Is there something from a legislative point of view this committee should take on board which would affect regulation and which would reduce that burden if necessary?
10586	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 I presume the Construction Industry Federation comes under the IBEC umbrella.
10587	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 I presume there are large contractors, construction interests or suppliers to the trade who come under that umbrella.
10588	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 I raise this matter as I am of the view that the late payments legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written.  If one is a small contractor in north Cork, doing work for a major construction company and tries to use that legislation in order to pursue it for payment, it is the case that one will never work in that part of the country again.  In the context of relationships among businesses which are represented by groups such as IBEC and the CIF, surely a voluntary mechanism could be put in place in order to ensure smaller interests would be paid.  That is not happening and such interests are being squeezed out.  When we refer to the lifeblood of the economy, we must remember that small contractors have kept things going on a local level and provided much employment.  I sense that the legislation is not really effective and that the groups which represent the people concerned such as IBEC must come forward with proposals to progress the matter.
10589	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 I appreciate that.
10590	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 I take Mr. Delaney's point.  People operate their businesses and enter into contracts primarily on the basis of good faith.  That is particularly the case for small contractors entering into arrangements with reputable firms.  For example, if one is going into business with a so-called blue chip construction firm, one can take it on good faith that, based on the law of averages, one should receive payment for one's endeavours.  No one is suggesting representatives of such small businesses should act as if they were above the law.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests that they would better represent the various interests by seeking to put pressure on people they worked for or subcontracted to and there is a sense the small guy is not getting the representation he should.  Mr. Delaney might not accept that but sometimes the small guy cannot put his head above the parapet because if he does, he is gone.
10591	SeanSherlock	Labour	13649.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 Mr. Delaney mentioned 133,000 job losses in the construction industry and 145,000 in the retail sector.  There is a great deal of debate currently about the smart economy and the concept of upskilling but vague language is being used.  How can we get these people back to work, particularly those who worked in the construction industry and who have a skill set because nothing will be built in the near future?  One school of thought is that a massive stock of older houses need upgrading and that process could be incentivised through retrofits and so on.  Is it realistic in IBEC's view that many of these guys can be pooled and put back to work in that sector?  These are dramatic figures.  Not all of the former retail workers will return to the retail sector because that is demand-led and so on. Reference is repeatedly made to high-end services, upskilling, fourth level education, start-up companies and so on but that will only take up some of the slack.  From a businessman's perspective, where does Mr. Delaney see potential for this country in the future?

10599	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	 I want to look at the recommendations, set out in the presentation which states: There needs to be a review of the objectives of regulation as, in our opinion, neither the objectives nor reasons for regulation are fully understood by the public service or the wider political stakeholders. Is it Mr. Fielding's view, given that he has quoted the CSO example in that firm, that the CSO imposes an obligation through the Statistics Act, on businesses to supply the figures but that the CSO has no clear understanding of the administrative or cost burden that places on the business and it is acting as just one arm of Government to do that?  In effect, Government needs to ensure that businesses are not over regulated in a way that increases their administrative functions for no stated aim at the end of the day, except that it gathers figures which may or may not be used productively.  Is the higher level group on business regulation looking at that specific topic and getting into the nitty gritty to ensure that business function is taken away from that business person so that he or she does not have to waste a number of labour hours over the course of a week preparing material for which there is no gain to the business person and only adds to his burden of work?
10600	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 In terms of the regulatory process as a whole, Mr. Fielding makes the distinction between the light touch regulation of the banks and the heavy regulation for SMEs.  I am sympathetic to everything that has been stated here because we deal with them at the front end.  For example, in regard to Revenue, there are scenarios where agreements are struck between businesses and Revenue in regard to outstanding obligations for taxation and so on but what is happening in the SME sector is that guys are not able to collect the money outstanding and due to them.  While one gets a sense that Revenue is flexible in stretching out the time lines and is coming up with agreed repayment schedules, the agreement on a repayment schedule is made in good faith by the SME but what happens is that the goalposts shift further in that the person who owes the money outstanding is not in a position to pay and then the heavy hand comes back down on the business.  I am dealing with one such engineering firm in north Cork which is finding it very difficult to get to talk to Revenue.  The reason he is finding it difficult is that having already been in to Revenue and drawn up a schedule, the payments due on invoices have not come in and Revenue is now putting the heavy hand on him.  To see that business thrive, I want to see him being given some sort of a break.  His impression, as a business owner, is that Revenue will come down heavy on him and shut him down, rather than cut him more slack.  How as politicians do we legislate to cut that business a bit of slack in current times?
10601	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	 Is it impertinent of me to ask that copies of the correspondence, without referring to the individuals in question, could be furnished to the joint committee?  That would assist us in seeking to effect changes to the legislation, if necessary. We must grapple with this issue because it affects sub-contractors who are operating on a more informal basis.  We raised this issue at the previous meeting.  If we had substantive evidence and bearing in mind that we can conceal people's identity, that would assist in highlighting this issue.
10602	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 Is this happening 100% of the time on all contracts, or is it an intermittent practice?
10603	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	56	 In essence, they have the owners of small businesses effectively over a barrel and there is no legislative provision that protects the small guy because of the contracting out process.
10604	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	58	 I have a particular interest in the food industry and one of the issues that is coming up in terms of the regulatory regime is the Hassop regulation.  Have food businesses contacted ISME about the overly stringent Hassop regulations, given the way the system works in France, where an artisan producer can continue to produce, and there is no hassle.
10605	SeanSherlock	Labour	13656.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	60	 Is it Mr. Fielding's sense that it speaks to the culture of the country that when legislation  is devised in Brussels, we seem to go hell for leather to try to implement it.

10615	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	57	 I welcome the delegation.  It is the first time we have talked to individual businesses and seen first hand the effect on them.  I welcome that because it is the only way we, as politicians, can fully understand how this is having an effect on people.  If the SFA is actively participating in the high level group on business regulation, the question which arises is why no progress is being made on the issues which are before us today.  Does there need to be more of a political imperative to push the process on to try to get results sooner than we are seeing?  I am beginning to question that process because if the SFA is before us today one could surmise that we are not seeing the progress we should be seeing on that issue. I am fascinated by Mr. Cummins's submission.  If the cost of a permit is €500 and it costs €40,000 for a consultant to put in a submission, which is based on 30 pieces of legislation and any number of statutory instruments, I do not understand why, if there is a process through the high level group, the issue has not been tackled before now.  It is something which this committee has to take up with the Minister after this meeting, in order that an action arises from it and the delegation is not just coming in here, pleading its case and walking off, with nothing else being done.  Perhaps the officials who are involved with that high level group should be brought before the committee in order that we can see what progress is being made on those issues, if that is possible. I wanted to get a sense of where the high level group is currently at, from the delegation's perspective.  I would like an honest appraisal on where it sees that going and whether it is yielding results.
10616	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	59	 The SFA stated in its submission that it is examining the employment laws to which Ms McNally referred, corporate governance and health and safety.  The Health and Safety Authority came before the committee.  There are issues, in terms of the cost of running it and the expenses it has incurred which are, to my mind, questionable.  I wish to refer to the issue of waste and waste management, and regulation from that point of view.  Has the higher level group discussed the issues which we are discussing today?  Is it still stuck on other pillars?
10617	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	61	 Fair enough.  I wish to return to the issue of waste management.  If there is a standard model and one is operating in Cork, Waterford, Limerick or wherever, one applies for one licence which is then eligible across the 26 counties.  It seems to speak to common sense.  However, I have a sense that the local authorities are gradually, of their own accord, moving out of waste management and are transferring it to private operators.  It may be a philosophical issue.  What needs to be done now for a business which is in the waste management sector?  What is the ideal thing which needs to happen?  Do we get rid of the statutory instruments?  Do we amend the legislation?  We could introduce a new statutory instrument which gives the Minister the power to override the local authority and state, by ministerial decree, that there is one licence for the whole country, which may be the ideal scenario.
10618	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	65	 We are getting down to brass tacks.  This is the nub of the issue.  I am on my first mandate.  It predates my membership of this House.  If I understand Mr. Cummins's point correctly, it is that when regulations, legislation and statutory instruments are being drafted, there is no consultation with affected stakeholders.  We are not talking about reinventing the wheel but about matters referred to in other reports.  The net effect is that we need to allow for a legislative process that——
10619	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 The Chairman may disagree with me that there is a disparity in that case.  When the State itself decides not to comply with legislation from the Union, as it often does, it often blames Brussels, yet we are very compliant when applying legislation to businesses.

10621	SeanSherlock	Labour	13664.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	78	 I do not have any further questions.

10629	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 I welcome Mr. Raleigh and his colleagues and congratulate them on the report and its presentation.  It is succinct and its language is clear and unambiguous.  Very often in our game we have to wade through vast amounts of documentation so it is good to see a report that is clear in what it seeks to do without any ambiguity. I believe the last paragraph of the submission probably sums up the culture that exists in this country.  Do I understand there are plenty of codes — a vast quantum of code — which one can follow and buy into but are not necessarily backed up by a legislative framework in regard to corporate governance in this country? In the first paragraph on page 3 of the report Mr. Raleigh states: We believe this situation gives rise to the lack of a clear unified framework for companies to follow, potentially overlapping lines of responsibility among regulators and the perception of potential conflicts of interest.  The Stock Exchange, for example, is currently being asked to market the exchange, retaining existing companies and attracting new companies to its list, while also being required to monitor and ensure compliance with the combined code. Therefore the combined code exists.  It seems to me that the culture of compliance as it pertains to the vast bulk of companies seems to be quite strong but there still is a lag.  Do we need a more august body of legislation to ensure 100% compliance, bringing about a sea change in the culture and a change in the perception abroad of Irish companies?
10630	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	 That is very clear.  In regard to the public interest entities —  the first time I have heard them referred to in that way is in the blurb — we might look at page 23 of the report on audit committees, in particular, on Anglo Irish Bank.  I do not know if the delegates have looked at Anglo.  I believe there is a reference to it as being covered.  It was nationalised at the time so I am not 100% clear whether it came under the ambit of the report.  We had a member of the audit committee of Anglo before this committee at one stage——
10631	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	 Internal audit.  I just want to get a sense of the distinctions between competences.  If recommendations for passing particular loans are made, for example, and the internal audit committee declares the loan represents a risk to the overall entity should there be clear rules about legislating for that or is some degree of flexibility needed?  The loan might be passed up the line with the board subsequently agreeing to its being slipped through because it needs to go through. What struck me when we were examining the culture within Anglo was that there was a fluidity across all competences, from chief executive down.  Although it is only one company there may be a perception that this culture pervades many other companies, especially in the banking sector.  Should there be clear, legislated-for rules or some code for cases where there is an inherent risk, where an internal audit committee says there is a risk to the overall entity if a particular loan is passed or a certain decision is made, even when officials feel they are acting in good faith?
10632	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	" I refer to page 4 of the delegation's submission which states, ""The often-stated assertion that there is not enough appropriately qualified directors in the Irish market should be challenged, not least because the increasing exposure of Irish companies to international markets means that Irish companies should seriously consider the level of international representation on their boards"".  What does the delegation mean by that?"
10633	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	16	 It is pertinent to make that statement in this hallowed institution.  The culture in this country is very much about connectivity, inter-relationships, who one is and who one represents and I am unsure how one could legislate for that.  I imagine it is rather difficult to put in place a rules-based structure because it is very subjective.
10634	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 Would Grant Thornton have done that for Kingspan, for instance?
10635	SeanSherlock	Labour	13671.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	 To what extent will European Union rules have a bearing on changes to corporate governance structures?  Does the de Larosière report have a bearing on the changes we are discussing here or is that a separate process?

10643	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 I welcome our guests.  This is the first occasion on which the issue of regulation has been presented to the committee on a pounds, shillings and pence basis.  We have received a micro view of how regulation has affected the sector.  I was particularly intrigued by Mr. Foy's story in respect of potatoes.  From a layman's point of view, I wish to discover more about the regime which allows someone to enter a shop and rip open a bag of potatoes and examine the contents. What power is bestowed on inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which allows them to do this in the first instance?  Surely it must be possible for these people to take a step back from their own regulatory regime and visit wholesalers in order to inspect goods.  I imagine they are doing this in an event in respect of eggs, tobacco and the other items to which our guests refer.  If they visit the premises of wholesalers or primary producers, why then are they also visiting independent grocers in order to inspect the same products?  Do our guests have a view on that matter?
10644	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	 Mr. Foy has been based in Cootehill for ten years.  The Department's inspectors have been checking the potatoes on sale at his premises for that entire period and I presume a situation has at some point arisen where they stated that those potatoes were substandard or that certain actions needed to be taken.  I do not wish to sound flippant, I merely wish to discover whether such a bizarre scenario exists in the first instance.
10645	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	 I accept that.
10646	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 The HACCP legislation, even though it applies on a Europe-wide basis, arguably would not allow for the situation to which Mr. Foy referred in respect of Starbucks.  We implement and accommodate European legislation and HACCP regulations relating to food in as robust a fashion as possible.  I do not know if any of our guests' stores are affected by the HACCP legislation.  If it does affect them, will they indicate whether that affect is adverse in nature?  It is well documented that if one visits a country market or artisan store in France, it is obvious that those stallholders and store owners do not adhere to the legislation in the way retailers here are obliged to do.  What is our guests' view on that matter?
10647	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 We need to return to first principles, exercise a degree of common sense and deconstruct the culture whereby everything needs to be examined and jobs need to be created for the sake of doing so.
10648	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 A high-level group is examining the position with regard to regulation at present.  Is RGDATA providing that group with information?
10649	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 Okay.  ISME and the SFA have come before the committee and a common theme runs through our deliberations, namely, that there is far too much regulation and that it must be reduced.  I would argue that the high-level group to which I refer is understaffed and that its work is not moving at an acceptable pace.  This committee should take a view to the effect that RGDATA should play a more formal role in respect of the high-level group.  I hope other members agree with me in that regard. What are our guests advocating in respect of requests for statistics from the CSO?  Everyone agrees that the CSO is necessary, particularly as there is a need for statistics.  However, perhaps there is a need to consider what it is doing in seeking statistics from the grocery sector at the level to which our guests refer.
10650	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 We could take a representative sample.
10651	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	26	 It seems to be more of a quantitative exercise than a qualitative exercise.
10652	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	29	" What is coming across is that we need to apply some common sense.  The witnesses are arguing for something quite logical. My last question does not relate to what the witnesses presented.  The regional planning guidelines are under review.  I have a strong view on what I call the ""Tescofication"" of the grocery sector.  Pressure is coming from the larger multiples for a change to regional planning guidelines.  Does RGDATA have a formal view on this?"
10653	SeanSherlock	Labour	13677.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Prelude	31	 I would like to take Mr. Nolan up on the offer.

10665	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	57	 The credit union movement is a little perturbed by the fact that the legislation will be implemented in advance of a strategic review and to its mind the consultation process will be a waste of time after the fact.  Credit unions hope for proper consultation in advance of the legislation being passed or perhaps a parking of the legislation until such time as they can get down to the nitty gritty of the details of how it will impact on them in the long term.  A strategic review after the legislation is passed seems to the credit unions to be quite a waste of time and their perception is that the Registrar of Credit Unions is driving a coach and four through any initiatives or views they have on how the new sections 35A and 35B will affect them.  They also have a perception that they have already made adequate provisioning arrangements.  They believe there is a relatively decent reserve in position and they are well placed to withstand any economic downturn or anything that may change within the 12 to 18 month period.  What is Mr. O'Brien's view on this?  If he were to communicate a message to the credit unions through this forum what would he state on this?
10666	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	59	" Does Mr. O'Brien have regard for the fact that because of the new provisioning arrangements and the reserve requirements many credit unions will find it more difficult to pay dividends and surpluses?  This could in the long term undermine the credit union movement.  If one does not get a return why should one invest in an individual credit union?  Credit unions take a view that they have voluntarily introduced new parameters on provisioning requirements.  Some will argue that there have been increases of anything up to 40% in the reserves of individual credit unions to meet any onslaught or potential problems that might arise. At present, credit unions have a sense that Mr. O'Brien is not in a position to bargain, negotiate or even consult.  Their perception is that Mr. O'Brien will drive on and adopt a ""one size fits all"" approach.  He may extrapolate from the results he elucidated to Deputy O'Donnell on reserves and the increasing pressure that exists for 100 loan books."
10667	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	61	 Are they representative of the overall credit union sector?  Do we need to look more closely at those 100 loan books?  What was the product mix and what was the mix of credit unions examined?  If Mr. O'Brien takes a unilateral approach he will potentially impact on the ability of credit unions to draw in new customers if the reserve and provisioning requirements are so stringent that they will not be able to pay out dividends even though their loan books might be performing quite well. What I am trying to get across is the idea that there may be a sense in which the Minister has bought into a view on sections 35A and 35B.  In his Second Stage speech, he stated: The Registrar of Credit Unions will adopt a balanced and proportionate approach in the application of the loan provisioning requirements which are proposed to be introduced.  Depending on the circumstances, a missed repayment on a rescheduled loan may not always trigger a full provision against the loan provided that the credit union is satisfied that the loan continues to perform in accordance with its new terms. It could be argued that it is giving them a carte blanche, but that the ability of the individual credit union to know its customer and have a personal relationship with him or her is being overridden by the new provisions which it will impose.  That is something which needs to be teased out because in the future one does not want tension to exist between the registrar and individual credit unions, thereby having a negative impact on their ability to pay dividends.
10668	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	63	 What were the representative bodies?
10669	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	69	 What was its position regarding section 35(a) when it was sitting in the room with the delegation?
10670	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	71	 A position was articulated to us in the committee and I am sure the delegates have read the transcripts.  The Minister has a very clear position on section 35(a), as does Mr. O’Brien.  Where is the breakdown, if this was a consultative process?
10671	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	73	 I appreciate that.  I have one final question regarding the appropriate processes, procedures and systems that will have to be put in place to meet the requirements of section 35(b).  What does the delegation envisage in that provision?  It could arguably place a massive cost burden on individual credit unions as a result of updating information technology systems and other such processes.  I want to get a sense of the current position of the delegation.
10672	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	87	 It is how one determines the power.  Is it a soft power or a hard power?  Will Mr. O'Brien beat them with a stick or coax them along gently in a consultative fashion?
10673	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	96	 If I was a member of a credit union representative body, I would be distrustful of the process outlined by the delegates.  The legislation is being amended to provide certain powers.  Mr. O'Brien may say he intends to consult widely on individual scenarios, but that is an easy commitment to give.  A credit union representative would ask why the legislation was being changed before the strategic review was completed.  Surely it would be preferable to park the legislation until the review and consultations have been carried out.  It could be wrapped up by the autumn or winter and there would be a clearly defined set of goals for each of the legislative, regulatory and representative sides.  What is Mr. O'Brien's view of this proposal?
10674	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	98	 Does that not make a mockery of a subsequent strategic review?
10675	SeanSherlock	Labour	13686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	100	 We are looking at the legislation, yet Mr. O'Brien is calling for another review later.  Why not include this aspect in the strategic review?

10693	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I wish to address the staffing quotient assigned to the high level group from the various Departments and ask if enough staff have been assigned to the task at hand.  If the target is a reduction of 25% by 2012, it would appear there are not enough staff to deal with it adequately to move the agenda forward.  I am concerned that it is not moving as quickly as it might.  Given that this process started in 1999 and has been through two transitions and that we are in an economic downturn, there is a serious urgency about this because of the cost implications for business.  There may not have been the same urgency about this two or three years ago.  It is necessary to ensure an adequate staffing quotient.
10694	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	 Information gathering places a major cost burden on businesses. Obviously the CSO has certain obligations by dint of EU legislation and that, I presume, is what is meant by an intractable issue, as mentioned.  I am sure that the business groups, the SFA and ISME have referred to this specifically in this committee.  If that is an intractable issue and there a pre-existing regulatory burden, the question arises as to whether the CSO is an active partner on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis with the high level group to ensure that burden is reduced.  Is there a practical relationship there?
10695	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	 On what quantitative or qualitative analysis is it based or what is the underlying assumption?
10696	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	11	 That is fair enough.  The employers representatives might have a view on that which I am sure we will get to as we progress.  In trying to achieve a 25% reduction, is it possible to quantify at this stage the percentage achieved on the work programme?  Has 50%, 70% or 80% of the work programme been achieved?  Will the CSO hit its targets in terms of reducing the burden?  Could the timescale potentially move out again?  I would like to get a sense of where it is at and whether the targets are being achieved.  I have the work programme here. I have a specific question on the Health and Safety Authority.  From a HSA perspective, how is the regulatory burden being reduced in terms of the wealth of health and safety legislation impacting on business?  What actions are being taken to reduce that burden on businesses?  I can speak with more authority from a local authority perspective whereby the simple issue of filling a pothole now requires a myriad of man hours.  I assume the same is applicable in a business sense in that if one wants to carry out works to one's premises or whatever there is a regulatory burden on businesses.  Are the representatives teasing out those issues also with the HSE?
10697	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 Does Mr. Gorman have a timeline for the completion of that process?
10698	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	48	 Mr. Gorman will have to forgive me if my understanding of the information obligations provided to us is incorrect.  On health and safety, let us take IO/20, risk assessments, and IO/13, safety statements.  The administrative costs associated with these were €167 million for the former and €146 million for the latter.  As a percentage of the overall burden, these amounted to 51% and 44%, respectively.  How, in practical terms, is it proposed to reduce the burden of these two areas by 25% by the end of 2012?  I am sceptical about the possibility that the Health and Safety Authority will be hauled over the coals and legislation amended by the end of 2012. I do not get a sense of urgency, which is the reason I questioned the staffing quotient applied to this mechanism in the first instance.  Mr. Gorman alluded to a parliamentary question I tabled recently.  The secretariat for the high level group is provided by the company law review group and business regulation section, which currently have a staff of eight.  The high level group cannot achieve what it hopes to deliver with this staffing quotient, notwithstanding the fact that other Departments feed into the process. I will now address Mr. MacFeely, the representative of the Central Statistics Office.  Business interests are making a case that one could take representative samples as opposed to complete figures to reduce the regulatory burden.  The Legislature requires a greater sense of urgency in this regard given the current economic circumstances.  We need a substantive means of identifying, at a minimum on a quarterly basis, whether the targets are being met.  In the work programme some of the targets are characterised by the colours red, orange and green.  I will choose a random example.  The description given on the Companies Registration Office and Revenue annual returns is that the CRO and Revenue are working together to find ways to reduce duplication.  It refers to milestones completion co-ordination meetings between the CRO and Revenue and then it is given a green light, and then that an information note has been produced by the CRO to help companies which wish to change their ARDs and can be found in paragraph 7.  How does a company alter its ARD? Presumably, that is real and that has happened.  However, there is so much more within those work programme documents which are totally aspirational.  I am the type of person who likes to see a target date and an action and whether or not it has been achieved, and much of it has not been achieved.
10699	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	 The bottom line is that it is not an apportioning of blame either; it is an apportioning of resources.
10700	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 How often does Mr. Gorman chat to the Minister?
10701	SeanSherlock	Labour	13692.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	 We are discussing reducing a cost burden, particularly in the context of the fact that risk assessments cost €167 million and safety statements cost almost €146 million.  No one is opposed to the idea of reducing the legislative burden or the need to ensure that workplaces are safe.  No one in his or her right mind would seek to compromise on that.  However, an entire industry has grown up around health and safety and the implementation of legislation relating thereto.  The regulatory regime relating to the HSA and similar bodies has mushroomed in recent years.  Representatives from the HSA came before the committee and I invite our guests to consider the figures they provided in respect of accommodation costs alone. We are trying to examine matters such as those to which I refer.  I do not believe what we are doing in this regard is wrong.  Nor is it wrong for us to try to change or streamline the position in any way.  No member is trying to reduce the need for proper assessment but a common-sense approach should be taken.

10711	SeanSherlock	Labour	13712.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	3	" I welcome Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and her colleagues to the committee.  I thank her on behalf of my party for her comprehensive presentation.  I have one critique of it which I might respectfully put to her. The composition of the working group, which was set out in the acknowledgements, seems to exclude the credit union movement.  The credit union representative bodies seem to have been omitted.  They represent more than 400 credit unions and provide personal credit to almost 3 million members.  We all subscribe to the efficacy of reports from the Law Reform Commission.  On reading the report, it is my view that one cannot have such a report without their input.  I acknowledge the work done by the Law Reform Commission on behalf of the State but no report on personal debt management and debt enforcement could stand up to scrutiny without the inclusion of the representatives of the credit union movement.  That is a layman's view. Those who participated in the report seem to be more weighted in favour of the banking federation which would not be friendly towards the credit union movement.  Perhaps the latter group could be brought on board as part of the consultative process. Point 1.07 on page 11 indicated that the consultation paper also noted that no arrears management code exists in respect of non-mortgage debts and so suggested that consideration should be given to introducing such a code.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness indicated: ""The final topic considered in the area of responsible arrears management was the provisional recommendation of the commission that a system for the regulation of the debt collection industry should be established.  I note the word ""provisional"".  I do not understand why that would be a provisional arrangement.  Is the Law Reform Commission not aware that there are private, unregulated firms charging astronomical commission to persons in severe debt for managing their accounts?  I recently came across a case where a couple were being charged approximately €100 per month, €1,200 per annum, by one such company.  I do not believe one can consider personal indebtedness without examining those companies as well.  In the new regulatory regime there is a sense that many of those types of companies are going to slip under the radar and that the credit unions and banks will receive much of the focus, perhaps rightly so, but that the other companies would slip away.  I would like to hear the delegation's views in this regard."
10712	SeanSherlock	Labour	13712.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	7	 The commission's report on personal debt states: In December 2009, the Financial Regulator published data on mortgage arrears and repossessions based on the quarter to the end of September 2009.  These statistics provide an insight into the difficulties being experienced by Irish households in meeting mortgage loan repayments.  The statistics illustrated that of a total of 791,634 private residential mortgage loans, 8,504 were in arrears for a period of between 91 and 180 days. Are mortgages with interest-only or reduced repayment arrangements included in these arrears figures?
10713	SeanSherlock	Labour	13712.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	9	" The report also states: ""The number of possession claims brought in the High Court rose by 22% in 2009, with 974 such claims brought in 2009, compared to 759 in 2008.""  I assume these figures have changed.  Are there projections for repossessions in 2010 and 2011?"

10719	SeanSherlock	Labour	13712.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I thank the witnesses for the excellent report.  I am sure that it will be used in many other circles in relation to this whole issue of indebtedness and so forth.  On behalf of the committee I take this opportunity to thank the witnesses for coming before us and we shall certainly be coming back to them again to discuss these matters further.
