17153	SeanSherlock	Labour	14224.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2011-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together. The key recommendations in the report, including bonus points for higher level mathematics, professional development for teachers and the roll-out of Project Maths, are being progressed.  Bonus points will be implemented from 2012.  Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 project schools which started the programme in 2008.  This is being supported by extensive investment in professional development for teachers which began in 2009 and which will continue until 2013 at least.  As part of this, intensive postgraduate courses will be developed aimed at teachers who do not hold a major qualification in mathematics.  A Project Maths implementation support group, an industry and education partnership, reported in 2010 on how stakeholders from business, second level and higher education can work together to achieve the objectives of Project Maths.  The recommendations of this report are being progressed.  My Department has also published the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is designed to promote a significant improvement in mathematical skills throughout primary and second level schools.
17154	SeanSherlock	Labour	14224.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	420	 One of the main recommendations related to bonus points.  From next year there will be 25 bonus points for mathematics.  There will also be a system of continuing professional development of teachers at primary and secondary level in the teaching of mathematics, including a professional masters degree and a part-time higher education diploma in mathematical education.  Consideration has been given to a four-year honours degree in mathematical education and, in addition, a tender for a postgraduate programme in mathematics will be finalised shortly, aimed at teachers who need extra support. A report was produced by National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSDL, a function of the University of Limerick.  It has carried out a good deal of work in this area and it is to be commended on the report completed under the tutelage of Dr. John O'Donoghue on the out-of-field teaching in post-primary education.  Project Maths is dealing with this in terms of continuing professional development.  The incentive of the 25 bonus points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, is being introduced in 2012 and it should have a positive bearing.  The fact that there will be continuous benchmarking and evaluation against the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results will be a true testament of whether we are getting results. There has been significant buy-in by teachers, parents and schools and the new junior cycle curriculum will feed in to greater outputs because the short courses devised as part of that will give students a greater chance to interact with industry.  For example, areas such as software programming, the pharmaceutical area and a host of other possibilities will engage their brains more laterally with mathematics and problem solving.  We must ensure that there is a good coterie of people who can think critically and laterally and who can solve problems in a more effectual way, the end result being better outcomes.  This is not to criticise the existing structures in place but we must continue to evolve mathematics learning in this country.
17155	SeanSherlock	Labour	14224.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	664	 Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) typically makes research grants awards that are multi-annual in nature, typically spanning a three to five year period. The following table sets out the researcher numbers directly supported by SFI since 2006. Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 No. of Researchers 1,362 1,909 2,812 3,225 2,999 c.3,000 Due to the wide range of variables that impact upon the overall numbers of researchers being directly supported by SFI in-year it is not possible to provide exact projections of the numbers of researchers that will be supported under SFI funding.  The following estimated projections represent the most likely scenarios based on current information available. Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Estimated number of SFI supported Researchers 3,000 2,900 2,750 2,750 2,750 It is to be expected that some of the researcher number reductions may be offset by other sources, such as EU funding which has been an increasing source of funds for the Irish research system in recent years.

I am informed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) that they provided  €4.9 million to the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) between 1st March 2011 and 31st October 2011 in respect of costs associated with Metro North.  The NTA provided €4.6 million to Iarnrod Éireann in respect of costs associated with DART Underground in the same period. With regard to the question of compensation arising from the deferment of Metro North, the terms of the Metro North PPP Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) provide for RPA to make an ex-gratia payment of up to €1 million to each tenderer remaining in the process (of which there are two) in the event that the project does not proceed. Any claim must be independently verified. This arrangement was approved by the previous Government in 2008.  Funding in respect of any reimbursement will be provided by my Department. I would point out that there will be further costs associated with the orderly deferral of these projects. In the case of Metro North, the main item will be the works at the Mater Hospital which are required to be undertaken in order to preserve, ahead of the completion of the new Adult Hospital, the necessary clearance envelope for the subsequent construction of the underground metro stop whenever it is decided to proceed with this project in the future. I believe it is important to carry out these works so that the Metro can be built at some point in the future without the requirement to close the Adult Hospital. I expect to have full details of all outstanding costs for these two projects by year-end.

17161	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 On 30 June, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced the establishment of a cross-Government implementation group on cloud computing.  This group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, comprises representatives of Departments and agencies responsible for all aspects of cloud computing policy, IT procurement, security, infrastructure and enterprise policy.  The group last met on 28 September.  In addition, the group's work was complemented by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in 23 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies being facilitated by my Department. In conducting its work, the group examined the opportunities and challenges presented by cloud computing for business and government from the following perspectives: the cloud as a source for exports, growth and jobs;  the adequacy of key infrastructures; the regulatory environment; the opportunities and benefits for indigenous enterprises; the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment; and Government as a leader and user of the cloud. The Secretary General of the Department, upon his recent retirement, submitted a draft interim report to the Minister.  This report is currently being reviewed by the group and it is intended that the group will meet shortly for the purpose of agreeing the content of the report and an action plan to implement its recommendations.  The group's final report is expected before the end of this year. Ireland is extremely well placed to take advantage of the rapidly growing international potential of cloud computing.  A recent report commissioned by Microsoft has estimated that, by 2014, the cloud computing industry in Ireland could be worth €9.5 billion and employ between 8,500 and 9,000 people.  Now, more than ever, we must do everything we can to seize opportunities like this.  These jobs will be created automatically, and the Government must act decisively and urgently if we are to position Ireland as a world leader in this high-growth sector.  The commitment in the programme for Government on cloud computing sets out the Government's intentions in this important area of the ICT industry.
17162	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	44	 Our job is to engage with the centre for management and organisation development, CMOD.  The Government acknowledges the possibilities of this.  One could say work is ongoing on making the ICT infrastructure more user friendly.  There will be challenges, potentially in regard to industrial relations peace, but I believe strongly that through proper engagement with all the stakeholders across government and by taking a more horizontal approach as opposed to the more siloed approach we are used to, we can achieve something and become global leaders in adopting early new technologies such as that associated with cloud computing.
17163	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	46	 I did not quite get the last point.
17164	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	48	 I am not aware of such problems.  I say that openly and honestly.  Research is ongoing and the centre is in the process of developing a cloud computing strategy for the public service, which it intends to bring to the Government for consideration and approval in the first quarter of 2012.  If a specific issue arises, I would love to hear the Deputy's thoughts.
17165	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	51	 I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy.  If he is willing to show me the source of the statistics he cited, I will revert to him on the matter.
17166	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 EMC, the Irish Internet Association, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Dell and A&L Goodbody are all engaged in this process.  It is a worthwhile process because if we can become global leaders by dint of being early adopters we will have a competitive advantage.  I recognise that problems arise in broadband provision but the capacity is present in terms of cloud.  If the Deputy engages further with the Department, we can send him some facts on the issue.
17167	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	 On job creation, this Department must deal with the reality of the capital funding available to it.  On 10 November the Government published its infrastructural and capital investment medium-term Exchequer framework for the period 2012 to 2016.  Overall, capital investment totalling €17 billion has been allocated across Departments.  In one way or another, all of this €17 billion ultimately has a focus on job creation.  The Government's role is to create the conditions within which it will maximise the impact of this capital allocation and support the private sector in the creation of jobs.  Within the medium-term framework the State's support to enterprise and innovation has been protected and prioritised and clear targets for job creation have been set.  When averaged over the lifetime of the framework, the job creation targets for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are set to approximately 22,659 per annum. The capital allocation for programmes funded by the Department is to be increased in 2012 to €514 million, an increase of €6 million on the 2011 allocation, and supports to industry will be maintained in excess of pre-recession levels when total capital expenditure was at its highest.  This represents a strong commitment in this Department to the development of enterprise and provides the development agencies with sufficient resources to target aggressively the projects and investments that will drive economic renewal.  In setting out this level of capital investment in the productive economy the Government has been cognisant of issues, including maximising the achievement of value for money and the sustainability of job creation measures. While the notion of spending an additional €3.1 billion per annum on job creation might sound attractive, what the economy needs is structural change.  The Government must ensure the enterprise development supports and agencies are fit for purpose and well positioned to help Ireland to move out of the current downturn by creating sustainable jobs and continuing to grow exports in traditional key markets, as well as targeting high growth markets such as the BRIC countries for both exports and inward investment.  The Government has made inroads in bringing about these changes, as well as restoring confidence across enterprise, investors and consumers.  For example, work is advanced within the Department on determining the extent of the restructuring of the county enterprise boards; IDA Ireland has restructured in order that more of its staff are in client-facing jobs, while Enterprise Ireland has made operational a new potential exporters division which will target companies with export potential.  These are just a few examples of the changes being brought about.
17168	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	 I take the Deputy's point which is made in good faith.  However, in respect of the Government's capital allocation, there has been a 4% increase in Enterprise Ireland's capital budget for 2012.  I will rush through the figures because I am conscious of the time constraints, but there has been a 10% increase in the number of high potential start-up companies, a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships and expenditure of €18 million on the innovation fund.  The key point is that the Government is trying to set down the foundations or the bedrock on which one can sustain jobs over a longer period.  If one considers Sinn Féin's proposals for capital expenditure, they entail borrowing something like €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  It is talking out of both sides of its mouth in this regard — there is a bit of the Tadhg an dá thaobh about it — because, on the one hand, it states it would not pay back moneys to the European institutions from which Ireland has borrowed money while, on the other, it would have no problem in borrowing approximately €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  This does not stack up.
17169	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	92	 The Government is trying to create long-term sustainable jobs, but the Deputy is talking about short-term projects based on capital expenditure.  This does not stack up.
17170	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	 In fairness to the pensioners who were outside the gates of Leinster House today, if I interpreted the vox pop correctly, the strong message also extended to the amount of money being taken in administration fees.
17171	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 I respectfully ask the Deputy to allow me to answer the question.  The pensioners were as adamant in their opposition to that aspect.  Let us take another look and look at the issue from the perspective of the communication passed between Departments.  However, with all due respect, as the question tabled by the Deputy pertains to capital expenditure of €3.1 billion, he will forgive me if I do not have an exact answer for him on the issue of the pension fund mentioned.
17172	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	622	 The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of over €50 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved. Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme. The latest available data in relation to participation by enterprise in FP7, from 2007 to April, 2011, illustrates the number of participations (applications), number of successful applications, number of specific companies and funding to those companies. In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to April this year, 171 companies based in Ireland have had projects approved for funding under the programme. A number of companies are involved in more than one project and the total number of projects approved involving Irish companies in that period is 262. The total amount of funding to Irish based companies in these projects is €74.8 million. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for €55.5 million i.e. 74% of funding to Private Industry with 206 out of the 262 participations in projects. 22 Multinational companies (MNCs) based in Ireland have been approved funding and are involved in 56 approved projects. Ireland's overall success rate in FP7 of 23% (percentage of successful Irish applications including industry and academic) remains above the European Member State average of 22.21%.  The funding secured by Irish applicants at 21% (funding secured as percentage of funding requested) is also above the EU average of 20.68%.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of the prospects for Irish participation in FP7 and are broadly in line with our national targets. With regard to the number of projects pending and prospects for a major breakthrough, it is not possible to provide details at this stage.  All major FP7 Calls for 2012 opened in July, 2011 and will close sequentially from September, 2011 to March, 2012.  The next information available from the European Commission with regard to these Calls will be in April, 2012.  There will be one more series of Calls in respect of 2013, before the end of FP7, which is due to conclude at the end of 2013. The Commission gives special consideration to the funding of SMEs within FP7, setting a target of at least 15% of the available funding.  Ireland's SME participation remains in line with this target. Indeed, Ireland has the highest SME participation degree of the EU 27 Member States, with 104 per 100,000 SMEs participating in FP7 Themes. EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013. It includes the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme which aims to improve the conditions for innovation, such as exchanges of best practices between Member States and actions to improve, encourage and promote innovation in enterprises. It also includes the ICT Policy Support Programme which aims to stimulate the new converging markets for electronic networks and services, media content and digital technologies. The CIP is administered through the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry.

17185	SeanSherlock	Labour	14231.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	342	 Like many in the international community, the Government has been closely following events in Egypt in recent days in the run-up to historic parliamentary elections which are due to get under way on 28 November.  We all recall the events last February in Tahrir Square which proved so inspiring, when the discredited government of former President Hosni Mubarak was swept away in an impressive demonstration of people power.  In the intervening nine months, Ireland and its EU partners have been monitoring closely the transition to democratic rule in Egypt.  We have been offering all possible political support and responded positively to requests for practical assistance.  It is recognised that, as in other countries undergoing democratic transformation in the region, the uprising in Egypt that ended President Mubarak's rule was a genuinely popular one, drawing support from all sectors of society, and that it is for Egypt itself to determine the pace of its own transition and how the international community can best assist. It needs to be recognised that profound and historic changes have taken place in Egypt during the past nine months.  The country is on the verge of holding its first genuinely free elections in many years.  Political parties have been openly campaigning, many of which, including those linked with the Muslim Brotherhood, would only have encountered repression previously.  The former President and his close associates have been publicly put on trial for their crimes, an event to behold for ordinary Egyptians when they consider how impregnable the rule of President Mubarak appeared just one short year ago. Despite this, concern has been growing in recent months at the overall slow pace of the transition in Egypt and the degree of real change and reform taking place.  Despite repeated requests from the European Union and others, the ruling Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has refused to lift the long-standing state of emergency.  As a hard hitting Amnesty International report has highlighted in recent days, we have continued to see large-scale trials of civilians in military courts, as well as many credible reports of arbitrary detention and torture. Also of considerable concern has been the growth in sectarian tension.  This had its most recent manifestation last month, when more than 20 people, mostly Coptic Christians, were killed after coming under attack from elements linked with Egyptian security forces.  The military authorities have undertaken to investigate these deaths fully and also promised legislation to address well founded Coptic grievances.  As with other aspects of the change agenda in Egypt, the pace of reform has been slow and hesitant. Most recently, the prospect of military rule continuing until well into 2013 has caused renewed apprehension among many ordinary Egyptians, as well as Egypt's international partners.  That this and other failures to realise the full promise of change have given way to renewed violence and deaths is regrettable.  The Government joins others in the international community such as High Representative Ashton and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in expressing our deep concern about and condemnation of the violence in Tahrir Square and other parts of Egypt that is now estimated to have claimed at least 33 lives. The need for restraint, an avoidance of all violence and renewed dialogue on all sides is obvious.  There is no doubt that excessive force has been used by the Egyptian police and security forces in responding to what are peaceful demonstrations in Tahrir Square and other Egyptian cities.  The clear impetus behind all the renewed violence and tensions of recent days is the failure to respect fully the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people.  High Representative Ashton has warned that the demands of ordinary Egyptians and their political parties for a progressively unfolding transition that will safeguard the principles of democracy must be listened to. The head of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces in Egypt, Field Marshal Tantawi, has undertaken to advance the date for the presidential election to next July.  He has also held out the prospect of a referendum on the military continuing to play a political role in Egypt.  A new government is also likely to be formed.  This is a step forward, but considerably more remains to be done if the democratic promise of last February's Tahrir Square revolution is to be fulfilled and if a genuine process of democratic change akin to what is being observed in Tunisia and Libya is to get under way.  The Government will continue to work with our EU and international partners to assist Egypt along the path towards democratic transformation.
17186	SeanSherlock	Labour	14231.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	345	 The question for Ireland, the European Union and the wider international community is how best we can support the Egyptian people along the path towards full and a genuine democracy.  The first step in that process is the holding of parliamentary elections which are scheduled to take place next Monday.  The Government has committed €250,000 to the United Nations' development programme to support the electoral process in Egypt in the coming months and help to create a genuine and deep democracy that is respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms. High Representative Ashton was the first major international figure to visit Egypt.  She went to listen to the Egyptian people about how the European Union could support Egypt's transition to democracy.  The Union has promised greater political association, economic integration, mobility and financial support for Egypt and other countries experiencing democratic transition in return for real reforms.  It has made available €350 million until the end of next year to support the process of democratisation and the achievement of economic growth throughout the region. It is for Egyptians to determine their future.  In partnership with the European Union, Ireland can continue to accompany the Egyptian people in their praiseworthy efforts to build what we all want to see, a democratic Egypt, in order that its people can fulfil the basic aspiration of a better life and have the opportunity to fulfil their potential.

17193	SeanSherlock	Labour	14232.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	 While the areas around which public R&D budgets have been oriented to date (ICT, biotechnology, aspects of energy policy) were appropriate for building a broad base of national expertise in fundamental, underpinning science and technology we now need to leverage the strengths that have emerged from the investment that has taken place.  We need to target investment so that we have critical mass in areas that link more precisely to sustaining or growing jobs. The recommendations of the independently constituted Research Prioritisation Steering Group, chaired by Jim O'Hara, former General Manager, Intel Ireland, will be key in implementing efficiency and effectiveness in our system of public investment in R&D, and this will be complemented by other initiatives, notably the forthcoming legislation to extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to enable it to fund applied research. The report of the Research Prioritisation Group has been completed and submitted to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself and will shortly be brought to Government for consideration.  Future focus of investment on the priority areas identified will require greater cohesion of funding across Departments and agencies.  Achieving this cohesion is likely to be more impactful than a single funding stream per se.
17194	SeanSherlock	Labour	14232.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together. The Public Service Reform Plan published last Thursday 17th November sets out the State agencies that will be rationalised.  These include the merger of the Railway Procurement Agency with the National Roads Authority and the merger of the Irish Aviation Authority with the Commission for Aviation Regulation by June 2012.  There will also be a critical review by the same date of the establishment of a single transport safety body comprising of the Road Safety Authority, Railway Safety Commission and the Maritime Safety Authority.  The potential savings arising from these mergers will be identified as detailed implementation plans are developed.
17195	SeanSherlock	Labour	14237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	 The public consultation process referred to attracted more than 50 submissions from interested parties on this subject.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration. I consider that there is further work to be done on the issue between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General and I want to give this matter the fullest consideration.  It is an issue on which there is interaction between rights holders, the internet service providers (ISPS) and the end users, of whom there are millions.  We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct in this area.
17196	SeanSherlock	Labour	14237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	 The information requested by the Deputy in respect of my Department is being compiled and will be forwarded as soon as possible.

17197	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	416	 I thank Deputy Troy for raising this matter.  I have some sympathy for his position as I understand the frustration of any Deputy who represents areas outside of the large urban conurbations when it comes to attracting inward investment to their business parks.  I too have had words with the agency when it comes to its policy of attracting inward investment to places other than the larger urban conurbations. IDA Ireland's property portfolio comprises approximately 1,240 ha.  Under section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 the agency has responsibility for managing its property programme which consists of the acquisition and disposal of land, the development and servicing of land and the provision of building solutions.  The programme has been designed specifically to support the promotion of Ireland and its regions as a suitable location for foreign direct investment, FDI, by providing tailored property solutions. The midlands region is a priority for IDA Ireland and it is continuing to market the region, including Mullingar, to its existing clients and to potential new investors.  In line with the national spatial strategy and IDA Ireland's strategy, Horizon 2020, IDA Ireland is focused on advancing regional economic development, primarily through gateway locations and in the midlands this includes Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone. IDA Ireland has invested heavily in the business and technology park in Mullingar to make it more attractive to overseas clients.  The agency has confirmed that it will continue to promote this park and other local private property options to secure new investments for Mullingar and its surrounding areas.  As Ireland competes for high-end investments, the concept of scale is crucial to success.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talented people, effective physical and digital infrastructure, coupled with the availability of sophisticated support services, an attractive quality of life and proximity to third level institutions. IDA Ireland is actively marketing the midlands gateway through its network of overseas offices and is in regular engagement with all local economic stakeholders including local authorities, midlands gateway chamber, county development boards, academia and Enterprise Ireland to develop constantly the value proposition for the midlands and to provide the most attractive conditions for growth. With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute from within the midlands gateway.  IDA Ireland considers a project win in one midlands town to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. As well as marketing the region for new greenfield investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to deepen their mandate in Ireland and to continue to reinvest in their sites in the region.  This encourages further business in areas which are compatible with our skills base and which are sustainable within our economy in the longer term. The strategy of developing lands and property in advance of securing new business has been a fundamental and successful tool in the IDA's marketing to overseas clients.  The ready availability of property solutions often eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property and for completing necessary development work.  It also allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating many of the potential difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is an accepted that the role of IDA Ireland in making available appropriate and timely property solutions tailored to the needs of prospective multinational clients has been a key contributor to winning FDI to Ireland. I have been informed some clients tend to opt for site locations in larger urban areas.  I agree with the Deputy that there must be a meaningful dialogue with IDA Ireland around the designation of hubs in attracting inward investment to sites such as the one in question.  There may also be a need to examine more closely how these sites can be better utilised.
17198	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I have sympathy for the Deputy regarding the issues raised.  If one considers this from the vantage point of companies that may invest inward, they do not necessarily look at county boundaries or constituencies and, therefore, if they are considering the midlands gateway, they will look at the towns, in particular, not the county boundaries.
17199	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	420	 I take what the Deputy said in good faith.  Given that Mullingar has a strong stakeholder forum, I respectfully suggest it should take up the cudgel through its local public representatives to forge a closer link or dynamic with IDA Ireland in respect of the issues he has outlined. With regard to a site visit, I can bring this to the attention of the Minister.  I have visited AIT and NUIM.  They are two fine institutions conducting world class research and there is continued investment by the Government in science, technology and innovation to ensure this world class research can be maintained. There is merit in the Deputy's contribution.  There has to be a dialogue around these sites throughout the country and how they are marketed and utilised.  We need a discussion about a more lateral approach and if a set of potential investors locally or a set of stakeholders or entrepreneurs who are from without the IDA Ireland portfolio want to engage, an approach should be made to the authority to discuss the potential of the land use.  I fail to see why that could not happen.  I thank the Deputy for raising these issues.

17204	SeanSherlock	Labour	14244.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1051	 Researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) are employed by their respective higher education institutions. Therefore individual researcher salaries are a matter for the higher education institutions. SFI is currently supporting approximately 3,000 researchers. On average, approximately  60% of any SFI grant award is a contribution to the salary costs of the researcher teams. The remainder of the SFI award goes towards supporting the research effort through overheads provision to the relevant higher education institution and covering the cost of necessary research equipment. Given the volume of individual awards, in excess of 2,200 to date, and the several thousands of researchers directly supported by SFI since its establishment in 2000, it is not possible to specify precisely the amount of capital grants that were a contribution to the salaries of researchers.

There are several multinational micro-electronic companies based in Ireland including Intel, Analog Devices and Xilinx, as well as a small but growing base of indigenous companies. IDA Ireland continues to secure significant wins in FDI investment, a significant portion of which is due to the strong research base that Ireland has built up primarily through Science Foundation Ireland and the Programme for Research in Third-level Institutions over the past decade.  There is a very strong human capital capacity in the micro-electronics sector in Ireland, which reinforces our offering to FDI companies while also simultaneously enhancing our tradition of excellence in this area. The micro-electronics industry in Ireland has become much more high-value over the last decade. There is a high demand globally for skilled electronic engineering graduates including for micro-electronics circuit design work- especially for persons with several years' experience. The Irish approach to promoting interaction between universities and industry in the field of microchip design has been recognised by the prestigious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as the best in the world. The required skill sets are best developed in a semiconductor environment through in-company professional development programmes as well as public and private funded research programmes such as the Micro-electronic Competence Centre in the Tyndall National Institute, Cork and the NUI Maynooth Competence Centre in Micro-electronics. These initiatives are directly supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland — and build on the collaborative strengths of both industry and academia.

17215	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	194	" It is essential that European leaders make and implement clear decisions quickly to prove our shared determination to protect our currency, support member states that are working towards economic recovery, and introduce strong rules to ensure fiscal discipline.  Those are the words of the Taoiseach.  A philosophical debate needs to take place within this House about the nature of our membership of the European Union.  We either have an inter-governmental model or an inter-institutional or community method based model.  The question the Opposition must ask itself if it proposes a strong inter-governmental model, is if it will be based on one country with one vote or a qualified majority vote mechanism. Notwithstanding the current economic morass in which we find ourselves, since 1972 Ireland traditionally has always done much better through a community method.  It is through strong inter-institutional links, a strong European Parliament and smaller member states binding together that we can act as a contrary force to the weight of the larger countries.  If we implement a raw inter-governmental model, the ""Merkozy"" effect will always continue to hold sway.  We must have a qualitative debate about what membership entails, and this must be based not just on short-term political gain by certain parties in the House but in a proper discussion of membership. I do not see how a position can be reconciled where a party believes a referendum must be put on membership but it also argues that the powers of the ECB should be extended to cover more than its remit with regard to inflation.  The premise of the belief is that the referendum would be supported as it would expand the powers of the ECB.  The Sinn Féin Party must grapple with that idea.  Nobody should come to the House to talk about such wide issues as the loss of economic sovereignty without spelling out in detail what that means.  There is a bit of a Tadhg an dá thaobh approach from Sinn Féin on the matter, and its position is fundamentally contradictory."
17216	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	471	 I wish to share time with Deputies Tom Barry and Peter Fitzpatrick.
17217	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	473	 The Government is attempting to create a necessary framework that seeks to reform and evolve the social protection code.  I would like to address my comments to the budgetary measures introduced.  If I stray from the exact contents of the Social Welfare Bill 2011, I do so because I want to comment on it in a wider context. We must consider the Social Welfare Bill 2011 in the wider budgetary context.  There are thousands of workers who are not in receipt of any type of social protection measure.  There is, therefore, a strongly held view that reform of the social protection code is necessary.  I take on board the views espoused by those speakers who preceded me.  We must have due regard to the extraordinary fiscal pressures we are under in terms of the deficit reduction target to which we are aligned. To be fair, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has genuinely sought to address the disability payment issue.  The Government has listened to what has been said by all sides of the House on that matter and has moved to address it.  Some of us are only in government a relatively short time and we openly acknowledge that there are issues in the budget which need to be addressed.  We acknowledge the statements made by Members on the opposite side in relation to that matter. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that the pressures on our social welfare budget are enormous.  The financial allocation for jobseekers' payments increased from €1.4 billion in 2007 to €3.9 billion this year, an increase of 176%.  The provision for State pensions has increased from €3.75 billion in 2007 to €4.7 billion this year.  We will need to increase this financial allocation year-on-year owing to the demographic profile.  An additional allocation of €1.75 million will be required in 2012.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is honouring the Government's commitment not to cut welfare rates, increase income tax on working people, to protect carers and to standardise child benefit payments.  The social protection measures in this Bill signal a move by Government to move our country closer to economic recovery and towards the restoration of our sovereignty.  Some €4.2 million will be provided for training on CE through the national training fund.  In addition, SOLAS will continue to provide access by CE participants to its training programmes.  The Department will spend €977 million on employment supports in 2012, up from €882 million in 2011.  It is in that context that reforms of labour market activation and supports funding and management are being examined, as well as funding received from other sources, including statutory organisations.  We must reform our welfare and training systems so that people who lose their jobs do not drift into long-term unemployment.  This is committed to in the budget.  The need to shift from a passive welfare system to a far more active approach is vital.  I am sure we would all subscribe to that philosophy regardless of our own political ideological views. The Government will publish Pathways to Work, which will outline its approach to deepening the labour market activation policy area.  In my view, the social protection budget needs to be viewed holistically.  Capital spending on job creating programmes will be increased in 2012.  My Department and its agencies will be able to continue current levels of spending on job creation, to increase the scope for some crucial programmes and to implement some new measures.  In my area of responsibility, research and innovation, there is an allocation of €370 million for 2012, although that is a slight decrease at only 98% of last year's provision.  However, it allows us to continue to support the collaboration between research and industry.  It will enable us to support Irish companies to gain capacity to develop innovative products and services, which are vital for survival and growth, and will strengthen Ireland's capacity to attract high quality foreign direct investment companies and to embed them here as a consequence of our cutting edge innovative profile, the ultimate aim being the creation of jobs and to move people back to work or into upskilling and away from the social protection measures on which they rely.  We know that companies that invested in research and innovation and ensured their products or services have a competitive edge have held or grown market share or employment. The increased capital budget in 2012 will allow for a 4% increase in the Enterprise Ireland capital budget, maintenance of the IDA and County Enterprise Boards capital budgets, delivery of the partial loan guarantee scheme and microfinance loan fund, an €18 million spend on innovation fund Ireland to further improve the Irish venture capital industry and, specifically, in the area of research and innovation, it will enable new technology centres in cloud, e-learning and financial services to be commenced.  There is also a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships, support for the Science Foundation Ireland research community of more than 3,000 researchers, including research teams working with more than 500 industry partners.  The programme for research in third level institutions will be also maintained.  The number of technology innovation development awards will be doubled to 200.  We are also improving R&D tax credits.  The first €100,000 of companies' expenditure on research and development will be allowed, on a volume basis, for the purpose of the R&D tax credit.  The outsourcing arrangements for R&D purposes will be improved in a targeted manner to allow the greater of the existing percentage arrangement or €100,000.  Companies will have the option of using some portion of the R&D to reward key employees who have been involved in research and development.  All of this will ensure companies can grow, create employment and move people, in particular research funded graduates, into workplaces, thus reducing people's dependency on social protection measures. The future for business lies in remaining competitive and maintaining an innovative edge over our competitors.  The initiatives on R&D tax credits announced in the budget will send a clear signal to businesses that this Government is supporting their efforts to develop new products and processes and to assist them in winning new markets in the current challenging environment and, ultimately to create jobs.  During the next two years, the Government will commit approximately €1 billion in enterprise capital supports.  The enterprise capital budget is not alone being largely maintained, the capital provision is receiving a small increase in 2012, its highest level ever.  In the context of total capital cuts of €750 million in 2012, this represents a major statement of Government priorities. The Government has chosen to prioritise jobs and enterprise.  The budget announcements this week are a tangible result of that choice.  The budget provision of €20 million will assist this process and the measures are designed to ensure that the Government aids recovery in order that those on the live register can take up the work that is being created as a result of these initiatives.  The Government has delivered on the commitment in the programme for Government not to cut primary social welfare payments.  Child benefit rates for the first two children remain unchanged at €140 per month.  The Government is unwilling to impose the level of cuts to social welfare spending espoused by the previous Government, that is, by an additional €665 million in 2012.  Instead, it is limiting the adjustment in social protection spending to €475 million or slightly more than 2% of the Department's spend in 2012. The primary weekly social welfare payments are fully protected.  For example, jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit remain unchanged at €188 per week, while the child benefit rate for the third child will be reduced to €148 and for the fourth and subsequent children to €160 from 2012.  If one compares this with Northern Ireland——
17218	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	475	 —— child benefit in Northern Ireland is £102.50 per month for the first child and £67.70 per month for each additional child.  Moreover, the adult rate for jobseeker's allowance and benefit in Northern Ireland is £78.33 for an individual and £122.95 for a couple.  The rate here will continue to be €188 for an individual and €312.80 for a couple.  Payments to carers also will be maintained and the half-rate carer's allowance will continue to be paid to those who are full-time carers and who are in receipt of another welfare payment. One must provide context to this Social Welfare Bill.  Those who will pore over these debates for historical purposes must know that the loans that are financing our day-to-day spending are subject to the condition that we reduce our deficit to 3% of gross domestic product by 2015.  While the Government has been obliged to take some tough decisions, in fairness it has preserved the basic rates.  It also has acknowledged a mistake it made and is moving to address it.  The Government is trying to create labour market activation measures that will move people from dependence on social protection into work and is doing its best in that regard.

Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration. I consider that there is further work to be done on the issue between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General. It is an issue on which there is interaction between rights holders, the internet service providers (ISPS) and the end users, of whom there are millions. We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct in this area. I have been holding discussions with a number of the stakeholders, in this regard, and I hope to be in a position to finalise this matter by the middle of January 2012.

This €5m was for the provision of e-Journals, which allows scientific researchers access to key databases, to assist them in conducting their work. This was not an additional cost to the Exchequer in 2011. The indicative SFI allocation for 2012 is as follows: Capital/Research Grants allocation is €156m. Current expenditure/Pay allocation is €4.40m. Current expenditure/Non-Pay cost allocation to run SFI programmes is €4.49m. The number of researchers supported in each year from 2004-2011 is set out in a table: Year Number of Researchers directly supported by SFI 2004 1,067 2005 1,610 2006 1,362 2007 2,409 2008 2,806 2009 3,225 2010 2,999 2011 3,000 (estimated) In 2012 the capital provision of €156m to SFI will allow it to retain support for the current levels of approximately 3,000 researchers and 28 research centres, subject to a number of factors including the quality and strategic relevance of new grant applications received. There are no changes to qualifying conditions for funding arising from the Budget.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. My Department does not set aside funding in its budget to cover expenditure resulting from severe weather.  Instead, local authorities are provided with flexibility, where possible, to amend their Specific Improvement Grants Programme or their Restoration Improvement Programme to accommodate remedial works.  As you will be aware, the initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these State grants is a matter for each local authority, and it is open to local authorities to prioritise these works and revise their applications should they wish to do so. The 2011 regional and local road grant allocations have now been allocated and there are no further funds available at this time from which an additional allocation could be made.
17229	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	" I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  A number of points have been raised in each of the contributions.  I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to respond.  I am concerned at the continuing situation at the Vita Cortex factory in Cork which has involved workers at the plant engaging in a sit-in since 16 December last arising from a dispute with their employer over redundancy payments.  The workers involved in the Vita Cortex sit-in are seeking severance terms of 2.9 weeks per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, in line with previous redundancy deals at the company, and they maintain this will amount to a total of €1.2 million.  We know that the workers had been offered a paltry sum of €1,500 to leave the premises over the Christmas period and they rightly rejected this offer claiming that the company would use their absence to remove important machinery and stock. The company stated that it informed workers that their redundancy would have to come from the State's social insurance fund unless NAMA agreed to release €2.5 million held on deposit by another Vita Cortex firm on foot of an Allied Irish Banks, AIB, loan taken over by NAMA.  However, NAMA issued a statement that these funds were put out of reach of the Vita Cortex group not by NAMA but by AIB two and a half years ago when they were pledged as security for loans.  While NAMA has stated that it empathises with the Vita Cortex workers, it has stated that: ""unfortunately legally it cannot simply use charged deposit funds pledged against loans of one company to meet costs incurred by a separate legal entity"".  NAMA also stated that it is the responsibility of the owners and shareholders of Vita Cortex to resolve this situation.  It is difficult to disagree with that contention.  In the interests of achieving a resolution in this dispute, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, urged both parties to avail of the State's industrial relations machinery as soon as possible with a view to exploring ways of resolving the issues in dispute. Officials from my Department were in contact with the workers' union representatives over the holiday period, in an effort to clarify the issues involved and to make them aware that the industrial relations machinery of the State is available to help them resolve the dispute.  I understand that the Labour Relations Commission has today invited both parties to meet in Cork next Tuesday to clarify the facts and to explore with the parties the potential for moving forward.  I welcome the initiative by the LRC and urge both parties to engage constructively in the process.  Engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way at this stage."
17230	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	 The ultimate aim is to ensure that the rights of workers are vindicated.  We all have that interest at heart.  The second aim is to ensure that corporate social responsibility is adhered to and that there is some degree of corporate governance.  I agree with the Deputies on the perceived Byzantine structures of Vita Cortex.  We must also remember that Vita Cortex was a recipient of State funding.  It would be in the interests of this State to ensure that we can shine a light on those companies in some way.  If there is a mechanism through which a query can be made to the Director of Corporate Enforcement about the company structure, then I actively encourage people to use it. It is impossible to say at this stage what the premise of the discussions will be.  The LRC extended the invitation just today and I hope that both parties will agree to engage in that process.  We should see where we can go from there.  Other points were raised in respect of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation meeting with both sides and with company management.  I will take back those points to the Minister. We need to ensure that the State will use its force in a positive sense to ensure that workers' rights are vindicated.  We are not going to rest on that-----
17231	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	109	 I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Martin about the legal basis of NAMA's position.  I will also bring that to the Minister.
17232	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	 No one political entity in the House has a monopoly on the rights of workers.  I spoke with regard to the Vita Cortex case, in which there is a serious breach of corporate social responsibility and corporate governance, and the same applies in respect of this case.  There is no question but that the rights of workers have not been vindicated and have been trampled upon.  Under legislation from 1977 to 2007 governing the protection of employees, a number of provisions deal with an information and consultation process that must be entered into prior to any redundancies being implemented and the provision of information to employees and to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In this case, the Minister has not received any statutory notice of such redundancies.  That is a serious breach in the first instance.  There is a need for my Department to engage with Mr. Meegan and others of Mandate who, it is reported met KPMG today.  I would like to get an assessment of what transpired at that meeting because the points raised on this and the previous Topical Issue matter go to the heart of industrial relations policy and vindicating the rights of workers.  As a Government, we must ensure there are no precedents set and the legislation is adhered to by corporate entities, individuals and citizens.  There is no question that we support the rights of workers as set down in legislation and will seek to do so. By way of being helpful, I express my willingness to meet workers representatives on this issue in order that we can provide some degree of assistance where possible.  I am keeping my statement brief because I realise Members will wish to make further submissions.
17233	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 I acknowledge the points made by the Deputies and I am not one to pay lip service to issues such as this.  With respect, I have indicated that I want to meet the workers' representatives on this issue.  I am concerned, as Deputy McDonald has pointed out, that there is a perceived breach of legislation.  There is a perceived breach of legislation in respect of sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 and Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations whereby employees, whose employer has not complied with sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, may refer complaints to a rights commissioner.  There are issues around the mandatory notice to employers.  Please allow me that mode of communication and let us see how we can proceed.
17234	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	 I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise. The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal. The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet society service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability. In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information. It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month.

Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved. Broadly speaking, individual copyright holders and rights holders organisations supported the amendment in principle, with some arguing for stricter measures. The various elements of the communications industry who responded were mostly opposed.

17246	SeanSherlock	Labour	14281.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-12 00:00:00	Prelude	111	 Achieving savings in the Department's budget has required difficult decisions.  Despite pressures on spending, the Government has shielded to the greatest extent possible front line services in schools.  The Government has and will continue to prioritise targeted supports for schools, with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme and action plan.  More than €158 million is currently being provided by way of additional resources and supports for primary and post-primary schools, including DEIS.  This is only part of an overall amount of some €700 million, which continues to be provided to tackle educational disadvantage across the full education spectrum, from pre-school to further and higher education.  This includes schemes such as the school completion programme and disadvantaged youth, which now come under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the school meals programme, which comes under the Department of Social Protection. It is important to note that a key aspect of the EU-IMF programme of support and Ireland's overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll.  This is a particular challenge for the education sector, considering that a third of all public sector employees work there.  Furthermore, unlike in other countries, our school-going population is rising rapidly and places must be provided for the extra 70,000 pupils arriving in our schools in the next six years.  Providing for increased enrolments is a key priority but making some adjustment to teacher numbers is unavoidable, given budgetary constraints. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.  We are conscious of the concerns of some schools which will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of posts under previous disadvantaged schemes, and with these concerns in mind we have made clear since the budget announcement that this matter would be managed as sensitively as possible.  To this end the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has met school principals, teachers, parents and community representatives in recent weeks to hear their concerns and clarify the position of announced changes in the 2012 budget to posts allocated to schools under previous schemes to tackle educational disadvantage. The Minister has held many meetings with members of my parliamentary party and all Government colleagues, who have performed an invaluable service in assisting him in developing an understanding of the impact of the proposed measures in these schools.  It is in this context that the Department of Education and Skills has been directed to report to the Minister within the next four weeks on the position of DEIS band one and band two schools which currently have posts under schemes predating DEIS.  That will done in the context of staff allocations due to issue to all schools in the coming weeks.  We look forward to receiving that report and continuing the process of engagement with schools on the impact of the measures announced in the 2012 budget.

17250	SeanSherlock	Labour	14281.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-12 00:00:00	Prelude	127	 I thank Deputy O'Dea for his remarks and accept in good faith the manner in which he proposed his amendment.  It is our intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2011 by way of an order as soon after the enactment of the Patents Amendment Act 2011 as possible.  I am very conscious of the points the Deputy has made in that sense. I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill through Report Stage in this House.  The purpose of the Bill is to make the necessary changes to the Patents Act 1992 to provide for the ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement, which aims to reduce the cost to applicants of the European patent process by reducing the requirements to file translations of the granted patents under the European Patent Convention.  It is a technical Bill that deletes references in the existing Act to the requirement for translations to validate a European patent in Ireland.  The short Bill makes changes to the Patents Act 1992 that relate exclusively to the European Patent Convention. In this instance it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them in line with the London Agreement.  The proposed amendments to the patent rules 1992 are being drafted.  It is my intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2012 by way of an order as near to the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 as possible.  I thank the Deputies opposite and in particular Deputy O'Dea for their assistance in allowing us to introduce this legislation which strengthens the intellectual property infrastructure of Ireland, making Ireland a more competitive place to locate and manage intellectual property rights.

I will start by providing clarification on last point made, on the assumption that the Deputy may be leaving the Chamber.
17264	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	121	 Students can study Russian on the leaving certificate curriculum.  There are a number of Confucius Institutes throughout the State where Chinese languages may be learned, as well as at University College Cork and quite a number of secondary schools.  As to Portuguese, I may revert to the Deputy on that one.  I note the point he is making; we are conscious of that. In his introductory speech, the Minister set out the rationale for the proposed Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011, which is necessary to meet our obligation to transpose the EU directive on temporary and agency workers.  In the contributions by Deputies on the Bill, it has been evident that there is, in general, an overall welcome for the Bill in this House, with most Deputies expressing their support in recognition of the fact that it is a fair and balanced measure to improve the level of protection for agency workers under employment law.  While Deputies have indicated broad support for the thrust of the Bill, I note the intention on the part of a number of Deputies to table amendments on Committee Stage in order to achieve greater clarity in some aspects of the Bill. In several interventions on the Bill, there has been a strong emphasis on the need for balance in the manner in which the EU directive is transposed, so that the necessary protections for agency workers do not act as a deterrent to our ability to sustain existing jobs and increase employment.  Given the current challenges that face the Government in the domestic labour market and the economy generally, the Bill has been drafted with a view to achieving this necessary balance.  It provides that agency workers are afforded equal treatment, in respect of their basic working and employment conditions, with directly recruited employees who occupy the same job.  This marks a further important step forward in workers' rights and builds on the already considerable baseline of rights afforded to agency workers in this country who are protected under the existing suite of employment legislation. The Government is fully committed to decent standards of employment across the spectrum of work.  It is clear that agency workers have, on an incremental basis, been brought within the scope of employment rights legislation over many years, including legislation on the payment of wages and unfair dismissals.  In addition, agency workers in Ireland, unlike in some other jurisdictions, also enjoy entitlements under redundancy payment legislation.  In terms of minimum standards of pay, temporary agency workers are already covered in legislation governing the national minimum wage; as Deputies will be aware, the Government has, true to the commitment given in the pre-election period last year, reversed the reduction in the minimum wage rate.  This Bill therefore builds on existing standards of protection that are conferred on agency workers and reflects the Government's willingness to fully support the principle of fairer treatment for agency workers. The Government must have regard to other equally valid concerns that have been expressed about the need to create a positive environment for businesses to grow and develop.  A number of Deputies referred to the importance of agency workers in the multinational sector as well as in the domestic economy.  A fully functioning labour market that contributes to the retention of jobs, and indeed future growth, is important in these challenging times.  We must maintain labour market flexibility in all areas, including the area of agency work, which provides flexibility for workers and employers alike. Deputies raised a number of issues during the course of the debate.  With regard to the failure of the national social partners to reach agreement on a qualifying period before equal treatment would apply, this is, as the Minister outlined in his introductory speech on the Bill, a matter of regret, as it would at least mean that recruitment agencies that operate both north and south of the Border would be operating under similar arrangements in both jurisdictions to allow an all-of-Ireland approach.  While there is still time for the national social partners to negotiate agreement on this issue should the basis for such an agreement become apparent before the deliberations of the Oireachtas on this Bill are complete and the Bill is enacted, the basis for such agreement is not currently in evidence and, as Deputies will be aware, the Legislature cannot unilaterally provide for this derogation. The legislation is, with the exception of the offence provisions, being made retrospective to 5 December 2011 - that is, the date of transposition of the directive.  This is because the State is obligated by virtue of its EU commitments under the treaties to have the transposing measure in place as and from the transposition date, and the advice available to the Government indicates that this course of action is required.  I appreciate the difficulties associated with retrospective application, and that is why, in the interest of providing the greatest possible level of clarity to all parties affected by this legislation, my Department moved quickly, following the breakdown of negotiations on the qualifying period with the national social partners on 30 November 2011, to communicate with the various stakeholders.  Advertisements were taken out in the national newspapers and the Department produced a guidance document and placed it on its website to cover the issues of greatest interest to all parties. A number of Deputies referred to the importance of agency working in the multinational and domestic sector and pointed out that, contrary to common perception, agency workers are in some instances very well remunerated.  It is important to note that the directive and this Bill aim to provide a new minimum floor of basic entitlements and pay.  For this reason, there is no intention to include other elements that are not required by the directive, such as pensions, sick pay, maternity top-up and benefits-in-kind.  The latter are discretionary elements that are not, in the words of the directive, binding and generally applicable.  Given the current economic circumstances, now is not the time to try to provide gilt-edged conditions of employment when the creation of employment on a fair and equitable basis is what is required. Under this Bill, agency workers are entitled to be treated, in their basic working and employment conditions, including pay, as if they were directly recruited by the hiring organisation to occupy the same job.  I am conscious that a number of interventions have focused on the need for a comparator in this situation, and have referred to the tests under section 2 of the Bill in which any such comparable employee might be identified.  I am conscious that the Bill needs to be as clear as possible to ensure delivery of the fundamental principle enshrined in Article 5.1 of the directive.  In this regard, it is not necessary for the purposes of this legislation and the entitlement of agency workers to equal treatment to have a real - what might be termed flesh-and-blood - comparator; section 6 of the Bill provides for this.  Of course, where there is such a comparator, that makes it easier to establish that equal treatment applies, and this is provided for in section 6(1)(a) of the Bill.  Where there is no such comparator, section 6(2)(b) effectively places the onus of responsibility on the hirer to notify the employment agency of the relevant terms and conditions, including pay rates, that would apply if a comparable employee were to be hired by the hirer. A number of Deputies referred to the fact that the outworking of the legislation gives rise to intricate and complex issues at an operational level.  For this reason, they considered that the Bill would benefit from further clarification in some instances.  In legislation of this nature, which is designed to embrace the main principles and policies at issue, it is difficult to encompass all of the outworking of the legislation that follows on from the Bill.  While I agree that the Bill will need to be perfected in certain aspects to provide some necessary clarifications - in that context, it is intended to table some amendments on Committee Stage - many of the issues raised by Deputies will be clarified by the development of further guidance.  It has been the practice of the Department in introducing new employment legislation to prepare a guidance publication that is better geared to deal in greater depth with the detail required, and that is also the intention in this instance. Finally, there was some discussion about section 7 of the Bill.  Deputy Boyd Barrett, in particular, had concerns about this section in case it was intended as some type of escape hatch from the provisions of the Bill.  It is important to clarify that this is not the intention behind section 7, which is a provision that is welcomed by all stakeholders in that it will recognise existing collective arrangements in place such as under registered employment agreements in some sectors.  It will also allow for the conclusion, in the future, of collective arrangements at workplace or sectoral level and provides a mechanism for the registration, subject to approval, of these agreements by the Labour Court.  This type of flexibility in the labour market is very much welcomed by all parties that have an interest in this legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it is intended to bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage with a view to clarifying certain aspects that have been already mentioned.  I thank the Deputies for their considered interventions on this important Bill.

However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their postgraduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the student grant scheme. In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold.  The income threshold for this level of grant is being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012-13 academic year.

Another 4,000 students will receive a fee contribution of €2,000.  The new arrangements will apply to two thirds of the postgraduate cohort on the lowest incomes, which is arguably a wider cohort of students.
17270	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	233	 It is like trying to measure how long is a piece of string.  We cannot predict the impact of this in terms of exact numbers and participation rates.  Participation rates at third level are determined by a myriad of factors and income is not the only criterion.  Parental aspects, social and cultural factors, the level of pre-existing educational attainment, whether someone is in employment, whether someone has lost a job and a certain amount of income are other factors.  One can safely assume it will have a negative impact but we do not know for certain and there is no way of measuring its impact.  It is part of a package of measures the Department and the Government had to take in reducing spending.  We are honest about that.  We must try to ensure the student assistance fund, at the behest of individual institutions, is retained and that tax reliefs for postgraduate students are retained.  Arising from these budgetary adjustments, the people who are least affected are the people who will be given the greatest chance to go to postgraduate education, namely, those who are on the lower income thresholds.  We have tried to protect and preserve that.
17271	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	236	 That is a very subjective statement.  There is no way of predicting the number of people who will apply for postgraduate courses, except to say that it is increasing year on year.  Ironically, this increase is as a result of the loss of economic sovereignty.  I take the point made by Deputy Smith in respect of interaction with industry.  The research prioritisation exercise will be published and its purpose is to derive greater economic benefits from the research we are carrying out.  There is a deepening collaboration between industry and academia in terms of research.  I am talking to global companies that provide thousands of jobs in this country and I am talking to indigenous firms that want to move into the space of taking on board more graduates.  Labour market activation measures, which will be launched shortly, will also attest to this. In terms of the finite number, we must know the number of people who will apply for funding before we know the endgame in terms of the amount allocated.  There is no doubt that the level of a person's economic resources has an impact on the level of educational attainment.  We are seeking to ensure we can fund those with the lowest incomes.  A number of postgraduate research based courses are funded by industry or through calls.  We must also bear this in mind.

The Strategy provides for a range of measures which will improve mathematics.  These include curriculum reform, actions with parents to support their children's learning, improved initial and continuing professional development for teachers, strengthened assessment, school leadership and planning, and support for children with identified needs. In that context, a national programme of professional development is under way for primary and second level schools.  Primary schools have been asked to increase the time spent on mathematics by 70 minutes per week from January 2012, to introduce a third point of standardised testing in literacy and maths, and to report the results to parents as part of an overall report on their children's progress. I recently launched a report on the first phase of evaluation of DEIS which shows significant improvements in literacy and numeracy scores since 2006/7, and a report of English reading and Mathematics achievement in Irish medium schools.
17273	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	341	 The Enterprise Platform Programme (EPP) comprises a suite of entrepreneurship development courses operated by the Institutes of Technology (IoTs).  The Programme has become an established mechanism for the development of entrepreneurs and the creation of start-up businesses across the regions. The Programme was funded until mid-2010 by the Higher Education Authority at which point budgetary responsibility transferred to Enterprise Ireland. During 2011 Enterprise Ireland and the IoTs conducted a review of the current programme, with the objective of improving programme performance and increasing value for money.  Arising from this review the operation of the programme has been redesigned in an effort to ensure increased value for money through more competitive operating costs, greater economies of scale through, for example, partnerships and consortia of IoTs, higher standards of entry and progression, and more focus on output metrics.  The overarching aim of the programme is to accelerate the development of sustainable new businesses which have strong employment and export potential.  The enterprises developed on the programme will be primarily based on a technology or innovative business application.  Enterprise Ireland anticipates that approximately 100 business starts of varying scale will emerge from the programme annually and that of these a significant proportion will evolve to become HPSUs. The revised EPP will operate as an intensive programme focusing on developing the entrepreneur's skills and the business concept.  It will be targeted at scaleable businesses based on innovative or knowledge intensive product or service and will seek high-quality potential entrepreneurs who show both the commitment and the capability to develop sustainable businesses. The following IoTs will operate the programme and are currently phasing in the new programme. Waterford IT in partnership with IT Carlow Cork IT Limerick IT in partnership with IT Tralee Galway Mayo IT IT Sligo in partnership with Letterkenny IT Dundalk IT IT Tallaght in partnership with IT Blanchardstown Dublin IT Athlone IT Enterprise Ireland will provide expertise and support to the IoTs and will engage in promotion of the programme both nationally and overseas to high-quality potential entrepreneurs.

17285	SeanSherlock	Labour	14293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-24 00:00:00	Prelude	558	 I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal. The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability. In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.  It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month. The Minister does not have information in relation to the costs of copyright infringement in the area of digital piracy.  Independent research as to the effects of illegal downloading is limited therefore the costs of such activity are not readily quantifiable. However, in the judgement of Mr Justice Charleton in EMI & Others vs UPC (2009 no. S472 P) it is noted that Mr Dick Doyle of the Irish Recorded Music Association posited a cost of €20m per annum in relation to music.
17286	SeanSherlock	Labour	14293.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-01-24 00:00:00	Prelude	558	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 718 to 720, inclusive, together. I am actively pursuing the rationalisation programme set out in the Public Service Reform Plan with the relevant agencies.  Developments so far in relation to agencies for which I have responsibility are that Dundalk Port Company merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, and Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1 January 2012. I also recently announced that Dublin Tourism is being merged with its parent body — Failte Ireland — as part of the rationalisation programme. Furthermore, there is a review being undertaken with regard to the future tourism role of Shannon Development and its possible integration into Fáilte Ireland, while Coaching Ireland has been subsumed into the Irish Sports Council. On the issue of possible further rationalisation, the Public Service Reform Plan requires that a number of other agencies are subject to critical review which will be completed by June of this year. In addition, a ports policy review is at an advanced stage and I hope to publish a revised policy document in the coming months. Port Company restructuring is one of the issues being considered as part of the policy review.  It is not possible to quantify the potential savings from rationalisation until full details of each implementation have been worked through with the agencies in question.
17287	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	640	 There are no proposals to introduce a Government guaranteed export credit insurance scheme for Irish exporters to these countries.  The Government's position on this issue has been informed by the findings of the 2009 report commissioned by my Department from KPMG consultants.  That report established that the introduction of such a scheme would be expensive, with significant ongoing costs arising for the State.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about €1.7 million, and this cost would rise significantly if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative. Under EU state aid rules, any such state scheme is not normally permissible for short-term credit insurance.  Most Irish exports fall into this category.  A temporary derogation was established in 2009 due to the financial crisis at that time.  That is now under review and is very unlikely to be maintained.  Even under this current exemption, the specific provisions of any scheme must be approved by the European Commission.  Approval would include a condition that the level of insurance premia to be paid by companies should be higher than rates provided in the open market.  This is a considerable deterrent to business, and some of the schemes introduced by other member states had poor uptake for this reason. In the intervening two years, there has been an improvement in the market for short-term export credit insurance.  Insurers have recovered their capacity for risk and the market has recovered significantly, with both new entrants to the market and new products being offered.  This has greatly improved the availability of export credit insurance on the commercial market. The publication of the detailed KPMG report is not possible.  The forensic analysis on the operation of the market for this type of insurance was only possible through the provision of sensitive, confidential data and detailed company specific information to KPMG.  This information was provided to KPMG on the condition of strict confidentiality.  Given the commercial sensitivity of this material and the limited number of companies in the market, both KPMG and the Department signed legally binding agreements with the insurers that the information provided would not be released. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. While the background research and analytical elements of the KPMG report cannot therefore be released, the key overall findings were publicised at the time and supported the view that a State supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.  This remains the position but will be kept under ongoing review, including in light of advice and evidence from the appropriate agencies and business representative groups.  As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, a commitment of large-scale funding to an initiative with marginal benefits for Irish industry and high level risks to the State would be unwise.
17288	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	642	 I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  The strict confidentiality clause, which was one of the conditions that applied when people gave information during the compilation of that report, should be respected.  We can provide the Deputy with the information that is available from Enterprise Ireland about export figures and the opportunities that are arising in the BRIC countries.  The Deputy also asked about investment in jobs and the opportunities that will arise after February.  A great deal of work is ongoing at Government level to compile the new action plan for jobs.  More lateral themes are being explored as we do that.  I hope the Deputy will take in good faith my assurance that we are trying to explore and mine as many opportunities as we can.  I say that in response to the point she made about job creation.  If I understood the point the Deputy was making correctly, she said we should avail of the intellectual capacity of people who will find themselves in a new situation after February of this year.  The State needs to provide opportunities to such people, or engage with them at least.

17291	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1358	" My Department, through the work of the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offers a range of supports to assist and enable Irish entrepreneurs and enterprises to engage in the optimal exploitation of innovation, research and development and to apply for patents.  The Patents Office provides information supports to applicants through the Office's website www.patentsoffice.ie   regarding patenting procedures in Ireland and abroad. The Patents Office also provides an Intellectual Property (IP) clinic service providing members of the public, inventors, entrepreneurs and business people an opportunity to discuss on a one to one basis with Patents Office staff their ideas and matters concerning IP. Since April 2010, the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Enterprise Europe Network and County Enterprise Boards have partnered to present a series of one day free seminars at a range of regional locations under the working title of ""Building a Business on your Ideas"".  Support nationally and locally for micro enterprises, small businesses and new start ups is provided through the wide range of assistance offered by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland.   Both the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland tailored programmes and supports in the form of grants, business advice, training and mentoring elements of which are directed at ensuring that innovative technologies and intellectual property are secured and protected. EI has strengthened the resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property and have recently appointed (January 2012)  an Intellectual Property Manager,  whose role is to act as the central point in EI for enquiries and advice on IP matters as a strategic tool in business development.  In addition, EI's Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme drives the national effort in transferring IP from the research base in the HEIs and Research Institutes in Ireland into industry, while the Technology Partnering Programme aims at partnering Irish client companies with multi-national corporations with a view to facilitating access to and promotion of significant technologies via licensing of IP and technology spin-outs.  EI also provides funding support for innovative High Potential Start-Ups under which assistance is provided towards the patent costs of the company to protect its in-house intellectual property.  Under the EI R&D Fund patent costs are an eligible expenditure item which can be included in the support offered. While it is first and foremost a matter for owners of IP to decide on the best way to protect IP rights, those owners can be confident that the Government is committed to ensuring Irish IP legislation reflects best practice in IP protection systems in Europe and elsewhere.  Indeed, the Government has been making a sustained effort over recent years to ensure that patent, trademark, industrial design and copyright laws, among other IP areas, are kept as up to date as possible. This work arises primarily in the context of EU and other international obligations. In the area of patents, my Department continues to make it easier for enterprises to patent their innovations. The Patents Amendment Bill 2011, currently in the Seanad, will enable Ireland to implement the London Agreement with the effect of lowering the current high level of translation costs for patent applicants. At EU level, Ireland is actively participating in the enhanced cooperation process for a unitary patent that will further reduce costs for Irish innovators wishing to obtain patent protection across Europe."

17297	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	496	 I will begin by confirming that this is absolutely not a version of the SOPA legislation.  It is a restatement of a position on copyright that the Government has held to be the case.  The Charleton judgment in the case of EMI v. UPC held that Ireland was not ad idem with the EU copyright directive.  We are implementing a statutory instrument to give voice to that judgment and bring us into line with the directive.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 was implemented in the State.  Every member state of the European Union has the right to seek an injunction, in line with EU legislation, in the event of a perceived infringement of the copyright of a party.  Prior to the Charleton judgment, to which we were not a party, our position was that we were in line with EU legislation.
17298	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	498	 I do not have one.  When Mr. Justice Charleton issued his judgment, we considered it was best to remove any doubt by restating our position, as set out in the 2000 Act.  That is what is before us today - an amendment to the Act to ensure we are in line with the judgment.  Every member state has the right to seek an injunction in the event of a perceived breach of copyright.  Before a judge makes a decision he or she will need to have regard to the e-commerce directive which states there are inherent rights in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to freedom of expression and that the copyright directive provides that an Internet service-provider has the right to conduct a business and to have regard to the right of ordinary users to be able to use the Internet freely and openly.  We would not seek to prejudice this right in any way.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  The State funds new technologies, the development of web-based technologies to the tune of millions of euro annually and we very conscious of the need to continue to do so. I take Deputy Murphy's point about the abdication of responsibility.  However, I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that we need to see a dialogue, an engagement, between the Internet service-providers on one hand, the copyright holders on the other side and a space in between for a very highly active Internet web-based community.  They all need to sit down together to chart a way forward.  Personally, I am not averse to the notion of primary legislation but no matter what action is decided upon, we must have regard to the Charlton judgment.  If, prior to this judgment, the State already held that a person could seek infringement proceedings where a breach of copyright is perceived and there have been no sites closed down as a result, we are merely restating what is in the Copyright Act or adding to it, then it is logical to assume there will not be a move to close down further websites.
17299	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	500	 I apologise.  This is an issue which warrants more time but I will speak again if I may.
17300	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	502	 That is not what I said.
17301	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	506	 I reiterate the point that no national authority or court can require an Internet service-provider to carry out general monitoring of the information it transmits on its network.  That gives rights to the Internet service-provider and to the individual IP address or the individual user.  This means the ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  This is clearly stated in EU law. We are attempting to balance the right of the copyright holder and to transpose that which is already in EU law and then to recognise the rights of the individual user, the individual business and not to limit the freedoms of the Internet.  Nobody wants to limit the freedoms of the Internet because this is counter-intuitive.  We live in a democracy and we thrive on the businesses we have created in this country, through State intervention and subsidies which support those types of businesses. The business model pertaining to the music industry is increasingly and arguably - I will not use the word outmoded - an evolving process.  So long as it is a case of never the twain shall meet, then no matter how one legislates primarily in this field, as soon as one legislates, the Internet, of its very nature, will evolve in a way to circumnavigate the legislation.  In my view, the stakeholders must sit down together in an organic fashion because if they do not reach an agreement then no matter what Government is in power, it will never be able to legislate for this issue.  Given the level of activity on the Internet, which is to be welcomed, and the level of innovation, no one member state, no one geographical boundary, can set laws to try to control it.  This is a commonly-held view to a certain extent.  I think a liberal view is taken, in the main, regarding the power of the Internet and its inherent good.  However, as an EU member state, Ireland must have regard to copyright law.  Anyone who generates intellectual property has a right but that right is not superior to the right of the Internet service-provider nor superior to the right of the individual user.  When governments legislate, they must be very careful.
17302	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	508	 I assure Deputies that I will give this matter more study.  We will be implementing the statutory instrument, I will be very straight about that-----

The central point is that those people within that community need to start coming together.  The ISPs and the music industry people need to sit down with each other.

17317	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	327	" Let me start by repeating that I fully subscribe to the freedoms, the opportunities and the access to information that the Internet provides us with.  Ireland is home to some of the world's most innovative Internet companies and we are determined to grow our reputation as a location where smart people and these smart companies can continue to innovate in this fast moving arena. The last thing innovators need is a culture where the outputs of their creative endeavours have to be locked away or kept secret for the fear of theft.  Ireland is very proud of the fact that we have a modern suite of intellectual property laws that by their very nature balance a range of competing interests and rights in a manner that is seen right across the globe as reasonable and proportionate.  I intend that this will continue. In regard to the proposed statutory instrument, it may be useful to explain the background against which the requirement for an amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 has arisen.  In the EMI and others  v. UPC High Court judgment of 11  October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton decided that he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and thus could not grant an injunction to prevent infringement of copyright against an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of “mere conduit” transient communications.  In doing so, he stated that Ireland had not fully transposed the relevant EU directives. The ""mere  conduit"" principle provides that if an ISP does not initiate a transmission, or modify the material contained in a transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission, it is granted a ""safe harbour"" against liability by virtue of the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.  However, according to the same directive, this freedom from liability does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements. I point out that two EU directives, namely, the Copyright Directive 2001 and the Enforcement Directive 2004 require that the holders of copyright - authors, music composers, lyricists, record producers, etc. - are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  What is an intermediary?  In a nutshell, an intermediary is an ISP which provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet. My Department had considered that injunctions were available under section 40(4) of the Copyright Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  However, this was not Mr. Justice Charleton's view. In regard to the legal advice, the Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for its advice as to the implications of the High Court judgment.  The office has advised that the obligation contained in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rightholders must have a mechanism available to them to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  Separately the office advised that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance. I fully acknowledge that this is a very sensitive issue.  We seek to strike a balance between creators and users and intermediaries in regard to online services and businesses, which are of great importance to Ireland's economy.  Considering this, and in the context of the obligations due under the EU directives, discussions took place with the Office of the Attorney General and the legal adviser in our Department in order to frame a draft regulation and put it into the public domain for consultation.  The regulation follows the wording of the copyright directive so that we are in compliance and includes a very important proviso that the courts shall have due regard to the rights of any person likely to be affected and this includes, where appropriate, a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This latter provision respects the European Convention on Human Rights. After consultations with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, my Department launched a public consultation on the text of the proposed statutory instrument on 17 June 2011.  In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Association of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Limited, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, the IDA, IMIR, the International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone and Xtra-vision. Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.  The consultation attracted over 50 submissions from interested parties.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue, as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for further consideration. Following this, and after meetings with interested parties, it is clearly necessary to proceed with the statutory instrument which will restate the law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries which was considered to pertain prior to the judgment.  This will make compliance with the copyright directive manifestly clear.  The wording of the statutory instrument has been formally drafted and the text was published last Thursday, 26 January. There is no change of policy being put forward in the proposed legislative measure. It is merely a restatement of the position that was considered to be in place before a High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in October 2010.  I would like people to note the timeline, which was in October 2010.  Ireland is obliged to provide that rightsholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It should also be noted that legal proceedings against the State have been issued by the plaintiffs in the UPC case and damages arising from a successful challenge could be substantial.  The European Commission also requested information, on 22 December 2011, on Ireland's compliance with the copyright directive. While the copyright directive requires that rights holders must be able to seek an injunction against intermediaries to prevent or terminate an infringement, the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights - such as the right to freedom of expression and information, data protection, and the right to conduct a business - and that any remedy must be proportionate. No national authority or court can require an ISP to carry out general monitoring of the information that it transmits on its network.  This means an ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  National courts must strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures. As regards relevant case law, I refer to the recent Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, case, Scarlet  v. Sabam, C-70/10, which enunciated the general principles in relation to the balances required to be taken into account.  In this case on 24 November 2011, the CJEU clearly laid out the aforementioned principles that will guide all national courts in future. I beg your indulgence on this, Acting Chairperson, because there are some pertinent points."
17318	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	329	 I will read faster. In that case, the CJEU also found that requiring an ISP to install a contested filtering system would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information. I am fully aware that concerns have been expressed that the proposed statutory instrument mirrors the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States.  However, I would point out that these concerns are not based on fact.  The most worrying aspects of the US proposals would involve blocking access to websites internationally; taking down entire websites for one infringing item; blocking access to websites by the US state enforcement without notice; targeting companies between the site and end-user, without notice - for example, service providers, search engines, payment network providers and advertising networks; imposing a monitoring of content requirement on Internet companies and, in effect, forcing them to self-censor; extension of criminal liability; the by-passing of safe-harbour provisions in copyright law; lack of due process; disregard for fundamental human rights; and the involvement of government in civil infringement areas, etc. I would stress that such a regime could not be introduced in the EU, where the safe-harbour provisions are protected in the e-commerce directive and where, in implementing EU law, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights must be applied.  This includes the right to conduct a business, protection of data, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information with the right to intellectual property.  Critically, any order granted must be proportionate.  These matters must be considered when deliberating on the granting of an injunction. It is of the utmost importance to note that the purpose of the proposed statutory instrument is simply to provide explicitly that injunctions may be sought, as obligated by the two EU directives that I have already referred to, namely, the copyright directive, 2001 and the enforcement directive, 2004.  It should also be noted that such injunctions are available in all other EU member states by virtue of the two directives already referred to.  They have been required since at least December 2002 and since that time the Internet has flourished. In granting such injunctions, the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgments.  As I have already stated, these judgments require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  The statutory instrument is sufficient because, particularly following the Court of Justice decision in the Scarlet  v. Sabam case, the courts have authoritative guidance on the balance to be achieved between, on the one hand, intellectual property rights and, on the other hand, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet service providers, the protection of private data, the right of freedom of expression and information, and proportionality of any remedy.
17319	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	339	" I thank the Members opposite and I appreciate the Acting Chairman's discretion. My Department launched an independent review committee on 9 May 2011, with a view to examining and reviewing the existing Irish copyright and legislative framework.  The Copyright Review Committee is an independent body.  Its terms of reference are clear and, in general, are concerned with identifying any areas that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation, and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified. Following the advice of both the former and current Attorneys General, it is considered necessary that Ireland's position in ensuring that rightsholders can apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are being used to infringe their copyright, must be restated.   Otherwise, the State is at risk of actions against it, which would probably result in substantial damages.  Nothing the review committee could suggest can change this fact.  It is difficult to see what conditions could be attached to the statutory instrument that are not already provided for by EU law, for example, data protection, freedom of expression, information, and freedom to conduct a business.  The copyright review committee is expected to publish its first consultation papershortly following consideration of the submissions received.  One of the items for further consideration could be a voluntary forum for all stakeholders, in which various copyright matters could be discussed. An intermediary is an ISP that provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet.  As such, an entity such as www.boards.ie, because it avails of the hosting exemption, could be considered an intermediary.  However, no injunction may be taken against it provided it abides by the notice and take down procedures as set out in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, to which section 40(4) refers. In conclusion, in proposing to amend the copyright legislation, I am particularly conscious of the importance of online content and digital businesses in the Irish context and, by introducing the proposed statutory instrument, I am simply seeking to ensure Ireland's continued compliance with its obligations under the relevant EU directives following the decision of the High Court in the aforementioned UPC case.  It is clear from the rulings of the European court that any remedy applied will have to be proportionate and we can be confident that this approach protects rightsholders by allowing them the access to the courts that we must provide while protecting the fundamental rights of third parties and fellow citizens. Changes are expected at EU level in several areas affecting e-commerce.  For instance, the main objective of the informal competitiveness Council in Copenhagen on 2 and 3 of February 2012 is to reach a common understanding of the most important, concrete actions needed at EU level and in member states to create a well-functioning digital Single Market.  It is understood that discussions will be held on the necessity for providing clarification at EU level on the liability of Internet service providers and to provide certainty for those providers when made aware of illegal content on their websites.  Among other proposals, a European framework for notice and action procedures will be considered. Going back to 22 December 2002, the date by which every EU member state had to have implemented Directive 2001/29/EC, every EU country has had to ""ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right"".  Having that provision enshrined in EU law and the laws of member states for a decade has not restricted the development of the Internet or innovative Internet companies.  On the contrary, the Internet has flourished.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her indulgence in granting me a few extra minutes."
17320	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	348	 As I outlined in my speech, one must have regard to proportionality.  The Sabam ruling is such that if somebody were to seek an injunction before a judge, the latter would have to establish that infringement occurred in the first instance.  In making such a decision, a judge must have regard to the basic rights that exist.    Members articulated the circumstances that arise in this regard with reference to the EU charter of fundamental rights and the rights in the copyright directive.  A judge would have to have regard to the facts that there is a copyright holder and that there is an individual ISP, a business, with the right to conduct its business, as is inherent in the EU copyright directive.  In other words, the right of the copyright holder is not superior to that of the individual citizen or business. With regard to seeking an injunction and measuring costs, there is no way of determining the actual cost, even though individuals have come forward with proposals on the cost of a High Court injunction.  I would have faith in the fact that the Irish judicial system would have to have regard to the fact that there are specific rights regarding monitoring, especially in light of the Sabam ruling. On the effect of an ISP, one must ask what is an intermediary.  I have outlined this in my speech and will probably not repeat it.  It is question of proportionality.  If a person is accessing a site such as www.youtube.com and is not acting legally, a court would have to have regard to the need for proportionality.  Why would an Irish court shut down an Irish website, potentially with millions of users, because of the actions of one person?  One could argue it would be an infringement of the right of the business person to conduct his business.  The issue of proportionality, therefore, must come into play.  There are certain fundamental rights that must be adhered to.  Before an injunction is sought, a judge in Ireland would have to have complete regard for those rights.  I hope that answers the question.
17321	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 I take the Deputy's points.  I do not believe reputational damage will arise from this.  It is a statutory instrument.  We must ask its purpose.  We must bear in mind Mr. Justice Charleton's judgment in the case of EMI and others v. UPC.  Advice received from the Attorney General under the last and current mandates stated that, in order to remove any doubt as to the right of the copyright holder to seek an injunction, the best approach would be to amend existing legislation.  In this statutory instrument, all we are doing is amending existing legislation, namely the Copyright Act.  Having regard to the Charleton ruling, we are putting ourselves in a position in which there will be no doubt as to whether we will be compliant with EU law.
17322	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	354	 No.  I draw attention to the circumstances that would obtain if we were not a party to the EMI and others v. UPC case.  It could be stated that, under the Copyright Act 2000, the right to seek an injunction over an infringement already existed.  We are merely restating that position. The reason for much of the controversy on this stems from the fact that this issue has been arising for well over a year, bearing in mind the Charleton judgment was in 2010.  The new Government instigated a review and engaged in consultation.  People are accusing us of not consulting but we had a consultation period.  I made it clear to people that I was open to discussions with all stakeholders on this issue.  As late as last Thursday, I met the Irish Internet Association and had further discussions with it. We are not trying to impose something.  If we were to legislate from a primary perspective in regard to the Internet, we would have to be very careful about how we would do that given there are so many disparate communities within the web space as well as the copyright holders.  My preferred option, given the EU is now looking at the copyright or e-commerce directive, is that the community would start talking across the various and disparate groupings, such as the hosters, the ISPs, the software developers, the copyright holders and so on.  It is important that this community starts to consult with the various stakeholders within the community to begin the process of coming up with a strategic view as to how we can either legislate primarily or put in place voluntary agreements. My preferred option is for voluntary agreements because assuming all stakeholders come to the table honestly and openly, this ensures that if primary legislation is implemented it does not become outmoded or outdated as soon as it is enacted by virtue of further innovations within the web.  What we are doing here is merely restating a position which we hold to have already existed, namely, upholding the right of the copyright holder while having regard to the balance of rights in that respect. I do not believe primary legislation is required at this stage.  The Technical Group has put forward a proposal for a statutory instrument.  If time allows and bearing in mind there are more questions to follow, I would like to answer the individual points the Technical Group has made given it has put forward an honest and open solution to this issue.  While I have only had a brief few hours to analyse it, since it was submitted today at 12.45 p.m., there are some issues within it which I would like to address because I consider it an honest effort to address the issues at hand.
17323	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	357	 On Deputy Eoghan Murphy's point, Ireland has the concept of the take-down notice.  I use www.boards.ie and there are other examples with which we are all familiar, such as YouTube.  If a person becomes a member of www.boards.ie, the presumption is that the person has signed up to a set of behavioural protocols by which he or she will abide, and will not say anything defamatory or do anything that is in breach of copyright, as an individual user.  If the person does that, there is a mechanism so that, through its own monitoring mechanisms, www.boards.ie can expel an errant user or somebody who is, if I may use the term, acting the maggot.  Therefore, this already exists as a voluntary code dealing with behaviour. If, however, we begin legislating in a proscriptive way for every single behaviour on the Internet, we will be going down a very narrow funnel.  As I have stated and to answer Deputy O'Dea's question, the informal competitiveness council is to try to come up with a set of actions in regard to the issues we are talking about, which is the correct approach.  However, the reason we have had to implement the statutory instrument, as the Deputy will appreciate given he was a member of the last Government, is that this has been ongoing for a considerable period and the State is potentially exposed to being sued by various entities.  I must have regard to the fact it is taxpayer's money which is potentially in question. The point is that I do not believe an Irish judge, if he or she is having regard to the e-commerce directive, will not also have regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has come into operation and is the legal entity, and also the SABAM ruling.  I do not believe any Irish judge would not adhere to the principles of proportionality in this sense. To go back to the point about take-down notices, if a hoster decides it is not going to take down the content following a take-down notice on the assumption that this take-down notice is on foot of a real breach of copyright, perhaps it is then open for the person against whom the infringement occurs to seek the injunction.  What we want to do is to get into a space in this country where the system operates on a voluntary basis, with clear protocols.  To be fair, the music industry needs to adopt new models and needs to begin to get its music on to more platforms, as noted by Deputy O'Dea, and needs to begin finding new mechanisms for selling its music.  Already, Netflix is coming on stream, which will also give rise to issues.  The more content that is legally available through a multitude of mechanisms, the more likely it is we will encounter copyright theft and piracy issues. That is where we want to get to.  However, I do not believe the State should be too prescriptive about how we get to that point.  I would like to see the community coming together on that issue.
17324	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	360	" I refer to Deputy Ferris's point.  People are interpreting this as us doing the bidding of the large corporations.  This is not the stop on-line piracy act, SOPA.  We are not extending massive powers of intervention so that we can step into the breach to try to protect one side over another.  This is not SOPA legislation.  This is balancing the right of a copyright holder against the right of an individual. There are inherent rights in the charter of fundamental rights and in the e-commerce directive which give rights to the individual company to conduct its business.  We must also have regard to the rights of the copyright holder, which could be a small publishing house.  People perceive the copyright holder to be ""big music"" but it could be a small Internet publishing business, a person creating his or her own music at home.  They have copyright and certain protections.  I do not believe this measure will be used by big business as a tool to beat down websites.  Google is one of the biggest corporations in the world and it has a right to do business here if it has an Irish or European Union domain.  Those rights are protected but are not subservient to the right of the copyright holder. I take the Deputy up on a point he made about the statutory instrument.  He is infinitely more experienced than I am, as a legislator, and he will appreciate that this is not new policy and therefore a statutory instrument can apply.  We are not at odds with the programme for Government in this because we are only amending legislation.   I reply respectfully to the Deputy in that regard. This is a balancing between the two.  The small guy or girl who begins with the gaming industry have certain rights as copyright holders and we must protect them as much as we must protect the citizen's right to access the Internet.  Proportionality is the key to this debate."
17325	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	363	 At this point, I will address the points submitted by the Technical Group in regard to the statutory instrument.  I will briefly give my analysis of them.  There is not a great deal of difference between the two statutory instruments.  I respect the point made.  We are not setting out a new policy framework but clarifying legislation through an amendment to the copyright Act.  We are going back to the position prior to the EMI v. UPC case where the right to seek an injunction by a copyright holder was there. I note the Technical Group's alternative clauses propose the statutory instrument be of two-year duration.  We have to monitor events, however, in the intervening two years and move quickly if essential balances are not maintained.  That would be impeded by a two-year clause. On the Technical Group's paragraph c, my proposed statutory instrument already includes a provision that the courts will have due regard to the rights of any person affected by virtue of the grant of any such injunction and the court will give such direction, including where appropriate a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This covers the Technical Group's point and to our mind it would be the action of a prudent judge. On paragraph d, the remedy of damages will not be available against an intermediary provided it abides by the e-commerce directive.  Again, the e-commerce directive has certain rights which protect the business.  Given the wide variety of circumstances that may prevail, it is felt the best approach is to have the matter dealt with case by case through a judicial process which must balance all the rights involved.  Protections are already in place under European law.  The European Court of Justice requires all remedies must be proportionate while the right to freedom of expression and to conduct a business must be balanced with the right to intellectual property in considering the granting of an injunction.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights provides in law for the protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property and consumer protection. On paragraph e, one cannot predict future circumstances.  That is why we again feel the best approach is to deal with the matter case by case through the judicial process.  Many rights are involved in this paragraph such as the right to copyright and to intellectual property in general.  The first matter to be considered is to establish if there is an infringement.  If lawful content is also included, the right of making available by the owner of the lawful content has to be considered.  The rights of the citizen, consumer and end-user in freedom of expression and freedom to receive or impart information must also be taken into account.  The right to data protection must come into the mix on the point made by the Technical Group.  The right of the Internet service provider, ISP, to conduct a business and all that it entails must also be upheld. For the purposes of clarity, the Technical Group submitted an alternative statutory instrument, and I am addressing specific points in it. On paragraphs f and g of the Technical Group's submission concerning injunctions, these matters are already within the discretion of the court.  EU law has held any measures must be fair and proportionate and not excessively costly.  Yet again, given the varying circumstances that could arise, we feel a case-by-case analysis and the balancing of rights and consideration of all matters by judicial process is the proper forum for such decisions. On Deputy Keating's point about publicising this, I want to reiterate we had an open consultation on it.  I stated on the record I was available to meet anybody.  I have sent out three communications to all Deputies, across all parties, and Senators on this issue so far.  I have engaged with the media in as open a fashion as possible.  I am willing to talk to people and am making myself available to the Internet community to talk to it on this. On Deputy Buttimer's point about the implications of this amendment, I reiterate this is about balancing the rights of Internet users, Internet businesses and the copyright holder.  The ISPs, as I outlined earlier, are the mere conduit, the mechanism through which information flows.  They act responsibly, as do individual websites, and in the majority of cases do not overtly seek to facilitate copyright theft.  A solution to the problem might be voluntary agreements in place between copyright holders and individual ISPs, hosters and caching companies. I do not believe we are doing the bidding of big business because there are as many - a multitude of - small Irish copyright holders on this island who have the right to certain protections which are not superior to the other rights I have outlined prior to this.
17326	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	367	 I thank Deputies for a considered and thoughtful debate.  Our key belief is that we cannot trample on the rights of individual citizens or businesses.  We are trying to uphold that belief and all we are doing with this amending legislation is ensuring we are on the right side of EU law.  Copyright is a principle to which this State adheres but I reiterate it is not a superior right for the purposes of this statutory instrument. I disagree with Deputy Donnelly's contention.  The mechanism by which www.boards.ie operates is such that if members do anything untoward, a take down notice can be issued to the website.  I am sure www.boards.ie complies with take down notices where illegal activities or defamatory comments are suspected.  Why would that threaten its core business?
17327	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	369	 I listened to the Deputy.  People speak about the cost of defence.  Just because one applies for an injunction, the judge will not necessarily grant it.  We must have regard for the rights of individual companies to conduct their business and for citizens to express themselves freely.  Nobody is trampling on those rights.  This statutory instrument restates a position which we already held prior to the Charleton judgment. It is important that all the stakeholders sit down with each other to chart a strategy on how this space will operate in the future.  In the context of the disparate nature of the users and businesses that operate in this space, it is incumbent on us to chart a way forward.  I would be delighted to make myself available to facilitate that process.  As recently as this morning, there was engagement with the Internet community through the Irish Internet Association as one of the stakeholders.  We are open to that discussion.

I have already stated that it is our intention to proceed with the statutory instrument.  The State has been exposed on this issue, which has been ongoing since November 2010, and what we are doing is a proportionate response.  We will not infringe on anybody's right to conduct a business or to free expression through the Internet.
17329	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	375	 In regard to the alternative statutory instrument proposed by T.J. McIntyre, I have debated the issue with him in public media and I am not averse to engaging with the digital rights community with a view to hammering out a strategy.  However, we have to implement the statutory implement and we are doing so on foot of advice from two Attorneys General.  I have to take account of the sound advice given by an Attorney General.  This legislative measure is being introduced on foot of the legal advice my Department has obtained.  The Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for advice on the implications of the High Court judgment and it has advised that the obligation set out in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rights holders must be given a mechanism to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  The Attorney General's office advised separately that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance.  That is merely what we are doing.

I respectfully suggest they should defer to their legal advisers.  I will also defer to their legal advisers on this so that we can have a strategic conversation about how the future of the web operates in the State, but we are not changing the wording of the statutory instrument.

17335	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	657	 Some background information may be useful in appreciating the context of the proposed legislative instrument.  The EU provided in the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC for exemptions from liability for copyright infringement for intermediary service providers in cases of mere conduit, caching and hosting, upon certain conditions.  This was to provide a framework for the development of e-commerce and telecommunication industries. Although such providers are thus free from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC (as allowed for in the e-Commerce Directive) provides that rights holders must be in a position to apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. A High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, for a member of the European Union, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has been decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the Courts must take account of various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, on 24 November 2011, clearly laid out these principles that will guide all national courts in future (Case C-70/10-SABAM). These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.
17336	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	658	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 291 together. In relation to the scenario the Deputy has outlined, it is important to mention that copyright holders will not have power to compel the intermediary as stated.  The copyright owner will have the right to apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary in respect of works in which he holds the copyright. The proposed Statutory Instrument allows for the possibility of applying for an injunction only in respect of a particular works.  This would have to be considered by a court in its deliberations on the granting of an injunction against an intermediary.  Furthermore, all remedies contemplated must be proportionate, as required by the Copyright Directive, and take into account the various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.  It is important to note that following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies to the court when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, including: Protection of personal data,  Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and right to property. It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It is not a matter of believing or suspecting piracy or simply hosting copyright material. It must be shown that the services in question are used to infringe copyright. The legislation proposed is a restatement of the situation that was thought to pertain prior to the EMI & ors v UPC judgment in October 2010.  It is required in order to clarify Ireland's compliance with Art 8(3) of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.
17337	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	659	 An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law. Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works.  Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process.  This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a Treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business. It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.

More than 50 submissions were received.  Some were from rights holders such as songwriters, authors and their representatives.  Others were from telecom companies and businesses that carry out intermediary activities on the internet and still more were from bodies concerned with freedom of expression and data protection issues. I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  Legal advice, which was received with some submissions, was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.  Following this, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion and advice of the Attorney General, it is felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI & ors v UPC case.

17342	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	671	 The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, ACTA, to which the Deputy is referring, is an international legal framework to more effectively combat the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods.  As you are aware, counterfeiting and piracy are now serious problems which undermine legitimate trade and the sustainable development of the world economy.  The growth of this illegal trade has led the ACTA participants to agree to develop an instrument that will strengthen international co-operation regarding this serious development. ACTA is an agreement about the enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights.  It does not oblige any of its EU signatories to create new substantive rights or to change existing ones.  It only commits its EU signatories to ensure that the right holders can fully assert their rights if, when and where they exist.  The ACTA provisions are compatible with existing EU law.  Therefore, it will not require any revisions or adaptation of EU law and will not require any Member States to review the measures or instruments by which they implement relevant EU law. My Department has consulted the relevant Departments affected by ACTA and the Office of the Attorney General to ascertain compliance of Irish legislation with the provisions of ACTA.  It is not expected that there will be a need to amend current Irish legislation.  However, before ratifying ACTA, my Department will again confirm with all relevant Departments of State and with the Office of the Attorney General,that all legislative and administrative requirements are in place to enable Ireland to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. The Directorate General for Trade organised a stakeholder consultation exercise in both 2009 and 2010.  My Department, through advertisements on its website invited interested stakeholders to take part on both occasions. For the 2010 exercise, details regarding the stakeholder consultation exercise were also advertised on the Patent's Office website.  In addition, my Department wrote to a wide range of stakeholders to invite them to take part in the exercise.  My Department has also provided information regarding ACTA on its website, including the final text of the Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the EU and its Member States cannot conclude the Agreement without the consent of the European Parliament.  The Parliament's International Trade Committee is reviewing the Agreement, and is expected to make a decision on whether to approve it in April or May. A final plenary vote is tentatively scheduled for June.

Accordingly, the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument has been framed in a manner which merely gives effect to the wording of the EU Copyright Directive (i.e. Article 8(3) of 2001/29/EC) rather than extending its scope beyond that of intermediaries. The intended purpose of the proposed Statutory Instrument is not to enact new EU legislation but rather it seeks to merely restate the position that was thought to exist in the Copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton's judgment here and in all EU Member States.  Accordingly, the introduction of this measure by way of Statutory Instrument is not inconsistent with the legislative policy outlined in the Programme for Government.

This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter which include: Protection of personal data, Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and the right to property. I wish to inform the Deputy that the proposed Statutory Instrument provides that the owner of the copyright in a work may, in respect of that work, apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary to whom paragraph 3 of Article 8 of Directive 2001/29/EC applies.  The right of appeal in respect of any injunction granted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed Statutory Instrument would lie to the Supreme Court.

The Minister does not have any function in the setting of tariffs charged by such organisations. However, it is open to a person affected by such charges to refer any dispute in relation thereto for determination by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who has certain statutory functions in this area under the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.
17380	SeanSherlock	Labour	14301.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	866	 I wish to inform the Deputy that I have not put forward any proposals to enact a Stop Online Piracy style law. However, I would point out that an issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the Court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to  transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8  (3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law. A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed Statutory Instrument amending Section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with interested parties in relation to any issues or concerns that they have raised in relation to the matter. The amended text of the proposed Statutory Instrument was recently published by my Department.  It should be noted that this matter was also the subject of a Dáil debate on 31 January 2012.  I would expect that this legislative measure will be introduced shortly. I wish to state that the measures being proposed in the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States are of an entirely different order to that being put forward in the Statutory Instrument.
17381	SeanSherlock	Labour	14301.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	862	 Prior to 1989, the driver licensing system permitted a car and trailer to be driven under the car licence alone.  Licence categories were then changed, with separate categories covering car (Category B) and car and trailer (Category EB).  People licensed to drive with trailer before 1989 were allowed to keep their old entitlements, simply by ticking the appropriate box on the application form when renewing their licences.  Where a pre-1989 licence holder did not tick the box they would no longer retain that entitlement.  However, the entitlement could be restored up to ten years after last holding it.  If they let the entitlement to drive with a trailer lapse for longer, they must apply as learners for the purposes of driving with a trailer. The problems this system has caused for some people have been raised before with me.  I have considered the issue, and I believe it is of the utmost importance, from a safety perspective, that people are properly qualified and licensed to drive the vehicles they have charge of on our roads.  However, I have decided to change the licensing regulations so that those who have a Category B licence, and who wish to acquire a Category EB licence, will now no longer have to wait the usual 6 months before they can take the Category EB test.  This change came into effect as of 10 January 2012.  I do not propose any further legislative changes in this regard.

17385	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	294	 I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He has spoken about a specific area in County Donegal.  The broader school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department.  It transports 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 with special needs, and 4,000 vehicles are used daily.  It has been in operation for more than 40 years. For the purposes of replying to the Deputy, the definition of school transport catchment boundaries has been the subject of many submissions and representations to the Department during the years.  It is widely considered by many that the current catchment boundary areas do not reflect changed demographics.  Changes to the post-primary school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011.  One of these changes which will take effect from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year means that the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils entering a post-primary school as first entrants.  The point made by the Deputy is that this creates the potential to split families. By way of providing assistance and acknowledging County Donegal as a peripheral location, I suggest the Deputy either make direct representations to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, who has responsibility for school transport or contact the school transport section of the Department.  I acknowledge there will be anomalies under the scheme. On the budgetary provision, there are no two ways about it, a budgetary saving will be made, but if it can be done in a way that tries to apply the principles of common sense and weed out anomalies so as to avoid the splitting of family members and if a special case can be made for the region to which the Deputy refers, my respectful suggestion to him is to make representations to the Minister.
17386	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	296	 A recent survey showed that 82% of pupils attended their nearest post-primary school.  I agree that there can be anomalies in the system which have been well documented by the Deputy.  I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, about the matter.  I also advise the Deputy to make representations to the school transport section of the Department.
17387	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	294	 Since my appointment in March 2011, the Taxi Regulation Review Steering Group has been set up under Minister of State, Alan Kelly. That group has now reported and completed its work. It is therefore no longer in existence. I am actively pursuing the rationalisation programme set out in the Public Service Reform Plan with the relevant agencies. The plan sets out those agencies which are scheduled for rationalisation and a number of others which are subject to a critical review which is to be completed by June of this year. Developments so far are that Dundalk Port Company merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, and Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1st January 2012. In addition, a ports policy review is at an advanced stage and I hope to publish a revised policy document in the coming months. Port Company restructuring is one of the issues being considered as part of the policy review. I also recently announced that Dublin Tourism is being merged with its parent body — Failte Ireland — as part of the rationalisation programme. Furthermore, there is a review being undertaken with regard to the future tourism role of Shannon Development and its possible integration into Fáilte Ireland, while Coaching Ireland is being subsumed into the Irish Sports Council. It is intended that legislation will be prepared in 2012 to provide for the merger of the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority in 2013.

17389	SeanSherlock	Labour	14314.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-14 00:00:00	Prelude	597	 An issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.

Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  Non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter and could leave Ireland exposed to damages arising from legal actions based on non-compliance as well as proceedings by the European Commission. A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed Statutory Instrument amending Section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation.  It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with stakeholders with a wide range of views in relation to any issues or concerns that have been raised in relation to the matter. Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works. Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process. This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a Treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered. The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business.  The amended text of the proposed Statutory Instrument was recently published by my Department and it should also be noted that this matter was the subject of a Dail debate on 31st   January 2012.

The information requested by the Deputy on the cost of lump sums, pensions and severance payments for the years between 2008 and the end of February 2012 is set out in Table 1, which follows this reply.  The information provided is available with respect to the former Department of Transport only prior to March 2011.  As the Department does not know at present how many staff will retire from 1 March 2012 to the end of 2015, it is not possible to provide information in respect of this period.  With regard to the loss of the pension levy and superannuation payments, the collation of this information would involve considerable expenditure of time as it would have to be compiled manually for each individual concerned.  The severance payments were as a result of cessation of employment contracts which either reached the end of the contract terms or were as a result of a change in Government.

17399	SeanSherlock	Labour	14321.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-21 00:00:00	Prelude	751	" One of the recommendations arising from the European Science Foundation ""Forward Look, Mathematics and Industry"" publication which I launched in October 2011, was that EU and National funding agencies should coordinate clusters of excellence in industrial mathematics to create a European Institute of Mathematics for Innovation (EIMI). The European Institute, given the complexity with so many groups involved, would be primarily a virtual institute bringing together the wide variety of mathematical expertise across Europe and act as a single point for industry, collaboration and education. Ireland would welcome the opportunity to be part of the EIMI initiative given that, primarily through efforts supported by Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, we have worked hard to develop several groups of scale and top-class quality working in the area of industrial mathematics and computation for industry. Examples of these groups are: MACSI — the Mathematical Applications Consortium for Science and Industry at the University of Limerick, ICHEC — Irish Centre for High-End Computing at NUI Galway and Trinity College Dublin; The 4C group (the Cork Constraint Computation Centre) at UCC; and The Hamilton Institute at NUI Maynooth. Each of these groups has already an excellent track record of success in working with multiple industry partners. Now as part of the evolution of our national research effort and for further enterprise development needs SFI are looking at ways to consolidate our own mathematics groups in this area to fully realise the potential for Irish industry and beyond. Ireland must, if we are to reach our full potential and compete on a global stage, ensure that we foster the development of mathematicians and bring them together with industry to generate progress and innovation. Working in conjunction with a European Institute of Mathematics and Innovation is very much aligned with our policy thinking. Ensuring enhanced mathematical capacity at national level is also underpinned by policy initiatives being delivered through the Department of Education and Skills such as the establishment of the National Centre of Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning, based in the University of Limerick; the introduction of curricula changes such as Project Maths; and the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020, ""Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life""."
17400	SeanSherlock	Labour	14321.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-21 00:00:00	Prelude	763	 The proposed Statutory Instrument is intended to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its obligations under EU law. Several concerns were expressed after the judgment by interested parties.  Accordingly a public consultation was held on the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument.  This consultation was widely publicised at the time and more than 50 submissions were received.  I am extremely grateful to those interested parties, groups and individuals who responded.  Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved.  There was also liaison with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The submissions were carefully considered and legal opinion contained therein was referred to the Office of the Attorney General.  I also met with several organisations with specific interests. The matter was debated in the Dáil on 31st   January 2012. I made it clear then that any injunction under the proposed amendment of the Copyright Act 2000 would have to be considered in the context of the pronouncements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in judgments connected with this area. These judgments (particularly Sabam v Scarlet and Sabam v Netlog)  held that the protection of the fundamental right to intellectual property must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental rights of others who would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  These rights include the right to conduct a business, to privacy, to freedom to receive and impart information.  In addition, any measures proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly. Since the Lisbon Treaty, any legislation upholding EU law is bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. As the nature of injunctions which may be sought is infinitely varied, I consider that the best protection for balancing all the rights involved will be obtained by a careful scrutiny on a case-by-case basis of the competing interests by means of judicial process.

17403	SeanSherlock	Labour	14322.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	901	 An issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Coyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunctiont against an intermediary in relation to transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Article 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  Non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter and could leave Ireland exposed to damages arising from legal actions based on non-compliance as well as proceedings by the European Commission. A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed statutory instrument amending section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation.  It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with stakeholders with a wide range of views in relation to any issues or concerns that have been raised in relation to the matter. Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works.  Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process.  This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business. The amended text of the proposed statutory instrument was recently published by my Department and it should also be noted that this matter was the subject of a Dáil debate on 31 January 2012.
17404	SeanSherlock	Labour	14322.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	901	 Under EU law and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended, existing public service obligation (PSO) bus services can be procured by the National Transport Authority (NTA) through direct award contracts and any other new subvented services must be procured by way of open tendering. At the expiry of the current 5 year direct award contracts for the provision of PSO services with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann the NTA have discretion to renew, modify or terminate the direct award provision of bus services following a consultation process with interested parties under which the NTA is obliged to justify its approach. In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government to explore the benefit to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision, I will be consulting with my Ministerial colleagues soon on the future options for procurement of PSO bus services. 
17405	SeanSherlock	Labour	14328.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-28 00:00:00	Prelude	723	 The proposed Statutory Instrument is intended to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC. The wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument only allows a right holder to apply for an injunction in respect of a particular work.  It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  It should be noted that the EU Copyright Directive only directs that an injunction may be applied for — it does not mandate that it should be granted.  It is also important to note that the granting of injunctions is not an automatic procedure. Injunctions involve a judicial process before the High Court. Copyright must be balanced in that process by a consideration of the other rights involved, e.g. protection of private data, freedom of expression and information, the right to conduct a business.  Any remedy must be proportionate.  This is also spelt out in the draft Statutory Instrument when it is explicitly laid down that the rights of any person (including businesses) likely to be affected, must be given due regard when the court is deliberating on the granting of an injunction. In other words, before granting any such injunction, a court will have to take into account the fact that blocking access to a website could involve damage to the owners of the legal content on that website.  The court must ensure any remedy is not contrary to the right of information or freedom of expression and that any measures proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly. Any injunction under the proposed amendment of the Copyright Act 2000 would have to be considered in the context of the pronouncements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in judgments connected with this area. These judgments (particularly Sabam v Scarlet and Sabam v Netlog) held that the protection of the fundamental right to intellectual property must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental rights of others who would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  These rights include the right to conduct a business, to privacy, to freedom to receive and impart information and reiterated that any remedy proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly.

17407	SeanSherlock	Labour	14328.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-28 00:00:00	Prelude	735	" The European Commission's Innovation Union Scoreboard, published earlier this month, shows Ireland retaining its position among those Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. The scoreboard shows that Ireland has strengths in a number of areas including Human Resources, open, excellent and attractive research systems, and economic effects, which include employment in knowledge intensive activities and knowledge intensive service exports. It also identifies a number of areas where Ireland's performance is below the EU average, including R&D expenditure in the Government and Higher Education sector, venture capital investment, innovative SME collaborations and SMEs introducing product or process innovations.  However, within some of the areas of relative weakness Ireland is performing above the EU average. For example, while we are below average in ""innovative SMEs collaborating with others"" and ""public and private scientific co-publications"" we are above average on ""SMEs collaborating in-house"". Innovation is an integral part of overall economic policy and is central to the Government's reform agenda — this is best illustrated in the recently published Action Plan for Jobs which contains a myriad of initiatives to support broad based innovation. The overall objective of the Action Plan for Jobs is to get the economy back on the right path to sustainable, exporting, innovative and enterprise led growth. It engages every Government Department and over 35 Agencies and Offices and will be monitored on a quarterly basis. A key objective of the Plan is to use research and innovation to build competitive advantage. A number of specific initiatives will deliver on this objective. The majority of public research funding will be aligned with priority areas where we are most likely to get economic returns and monitoring systems will be put in place to measure the impact of funding. This initiative was approved by Cabinet last week and the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, which is informing this prioritisation process, will be published tomorrow.  A key economic goal in this process will be a significantly enhanced focus on collaborative research with enterprise and on commercialisation by growing the number of researchers in enterprise and enhancing the flow of researchers between academia and enterprise. Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver world class research in third level institutions linked to Irish enterprises. Industry and academia collaborations have now reached 800 linkages across 500 companies.  The remit of Science Foundation Ireland will be extended to include applied research, in addition to its existing remit covering oriented basic research, thereby enhancing the focus on commercialisation. SFI's funding will include support for Research Centres to enable them to build scale and world class in a sustainable way that fully underpins the development of industry in Ireland and the commercialisation of Irish research. IDA will continue their strategy of attracting high quality FDI projects to Ireland and more firmly embed existing FDI companies with a strong emphasis on RDI — in 2011 IDA approvals for RDI stood at €700million representing an increase of 40% from 2010. The Department of Finance is also implementing, via the Finance Bill 2012, the R&D tax credit improvements announced in the budget which will help all companies and support research and innovation generally.  This year, my Department will provide €140m to Enterprise Ireland (EI) to ensure the continued growth in the capacity in indigenous Irish companies to develop innovative and cutting-edge products, processes and services. Enterprise Ireland will expand their in-company innovation capability and host a Big Ideas Showcase in 2012 to focus on securing investment and identifying business partners that will bring new technologies to the next stage of commercialisation.  New Technology Centres in Cloud Computing, Learning Technologies and Financial Services will be established and preparatory work will begin on others relevant to the prioritisation exercise mentioned already.  EI will also develop and pilot, in the South East, an innovation Graduates Programme managed in conjunction with the Institutes of Technology and open a call under the Innovation Voucher Scheme specifically focused on design and branding activities for SMEs, with Third Level Institutes as providers.  A second call will be launched under Innovation Fund Ireland to attract significant venture capital players to Ireland. In the area of Intellectual Property (IP) a new Protocol is being developed to manage IP arising from state funded research and a feasibility study is underway to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in IP. Public Procurement is also being used as a lever for innovation.  My Department is working with Enterprise Ireland and others to develop a Procuring Innovation Initiative to increase purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to needs rather than specific products or services. My Department is working with the Department of Health and relevant State Agencies to develop a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and enterprise leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies.  There are also a number of initiatives being taken to support innovation in sectors including the Green Economy, Agri-Food, ICT, Cloud Computing, Retail and Wholesale. Innovation is cross-cutting and requires a broad based approach. The breadth of initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs to support innovation is a testament to the Government's commitment to delivering innovation policy to support our economic recovery."

17411	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	389	 Supports to business by successive Governments over many years have focused on supporting viable businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors, where the benefits to the economy of such supports significantly exceed their cost.  In continuing that approach, this Government's objective is to facilitate the creation and maintenance of the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the economy by improving the operating environment for business and focusing on companies that demonstrate growth potential. The Action Plan for Jobs 2012, which was published on 13 February, sets out a range of measures which are designed to support new business start-ups, improve enterprise competitiveness and help firms to grow.  Small and medium enterprises will benefit in particular from measures in the action plan.  These include the establishment of a new one–stop–shop structure for micro-enterprise support.  Also included is the roll-out of the micro-finance fund for small new start-ups.   The fund will go live following the finalisation of its delivery structures and the scheme's approval by the European Investment Fund. Another measure is the introduction of a new temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, which will address the problem of access to finance for viable SMEs that do not meet the normal lending criteria of the banks.  This scheme will go live as soon as possible following the enactment of primary legislation in Quarter 2 of 2012.  Other measures include the expansion of mentoring schemes, particularly between multinational companies and SMEs, and measures to improve access to public procurement opportunities for SMEs. In addition, the south east action plan, which was launched by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on 2 December last, contains specific actions to address the unemployment problems affecting the south east.  The plan identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition of having a stronger local enterprise base.  There are challenges for all agencies in the region to help build up the region's competitive advantage and then to promote it in a co-ordinated manner. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is part of a wider, whole-of-Government response to the jobs crisis, which includes the recently published plan for labour market activation, Pathways to Work.  Both documents are fundamentally linked and recognise the need to reform our policies and structures to secure long-term and lasting results for our enterprise base and for job-seekers. The action plan sets out over 270 measures to be implemented this year to support job creation.  Pathways to Work will reform the public employment services and the further education and training services to facilitate people to access the job opportunities that become available.  Under the Pathways to Work approach, over 85,000 job experience and work placements will be made available by the Department of Social Protection this year, with a further 457,000 training and education places available through the Department of Education and Skills.  These initiatives will impact positively on all regions of the country.
17412	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	391	 I take the point the Deputy is raising.  We are being imaginative in ensuring there is a micro-finance fund for small businesses.  The new partial credit guarantee scheme is designed to help the SME sector.  If one talks about the direct subsidisation of a business - I take the point made by the Deputy on the encouragement or retention of employment within existing businesses - one must be mindful of the consequences.  Where there are two companies trading in the same sector, one thriving and the other not, and one supports directly the one that is not thriving, one must realise there are permutations regarding State aid rules on direct subsidisation.  We are, therefore, seeking to create the types of programmes to which all businesses will be able to subscribe, such that we can try to retain employment. In the two types of businesses to which the Deputy alludes, the phenomenon he described could be seen a consequence of a direct drop in consumer demand, which is having a major impact.  We must also factor that into the equation.  The Deputy's point is well made but we are trying to address the problem through programme supports and direct-credit supports for companies that are thriving and will survive.
17413	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	393	 To be fair and objective about this, we are thinking outside the box.  Research and development tax credits will encourage greater business growth.
17414	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	395	 The Revenue job assist scheme will also help, while PRSI programmes entice employers to retain employees and there is a tax break for that purpose.  On the demand and supply side we are trying to encourage companies to retain people in jobs.  It is an extremely difficult thing to do because one must adhere to State-aid rules in doing so.  We have been imaginative in trying to get people back into the work force through labour market activation measures, including the pathways to work scheme.  We will stay on that course.  The essential point in the Deputy's question concerned a direct subsidy to individual businesses.  We are trying to take a more imaginative view on that by putting in place the temporary credit guarantee scheme and the micro-finance fund.  In addition, we are encouraging employers through tax breaks and PRSI credits.  That is the way to stimulate growth.
17415	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	401	 The seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development, also known as FP7, with a budget of €55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts. The framework programme enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe, as well as deriving the benefits associated with collaborative research.  This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks and specialist equipment, sharing costs and risks, and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities. The total funding secured by companies based in Ireland since the commencement of the seventh framework programme in 2007 - to November 2011, the latest figures available - is €87.8 million.  The figure for 2011 was €25 million and the corresponding target for 2012 is €30 million.  Of the €87.8 million secured by companies based in Ireland, €66.4 million went to SMEs and €21.4 million went to multinationals based in Ireland. The European Commission's fourth monitoring report on FP7, covering the years 2007 to 2010 and published in August 2011, states that, in one of the main funding programmes within FP7, Ireland has the highest participation rate of SMEs of the EU 27.   This is the rate of SME participation in FP7 compared to the population of SMEs in the country.  The national target for drawdown by Ireland from FP7 over the seven-year period, for both industry and research institutions, is €600 million.  To date, Ireland has secured €362 million under FP7 since it commenced in 2007.  We are on track to reach our national target of €600 million when the programme ends in 2013. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, CIP, which runs from 2007 to 2013, and which has a budget of €3.6 billion.  Unlike FP7, funding under the CIP does not go directly to companies; almost 50% of the funding is via European Investment Fund, EIF, guarantees which are provided to financial intermediaries, and the remainder is used to fund actions such as best practice exchanges and provision of information networks through the Enterprise Europe Network.
17416	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	403	 Truthfully, it is not possible to say how many jobs have been created as a result of this programme.  It is important to note the number of successful applications in the SME sector is over 1,000 while in the multinational sector, it was 270.  In the SME sector, we have taken in over €66 million in funding with €21 million in the multinational sector. While it does not answer the Deputy's questions directly, it does signify the scheme is supporting existing jobs.  The criteria set down for adherence to the programme is one of excellence in terms of the research industry and academic collaboration. The key message in my reply is that if we hit the €600 million target for the current framework programme, it would be an extremely good result.  Moving into the new framework programme for 2020 which has a potential pot of €85 billion, I am ambitious for this country that we would hit or surpass the €600 million target.  That will benefit existing employment and create further jobs.
17417	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	584	 The European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 have today been signed and simultaneously I have launched the next stage of the Copyright Review Committee review of Ireland's copyright legislation, aimed at removing barriers to innovation.  I acknowledge the desire of some interested parties that this instrument be more detailed and more prescriptive. However the High Court now has significant guidance from the European Court of Justice on the implementation of the measure, and will have to ensure any remedy provided will uphold the following principles: Freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs; The absolute requirement that an ISP cannot be required to carry out general monitoring on the information it carries on its network; Any measures must be fair and proportionate and not be unnecessarily complicated or costly; The fundamental rights of an ISPs' customers must be respected, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information. I believe that in Ireland we must build on our very substantial achievements in the creative and digital media industries, and become a model of international best practice for innovation in this area. Ireland is home to some of the world's most innovative internet companies, and we are determined to grow our reputation as a location where smart people and smart companies can innovate in this fast-moving arena. It was necessary for us to proceed to sign this Statutory Instrument in order to ensure compliance with our obligations under EU law. The intended purpose of the proposed Statutory Instrument is not to enact new EU legislation but rather it seeks to merely restate the position that was thought to exist within the copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton's judgement here and in all EU Member States.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the introduction of this measure by way of Statutory Instrument is not inconsistent with the legislative policy outlined in the Programme for Government. As there are clearly many diverse interests, it is important that interested parties come together and work in a constructive way to map the path forward. For this reason I am particularly anxious that the consultation paper launched today is studied and comprehensively responded to by all interested parties.  The challenge now is to examine what measures we can take to develop Ireland's laws in this area in such a way as to provide the greatest possible encouragement for innovation in the creative and digital industries to take place here. This is a very complex area of law, which affects industries that are developing rapidly and where the interests of many diverse and changing parties interact with each other. My ambition to make Ireland a model of international best practice in this area will not be easily achieved, and as this debate develops I urge all interested parties on all sides to come together and work in a constructive and realistic way to the benefit of all. In that context, I am committed to reviewing and updating the Copyright legislation currently in place in order to strike the correct balance between encouraging innovation and protecting creativity. This paper has been prepared by the Copyright Review Committee in response to submissions received and public engagement. I urge all interested parties, including information providers and ISPs, innovators, rights-holders, consumers and end-users, to study it carefully and engage in a constructive debate on all the issues. This is a valuable opportunity for all interested parties to express their views and to make a meaningful contribution towards shaping the future development of Irish copyright law. I am confident that the work being carried out by the Copyright Review Committee, with the interaction and input of the interested parties, will result in establishing Irish copyright law on a firm footing to encourage innovation, foster creativity and meet the challenges of the future with confidence. The independent Copyright Review Committee was established on 9th May, 2011: to examine the present national Copyright legislation and identifying any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation; to identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation; to examine the US style ‘fair use' doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context; and if it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by EU Directives on copyright and other international obligations), make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting and promoting and facilitating innovation. The membership of the independent Committee is Dr. Eoin O'Dell (Trinity College Dublin) (Chair), Patricia McGovern (DFMG Solicitors, Dublin), and Prof. Steve Hedley (University College Cork).
17418	SeanSherlock	Labour	14329.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-29 00:00:00	Prelude	597	 The Taskforce's recommendations outlined a whole of Government approach to realising an important strand of Ireland's economic recovery and made a wide range of recommendations in areas such as intellectual property, venture capital, the higher education system, procurement, convergence, sectoral issues, taxation, enterprise agency supports and structures, broadband infrastructure, marketing and implementation. There were 26 Key Recommendations and 63 Supporting Recommendations in the Innovation Taskforce Report. Of the 26 Key recommendations, 12 have been implemented, 9 are to be implemented, in full or in part, and finally 5 will not be implemented. In the main, the unimplemented items are recommendations regarding tax allowances or are concepts requiring significant further analysis to become implementable proposals — many of them give rise to substantial additional investment costs or to revenue foregone. Significant recommendations implemented include putting into place the €500 million Innovation Fund-Ireland to target the development of a vibrant venture capital community in Ireland through attracting top international venture capitalists. Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) was launched. Moreover, funding for a number of ITF recommendations in the budgetary process to 2016 were secured, enabling my Department and its agencies to support innovative companies, grow the number of high potential start-up companies, provide more venture capital and develop a portfolio of sector specific Angel Funds and increase Enterprise Ireland supports for commercialisation. They also enable the retention of a strategic mass of world class researchers who act as a pull factor for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland. Furthermore, increased funding was secured for the R&D activities of Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the context of Budget 2011 and Budget 2012 to enable Ireland to retain the science base built over the past decade, attract further R&D FDI, strengthen collaborations between researchers and enterprise, provide additional company R&D grants, and ensure the best use is made of research with commercial and market potential. The ITF recommendation to introduce incentives to encourage greater take up of higher level maths has been implemented by the introduction of a scheme of bonus points for students who sit higher level maths. The scheme is to be introduced for a four year pilot period commencing Leaving Certificate 2012 and will be reviewed in 2014. This initiative complements the recommendation to roll out Project Maths — an initiative designed to place greater emphasis on the understanding of mathematical concepts and the application of mathematical knowledge and skill — which is also being implemented. The Action Plan for Jobs contains a myriad of initiatives to support broad based innovation. The majority of public research funding will be aligned with priority areas where we are most likely to get economic returns and monitoring systems will be put in place to measure the impact of funding. This initiative was approved by Cabinet and published. Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver world class research in third level institutions linked to Irish enterprises. Industry and academia collaborations have now reached 800 linkages across 500 companies. The remit of Science Foundation Ireland will be extended to include applied research, in addition to its existing remit covering oriented basic research, thereby enhancing the focus on commercialisation. SFI's funding will include support for Research Centres to enable them to build scale and world class in a sustainable way that fully underpins the development of industry in Ireland and the commercialisation of Irish research. IDA will continue their strategy of attracting high quality FDI projects to Ireland and more firmly embed existing FDI companies with a strong emphasis on RDI — in 2011 IDA approvals for RDI stood at €700million representing an increase of 40% from 2010. The Department of Finance is also implementing, via the Finance Bill 2012, the R&D tax credit improvements announced in the budget which will help all companies and support research and innovation generally. This year, my Department will provide €140m to Enterprise Ireland (EI) to ensure the continued growth in the capacity in indigenous Irish companies to develop innovative and cutting-edge products, processes and services. Enterprise Ireland will expand their in-company innovation capability and host a Big Ideas Showcase in 2012 to focus on securing investment and identifying business partners that will bring new technologies to the next stage of commercialisation. New Technology Centres in Cloud Computing, Learning Technologies and Financial Services will be established and preparatory work will begin on others relevant to the prioritisation exercise mentioned already. EI will also develop and pilot, in the South East, an innovation Graduates Programme managed in conjunction with the Institutes of Technology and open a call under the Innovation Voucher Scheme specifically focussed on design and branding activities for SMEs, with Third Level Institutes as providers. A second call will be launched under Innovation Fund Ireland to attract significant venture capital players to Ireland. In the area of Intellectual Property(IP) a new Protocol is being developed to manage IP arising from state funded research. Separately a feasibility study is under way to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in IP. Public Procurement is also being used as  a lever for innovation. My Department is working with Enterprise Ireland and others to develop a Procuring Innovation Initiative to increase purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to needs rather than specific products or services. My Department is working with the Department of Health and relevant State Agencies to develop a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and enterprise leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies. There are also a number of initiatives being taken to support innovation in sectors including the Green Economy, Agri-Food, ICT, Cloud Computing, Retail and Wholesale. Innovation is cross-cutting and requires a broad based approach. The breadth of initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs to support innovation is a testament to the Government's commitment to delivering innovation policy to support our economic recovery.

17436	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	453	 I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this issue.  As the Deputy is aware 10,575 special needs assistant posts are available for allocation to schools for the 2012-13 school year.  This is the same number of posts available for allocation in the current school year.  Therefore, there has been no reduction in the overall number of SNA posts available for allocation in the coming school year.  The Government has maintained funding for special education and for SNA support at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure savings in range of areas.  With equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources it is considered that there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care and support to attend school in accordance with departmental criteria. Through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, the National Council for Special Education is responsible for allocating special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support and this includes a requirement for it to have regard to the overall cap on numbers.  In the context of the overall limit on the number of SNA posts available, it is necessary for the NCSE to prioritise applications and to distribute SNA resources equitably and efficiently throughout all schools.  One of the priority criteria applied in the allocation of SNA posts is to ensure that the minimum SNA to special class ratio is maintained in special schools and special classes. In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, a special school for children with autism, I understand it has an enrolment of 24 pupils at present with staffing of one principal and five mainstream class teachers as well as 16 SNAs.  This is a total of 22 staff catering for the needs of 24 pupils and equates to an SNA to pupil ratio of 1:1.5 and an overall adult to pupil ratio of 1:1.1.  This is an exceptionally high level of support and is considerably in excess of the current recommended SNA ratio for special class groups, including children with autism spectrum disorder, as outlined in the Department of Education and Skills circular 0038/10, that is to say, a ratio of two SNAs per special class group of six children. The NCSE has advised all schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending each school.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2012-13 school year by 16 March 2012.  They will be advised of their allocation for the 2012-13 school year by late May or early June 2012 based on the number of valid applications received by 16 March.  Therefore, no final SNA allocation for 2012-13 has been made for this school yet.  Whereas the NCSE has indicated to the school that based on its current pupil numbers it has four surplus SNA posts, until any applications for potential new entrants for the 2012-13 school year are considered no final determination will be made.  I understand the NCSE is due to meet representatives of the school shortly to discuss staffing requirements for the coming school year.  The NCSE will advise the school by late May or early June of its SNA allocation for the 2012-13 school year.
17437	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	455	 I thoroughly respect the fact that the Deputy must advocate for the school in his constituency and I do not doubt the veracity of the case made by him in respect of the school and the good work it carries out.  However, the Deputy has admitted an overall cap is in place.  A process is under way in respect of SNA allocation and we should have regard to this fact.  The Deputy's claim that this a callous decision must be tackled in the sense that the overall budget within the Department of Education and Skills has been reduced and we must ask ourselves why we have come to this stage.  I take the point made by the Deputy but given that it is a special junior primary school I am hopeful that the National Council for Special Education will have regard to this fact and a process is under way. The allocation of SNAs to schools changes over time and we should acknowledge this.  Children may have diminishing care needs over time.  Some children leave school at the end of each school year and the pupil population of a school may change over time.  It is important to note that the SNA allocation process for the 2012-13 school year is still under way.  Schools have been advised to make applications by 16 March and they will be advised of their SNA allocation by late May.  The case is well made by the Deputy and I hope the NCSE will have regard to this during its deliberations.
17438	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	457	 I thank Deputy Dowds for raising this matter and for the opportunity to respond. Stobart Ireland is part of the Stobart Group which, I understand, operates from over 40 sites across the UK and Europe.  Stobart Ireland began operating in 2008 winning the transport services contract with Tesco in 2010 to distribute all of the products it keeps at depots at Ballymun and Donabate in Dublin.  On 15 February last, SIPTU announced that following a ballot of its members, Stobart drivers had voted to strike over concerns about their working conditions and served notice of industrial action.  Stobart Ireland drivers subsequently carried out a 36-hour work stoppage on Thursday and Friday, 23 and 24 February.  I understand that a picket by drivers was held at the company's main Irish depot in Ballymun, Dublin on Thursday from 6.00 p.m. until 11.30 p.m. Rest time, rosters and general working conditions have been identified by SIPTU as the factors that led to the decision to strike.  SIPTU maintains that these grievances had been put before the company for some time but the company failed to address the issues.  It appears that Stobart Ireland responded to the threat of industrial action by taking the unusual step of initiating its own ballot of drivers.  The company claimed that its ballot showed that only a minority backed industrial action.  It claimed that the outcome demonstrated a lack of support for the planned strike and called on the union to cease its industrial action.  SIPTU described the company ballot as a coercive tactic and denied that the outcome of the company ballot could be deemed to articulate the clear voice of the majority of workers in the driver category. I understand that Stobart Ireland had initially welcomed the suggestion to attend the Labour Relations Commission on the eve of the industrial action.  The company requested that the threat of strike action be lifted as a condition of its willingness to engage with the industrial relations dispute services.  However, as the industrial action proceeded as planned, the company declined to engage in conciliation talks.  According to reports, the company had flown in 40 agency drivers from the UK to replace the striking workers.  SIPTU has claimed that the drivers flown in were not informed of the background to the dispute in Dublin before they arrived.  It appears that the company did not proceed, however, to deploy the replacement drivers. I understand that the Labour Relations Commission is maintaining contact with both parties to the dispute and will continue to remain available to assist in trying to resolve the issues in dispute.  I would urge the parties to agree to avail of the services of the State's industrial relations machinery and to engage fully in the process.  I urge them to put their difficulties and differences behind them and approach the process in good faith and with a view to accepting the outcome of the process. Ireland's system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  The Labour Relations Commission has extensive experience in assisting parties to resolve issues of rest time, rosters and other general working conditions and in achieving a high rate of mutually acceptable settlements on such issues.  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice. Stobart Ireland is an extremely big company with a large footprint across Ireland.  I am aware of it from personal experience on the roads between Cork and Dublin where I have noticed an exceptionally high presence of Stobart trucks.  I contend that we have a highly evolved labour relations infrastructure in this country and we would ask companies to engage in corporate social responsibility and come a bit of the road towards meeting needs that will ensure drivers can operate safely.  We would urge all companies that win contracts in Ireland to engage constructively with the State machinery set up for dispute resolution.  If we can achieve that, I am hopeful some compromise can be hammered out through the labour relations machinery that exists in this country.
17439	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	460	 I take the Deputy's point.  In response, I contend that the legitimacy of the Labour Relations Commission, which has opened its doors to facilitate a process, is one the State, Irish workers and most employers buy into.  That is the right way to proceed on this issue.  I hope the Stobart organisation will have due regard to that process.
17440	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	462	 Deputy Dowds is more schooled on that.  There is legislation to protect every worker's rights and in respect of dispute resolution.  It is voluntary by nature, but we must be fair and balanced in how we approach the issue and I would hope any reasonable company, or any entity, would use the voluntary mechanism that is available.  That is the way to proceed.  If that fails, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.
17441	SeanSherlock	Labour	14342.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Prelude	682	 As the Deputy is aware it is prohibited under existing legislation within the State to illegally hack into the wireless internet of a third party.  It is a matter for the Garda Síochána to investigate and prosecute any such illegal activity involving the illegal hacking into a third parties' wireless internet. Access to the internet is normally the subject of a contract between an individual (or entity) and an Internet Service Provider.  Any issues arising between the parties regarding this access should in the first instance be dealt with in the normal course of their business agreement.

17451	SeanSherlock	Labour	14350.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	554	 I will provide the Deputy with a list of all the written representations made to me and to Minister Bruton regarding S.I. No. 59 of 2012, the European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012.  It should be noted that this information has recently been released by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation following a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1997.

In the circumstance, I have forwarded your correspondence to the NTA for its attention and direct reply. If you do not receive a reply within ten working days please notify my private office.
17453	SeanSherlock	Labour	14356.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	791	 As the Deputy is aware, Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is a tool used by Government Departments and Offices for the structured exploration of different options to address particular policy issues and it is used where one or more of these options is new regulation or a regulatory change.  This process helps to identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with new regulation and to quantify the likely costs of compliance on the individual citizen or business. The European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 (i.e. S.I. No. 59 of 2012) was enacted to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in the case of EMI Ireland and others versus UPC in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.   It is important to note that there was no policy or regulatory change put forward in this Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the aforementioned High Court judgment .  The purpose of the Statutory Instrument was not to implement new EU legislation but rather it has been introduced to merely restate the position that was thought to exist within the copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton’s judgement here and in all EU Member States.
17454	SeanSherlock	Labour	14356.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	792	 I wish to inform the Deputy that the staff at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are aware of the United States of America special report 301, which is an annual review of the global state of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement, conducted by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. As the Deputy is aware, counterfeiting and piracy are now serious problems which undermine legitimate trade and the sustainable development of the world economy.  The growth of illegal trade requires international cooperation regarding tackling this serious development. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is also fully aware of the current trends in the infringement of intellectual property rights and to that end is currently involved in a number of initiatives to strengthen intellectual property rights protection and enforcement, both at EU level and international level. The Department participates in the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights and is currently involved in a number of EU legislative proposals in this area such as: the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on entrusting the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) with tasks related to the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including the assembling of public and private sector representatives as a European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights; the   review of the Enforcement Directive 2004/48/EC; and the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights.

17459	SeanSherlock	Labour	14357.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	387	 I thank Deputies Nash, Terence Flanagan and Kirk for raising this matter.  This is the second time in the space of a year that Vodafone and its operations have become the subject of a Topical Issue Debate in this House. I am very conscious of the anxiety that the proposed transfer of the 290 agency posts and 27 direct Vodafone posts to Teleperformance creates for the workers and their families, as well as the local communities. Vodafone Ireland announced on Thursday, 22 March that it had completed a review of the company's current contracted mobile call-centre operations.  The company has stated that following this review, it will be adopting a new model for its mobile customer care, resulting in a move to a new provider, Teleperformance, which is headquartered in Newry.  Rigney Dolphin was the previous provider of this service at Vodafone's offices in Dundalk.  I am informed that Teleperformance currently provides a variety of care and support services to the Vodafone Group in a range of other markets, including the UK.  I understand that this change has arisen out of Vodafone's ongoing review of customer care.  As part of the changes, 27 Vodafone roles and 290 contract roles currently provided by Rigney Dolphin, will transfer to Teleperformance.  I am informed that the transfer will be under a transfer of undertakings, protection of employment arrangement.  I understand that Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin are currently entering a six-week consultation process with employee representatives, prior to the new arrangements taking effect. and that at the end of this period, Vodafone envisages there will be a direct transfer to Teleperformance of these employees within their current roles.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this point.  Rigney Dolphin will remain a provider to Vodafone Ireland for its call centre sales and fixed care functions.  I hope that the parties concerned will use this period to ensure there is meaningful dialogue about the company's proposals. It is a core priority of the Government to retain and create the maximum number of jobs in the State.  I would strongly encourage the parties in this case to explore to the fullest extent, whatever possibilities remain to retain jobs in the State.  If there is anything that the Government or its agencies can meaningfully do to assist in this regard, there will be no hesitation on our part.  Notwithstanding the ongoing efforts on minimising the impact of the Vodafone decision, I wish to assure the House that the State enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and Louth County Enterprise Board, will continue to make every effort possible to develop new employee opportunities for Dundalk.
17460	SeanSherlock	Labour	14357.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	391	 A number of issues have been raised.  I have no problem in principle with the Members from counties Louth and Dublin seeking a meeting with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, about this matter.  In the first instance, there are national and strategic issues in regard to the precarious nature of call centre jobs.  There is the issue of the transfer of undertakings from one company to another operating on behalf of Vodafone - as a global corporate entity, one might say.  There is the issue of corporate social responsibility and there is the actual worry people have.  Deputy Kirk referred to Mr. Pickering and whether the issue of mobility arises in his particular circumstances. I will relay this message to the Minister.  My instinct is that if the Members present who have a concern were to seek a meeting with him these issues might be teased out further.
17461	SeanSherlock	Labour	14357.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	395	 If the Members present who raised the issue are willing to meet the Minister, I will make that request of him.  Let us see where we go from there.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle.

17465	SeanSherlock	Labour	14358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	543	 The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton T.D established the Copyright Review Committee on 9th May, 2011 to examine the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified.  The Review will ultimately present a Report with a set of recommendations for legislative change. The Copyright Review Committee was established with the following terms of reference: 1. Examine the present national Copyright legislation and identify any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation. 2. Identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation. 3. Examine the US style ‘fair use' doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context. 4. If it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended, (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by the European Communities Directives on Copyright and Related Rights and other international obligations) make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting creativity and promoting and facilitating innovation. The membership of the independent Committee is Dr. Eoin O’Dell (Trinity College Dublin), (Chair), Patricia McGovern (DFMG Solicitors, Dublin) and Prof. Steve Hedley (University College, Cork). The Committee conducted an initial consultation process during the summer of 2011 and received over 100 submissions from interested parties.  The Committee held a well-attended and particularly fruitful public meeting on 4th July 2011 in Trinity College Dublin. The Committee issued a Consultation Paper on 29th February, 2012 which sets out the issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in the aforementioned submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties.  The Committee explores various options to address these concerns in the light of the Terms of Reference and the Paper also poses questions on these matters. The Committee has established a further consultation process based on the issues and concerns addressed in the Consultation Paper and are inviting further submissions from all affected or concerned by the issues raised in the Paper including information providers and ISPs, innovators, rightsholders, consumers and end-users.  The Committee also held a further public meeting on 24th March, 2012 for the purpose of facilitating discussion in relation to the issues raised in the Consultation Paper.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions is 5.00 pm on Thursday 31st May 2012.  The Committee will then evaluate the further submissions and prepare a Final Report. The Committee now has a dedicated website at http://www.djei.ie/science/ipr/crc.htm   and it will be directly linked from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation’s homepage until the Review process is complete.  The Committee’s site provides information regarding the various ways to participate in the consultation process.  As well as by post and email, the Committee has prepared an online questionnaire [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CRC12] to reply to the questions they pose in the Consultation Paper.  It is available from the Committee’s website. The Irish Internet Association have also provided a mechanism for online submissions to collate its members' views and to gather the views of others on the Paper, using a structured mechanism for feedback.  All stakeholders are welcome to complete the questionnaire and responses will be sent directly to the department upon closing of the survey.  The questionnaire is available on the Irish Internet Association website at [http://www.iia.ie/feedback/]. The Minister wishes to inform the Deputy that the Copyright Review Committee are an independent body and therefore, it would not be appropriate for him to comment at this juncture on any issues which are being considered by the Committee in the context of their ongoing review of the legislation. However, the Minister would like to call on all interested parties to engage fully with the ongoing work of the Copyright Review Committee and strongly encourages all those interested in these matters to give careful study to the Consultation Paper and to put forward their views to the Copyright Review Committee.

17468	SeanSherlock	Labour	14378.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	452	" I welcome the announcement by Mylan Incorporated of 220 jobs in the Gaeltacht in Connemara.  This is a testament to the hard work that has been done by the Government in spite of the awful economic morass in which we find ourselves as a result of the previous speaker's Government's actions.  In spite of that economic morass in which we find ourselves, we are still winning new business and new investments and we are, in spite of the economic constraints, sending out signals to the business community that Ireland is open for business and that we are, against the head, doing our very best to restore that economic sovereignty that was lost through the actions of the previous speaker and the Government of which he was a Cabinet member. For the record of this House and for any historical purposes, Deputy Ó Cuív was a Cabinet Minister in the previous Government that brought this country to its knees.  When I listen to the revisionist rubbish coming from that gentlemen's mouth, it would make the hair stand on the back of one's neck.  It is an absolute disgrace that anybody who was a Cabinet Minister in the previous Government would come in here and seek to lecture any other Member on this side of the House about where he perceives that we are going wrong in terms of the path that we are on to try to restore our economic sovereignty. When I listen to his words, I must say that they are quite confused.  I did not understand one iota of what he was saying.  He contradicted himself when he stated that nobody understands this treaty and then, in another sentence, that the treaty does not go far enough.  It was contradictory verbiage.  It is time that he was called on the bluff and bluster that we have heard from him these past few months.  It behoves us, as parliamentarians, to speak responsibly when we come into this House.  We all are prone to oratorical flourishes.  I do not exclude myself from that process, but I think we endeavour to speak the truth. Ratification of this treaty is fundamental to Ireland's recovery.  The instability that has plagued the euro has been a destabilising feature of the EU polity and one which has diminished our stature as a continent in hegemonic terms. The euro is our currency.  It is Ireland's currency and the treaty is about bringing stability to the entire eurozone.  As a small open economy subject to the vagaries of global economic shifts, Ireland's national interest is best served by our continuation as a member of this currency.  Irish ratification of the treaty would further enhance growing international confidence in our ongoing recovery.  We are on target to reduce our budget deficit to under 3% by 2015 and our exports are growing strongly. Nobody would claim that the treaty is the sole answer to Europe's economic problems, but it is a crucial part of a wider package of necessary measures.  The treaty must be accompanied by more action to achieve growth and jobs, particularly at EU level.  Membership of a strong stable euro is vital for the development of the economy.  Achieving a European investment programme for growth and jobs should be a European aspiration and one that is best served by co-operation with our eurozone partners.  I reiterate that, only today, Mylan Incorporated announced more than 220 new positions in addition to the existing operations in Ireland.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that investments such as this continue in the future. Ratification of this treaty will help to ensure that Ireland is seen as a safe place to do business.  Any claim that rejecting the treaty will mean no more difficult decisions are required is patently false and disingenuous.  There have been claims from members of the Opposition that this treaty will lead to further austerity and hardship for the Irish people.  To those who call this an austerity treaty I say this.  It is a falsehood to create a narrative that implicitly suggests that voting ""No"" means ending fiscal consolidation.  The simple fact is that we, as a sovereign Government, must stabilise our public finances.  That is a moral imperative.  It is a moral imperative to ensure that future generations are left a half decent legacy with which to live.  A debt to GDP ratio of more than 90% damages growth and Ireland's debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at approximately 118% this year.  We take in only €7 million for each €10 million spent.  We borrow €44 million daily to run the country.  That is equivalent to France borrowing almost €600 million a day.  This simply is not sustainable and we cannot afford to leave that burden to future generations. In Ireland's case, the stability treaty requires us to do no more than we are already doing to rebalance the public finances.  The treaty does not prevent investment.  What it does is ensure we have sustainable finances, balanced budgets, or budgets in surplus in good times and no unsustainable deficits in recessionary times.  Investment is perfectly possible in these circumstances.  That is a classical Keynesian theory. Keynes' theory has been misinterpreted by some to suit some political narratives.  Keynes is not simply about stimulus packages that never need to be paid for.  The economist, Seamus Coffey of UCC, recently stated that had the treaty and the wider package of measures now being considered through closer macroeconomic surveillance been in place over the past decade, Ireland's economic crash would probably have been less severe and we probably would not have needed a bailout in 2010.  Those who oppose this treaty in Ireland never state where Ireland will get the funding for a stimulus package.  They only offer slogans about taxing the rich, and yet refuse to back initiatives such as a property tax.  They think that Government borrowings do not have to be paid back and that there are no negative consequences to defaulting. There have also been questions around why Ireland needs access to the European Stability Mechanism if the intention is to return to the markets next year.  The Government has every intention of returning to the international lending markets next year.  The existence of the ESM will make this process easier.  The ESM is a safety net and will mean that we will be in a better bargaining position when we are looking for market funding. This treaty will come into effect when 12 eurozone countries ratify it by 1 January 2013 or earlier.  Unlike previous EU treaties, Ireland does not have a veto over this treaty.  The only people affected by an Irish ""No"" would be the Irish people themselves.  Deciding not to ratify this treaty would make Ireland's economic recovery more difficult by, crucially, denying us future access to the ESM.  We are working to ensure no second bailout will be necessary, but the very fact of not having the insurance policy of ESM access could undermine international confidence in our recovery. The Irish Labour Party has long argued that fiscal consolidation must go hand in hand with growth and that one cannot work without the other.  That is why we, with our colleagues in Government, are continually pressing for more growth initiatives in Europe."
17469	SeanSherlock	Labour	14378.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	 The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a network of Technology Research Centres designed to accelerate the exploitation of new technologies and bridge the gap between research and technology commercialisation. Technology centres are public-private research centres of excellence that connect industry to the higher education sector to increase the generation and availability of new, industrially relevant knowledge. The research agenda is driven and led by companies involved in the relevant sectors and leverages the strength of other previous academic research funding provided by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are undertaking preparatory actions, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, through engagement with groups of companies relevant to the three research centres referred to.  These company groups are in the process of defining their research needs and are being facilitated in documenting these needs.  On the basis of a demonstrated industry requirement and demand the research needs identified will be formally submitted for external assessment by the end of June and, subject to the results of this assessment, will form the basis for a call for research provision later in 2012.

17473	SeanSherlock	Labour	14379.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State examinations.  The Minister does not have a role in the selection criteria for the appointment of superintendents of State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission has provided me with the following information.  During the period of the written examinations each June much of the integrity of the examination process depends on the manner in which superintendents perform their assigned tasks.  It is a critical role, one that has been performed with excellence, skill and dedication by thousands of superintendents during the years. Superintendents have a range of important duties during a three week period in June.  These include the safe custody of the examination papers and completed examination scripts and the safe and proper conduct of each day's examinations in line with the rules and procedures laid down by the State Examinations Commission. Some 4,700 superintendents have been appointed by the State Examinations Commission to almost 750 second level schools for the 2012 examinations.  This does not include almost 9,000 superintendents appointed locally by schools, mindful of the specific needs of each individual student, to supervise students with special educational needs.  Typically, examination superintendents are drawn from the pool of unemployed, serving and retired teachers.  They are appointed each year by the State Examinations Commission through public advertisement in the national newspapers, by issuing last year's superintendents with an application form and providing supplies of application forms for all post-primary schools.  Examinations centres can accommodate up to 50 examination candidates. In the main, the State Examinations Commission appoints experienced teachers as examination superintendents.  There is a long-standing policy of appointing unemployed and substitute teachers before drawing on other applicants.  It is considered that teachers' classroom management skills and experience of working with young people are equally required for the effective conduct of the examination superintending duties.  For reasons of examination integrity, superintendents are not assigned to their own school, any school in which they have taught in the previous five years, any centre in which they have a relative sitting an examination or within a 16 km radius of their home address. I hope I have responded adequately to the Deputy's concerns.
17474	SeanSherlock	Labour	14379.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	257	 I have full sympathy for the point made by the Deputy.  While he makes a logical and cogent case, if I am to be honest, we must speak to the independence of the State Examinations Commission in terms of the role of superintendents and so forth.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  The Minister for Education and Skills made statements on the role of retired teachers. I respectfully ask the Deputy to put down a parliamentary question in respect of getting those numbers.  If he would like to communicate with me afterwards, perhaps we can discuss a mechanism by which this issue should be raised with the State Examinations Commission, so as to allow for a situation to exist whereby the person who wrote to the Deputy would at least have some sort of a chance, having applied for five years in a row, if I understand the Deputy correctly.  That throws up a particular scenario which, on the basis of common sense, should be raised as an issue.  There is a public issue involved and I have sympathy with the case the Deputy is making. I will talk to the Minister about this.  If it is an independent commission then there may be issues about how to approach it and the commission's clear and unambiguous role in this.  However, I certainly have sympathy for the view expressed.  I do not see why we cannot have - at the risk of being accused of ageism - younger, part-time teachers taking up these roles on an annual basis.  I will talk to the Deputy afterwards.
17475	SeanSherlock	Labour	14379.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	260	 I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  He says we all agree that savings need to be made.  If he agrees with that premise, then it is not enough to suggest that he change the pupil-teacher ratio without providing an alternative to make savings. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the budgetary measure relating to the staffing of small primary schools, to which I assume he is referring.  There is no scope in this year's departmental budget to reverse this measure or indeed any of the budget measures concerning teacher allocation at second level.  Furthermore, the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million, and €147 million for 2014.  There are no easy solutions to this challenge. The Government has protected education as much as it can.  Far greater reductions in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools, but there are limits on the number of teaching posts we can afford.  In the case of primary schools, there is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level.  However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  As part of the budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or fewer classroom teachers with enrolments of fewer than 86 pupils. All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  With the notable exception of those Deputies who are in larger conurbations, we all represent constituencies where there are strong and viable rural communities, so we are very conscious of this issue as well.  The small schools will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times. The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.  Even after all these budget measures are implemented, small schools will, in relative terms, be better staffed than medium to larger schools, which are currently operating at a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.  The Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the 73 small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  These schools will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's staffing circular that is published on the Department's website.  The appeals board meeting is taking place this week and schools will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible. A value for money examination of small schools, to which the Deputy referred, has been carried out and the Department expects to publish the analysis and findings of that in the near future.  I hope this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in examining the challenges ahead and how best to provide for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.

I reiterate that the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million and it is €147 million for 2014.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, he said that there is a school in his constituency that is bursting at the seams and he asked why do we not take some of pupils out of that school and populate a smaller school in the constituency with them.  We are not in the business in this country of engineering solutions whereby we would go into people's houses and say they must put their son or daughter into a particular school because one school is bursting at the seams and another one is just about thriving.

If the European Union member states keep electing right wing or centre right governments in the main, then there will be a right wing or neoliberal agenda in terms of how the Commission does its business.  Would the Deputy also acknowledge we now have a co-decision procedure where directly elected parliamentarians in the European Parliament co-decide with the Council of Ministers and with the Commission, and more and more of that agenda is done on a co-decision procedure in terms of the competences of the European Union?  Would she not agree also that the Stability and Growth Pact is something we have already signed up to, is laid down and was agreed by the citizens of Europe?

17497	SeanSherlock	Labour	14384.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-04-24 00:00:00	Prelude	618	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 and 325 together. The Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group was approved by Government on the 21 of February this year to be implemented as a whole of Government Policy goal. The Government agreed to the publication of the report, the future alignment of public investment with the 14 areas of priority identified in the Report, and appropriate cross-Government coordinated oversight and independent review mechanisms to give effect to the recommendations and take stock of their implementation. Minister Bruton and I launched the report on the 1 of March. Research prioritisation will be implemented under the authority of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs and a Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) has been established to drive implementation. In order to reinforce political and policy commitment to the research prioritisation agenda, I personally chair this Group and its membership comprehends those Departments that are members of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation and relevant research funding Agencies under the remit of those Departments. The PAG had its first meeting on 28 March and the intention is that it will meet on a monthly basis initially at least. At the first meeting we agreed a modus operandi for implementation which includes a focus on the 14 priority areas as well as systemic changes recommended in the Report to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the STI system. In relation to the 14 priority areas the intention is to develop Action Plans for each of these areas and that process has begun. In relation to the systemic actions these will be tackled simultaneously yet systematically with varying approaches depending on the nature of the change which is required. At its first meeting the PAG decided to prioritise implementation of a number of the system changes recommended and this included, in particular, those relevant to the establishment of a framework for monitoring implementation of prioritisation. Work is underway to agree macro level indicators to measure the impact of investment on the overall STI system in the first instance and the next phase of this work will be to establish micro level indicators to measure impact on the individual priority areas. It is expected that the first phase of this work will be complete by mid-year with the next stage due to be completed by the end of the year. It is clear that individual research funders are already aligning their funding calls with the priority areas recommended. This is exemplified in the recent call for proposals issued by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under their research centres programme. A central component of the new programme is that each new SFI research centre will be aligned with one or more of the prioritisation areas identified by the Report of the Steering Group on Research Prioritisation.

The terms of reference of the Copyright Review are as follows: Examine the present national Copyright legislation and identify any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation. Identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation. Examine the US style ""fair use"" doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context. If it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended, (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by the European Communities Directives on Copyright and Related Rights and other international obligations) make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting creativity and promoting and facilitating innovation. The Copyright Review Committee published a wide-ranging Consultation Paper on 29th February, 2012 which examines the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation.  The Consultation Paper is a discussion document which sets out issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties on foot of an initial consultation process held during the summer of 2011 (in the region of 100 submissions were received during the initial consultation process). The fundamental aim of this Paper is to begin the process of sketching reforms to Irish copyright law to further innovation without denying protection to those who need copyright law to innovate.  I would specifically refer to Chapter 6 of the Review Committee's Consultation Paper which is concerned with intermediaries and it is stated that ""One of the main questions for the present Review is whether the copyright balance between rights-holders and intermediaries now requires further amendment, in particular to incentivise innovation.""  If any interested party has any concerns in this regard, I would suggest that they engage with this review process. It should be noted that the Review Committee is carrying out the review of the existing Copyright legislation independently of the Department and/or Government.  The Review Committee will ultimately present a Report with a set of recommendations for legislative change.  It is anticipated that this Report will be completed by the end of 2012.  I wish to state that the recommendations for legislative change which are put forward in the Review Committee's final Report will be afforded careful consideration."
17500	SeanSherlock	Labour	14386.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-04-26 00:00:00	Prelude	711	 Cloud computing is a key target sector identified in the Action Plan for Jobs as offering major potential for Ireland, and establishing a Cloud Computing Technology Research Centre is one of the actions contained in the plan aimed at realising this potential. Earlier this month, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD announced details of a €1.2million initial research programme in the Cloud Computing Technology Research Centre, aimed at helping to make Ireland a world leader in this fast-growing area, and at making a significant contribution to jobs and economic growth. The funding will be allocated over 12 months to a consortium of Higher Education Institutions (DCU, UCC and AIT with input from NUIM) to carry out the initial research programme of the Centre. This initiative involves collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and IDA and is led and strongly supported by Irish companies and multinational companies in Ireland.  The research will focus on cloud computing technology architecture, service management, business research and cloud security.  This initial research programme will last 12 months and is a significant step in the context of a Government funded 5 year investment in a Technology Centre for Cloud Computing. A recent study by Goodbody Economic consultants projects that cloud computing sales by Irish firms could reach €9.5 billion per annum by 2014 and provide jobs for 8,600 people as current information technology activities migrate to the Cloud.  In addition, new services and markets will also emerge as a result of the Cloud, creating additional opportunities for Irish firms.

17503	SeanSherlock	Labour	14391.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	282	 I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I reiterate my concern at the treatment of this young person which is completely at variance with any republican principle to which we adhere as democrats.  The manner in which this young person was treated was also un-Christian.  I sympathise with her and agree with the Deputies. I can confirm to the House that the Department and the Minister take this matter very seriously.  On foot of correspondence from the Ombudsman for Children, the Department has initiated an inspection of the school concerned and that inspection is ongoing.  The first part involved an unannounced incidental inspection visit which took place in February.  A second inspection visit will be completed this month.  It is expected that the report on the inspection will be completed before the end of June.  In order not to prejudice the outcome of the inspector's report, I do not propose to comment further on the specific case.  That is not to fudge the issue, but in respect of enrolments generally, the current position is that every school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy in such a manner as the board, with the agreement of the patron, considers appropriate.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeals process where a board of management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, it is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills. The Minister has made the issue of reform of enrolment in schools a priority since taking up office.  Last June he published a discussion document on school admissions aimed at leading to changes in regulations and legislation on how primary and post-primary schools allocated places to students.  Central to the question of enrolment is the need to ensure a fair and transparent system in all schools which does not discriminate unfairly against students or parents.  The discussion paper on a regulatory framework for school enrolment contains suggestions on how the process of enrolling in schools can be made more open, equitable and consistent.  The has made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.  The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices. Education partners and interested parties were invited to submit their views to the Department by 28 October last and officials are co-ordinating the submissions received.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.  The Minister intends to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure every child is treated fairly and has a place at school. I hope this answer is an adequate response to the questions raised by the Deputies.  There is no timeframe for the legislation.  With regard to enrolment policy, there should be no distinction between publicly and privately funded schools.  That is a personal opinion.  If we cherish all the children equally, where they go to school should not affect how they are treated.  That is a personal view but it is one I would articulate in any legislative piece and I have made my view known to the Minister
17504	SeanSherlock	Labour	14391.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	286	 I thank the Deputies for their considered views on the issue.  All education stakeholders throughout the land would look with empathy on this case.  There is sense of empathy for the girl given the manner in which she was treated.  This example is an aberration in the system.  A decision was taken by one school.  The system and its stakeholders, by its nature, is empathetic and deals positively with people in all sorts of circumstances. I take the points made about the need for greater co-ordination at departmental level.  That is something that could be worked through the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Perhaps an initiative could arise out of those meetings that have taken place. The Minister has made it very clear that discrimination of this nature is unacceptable.  We would all agree with that position and I restate it.

17506	SeanSherlock	Labour	14391.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	320	" I am proud to be present today because it is the first anniversary of the announcement by the then president of the Labour Party, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, of his candidacy for the office of President of Ireland.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will quote from his statement of that day: The Labour Party is the oldest party in Ireland and was founded in the year before one of the greatest confrontations between labour and capital in the history of the Irish State, the great lock-out in Dublin of 1913. He goes on to say: What was then a poverty stricken and vulnerable movement of labour sought to organise against a version of capitalism that refused the most basic rights to workers, including the very right to organise.  That confrontation required courage, tenacity, solidarity and, above all, a commitment to class and history beyond the short-term challenges.  We should never forget that.  To this day we are the beneficiaries of the struggle of the labour movement of 1913.  Moreover, as their heirs we are required to make an analysis of our own difficult times to craft a strategy and to deliver our view of an alternative society with a sustainable and productive connection between economy and society in the institutions that can deliver it. That man, thankfully, is now President of Ireland.  I am proud to be here to say we are continuing, to the best of our ability, on his legacy and vision. On the legislation, and that particular vision, given the day that is in it, I was glad to see the pupils of the Presentation primary school of Doneraile in the Gallery because we must have regard to their future.  It is precisely in the vision set out by persons dating back to 1913, and through persons like President Michael D. Higgins, that such narrative continues.  We do our best to ensure there is a future for those children. The plight of employees in the current economic environment is foremost in the deliberations of Government as it seeks to stimulate the creation of jobs and a return to economic growth.  Various high-profile cases that have been widely reported in the media highlight the precarious nature of employment in some sectors at present and the need to ensure vulnerable employees are treated fairly by employers and their complaints adequately adjudicated by the appropriate employment rights bodies of the State. No doubt the proposed Bill under discussion here this evening is well intended.  However, it is impractical in its scope and in terms of what it seeks to achieve.  Ultimately, it could serve only to expose the taxpayer and employers to additional burdens while also, ironically, acting as a chill factor to the creation of vitally necessary new employment in the State.  We need only go back to one of the original EU directives of 1998 in this area which notes the need ""for balanced economic and social development"" within the EU. The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the processing of claims under the redundancy payments scheme and the insolvency payments scheme.  The insolvency payments scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and is designed to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  Such entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and certain pension contributions.  The scheme comprises a one-off payment in respect of outstanding debts to employees in respect of their legitimate employment entitlements subject to certain limits. The insolvency payments scheme and the redundancy payments scheme are two separate schemes, but they are both paid from the social insurance fund.  In 2011, €18.5 million was paid from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees. The Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of an employer in respect of most amounts paid under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 - the House will forgive me if this sounds technical, but I want to answer each of the points addressed in the Bill.  The distribution of the assets to creditors, including the Minister, is subject to the legislation and rules governing the winding-up of companies.  While an insolvent company, by definition, cannot meet its liabilities, the level of assets available for distribution can vary greatly.  The Minister may receive a dividend or be paid in full if there are sufficient funds in the liquidation/receivership.  All reimbursements made to the Minister by the liquidator from the assets of the company are returned to the social insurance fund. Sinn Féin, in proposing this Bill, seeks to widen the scope of insolvency to effectively allow an employee to render a company insolvent, by amending a provision of the 1984 Act.  The legislation currently in place provides for the recognition of companies becoming insolvent in circumstances such as where the employer has been adjudicated bankrupt; where the employer has filed a petition for, or has executed, a deed of arrangement within the meaning of section 4 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1887; where the employer has died and his or her estate, being insolvent, is being administered in accordance with the rules set out in Part I of the First Schedule to the Succession Act 1965; where the employer is a company, a winding up order is made or a resolution for voluntary winding up is passed with respect to it; where a receiver or manager of an undertaking is duly appointed, or possession is taken, by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by any floating charge, of any property of the company comprised in or subject to the charge; and where the employer is of a class or description specified in regulations under section 4(2) of this Act which are for the time being in force and the circumstances specified in the regulations as regards employers of such class or description obtain in relation to him."
17507	SeanSherlock	Labour	14391.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	322	 I beg the indulgence of my colleagues on this one.  If they are amenable to allowing me, I want to address the points in the legislation.
17508	SeanSherlock	Labour	14391.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	324	 I appreciate that and thank my colleagues.  I want to ensure we address the legislation before us. The current legislation also ensures that insolvency payments are paid to employees in respect of unpaid debts, such as wages and holiday pay, from the social insurance fund and protects employees' entitlements in the event of an insolvency.  Liquidation, the most common status pertaining to insolvency, is a permanent irreversible condition whereas the trading status of a company may change significantly depending on its circumstances.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to include a new category regarding the cessation of trading as part of the insolvency payments scheme. On the proposed amendment of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, I am satisfied the current provisions, contained in section 7 of the Act, are sufficient for this purpose.  The current legislation facilitates access to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the proposed amendment of section 9 is not necessary, given the reform process underway in respect of the employment rights adjudication bodies of the State. Sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, as amended, make it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory minimum 30-day employee information and consultation period.  The existing legislation provides for a range of sanctions to be applied against an employer where he or she fails to meet the information and consultation obligations under the Act, whereby failure to comply with section 9 on failure to consult or section 10 on failure to provide certain information, may result in a fine of up to €5,000.  Section 12 of the Act makes it mandatory for an employer to notify the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of his or her intention to create collective redundancies at least 30 days prior to the first dismissal taking effect. As I have indicated, while the thrust behind the legislation may be well intended, ultimately, this Bill is impractical and crucially may expose the taxpayer and the wider economy to major unintended consequences. There are two main difficulties with the Bill.  The 90-day consultation period for large companies is unrealistic and is inconsistent with the flexibility needed by companies to make decisions on restructuring and change.  The one certainty is that by imposing a consultation period as long as 90 days, the rule will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Equally, it could involve a prolonged period of uncertainty for employees, some of whom may be discouraged from remaining with a particular employer in what would be an artificially extended period of doubt. The proposed period of 90 days is significantly greater than in most other EU member states.  Significantly, the UK's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills is also actively evaluating the relevance of the continued application of the 90-day provision in the context of its own economic circumstances. The proposal surrounding the circumstances of a company ceasing trading and the granting of redundancy payments is overly simplistic and potentially lets the employer off the hook for what he or she should be rightfully paying by way of redundancy payments.  The proposal has the potential to encourage abuse by employers and will expose the taxpayer to costs that he or she should not have to bear. I ask the House to bear in mind those companies that are operating outside of this jurisdiction.  It must be also recognised that several of the cases that have given rise to this Bill concern a small number of intractable scenarios where sudden wind-ups have occurred as the result of court orders, many of which have been extra-jurisdictional, typically in the UK, and no consultation or information period whatsoever - be it 30 days or 90 days - takes place.  An extended notification period to employees in such difficult and atypical circumstances would be of limited use in seeking to improve the circumstances of affected employees.  The existing 30 day information and consultation period and the 30 day notification period to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have served the State well for more than 30 years and neither employer nor employee representatives have ever sought their amendment.  This is because, in the majority of normal collective redundancy situations, employers comply with the required information and consultation period, specifically that no dismissals take effect within a 30 day period. In fact, in practice, the notice period provided in proposed collective redundancies very often exceeds the minimum statutory provision.  A representative sample of redundancy notifications received by the Minister in 2012 shows that a majority of employees in collective redundancy situations already receive in excess of 30 days' notice that redundancies are planned for the company.  More than 65% of the notifications provided for a minimum period of six weeks before the first redundancy was due to occur, while 50% provided for a minimum period of two months before the first redundancy was due to take place.  Even in redundancy situations that did not provide for more than the minimum 30 day information and consultation period for some employees, the redundancies were often proposed on a phased basis, with many employees receiving longer notice of the planned redundancies. Existing legislative provisions contained in the Protection of Employment Act 1977 allow for National Employment Rights Authority inspectors, as authorised officers of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to carry out inspections to establish whether the Act is being complied with.  I would encourage any employees who believe their employer has not complied with the requirements of the legislation to make a complaint to the authority under the provisions of the Act. The Government is strongly committed to the protection of employees and the enhancement of their employment rights.  This commitment is most in evidence in the reform of the statutory workplace relations structures and processes initiated by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  He is committed to delivering a world class workplace relations service.  His main aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period of time.  Substantial progress has already been delivered in this regard.  A key element of the next phase of reform will be the delivery of a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision makers. I am aware I have gone beyond my allocated time, so I will leave it at that.

It aims to strike a fair balance between the interests of the parties concerned, including citizens, consumers, civil society and business; and to guarantee all safeguards and exemptions provided by existing or European norms, such as fundamental rights, privacy and freedom of speech.  Ireland, along with 21 other Member States signed ACTA on 26 January 2012. Following public concerns regarding ACTA, the Commission has decided to refer the Agreement to the Court of Justice of the European Union to assess whether it is in any way incompatible with the EU's fundamental principles in particular with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Commission Legal Service is currently finalising the written submission that will accompany the question. MEPs are democratically elected to represent the citizens of the European Union and act independently in that role in the EU Parliament. As a Member of the European Parliament and a representative of the people of Europe, it is their responsibility to fully inform themselves of the merit of this Agreement for the people of Europe prior to any vote. Accordingly, my Department is available to provide MEPs with background briefing should that be required.

17517	SeanSherlock	Labour	14392.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	476	 Cloud computing is one of the key target sectors identified in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  The Plan outlines the opportunities that cloud computing presents for Ireland arising from the global growth of the cloud computing sector in terms of attracting further foreign direct investment (FDI), supporting the emergence of start- up companies providing technology solutions and services via cloud computing, and, stimulating the use of cloud computing by SMEs and start-up companies.  It also acknowledges that key challenges relating to the need for high speed broadband, energy cost competitiveness and access to a supply of skilled workers must be addressed for these opportunities to be exploited to the full. The Action Plan outlines a number of specific actions for implementation in 2012 to ensure that Ireland can reap the substantial benefits in terms of jobs and growth from the global expansion of cloud computing.  One of these has already been implemented following my announcement last month of the €1.2 million industry led Cloud Computing Research Centre which is being funded by Government.  This centre brings together a team of researchers from DCU, UCC and Athlone Institute of Technology, with a cohort of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies, to establish ways to generate business from cloud computing.  One of the priority objectives for the team is to conduct research on maintaining and managing cloud based applications for businesses of all sizes. A number of other actions, which are designed to ensure that Ireland can fully exploit the employment potential offered by cloud computing, will be implemented throughout this year in accordance with the Action Plan.  These include: examining the potential for demonstration projects in cloud computing to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for this technology, provide a reference site for Irish companies, while potentially lowering costs and improving services; supporting industry groups, such as the Irish Software Association, to develop and deliver a practical tool kit to assist SMEs in assessing the adoption of Cloud Computing for their business; supporting research groups in areas of relevance to exploitation of cloud computing, such as semantic web and financial stock analysis, through, for example, support for the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI).  In other areas, such as middleware, information security, distributed computing, researchers are furthering research in this area with direct application in the cloud computing context; ensuring that the ICT Skills Action Plan, which is being implemented to address the shortage in ICT skills, incorporates the needs associated with the development of cloud computing in Ireland; and, Developing a Cloud Computing Procurement Standard with Industry experts through an NSAI Standards group. Progress reports on all of these actions will be provided on a quarterly basis throughout the year.

17519	SeanSherlock	Labour	14393.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	513	" I wish to acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed by your constituent regarding the introduction of the European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 which were signed into law on 29 February, 2012.  However, I would like to explain that this legislative measure concerning injunctions against intermediaries has been introduced to clarify the situation that arose following a High Court Judgment in the case of EMI and others -v- UPC.  This judgment held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter. I am satisfied that the High Court now has significant guidance in the implementation of the legislative measure which has been introduced arising from the underpinning EU Directives, as interpreted by the recent Court of Justice of the European Union case law, to ensure that any remedy provided will uphold the following principles: Freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs; The absolute requirement that an ISP cannot be required to carry out general monitoring on the information it carries on its network; Any measures must be fair and proportionate and not be unnecessarily complicated or costly; The fundamental rights of an ISPs' customers must be respected, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information. I would like to point out that I am determined to ensure that Ireland will be a premier location where innovation can flourish and where innovation is facilitated by our copyright laws.  In this regard, I am committed to reviewing and updating the Copyright legislation currently in place in order to strike   the right balance between encouraging innovation and protecting creativity. In this context, please note that the Copyright Review Committee published a wide-ranging Consultation Paper on 29 February, 2012 which examines the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation.  The Consultation Paper is a discussion document which sets out issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties on foot of an initial consultation process held during the summer of 2011 (in the region of 100 submissions were received during the initial consultation process). The fundamental aim of this Paper is to begin the process of sketching reforms to Irish copyright law to further innovation without denying protection to those who need copyright law to innovate.  I would specifically refer to Chapter 6 of the Review Committee's Consultation Paper which is concerned with intermediaries and it is stated that ""One of the main questions for the present Review is whether the copyright balance between rights-holders and intermediaries now requires further amendment,   in particular to incentivise innovation.""  If any interested party has any concerns in this regard, I would suggest that they engage with this review process."

17531	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	354	 Can I clarify?  I am reading a response that is pertinent to the issue Deputy Flanagan is raising.  It is in order to assist with the reply.  I say that sincerely.
17532	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	356	 I am a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is unavoidably detained elsewhere.
17533	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	358	 I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important matter.  The Deputy refers to an announcement last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013-14 academic year.  A considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, on the grounds of equity and fairness.  The introduction of such a test would create a more equitable basis for means testing where a more complete analysis is undertaken of a family's capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.  The Deputy will appreciate, in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those who need them most and this has become a high priority.  While the introduction of a capital asset test for student grants may have traditionally been perceived as likely to impact in particular on farming communities, I assure the Deputy this is not the object of the proposal.  The means test will be applied fairly to all applicants. Deputy Flanagan may be aware that a dedicated capital asset test implementation group has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals for new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants beginning in the 2013-14 academic year.  The group has met on three occasions and its deliberations are ongoing.  I anticipate the group will report to the Minister by the summer and will make recommendations on the inclusion or exclusion of various classes of assets.  Any proposals will require further Government agreement and will necessitate legislative amendment.  It will, therefore, be agreed at Cabinet level.
17534	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	360	 The short reply is that any decision of this nature is ultimately a political decision to be decided by Government.  We must await the recommendations of the implementation group and have consideration to those recommendations.  However, it is ultimately a political decision. I share the concerns raised by Deputy Flanagan in that I, too, represent a constituency with a significant agricultural output and where for a certain coterie of the farming community, income would be meagre, to be frank about it.
17535	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	 There has to be some regard to the tools of the trade, as it were, that are necessary to derive that income.  The Minister has met with ICMSA representatives and he has had regard to the position espoused by them and the implementation group is working as we speak and we await its recommendations.  However, it will be ultimately a decision for Government.
17536	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	364	 I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the very serious issue of bullying.  Tackling the issue of bullying, and in particular homophobic bullying in schools, is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Bullying can ruin a young person's enjoyment of some of the most important years of his or her life and in some cases can have tragic consequences. Deputy Neville summed it up when he spoke about the pervasive nature of this form of bullying.  It can act as a barrier to a young person having equal access to education.  I note that Deputy Neville referred to the document drafted by GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network.  I am to meet with that organisation's chair, Mr. Kieran Rose, shortly so that we can drive an agenda that speaks to the concerns raised by Deputy Neville. Research has shown that, unfortunately, homophobic bullying is a problem in Irish schools, and a correlation has been found between homophobic bullying and serious mental health difficulties such as suicide.  That is one of the reasons the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, convened an anti-bullying forum recently, on 17 May, to explore ways to tackle the serious problem of bullying in schools.  That date, 17 May, marked the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. The forum, which was well attended and thought-provoking, considered issues around all forms of bullying including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.  There were a range of speakers at the forum, which included contributions from officials of the Department of Education and Skills, and from an acknowledged academic in the field of anti-bullying.  There were also contributors from the school sector, including the various perspectives of school principals, parents and pupils.  The objective was to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools.  A further objective was to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this, having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate. The outcome of the discussions at the forum will provide an opportunity to set out a roadmap on how best to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.  A considerable amount of work to address the issue of bullying in schools has been done by State agencies and NGOs, such as GLEN and BeLonG To.  We need to address how we can deepen the impact of the measures that are already in place and also strengthen the culture of awareness in schools.  The work of the forum and any recommendations from it must be cognisant of the current difficult and challenging budgetary environment. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has also established a working group on tackling bullying.  The outcomes, recommendations and submissions from the forum will assist the working group in its deliberations.  The first phase to be addressed by the working group will be homophobic bullying.  There will be an opportunity for all interested stakeholders to submit their views in writing.  Students, teachers, parents and all other interested parties are invited to submit their views on this important topic by 29 June 2012. Deputy Neville has taken a strong lead on this issue.  If we continue to engage in fora such as this one, we will be able to shed more light on the issue, thus having the required beneficial outcomes.  We all believe that bullying is an issue we can address by sharing our experiences and working together to produce an effective response.
17537	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	366	 I thank the Deputy for his input.  It is important to acknowledge the work that is already being done by the Department of Education and Skills to combat and prevent bullying.  The inspectorate provides help to schools by supporting, advising on and evaluating anti-bullying measures.  This is done through the primary and post-primary school evaluation process, and through the social, personal and health education subject inspections.  There are therefore a wide range of services in that area. I note Deputy Neville's point about some schools being willing to engage in anti-bullying programmes while others are less so.  If there is a submission to that effect coming through this process, the Department of Education and Skills should take it on board in order to have a qualitative outcome to this issue.  Ultimately, the more educated we all are as citizens about this matter, the more it will be clarified and demystified.  The more normalised our culture becomes around this issue, the less pervasive it will be.  If we can change a culture we can then modify behaviour positively.  I note Deputy Neville's points and I hope there will be some mechanism to address the lack of engagement by some schools on this matter.
17538	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	368	 I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  Local authorities have traditionally been the lenders of last resort for low income households who could not access funds from commercial lenders.  By definition, this cohort of borrowers is more susceptible to the economic downturn and external shock.  In this context, it is unsurprising then that local authority mortgage arrears should exceed those in the commercial sector and the Department's most recent information puts the level of loans in arrears at almost 28%. In 2009, the Department issued guidelines for the granting of local authority housing loans which applied stringent conditions and a more homogenous process across all 34 administrations.  Credit checking of applications by the Irish Credit Bureau was a central component of this initiative, and loans advanced under the new regime are performing considerably better than pre-2009 ones. However, it is important that households facing difficulties are treated fairly and consistently across all local authority areas.  In that regard, the Department issued comprehensive guidance in 2010 based on the regulator's code of practice.  This is to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned. Recognising the increasing difficulty with local authority mortgage arrears, the Department has been working in conjunction with the City and County Managers Association to produce a loans management manual, the publication of which is imminent.  This will provide borrowers in distress with a suite of options under a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, to deal with their loans.  It closely mirrors the Financial Regulator's revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which came into effect on 1 January 2011.  It provides for a collaborative engagement between borrower and lender to either restructure the loan to a sustainable level, or else recognise its sustainability and act accordingly. Whereas it would be hoped that as many home owners as possible could be facilitated under the MARP, it would be unrealistic not to accept the inevitability of a proportion of loans being deemed unsustainable.  In these circumstances the local authorities and the borrower would need to face the inevitability of the loan being unsustainable and act accordingly in a collaborative and co-operative manner. Local authorities will continue to deal with distressed borrowers with the same forbearance and sympathy they have exhibited in the past.  They will facilitate where at all possible as many home owners as possible to retain their properties and service their debts until such time as we return to less challenging times. I do not have a date in respect of the question the Deputy asked but respectfully suggest that if he were to table a parliamentary question or send me on note on it, I would be happy to try to oblige him.  We do not have a definitive timeline for the publication of the guidelines but I will endeavour to come back to the Deputy on that. The Deputy referred to 106 homes in the case of County Offaly.  I am not sure if that is the rate of arrears, to what exact figure that would amount, or what it would be as a percentage of the loan book in the Offaly area.  If there are issues pertaining to his specific area, I have an open mind in terms of engagement or at least I can refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.
17539	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	370	 Having been a member of a local authority and as somebody who continues to interface with a local authority on behalf of my constituents, it is fair to reiterate that the level of sympathy and empathy with individual clients is one kind of a positive engagement where the local authority endeavours to do its very best for the client in question.  I believe we would all agree on that point.  However, there is an inevitability that a certain number of mortgages will go under. On the specific issues the Deputy raised, it is not fair to assume that because there is a lack of a timescale for the publication the Deputy would infer that it will not be before the summer recess.  I can come back to him on the specific matters raised and refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. I will undertake to also refer the Deputy's question on the shared ownership scheme to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I am not trying to dodge the issues, I simply do not have the specific replies to the Deputy's questions and I would rather not try to play a game of bluff.
17540	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	421	 I am happy to conclude the discussion on Second Stage of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012.  This legislation will address some of the difficulties being faced every day by small and medium enterprises, SMEs, throughout the country, which I have been made aware of daily since being appointed Minister of State last year.  The ability of our SMEs to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for employment, growth and prosperity, and this Bill shows our commitment to implement change and reform in a step by step approach, to re-energise the economy, meet the challenges of recovery, address a failed economic model, restore confidence and to enhance Ireland's position in the world.
17541	SeanSherlock	Labour	14412.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	423	" I wish to respond to some of the comments made by Members.  In the context of the finer details of how the scheme will operate, the Minister will lay the scheme before the House as soon as this legislation is enacted.  This provision is provided for in section 6 of the Bill.  As for the use of personal guarantees, the banks still will be able to consider the normal and usual ways that security is provided by borrowers.  Invoice discounting will be eligible for the guarantee scheme.  The guarantee will be for three years but the loan may be for a longer term.  The legislation provides for the premium payment to be paid upfront.  However, this matter of the timing of the payment is being reconsidered and amendments may be tabled on Committee Stage.  The scheme will be demand-led and the Government will follow performance and take-up closely.  If figures show that demand exceeds €150 million, this figure can be revisited and amended, if necessary. Regarding loans that are defaulted, the banks will follow their normal recoveries procedures.  This matter of recoveries will be covered in the scheme.  As for the issue of late payment of invoices causing difficulties to small businesses, the Department will transpose the new EU directive on late payments before 16 March 2013.  With regard to ensuring additionality of lending under the guarantee scheme, the Department is in talks with the banks at present to ensure they fully understand their obligations.  The loans provided under the scheme will be closely monitored to ensure they fall within the two market failures the scheme is designed to address.  In respect of the risk-sharing ratio, this is a joint commitment by the Government and the banks.  The combination of guarantee rate and default limit will deliver an overall risk share of 50:50.  Losses over the default rate must be borne by the banks. In the context of the microfinance fund, it will avail of the EU progress guarantee facility as soon as the lending entity is established.  I also point out that First Step, which lends to micro-enterprise, already avails of this EU guarantee facility.  Any further issues to which I have not responded will be addressed on Committee Stage. As my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, noted in his opening comments on commending the Bill to the House, The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012 prioritises where it will place its efforts to best effect over the coming months.  It adds up to a co-ordinated plan of vigorous and targeted action in order that the Government achieves change and makes a difference.  Businesses need action from the Government, not words.  This legislation is clear evidence of concrete action that will produce tangible benefits for the businesses that avail of the guarantee scheme.  The Bill will help restore confidence, which is an integral part of economic health.  It also forms an essential part of our recovery.  Businesses must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding their order books and payrolls.  Banks must be willing and able to lend sufficiently to meet the needs of business again.  Consumers must regain the confidence to spend again. The Government's overall strategy is aimed at making sure citizens and businesses feel confident it has their interests at heart and is implementing necessary change.  The strategy is to ensure they have an outlet for entrepreneurial initiative and marketable ideas and the chance to turn them into commercial products.  Making sure they can confidently go into business and create jobs is an essential element of the Government programme and making sure that Ireland is strongly perceived as a good place to do business is essential in generating such confidence.  The Government has committed to making Ireland, to quote the Taoiseach, ""the best small country in the world in which to do business"" by 2016 and it can achieve that target.  The Government has a legitimate and important role in improving the finance environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Carefully designed legislative interventions, such as this measure, can help markets function better, give certainty to business and confidence to consumers.  I believe this legislation will inspire confidence among SMEs in the banks' abilities to provide an improved service to SME customers, including previously discouraged borrowers.  It has been frequently acknowledged in the recent past that there will be a cohort of discouraged borrowers who assumed they would be turned down and therefore did not apply for credit.  The introduction of a guarantee scheme may help to support this group to pursue business opportunities again. The majority of Ireland's enterprise sector comprises small businesses.  Now more than ever, ambitious and energetic business owners, entrepreneurs and managers who can play a real part in driving a positive uplift in the economy are needed.  They are the job creators and innovators and must be encouraged and supported to have the confidence to make their mark and build a better future for themselves and this country.  These are the all too often unseen risk takers and innovators and it always will be the hard-work and entrepreneurial skills of such individuals that will lie at the heart of the success of Ireland's SMEs.  All these companies have financing needs through the various stages of business development such as start up, managing working capital, investing in new products or services, marketing strategies, innovation and research and development, expanding output and entering new markets.  It is essential that the financial system supports the needs of SMEs through all these stages. Many businesses have contacted the Department about the problems caused by their difficulties in accessing credit.  All Members, as public representatives, are aware of the difficulties that face people within their constituencies and nationwide.  Increased risk aversion among banks has made it significantly harder for smaller companies to obtain finance in recent years compared with the period before the crisis.  Herein lies the mismatch between the needs of productive business and the bank finance available.  While banks are trying to reduce risk, business lending, especially to SMEs, is risky.  Entrepreneurship is risky.  Introducing new products and services is risky.  Exporting to emerging markets is risky.  Innovation is risky.  This Bill will enable the Government to absorb some of the risk of lending in order that businesses can get on with what they do best.  We must dismantle unnecessary barriers that stymie growth and hold back investment.  That is exactly what this Government is determined to do and this Bill moves us in that direction. I personally have met various companies that are at the margins of SME commercial lending decisions because the businesses have insufficient security or the lender does not have the skills to carry out an appropriate assessment of the business proposition.  It is essential to address this issue in a way that will not reduce the onus on banks to honour their commitments to increase SME lending overall but which would facilitate additional lending over and above those commitments. In conclusion, this Bill is important legislation.  It will assist in the Government's plans to reshape the finance landscape to render it more effective in meeting the needs of Irish businesses.  The Government is taking decisive action to create the environment that supports new companies, new jobs and new economic opportunities.  I refer to action that keeps open the doors of Irish businesses, supports existing business to scale up and expand and facilitates more people who have the ambition and drive to set up their own business.  This Bill is just one of the many steps for delivery of such a challenging agenda."

Some of the recommendations were incorporated subsequently into the Department of Finance's current guidelines to public contracting authorities which are designed to ensure tendering processes operate in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs.  These include the lowering, from €50,000 to €25,000, of the estimated value of contracts to be advertised on the e-tenders website, the splitting of larger contracts into lots, and the communication by contracting authorities of future procurement plans by issuing prior information notices.  None the less, it is clear that more effort must be made to ensure the guidelines are applied by procurement officers in contracting authorities, and work is under way to ensure this is happening. The action plan for jobs contains a number of specific measures designed to facilitate an increase in SME participation in the tendering process, and my Department is working collaboratively with key players such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Procurement Service, NPS, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to deliver the commitments as set out in the action plan. In addition, the Department chairs a steering group bringing together the main stakeholders in this area.  Under the aegis of the steering group, Enterprise Ireland, the National Procurement Service and InterTradeIreland are working on a number of initiatives to boost SME participation in the public procurement process, including, for example, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of clusters of SMEs to work with contracting authorities develop innovative supply chain solutions.  The aim is to establish a level playing field in the area of public procurement to facilitate increased SME participation.
17562	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	210	" Specifically on the issue of public procurement, I refer the Deputy to the action plan for jobs.  Actions 3.49 to 3.54, inclusive, relate to pre-qualification criteria, the establishment of a mechanism to allow SMEs to engage with contracting authorities on issues of concern, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of advisers and mentors to help client companies to prepare better public procurement opportunities, encouraging more SMEs to register on the Government's e-tenders website to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention, encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering by focusing on innovative solutions to procurement needs rather than specific products or services, and identifying a number of key procurement projects that will provide subcontracting and supply chain opportunities for SMEs. In terms of specific actions, a round table discussion on the advantages of innovative procurement through the procurement innovation initiative organised by the Department took place on 2 April 2012.  It was attended by senior procurement officials in public bodies and by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  A number of SMEs presented examples of innovative solutions they are already providing to public bodies.  Some public bodies have indicated specific, upcoming procurement projects that would be suitable for the procurement innovation initiative.  They included the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, the Department of Defence, the Health Service Executive, HSE, An Post and the ESB.  Given the time constraints I will refer the Deputy to the specific actions in that regard. InterTradeIreland also organised popular ""Go-2-Tender"" training workshops.  The workshops give SMEs the skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts on an all-island basis.  Three were held in the past three months, involving more than 70 SMEs, including one held in Cork.  A further three workshops are due to be held in Enniskillen, Armagh and Waterford before the end of July.  An advanced ""Go-2-Tender"" workshop was held in April-May and another is planned for later this year.  There is constant engagement by Enterprise Ireland with contracting authorities to raise awareness of innovative ideas and capabilities of SMEs to provide innovative solutions to their specific needs.  We have moved well beyond the 2009 report, and the action plan for jobs has clear action deliverables in terms of public procurement."
17563	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	287	 The Government's jobs initiative of May 2011 was aimed at restoring confidence in the economy, providing opportunities for re-skilling those who had lost jobs and assisting people in getting back to work.  Key measures in the jobs initiative included halving the rate of employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week, a reduction in the lower rate of VAT on certain goods and services, targeted capital spending on labour-intensive projects, and the introduction of the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  Additional education and training places were also provided for those seeking to upskill. The impact of these measures is being seen across a range of sectors, but particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors where the latest quarterly national household survey, published today, shows a year-on-year increase of 8,700 in the numbers employed in the accommodation and food service sectors.  Almost 7,500 interns have commenced placements under the JobBridge programme since it was launched last July.  Feedback from the Department of Social Protection indicates that 966 of the 2,575 people who have already completed JobBridge have gone directly into employment with the host organisation or elsewhere.  More than 3,500 people recently graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, recently announced a further roll-out of the Springboard initiative with an additional 6,000 places in 2012. The Government has built on the jobs initiative this year with its action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work strategy, adding a significant range of actions to promote employment and assist those seeking work.  Pathways to Work places a particular focus on the long-term unemployed, while the new €20 million labour market education and training fund will include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.  FÁS has issued a call for expressions of interest from training and education providers in regard to this fund. In the three years prior to the Government taking office, more than 300,000 jobs were lost.  This scale of job loss cannot be reversed overnight, but we are systematically delivering on the commitments we made in the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work.  While employment may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in this transition phase of our economic recovery, the significant job announcements since January - which include BSkyB, Mylan, Apple, Eli Lilly, PayPal and others - point to the return of a level of confidence in the Irish economy that will translate into an increase in the number of people in employment as the jobs come on stream.

17565	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	297	 Yes.  A dialogue can be entered into in that respect. On the question of whether the jobs initiatives introduced by the Government are proving a success, the central point is that this is a ship which will take a long time to turn around.  We acknowledge the figures and are bold and honest enough not to bury our heads in the sand in that regard.  We are seeking to implement a set of policy prerogatives in the form of labour market activation measures and education-related measures.  The latter include JobBridge, Pathways to Work and Springboard, while the former includes the extension of the PRSI incentive scheme in a way that incentivises employers to engage employees and interns.  We are also concerned with identifying skills shortages and seeking to address those through the education sphere.  All of that will take time. On the procurement issue, the action plan for jobs includes a range of deliverables for the end of 2012, to which I respectfully ask Deputy Peadar Tóibín to have regard.  If he does not accept what I am saying, he should speak with representatives of the State agencies tasked with these actions, who will demonstrate the actions they are undertaking at the behest of the Government.  There is a reporting mechanism attached to the deliverables which sees the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs reporting directly to the Taoiseach.  It is not at all accurate to say our activities in this regard are based merely on aspiration.  With respect to the Deputy, my response pointed to the clear action points we are driving in regard to procurement.
17566	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	298	 In July 2011 my proposals for reform of consumer and competition legislation were approved by Government.  These embodied two commitments given in the Programme for Government, namely, the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and the introduction of a legislative base for a code of practice in the grocery sector.  In addition, the proposals gave effect to the recommendation of the advisory group on media mergers and updated certain elements of competition and consumer law. Under the proposals, responsibility for the application of the public interest test in respect of media mergers will transfer to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The consolidation of the various elements of consumer and competition law into a single Act is entirely in keeping with the principles of better regulation and with the trend within Government to consolidate and simplify legislation for ease of reference for all users. All of the elements of the package are important measures to be delivered.  I see no benefit in progressing a stand-alone item of legislation for one element, to be followed in due course by a more comprehensive package of reforms.  I expect the consumer and competition Bill to be published later this year. The Dáil adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 June 2012.
17567	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	299	" Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and it is a key focus of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. Enterprise Ireland (EI) has established a new Potential Exporters Division, a key measure in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place. The new unit provides assistance designed to aid client companies investigate, prepare and execute an international strategy including: Practical business advice, information and market intelligence, Targeted funding supports where appropriate, Suitable training and development. So far this year EI has held six Export Awareness Events around the country with the next one taking place on 12th June.  Approximately 200 companies have attended these events with more than 1,200 companies contacted and invited.  EI has commenced a number of two day ""Exploring Exporting"" workshops with over 40 companies participating.  Further events and workshops will continue to be rolled out during the year. Enterprise Ireland's 29 overseas offices and international networks have an important role to play in the internationalisation of EI's established and start-up client companies, through positioning them to meet the needs of specific international market and guiding them in the right direction regarding market contacts and introductions to potential buyers.  Through this network, EI clients have secured 294 new buyers this year, while 316 buyers have been attracted to engage with indigenous companies on international business opportunities. Another essential support to underpin the export ambitions of SMEs is developing a wider network of EU Free Trade Agreements. These agreements increase market access for our exporters by reducing barriers to trade and investment, encourage the mutual recognition of EU standards so that technical barriers to trade are removed and generally make it easier and less costly for our exporters to trade. We are coming up to the first anniversary, on 1 July, when the first major FTA with Korea came into effect to improve market access to this powerful Asian economy. Other agreements are being negotiated with Canada, Singapore and Malaysia while talks about improving market access to Vietnam have just started. All these are markets that have been identified as priority markets in our Trade, Tourism and Investment strategy."

Cloud computing is a key sector identified in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the development of this SWiFT by National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) marks the delivery of a Q2 measure under the Action Plan. ""SWiFT 10:"" was launched on 21 May 2012. The Irish Internet Association disseminated information on the SWiFT to the 6,500 subscribers of their Newsletter and 12,500 followers on Twitter. Both mainstream and IT specialist media reported on the Launch. It is intended for use as a means of assessing Cloud adoption prioritisation and suitability. The SWiFT guidance will support organisations to thoroughly assess the practical suitability of Cloud computing across the gamut of their business operations.  It includes a thorough review of all legal, security, maturity and cost/benefit considerations. SMEs in particular will be receptive to this SWiFT, as they are looking to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, increase agility and open up new avenues. Recent research indicates that while SMEs are convinced of the merits of the Cloud, they are hesitant to take those first steps. SWiFT 10 will guide business owners and managers through the process and assist them in making the appropriate decisions and setting the right course for their Cloud adoption strategy. SWiFT 10 helps organisations determine whether Cloud is a right fit for them or not. It provides not only a starting point for businesses considering Cloud, it guides them through all the features that need to be considered when adopting Cloud and helps organisations large and small assess the risks and more importantly the benefits for their business at a small cost of less than €20. In this regard this SWiFT will clear some of the confusion which may be hampering Cloud adoption and provide a means of promoting and encouraging greater adoption among Irish SMEs. It is not possible at this stage to put a number on the SMEs that will avail of the SWiFT 10 guidance."
17569	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	308	" I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 29 together. My Department, through the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offer a range of supports to assist and enable entrepreneurs and enterprises to exploit the value of Intellectual Property (IP) and to engage in the optimal exploitation of research and development, and specifically in applying for patents. Reflecting Enterprise Ireland's enterprise development mission, the agency supports companies to be more competitive through innovation.  An output from this can be the creation of patented Intellectual Property (IP), however, measuring the resultant number of patent applications is not an effective metric to assess the output from these supports. This is because there are many alternative and often more appropriate ways for companies to capture and exploit their intellectual property.  For example, in the software sector patenting may be prohibited by patent law, therefore, copyright is a more common means of securing a company's intellectual assets.  Enterprise Ireland therefore does not set targets for the number of patents filed or for increases in the number of patents filed by its client companies. Enterprise Ireland's focus is on supporting businesses to be innovative and where this produces IP, the business is supported to use the most appropriate process to protect it, which can include patenting. Intellectual Property supports are integrated with the broader range of innovation supports provided by EI.  Under the R&D Fund companies, including HPSUs, can receive support for the costs of the early stages of patenting.  However, companies may determine that patenting is not the optimal means of protecting any new Intellectual Property and may rely, instead, on copyright, or non-disclosure and/or first mover advantage, depending on circumstances and sector. Considering the diversity of needs that the client base represents Enterprise Ireland also provides a number of non-financial supports to help companies to make the best Intellectual Property protection decisions based on their specific situation. In some circumstances the most effective way for a company to secure key IP (including patents) is not to develop it themselves but rather to licence or acquire it from another company or college.  Enterprise Ireland's Technology Transfer Executives working with the Enterprise Europe Network provide access to IP from a range of sources and support companies to transfer targeted IP into their companies. In terms of building the capability of Irish companies a joint exercise between Enterprise Ireland (with the Enterprise-Europe Network) and the Irish Patent Office ran a very successful campaign of events, under the heading ""Building a Business on your ideas"".  With support from the County Enterprise Boards and Institutes of Technology this initiative addressed an Innovation Task Force recommendation that, ""An understanding of the importance of IP, its value and commercial potential should be strongly cultivated in the business community and Irish society at large"". Recently Enterprise Ireland appointed an Intellectual Property Manager to strengthen the agency's resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property. In addition, the Patents Office provides a range of information supports to prospective patent applicants through the Office's websitewww.patentsoffice.ie including a detailed Patent Application Guide for applicants who wish to file a patent application without using the services of a patent agent.  To reduce patenting costs for applicants for Irish 20 year patents, the statutory fee for the search which is required in order to establish novelty and non-obviousness has been reduced from €361 to €200. The report of the IP Implementation Group is due to be published very shortly which will spell out a new national protocol aimed at encouraging the transfer of more IP into Irish companies from the third level sector.  Enterprise Ireland will play a central role in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. I am satisfied that national supports directed at Irish companies engaged in research, development and innovation will continue to result in new inventions that are patented adding further to economic growth and development."
17570	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	313	 A number of agencies under the remit of my Department provide supports for research and development including Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver a world class standard of research activity in third level institutions and linked to Irish enterprises. Their Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology and Strategic Research Clusters help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry. Their Principal Investigator Programme supports those fields of science and engineering that underpin biotechnology, ICT and energy and their Research Frontiers Programme supports research in framework or integrative fields of science, engineering and mathematics that contribute educational benefit that will advance national scientific progress. Enterprise Ireland operates a suite of programmes to expand research capacity in companies, to increase collaboration between enterprise and the research sector and to maximise the commercialisation of the State's research investment. They offer 14 main initiatives for supporting research and development in businesses. Ireland's strengthened national research ecosystem has enhanced IDA's capacity to attract increased levels of high-value R&D projects and new RD&I investment approvals are playing a strategic role in embedding existing employment in FDI companies and setting the groundwork for increased future employment. The work of the enterprise agencies is underpinned by investments under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions which is aimed at strengthening national research capabilities in human and physical infrastructure. There are a number of other programmes providing research and development supports delivered by other state agencies, funding for which is channelled through a number of other Government Departments, full details of which are outlined in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators Report published in December 2011 which is available on my Department's website.
17571	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	317	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 37 together. Under the Europe 2020 Strategy, the European Council adopted a number of headline targets, including improving the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 3% of GDP. In accordance with the Strategy, Member States have adopted national targets on the basis of these headline targets, as set out in their National Reform Programmes, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances. Ireland's National Reform Programme, transmitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011, specified that Ireland's 2020 target in relation to R&D is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP). The latest available data on total research and development expenditure in the State, known as Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD), relates to the year 2010, and indicates that GERD as a percentage of GNP was 2.16% or 1.77% of GDP. Approximately two thirds of this expenditure is by the private sector.  The National Reform Programme outlined a number of assumptions to reach the target for expenditure on R&D by 2020, in relation to the period up to and including 2014, in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and subsequently on the basis of a return to sustainable growth domestically and a recovered global economy.  This growth will be driven through a continuation of a supportive fiscal environment for R&D investment as well as supports for higher education R&D, industry linkages with higher education researchers, commercialisation of research results, in-company R&D and start-up companies.
17572	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	322	 Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was established in 2000 with a mission to build and strengthen Ireland's scientific and engineering research capacity and human capital in the areas of greatest strategic value to Ireland's long-term competitiveness and enterprise development. This was one of a range of key industrial policy initiatives taken to grow our employment value chain as decades of relative under-funding had left Ireland lacking internationally competitive research and development capability and human capital in areas of strategic national interest. This was deemed to be an impediment to attracting large-scale international R&D-based firms and to building knowledge-based, internationally competitive indigenous firms. Since 2000, SFI, along with significant research investments supported through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Higher Education Authority amongst others, Ireland has developed an internationally recognised and credible research base. Following the Government's approval of the Research Prioritisation report, the next phase of Ireland's research system evolution places the emphasis on areas with the greatest potential for economic return.  Since its establishment SFI has managed a portfolio of award programmes to support scientific and engineering research ranging from early career researchers to large research centres with multiple industry collaborations.  The overriding criteria in determining what investments SFI supports are research excellence allied to relevance to Ireland's enterprise base. Through its various programmes SFI now supports over 500 research groups, comprising approximately 3,000 team members, located across Ireland's higher education institutions.  Many of these research groups have established very significant collaborations with industry and this is strong evidence of the maturing of the SFI investment. To build on this level of engagement with industry and ensure further economic impact for Ireland, SFI recently called for proposals under the newly developed SFI Research Centres programme. The programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes.  Successful SFI Research Centres will have to achieve and maintain at least 30% of their overall centre budget in industry contributions. There is a requirement that 10% of this be a cash contribution. Not only does this ensure that the Exchequer gets best value for its investment, it will ensure that the needs and opportunities of industry are well represented and are reflected in the research programme. SFI, in devising the new Research Centres programme, has placed a greater emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to industry-related opportunities, and researchers will be in a position to embrace additional targeted projects and extend their outreach with commercial stakeholders.  SFI is currently assessing pre-proposal applications under the new Centres programme. The initial call has demonstrated a clear demand from industry for this focused engagement — over 450 companies are involved in the 35 pre-proposals submitted to SFI. SFI has put in place a balanced portfolio of award programmes that supports excellent research while ensuring that funded research groups are in a position to convert and commercialise this research in collaboration with industry. As part of the enterprise development system in Ireland, SFI will continue to fund top-class research with impact and train people that will play a critical role in attracting, retaining, growing and forming companies in Ireland.
17573	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	 On March 1st 2012 the Government published the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, which is now Government policy and a key pillar of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. As a consequence of the prioritisation process the changes to Science Foundation Ireland's (SFI) pre-selection procedure have only been recently introduced and therefore we should be cautious in making conclusions at this early stage.  The objective of the change is to further increase the quality and diversity as well as the impact of the research supported by SFI. SFI has responded very quickly in using impact and the alignment of the Government's new research priority areas to help assess its major research funding decisions in the months ahead. In February 2012 SFI issued a call for proposals under the new SFI Research Centres Programme. This centres based programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes, while taking on board all that SFI has learned in the past 12 years since establishment. The new programme will address the needs of industry by ensuring that, up-front, the research programmes of each Research Centre will be aligned with one or more of the prioritisation areas identified by the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  In addition to the rigorous scientific evaluation for which SFI is already very well regarded, proposals received by SFI under the 2012 call will receive a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the potential impact that the Research Centre may deliver to the industry sector, as well as the Irish economy as a whole. As part of the Research Centres Programme call process, SFI has used an impact panel of leading investors in science, leaders of industry and internationally competitive research centres to help it assess the strategic value of the research projects it is considering at the pre-proposal state.  Overall, having some assessment based on impact and commercialisation criteria can provide a very useful mechanism, but only when made in the context of research excellence. This will ensure that the SFI Research Centres that are established have demonstrated their relevance and potential to contribute to the success of industry based in Ireland. In undertaking this strategic pre-proposal review SFI was mindful to ensure that research with less obvious or immediate impact is not ignored.  These changes will build on SFI's established and well regarded independent international review process. It is anticipated that the actual awards arising from the 2012 Research Centres Programme call process will be announced early in Quarter 1, 2013.
17574	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	351	 Minister Bruton announced the establishment of Enterprise Ireland's Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund in January 2012. The Fund was outlined in theSouth-East Employment Action Plan   which was published in late 2011.  Companies in the ICT, industrial and food sectors based in the South East were eligible to apply. The purpose of the Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund for the South East Region is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets.  The fund is designed to assist a new start-up company or individual entrepreneur to investigate the viability of a new growth orientated business or proposition. The Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund for the South East Region managed by Enterprise Ireland established a fund of €200,000 with each successful applicant receiving a maximum grant of €25,000 to cover 50% of eligible expenditure. By the end of the close date, 45 applications were received. Applications were then assessed on the basis of eligibility and on the merits of the project.  14 were approved for funding support under the Pilot Fund.
17575	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 The recently announced New Frontiers Programme replaces the Enterprise Platform Programme and aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's recently announced Action Plan for Jobs. The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6-8 week introductory course. The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres. Eight Institutes of Technology (IoTs) have partnered to form four collaborative programmes to deliver the New Frontiers Programme while individual programmes are also being offered from a number of IoTs as follows: Collaborative Programmes Individual Programmes IT Carlow/Waterford IT Dublin IT Limerick IT/IT Tralee Dundalk IT (partnered with CIT) IT Tallaght/IT Blanchardstown Cork IT (partnered with DkIT) IT Sligo/Letterkenny IT Galway-Mayo IT (partnered with AIT) Athlone IT (partnered with GMIT)
17576	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	356	 The use of technology and innovation has a crucial role to play in supporting economic recovery and in driving sustainable employment in the current environment. Enterprise Ireland in particular, employs a range of supports to encourage and facilitate Irish companies to adapt to, purchase and use new technologies.  Amongst these supports are: E-Business Initiative — under which companies are supported in making effective use of computer-based services including internet, customer relationship management, finance and general business administration.  Since 2005, almost 400 such supports have been offered. Over 250 projects have been initiated under the Lean Start or Lean Plus programmes which provide companies with the Lean tools and techniques to help companies to address competitiveness issues within their businesses by building their capability to identify problems and improve operations. A range of grant schemes have been offered particularly to support capital equipment investment for improved productivity, competitiveness and growth, including:  Productivity Improvement Fund;  Job Expansion Fund; Growth Fund; Company Expansions; Dairy Process Investment Initiative; Beef and Sheepmeat Fund; Scaling including R&D; HPSU Package. In addition, Enterprise Ireland leverages private sector investment in companies through its various Seed and Venture Capital supports which provide valuable investment capital to companies requiring major capital for growth. The competitive advantage created by the use of technology and innovation will be a key driver in achieving Irish economic recovery. Companies that undertake Research and Development and capitalise on innovation have shown a level of growth in trade and exports during recent years that demonstrates the value of technology, high calibre research and innovation activity. A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies —Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and cost efficiency and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place. Among the numerous measures that have been taken to help companies to achieve internationally high levels of innovation are: R&D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. Technology Centres have been established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology, bioenergy, IT Innovation, manufacturing technology, energy efficiency and food.  These centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research. The intention is to establish 16 centres in total by 2013. The Innovation Voucher Scheme is facilitating and encouraging enterprises, particularly small enterprises, to engage in research or development by availing of the services available in research institutions. 453 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2011. The total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened in 2007 is over 1,800. In 2011, 52 companies were given support under the Innovation Partnership programme   which provided funding of €9.9m to Higher Education Institutes to collaborate with companies. The recently announced New Frontiers Programme   aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's recently announced Action Plan for Jobs. The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6 — 8 week introductory course.  The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres. Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years largely through the SFI Centres for Science Engineering Technology (CSETs), Strategic Research Clusters (SRCs) and the Principal Investigator (PI) teams. At present SFI is supporting 28 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 19 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are involved in 1,305 industry collaborations with 583 distinct industry partners, both multinational and indigenous. Both in 2010 and 2011, IDA investments of over €500m and €700m respectively were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multinational sector. The initiatives being delivered by the enterprise agencies are supporting enterprise and are ultimately geared towards driving growth, sustainability, exports and job creation. Our objective is to continue to use research and innovation to build competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.
17577	SeanSherlock	Labour	14428.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	359	 The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of €55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe. FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  The Framework Programme enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research. This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities. The total funding secured by companies based in Ireland since the commencement of the Seventh Framework Programme in 2007 to November 2011, the latest figures available, is €87.8 million. The figure for 2011 was €25 million and the corresponding target for 2012 is €30 million.  Of the €87.8 million secured by companies based in Ireland, €66.4 million went to SMEs and €21.4 million went to multinationals based in Ireland. The European Commission, in its Fourth Monitoring Report on FP7, covering the years 2007 to 2010 and published in August 2011, states that, in one of the main funding programmes within FP7, Ireland has the highest participation rate of SMEs of the EU 27. This is the rate of SME participation in FP7 compared to the population of SME's in the country.  EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013, and which has a budget of €3.6 billion.  Unlike FP7, funding under the CIP does not go directly to companies; almost 50% of the funding is via European Investment Fund (EIF) Guarantees which are provided to financial intermediaries, and the remainder is used to fund actions such as best practice exchanges and provision of information networks through the Enterprise Europe Network.

17596	SeanSherlock	Labour	14440.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	509	 Fáilte Ireland does not issue licences to run caravan or camping parks but is responsible for maintaining a register of such parks and for setting the minimum standards for registration.  It is illegal under the Tourist Traffic Acts for parks which are not registered to describe themselves as caravan parks or camping parks or a number of further protected titles.  To qualify for registration, parks must consist of 20 or more pitches and must comply and be operated in accordance with all the statutory requirements of local and other authorities including planning, health and safety, water supply, sewage disposal and fire precautions.  Only when parks meet these and the other minimum requirements set by Fáilte Ireland can they be registered as Caravan and Camping parks. However, it is not illegal under tourism legislation for a facility to operate once it does not describe itself using one of the protected titles and Fáilte Ireland has no statutory role in monitoring such facilities.  These facilities may in some cases be operating in contravention of other statutory requirements, e.g. planning, health and safety, fire, etc. In that regard, such potential breaches should be taken up with the appropriate authority, e.g. the relevant Local Authority with regard to possible breaches of planning regulations.  As registration of such parks is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, I have referred the Deputy's question to them for further information and direct reply.  If you do not hear from the agency within ten working days, please contact my private office.
17597	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	108	 The scheme will not be debated.  Best practice is to lay schemes before the Oireachtas and not to engage in debates on individual schemes.  I cannot accept amendment No. 2, the purpose of which is to have the scheme debated.  On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, clearly indicated he was unwilling to engage in a further full-blown, policy-based discussion on the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme when presenting it to the Oireachtas.  The time for policy-based discussions is during the presentation of Bills to the Oireachtas, not on the presentation of secondary legislation.  I understand Deputies were offered the opportunity to contact officials from the Department in the interests of discussing the draft scheme.  I am not sure whether, to date, any requests in this regard have been received.  To my knowledge, they have not but the matter is open to clarification. The operator of the scheme is currently running workshops with the banks.  The target date for going live with the scheme is August.  As soon as the Bill is enacted, we will be in a position to try to ensure we meet this target. Many of the arguments that have been put forward by Opposition spokespersons were also put forward in the previous debates on the Bill.  The Minister has been definitive in the context of replying to those arguments.

17600	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	114	 There is no precedent which would prevent the scheme, once it is up and running, being debated by the committee.  There is no lack of clarity on my part or that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in respect of that matter.  The Bill before the House is enabling legislation and the scheme is the subject of a procurement exercise.  There were actually two such exercises carried out in respect of the scheme, one for the design consultant and the other for the operator.  The Deputy is a former Cabinet Minister.  He would have had control over policy in the various Departments in which he served and he knows exactly how the game is played in respect of these issues.  He is also aware we are obliged to comply with the timelines relating to public procurement. It took time to draft the legislation and deal with the various technical details involved.  However, this was necessary to ensure we got it right.  The process is all but complete and we want to ensure we will be in a position to roll out the scheme in August.  If the committee wants to discuss the scheme thereafter, there is absolutely no issue in that regard. That is a given.  It is a fundamental democratic principle that the committee be given that opportunity.
17601	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	117	 Without being disingenuous, I apologise to the Deputy if he found my remarks personally hurtful, although an element in my brain tells me his skin is thicker than he might let on.
17602	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	119	 The Deputy knows that when I say we know how the game is played, I mean there is a process and a system in place.  I was speaking in a metaphorical sense.  We are moving to ensure we can put the scheme in place and expedite it as quickly as possible. The scheme must be targeted towards commercially viable businesses.  We are conscious that businesses have failed in the last while.  That is why we are anxious to get the scheme up and running before the fall of the year.  Business that are in trouble will not, necessarily, be supported by the scheme.  An application must be viable and accompanied by a business plan, with potential projections for the business. The figure of 2% had to be charged, in line with state aid requirements.  In tabling amendments opposition Deputies must have regard to this.  State aid rules must be adhered to.  We must be cognisant of this in order that when we communicate our respective party positions on the Bill, the public will be made aware that the 2% charge is not being imposed simply for the sake of levying a charge.  There is an onus on us to do this.
17603	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	 It is important to answer the point.  A charge had to be made under State aid rules.  We all accept that premise.  That is fact.  The decision was for 0.8% upwards.  The Government chose 2% as the most appropriate rate because one must allow an appropriate figure to be able to cover losses contributed to by administrative and other costs.  One must factor that in.  We are dealing, essentially, with taxpayers' money and we must factor in a potential figure for those losses and 2% was deemed to be the most appropriate figure in that respect. I have just been handed a note on the progress fund.  We do intend to approach the European Investment Fund, EIF, re support for the microfinance fund.  That will be introduced in the Houses in the coming weeks.  There will be progress in that regard.  Perhaps we can communicate with the Deputy on that particular issue as well.
17604	SeanSherlock	Labour	14441.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	124	 I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already given a commitment that there would be a review of the scheme after a year of operation.  It would be right and proper that a review would take place.  As a matter of course one would have to review the scheme and I believe the Minister's commitment is sufficient. One could argue that there may not be sufficient data, patterns or trends emerging on the type of lending that arises from the scheme before a 12 month period has elapsed.  That is the justification for the Government's decision in that respect.  However, the commitment has been definitively given by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in that respect.  The review will be broad and comprehensive and will not be restrictive as per the amendment suggested.  The policy commitment is to conduct a review and to lay it before both Houses.  The matter is adequately dealt with in section 10. Invoice financing will be eligible for the scheme.  We will monitor closely the performance and we will consider if other types of credit should be included, as per Deputy O'Dea's point.  We will make changes if we deem it necessary following the review.  We are trying to ensure that we get the scheme off the ground, put a review mechanism in place after 12 months based on qualitative criteria and then if modifications or adjustments need to be made there is an open mind in government on the matter.

A scheme of this nature will be vital in providing the credit necessary to fund businesses which are the backbone of the economy.  In this light, it would be ridiculous not to review the scheme after a certain time.  It is important that it be reviewed.

17618	SeanSherlock	Labour	14442.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	40	 The aviation market in the EU was fully liberalised in 1992 and the operation of the internal market is governed by common rules which were updated in 2008 and are set out in EU Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 which is directly applicable in Ireland and other Member States.  Therefore airlines are not subject to regulation in areas such as the setting of fares, other charges, routes to fly, etc.  and the decision to charge a passenger for the transport of a musical instrument is at the sole discretion of each airline.  Furthermore, European Regulations in the area of airline operations allow airlines to establish their own procedures for the stowage of baggage and cargo, subject to certain conditions relating to safety and security.
17619	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	353	 I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on the Department's behalf and more than 82 million km are covered annually.  In the region of 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The current system for determining eligibility for school transport at post-primary level has been in place for more than 40 years.  When the Government announced the introduction of free post-primary education in 1966, the country was divided for planning purposes into geographic districts, also referred to as catchment areas.  Each area had several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools.  Post-primary pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 km or more from their local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which they live.  The definition of school transport catchment boundaries has been the cause of many submissions and representations to the Department over the years.  It is widely considered by many that the current catchment boundary areas do not reflect changed demographics.  Changes in the post-primary school transport scheme were announced in the 2011 budget.  This was passed in December 2010 under a different mandate. One of the changes to take effect from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year means that the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering a post-primary school.  From this date, school transport eligibility for all new pupils entering a post-primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre, having regard to ethos and language.  This will applied equitably on a national basis.  In general, eligible pupils, who are currently availing of school transport and who meet the distance criterion of 4.8 km, will retain their eligibility for the duration of their post-primary education, provided there is no change in their current circumstances.  Pupils who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the scheme.  The general approach of the Department in respect of the planning of school infrastructure is to plan on the basis of attendance of pupils at their nearest primary schools and that those primary schools then feed into attendance at the nearest post-primary schools or the nearest post-primary centre generally.  The changes announced in post-primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result in a more efficient and cost-effective system.
17620	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	359	 Deputy Smith takes an innovative view of how the Topical Issues debate should be utilised in respect of lobbying for the new school.
17621	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	361	 That is a lateral and imaginative view.  I respectfully suggest that the Deputy should table a parliamentary question or discuss the issue with the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  It has been noted on the record of the House.  There may be individual vagaries relating to counties Tipperary and Cavan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, has specific responsibility for this area.  He is not averse to hearing the individual views of the Deputies in respect of the vagaries of the system as they work out in the two constituencies. However, we must emphasise that, to allow parents ample time to consider the school options, a 20-month gap was allowed between the announcement of this measure and the time when parents needed to apply for school transport.  Children who wish to attend the same school as their older siblings but who are not eligible for school transport to the school may apply for transport to the school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  These changes were posted on the Department's website in October 2011 and the updated scheme was made available on 1 February 2012.  The Department contacted post-primary schools directly on two occasions in addition to the relevant education partners formally advising them of the changes. With regard to the impact of the changes, the Deputy may be aware that, as part of the value for money review, an examination was conducted of selections of school transport catchment boundaries which tested the application of an arrangement where the transport is available to the nearest post-primary centre.  This concluded that 82% of the pupils are attending their nearest post-primary school. In general, existing eligible children will retain their eligibility for the remainder of their post-primary education provided their circumstances do not change.  The revised eligibility criteria are confined to those families who have children newly entering post-primary school.  This change in eligibility is being applied equitably on a national basis and, in some cases, pupils in the same area or family may be eligible for transport to different schools during the transitional period of five years.  In these cases, transport and the concessionary basis may be an option.
17622	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	 I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I understand the issues involved concern the outcome of a tendering process for the running of a bar in Terminal 1 of Dublin Airport.  The Dublin Airport Authority has confirmed that the tender process for the outlets in question was conducted through the Official Journal of the European Union's system for public procurement and was fully compliant with all guidelines.  The tender documentation for the outlets in question stated that transfer of undertakings legislation may apply and advised potential tenderers to seek advice on such legislation. The restructuring currently under way at a number of outlets is a matter for the operators in question.  I am not privy to the details of transfer or the parties involved.  One cannot but have sympathy for those involved in this dispute.  Without fudging the issue and in seeking to give an honest answer to the Deputy, I must suggest firmly that industrial relations machinery needs to come into play on this issue.  I hope both sides will agree to a process in which such machinery can be utilised to come to a resolution that is satisfactory to both. I have to hand a very detailed response on the rights of employees in regard to transfers of undertakings but I do not believe it is necessary to read it out.  However, I strongly support the idea that labour relations machinery should be utilised in this instance.  I would be very surprised if there has not already been a move in that regard.
17623	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	 I agree with everything Deputy Lyons has said.  Let us be frank and honest about it.  The issue at hand here is one of corporate social responsibility, a term we bandy around from time to time and can use quite easily.  If there is a transfer of undertakings here, as Deputy Lyons stated, it says something about the morality of the company.  There is a strong sense here of an obligation on the part of SPP, where it has taken over a facility in what is, effectively, a State entity, to ensure the rights of the workers are vindicated or at least that there is a recognition of the experience of the existing staff who go into the new undertakings. In this instance, though we recognise that no law has been broken, there is a certain corporate social responsibility.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that the extensive machinery of the State in labour relations could be applied in this instance. It is important that these issues are raised on the floor of this House also.  It sends a signal back to these entities that these matters are being looked at by Government and that there is a consciousness in this House of the issues Deputy Lyons raises.
17624	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	456	 In February, we debated the budget measures in regard to teacher staffing schedules for schools.  The debate over the past two evenings has been a rerun of that debate.  While Deputy Flanagan's Bill is well intended, it is fundamentally misconceived.  I do not say that in a disrespectful way.  The proposals the Deputy advances would keep schools open even if there were not enough pupils to sustain them.  Therefore, the Government will be opposing this Bill. The value-for-money review of small primary schools, currently being finalised in my Department, should be available after the summer recess.  The review is simply about evaluating all the facts to inform future policy in this area.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, will publish the review and bring it before this House so we can have a wide-ranging and properly informed debate on its outcomes and proposals.
17625	SeanSherlock	Labour	14455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	459	 We should bear in mind that one third of public sector employees in the State work in the education sector.  It is, therefore, not possible to exempt staffing in education completely from the Government's need to reduce expenditure.  This is particularly the case at a time when the school-going population is increasing.  There will be more difficult decisions in the next budget and the one thereafter.  The very favourable staffing provision for small schools was put in place when resources were plentiful, at a time of demographic dividend when enrolments were falling. The Government rejects the claims that are being made about closing small schools.  The Opposition had been predicting wholesale closures of schools in the debate in February.  Five schools have indicated their intention to close over the coming school year.  Last year, there were three closures, and the year before there were four.  All that is changing for small close schools is that, from next September, their average class size will no longer be as advantageous as it once was.  The schools will still exist. I have listened to some alarmist claims about the threat of school staffing schedule changes affecting the very fabric of rural areas.  When I hear Deputies from Dún Laoghaire and south Dublin, and the great burghers of Dún Laoghaire and the great middle classes, lecturing me and the Government on the plight of rural Ireland-----

We represent the very people in question and are doing our best to defend, when we can, the rights of the schools concerned.

17639	SeanSherlock	Labour	14456.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	330	 The Government's strategy in relation to funding research and development in Ireland through Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is to foster the long term development and competitiveness of enterprise and industry in the State.  SFI was established to build a world class research capability in support of this strategy, and the Foundation has been successful in building human and physical research infrastructure over the past decade such that Ireland has ascended the international rankings for research in a number of disciplines. Consistent with Government policy, as detailed in the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, the new Intellectual Property Protocol and the Advisory Science Council's Report on the Sustainability of Research Centres, SFI is seeking to build upon the groundwork already put in place by continuing to invest in excellent research and by engendering greater impact from its funded research for the benefit of Ireland. In this context, legislation is in preparation to enable SFI to fund applied research in addition to its existing remit to fund oriented basic research.  This will not result in the abandonment of its funding of oriented basic research but is aimed at supporting the further development of ideas and new knowledge towards commercialisation. Given Ireland's current circumstances there is a need to accelerate the delivery of economic and societal benefits from our investment in research by prioritising resources in areas of opportunity, building closer collaboration between the research base and enterprise and making it easier to commercialise and use new knowledge.  However, we recognise that we cannot sustain this without maintaining the world class research base that we have built over the past decade.  Therefore we must succeed in both maintaining our research base and accelerating the delivery of the benefits of this investment at the same time and within the resources available.
17640	SeanSherlock	Labour	14456.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	331	 The Board of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) appointed Professor Mark Ferguson earlier this year following an extensive international recruitment process. Professor Ferguson has an extensive track record over the past three decades in both the academic and commercial spheres.  Upon joining SFI, Professor Ferguson, as required of all employees, signed the Code of Business Conduct for Employees which sets out in written form the agreed standards of principle and practice which inform the conduct of staff members of SFI.  Incorporated within this Code is an obligation upon the individual to disclose to the Board Secretary any matters that could give rise to a conflict of interest as soon as that conflict becomes apparent.

17643	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	213	 The microenterprise loan fund will facilitate the growth and expansion of all viable microenterprises from all industry sectors across the country that have been refused access to credit from the banks.  It is a key element in our Action Plan for Jobs.  The fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus to encourage all would-be entrepreneurs across the country who may be unemployed but who have the potential to generate employment for themselves and others.  It will not have geographical quotas but will be of particular help to persons who are unemployed who would have much greater difficulty accessing conventional sources of bank lending.  It will be promoted through a range of networks across the country, including local bodies that support business start-up for people with fewer resources, and in areas of high unemployment.  It will not be confined to businesses with export potential and will be more within the reach of unemployed persons who target business opportunities within their own local communities.  It will form an important complementary element and add value to schemes of support, such as the back to work allowance.  Support will be in the form of loans, rather than grants. Loans will be made available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  It will ultimately be for enterprises to apply for the loans so it will be demand-led in that sense.  It is envisaged that mentoring will be an important element in the success of the fund.  Delivery of business supports including business planning and mentoring to facilitate successful credit applications will be facilitated through the national network of existing bodies and agencies.  The county and city enterprise boards are often the first port of call for business support and advice, and they will be actively involved in the promotion of the microfinance fund across the country.
17644	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	215	 The scheme is currently being finalised and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy refers to a unique case.  There is a code of practice in the scheme whereby a decision must be made within two weeks or 15 days - I will have to check the exact timeframe.  The core principle of the microenterprise loan fund is that even in good economic circumstances the risk criteria might not be met by a certain coterie of people, such as the person to whom the Deputy referred.  They might be credit-worthy but they do not fit within the banking criteria.  The fund is designed for people in that position.  Given that the local bodies will then feed into that process, one hopes there will be a fit solution for such people so they will not have to incur massive administrative costs to be able to access the fund so they can start their businesses.
17645	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	217	 It will be within two years.
17646	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	223	 I am bringing in a series of targeted initiatives to make it easier for micro-enterprises and small and medium enterprises to access credit.  The micro-enterprise loan fund scheme, which is expected to be operational from early autumn, will facilitate up to €40 million in additional lending to micro-enterprises over the next five years.  The Government is in the process of introducing the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme for micro-enterprises and small and medium enterprises which, because of a lack of collateral or the sector in which they operate, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. These initiatives coupled with the recently launched second call under the innovation fund and the development capital scheme will strongly contribute to addressing the credit needs of business and facilitate business modernisation and expansion, in addition to the creation and maintenance of jobs. Furthermore, the Minister recently met the CEOs of the two pillar banks to impress upon them the importance of keeping their lending practices in tune with the changing needs of Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the banks to develop credit propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth - start-ups, early stage and mature companies - and to adopt cash flow lending as opposed to the asset-backed approach that has been the norm in recent years. My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and ensure the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention. My colleague, the Minister of State responsible for small business, Deputy Perry, continues to meet business owners on a regular basis to hear at first hand their views and experiences and to examine further the actions that might be taken to improve access to credit for SMEs.
17647	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 The Deputy referred to ISME's report, but there is also a Mazars report.  The Credit Review Office, CRO, is our benchmark, but should not be viewed as a permanent fixture.  According to a figure in the Mazars report, a demand survey showed that only 36% of SMEs sought credit in the April-September period.  As the domestic economy recovers and SMEs seek to increase working capital, the demand for lending will increase and two factors will point to CRO assistance being required.  The ultimate aim is to drive credit through the system
17648	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 The relatively poor capital and liquidity conditions of some SMEs following three years of a flat-lining domestic economy is one of the factors.  Some of the SMEs that bank with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, will seek new credit and will need to be moved to new banks.  If those banks are unwilling or unable to provide that credit when the upturn arrives, it will be another factor.  If the Deputy will bear with me, I am looking for the figures.
17649	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	233	 The economic management council, EMC, engages with the banks to ensure that they deliver.  The Deputy must acknowledge that they have delivered on their 2011 lending targets.  I am struggling to find the figures on the percentages in terms of credit.  They were to hand.
17650	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	235	 The report compiled by the accounting firm Mazars showed that 67% of completed credit applications were approved by the banks, representing an increase of 2% on the previous year's report, with the rate of refusals falling by a corresponding amount of approximately 28%.  Despite the downturn, the report indicates that some companies are still in a position to protect their finances from potential problems. It is important that we give ISME, the small business community and its other representative organisations their due regard, but it is also important that we be objective in our interpretation of the figures.  If one drills into the figures, one will realise that some of the results in the survey to which the Deputy referred were based on media perceptions of credit.  It is important that we assess the qualitative criteria.
17651	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	248	 The cloud computing implementation group held its last formal meeting in March 2012 and submitted a report on its work on 14 June 2012.  I have asked my Department to prepare targets and measurements based on the report's key findings which will allow us to monitor progress to ensure we maximise the potential of this important area of the ICT sector. In conducting its work, the group examined the opportunities and challenges presented by cloud computing for both business and government from the following perspectives: the cloud as a source for exports, growth and jobs; the adequacy of key infrastructures; the regulatory environment; the opportunities and benefits for indigenous enterprises; the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment; and government as a leader and user of the cloud.  The group's work was informed by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in the Department convening more than 20 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies in September and October 2011. Considerable insight and information was gained during the process and this is being examined to assess the best way forward and the practical steps that can be taken to optimise the potential of cloud.  In the meantime, a number of other initiatives related to cloud computing are under way, including under the action plan for jobs.  These include the €1.2 million initial research programme in the cloud computing technology centre announced in April, which is aimed at helping to make Ireland a world leader in this fast growing area and at making a significant contribution to jobs and economic growth.  The initiatives also include the ICT skills action plan, which was launched earlier this year and includes the provision of courses relevant to the skills required for the cloud computing industry.  The National Standards Association of Ireland, with the assistance and support of the Irish Internet Association, IIA, has developed the SWiFT 10 guide, which is aimed at businesses of all sizes considering the adoption of cloud computing. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. In addition, the Data Protection Commissioner has placed information on its website which will be useful for businesses moving to the cloud, with an obvious emphasis on the data protection issues related to such a move.  I understand the public sector strategy on cloud computing is close to finalisation in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will be published shortly.
17652	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	250	 Yes.
17653	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	252	 Yes.
17654	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	254	 I agree with everything the Deputy has said.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is engaging on its usefulness for reducing costs in the public sector and there is much concentration on this in the wider public sector.  Membership of the group varies from people involved in industry to those in the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We all realise its value and we know who in industry operates in this sphere, for example EMC in my area.  There is a strong sense the cloud computing strategy can set new targets for investment in digital media and the Internet when one considers existing opportunities for technology companies and new and emerging areas.  We will marry with this the potential for data centres and the consideration of Ireland for potential inward investment for these.
17655	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	256	 The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has specific responsibility for this area.  I do not know whether the Deputy has engaged with him on this matter, but I suggest he does so because he would get a definitive answer on what we are doing with regard to broadband. For the purposes of addressing the issue of the potential of cloud computing, I realise certain businesses operating in certain geographical areas will face challenges and there is no question about this.  We will spend €1.2 million on an initial research programme and a cloud computing technology centre.  With regard to the potential of this area, we are looking at hitting global research targets and pitching Ireland's potential globally.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has adopted the SWiFT 10 guide and I would like to find out how many businesses are aware of this at present.  If we can build consciousness about the potential of cloud computing in tandem with meeting the challenges with regard to broadband we will be doing well in terms of meeting global measurements.
17656	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	258	 If the Deputy is concerned about a specific course I would welcome further information on it and I am happy to speak directly to him on this matter.  Cork Institute of Technology, in tandem with industry, has developed a specific course on this.  Mr. Bob Savage of EMC is on the governing body of CIT so one is confident this course has large industry buy-in.  If the industry has problems with or concerns about courses we need to hear about them.
17657	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	264	 The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work scheme.  The aim of the action plan for jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers.  The long-term unemployed are a priority target group for the measures in Pathways to Work. While many of the new measures included in the action plan for jobs are not confined to those who are long-term unemployed, they will be of particular relevance to their needs.  For example, the microenterprise loan fund will provide funds for people who wish to start businesses in their local economies but have been refused credit by the banks.  Other measures such as the Revenue job assist scheme, which is used by employers to take on persons who are long-term unemployed, are being promoted both by extension of the coverage of the schemes in the Finance Bill and through the dissemination of information.  The employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme has been simplified and extended.  This scheme provides exemption from the payment of employer PRSI contributions for 18 months when a qualifying unemployed person is recruited. Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and back to education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has announced 1,000 additional places on JobBridge this year.  The Department of Education and Skills will provide more than 450,000 education and training places this year across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors, including through the Springboard programme.  More than 3,500 people have graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, recently announced a further 6,000 new places on the programme for 2012.
17658	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	267	 We all acknowledge that over the past years this country has gone through major restructuring in terms of how the economy works.  The Minister already stated that if all the eggs are in one sector and if it fails, it has a monstrous effect on the economy.  We are trying to put in place a set of programmes which will allow people to upskill and retrain, so that we have a skillset.  I mention the number of construction jobs alone which were lost.  The only way we can get people back into the workforce is to upskill and retrain them but that does not happen within one, two or three months.  We must allow time for that to take effect. All sides of the House must acknowledge - let us be apolitical about this - that we have provided incentives on the Revenue side and on the employer side and we have allowed for credit to be made available through the micro-enterprise partial loan guarantee scheme.  The Government is actively intervening to try to stimulate the economy and to create the right conditions. I take the point made about the cost to business and a reduction in the regulatory burden.  I would acknowledge that we need to do more on EU targets in terms of the cost of the regulatory burden but I would also say there is a discussion at Cabinet level in regard to local authority funding and the cost to business at local level.  Local authorities cannot continue to rely, in the way they have done, on the ratepayers who have been squeezed in terms of funding local government.  The Cabinet is discussing this issue.  However, one must acknowledge that because of the tidal wave which hit us as a result of the collapse in the construction sector, in particular, which had fuelled the economy, we had to restructure the economy on macroeconomic grounds and put in place these types of programmes which do not bear fruit in the timeframe about which the Deputy spoke.  It will take longer. Written Answers follow Adjournment.
17659	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	270	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 16 together. In November 2011 the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, TD, announced a new Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) to encourage individuals currently or formerly in employment to establish new business ventures. The changes introduced by the Minister for Finance included a widening of the types of companies eligible under the Scheme. This widening of the scope of the scheme removed the requirement for certification by Enterprise Ireland. The scheme provides for a refund of tax already paid by an individual who sets up and takes employment in a new qualifying business. The scheme, which is operated by the Revenue Commissioners, who have details on their website, allows for promoters of qualifying start-up companies to claim a rebate on investments made in their new enterprise based on the individual's income tax payments for the previous 6 years.  The individual claiming relief must be a full time employee or a full time director of the company. In the past entrepreneurs/investors seeking to avail of this tax relief had to seek certification from the relevant State agency supporting their sector. Enterprise Ireland, along with other Government Departments and bodies, was responsible for the provision of certificates in respect of certain qualifying trading operations. I understand that since 2003, under the initial Seed Capital Scheme Enterprise Ireland issued approximately 335 Seed Capital Certificates.  This corresponds to the number of applications for such certificates made by clients of EI.  The issue of a certificate by Enterprise Ireland did not guarantee, and did not imply, that Revenue would approve a rebate under the Scheme. Communicating information on government and agency supports that are available to companies to foster growth and enable job creation has been at the core of the Action Plan for Jobs agenda.  Minister Bruton has, along with his ministerial colleagues, promoted a range of supports for business, including the Seed Capital Scheme at Action Plan for Jobs workshops across the country. Information on the Seed Capital Scheme along with other government supports is available on my Department's website under ‘Supports for Business for Job Creation and Productivity'. Similarly, Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBS) provide information on this and other Government supports via their websites and through regular engagement with their clients.
17660	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	272	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 37 together. The Development Capital Scheme as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs has been developed to complement the existing suite of financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland.  A range of other initiatives are already in place for the provision of capital at the early stage and scaling phases, and a clear market failure was identified in the availability of risk capital for established companies seeking to sustain growth and achieve greater scale. Longer-term investment capital is currently not readily available to Irish growth focused companies in either the form of debt or equity, and there is very limited private equity funds/debt available to innovative SMEs.  This situation has resulted in an equity gap, which is constraining the development of a key cohort of established Irish growth companies.  Development Capital can be defined as equity funding for the expansion of established and profitable firms, that is, those that have passed the start-up stage. The exchequer funding requirement for this scheme is €50m over 10 years.  It is proposed that EI will commit €25m each to two funds which will leverage a further €50m each from the private sector. Any fund investments supported by EI under this scheme would be made with the State sharing equally in the risks alongside other investors.  The proposed scheme will focus on funds that provide equity or quasi debt of between €2m to €10m per investment although it is likely that many investments would be in the €2m to €5m range. The Scheme was launched on the 12th April 2012 and a call was issued by Enterprise Ireland for ‘ expressions of interest’, from fund managers, with a closing date of 16th  July 2012, for receipt of expressions. Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with a number of fund managers, both local and international, regarding their interest in the scheme. On completion of the call, valid applications will be evaluated based on the published criteria and a recommendation made to the Board of Enterprise Ireland. The final commitment to invest will be made by the Board of Enterprise Ireland. Once the selected fund managers have raised sufficient capital to ‘close' their fund, funding under the Development Capital Scheme will be available to invest.
17661	SeanSherlock	Labour	14463.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	291	 There is a wide range of diverse supports for different types of research and development across a number of Government Departments and State Agencies. There are no plans, at present, to streamline application processes for this diverse range of R&D supports across all research funders. The application criteria for research in, say, medical devices would be very different from the application criteria for an energy project. However, in line with the recommendations of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group's Report, for the purpose of competitive calls for funding, research funding Agencies will be adapting their application process to the stage-gate process.  This means that research funders will consider how to assess relevance to, and impact on, one of the 14 priority areas of opportunity identified as likely to deliver economic and societal impact. While obviously recognising the need to allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate the outcomes required by specific programmes, it is envisaged that Agencies will ensure that relevance to the priority areas is one of the key criteria in assessing applications and in this way will ensure a degree of consistency across agencies. The stage gate model will not apply to in-company R&D funding. In addition, the Research Prioritisation Steering Group's Report recommended there should be coherence and a consistency of approach between funding programmes to reduce the administration burden on both agencies and applicants and also to allow for system level evaluations. Implementation of this recommendation will be considered by the Prioritisation Action Group in as part of its ongoing sequencing of reforms.

In accordance with the Strategy, Member States have adopted national targets on the basis of these headline targets, as set out in their National Reform Programmes, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances and Ireland's target in relation to R&D is as set out above. In light of current economic circumstances and participation in the EU/IMF Programme, Ireland's National Reform Programme, transmitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011, specified that Ireland's target in relation to expenditure on R&D is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP) by 2020.

17685	SeanSherlock	Labour	14470.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	690	 The mandate of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is to develop Ireland's human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavour relevant to the future competitiveness of Irish industry and enterprise.  It carries out this task by funding world-class research teams in our higher education institutions focussing on the areas of information and communications technologies, biotechnology and sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies. The core outputs of SFI's activities are the range of world-class research teams in place, with indicators of their international rankings, taking into account the extent of their linkages with other research groups and with industry partners and the amount of funding leveraged from other sources. While direct job support is not the core task of SFI, it should be noted that at the end of 2011 SFI funding was directly supporting 2,995 top-class research positions across Irish higher education institutions and these researchers leveraged €90m in non-Exchequer funding to Ireland last year. A major impact attributable to SFI has been, and continues to be, its underpinning role for the enterprise and job creation activities of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI). SFI funded research activities are focal points of attraction for foreign direct investment in Ireland whilst also assisting the EI client base to maintain and grow employment levels, and also enhance their sales and exports capacity. In 2011 the SFI funded research teams collaborated with 583 distinct companies, the majority of which are EI and IDA clients and which employ in excess of an estimated 82,000 people in Ireland. Over the past number of years the SFI investment has helped to significantly enhance IDA Ireland's new client wins capacity.  This can be evidenced by the fact that in 2004 the value of the foreign direct investment approvals achieved by the IDA that were research, development and innovation (RD&I) based amounted to €120m whilst the comparable 2011 level was €700m, a level nearly six times greater.  This is a significant indicator of the strong research capacity that SFI, along with other research funders, has helped to develop in Ireland in recent years. Through the quality of our human capital and the excellence of our research, Ireland has succeeded in attracting some of the most innovative companies in the world. For example: 9 of the Top 10 Pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations here. Similarly 15 of the Top 25 Medical Devices companies now have operations in Ireland; As do 8 of the Top 10 global Technology companies; and 10 of the world's top selling drugs are produced in Ireland. In terms of SFI activity in 2012, the capital funding provision of €156m this year will allow the Foundation to maintain its support to 28 top-class research centres whilst also supporting a cohort of approximately 3,000 researcher positions.
17686	SeanSherlock	Labour	14470.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	694	 This matter was formally reviewed by my Department through Forfás which commissioned an expert report by consultants Georgia Tech in 2001 to examine the case for Irish participation in a number of intergovernmental research organisations including CERN.  That Report concluded that because of high costs and limited industrial development returns membership should not be pursued at that time.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources which this Government inherited has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country — most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.  Ireland's membership of international research organisations is reviewed on a regular basis and in the case of the European Space Agency, for example, the value of membership in terms of support to Irish companies and researchers is considered to justify the costs of our membership. CERN is a major international project which deservedly has received much attention in recent weeks arising from major and exciting discoveries.  It is important to note that Irish researchers are not precluded from participating in and benefiting from the work being done at CERN.  In an ideal world, of course it would be desirable to be involved in this major project, based in Europe as it is.  The issue is whether we should divert very scarce, and in most cases committed funding, away from the areas that we had identified as having the best chance of contributing to our economic recovery.  The costs of full membership are understood to be over €10m per annum.  While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  Should budgetary circumstances change the matter could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost/benefit viewpoint.

17693	SeanSherlock	Labour	14533.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-09-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	205	 I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for raising this matter. The determination of selection criteria and processes for admission to medical schools is a matter for the universities and the medical schools in line with their statutory autonomy in academic affairs. A new entry process for admission to medical schools was introduced in 2009 on foot of a recommendation of the Fottrell working group on undergraduate medical education and training. The report of the Fottrell working group formed the basis for a programme of wide ranging reform and expansion of medical education and training in Ireland. These reforms also provided for an increase in the number of undergraduate places from 305 to 485 and the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme with 240 places annually. The report recommended that leaving certificate results should no longer be the sole selection method for entry to medical education at undergraduate level and that a two stage mechanism should be applied consisting of the results obtained in leaving certificate and a standardised admissions test which would assess non-academic skills and attributes regarded as important for the practice of medicine. The new entry mechanism, which was introduced by the medical schools in 2009, is based on a combination of leaving certificate results and performance in an independent admissions test, HPAT, designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills. At the outset the medical schools committed to a review of the new entry mechanism within three years of its introduction. On foot of this commitment, a national research group evaluating revised entry and selection mechanisms to medicine was convened under the auspices of the council of deans of faculties of medical schools in Ireland in 2009. The research group comprised representatives from the academic medical education staff of each medical school, university admission officers and the Central Applications Office. Several international medical education experts have advised the group and continue to do so. The research group has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation to determine the educational impact, reliability, validity and stakeholder acceptability of the new entry and selection approach. An interim report has recently been completed by the group and is due to be published on the websites of the medical schools in the next few days. I have been advised that the findings of the report of the research group will now be considered by the academic councils in the five institutions concerned. Approval of the academic councils would be required for any possible modifications to the operation of the admissions test.

17697	SeanSherlock	Labour	14533.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-09-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	213	 The report will be submitted to the academic councils of the institutions concerned for consideration. It is understood that the report will be considered by the academic councils before the end of the year, most likely in November or December. The implementation of any changes will be a matter for the institutions and their medical schools. More generally with regard to third level entry mechanisms, the Minister for Education and Skills has also received an interim report from the Irish Universities Association of their consideration of recommendations in the NCCA-HEA transitions report which was published last September. The universities have also established a task force to develop more specific proposals regarding changes to the entry criteria for third level programmes, which is also expected to consider issues relating to high points courses such as medicine. The task force is expected to complete this work by the end of the year. I respect the fact that the Deputy has raised these issues. Concerns are being brought to her attention and she has articulated them in the House. I am sure the Minister and I would be delighted to engage with her further on the question of Project Maths, or at least have officials engage with her. I am sure the Minister would be happy to sit down with her to discuss this area.
17698	SeanSherlock	Labour	14533.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-09-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	215	 I thank the Deputy for the tenor in which he made his contribution. I acknowledge that the latest quarterly national household survey, QNHS, figures show an increase in unemployment, but we never said recovery would be fast or easy. The Government inherited a jobs market in free fall with more than 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before we took office. That is not a political charge; it is a fact. At the peak of the boom, almost 24% of GNP was attributable to construction, 12% of total employment. The economy is in transition and since assuming office, we have delivered on the plan to build a new economy. Part of this is supporting a transition from the old failed economy based on property, banking and debt to a new sustainable economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation. The Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs, through the action plan for jobs, has direct identifiable targets that are addressed directly with the Taoiseach on a regular basis using that reporting mechanism. Part of that process involves the small business advisory group, which includes all of stakeholders, such as ISME and IBEC. They are part of the process of getting the recovery we so badly need. Deputy Calleary mentioned the skills shortage. There is a constant engagement with industry. I met with Google the day before yesterday to see how we could get a further engagement with such companies on the STEM area and that will directly feed into how we address the skills shortage. There are already programmes in play in terms of bridging courses but we must ensure there is a longer term policy goal that ensures we have a throughput of students from secondary into tertiary who are actively engaged in the STEM agenda, through courses such as Project Maths, so the right sort of software engineers and ICT graduates exist for the skills pool needed to sustain the economy in the longer term. Unfortunately, as part of the necessary transition, jobs continue to be lost in construction, banking and the public sector as these sectors return to more realistic levels. While the headline numbers out of work have risen in the latest returns, the CSO data show that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, there was a quarterly decrease of 3,700 in the number of persons unemployed in quarter two compared to quarter one, from 312,000 to 309,000. We are in a period of transformation of the public sector as a necessary step to managing our public finances in a better way. The number of employees in the public sector has declined by 25,800 or 6.3% in the year to June 2012 while the number of employees in the private sector decreased by 0.3% over the same period. This is an improvement on the decrease of 2.2% in those employed in the private sector in the previous year.
17699	SeanSherlock	Labour	14533.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-09-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	 The Deputy has stood where I am standing today and knows I will not be drawn on the budgetary process. Let me talk, however, about the EU Presidency. One of the central themes of the Irish EU Presidency will be job creation. There will be statements on Ireland's position on getting Europe to engage on this agenda in due course. The planning is ongoing and this week there was a Cabinet sub-committee on European Affairs where each of the Ministers and Ministers of State involved had an opportunity to discuss the EU Presidency and the core themes we want to ensure are at the forefront. Job creation and growth with the European economy will form part of that. I take the Deputy's point on the public utterances of Ben Bernanke on the US Federal Reserve. There is a different dynamic in the US because it operates on a federal basis. There is a challenge for a member state like Ireland to ensure greater EU co-ordination but it is the Government's view that the role of job creation must be to the forefront of the Irish Presidency. Horizon 2020 is a major pot of money, around €80 billion, that must be negotiated, along with the multiannual financial framework. There are many Irish companies that will ultimately benefit from that once it is negotiated. It will do more to inject further capital into the research and development arms of Irish companies and SMEs in particular to create those jobs that we want in the economy. There is much to be done on the macroeconomic side. I reiterate, however, that the action plan for jobs is a clear policy statement by the Government that involves all of the stakeholders, including small business, IBEC and so on. That will be a key driver for job creation in the future.

17708	SeanSherlock	Labour	14560.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	177	 I thank Deputy Butler for raising this issue. As a Government, we have moved decisively to restructure the banking system and ensure that it provides credit to the economy every year. We are also acting to fill gaps where specific market failures exist. The Deputy will be aware that the Department has introduced two targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit for small businesses into the economy. I attended the launch of the credit guarantee scheme this morning, which was presided over by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. The guarantee scheme will go live next Wednesday, 24 October, and is expected to provide an additional €150 million per annum in lending for small businesses over the next three years. Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the scheme. The guarantee scheme is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable micro, small and medium-sized businesses in two specific situations, namely, where businesses have insufficient collateral and where businesses operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar. It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. Each €150 million of additional lending under the scheme is expected to benefit over 1,800 businesses and create over 1,300 jobs. Another important initiative developed by the Department is the €90 million microfinance loan fund to address access to credit and support lending to the most vulnerable cohort of our SME sector, namely, microenterprises. Microfinance Ireland was launched on 27 September and has been open for business since 1 October. It will provide loans primarily to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. Loans will be for amounts of less than €25,000 and will be generally provided for business start-up costs, expansion costs and working capital. The thrust of the lending policy will always be focused strongly on the potential sustainability of the business, its ability to repay the loan and the creation and maintenance of jobs. It is intended that the fund will provide loans to some 5,500 microenterprises over time, resulting in the creation of approximately 8,000 jobs at a cost of approximately €2,500 per job, which is extremely good value for the State's investment, when referenced against foreign direct investment. To assist medium-sized business, we introduced the €150 million development capital fund scheme earlier this year. This will assist in increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the so-called equity gap experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in excess of €2 million. The development capital scheme is aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, Irish businesses with significant prospects for growth and job creation. Typical companies expected to benefit are those with in the region of 60-160 employees. Further work with the banks is continuing to adapt to the needs of the non-traditional sectors, such as the technology and emerging sectors. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth, including start-ups, early stage and mature companies and to adopt cash flow lending as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years. Knowledge sharing is ongoing, including reciprocal secondments from Enterprise Ireland directly into the banks, sector briefings and trade mission involvement. In addition, the Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention. I refer the Deputy to pages 68 and 69 of the third progress report, which speaks further to the issue raised by him.
17709	SeanSherlock	Labour	14560.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	179	 It is hard not to agree with the points made by the Deputy in relation the banking sector. A distinction must be made between businesses seeking to restructure loans in order to survive and retain their viability and loans generated for new business. I refer the Deputy to the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the third progress report which states that the Department of Finance published the SME lending demand survey in July. That survey of 1,505 companies shows that during the six month period surveyed demand for credit remained low, with only 38% of SMEs requesting bank credit between October 2011 to March 2012. The full survey and findings are available on the Department of Finance website. I take on board the points made by the Deputy in relation to the person referenced specifically by him. I believe the Taoiseach addressed that point today during Leaders' Questions. This is about driving new relationships between Enterprise Ireland and the pillar banks. The Economic Management Council has already indicated it will meet the pillar banks before the end of the year. There is no question that there is a sense the banks are not coming forward with proposals based on a lateral view of how to solve the problems of the person referenced by the Deputy who may have a viable business. The Government is trying to press home this point to the banks. There is a role for the Economic Management Council. The two initiatives, on micro-enterprises and the partial loan credit guarantee scheme, will create a new pillar of lending and will be government backed. This will have a knock-on effect on the SME sector of the economy.
17710	SeanSherlock	Labour	14560.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	181	 I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I thank the Deputy for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the position on the application for additional accommodation received from Millstreet Convent national school, County Cork. It is a co-educational primary school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to second class and for girls only from third to sixth class. I am aware the school had 218 enrolled pupils in September 2011 and that the current enrolment is 244 pupils, as the Deputy outlined. I understand the school expects enrolments to increase further next September 2013. On 5 October the Department of Education and Skills received an application from the school for the provision of one additional mainstream classroom and two learning support rooms to meet its current needs. In addition, the Department received a further application from the school on 15 October for major capital funding to provide additional mainstream classrooms to cater for the school's projected longer term enrolments. In this regard, the Department of Education and Skills will examine the demographics of the area concerned. The analysis will take into account results from census 2011, child benefit data for the area and an examination of current school enrolments with a view to establishing future accommodation requirements for the area. The school's applications will be assessed in the context of the Department's analysis of need in the area and a decision on the applications will be conveyed to the school authority subsequently. The Deputy will be aware that the five year programme which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced on 12 March 2012 will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which 80,000 will be new school places. The remainder will be the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation. Where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher, and where a school's existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, the Department considers applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms, mainly on a devolved basis. The delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.
17711	SeanSherlock	Labour	14560.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	 I note the Deputy's concerns in this regard and the points he has made on the school's developing school status. I reiterate that the Department will be in contact with the school when the demographic analysis in the area has been completed. If, through the good offices of the Deputy, the board of management was to contact me directly, I would be happy to engage with the school, subject to all of the criteria, particularly the budgetary criteria, laid down in that regard. Perhaps we can take a look at this with a view to solving the problem without giving any false hope at this stage. I would be happy to visit the school if such an invitation was extended to me. I am not making any promises but there may be ways around this. It is important that the Department has the opportunity to complete the vital demographic study.

17728	SeanSherlock	Labour	14567.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	429	 The Minister of State will agree that when the Government took office there was a real sense of hope that the changes promised by both the Labour Party and Fine Gael prior to the election would herald a change in the economic direction this State was taking. There is no doubt that the challenges facing the Government are significant, and no one will underestimate these. Our economic sovereignty has been handed over to outside forces by Fianna Fáil, a fact we should never forget. Some of the individuals who sit on the Fianna Fáil benches and lecture us in the Chamber are the very people who ruined this economy, bankrupted the State and drove large numbers of our citizens into poverty. Now they speak as if they had been sitting on the Opposition benches for the past 14 years. They take no responsibility for what they have done. As far as I am concerned, they have no morals, integrity or credibility. They implemented policies to serve their own selfish political agenda and for no other reason, a fact we should never let them forget. Some Fianna Fáil members who have left the House live on huge pensions while the policies they implemented have forced many of our people into income poverty, mortgage debt and tough decisions over whether to put food on the table or pay an electricity bill. That is Fianna Fáil’s legacy. Some of its Members who preach to all sides in the Chamber should take a long hard look in the mirror and think before they open their mouths. As we now approach the second budget of this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, people are beginning to lose hope that it will bring about the changes it promised. Some commitments in the programme for Government have already been reneged on, such as that of tackling upward-only rent reviews. The longer this goes on, the more despondent people become. It is the responsibility not just of the Government but of the Opposition to put forward credible alternatives and give those suffering in our society some sense of hope. Most countries that go through a recession recognise the importance of education and will protect funding for the sector. They recognise it has a key role in the recovery of any economy and in ensuring young people and those on the dole are given the skills and training to get them into employment and contribute to economic recovery. The Minister of State will be aware there was a protest earlier today outside Leinster House by several teacher unions at which they voiced their concern and disgust at the number of cuts to the education sector in previous budgets. The change to the income of new-entrant teachers is having a detrimental effect on morale. Many of them are now faced with the prospect of earning significantly less than teachers who entered the profession two years ago. Given that these are the individuals we are asking to assume responsibility for educating the next generation of citizens upon whom we will rely for recovery of the economy, it is a shame the Government has seen fit to target their incomes. It is a detrimental step and one for which we will suffer in the longer term. It also shows the lack of importance of education for the Government. For the forthcoming budget, the Minister for Education and Skills has said up to €77 million will have to come out of the education budget. Over the next two years, the total reduction will come to €147 million. This figure excludes cuts announced in last year’s budget, such as the multi-annual reduction in capitation grants. These types of cut will impact on the quality of education provided in our schools and universities. There is no way of skirting around this issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will agree with that, although he may not say it publicly. The Minister for Education and Skills has said he is doing everything he can to ensure front-line services are protected. However, it is just not possible to take that amount of funding out of an education budget without affecting front-line services or the quality of education provision. I have no doubt the Minister has a tough job and is facing some significant challenges in the sector. However, it is not just his responsibility to protect education. It is the responsibility of all members of the Cabinet to put a special emphasis on the protection of the education budget. That is the budget that has a potential impact on our opportunity to regain our economic sovereignty. Schools are now being forced to ask parents, who are already facing really hard choices in their own personal finances, for voluntary contributions to balance their budgets due to cuts to capitation grants. I have seen letters from schools, particularly primary schools, in Cork asking parents for their children to bring in basic essentials such as toilet roll and hand-wash. They are also asked to take home unfinished lunches and parings from pencils because the schools cannot afford to empty their bins. I implore the Government to ensure the education budget is protected in the forthcoming budget. If the planned cuts of €77 million go ahead, there is no doubt the cost of sending kids to school will increase, and this cost will have to be borne by already hard-pressed parents struggling to make ends meet. It should be remembered they will also face cuts in other areas such as social welfare. I hope the Minister of State will highlight to his party colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the need to ensure the education budget cuts are tempered as much as possible.

Over the next two years, the total reduction will come to €147 million. This figure excludes cuts announced in last year’s budget, such as the multi-annual reduction in capitation grants. These types of cut will impact on the quality of education provided in our schools and universities. There is no way of skirting around this issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will agree with that, although he may not say it publicly. The Minister for Education and Skills has said he is doing everything he can to ensure front-line services are protected. However, it is just not possible to take that amount of funding out of an education budget without affecting front-line services or the quality of education provision. I have no doubt the Minister has a tough job and is facing some significant challenges in the sector. However, it is not just his responsibility to protect education. It is the responsibility of all members of the Cabinet to put a special emphasis on the protection of the education budget. That is the budget that has a potential impact on our opportunity to regain our economic sovereignty. Schools are now being forced to ask parents, who are already facing really hard choices in their own personal finances, for voluntary contributions to balance their budgets due to cuts to capitation grants. I have seen letters from schools, particularly primary schools, in Cork asking parents for their children to bring in basic essentials such as toilet roll and hand-wash. They are also asked to take home unfinished lunches and parings from pencils because the schools cannot afford to empty their bins. I implore the Government to ensure the education budget is protected in the forthcoming budget. If the planned cuts of €77 million go ahead, there is no doubt the cost of sending kids to school will increase, and this cost will have to be borne by already hard-pressed parents struggling to make ends meet. It should be remembered they will also face cuts in other areas such as social welfare. I hope the Minister of State will highlight to his party colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the need to ensure the education budget cuts are tempered as much as possible.

There is no doubt that the challenges facing the Government are significant, and no one will underestimate these. Our economic sovereignty has been handed over to outside forces by Fianna Fáil, a fact we should never forget. Some of the individuals who sit on the Fianna Fáil benches and lecture us in the Chamber are the very people who ruined this economy, bankrupted the State and drove large numbers of our citizens into poverty. Now they speak as if they had been sitting on the Opposition benches for the past 14 years. They take no responsibility for what they have done. As far as I am concerned, they have no morals, integrity or credibility. They implemented policies to serve their own selfish political agenda and for no other reason, a fact we should never let them forget. Some Fianna Fáil members who have left the House live on huge pensions while the policies they implemented have forced many of our people into income poverty, mortgage debt and tough decisions over whether to put food on the table or pay an electricity bill. That is Fianna Fáil’s legacy. Some of its Members who preach to all sides in the Chamber should take a long hard look in the mirror and think before they open their mouths. As we now approach the second budget of this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, people are beginning to lose hope that it will bring about the changes it promised. Some commitments in the programme for Government have already been reneged on, such as that of tackling upward-only rent reviews. The longer this goes on, the more despondent people become. It is the responsibility not just of the Government but of the Opposition to put forward credible alternatives and give those suffering in our society some sense of hope. Most countries that go through a recession recognise the importance of education and will protect funding for the sector. They recognise it has a key role in the recovery of any economy and in ensuring young people and those on the dole are given the skills and training to get them into employment and contribute to economic recovery. The Minister of State will be aware there was a protest earlier today outside Leinster House by several teacher unions at which they voiced their concern and disgust at the number of cuts to the education sector in previous budgets. The change to the income of new-entrant teachers is having a detrimental effect on morale. Many of them are now faced with the prospect of earning significantly less than teachers who entered the profession two years ago. Given that these are the individuals we are asking to assume responsibility for educating the next generation of citizens upon whom we will rely for recovery of the economy, it is a shame the Government has seen fit to target their incomes. It is a detrimental step and one for which we will suffer in the longer term. It also shows the lack of importance of education for the Government.

17739	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	 I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who is travelling to Brussels on Government business. I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter. A new, fully centralised student grant application system was launched on 11 June and is being operated by a central grant awarding authority, the Student Universal Support Ireland, which is known by the wonderful acronym SUSI and which has been established as a unit of the city of Dublin VEC. Until last year, students applied to 66 local authorities and VECs for grant assistance. This is the first time the centralised approach has been taken in the history of the State. Deputies are aware of the difficulties with which these bodies had been dealing with the major increase in numbers applying for student grants in recent years. The new facility automates and replaces the previous manual application arrangements with a centralised online system application for all new grant applications nationwide from this academic year onwards. The system has been designed in such a way as to guide students interactively through the application process. Under the old system, the majority of third level students were paid by cheque, a costly and inefficient way of making payments. Under SUSI, students will be paid monthly directly into their bank accounts. This leads to all SUSI grant applicants in an institution receiving payments in the same way, by electronic funds transfer. SUSI has received in excess of 66,000 completed applications for student grants this year. Some 18,000 applications are complete, including 9,000 applications that have been refused and 9,000 applications that have been awarded or awarded pending submission of final course details by the student. In addition, SUSI is awaiting documentation from students for 21,000 applications. The remaining 27,000 applications are on hand for processing. SUSI is aiming to award and pay all successful applicants before the end of December, which represents a significant improvement on the previous system in many parts of the country. To date, some 6,528 new students have been awarded maintenance or fees only grants. A maintenance grant has been awarded to 2,190 students, and some 3,729 students are awaiting a maintenance payment. The payment of the student grant is contingent on the supply of bank account details by the student, together with confirmation of registration from the institution attended. Payments for new students commenced on 19 October, and SUSI will continue to run weekly payments during November to ensure students receive their first payments as soon as possible. It is inevitable that a late rush of applications will cause delays in a student grant processing system and the subsequent payment of student grants. My Department is continuing to monitor the situation in close consultation with SUSI, which is working with the Union of Students in Ireland to encourage students to submit outstanding documentation. SUSI is also constantly seeking to improve the information available online and from its helpdesk, e-mail and telephone services.
17740	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	 SUSI is awaiting documentation on 21,000 applications. Some 15,000 students have not responded to requests for documentation and a further 6,000 have submitted incomplete documentation. I acknowledge the remaining 27,000 applications are on hand for processing-----
17741	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	 No amount of rhetorical flourish, rhetoric or nonsense from a Fianna Fáil Deputy will change the fact that SUSI has the administrative responsibility for the area.
17742	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	 There was broad political support for the idea of having one centralised system because of the lag times, which were even later within the 66 local authorities heretofore. In the first year of the roll-out of the new system, one always gets glitches-----
17743	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	 -----but the main point is that students eligible for grants will be paid. There is no question about it. The Department brought in the USI as a stakeholder in the process to act as a moderator on www.boards.ie to engage with students through the process.
17744	SeanSherlock	Labour	14580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	 I take the points made by the Deputies that 27,000 applications are outstanding and should be expedited. An additional 20 staff members are processing the documentation received from students, and extra staff have also been assigned to SUSI head office to work on continually improving the processes and speeding up processing times. I ask for common sense to deal with this calmly and rationally, not to seek to score political points. The system will change and, unless the Deputy opposite is saying we should unravel the system and go back to the 66 local authorities, we should continue to improve the system. That is what we are doing.

17751	SeanSherlock	Labour	14581.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	445	 I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who is travelling on Government business. A number of developments will impact on teachers in VEC schools during the coming school year. First, the commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 will prohibit the payment of people employed as teachers in recognised schools unless they are registered with the Teaching Council. I take the Deputy's point in this regard. The second major development will be enhanced requirements from April 2013 for registration with the Teaching Council as a further education teacher. The requirement for registration will be increased from a degree-level qualification to a requirement to hold a teacher training qualification in addition to an undergraduate level award. Individuals without recognised qualifications who were employed in a teaching position or eligible to be employed in a teaching position in a recognised school at the time of the establishment of the Teaching Council in 2006 were deemed registered with the Teaching Council in its first year. Teachers were advised at the time to seek registration with the council and to ensure that their registrations were maintained. If such people availed of this entitlement at the time and subsequently maintained their registrations, there is no change to their position. A dispensation was given at the time and there is no basis for it to be given again. It has been the policy of the Department of Education and Skills for some time that only qualified and registered teachers should be employed by schools. Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the posts for which they are proposed. Since 2006, any unregistered person employed by a VEC in a teaching post has been on notice that, once section 30 became law, there would be no basis to continue paying him or her. Therefore, such persons can have no reasonable expectation of continued employment beyond the period of time that it takes the school to source a registered teacher. It is expected that section 30 will be commenced later in the school year. This will ensure that only registered teachers are employed in teaching positions in our schools. Separate provision will be made for urgent situations where no registered teacher is available. Notice of the imminent commencement of section 30 and the Teaching Council's registration requirements has been in the public domain for some time. Sufficient time has been available for individuals to engage with the Teaching Council to gain registration. It is the Government's view that all teachers should be appropriately qualified. This is surely the minimum that our children deserve. The commencement of section 30 is intended to buttress that policy and will be to the advantage of ensuring a quality education for all.
17752	SeanSherlock	Labour	14581.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	447	 I respectfully assure the Deputy that I am working from a prepared script because I want to allow him the time-----
17753	SeanSherlock	Labour	14581.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	449	 I know, but I want to internalise what we are saying. Given that this is a technical issue, it is important that my reply be carefully scripted. The position is clear. We understand that some people in the mainstream primary, post-primary and post-leaving certificate, PLC, space, such as the gentleman to whom the Deputy referred, have contracts of indefinite duration and are employed in place of teachers. Where such an individual has been employed in an unqualified capacity since 2006, has allowed his or her registration to lapse and has taken no steps to become qualified in the intervening years, it will be a matter for that person to decide whether to take an approved, unpaid leave of absence to gain the necessary qualifications for registration. As long as he or she remains unregistered, his or her capacity to be paid as a teacher in the public sector will be limited to the kind of short-term unforeseen employment which will be permissible under the ministerial regulations. From 1 April 2013, under the Teaching Council registration regulations 2009, the threshold for entry on the registry will increase in all categories of registration. Since the Department has already set registration as a requirement for employment in the above circulars, this higher threshold applies automatically in terms of employment from 1 April next independently of the section 30 requirements. The commencement of section 30 will reinforce the Department's longstanding position that education in recognised schools funded by the State must be delivered by appropriately regulated professionals. I do not think anybody would argue against that. This position must be maintained in the interests of providing the best possible education for the very students about whom we are talking.
17754	SeanSherlock	Labour	14581.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	451	 I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn. The fact the Deputy raised it gives us an opportunity to clarify the current position in regard to the application for additional accommodation at Lanesboro community college, Lanesboro, County Longford. I am aware that enrolment at the school on 30 September 2012 was 176 mainstream students and 25 post-leaving certificate students. Enrolment at September 2011 consisted of 167 mainstream students and 65 post-leaving certificate students. This reveals a slight increase of nine mainstream students but a reduction of 40 post-leaving certificate students for the 2012-13 school year. In November 2011, the VEC submitted an application for capital funding to the Department for a major extension at Lanesboro community college. However, the Deputy will be aware that in view of the very real need to ensure that a child has access to a school place, the delivery of essential mainstream classroom accommodation will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The VEC subsequently submitted a revised application that focused on the need for classroom accommodation along the lines of the case outlined by the Deputy. To assist with the assessment of the school's further application, an inspector visited Lanesboro community college in September. On the basis of the inspector's visit, the Department approved funding to construct two permanent classrooms at the school. This decision was conveyed to County Longford VEC on 17 October 2012 and a formal letter setting out the level of grant and the conditions associated with the grant aid was furnished to the VEC today, so the Deputy's timing is impeccable. County Longford VEC has expressed satisfaction with the grant approved. The responsibility for delivering the project has been devolved to the VEC and it will now be a matter for it to progress the project through the various stages from architectural planning to construction. The Department's letter of approval contains guidance that will assist the VEC in this regard. I thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the application for capital funding for Lanesboro community college.

We should stick to our guns on this matter.

I sincerely thank him for raising this matter.

17763	SeanSherlock	Labour	14601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	 The Deputy is the best proponent of talking down the clock.
17764	SeanSherlock	Labour	14601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	 Since the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, the issue of abortion has once again become dominant in Irish politics. It is a double tragedy that it should take the death of a young woman to again focus minds on the requirement to protect women and to address the unresolved legal issues but the need for greater legal clarity has been there for a long time. Disgracefully, that need has been neglected by successive Governments. This Bill seeks to provide legal clarity. It may not be the required answer but Sinn Féin believes that it should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage where it can be amended, as appropriate, and we will vote accordingly. Legislation can now be addressed in light of the Report of the Expert Group on the Judgment in A, B and C v. Ireland, the publication of which I welcomed earlier. The report reminds us that, in the A, B and C v. Ireland case, the ECHR found that Ms C's right to private and family life had been violated contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court held that there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law. That, in a nutshell, sets out the need to legislate. The report sets out options for the provision of lawful termination of pregnancy in circumstances where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother which can only be avoided by a termination of the pregnancy. This is the core of the matter on which we have to provide as much legal certainty as possible. From the report’s analysis of the options, it is clear that primary legislation is required and that regulations alone will not suffice. The detail of the report will require careful scrutiny in the days ahead, for example, to assess if a combination of primary legislation and regulations would be preferable to primary legislation alone. A first reading of the report makes clear that what is most likely required is both primary legislation and regulations. A careful balance will have to be struck between making legislation too prescriptive and leaving too much to be dealt with by regulation. It is absolutely crucial that the Government acts speedily on the report. As an immediate next step, the Government should allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage. That is our sincerely held view. It will then be up to the Government to determine when Committee Stage will be taken. This can be done in consultation with all parties and any number of amendments can be brought forward to make the Bill fit for purpose. We are willing to play our part in all of that. We should not have to wait another six months for legislation to present and be enacted. As an Opposition party, Sinn Féin is willing to co-operate with the Government and all parties and voices in the Oireachtas to achieve the best outcome and the stated outcome, which is the protection of women in all circumstances that can present and the provision of certainty for medical practitioners where legal certainty is required.

17776	SeanSherlock	Labour	14610.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-12-06 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	436	 There are two Sinn Féins on this island - Sinn Féin in the Six Counties and Sinn Féin in the Twenty-six Counties. They preach one message in the South and another in the North. I do not understand Sinn Féin's vehement opposition to a property tax in the South, as it does not appear to oppose it in the North where it is in government and where the average household pays approximately £1,000 per annum. If Sinn Féin is so vehemently opposed to property tax, why has it not rolled back on that tax in the North? In October, Sinn Féin nodded through the Welfare Reform Bill in the North, which will have the effect of permanently reducing the North's £5.1 billion benefits bill. I do not understand why Sinn Féin did not block that in the North, as it is in the Executive.

I also acknowledge the presence of Deputy Kevin Humphreys. I will convey the points Deputy Ó Ríordáin makes to the Minister for direct reply. Notwithstanding the shocking events to which he referred, we should remember that, week in and week out, the Garda successfully brings people involved in gangland activities before the courts and secures convictions. A substantial number of gangland criminals are serving prison sentences. As I stated, I cannot comment on the details of the case the Deputy raises. The Minister will continue to pursue important improvements to the overall legislative architecture. In this regard, the legislative priority for combating crime is the publication and enactment of a new criminal justice (forensic evidence and DNA database system) Bill. This Bill represents a major step forward and will be important in the fight against serious crime. It will lead to the establishment for the first time of a national DNA database and give the Garda access to intelligence on a scale and of a quality that were not previously available. This is welcome news. Despite the constraints on public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place. These must be seen in the context of a programme of real reform being delivered by the Garda under the Croke Park agreement. The Garda has the Minister's full confidence and I am sure that every Deputy would acknowledge its achievements in tackling serious and all other forms of crimes and its continued work on behalf of our community. Regarding the activation of people on the ground, social enterprise and the education system are important, as the Deputy knows from his involvement in his community. Being a rural-based politician, I know that this is a question of educating young people at an early stage and community leaders getting as many people as possible involved. This week, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, announced her plan to return 10,000 people to work. I hope that the jobs budget will have this result for people who are currently unemployed and are being retrained, upskilled and so on. Activity is the best approach. The social enterprise agenda is being enacted in every community and is undoubtedly relevant to the Deputy's constituency. It must be supported. We must support facilities for community involvement. One cannot beat the role of communities and the volunteers therein. The State cannot do this alone. Rather, a partnership between people and State agencies is necessary. It will undoubtedly make a difference. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, will reply to the Deputy directly on the issues that have been raised. I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I also thank Deputy Kevin Humphreys for his attendance.

This is welcome news. Despite the constraints on public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place. These must be seen in the context of a programme of real reform being delivered by the Garda under the Croke Park agreement. The Garda has the Minister's full confidence and I am sure that every Deputy would acknowledge its achievements in tackling serious and all other forms of crimes and its continued work on behalf of our community. Regarding the activation of people on the ground, social enterprise and the education system are important, as the Deputy knows from his involvement in his community. Being a rural-based politician, I know that this is a question of educating young people at an early stage and community leaders getting as many people as possible involved. This week, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, announced her plan to return 10,000 people to work. I hope that the jobs budget will have this result for people who are currently unemployed and are being retrained, upskilled and so on. Activity is the best approach. The social enterprise agenda is being enacted in every community and is undoubtedly relevant to the Deputy's constituency. It must be supported. We must support facilities for community involvement. One cannot beat the role of communities and the volunteers therein. The State cannot do this alone. Rather, a partnership between people and State agencies is necessary. It will undoubtedly make a difference. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, will reply to the Deputy directly on the issues that have been raised. I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I also thank Deputy Kevin Humphreys for his attendance.
17784	SeanSherlock	Labour	14610.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-12-06 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	438	 I thank the Deputy again on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I also acknowledge the presence of Deputy Kevin Humphreys. I will convey the points Deputy Ó Ríordáin makes to the Minister for direct reply. Notwithstanding the shocking events to which he referred, we should remember that, week in and week out, the Garda successfully brings people involved in gangland activities before the courts and secures convictions. A substantial number of gangland criminals are serving prison sentences. As I stated, I cannot comment on the details of the case the Deputy raises. The Minister will continue to pursue important improvements to the overall legislative architecture. In this regard, the legislative priority for combating crime is the publication and enactment of a new criminal justice (forensic evidence and DNA database system) Bill. This Bill represents a major step forward and will be important in the fight against serious crime.

17821	SeanSherlock	Labour	14651.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	289	 I welcome the opportunity address the House on this important issue. I am a graduate of the College of Commerce in Cork so I have first-hand knowledge of the important experience people gain within the post-leaving certificate sector. From personal experience I am aware that at a particular stage in one's life one may not be entirely sure of the direction one wants to take. The PLC sector fills an important gap and allows people to take some time and pursue courses while they decide on the ultimate direction they wish to take, both academically and in their working lives. I have always been grateful for the experience I gained from my time at the College of Commerce in Cork, particularly as it afforded me the opportunity to take the time to make the decision to pursue my education further by proceeding to the university sector. I place these facts on the record of the House because it is important to convey to people the fact that there is an understanding of the importance of the PLC sector. We do not want to pay lip service to that sector, particularly as we are conscious of its progressive nature in the context of affording people the space to decide to proceed to achieve even further educational or vocational attainment. Ultimately, it can also facilitate them in the context of career attainment. I wish to focus on the position in respect of Cork. I do not wish to be overly parochial but I do want to discuss the impact this cut will have in County Cork. I am only too well aware of the level of focus there has been on the level of reduction in the two Cork VECs. At present, there are just under 5,400 PLC places available at City of Cork VEC and Cork County VEC. This represents a significant tranche of the overall number of such places throughout the country. There are 316 staff at the two VECs. The VECs are expected to have the same number of places available and 284 staff from next September. This is, by some margin, one of the biggest allocations of PLC places and staff in the country. It is only right that a county as important as Cork should have such a high level of resources available to it. The Department sanctions the teaching posts to the VECs which, in turn, allocate them to the schools and colleges under their remit. As the changes will not take effect until September, the VECs have the opportunity to plan how best to deal with a slightly reduced allocation. I know there has been concern that the most innovative courses, particularly in cloud computing, veterinary nursing and computer programming, are at risk. We acknowledge this. However, that is the challenge every principal of a college of further education will have to manage carefully with his or her CEO. With the Government and colleagues in Cork, I will work closely with the CEOs and local principals to ensure the breadth of course provision is maintained, particularly in the cutting edge areas that are so vital to our economic recovery. This should include examining whether similar courses offered in more than one college can be merged to ensure niche offerings are maintained. Teacher allocations should not be fixed in isolation in each college. A joined-up approach to course delivery and necessary redeployment within each VEC area is absolutely vital. I welcome and acknowledge the fact that within one week of the budget announcement last month the Minister met personally all of the CEOs and chairpersons of the VECs. He asked them to ensure the changes that had to be made would have the minimum of risk for front-line services in so far as was possible. I support that approach fully. This reflects the Minister's awareness of the good work of the PLC sector in the education system. We now have a nine-month window of opportunity to ensure the changes required are made carefully and with appropriate consideration. My priority remains to ensure all those using further education services in Cork and other areas can access the courses that will help them to up-skill and eventually find employment. Deputies on both sides of the House constantly say we have to look to other parts of the education system if further adjustments are needed. We share that sentiment and that is precisely what the Government has done in this instance. One of the measures announced in the budget will see the teaching allocation in PLC colleges increased by two points from 17 to 19. This will have the effect of bringing the pupil-teacher ratio in post-leaving certificate colleges which teach motivated adults into line with that in second level schools. This will provide for equity. We acknowledge, however, that it will result in the loss of 200 full-time teaching posts across the sector. However, we must support a strategy of prioritisation at a time of reduced resources. Having a more preferential pupil-teacher ratio in PLC colleges than in second level schools is not sustainable. I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. It is entirely appropriate that we highlight the importance of the further education and training sector, both as part of the education system which promotes the concept of lifelong learning and as part of the country's future in terms of re-skilling and upskilling of citizens, particularly for those who are unemployed. While it would be preferable not to have to make any reduction, the Government has sought to protect front-line education services to the greatest extent possible through the protection of class sizes in free primary and second level schools and the protection of the overall numbers of special needs assistants, resource teachers and the staffing allocations to disadvantaged DEIS schools. Because of rising demographics and the protection provided in the budget for current teacher allocations, this will mean that we expect to hire an additional 450 primary teachers and 450 second level teachers for the next school year. It is worth reiterating the point about rising demographics and the economic pressures on the Department's budget. We must ensure sufficient numbers of primary and second level teachers to plan for the rise in the population. Despite the economic climate, the Government has shown its strong commitment to protecting and investing in education and creating employment for teachers. It is also worth reflecting on the record of the party opposite during its last term of office in education-----
17822	SeanSherlock	Labour	14651.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	291	 I have never been in government before.
17823	SeanSherlock	Labour	14651.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	293	 Almost 4,450 posts in primary and post-primary schools have been taken out of the education system since 2008. The vast majority of the work done was carried out under budgets constructed by some of the Members opposite. In that time there was an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools from 27 to 28. There was an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools from 18 to 19. There was also the removal of eligibility for student support grants from those in receipt of the back to education allowance, the allowance that helps many in the PLC sector. VTOS allowances were removed for those pursuing post-leaving certificate courses in 2010.
17824	SeanSherlock	Labour	14651.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-16 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	295	 The party opposite changed the favourable pupil-teacher ratio of 17:1 to 19:1 for the leaving certificate vocational programme in 2011 in order to secure a reduction of approximately 200 posts which was justified at the time by saying it would bring it into line with the normal pupil-teacher ratio in second level schools. I refer to the withdrawal of resource teachers for Traveller children at primary and post-primary level in order to secure a reduction of approximately 600 posts in 2011. I refer to the announcement of the elimination of 500 language support teachers from primary and second level schools in 2011, not to mention the elimination of the posts of primary rural co-ordinator and visiting teacher for Travellers. We are starting from a base where the country is borrowing €300 million a week. Nobody wants to preside over a situation where teachers lose their jobs. We are trying within the education budget to ensure the courses delivered for those who want to retrain and upskill will be provided within the VEC structures. We seek to do this to the best of our ability. It is necessary, therefore, to effect the savings required. I am the beneficiary of accreditation. I have a diploma in business studies which I acquired through the College of Commerce in Cork. I have first-hand experience of PLC courses which assisted me in the not too distant past and assists others in a way that allows for progression to take place. Notwithstanding the loss of these teaching jobs, if CEOs work with us and a lateral approach is taken, we are confident that the new and highly innovative courses which allow people to progress to universities and institutes of technology can be preserved in a way that will allow for progression through the system. It is vital to ensure pupils will have that opportunity to come into the PLC system in a manner that it will cater for their needs as they progress through their careers.

The Department is committed to promoting healthy lifestyle choices among children and young people. This is reflected in the curriculum for primary and post-primary schools. The successful active school flag, ASF, programme also provides evidence to the effect that schools are keenly interested in ensuring that their students have positive attitudes to physical activities. However and as the Deputy articulated, there is only so much that schools can do. There is an onus on parents and the community to ensure that children are as active as possible outside of school. The Department recognises the importance of cultivating healthy attitudes in children. This is reflected in the primary school curriculum for science, physical education and social, personal and health education, SPHE. Pupils are enabled to develop an understanding of food and nutrition, including the importance of food for energy and growth and the importance of a balanced and healthy diet along with being physically active. In post-primary schools, the SPHE syllabus contains modules on healthy eating, and physical education promotes activity. The popular optional subject, home economics, also has a role to play. On 4 October 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, published a framework for the junior cycle. One of the principles of the framework is well-being. This principle will be underpinned by key statements of learning that require students to understand the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices, to be confident and competent participants in physical activity, to be motivated to be physically active and to take action to safeguard and promote their well-being and that of others. A new short course in SPHE is being designed for 100 hours, some 30 hours longer than the current programme. The Department seeks to recognise schools that strive to achieve a physically educated and active school community by awarding them the ASF. More than 1,000 primary and post-primary schools have registered for an ASF. To date, 156 flags have been awarded with the number expected to rise significantly during the coming year. Through the ASF process, schools have developed many innovative and exciting ways of encouraging their school communities to become more active. In cultivating healthy eating attitudes in children, the 2009 life skills survey of primary and post-primary schools showed that 87% of the primary schools and 32% of the post-primary schools that took part in the survey operated a healthy eating policy. The life skills survey was repeated in 2012. It is hoped that the percentage of schools, particularly at post-primary level, with a healthy eating policy will have improved. The results will be published later this year. The Department of Health and my Department collaborate and co-operate on a number of relevant areas, including healthy eating. The Department of Health has involved this Department and others in developing Healthy Ireland, a report that is to be published shortly. My Department is also a member of the Department of Health's special group on obesity, which is meeting today.
17838	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	317	" I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has stated. He is spot on in trying to raise levels of consciousness around this issue. The Department of Education and Skills is part of the Department of Health's special group on obesity. Deputy O'Donovan illustrated an example of a child with digestives. The child did not pack the lunch box and neither did the teacher. It was the parent. Schools act in loco parentis and by their very nature will do so much. I refer, for example, to the activity around the active school flag for which 1,000 primary and post-primary schools have registered. A total of 156 flags have been awarded which shows that there is a rising consciousness on the issue. If the green flag initiative is anything to go by then I have no doubt that this will be just as successful in terms of raising awareness. However, there is a role for parents as well, and for community and teacher involvement. Technology is one way of raising that kind of awareness. Deputy O’Donovan referred to the post-Christmas rush to purchase new gear and to get exercise. We all have post-Christmas guilt. I downloaded two applications, apps, one called ""Run Keeper"" and the other ""Map my Fitness"". Such apps will help to modify people’s behaviour. I accept the Deputy’s point but I firmly believe there is a stronger role for parents, and we speak a little to common sense. I am happy to talk to the Deputy again on the matter to see whether we can progress the issue in the wider context of reducing the level of obesity. There must be a role for the Parliament through the committee system or intra-parliamentary group to examine the issue. That could be one way of seeking to tackle the issue."
17839	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	 Job creation is a key priority for the Government. Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. The 2013 action plan for jobs will set out detailed targets for important measures of economic transition and for the delivery of policy actions to support employment, enterprise, innovation and exports. It will include indicators such as job creation in agency supported enterprises, the number of high potential start-ups to be supported in 2013, the target for new foreign direct investment projects and the number of significant investments by Enterprise Ireland-assisted firms in a range of areas, which are critical to company growth and job creation. Considerable resources are being committed to the task. Our Department's Exchequer capital allocation for 2013, including carryover of unspent moneys from 2012, amounts to €483 million gross. At a time of severe restraint in capital resources, this demonstrates the Government's commitment to enterprise development and jobs. We have also developed innovative instruments to leverage up the impact of this capital expenditure to support job creation through our Department and its agencies. These include the provision of €175 million in Exchequer funding through the seed and venture capital scheme. This funding has a target to leverage €525 million in line with past experience. An additional Exchequer allocation of €25 million is being provided under the development capital scheme in 2013, targeted at mid-sized indigenous firms. The Government committed €50 million to the scheme in 2012 and this funding will leverage up to €225 million. The Department will also continue to roll out and monitor the €90 million microfinance fund and the €450 million credit guarantee scheme, which again leverage smaller Exchequer outlays. Additional information not given on the floor of the House In a similar vein, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF has developed a range of support funds for the SME sector to provide equity, credit and recovery investment. The NPRF will invest between €350 million and €500 million with a view to creating a total funding pool of at least €850 million for investment in SMEs. In addition, a new package of tax measures to support SMEs was outlined by the Minister for Finance in budget 2013. It is important, however, to recognise that the economic transition is not solely about the volume of Exchequer resources aimed at the enterprise sector. Equally important in the 2013 action plan for jobs will be the reforms which we are continuing to implement on an ongoing basis to enhance our competitiveness, improve the environment for business, support enterprises, and progress sectoral strategies. The 2013 plan will be published in the coming weeks, following approval by Government.
17840	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	329	 As the Minister has said, the Government must create a set of conditions that facilitate growth in employment rates. I am not aware of any Government having set an employment rate target. I am not aware of a precedent for that. The Deputy referred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF. It will be used to support the SME sector and provide equity, credit and recovery investment. The NPRF will provide up to €850 million on a commercial basis with a view to leveraging private sector funding into the Irish investment market. The Government is creating conditions such as a 25% increase in the threshold for VAT cash receipts basis accounting to improve cash flow for SMEs. It is doubling the amount of expenditure that qualifies for the research and development tax credit for SMEs so that we can support more innovation by businesses. That will have a positive impact on foreign direct investment. It is extending the foreign earnings deduction scheme to support exporting companies to develop a presence in new key markets. The economic transition is not solely about the volume of Exchequer resources aimed at the enterprise sector. We must give equal importance to the reforms that will result from instigating a range of measures to enhance our competitiveness, improve the environment for business and create the jobs that are so necessary. There are IDA and Enterprise Ireland targets. Because of the constraints of time here in the House I would be happy to talk to the Deputy about those targets. He is welcome to come to the Department for a briefing any time.
17841	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	 Deputy Tóibín says we are not allocating sufficient resources. The seed and venture capital scheme has €175 million of Exchequer funding. The NPRF will spend approximately €850 million, which will be available for investment in the Irish SME sector. The IDA has an allocation of €86 million for 2013. Its targets are set out in its Horizon 2020 programme. We have allocated €120 million to Enterprise Ireland. It has clear targets to support high potential start-ups. There are innovation programmes, new technology centres and spending on technology transfer within our universities. There is €69.5 million for enterprise supports. There are Graduates for International Growth, additional Lean programmes and engagement with 300 first time exporting companies. Local enterprise offices have been established at local level. If Deputy Tóibín wishes to critique the Government's allocation of resources on each of those specific processes I would like to give more time to hammer it out with him and see where Sinn Féin thinks we should allocate more resources and taxpayers' money in creating jobs.
17842	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	385	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 13 together. The rise in youth unemployment as a result of the global economic downturn is a challenge for most EU countries. The average EU unemployment rate for those under 25 years of age in the labour force is 23.7%. In Ireland, the youth unemployment rate is 30%, while the long-term unemployment rate is 8.9%. The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain jobs. All of the measures in the action plan are designed to promote employment opportunities in different ways and many young people and long term unemployed people will benefit from the implementation of these measures. Many of the sectors we have focused on supporting under the action plan, such as digital gaming, ICT and tourism, offer opportunities particularly suited to younger workers. Labour market activation programmes administered by other Departments, such as JobBridge, Springboard and Tús also aim to increase youth employment. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has worked with business representative bodies to highlight the range of supports available to companies who recruit people from the Live Register. These include Revenue’s job assist scheme and the employer’s PRSI exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection. The Department of Social Protection also operates the back to work enterprise allowance for long-term unemployed people wishing to set up their own business. Measures to support micro-finance and mentoring are particularly important to people who have been out of the labour market for some time or to young entrepreneurs who do not yet have a track record. As part of a suite of measures aimed at improving access to credit for SMEs and entrepreneurs under the Action Plan for Jobs, we have established the Microfinance Fund targeted at entrepreneurs, start-ups and existing microenterprises employing not more than ten people. The County and City Enterprise Boards provide a range of services, including training and mentoring, to people wishing to set up their own business, including those on the live register. Enterprise Ireland also has a range of funding supports available for entrepreneurial activity. For example, the agency launched New Frontiers, Ireland’s largest entrepreneur development programme in February 2012. It supported 60 companies through the Competitive Start Fund last year and also introduced a new Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs. Through the new Momentum initiative, the €20 million labour market education and training fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills will assist 6,500 long term unemployed jobseekers to gain skills and to access work in sectors of the economy where there are job opportunities. This initiative includes specific provision for those under 25 years of age. The Government as a whole will continue to do all it can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs or to get their first job. In addition to the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government’s Pathways to Work strategy is focused on assisting the long-term unemployed to move into employment through more regular engagement, upskilling and training. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context, we will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation to support these groups of unemployed people.
17843	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	387	 I acknowledge everything that the Deputy said. There is no getting away from the fact that the rate of youth unemployment is extremely high, including across all of Europe. A strong attempt is being made during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council to give effect to the youth guarantee and to ensure that we create the climate across Europe, in a way that will benefit Ireland, to ensure a return of people to work. The Momentum scheme was launched before Christmas last under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills. There will be specific projects available under that programme to assist those aged under 25 years in a return to employment through training to work opportunities and a graduate activation programme.

17845	SeanSherlock	Labour	14659.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-01-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	392	 Again, I acknowledge the points made. The Deputy must also acknowledge the deep structural changes that gave rise to this unemployment crisis which, as stated by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in a reply to an earlier question, was our dependence on construction, in which sector many of the skills were employed. A sudden downturn which results in one having to make a correction of the order of €38 plus billion over a five or six year period requires one to find new ways to create labour market activation measures. We believe we are succeeding. For instance, many jobs have been created through the JobBridge scheme. I heartily acknowledge that there is a crisis in the area of youth unemployment.

17861	SeanSherlock	Labour	14678.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	 I thank Deputy Doherty for raising this important matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets he is unable to be present as he is in Dublin Castle in his capacity as Minister for Defence. I can inform the Deputy that on 19 June 2012, the Minister published a report on the criminal justice aspects of the cash for gold trade, which was prepared by his Department. The Minister has formally requested the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to consider the content of the report, obtain the views of all relevant interested parties and make such report and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the Government as it deems proportionate and appropriate in the public interest. The Minister understands that the committee has sought views from stakeholders and he is awaiting receipt of the committee's report following the conclusion of the committee's deliberations. In publishing that report, the Minister noted the concerns that members of the public had expressed about the proliferation of cash for gold outlets throughout the State. The informal purchase of jewellery is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation. However, the circumstances under which jewellery is being bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, such as handling of stolen property or possession of stolen property under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. The report indicated that these provisions were adequate to deal with any such offences that may be committed in the cash for gold situation. The report also highlighted the actions undertaken by An Garda Síochána in consultation with the Minister's Department. All cash for gold premises in the State were visited by An Garda Síochána and the operators made aware of their responsibilities and obligations under the law with regard to the purchase of gold and other items of jewellery. Garda contact information provided to operators will facilitate the reporting to the Garda Síochána of any suspicious activity. The Minister, in publishing the report, congratulated the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána for his prompt and proactive response to this matter. The Minister has stated that it is arguably inconsistent that there are specific rules and regulations that apply to pawnbrokers for the protection of the public and to assist the Garda while similar appropriate and adapted rules and regulations do not apply to cash for gold outlets. It is in this context that the need to explore the issue of evidence of ownership of gold and jewellery items, such as photo ID and other evidence of ownership mentioned by the Deputy, is referred to in the report and no doubt will be the subject of attention in the course of the Oireachtas committee's consideration of the issue. There is a requirement to examine carefully the resource implications of any role envisaged for An Garda Síochána in proposed new regulatory steps. In addition, in framing any necessary measures in respect of cash for gold shops, it is important to ensure consistency in their application in so far as they would also apply to other retail outlets that may trade in second-hand gold items, such as jewellery and antique retailers. However, the Minister is of the view that it is important to avoid creating unnecessary form-filling, expense and bureaucracy for legitimate businesses that makes no significant contribution to law enforcement or the protection of the public generally.
17862	SeanSherlock	Labour	14678.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	 I ask the Deputy to forgive me for having a prepared response because the Minister is not present to respond. On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputy for availing of the Topical Issue procedure for raising this important issue. I assure her, on behalf of the Minister, that her constructive remarks and suggestions will be noted. The Minister looks forward to the Oireachtas committee's response to the issues raised in his departmental report on the cash for gold sector. With regard to burglaries, the Minister welcomes the progress being made by An Garda as part of Operation Fiacla, which is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven. As part of the operation, specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders. As of 21 January 2013, 3,903 persons have been arrested and 2,142 persons have been charged as part of the operation, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him. Furthermore, the latest quarterly figures for burglary, by comparison with those prior to the operation's introduction, suggest the operation is having an impact. While it is clearly no consolation to those who have had to endure dreadful experiences at the hands of gangs of burglars, it is none the less important to mention that the most recent crime figures show that the number of aggravated burglaries has decreased by over 17% on the previous 12 months. The Garda response to such crimes is robust, and gangs and individuals involved in burglaries are pursued with determination and effectiveness. With regard to cash for gold operations, it is important that there be a targeted, proportionate and balanced response by the Government to ensure opportunities for criminals to obtain cash for stolen gold and other precious metals are eliminated while not affecting legitimate trade because of the criminal actions of a few. The Minister has indicated that the objective of any actions must be to ensure such businesses are not unknowingly open to abuse by criminal elements.
17863	SeanSherlock	Labour	14678.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	 I thank former Senator McAleese and his team for producing this report. I completely accept its findings and believe the women and their stories. This is a sad chapter in our history. I thank Deputy Calleary for tabling the motion but we would not be discussing the matter tonight if the Taoiseach had acted properly last week when he had the opportunity to apologise unreservedly to all the women concerned and their families. He could have apologised on behalf of every man, woman and child in this country. He has a mandate as Head of Government to issue such an apology. He failed to grasp that opportunity, however. When one compares the utterances of the Minister for Justice and Equality as Opposition spokesman with what he says now, one cannot but think he is playing politics. The report was delayed and took longer than expected to complete, even though only a small minority of the women were interviewed. As senior departmental officials were on the committee of investigation, they did not have to wait to read the report. The Government should have been man enough to apologise before the report came before us. I salute the undying dignity of the Magdalen survivors and welcome those who are in the Gallery tonight. It behoves us to introduce a proper redress scheme, pay pensions for the labour they carried out and look after their rights and housing. Our State does not have a good record in dealing with sensitive cases like these. We all proclaim to be horrified at the mistreatment of children but not long ago nearly every Deputy except me took part in a referendum and a charade in which the Supreme Court found that the Government stole €1.1 million of the money allocated for a proper referendum campaign. Nothing has changed. We might say we are in modern Ireland but slavery and ill-treatment of young women and boys are ongoing. We cannot be washing our hands as if we are all new people with new thinking. This is going on under our noses and the Government is complicit in it. It is not acceptable that mandarins in the Department of Justice and Equality could tie the Taoiseach up in knots and prevent him from saying what he wanted to say. I believe he is a decent man. I am not lessening the plight of these women when I say that all of them had families, some of which were not poor. They too had responsibilities. We all know of cases in our communities when this was allowed to happen with the complicity of State authorities. We cannot blame the State for everything, however. We all have to take responsibility. I knew of people and cases which were hushed up when I was a young fellow. The State put more than one quarter of them in directly but families and people must also look into their hearts. We are still doing that with immigration and what we voted for in the middle of the night last week.
17864	SeanSherlock	Labour	14678.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	 I thank former Senator McAleese and his team for producing this report. I completely accept its findings and believe the women and their stories. This is a sad chapter in our history. I thank Deputy Calleary for tabling the motion but we would not be discussing the matter tonight if the Taoiseach had acted properly last week when he had the opportunity to apologise unreservedly to all the women concerned and their families. He could have apologised on behalf of every man, woman and child in this country. He has a mandate as Head of Government to issue such an apology. He failed to grasp that opportunity, however. When one compares the utterances of the Minister for Justice and Equality as Opposition spokesman with what he says now, one cannot but think he is playing politics. The report was delayed and took longer than expected to complete, even though only a small minority of the women were interviewed. As senior departmental officials were on the committee of investigation, they did not have to wait to read the report. The Government should have been man enough to apologise before the report came before us. I salute the undying dignity of the Magdalen survivors and welcome those who are in the Gallery tonight. It behoves us to introduce a proper redress scheme, pay pensions for the labour they carried out and look after their rights and housing. Our State does not have a good record in dealing with sensitive cases like these. We all proclaim to be horrified at the mistreatment of children but not long ago nearly every Deputy except me took part in a referendum and a charade in which the Supreme Court found that the Government stole €1.1 million of the money allocated for a proper referendum campaign. Nothing has changed. We might say we are in modern Ireland but slavery and ill-treatment of young women and boys are ongoing. We cannot be washing our hands as if we are all new people with new thinking. This is going on under our noses and the Government is complicit in it. It is not acceptable that mandarins in the Department of Justice and Equality could tie the Taoiseach up in knots and prevent him from saying what he wanted to say. I believe he is a decent man. I am not lessening the plight of these women when I say that all of them had families, some of which were not poor. They too had responsibilities.

17867	SeanSherlock	Labour	14686.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-02-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	121	 I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, particularly in light of the pressing and important issues facing the country at the present time. The importance of the economy and the impact that economic policy, be it good or bad, can have on the lives of ordinary people cannot be underestimated. While it would be naive to suggest that everything begins and ends with the economy, there is no doubt that the economy matters in ways that most people rarely, if ever, think about. For example, when we think about economic matters we often think about banks, financial institutions and so forth. Rarely, if ever, do we associate economics or the economy with the arts, sport, public libraries, our built heritage, forests, mountain walks, lakes and rivers, yet all of these areas have been significantly affected by the recent budget and more importantly, by the policies of slash and burn favoured by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government. Sinn Féin is deeply concerned, for example, by the proposal to merge the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland. We are also opposed to the proposed merger of the National Archives and the Irish Manuscript Commission, to any change in the arm's length principle or to any proposals that would interfere with the independence of key artistic and cultural institutions. The Government has not produced any information on cost-benefit analysis, headcount reductions and so forth that would justify the proposed changes, yet it is hell bent on a process of amalgamations, mergers, the dissolution of independent boards and the non-renewal of vital leadership roles. In a time of fiscal austerity, cutbacks, mass unemployment and national despondency, the arts offer a valuable and creative outlet to people. In a mature society that values expression and creativity, the arts have the potential to enrich lives. They help us to think about the world and our place in it in a more imaginative, innovative and abstract way.

17869	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	372	 Children with Down's syndrome whose level of intellectual disability places them in the mild general learning disability, GLD, range may receive individual resource teaching hours in the same manner as children with other low-incidence disabilities but they receive their support through the general allocation model, GAM. Schools have provision, under the GAM, to allocate and target resources to those children most in need of those resources and also to make the best use of those resources. Although not prescriptive, children with mild GLD will generally receive approximately 2.5 teaching hours per week under the GAM allocation. This provision is reflective of the resource teaching support which is provided for children with mild GLD prior to the introduction of the GAM. Schools also have a discretion to supplement teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils with greatest need and where a child with Down's syndrome also had a diagnosis of moderate general learning disability and thus received an additional low incidence resource teaching allocation of 3.5 hours, the difference between that provided under the GAM, if the child was receiving 2.5 hours, would be one hour. However, the difference could be less if the school was supplementing teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils. Can I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to complete the questions?
17870	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	 Historically, the Department allocates resources to support children with special needs on the basis of categories of disabilities but for many years children with special needs were primarily educated in special schools or special classes. These schools and classes were designated as catering for a specific category of disability, but the report of the Special Education Review Committee, SERC, of 1993 made a wide range of recommendations on the level of resources that should be allocated to cater for children in different categories of special needs. The SERC report still provides much of the basis which underpins the current policy and provision. The disability category set out in the SERC report formed the basis of resource allocations. That report did not identify Down's syndrome as a particular disability category for the allocation of resources and consideration of the categories of disability to be catered for under the GAM based on high incidence or less severe disability was centred mainly on the category of mild general learning disability detailed in the SERC report. I refer the Deputy then to my original reply.
17871	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	376	 I acknowledge the points made by Deputy Finian McGrath. They will be taken on board.
17872	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	399	" The Children's Rights Alliance report noted that the Department of Education and Skills received an overall ""B-minus"" grade for solid progress, particularly in literacy, patronage and school buildings. This is one of the highest grades given to any Department and reflects well on the overall performance of our education system. The report also notes that the level of investment in the area of special educational needs was maintained in the current school year but that implementation of the EPSEN Act has been delayed. I understand and acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed to date about the delay in implementing the EPSEN Act. In light of the very difficult economic situation, the previous Government deferred full implementation of it. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has advised that an additional investment of up to €235 million per annum across the education and health sectors would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. In the Department's view, the level of investment required could be greater. While the Minister has done his best to date to preserve overall funding for special education, it has not been possible to identify additional resources from within the education budget to cover this cost. The NCSE has been asked to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special needs. This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including prioritising access of children with special needs to an individual education plan."
17873	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	401	 I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. As I stated earlier, the NCSE has been tasked with the provision of policy advice on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports required to be allocated in order to achieve as much as possible of EPSEN within the confines of the parcel of funding available in that regard. The Government will endeavour to ensure as much as possible of it is implemented. The internal assessment is that the cost could be higher than the figure which I mentioned earlier. We will do our best to implement EPSEN within current constraints.
17874	SeanSherlock	Labour	14701.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-07 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	404	 Without being facetious, that is too optimistic. A number of sections have already been implemented. I can provide a list of all the sections that have been implemented thus far but for the sake of brevity, I will not do so now. I take the point made by Deputy O'Brien in regard to ensuring greater collaboration between the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and for people to think outside the traditional silos within which they exist in terms of delivery of policy outcomes. I note the point made in that regard.

17883	SeanSherlock	Labour	14707.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	359	 I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. I thank Deputy Charles Flanagan for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the issues raised. The Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013-14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected, with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities presents a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities, including minorities, in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. The value for money review of small primary school provision is at an advanced stage of preparation. The Department expects to publish the review, at which stage its findings can be debated. At post-primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are 55 schools, out of 723 post-primary schools, charging fees, ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils. The State pays the salary of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools, compared with the salary of one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher applies in DEIS schools. The pupil-teacher ratio will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools, carried out by the Department of Education and Skills and published on Tuesday, 5 March, shows that fee-charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding. There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community about the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. The Government recognises the importance of ensuring students from a Protestant or Reformed Church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos, while, at the same time, ensuring funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Minister has welcomed the recent announcement by Kilkenny College that it is entering the free secondary school scheme and will cease to charge fees from September next. It is a welcome development that the school considers that its future can best be secured through the free scheme and that it can continue to deliver a Church of Ireland school ethos for families in the south-east in this way. In regard to capitation, the Department provides capitation funding for all recognised primary schools and second level schools within the free education scheme. There has been some reduction in the level of capitation funding in recent years owing to the need to operate within our tight budgetary requirements. With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, there is an arrangement whereby funding is provided by my Department for the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty in meeting the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a Reformed Church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually and this fund ensures necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. Regarding school transport provision, a number of changes have been implemented in the primary and post-primary school transport scheme. These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis. I confirm that the Minister and his relevant departmental officials will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland and boards of education, on education provision for all areas.
17884	SeanSherlock	Labour	14707.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	361	 On the first question, I can facilitate the Deputy in ensuring he receives guidance on the guidelines on and processes involved in amalgamations. On the second question, the Constitution does not allow for either positive or negative discrimination in schools based on their religious ethos.
17885	SeanSherlock	Labour	14707.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	363	 I take the Deputy's point on the position in certain areas of the country where there is a one-teacher school and, owing to geographical or other considerations, pupils may not be able to avail of the nearest school with their ethos. This is an issue with which we have to grapple. I know from my experience in my constituency where the Department has had consultations with the local bishop that there are ongoing discussions on how we can sort out these issues. In that sense, there is an open door. On the point on one-teacher schools, I would be of the mindset that we need to take these examples and grapple with them example by example. I would certainly have an open mind in facilitating that process.
17886	SeanSherlock	Labour	14707.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	555	 There is nothing worse than being patronised.
17887	SeanSherlock	Labour	14707.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	557	 This is particularly so since I have served in this House since 2007, longer than the Deputy yonder. I know I have earned my place here. Over the past two nights, there is no doubt that we have had an interesting and passionate debate and valid points have been made by both sides. Sometimes it turns a little bit raucous and many interventions have been quite rhetorical. In response to some points made by parties across the benches, if we are talking about the restoration of this economy and society, one must take cognisance of the fact that for the past decade or so, investment was primarily in construction, which fuelled the economy across many sectors. When that sector collapsed spectacularly along with the creation of the credit crisis, this Government when it came into power had to set out a new foundation and start investing in new areas so that one can upskill and retrain the very workers who have lost their jobs and now have to emigrate and about whom Sinn Féin is talking. One must put in place a set of new ideas that will begin new investments in a myriad of new sectors across the economy. If we are to have a motion in this House about labour market activation, I would rather the parties opposite interrogated Springboard, Momentum, the ICT skills conversion courses, the redundant apprentice placement scheme and schemes of that nature. If there is a critique of those schemes, I would like to hear it. One either agrees that the schemes are necessary or one does not. If we do not have schemes of that nature, we will not provide opportunities for those people, mainly young men who relied on the construction sector, to get back into work. In the two years that this Government has been in existence, we have put a myriad of schemes in place of which there has been a large take up. They have been quite successful, particularly JobBridge where a number of people have secured full-time jobs. I agree with some of the points made by Members opposite in respect of certain areas of Ireland where we have not had the foreign direct investment that is so necessary to sustain those areas. It is a pity I have only one minute left because I am only getting started. I have offered Sinn Féin a chance to sit down with me and interrogate each of our policies, many of which I cannot articulate because of the limited time I have on this motion, and I think it will take me up on this offer. I have offered it a chance to go through and critique each one of those schemes as long as it is an objective critique and not rhetorical and empty so that we can work with parties opposite regardless of their hue to get us out of this crisis. Sinn Féin may score points but that is its prerogative as an Opposition party. This is the boxing ring and that is the job of Opposition but if it is going to interrogate the Government, it should not use empty rhetoric and at least come to us with something specific that critiques the policies we are putting forward. It must acknowledge that there has been real growth in the economy, that there has been an net increase in jobs, that we are continuing to win the type of investments that are necessary across a myriad of sectors and that we are investing in these sectors. I attended an InterTradeIreland event last week. It is a North-South body created as a result of North-South relations. I met with a representative from Sinn Féin at that conference. There is an acknowledgement that if this island is to flourish, it must be on the basis of building cross-Border and bilateral links with our neighbours. The more we can embed that within the system and the more opportunities we can create through agencies like InterTradeIreland, the more we will raise the economic ship of this island. I apologise for the fact that I do not have enough time to respond to all the points raised.

17901	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	191	 I am standing in for the Minister for Justice and Equality who is abroad on business. Both he and I have been greatly encouraged by the level of support expressed by Members for the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012. It is historic legislation that is at one with other initiatives aimed at making our criminal justice system work better for society. We want to reduce crime, see offenders caught and brought to justice. We want them to undergo whatever sanctions the courts impose, not from desire for revenge but to ensure those who offend against society pay their debt to society for doing so. Many issues were raised during Second Stage which I am confident will be dealt with by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on Committee Stage. Deputy McNamara raised the issue of the T case of which the Department of Justice and Equality is aware. However, it is our understanding that the UK Government will appeal it to the Supreme Court. The Department will consider the implications, if any, of the final determination of that case for our vetting arrangements and for this Bill. The UK system of vetting is very different to ours and direct comparisons are not necessarily correct. This can be revisited on Committee Stage. On the point raised by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Ryan, the Bill was amended in the Seanad to provide for the situation they outlined. Where a person is convicted for more than one offence regarding one incident, it is to be treated as one order of conviction under section 2(4). I thank Members for their contributions. The Minister and I appreciate the general welcome given to this Bill. All the suggestions as to how it could be improved will be considered on Committee Stage.
17902	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	 I move: That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to Standing Order 82A3(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.

With the permission of Deputy Ó Snodaigh and the Acting Chairman I would be obliged if I could buy some time and move on to the next issue.
17904	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	 Sorry about that.

I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. Tuam mental health service caters for the Tuam and Headford catchment areas, with a population of approximately 35,000 and a caseload in excess of 800 people. Traditionally, the service was provided at St. Brigid's Hospital in east Galway but gradually during the years community mental health services in Tuam and Headford have been developed. A report on fire safety in Toghermore House was delivered to the HSE in December 2012. It highlighted a number of shortfalls in fire safety which needed to be addressed as a priority. The assessment focused on relevant issues, including means of escape and associated signage and plans; structural fire precautions and fire equipment; coverage provided by fire alarm and emergency lighting systems; and facilities for the fire service. A local steering group consisting of a mental health clinical director, a consultant psychiatrist, a director of nursing, an occupational therapy manager, a business manager, a team leader social worker and a patient representative was formed by the HSE and met to address the challenges outlined in the report. The steering group is liaising with residents and their families as part of the process. HSE West has implemented improved fire risk assessment and hazard identification measures. All staff and patients have been informed that appropriate actions have been taken such as a complete ban on smoking in and around the residence structure and improved observations in all areas. To mitigate immediate risks, the HSE is installing a fire alarm system and continues to have hourly fire checks. Preparatory work for the fire alarm system has now been completed and the work is being carried out with minimum disruption to the daily routine of residents. The executive is commissioning a full review of all 24 hour residential facilities in counties Galway and Roscommon. The outcome of this review will assist in its determination of future requirements for mental health services in these geographic areas. The membership of an expert group to oversee this review is being finalised by the area manager and the executive clinical director. It is expected that the review will be completed within a 12 week period from the date of commission. It should be noted that no other mental health services in the Tuam complex or surrounding areas are affected by the fire safety issue. These facilities include the day hospital, day centre, training centre and workshop, primary care, CAMHS and out-patient and psychiatry of later life services, which continue to operate as normal. The Deputy can rest assured that the responsible Ministers will continue to closely monitor developments on this issue.
17906	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	264	 I agree with the Deputy that it is farcical for one Minister of State to respond to four issues. However, I know the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Reilly, would engage directly with him on his questions about who is on the steering group and the details of costs and timelines. I note, however, that the patients are represented on the group and, if the process is working properly, it should address the needs of patients and their families. I tend to agree with the Deputy on the issue. I have had similar experiences in my own area and ensured the regional director of operations was answerable to me on any issue arising. I recognise that it is important to raise these issues in the House and apologise to the Deputy for my lack of intimate knowledge of them.
17907	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	 I thank the Deputy for his earlier forbearance. I have now been provided with a reply from the Minister of Social Protection, who is out of the country at this time. Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to a jobseeker's payment. Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to such payment. Obviously, to be fair to the gentleman mentioned by the Deputy, that does not apply in his case. Unlike other jobseekers, who must sign off the live register on any day on which they find work, part-time firefighters are paid a jobseeker's payment in respect of days on which they are engaged in firefighting or training. They are, however, required to satisfy other statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment - that is, they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work. In this respect, deciding officers do not treat them differently from any other jobseeker. I accept the point the Deputy has made in this regard, but I do not have the full details of the case to hand. With regard to dealing with the systemic issue, I am familiar with the problems. In my area of Cork we have part-time firefighters and similar circumstances apply. Given the vagaries of this type of employment, issues relating to the eligibility of firefighters for jobseeker's payments have been raised with the Department of Social Protection on numerous occasions over the years. Taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise the jobseeker schemes, a group was established in the Department to examine the position of firefighters. While the work of this group is largely completed, issues relating to firefighters remain under consideration in the Department. Key to these considerations will be recognition of the very valuable service this group of workers provide to their local communities. However, it is also important that the integrity of the jobseeker scheme is maintained. Achieving a balance in this regard will include recognising the important service these workers provide and the contribution they make to the safety of communities across the country.
17908	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	268	 Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It would do no harm were the Deputy to refer the case of Gavin Burns to the Minister for reference as part of the ongoing review process.
17909	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	 I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the typing and issuing of transcripts of X-ray reports. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health. It is important to assure people attending the radiology unit at Tallaght hospital that there is no risk to patient safety. Urgent and prioritised reports in the emergency department and the paediatric radiology unit are produced within 24 hours. Tallaght hospital has in place a documented clinical governance process for radiologists, the doctors who examine x-rays. Urgent cases and cases in need of time-sensitive clinical decisions are flagged in advance by clinicians for immediate reporting. Critical or urgent findings are immediately brought to the attention of the referring doctors and the clerical staff who transcribe and send the report immediately. An average of 15,000 reports are typed at Tallaght hospital each month. Standard non-urgent reports are usually produced within two or three weeks. The number of reports that need to be typed has increased due to initiatives to improve access to imaging. More patients are receiving radiography examinations in Tallaght because of higher productivity and better facilities. For example, a second CT scanner was opened in December 2012. An initiative with Naas General Hospital reduced the MRI waiting list by 16% in 16 weeks. Some 6,000 examinations, or 3.5% of the annual total of 172,000, are currently untyped. Some 3,000 of these untyped reports relate to patients who attended routine outpatient imaging. They have been reported through an initiative with additional consultant resources. The remaining untyped examinations date from 12 February last to the current day. As the standard turnaround time for routine reports is two to three weeks, these tapes are currently delayed by a further two or three weeks. The radiology department, the diagnostic directorate and the executive team are taking a number of steps to address this issue. Additional clerical support is being provided in the radiology unit to assist with the typing of tapes. It is intended that the backlog will be cleared in approximately five weeks. The hospital has initiated demand management protocols within national guidelines to avoid the need for reports on specific images such as orthopaedics. An integrated voice recognition system that was piloted last year will be introduced from early April. This will eliminate the need to type transcripts for approximately 65% of the radiology workload. It is expected that voice recognition for all reporting in Tallaght will be fully implemented by the first quarter of 2014 as part of the roll-out of the national integrated medical imaging system. This will eliminate the need to transcribe radiology reports.
17910	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	272	 I will do so. I acknowledge everything that has been said.
17911	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	274	 I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. Any of us who have served on local authorities would acknowledge the point Deputy Lyons has made in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation, ARV, which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The Government has no plans at this juncture to introduce a temporary levy on large out-of-town retail operations. In terms of planning policy, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, published new development contribution guidelines in January 2012. The new guidelines build on the experience gained in recent years and also align development contribution policy with the Government's prioritisation of employment creation, investment and sustainable development, a point the Deputy addressed in his contribution. Above all, the guidelines are intended to support proper planning and sustainable development while also prioritising job creation and economic investment. All in this House, across the political spectrum, are aware of the pressures on small and medium enterprises and intergenerational businesses in places like Naas and Finglas, to which the Deputy referred. In that context, local authorities have been asked by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, by way of a circular letter, to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and, in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012. The Deputy referred to the Government's action programme for effective local government, Putting People First. This indicated that, in the context of reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts will provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness. To be honest, I do not know how that dynamic will work in Finglas and it is probably easier to map that potential in terms of counties such as Cork, where there are distinct municipal areas that do not border on a large metropolitan area. It will be a challenge, and I acknowledge the Deputy's point in this regard. The action programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of towns and counties. The Minister's approach to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties, with consequential implications for services, and, on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment. The Minister has informed me that he will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review and that he is determined every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.
17912	SeanSherlock	Labour	14708.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-03-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	 I am getting a bit peckish thinking of Four Star Pizza. It is a long way to Cork. I might pop in. On a serious note, I concur with what the Deputy is saying. We are seeing that effect throughout the landscape. There are factors other than rates influencing that dynamic. The Deputy is right about out-of-town multiples being able to house all products across a broad spectrum, which is certainly having an effect on smaller towns and villages. Smaller towns and villages must be creative because consumption has modified considerably. Conspicuous consumption has virtually flat-lined and we might have to be more creative about how we re-imagine town centres and villages. I take the point the Deputy is making.

17925	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	 I am taking this important matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who wishes me to convey his apologies to the House regarding the fact that he is not able to be present to discuss it. I fully acknowledge the concerns that have been raised. We have all received visits to our constituency offices from farmers in recent weeks. I am aware that the Dairygold Co-op in my area is planning to import hay from the UK in order to try to alleviate the shortage. We are very conscious of the situation in which farmers, particularly those who live in more disadvantaged areas, find themselves at present. The Minister has asked me to convey his acute awareness of the difficulties being experienced by some farmers as a result of recent unseasonable weather. The difficult conditions which obtained on farms last summer have been compounded by the extended winter. We acknowledge that the harsh weather of recent weeks has led to delayed grass growth and to increased demand for fodder and feed. Animals which, in normal conditions, would be on grass at this time of year have had to be kept indoors. While it is important to record that the outlook for our livestock sectors remains positive and that prices are relatively strong, it is clear that the conditions prevailing at present have resulted in short—term but significant management challenges. These include cashflow and credit issues - to which the Members opposite referred - for affected farmers who are faced with the burden of fodder shortages and additional feed costs. In the context of the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, the Minister urges farmers to contact their local Teagasc advisers. Where winter fodder is limited, Teagasc is providing specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this spring. Staff at all Teagasc offices are available to provide advice to farmers over the phone. Agricultural advisers are equipped and ready to outline the options open to farmers facing difficulties and to make plans which best suit their situations. Teagasc has also made extensive use of national and local media to provide farmers with advice and has co-ordinated with farm organisations, marts, local authorities, co-ops and other suppliers to provide targeted advice to all who need it. Advice for farmers on coping with fodder shortages has also been published, including guidelines to dairy and drystock farmers with little or no grass on feeding this spring. The Minister takes this opportunity to thank Teagasc for its efforts to date and asks that these be intensified in the coming days until the problems being experienced are alleviated by grass growth. The Minister also notes that farm bodies have urged farmers to assess whether they have surplus fodder in stock and whether they are in a position to make some available to others in difficulty. These efforts are to be commended and the Minister echoes the call for those in need of assistance to be supported and urges people who have fodder to spare to be proactive in making it available to neighbouring farmers who are encountering severe problems. This is an occasion when solidarity is needed among the farming community. It is also the case that farmers have increased the usage of concentrates to fill the fodder gap. While addressing the fodder issue, in some cases this has resulted in problems with cashflow and access to working capital on farms. In response to farmers' concerns in this regard, the Minister has already written to the banks and will meet them shortly to highlight the extreme challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather. At that point, he will urge them to take a flexible approach to dealing with short-term credit issues. He will also write to the grain and feed merchants to urge them to be flexible during this difficult period. It is important that financial institutions take into consideration the fact that while the current difficulties may cause cashflow pressures for farmers, the overall outlook for the sector is favourable. Commodity prices are very strong and the positive expectations for dairy, beef and lamb prices mean that farmers should see improved market return for their produce this year. The Minister would also ask that co-ops and others operating in the agrifood sector be sensitive to the particular difficulties being experienced by farmer suppliers this spring. The Minister recently announced an extension, to 15 May 2013, for the closing off of the traditional hay meadow measure in the agri-environment options scheme. He has allowed a deferral of one month to the closing-off date and this will help to maximise grass utilisation in the critical recovery period as the weather improves and grass growth resumes. There is no doubt that the availability of forage on farms presents an ongoing challenge. The Minister has great confidence, however, in the resilience and ingenuity of the Irish farming community. The improvement in soil temperatures during the past week is very welcome and should see a return to more normal growth rates for grass and crops alike. This, together with relatively positive market conditions, should see a significant improvement in the situation in the coming weeks.
17926	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	 I take the Acting Chairman's point, but my understanding is that, with due respect to the Chair, three speakers indicated under the rules of the House and four speakers were granted time.

17927	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	 No Deputy does not acknowledge the problems facing farmers, particularly those in rural and disadvantaged areas. Some of the prescribed solutions border on blind rhetoric. Fair enough, as that is part and parcel of what we are about in the House. However, that a former Cabinet Minister claims that €10 million should be made available from administration and other sources within the Department leads me to the conclusion that-----
17928	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	 -----it should be taken from other schemes.

17930	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	 This is a difficult situation. Some reasonable interventions were made about the potential development of a hardship fund. In that sense, I will convey the Deputies' concerns to the Minister.
17931	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	" I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I have a technical response on children ingesting detergent ""liquitabs"" and I will outline it with your indulgence, Acting Chairman."
17932	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	" Okay. I take the point. I understand that the National Poisons Information Centre was in contact with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, as the competent authority for detergent regulations last August to September, as it was concerned about the number of incidents reported - as highlighted by the Deputy - involving children and liquid detergent tablets. More than 50% of the inquiries to the poison centre's helpline related to incidents with ""liquitabs"" involving children, with the majority being between one to three years old. These products are small, with a soft texture which means they are easy for children to pick up and squeeze or put into their mouths. I am stating the obvious. The National Poisons Information Centre was also aware of a report in the media in 2012 from Scotland, reporting five children, all under the age of two, who were admitted to hospital over an 18 month period as emergencies with stridor - or an abnormal breathing sound indicative of a blockage in the throat - and drooling after biting into a liquid detergent capsule. As a result of that and information from the UK, treatment guidelines now advise that ""children aged under five years who are asymptomatic but have been exposed to this product within the last two hours should be referred for medical assessment"". Therefore, it is essential that parents and guardians contact the National Poisons Information Centre for advice if their child ingests a ""liquitab"". In response, the HSA met with the National Poisons Information Centre and with the manufacturing companies who are placing these products on the Irish market to discuss the issues arising. The HSA also brought the matter to the attention of the EU Commission and colleague EU member states. In response to its engagement with industry on the issue, all of those companies that place the products on the market in Ireland signed up to the voluntary product stewardship programme in December 2012, which involves commitments to change the packaging to reduce the visibility of the capsules and to restrict access to the capsules by small children. The programme also covers product information and communications about keeping these products out of the reach of children, as well as an awareness campaign designed to keep such products - along with household chemicals - out of the reach of children. The campaign is being prepared by the National Poisons Information Centre with the engagement of industry. All product packaging changes should be in place by June 2013. The HSA and the National Poisons Information Centre continue to monitor and review the progress of the product stewardship plan on an ongoing basis. As recently as last month, the HSA met with the IBEC industry representatives and was updated on proposals in hand with the National Poisons Information Centre concerning awareness plans for the products, along with progress on changes to product packaging. Last November, the HSA formally raised the matter at EU level. In particular, the HSA sought to explore the possibility of taking action under the EU detergents regulation or the EU dangerous preparations directive as a means of addressing the current issue. The EU Commission's considered view was that if EU measures were considered necessary, the provisions of the general product safety directive could be used for immediate action and for long-term measures and what is known as a ""restriction"" proposal under the EU REACH regulation could be examined. The Commission has indicated, however, that while further discussion would be required with member states to determine the most appropriate measure, it would prefer to await the outcome of the voluntary action being undertaken by industry. I am close to the end of the response. AISE - the EU industry representative organisation for the sector - explained that the capsules have been developed to meet ""sustainability"" challenges and consumer requests for ""easy to use"" detergents. One might say that could be deemed as a typical industry response. It also outlined the actions already put in place or ongoing by practically all individual companies concerned and presented proposals for further future actions, including specific labelling and warning icons on the packaging and awareness raising campaigns. I have a few more points to make but in recognition of the amount of time available I will conclude now and respond following Deputy Conway's supplementary questions."
17933	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	 Again, I fully acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. It is fair to say – I speak objectively – that the HSA is quite fastidious in terms of how it approaches matters such as this one. The Government is happy to allow the HSA to continue to work with the National Poisons Information Centre to monitor and review progress on the voluntary product stewardship programme. If further measures are necessary there is potential for the backup of potential REACH-type legislation at EU level on the matter. I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
17934	SeanSherlock	Labour	14741.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	" I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I will briefly outline the principal objectives of the Bill. The primary changes extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI. Through funding supports via our higher education institutions, SFI will be able to fund applied research as well as continuing to support oriented basic research. This will allow SFI to take the outcome of the research closer to market through increased commercialisation, the development of new products, the generation of new services and technologies and lead to the creation of new sustainable quality jobs for Ireland. I stress that the foundation will continue to support basic research. The legislation will also allow SFI to broaden its programme offerings to cover the 14 priority and six underpinning areas identified by the research prioritisation steering group and approved by Government in March 2012. Importantly, the legislation will also enable the foundation to provide funding on an all-island basis for the first time. Subject to the excellence and strategic criteria being met, SFI will therefore be able to fund researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland. It will also allow the foundation to enter, subject to the consent of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, collaborative arrangements with international partners and help Ireland leverage significant non-Exchequer research funding into the country. In doing so, it will also enable Ireland to support the wider EU research agenda through programmes being supported under the EU's Horizon 2020 strategy, which will have approximately €70 billion available in research funding from 2014 onwards. As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I am eager that Ireland should aggressively target Horizon 2020 funding and the extended SFI legislation should enhance our success rate. The Bill also provides a legislative basis for SFI to stimulate the study and awareness of the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In addition, it includes a number of ancillary provisions that are not specific to SFI, but which relate to Enterprise Ireland, El, IDA Ireland and enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone; amendment of the Freedom of Information Acts specific to our enterprise agencies; and strengthening Forfás's function to provide research data so as to fall in line with international best practice. I shall comment further on these later but I will first give a brief overview of the recent progression of our research and innovation system, of SFI and its role and of the rationale for the changes proposed in the Bill. This legislation affords us an ideal opportunity to remind ourselves of the reasons governments around the world fund research and development. It is universally accepted that the private sector does not fund research and development at the optimum level for economic and societal benefit. There are many reasons for this but primary among them is the inherent risk and uncertainty of such investment. The commercial return from research and development investment, particularly in basic research, is often insufficiently clear-cut for the private investor. Another likely factor is that the direct returns to the private research and development investor are often eclipsed by the societal returns. Considering research in an Irish context, I do not subscribe to the argument that Ireland, as a small open economy, can simply avoid significant investment in research and development, particularly basic research, and simultaneously take advantage of and benefit from discoveries made elsewhere. Discovery, and the benefits it brings, do not exist in a vacuum. If Ireland is to absorb externally generated new knowledge and take advantage of it, we must have the capability to understand and use this new knowledge. The best way of ensuring we can create new knowledge is to conduct excellent and relevant research and development ourselves. Ireland needs to be a ""knowledge generator"" if further creators of knowledge are to be enticed to the country. A constantly developing and changing global economy and society require Ireland to keep pace if our position in the international marketplace is to be maintained and enhanced. We must continue to invest appropriately in creating and innovating to ensure we can successfully compete in global terms. These are just some of the reasons the Government needs to encourage and supplement private investment in research and development. In Ireland, there has been significant public investment in science, technology and innovation since the late 1990s - primarily to address a number of critical deficits. Following decades of under investment in research and development we lagged well behind our competitors. Our research capabilities then were well below the OECD norm. We lacked a core of talented, high quality research personnel, performing industrially relevant research. This combination of factors impeded our ability to attract and maintain large scale, knowledge intensive industrial projects to Ireland while we were simultaneously failing to develop indigenous, internationally competitive, high growth firms. Our industrial policy in the latter part of the 1990s, therefore, came to be based on the conclusion that we needed to move up the employment value chain by generating our own research talent pool to create the jobs of the future and diversify from low cost, low end manufacturing. In this context, in 1998, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation undertook a technology foresight exercise, which sought to identify emerging areas that would be the key to our economic development and enhanced competitiveness. The resulting foresight report recommended that Government should establish a fund to enable Ireland to become a centre for world-class research excellence in a small number of niche areas. Subsequently, SFI commenced operations in 2000, and was formally established through legislation in 2003. SFI's mission was to support research excellence in the strategically important areas of information communications technology and biotechnology. In 2008, a third research pillar - sustainable energy-energy efficient technologies - was added. A core aspect of what SFI does is the development of a talent pool of Irish-based scientists who, through honing their significant scientific skills here, help to develop the good jobs of the future for Ireland. Significantly, SFI does not provide research grants to industry. That is done through other State research and development supporting agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and so on. The foundation provides grants to researchers and research groups based in our higher education institutions, on the basis of competitive calls for research proposals. It uses a rigorous international peer review process to ensure that only the best proposals receive support - typically 15%-20% of all applications, which is in line with international norms. The foundation's annual grants budget, which is in the region of €150 million, directly supports a cohort of 3,000 researchers in our universities and institutes of technology. These SFI funded researchers are connected to close to 650 distinct companies that employ more than 90,000 people in Ireland. The researchers also leverage significant research funding from non-Exchequer sources, such as the EU and industry - usually between €80 million and €90 million per annum."

Deputy Ó Caoláin has been relentless in pursuing justice for the women. In spite of the many difficulties and frustrations he has experienced over the years, he never gave up. Having read the women's stories, I find it horrifying to imagine the procedure. I cannot imagine what it must have been like to have gone through it. The one word to describe the procedure is barbaric. It is very difficult to reconcile that barbarism with what we associate with the medical profession. Doctors swear the hippocratic oath, which is basically about practising medicine ethically and honestly. While there are variations of the oath, I read today a comment that warmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. Warmth, sympathy and understanding were very sadly lacking for the women involved. I join others in acknowledging the women present in the Visitors Gallery who suffered that cruelty. I acknowledge their pain - for many of them their acute continuing pain. They have got on with their lives throughout all that pain through perseverance and the great support they give each other. Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned mutilation, which is also an apt word for a procedure that unhinged the pelvis, severed joints and sundered pubic bones. Some women ended up permanently disabled, incontinent and in pain. Very sadly, some women lost their babies following the procedure. It was an operation that was undertaken with no explanation given to the women as to what was happening - never mind why it was happening. The last time we discussed the matter the Minister made certain statements about this being a standard operation, mostly used as emergency surgery and safer than a caesarean section. He did not accept then that this was a barbaric act. However, all of that was refuted by Ms Marie O'Connor, who made very detailed comments about each of those points. I listened to the Minister's speech from my office after I had to leave the Chamber. I acknowledge that he made a commitment to deal with the issue sensitively and fairly, which is why he is accepting the Bill. It is a major achievement to have this agreement. It is a tribute to the women that this support has been agreed. The Minister said Deputy Ó Caoláin's Bill contains some flaws. Regardless of the flaws, the Bill must achieve its objectives, which starts with lifting the current Statute of Limitations. However, there is an urgency about this - I say this with no disrespect to the women - given that the women are of advancing ages and cannot continue in the limbo they have been in for so long. Health services must be provided to meet their health needs. I read a comment from a medical person who stated he felt this was a stain on Irish medicine. This is an opportunity to get rid of that stain from Irish medicine. Overall, Irish medicine does not deserve that stain. It beggars belief that it ever went down the road of symphysiotomy.

This is an opportunity to get rid of that stain from Irish medicine. Overall, Irish medicine does not deserve that stain. It beggars belief that it ever went down the road of symphysiotomy.
17945	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	291	 I note the issues raised by the Deputy. The review commenced in October 2010 under the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and such value for money reviews are part and parcel of governance within the State. It is important that we try to ensure as we best we can that the ethos of rural schools is maintained in the context of the positive impact they have on their communities.
17946	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	 I again acknowledge the Deputy's concerns in this regard and I reiterate that the report is being finalised. It has, therefore, not been completed and the concerns raised by both Deputies should form part of the policy outcome. However, no final policy decision has been made.
17947	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	296	 It is not right for Deputies to up the rhetoric on this issue when a final decision has not yet been made. In the case of rural schools with only a small number of pupils, it is eminently reasonable and sensible to proceed with amalgamations when they can be achieved through a process of consensus. The annual savings to be achieved are available for everyone to see. The budget measures set out a target of saving 250 posts over a three year period. Deputy McConalogue is a member of the party which instigated the review in question. Let us be honest about how we approach this issue. It is appropriate to have a value for money report on small schools. It is not proposed to compromise the ethos that exists in rural communities. I do not propose to mouth platitudes about representing either a rural or urban community because most Deputies are familiar with the importance of rural schools and their positive impact on local communities. From a policy point of view, the decision must have regard to this fact.
17948	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	297	 The State Examinations Commission, SEC, has statutory responsibility for the certificate examinations. A waiver from spelling and grammar can be provided to candidates with special educational needs under the scheme of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations, RACE. A devolved system is in place for the junior certificate examinations. Schools can recommend the granting of accommodations which are then granted by the State Examinations Commission. However, accommodations which are granted for the junior certificate will not automatically be carried on to the leaving certificate. Instead, all applications for accommodations in the leaving certificate are referred by schools to the National Educational Psychological Service for a decision. Applications for the year 2012-13 are not yet complete. In the 2012 leaving certificate examinations, a total of 3,940 candidates applied for a waiver from the spelling and grammar element of language subjects. Of these, 2,587 or 66% were granted and 1,353 or 34% were refused. The State Examinations Commission cannot provide statistics on candidates refused such a waiver at leaving certificate who had a waiver at junior certificate. This information would require a manual examination of each file. Appeals against any State Examinations Commission decisions on RACE can be made to an independent appeals committee. Statistics for the leaving certificate 2012 on the spelling and grammar waiver Year No. of applications for spelling and grammar waiver Number granted Number refused 2012 3,940 2,587 1,353
17949	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	 Perhaps the Deputy will submit a parliamentary question on the case to which he referred or raise it directly with the Minister to have it examined. In cases where a parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of a decision by the State Examinations Commission, he or she may appeal to an independent appeals committee whose members are drawn from outside the commission. The remit of the appeals committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the State Examinations Commission. Appeals must be lodged in writing and all appeals are considered in light of the framework of principles established by an expert advisory group. The Department and Minister do not have a role in reviewing decisions made by the State Examinations Commission or independent appeals committee in respect of the scheme of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations. Of the unsuccessful applicants for reasonable accommodations in 2012, 513 made an appeal to the independent appeals committee. Of these appeals, 32 were successful while the original decision made by the commission was upheld in the remaining cases. The Minister is satisfied that the scheme's application and appeal processes operate in an open and transparent manner. Notwithstanding this, I am willing to examine the specific critique of the system made by an eminent and qualified person who has done an assessment of a student. I ask the Deputy to provide me with the details of the case.
17950	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	301	 The Deputy raises an issue in the context of the transition from junior to leaving certificate in terms of one being a devolved system while the other is independent. There seems to be a question regarding the need for further clarification on that transition in the context of how the two-----

17952	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	305	 -----I will revert to him on the matter.
17953	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	306	 The national strategy for higher education outlines a range of actions aimed at enhancing teaching and the learning experience of all students. Last November the Minister announced the establishment of the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning, which will provide a platform for progressing key actions such as the development of innovative pedagogies, better supports for first year students and promoting academic professional development. Listening and responding to feedback from students and other stakeholders is also crucial in ensuring high quality provision. The first national survey of employers was completed in December 2012 and a national student survey is currently being established, a pilot of which is now under way. Measures are also being taken to ensure a robust and effective quality assurance system. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 established Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which has taken on responsibility for externally reviewing the quality assurance arrangements of universities. Learner involvement will be an important feature of future quality assurance processes.
17954	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	308	 With respect, I hope I understand the Deputy's question. If he is expressing concerns in respect of the focus on teaching, I am not quite clear from where his underlying assumption that there are issues around teaching within the third level sector comes. Perhaps I missed something in that regard. There is a national strategy in respect of teaching in the higher education sector. The national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning was launched in November 2012 and is chaired by Professor Sarah Moore of the University of Limerick. The national forum will consolidate and build upon the strengths of existing individual institutions and their teaching and learning frameworks. The work of the national forum is under way and I hope this provides an answer to one part of the Deputy's question. The national forum will provide a key system-level infrastructure for the support of the national strategy and serve as a platform for academic-led enhancement of teaching. Its focus will be on adding value by providing a structure through which these institutional and network initiatives can be synergised and leveraged. The nascent forum held its first meeting in March. It is important to state that each academic institution has its own degree of autonomy. The Deputy will appreciate the higher education block grant of over €1 billion. I am of the view that the aims behind the national strategy will complement the goal of our making a greater economic impact through the creation of further jobs and enhance people's learning experience. As already stated, in the context of the teaching experience the national forum is examining the development of innovative pedagogies and the technologies which support these. In itself, this is quite innovative. It is also considering whether it might be necessary to broaden students' first year experience or whether prescribed courses should be retained.
17955	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	310	 The straight answer to the Deputy's question on mining data is that such data is already available.
17956	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	 I was just about to say that measuring teaching outcomes from either a quantitative or qualitative point of view is quite challenging, particularly in view of the different academic ethos which obtains within the various higher education institutions. One way to try to ensure more efficient outcomes from a teaching point of view is to consider professional academic development and the research which underpins it. The system at post-primary level is highly evolved. There should also be a system that is promoted at tertiary level. If there is greater academic professional development, there are better teachers, more specialties are created and better outcomes are driven. This issue is being considered as part of the national forum. The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I am unsure as to whether we have those data. We can check for him. However, there is a focus on his points regarding the need for metrics and indices.
17957	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	313	" The ""Teachers' Voice"" is a report based on the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland, ASTI's consultation with teachers on the new framework for junior cycle. It is valuable to have access to these findings, which are being considered within the Department. At the ASTI conference, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made a point of commending the ASTI for the content of the report and the process that led to its publication. He has read the report and is listening carefully to the concerns of teachers. The Department has established an education partners consultation group to provide the partners, including the ASTI, with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased implementation of the junior cycle. The group meets every four to six weeks, providing an opportunity to highlight opportunities and challenges. In addition, the ASTI is represented on the key National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, structures responsible for the development of the curriculum, including the council and its substructures. Teachers will be provided with a comprehensive continuing professional development, CPD, programme from autumn 2013 that will address many of the concerns highlighted in the ASTI report."
17958	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	 The teachers' representative organisations are part of the educational partners consultation group and provide partners, including the ASTI, with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased introduction of the junior cycle. This is proof of their involvement in a consultative process. Meetings are held approximately every month. At these, the partners have an opportunity to highlight their key concerns. In addition, the ASTI is represented on the NCCA's council and subject development groups. At these meetings, the future shape of the curriculum is considered and findings are presented to the Minister. I take the point made by the president of the ASTI. It conducted a survey of teachers, the response of whom was clear and has been acknowledged by the Minister, but Mr. Breslin stated that, while it was clear from teachers' responses that some aspects of the Minister's framework had the potential to improve the educational experience of young people in junior cycle, teachers were resoundingly stating that this potential was contingent upon assessment and certification procedures that were fair, transparent and, critically, did not undermine educational standards. There is cross-party agreement on this point, given the fact that the House has passed a motion supporting the junior cycle reforms. The Member opposite voted in favour of those reforms. There is a process of consultation.
17959	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	317	 There is pageantry and choreography to these setpiece events in the Chamber. As an Opposition spokesperson, there is a little jousting and political point scoring. That is fair enough, but every Deputy acknowledges the need for junior cycle reform and wants it to go the right way and to be based on consensus and consultation. There should be proper continuing professional development for teachers if they are to embrace a new way of teaching. The assessment aspect will be concerned with improving learning outcomes and not just proving them, if the Deputy knows what I mean. The role of the ASTI and teachers in this will be paramount. It is the most important role. We want to ensure that there is ongoing consultation with teachers and their representative organisations. There is a mechanism to this end as the junior cycle is rolled out. I do not know whether I can elaborate further.
17960	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	318	 As the Deputy will be aware, there are two schools on this site, a junior school and a senior school, both of which have temporary accommodation in addition to their permanent structures and have applied to the Department for replacement permanent buildings. The next step to progressing a building project for the schools involves the appointment of a design team and the commencement of the architectural planning process. School building projects such as this one that are not included in the five-year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of further funds being available to the Department in the future. My Department has decided to build a new primary school close to the schools in question in order to meet an identified demographic need in the area. Lucan has been identified as an area in which there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at post-primary and primary levels during the coming years. It is within this context that, in 2011, the Minister announced the future establishment of a new 1,000-pupil second level school and a new 16-classroom primary school. The primary school will open in temporary accommodation in September 2013 under the patronage of County Dublin VEC. It will be a multidenominational, English medium, co-educational primary school. Both primary and post-primary schools will cater for increasing demographic demand in the general Lucan area.
17961	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	324	 The Deputy should make the request.
17962	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	 The Deputy should make the request in writing. It is on the record. The Deputy will appreciate that the demographic issue is clear. His situation in Lucan is not untypical of other parts of the country, including my area where there are serious demographic demands. There is a feeling among existing schools that they have been bypassed in favour of the creation of new schools. However, the demographic projection figures do not lie and therefore we face a cliff in certain parts of the country in terms of educational provision and it is necessary to build new schools. Without plámásing, I sympathise with the views expressed by Deputy Keating. If he makes a request to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister will take it from there.
17963	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	328	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 34, 48 and 59 together. The promotion of student well-being and positive mental health strategies in schools is a key aim of my Department. Accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has directed my Department's support services to review and prioritise support for schools on the guidelines for mental health promotion which he launched recently with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The guidelines bring together existing guidance and programmes to ensure a more integrated and holistic policy approach is taken towards student well-being. The guidelines, which are evidence-based, are an essential reference point for teachers and school management in terms of their planning for the implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan and for accessing the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support framework. Relevant supports for schools are outlined in the document.
17964	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	330	 I accept the point the Deputy is making. Perhaps it is a commentary on life in this country at present for people who are unemployed, employed or in specific professions that the level of stress has increased dramatically. We have had a recession for more than five years at this stage and that takes its toll. Decisions have been made on budgetary issues pertaining to education involving a reduction in services as a result of the macroeconomic situation in which we find ourselves. In my experience, teachers as a cohort are very supportive of each other in terms of developing mechanisms for dealing with stress. I have an open mind on the issue. I honestly do not know how the Department can put in place mechanisms that are funded to assist teachers specifically to alleviate stress. I do not know how one would achieve that without achieving it in other areas of the public sector also. There are definite guidelines on students. It is an apolitical space. Through providing guidelines for the promotion of mental health and suicide prevention, the State is doing a lot to ensure the health and well-being of pupils. The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not know how one would develop a mechanism that is funded specifically for teachers but I have an open mind on the matter.
17965	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	333	 There is common ground here. What has amazed me since becoming Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills two years ago is the well-spring of initiatives in schools and the level of cohesion between teachers and pupils in their collaboration on such projects. We all acknowledge that and I accept the point that we should examine some of these projects to determine whether we can pilot them across the educational landscape. We are often accused in this House of being out of touch but very often we have our fingers on the pulse in terms of what is happening in our own communities. I have noticed an enormous amount of enthusiasm from pupils about trying to ensure the emotional and mental well being of their fellow pupils. I have not seen anything like the level of positivity that I have seen in the last two years, in terms of the willingness of pupils to engage with and try to help their fellow students. That is having a knock-on effect on overall well being within schools. The evidence for that may be anecdotal but we are seeing an improvement in this regard. I take the point made about the stresses and strains that teachers are under. I also understand their in loco parentis role in schools but schools are communities made up of students, teachers and parents, all working together. The question was asked as to whether we can specifically fund services for teachers who are in distress or under stress without also doing so for the wider populace but I do not know the answer to that. As to whether we can get specific schemes or pilot projects under way, I do not see why not. Wearing my research hat, I can say that it can be very easy to do so. Good ideas, like the CoderDojo initiative, for example, are very easily replicated across the landscape. If specific initiatives are being carried out in schools in certain areas at present, I do not see why they cannot be replicated across the country. There would be no additional cost because it is simply about learning from other schools and replicating that across the system. I am always happy to engage on this agenda.
17966	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	334	 The Department currently spends some €1.3 billion or 15% of its budget in support of children with special educational needs, including those with autism. Many children with autism are supported in mainstream schools where they are integrated with other children, including those with other special educational needs. These children have access to additional resource teaching hours and may have access to special needs assistants, SNAs, as required. Complete details on funding and staffing specifically to support children with autism is, therefore, not available. There are 540 classes specifically for children with autism. These classes are staffed with a ratio of one teacher and a minimum of two SNAs for every six children. Other supports include home tuition, special school transport arrangements, special equipment and training for teachers and parents. The National Council for Special Education is available to support parents who may be considering the most appropriate placement for their child or who are transitioning their child from primary to post-primary level.
17967	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	336	 I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, which is specific to his area. Department officials and I would be very interested to hear how the process with the VEC could take shape, with a view to engaging further in the process. If we are talking about a very specific geographical location, my own view - without being in full possession of the facts of the case made by the Deputy - is that the issue should be considered seriously. I hope that is an acceptable response, although it may not fully answer the question with figures. If there is a specific project in which the Deputy or other Members are involved, and where the Department should be more active, I am quite happy to engage further with the Deputy on the issue.
17968	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	338	 If the Deputy could make a request to the senior Minister, I will refer to the fact that the issue was raised in the House, along with the matter raised by Deputy Keating.
17969	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	342	 I acknowledge each of the contributions. It is important to state that there are 540 autism-specific classes approved throughout the country. There are specific pockets where there are shortages or where issues may need to be addressed. They can be raised through this forum and on the floor of the House but also by way of direct representations to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, or parliamentary questions. With respect to Deputy Wallace, I would not be expected to be completely au fait with the school to which he refers. Perhaps he would table a parliamentary question to address the specific issue about the services rather than me giving a stock answer. There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistance is provided where the children require it, and sometimes on a one-to-one basis. Funding for home tuition is also available at ten hours per week for children with autism up to three years, increasing to 20 hours per week once the child is three years old if a placement is not available in an early intervention class. I do not know if that speaks directly to Deputy O'Brien's issue but we can engage further on it.
17970	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	343	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together. The surveys of parental preferences were undertaken largely in towns and suburbs. It was also open to parents of preschool or primary school children in rural areas or rural schools to participate in the surveys. The purpose of the surveys was to establish if parents want a more diverse range of primary school patrons in their area. Following on from the recent publication of the results of the surveys of primary school patronage, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has written to the Roman Catholic patrons in the 23 areas where parental demand for change has been confirmed in the most recent surveys. He has requested they consider options for reconfiguring schools under their patronage to allow the transfer of a school to a new patron. The Roman Catholic patrons have been asked to submit an interim response within three months and a final response with detailed proposals on divesting schools within six months. Earlier surveys had been conducted in five pilot areas and, as a result, options for change are also being considered in respect of these.
17971	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	 The surveys were conducted in 43 areas across the country. We have taken the responses to those surveys and are acting accordingly. There is a process under way with the existing patrons to consider the options. There is a timeframe for responses. The small schools issue has not been decided yet so the link with this issue is incongruous. The accusation of hypocrisy, therefore, does not stand. This goes back to the set pieces where questions are put to the Minister and the Deputy is entitled to make whatever political charges he wants. That is part and parcel of the game of politics. I do not see the link between the two, to be honest. Surveys were conducted in 43 areas and we should wait and see what the results were and what response the existing patrons will make.
17972	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	350	 None of us is averse to a bit of political banter from time to time but the purpose of this set-piece is to get to the nub of the questions. Following the recent publication of the results of the survey on primary school patronage, the Minister has written to the Catholic patrons in the 23 areas where parental demand for change has been confirmed in the most recent surveys. A total of 43 areas were surveyed for parental preferences on the patronage of primary schools. Two thirds of the 43 areas surveyed showed sufficient parental demand and, of the areas surveyed, there was sufficient parental demand for a wider choice of school patronage in 28 of those areas to support change in the patronage of schools. Parents expressed a preference for Educate Together as the alternative patron of choice in 25 of the areas and in two areas the alternative patron of choice was the local VEC and community national school model. That is the system of plurality. If in the majority, parents have decided on the existing system of patronage in their area, that is based on a model of collaboration with those parents who have voted with their feet. As a Government, we must respond accordingly. While the Minister might have made an aspirational statement coming from his own view, he is a reforming Minister and he has taken on board the views of parents articulated in these regions and this will be reflected in Government policy in due course. Written Answers follow Adjournment.
17973	SeanSherlock	Labour	14742.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	414	" The researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, are connected to close to 650 distinct companies that employ more than 90,000 people in Ireland. These researchers also leverage significant research funding from non-Exchequer sources, such as the EU and industry, usually in the order of €80 million to €90 million per annum. The SFI also supports more than 20 research centres across the country in fields such as the future Internet, food for health, energy, biomedicine and nanotechnology. Virtually all of the blue chip multinational companies in Ireland are connected to SFI in some way, for example, IBM, Cisco, Pfizer, Roche, HP, Intel, Merck, Microsoft and EMC. Many indigenous firms are also connected, such as the Kerry Group, Creganna and Sigmoid Pharma. The significant investment made through the SFI by successive Governments since 2000 has been complemented by the ramping up in research investments by others in our national innovation system, for example, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Teagasc and others. The impact of this concentrated investment has been a major contributory factor in Ireland coming to be internationally regarded as a credible research-performing nation and is linked to why we have nine of the top ten big pharma-life science companies in the world, 15 of the world's top 25 ICT and technology companies and virtually all of the social media giants, with Dublin arguably now being the Internet capital of the world. Ireland ranked as one of the leading countries in the world for research and development investments. The sustained research investments of the past decade or so are feeding through to the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI. Last year, more than 40% of IDA jobs announced were in companies with links to SFI research teams, accounting for 4,575 of the new IDA client jobs. This trend has continued in the first quarter of 2013, with the SFI being linked to 600 of the 1,100 new IDA jobs announced thus far. Already this year, major research and technology-related announcements have been made by the likes of McAfee, Yahoo, Nypro and Zurich. Since 2004, we have seen a fivefold increase in the proportionality of research-related IDA FDI wins, from approximately 10% worth €120 million to an average of €600 million per annum for each of the past four years of the fiscal crisis, typically representing close to half of all new IDA wins. This State investment is also paying off for indigenous firms. Forfás data in the past three years show that the exports, employment and sustainability of research and development-performing firms consistently outperform those of firms not engaged in research and development. We have also seen a marked improvement in Ireland's international scientific rankings, from 36th in 2003 to breaking into the global top 20 in 2009. Despite our fiscal crisis, we have remained in the top 20. We have caught up and surpassed many of our OECD competitors, but we cannot stand still. Ireland has reached a stage at which it is appropriate to define more precisely the areas wherein critical mass and concentration of our research effort will maximise further returns. This Bill will play an important part in that process. To date, the SFI has focused exclusively on oriented basic research for enterprise development. Oriented basic research is defined as: ""Research which is carried out with the expectation that it will produce a broad-base of knowledge likely to form the basis of the solution to recognised or expected, current or future problems or possibilities"". Basic research is expected to produce results that form the basis for future applications, but which are, generally, some way off the commercial market. The harsh realities of our current fiscal and economic crisis have made us all aware that there are competing and equally compelling demands for Exchequer investment, yet it is imperative that we ensure now, more than ever before, that we achieve the optimum impact from our research investment. Extending SFI's remit to support applied research will be a contributory factor in this regard. Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications. I will briefly refer to the 11 sections of the Bill and I will then elaborate on some of the more significant sections. Sections 1 and 3 set out the definition of terms used in the Bill. Section 2 relates to the expenses incurred by the Minister via the annual financial allocation being made to SFI - to be paid out of moneys voted on and provided by the Oireachtas. Section 4 sets out the revised functions of SFI, which include supporting research priority areas, applied research and science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, activities. Section 5 relates to the provision by the foundation of funding on a wider geographical basis - and seeks to include researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, as well as participating in certain international collaborative projects. Section 6 provides for a consequential amendment to the 2003 Act governing SFI's reporting requirements under its annual reports. Section 7 provides for the repeal of the provisions relating to compilation of the so-called science budget by Forfás. Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the IDA in relation to the Shannon region. Section 9 provides for the new provisions for collection of research and development data by Forfás in place of the provisions repealed by section 7. Section 10 facilitates the amendment of the confidentiality provisions applying to El and SFI in the Freedom of Information Acts. Section 11 provides for the Short Title of the Act, and related citation and commencement provisions. The critical sections of the Bill that are intended to facilitate the realignment of Ireland's research and development policy and that are most relevant to SFI actions are sections 3, 4, and 5. Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2(1) of the Act of 2003 in respect of the terms used in same, particularly as regards the introduction of a definition of ""applied research"". It will also enable SFI to refocus its funding towards the priority areas as identified in the recommendations of the research prioritisation steering group chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel. The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas. The priority areas were chosen on the basis of the existing strengths of our enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and ultimately good jobs for this country. The report of the group was approved by the Government and published in March 2012. The Bill will assist the implementation of some of the research prioritisation recommendations, which involves a process I am currently chairing across 14 prioritisation action group areas. Section 4 lays out the revised functions of SFI. It provides for amendments to section 7 of the Industrial Development Act 2003, in particular in respect of extending SFI's legislative remit to enable it to fund applied research. Applied research is defined as: ""Work undertaken in order to gain scientific or technical knowledge and directed towards a specific practical application."" Enterprise Ireland administers a number of research and development programmes involving direct grants to companies to develop and support industry-led, market-focused applied research. However, these El programmes start at a stage in advance of the point where many researchers find themselves, as the possible uses for their basic research results have not yet been explored. Therefore, a gap exists within our existing research ecosystem that impedes the pursuit of the potential applied research opportunities that often arise from oriented basic research. By extending SFI's remit to include applied research the Bill will take the outcomes of the oriented basic research funded by SFI closer to market, increasing the potential of our research to yield commercial opportunities, jobs, and other societal benefits. At this juncture I will refer to some recent misinformed commentary in various media on research prioritisation and the extension of SFI's remit into the applied research arena, for instance, that such actions signal a so-called death knell for fundamental basic research in Ireland and that the Government is no longer committed to science, technology and innovation. This commentary does not reflect what is actually happening. On 25 February 2013, we had the largest ever research announcement of its kind in this country, involving seven large-scale research centres, supporting 800 researchers, and representing a total investment of €300 million over the next six years, €200 million of which will be provided by the Exchequer via SFI and a further €100 million coming from more than 150 industry partners. At the end of January, we also had €60.8 million of new SFI investigators awards across a range of fundamental research areas, primarily the life sciences, ICT, mathematics and energy. In November 2012, SFI also announced €30 million in key research infrastructure awards. All three of these significant research announcements by Government, through SFI, are underpinned by talented basic research scientists. All of the above is of direct relevance to supporting basic research excellence in this country that is directly relevant to our economic and societal development. One can add to those examples the fact that SFI's budget for 2013 was maintained at very close to 2012 levels, as was the basic research funding allocation of approximately €35 million being provided to the Irish Research Council this year. To return to section 4, this section also includes a new function to enable SFI to promote and support awareness and understanding of STEM. That was originally a function of the discover science and engineering, DSE, programme initiated by Forfás in 2003, the objective being to heighten STEM awareness so as to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics; promote a positive attitude to STEM careers; and foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics, and their value to society. In March 2012, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, transferred responsibility for delivery of the DSE programme from Forfás to SFI on an administrative basis. The Bill now puts SFI's science awareness activities on a proper legislative footing. Where appropriate, SFI will consult the Minister for Education and Skills on STEM related issues. The House will be aware that I am Minister of State in both of those Departments. Moving on to section 5, under the Industrial Development Act 2003 as it stands, SFI at present does not have the power to directly fund research groups outside the Republic of Ireland. Section 5 will grant additional powers for SFI to provide funding to researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, thereby advancing opportunities for collaboration between research groups North and South. This section will also allow SFI, subject to the Minister's consent, to enter cost-share collaborative research arrangements with international partners in areas where Irish researchers have real potential to achieve added value from such arrangements. International collaboration on research brings together resources, pools knowledge, enhances scientific excellence, and thereby achieves greater success in addressing research problems and delivering greater efficiencies. It opens up access to external non-Exchequer funding, facilities and networking opportunities for Irish researchers that would not otherwise be available. When opportunities arise, it is important for Ireland, through SFI and other national funders, to be ready and available to participate in international programmes in areas where Ireland has research strengths. The European Commission's proposals for research and innovation funding for the period 2014 to 2020, Horizon 2020, include allocation of co-funding for member state collaborations, subject to ""clear financial commitments of the participating countries, including prior commitments to pool national and-or regional investments for transnational research and innovation"". Therefore, as part of Ireland's efforts to maximise our drawdown from EU research funding, it will be necessary to be in the right position to engage in EU common-pot arrangements, where appropriate. I will turn briefly to some of the other matters dealt with in the Bill, in sections 7, 8, 9 and 10. Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI and IDA vis-à-vis the Shannon region. By so doing, the Bill will facilitate the reorganisation of enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone. In 2011, in recognition of the severe financial difficulties that Shannon Development faced following the collapse of the property market, the Government agreed to review the future role of that agency. Deputies will be aware that Shannon Development engages in property transactions and, unfortunately, the crash has severely impacted upon the company's ability to raise revenue in this way. Following careful consideration of this matter, the Government agreed in principle in May 2012 to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and to merge Shannon Airport and Shannon Development into a new aviation-focused entity which would lead to the optimisation of enterprise development arrangements in the region. The Government decision also provided for the transfer of Shannon Development's functions relating to indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment, FDI, to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, respectively, and directed that a plan for the delivery of those functions by these agencies be developed. In September 2012, when seeking approval to draft the appropriate amending legislation to enable IDA Ireland and El operate in the Shannon free zone, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, indicated he was happy to take this step in advance of any further legislative changes that would be required to create the new entity. Subsequently, in late November 2012, the Government considered further proposals submitted by Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. The Government confirmed its earlier decision that a merged, State-owned, commercial entity be established, NewCo, by 1 July 2013, comprising the Shannon Airport Authority and a restructured Shannon Development to exploit its combined assets as a catalyst for the development of sectoral opportunities, particularly within the aviation sector, including the creation of an international aviation centre of excellence centred on the airport. The process is ongoing and involves the drafting of comprehensive legislation to create the new aviation-focused company. I assure the House that this is a priority item for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, working in consultation with my Department. Progress on this exciting project is being monitored by a high level steering group. Sections 7 and 9 provide for reform of the legislation governing the collection of research and development data by Forfás. The Science and Technology Act 1987 provides for the preparation by Forfás of a science budget on a periodic basis and obliges bodies funded under the science budget to supply to Forfás such information in such form and at such time as it may require. The data, collated and published biannually by Forfás as the science budget, measures overall expenditure on science and technology in the Government sector. However, the areas of expenditure measured do not align with current international practice for the monitoring of science, technology and innovation, STI, expenditure. Consequently, the resulting survey is neither a useful policy tool nor an effective use of staff resources. Therefore, deletion of these provisions via section 7 is proposed for administrative efficiency. Through section 9, Forfás will continue to compile, on an annual basis, a major component of the science budget, known as government budget appropriations or outlays on research and development, GBAORD. This is an internationally comparable metric carried out using harmonised concepts and definitions from the OECD and is required under an EU Commission regulation relating to statistics on science and technology. Section 10 affords an opportunity to align the legislation governing SFI and El with the Freedom of Information Acts, specifically by facilitating amendment of the confidentiality provisions that apply to both agencies. While the FOI Acts apply to both agencies, at present section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1998 in respect of El, and section 17 of the 2003 Act in respect of SFI, prohibit disclosure of confidential information by board members, staff and other specified persons. Through this Bill it is proposed to make these sections subject to the FOI Acts, thereby allowing for disclosure of confidential information in accordance with those Acts. I commend the Bill to the House."

It will deal with the immensely difficult set of circumstances facing approximately 50,000 undocumented Irish in the US over a long time. The Bill will introduce a three-stage process for these people. Those who were in the US before 31 December 2011 and have remained since will become registered provisional immigrant, RPIs, which will allow them to work and travel in and out of the United States. That takes in a ten-year period, with a further adjustment after that to lawful permanent residence - the green card - and after a further three years, they may apply for citizenship if they wish to. It is a clear pathway. Under the Bill, there will be E3 visas available for new Irish immigrants to the US, who can work for up to two years. It is not the case that the Irish interest in this has been targeted in some way, but immigration is a controversial issue in the US, and 300 amendments to the Bill have been tabled. I met people on Capitol Hill when I was there over the St. Patrick's Day period who told me it is not a question of what happens on Capitol Hill, in the Senate or in the House of Representatives but what happens on chat shows and radio talk shows when it becomes a wider political issue. The Deputy asked what could be done to help. We are very much on top of the matter. I am in regular contact with key people promoting the legislation and the Taoiseach and I spoke with leaders in the US when we were there. The embassy in Washington is also very much on top of this. I know Members of this House on all sides have contacts of one kind or another with different political parties in the United States, and now is the time to use that in a positive way. We should use those links to promote what we want to achieve. In doing so, we must be sensitive to the political reality that immigration in the United States is a sensitive political issue, as it is here or anywhere else in Europe. We must be aware of that sensitivity in promoting our case because this is the first big break in the issue. We have always stated that comprehensive immigration reform was the way to resolve the problem of the undocumented Irish and there is now a Bill that I am anxious to see pass. This involves real politics and members of the House of Representatives and the Senate are subject to lobbying of various kinds as well as public comment. We are lobbying our case and we should use any contacts we have to further it.

18007	SeanSherlock	Labour	14777.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	322	 All the work which the Government is doing through the Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform our economy from one that became over dependent on property, construction and debt to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports. The Action Plan for Jobs is focused on sustaining and creating employment for new entrants to the labour market and the unemployed, many of whom are under 25. There is strong evidence that the plan is working. The IDA has had the best two years in a decade for jobs growth while Enterprise Ireland companies are winning new markets and growing employment significantly. Over the past 15 months, the private sector has added 1,000 jobs per month. While it is true that there are continued job losses in more traditional sectors that grew disproportionately during the credit bubble, such as construction, financial, insurance and administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, including ICT, digital gaming, tourism and the agrifood sector. Many of the jobs on offer in these sectors are particularly attractive to young people. In addition, the Government has a range of initiatives to support young people to prepare for employment through job experience and training. These include provision by the Department of Social Protection for over 85,000 job placement, work experience and back to education beneficiaries in 2012, and the JobBridge internship scheme, which has had over 17,400 participants to date, with over 60% of participants securing jobs after their internships. Some 6,077 interns were participating last week and a further 2,189 internships were offered by companies. In Springboard, over 200 courses are available throughout the country designed to meet current and future skills needs in Ireland and in the momentum programme, specific projects will also be available to those under 25 to assist them to enter or return to employment. Other initiatives include the ICT action plan, offering training and conversion courses for the ICT sector and the EU youth guarantee being developed by the Minister for Social Protection. Additional information not given on the floor of the House My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland’s competitive start fund and new frontiers programme, along with the microenterprise loan fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs. Last week, we commenced a consultation on how we can better promote entrepreneurship in Ireland and we will be looking in particular at the scope to increase youth entrepreneurship. The Government recognises that there has been an increase in net emigration, particularly among young people, since the start of the recession. In the year to April 2012 net migration reached 34,000, of whom 26,000 were Irish nationals. This reflects the impact of the crash which over a three-year period saw the loss of over 250,000 jobs in the private sector. The concerted drive to make employment a top priority across the whole of Government is helping to alter that outlook for employment. Employment in the private sector is now growing by 1,000 per month. The Government’s aim is that, by continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the Action Plan for Jobs, we can provide opportunities for employment in Ireland.
18008	SeanSherlock	Labour	14777.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	326	 I will provide some figures and interrogate them correctly. I acknowledge the report to which Deputy Tóibín refers. Of the 87,000 people who have emigrated from Ireland in the year up to April 2012, less than half of them, 40,600 people, were not Irish. Many of them were non-Irish people who came to Ireland over the previous decade or so for work and are now returning home. The CSO figures show 53,000 people came to Ireland last year and 20,600 were Irish nationals returning home. Extrapolating from the figures, the years from 1992 to 2012 show a certain number of Irish people choosing to emigrate for career or personal reasons. I beg indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

With regard to youth unemployment, of the 68,000 people within the age category to which Deputy Tóibín refers up to 2012, the 15 to 19 year old category contains 18,500 people who are unemployed, with 49,500 in the 21 to 24 year old category. The idea of these schemes and the best way to ensure people do not emigrate is to ensure there is a place for people to reskill, retrain or remain within formal education. That gives them the best chance of an opportunity. There is a myriad of schemes, training programmes and educational places doing that at present.
18010	SeanSherlock	Labour	14777.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	330	 The bottom line is that we want as many young people to be given the opportunity and we must create a supply of courses and upskilling. Let us take the figure of 18,500 in the 15 to 19 year old category. Why are 18,500 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 unemployed? There is no reason they cannot fit into a course, a placement, an internship or continuing education to ensure we can extrapolate from the figure of 18,500, which would cause a serious dent in the youth unemployment figure. The same applies to the category of those aged 20 to 24. When figures are quoted, the language being used refers to Irish people emigrating. It is important to interrogate the figures and extrapolate from them because there is a natural rate of people who are welcome to this country, who work in this country and will return to their native lands.
18011	SeanSherlock	Labour	14777.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	332	 It is important to acknowledge it. The demand side issue to which the Deputy refers is being tackled. The Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of regulatory measures to encourage business. It is acknowledged that demand has bottomed out but the Government is trying to put in place a set of measures to address the 250,000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2011. These jobs were allied, for the most part, to the construction sector so we must invest in new areas of opportunity in the sector. Those young people, who are working in mines in Australia as we speak because they have construction-related degrees, will come back and have other areas of opportunity. The Government is not resting on its laurels. With regard to the youth guarantee, it is my understanding - and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, can clarify it further - that this is still part of the negotiations under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

The motion only calls for two simple actions - to initiate a debate through civil society on the future direction of the EU and to ensure treaty change includes a process to allow members to voluntary leave the eurozone and not the Union. What was missing from the Government contributions was a discussion about the future of the Union. That is a sign of the problems in the State and the Government. There is no discussion about the future. I remind Members that Barroso, Hollande and Merkel are all talking about the future and they have a map and a plan of where the future will lie. Barroso has said in the past that Europe has all the hallmarks of an empire. On 7 May, he stated: ""The proposals he will bring forward on treaty change will look like political science fiction but they will be a reality in a few years time"". He is looking to the future and he knows what future he wants for Europe. Hollande wants an EU government with harmonised taxes and budgets to tackle the crisis. Merkel wants more Europe and wants to work towards the creation of a European army. They know the future they want and is it because the Government parties know what it is that they do not want to have this debate and do not want the people to know where the future lies. The future is a united states of Europe or a federal Europe with an army and a centralised government in which a nation such as Ireland will have no say and will only be a small part of it. The amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are interesting. The parties have pegged their political futures and the future of this country to stabilising the euro and getting through this crisis with the euro intact. The trade off for that will be the political science fiction to which Barroso referred coming to fruition. The political parties will peg themselves to stabilising the euro and, in the meantime, sleepwalk the country into the united states of Europe. The Taoiseach stated in the House last June that this would never happen and he would never let it happen on his watch. However, it will happen over the next few years and we will wake up some morning and realise we are in a united states of Europe with everyone wondering how we got there. We will have arrived at that point because we pegged ourselves solely to the preservation of the euro. The only policy the Government is pursuing is to maintain the euro and the trade off for that will be the creation of the European super state that the elite in Europe wants to make a reality. That is the sad reflection of this Government's policy on the eurozone and the euro currency. We should ensure a treaty change to allow a member state to voluntarily leave the euro and leave policy options open. Fianna Fáil said the euro is irrevocably and irreplaceably here to stay. The European Central Bank said the same and that it was never intended that any member state would leave the economic and monetary union but this motion calls for that option. It is a policy option which a Government can pursue but every party in this House has tied itself to the euro and the further integration to complete fiscal union and to the political union which goes with it. Deputy Mitchell accused me of sedition for tabling this motion. I am afraid we need to see more sedition in this House. We saw the sedition of the Labour Party before the election when it promised all sorts of things in terms of what it would do in Europe. However, when it got under the ring of Fine Gael, which is the Irish version of the Tory Party and not anybody on the Independent benches, its sedition was slowly put to an end. We need more sedition and more debate about what the future holds so that we can make our decisions on the basis of knowledge and not blindly follow what we are told to do."

18017	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	 I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on this issue. The Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget. Therefore, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013 to 2014 school year. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. At post-primary level, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. This is in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils. At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option that is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published. It shows these schools have €81 million in discretionary income that is not available to schools in the free scheme. It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable. There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community about the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The issue of providing education for widely dispersed and small local communities does present a particular challenge, especially where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government wishes to foster pluralism in school provision and regards supporting small communities, including minorities to maintain their schools as being part of that policy. With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that Protestant children who require financial support can attend a school of their choice. In conclusion, I wish to confirm that the Minister and Department officials will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland and boards of education on education provision for all areas.
18018	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	 Deputy Ross referred to five Protestant comprehensive schools which do not charge fees. Second level schools such as Kilkenny College and previously Wilson's Hospital, have demonstrated that they believe they can maintain and promote their Church of Ireland ethos through the free second level scheme. I have referred to the report and the analysis which we cannot dismiss. It shows clearly that €81 million of discretionary income is not available to schools in the free scheme and that there is a mechanism funded to the value of €6.5 million annually which allows for the disbursement of moneys through the SEC to pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and, in the absence of financial support, be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. There are mechanisms in place. Fee-paying schools have been treated in budgetary terms in exactly the same way as all other religious ethos schools in a manner consistent with the Constitution. The Department is open to discussions with any fee-paying school of Protestant ethos on transitioning to the free scheme and will look at each case sympathetically and in detail.
18019	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	 Context is everything and the overall examinations infrastructure in Ireland stands up to international scrutiny in terms of the level of educational attainment, etc. I acknowledge the validity of the points made by the Deputies that the number of errors in the examinations is a cause for concern. The State Examinations Commission has expressed its regret for the errors made. In response to Deputy Anthony Lawlor, I have a delegated function as Minister of State and have responsibility for the project maths curriculum, for example. As such, one could say the Deputy is addressing the line Minister on this issue. I take the point he is making which is important. As we are in the midst of the examinations process, it is important to reassure pupils who went through this issue yesterday that the errors will be taken into account in the marking scheme. The State Examinations Commission sets the papers in an independent process, which is very much at arm's length from the Department. Issues arose yesterday, however, for which there must be a degree of accountability to the parent Department in the resolution of such issues into the future. As the Deputies said, what we must do now is ensure we get pupils through the rest of their examinations. We must ensure the remaining examination papers are robustly checked to avoid errors and that there is a reporting mechanism and a degree of accountability by the State Examinations Commission to the Department about what occurred in the papers referred to by the Deputies. From a logistical point of view, in a typical year the examinations involve over 116,500 candidates in over 4,900 main examination centres and 10,000 special centres, over 250 test instruments, 90 curricular and 15 non-curricular subjects, over 6,000 examiners, 3 million individual exam papers comprising over 34 million pages and just under 2 million test items. Notwithstanding that, errors still took place. If we acknowledge the errors took place, all we must do is ensure there is a degree of accountability. There must be accountability for why the errors took place and the reparations in terms of how we ensure it does not happen again. I do not agree with the analysis that we should sack members of the State Examinations Commission, which has been an independent agency since 2003. I strongly believe there should be full accountability in a transparent way with regard to what happened to the papers. I am confident we will get the answers to the questions in due course. While the leaving certificate and junior certificate are ongoing, we should ensure students and parents are assured and remain confident the State Examinations Commission will take into account the errors made. The errors will be recorded and reflected in the marking scheme and no one will be at a disadvantage as a result of the errors. From the initial statement of the State Examinations Commission, I am confident that will take place.
18020	SeanSherlock	Labour	14797.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	 If we are sending a message from the House, the important thing is that we give the assurance that no student can be disadvantaged as a result of an error on the examination paper. I doubt any student is watching these proceedings but if their parents are watching or if this debate is reported, it is important to give them a sense of confidence that whatever errors occurred will be reflected in the marking scheme in a way that ensures students are not put at a disadvantage. I am confident that will be the case vis-à-vis how the State Examinations Commission will handle this matter. I have confidence in it in that sense. I take on board what is being said in respect of a review. We need to get the students over the line for the remaining exams and give them a sense that this will be sorted out. There must be a degree of accountability and whether that involves an entire review is not something to go into at this stage. One must allow for some margin of error in anything one does in life. That is not to justify anything that happened but we must ensure that errors such as those in question 8 and in the CSPE exam, for example, do not happen again. Where fundamental errors occur, checks and balances should be put in place to ensure they are weeded out at an early stage and that there is a proper filtration process. At this juncture, I wish to reassure people that the marking scheme will reflect the difficulties students experienced in the exam and the time lost in terms of answering questions. That must be reflected in some compassionate way and I am confident it will be.

18026	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	 I am in the invidious position of having only five minutes to respond to all of the speakers, so I do not propose to embark on any oratorical flourishes or rhetoric but will merely respond to the points raised. Ireland's corpus of employment rights legislation provides a comprehensive and strong set of rights. The Government has overseen the introduction of further significant reforms in the labour affairs area, including the restoration of the minimum wage to protect vulnerable workers. The historians who will read these transcripts, perhaps in 100 years' time, for the purposes of history should also look at the voting record of some of the Members opposite who have contributed to this evening's debate with regard to their position on the restoration of the minimum wage. We have levelled the playing field for agency workers by bringing their wages into line with their full-time counterparts. We enacted the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 after the High Court found employment regulation orders to be unconstitutional. We concluded the first round of consultations with stakeholders in line with the programme for Government commitment in the area of collective bargaining. Yesterday Deputy Nulty suggested that Ireland's laws on collective bargaining are not in conformity with International Labour Organization, ILO, conventions. It is important to reiterate in the context of the complaint made by ICTU and Impact that the ILO's committee on freedom of association did not find that Ireland is in breach of its obligations under ILO conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights. Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair Supreme Court judgment would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition. No such requirements are a feature of the international conventions to which Ireland is a party and which uphold the principles of voluntary negotiation between employers and workers' organisations. The programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining. We expect to be in a position to conclude the consultations on this commitment shortly and will report to Government in the autumn on the outcome of this process and on what proposals to improve the voluntary system of industrial relations might be introduced in 2013. Reference was made by a number of Deputies to the recent Supreme Court ruling which struck down certain provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 governing the registration of collective agreements. Deputy Calleary in particular drew attention to the implications of the absence of legally binding sectoral agreements. The existence of such legally backed agreements is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the posted workers directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction who may be using employees from lower wage economies do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs. This is a significant judgment which has raised a number of important questions, including possible implications for the 2012 Act. The Government intends to conclude its considerations of the implications of the Supreme Court decision as matter of urgency with a view to providing a constitutionally robust legislative framework in this area. Deputy Nulty asked when Ireland will ratify the ILO convention on domestic workers. During its Presidency the Irish Government has worked in close co-operation with the European Commission to promote the ratification of this important convention in the EU. We have steered through a decision of the European Council which authorises member states to ratify the domestic workers convention. This decision is in keeping with Ireland's efforts to promote decent work for all inside and outside the Union, of which protecting the working conditions of workers is a key aspect, as well as being in line with Ireland's national priority of ratifying this convention. The Irish presidency will deliver the Council decision authorising member states of the European Union to ratify convention No. 189 on domestic workers. Ireland will be among the early ratifiers of this important convention. The forward momentum under the Irish Presidency in respect of the ratification process in the European Union needs to be built upon and there is a need for the European Union to provide leadership in the global effort to promote decent work for domestic workers and develop this sector. Let nobody say the Government is regressive on the rights of workers. I will point to a robust body of EU legislation, with 66 European Union directives in which Ireland is a partner, on improvements in the workplace in terms of safety and conditions. There is an august and robust body of legislation on the rights of workers. If we are considering history it is important that we do not try to revise it in short five-minute bursts of rhetoric. Perhaps we should structure a debate during Private Members' time on the historical narrative and legacy of the Lock-out of 1913 to also look at the fact that in this country we now have wonderful opportunities for younger people in new areas of technology, nanotechnology, immunology and medical devices. We probably have the best research scientists and the best-educated workforce in Europe. We are being provided with new opportunities. Let this be the legacy of 1913. Let this be part of the debate. Let us make space for a proper debate on this legacy, but not in five-minute segments.

18039	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	410	 The Bill has been brought forward to provide a statutory basis for the multi-annual medium-term expenditure framework. I am pleased Deputies have engaged on the Bill and would like to respond briefly to some of the points raised on Second Stage and which we can debate further on Committee Stage next week. Deputy Fleming raised the fact that non-voted expenditure is outside the scope of the expenditure ceilings being legislated for in the Bill. The position is that non-voted expenditure represents expenditure which the Oireachtas has declared by law is to be paid from the Central Fund without annual reference to the Dáil. These are items which are a permanent charge on the State revenues and represent those services which are payable out of the Central Fund by the continuing authority of statutes and are not, therefore, subject to the same type of annual process as voted expenditure. The largest item is the service of the national debt. Other items include Ireland's contribution to the EU budget; the salaries, pensions and allowances of the President, Judiciary and Comptroller and Auditor General; and the expenses of returning officers. It is not true the Dáil is not made aware of Central Fund activity. It is regularly reported in Exchequer statements and the Department of Finance each year publishes detailed accounts of the Central Fund for the previous year, known as the finance accounts. The accounts are prepared under section 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and contain detailed analysis and classification of receipts and issues of the Central Fund as well as details of the national debt. They must be laid before Dáil Éireann not later than 30 September. The Bill does not deal with debt service or other Central Fund charges and consequently does not propose any change to this long-standing practice, which is in accordance with the Constitution. The Government is in favour of, and is taking further actions to bring about, improvements in fiscal reporting and fiscal transparency generally. This will enable Ireland to realise a number of benefits from enhanced fiscal disclosure, primarily in respect of the understanding of and access to fiscal information, which should help to promote and encourage market investment in Government debt. With this in mind, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with the Department of Finance and other agencies, will take appropriate steps to provide more comprehensive, timely and reliable data for fiscal decision making, demonstrate the Government's awareness and management of fiscal risks, promote a more informed public debate on fiscal policy challenges and choices, reassure markets of the overall sustainability of the public finances and facilitate compliance with current and future EU fiscal reporting requirements. Deputy McDonald raised the issue of equality budgeting, which we can discuss further on Committee Stage. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considers the effect of measures across all elements of society when assessing proposals for changes in spending. Among other matters, Deputy Donnelly raised the issue of the timetable for the annual budgetary process. I am happy that the Government has reformed the process substantially and that, in line with our EU commitments, we will have this year's budget in October and the Revised Estimates will be published before the year end. As Deputies will acknowledge, this is an improvement on the present system, whereby the budget is in December and the Revised Estimates volume, REV, is discussed in the middle of the year.
18040	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	412	 In addition, an initiative has been introduced to allow committees to conduct an ex ante examination of the Votes for which they are responsible with the relevant Ministers. There is also a drive to produce published performance measurement information in the REV. The Department is engaging proactively with the Oireachtas committee secretariat to improve the timeliness and quality of the material being supplied to committees in consideration of the annual Estimates with a view to enhancing the understanding of these issues. On behalf of the Minister, I thank everyone who has contributed on the debate. These topics will be debated further with Deputies on Committee Stage.
18041	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	413	 I move: That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(a) and (6)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.
18042	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	416	 I thank Deputy Buttimer for raising this Topical Issue. The HPSC collects data on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses. Data for 2012 showed that the total number of HIV infections reported in all years up to 2012 had risen to 6,629. While the annual numbers of newly diagnosed HIV infections had been decreasing since 2008, there was a slight increase in the overall numbers of new HIV diagnoses in 2012, amounting to 7%, as the Deputy stated. Of the new diagnoses, there were 166 among gay men, the highest number ever recorded in that risk group. This is the predominant mode of transmission of HIV in Ireland. While some aspects of the prevention agenda have proven successful in the past and have reached large proportions of the population, the statistics continue to show that increasingly people are either not hearing or are choosing to disregard the messages, and are engaging in risky behaviours. We need to deliver targeted prevention programmes in order to address this situation through partnership between non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the statutory services. The ongoing high incidence among the MSM group, specifically among the younger MSMs, is a particular cause for concern especially since the MSM group had responded well to awareness and prevention campaigns in the past. Clearly, not only must the messages reach the target audience, but they must make an impact when they do. We must do this in a cost-effective manner that delivers the biggest impact for investment. The Gay Health Network, GHN, and the HSE ran an awareness campaign specifically focused for men who have sex with men, or MSM. This campaign, Man2Man.ie, was promoted over a 12-month period, from December 2011 to December 2012, and comprised four phases, with key messages developed by a peer youth group facilitated by BeLonG To Youth Services. It is therefore very timely and relevant that tomorrow the HSE and the Gay Health Network will launch the results of the joint national HIV prevention and sexual health awareness programme for men who have sex with men. Subject to resources, it is hoped to extend this awareness campaign. The 11th annual Gay Health Forum programme targets younger MSMs and aims to raise awareness, build self-esteem and equip men to be able to make safer sex choices. In the area of responsible sexual behaviour, the ongoing stigma attached to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, STIs, is undoubtedly one of the underlying reasons for the ongoing high incidence level of new cases of HIV and other STIs. On the wider issue of sexual health, the Department of Health has established a high level steering group to oversee the drafting of a national sexual health strategy. It will focus on improving sexual health and well-being and will address the surveillance, testing, treatment and prevention of HIV and STIs, crisis pregnancy, and sexual health education and promotion. Moreover, the strategy will be in line with the framework for health and well-being, which provides a policy framework that addresses the wider determinants of health and health inequalities.
18043	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	418	 To reiterate, I agree wholeheartedly with the points made by Deputy Buttimer, specifically his point that 52% of those concerned are from the heterosexual community. We must bear that in mind in determining strategies. I am not aware of the membership of the high level group affected but I hope it is reflective of all communities. To reinforce the point made by Deputy Buttimer, there is a very strong role for NGOs to play in the health promotion agenda and in making progress on this issue. I acknowledge the points made. There is a role for this House, too, to be proactive in this area through the health committee and by whatever means possible. This is something that affects all of us.
18044	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	420	 I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is attending an engagement in Brussels in his capacity as Minister for Defence. I thank Deputy Broughan for raising a matter of significant public importance. Extended periods of good weather are no excuse for the type of anti-social behaviour referred to by Deputy. The Minister has been informed by the Garda Commissioner that sufficient Garda resources were available and deployed to deal with all the incidents arising. The House will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel and transport, throughout the organisation and the Minister has no direct function in this. Allocation of resources is constantly monitored by the Commissioner and his senior management in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies on a district, divisional and regional level to ensure optimal use of Garda resources. A regional operation plan called Operation Irene has commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region incorporating a range of policing actions to be implemented at identified hot spots, such as public parks, laneways and other open spaces, which may experience an upsurge in anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption with the advent of milder weather, longer evenings and school holidays. The operation commenced on 1 June 2013 and will continue until 31 August 2013. Specifically in regard to the incidents at Howth and Portmarnock, gardaí established checkpoints to identify persons bringing alcohol into the areas in question. A number of arrests were made and significant quantities of alcohol were seized. There was close co-operation with local businesses and in one instance a store owner agreed to remove alcohol from sale, which is be commended. A range of strong legislative provisions is available to the Garda to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides gardaí with powers to deal with anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 provides for the seizure of alcohol in the possession of a person under the age of 18 which a garda suspects is for consumption in a public place. Gardaí may also seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Fixed charge notices may be issued for the offences of intoxication in a public place or disorderly conduct in a public place. This option has the benefit of a more efficient use of Garda and court resources, while also allowing an offender who complies with the notice to avoid a possible criminal record. While the is satisfied that sufficient legislative powers are in place to deal with these issues, he will keep the matter under close review in consultation with the Commissioner. Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the area concerned and that current structures in place meet the requirements of the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service. The Minister is determined that Garda resources will be used in the best, most effective and efficient manner. He remains confident that the primary Garda objective of combating crime will continue to be achieved and that notwithstanding the pressure on the public finances it will be possible for the force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the prevention and detection of offences.
18045	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	422	 To be frank and honest with the Deputy, as I am not the line Minister I am not in a position to answer his specific questions about legislation on minimum pricing and transport. I will, however, refer his questions to the relevant Ministers. The Portmarnock and Howth areas are patrolled from Malahide and Howth Garda station. Malahide Garda station is in the Coolock Garda district, while Howth Garda station is in the Raheny district. These districts in turn form part of the Dublin metropolitan region north Garda division, the personnel strength of which was 733 on 30 April 2013. The personnel strength of Raheny and Coolock districts on 30 April were 176 and 221, respectively. The personnel strength of Malahide and Howth Garda stations were 36 and 40, respectively, on 30 April. While Malahide Garda station is not open on a 24-hour basis, this does not in any way diminish the policing service to the area in question because it frees up gardaí for operational policing.
18046	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	426	 I thank the Deputies for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. While I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Joan Collins regarding the presence of the senior Minister, it should be noted that I am a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills. The Government has maintained the €1.3 billion of annual funding for additional teaching resources and special needs assistants, SNAs, to support children with special educational needs at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. As the Tánaiste outlined to the House this morning, two out of every five adults working in our schools are solely dedicated to catering for the needs of children with special educational needs. We have no doubt about the value of the service that these staff provide and the value children and their parents derive from it. However, we are not in a position to dramatically increase the number of special needs assistants or any other service for reasons of which everyone is aware. No one can doubt the Government's commitment to special education. We have maintained the number of resource teachers and special needs assistants in the system since coming into office, despite enormous budgetary pressures in education and every other front-line service. That said, as a public representative, I am acutely aware of the concerns that have been expressed by parents and teachers in the media in the last 48 hours. We need to be clear in all debates, both in this House and elsewhere, about what these changes mean to ensure we avoid creating any unnecessary distress or alarm. The provision for SNA support for the next school year will remain at exactly the same level as the provision for the current school year. In its announcement the National Council for Special Education pointed to an increase in demand for resource teaching posts of the order of slightly more than 10%. Deputies will be aware that children with learning support and special educational needs are supported through learning support provision and NCSE-allocated resource teachers. In primary schools, learning support is provided through the general allocation model and similar direct provision is made in post-primary schools. These supports have been maintained for this year. The year-on-year growth in the overall student population is approximately 1.3%. This year, the demand for additional resource teachers from the NCSE has grown by more than 10%. While the NCSE is not yet in a position to provide a clear analysis of the underlying reasons for the very large increase in demand this year, it is clear that some of this increased demand arises from the migration of students from learning support provision to NCSE-allocated resource teacher support. This has created a significant additional pressure on the resources available to the NCSE. However, it should also have reduced, by equal measure, the pressure on the learning support resources already allocated to schools. Schools are encouraged to make maximum use of their resource and learning support teaching allocations through appropriate grouping and pairing of children, as appropriate, to ensure children do not lose out on teaching time. This is a vital point for parents to hear because an increase in the use of more collaborative, team-based approaches to teaching can help ensure that no child will face a significant reduction in the amount of time spent with his or her resource teacher.
18047	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	430	 I wish to reiterate two points. The year-on-year growth in the overall student population is 1.3% and the demand for additional teaching resources from the NCSE has grown by 10%. If we are to be serious about this issue, we must interpret that dynamic, which has not yet been done. The NCSE is not yet in a position to provide a clear analysis of the underlying reasons for the large increase in demand this year.
18048	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	432	 There is no overall reduction in resource teacher numbers for the coming school year. The number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education for allocation is 5,265, which is the same as last year. We must ensure we provide the service. That 5,265 is in addition to the 4,450 learning support teachers provided to all schools to support children with less complex learning needs, giving a total of 9,950 teachers for children with special educational needs. We need to hear from the NCSE as to why there is an increase in the overall population of 1.3% and the correlation between that and the massive increase in demand. That needs to be interpreted in some way. We must also ensure we get the best possible use of the €1.3 billion spent annually to support children with special educational needs. That is why we asked the NCSE last year to provide the policy advice on how students with special educational needs should be supported in future. One of the recommendations made by the NCSE in its policy advice is that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools based on the profiled need of each school. On foot of this advice, the Minister asked the NCSE to proceed immediately to establish a working group to develop a proposal for consideration of a revised allocation mechanism as set out in the principal recommendation of the report. The aim of this new mechanism will be to ensure all learning support and resource teacher posts are allocated to schools in line with the schools' educational profile and need for such support rather than using other mechanisms such as the number of students in a school or the number of class teachers in a school. We are conscious there are challenges, and in making any changes to our supports for children with special educational needs, we also need to protect the gains we have made. Based on the allocation of resources from 1993 to now, there has been a massive increase in the level of support by the State for this area. I wish to give assurance that consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any of the recommendations.
18049	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	435	 I am rather disappointed because I thought there might be some imaginative ideas from the Deputy opposite in respect of discussing the actions the Government is taking to address the decline of town centres throughout the country. The Deputy referred to towns within his constituency which are probably similar in character to those in my constituency. I have analysed the situation in the towns I familiar with. During the boom years section 23 investments prevailed and in some instances one could argue these were put together by the party opposite. Now, there is a lack of occupancy in many of the buildings and there are empty storefronts throughout the country as a result of those taxation policies and the ill-informed Government policies of the past. They have led us to the point where many of our towns throughout the country have been hollowed out. If we are to have a reasonable and rational debate on this issue we should not start from the premise that economic history or the decline started only two years ago. We need to go back to 2007 and 2008 onwards in order to figure out where towns are now. I will give the response that I have been given on the rates issue. The action programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between annual rates on valuation of towns and counties. The approach of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and, on the other, increases in rates do not impact negatively on business and employment. In this regard local authorities have already been asked by the Department by way of circular to exercise restraint, and, where possible, reduce commercial rates in 2013. In fairness to many local authorities, this is what they have done or they have maintained rates at pre-existing levels. There are several issues. Why have town centres declined? There significant property rights in this country such that it is very difficult for a town council or a local authority to intervene where a building is not occupied or where it is falling into decline. The property rights of the owner seem to take precedence over the wider social responsibility in respect of the upkeep of the premises. That is one challenge for local authorities in terms of attracting new activity to the main street. There is also the fact that in any town throughout Ireland at the moment there is an increasing number of courier vans delivering goods that have been purchased online. This is having a serious impact in terms of high street retail sales as well. One need only discuss the matter with one's peers, friends and family to get a sense of how much activity is being driven online nowadays. The Deputy made a point about IDA visits. I have no specific knowledge in respect of IDA visits in the areas he referred to but I know from my experience in my region that there have been significant IDA visits. However, often the decision is made by the relevant person, business or company that they wish to locate to larger conurbations because of the particular type of business that is coming into Ireland at the moment, especially in the information and communications technology sector. In this sector, younger companies and younger people are looking to move to clusters around larger conurbations because it is deemed to be more attractive than locating to more regional towns such as my town of Mallow. That is a major challenge as well. Domestic demand has flat-lined. Therefore, to say that the Government is at fault for the flat-lining of domestic demand makes no sense. The Government, in fairness, is trying to create the jobs and replenish the jobs that were lost. A total of 250,000 jobs were lost between 2008 and 2011. Nobody can convince me that if one puts all one's eggs in the construction basket and if that fails, then it would not have a detrimental effect on retail or the shape of towns and retail businesses within towns. We must create the jobs to create domestic demand and we are making a good fist of it although it is taking time. We must be more imaginative in terms of how the planning guidelines, which were issued recently, will impact. We must ensure, as per the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector in order that there is an advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres and contributing to a high standard of urban design.

The remainder of the response will be available to the Deputy. I will respond to Deputy Troy’s supplementary questions.

18056	SeanSherlock	Labour	14806.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-20 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	449	 The memorandum of understanding, MOU, signed by the troika introduced the property tax. Fianna Fáil negotiated the agreement with the troika, which is a sovereign agreement. I do not know the Deputy’s position on the property tax but it should be a significant revenue stream for local authorities and should redress the balance in terms of the burden over many decades that has been placed on businesses in regard to the annual rate of valuation. It will be an opportunity, for instance, for councillors of the Deputy’s party to have a clear policy document and prerogative on how it would be implemented at municipal or local authority level. I look forward to seeing some of those ideas within my own local authority, Cork County Council. The cost of parking is competitive in most towns around the country because there is good interaction between business and local authorities and many businesses are represented on local authorities. The issue is how one regenerates towns. I accept Deputy Troy’s point about energy costs, rates and ability to pay but the singular issue relates to demand. It will take some time to reverse the economic morass in which we find ourselves, such that we can create the jobs to ensure a sufficient level of retail demand. The approach is demand led. I acknowledge the points made about coming forward with ideas for empty shops but because of property rights the local authority cannot force specific types of retail activity into specific areas. It is a difficult thing to do.

18079	SeanSherlock	Labour	14819.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	495	 In general terms, we understand the concerns expressed by the Deputies. There is no intention whatsoever to move away from the model of interaction with parents and that kind of continual monitoring of the students' work and their interaction in the classroom and so on with teachers. We want to ensure we continue to have standardised testing in areas such as English reading, science and mathematics, so those standards are in place, and to have a set of guidelines in place to monitor the quality assurance aspect of this. We want to ensure guidelines on moderation, which will be confirmed by the principal. If there are any vagaries in the system, a mechanism will be put in place to monitor them and to ensure a data profile is set up, so that the national and the individual schools' profiles will be monitored. The results awarded in every school will be sent to the Department, so that there is a national monitoring system in place. It will also be subjected to national and international assessments and a full reporting mechanism will be put in place by 2017. The concerns raised by the Deputies are being worked through the system in advance of the roll-out of the new junior cycle. The first one will be through English in 2014. There will be much learning from that experience in terms of how it will pan out. A significant amount of continuing professional development will be put in place for teachers not only on the pedagogy or the subject side, but also in terms of the modalities of the assessment. There is still some way to go on this.
18080	SeanSherlock	Labour	14819.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	497	 I take the points the Deputy made but I do not agree with her that teachers are professionally developed-out; they are not. As in any profession, we must ensure 100% of the profession take up continuing professional development when it is offered, including the various types of continuing professional development which will become available for this very process. This is an evolving process and there is still some way to go on this. We genuinely recognise the concern articulated by the Deputy and we are very conscious that we are asking teachers to do a lot. We have asked them to do quite a lot in terms of project mathematics and other subject areas and changing the thinking in regard to moving away from learning by rote to a more collaborative learning type of system, which is difficult to do if one has been teaching a certain system for quite a number of years. We are conscious of that which is why we want to ensure the supports are put in place for those teachers who, as the Deputy said, are professionals in their own right. We want to ensure it is a smooth a transition as possible.
18081	SeanSherlock	Labour	14819.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	695	 In the five minutes available I will do my best to address the contents of the Bill. The Bill proposes to extend the discrimination grounds in the Equal Status Acts, which deal with provision of goods and services, but not in the Employment Equality Acts, which cover employment, by adding five or six new grounds for discrimination which have been articulated by Deputy Stanley. The existing equality legislation prohibits discrimination on nine grounds, but also contains a range of qualifications and exceptions to ensure that we avoid unintended and extreme consequences. Thus, discrimination based on age is outlawed, but we ensure that children are protected and special treatment can be provided for older people where that is appropriate. Gender may not be used to discriminate in employment, except, for example, in employment providing intimate caring services. Many of the contributions from the Opposition benches last night covered employment issues, to which the Bill as published does not apply. We were told last night that this is a drafting error that can be easily fixed. However, it is not the type of drafting error that can easily be corrected. That is because there are no exceptions or qualifications proposed in the Bill in respect of the proposed five new grounds. That is a serious omission. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, said last night, equality legislation seeks to eliminate unfair or prejudicial discrimination based on a person's inherent characteristics - gender, race or age, for example - rather than affecting rational assessments of risk based on a person's previous actions. The question of wiping the record of criminal convictions, for example, requires a nuanced approach via spent convictions legislation. I acknowledge Deputy Dara Murphy's point in that regard. In certain employment areas, as well as in the provision of certain goods and services, a history of conviction for serious criminal offences, such as sexual offences, fraud or theft, can be directly relevant risk factors which should be taken into account. The second

18087	SeanSherlock	Labour	14826.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-10 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	" The straight answer to that question is ""Yes"". I will read into the record the issue in regard to the independent copyright review committee. This committee was established in May 2011 and its aim is to examine the Irish copyright framework in order to identify areas that might be considered to create barriers to innovation and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified, whether at national or EU level. I expect this committee will present its final report during this month. I agree that we in this country must ensure we strike a balance to ensure that, where new business models are coming forward in this digital age - Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the digitalised society - we create a legislative package that is in line with the times we live in. I agree the legislation is possibly outdated in that sense. The copyright review is an independent process and is being done on a pro bono basis."

We want to ensure that if the recommendations of that independent review group state that changes to legislation are needed, we will have to look seriously at what those recommendations are in the first instance. I have not seen the report, although we are expecting it this month. It could be that Ireland wants to place itself ahead of the EU curve. It must be remembered that we are at present hindered in some respects by the EU's legislative framework on copyright.
18089	SeanSherlock	Labour	14826.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-10 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	 I would like to come back in if I can.
18090	SeanSherlock	Labour	14826.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-07-10 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	" I have not seen the report because it is an independent body and we have absolutely respected the fact it is independent. The terms of reference set out by the Government are to examine current national copyright legislation and identify any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation, and to identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation. There might be a challenge where there is both EU legislation and national legislation, and where a national legislature like our own might want to move ahead of the EU position. On the other hand, it might transpire that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended, bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by the EU's directives on copyright and related rights and other international obligations. The terms of reference also included making recommendations for changes to EU directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting creativity and promoting and facilitating innovation. Everybody recognises the right to protection of copyright but there are so many new business models that have evolved in an online setting in this digital age we live in. Given the fact our own situation is such that we have so many ""born on the Internet"" companies present here in Ireland and employing thousands of people, the legislation has to be framed in a way that is reflective of the times we live in."

18101	SeanSherlock	Labour	14897.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-19 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	190	" I move: ""That Report Stage be taken now."""
18102	SeanSherlock	Labour	14897.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-19 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	 I sincerely thank Members for their constructive and positive approach to the consideration of this Bill. The primary changes extending SFI's remit through this legislation are as follows. As well as continuing to supporting oriented basic research in accordance with its current remit, SFI will now be able to fund applied research through funding supports via the higher education institutions. Essentially, this will allow SFI to bring research outcomes closer to the market through increased commercialisation, the development of new products and the generation of new services and technologies. Ultimately, this will lead to the creation of new sustainable quality jobs for the country. The legislation will also enable the realignment of the strategic focus of SFI to cover the strategic areas identified in the research prioritisation steering group and approved by the Government in March last year. Significantly, the legislation will for the first time also enable SFI to provide funding on an all-island basis, enabling it to fund researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland linked with institutions or companies in the State, subject to excellence and strategic criteria being met. It will also allow SFI to enter, subject to the consent of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, collaborative arrangements with international partners and help Ireland leverage significant non-Exchequer research funding into the country. In doing so, it will also enable Ireland to support the wider EU research agenda through programmes being supported under the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme which will have a budget of more than €70 billion in the period 2014 to 2020. I am particularly proud that the Irish Presidency chaired these negotiations and, personally, proud of the work all of our agencies and Departments have done in reaching a successful political conclusion of the negotiations. As former chairman of these negotiations, I am proud that we will potentially have a funding stream of approximately €1 billion which will surpass the target set in the current framework programme. The Bill also provides a legislative basis for SFI to stimulate the study and awareness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects. In addition, there are a number of ancillary provisions in the Bill that are not specific to SFI but which relate to enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone, amendment of the freedom of information, FOI, Acts specific to the enterprise agencies, and strengthening Forfás's function to provide research data so as to fall in line with international best practice. The Bill is extremely important for Irish research. It affords us an ideal opportunity to build on a decade or more of sustained and necessary Government investment in research and development. In an Irish context, as a small open economy that is very much affected by outside developments in Europe and the wider world, it is not tenable to avoid substantial research and development investment in the hope of taking advantage of and benefiting from research discoveries elsewhere. The bottom line is that research outcomes generate economic gains and research performing countries are careful to protect their research and development investment. In such a context, Ireland must be equally forward thinking in its approaches to creating improved research and development outcomes. The Bill fits the bill in that regard. I am particularly encouraged by the all-island and international partnerships aspects of the Bill. Such collaborations present the potential for gaining great added value from our research investment in leveraging investment into the country and will simultaneously bolster our capacity to generate programmes capable of attracting Horizon 2020 funding from the European Union. In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation I am keen for Ireland to aggressively target Horizon 2020 funding and the extended Science Foundation Ireland legislation will support our efforts to enhance our success rate in this regard. The promotion of the study of stem science technology, engineering and mathematics subjects is also a great interest of mine in my complementary brief as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills. It is essential that our school students receive the right stimuli to encourage their interest in these areas. They are, after all, the pipeline that will produce Ireland's engineers, mathematicians and scientists of the future. Therefore, the outreach and awareness work undertaken by Science Foundation Ireland in these areas is of the utmost importance. This is reflected in the legislation. I thank everyone who has contributed to the formulation of this legislation. I thank my colleagues in the House for their input into it. I am very confident that the Bill will play a significant role in turning these good ideas into jobs. It is worth noting that the global innovation index 2013 shows that Ireland is ranked tenth out of 142 countries. In July 2013 Nature magazine, the eminent scientific publication, cited Ireland as one of five up and coming countries for research. Only last Friday I was extremely pleased to welcome the publication of an innovation indicator which classified Ireland in the highest category of top performers. According to the new indicator of innovation output, Sweden, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg are the EU member states which are deriving the most benefit from their innovation. We are hitting the right metrics and targets. This legislation will be important in ensuring we can continue on that road.

18107	SeanSherlock	Labour	14924.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-10-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	297	" The Government is committed to the vision of using research and innovation to generate jobs and economic growth. Within the constraints of our economic circumstances, we are maximising the funding available for research, development and innovation and, critically, maximising the impact of this investment on jobs and the economy. I am confident the 2014 Exchequer capital allocation, together with both the capital carry-over to be decided in November and reinvestment of income generated by agencies, will maintain research and innovation allocations in line with the 2013 expenditure. In 2014, Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and Enterprise Ireland will continue to leverage EU and private sector funding for research programmes, building on the successes to date. In 2012, Irish researchers across the country both in industry and in the public research system leveraged over €100 million in funding from the EU's research and development funding programme, the Seventh Framework Programme, up from €93 million in 2011. To date in 2013, over €86.5 million has been leveraged from this funding source. In the coming years, there will be a roll-out of the European Union's next research and development funding programme, Horizon 2020, which was negotiated during the Irish Presidency, and I had the privilege of chairing those negotiations. With a total budget of over €70 billion to 2020, our national research and development community is well placed to win significant funding from Horizon 2020, in the order of €1 billion over the period to 2020, along with funding from other non-Exchequer sources. Significant improvements were made to the research and development tax credit in budget 2014, along with a statement of intent that the research and development tax credit base year will be phased out entirely over time as resources allow in order to improve the overall international competitiveness of the regime. These improvements, which include an increase in the amount of expenditure allowed on a full-volume basis - without reference to the base year - from €200,000 to €300,000 and an increase in the outsourcing limit from 10% to 15%, will increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location for research and development activity and result in additional jobs in 2014. The evidence indicates that the Government's strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return from our science, technology and innovation investment is paying off, as Ireland has just been ranked third in the EU, according to the new indicator of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This proves that we are investing smartly in this area and that our investment is delivering jobs. I will outline some of the research, development and innovation initiatives that will be supported through my Department in 2014. Science Foundation Ireland will establish up to three new large-scale research centres, supporting between 200 and 300 jobs, in areas of national strategic importance, such as medical devices, software, diagnostics, telecommunications, smart grids, and sustainable food production and processing. There will be significant industry engagement and co-funding, at a minimum of 30%, of these sectors. Exchequer funding for these new centres will amount to between €10 million and €15 million in 2014. Additionally, four or five research ""spokes"" will be established by SFI to enable the addition of new industry and academic partners and projects to existing SFI research centres to allow them to expand and develop in line with new priorities and opportunities. SFI will fund 3,000 researchers and over 20 world-class research centres in 2014. These are a key magnet for foreign direct investment and will help ensure that Ireland will become one of Europe's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment, and they underpin existing jobs with world-class research. We have clear evidence of the link between research funding and job creation from foreign direct investment. To date this year, more than 45% of IDA jobs announcements have come from companies with links to Science Foundation Ireland research teams. That is over 3,700 jobs in companies linked to SFI-funded researchers. Foreign direct investment companies play a vital role in the economy, with one in seven jobs being accounted for by foreign direct investment. In addition, foreign direct investment companies contribute €19 billion to the economy, generate more than 70% of corporation tax - some €2.8 billion in 2011 - and account for more than 70% of national exports - €115 billion in 2011. Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to promote and drive effective industry-academic collaboration which is essential for the successful translation of the best new ideas from the laboratory into innovative new products and services and, ultimately, the delivery of good quality, sustainable jobs for the people. In 2014 Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to drive commercialisation from State-funded research, facilitating the emergence of new products and services which will underpin export growth and employment."

I share her concern in relation to the jobs being lost at EJ Ireland Access Solutions Limited, formerly EJ Cavanaghs. IDA Ireland notified the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 21 October that EJ Ireland Access Solutions Limited is currently engaged with workers regarding a restructuring proposal, which will result in the loss of 32 jobs. The company currently employs 51 people. The company has been impacted by the collapse of the constructionsector within Ireland, which was its primary market. The company will retain 18 staff at the Birr plant to deal primarily with sales, marketing, distribution and steel fabrication. It has had to review its business structures due to the collapse of construction activity in the Irish market. Ireland was its primary market when its sales peaked in 2008. Exports at that time accounted for less than 5%. However, at year end 2012, company exports accounted for 30% of its revenue. More and more companies are engaging in this type of restructuring, with companies looking strategically at opportunities in the global market and taking steps, unfortunately, such as making people redundant, in order to position themselves for future growth. The proposed redundancies in Birr are part of adjustments the company is making to meet the evolving needs of the business and to remain competitive in a challenging global environment. IDA Ireland will remain in ongoing contact with the company. Owing to the downturn, all businesses face competitiveness issues, including the manufacturing and services sector. It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing. The Government's action plan for jobs
18112	SeanSherlock	Labour	14932.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	 I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. It is important to note that 18 jobs are still being retained and it is surviving as an entity. One hopes that it will grow over time and that the lost jobs could be clawed back. I also note the point that the Deputy makes on the other technology centres that are available. If the Deputy contacts the local agencies and Department officials about those sites, I am sure there will be a positive engagement on their potential in that region. I acknowledge fully that these are job losses. They are going from 51 employees down to 18, which is a significant number. I understand the Deputy's point on the impact in a more rural setting than in a larger urban conurbation. If we are to have any meaningful role on renewing the manufacturing industry in this country, then it must be on the basis of balanced regional development. However, when companies decide to go to a particular region, it is ultimately a company decision. We all acknowledge in this House that a corporate decision has been made and we can only set out what is available on the ground for these companies, but they are the ultimate deciders of where they locate. However, I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy.

18115	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	 Young people have been the group most seriously affected by the collapse of employment following Ireland’s economic crash. However, youth employment has stabilised in the past year and appears set to start growing as the economic recovery continues. Recent labour market figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of young people under 25 years of age in employment increased by 3,200 in the year to quarter three 2013. The number of young people who are unemployed fell by 13,600 in the past 12 months. The Government is working to tackle the issue of youth opportunities in the labour market through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies. The Action Plan for Jobs has sought to bring about a transition in the jobs and enterprise sectors to develop new job opportunities in sustainable sectors and to create 100,000 jobs by 2016. This work will continue vigorously in the coming years. However, it is encouraging to see record growth of jobs in our exporting sectors and signs of progress across a range of sectors. It will be vital to sustain this growth in employment in order to deliver job opportunities to young entrants. Through Pathways to Work, the Government has brought in a range of new initiatives to support young people looking for employment such as JobsPlus, JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, and the ICT action plan, which are delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government is taking steps to increase the numbers of places and make other enhancements to those schemes where possible. For example, JobBridge has increased from 5,000 places initially to 8,500 places being currently available. The JobsPlus initiative, which is currently available to those who are unemployed for 12 months or more, is being extended from 1 January next to those under the age of 26 who have been unemployed for six months or more. My Department, together with Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring. It is also working with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills to develop the Youth Guarantee, in line with the agreement reached under the Irish Presidency earlier this year.
18116	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	 The youth guarantee was negotiated under the Irish Presidency. A sum of €3 billion will be provided by the European Social Fund and a new budget line of €3 billion will also be provided. We will submit our plan to the EU by the end of 2013. An interdepartmental group has been set up in this regard comprising the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Skills, Public Expenditure and Reform, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach and our Department, and they are all working on the plan. It is important, though, to acknowledge 1,600 jobs a week were being lost in the three years before we took office but now the economy is creating 1,200 jobs per week. Those jobs are being taken up by young people as well. There has been a positive change in employment over the past 12 months.
18117	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	 A total of 19,500 young people have left the live register to take up work in the past 12 months. We have had four consecutive quarters of job creation.
18118	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	 JobBridge is not the panacea for the teaching profession, but the evidence is that we are creating more teaching jobs through the Department of Education and Skills by virtue of demographic changes with an increase in the birth rate, and the Deputy will acknowledge that many projects are under way to reflect that in our own county of Cork. JobBridge is a labour activation measure, which is having a positive effect on getting people into work. Approximately 500 job matches have been taken up as a result of the JobsPlus scheme. MOMENTUM comprises a €20 million package offering 6,500 training places through 36 education providers in 87 locations. We are conducting a review of apprenticeships because if one looks at where jobs were lost, young people were last in, first out. We need to examine, in particular, how we can upskill those who lost jobs in the construction industry, and that is why have introduced Springboard, the start your own business initiative, and the home renovation scheme, which will have a positive knock-on effect in getting young people back into the workplace. There is a vigorous and robust response to this issue, but I take the Deputy's point about the youth guarantee. The plan is being formulated and we can discuss that when it comes to fruition.

18120	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	 I am informed by IDA Ireland that the agency does not have any units or warehouses, which are vacant in County Kerry. Enterprise Ireland does not have a property portfolio as IDA Ireland provides property solutions to Enterprise Ireland clients when required. The responsibility for local authority properties lies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The property to which the Deputy refers is not in the ownership of IDA Ireland. I understand from IDA Ireland that the premises itself was formerly a manufacturing facility and the options for the building in its current format are limited. I am informed that Killarney Town Council is assessing what options may be available for the building, including converting it into an enterprise centre. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have assured me that they are available to provide any assistance that may be required. IDA Ireland owns approximately ten acres of land at the IDA business and technology park, Killarney, which is available for marketing to both overseas and indigenous industry. In addition, the agency has approximately two acres of land at the IDA estate in Killorglin and 1.41 acres in Annascaul, which is also available for marketing. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and client companies employ in excess of 4,900 people across County Kerry, while Kerry county enterprise board has processed 37 projects during 2013 which have the capacity to generate 116 full-time and 53 part-time jobs by 2015. Enterprise Ireland activity in Kerry is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new high potential start-up companies. There are 132 Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county, employing 3,318 people. Additional information not given on the floor of the House There are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of approximately 1,600
18121	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	 The Deputy mentioned County Cork. From the intercounty perspective, there are strong pharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Cork. The Deputy said IDA Ireland had created 163 jobs in 2011 in Kerry. However, it is not IDA Ireland but the companies that come in and conduct site visits which make the final decision as to where they will locate their business. Perhaps we could explore further the dynamic that exists in regard to the number of prospective companies or creators of employment, the number of site visits that take place and the analysis of the visits in terms of the decisions they make as to where to locate their business.
18122	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	 The Deputy mentioned the tourism sector and there has been significant investment by State agencies, such as Fáilte Ireland, to ensure the tourism package in County Kerry is maintained. This supports and creates jobs. The recent decision by the Government to retain the VAT rate for the sector has had a significant impact in terms of job creation and the maintenance of the sector in the Kerry region. The story is not all bleak in County Kerry. The IT in Tralee has a major competence centre and there has been serious investment in companies like Dairymaster, which is seen as an exemplar for the agrifood and business sector. Also, through the centre for intelligent mechatronics and sensors at the Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT, and through the Kerry technology park, there is a strong emphasis and mood towards supporting high potential start-ups and towards ensuring we can concentrate on areas where Kerry has strong sectoral comparative advantages, particularly in the dairy or machinery sector. We will continue those investments. Enterprise Ireland, through the Department, is investing in the competence centre in ITT and that will create jobs in the long term.
18123	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	 Crowdfunding, in respect of enterprise and other activities, is becoming an ever more popular alternative mechanism for businesses and promoters across the globe to access finance in a difficult financial market. In its various forms, crowdfunding allows individuals, businesses and promoters to solicit capital from funders, using social networks and crowdfunding platforms to finance projects. It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Use of the mechanism appears to have seen substantial growth globally in the recent past, and it is seen by many sponsors as a means of democratising access to funds and supply of capital while moving the model away from venture capitalists and angel investors. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has met a crowdfunding company, Linked Finance, to explore the potential for this new source of funding in an Irish context. In addition, as part of a process of exploring new approaches for improving access to finance, departmental officials have engaged at EU level and the small business advisory group has considered crowdfunding and alternative access to finance models. Crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Data are not readily available domestically, at EU level or internationally with which to analyse its impact to date, although moves are afoot at EU level to consider methods to address this data deficiency. The issues of consumer protection and regulation also exercise many countries operating in this space. Decisions are only beginning to be taken in respect of these key elements of this novel way of funding enterprises. The Government, through the State bodies group chaired by the Department of Finance, is keeping the issue under review as to how best to utilise crowdfunding benefits to promote business development. Additional information not given on the floor of the House In terms of supporting access to various forms of financing, substantial funding has been provided by the Government and my Department is actively engaged in various initiatives. For example, my Department provides funding for the HALO business angel partnership, HBAP, through Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland. This partnership provides investment for start-ups and has recently broken a €55 million total investment milestone in 128 deals since the organisation was founded six years ago. In total, €23 million has been invested by angel investors brought to the table by the national HBAP organisation over the past six years. The balance of €32.5 million was committed by seed funds, Enterprise Ireland and other private investors. HALO also works to develop business angel syndicates. Up to 60% of all angel funding in Ireland is coming through individuals, with syndicate groups making up a healthy 40%. My Department has also funded the seed and venture capital scheme 2013-2017 through Enterprise Ireland, which will make commitments totalling €175 million to business during the operation of the scheme. This commitment is expected to leverage a further €525 million in private sector funding. Considerable effort has been put into addressing the seed and early stage funding gap indirectly through commitments to venture capital funds and directly through Enterprise Ireland's investment in the early stage competitive start fund and high potential start-up companies in 2012. Further Government supports include the seed capital scheme, SCS, and the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, which are tax relief incentives for businesses provided by the Revenue Commissioners.

Linked Finance has made presentations to the State bodies group. We are aware of the possibilities of this potential source of funding. We are also aware of the UK initiative through Funding Circle and its £20 million pot. As it is a lending and investment model, we need to examine the tax implications, returns on investment and regulation. We have the seed and venture capital scheme, the HALO business angel partnership. These are other sources of funding which the State provides through its agencies. We are tracking this issue and will be proactive on the matter.
18125	SeanSherlock	Labour	14966.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-11-27 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	 I note the Deputy’s point. Linked Finance has made a presentation to the State bodies group. It is a live issue as a way of providing new forms of financing for enterprises and start-up companies. It is necessary to examine the regulatory and taxation regime as well as the permutations for the people taking the punt, as Deputy Calleary said, to ensure it is robust and they will not be caught out by this. An exemption on profits is also being examined.

18137	SeanSherlock	Labour	14973.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	 I thank Deputy Harris for raising this issue. He spoke about certain reports and interventions made by people whom he named within the community. I do not believe there is a view within the Department that all is rosy. As Minister with a particular responsibility for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education, I can tell the Deputy that the three Ministers within the Department - Deputies Quinn and Cannon and myself - are very much of the view that the pipeline of skills that are so vital for this economy and society must start through a system of policy interventions. I want to tell the Deputy about some of those interventions. On Monday of this week the public consultation phase of the development of a new digital strategy for schools was launched. The potential for using technology in the classroom is huge and we are utterly aware of that potential, but we have to examine what is the actual benefit we expect from using technology in schools, how we measure progress and how we can further embed ICT seamlessly across all curricula. The forthcoming reform of the junior cycle will allow for the optional introduction of school-developed short courses of 100 hours' duration. This will provide further opportunities for schools to progress the provision of courses in ICT. To address the intervention made by James Whelton to which the Deputy referred, a short course on programming and coding, and also in digital media and literacy, will be available to schools for their junior cycle programme from September 2014. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently consulting on the content of these short courses. We must remember that it is important that the content is relevant. We are inviting submissions on that up to 20 December of this year. The focus in schools is on using ICT as a tool in learning. This is supported also by a professional development programme for teachers and by investment in ICT infrastructure. Such infrastructure is vital. By the end of 2014 all second-level schools will be connected to a 100 Mbps broadband service at a cost of €40 million. That will feed very much into this agenda as well. The NCCA has developed a key skills framework at senior cycle in which each skill is broken down into essential elements and learning outcomes. Several of the elements encourage the effective use of ICT for managing and presenting information. As only 59 seconds remain in this time slot and what I wish to say is not covered in my reply, I want to tell the Deputy about the STEM education advisory group, which comprises academics, industry partners and experts in the field of education, including, for example, a representative from the NCCA. That advisory group was set up by myself and it is chaired independently. It is an independent review group that will examine all aspects of STEM education in Ireland and industrial needs. It is easy for constituent groups to make statements about how this affects their realm, but until we map out the entirety of STEM education provision in the country there is no point in formulating a national policy. Individual initiatives are taking place that are worthy. NCCA-related initiatives sponsored by the Department of Education and Skills are taking place, but if we are to truly understand the dynamic at play here, it is vital that we ensure we can map the entirety of the activity. That is the reason we brought in people from companies such as Intel who form part of the membership of the STEM education advisory group, and it is through their interventions that we will be able to map out that activity and inform the policy provisions that need to be made thereafter. We cannot be complacent about this agenda. We are very cognisant of the FIT report and of future skills needs, around which there is no complacency. That is the reason the Department has programmes such as Momentum, which seeks to bridge those gaps. There is a short-term view but, as Minister, I have a tendency towards the long-term view. That is why I had an internal meeting this morning on the area of STEM education provision at primary level. It is at primary level that we have to create the most impact in terms of CPD, the knowledge of teachers and ensuring that all of the stakeholders involved, including industry, are cognisant of the need to ensure there is a throughput and a seamless continuum between primary and post-primary and on to tertiary level. I believe strongly that it is at primary level that we embed a conceptual understanding of STEM education, and that involves ICT provision.
18138	SeanSherlock	Labour	14973.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	 I agree with the points made by Deputy Simon Harris. We must ask whether we should teach ICT as a specific course or assist teachers in improving teaching and learning across the curriculum through the use of ICT. There is a distinction to be made. It is a cliché but children are digital natives. There is a gap in some areas of the education system in terms of the dynamic through which kids learn in the classroom and how they embrace technology outside the classroom. My focus is on content knowledge around science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM. We must use ICT as a mechanism to deliver a greater conceptual understanding of STEM. That is the challenge for our times. Mr. James Whelton is someone who influences people and is a thought leader in respect of coding and teaching teachers to code. We will implement this in the junior cycle and we will see where we go from there. There is a mathematics pilot project in the west of Ireland, championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon. Through embracing courses and pilot projects, we will see how to translate them across the system to create a long-term beneficial impact. Curriculum changes in 2003 in the science curriculum have had a major impact on outcomes in 2013 in respect of the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results. It is too early to map Project Maths onto 2013 PISA results but the next set of PISA results will map the effect of Project Maths and will have a positive effect. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in respect of Project Maths and that is why we have taken a partnership approach. The Deputy mentioned at the outset that industry players are informing us of the skills shortage in respect of their needs. We are trying to meet it and there is a challenge in the short term but we are also thinking in the long term. This is about sustainable jobs in the ICT sector in the medium to long term.

This has ensured the best engineering, planning and public relations consultants in the country are working to the Grid25 agenda. When they try to find people to make a case for them they are scrambling to fundraise to pay fees and they find the selection available is not what it could be if EirGrid were not in the market. We are asking David to take on Goliath and David wants to know that his arguments will be assessed in an independent way. That is why we believe an independent analysis should be carried out in respect of the various factors involved, and this analysis should include input from all stakeholders. On this occasion, the stakeholders must be the communities that will be affected by the plans rather than just the usual suspects. People who may be affected should not only come to realise that fact after the event. They should not wake up with the arrival of a letter from EirGrid three or four years into the project stating that their homes are on a preferred route. It should not be the case that published routes can be changed and that more houses can be affected as a result. Those who were informed last March that they would not be affected by the Grid West project awoke one Monday morning in October to discover that their houses are now bang in the middle of the preferred corridor. When they sought reasons, they were given different answers. During this debate and at meetings of the joint committee, Government Deputies have expressed concerns about both the consultation process and EirGrid's ability or willingness to manage the information flowing from it to the communities involved and to deal with the concerns of those communities. Those Deputies are now going to vote confidence in that consultation process and in an organisation which has not done well to date in the context of dealing with that process or disseminating information to the communities to which I refer. It has never been our intention to have the project suspended. What we are seeking is an independent analysis of the various aspects relating to it. To paraphrase the Taoiseach, Paddy should be given the clear information he requires. If that happens, matters might progress and people might begin to have confidence. None of the communities affected by the project have confidence in either EirGrid or its ability to respect their concerns or to take account of these in the final plan relating to Grid25. The feeling among many in the communities in question is that EirGrid is going to proceed to use the powers already at its disposal - and perhaps additional ones it might be granted next year - to ram the project through, despite the concerns being expressed. This Oireachtas has a responsibility to provide reassurance to the communities involved on economic, health and other grounds. We must ensure that they are not blinded by spin and that they do not roll over in front of the EirGrid juggernaut. With its motion, Fianna Fáil has presented the House with the opportunity to do just that. We all believe in the need to upgrade the grid. However, this cannot be done at a cost to communities and at the expense of community solidarity. Another nasty aspect of the project is that communities which are united and whose members are working well together are being split down the middle. EirGrid is handing out money to landowners in order to try to ensure this matter will be done and dealt with in the near future. EirGrid will eventually move on but the legacy relating to how this project is being implemented will be one of bitterness and division in communities which, to date, have been exemplars of the concept of meitheal and of working together. The Oireachtas is being given the opportunity to state that it wants a different perspective and that an independent review should be carried out. We extend to Government Deputies an invitation to join us in obtaining that which we seek.

With its motion, Fianna Fáil has presented the House with the opportunity to do just that. We all believe in the need to upgrade the grid. However, this cannot be done at a cost to communities and at the expense of community solidarity. Another nasty aspect of the project is that communities which are united and whose members are working well together are being split down the middle. EirGrid is handing out money to landowners in order to try to ensure this matter will be done and dealt with in the near future. EirGrid will eventually move on but the legacy relating to how this project is being implemented will be one of bitterness and division in communities which, to date, have been exemplars of the concept of meitheal and of working together. The Oireachtas is being given the opportunity to state that it wants a different perspective and that an independent review should be carried out. We extend to Government Deputies an invitation to join us in obtaining that which we seek.
18141	SeanSherlock	Labour	14974.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	 I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, who is out of the country on Government business. I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and share their concern about the 570 jobs lost at the Merck Sharp and Dohme, MSD, site at Swords and the 150 jobs lost at the Pfizer site in Newbridge, County Kildare. I express my sympathy on the loss of the jobs and the impact on individuals and their families. Pfizer, like so many companies competing internationally, undertook a review of its operations with a view to reducing costs to ensure the future viability of the plant. This has resulted in 150 jobs losses in Newbridge. The global pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a number of challenges owing to patent expiry and over-capacity within manufacturing and, in this context, Pfizer is no exception. Greater efficiencies and competitiveness are continually being sought across all Pfizer sites in order to compete on the changing landscape. Pfizer is a leading pharmaceutical employer, with 3,200 employees across seven operations in Ireland. The company's capital investment in Ireland since its inception exceeds $7 billion. Pfizer has a key manufacturing presence here in active pharmaceutical ingredients, solid dose pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals. It also has shared services and commercial operations here. The Irish operations manufacture some of its best-selling medicines for arthritis, infectious disease, high cholesterol and cancer. Pfizer has indicated that its other operations in Ireland will not be affected by the decision. In the past two years the company has made two significant investments in Ireland, most recently of €130 million in the Clondalkin and Ringaskiddy sites. Over 600 staff will still be employed in Newbridge. IDA Ireland is working closely with the company to ensure the best result for the site. With regard to the MSD site at Swords, the company is a valued pharmaceutical investor in Ireland. While it announced some time ago the closure of the Rathdrum plant by 2015 - there is now this news about the site at Swords - it continues to employ over 1,100 staff in its other facilities in Ireland, located in Carlow, Cork, Tipperary and Leopardstown in Dublin. Significant investments have been made in these plants. Unfortunately, the company has had to undertake a review of its worldwide manufacturing capabilities to improve overall operational effectiveness. Following the merger of MSD with Schering Plough, the combined operation has excess manufacturing capacity worldwide. Accordingly, the company decided to close the Swords operation by 2017 and transfer production to other factories in the group located in countries abroad. The gradual shutdown of the plant gives a valuable space to seek a new operation for the factory. It is not anticipated that any staff will have to leave before mid-2014 at the earliest and that 130 jobs will be lost in the second half of 2014. The remaining positions will be phased out in the following three years up to the end of 2017. The ultimate decision in both cases is made by the parent company on strictly commercial grounds and what is seen by the companies as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. We keep in close contact with key foreign companies about their operations in Ireland. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, met senior US-based management in MSD last month. The Government has strategies for job creation that are now starting to bear fruit. Unemployment levels have started to reduce and we have had a number of good wins for the country in recent months. While it is of little immediate consolation to the employees of Pfizer and MSD, the macroeconomic indicators show jobs growth. In terms of foreign direct investment, Ireland continues to be attractive because of our corporation tax and research and development tax rates. Over 1,000 multinational corporations have chosen Ireland and they employ 146,000 people directly.
18142	SeanSherlock	Labour	14974.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	 I cannot answer the questions about whether specific meetings have been held. Perhaps we might revert to the Deputies on that point. I do not have the information sought in Deputy Willie O'Dea's first question, but we can find it for him. It is important to note that this is a vital sector in Ireland. We must acknowledge that if some of the entities are facing the patent cliff or are cost centres or profit centres, decisions are taken at corporate and headquarters level and that they have implications for sites such as those in Swords and Newbridge. These are private entities and we are at the mercy of decisions taken at corporate level. That does not mean, however, that we are not trying to anticipate global trends in the pharma sector. In the constituency of Deputy Willie O'Dea we announced the establishment of the SSPC research cluster. It brings the pharmaceutical industry together to look at future trends. While the State may be moving away from investment in research and drug discovery, not that we are taking the eye off the ball, and moving strategically towards manufacturing from the molecule to medicine, these investments, in which we partner the industry, will ensure the sustainability of the industry in this country. The industry has been located here for a long time, part of the reason for which is the current corporation tax rate. If we are to have a debate about trends in the sector, such companies are located here because of the corporation tax rate, the availability of human capital, access to research and development tax rates and research facilities such as the Niberg facility which opened over a year ago. It is a bioprocessing facility.

18144	SeanSherlock	Labour	14974.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	 I thank the Acting Chairman, who is also very good. There is no need to take up any more time. It is worth repeating - this should not be taken as being disrespectful - that I look forward to NAMA completing its work. I also look forward to the end of dole queues and forced emigration from this country. I also look forward to an end in sight for people who are feeling stressed about their mortgages, etc. I hope we can move to a post-recession period, and part of getting there is the work of NAMA.

18147	SeanSherlock	Labour	14981.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	479	 I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Deputy Nash and to clarify the position regarding the supports available for gifted children in schools. The Education Act 1998 requires the board of management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of school boards of management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students. Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able. Syllabi and curricula for second level schools have been designed in such a way as to enable teachers to cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils. The curriculum at primary and secondary school level identifies curricular content and matters relating to the learning process and places strong emphasis on enabling children to learn how to learn. The curriculum also places considerable emphasis on the development of language skills, investigatory and problem solving skills, higher-order thinking skills, working individually and as a member of a group. These skills are encouraged at both levels. Use of information and communication technologies and class and school libraries is meant to benefit all pupils in terms of additional learning. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in collaboration with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment, CCEA, has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students. These guidelines issued to all primary and post primary schools in November 2007, along with a questionnaire for feedback. The NCCA-CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. The guidelines provide advice to schools on the identification of gifted children. They set out profiles of students and identify whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students. The Special Education Support Service, SESS, is a service under the management of the Department of Education and Skills which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including pupils who are exceptionally able. The service is available to schools which may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school. In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, also under the management of the Department, provides training to assist teachers to differentiate for all pupils, whether less or more able. Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the PDST.
18148	SeanSherlock	Labour	14981.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	481	 I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I can assure him that we have a good knowledge of the DCU entity. I would be interested in exploring avenues with other higher education institutes, be they institutes of technology or universities, in regard to the development of similar entities. To be fair, teachers have a number of students to teach within the classroom environment and try to do so to the best of their ability. There may be additional resources that could be provided in a third level academic environment near to where the student lives that might encourage the exceptional needs about which we are speaking. It is an issue on which I have an open mind. The DCU model could potentially be replicated with the willingness of the institutes of technology and universities.
18149	SeanSherlock	Labour	14981.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-12-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	479	 The Minister recognises the importance of combating crime in every part of this jurisdiction. That is why he has succeeded in securing a budget of €1.3 billion for the Garda Síochána during the coming year. Furthermore, it is why he has succeeded, after a period of four years, in lifting the embargo on Garda recruitment. For the first time in four years we are opening up Templemore and new entrants will be going in by the middle of next year. After 32 weeks they will be dispersed throughout the country and communities to do what the Deputy has outlined. That is the reason the Minister has succeeded in getting an extra €9 million to augment the Garda fleet, which is so important in rural areas and every area. A total of 305 new vehicles will be provided by the end of this year. I believe that these steps indicate the importance we attach to providing a safe environment for our citizens in every part of the country, including the Border areas, and, as Deputy McConalogue noted, in my county. I am familiar with what is going on there and I am pleased that there has not been any great escalation of crime. Nevertheless, there are incidents and it is in the interests of everyone to ascertain who carried them out and bring them to justice. Steps have been taken and steps are being taken to enable the Garda and the Commissioner to carry out their work as efficiently as possible.

18151	SeanSherlock	Labour	15023.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	 The Government is committed to the reform of the State's existing workplace relations services. The system that developed during the past 80 years has become unwieldy and complex and is no longer fit for purpose. There was universal acceptance of the need for a root and branch reform of the existing structures. The Minister's objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period. A new two-tier workplace relations structure, comprising two statutorily independent bodies to replace the current five, will be established. There will be a new single body of first instance - to be called the workplace relations commission - and a separate appeals body which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes. The draft scheme of the workplace relations Bill has been approved by the Government for priority drafting. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting is under way. The Minister's intention is to publish the Bill as early as possible during the spring-summer Dáil session, with a view to the new structures being put in place during this year. The legislation will provide for the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to come together within the remit of the workplace relations commission. The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court. Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, in so far as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required are concerned to underpin the workplace relations reform programme, including the following measures which have already been put in place: the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department, to be part of the workplace relations commission; a single contact portal; an e-complaint facility; a staffing and structures plan; a new workplace relations website; an early resolution service; adjudicator training and recruitment plans; and enhanced technologies and processes, including the publication of a request for tender for a customer relationship management solution.
18152	SeanSherlock	Labour	15023.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	 I accept the Deputy's point. Reforming a complex system takes time, but we are committed to that reform and the associated legislative process. From a public service delivery point of view, we must consider the situation as it stands. Prior to 2012, there were more than 100 possible first instance complaints involving 30 complaint forms which could be lodged with five separate bodies. The process of bringing everything together under a workplace relations commission is complex. Practitioners in this area have acknowledged that complexity. We must ensure the legislative approach we adopt is robust and will stand up to scrutiny. It is a case of kicking the tyres, so to speak, before we proceed. The workplace relations Bill will give statutory effect to the reforms we are bringing forward, but the enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary Acts, 12 specified Parts or sections of Acts and 71 statutory instruments. We are committed to implementing these reforms.
18153	SeanSherlock	Labour	15023.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	 I assure the Deputy that drafting is under way.
18154	SeanSherlock	Labour	15023.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2014-01-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together. Overall, in 2014, we have set a target for gross job creation across the enterprise agencies of 27,500: 13,000 in IDA Ireland, 12,000 in Enterprise Ireland, and 2,500 for the LEOs. Targets are not set for individual sectors or the gender breakdown of job opportunities. However, I intend placing a particular focus on manufacturing in 2014. The sector had lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010. It has seen a modest return to growth in employment over the past few years, with an additional 8,000 jobs having been created in the past year alone. There are now 213,600 directly employed in the sector in Ireland and when account is taken of indirect jobs supported, it now supports more than 427,000. The Forfás strategy for the manufacturing sector, which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, commissioned, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016. A complementary report was also published on skills needs by the expert group on future skills needs and Forfás. Arising from the strategy and the skills report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by the Department and relevant agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs. The manufacturing development forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the strategy recommendations which include delivering a national step change initiative to strengthen Ireland's manufacturing base across all firms, addressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland. As the Deputy will realise, innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors, but it is not possible to disaggregate the contribution made by innovation towards overall job creation in those sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. These programmes help companies become more innovative and encourage and support competitiveness. Taken together, we are confident that the measures I have outlined above will help grow sales and exports in the manufacturing and services sectors which in turn will lead to sustainable employment and a reduction in the live register.
18155	SeanSherlock	Labour	15023.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	 No doubt cognisance would have to be taken of parts of the country where there are deficiencies. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, announced this morning an initiative to address broadband needs. In those parts of the country where, for instance, there is mainly familial-type manufacturing businesses that operate outside of larger conurbations, there are certain deficits but we are confident that those deficits will be addressed in the short term.

18161	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	" I move: ""That Second Stage be taken now."""
18162	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	" I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I welcome this opportunity to present the Industrial Development (Forfás Dissolution) Bill 2013 to Dáil Éireann. The Bill was published on 23 December 2013. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the decision to integrate the research and policy advisory functions of Forfás into the Department. As part of the public service reform plan, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to review how the functions currently carried out by Forfás might be integrated with the resources of my Department in order to further enhance the formulation and implementation of national enterprise policy. Following consideration of the matter and engagement with the board of Forfás, the Minister decided, in May 2012, to proceed with the proposed integration. This move forms part of a broader reform programme which we have been progressing across the Department and its agencies, including the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority; the reform of the five workplace relations bodies into two organisations; restructuring the enterprise support model for micro and small businesses, including the dissolution of the 35 CEBs and the creation of the new local enterprise offices; and restructuring transport and enterprise development bodies in the Shannon region. The overarching objective of integrating Forfás into the Department is to strengthen our capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. We envisage improved outcomes in enhancing the operating environment for enterprise and contributing to economic growth and job creation. A key objective is to ensure the distinct strengths and experience of the Department's staff and those of Forfás are maximised to place the Department at the centre of driving economic recovery. Since its establishment in 1994, Forfás has played a significant role in providing independent policy advice and research analysis to the Minister and Department and a key role in progressing the enterprise agenda and facilitating the development of our modern economy. In the past three years, the agency has become increasingly involved in the central policy making process in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, playing a leading role in the preparation of the annual Action Plan for Jobs. At this juncture, it is considered that combining the resources of Forfás and the Department represents the optimum use of scarce resources, particularly against a backdrop of significant reductions in staffing levels arising from the need to reduce the public sector pay bill. Forfás was established in 1994 under the Industrial Development Act 1993 as an agency of the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Its core functions are to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development of industry; encourage the development of industry and technology; advise on the development and co-ordination of policies across the development agencies supporting enterprise; provide independent research in the areas of enterprise and science policy; evaluate enterprise policy interventions; and provide research and administrative support to a number of independent advisory groups, including the National Competitiveness Council, Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Advisory Council for Science,Technology and Innovation. Under the Industrial Development Act 1993 and related legislation, Forfás is statutorily the employer of staff in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland as well as some staff in the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The agency also has responsibility for pensions of enterprise agency staff and employees of a number of former agencies, including the Industrial Development Authority, Eolas, the National Board for Science and Technology, the Irish Goods Council and An Bord Trachtálá. Forfás also carries out a range of shared services on behalf of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and, in particular, Science Foundation Ireland, including the administration of pensions, property management and other central functions. The Irish National Accreditation Board operates as a committee of Forfás and is supported by Forfás staff. It is proposed that the core policy advisory and research functions of Forfás will be incorporated into a new strategic policy division to be established within the Department. The new division will be tasked with a significant range of policy evaluation, co-ordination and planning activities on behalf of the Minister and for the Department's agencies. The key elements of the role of the new division will be in the areas of enterprise policy; competitiveness; horizon scanning; tax policy; the Action Plan for Jobs; trade and innovation policies; education, skills and labour market analysis; and key policy surveys and research. The staff of Forfás who are currently engaged in delivering these functions will transfer into the division within the Department together with relevant support staff from the agency. The capacity to bring forward independent, evidence based, policy recommendations to Ministers and Government is an essential requirement for economic development. Since its establishment, Forfás has provided robust and independent analysis and advice which has greatly assisted the Department and others to formulate policy positions. The Department remains committed, through the new strategic policy division, to ensuring policy advice to Ministers is informed by a robust evidence base and through consultation with relevant stakeholders. Forfás also provides research and administrative support to a number of independent advisory groups, including the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, and Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. As these bodies are an integral component of the overall enterprise agenda, the strategic policy division will continue to provide them with support and secretariat services. The National Competitiveness Council reports to the Minister on key competitiveness issues facing the economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance our competitive position. The council is supported in its work by Forfás which monitors Ireland's competitiveness on an ongoing basis. The role of the National Competitiveness Council in the context of the Forfás integration has been carefully considered. The council's membership has been expanded to incorporate the industry partners appointed to assist with ""disruptive reforms"" under the Action Plan for Jobs and broaden the range of Departments attending National Competitiveness Council meetings in an advisory capacity. The Government has approved revised terms of reference for the NCC to give it greater flexibility to prepare and publish reports on issues it considers important, thereby copper-fastening its independence within the new organisational structure. The revised terms of reference also provide for a specific role for the council in respect of preparation of the competitiveness chapter of the Action Plan for Jobs. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs reports jointly to the Minister and Minister for Education and Skills. It will continue to prepare policy papers independently on skills needs and labour market issues which impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth and will be serviced by the strategic policy division. The current membership of the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation has been stood down, with effect from 25 September 2013, pending the finalisation of the Forfás integration process and overall policy on public service reform. This does not rule out the option of establishing an advisory council of a similar nature on an alternative footing if this is deemed appropriate at some stage in the future. In addition, Forfás undertakes a number of surveys including the annual employment survey, which tracks employment in enterprise agency supported companies, and the annual survey of business impacts, which measures expenditure by agency supported companies in the economy. These surveys play an important role in helping to evaluate the performance of the enterprise agencies and will continue as part of the work of the strategic policy division. Forfás inherited a range of functions and powers on its establishment, originating in the Industrial Research and Standards Act 1961, Industrial Development Act 1986 and Science and Technology Act 1987. The establishing legislation mandated Forfás to assign these powers to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. These powers will now be vested directly in these agencies. The Bill, in section 36, also makes an amendment to the IDA's existing functions. Section 8(d) of the Industrial Development Act 1993 makes provision for IDA Ireland to administer schemes requiring the disbursement exclusively of European Union funds. It is proposed to amend this section to give the IDA the same power as was provided to Enterprise Ireland by section 7(1) of the Industrial Development Act 1998, which allows Enterprise Ireland ""to administer such schemes, grants and other financial facilities requiring the disbursement of European Union funds and such other funds as may from time to time be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance"". The provision in the 1993 Act is considered to be restrictive on the IDA and the amendment will allow the agency to administer schemes which include the disbursement of Exchequer funds, as may be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Previously, the IDA was not in a position to administer schemes such as the employment subsidy scheme which was managed exclusively by Enterprise Ireland, even though the scheme was open to IDA client companies. The non-policy functions which Forfás carries out on behalf of other agencies will be transferred into the Department or to other agencies under the remit of the Department, as appropriate, together with the relevant staff resources. The property management function of Forfás and associated staff transferred to IDA Ireland in July 2013. The legislation provides for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland to become employers in their own right and for each agency to establish a superannuation scheme for its employees. Currently, Forfás is the legal employer of all staff working in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. These staff are seconded from Forfás to their respective agencies. This legislation provides for staff seconded from Forfás to become staff of their respective agencies. Forfás is also the legal employer of a number of staff working in the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and this legislation provides for these staff to become staff of the NSAI. Employees of each of the agencies will become members of their agency's superannuation scheme, as appropriate. The legislation provides for responsibility for all existing pensioners, and those with deferred benefits for whom Forfás currently has responsibility, to transfer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, is the national body with responsibility for the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies. Accreditation is the procedure by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition that a body or person is competent to carry out specific tasks. EU member states have established a network of national accreditation bodies to ensure the competence of all laboratories, inspection and certification bodies are assessed against the same principles. Accreditation plays an important role in guaranteeing the access of Irish products and services to EU and worldwide markets. The demand for accreditation has increased significantly in recent times as national regulators continue to rely on conformity assessment as a mechanism to support the implementation of legislation and assure competence. Responsibility for accreditation in Ireland is currently vested in Forfás. In practice, the accreditation function is delegated to the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, which is a committee of Forfás, supported by Forfás staff in the administration of its functions. The accreditation functions of Forfás will be transferred to the Health and Safety Authority with INAB to be established as a committee of the authority. This mirrors the current arrangements that apply to INAB within Forfás. The Bill provides for the transfer of the accreditation functions and associated staff of Forfás to the Health and Safety Authority by amendment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. As outlined, the purpose of integrating Forfás into the Department is to strengthen the Department's capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The proposal is not driven by the objective of finding cost savings, although some savings may arise in due course if synergies between the two organisations are identified. It is not envisaged that any reduction in staff numbers will arise as a result of the integration. There may be some costs associated with, for example, the reconciliation of IT systems arising from these proposals. However, any such costs will be met from existing resources. Overall, the integration of Forfás into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will facilitate improvements in the use and effectiveness of existing resources. I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill."
18163	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	 I thank the House for its indulgence. This is a rather technical Bill but I am nearly there. Section 37 substitutes a new section 6 into the Industrial Development Act 1995, providing for IDA and Enterprise Ireland to invest or make loans in accordance with schemes drawn up by the agencies and approved by the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This function was previously vested in Forfás and assigned to the agencies. Section 38 provides that schemes which were in force prior to the coming into force of the amendment inserted by section 37 will continue in force as if the scheme had been made under the provision of the new section, that is, section 6 of the Industrial Development Act 1995, as amended. Section 39 amends section 7 of the Metrology Act 1996 to provide that the director of legal metrology shall be a staff member of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. At present, this section states that the director of legal metrology shall be a member of the staff of Forfás. Section 40(a) amends section 7(k) of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998 which relates to the functions of Enterprise Ireland and provides for the Minister to assign other functions to the agency from time to time. Section 40(b) substitutes a new section 42 into the 1998 Act, allowing Enterprise Ireland and IDA to prosecute summary offences relating to disclosure of information. Section 41(a) amends section 7(1) of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 relating to the functions of Science Foundation Ireland and provides for the Minister to assign other functions to the agency from time to time. Section 41(b) amends section 17 of the 2003 Act providing for Science Foundation Ireland to bring and prosecute proceedings relating to disclosures. Section 41(c) amends section 25 of the 2003 Act by the substitution of section 25(2), providing for committees established by the SFI to supply SFI with information for the purposes of its functions. I emphasise that the overarching objective of the Bill is to strengthen our capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The integration of Forfás into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will deliver greater outcomes in terms of improving the operating environment for enterprise and contributing to economic growth and job creation. It will ensure that the distinct strengths and experience of the Department's staff and those of Forfás are maximised to place the Department at the centre of driving economic recovery.

18167	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	 With all due respect, I do not follow the Deputy's point.
18168	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	 As there are 15 or so minutes left in the Deputy's slot, I thank him for his latitude. It is my intention to address only those points that were pertinent to the Bill. Some political points were made, as were a number that were extraneous to the Bill. I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions. I will address a number of the issues raised by Deputy Calleary. I welcome his support for the Bill. His praise for the valuable work done by Forfás since its establishment is well deserved. Forfás is one of those organisations that enjoys the confidence of the polity. As a Minister of State, I have witnessed at first hand the expertise and excellence of its people. Their commitment to public service is unfailing. Bringing the policy capability of Forfás into the Department will give the latter the opportunity to strengthen its ability to shape and implement policy and to oversee the performance of its agencies. Forfás has made a significant contribution to the economy's transformation of recent years, a point that has been made across the political divide. It has been of significant value to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Government in the development of appropriate policy responses to the many enterprise development challenges confronting us. Forfás has provided robust and independent analysis and advice that has assisted my Department and others in formulating policy positions to drive the policy agenda. This speaks to some of the points made by various Deputies concerning independence. The independent nature of the research and advice that Forfás provides is of great value to the Department. It is not intended that this independent thinking will be diminished by the integration process. Forfás's policy and research functions will form the core of the new strategic policy division in the Department. Co-locating Forfás in the Department will streamline the process between policy development and its implementation, serving to strengthen the Department's role in driving economic recovery. Regardless of whether Deputies were speaking for their own constituencies, everyone who contributed to this debate discussed economic recovery in one way or another and the need to drive the jobs agenda. At its core, Forfás will work in the Department with a view to growing jobs and economic recovery. I assure the House that our objective is to maintain the independence that we have come to expect from Forfás's research and analysis. There are precedents in the Civil Service for this type of independent work being conducted within a Department. When Ireland was a recipient of significant structural funds in the 1990s, a number of evaluation units were established in the lead Departments responsible for the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European agricultural funds. Although primarily staffed by civil servants, these units independently evaluated individual programmes and published their reports. A central evaluation unit was later established in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and published its reports. The senior management teams of my Department and Forfás are committed to ensuring that the integration is operationalised in a way that maximises the outcomes in terms of developing and implementing enterprise policy. We are also committed to ensuring that policy advice to other Ministers continues to be informed by robust, evidence-based analysis and through consultation with relevant stakeholders through the strategic policy division. The capacity of Forfás to support independent advice and analysis will also be maintained through its support for the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, EGFSN. The role of the NCC in the context of the Forfás integration has been carefully considered. Revised terms of reference have been approved for the NCC, which will give it greater flexibility to prepare and publish reports on issues it considers important, thereby copper-fastening its independence. I hope that this addresses the concerns expressed by Deputies in this regard. The EGFSN, which reports jointly to the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, will continue preparing policy papers independently on skills needs and labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth. The EGFSN will also be serviced by the strategic policy division. Deputy Calleary referred to a figure of €11 million in respect of the Forfás research budget in 2013. The Forfás research and studies consultancy budget in 2013 was actually €990,000. There was a further allocation of €125,000 for specialised and professional services, giving a total of approximately €1.1 million. If Deputy Calleary wants to provide us with the source of his figures, we will seek to clarify them for him. While the Forfás research and consultancy budget has been incorporated into my Department's budget for 2014, the Minister and the Department are committed to ensuring that the strategic policy division is properly resourced in this regard. There is no intention to reduce the budget in future years. Deputy Calleary also raised the issue of Carrisbrook House. Upon the re-organisation of the enterprise development agencies in 1994, Forfás acquired responsibility for the leasehold interests, maintenance and repair of the former IDA headquarters, Carrisbrook House. Forfás managed the buildings until July 2013, when responsibility for the management of the leases and property transferred to IDA Ireland as part of progressing the integration of Forfás with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Carrisbrook House was originally acquired by AnCO in 1969 on a 65-year full repairing lease. It was one of the Dublin offices occupied by the former IDA up to 1985 when the IDA centralised in Wilton Park House. Since then, Carrisbrook House has been sublet to a number of tenants and was fully sublet by Forfás to the middle of 2008. Approximately 15% of the building is sublet to an embassy and the remainder of the building is unoccupied, but is being actively marketed to potential new tenants. However, the vacating of the space in question coincided with the economic downturn. Every effort has been made by Forfás to seek replacement tenants or to dispose of the leasehold interest. Working with professional estate agents, a number of marketing initiatives were undertaken since 2008. Forfás has also worked with IDA Ireland in marketing the property for potential tenants. In 2011 and 2012, Forfás stepped up direct marketing and during this time there were 12 viewings of the building. In the context of difficult market conditions, and despite a number of engagements with potential tenants, a letting has not been secured. The IDA has now assumed responsibility for all properties formerly managed by Forfás and will continue the efforts to secure tenants for Carrisbrook House. The cost of the vacant space in Carrisbrook House was approximately €1.2 million for 2012. It is hoped that as the economy continues to recover and as demand for commercial premises continues to rise, in particular in Dublin, IDA Ireland will be successful in filling the vacant office space in Carrisbrook House. Deputy Calleary also asked this morning about the Advisory Council on Science, Technology and Innovation, which is supported by Forfás staff. The current membership of the advisory council was stood down with effect from 25 September 2013, pending the finalisation of the Forfás integration process and overall policy on public service reform. This does not rule out the option of establishing an advisory council of a similar nature on an alternative footing if this is deemed appropriate at some stage in the future. There have been many developments in the research and technology agenda over the past two years. The report of the research prioritisation group was published. We have 14 priority areas arising from that report, giving rise to 14 action plans. Forfás plays an integral part in that process. If it was not for Forfás, it would not be as successful a process, such is the good work it carries out. The process will form the main pillar of our research strategy up to 2017. Deputies might say that I would say that anyway, as Minister of State with responsibility for research, but it is very pertinent to my brief. A Deputy raised the issue of pensions. A substantial portion of the Forfás non-pay budget for 2014 has been subsumed into the Department's budget to reflect progress to date on the integration project. It is important to state that Forfás also has responsibility for the pension costs of retired staff of Forfás, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and certain former agencies, such as An Bord Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the National Board for Science and Technology and Eolas, under the Industrial Development Acts 1993 to 2003. As legal employer of 1,150 staff across the development agencies, Forfás centrally manages the pension schemes of Forfás itself and its preceding organisations, the associated pension compliance obligations and related staff benefits and insurance scheme. I hope that goes towards answering the points made about the outturns for 2013 and 2014 in respect of pensions. There are 32 staff and two heads of division to be assigned to the strategic policy division. That question was asked in respect of staffing. Deputy Broughan made a number of points, one of which was about social enterprise. That is not pertinent to this Bill, but there is an interdepartmental group on social enterprise which meets me and the social enterprise task force on a regular basis. If there is an issue with the potential of social economy and community enterprise in north Dublin, the Deputy can contact me and we can facilitate a further discussion on that. Deputy Broughan also raised the issue of the costs of relocating the functions. There are no additional costs associated with the transfer of functions, and Deputy McGrath raised this point as well. The Forfás property function has been transferred to IDA Ireland, along with some shared services functions. Existing budgets in respect of these functions transferred to the IDA and there is no proposal to increase these budgets. There may be some costs associated with the relocation of INAB to the HSA, but these will be relatively small and will be met from within existing budgets. I hope I have answered Deputy O'Brien's point about independent and critical analysis. We all agree that the commitment is there. It is important that the independence be maintained and that the body would have that ability to construct its own reports. There were also issues about unemployment and youth unemployment. I do not intend getting into a macroeconomic debate. There are other mechanisms for addressing those political points that were made. Points were also made about IDA regional development. Specific Deputies made points about their own constituencies. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are revising their regional strategies which will seek to overcome and address problems which may be hampering regional development. I know the IDA recently announced plans to provide offices and buildings in a number of regional locations in the coming years. It is fair to say IDA Ireland actively promotes centres throughout the country, but in my experience, if we look at those companies coming in now, particularly in the technology sector, they are often young companies born on the Internet and they seem to want to cluster in areas where there is already much activity, such as Dublin and larger urban conurbations like Cork and Limerick. They are not inclined to move outside those larger urban conurbations, so there is no doubt that this provides a challenge. Very often the client companies make the ultimate decision on where to locate, following site visits. It is important to recognise that as well. There is no doubt there is still a regional disparity and a challenge in respect of the growth in the eastern side of the country relative to other regional areas. That is something we are addressing through Action Plan for Jobs. The implementation team tasked with overseeing the integration of Forfás into the Department has made considerable progress ahead of the legislation to dissolve Forfás in agreeing with the relevant agencies the most appropriate location for Forfás's non-policy functions. Once the legislation is enacted, we will be ready to commence Parts 2 to 5, inclusive, and section 39, all of which relate to the staff of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the NSAI, in advance of the dissolution of Forfás. More than 1,000 employees currently seconded from Forfás will become employees of their respective agency once these parts are commenced. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will set up individual superannuation schemes for their employees who will leave the existing Forfás and legacy schemes to join these schemes, retaining their respective terms and conditions from their previous superannuation schemes. Therefore, there is no diminution of standards in that sense. We will also commence Part 7 at the same time, which provides for the transfer of the accreditation function and associated staff from Forfás to the HSA in advance of the dissolution date. These staff will join the HSA superannuation scheme, retaining their respective terms and conditions from their previous superannuation schemes. Part 6, which provides for the dissolution of Forfás and the transfer of its functions to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the Minister, as appropriate, as well as the remaining sections of Part 8, will be commenced on the dissolution date, which is to be decided. Decisions have been taken with regard to the reformed structure of the Department once Forfás has been integrated and project teams are working on the practical aspects of the transfer of Forfás staff, records and ICT systems to the Department. We anticipate, therefore, that the dissolution of the agency, integration of its policy and research functions and transfer of approximately 60 staff will take place shortly after the commencement of the Parts relating to the various agencies. I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill. I deliberately did not address issues raised that were not pertinent to the legislation. Deputies - I am guilty too in this regard - have a tendency to take advantage of Second Stage debates to introduce matters which are extraneous to the legislation being debated. While the Bill is technical in nature, it is important legislation which will give effect to the decision to integrate the policy and research functions of Forfás in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It is a valuable part of the Department's contribution to the public sector reform plan. Combining the strengths of the Department and Forfás will help us in our efforts to be a world class enterprise Ministry and enhance the contribution the Department makes to economic recovery. Deputies share in this aspiration to create jobs and generate a sustainable economic recovery that will have a positive impact on society. Forfás, through its staff, will have a major role to play in this regard.

18178	SeanSherlock	Labour	15029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	 I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's overriding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cater for increasing pupil numbers. In June 2011, I announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established up to 2017 to cater for increasing demographic demand across a number of locations. These consist of twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools, including a new post primary school for Maynooth which will assist in servicing enrolment demand in North Kildare. The announcement included the provision of an Aonad in the Maynooth school. In addition, my Department has confirmed, that if sufficient demand for education through the medium of Irish in the Aonad is demonstrated over a four year cycle, consideration will be given by my Department to the establishment of an independent Gaelcholáiste. Maynooth Community College, which will open in September 2014, includes an Aonad. My Department has confirmed that the Aonad has capacity to cater for those students referred to by the Deputy. Kildare and Wicklow ETB is currently progressing the building of a new education campus through the planning process and this will provide permanent accommodation for the school. The school referred to by the Deputy has not submitted an application for additional accommodation to my Department and I understand that it has no plans to expand its current capacity at this time.
18179	SeanSherlock	Labour	15036.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	 I wish I could address every single point that was raised in the debate but in the five minutes I have I will try to stick to the more salient and pertinent points. I note Deputy Donnelly’s Bill. Deputy Wallace has referred to it as Stephen’s Bill. That is something that might catch on in public parlance.
18180	SeanSherlock	Labour	15036.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	 Questions have been asked about the legal reasons the Government has for opposing the Bill. As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, pointed out last night, there are some features of the Bill that give rise to constitutional concerns. One of those is the role of the court. Under the current examinership process the court is sitting over the process, taking into account all the relevant interests of those that will be affected by the rescue and making an independent assessment of the appropriate outcome. In Deputy Donnelly's Bill, the court is less of a feature in the process, only entering it at the very end, when time is running out, or at an earlier stage only if an appeal is made. Another issue of concern is the way in which creditors can pursue their interests. Under existing law, a creditor is heard by the court from the start. That is quite different from the provisions in the Bill where a creditor has to mount a case and meet a high threshold of proof that, in many cases, requires an in-depth knowledge of the company's affairs that would not easily be within his or her remit or to borrow the colloquial expression, within his or her ken. The Bill also gives new powers to examiners to alter the debts owed to others. These appear to be quite wide ranging and may stray into what is more properly the preserve of the courts. When all of the provisions are taken together, as they are in the Bill, there is a danger of making an unjust and disproportionate attack on the property rights of those who have, in good faith, supplied goods and services. Examinership has been on the Statute Book for nearly 25 years. Any proposal for alteration of that tried and tested formula needs careful consideration. The House is currently in the middle of consideration of the Companies Bill 2012 with all its reforms and modernisations that are designed to simplify the establishment and management of a company. As some Deputies acknowledged, only a few weeks ago we enacted the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 to make it easier for small companies to have their examinership cases heard in the Circuit Court. We all share the hopes of those Deputies who mentioned it that it will bring a noticeable improvement once it is in operation, which should be soon. We acknowledge that perhaps we could do more. That is why the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced last night that he is setting up a working group to further examine the remaining recommendations of the Company Law Review Group in the area of examinership to assess whether they offer a viable and less costly solution. The Minister also said that some of the concerns raised by Deputy Donnelly will be examined in the course of the working group’s deliberations. We should thank Deputy Donnelly for the considerable time and effort he has put into the proposals. We all acknowledge his work in that regard. We regret that on this occasion we cannot support the Bill but it is the Government’s firm intention to keep doing all it can to support enterprises so that they flourish. Some points were raised by Deputies about the nature of enterprise supports. Some of those issues can be teased out by a committee. We challenge the numbers in terms of the balance between foreign direct investment and support for indigenous industry but I do not have time to address those concerns tonight.

18193	SeanSherlock	Labour	15038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-07 00:00:00	Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	2	 I welcome this debate and thank Deputy Finian McGrath for tabling this Bill and giving us the opportunity to discuss the allocation of resource teaching supports for pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with Down's syndrome. I am taking the Bill on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who apologises for his absence as he is abroad on Government business today. There is an ongoing court case in the High Court on the issue of resource teacher allocations for children with Down's syndrome, which obviously limits somewhat the contribution I can make to the debate. The Bill proposes to afford statutory recognition to Down's syndrome as a low incidence disability for resource teaching allocation purposes, in all instances, irrespective of a pupil's level of general learning disability as identified in a professional assessment. It also proposes to give statutory effect to the provisions of Department of Education and Skills Circular 02/05 which provides for the level of resource teaching hours to be allocated for all low incidence disability categories. I wish to make clear that the Government does not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage. However, to be very clear about its approach, the Bill will be referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection where it can be considered in the context of the forthcoming proposals to establish a completely new model for the allocation of resource teaching supports in mainstream schools. Rather than fixing the existing flawed system of resource allocations in primary legislation, the Government's preferred approach is to create a
18194	SeanSherlock	Labour	15038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-07 00:00:00	Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	31	 With all due respect, I cannot be blamed for that.
18195	SeanSherlock	Labour	15038.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-07 00:00:00	Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	33	" I am conscious the proposer of the Bill has yet to speak again and only six minutes remain in the slot. I genuinely thank all Deputies for their considered views in the debate. The Government's non-opposition to the Bill is not a cynical ploy. We want to state categorically we have accepted the advice of the National Council for Special Education and there is no question the development of a new model for allocating additional resource teaching support to schools must be explored. The intention of the new model will be to allocate resources as fairly as possible to those schools most in need of these resources and to provide greater autonomy - I cannot emphasise enough the word ""autonomy"" - for schools in targeting the resources to the pupils who need them most regardless of their disability, categorisation or diagnosis and in accordance with the recommendations contained in the report. It is clear the report will fully address the issue raised with regard to pupils with Down's syndrome and the reason we are taking the approach we are on the Bill is to allow for it to be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection where it can be considered in the context of the forthcoming proposals to establish a completely new model for the allocation. I sincerely take the points raised by Deputies on the length of time between now and September 2015, when the report will issue. I certainly will take it up with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, arising from the interventions made by Deputies across the House. All Deputies are mindful of the historical perspective on the challenges and the unconditional love one feels from people in the community. It has been well-articulated by Deputies in certain testimonies and we have all encountered it from people with Down's syndrome. We are genuinely trying to deal with the issue. I understand people are absolutely and utterly frustrated at this stage and I am confident the issues raised on the time-lag will be addressed by the Oireachtas committee, but I assure the House I will take them up with the Minister, Deputy Quinn."

18203	SeanSherlock	Labour	15065.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	" This morning on radio I heard Deputy Joe Higgins describe this debate as narcissistic. However, I view it as an opportunity to explain to the House what I am doing in the area of research and innovation and what endeavours are under way in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. My aim is as much to inform the House on ongoing developments as to articulate - I will not use the word ""celebrate"" - the achievements of the Government to date, given that 250,000 jobs were destroyed during the three years prior to our taking office. It is only right and proper that we should come to the House to give an account to the tribunes of the people. I would not describe myself as a narcissist. These days when I pass a mirror, I tend to avoid looking at my reflection. My hair is receding and turning somewhat grey, while my waistline is expanding. Similarly, I think it is unfair to describe the Government as narcissistic. The Government recognises that we must employ the best of our research and innovation infrastructure to create jobs. Its strategy is to accelerate the economic and societal return on our science, technology and innovation investment, to further strengthen enterprise engagement and take-up of public research and to drive commercialisation. In other words, we want to turn good ideas into jobs. In this way, implementation of research prioritisation which has been under way since March 2012 will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas. These are the areas in which we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs, as well as underpinning platform areas of science and technology and certain integrating infrastructure to support the priority areas. Instead of putting all of our eggs into the construction basket, we are investing taxpayers' money smartly in areas in which we know we will get a return not only for large urban areas but also in regional development. The report of the research prioritisation steering group identified the 14 areas of opportunity which should receive the majority of competitive public investment in science, technology and innovation in the coming five years. The areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system, strengths of the indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprise base, opportunities in the global marketplace and the potential to deliver jobs. A key goal in the process of research prioritisation will be a significantly enhanced focus on collaborative research with enterprise by growing the number of researchers in enterprise and enhancing the flow of researchers between academia and enterprise. The whole-of-government prioritisation action group which I chair is tasked with implementing research prioritisation and significant progress has been made since its inaugural meeting in the spring of 2012. The group operates under the broader authority of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs and meets on a regular basis. The priority areas encompass the areas of energy, food, health, ICT and innovation in business processes and services. Considerable activity has emerged from each of these core areas not only in Dublin, Cork and Limerick but also through the institutes of technology which have a wider regional constitution. Action plans have been developed for each of the priority areas to identify the actions required across research funding organisations. Engagement with relevant stakeholders on the draft action plans took place at the end of 2012 and the plans were approved by the Government in June 2013. Many of the actions focused on addressing specific needs of enterprise in the research community and ensuring appropriate funding was put in place to underpin these 14 areas. Coupled with that, during the Presidency of the Council of the European Union which Ireland held, I was a party to the negotiation on Horizon 2020, an €80 billion fund which is one of the most significant pillars of EU funding. We have set a target for Ireland to draw down €1.8 billion during the lifetime of that programme. I chaired some of the negotiations on that pillar of funding. I am proud to say that the delivery of €1.25 billion to Irish academic institutions partnering with industry will allow us to create the types of job we need to disrupt that flow of emigration so that when graduates are coming out of the universities and institutes of technology there are potential pathways for them to map onto the areas of opportunity of which I spoke, such as ICT, food and medical devices, in a way that allows for them to gain the necessary accreditation from tertiary up to PhD level, but also encourages the creation of the intellectual property and new innovations that are so vital to industry in a way that creates jobs. We have also, since 2012, put in place a new intellectual property protocol. This outlines new structures to encourage more businesses to commercialise research and development by ensuring that they can access the results of State-funded research with greater clarity and certainty. Any business that has an idea can take that idea to an academic institution to see whether it can innovate in a way that creates wealth, new intellectual property, new licensing and, ultimately, jobs, because this is what it is all about. The prioritisation action group, PAG, is also considering how application procedures for research funding can be adjusted to assess relevance to and impact on the priority areas. We have a core standard. It is an excellent standard that is monitored by Science Foundation Ireland, which is leading the way as the core funding agency in this regard. Furthermore, in response to recommendations to align the supply and demand of trained researchers, the Irish Research Council has rolled out an employment-based PhD and master's degree programme in which awardees will be employees, with the majority of time spent in-company. Rather than having PhDs staying within academia - the vast majority of them move out into industry anyway - we are, through a structured PhD, encouraging an increasing number to spend time in companies during the course of their PhD work. This is vital to disrupting the pattern, in a positive sense, to create more companies, spin-outs and spin-ins to sustain the economy for the future. We have created seven world-class Science Foundation Ireland research centres, which we will fund over six years. These centres support the key growth areas. The Higher Education Authority has undertaken a national inventory of all significant publicly funded infrastructure and equipment, and an online portal is being developed. In parallel with compiling this national inventory of all research equipment of large infrastructure, the HEA has developed guidelines for third level institutions on providing access to users from the institutions and enterprise. We are opening up the infrastructure to enterprises and to other institutions so that it is not kept within silos and individual institutions are not proprietorial about the pieces of infrastructure they have within their campuses. We are trying to open up the landscape and break down the silos in a way that allows for greater collaboration, not only in a politically expedient way between institutions, but in a deeper way. It is important that we do so because we are such a small country. The Higher Education Authority, in co-operation with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is currently developing a consistent quality framework for postgraduate education and training, incorporating the structured PhD model. Research prioritisation is about enhancing the relevance and impact of the public investment in research while maintaining the excellence of our research base, further strengthening enterprise engagement and take-up of public research, and driving commercialisation. This is an apolitical space. No one political philosophy in this House underpins what we are doing. I would give due credit to previous Governments that laid the foundations for where we are now through the programme for research in third-level institutions, which allowed us to build out the bricks and mortar. The current paradigm is to drive public investment in research and innovation that yields the maximum impact for society. With seven large-scale SFI centres, we believe that partnership between industry, Government and academia allows the creation of economies of scale in a way that allows us to leverage the opportunities of Horizon 2020, the EU funding stream of €80 billion, which was negotiated on the basis of our studying the great societal challenges of our time - aging, food, health, transport, smart grids, smart cities, etc. By working in parallel with those thematic areas in Ireland, we will achieve greater leveraging opportunities. We believe that by adopting this simple philosophy we will create an impact within a three- to five-year period. It is making an investment for the future. It goes beyond a typical five-year Government mandate. We are trying to lay down a foundation for the next phase of development from the point of view of research and innovation. Over the next six years, the total investment will be over €300 million. SFI, through its multi-annual programme, will provide €200 million and industry will come up with €100 million, in cash and in-kind contributions. By bringing industry to partner with the academic institutions through the creation of these centres, we will create an international impact. The process is collaborative and, as I have said, it works across all institutions. Its purpose is also to map out new opportunities with other jurisdictions. We are strongly of the view that we can collaborate more with Northern Ireland and are aware of the opportunities that will exist between institutions on both sides of the Border. When we launched Horizon at national level, we were cognisant of the need to ensure that, by partnering with institutions in the North, we could create economies of scale that would allow greater leveraging for funding opportunities across each of the thematic areas of which I spoke earlier. We have 156 distinct companies across seven research centres. There will be more research centres to come. Our creation of seven centres of a significant scale has been a success, but we must carefully monitor its impact. We have put in place a set of metrics - clear indicators. If it is taxpayers' money, we must ensure we achieve that impact and are monitoring the work of each of those seven centres. However, the seven centres involve all of the academic institutions in some way, shape or form, and as I stated, it is based along thematic lines. In the research centres, the areas on which we are focusing include big data, data analytics and marine renewable energy. We are looking outwards, towards the sea. People talk about our being a maritime nation. We are looking at the potential for marine renewable energy. We are bringing a lot of industry partners into that and a new maritime research centre is being created in Cork. We are also looking at pharmaceutical manufacturing - in which there are lots of activities throughout the country - as well as drug synthesis, connected health, neonatal care, photonics, and functional foods. We are looking not only at the production of core food products but also at the areas of gut health, in which one can add additional functionality to foods, for example, from the point of view of delivering medicines. We are looking at the next phase of food production. We are also looking at nanotechnology. All of these areas are ones in which Ireland is a significant international leader. We are not starting afresh on the journey. These are areas of core competence in which Ireland has a significant international reputation. This allows us to bring in industry that has been long established and new companies to partner with us to try to create the necessary impact. These are multidisciplinary research teams which cut across enterprise, education, health, the public sector, energy and the environment. In the jobs announcements in 2013 Science Foundation Ireland, SFI had links with 72% of IDA Ireland jobs announcements. The kernel of that is that more of the wins in the foreign direct investment sector are predicated on our strong research and innovation base. It is all about human capital, not just corporation tax. The investment created through IDA Ireland is also predicated on this strong research and development base. We must continue to focus on this and not take the foot off the pedal. The number of jobs associated with the 30 projects was 1,757, of which SFI had links with 1,265. SFI directly supports a cohort of approximately 3,000 researchers across Ireland's higher education institutes. With regard to the policy area for which I have responsibility, science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, we are very much aware of the current Project Maths process. We are driving through the education system a need for greater conceptual understanding by all students of mathematical and scientific concepts. The bonus points for mathematics at post-primary level and Project Maths are having an impact. There will be challenges further down the line. As long as the universities and the higher education institutes control the CAO and CAS systems, there will be a challenge in respect of inflating points where demand increases. We are cognisant of this point. We have also set up a STEM educational review group chaired by Professor Brian McCraith of DCU. We are looking at introducing industry to partner the Department of Education and Skills to move beyond the disparate number of STEM-related projects happening throughout the country. We have many great STEM-related activities that encourage greater understanding by primary and post-primary students in the area of STEM, but we want a national co-ordinated approach. If we partner with industry in a more co-ordinated way, the hope is industry will begin to contribute upfront cash to replicate it in areas that do not have this kind of activity."

This series of amendments proposes to insert the words ""managed and controlled"" into sections of the Bill. When one considers it, the objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. One must think carefully about this and neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law because such an exercise, for the purposes of this Bill, comes within the remit and the function of the Minister for Finance. Moreover, the proposed amendments are illegal under both European Union and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the European Union law on freedom of establishment, which is a core aspect of European Union law. Compliance with this is monitored closely by the European Commission and Ireland recently has been required by the Commission to change a provision of Irish law, which requires that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision, as proposed, would go much further and effectively would require all management activities to occur within the State. This clearly would be a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and would trammel significantly the ability of a company from another European Union member state to establish itself in Ireland. Furthermore, the proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is completely unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Consequently, for these reasons I will not be accepting these amendments."
18215	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	 As one Government Minister among many, we have spent considerable time over the past three years in travelling abroad and encouraging investment. I recently have returned from the mid-west of the United States, where Ireland's reputation regarding the potential for foreign direct investment is very strong. A clear message is coming from the United States of America, to name one country as an example, that there is a clear intent on the part of companies to explore the options of investing in a country like Ireland. Specific meetings have been held with specific target companies through IDA Ireland, companies have been brought out through Enterprise Ireland and no one I have met has mentioned anything about our reputation. The opposite is the case and while I would be interested to see the set of metrics to which the Deputy has access - if there are reputational issues - when it comes to a decision by a company to invest in Ireland, based on the companies that have been attracted here even over the past 24 months, it is clear there is significant interest in Ireland in respect of inward investment and creating jobs.

18217	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	" I move amendment No. 7: In page 83, to delete lines 23 and 24 and substitute the following: “(3) In subsection (2), “person” means, for the purposes of paragraph (b) of it, the company referred to in that paragraph.”. The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to correct the incorrect cross-reference in subsection (3) from paragraph (b) to (a). The purpose of amendment No. 9 is clarification. Deletion of the word ""it"" and its replacement with ""the company"" makes it clearer that the company shall notify the registrar of the authorisation of a person as being entitled to bind the company in the prescribed form. The function of amendment No. 218 is to clarify to whom the notification requirement applies. Section 1081 restates section 229(1) of the 1990 Act. The obligation to notify the Stock Exchange under section 229(1) only applies where shares have been purchased either by the company that issued the shares or by a company that is that company's subsidiary. Section 1081, as it stands, extends this obligation beyond existing law to where shares are purchased by a body corporate, which includes companies incorporated abroad. This amendment is in line with the existing law and purports to maintain it."
18218	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	" I move amendment No. 8: In page 88, line 35, after ""Where"" to insert ""the board of directors of"". The purpose of these amendments is for clarification. The Bill, as it stands, has been interpreted as meaning the board of directors must be registered with the Companies Registration Office. That is not the intention of this section, which is drawn from existing law, Regulation 6(3) of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973, SI 163 of 1973. It provides that where a company chooses to appoint a person to fully bind the company on its behalf, such a company must notify the registrar in the CRO, who will register the person as the company's registered person. Where a company revokes such an authorisation, the person will be considered as a registered person until the registrar is notified in the prescribed form of this revocation. The purpose of such a provision is to reduce red tape for companies that wish to authorise a registered person to have full authority to exercise any power of the company. This will save banks and other third parties from having to search through the minutes of the company's board meetings to check whether a person is authorised to bind the company. This authority is limited by any power of management of the company exercisable by its board of directors or where this Bill requires a power to be exercised otherwise."
