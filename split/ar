18225	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	408	" I move amendment No. 15: In page 93, to delete lines 1 to 15. I have been asked by the Bills Office to inform the House that there is a problem with a footnote to an amendment in this grouping. Amendment No. 244 ought to be accompanied by a footnote to state that section 1019, to which it refers, is being inserted by amendment No. 206. The purpose of these amendments is to correct an unintended change caused by the Bill's structure and to revert to existing law in accordance with the policy intention. Section 45, which is the official seal for sealing securities, restates section 3 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1977 and provides that a company may have an official seal which is a facsimile of the common seal for the purposes of sealing securities issued by the company and sealing documents creating or evidencing securities so issued. Section 3 of the Act of 1977 does not apply to private limited companies. The policy is to restrict the scope of section 45 to public companies and to re-enact the existing law. Thus, this section should be deleted for private companies limited by shares. New sections are proposed to be inserted in the relevant parts to provide for PLCs, PUCs and PULCs. Such public companies shall have an official seal which is a facsimile of the common seal and which has on its face the word ""securities"" or the Irish language equivalent."

18265	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	457	 The Deputy is taking a novel approach, which I admire, but I am not in favour of adopting these amendments. The Deputy's proposals impose unduly oppressive conditions on legitimate businesses. The suggestion that a majority of directors should be EEA-resident may particularly dissuade foreign direct investment companies from doing business in this country, which would be bad for Ireland and for Irish commerce generally. Section 138, which re-enacts existing law, ensures that companies which do not have at least one director who is resident in an EEA state must put in place a bond, in the prescribed form, that becomes payable to a person nominated by the registrar or the Revenue Commissioners. The purpose of the bond is to discharge any fine imposed on the company in respect of an offence committed by it and prosecutable by the registrar or for the purpose of discharging certain fines and penalties imposed on it by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The moneys can also be used to cover expenses that are reasonably incurred in the collection of said penalties. The bond cannot be used for any other purpose. Therefore, the amendments proposed do not achieve any legitimate policy goal. Their sole effect is to create an arbitrary restriction on non-EEA companies trying to do business in Ireland. In that context, the Government will not support the amendments.
18266	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	459	 The Deputy has not said anything with which I would disagree, in principle. There is no question about the importance of the protection of employees. However, the corpus of law that would deal with that issue effectively is employment rather than company law. We have a very enhanced labour relations structure in this country. We also have an insolvency fund which is run by the Department of Social Protection. It is on that basis that we will not support the Deputy's amendments. We do not propose to incorporate the spirit of those amendments, as articulated by the Deputy, into company law because we feel that protections for employees already exist within employment law. Therefore, as I have already stated, we will not be accepting the amendments.
18267	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	 I move amendment No. 61: In page 170, line 19, to delete “In the case of” and substitute “Subject to subsection (1), in the case of”.

The purpose of the further amendment to this section is to make provision for a married person or civil partner and by making the section gender neutral by providing for his or her. This subsection is drawn from existing law and clarifies the use of the terms “surname” and “former forename”.
18269	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	 I move amendment No. 63: In page 176, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following: “(9) If a person appointed a director of a company before the commencement of this section has, subsequent to his or her appointment but before that commencement, become disqualified under the law of another state (whether pursuant to an order of a judge or a tribunal or otherwise) from being appointed or acting as director or secretary of a body corporate or an undertaking, then subsection (1) shall apply to such a case as it applies to a case of a director becoming so disqualified after that commencement. (10) For the purpose of the application of subsection (1) to the case first-mentioned in the preceding subsection, section 150 shall apply as if the following subsection were substituted for subsection (8): “(8) The company shall, within the period of 3 months after the commencement of this section, send to the Registrar a notification in the prescribed form of the change and of the date on which it occurred.”.”.

The purpose of these amendments is to insert a reference to the universal social charge, USC. As the Bill stands, there is a prohibition on the payment of remuneration to a director free of income tax. It is, however, silent regarding the USC. It is proposed this section be amended to include the USC, so that it shall not be lawful to pay a director a remuneration free of income tax and the USC.

The purpose of this amendment is to reflect existing law by helpfully clarifying that directors are granted powers to borrow money and create charges.
18273	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	474	 I move amendment No. 67: In page 182, to delete lines 31 to 34 and substitute the following: “162. (1) A resolution in writing signed by all the directors of a company, or by all the members of a committee of them, and who are for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the directors or, as the case may be, of such a committee, shall be as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors or such a committee duly convened and held.”. The purpose of this amendment is to provide a helpful clarification regarding committees. The section contains supplemental provisions about meetings. The purpose of subsection 1 is to enable directors to decide on any particular matter without coming together for a formal meeting. As committees are also to be allowed use written resolutions, reference to them is included in the first part of the sentence.

The purpose of this amendment is for clarification. Again, notice of every general meeting shall be given to the assignee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt member of the company, that is to say, a bankrupt member who is entitled to vote at the meeting as opposed to a bankrupt member who is not entitled to vote.
18277	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	478	 I move amendment No. 71: In page 195, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following: “(4) Subsection (4) shall apply unless the company’s constitution provides otherwise.”. The purpose of this amendment is to determine the period which must elapse before a meeting must be adjourned for lack of a quorum. The time for the initial meeting has been shortened from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. The amendment to this section allows for the period to be modified by the company’s constitution.

The purpose of this amendment is to widen the section’s scope so as to provide for different methods of storing virtual information. As the Bill stands, the use of the term “server” is too restrictive and many companies now use cloud or hosted solutions to address IT technical requirements.
18280	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	482	 I move amendment No. 74: In page 222, to delete lines 36 to 40, and in page 223, to delete lines 1 to 13 and substitute the following: “219. (1) Subsections (3) and (4) shall apply to any case in which a provision of this Act requires or authorises a notice to be served on or given to a member of a company by the company, or an officer of it, but save to the extent that the constitution of the company provides otherwise. (2) Subsection (5) shall only apply if there is contained in the company’s constitution a provision to the effect that it shall apply (but nothing in this subsection shall prevent alternative and reasonable provision being made in the constitution with regard to one or more of the matters set out in that subsection and, to the extent that such alternative and reasonable provision is made, that provision shall apply instead of that subsection). (3) A notice referred to in subsection (1) shall, save where the means of serving or giving it specified in paragraph (d) is used, be in writing and may be served on or given to the member in one of the following ways: (a) by delivering it to the member; (b) by leaving it at the registered address of the member; (c) by sending it by post in a prepaid letter to the registered address of the member; or (d) if the company’s constitution permits the use of electronic means to serve or give the notice or the conditions specified in subsection (4) are satisfied, by electronic means. (4) The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(d) are— (a) the member has consented in writing to the company, or the officer of it, using electronic means to serve or give notices in relation to him or her; (b) at the time the electronic means are used to serve or give the notice in relation to the member, no notice in writing has been received by the company or the officer concerned from the member stating he or she has withdrawn the consent referred to in paragraph (a); and (c) the particular means used to serve or give the notice electronically are those that the member has consented to. (5) Any notice served or given in accordance with subsection (3) shall be deemed, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary between the company (or, as the case may be, the officer of it) and the member, to have been served or given— (a) in the case of its being delivered, at the time of delivery (or, if delivery is refused, when tendered); (b) in the case of its being left, at the time that it is left; (c) in the case of its being posted (to an address in the State) on any day other than a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, 24 hours after despatch and in the case of its being posted (to such an address)— (i) on a Friday — 72 hours after despatch; or (ii) on a Saturday or Sunday — 48 hours after despatch; (d) in the case of electronic means being used in relation to it, 12 hours after despatch.”. The purpose of these amendments is to improve the ability of companies to service notice in a modern and effective manner.
18281	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	485	 This section contains the form of directors' compliance statement as recommended by the company law review group. Having analysed the provisions contained in the 2003 Act, the group determined that such extra duties, as set out in the Act, would do little to increase compliance. In fact, it would actually result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to businesses. The set-up cost to a business was estimated at €90,000 with the ongoing annual costs at €40,000. A streamlined version of the directors' compliance statement proposed by the group removed the requirement that the statement included a declaration that the company has complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement, as well as the least relevant as companies are already legally obliged to comply with all Acts. Their inclusion in the statement does not add any substantive duties. A majority of the group, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the statement. There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses without adding value in terms of protection and would disadvantage Ireland competitively as it would go beyond other countries and perhaps beyond the regime north of the Border. The directors' compliance statement as it stands has broad support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve the directors' compliance statement, DCS, as it currently stands within the Bill. On that basis, we do not propose to accept the amendment.
18282	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	487	 I move amendment No. 80: In page 233, to delete lines 34 and 35 and substitute the following: “(10) Any reference in this section to a contract — (a) shall be read as excluding a reference to a contract the decision as to whether to enter into it is taken, or falls to be taken, other than by the board of directors or a committee of which the first-mentioned director in subsection (1) is a member; (b) shall be read as including a reference to any transaction or arrangement, whether or not constituting a contract, but, in a case where the transaction or arrangement does not constitute a contract, a like limitation to that which applies under paragraph (a) applies to the construction of reference provided by this paragraph.”. The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification. The Bill, as it stands, may lead to a misinterpretation that could result in a situation where directors may feel obliged to seek board approval for minor matters such as opening deposit accounts. This was never intended to be the case.
18283	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	488	 I move amendment No. 82: In page 240, line 32, to delete “private company limited by shares ” and substitute “company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company”. The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification. The wording as it currently stands is misleading in the context of the overall approach and layout of the Bill and suggests, incorrectly, that company types other than private companies limited by shares are not required to give approval under this section.
18284	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	489	 I move amendment No. 83: In page 242, to delete lines 8 to 10 and substitute the following: “(b) the amount of a company’s relevant assets shall be determined in accordance with section 239(2); and (c) there shall not be reckoned any arrangement entered into in accordance with the Summary Approval Procedure.”. The purpose of this amendment is to provide exemptions in regard to arrangements which have already been properly approved in accordance with the summary approval procedure.
18285	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	 I move amendment No. 84: In page 245, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following: “(7) No approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate unless it is a company formed and registered under this Act, an existing company or a wholly owned subsidiary of a body corporate.”. The purpose of this amendment is to correct an omission. The amendment provides that no approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate, unless it is a company formed and registered under this Act, an existing company or a wholly owned subsidiary of body corporate. As the Bill stands, subsection (6) of section 28 of the Companies Act 1990 has not been included and the amendment rectifies the position.
18286	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	 I am given to understand that a company's tax compliance can be checked out with the Revenue Commissioners, but the Chair may correct me on that. We do not support the amendment, but I believe compliance can be checked.
18287	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	494	 Perhaps we can provide some clarification on that. This is not a logical inclusion in a company's financial statements, but the Deputy may have alluded to this in his statement defending the amendment. Financial statements relate to the company's financial performance, not to its tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government was to consider a requirement to require businesses to obtain and publish a certificate of tax compliance, it would do so in tax law, not company law, in order to catch both company and non-company businesses that also pay taxes. The introduction of this requirement would be entirely without precedent across the European Union. It is on that basis the we do not propose to support the amendment.
18288	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	 I move amendment No. 86: In page 270, line 26, after “company’s” to insert “entity”.
18289	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	 I move amendment No. 87: In page 273, lines 30 and 31, to delete “a record of all goods purchased, and of all goods sold (except those sold by way of ordinary retail trade)” and substitute “a record of all transactions whereby goods are purchased and whereby goods are sold”. The purpose of these amendments is to make certain that all transactions must be recorded in writing, especially in cash businesses. The proposed change will align the company law requirements with those in regulation 27(1)(b) of the VAT regulations and section 886 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in regard to the keeping of records.
18290	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	498	 I move amendment No. 88: In page 274, line 2, to delete “of the services provided or purchased” and substitute “of all transactions whereby services are provided and whereby services are purchased”.
18291	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	 To be helpful, my intention was to suggest we should look into it.
18292	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	" On the face of it, the amendment makes sense, but in the age of cloud computing and remote servers it would place an imposition on businesses because the amount of physical storage facilities they would have to make available could be restrictive if located in city centre locations, for example. Many small offices are located in city centre locations where space is at a premium and would be unable to cope with storing the volume of records that would require to be stored. The amendment would substantially hinder or block outright the use of shared service centres, an area in which Ireland has a particular interest. Since there would be no tangible benefit for any stakeholder and it would be detrimental to Irish commerce, the amendment is - I do not want to use the word ""undesirable"" - not one we support."
18293	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	504	 I move amendment No. 90: In page 278, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words from and including “assets,” in line 18 down to and including “loss—” in line 19 and substitute the following: “assets, liabilities and financial position, as at the end of the financial year, and profit or loss, for the financial year—”. This is a helpful clarification to ensure the section is consistent with the requirements outlined in the Companies Act 1963. It provides that individual and group accounts shall give a true and fair value of the assets at the end of the financial year and the profit or loss for the financial year for both the company and the group.
18294	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	506	" It is a ""true and fair value."""
18295	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	508	 I have three people here who will back me up.

18348	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	562	 I move amendment No. 143: In page 338, line 39, after “signature” to insert “or of a date”.
18349	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	563	 I move amendment No. 144: In page 342, line 1, after “Registrar” to insert “a copy of”.
18350	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	564	 I move amendment No. 145: In page 342, lines 20 and 21, to delete all words from and including “The” in line 20 down to and including “signing;” in line 21 and substitute the following: “With respect to the statutory auditors’ special report referred to in subsection (1) (a copy (as that expression is to be read in accordance with section 353(5)) of which is to be delivered to the Registrar), the original of that report shall be signed by the statutory auditors and bear the date of such signing;”.
18351	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	565	 I move amendment No. 146: In page 345, lines 16 to 18, to delete all words from and including “(1) A” in line 16 down to and including “company.” in line 18. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure this exemption which aims to provide small indigenous Irish companies with audit exemptions is not inadvertently given to a small Irish parent company with substantial non-Irish subsidiaries. The proposed amendment deletes subsection (1) which implies that an Irish company with substantial foreign holdings would benefit from the exemption. The policy intention behind the audit exemption is to give benefit to small indigenous companies.
18352	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	566	 I move amendment No. 147: In page 348, line 25, after “undertakings” to insert “(but this paragraph is subject to subsection (6))”. The purpose of this amendment is to make provision for the fact that foreign subsidiaries in a group do not have to file annual returns in the CRO. This amendment is linked with the amendment to section 360.
18353	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	567	 I move amendment No. 148: In page 349, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “(6) There shall not be reckoned as a subsidiary undertaking for the purposes of this section (other than for the purposes of the expression “subsidiary undertakings” in subsection (2)) an undertaking that is not a company registered under this Act or an existing company and the construction provided for by subsection (1)(a) (of references to each of the relevant bodies) shall be read accordingly.”.
18354	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	568	 I move amendment No. 149: In page 378, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following: “(2) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a mortgage or charge created over both— (a) an interest in anything specified in any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1); and (b) any property, assets or undertaking not falling within any of those paragraphs, the mortgage or charge shall, other than to the extent to which it is created over an interest in anything specified in any of the foregoing paragraphs of subsection (1), be regarded as a charge within the meaning of this Part.”.
18355	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	570	 I move amendment No. 150: In page 381, to delete lines 17 and 18 and substitute the following: “(a) Form 60, 60A or 60B set out in the Schedule of Forms to the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I. No. 483 of 2012) as amended by the Land Registration Rules 2013 (S.I. No. 389 of 2013), or”. The purpose of the amendment is to address any ambiguity there might be as regards the definition of a charge. This section reflects the intent, namely, that charges over cash, deposit accounts, shares, securities and other items listed would not require registration. As the Bill stands, the language is ambiguous, as it could mean that a mortgage or charge, which could involve a number of assets, including, say, one of the excluded ones such as cash, does not have to be registered at all. This was not intended.
18356	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	571	" I move amendment No. 151: In page 381, to delete lines 27 to 41, and in page 382, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following: “(6) If rules are made under section 126 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 or, as the case may be, section 48 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006— (a) replacing a form that is referred to in subsection (4)(a)* or (b), as appropriate, the reference in that provision to the form shall be read as a reference to the form as so replaced, or (b) amending a form that is so referred to, the reference in that provision to the form shall be read as a reference to the form as it stands so amended."". As the Bill stands, the reference to form 112 is incorrect since the Land Registration Rules 2012 came into effect. The relevant form is now form 60. The purpose of amendment in deleting subsection (6) is to clarify that the priority of judgment mortgage is governed by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. Closer inspection has shown that in order to achieve the desired result, subsections (7) and (8), both of which relate to subsection (6), also needed to be deleted. Debate adjourned."
18357	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18364	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent.

Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18373	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	408	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society.

18382	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	419	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes.

Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both.

I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18410	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	452	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support.

We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18419	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	472	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that.

Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18428	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	482	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society.

18437	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes.

Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both.

I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18465	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	530	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support.

We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18474	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	539	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that.

Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.
18483	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	548	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society.

18492	SeanSherlock	Labour	15084.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	558	 I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House and commend Deputy Halligan on his preparation of it. My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes.

Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State. Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State. I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.

18505	SeanSherlock	Labour	15085.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	534	 I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools. It operates in a clear and transparent manner, treating all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location, and on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS band one schools. As part of the 2012 budget decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or fewer. The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012 while the final phase will take effect from September 2014. Labasheeda national school has two classroom teachers in the current school year based on an enrolment of 21 pupils at 30 September 2012. The enrolment at 30 September 2013 was 17 pupils which entitles the school to one classroom teacher for the coming school year. The school is projecting an enrolment of 16 pupils for 30 September 2014. The school submitted an appeal to the February 2014 meeting of the primary staffing appeals board, under the small school criterion, seeking the retention of its second classroom post for the 2014-2015 school year based on the projected enrolment of 16 pupils at 30 September 2014. A projected enrolment of at least 20 pupils on 30 September 2014 would be required for the school to remain as a two-teacher school. Given that it projected just 16 pupils, the appeal was deemed ineligible for consideration by the board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not meet with the appeal criteria. The board of management of the school has been notified of this decision. The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. If other pupils decide to enrol in the school and its projected enrolment in September 2014 increases to the required 20 pupils, then it can submit a new appeal to the appeals board. The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to feature on our education landscape.

18507	SeanSherlock	Labour	15085.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	542	 I sympathise with the Deputy as I too represent a rural constituency, Cork East, where our schools face similar challenges. The Government has set out criteria which are open to the rigours of an independent appeals review. If an enrolment could be increased in September 2014, there is a mechanism for the school and community to come back in.

There was a mix-up on amendment No. 149. I explained the purpose of this amendment to the House believing that we were on amendment No. 149. However, we had, in fact, moved on to amendment No. 150; we were going that quickly. Therefore, I would like to note for the record that the explanation given at amendment No. 150 should have been attributed to amendment No. 149. There is no knock-on effect as amendments Nos. 150 and 151 were grouped and discussed together, so the explanation provided on amendment No. 151 refers also to amendment No. 150.
18512	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	" I move amendment No. 152: In page 383, lines 23 and 24, to delete all words from and including “after” in line 23 down to and including “creditor,” in line 24 and substitute the following: “after giving notice to the person who, for the time being, stands registered as the person entitled to such charge or to the judgment creditor,”. The purpose of this amendment is to allow notice of satisfaction of a charge to be served upon the person when registered as entitled to the charge where the Companies Registration Office has been statutorily notified that there has been a change of lender. As the Bill stands, the notice of satisfaction of a charge must be given to the person to whom the charge was ""originally given"". This is inappropriate given that updating of the register will be allowed under section 410(8) of the Bill. It is more appropriate for the notice of satisfaction of charge to be served on the person then registered as entitled to the charge as if there has been a charge, the original holder will no longer have an interest."

The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that a court may on application and at any time order a scheme of meetings of the creditors or members to be summoned in such a manner as the court directs. The court is given discretion to order scheme meetings to be summoned in such a manner as it directs. This section deals with the convening of scheme meetings by directors and the power of the court to summon such meetings."

The purpose of this amendment is to include a reference to the application of section 480 where the summary approval procedure is employed. As the Bill currently stands, the application of section of section 480 is excluded. This is not what was intended. Without the amendment, the rights of the creditors may be infringed."

We have taken a clear position on them and believe that the legislative process is such that it produces robust legislation. However, there are some points we can consider for Seanad Stage in the Seanad. We may look at the court of jurisdiction, which is an area raised by the Deputy in connection with employee issues. In response to the amendments put forward as they are grouped, we are not in favour of adopting these amendments. We must keep reiterating that the Bill is only concerned with company law. In general terms, company law concerns itself with the fiduciary duties a director owes to the company alone while recognising that a director ought to have regard to the interests of his or her employees. It would be wholly inappropriate to include the proposed provisions in the Bill. Legislation governing employee rights should be considered in the context of employment law. We have stated this several times in the context of other amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies. By addressing such a matter in a company Bill, the provision is not providing protection for all employees, such as sole traders or those working in partnerships. Second, employment law already provides for redress in less cumbersome and costly fora than the High Court. Third, and equally importantly, it must also be borne in mind that company law must balance the rights of all creditors, many of whom are employers in their own right, in winding-up situations. I appreciate what the Deputy is attempting to achieve with these proposed amendments but the simple fact is that company law is not the correct vehicle for these ambitions. Therefore, we are not in favour of these amendments. Amendment No. 168 suggests that a company may be wound up in court where it owes an employee or a group of employees more than €1,500. The Bill sets the limit at €10,000, as it was considered that a greater balance and proportionality must be achieved in circumstances where the severe sanction of wind-up is concerned. The section does not distinguish between an employee and any other creditor. In the circumstances, any creditor is entitled to issue a letter demanding payment and if, after 21 days, such payment has not been received the creditor is entitled to petition the High Court. I am sure the Deputies present can appreciate that petitioning the High Court is not a simple or low-cost exercise. It would have to be questioned whether winding-up is really the most effective way to settle a debt of €1,500. It must also be borne in mind that there are provisions in both employment and health and safety law, alongside common law remedies, which already provide for the type of situation described. For example, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides more efficient remedies for employees who have not been paid their wages than an attempt to have the company wound up in the High Court, with all of the associated costs. Amendment No. 169 would fail in substance as prosecutions thereunder would be doomed to fail due to the ambiguity of the phrase ""breaches of employment law"". There is no indication as to what is meant by this. Such provisions are workable but only in the context of the specific and appropriate enactment, where the transgressions are clearly identified or identifiable. Finally, the amendment proposes that the separate legal personality of the company would be proceeded against for a transgression of civil law rather than criminal law. In all of the other circumstances where this phrase is used, as with health and safety legislation, for example, it requires a criminal offence. Amendment No. 175 suggests that the value of the preferential treatment of employees should be increased to €40,000. The principal benefactors of section 622 are the employees of the company and the Revenue Commissioners. The period for which the calculation is based, in the context of employee salaries or wages in respect of services rendered, is four months before an order to wind up, the appointment of a provisional liquidator or a passing of the resolution for the winding up of the company is made. The sum of €10,000 is considered to offer sufficient protection for employees in these circumstances. I understand the Deputy's intention with these amendments. However, we also need to consider that there are other creditors whose rights must be protected in a winding-up situation. The Bill seeks to offer a fair balance to all."
18530	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	 How would one set out in a schedule what constitutes a transgression? There is a multitude, if not an infinite amount, of potential transgressions. Perhaps the Deputy could articulate exactly how he would propose to do that in advance of the debate in the Seanad. Without being facetious, perhaps he would also outline why the transgressions were not articulated in his amendment.
18531	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	 Excuse me, but the Deputy makes the point for us in his last submission. Transgressions, where they occur, are already sanctioned. For instance, health and safety related transgressions are defined and sanctioned within health and safety law. The same applies to employment law. Having said that, I respect the point the Deputy is making and accept that he wishes to press the amendment.

The purpose of this amendment is to further clarify the 12 month priority period in section 622(2)(a)(ii). The wording used in the Committee Stage amendment was identified as being potentially problematic as it changed the common law position on this matter. This amendment purports to revert to the current established practice whereby the Revenue Commissioners determine the appropriate 12 month period.

18543	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	 I respect that the Deputy raised this matter in some detail on Committee Stage when we opposed the amendment. The staffing needs of the offices of my Department are kept under constant review, including through participation in the workforce planning process initiated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2012. That process required all areas of my Department to provide detailed information on current staffing resources and to estimate the predicted skills needs of each area up to 2015. The offices of my Department are subject to the same constraints and pressures that apply generally across my Department. The moratorium on recruitment and the need to reduce staff numbers to comply with challenging targets imposed by the employment control framework mean that there is little scope to increase staff resources in response to what might otherwise be regarded as a legitimate case for increased resources. Assignments in my Department are made by reference to the priority needs of the Department and its offices as a whole. This will remain the case. On that basis I am not in favour of the amendment.
18544	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	" The Deputy will be aware that there is a transition period of 18 months and there will also be an appropriate commencement period. I am confident those involved in all the agencies across my Department will be well equipped when the time comes to get the message out. The Companies Registration Office is well under way in terms of planning the information campaign and all the inherent publicity planning that goes with it. The Department is also proactively providing information to Deputies as this process unfurls. We have had a number of seminars throughout the country - I was at one in Cork yesterday - entitled ""Taking care of business"". More than 27 State agencies and Departments are offering valuable information to people in their own geographical areas. I have great faith in the ability of my Department and its member organisations to get the message out. They can also deal with any queries that come in, no matter how difficult or complex they are."

(6) For the purposes of the application of this section to the foregoing additional case, this section shall have effect subject to the following modifications: (a) the following definition shall be substituted for the definition of “relevant change amongst its directors” in subsection (1): “ ‘relevant change amongst its directors’, in relation to a company, means the change referred to in subsection (1) of section 151 (as that subsection applies by virtue of subsection (9) of that section), namely the case of a person appointed a director of a company before the commencement of that section and who, subsequent to his or her appointment but before that commencement, becomes disqualified under the law of another state (whether pursuant to an order of a judge or a tribunal or otherwise) from being appointed or acting as director or secretary of a body corporate or an undertaking;”; (b) in subsection (2), after “section 150(8)” there shall be inserted “(as that provision applies by virtue of section 151(10))”; (c) in subsection (3)(a), there shall be substituted the following for subparagraph (i): “(i) in the case of a failure referred to in subsection (2)(a), on the expiry of 3 months after the commencement of section 151; or”; and (d) in subsection (3)(b), there shall be substituted the following for subparagraph (i): “(i) the period of foreign disqualification as remains unexpired as at the date that is specified in paragraph (a) to be the date on which the period of disqualification commences;”.”.

The purpose of this amendment is to remove the reference to the offence under section 878. As the Bill stands, the reference to section 878 is contradictory as the offence of destruction, mutilation or falsification of any book or document can only be committed by an officer of the company and not by the body corporate itself. This section applies where an offence is committed by a body corporate. As regards offences relating to producing, disclosing, destroying or falsifying books or documents belonging to the company, in such cases where the offence can be proven to have been committed with the consent or connivance, or due to the neglect of an officer of the company, that officer together with the body corporate will be guilty of the offence. Where the affairs of the body corporate are managed by its members, this section will apply to those members as if they were a director or manager of the company. This derives from section 241 of the Companies Act 1990.

The function of this amendment is to take account of the fact that ""not exceeding €1,000"" fine formulations are now dealt with by the “class D"" fine in the Fines Act 2010. This section provides that if the contravention in respect of which a person is convicted of an offence under this Bill is continued after the conviction, the person shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention continues.

(1) The provisions of this section shall, in relation to a PLC, have effect in place of subsections (8) to (10) of section 67. (2) In this section— ""bearer instrument” means an instrument, in relation to shares of a PLC, which entitles or purports to entitle the bearer thereof to transfer the shares that are specified in the instrument by delivery of the instrument, and includes a share warrant as that expression was defined by section 88 of the Act of 1963; ""expiry date"", in relation to a permissible letter of allotment, means a date no later than 30 days after the date of the instrument; ""permissible letter of allotment"" means a letter of allotment by a PLC to a member of it of— (a) bonus shares of the PLC, credited as fully paid; (b) shares of the PLC, in lieu of a dividend, credited as fully paid; or (c) shares of the PLC allotted provisionally, on which no amount has been paid or which are shares partly paid up, where the shares are allotted in connection with a rights issue or open offer in favour of members and the shares are issued proportionately (or as nearly as may be) to the respective number of shares held by the members of the PLC, there being disregarded for this purpose any exceptions to such proportionality, or arrangements for a deviation from such proportionality, as the directors of the PLC may deem necessary or expedient to make for the purposes of dealing with— (i) fractional entitlements; or (ii) problems of a legal or practical nature arising under the laws of any territory or requirements imposed by any recognised regulatory body in any territory, which letter is expressed to be transferable by delivery during a period expiring on its expiry date. (3) Save as provided by this section, a PLC shall not have power to issue any bearer instrument. (4) If a PLC purports to issue a bearer instrument in contravention of subsection (3), the shares that are specified in the instrument shall be deemed not to have been allotted or issued, and the amount subscribed therefor (and in the case of a non-cash asset subscribed therefor, the cash value of that asset) shall be due as a debt of the PLC to the purported subscriber thereof. (5) Subsection (3) shall not apply to an instrument falling within the definition of ""permissible letter of allotment"" in this section. (6) Shares comprised in a permissible letter of allotment shall, until its expiry date, be transferable by renunciation and delivery of the letter, but subject to compliance with such conditions (if any) as may be specified in the letter.

(8) Subject to subsection (7), where on the commencement of this section a person has or is entitled to possession of a bearer instrument (other than a permissible letter of allotment), whether as owner or as encumbrancer, nothing in this section shall affect any rights which such person has by virtue of such entitlement or possession, provided that any right to transfer the shares that are specified in it by delivery of the instrument shall cease 21 days before the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (7)(a)."". Amendment No. 207 is necessary as a consequence of a Committee Stage amendment agreed with regard to section 67. The Committee Stage amendment concerned a general prohibition of bearer instruments.

The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the constitution of a company limited by guarantee, which must take the form of a memorandum and articles of association, must state the number of the members with which the company proposes to be registered. This obligation is notwithstanding the provision that allows for a simple statement in the constitution to the effect that the provisions of this Bill are adopted by the company. Should a company extend the number of its members beyond its registered number, the company must notify the registrar within 15 days of the increase. Failure to do so is a category 4 offence.

These amendments allow for a procedure for admission to membership to be determined by the company constitution. This section introduces new law which has been modelled on the Model Regulation 3 in Table C of Schedule 1 of the 1963 Companies Act. The proposed amendment provides for the first time that the constitution of the company must state the number of members with which the company proposes to be registered, that the registrar be notified of any increase to this number and that the constitution may limit the number of members in the constitution and regulates voting, that is, one vote per member in the absence of constitutional provision to the contrary.

18604	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	 There is not a Minister or Deputy in this House who is not pro-business, be that business small, independent, a sole trader or a transnational corporation. The vast majority of businesses, whether multinational corporations or sole traders, operate legitimately and with probity in relation to their taxation, employment, health and safety and any other corporates of law one cares to mention. Amendment No. 242 is made up of four subsections. Subsection (1) states that an unlimited company shall disclose by the filing of a notification with the Companies Registration Office a list of all members which are limited companies, and their respective number of allocated shares. The information sought by the amendment is already available on request. Under 217(9)(c) all companies are obliged to allow any person to inspect their members' register on the payment of a fee which must be €10 or less. Section 217(12)(c) obliges companies to send copies of the members' register to any person who requests it, again for a fee of €10 or less. This register contains the names and addresses of members and the number of shares held by each member. This also applies to unlimited companies. In relation to subsections (3) and (4) of the amendment, it would be costly to set up a public register of the type set out, in particular in light of the fact that the information is already available by other means. Currently, there is no requirement to report this information to the CRO. In this regard, the Deputy referred to the possibility of the introduction of legislation. The Deputy is free to introduce legislation to this House. Therefore, there would be costs associated with this for the CRO and the affected companies. The ongoing cost to the CRO and affected companies of making and processing thousands of notifications would be colossal. The costs involved in delays to transfer of ownership in shares would be unacceptably and could interfere with the constitutional rights to private property. That is something we all adhere to also. I am not sure if the Deputy is suggesting that we should remove unlimited companies from Irish law altogether. Limited companies serve many legitimate business purposes and are a feature of company law across the European Union. Just as guarantee companies and public limited companies are important for certain types of business, unlimited companies also serve an important purpose. Removing them would be disproportionate and would, I would argue, put Ireland at a competitive disadvantage. If the Deputy would like to remove the reporting exemption from unlimited companies, other countries across the EU allow unlimited companies to dispense with reporting requirements. This is because reporting requirements are imposed as a quid pro quo of limited. Where there is no limited liability there is no reason to require financial reporting.
18605	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	 It is very easy to state that small businesses have received less favourable treatment than their bigger counterparts.
18606	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	 I will speak to the amendment. We could become involved in an argument with regard to the supports available to small and large businesses. However, as stated in reply to a previous amendment, between 250 and 300 individuals who own small businesses of various sizes attended an event in Cork yesterday in order to learn about the business supports provided by over 27 agencies of the State. Factually, the Deputy's statement is just not correct. In the context of the amendment, the law on unlimited companies is governed by EU directives and any proposed changes to Irish law would produce few, if any, benefits for the creditors of such companies. However, such changes would give rise to a substantial cost to this country in terms of its international commercial competitiveness. Ireland is a small island nation and the foreign direct investment sector here is responsible for employing many thousands of people either directly or indirectly, in the context of sub-supply or in the provision of services. The fact that foreign direct investment companies operate here gives rise to downstream benefits, in terms of supply, for many of the small businesses we are discussing. I accept the Deputy's concern with regard to the ownership of unlimited companies. This issue will be dealt with in the coming months in the context of the accounting directive, which is due for transposition in 2015. The debate relating to said directive is the most suitable avenue for considering the issues raised by the Deputy. The primary aim of the Bill before the House is to consolidate and tidy up the existing law. It is also designed to provide an accessible, user-friendly framework for businesses operating within our shores. I reiterate that EU law does not require reporting on the part of unlimited companies. That is the position in law at present.

18628	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	471	 I move amendment No. 264: In page 993, to delete line 20. The purpose of this amendment is to remove an incorrect reference in section 226, which governs an obligation of a director to prepare a directors' compliance statement from the investment company's tables. Section 226, with a slight modification by section 1002, applies to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, as per the 2011 regulations on EU collective investments in transferable securities.
18629	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	472	 I move amendment No. 265: In page 999, lines 20 and 21, to delete “a company to which section 1401 applies” and substitute “a migrating company as defined in section 1400”. The purpose of this amendment is to correct an incorrect cross-reference in subsection (9). The correct reference is to section 1400. A migrating company is defined as a body corporate which is established and registered under the laws of a relevant jurisdiction - the place outside the State where the company is established and registered at the time of application under section 1402 - and which is a collective investment undertaking.
18630	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	474	 I move amendment No. 266: In page 1002, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following: “(6) Regulations made under section 3(3) of the Act of 1990 prescribing, for the purposes of the definition of ‘alternative body of accounting standards’ in section 260(4A) of the Act of 1990, bodies having authority to lay down standards of the kind referred to in that definition, and which regulations are in force immediately before the commencement of this section, shall continue in force as if they were regulations made under section 12 for the purposes of subsection (4) and may be amended or revoked accordingly.”. The purpose of this amendment is to correct the unintended exemption provided to investment companies from the filing of financial statements. The new wording will provide for the filing of financial statements without the need to file annual returns. The intention here is to protect the anonymity of investors in investment companies as their names would have to appear as those of shareholders on annual returns.
18631	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	476	 An amendment has not been tabled on this issue.
18632	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	478	 Without being pedantic, I am not sure which section would be relevant to the matter to which the Deputy refers.
18633	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	480	" The review is ongoing. In recognition of the fact that consultation took place on the matter, I wish to read some information into the record of the House. The accountancy profession is, in general, adaptable and agile and is able to respond to new market opportunities and directions. This is, to a great extent, because it is not tied down by layers of regulation. There are detailed statutory provisions relating to auditing and, to a lesser extent, insolvency practice. The Competition Authority holds the view that this is the way things should stay. New regulations should only be introduced where there is clear evidence of market failure or very damaging consumer harm. That has not been established as the position here. When the matter was reviewed by the Department at the time of drafting, the view was taken that there was no case for introducing a system of regulation for the profession generally. On the contrary, it was felt that introducing such a system would put at risk the flexibility of the profession and its ability to respond to client needs, be it in traditional areas such as tax advice or management accounts or in emerging fields such as succession planning. New layers of regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation. Having examined the issue from the standpoint of the principles of better regulation, the Competition Authority concluded that there was no public interest case requiring legal protection of the term ""accountant"". In response to the concerns of the industry, however, the Minister has agreed to consult fully on the matter. I am informed that the review will happen this year but we do not have a definitive timeline in respect of it. However, I am not sure whether it was agreed that the review would be completed in advance of the conclusion of the deliberations on this legislation. Perhaps Deputy Calleary has a different view to offer in that regard."
18634	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	482	 The Bill has by and large been dealt with up to now on the basis of a consensual approach and I am mindful of the need to conclude our deliberations on it. I take the point the Deputy is making with regard to tabling an amendment in the Seanad. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, committed in good faith to carry out and conclude a review by the end of the year. All parties involved will be consulted. I hope we can expedite the review and that any matters relating to it will not delay the implementation of the legislation.
18635	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	484	 I move amendment No. 267: In page 1014, to delete lines 29 and 30 and substitute the following: “1408. (1) In addition to their application to Part 11, sections 1411 to 1420 shall apply to insolvency proceedings dealt with in Part 10.”. The purpose of these amendments is to make reference to Statutory Instrument No. 333/2002 - European Communities (Corporate Insolvency) Regulations 2002. This reference is necessary in order to ensure the statutory instrument's re-enactment.
18636	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	485	 I move amendment No. 268: In page 1015, to delete lines 9 to 14 and substitute the following: “1410. The purpose of sections 1411 to 1420 is to re-enact the European Communities (Corporate Insolvency) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 333 of 2002), apart from their provisions in so far as they relate to insolvency proceedings.”.

18641	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	" I move amendment No. 273: In page 1027, lines 13 to 15 to delete all words from and including “debentures;” in line 13 down to and including “shares.” in line 15 and substitute the following: “debentures; and (c) costs of research.”. The purpose of this amendment is to delete an incorrect reference to ""own shares or treasury shares"" from the balance sheet. This is because they shall be treated as assets in the balance sheet of a company in accordance with the application of accounting standards. The proposed amendment purports to provide greater consistency with the amendment proposed in section 321."
18642	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	" I move amendment No. 274: In page 1029, to delete lines 22 and 23 and substitute the following: “6. Prepayments and accrued income”. The purpose of this amendment is to separate the headings ""Prepayments"" and ""accrued income"" in format 2 and to provide consistency between formats 1 and 2."
18643	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	 I move amendment No. 275: In page 1071, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following: “(3) As provided for in section 1392(6), the Companies Act 1990 (Prescribed Alternative Accounting Standards Bodies) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 382 of 2005) and any regulations amending those regulations shall continue in force and may be amended or revoked under section 12 accordingly.”.
18644	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	494	 I move amendment No. 276: In page 1074, line 29, to delete “and”. The purpose of these amendments is to address the issue whereby a company is struck off and dissolved prior to the enactment of the Bill. The amendments clarify the status of such a company should it be restored to the register. They also make provision for section 30 of the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011. This is the case because there is a possibility that an existing private company limited by shares will have been struck off in recent times and will only come to be restored to the register after the end of the transition period.
18645	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	 I move amendment No. 277: In page 1074, line 32 to delete “Part 17.” and substitute the following: “Part 17; and (c) the references in section 30 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 to section 311 or 311A of the Act of 1963 or section 12 or 12B of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982, or to a particular provision of any such section, shall be read as references to Chapter 1 or, as appropriate, Chapter 2 of Part 12 or, as the case may be, the corresponding provision of either such Chapter.”.
18646	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	 I move amendment No. 278: In page 1074, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following: “Provisions as to status of companies restored to register, having been struck off under former enactments 12. (1) Without prejudice to any specific provision in this Act in that behalf and the subsequent provisions of this paragraph, the provisions of this Act that shall apply to a company— (a) struck off the register under any former enactment relating to companies (within the meaning of section 5); and (b) subsequently restored to the register, whether under— (i) the former enactment referred to in section 745(3); (ii) Chapter 2 of Part 12; or (iii) section 30 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, shall be those applicable to the type of company that corresponds to the type of company to which the company belonged before it was so struck off. (2) Without prejudice to subparagraphs (3) and (4), where any of this Act’s provisions, as applicable to a particular type of company, operates differently by reference (however the matter is expressed) to the length of time that has elapsed after the provision’s commencement, then the reference in subparagraph (1) to the provisions of this Act that are applicable to a type of company shall, in the case of that particular provision, be read as a reference to that provision as it is applicable to a company of the type concerned at the time of the particular company’s restoration to the register (and then at a future date, as the case may be, as it is so applicable at that future date). (3) If the company’s type, before being so struck off, was that of a private company limited by shares and the date on which the company is restored to the register under Chapter 2 of Part 12 or section 30 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is subsequent to the expiry of the transition period (within the meaning of Chapter 6 of Part 2), then, subject, in the case of a restoration under section 739 or 742, to any direction or order of the court under section 743, section 62(1)(a) and (b) shall apply in relation to the company notwithstanding that the company was not an existing private company within the meaning of that Chapter 6 and, accordingly, the company shall, on the date of its restoration to the register, be deemed to be a private company limited by shares to which Parts 1 to 15 apply and the other provisions of section 62 shall apply to it with any necessary modifications. (4) Subparagraph (3) shall similarly apply (where the company’s type, before being so struck off, was that of a private company limited by shares) if, by virtue of subsection (3) of section 745, the former enactment referred to in that subsection applies to the application for the company’s restoration but with the modification that the reference in that subparagraph to a particular provision under which the application for restoration is made, or to a particular provision under which a direction or order of the court is made, shall be read as a reference to the corresponding provision of the former enactment concerned. (5) If in any respect any difficulty arises during the period of 20 years after the commencement of Chapter 2 of Part 12 in bringing into operation that Chapter as it relates to a case falling within any of subparagraphs (1) to (4), the Minister by regulations do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing that Chapter into operation as it relates to such a case. (6) The Minister’s power to make regulations under subparagraph (5) extends to removing difficulties in cases in which a private company limited by shares was— (a) struck off the register under any former enactment relating to companies (within the meaning of section 5); and (b) restored to the register under— (i) the former enactment referred to in section 745(3); (ii) Chapter 2 of Part 12; or (iii) section 30 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, and, before the date it is so restored, there has elapsed a length of time that, in the Minister’s opinion, represents a substantial portion (or greater) of the transition period (within the meaning of Chapter 6 of Part 2).”.
18647	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	" I move amendment No. 279: In page 1082, line 8, to delete “LIMITED” and substitute “COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE”. The purpose of this amendment is to correct a mistake. The example of the name of the company in the Schedule refers to ""company limited by guarantee"". In accordance with section 1176, the name of company limited by guarantee shall end with ""company limited by guarantee"". That is it."

18650	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	 I move amendment No. 282: In page 1091, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: “ Remedy in case of oppression Section 213 ”. The purpose is to include section 213 and the list of provisions to be applied to unregistered companies in Schedule 14. Section 213 provides a remedy to any member of the company who complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive to the member himself or herself or to any other member. The remedy is available under existing law and it is not intended to alter that law.
18651	SeanSherlock	Labour	15092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	 This has been a gargantuan task thus far. I wish to extend my gratitude and that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to everyone who has been involved in the process. It has been a collaborative effort. I thank the Members opposite for their role in bringing the legislation to this point. I thank the people to my right, who, to be fair to them, have done Trojan work in putting all of the Schedules together. It has been a mammoth task. Several issues were raised by Deputy Calleary, in particular the accountancy issue. That is something we are trying to grapple with in good faith. I appeal for it to be seen in this light in terms of how the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will deal with the review. I hope we can continue in the same vein in terms of expediting this legislation as quickly as possible. I do not mean to be verbose but it is a landmark legislative project and has involved many years of detailed and comprehensive work by the officials in my Department, the Company Law Review Group and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. We extend our gratitude to everyone involved.

18795	SeanSherlock	Labour	15099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	 The latest PISA report from the OECD's programme for international student assessment, PISA, shows that 15-year-old students in Ireland performed at the average level of participating countries on computer-based assessment of problem solving. Ireland ranked 17th of the 28 OECD countries that took part in the study, and 22nd out of all 44 participating countries. Countries like the United States, Norway, Denmark and Sweden performed similarly to Ireland, while Canada, Australia, Finland and the United Kingdom performed significantly better than Ireland. The top six performing countries are in Asia, with Singapore ranked first. The performance of Irish students on problem solving in this PISA study is good but there is considerable room for improvement. Project Maths and the emphasis on skills development in the new junior cycle student awards, JCSA, offer students and teachers new ways of thinking and learning that should improve our 15-year-olds' problem-solving capabilities.
18796	SeanSherlock	Labour	15099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	 As has been articulated in other answers by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, we are moving away from a rote learning framework to one which is inquiry-based and which puts the student at the centre of problem solving. Therefore a paradigm shift is going on. I cannot give the Deputy an answer regarding the cost of the digital strategy but I will revert to him with that information. There will be significant improvements in ICT infrastructure with the roll-out of broadband being available to all second-level schools in the autumn. The priorities and challenges of the digital strategy are currently being examined as part of an ongoing consultative process. There is a school of thought that says we may have to look outside the Department concerning the digital strategy and maybe incorporate more stakeholders, including students themselves, in meeting head-on the challenges of PISA and learn from them. As regards the methodologies involved, there is a marked difference between paper-based and computer-based problem solving. We have done extremely well vis-à-vis PISA on paper-based problems. However, there is clearly a deficit in the presentation of scenarios to students for the purposes of PISA marking.
18797	SeanSherlock	Labour	15099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	 One needs broadband provision in the first instance in order to give effect to a digital strategy. That strategy is not yet under way and work remains to be done both internally and externally. The key purpose of this is to ensure that students have a proper understanding of the dynamic involved. People in Ireland are digital natives and instinctively interface with the technology both in schools and elsewhere. However, when certain scenarios were presented to them it showed a deficit, so we need to discover why and tackle it. That is not merely a matter of giving more iPads or tablets to schools, it is a question of how the learning process can be enhanced as a result of interaction with technology. That is part of the digital strategy which needs to be further interrogated. I want to give the Deputy a proper answer. It is not just about throwing money at the problem, it is also about properly interpreting the PISA dynamic and comparing the experiences of other countries. We can take Finland as an exemplar and see how it is done there. We may adopt some of those models into an Irish system. We are getting there but we need to get the ICT roll-out completed in the first instance.
18798	SeanSherlock	Labour	15099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	 That is a paternalistic attitude to education.

18805	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	 The question as tabled relates to the wholesale and retail sector. The latest quarterly national household survey published by the CSO on 26 May showed that the number of people employed in the wholesale and retail sector fell by 2,200 in the first quarter of this year. We acknowledge that fall. It is a very diverse sector and it appears the experience is different in different parts. In April, overall, the volumes and value of retail sales were up by 6.8% and 4.4% on the same period last year. Growth was concentrated in the motor, furniture, clothing, hardware and electrical sectors. By contrast, declines were recorded in the volume of activity in groceries, books and newspapers, and pharmacies. Structural changes, such as trading online, are occurring in the sector and are undoubtedly playing a role. On the other hand, an increase in the KBC-ESRI consumer sentiment index for April, which put Irish consumer sentiment at its strongest level since January 2007, is encouraging. However, the key challenge is to translate these improvements into jobs in the retail sector. This year’s Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures to support the retail sector. These measures include the establishment of a retail consultation forum to provide a platform for a structured engagement between the retail sector and relevant Departments and Government agencies. Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by the Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector. The first meeting of the forum will take place on 9 June. The Action Plan for Jobs also includes measures to address issues that impact on cost competitiveness in the sector, the introduction of a number of structural measures to support the retail sector, and the continuation of the online trading initiative and the integrated licensing application system for the retail sector.
18806	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	 We must acknowledge that Irish shoppers spent €3.8 billion in online trading in 2012. Some 75% of the revenue goes outside the State. While I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy, we must tackle this through Deputy Tóibín's committee, which will do some work on town centre planning. If we are talking about retailers, which he mentioned, it is a question of how town centres are structured and how we encourage greater trading. I am sure the work of the Deputy's committee will feed into the retail consultation forum. It is important to state that the retail consultation forum comprises retail Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence Ireland, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and individual retail practitioners. Through that consultation process, we will address issues like town centre shopping, e-commerce, driving more business online from Irish retailers, and the cost to business of retail. There are specific issues in the grocery sector that require to be addressed. We must look at budget 2015 to see if there is any way of enhancing demand through the process. We must also look at the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, the home renovation incentive scheme and the impact of the 9% VAT rate.
18807	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	 The question tabled by the Deputy concerned the wholesale and retail sectors and I am confident that, through a process of consultation involving all the stakeholders, thorough engagement and giving effect to many initiatives that arise from the retail consultation forum, we can work towards increasing the number of people employed in the retail sector. We wholeheartedly acknowledge that, year-on-year between 2013 and 2014, there has been a drop of 5,900 in the number of people employed in the sectors. We must do something to address that decline and the decline of our towns through the doughnut effect. The Deputy referred to the retailers he is meeting and the level of confidence. Through engaging with those retailers and their representative organisations, we can arrest the decline. I am confident that, once the process starts on 9 June, we will take action.
18808	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	 In the three years before the Government came into office, more than 300,000 jobs had been lost across the economy. The construction, retail and tourism sectors were particularly badly hit and collectively accounted for over two thirds of the job losses. Almost 150,000 jobs were lost in the construction sector alone between the beginning of 2008 and the beginning of 2011. In 2012, the Government introduced the Action Plan for Jobs as the main policy instrument to tackle the employment crisis and to assist job creation. Now in its third annual iteration, the action plan has set about transforming the operating environment for businesses by seeking to identify and remove barriers to competitiveness and by placing employment on the agenda of every Department. The latest employment figures published by the Central Statistics Office show there was an increase of 42,700 people in employment in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the first quarter of 2013. There was an increase of 63,200 in the numbers in employment in the last two years. These figures are net of reductions in public sector numbers. More than 67% of the jobs created since 2012 have been full time. In the last six months, almost all the jobs created in the economy were full time. The sectors that have consistently performed well are agriculture, food and fishing, accommodation and food services, tourism and professional, scientific and technical activities. These sectors have been the focus for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs. In 2013, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client companies had record years for employment creation, generating a total of 12,500 net new jobs in export-focused activities. These patterns suggest the jobs being created are adding value to the economy and have every potential to be sustainable. However, we must continue to focus on sectors that did not experience a jobs recovery over the past two years. The wholesale and retail sector, which we discussed earlier, continues to suffer job losses, while the pattern is similar in the construction sector. There are moves to intervene in both sectors.
18809	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	 There is a specific policy instrument for the construction sector. Construction 2020 sets out a series of policy interventions in consultation with sectoral representatives regarding how the housing shortage can be addressed and how the sector, which took a major hit, particularly in the three years prior to 2011, can be stimulated.
18810	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	 Yes. A specific initiative is under way, particularly aimed at the Dublin region, under the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I can engage further with the Deputy on this.
18811	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	 I understand from EI that it has been actively promoting the site concerned to a number of interested parties. I am not in a position to disclose the details of those interactions for commercially sensitive reasons. However, task forces have been used in the past as part of a response to a sudden loss of a large number of industrial jobs. More recently, other initiatives are increasingly used as an alternative to task forces. In this regard, the establishment of LEOs, recently announced by Government, means that all categories of business, including sole traders, micro businesses and SMEs have access to Government supports and advice. The LEO is the first-stop shop for anyone seeking information and support on starting or enhancing a business. The active promotion of the site is taking place. EI is actively engaged in seeking to ensure the jobs that were lost are replaced.
18812	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	 I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy in regard to the effect of the loss of a company like this to a town like Fethard. In south Tipperary, where Enterprise Ireland is the lead agency in efforts to ensure we replace and create jobs, there are 76 client companies employing more than 2,000 people in full-time jobs. These are the figures for 2013. In excess of €9 million worth of grants has been paid to client companies since 2011. I assure the Deputy that Enterprise Ireland is working actively as the representative State agency in seeking to ensure we can replace the jobs that have been lost. It is actively promoting the site to a number of interested parties as we speak.
18813	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	 As far as I am aware, there is no formal task force working on this, such as the task force for the south east where all the agencies are working together. I assure the Deputy, however, that the local agencies are working together. Enterprise Ireland is the pre-eminent State agency and it is working proactively on this. It is promoting the site to a number of interested parties. I ask the Deputy to allow that process to take shape. I am sure he will acknowledge that Enterprise Ireland is working with interested parties to seek to replace the jobs that have been lost.
18814	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	 The Deputy should use Private Members' time to do so.
18815	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	 I doubt Sinn Féin will use Private Members' time.
18816	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	 I thank the Deputy for tabling the question. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, developing a better environment for entrepreneurship is a key disruptive reform. The work of the Entrepreneurship Forum has been a valuable input to identify areas for fruitful initiative. The Department is developing a national policy statement on entrepreneurship. As part of this process, the forum’s recommendations are being evaluated with input from Departments and agencies. Already, a significant number of initiatives have been taken which respond to the forum’s evaluation. These include the launch of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the initiation of a competition to find and to invest in the best young entrepreneurs at local and national level, the creation of a new ICT skills strategy 2014-18, the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Ireland and its online database of innovative ideas, as well as turning those ideas that come from intellectual property through the universities and institutes of technology into new companies. In addition, a review of mentoring is being prepared by Forfás and a review of tax supports is under way for entrepreneurs. The initiatives also include an assessment of how the agencies in the Department can deliver targeted improvements in the environment for business, particularly for start-ups, and the preparation of a strategy statement 2014-16 by Enterprise Ireland with new ambitions for high-potential start-ups. There is a strong belief that the start-ups area offers huge opportunity for enhanced performance and jobs growth by the Irish enterprise sector and the Government is determined to facilitate this through a national policy statement on entrepreneurship.
18817	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	 Many of the recommendations made actually cut across measures that are being implemented anyway. It is unfair to suggest that the Government is not engaging proactively with the recommendations. It acknowledges wholeheartedly the role played by the chairman and individual members in bringing forward these recommendations. I can tell the Deputy that, internally, there is no sense of lethargy about engaging properly. However, he must acknowledge that if one is to take all the recommendations, of which there are at least 69, one must have some sort of process to ensure the State agencies can respond and that there is an interdepartmental response. As I outlined already in my initial reply, the Government has launched the local enterprise offices, which will cut across a lot of the recommendations made. Similarly, the ICT skills strategy will cut across a lot of the recommendations that were made, as will the review by Forfás on mentoring. Consequently, there is no sense that the Department is not engaging with the recommendations. I assure the Deputy and those people who have been in contact with the Deputy and who may have expressed concerns that the Government is absolutely and utterly intent on ensuring that the national policy statement will reflect the views put forward and the recommendations proposed.
18818	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	 I did not answer the question on the number of people who have been assigned. A number of people have been appointed through Enterprise Ireland in Asia, comprising ten new people across Asia. I can get a specific figure for the Deputy in respect of China. To my mind, the interdepartmental approach works quite rapidly at present. If one examines again the recommendations made in the Entrepreneurship Forum report, it is evident that the Government is moving rapidly and actually was ahead of some of the recommendations in respect of outcomes, particularly, for example, with regard to the higher level sector where there is a strong move towards ensuring that research works in a way that turns those good ideas into good jobs. The Government has created Knowledge Transfer Ireland and has ensured there are more post-doctoral and PhD programmes. For instance, there are specific arrangements pertaining to the Irish Research Council on having more enterprise-facing PhD programmes. That is one recommendation that already is under way. The point must be made that while the Government acknowledges the recommendations and is working towards meeting them, it will reflect these outcomes through the national policy statement.
18819	SeanSherlock	Labour	15156.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	 I thank the Deputies again for raising this important issue. The object of the interdepartmental exercise is to seek and uncover the truth, which is not something that can be done overnight. The deadlines we have imposed will ensure there is no delay in dealing with this issue. Deputies Creighton and Keaveney asked about my contact with the Garda Síochána. I have not initiated any such contact on this matter. The Garda Síochána is an independent State policing and investigative organisation. I do not direct it on matters of crime or seek to initiate criminal investigations. The force will be expected to exercise judgment with regard to alleged criminal activity in this case, in the same way as it does in respect of any criminal investigation. It is important that each Department with any involvement in the issues surrounding this case is not only consulted, but activated to take appropriate action. That is the basis of the interdepartmental approach we are taking. This obviously will include the Department of Justice and Equality, my own Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health. There may also be a role for the Department of Social Protection, with particular reference to the records to which Deputy Clare Daly referred, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In fact, most Departments will have an involvement in this issue. I will be keeping Government informed as to the progress of the interdepartmental group's work. Its report will be presented to Cabinet by the end of this month, after which we will decide, at the earliest opportunity, on the extent and scope of further investigation and inquiry. The House will have an opportunity to debate the issues at that stage. I assure Deputy Clare Daly that the issues she raised, including the document she mentioned, will be examined by the interdepartmental group and form part of the current scoping exercise. I reiterate that I am not ruling anything out in terms of Government action on this issue. I ask the Deputies to allow time and space for the various interests in the various Departments to do the work that needs to be done. They have already had their first meeting and a timeframe is in place. I will keep the House informed as matters progress in the coming weeks.

18835	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	 The report on the value for money review of small primary schools will be published as soon as my Government colleagues and I have finalised our consideration of it and its recommendations. I am not at this time in a position to give a precise publication date. The report contains much detailed technical data concerning small schools in the primary sector and also a suite of recommendations and options. The Government needs time to properly consider the report and its recommendations.
18836	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	 It is important in giving effect to proper public policy and proper educational policy that due consideration and time is given to all the inputs involved in the making of such a report. One must examine issues such as the diversity of provision in an area, the ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, distances pupils must travel and the provision and costs of school transport, the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type and the costs of running small primary schools. It is not something one would rush into given the important nature of educational provision. The Government seeks to ensure proper and due diligence is done on public policy and educational policy.
18837	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	 It is the Government's intention to publish the report and due consideration is being given to its contents.
18838	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	 Provisional net overall expenditure to the end of June 2014 by the Department is more or less on target. Expenditure of almost €3.88 billion is running just €24 million, or 0.6%, behind profile, with €7 million on current expenditure and €17 million on capital. The Department continues to closely monitor the financial position with a view to ensuring that expenditure remains within the allocation for the year. This Government has sought to protect education spending and maintain front-line education services as far as possible. However, levels of educational expenditure cannot be determined in a manner that ignores the economic reality. Consequently, there is no scope to reverse the decision taken in budget 2012 to reduce the level of capitation payable. Within the Department's overall multi-annual capital allocation, over €28 million was issued to primary schools last November for the school year 2013-14 under the minor works grant scheme, while more than €70 million in total has been allocated to the 2014 summer works scheme to allow more than 770 schools nationwide to undertake improvement works. Funding for future minor works and summer works schemes is subject to funding.
18839	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	 I agree with some of the sentiment of the Deputy. In a perfect world, we would have the perfect pot of money to allow us to do everything we could within the education sphere to ensure the amount of voluntary contributions made by parents through charitable donations and fundraising was lessened considerably. There is a macroeconomic picture, however, and we must reduce the deficit to 3% by a certain year. Fianna Fáil subscribes to that philosophy and that means the education silo has a finite pot of money. To govern is to choose, and we must make choices about where to allocate funding. With regard to the comment about electioneering, Deputy McConalogue's party is a dab hand at making announcements prior to elections. Let us take the cynicism out of it and say that we have tried to ensure we put money into schools through the minor works scheme and the summer works scheme where it is necessary. Some schools missed out because of the prioritisation process, but they are not being cut out of the pot. Hopefully, these schools will go in the pot for next year, and it is the intention, if we are €500 million ahead of profile in terms of overall taxation receipts, that it will reflect positively on the education budget. This will allow us to fund projects such as those outlined in the question.
18840	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	 In March 2011, the macroeconomic picture in this country was abysmal and we were a programme country. However, we have been able to maintain the capital budget and we have a five-year programme where we are replacing prefabs and building new schools. Therefore, in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have been able to build out and replace the prefabs that have been in existence since the height of the boom. Therefore, there is no doubting the Government's commitment to trying to ensure funding is put in place for necessary work. We have not yet started the proper discussions around budget 2015. Therefore, it would be premature to give an absolute commitment at this stage. However, if we had committed funding for this year, 2014, and if the economic profile is getting better, one would be hopeful. That is all one can say. If the Deputy was standing where I am standing, this is what he would be saying. We would hope to be in a position to try to ensure that schools funding for the necessary repairs and minor works will be provided, but we cannot say that for certain until we have got through the negotiations on budget 2015.
18841	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	 The position is that Ireland received funding for a European globalisation adjustment fund, EGF, programme to support redundant workers from SR Technics. This consisted of a personalised package of guidance, training, educational and enterprise supports which were delivered to the eligible workers concerned during an implementation period from March 2009 to October 2011. Measures included tuition costs of the ALBA degree in All Hallows which, normally being a part-time programme, was delivered on a tailored full-time basis to accommodate the specific requirements of these workers given the finite timeframe for EGF co-funded support. When this funding ceased, the Department provided a grant as a once-off measure to this cohort of students to complete their studies. The Department allocates funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to approved higher education institutes and the internal disbursement is a matter for the governing bodies. The provision of courses is a matter for individual institutions as autonomous bodies.
18842	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	 It is important to state that All Hallows is a private college and is not in receipt of core grant funding. However, the Department provides grants in lieu of tuition fee funding to the college in respect of three approved undergraduate courses. This funding amounted to over €430,000 for the 2013-2014 academic year in respect of the 119 eligible students who attended courses for the full year. The ALBA programme referred to by the Deputy is a part-time course and is, therefore, not an approved course for free fees funding. A decision was made to provide specific funding - initially under the EGF and subsequently by means of the grant scheme - to certain students, namely, former employees of SR Technics who undertook the course on a full-time basis. When the EGF funding was withdrawn, the Department agreed to support the full-time qualifying students to complete their studies. These were ex-SR Technics employees who were undertaking the ALBA degree on a full-time basis. As already stated, the institutions are autonomous bodies in their own right. I hope this answers the Deputy's question.
18843	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	 I am not unsympathetic to the case the Deputy is making, particularly in view of the impact the course has had on those individuals who, as he states, were out of formal education for such a long period. I contend that it is not necessarily for the Department to intervene. In circumstances in which a course of this nature could be provided by another institution, I would make the argument that it would be a matter for that institution to subsume it into its own programme of courses.
18844	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	 An exception was made. It must be remembered that it was a part-time course and that funding would not normally be provided in such circumstances. The Deputy referred to a particular institution, but there are any number of institutions throughout the State which could, subject to their internal criteria, subsume the course on a full-time basis. I do not know how the Department could intervene in that matter. In fact, I do not believe there is a mechanism to allow it to do so. It was a result of the EGF and the specific circumstances relating to SR Technics that an intervention was made in this instance, and there is no doubting the positive impact of that intervention. If that were the case, one could set a precedent in respect of any number of other courses which could be brought through the Department to be delivered out into specific institutions. However, we must recognise the autonomy of individual institutions.
18845	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	 If I am not mistaken, the Deputy has raised this issue previously.
18846	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	 I hope, therefore, that I am not repeating the same reply to the Deputy. To date, the Department has not received any formal submission from parents in north Kildare on the provision of a gaelcholáiste in the north-eastern Kildare region. There is a five year construction plan which is well established. The establishment of any new school is, therefore, considered in the context of the overall need for additional school places to meet future demographic demands. The Deputy has probably heard this before. I acknowledge that there is one post-primary school in Maynooth, Maynooth post-primary school. A new post-primary school, Maynooth community college, will be added to the provision this September. It will have an all-Irish aonad, which is the nub of the issue. I will sit down with the Deputy who may wish to address that point.
18847	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	 As I understand it, a total of 80 places are being made available through the aonad. If the Deputy is suggesting the demand from the community for a gaelcholáiste is such that the aonad is not a sufficient response, we will have to find a way of facilitating a further conversation based on an interrogation of the survey. The reply furnished to me suggests that included in the first year enrolment at the new school will be an allocation of 31 students for the all-Irish aonad. While there is no waiting list for the aonad, an additional 85 first year places can be filled in Maynooth community college. These places can be filled either in the aonad, on the English language side of the school or between the two facilities, depending on demand. Obviously, there is a gap between what the Department and the community are saying and, somehow, we are going to have to work to bridge it. I will speak with the Deputy after Question Time.
18848	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	 I am open to correction, but it is my understanding the Department has confirmed that, if is demonstrated that there is sufficient demand for education through the medium of Irish in the aonad over a four year cycle, the establishment of an independent gaelcoláiste can be considered.
18849	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	 The Deputy and I will discuss the matter.
18850	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	 I am aware of the concerns of all the patrons of smaller rural schools, including those of a Protestant ethos. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities presents as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where the number enrolling in the school is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. Nevertheless, resources have to be distributed to schools in a transparent and equitable manner. In this regard, pupil numbers are the fairest basis on which to allocate resources to a school, irrespective of its type. Eight small schools of a Protestant ethos were successful in their staffing appeals for September 2014.
18851	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	 On the Deputy's question on dialogue, there is continuing dialogue on ensuring pluralism within the education system. Let me refer to a specific example. With the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, Dr. Paul Colton, and Mr. Owens of Cork Education and Training Board, we have in Mallow, where a small Church of Ireland school closed, fashioned a new model that will create a precedent for an education and training board to join a Church of Ireland school in creating a brand new school. What we are talking about is ensuring the recognition of the faith and the right of those with that faith to educate their community accordingly. We must try to ensure there is a model, or models, to allow this to continue. It is worth noting that there are 194 primary schools with a Protestant or Presbyterian ethos out of a total of 3,146. Based on the enrolment figures for September 2013, nine of those have one teacher, 73 have two teachers and 36 have three or more. Therefore, there is recognition of the community. There is no question about that. It is a matter of how we apply lateral thinking in coming up with solutions when numbers are decreasing in individual schools to such an extent that we need to consider new models.
18852	SeanSherlock	Labour	15189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	" There is no doubt about that. There is satisfactory dialogue on ensuring the future of these schools and on recognising the challenges they face regarding pluralism in education. The answer to the Deputy's question is ""Yes""."

18872	SeanSherlock	Labour	15190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	 I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to pilot this Bill through both the Seanad and the Dáil. I thank the Members of this House and the Seanad for their comments and what was a fruitful debate on the Bill during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill is not designed to solve all the issues affecting the co-operative sector but to address a number of particular issues that have been identified by the sector as being areas of most pressing concern. I thank the co-operative sector, particularly the umbrella bodies - the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, the National Association of Building Co-operatives and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes - as well as the Centre for Co-operative Studies, University College Cork. I also thank the other groups and individual contributors for their very positive engagement with the consultation process prior to the drafting of the Bill. I am confident that the co-operative sector will warmly welcome the reduction in the administrative burden placed on it and the flexibility offered by the revised arrangements for annual returns. I believe that this Bill, coupled with the very significant reduction in fees charged by the Registrar of Friendly Societies - which was introduced in 2012, the UN International Year of Co-operatives - will assist the development of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, as committed to in the programme for Government. I also thank the officials in my Department who put a lot of work into putting the Bill together.

18949	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	 Is Sinn Féin now proposing that the corporation tax rate is too low? Is that the inference of the Deputy's question when he says we have a bargain basement corporation tax rate? I do not accept the Deputy's inference that US foreign investment in the economy is at an undesirable level. The activities of US owned companies represent an important source of exports and employment. They are spread across 500 companies in a wide range of sectors and have strong links with the economy. Exports from foreign owned enterprises are an important and sustainable element of the economy, as they are in other small globalised economies. While IDA Ireland client companies play an important part in the economy, it should be remembered that employment in such companies represents less than 9% of total Irish employment. The majority of employment comes from the activities of Irish owned companies and enterprises and these are the key focus of much of our enterprise policy. Many of the proposals developed in An Action Plan for Jobs have been designed to assist the start-up, scaling and internationalisation of Irish owned enterprises. Measures include the roll-out of the local enterprise office, LEO, network, the establishment of the potential exporters divisions, the increase in staff assisting Irish companies to develop in overseas markets, the increase in the number of trade missions, the creation of new instruments to facilitate access to finance and the development of sectoral strategies in areas such as tourism, software and food. There is solid progress being made. Exports by Enterprise Ireland companies are up by €3.5 billion in the past three years, while employment has grown by 14%, from 146,419 to 166,184 higher than the total employed in IDA Ireland client companies.
18950	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	 If the Deputy thinks the effective corporation tax rate is too low, he should tell us what his party thinks it should be, rather than merely express it as a platitude.
18951	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	 Enterprise Ireland client companies have continued to generate increased jobs growth. They recorded the highest overall rise in employment levels in the past decade, with 5,442 net new jobs, some 3,620 of which were full time, at the end of 2013. Moreover, they provide employment for 175,750 persons, comprising 149,718 full-time and 26,032 part-time workers. We recorded export sales of €17.1 billion in 2013 and have set a target of €17.5 billion for Enterprise Ireland supported companies for 2014. There are 100,000 persons employed in 500 US companies here and we export goods and services worth €26 billion to the US market. Total trade between Ireland and the United States - the question relates to the US market - amounts to approximately €55 billion.
18952	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	 Enterprise Ireland's network of international offices now extends to 30. We opened two new offices during 2013, in Istanbul and Austin, Texas. Some 815 new overseas customers were secured for client companies, 38% of which were in high growth markets. In addition, 111 of Enterprise Ireland's high potential start-up companies secured their first new international reference company in 2013. There were 18 Minister-led overseas trade missions, in which more than 1,000 Enterprise Ireland client companies took part, and a further 67 international events in major target markets. We are making significant progress. There is a strong policy prerogative, since the creation of the LEOs, to support the SME sector at a local level and ensure those companies that have export potential through Enterprise Ireland will be supported. There is a broad range of supports available. I reiterate that there was €65 million in equity and venture capital, a figure of €92 million for technology and scientific infrastructure, €27 million for capability building and €19 million in capital for employment support and capacity expansion. This is taxpayers' money being invested effectively through Enterprise Ireland to support the indigenous sector.
18953	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	 In the past decade the influence of the Internet on the economy has been growing steadily, about which there is no doubt. In 2013 Indecon Consultants estimated that digitalrelated activities contributed 4.4% of GDP to the economy. The consultants predicted that this contribution would increase by 16% year on year. Almost 95,000 jobs are already supported by digital-related activities in the economy. Notwithstanding this trend, CSO data suggest only 23% of small companies in Ireland are engaged in sales through e-commerce. The proportion is considered to be even lower for companies with fewer than ten employees. These companies are potentially losing valuable sales opportunities in both the Irish market and in selling overseas. It is estimated that Irish consumers spend just under €6 billion online annually, of which 60% to 70% goes overseas. Encouraging more indigenous companies to engage in e-commerce is, therefore, a key objective of the Government’s national digital strategy and An Action Plan for Jobs. The 2014 action plan includes a commitment to roll out a trading online voucher scheme to 2,000 micro and small businesses by the end of 2015. The scheme is intended as a catalyst to support businesses to start trading online or improve their current online trading offering, rather than simply having an online presence and there is a qualitative difference. It provides successful applicants with a voucher up to the value of €2,500 to help meet these objectives. The value of the voucher must be matched by the applicant company. The trading online voucher scheme falls within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. However, the vouchers will be administered by the local enterprise offices. Following a piloting of the scheme by the Dublin City Enterprise Office at the start of the year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced the national roll-out of the scheme last week. Applicant businesses will be selected on the basis of their project plan, including their expected growth in jobs and exports as a result of trading online.
18954	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	 There is strong recognition by the Government of the size of the spend and its impact on GDP. The advent of the online trading vouchers through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, is a concrete policy intervention in recognising this trend and providing funding towards supporting businesses. On the eligibility criteria, the vouchers will be available to a maximum figure of €2,500. Approval must be obtained prior to incurring any expense and third party costs only will be considered. All third party supplier invoices must contain proper business details. This is a robust document that greatly encourages businesses that may have had an online presence but which were not trading online. It will be for the LEOs to advertise locally to ensure businesses will come into them.
18955	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	 The important point is that we have recognised the potential value and created a solution through the roll-out of the trading online voucher scheme. In terms of the early results under the pilot scheme, seven out of ten companies stated the voucher application process had already helped them to determine how online trading would fit into their businesses. Some 70% of the companies involved in the pilot scheme in Dublin had received more customer inquiries, while 55% had had more sales. There is a provision within the LEO infrastructure to allow those companies that wish to trade online do so and we are already seeing a positive impact. It is impossible to give the exact figure for how much the State will spend in supporting this activity, but there is a provision available and it has been rolled out across the State in the piloting of the scheme. The demand from small local businesses to participate has been extremely high. It will take us a little time to have data on the numbers of businesses that have come in and how this has had an impact on their businesses.
18956	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	 Is the Deputy speaking from experience there?
18957	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	 During the Irish Presidency in June 2013, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, secured the agreement of all trade ministers in the EU Council, to formally open negotiations with the US on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP. At a time of high unemployment we must grasp every opportunity that adds to the momentum of recovery that Government policies are achieving. In particular, huge potential is offered by TTIP to accelerate economic growth, and expand trade and export opportunities. These give us the potential to create more jobs so that the already falling unemployment rate can be more quickly reduced. Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 100,000 people employed in 500 US companies here and with Irish companies exporting over €1 billion in goods and services to the US every year. If we add in exports from foreign companies located here, over €26 billion in goods and services are sold to the high value US market. This gives a clear indicator of the opportunities we can leverage from fewer barriers to transatlantic trade. The Department recently engaged Copenhagen Economics to examine the economic and other impacts of TTIP and related potential opportunities. Some tentative and preliminary findings suggest that the impact on our economy might be as large as an additional 1.1% increase in GDP. This is higher than the estimated 0.5% GDP gain from TTIP for the EU as a whole. In employment terms, this could lead to an additional 8,000 jobs for Ireland over the agreement’s implementation period. However, considerable further analysis needs to be done by the consultants to clarify what the impact of TTIP will be. In terms of employment, benefits are likely to accrue, particularly to sectors such as life sciences, ICT, food and manufacturing. These include a large number of SMEs. I hope these would gain disproportionately because the type of barriers that TTIP aims to tackle, are more costly for small companies to deal with.
18958	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	 We are looking at this from the point of view of the upsides and are not viewing it from the point of view of the downsides. We will do a proper analysis, but it is being undertaken with a view to an economic win.
18959	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	445	 To be helpful, as the Minister dealing with the first matter has not arrived, I suggest we take the second matter first.
18960	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	 I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter. Both Deputy Stanton and I are playing as a tag team in respect of this issue because it is pertinent to our constituency. The area referred to has been identified by my Department as one of the areas where due to demographic changes it is projected that there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. I think Deputy Stanton first identified the precipice that has been reached in respect of those demographic issues in the first instance. Since that time, we have been working together to get these projects over the line. We have had success particularly in respect of Midleton and the Gaelscoil at Mainistir na Corann. Building projects for five primary schools, one of which involves the amalgamation of two existing schools referred to by Deputy Stanton, are proposed for the Midleton and Carrigtwohill areas to meet demographic growth. Scoil Chlochair Mhuire and Scoil Mhuire Naofa are existing boys' and girls' primary schools currently operating on separate sites in a combination of temporary and permanent accommodation. A project to deliver a new 32-classroom primary school building in Carrigtwohill is planned to facilitate the amalgamation and expansion of these two schools, as Deputy Stanton has outlined. The Department has approved additional temporary accommodation for both of these schools to meet their interim needs for September 2014. In addition to this particular building project, a further four building projects are proposed that involve three primary schools and one post-primary school in order to meet demographic growth in the area. There will be a new 16-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Midleton Educate Together national school, Midleton. The site acquisition is ongoing at present. I have already referred to the new 24-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann. This is going through the rapid planning process as we speak. The Deputy has also referred to the possible need for another primary school because of the demographic challenges. In that regard, a new 16-classroom primary school with patronage to be decided will be built and a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school is due to be established under the patronage of Cork ETB involving the Catholic Bishop of Cloyne. The Department, with the assistance of Cork County Council, has identified and is currently engaged in the site acquisition process for the primary and post-primary school projects in Carrigtwohill referred to by the Deputy. Once sites are acquired, the school projects concerned will be progressed immediately through the architectural planning process. I want to assure the people of this area and Deputy Stanton that I as a Minister of State in that Department am personally overseeing those projects. The Deputy and I have discussed the commercial sensitivities around specific sites. Given that we have had some success so far in respect of Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann, an issue that went on into its second decade, and the fact that the planning process has now started, I am confident we will continue to give this top priority in respect of Carrigtwohill. I can assure the Deputy and the people of that area that we are working on this on a daily basis and we will continue to work, if I dare say it, as a tag team on the Government side of this House to deliver these necessary projects.
18961	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	452	 I understand that the site notice is up for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann. I think that was the project referred to by Deputy Stanton.
18962	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	 The Deputy and I have been through the process of teasing out the site acquisition. I suppose that it is one of the flaws in the system, notwithstanding the fact that there is a memorandum of understanding with the local authority, when one is seeking to acquire privately owned land and there is a market value on the land. There is an inherent challenge there because of the constitutional right to private property and the market value inherent therein. On top of that, if there is a number of sites that have been designated, there are certain commercial sensitivities around that. I am confident that because we have been through the Gaelscoil Midleton process together, the same energy is being applied to the challenge in Carrigtwohill. I am confident that once the site is acquired, we can move rapidly. If I retain my position or indeed regardless of my position, I will continue to advocate with the Deputy on ensuring that we can move rapidly to getting these schools built. I cannot give the Deputy a definitive timeframe at this point but both he and the people in that area should be assured of our commitment to ensuring that we deliver within the five-year planning programme. That is the aim.
18963	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	467	 It is ominous that she sent me here to reply.
18964	SeanSherlock	Labour	15191.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-07-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	 I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. As the Deputy said, we acknowledge the crucial role carers play in society. In 2014 the estimated Department expenditure on various supports for carers will be almost €886 million, comprising approximately €557 million on the carer's allowance, €21.5 million on carer's benefit, €122 million on the respite care grant and €105.1 million on domiciliary care allowance. I welcome the opportunity to highlight one of these key supports for carers provided by the Department, namely, the respite care grant. The grant was introduced in June 1999, at which time the Department of Health also paid a respite care grant to people receiving domiciliary care allowance who were not in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit from the Department of Social Protection. The domiciliary care allowance scheme transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2009 as did responsibility for the related respite care grant. In 2005 the stand-alone respite care grant was introduced for all full-time carers. All respite care grants are now administered by the Department. Although the grant is not subject to a means test, applicants are not eligible for the grant if they are working more than 15 hours per week outside the home, if they are getting a jobseeker's payment or if they are signing on for credits. There is no obligation on carers to use the respite care grant to access respite services. The value of the grant stands at €1,375 and this year it is estimated that the grant will be paid to some 87,000 persons at a cost of €122 million. A person caring for more than one person receives a grant for each person for whom they care. The grant is paid on the first Thursday in June of the relevant year to cover 52 weeks from this date. As it is an advance payment, the type of circumstance to which the Deputy referred is already covered. The grant is not paid on a proportional basis and in order to qualify a person must, in addition to other criteria, be caring for at least six months. The mid-year June payment date allows carers to avail of respite over the summer months, facilitates the administration of the grant and ensures that the grant is targeted at those providing full-time care over a significant period of time. In a review of the grant undertaken by the Department in recent years, carers were asked about their preference regarding payment. The options of splitting the grant into two or three payments through the year were put to people and the vast majority of respondents, 84%, indicated that they would prefer no change to the current arrangements. This view was prevalent irrespective of age group, social welfare status, gender, location, number of care recipients or marital status. In favouring the current annual payment, people expressed the view that a large lump sum would be more likely to be used for a specific purpose, such as a holiday, whereas smaller sums paid more frequently would be more likely to be absorbed in the day-to-day expenses of the household. In general, respondents stated that they were very pleased to receive the grant and that it was very helpful to them in easing the financial stress they had been experiencing. Those who used the grant for a holiday generally felt that the break would not have been possible without the grant. People who use the grant for other purposes, particularly to pay regular household bills, considered that the grant eased their financial worries generally.

18983	SeanSherlock	Labour	15280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	 Ireland is working directly in Sierra Leone and Liberia and internationally on a comprehensive and effective response to the ebola epidemic in west Africa.
18984	SeanSherlock	Labour	15280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	 We must see it in the context of where Ireland sits. Ireland is very much part of the international response which sits within the UN infrastructure where there is a special UN envoy, Mr. Anthony Banbury, who is on the ground in the three countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in particular. I did not participate in the donor conference in London last week because I was in Sierra Leone. The President of Sierra Leone was unable to attend the conference and we met him in Sierra Leone. The issue here is not the monetary response per se. I am confident that, through the UN infrastructure, the political willingness exists given the mandate the United Nations has to deal with this. From a European Union perspective, I tend to agree with the Deputy's point in that there needs to be a more robust political response at an EU level to ensure that, with the €180 million which is committed by the EU, there is a political pressure or diplomatic effort applied in those countries as well as a medical and humanitarian response to ensure those systems-----
18985	SeanSherlock	Labour	15280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	 I request a little latitude, if I may - just 30 seconds.
18986	SeanSherlock	Labour	15280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	 If Deputy Smith is talking about medical evacuations, there needs to be a greater degree of clarity such that when Irish people go out there to help in the effort, there is some degree of assurance that they can have a pathway back to the most appropriate treatment centre. The national response on this was discussed at Cabinet this morning. This will take an interdepartmental group because we need to ensure if there are persons coming back from west Africa who display symptoms that there is a clear pathway from their houses or places of work directly to a fully staffed and equipped hospital - wherever that may be within the country - and that there is a clear protocol. That is something that is being discussed. It is a live issue as we speak. If Sierra Leonean health care workers are not working on the ground, for instance, because they may not have been paid for a number of months, and if they do not have confidence in their own system on the ground, and I can only speak for Sierra Leone, it is difficult to ask an Irish front-line health care worker to work in those circumstances. That is where the UN co-ordinator, Mr. Banbury, is working. He is working with our ambassador and Irish NGOs, such as GOAL, Concern and Plan Ireland so that there is a cross-sectoral approach to dealing with this. I am not saying one takes it out of Sierra Leonean hands, but one manages and internationalises the effort. It is only in the past 72 hours that we are seeing a major ramping up of that effort. I assure the Deputy that this is being discussed in terms of an Irish response on the ground if somebody should contract the virus when on Irish soil.
18987	SeanSherlock	Labour	15280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	 I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate about beef prices. Beef farmers are facing a crisis because of the prices they are getting for their cattle and their stock. I agree with what Deputies McNamara and Martin Ferris had to say about the issues in the beef sector. There is no doubt that the beef market in this State is controlled by a small number of processors who manipulate and control the prices that farmers can achieve for their stock when they take it to the mart. That is the crux of the problem for the beef sector in this country. The average income of beef farmers is between €12,000 and €13,000 per annum. It is not viable for them. They are struggling. Farmers along the west coast, particularly in County Donegal, are depending on this sector. There are just three operators in the processing sector. This is what they do. Their natural tendency is to maximise their profits. They do this by manipulating prices. That is what they set out to do and that is what they do. The problem, unfortunately, is that this activity is not policed in this State. I recognise that live exports have increased. I looked at the Bord Bia figures today. The Minister mentioned that there has been increase of 15%, but I suggest we should set a target of achieving an increase of 30% or 50%. That would provide the competition in the marts that we are all talking about. If the processors have to compete, they will end up paying a living, reasonable price for the stock they buy from farmers. Over the past 15 or 20 years, hundreds of small abattoirs had to close after increased regulations and standards were forced on them. When they were forced out of the market, it took many people who would have been buying cattle at marts out of the marts and out of the cattle-purchasing sector. That is one example of how the processors have managed to get rid of competition. Competition was further diminished when live exports were reduced. The processors have all the control. While I accept the Minister set up the beef forum, I suggest it merely involved politely asking the processors to do something to improve the way they deal with farmers and to increase their prices. It had no teeth. The Minister must have some teeth if he is to enforce the requirement on the processors to act reasonably and responsibly. I do not believe the multiples play a huge part in Ireland in terms of the prices that farmers can get. We export 90% of what we produce through the factories. If the multiples here were paying better prices, it would not trickle down because it would involve no more than 10% of the stock that goes through processors. The big problem is the control the factories exert on the market in this country. We need to think about to where this leads back. I read an article today tracing the genesis of the crisis in the beef sector back to last year's horsemeat scandal. The rationale for the article was that the supermarkets and multiples in England started to put pressure on processors to ensure they stuck rigidly to certain specifications. The processors then used those specifications to push down the prices at the marts. What has happened in the Department in the period since the horsemeat crisis threatened our beef sector? Has there been any follow-up on the horsemeat crisis? Are there any prosecutions outstanding? Is anything happening that will force the processors to act responsibly in the future? That is the kind of pressure we need to put on them if we are to ensure they behave responsibly. We should ask the Competition Authority to examine the operation of this country's beef sector, with a particular focus on processing. If we are to address this issue, we must look seriously at the competition aspect of it. I saw a quote from the Minister today to the effect that the Competition Authority has suggested that the beef sector is very competitive. When I went through the Competition Authority's website, I could not find any reference to the investigation of the beef sector. I did not see any evidence of an outcome of an investigation containing a finding that the sector is competitive. The Minister should be asking the Competition Authority to assess the level of competition in the beef sector. He also needs to increase live exports and ensure processors have to pay reasonable prices for their produce.

18993	SeanSherlock	Labour	15288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	" I reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, said in respect of our ability to maintain our commitment in respect of ODA, namely, official development assistance or overseas development aid, as it is sometimes known. In the context of the partner organisations with which we work and which operate under the auspices of Irish Aid, the cumulative figure provided shows that we have been able to marginally increase the level of our financial commitment. This is the first occasion in quite a number of years that we have been in a position to do so. We have been able to maintain this commitment because of the work done by our partner organisations, of which there are many. There is no better example in this regard than the current crisis involving Ebola. Working on the ground and under the auspices of Irish Aid, partner organisations such as Concern and Goal are having a major impact in terms of delivering humanitarian assistance and helping to build capacity in the affected region. These organisations have the flexibility to react to this crisis and to become major stakeholders in the fight against Ebola in the countries most affected, such as Sierra Leone. The Ebola crisis is having an impact across transnational boundaries. However, the partner organisations - as a result of funding which is smartly divested to them through Irish Aid - are also making an impression in what one might term ""a live setting"". It is important that we have been able to maintain our financial commitment in this area and I am grateful to the Government for facilitating us in doing so. As an island nation on the western periphery of Europe which does not have any military standing, it is important - in terms of what we do abroad - that part of our foreign policy relates to targeting funding towards nutrition, hunger and poverty alleviation. The funding provided will allow us to continue the work to which I refer and to deepen our engagement, particularly with partner countries - such as Sierra Leone - with which we have bilateral relationships and in which we have ambassadorial missions. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work being done by Ireland, through its mission and ambassador, in Sierra Leone in the context of influencing - in conjunction with international organisations such as the UN mission - the government there to pursue a policy of containing the crisis. That is only one articulation or example of the impact our partner organisations, such as Goal and Concern, are having there. It is important to recognise the work they do and keep faith with this commitment, and I am pleased to say that we have done so. We have demonstrated our commitment in the budget by ensuring there will be no reduction in Ireland's overall official development assistance for 2015. We have allocated €600 million for ODA. While there is a slight reduction in Vote 27, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has said, there will be no reduction in Ireland's overall ODA commitment for 2015. We will increase it slightly, depending on the eventual outturn for 2014. Anyway, we anticipate there will be a slight increase. We have been recognised internationally for successfully stabilising our development budget in the past three years after severe cuts and in the face of serious economic difficulty. Maintaining the budget by providing €601 million for Ireland's aid programme will be seen as a significant Irish contribution in 2015. Next year will be the international year of development and I expect Ireland will continue to play a leading role at the United Nations in negotiating a new set of global development goals to follow from the millennium development goals."
18994	SeanSherlock	Labour	15288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	 It contained no reference to older people, which is amazing when one considers our increasing age demographic. Disability funding was not cut last year, but Sinn Féin claimed that in its document. There is no reference to the €12 million allocated for disability services for school leavers or the €6 million for therapy services for children up to 18 years of age. Neither did it mention any allocation for the rolling out of primary care. Sinn Féin called for the extension of the BreastCheck programme, which I am glad to say is happening. It wanted funding for suicide prevention to be increased to €18.7 million. However, it also wanted to increase suicide crisis assessment nurses and nurses in accident and emergency departments, funding for whom, it must be remembered, comes out of the health budget. Suicide prevention is strictly about the message in different areas of health, and we are developing a new framework. Budget 2015 provides for an additional €35 million to be ring-fenced for mental health services. This will bring to €125 million the total investment by the Government in mental health services since 2012. The additional funding will enable the Health Service Executive, HSE, to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change. The additional funding will be directed towards the continued prioritised development and reconfiguration of general adult teams, including psychiatry of later life, which had not been done until now, and also child and adolescent community mental health services, CAMHS, teams, which need to be bulked up. This will be delivered through further recruitment and investment in agencies and services to achieve a consistent service provision across all areas. It should not matter whether one is in Dingle or Donegal. The pathway to and the delivery of the service should be the same. In addition, the funding will also permit urgent specialist needs to be addressed, including psychiatric intensive care, forensic mental health, mental health intellectual disability care and psychiatric liaison services. I am sure Deputy Dessie Ellis does not disagree with any of these provisions. Additional funding in 2015 will provide for prioritisation of investment in community services designed to respond to the needs of those with co-morbid mental illness and intellectual disability. Someone with a disability can sometimes have mental health difficulties. Investment will also be provided for services for homeless people with mental illness, bed capacity to respond to eating disorders and other secondary care, the development of a seed CAMHS forensic mental health team, the enhancement of capacity in adult forensic mental health services, the maintenance and development of the incredible Jigsaw services nationally, and the implementation of clinical programmes for mental health. Additional funding will be provided for the roll-out of the Advancing Recovery in Ireland process. It is no longer the case that if one has a mental health difficulty it should be enduring or lifelong. People can recover, and the Government wants to ensure they have every opportunity to do so. Funding will address the physical health needs of those with severe and enduring mental illness. People with severe and enduring mental health problems tend to die younger. We must examine their physical health needs too. We will be integrating action in respect of Traveller mental health and the substance misuse strategy. There will be training for the prevention and management of violence and aggression and full implementation of the incident management policy. There will be challenges with our aging demographic. With so much research into dementia, I believe we will find a way to either slow it down or cure it completely. We have a difficulty with delayed discharge from hospitals for older people requiring rehabilitation services. However, this is not confined to older people; it can also affect chronically ill young people. We have set aside €27 million to address this problem in the short term. The long-term strategy will examine intensive rehabilitation that can get people, whatever their age, back home into their own communities. It will also help those at home who have become immobile - bedridden, as it used to be called - to receive intensive rehabilitation care and get out again. It will involve grants for home improvements and housing adaptation, which have all been increased. Deputy Dessie Ellis knows I do not stand in here slagging people off because I do not believe it gets anyone anywhere. We need to find solutions to the problems we all want to solve. Primary care will be rolled out with the co-operation of the Irish Medical Organisation and GPs. We will deliver free GP care to all children under six in the first quarter of next year with the co-operation of GPs and the IMO. Without it, it simply cannot be done. I hope the negotiations between the IMO and the Department will be successful, which looks as though it will be the case. We need to take a more humane approach to discretionary medical cards. Members know of families that have extraordinary medical needs. While they may be over the financial limits to be eligible for a card, we need to take a more holistic view on all of this. I hope this will happen too. I always say it is about the politics of the next impossible task. The following story describes this perfectly. There are two guys sitting down to breakfast. One says to the other that buttered toast will always land with the buttered side down if it falls from the table. The other guy says it will be more a case of 50:50. The first guy proceeds to drop his buttered toast to the ground. It lands, however, butter-side-up. The second guy says that just proves it is always 50:50, to which the first guy says, “No, I just buttered the wrong side.” It is the same when it comes to the Opposition - no Government will ever do it right in its eyes. I believe we are doing a very good job in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves. I am very grateful that we have extraordinarily talented people in the Civil Service and public services to help us do that job.
18995	SeanSherlock	Labour	15294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-21 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	 I thank Deputy Smith for raising this issue and I thank him for his kind words. It is appropriate to have this discussion on Ebola today, given the rapid deterioration in the situation in west Africa over the past month and with cases appearing elsewhere in the world. This debate is particularly timely, given that the Ebola crisis was discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting yesterday and will be discussed at the European Council later this week. The latest World Health Organisation figures are alarming - well over 9,000 people infected by Ebola, and over 4,500 deaths in west Africa. Despite all the efforts of the international community, the likelihood is that the situation will deteriorate further before it improves. I met Mr. Banbury when I was in Freetown in Sierra Leone. He indicated to us that the crisis would get worse before it gets better. Ireland has been very actively engaged at all levels in addressing the crisis on the ground and internationally. As the Deputy is aware, I travelled to Sierra Leone at the start of the month and witnessed at first hand the devastating impact of Ebola there. I came away from my visit with three strong impressions. There was a key gap in leadership and co-ordination, which I am glad to say is now being filled by the UN emergency Ebola mission, UNMEER, headed by Mr. Nabarro and co-ordinated by Mr. Banbury. There remains important funding needs and this has been recognised in yesterday's motion at the Foreign Affairs Council. There is a need to scale up capacity for isolation and treatment. There is an urgent need for more international health care professionals to staff the isolation and treatment centres. Ireland is one of a very small number of EU member states with an embassy in Freetown. I was struck during my visit by the very strong advocacy and co-ordination role being played by the Irish ambassador-designate, Ms Walsh, and her small and dedicated team. Ireland is working closely with international partners and others, including the US and the UK and the Government of Sierra Leone, in the fight against Ebola. The question of co-ordination is a key issue if the Ebola virus is to be tackled effectively in the west Africa region and if its spread to other countries is to be prevented. This was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday which was attended by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan. The Council's decisions yesterday represented an important further step in EU efforts to tackle the crisis by reaffirming the need to work together in a co-ordinated way and to pool our strengths. I wish to assure the Deputy that as a result of visiting Sierra Leone it is my view that Ireland must use its influence at the United Nations and through the European Council to support the need for a pan-European or strong EU response to this crisis. The bilateral response is a powerful one but it is not sufficient to tackle the nature of this crisis. There is a clear need for health workers and other key personnel to be represented on the ground. The Council meeting yesterday recognised the need to support international health responders. It agreed that the EU will provide appropriate care for them, including the possibility of medical evacuation if necessary. We must now work urgently to ensure it is implemented in full.
18996	SeanSherlock	Labour	15294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-21 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	 I can only speak for Sierra Leone. I concur absolutely with the Deputy on his remarks on the efforts of the NGOs. The work done by GOAL, Concern, Plan and other agencies is extremely effective. The Irish Government's response is that we need to be flexible in our approach and Irish Aid, which is very close to the NGO community, is being allowed to pivot towards the Ebola response. The big concern I have as Minister of State with responsibility for official development assistance is we must be mindful of the fact that we need to ensure we do not spark a humanitarian crisis in all of this. The nutrition programmes being delivered need to continue apace. Instinctively, I think the Deputy is right about the underreporting. It is only a matter of weeks since I was there, and it was at that juncture the UN had come to Sierra Leone in particular. Now that Mr. Banbury has been appointed as co-ordinator, our ambassador is working very closely on liaising with the Sierra Leone Government to ensure we assist in building the infrastructure to treat people medically on the ground, and this response is happening. It is a fair assumption that where there was no international involvement until relatively recently, and instead reliance on the Sierra Leone departments of health, social welfare or education to deliver programmes with the NGOs, there was a certain lack of capacity and the NGOs were punching above their weight. Now we have international co-ordination and various governments have responded proactively. I agree absolutely the European response needs to be rapid. The resolution yesterday, arising from the Luxembourg meeting, is significant because it recognises for the first time the need to ensure we protect health workers who go out there. A live issue we were dealing with when I was there was the need to ensure local Sierra Leonean health workers were paid, because they had not been paid for quite a period of time. It is difficult to expect an Irish or Spanish health worker to go there if the Sierra Leonean health workers are not being paid and are staying away. There was a strike at one stage. These are the issues we are dealing with. We are very effective and making solid progress on these issues. I agree the international response needs to be more proactive, but for our part as members of the European Union we have had an influence in bringing this to bear, in terms of our interventions through the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday. We are keeping a daily watch on this because we want to ensure where possible cases are dealt with medically within the region. This is the most effective way of dealing with cases.
18997	SeanSherlock	Labour	15294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-10-21 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	 The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council might have written a different pre-budget statement about the capacity of people to bear even more austerity because of the crisis memory, as referred to by Deputy Paul Murphy, had it been written following the demonstration last Saturday week. It got that very wrong. What the demonstration showed is that people have had enough and they are not willing to take any more. I apologise to the Minister for not being present for his speech. The reason I was late is because I was attending a meeting to organise the next big demonstration which will take place on 1 November. He will see that last Saturday week was not a one-off event but is part of a growing and sustained revolt throughout the country with people saying they have had it and they are drawing a line with water charges or any attempt to make them pay any more for the crimes of others such as bankers and bondholders. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has got it very wrong on that front. I have no problem with the concept of independent monitoring or overview of Government economic policy in terms of ensuring policies are not pursued which would create instability or crisis. I would equally say democratically elected Governments and, more important, the people who elect them must ultimately have the freedom to make their own decisions. I do not have a problem with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, saying he does not agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Government will do things in its own way because, ultimately, such decisions must be made by the people. The problem I have is that this so-called independent group has been set up by the troika and its main task has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for a banking and financial crisis that was not created by them but was created by the financial institutions, the big political institutions in Europe and the political establishment in this country. Its main job has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for that. That has been a terrible price. The choices we are offered are between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council saying we have to continue down this road and take a further €2 billion out of the economy, thus inflicting even more suffering on ordinary people, or the Government’s claim that we do not have to do it because its policies are such a fantastic success that it is not necessary to do so, that we are out of the woods now due to its policies which charted the way forward, and that perhaps the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council did not fully understand just how fantastically successful the Government’s policies have been, which is the reason it is not necessary to make a further cut of €2 billion. Both of those options are false, but there are aspects of truth in both. I agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's statement that the downside risks in terms of the European economy are such that we must be careful about the rather spectacular growth projections that are emerging. The IFAC has a good point to make about there being a serious danger involved in that regard. I worry a lot about the Government’s current triumphalism in terms of the projected growth it states will alleviate the debt burden, solve the deficit problems, and chart us on the way back to economic recovery and out of a boom and slump cycle. I do not see that at all. There is a problem with both the way the Government and the Fiscal Advisory Council look at the situation in that they have not identified what it is that produces the boom and bust cycle in the first place. The analysis of both parties has failed to address that fundamental question. As Deputy Paul Murphy indicated, there is a significant element of trying to rewrite what happened. The Government’s narrative, which it shares with IFAC, is that the problem was we were spending way beyond our means and therefore it was all about reining in public spending to avoid the boom and bust cycle. I put it to the Minister that is not what caused the crisis. I am amazed the Minister does not understand that and I am shocked beyond belief that IFAC, as a body of economic experts, does not understand it. Of course one needs a balanced budget and a link between expenditure and revenue, but the claim that such was the problem is simply not true. Our debt was manageable until the crash came. Our expenditure was not vastly outstripping revenue but what was a problem was the type of growth we had. At various times the Minister acknowledged the point, although even when he was in opposition he did not do much about it. Very few people - really only the left - called for a stop to what was happening and said the focus and disproportionate emphasis on the property sector was dangerous and was an accident waiting to happen that could result in an economic crash. That was the problem that led to the crash, which was facilitated by bankers, rather than us spending more than we were getting in revenue. I am worried about precisely the same thing now. There does not seem to be any real analysis either from the Government or IFAC about the type of growth that is necessary if we want to get out of the boom and bust cycle. Could the Minister clarify whether our plans for economic growth are based on sustainable models where one takes into account what we produce, for whom, and whether it is about meeting the needs of people and society or if it is just about growth numbers and balance sheets? That is the fundamental problem with the approach of both the Minister and IFAC. We need a different model that starts with what society needs, what people need and plans to meet those needs rather than the market model which is just about rampant, naked competition which is what produces the boom and bust cycle the Minister says he wants to get away from.

19005	SeanSherlock	Labour	15385.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	 For the record, I am not smirking.
19006	SeanSherlock	Labour	15385.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	 I express the Government's appreciation of the support expressed by some Members of the House today for the Stormont House Agreement and the Government's role in negotiating it. The Stormont House Agreement was a necessity. The months before the political talks began were characterised by political deadlock and a public increasingly disheartened by the inability of the political system to deliver reconciliation and economic renewal for Northern Ireland. The talks embody the collective desire at Stormont and Westminster and in Leinster House to show that politics can deliver by addressing a range of contentious issues, including how best to deal with the legacy of the past and charting a way forward that will deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland. The Stormont House Agreement has created the conditions necessary to allow a fresh start in 2015 and beyond. It is the potential for a new beginning which Northern Ireland's leaders need to embrace fully. I will address some of the points raised by previous speakers, in particular, about the outstanding commitments of previous agreements. As the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has underlined, the Government remains strongly committed to ensuring outstanding commitments are fulfilled. It must be repeated that, notwithstanding that commitment, the agenda for the most recent talks was essentially focused on outstanding commitments arising from the Good Friday and St. Andrew's Agreements, the foundational agreements of the peace process. To be clear, the Irish Government was not a party to the negotiations which dealt specifically with budgets and financial reform. That must be understood for the historical record of the House and the purposes of clarity in reply to some of the points raised by Members opposite. While the case of the late Pat Finucane did not come within the scope of the Stormont House Agreement, the position of the Irish Government on this important point has not changed. A commitment to having a public inquiry on the murder of Pat Finucane, as provided for in the Weston Park agreement of 2001, should be honoured and we continue to raise the case with the British Government. We were very conscious of the needs of the victims and survivors in the South, including the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and others. The new independent commission on information retrieval will operate North and South. When appropriate, we will, in a timely fashion, legislate for it. In terms of what was explicitly on the agenda, the Government's mandate going into the talks was to facilitate agreement between parties who held very different and differing views and this meant making a realistic assessment of what was possible within a very tight timeframe and locking down the best possible outcomes. We achieved this. The president of Sinn Féin, one of the parties opposite, has signed up to it, despite some of the attempts to revise his party's position on the talks. Having signed up to it, we stand over it. It is a matter of regret that the Executive parties and the British Government were unable to agree on the inclusion of the Irish language Act in the Stormont House Agreement. Nevertheless, we succeeded in ensuring the agreement contained an important and formal recognition by both Governments of the need for respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland. The Government will continue to advocate for the enactment of an Irish language Act and to encourage the Northern Ireland parties which support an Act to continue to build the necessary enabling consensus among their Executive colleagues. One of the parties opposite, Sinn Féin, is part of the Executive. I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence because there are some important points that must be addressed, if I may.
19007	SeanSherlock	Labour	15385.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	 In this regard, I am encouraged the recent announcement by the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Carál Ní Chuilín, of her intention to proceed with the publication of Irish and Ulster Scots language strategies for public consultation. During the talks, we advanced the view that a bill of rights for Northern Ireland could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. Regrettably, sufficient consensus between the Northern Ireland Executive parties did not exist to take this forward within the context of the Stormont House agreement. However, we succeeded in ensuring the agreement contained an agreement by the parties to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally and to the application of a broad range of associated rights. Regarding a civic forum for Northern Ireland, during the talks the Government strongly advanced our position that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate on key societal challenges. We welcome the fact that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive. As Minister with responsibility for North-South co-operation, I was particularly pleased that the agreement provides for a number of concrete all-island measures. The North-South Ministerial Council, meeting in institutional format, will agree, by the end of February 2015, a report on new sectoral priorities for North-South co-operation identified during ministerial discussions since November 2013. As many Members have observed, a key to realising the full potential of the agreement lies in effective and timely implementation. It is the Government's intention that the new framework be operational as soon as is reasonably possible. We will continue to take a hands-on approach. In the months ahead, the Government will continue to sustain the commitment shown throughout the talks and play our part in ensuring the full implementation of the agreement. Dáil Éireann will maintain its important role in guaranteeing peace and reconciliation across the island of Ireland, not least through the consideration of the legislation that the agreement requires for the new institutions in dealing with the legacy of the past. I look forward to the co-operation and support of the Members of the House as we progress this important work, through the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.

Although not everyone will become a doctor or a lawyer, we have concentrated a great deal on this and have gone in a different direction.

Although not everyone will become a doctor or a lawyer, we have concentrated a great deal on this and have gone in a different direction. However, when one looks back at the results that were achieved in the vocational schools, one sees that if reform is to be undertaken, the entire concept of the manner in which kids are taught must be examined.

19013	SeanSherlock	Labour	15387.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	 Ireland is playing a strong role in the international response to the Ebola crisis through the work on the ground of its embassy in Sierra Leone - it is one of very few countries that have such a bilateral relationship with that country in particular - and through its significant financial support. In 2014 alone, the Government provided more than €18 million directly and through non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to the most affected countries in that region. This included approximately €10 million through its annual development programmes in its partner countries, namely, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have a particular focus on strengthening the national health systems. Moreover, the Government has provided more than €5.6 million specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and for work on contact-tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes. The Government intends to continue this strong focus in 2015. While there appears to have been a welcome slow-down in the incidence of cases of Ebola in recent weeks, there are fluctuations from country to country. It is therefore essential that the international community maintains its resolve to defeat the epidemic and not lose the momentum of its response. The World Health Organization, WHO, reports that fatality rates for hospitalised patients in the most affected countries are between 57% and 60%, which still is too high. However, deaths outside treatment centres are significantly under-reported, making it difficult to provide a completely accurate case fatality rate for the outbreak as a whole. Now that Ebola transmission rates are dropping slightly and pressure on beds is reducing, more suspected Ebola cases will go directly to treatment centres rather than transiting through holding centres while awaiting test results. This will allow more patients to receive the highest quality of care at an earlier stage and that will lead to improved outcomes.
19014	SeanSherlock	Labour	15387.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	 Through the Chair, I wholeheartedly agree with everything Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has said. In fairness to the Irish response, it has been extremely influential in influencing the United Nations response. There is a United Nations mission on the ground - I was present in Freetown on the very weekend it arrived - and because of the presence of our ambassador and team on the ground, as well as Irish NGOs being on the ground in Sierra Leone and Liberia, we were able to influence the global response to the crisis. However, for our part and in respect of our response as a nation, it was early and effective. While I agree absolutely with Deputy O'Sullivan when she states there are more fundamental problems, the Government has an embassy and accreditation there by virtue of the fact that Sierra Leone is third from last on the human development index. This signifies Ireland's commitment to those countries on the very issues such as education, maternal health, nutrition, gender and so on. When I visited, I spoke to the President and the Ministers for social welfare, education and health on those very issues because the Government believes strongly that there must be action on them and that Ireland has a role to play in assisting countries such as Sierra Leone in that respect.
19015	SeanSherlock	Labour	15387.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	 To their credit, the Irish NGOs are working directly with people and seek to empower people on the very dynamics about which the Deputy has spoken. While I acknowledge the Deputy is not necessarily making this point, Ireland does not take a patronising or patriarchal view in this regard. We help people to empower people to build up capacity in order that they can do it themselves. However, the immediacy of the Ebola crisis has caused the Government to shift the focus towards directing funding towards that crisis per se by directing funding to things like call centres, community mobilisation and psychosocial issues. However, once the Ebola crisis is over, the work to which the Deputy refers will continue apace and the Government's commitment to that region of west Africa is as strong as it ever has been.
19016	SeanSherlock	Labour	15387.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	 I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As with other banks on the island, Ulster Bank experienced insolvency problems. Its parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, is under the regulatory control of the Bank of England rather than the Irish banking system. The bank had its problems and at one point some years ago, it looked as if it would pull out of Ireland completely. Such a scenario would have been a great loss, especially in the northern half of the country, both in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. We had some dialogue, including with Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, and we got assurances that the Bank of England would support the continuation of Ulster Bank services on the island. Ulster Bank will continue to trade as a competitive bank in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, because it had the kind of problems with which we are very familiar in the other banks, it began to cut its cost base and, in doing so, decided to close some branches. To give the Deputy the overall picture, in June 2014, Ulster Bank had 79 branches in Northern Ireland. This figure declined to 74 in December 2014 and it is projected to fall further to 64 by March 2015. Ulster Bank had 135 branches in the Republic of Ireland in June 2014. This figure declined to 125 in December 2014 and it is projected to fall to 111 in March 2015. Notwithstanding this, Ulster Bank remains a strong retail bank trading on the high street. Of its original 214 branches North and South, 199 remained in December 2014 and the bank hopes the figure will settle at 175 in March 2015, with no further closures after that date. The bank will maintain a strong network. On the specific case of Ferbane, it is always difficult when a bank that traditionally provided services leaves an area. This is hard on customers, residents and individual businesses. I see the Deputy's point of view and I will respond to his request and the requests of other Deputies in his constituency by asking my officials once more to contact senior figures in Ulster Bank requesting that they engage with the community and, in particular, further explore whether Ulster Bank can enter into an arrangement with An Post to provide alternative services for the people of Ferbane and other towns from which it is withdrawing banking services. I again thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which deserves to be highlighted.

19020	SeanSherlock	Labour	15400.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-02-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	 I am standing in for the Minister for Justice and Equality. The effect of the amendment would be to replace the current three-member GSOC with a single person. The Minister appreciates this is one of a set of changes to the Garda Síochána Act 2005 that has been recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. It was the view of the joint committee that having a single-person commission would provide for greater accountability and strengthen its overall position. The Minister has considered the amendment carefully and, as was indicated on Committee Stage, there is, of course, more involved than merely a change to the number of commissioners. In particular the Minister is conscious of certain advantages from having a three-person body and she believes these must also be taken into account. In that context the underlying rationale for the three-person model was that it would facilitate bringing expertise and experience across a range of different sectors to the work of the commission. In addition it was also considered to be a practical advantage that at least one commissioner would always be available to guide and direct operations. At operational level, GSOC considers this to be a significant advantage in a working environment as that faced by the commission. Indeed, some of its most serious and sensitive cases have occurred at weekends and during holiday periods. Moreover, a three-person commission with its legally required gender balance and its range of experience and expertise conveys a strong public assurance that fairness and sensitivity are at the core of GSOC's approach at the highest level. It also helps that potential differences between an individual commissioner and key interlocutors do not impinge on the smooth and effective running of the organisation. The Minister also accepts that up to recently the interaction between the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Síochána has not been functioning, if one likes, as effectively as it should. However, this is an area in which substantial work is being undertaken by both organisations. Furthermore - this is the purpose of the Bill we are debating today - additional powers are in the process of being conferred on GSOC. In the circumstances the Minister would be reluctant to alter the current GSOC structures unless it could be shown that a significant advantage would accrue from doing so. Having considered the overall position, including that specific arrangements have been made for the commission, through a nominated member to account to Oireachtas committees, the Minister does not favour moving to a one-person commission. However, conscious of the position of the joint committee on the matter, the Minister believes this is an aspect that needs to be kept under review. The Deputy will appreciate the consideration that has been given to his amendment. In the circumstances the Minister hopes that he can withdraw the amendment.
19021	SeanSherlock	Labour	15400.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-02-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	 With regard to the specific question from Deputy Niall Collins, we acknowledge that the vacancy has arisen for the chairperson of GSOC on foot of Mr. O'Brien's resignation. The appointment of members of the Ombudsman Commission is governed by section 65 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. This stipulates that the commission consists of three members, all of whom are to be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government following the passage of resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas recommending the appointments. The 2005 Act requires that the Government be satisfied that the persons nominated have the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for appointment, having regard to the functions of the commission. The Minister has indicated that the Government, in accordance with the 2005 Act, will consider the question of a nomination of chairperson of GSOC.
19022	SeanSherlock	Labour	15400.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-02-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	 I will revert to the Deputy. Mr. O'Brien stated that his resignation was essentially for family reasons. With regard to the timing and advertisement, it is a matter for a Government decision so we will revert to Deputy Niall Collins on that point. I note the points made by the Members opposite concerning one or three commissioners. The Government has set out its position on Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn's amendment and is not prepared to change its position in light of the further submission made by the Deputy. The Minister stated that it is something she will keep under review in dealing with the amendment before us.
19023	SeanSherlock	Labour	15400.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-02-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	" I thank all those who contributed to the debate. In particular, I thank my colleagues in the Technical Group. We are often described as a disparate group, but this was one motion we all found easy to support. The response of the Government in tabling the amendment was disappointing. The most breathtaking statement in the amendment is the line to the effect that the debt is sustainable and that it is possible to repay it. It is one thing to service a debt on which there is a productive return but most of what we are repaying is not typical national debt. Part of it relates to the banking collapse, while a major share of it relates to the crash in tax revenues from the construction sector, which had follow-on consequences in other sectors. It would be entirely different if we were paying back a debt incurred in building new water infrastructure, a public transport system to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, the cost of which is €8 billion per year, or undertaking a major house building programme to deliver security of tenure and affordable accommodation. However, there is no productive aspect to most of our debt. Reference was made to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, although we had not included it in the motion. The fund was plundered, but the pensions time-bomb is still with us. With an ageing and a depleted population because of emigration, the problem is going to get worse. In an article yesterday Fintan O'Toole referred to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan's explanation of why Ireland was not supporting Greek calls for the holding of a European debt resolution conference. The Minister said of Ireland's €214 billion debt: ""Our debt is in a very good position now; it's affordable and it's repayable."" O'Toole goes on to state: There could hardly be a clearer message to our gallant allies in Europe. Keep your hands in your pockets. You'd only be insulting us if you offered us a dig-out. Many of us can identify with this. I seriously question the notion that our debt is on a downward trajectory. The world debt clock shows that we are paying in the region of €339 per second in interest. Therefore, in the five minutes I have to speak tonight we will have added €100,000 in interest to our debt. We are making repayments €7.5 billion to service the national debt, which is close to the entire education budget. The Taoiseach said the water charges protests were about more than water. They are; they are about the cumulative effects of the big squeeze on incomes for a major proportion of citizens. Many believe they are worse off now than when the crisis began. People have put it to us that they have no reserves left and that, whereas they may have had a little money at the beginning, there have no reserves now. Some tell us that their incomes and outgoings are so finely tuned that something like Christmas, the car breaking down or the washing machine needing repairs can throw them into crisis. That shows how marginal the balance is. The Minister said the debt was sustainable and repayable in the names of the people struggling so badly, not only in the name of the Government. The dynamic has shifted in Europe. What it was not possible to talk or think about six months ago is altogether possible now. It is not only in Greece where this debate should be held. Let us consider the debt problem throughout Europe. Italy has a 133% debt-to-GDP ratio; France, 93%; and Spain, 96%. Even Germany has a 75% ratio. Joschka Fischer, a former Vice Chancellor of Germany, writing in The Guardian over the weekend stated: Nothing but growth will decide the future of the euro. Even Germany, the EU's biggest economy, faces an enormous need for infrastructure investment. He went on to write: ""The eurozone's cohesion and the success of its necessary structural reforms, and thus its very survival, now depend on whether it can overcome its growth deficit."" He also stated: Warnings of a severe political backlash went unheeded. Shadowed by Germany's deep-seated inflation taboo, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government stubbornly insisted that the pain of austerity was essential to economic recovery; the EU had little choice but to go along. Now, with Greece's voters having driven out their country's exhausted and corrupt elite in favour of a party that has vowed to end austerity, the backlash has arrived. We had better start to pay attention to it. The debate may well be over for tonight in this Chamber, but it is only beginning throughout Europe."

They are; they are about the cumulative effects of the big squeeze on incomes for a major proportion of citizens. Many believe they are worse off now than when the crisis began. People have put it to us that they have no reserves left and that, whereas they may have had a little money at the beginning, there have no reserves now. Some tell us that their incomes and outgoings are so finely tuned that something like Christmas, the car breaking down or the washing machine needing repairs can throw them into crisis. That shows how marginal the balance is. The Minister said the debt was sustainable and repayable in the names of the people struggling so badly, not only in the name of the Government. The dynamic has shifted in Europe. What it was not possible to talk or think about six months ago is altogether possible now. It is not only in Greece where this debate should be held. Let us consider the debt problem throughout Europe. Italy has a 133% debt-to-GDP ratio; France, 93%; and Spain, 96%. Even Germany has a 75% ratio. Joschka Fischer, a former Vice Chancellor of Germany, writing in The Guardian over the weekend stated: Nothing but growth will decide the future of the euro. Even Germany, the EU's biggest economy, faces an enormous need for infrastructure investment. He went on to write: ""The eurozone's cohesion and the success of its necessary structural reforms, and thus its very survival, now depend on whether it can overcome its growth deficit."" He also stated: Warnings of a severe political backlash went unheeded. Shadowed by Germany's deep-seated inflation taboo, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government stubbornly insisted that the pain of austerity was essential to economic recovery; the EU had little choice but to go along. Now, with Greece's voters having driven out their country's exhausted and corrupt elite in favour of a party that has vowed to end austerity, the backlash has arrived. We had better start to pay attention to it. The debate may well be over for tonight in this Chamber, but it is only beginning throughout Europe."

19028	SeanSherlock	Labour	15451.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-03-27 00:00:00	High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]	43	" I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing this Bill. I have the honour of setting out the Government's position on it. This is the second time in three weeks that the House has debated a proposal to amend the Constitution by inserting provisions concerning military neutrality. I will focus on the broader issue of military neutrality before turning to the specific proposals in Deputy Wallace's Bill. As has been stated in the House many times, including three weeks ago, the Government is committed to the long-standing policy of military neutrality, which enjoys widespread public support. The Government's commitment was publicly re-confirmed in the major statement of foreign policy priorities that it published in January, entitled ""The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World"". The statement sets out a comprehensive series of policy priorities concerning Ireland's future in a rapidly changing world, including securing our nation's prosperity, active engagement in the EU, promoting peace and reconciliation on this island, engaging with our diaspora, providing travel documents and assistance for our citizens when travelling abroad and promoting our values. It is on this last point that I wish to focus. As the statement makes clear, ""Article 29 of the Constitution sets out the principles that guide Ireland's conduct of its international relations"". These principles include ""the ideals of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations"" and ""the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes"". It further confirms that our foreign policy is deeply anchored in the values set out in the Constitution. The statement reconfirms that our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy. In line with this policy, we are not members of any military alliance and have no plans to join any. However, military neutrality does not mean that we take an insular view or isolate ourselves from the world. We are conscious of our duty and responsibility to do what we can to prevent and alleviate the suffering of others. In line with the Constitution, we take seriously our obligation to work towards the pacific settlement of international disputes. Moreover, our export-oriented economy relies on a stable rules-based international system for the trade, investment and tourism flows on which the prosperity of our people depends. The Government, therefore, believes in active global engagement and in contributing to international efforts to secure similar peace and prosperity in other parts of this interconnected world. We do this through policies aimed at combating poverty and hunger, principally through the Government's Irish Aid programme; advancing human rights; promoting disarmament; and working through the UN, the EU and with our international partners to promote international peace and stability. The contribution made by Irish troops to peacekeeping missions is at the heart of our strategy. Thousands of men and women have made an invaluable contribution to keeping the peace in countries ravaged by years of conflict. Our troops have a distinguished track record and a well-deserved international reputation earned over many decades. To meet the growing demand for peace operations, the UN has increasingly turned to regional organisations such as the EU, the African Union and NATO to manage operations on its behalf and under its authority. Ireland has actively contributed to the shaping of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, which equips the Union to take on crisis management operations outside the EU in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. The operation of the CSDP is entirely consistent with Irish foreign policy traditions and principles. It is guided by a comprehensive approach which seeks to tackle the underlying causes as well as the manifestations of conflict. The EU now has a wide range of competences equipping it to make a significant contribution to peace support operations by drawing on a mix of economic development, trade, mediation, rule of law and peace support instruments. The EU has deployed more than 30 military and civilian operations since 2002. Members of the Defence Forces have participated in some of these missions. However, the majority of missions are civilian in nature and involve the deployment of police officers and civilian experts. These EU missions are externally focused and designed to contribute to international peace and security. They are not related to internal EU security or territorial defence. They rely on contributions made by the sovereign decisions of individual member states. In Ireland's case, Defence Forces deployments are, and will continue to be, governed by the triple lock mechanism which is set out in legislation. Lest there be any lingering concerns arising from recent comments in the course of an interview by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean Claude Juncker, I want to make clear that there is no European army, nor is there any basis for one. The protocol on the concerns of the Irish people to the Treaty of Lisbon, which is annexed to the Treaty on the European Union, makes clear that the treaty does not affect or prejudice our military neutrality. The protocol also states that the treaty does not provide for the creation of a European army. The treaty itself states that there will be no common defence unless the European Council unanimously so decides and Article 29.4.9 prohibits Irish participation in such a common defence. Before turning to the Bill proposed by Deputy Wallace, I want to refer briefly to the issue of the use of Shannon Airport by the US. This is a long-standing practice which has been in place for over 50 years. We have never withdrawn or suspended the use of facilities at Shannon at any stage during that period. Ireland has not entered into a military alliance with the US or with any other country or organisation. Permitting the use of Shannon by the US does not challenge this position in any way and successive Governments have considered that this is compatible with our policy of military neutrality. Let me turn to the Bill proposed by Deputy Wallace. The Bill proposes that the Constitution should be amended to require adherence to the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (V), respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land. I will quote the exact Schedule proposed to be inserted into the Constitution: Ireland’s neutral status shall be affirmed by adherence to the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (V) Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land. As Deputy Wallace will be aware, this was one of 13 conventions adopted on 18 October 1907 at the conclusion of the second Hague Peace Conference. The convention was a product of a historical context which concerned the sovereign right of states to wage war. This right had for centuries been regarded as a legitimate instrument of a state's national policy. The law of neutrality represented a logical accompaniment to the sovereign right of states to wage war. In other words, states which did not wish to be considered as participants in a war had the legal right to insist on respect for their rights as neutral parties and as neutral parties had to comply with certain legal obligations under the convention. However, just two decades later, the right to wage war was relinquished by practically all states under the 1928 General Treaty for the Renunciation of War. William T. Cosgrave, acting on behalf of the then Irish Free State, was among the original signatories to the treaty which declared that the contracting parties condemn recourse to war and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another. The treaty further stated that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be shall never be sought except by pacific means. The prohibition on war was reinforced with the adoption in 1945 of the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2(3) of the charter requires all members to settle their disputes by peaceful means. Under Article 2(4), UN members ""shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any states, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."" Whereas the 1907 convention was designed to allow neutral states to stay out of a war, it has largely been superseded by the Charter of the United Nations which sets out a framework of internationally accepted principles concerning collective security. The old distinction between belligerents and neutrals is no longer relevant as war is prohibited by international law. Under the UN Charter the use of force is permitted only in individual or collective self defence or where authorised by the Security Council in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. Where the Security Council authorises measures, including military action, to restore international peace and security, member states not participating in those measures are nevertheless obliged under Article 2(5) to ""give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes"" in accordance with the Charter. UN member states may also be required to implement sanctions imposed by the Security Council against a state. Thus it may no longer be possible for a UN member state to remain neutral in the manner prescribed by the 1907 convention. Furthermore, the 1907 convention applies to the waging of war, which is an armed conflict between states, but it does not apply to conflicts within a state or to conflict between states and non-state actors which represent the vast majority of modern armed conflicts. It refers to the passage of troops over land or by sea, but because it is a product of its time it makes no reference to modern modes of transport, including air travel, or to new developments in technology. The 1907 Hague Convention should be regarded as a product of its time. Just 33 countries are state parties to the convention, with just two of these ratifying the convention after the 1928 general treaty came into force, which were Ethiopia in 1935 and Belarus in 1962. Ireland fully subscribes to the provisions of the 1928 general treaty and the UN Charter. The Government sees little point in ratifying a convention which has its roots in a right to wage war which, as I have outlined, is now prohibited by international law. With the adoption of the UN Charter, it is far from clear how it applies in the modern world. The case for ratifying the convention is weak, but the case for including a reference to it in the Constitution, to bind the State by its provisions, is weaker still. Three weeks ago, the Government rejected the case for inserting provisions on neutrality into the Constitution. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, noted that the objectives of the Private Members' Bill proposed by Deputy Seán Crowe were well intentioned but that to insert those provisions into the Constitution was neither necessary nor desirable. Those arguments apply equally to this Bill. As I said in my opening remarks, there has been a long-standing commitment by successive Governments to the policy of military neutrality. This Government remains fully committed to this policy and has re­affirmed the commitment in the global island policy. Article 29(2) of the Constitution confirms Ireland's adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes and it prohibits participation in any EU common defence. Ireland's policy on military neutrality was acknowledged and protected in the legal guarantees obtained in the context of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. In addition to all these important provisions, the conditions which must be satisfied to permit Irish participation in overseas military operations are set out in legislation under the triple lock mechanism. In view of these provisions, the Government does not consider that a constitutional provision on neutrality is required. I would be concerned about the potential implications of a constitutional provision that requires the State to act in keeping with a convention which has in large measure been overtaken by developments in international law and which may even be inconsistent with the UN Charter. I do not think that this House would wish Ireland to find itself in a position where it must refuse to take part in a UN-mandated peace operation or must refuse to implement sanctions approved by the Security Council because the Constitution had been amended in such a way that we had to act in the manner in which a neutral state would have done at a time of war in 1907. I do not believe that this House would support a provision which potentially might tie the Government's hands and prevent it from taking a public position on incidents of gross violations of human rights or the commission of war crimes that may occur during a conflict because it is required under the Constitution to adhere to a strictly neutral position as set out in the Hague Convention. The world has moved on since 1907. We no longer live in an era of belligerents adhering to an outmoded law on the right to wage war. We live in the modern world, a world in which we and most other states regard the United Nations as the forum within which disputes should be settled, and the UN Charter as the set of principles to which all states should adhere. We must look to the future and it is on that basis that the Government is not accepting the Bill."

In the short time available to me, with due respect to Deputy Wallace, I propose to respond to the Bill itself. I will leave it to the historians to testify to the verbosity and veracity of some of the points that have been made by Members opposite. It has been an interesting debate with some very lively contributions. I sincerely thank Deputy Wallace for introducing the Bill. Three weeks ago, the Government made clear in relation to a separate Private Members' Bill that it did not consider it necessary or desirable to incorporate provisions on neutrality into the Constitution. This House debated and subsequently voted against the Bill. My view and that of the Government is that was the correct decision. The conclusion that the proposed legislation in this area is unnecessary and undesirable applies even more strongly to the Bill before us today. This is a Bill which serves no useful purpose in the modern era. Some of the sentences that were parsed from the speech I made earlier have been used out of context. I would welcome a future opportunity to elaborate on that but my time today is restricted. The 1907 convention must be considered in the grand historical context and that is what is pertinent to the Bill and the wording that is proposed in terms of the change to the Constitution. The Bill is not necessary because the Government remains committed to the policy of military neutrality followed by successive Governments over decades. The commitment has been reconfirmed in the Global Island review which states: ""Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy."" It may only be referred to twice but it is there and it is inherent within Government policy. The Bill is also unnecessary given that the Constitution already commits Ireland to ""the ideal of peace and friendly cooperation amongst nations"" and to ""the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes."" The strict conditions under which our Defence Force personnel may be deployed overseas are set out in legislation. Our neutrality is also fully respected by the EU treaties and confirmed by the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people to the Treaty of Lisbon. Some of the Members opposite must reflect on their position in regard to that same treaty when it was put before the people. The Government is of the view that as well as being unnecessary, incorporation of the proposed amendment into the Constitution would not be desirable. Deputy Wallace's Bill would have us insert into the Constitution a binding reference to a convention concluded more than a century ago. This is a convention ratified by just 33 countries, 13 of them members of NATO."
19031	SeanSherlock	Labour	15451.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-03-27 00:00:00	High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]	58	 No country has ratified the convention for more than 50 years. I say that for the benefit of Deputy Clare Daly. I repeat that this is a convention ratified by 33 countries, 13 of them members of NATO. The Deputy may say that we are parroting - to use her phrase - words that were used three weeks ago, but I respectfully submit to this House that the message is still the same and it is no less potent by its repetition. I wish to inform Deputy Clare Daly, through the Chair, that no country has ratified the convention for more than 50 years and only three have ratified it since the conclusion of the First World War. I speak specifically and respectfully to Deputy Wallace's Bill in response. One could ask why that is so. It is because the convention is no longer relevant to the contemporary world. It has been made redundant by subsequent legal agreements, namely, by the General Treaty of 1928 and by the UN Charter of 1945. Regardless of all of the issues that are honestly submitted by Members opposite in regard to issues of neutrality - I refer to issues relating to Palestine, Cuba and whether Cabinet members are for or against NATO - and again in the context of the Bill before the House, we respond accordingly and efficiently to what has been raised in the provisions in the proposed Bills. The Government believes in a modern constitution for a modern Ireland that takes an active role in a modern world. We see no point in according constitutional status to a convention which is no longer relevant; which in large measure has been overtaken by developments in international law; which refers to telegraph and telephone cables and to the erection of wireless telegraphy stations; and which has not attracted a single new adherent in more than half a century. I realise that my time is up. While the Government does not support the Bill, that is not to say that we do not respect the spirit in which the Bill has been introduced. We believe the aim of it, which is to seek to instil within the Constitution the 1907 Hague Convention, is not the pertinent way to deal with the entirety of the issue of neutrality.

19043	SeanSherlock	Labour	15477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	486	 Small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be critical to our economic recovery and the Government will continue to support them, whether through start up or scaling phases. SMEs will continue to provide vital jobs and goods and services in our communities and regions, and consequently it is in all of our interests that SMEs are born, survive and thrive. I take the point made on the failure of SMEs and the point made by Deputy Kelleher on venture capital and taking equity stakes. The metrics will show clearly the Government has a very strong record, as does the venture capital community, in taking punts on many SMEs, particularly at present. People talk about a paradigm shift but a new dialogue has opened up about the notion of fear of failure. We all subscribe to the idea one can fail quickly and move on and start something new. This applies mainly in the tech sector. In other sectors of the economy one must be a little more reticent and careful about the rhetoric we use, because sometimes the failure of an entity involves many creditors and we must have mechanisms in place so people can find relief with regard to debts incurred by a company. We do not want to have a system which is too loose so people could turn over entities too easily whereby many people are left hanging for want of the expedition of the debt which would arise from such activities. I take the point, which is valid, but we need to be careful about how we evolve such a culture in this country. We have to state for the record that as strong as the foreign direct investment base is in this country, more jobs are supported by Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices than in IDA companies. By the end of 2014 Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices supported 180,072 jobs and 31,326 jobs in client companies respectively, while total employment in IDA client companies stood at approximately 174,500. The Minister of State, Deputy English, indicated yesterday that our aim is to create 100,000 new jobs by 2016 and we think this is a realistic proposition. We are well on our way, with an extra 90,000 jobs having been created in net terms since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012. We are well on our way to reaching the 100,000 extra jobs during this year, a full 18 months ahead of schedule. We facilitate formal mechanisms for structured ongoing engagement with SMEs through the advisory group on small business, the high level group on better regulation and the retail forum. These formal mechanisms can and do feed into the Action Plan for Jobs and the budget processes, ensuring facilitated structured and regular dialogue between the Government and representatives of the very sector about which we are speaking, which is the small business sector, on any issue of concern and on how to promote the economic development and job potential of the sector. It must be said that raising awareness among SMEs and entrepreneurs of the range of State-funded supports available remains an ongoing challenge for the public policy system. One of the issues which causes small businesses the most headaches is the lack of clarity about what they are supposed to do, to whom they need to speak and from where to get the right information. This is why the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched actionplanforjobs.ie and has partnered with a number of industry ambassadors to create awareness of the supports available. This is part of a wider effort. Another example is the Government's Taking Care of Business events, which also demonstrate our commitment to ensuring SMEs have easy access to the information they require to run a business as efficiently and effectively as possible. We also have the 31 local enterprise offices, LEOs, which form a first stop shop approach for business in each community and this will continue to develop relationships. If we look at the metrics from last week we clearly see jobs growth from the activities of the LEOs. It is four years since we took office and our economy grew by 4.8% last year. It is the fastest-growing economy in the European Union. When we started the Action Plan for Jobs the unemployment rate was at 15.1%. It has fallen to 10% and it will fall below 10% very shortly.
19044	SeanSherlock	Labour	15477.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-04-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	486	" I thank my colleagues from all sides of the House who have spoken since yesterday evening on this topic. The intention was to place SMEs, which give 350,000 people an income in this country on a daily basis, at the centre of the political debate. We have succeeded to some degree in that regard, given the media coverage and discussion on this topic. The intention of the motion was to lay down some very specific requirements. Rather than going for a scattergun motion and throwing everything in with it, we laid down very specific requests, such as the introduction of an earned income tax credit, the provision of PRSI and social protection payments, an information campaign from the Department of Social Protection to highlight the services and benefits available to self-employed people, an expansion of the role of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, changes in capital gains tax and an extension to the credit guarantee scheme. While all those things were mentioned approvingly by various Government speakers, what we will actually be voting on is, as I described it last night, the Labrador puppy of Government amendments. Everybody loves it. Everybody will pat it on the head and tell it, ""You're a great lad"", but there is nothing specific there that we can hold the Government to account on in terms of addressing all the problems that have been raised by speakers on all sides of the House about SMEs. This is why we will vote on the Government amendment. There is nothing specific in terms of addressing an insolvency system that is not working and not delivering, and which will not work and will not deliver under the current scheme. No mention was made over the two nights of why the Fine Gael Party is selling out the Labour Party again in respect of the bankruptcy term, why the Fine Gael Party is not bringing us in the Twenty-six Counties into line with Northern Ireland and England in terms of bankruptcy laws and why the Taoiseach continues to stick his head in the sand regarding the inadequacies of our insolvency network. We need an insolvency system that will deliver for all cohorts, but particularly for SMEs. There is nothing specific regarding the credit guarantee scheme and why, after a review published in mid-2014, which highlighted its inadequacies, we are now moving rapidly towards mid-2015 and we are no further on in terms of changing the scheme and addressing those inadequacies. Meanwhile, businesses the length and breadth of the country that need access to that facility are having their loans sold out from under them by banks. They are being sold to foreign funds with no respect, no understanding and no thought for the selfless effort that has gone into building up those businesses and for the people who are working in those businesses. They need a reformed credit guarantee scheme, but it is not a priority. It is put on the long finger. As I said when I opened this debate last night, this system does not understand how it is for someone to arrive into work on a Monday morning and not know if they will have money to pay their employees, never mind themselves. It does not understand what it is like for someone to go for weeks on end without receiving a cent until somebody pays them, and then they must pay Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, their suppliers and only then, if there is anything left, will the business owner get paid. Life as an SME owner is not, as people like to portray it, all champagne, yachts and big cars. It is very tough. A system that does not understand and whose every response demonstrates that lack of understanding needs to come on that journey and to understand how it is to go without being paid. Then we might see urgency around the credit guarantee scheme and the need for a new business bank. Instead of setting up and giving money to banks that have failed Irish business, and small businesses in particular, we need to set up a new business bank and take them on. The money is there to do it. That is what these two nights have been about - injecting urgency into this system and into the Minister's Department about SMEs and not treating them like some little child to be patted on the back and told: ""You're a great lad. Stay there in the corner, be quiet and don't embarrass us."" SMEs are the lifeblood of this economy. They will get this country back on its feet. It is time we had a Government and a system that respected them. The amendment shows no respect and no understanding of the position SMEs are in at present and that is why we will oppose it."

19062	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	 Deputy McGrath may heckle away. Let me say in the first instance that I recognise the purpose behind the Bill proposed by Deputy Pringle and welcome the opportunity to debate the issues. While I oppose the Bill I would like to assure the Deputies that the Government is fully committed to economic, social and cultural development within Ireland through the annual allocation of moneys and resources via the Oireachtas and also in the context of international co-operation. As Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I would like to begin by setting out our commitment to human rights in the international context. At the end of this year, Ireland will conclude a three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council. On the council, Ireland has worked to promote and protect the human rights of all people, particularly the marginalised and most vulnerable. I am particularly proud of the resolutions we led on combatting preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five years of age. The promotion and protection of human rights is one of six priority areas within our international development policy. Ireland remains committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP in official development assistance as our economy improves. We give particular importance to the role of the UN human rights treaties monitoring bodies. In 2014, Ireland's record under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was examined by the UN Human Rights Committee, a body of independent experts elected by those countries that have ratified that convention. Ireland's delegation was led by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Next month, on 8 and 9 June, Ireland's examination under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will be examined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. I will lead a delegation which will be composed of officials from my Department and from the Departments with responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights. Of course, we acknowledge that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lies within the states themselves. We appreciate the important role of the committee, and all of the United Nations treaty monitoring bodies, in holding state parties to account regarding their international human rights obligations. Ireland was proud to play an instrumental role in the recent strengthening process of treaty monitoring bodies, called the Dublin process, as two key meetings of international experts were held in Iveagh House.
19063	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	 I am not sure if it has been distributed.
19064	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	 We will make provision for that. I apologise to the House if the script has not been made available.
19065	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	 I am sure my officials are watching now and can ensure that it happens.
19066	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	 Without doubt. In March, the Government established an interdepartmental committee on human rights to improve co-ordination throughout the Government on the promotion and protection of human rights in our foreign policy. The interdepartmental committee will progress ratification by Ireland of key international human rights treaties, monitor the implementation of Ireland's treaty obligations, and facilitate timely reporting to international treaty bodies in accordance with these obligations. As chair of the interdepartmental committee, I look forward to watching it bear fruit as it becomes embedded in our operational processes. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is the main treaty protecting economic, social and cultural rights. It was adopted, as has been stated, and was opened for signature, ratification and accession by the General Assembly in 1966. It entered into force on 3 January 1976. Ireland signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1973 and ratified it in 1989. The covenant has been ratified by 164 countries, including all EU member states. The covenant contains some of the most significant international legal provisions establishing economic, social and cultural rights, including rights relating to work in just and favourable conditions, to social protection, to an adequate standard of living, to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health, to education, to take part in cultural life and to enjoyment of the benefits of scientific progress. In November 2000 Ireland ratified the 1996 revised European Social Charter, which is the Council of Europe's treaty on social and economic rights. I note two of the Deputies opposite have left the Chamber. I hope they will be in a position to at least have regard to the reply, provided on behalf of the Government, to some of the points they made.
19067	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	 On the same date Ireland ratified the 1995 additional protocol to the European Social Charter, which provides for a system of collective complaints. While the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has not been incorporated into domestic law, the substance of a number of the rights contained in the covenant is protected by the Constitution and by legislation. Although not cognisable by the courts, Article 45 of the Constitution sets out directive principles of social policy for the general guidance of the Legislature. If we are to move to a situation, and I make a genuine point, whereby this legislation is incorporated such that there is a constitutional referendum, we must be cognisant of the separation of powers between the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature on points of law which might come forward where test cases are made and what the role of the Legislature would be thereafter, or would it be diminished relative to the Judiciary. I make this point in a very genuine way. I know Deputy Pringle in replying to the debate will respond to this. The Government aims at ensuring that the State's obligations to implement the covenant in Ireland are met through policies aimed at improving the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including by fighting persistent poverty and social exclusion and recognising that others, including individuals, families and many organisations and bodies, have important responsibilities as well. The means by which the State sets out to meet its obligations in this area is through the allocation of resources. I will now speak about human rights in the domestic context, notably economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland. Ireland has ratified the instruments referred to above which promote economic, social and cultural rights. Since our last review by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2002, Ireland enjoyed a period of unprecedented economic growth, followed by an equally acute financial crisis, resulting, as we know, in an international bailout package and more than five years of tough measures. Social transfers were used to mitigate inequality and efforts were made to ensure a minimum core content of rights. Our approach was not to apply blanket reductions to all areas of spending, but rather to reform expenditure in a way that continued to protect, where possible, our society's most vulnerable people to the greatest extent possible within our available resources. Since taking office in 2011, the Government has been determined to fulfil the mandate given to us by the Irish people to repair the economy and public finances, create jobs and give our citizens confidence in a better future. The scale of the economic crisis we have gone through is unprecedented in Ireland's history. Difficult decisions have been taken and huge sacrifices have been made by the Irish people, but this has not been in vain. The spring economic statement confirms the path that has been taken was the right one. As we now plan for the remainder of this decade, our citizens have every reason to be confident and hopeful about their future. This future will have steady, stable economic growth and more people working in secure and sustainable jobs than ever before in the history of the State. It will be a future of stable public finances that will deliver money in people's pockets, higher quality public services and strategic investment in essential infrastructure throughout the country. These hard-won gains require protecting and securing and building on them for the future is the priority. The facts clearly show the policies of the Government have worked and will continue to work in the years ahead. Our economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, by 4.8% in 2014, and the Department is forecasting growth of 4% this year. Steady, stable economic growth of 3.75% on average is forecast for the remainder of the decade. The spring economic statement is part of a much broader reform of the budgetary framework. The next in this new framework is the national economic dialogue and I refer specifically-----
19068	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	 In the time allocated to me to speak on the Bill I am providing the context in which the Bill is being put forward. On the point made by Deputy Collins, let me say a national economic dialogue will take place in July. This will widen consultation on the budget with key stakeholders and will fully respect the role of the Government and the Oireachtas to make policy. Deputy Collins will have an opportunity to make her own or her party's submission to the dialogue and we look forward to the ideas she will propose in the process.
19069	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	 Let me remind Deputy Collins the Government has legislated for the restoration of the minimum wage-----
19070	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	 -----and we have taken thousands of workers out of the universal social charge. Let me also say the national economic dialogue is about ensuring we have an informed and mature discussion on the short and medium-term priorities of the Government and beyond. Undoubtedly, in recent years considerable sacrifices were made by the people of Ireland and it posed challenges in terms of the progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland in line with the covenant before us now. However, as I have stated, we are already seeing the fruits of our labour. The public finances are under control with the deficit falling below 3% this year and debt levels are set to move down towards the European average in the next few years. As a result we will be in a position to implement another expansionary budget this year and every year out to 2020 if this is deemed prudent and appropriate. We will meet our medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms over the forecast horizon. In order to return stability to the public finances, gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of more than €63 billion in 2009 to €54 billion in 2014. In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority has been to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible at a time of increasing demand. This targeted approach has meant that primary social welfare rates such as pensions have been fully maintained since the Government took office. Our commitment to protecting society's most vulnerable is illustrated by data published by EUROSTAT earlier this year showing that Ireland's system of social transfers and redistribution of wealth and income to those most in need is among the most effective in Europe at reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate. Budget 2015 marked a turning point when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets. We are now in a position to provide targeted increases for key services. In the area of education, we have sought from the beginning to protect DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. In 2015, gross voted current expenditure across the key sectors of social protection, health and education will amount to more than €40 billion-----
19071	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	 I have been interrupted twice while attempting to do so. I am speaking to the Bill and the context in which it is being presented. The explanatory memorandum states: The purpose of the Bill is to amend Article 45 of the Constitution by adding to the end of that Article a provision, contained in the Schedule, that the State shall progressively realise, subject to its maximum available resources and without discrimination, the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and that this duty be cognisable by the courts. I am responding on behalf of the Government on the issue of the resources that are being made available in order to recognise those rights. The Government is fully entitled to do that within the time allocated to it. I am afraid I am the only speaker on behalf of the Government, and there may be a judgment call on that. However, 30 minutes have been assigned to me and I fully intend to speak to all of the issues that have been raised by the Deputies opposite.
19072	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	 The Deputies, including Deputy Joan Collins, had an opportunity to make their points. I am trying to respond to the issues she and her colleagues raised. In 2015, gross voted current expenditure across the key sectors of social protection, health and education will amount to more than €40 billion, or 81% of total current expenditure. In developing proposed budgetary expenditure measures, due consideration is given to ensuring our society's most vulnerable members are protected to the greatest extent possible in light of continued fiscal restraints. I will now outline the key issues affecting Irish people and the Government measures in these areas. Net outward migration is expected to cease next year, with a return to inward migration from 2017 onwards. The young people who have left are coming back and will continue to do so. On the right to work, we have added 95,000 net jobs to our economy since the peak of the financial crisis. It is forecast that we will pass the 2 million people in employment mark next year, replace all jobs lost during the downturn by 2018 and, between 2015 and 2020, add 200,000 new jobs in total. Of course, we must ensure those returning to employment are doing so in the full enjoyment of their rights, including the right to just and favourable conditions of work. The Low Pay Commission, established in February of this year, is tasked with ensuring any changes to the minimum wage are fair, incremental and evidence-based. As part of that, the practice of zero-hour contracts is being reviewed. The establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission will ensure Ireland's employment rights bodies provide for fair and equitable resolutions to industrial disputes. In addition, the Department of Social Protection is in the process of increasing by 1,000 the number of case officers assisting the long-term unemployed in returning to work. Pathways to Work, the Government's labour market strategy, sets out a far-reaching reform of the State's approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work. It is focused on making sure as many new jobs as possible, and other vacancies that arise in the economy, are filled by people who are unemployed jobseekers. This programme, which is the largest single reform programme in the public sector, has delivered on a number of significant reforms. One such reform involved the merger and integration of three previously separate organisations, the community welfare service, FÁS employment services, and the Department of Social Protection's income support services, into the one-stop-shop Intreo service provided by the Department. We have seen the reorganisation of the State's further education and training services through the creation of education and training boards, ETBs, and SOLAS, the new further education and training authority. We have provided for the refurbishment by the end of 2014 of 46 new Intreo offices around the country, with a further 14 to be completed. The development of a new operating model as part of Intreo has yielded significant reductions in claim processing times and faster and more systematic provision of employment services. The introduction, as part of Intreo, of a group information process whereby all new jobseekers are briefed on the services available to them saw, during 2014,186,000 jobseekers attending group information sessions. There has been a profiling of jobseekers on the live register to help prioritise and direct the provision of one-to-one employment services. Since this process started, every jobseeker on the live register has been profiled and more than 800,000 one-to-one interviews between jobseekers and case workers have been conducted. The introduction of a claim suspension facility to allow unemployed jobseekers take up short-term and seasonal work opportunities is another in a broad range of initiatives to assist people back to work. More than 60,000 long-term unemployed people have moved into work since the Pathways to Work strategy was launched. The persistence rate from short-term to long-term unemployment has fallen from 33% to 29% and the progression to employment rate for people more than two years unemployed has already reached its end of 2015 target of 40%. That is not ideal and we are striving to do better. In 2014, the Department of Social Protection expanded its engagement with employers. The national employer relations team and divisional employer liaison teams work closely with employers and industry bodies to support engagement with jobseekers and the Department's employer services. The Youth Guarantee implementation plan was published in January 2014 as part of the overall Pathways to Work strategy. Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is to provide assistance to young people to find and secure sustainable employment. For those who do not find jobs, additional offers are provided. In 2014, more than 70% of such offers were in further education or training, while others were in community-based employment programmes such as community employment schemes, the Gateway and Tús initiatives, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. Budget 2015 announced the back to work family dividend, BTWFD, scheme, which provides financial support to jobseekers and one-parent family recipients with children who end their claim in order to take up employment, increase their hours of employment or take up self-employment. Under BTWFD, where applicants meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme, they are entitled to a weekly payment for up to two years following the expiry of their social welfare claim. The Department of Social Protection administers more than 65 separate schemes and services. Each week, nearly 1.44 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, almost 2.3 million people benefit from these payments. Some 615,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of almost 1.2 million children each month. Despite increasing demands across many social welfare schemes, primary social welfare rates have been maintained, including pensions, disability payments and jobseeker's payments. This has ensured Ireland's system of social transfers, which is the context in which the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights applies, remains among the most effective in Europe in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate. The Department of Social Protection carries out extensive analysis of the impacts of tax measures and changes to certain social welfare payments. This analysis is published as part of the budgetary process over a wide distribution of income levels and is further supplemented by regular analysis and commentary provided by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance publishes a very detailed analysis of the distributional impact of tax measures across a range of income levels and family types. This is further augmented by hypothetical family case studies. With regard to the right to housing, the Government announced that local authorities were to receive €312 million in order to build 1,700 homes in 100 social housing projects across the country. This is the first phase in a €3.8 billion, six-year strategy to deliver 35,000 new social housing units by 2020. The strategy will increase social housing supply and reduce the number of people on waiting lists by one quarter by the end of 2017. On the right to health, the realisation of universal health insurance remains the objective of this Government, despite some of the contentions of people opposite. We continue to progress plans to provide free GP care to children under six and adults over 70 by July of this year. We are committed to moving away from a hospital-centric model of care to an integrated, safe and efficient model which treats patients as close to home as possible, through the primary care model. The increased allocation provided to the health sector in 2015 will deliver over 1.7 million medical cards and a further 0.4 million GP visit cards. In 2014, staffing levels increased by 2,331 or 2%. The increase in staff has been concentrated in the hospital sector. There has also been €35 million in funding in 2014 and 2015 for enhancements to mental health services. The education sector has faced increasing demands over the past number of years. Primary pupil numbers have increased by over 25,000 between 2011 and 2014; secondary pupil numbers have increased by over 10,000 between 2011 and 2014; and third level student numbers have increased by over 7,500 between 2011 and 2014. Our continued investment in the education sector has seen the pupil-teacher ratio broadly maintained since the Government came into office.
19073	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	" The Government has protected the funding allocations for DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. Budget 2015 provided for an additional 1,700 new posts to be created in 2015, of which 920 will be classroom teachers. Special educational needs have also been prioritised through providing funding for 480 additional extra resource teachers and 365 additional special needs assistants. The Government has overseen improved outcomes in education, with more students taking higher level maths, and increasing literacy rates among our 15 year olds. We are also embracing the skills revolution, adopting strategies to ensure continuous up-skilling and development of our workforce to allow our citizens to be at the forefront of new technology and the creation of high-value jobs. Ireland is ahead of the EU average in the gender equality index for 2013 and is committed to achieving gender equality. The national women's strategy has enjoyed success in this regard. It has improved women's standard of living and access to health care, increased female participation in education, expanded the provision of early childhood care, and reduced the gender pay gap. Ireland also endeavours to be a safe and welcoming environment for minorities; one that respects and accommodates diversity in all its forms. There are critiques of that. That is fully acknowledged. The Department of Justice and Equality is engaged in consultation, for instance, with Traveller representatives regarding recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group. It is hoped that a decision on the matter will be reached shortly. On LGBTI rights, the upcoming referendum on marriage equality is held against the backdrop of several important legislative advances for LGBTI persons in Ireland, including the Gender Recognition Bill 2014 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. This sets the context for our discussion today about economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR, requires states that are party to it to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realisation of economic, social and cultural rights. The concept of progressive realisation constitutes recognition of the fact that it will generally not be possible to achieve the full realisation of all economic, social and cultural rights in a short period of time. The reference to resource availability reflects a recognition that the realisation of these rights can be hampered by a lack of resources and can be achieved only over a period of time. Equally, it means that a State's compliance with its obligation to take appropriate measures is assessed in light of the resources, financial and otherwise, available to it. Even though states may realise economic, social and cultural rights progressively, they must also take immediate action, irrespective of their resources, in five areas: elimination of discrimination; economic, social and cultural rights not subject to progressive realisation; obligation to ""take steps""; non-retrogressive measures; and minimum core obligations. If either of the two referenda on Friday pass, it will be the first time that a proposal for constitutional reform put forward by a constitutional convention resulted in actual constitutional change. I ask the House to reject the Bill, while thanking Deputies Pringle and Healy for putting it forward, because it is important that voice is given to a Bill that seeks to change the Constitution."
19074	SeanSherlock	Labour	15504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	 In closing the debate, I had hoped to be able to thank contributors for a well thought-out debate with constructive ideas and some exchange of views across the floor of the House. I had even harboured the possibility that the Government might agree to take the Bill on board and start the procedure whereby economic, social and cultural rights could have been put into the Constitution. I would have expected the Labour Party, in particular, would have taken the opportunity of the various centenary celebrations, such as the 1913 Lock-out, the 1916 Rising and the democratic programme of the first Dáil. Given the views of that party's founders, James Connolly and Jim Larkin, I would have thought that at least the Labour Party would have been prepared to start the process, but I was very much mistaken. There is no doubt that the conduct of the Government and of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, in particular, has been deplorable. I have rarely if ever seen such a display of arrogance. The Minister of State gave no justification for his opposition to the Bill. He spoke for 28 minutes about background and so on and spoke for about two minutes on the Bill. It was an insult to the members of the Constitutional Convention who gave their time, energies and weekends to discussing various constitutional options, including this one. They decided by an 85% majority to start the process of putting these rights into the Constitution. The 66 citizen members chosen at random will be particularly disappointed that the time and energy they have given has effectively been cast aside in such an arrogant manner. The Labour Party's position is also an insult to its own members. It is an insult to Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who proposed a similar Bill in 2000, as well as to the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who has a Bill similar to this on the Order Paper. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock's speech was effectively a justification of the inequalities over which the Government has presided in the last four and a half years. It is worth repeating that lower and middle-income families have been carrying the brunt of the recession while very wealthy people have increased their incomes and assets during the recession and the term of the current Government. Recently, The Sunday Times told us that the 250 richest people have €73.4 billion between them, which is something like 30% of gross domestic product. A couple of weeks before that, the Sunday Independent told us the richest 300 people in Ireland have a wealth of €84 billion. We know from the Central Statistics Office, the official Government statistics, that the financial assets of the wealthiest people in society are now higher than they were at the height of the boom. Not so long ago, the Minister for Finance told me that the highest paid 10,000 people each have €595,000 per annum. Side by side with that, there are approximately 100,000 families on social housing waiting lists and 340,000 people unemployed with a further 80,000 in schemes of various kinds. There are thousands of people on trolleys in our hospitals and those figures have increased since last year. Some 400,000 people are awaiting outpatient appointments and 35,000 families face eviction over the next few years. There are 300,000 mortgage holders paying a variable rate almost 2% higher than the European average. These people are bailing out the banks a second time. It is no wonder that the Government, which includes the Labour Party, did not feel able to put economic, social and cultural rights into the Constitution when it has presided over a situation of immense social dislocation. There is a huge sense of disappointment, particularly among members of the Constitutional Convention and the various non-governmental organisations which promote the idea of putting these basic rights into our Constitution. I commend the Bill to the House.

There is no doubt that the conduct of the Government and of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, in particular, has been deplorable. I have rarely if ever seen such a display of arrogance. The Minister of State gave no justification for his opposition to the Bill. He spoke for 28 minutes about background and so on and spoke for about two minutes on the Bill. It was an insult to the members of the Constitutional Convention who gave their time, energies and weekends to discussing various constitutional options, including this one. They decided by an 85% majority to start the process of putting these rights into the Constitution. The 66 citizen members chosen at random will be particularly disappointed that the time and energy they have given has effectively been cast aside in such an arrogant manner. The Labour Party's position is also an insult to its own members. It is an insult to Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who proposed a similar Bill in 2000, as well as to the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who has a Bill similar to this on the Order Paper. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock's speech was effectively a justification of the inequalities over which the Government has presided in the last four and a half years. It is worth repeating that lower and middle-income families have been carrying the brunt of the recession while very wealthy people have increased their incomes and assets during the recession and the term of the current Government. Recently, The Sunday Times told us that the 250 richest people have €73.4 billion between them, which is something like 30% of gross domestic product. A couple of weeks before that, the Sunday Independent told us the richest 300 people in Ireland have a wealth of €84 billion. We know from the Central Statistics Office, the official Government statistics, that the financial assets of the wealthiest people in society are now higher than they were at the height of the boom. Not so long ago, the Minister for Finance told me that the highest paid 10,000 people each have €595,000 per annum. Side by side with that, there are approximately 100,000 families on social housing waiting lists and 340,000 people unemployed with a further 80,000 in schemes of various kinds. There are thousands of people on trolleys in our hospitals and those figures have increased since last year. Some 400,000 people are awaiting outpatient appointments and 35,000 families face eviction over the next few years. There are 300,000 mortgage holders paying a variable rate almost 2% higher than the European average. These people are bailing out the banks a second time. It is no wonder that the Government, which includes the Labour Party, did not feel able to put economic, social and cultural rights into the Constitution when it has presided over a situation of immense social dislocation. There is a huge sense of disappointment, particularly among members of the Constitutional Convention and the various non-governmental organisations which promote the idea of putting these basic rights into our Constitution. I commend the Bill to the House.

19097	SeanSherlock	Labour	15540.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	432	" In 2010, various expert opinion in, or close to, the Central Bank was forecasting the demise of the Irish credit union movement. This expert opinion proved to be well wide of the mark. Only four credit unions out of well over 400 at the time, less than 1%, have been resolved since then. The credit union sector has worked hard at building up reserves which are the envy of every banking institution in Europe. The Irish credit union sector is the most heavily reserved financial sector. Much mention is made of the Commission on Credit Unions. To be fair to the Government, its establishment was one of the first promises on which it delivered. The commission’s report, delivered in March 2012, was a comprehensive and balanced way forward. It sought a balance of measures to secure the future of credit unions. It pains me, however, to say the commission’s report is being implemented in a selective and unbalanced manner, causing distress to the sector and undoing many of the positives of the report. The one size fits all regulatory regime being proposed by the Central Bank in Consultation Paper 88, otherwise known as CP88, is an exercise in suppressive regulation and micro-management, in which it proposes to effectively manage the very same credit unions it is supposed to be regulating on a dispassionate basis. Sure, the Central Bank consulted, and when it met with unanimous rejection from every organisation, body and credit union in the sector it decided to go ahead regardless. This is consistent with a pattern that is now well established. Our Central Bank has the most extensive powers of any regulatory body in Europe when it comes to regulating credit unions and yet it wants more. I urge review and caution here. I am aware of credit unions that have not been allowed to hold AGMs for two, four or more years but the Credit Union Act is very clear. Section 78(4) states the bank may direct the credit union to ""postpone, for a period not exceeding nine months, the holding of the annual general meeting of the credit union in respect of the financial year specified in the direction."" There are questions to be answered as to why existing powers are being applied in this way. Remember, credit unions are the members' unions, and members have the right to know what is going on. Very legitimate concerns have been raised by credit unions in recent days. They say that under existing regulation their efforts to introduce debit cards are being frustrated at every turn by the regulatory regime. Even the most basic, risk free, prepaid debit cards are being turned down. Now, the regulator wants to limit inflow of savings and loan types. What hope have we of developing a viable third force capable of competing with the banking sector? The lending restrictions placed on credit unions by these self-same regulators have done profound commercial damage. It is commercially naive of the Central Bank to think it can switch off lending for four years and not damage credit unions and their credibility in the local market. This was not a wise use of power, and is a further indicator that the regulator should not become involved in the day to day running of the bodies they regulate."

It would be remiss of me not to comment on the Government's very welcome initiative on microlending. Let us be honest, this is the business of credit unions. They have been restricted from operating in this area by the Registrar of Credit Unions' prudential lending circular of February 2013. This circular and the way it is interpreted by regulatory inspectors will make it impossible for the new scheme to be a success.
19100	SeanSherlock	Labour	15540.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	432	 Credit unions have invested in compliance and in improving their governance arrangements and internal controls. Those structures must now be funded because they come with additional costs. The reality is that credit unions need to be given the tools to allow them to compete in the Ireland of 2015 and to justify the costs involved in complying with that regulatory structure. New business opportunities, products and services are not being sanctioned. Not a single new credit union product or service has been sanctioned by the registrar in recent years. Credit unions must be allowed to lend sensibly. Of course their lending has to be prudent. The restrictions that are currently in place are simply ridiculous. Last night, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made great play of the fact that credit unions can now apply for a review of their lending restrictions. I assure the House that the review process is extremely onerous and expensive and involves a huge amount of work by the internal auditors of the credit unions. I will ask a fundamental question in this context. Why do they have to apply? The Registrar of Credit Unions has been crawling all over Irish credit unions in recent years. There have been on-site inspections. They have been through the books upside down and inside out. Credit unions are being put to the trouble, hassle and expense of making formal applications to have their lending restrictions reviewed. That should be done as part of the normal regulation of credit unions. The Minister should take that point up with them. When the Minister spoke about the Credit Union Advisory Committee last night, he did not mention that it is a statutory committee that has to be established in law. Equally, he did not mention that there is no representative of the credit union movement on the advisory committee. That is a joke and should be amended immediately. The advisory committee's terms of reference are very narrow. It is not looking at fundamental issues like the overall business model, the need to modernise the structure and the appropriateness of the regulation that credit unions are facing. Why have some credit unions not been allowed to hold annual general meetings for four years? If the issues in the credit unions are so serious, the Registrar of Credit Unions should come out and say so, based on the level of work it has done to date. Why are credit unions being left in the dark? As I said last night, the healthy credit unions are not being told that they are healthy and that they should continue to do what they are doing. Equally, credit unions with problems are not being told what those problems are and how they can be fixed. This is not acceptable. While the situation is quite bad, it will get much worse if the measures proposed in consultation paper 88 are implemented. Neither the Minister, Deputy Noonan, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, referred to the consultation paper. I understand that the registrar and the Minister are about to sign off on the proposed measures. I will give an example of the profound implications that such a move would have. The proposal in consultation paper 88 to cap at €100,000 the amount of savings that a credit union member can hold would affect 55% of credit unions. I accept that it would affect a small number of members, but it would affect over half of credit unions. If this proposal is adopted, and credit unions are confined to holding a level of savings underpinned by the deposit guarantee scheme, it will send a negative and toxic signal that the registrar and the Government have no confidence in credit unions and will thereby do enormous damage to the credit union movement. If the Minister and the Government want to help credit unions, they should press the pause button right now. Consultation paper 88 should not be signed off. A working group involving representatives of the industry should be initiated immediately to examine the appropriateness of the regulatory structure at this time. I am in favour of bringing it to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, but this should not be done after the horse has bolted. If these measures are signed into law by the Minister for Finance, we are heading for deep trouble. I would like to conclude by asking a fundamental question. Does this Government want to be the Government that presided over the gradual demise of the credit union movement? I am sure it does not. For that reason, this should be a watershed moment and a turning point. If this motion has achieved anything, it has put the future of the credit union movement firmly on the political agenda. I ask the Government to have a fresh look at the whole thing because the current approach is not working. Changes need to be made quickly. I commend the motion to the House.

Credit unions are being put to the trouble, hassle and expense of making formal applications to have their lending restrictions reviewed. That should be done as part of the normal regulation of credit unions. The Minister should take that point up with them. When the Minister spoke about the Credit Union Advisory Committee last night, he did not mention that it is a statutory committee that has to be established in law. Equally, he did not mention that there is no representative of the credit union movement on the advisory committee. That is a joke and should be amended immediately. The advisory committee's terms of reference are very narrow. It is not looking at fundamental issues like the overall business model, the need to modernise the structure and the appropriateness of the regulation that credit unions are facing. Why have some credit unions not been allowed to hold annual general meetings for four years? If the issues in the credit unions are so serious, the Registrar of Credit Unions should come out and say so, based on the level of work it has done to date. Why are credit unions being left in the dark? As I said last night, the healthy credit unions are not being told that they are healthy and that they should continue to do what they are doing. Equally, credit unions with problems are not being told what those problems are and how they can be fixed. This is not acceptable. While the situation is quite bad, it will get much worse if the measures proposed in consultation paper 88 are implemented. Neither the Minister, Deputy Noonan, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, referred to the consultation paper. I understand that the registrar and the Minister are about to sign off on the proposed measures. I will give an example of the profound implications that such a move would have. The proposal in consultation paper 88 to cap at €100,000 the amount of savings that a credit union member can hold would affect 55% of credit unions. I accept that it would affect a small number of members, but it would affect over half of credit unions. If this proposal is adopted, and credit unions are confined to holding a level of savings underpinned by the deposit guarantee scheme, it will send a negative and toxic signal that the registrar and the Government have no confidence in credit unions and will thereby do enormous damage to the credit union movement. If the Minister and the Government want to help credit unions, they should press the pause button right now. Consultation paper 88 should not be signed off. A working group involving representatives of the industry should be initiated immediately to examine the appropriateness of the regulatory structure at this time. I am in favour of bringing it to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, but this should not be done after the horse has bolted. If these measures are signed into law by the Minister for Finance, we are heading for deep trouble. I would like to conclude by asking a fundamental question. Does this Government want to be the Government that presided over the gradual demise of the credit union movement? I am sure it does not. For that reason, this should be a watershed moment and a turning point. If this motion has achieved anything, it has put the future of the credit union movement firmly on the political agenda. I ask the Government to have a fresh look at the whole thing because the current approach is not working. Changes need to be made quickly. I commend the motion to the House.

19105	SeanSherlock	Labour	15546.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-06-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	 I thank all the Deputies who have contributed. I do not agree with some of the comments but I accept that people are making contributions in a spirit of trying to impact on what the outcome of the White Paper will look like. I will do what I can to take on board as many suggestions as possible that we have heard. I will not go through each suggestion because if I did that I would only get through two or three. We have written down some the individual comments and we will try to look at them in the context of the overall paper. I will, however, make a few general comments because I suspect some Defence Forces personnel may be watching this debate. I regard being an Irish soldier as one of the most significant forms of patriotism that is left in terms of serving the State. This is a White Paper of which Defence Forces personnel, whether reservists or Permanent Defence Force personnel, should be proud and in which they should see a future for themselves and their careers as members of the Defence Forces in Ireland. They should view with pride the contribution they will make to their country, its security and that of its people. The Defence Forces are a hugely important part of our national infrastructure. They would be the last line of defence if things were to take a significant unexpected negative turn, which may happen at some stage in the future and which we cannot predict. My role is to put in place a White Paper that tries to anticipate all future risks, within reason, and to try to put together an infrastructure involving human resources, equipment, knowledge, training and the skillsets that can respond to the list of threats that change every year. A lot of the commentary in the debate has referred to how quickly some of the threats are changing. To all Permanent Defence Force personnel, I say that we want you to be proud of who you are and the career you have chosen. I hope that you will see, like so many others in the public sector, the rewards for the sacrifices you have made in recent years in response to a financial crisis in this country as we see improved working conditions and pay. I also thank those personnel for their commitment and loyalty for staying in the Defence Forces through that period and for facilitating the reform which was not simply a cost-saving measure but a reconfiguration of the Defence Forces to ensure we get the maximum effect in terms of output for the country from a strength of 9,500 personnel. I want to explore some new opportunities in this White Paper. I want to create a platform for international education and understanding of peacekeeping and conflict resolution and I want us to give leadership in areas such as gender-based violence, in which Ireland has some credibility, and other skillsets in which we have proven our worth in international peacekeeping operations, particularly in places like the Middle East and Africa. We have the capacity to build an international piece of infrastructure of real value to the United Nations and to our European partners. I also think we can do more in terms of corporate social responsibility to reach out to young people who have been failed by the State and who may be entering a permanent state of disadvantage in their lives. The Defence Forces may be able to transform a life by reaching out to such people. We have looked at international best practice to learn what might work in Ireland and I look forward to exploring that concept with others in this House when we publish the White Paper. There must be a sense of value, recognition, pride and self-esteem from being a member of the Defence Forces when a person leaves, as well as when he or she is there. For this reason there are some very strong statements in the White Paper around veterans' policy. It is totally unacceptable that a person who is injured severely in the line of duty may have to go to court to secure a significant compensation package. We are looking at putting new structures in place which are far less adversarial and which recognise the respect we should have for the Defence Forces, for the work they do and the risks they take. All this will require a budget which will necessitate an incremental increase over time, and we are committing to a ten-year period for this. I recognise the constraints my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and his Department are under at the moment and we are realists about this, but we also want to ensure defence is part of the medium and long-term financial planning of the country. The security and defence of the State is not just about soldiers and defence. It is also about planning and management across Departments, involving foreign affairs, justice, transportation and the Office of the Taoiseach, in order that we can have a defence and security policy for Ireland in the future that is fit for purpose in the modern world. I thank everyone for their contributions and we will do our best to accommodate the contributions that were helpful. Government policy on neutrality is settled and this is reflected in the recent policy document that came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We do not propose to change that but will reinforce it in the White Paper by the maintenance of the triple lock in our approach towards neutrality. This does not mean staying out of trouble all the time. It means Ireland is independent to choose what we do and what we do not do in terms of international peacekeeping and peace support. That is what we will continue to do with the triple of lock. I thank those working in the House for facilitating us in staying here for an extra 20 minutes.

19107	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	 May I belatedly congratulate Deputy Aylward on his re-election? I served with him on the agriculture committee under a previous mandate and warmly welcome him back. I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health and I thank the Deputy for raising it. Improving waiting times for scheduled care for patients is, of course, a key priority for the Government. Under Future Health, significant structural changes are envisaged for the acute hospital sector, with the formation of the hospital groups and the reorganisation of services to improve both quality and access. These structural changes are under way, but will take some time to fully implement. In the meantime, operating pressures remain on acute hospitals. In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister for Health put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient-day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. The HSE was provided with additional funding of €51 million to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved. In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maxima of 99.6% for inpatient day cases, IP-DC, and 92% for outpatients, OPD. In order to maintain progress and to make further improvements to achieve a 15 month maxima by the end of December, the HSE has directed that hospitals which breach the 18 month maximum waiting time in August are to be fined. The fines will be calculated on the basis of the activity-based funding cost of each procedure and are being imposed from 1 September. The HSE, in conjunction with hospital groups, is focused on delivering the improvements in waiting lists through maximising the use of internal capacity within and across hospital groups in the first instance. Hospitals have been requested to produce waiting list clearance plans in this regard. The HSE has already put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with acute hospitals, the special delivery unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. These include observation of the national waiting list protocol of 2014, adherence to relevant HSE national clinical programme guidelines and prioritising day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate. The latest published National Treatment Purchase Fund waiting list figures, from 27 August, indicate there were 306 patients waiting over 15 months for inpatient or day-case treatment in University Hospital Waterford. The hospital is working with all relevant parties as regards meeting the national targets. It has now developed and is implementing a plan to reduce the longest waiting times to 15 months by the end of December 2015. This will be achieved by the treatment of patients in routinely available hospital theatre sessions, the provision of additional weekend sessions and the possible outsourcing of the balance of patients. The hospital is also in the process of reopening theatre sessions that were closed for cost-containment purposes previously. The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that all issues relating to hospital waiting lists are resolved.
19108	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	283	 The Deputy mentioned a figure of 4,409. I just had a brief chance to analyse some of the figures. A figure of 3,066 is related to ophthalmology, for instance. This is a significant number. If one parses out ENT, one gets a figure of approximately 556, assuming that the figures I have are right up to date. With regard to gastroenterology, breast surgery and general surgery, the figures seem to be a bit more manageable. Further investigation is definitely needed into why the vast bulk of those on the list are associated with ophthalmology, for instance. We must determine where the lag is in this regard. I assume the administrators in the HSE and hospital group are watching this debate. I do know that they tune into these debates. I would be very surprised if they were not in a position to provide the Deputy with an actual breakdown of the figures and where the time lags are being generated across the disciplines. Certainly, the matter has now been raised on the record of the House. I could tell the Deputy that I will raise it directly with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, but the facility exists for Deputy Aylward to do it himself. The matter is on the record of the House.
19109	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	 I apologise for his absence. It is significant that a significant figure is attributable to one particular discipline. That needs to be interrogated closely.
19110	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	 I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It was raised during Leaders' Questions by Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh when the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, responded to his queries. I have been supplied with a response on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is unavailable. I should say at the outset that it is not inconceivable that Ministers are unable to take these debates in the House from time to time. The Deputy, as a former Minister of State, should-----
19111	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	 I mentioned the fact that this issue was raised on the Order of Business merely to make the point that it was a matter that was before the House already today not, a Cheann Comhairle, with all due respect, to make a political point. I am just saying it was raised by Dublin Deputies and was stating that for the record. If you will grant me some leniency on time, I agree absolutely that Ministers should be present, but a further charge was made by the Deputy in respect of the relaxing or control of building regulations. I cannot answer for that charge as it has been raised here as an Adjournment issue. Perhaps the Minister should answer that for himself but, nonetheless, the charge is made. I understand that Dublin Fire Brigade has no plans to evacuate residents from their homes and intends, rather, to serve an enforcement notice requiring that a schedule of works be carried out to ensure an acceptable level of fire safety provision is achieved at the development. I preface my further remarks by saying this is the script I have been given to deliver. If some development has taken place in the past hour or so, a Cheann Comhairle, I am not aware of that.
19112	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	 The issues which have emerged in Longboat Quay are a matter for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the receiver to the developer, residents of Longboat Quay and their management company as well as Dublin Fire Brigade to resolve collaboratively. I cannot answer for the charges that have been made by the Deputy in respect of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government understands that all parties are actively engaging to find a resolution to the situation that has arisen. While Dublin Fire Brigade has been proactively engaging with all concerned for several months it cannot wait indefinitely for matters to be resolved and has, accordingly, this week signalled its intention to serve an enforcement notice. I do not know if events today have overtaken that. Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Safety Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential developments. Compliance with the statutory requirements in regard to a building is, first and foremost, a matter for the owners, designers and builders concerned. A charge has been made here against the architect and the designer. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has no function in assessing or checking compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments, nor can the Department or the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, influence or interfere in the handling of specific cases by local authorities who are at all times independent in the use of their statutory powers. The Minister has a role in ensuring that adequate arrangements are in place to avoid the recurrence of such problems elsewhere. In this regard a number of legislative reforms have been put in place since the Longboat Quay development was built which greatly strengthen the arrangements in place for the regulation and oversight of such developments. The statutory registration of key construction professionals under the Building Control Act 2007 means that such professionals may now be subjected to professional conduct proceedings where instances of professional misconduct or poor professional performance arise - ultimately this may lead to removal from the statutory register which would affect the professional's ability to earn their livelihood. Building control regulations were amended to require on and from 1 March 2014 greater accountability in regard to compliance with building regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011 further requires developers to supply a certificate of compliance with fire safety from a registered construction professional in each such development. It is also worth noting that the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in the interests of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding compliance with fire safety arise, recently announced a review by an independent fire safety expert to develop a framework for general application in such situations. This review will outline general advice and guidance which can be used by owners-residents and their professional advisers, to ensure that an adequate level of safety is in place for persons in and about their development. This may include making provision for appropriate or enhanced fire detection and alarm measures; checking that appropriate escape routes from the premises are available, designed in accordance with current standards; and ensuring evacuation plans are rehearsed in each premises in the event of a fire incident. The review is being overseen by a steering group comprised of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authority representatives under the chair of Mr. Martin Riordan, former manager of Cork County Council. The steering group will prepare its report by 31 January 2016. May I conclude by saying I do not want to give political platitudes to anybody. I do not know what it is like and I cannot imagine what it is like for the residents of Longboat Quay except to say that there is widespread sympathy for the plight in which they find themselves at this time.
19113	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	 Has the Deputy a suggestion?
19114	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	 The points are made. If I interpret the Deputy correctly, there is a suggestion that the DDDA should act in respect of the common area-----
19115	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	 -----the entire development - and that the €2 million outstanding should be obtained from the DDDA or, the Deputy is saying, vicariously from the Minister. In other words, effectively the Government should pay the €2 million. If I interpret the Deputy correctly, that is essentially what she is suggesting.
19116	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	 For clarity and in the interests of the record of the House, I am not fully across this issue but perhaps the Deputy could clarify if that is what she is seeking?
19117	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	 So that is the Deputy's position and that will be referred to the Minister in question.
19118	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	 On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. By way of background, the Department Of Education and Skills funds further education and training provision through SOLAS. The latter provides funding to the education and training boards, ETBs, through an annual budgetary process for a wide range of further education and training services. The ETBs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the organisation of provision in their functional areas. Dundrum Adult Training and Education, DATE, is a voluntary group that was founded in 1984 and has been supported by Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB and, prior to the latter's establishment, County Dublin Vocational Education Committee for many years. DATE moved to its current location in Dundrum Town Centre in 2006. The ETB took out the lease of the unit and DATE has operated its services from the centre since. The partnership between DATE and Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB, DDLETB, has seen the adult education programme available through DATE grow and develop to meet the needs of those who want to attend day-time adult education classes. In 2014, DATE enrolled 1,990 learners for a range of courses in areas including computers, arts, crafts and languages. Classes are held on a daily basis, mornings and afternoons. In addition to DATE, the Citizens Information Service and a community radio station are tenants in Unit 2, Floor 5, of Dundrum Town Centre. DDLETB leases the unit and the two tenants sublease from the ETB. The tenants do not pay rent for the lease of their accommodation, although they pay the service charges arising. The ETB meets the services charges arising for DATE. The landlord has recently issued a notice to quit the unit by the end of October. It is understood that an issue has arisen in respect of the lease terms and conditions which the landlord has sought to have addressed. DDLETB has informed the Department that it is in discussions with the landlord to resolve the outstanding matters. The Minister is very anxious that these discussions are concluded quickly to the satisfaction of all parties so that the valuable service provided to learners and other service users continues to operate without interruption.
19119	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	 We are ahead of time, I think.
19120	SeanSherlock	Labour	15639.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	 I note the Deputy's closing comment and the quote from Mr. Ashe. I reiterate that what the Deputy has said is now on the record and I am hopeful that the powers that be in the Department of Education and Skills are listening. Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB has informed the Department that it is in discussions with the landlord to resolve the outstanding matters. I hope that the Deputy's intervention today will add to that case.

19163	SeanSherlock	Labour	15652.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	275	 This from Fianna Fáil.
19164	SeanSherlock	Labour	15652.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-10-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	427	 Yesterday, the Government demonstrated the seriousness of our commitment to international development as a core element of Ireland's foreign policy. Having stabilised funding for the Irish Aid programme over the past four very difficult years, we have now provided for the first substantial increase in official development assistance in seven years. It is hugely significant that we are providing €640 million for development assistance in 2016, an increase of €40 million or 7% on 2015. Just three weeks ago, I was part of the Irish delegation at the UN summit, also attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, which adopted a new set of sustainable development goals which will guide international policy and action up to 2030. The aim is nothing less than to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger over the next 15 years. Ireland played a leading role in developing the new global development framework and we are committed to maintaining our strong role in achieving its objectives. I take this opportunity to thank the Irish ambassador, David Donoghue, and his colleagues in New York for their wonderful work in achieving that agenda. We are very conscious that we make this commitment in the context of progress under the millennium development goals but we also recognise current setbacks as a result of the unprecedented level of humanitarian crises and suffering across the Middle East and Africa, which have created the appalling refugee crisis in the Mediterranean region. This budget is a vitally important signal internationally that we will reverse the slide in the percentage of our GNP which we provide in aid. We expect that there will be a small but significant increase in the percentage, from an estimated 0.35% in 2015 to 0.36%. We know it is modest but we are committed to making progress towards the UN target of 0.7% and to doing so in a sustainable and effective manner. Ireland played a central role in brokering agreement among the EU development Ministers in May to recommit to the target and to reach it, collectively, by 2030. I visited Jordan last week to see for myself the extent of the refugee crisis as a result of the conflict in Syria. We are fully aware of the burden being borne by neighbouring countries, especially Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. I was moved and impressed by the generosity of the Jordanian Government and its people, even as their economy is squeezed by instability and conflict on their borders, in providing for their neighbours in their time of need. Jordan, a country the size of Ireland with a population of 6.3 million, many of them refugees themselves, is now hosting some 1.3 million Syrian refugees in camps and in the community. The challenges for Jordan and for the refugee families I met are immense. I am convinced that Ireland and our EU partners can do more to assist them. Over the past three years, Ireland has provided over €300 million to address humanitarian crises worldwide. This includes over €100 million for the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, over €40 million of which has been for victims of the Syrian conflict. We have not forgotten the victims of other humanitarian crises in Europe's broader neighbourhood, in South Sudan, Central African Republic and the Sahel. We have also deployed our naval personnel to the Mediterranean to rescue people driven to attempting the crossing in unseaworthy boats. With the resources provided for ODA in 2016, we will do more. I am determined that we will increase our direct humanitarian funding for the refugee crisis, which is a crisis for Europe also. Ireland can play a leading role in a comprehensive European response, addressing the immediate needs of the victims of the crisis and its root causes in poverty, underdevelopment, conflict and climate change. We will review all aspects of our aid programme to ensure that the Irish people’s funding has maximum impact for vulnerable communities. I want to ensure that we will use our humanitarian aid and our long-term development aid, especially in our key partner countries, in a more co-ordinated way. Our objective will be to respond to the immediate humanitarian suffering and to build the resilience of endangered communities against future crises. We will work closely with our key partner countries, with the United Nations and with our NGOs to do so. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish NGOs and our multilateral partners who are working so hard in their respective fields to deliver on the global development agenda.

19167	SeanSherlock	Labour	15672.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	 The Government is strongly committed to Ireland’s overseas aid programme and to its place at the heart of our foreign policy. “One World, One Future”, our policy for international development, clearly articulates the Government’s commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for official development assistance, ODA. This commitment was reiterated by the Taoiseach at the UN Summit in New York in September which adopted a new set of sustainable development goals to guide international development policy and action for the next 15 years. Our track record in support of Ireland’s aid programme is clear. Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty. In that time, we have provided over €3 billion for ODA. We have stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target, once economic conditions allow. Now, as our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can begin to make good on that commitment. On budget day, the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years. For 2016, we have provided a total of over €640 million in ODA, an increase of €40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 level. We estimate this will entail a small increase in our ODA-GNP percentage from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016, so we still have a long way to go. The challenge now is to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented humanitarian crises throughout the globe, especially in Europe’s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger.
19168	SeanSherlock	Labour	15672.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	 We continue to maintain a very strong relationship with the NGOs, which are partly funded by the taxpayer through Irish Aid. The issue the UN and the multilateral organisations are trying to grapple with at present is the major challenge of how, globally, governments are going to be able to fund the commitment into the future. To answer the Deputy's question, one of the issues we are now looking at is that of how we manage the dynamic between long-term development goals, such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the numerous humanitarian crises that are breaking out, for example, in the Mediterranean, as well as how we manage the interoperability between long-term development goals and humanitarian crises. There is also the question of how we leverage the opportunities within the global private sector. The private sector has a role to play and, within the Department, we are trying to get a greater degree of traction in that relationship which goes beyond mere corporate social responsibility. At the multilateral level, through the UN and other organisations, Ireland has an important role to play.
19169	SeanSherlock	Labour	15672.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	 We would openly encourage organisations to interact with each other. We would really like to see a greater degree of consolidation of effort and we do not want to see any duplication of effort. Irish Aid has a track record, through its relationships with organisations like GOAL, of providing the seed funding that then allows GOAL to leverage the opportunities, such as in its response in Syria. If we can encourage a greater degree of that kind of leveraging effort and bring in the private sector, as I said, beyond mere corporate social responsibility, then I believe that pitches Ireland onto a greater global stage. We advocate that policy and we are working towards trying to get a greater degree of traction in that regard.
19170	SeanSherlock	Labour	15672.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	 I thank the Tánaiste for sharing her time. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan will set out to the House the developments regarding the all-party talks in Belfast in which he and I have been involved over the past several weeks. Beyond the talks, the work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across Government. Nowhere is this more evident than in our work to promote and develop North-South co-operation. Through this work, we are building the lasting relationships between North and South which will help to copperfasten peace and stability and deliver prosperity for all our people. The success of North-South bodies like Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland demonstrate what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas. Building on these successes is now our focus. In line with the Stormont House Agreement, a report on new economically-focused priorities was brought to the North-South Ministerial Council this year. Priority areas of co-operation for the Government include higher level education, agri-food, energy, climate change, creative industries, sport and other joint initiatives. The overarching aim is to ensure the most effective use of scarce public funds on both sides of the Border to promote economic growth and create jobs in all our communities. The Government’s commitment to North-South economic co-operation therefore remains a priority. As the Taoiseach has stated, the recently announced infrastructure and capital investment plan has a dedicated section on North-South infrastructure. In the Stormont House Agreement, the Government agreed to a financial package to support North-South work programmes as well as measures to promote reconciliation and INTERREG programmes, including the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge project and developing the Ulster canal. In this agreement, we also reaffirmed our commitment to provide £25 million in 2015 and 2016 to the A5 project. This was the source of some discussions in Stormont as late as yesterday. Research and innovation, one of the key drivers of economic growth and employment, has been a key area for North-South co-operation. For instance, the development of the North West Regional Science Park, co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, has delivered new hubs for the development of innovative businesses, creating jobs and strengthening the cross-Border links which are so vital to the economic development of the Border region. There has been very good progress to date in terms of North-South collaboration under the EU's €80 billion research and innovation Horizon 2020 programme, which was negotiated during the Irish Presidency. The first year has delivered over €19 million of EU funding to support North-South projects. We need now to build on the excellent collaborative progress to date and to work on our allied strengths in areas such as ICT, health and agri-food research to create and deliver more successful partnership projects. The expansion of Science Foundation Ireland's remit to fund researchers in the North will enable further work together on an all-island basis and will create a further leveraging opportunity. North-South co-operation also brings real day-to-day benefits to people on both sides of the Border. For example, when open next summer, the £50 million radiotherapy unit at Derry's Altnagelvin Hospital will provide access to radiotherapy services to over a half million people across the north-west region, sharing services and maximising limited resources. This co-operation also extends to the field of sport. As one Rugby World Cup ends, we look forward to 2023 when, hopefully, Ireland will be hosting this great tournament on an all-island basis. This joint North-South bid has tremendous potential to drive tourism. Speaking personally, I am hopeful that all of the stadia will be ready when the time comes. I refer to Páirc Uí Chaoimh in that respect. It is clear that North-South co-operation is crucial and indeed a central plank of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope we continue to fulfil our obligations both North and South in respect of the North-South Ministerial Council. I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a date for Armagh. It is important all political persuasions would sign up to that and that the Executive in all its forms would ensure that we continue to give that the energy it deserves. The current political difficulties should not get in the way of vitally important North-South co-operation. Now that DUP ministers have returned to their desks in Stormont, I hope the North-South Ministerial Council can resume its work, which has delivered so much benefit for citizens across the island. Whatever the difficulties, this Government will continue to work to support North-South cooperation and to help unlock the full potential of the island society and economy.
19171	SeanSherlock	Labour	15672.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	 It was the death of Jonathan Corrie that brought the issue of housing and homelessness onto the Dáil agenda in a stark way. It is alarming and disturbing that it took another terrible tragedy at Carrickmines, for the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families and for the wider Traveller community, to bring about a debate on Traveller issues in the Dáil. We are aware of the statistics which show the inequalities experienced by members of the Traveller community in terms of life expectancy, illnesses, rates of suicide and infant mortality. We are also aware of the inequalities in education. In that regard, I ask Traveller parents to be more proactive and supportive of their children continuing in school beyond leaving certificate into third level education. In the secondary school where I taught, too often I saw very bright Traveller girls leaving school at the end of first year. We have become complacent with regard to Travellers. Successive governments and Irish society have ignored the glaring inequalities that persist. What was common at the briefing today from the Travellers' rights activists was the total alienation they feel when they enter Leinster House. Leinster House has not respected their culture, history or ethnicity. Irish people are against racism and discrimination. We have a strong voice with regard to human rights. Ireland is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. We believe we have a social conscience, but too often that stops when it comes to Travellers. The academic research on Travellers over recent decades supports the case for recognition of their ethnicity, which is supported by the majority of Travellers. Accepting their ethnicity is simply respecting difference and diversity. If what had happened in Carrickmines and its aftermath had occurred in another country, we would have been horrified. While there was great support and sympathy from Irish people, there was not the same sense of outrage and horror that we would express if it had occurred somewhere else. Yes, there is anti-social behaviour by a small minority in the Traveller community, but there is major anti-social behaviour by many people in the settled community. I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and heard his views, aspirations and outrage. It is very disappointing that this debate will become divisive and that we will vote against each other tomorrow night. We said we did not want another death like that of Jonathan Corrie, but there were other deaths of homeless people. For the future, we should revert to the seanfhocal, ní neart go cur le chéile.

In that regard, I ask Traveller parents to be more proactive and supportive of their children continuing in school beyond leaving certificate into third level education. In the secondary school where I taught, too often I saw very bright Traveller girls leaving school at the end of first year. We have become complacent with regard to Travellers. Successive governments and Irish society have ignored the glaring inequalities that persist. What was common at the briefing today from the Travellers' rights activists was the total alienation they feel when they enter Leinster House. Leinster House has not respected their culture, history or ethnicity. Irish people are against racism and discrimination. We have a strong voice with regard to human rights. Ireland is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. We believe we have a social conscience, but too often that stops when it comes to Travellers. The academic research on Travellers over recent decades supports the case for recognition of their ethnicity, which is supported by the majority of Travellers. Accepting their ethnicity is simply respecting difference and diversity. If what had happened in Carrickmines and its aftermath had occurred in another country, we would have been horrified. While there was great support and sympathy from Irish people, there was not the same sense of outrage and horror that we would express if it had occurred somewhere else. Yes, there is anti-social behaviour by a small minority in the Traveller community, but there is major anti-social behaviour by many people in the settled community. I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and heard his views, aspirations and outrage. It is very disappointing that this debate will become divisive and that we will vote against each other tomorrow night. We said we did not want another death like that of Jonathan Corrie, but there were other deaths of homeless people. For the future, we should revert to the seanfhocal, ní neart go cur le chéile.

19177	SeanSherlock	Labour	15694.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	546	" I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to the statements so far. I have listened with interest to the debate and we must bear in mind that the agreement is entitled A Fresh Start. The agreement is not a final destination but represents a step forward towards normalising politics and society in Northern Ireland. I share the articulation of the disappointment on the issues around legacy. As a result of where I am and where my generation is in relation to the legacy issues, we bear a certain responsibility for dealing with the past. Is it going to take another generation, or a generation beyond that? When I look at the pupils and students who are here as visitors today, I wonder whether we will have to wait for someone of their generation to finally crack the legacy issues and to deal with the past. Successive Irish Governments, regardless of their political persuasions, have sought to lean in towards the British Government on these issues in a forceful and genuine manner. If we are going to talk about it in a rhetorical way, it is important for all of us - from a party political point of view - to be honest with each other about just what that will mean in real terms. It will involve the British Government and people from other party political perspectives opening up the closets and seeing where the skeletons are, and if we are honest with ourselves, we will admit that it is incumbent on us all to look deeply at just what the issues of disclosure and national security mean. Are they used as mere words to protect entities against the letting in of the light? There has been much mention in this Chamber of the campaign that is being run by U2. It would appear that many Members of this House have been at the U2 concerts that have taken place in recent days, at which there has been a particular articulation in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I can say in good stead with a degree of integrity that this and previous Governments have consistently sought to ensure the mandate given by this House on the issue of disclosure in this regard is fulfilled. We will continue to do that. The agreement is incomplete if we always have to come back to the legacy issues and the need to deal with the past. It seems to be an iterative process on this island. I do not mean to be ageist when I say that my generation fails to understand why these issues cannot be surmounted. We need to deal with them assuredly. We need to ensure we speak for the victims. If we can get beyond these issues, we can achieve a greater degree of transparency. When I talk to ordinary citizens in the Six Counties of the North, it does not appear to me that they are as engaged as they might be with the issues at Stormont. The constant cry I hear from ordinary people of all persuasions is ""they need to get on with it up on the hill"". That is what people seem to want. They want normal, normative politics and a real economy. Every Government needs to move towards assisting and facilitating that, and cajoling for it, in every possible way. As Minister of State with responsibility for North-South co-operation, I can say we have made a real commitment in the form of the additional £25 million that is being provided for the A5 project. It is important that we unlock the potential of the north west of this island. It could be argued that there is a disparity in growth and economic prosperity between the regions to the east and the west of the River Bann. We need to do more to unlock the potential of the north west, particularly the Donegal-Derry region. That is what we are working towards. As a Minister of State with an economic Ministry, it is no harm for me to say on the record of this House that my colleagues and I recently visited the Bombardier facility in Belfast. Two companies from the South of Ireland - Dawnlough from Galway and Takumi from Limerick - are sub-supplying parts and components for the aerospace and aeronautical industry into Bombardier. That is the island or the Ireland that I want to see. I want big companies like Bombardier, which is a significant player in the global aerospace industry, to source their materials from as near as possible, and preferably on the island of Ireland. Such an approach will sustain jobs in the North and the South, sustain a real economy and really knit the two parts of this island together in the way that needs to happen. It will allow us to move beyond some of the empty rhetoric that is sometimes employed when we talk about the North, the South or North-South co-operation. As I have said, we feel that this is an iterative process. We feel strongly that the legacy issue remains outstanding. We feel an obligation to the families, the victims and those people who want to deal with the past in a transparent way. We will continue to feel that way and I believe those who step into the breach long after people like me cease to inhabit positions of this nature will continue to do so. At what point do we ask ourselves certain questions? Do a certain number of generations have to pass while people seek justice before these matters are forgotten and written out of history? At what point in the next number of years can we get beyond this issue or deal with it in a substantive way? As long as it is not dealt with, it will continue to cast a shadow over everything we are doing to try to bring about the normalisation of society and, as has been said here, move towards a society that is beyond conflict. I want to acknowledge the roles of the First Minister, Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. I want to say in a personal way that they are tough negotiators and formidable politicians. I would say that when it came to hammering out a deal on real economy, the restoration of normal politics and the restoration of the institutions, they had the best interests of the people of the North at heart. There are still many flaws and issues that need to be dealt with, however. I am not going to critique people in another part of this island, in the context of my vision for a greater degree of traction on the issues that are still outstanding, other than to say that this deal offers the potential for realpolitik to reign supreme within the Stormont institution. It has to be recorded for historical purposes - I am thinking of the future historians who will parse through these debates - that the issue of welfare legislation will now pass to Westminster for this period. That is a fact. I will conclude by responding to those who have spoken about sister parties. I have never witnessed a debate that featured so many references to Westminster, George Osborne and the Tories. To be honest, maybe it is time for us to look at the abstentionist policy."

What is factual is that if this goes is ahead in the form in which it has been presented, the future viability of credit unions is at risk. It goes without saying we all acknowledge, compliment, thank and congratulate the credit union movement throughout the country for the work, help and assistance it gives to communities, to such an extent that up to 70% of the population are members of credit unions. In my county, there are 35,000 members in Tullamore, 9,000 in Clara and up to 50,000 or 60,000 throughout the county. Credit unions are integral and vital parts of communities. We know banks are withdrawing services throughout the country. We heard Deputy Mulherin speak about the difference between the atmosphere in a credit union office and that in a bank office. We see interaction, vitality and engagement in a credit union office, while we see staff in banks introducing customers to machines. Earlier this year, Ferbane in my county lost Ulster Bank, which was the last bank in town. I heard Deputy Heydon from Kildare speak about the vacuum being created by the loss of the credit union in Newbridge over the past two years. He should inform his colleagues because they will face the same vacuum in their communities in the coming years if what is proposed in CP88 is signed by the Minister. Over the past four years, we have seen the Government stand idly by as post offices went to the wall. We have seen Garda stations closed and social welfare offices withdrawn from communities. All of this is in addition to the threat that exists that the loss of credit unions will take away whatever bit of vitality could be perceived and held in communities. We have seen no effort to address the deficit that exists in many towns and villages and no overhaul of commercial rates or dedicated plans for towns and villages. Like many of his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, recognises the value of credit unions. He spoke of the Government's amendment to the motion, which would have us believe it addresses the concerns and fears being reiterated by members throughout the country. He accepts, of course, the commission's findings in their entirety and the independence of the registrar, but does he, and it appears that he does, accept the selective implementation of the registrar's various recommendations on this document as it is at present? He forgets, and does not acknowledge, the omission of other recommendations which might assist credit unions in helping and assisting small and medium-sized enterprises, and which may help with mortgage lending and go beyond the restrictive 10% cap being put on mortgages for more than 25 years. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, also stated there is provision in the amendment, and I also heard this in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, for the Government to explore the possibility of an input from the credit union movement with regard to the social housing dilemma we have. What exploration is required, when a credit union has the capacity to make available through a central fund, similar to the Canadian model, funding to local communities and local authorities to build houses in their area? Yesterday, I was at a meeting at which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government spoke about the Estimates and looking back at the spend this year. This time last year, it made a commitment with regard to a €4 billion investment over five years, whereby there would be 7,500 new homes throughout the country this year, 4,000 of which would be new builds. The number that was built was 200, which is five per local authority. My county must have been the exception because it got eight, although this was over the past four years. The credit union movement has at its disposal investment capacity in this sector for local authorities and even a return of 2% would be far in excess of what is being received in the banks at present. Members of the Government parties should not give us the platitudes we have heard. I will be honest, and I do not like saying this, but I am a bit worried about some of the condescending tones I heard from some of the speakers on the other side of the House. The credit union movement is professional and forward thinking, which is well capable - and more than capable as has been said by some speakers - of meeting the demands of the economy as we know them. It is much more capable when it is compared to the way in which the banks conducted their business. I heard Deputy Nolan of the Labour Party state yesterday that the debate will have very little effect. Regardless of the vote, he called for more engagement. This sentiment personifies in my mind and for my party the lack of appreciation of the ramifications of this Administration's governance. There must be political consequences. I have met representatives of credit unions over the past number of months, including a senior delegation from the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, last week, and I spoke to people in the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, as well. It became quite apparent to me that this had to get political, as members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, as the Government, need to accept and face the consequences of their actions. For example, when our party put in place a four-year programme to close the gap between income and expenditure, it suffered the political consequences, despite the fact that the current Government continued along that path and closed the gap by the final third necessary. That was to the Government parties' benefit but, more importantly, it was to the country's benefit. We suffered the political consequences of putting that in place, rightly or wrongly. We accepted the decision of the Irish people of putting those opposite into government and taking it from there. The last Government capitalised Irish banks; the Irish people capitalised them. This Government told us after the June 2012 summit that there would be retrospective bank recapitalisation, as there should have been, but we doubted it was the game changer that the Government argued it was. It was a footnote at the bottom of the agreement. Instead, we have seen higher mortgage interest rates, 2% above the European average, with a bank veto on solutions proposed by customers, mass evictions, no social dividend from NAMA and €8 billion of credit union soft deposits sitting in banks ever since. Is it not gas to think that, having been saved by the Irish people, banks are now propped up by the credit unions with €8 billion of investment? The same credit unions are barred from competing in the way they can and should in the market. It is time for the members of Fine Gael to face up to the political consequences of their actions. It is time for those party members to realise the power in the hands of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with respect to the ramifications of what they sign and when they sign it. Many have spoken of how, earlier today, representatives of the ILCU, CUDA and the Credit Union Managers' Association came before the finance committee. There was all-party agreement, on the suggestion of Deputy Michael McGrath, that the committee should meet the registrar, and a date has been fixed for 16 December. The committee has written to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, asking him to withdraw or withhold his intention to sign CP88 at least until that meeting takes place. He claims he has passed on the concerns about the perceived implications of what is contained within it to the registrar in recent weeks, following his meeting with representatives of those bodies on 12 November. Yet, all of a sudden, he has agreed to meet representatives of the credit unions again tomorrow. That comes after hearing what we have said and what members have said throughout the country, and with Members from his party and the Labour Party reminding him of the issue. In the likes of Offaly there are 50,000 or 60,000 credit union members and - make no mistake about it - my colleagues and I will remind each and every one about the ramifications and political consequences arising from the Government's actions if it goes ahead with this. As I said earlier, it is hiding behind necessary rectifications and controls in the way financial institutions have to be monitored. I accept that. There was scaremongering from the Minister for Finance with regard to credit unions; it was not from a consultant, as Deputy Rabbitte argued. The Minister for Finance for this State said it would take up to €1 billion to rectify the harm that might exist in credit unions, but it took only €40 million. The Government thinks it can hide behind regulators and registrars while saying it accepts all that is contained in the commission's recommendations. It will stand idly by when the registrar selectively chooses from those recommendations and puts that under the nose of the Minister for Finance. At this eleventh hour, he still thinks there are ""perceived"" ramifications, but there is nothing perceived about our putting a second motion before this House. It is time to wake up and smell the coffee. It is time for the Government and its party members to realise that if they vote for this, they should not expect members of credit unions to vote for them."

It is time for those party members to realise the power in the hands of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with respect to the ramifications of what they sign and when they sign it. Many have spoken of how, earlier today, representatives of the ILCU, CUDA and the Credit Union Managers' Association came before the finance committee. There was all-party agreement, on the suggestion of Deputy Michael McGrath, that the committee should meet the registrar, and a date has been fixed for 16 December. The committee has written to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, asking him to withdraw or withhold his intention to sign CP88 at least until that meeting takes place. He claims he has passed on the concerns about the perceived implications of what is contained within it to the registrar in recent weeks, following his meeting with representatives of those bodies on 12 November. Yet, all of a sudden, he has agreed to meet representatives of the credit unions again tomorrow. That comes after hearing what we have said and what members have said throughout the country, and with Members from his party and the Labour Party reminding him of the issue. In the likes of Offaly there are 50,000 or 60,000 credit union members and - make no mistake about it - my colleagues and I will remind each and every one about the ramifications and political consequences arising from the Government's actions if it goes ahead with this. As I said earlier, it is hiding behind necessary rectifications and controls in the way financial institutions have to be monitored. I accept that. There was scaremongering from the Minister for Finance with regard to credit unions; it was not from a consultant, as Deputy Rabbitte argued. The Minister for Finance for this State said it would take up to €1 billion to rectify the harm that might exist in credit unions, but it took only €40 million. The Government thinks it can hide behind regulators and registrars while saying it accepts all that is contained in the commission's recommendations. It will stand idly by when the registrar selectively chooses from those recommendations and puts that under the nose of the Minister for Finance. At this eleventh hour, he still thinks there are ""perceived"" ramifications, but there is nothing perceived about our putting a second motion before this House. It is time to wake up and smell the coffee. It is time for the Government and its party members to realise that if they vote for this, they should not expect members of credit unions to vote for them."

What is factual is that if this goes is ahead in the form in which it has been presented, the future viability of credit unions is at risk. It goes without saying we all acknowledge, compliment, thank and congratulate the credit union movement throughout the country for the work, help and assistance it gives to communities, to such an extent that up to 70% of the population are members of credit unions. In my county, there are 35,000 members in Tullamore, 9,000 in Clara and up to 50,000 or 60,000 throughout the county. Credit unions are integral and vital parts of communities. We know banks are withdrawing services throughout the country. We heard Deputy Mulherin speak about the difference between the atmosphere in a credit union office and that in a bank office. We see interaction, vitality and engagement in a credit union office, while we see staff in banks introducing customers to machines. Earlier this year, Ferbane in my county lost Ulster Bank, which was the last bank in town. I heard Deputy Heydon from Kildare speak about the vacuum being created by the loss of the credit union in Newbridge over the past two years. He should inform his colleagues because they will face the same vacuum in their communities in the coming years if what is proposed in CP88 is signed by the Minister. Over the past four years, we have seen the Government stand idly by as post offices went to the wall. We have seen Garda stations closed and social welfare offices withdrawn from communities. All of this is in addition to the threat that exists that the loss of credit unions will take away whatever bit of vitality could be perceived and held in communities. We have seen no effort to address the deficit that exists in many towns and villages and no overhaul of commercial rates or dedicated plans for towns and villages. Like many of his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, recognises the value of credit unions. He spoke of the Government's amendment to the motion, which would have us believe it addresses the concerns and fears being reiterated by members throughout the country. He accepts, of course, the commission's findings in their entirety and the independence of the registrar, but does he, and it appears that he does, accept the selective implementation of the registrar's various recommendations on this document as it is at present? He forgets, and does not acknowledge, the omission of other recommendations which might assist credit unions in helping and assisting small and medium-sized enterprises, and which may help with mortgage lending and go beyond the restrictive 10% cap being put on mortgages for more than 25 years. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, also stated there is provision in the amendment, and I also heard this in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, for the Government to explore the possibility of an input from the credit union movement with regard to the social housing dilemma we have. What exploration is required, when a credit union has the capacity to make available through a central fund, similar to the Canadian model, funding to local communities and local authorities to build houses in their area? Yesterday, I was at a meeting at which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government spoke about the Estimates and looking back at the spend this year. This time last year, it made a commitment with regard to a €4 billion investment over five years, whereby there would be 7,500 new homes throughout the country this year, 4,000 of which would be new builds. The number that was built was 200, which is five per local authority. My county must have been the exception because it got eight, although this was over the past four years. The credit union movement has at its disposal investment capacity in this sector for local authorities and even a return of 2% would be far in excess of what is being received in the banks at present. Members of the Government parties should not give us the platitudes we have heard. I will be honest, and I do not like saying this, but I am a bit worried about some of the condescending tones I heard from some of the speakers on the other side of the House. The credit union movement is professional and forward thinking, which is well capable - and more than capable as has been said by some speakers - of meeting the demands of the economy as we know them. It is much more capable when it is compared to the way in which the banks conducted their business. I heard Deputy Nolan of the Labour Party state yesterday that the debate will have very little effect. Regardless of the vote, he called for more engagement. This sentiment personifies in my mind and for my party the lack of appreciation of the ramifications of this Administration's governance. There must be political consequences. I have met representatives of credit unions over the past number of months, including a senior delegation from the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, last week, and I spoke to people in the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, as well. It became quite apparent to me that this had to get political, as members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, as the Government, need to accept and face the consequences of their actions. For example, when our party put in place a four-year programme to close the gap between income and expenditure, it suffered the political consequences, despite the fact that the current Government continued along that path and closed the gap by the final third necessary. That was to the Government parties' benefit but, more importantly, it was to the country's benefit. We suffered the political consequences of putting that in place, rightly or wrongly. We accepted the decision of the Irish people of putting those opposite into government and taking it from there. The last Government capitalised Irish banks; the Irish people capitalised them. This Government told us after the June 2012 summit that there would be retrospective bank recapitalisation, as there should have been, but we doubted it was the game changer that the Government argued it was. It was a footnote at the bottom of the agreement. Instead, we have seen higher mortgage interest rates, 2% above the European average, with a bank veto on solutions proposed by customers, mass evictions, no social dividend from NAMA and €8 billion of credit union soft deposits sitting in banks ever since. Is it not gas to think that, having been saved by the Irish people, banks are now propped up by the credit unions with €8 billion of investment?

This Government told us after the June 2012 summit that there would be retrospective bank recapitalisation, as there should have been, but we doubted it was the game changer that the Government argued it was. It was a footnote at the bottom of the agreement. Instead, we have seen higher mortgage interest rates, 2% above the European average, with a bank veto on solutions proposed by customers, mass evictions, no social dividend from NAMA and €8 billion of credit union soft deposits sitting in banks ever since. Is it not gas to think that, having been saved by the Irish people, banks are now propped up by the credit unions with €8 billion of investment? The same credit unions are barred from competing in the way they can and should in the market. It is time for the members of Fine Gael to face up to the political consequences of their actions. It is time for those party members to realise the power in the hands of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with respect to the ramifications of what they sign and when they sign it. Many have spoken of how, earlier today, representatives of the ILCU, CUDA and the Credit Union Managers' Association came before the finance committee. There was all-party agreement, on the suggestion of Deputy Michael McGrath, that the committee should meet the registrar, and a date has been fixed for 16 December. The committee has written to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, asking him to withdraw or withhold his intention to sign CP88 at least until that meeting takes place. He claims he has passed on the concerns about the perceived implications of what is contained within it to the registrar in recent weeks, following his meeting with representatives of those bodies on 12 November. Yet, all of a sudden, he has agreed to meet representatives of the credit unions again tomorrow. That comes after hearing what we have said and what members have said throughout the country, and with Members from his party and the Labour Party reminding him of the issue. In the likes of Offaly there are 50,000 or 60,000 credit union members and - make no mistake about it - my colleagues and I will remind each and every one about the ramifications and political consequences arising from the Government's actions if it goes ahead with this. As I said earlier, it is hiding behind necessary rectifications and controls in the way financial institutions have to be monitored. I accept that. There was scaremongering from the Minister for Finance with regard to credit unions; it was not from a consultant, as Deputy Rabbitte argued. The Minister for Finance for this State said it would take up to €1 billion to rectify the harm that might exist in credit unions, but it took only €40 million. The Government thinks it can hide behind regulators and registrars while saying it accepts all that is contained in the commission's recommendations. It will stand idly by when the registrar selectively chooses from those recommendations and puts that under the nose of the Minister for Finance. At this eleventh hour, he still thinks there are ""perceived"" ramifications, but there is nothing perceived about our putting a second motion before this House. It is time to wake up and smell the coffee. It is time for the Government and its party members to realise that if they vote for this, they should not expect members of credit unions to vote for them."
19190	SeanSherlock	Labour	15694.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-11-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	558	" There is nothing to be perceived about the implications for the credit union movement. What is factual is that if this goes is ahead in the form in which it has been presented, the future viability of credit unions is at risk. It goes without saying we all acknowledge, compliment, thank and congratulate the credit union movement throughout the country for the work, help and assistance it gives to communities, to such an extent that up to 70% of the population are members of credit unions. In my county, there are 35,000 members in Tullamore, 9,000 in Clara and up to 50,000 or 60,000 throughout the county. Credit unions are integral and vital parts of communities. We know banks are withdrawing services throughout the country. We heard Deputy Mulherin speak about the difference between the atmosphere in a credit union office and that in a bank office. We see interaction, vitality and engagement in a credit union office, while we see staff in banks introducing customers to machines. Earlier this year, Ferbane in my county lost Ulster Bank, which was the last bank in town. I heard Deputy Heydon from Kildare speak about the vacuum being created by the loss of the credit union in Newbridge over the past two years. He should inform his colleagues because they will face the same vacuum in their communities in the coming years if what is proposed in CP88 is signed by the Minister. Over the past four years, we have seen the Government stand idly by as post offices went to the wall. We have seen Garda stations closed and social welfare offices withdrawn from communities. All of this is in addition to the threat that exists that the loss of credit unions will take away whatever bit of vitality could be perceived and held in communities. We have seen no effort to address the deficit that exists in many towns and villages and no overhaul of commercial rates or dedicated plans for towns and villages. Like many of his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, recognises the value of credit unions. He spoke of the Government's amendment to the motion, which would have us believe it addresses the concerns and fears being reiterated by members throughout the country. He accepts, of course, the commission's findings in their entirety and the independence of the registrar, but does he, and it appears that he does, accept the selective implementation of the registrar's various recommendations on this document as it is at present? He forgets, and does not acknowledge, the omission of other recommendations which might assist credit unions in helping and assisting small and medium-sized enterprises, and which may help with mortgage lending and go beyond the restrictive 10% cap being put on mortgages for more than 25 years. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, also stated there is provision in the amendment, and I also heard this in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, for the Government to explore the possibility of an input from the credit union movement with regard to the social housing dilemma we have. What exploration is required, when a credit union has the capacity to make available through a central fund, similar to the Canadian model, funding to local communities and local authorities to build houses in their area? Yesterday, I was at a meeting at which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government spoke about the Estimates and looking back at the spend this year. This time last year, it made a commitment with regard to a €4 billion investment over five years, whereby there would be 7,500 new homes throughout the country this year, 4,000 of which would be new builds. The number that was built was 200, which is five per local authority. My county must have been the exception because it got eight, although this was over the past four years. The credit union movement has at its disposal investment capacity in this sector for local authorities and even a return of 2% would be far in excess of what is being received in the banks at present. Members of the Government parties should not give us the platitudes we have heard. I will be honest, and I do not like saying this, but I am a bit worried about some of the condescending tones I heard from some of the speakers on the other side of the House. The credit union movement is professional and forward thinking, which is well capable - and more than capable as has been said by some speakers - of meeting the demands of the economy as we know them. It is much more capable when it is compared to the way in which the banks conducted their business. I heard Deputy Nolan of the Labour Party state yesterday that the debate will have very little effect. Regardless of the vote, he called for more engagement. This sentiment personifies in my mind and for my party the lack of appreciation of the ramifications of this Administration's governance. There must be political consequences. I have met representatives of credit unions over the past number of months, including a senior delegation from the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, last week, and I spoke to people in the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, as well. It became quite apparent to me that this had to get political, as members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, as the Government, need to accept and face the consequences of their actions. For example, when our party put in place a four-year programme to close the gap between income and expenditure, it suffered the political consequences, despite the fact that the current Government continued along that path and closed the gap by the final third necessary. That was to the Government parties' benefit but, more importantly, it was to the country's benefit. We suffered the political consequences of putting that in place, rightly or wrongly. We accepted the decision of the Irish people of putting those opposite into government and taking it from there. The last Government capitalised Irish banks; the Irish people capitalised them. This Government told us after the June 2012 summit that there would be retrospective bank recapitalisation, as there should have been, but we doubted it was the game changer that the Government argued it was. It was a footnote at the bottom of the agreement. Instead, we have seen higher mortgage interest rates, 2% above the European average, with a bank veto on solutions proposed by customers, mass evictions, no social dividend from NAMA and €8 billion of credit union soft deposits sitting in banks ever since.

19199	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	 I thank the Deputy for the question. The current El Niño weather event is one of the strongest ever measured. More unpredictable weather conditions are already having a detrimental effect on people’s lives and livelihoods across Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region. In the next six months humanitarian needs will increase, with severe droughts and flooding. Below normal rainfall and drought conditions have already affected parts of Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea, reducing agricultural production. Excessive rainfall is affecting parts of Ethiopia, Somalia and other countries, causing severe and sustained flooding, loss of livelihoods and disease outbreaks. Irish Aid, the Government’s overseas development assistance programme, is stepping up its preparedness to respond. Our long-term development programme in countries such as Ethiopia includes funding for a large social protection programme for the most vulnerable households. We are also scaling up humanitarian responses to reduce the impact on households and save lives in the worst affected places. In Ethiopia alone in 2015, Ireland has increased its bilateral programme to nearly €28 million in response to the humanitarian crisis. We are providing an additional €1.8 million in humanitarian assistance through non-governmental organisation, NGO, partners. In total, Ireland has provided over €80 million in humanitarian assistance in 2015 and this budget will be increased to over €100 million for 2016. We are allocating additional resources across affected countries to support programmes which save lives, improve food security, protect livelihoods and build the resilience of people to withstand the effects of such a weather event across Africa. We will continue to monitor the position closely and scale up action as El Niño strengthens and conditions on the ground worsen.
19200	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	 Ireland’s bilateral relationship with Ethiopia is very strong. Official Ethiopian Government figures for January 2016 indicate that 10.2 million people will require food assistance, in addition to the 7.9 million receiving food and cash transfers as part of the productive safety nets programme. Ireland is one of the core funders of the programme through Irish Aid and the embassy. We have been doing this since 2005. There are financial resources required to deal with this issue. This is the third largest humanitarian emergency globally, behind those in Syria and Yemen. It is estimated that approximately US$1.8 billion is required to cover the cost of emergency interventions. We will continue to work with multilateral partners such as the UN agencies and on a bilateral basis. We have increased the commitment to Ethiopia because this involves protecting small stakeholder farmers and their families. There are knock-on consequences in terms of in utero development which is having a major effect on malnutrition and under-nutrition. We will continue to monitor the position.
19201	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	 There is due to be a meeting of Development Ministers in January. I am not entirely sure if it was raised in December, but I will check for the Deputy. It is fair to say that in our response to the crisis in Ethiopia we are punching above our weight. Through the bilateral aid programme we have provided €3.8 million to help meet the immediate humanitarian need. I met the President of the Tigray region two weeks ago when he was in Ireland and I have visited the country on several occasions. We see this as a major humanitarian crisis and the Irish response to it is measuring up. We are working hand in hand with Trócaire, Goal and Concern, our NGO partners on the ground. We have provided them with €1.8 million in humanitarian assistance. We continue to monitor and respond as needs arise.

19207	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	 I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who apologises for being unable to attend this afternoon. The Exchequer provides funding supports to the four regional airports in Donegal, Kerry, Waterford and Knock under the regional airports programme operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Over the past decade, Knock has received almost €21 million in Exchequer support in operational and capital grants under the OPEX and CAPEX funding schemes administered by the Department. In August last year, the European Commission gave its approval for the Department's new regional airports programme, which takes account of the recommendations of the Knock study group and the subsequent decision by Government to continue funding supports to the four regional airports. That decision recognised that the regional airports should be given the opportunity beyond 2014 to grow to a viable, self-sustaining position, particularly considering the contribution that they make to their respective regional and local economies. This was also acknowledged in the new national aviation policy that was published last August. The Deputy will be aware that, under new EU state aid guidelines of 2014, the maximum level of aid permissible for capital projects at airports with fewer than 1 million passengers per annum is 75%. The EU guidelines recognise, however, that airports in this category may face difficulties in sourcing the balance of at least 25%. Subject to a case-by-case assessment, an aid rate in excess of 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances. In such a scenario, the Commission has indicated that a business case justifying any proposed higher aid rate would have to be approved by it and must be able to demonstrate the airport's inability to proceed with the proposed investment at the 75% aid rate. Under a new aspect of the regional airports programme called the public policy remit, all of the regional airports, including Knock, are eligible for grant assistance up to 90% towards the cost of capital investments in the areas of safety and security. There is also a PPR scheme which assists with grants of up to 100% of the operational costs of the airports in these two areas. Last year, under the first year of the new programme, Knock received almost €1.2 million in grant supports from the Department and the latter has already begun engaging again with all four airports on their future requirements for capital grant assistance. The Minister is, of course, aware that Knock has indicated that it will require a higher grant rate than the maximum 75% permitted under the EU guidelines for certain major capital projects that are planned at the airport over the coming years. The ongoing engagement with Knock continues to address this issue, as well as the funding available to the airport under the new PPR schemes.
19208	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	 I note the points the Deputy has made. I do not have an answer to that question, but I am sure departmental officials and the Minister's staff are watching proceedings and I am sure the Deputy will approach the Minister directly on this issue. For the purpose of replying, I will reiterate that I do not think it is a case of ruling out the possibility of 90% funding. I do not think that was explicitly stated in the answer I gave. I will read again from the answer: The Minister is, of course, aware that Knock has indicated that it will require a higher grant rate than the maximum 75% permitted under the EU guidelines for certain major capital projects that are planned at the airport over the coming years. The ongoing engagement with Knock continues to address this issue, as well as the funding available to the airport under the new PPR schemes. In my interpretation of the answer, that does not necessarily rule out the possibility of the potential for 90% funding. I do not have a-----
19209	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	373	 I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. I understand that Deputy Dowds has been very proactive on this issue for quite some time and I thank him for raising the matter. I understand that the background to this issue arises from the concerns of local residents living in the immediate area in relation to the use of surrounding residential roads by heavy goods vehicles and their wish to see a 3.5 tonne vehicle weight restriction applied to Kennelsfort Road for traffic management purposes. While I cannot comment on the specifics of any weight restriction currently applying to the Kennelsfort Road, decisions in respect of the application of such weight restrictions are entirely a matter for the relevant local authority. In this instance, and based on the intervention of Deputy Dowds, that would appear to be South Dublin County Council, though my script states it is Dublin City Council. The Minister does not have any role to play in such decisions. However, should South Dublin County Council decide to apply such a weight restriction on Kennelsfort Road, this would be indicated by the use of the appropriate vehicle weight limit sign. The legislative basis underpinning the erection of such regulatory signage is provided for under road traffic legislation with which all local authorities must comply. Also, further details relating to regulatory vehicle weights signage are set out for local authorities in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's 2010 traffic signs manual. The Road Traffic (Signs) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, SI 331 of 2012, and the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2012, SI 332 of 2012, provide the legislative basis for weight restrictions on vehicles entering a road and associated signage. Relevant signage in this regard includes regulatory upright sign RUS 015, which is used in traffic management and road safety issues such as prohibiting heavy vehicles from using residential roads, and RUS 053, which is used in cases of entry restrictions relating to the structural integrity of the road network, including bridges. Sign RUS 015, giving maximum design gross vehicle weight, is used at the entrance of a road and provides that drivers of vehicles whose design gross vehicle weight exceeds the weight specified on the sign are prohibited from proceeding beyond that point except where it is necessary for a vehicle to gain access to, or egress from, premises accessible only from that road. RUS 053 indicates that the driver of a vehicle exceeding the design gross vehicle weight displayed on the sign shall not proceed beyond it. There are no exceptions to this regulation. The entry restrictions associated with traffic signs RUS 015 and RUS 053 apply to all vehicles, including buses, which exceed the design gross vehicle weight specified on either sign. Any decision by a local authority to apply such restrictions would have to take account of whether the road in question is used as part of a bus route. In conclusion, individual local authorities are best placed to assess the particular local vehicle weight requirements, based on either road safety or traffic management grounds, which should apply to a particular individual road. However, as previously mentioned, if such weight limit controls are applied, local authorities must erect signage that is in full compliance with regulations. The enforcement of road traffic regulations governing vehicle weight limits on any particular public road is a matter for An Garda Síochána.
19210	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	 How do I respond with a negative after that? The Deputy has raised some questions which are on the record of the House. I will endeavour to speak directly to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about the specific questions posed. I hope officials in the Minister's Department are listening to this and that they will reply directly to the Deputy. However, I assure the Deputy that I will raise this directly with the Minister, who is currently in the Seanad dealing with the Road Traffic Bill. I acknowledge the great work of Deputy Dowds and the fastidious and meticulous way in which he has always dealt with issues relating to his constituents. We all hope we will be back in the House. Deputy Dowds has made an outstanding contribution to this House and to the Parliamentary Labour Party. We wish him the best on his next path in life, whatever pathway that is.
19211	SeanSherlock	Labour	15756.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	 I have already said this. I have examined the situation around the country and was shocked by what I found. What I am saying is nothing new. There has been a 60% increase in Waterford, where up to 504 people are homeless. Last week I made the point on radio and television stations that 37 people came to my office between Monday and Wednesday the week before last and 17 were homeless. We analysed their situation. I would not overly criticise the Minister. He has compassion and does not want people to be homeless. The situation in Waterford is replicated around the country. A mother with one child receives a payment of €475. One could not rent an apartment in Waterford for €475, never mind a two-bedroom house. More and more single mothers are becoming homeless, something that has been acknowledged by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Samaritans and other groups, because they do not have the money to pay for rental accommodation. There is an argument that if one increases rent allowance everything else will go up in price. The amount of money people are given is not sustainable, based on the fact that houses cannot be supplied immediately for them. They have no choice but to go into rental accommodation. We have to make rental accommodation affordable or increase payments under the HAP scheme. I know the situation is difficult and there is no easy fix, but we have to decide on doing one or the other. A significant majority of the current homeless population are single mothers. They receive a payment of €475 and may have to wait for a deposit. One should try to rent a two-bedroom house or apartment anywhere in the country for €475. It is just not happening.

More and more single mothers are becoming homeless, something that has been acknowledged by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Samaritans and other groups, because they do not have the money to pay for rental accommodation. There is an argument that if one increases rent allowance everything else will go up in price. The amount of money people are given is not sustainable, based on the fact that houses cannot be supplied immediately for them. They have no choice but to go into rental accommodation. We have to make rental accommodation affordable or increase payments under the HAP scheme. I know the situation is difficult and there is no easy fix, but we have to decide on doing one or the other. A significant majority of the current homeless population are single mothers. They receive a payment of €475 and may have to wait for a deposit. One should try to rent a two-bedroom house or apartment anywhere in the country for €475. It is just not happening.

I have examined the situation around the country and was shocked by what I found. What I am saying is nothing new. There has been a 60% increase in Waterford, where up to 504 people are homeless.

It has been reassuring to hear the general consensus across the House on this important strategic issue for Ireland. Although the outcome of this referendum is for the people of the United Kingdom to decide, today's debate has shown how the decision they make will have a profound effect on Ireland, both North and South. As Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for North-South co-operation, I am conscious of the importance of cross-Border economic and social co-operation and how this has benefited the island as a whole. This co-operation is facilitated and enhanced by both the UK and Ireland being members of the European Union. North-South bodies like Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland demonstrate what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas and they are making a considerable contribution towards the recent return to economic growth across the island. North-South co-operation also brings real day-to-day benefits to people on both sides of the Border. I know from my own experience as Minister of State with responsibility for research that research and development, one of the important drivers of economic growth and employment, is a key focus for North-South co-operation. It is important that we continue to encourage and support this valuable area for EU supports under Horizon 2020, where there has been steady progress towards meeting the €175 million target for specific North-South projects. In terms of projects directly supported by the EU, the upgrade to the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise rail service has recently been completed with clear benefits for enhancing people-to-people connectivity between both parts of the island. As we have heard today, we cannot be certain that nothing will change with the Border if the UK votes to leave the EU. While every effort would be made to minimise any impact in this scenario, any change to Border arrangements has the potential to impact on this type of co-operation. As has been stated earlier, the UK is Ireland's largest trading partner. Trade between Ireland and the UK runs at €1.2 billion per week or €62 billion per annum, with a broad mix of goods and services. Also, according to a Teagasc report, Brexit: Implications for the Agri-food Sector, published earlier this week, our food industry represents about one third of Ireland's total merchandise exports to the UK, leaving this industry particularly concerned about a UK exit from the European Union. This is not the only industry that has concerns. Successive studies have shown that a UK departure from the EU will have an adverse impact across the economy, both in the UK and in Ireland. We have already heard today that the British Treasury stated earlier this week that the UK economy will be ""permanently poorer"" in any scenario where it leaves the EU. Anything that negatively impacts on the level of trade between our two countries is not to be welcomed. While this decision is for the people of the United Kingdom, there is no doubt that a vote to leave would have a significant impact on us here in Ireland. The position of the Irish Government is clear: we want the UK to remain part of the EU for three main reasons, namely, the clear economic business case which favours the maintenance of the status quo; our shared interest in sustaining stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland; and the need to retain the UK as an important ally in the EU. The third point has been acknowledged by Members across this House today during this debate. Entirely understandably, a focus of many interventions in this debate has been on Ireland's preparedness for the possibility of a UK decision to leave the EU. Government colleagues have spoken on this issue throughout the day, but I believe it is useful to set out our approach. If the vote is to leave the EU, a period of two years is provided for under the EU treaties, during which the UK's exit terms would be negotiated. Although negotiations could well take significantly longer, any extension would need to be agreed unanimously by the remaining 27 EU member states. Ireland will, of course, play its fullest part in such negotiations. The Irish Government will continue to plan for any contingencies so that we are prepared to deal with the potential consequences in the event of a UK vote to leave. An eventual agreement between the UK and the EU, as well as anything possible to be agreed between ourselves and the UK, using the bilateral structures the Taoiseach outlined at the outset of this debate, would determine an overall framework and set out the arrangements across many sectors. We hope that on 24 June, we will be welcoming a vote to remain. If this is not the choice of the UK electorate, then we will be as prepared as possible across all of Government to manage the consequences and deal with the uncertainties that arise. Whatever the outcome, we will maintain strong, positive and productive relationships with both the EU, of which we will remain a member state as well as remaining in the euro, and with the UK. Nine weeks remain to polling day. I urge all of those with family and friends living in the UK to encourage them to register to vote, to remind them of the unique perspective Ireland has on this debate, and to ask them to cast their vote on 23 June, when voter turnout may be the deciding factor in this hugely important referendum."

19220	SeanSherlock	Labour	15848.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	201	 I was not expecting to get the opportunity to speak so I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle has fitted me in. We have all spoken about Irish Water in the House today and have all highlighted the concerns and issues relating to it. Deputies present are very familiar with my constituency, the Acting Chairman and I represent it. They will also be aware of the same concerns relating to the establishment of Irish Water, the way it was done and whether there was a need for it. Most people accept that it was unnecessary at the time and that local authorities were doing a good job and providing the service. The one resource that they have been missing over the last number of years by successive Governments is, perhaps, funding. There are different reasons for this, be they economic or whatever they were at the time, but local authorities in general, whether water or waste water management, did a good job, delivered the services and improved the infrastructure. As we all know, if there is an issue with a person's water service or waste water service and he or she rings Irish Water, it rings the local authorities. They employ the same staff who were there before Irish Water was set up to go out, assess the problem and contact Irish Water about the issue. Irish Water then issues them a purchase order or order number to go out and carry out the work. This is a completely inefficient way of doing business because another completely unnecessary layer of bureaucracy is being introduced. The local authority staff, who had the local expertise, carried out the work to a high standard and delivered an excellent service all across my constituency and the country generally, are still doing the work, but they are now doing it under a new management regime of Irish Water. Everyone would accept that this is unnecessary, and it is done with an extra capital cost that was not needed previously for the staff. Indeed, we now learn that they are subsidised somewhere in the region of €250,000,000 per annum out of our motor tax money. That money should be going into upgrading the infrastructure that we all need for roads, commuting and opening up other ways for industry around the country, where it would be much better spent rather than spent subsidising an agency that is not required at this time or at any stage. I am not in favour of having water charges currently or at any stage. They need to be suspended. We also need to look at a waiver system, which should have been considered and implemented for those who cannot afford to pay. There are many people, whom we all meet at our clinics every week and whom we have met canvassing, who simply cannot afford to pay.
19221	SeanSherlock	Labour	15849.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-04-28 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	50	 In the short time available to me I propose to outline the response of the Government, through Irish Aid, to the crisis in Syria. I am pleased to have had the privilege of leading Irish Aid's response in the past two years, as Minister of State with responsibility for development and trade. Next month the first ever world humanitarian summit will be held in Istanbul. It was called by the United Nations Secretary General. The summit's host country, Turkey, has also become host to the world's largest refugee population in the past five years, with more than 2.7 million Syrian refugees living in the country. As the refugee crisis has unfolded in the Middle East, the Government has been responding, on behalf of the Irish people, through Irish Aid. By the end of the year, we will have provided €62 million for the Syrian crisis alone. We have made specific efforts in support of our European partners, in particular, Greece and the Balkans. We provide core support for the Red Cross and the UN High Commission for Refugees which have been particularly active in meeting the immediate needs of refugees in Europe. Since the start of 2015 Irish Aid has provided €180,000 specifically to support the work of non-governmental organisation, NGO, partners in Macedonia alone. Under Ireland's rapid response initiative, we have also deployed two rapid responders to Serbia and Macedonia and a further two to Greece. A further deployment next week will support the UNHCR's provision of water and sanitation services for refugees there. Those arriving in Europe start their journey in many places. In the past decade most migrants arrived from sub-Saharan and north Africa. However, the Syrian conflict has dramatically changed the profile of migrant flows and Syrians are now the largest group arriving in Europe, accounting for almost half of those arriving in Greece last year. Last month marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the brutal Syrian conflict which the United Nations estimates has caused up to 400,000 deaths. The continued violence and war crimes which have forced millions of Syrians to flee their homes and country must end and those responsible must be held accountable. To echo the point made by Deputy Brendan Smith, Ireland firmly believes the UN Security Council should refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Ireland urges all sides in the Geneva negotiations to support a political resolution of the conflict and the formation of a representative transitional government. While a political solution is desperately needed, sadly, it is not clear that one will be achieved soon. Needs are rising to the point at which the global humanitarian response cannot keep up with them. Ireland has been providing assistance for Syrians since 2012 and this aid has been scaled up as the impact of the conflict has worsened. More than 4.8 million people have already had to leave Syria. In 2015 Ireland provided more than €13 million in assistance for the country. In February, at the London pledging conference on Syria, I committed Ireland to providing a further €20 million in 2016. Irish Aid funding is supporting Irish non-governmental organisations, including Concern, GOAL and Trócaire, in their work with refugees in Syria and the surrounding region. The statistics for the numbers affected by the Syria crisis and the amount of funding needed to meet their needs are so staggering that the human stories behind the numbers are often forgotten. Previous speakers articulated details of individual cases. Last October I visited the refugee camp in Azraq, Jordan. In one of the shelters I met a mother who had given birth to her third child at a border post without medical assistance. She and her children subsequently presented to a Red Cross hospital in the UN camp in Azraq. When one considers that the average displacement period of refugee children is 17 years, one wonders what the future holds for her child. How will they grow up? If the family left a neighbourhood in Syria where schools have been bombed before presenting in highly traumatic circumstances to a refugee camp in a place such as Azraq, how will the children fulfil their destiny, if one wills, if they have been traumatised to such an extent that they cannot present to the local school in the refugee camp? We are leaving a whole generation behind. Irish people are doing what they can in our external response through the aid agencies and multilateral organisations. We are ensuring daily, whether through diplomatic channels or the work we do with individual aid agencies, that we influence the work being done on the ground in order that the people we are trying to help can at least have some semblance of hope for the future. The global humanitarian crisis has resulted in the displacement of at least 56 million people who will need humanitarian assistance. The countries affected include Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and northern Nigeria. These conflicts may not yet have pricked the consciousness of many Irish people, but the world humanitarian summit presents us with an opportunity. I am hopeful the next Taoiseach, whoever he may be, and the President will attend to give voice to Ireland's position on the need for global leadership to prevent and end conflicts of this nature. The majority of global crises are protracted and last over a decade or more. I hope we can continue as a nation to play our role and hope that in the new politics of this House, we can find mechanisms through the committees to enable us come together and form a common bond regarding how this Parliament, as representative of the people, can best represent how taxpayers invest their hard-earned money in meeting the needs of the people we have been speaking for here today. We have an opportunity to continue in that vein. I will finish with the words of W.H. Auden. Today is poetry day Ireland and these words are from Auden's poem Refugee Blues: Once we had a country and we thought it fair, Look in the atlas and you'll find it there: We cannot go there now, my dear, we cannot go there now. In the village churchyard there grows an old yew, Every spring it blossoms anew: Old passports can't do that, my dear, old passports can't do that.
19222	SeanSherlock	Labour	15849.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-04-28 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	50	 On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Government, I thank Deputies from all sides of this House for the wide range of contributions that have been made throughout this debate. The level of engagement from all sides recognises that this is an issue on which there is cross-party concern and one, I hope, on which we can generate cross-party consensus in terms of how this country, the EU and the international community must respond to the humanitarian refugee crisis. That is what it is: a humanitarian crisis. I agree with those who call it that. I echo the point made by many that we are well-served by the fact that this House, traditionally and right through to this Thirty-second Dáil, has always been one which has agreed and responded positively to requests for solidarity and action in assisting refugees seeking protection within the EU. I was struck by the number of my constituents contacting my office by telephone and e-mail asking that more be done, that this country must do more and that they want Ireland to play its part in supporting refugees in their relocation efforts. That is a message we have all received in this House. It is one that we have to hear very clearly. Our citizens want Ireland to be to the fore in pushing for solutions to this humanitarian crisis. I was moved by Deputy Brady's reference to the poem Home by Warsan Shire which I just looked up. I think it puts words to the very serious humanitarian crisis which can be all too often dehumanised in the media and in politics. These are real people. Nobody puts their child on a boat or into an awful situation should they not feel the absolute necessity to do so for the safety and well-being of their family. In response to Deputy McGrath's point, I too am very proud, as I presume all Members of this House are and as many have expressed, of the role being played by the Irish Navy. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, confirmed earlier today in this House that the Navy will continue to make that effort and that there will be a further deployment this Sunday regarding members of the Naval Service. Their continued assistance and involvement is something we all welcome. I refer to the point made by Deputy McGrath and others about the importance of Ireland in helping the resettlement and relocation of the 4,000 people that we have committed to. That commitment still stands from this Government and this State. The difficulties of the low numbers to date arise from external issues. The target of 4,000 people is still very much the commitment of the State. It is a number that could increase when family unification is taken on board. Ireland continues, and will continue, to play its part at an EU level to implement agreed solutions to this refugee crisis. We will continue to ensure that all measures taken are in full respect of human dignity and in line with our EU and international obligations. At home, we must ensure that Ireland remains a welcoming and inclusive society for those in need of our protection. This House has a role to play in fostering public debate which supports the humane and respectful treatment of asylum seekers and persons fleeing war and persecution. That has always been our tradition here. Our response to persons seeking protection does not end once they reach our shores, however. Persons arriving under the relocation and resettlement programmes are being given all necessary support to assist them and their families in their integration into Irish society, including the schooling of children, language classes for adults, full health checks, emergency welfare payments, full board and accommodation. Some of those arriving have experienced significant trauma and they are receiving all appropriate supports. It is clear, however, that our asylum system is in need of reform. That is a point that has been raised throughout this debate. This Government has introduced reforming legislation. Last December, the House debated and passed the International Protection Bill. The International Protection Act will reform the system for examining and determining applications for international protection in Ireland through the introduction of a single application procedure. Under the single procedure, an applicant will make only one application and will have all grounds to seek international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State while being examined and determined in one process. This single procedure will replace the current multi-layered and sequential protection application and appeal system and is intended to achieve the desired balance in treating asylum seekers with the humanity and respect they deserve, whilst also ensuring that we have a more efficient asylum and immigration procedure and safeguards in place. Many of the Deputies raised the issue of direct provision. The report of the working group which was published by Government last June made a total of 173 recommendations. Many of these have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. The Department of Justice and Equality recently completed a consultation exercise on the status of the recommendations across all the responsible divisions, Departments and agencies. The exercise has shown that 90 of the recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 26 are in the process of being implemented. Some 116 recommendations have been progressed since the report's publication in June 2014 and a further 46 recommendations are the subject of ongoing consideration by the Cabinet committee on social policy. This represents yet another need to form a Government so that we can progress these further. I believe it is important that we continue to pursue this issue and that we do not simply have a one-off debate. This is something that is going to require work from all Members of the Thirty-second Dáil and I hope it is something on which we can continue to build political consensus.

Níl mo chuid Gaeilge ró-mhaith, ach táim ag cleachtadh. I mBunreacht na hÉireann aithnítear an Ghaeilge már ár dteanga phríomha sa Stát. Samhlaítear dúinn go bhfuil dualgas mór ar gach Rialtas acmhainní a chur ar fáil agus tionscnaimh a chur in áit chun an teanga a chosaint agus í a fhorbairt go hiomlán. The Labour Party recognises the central place of the Irish language in our heritage, our history and as a rich resource for daily life. The Constitution explicitly recognises Irish as the first language of the State and it is our view that this places certain responsibilities on all governments to vigorously support the protection and development of the language. I want to take a slightly different tack today. I speak through the medium of English. I feel strongly that Irish is often presented in a binary fashion, typified by those who have the language and those who do not. The last census recorded more than 160 languages being spoken in this country and we have a multiplicity of nationalities here now. I believe that in the globalised society we live in, we must recognise the attempts by those who are seeking to encourage bilingualism and multilingualism within this island. It is not about one language being better than another but about using languages efficiently. It is also about seeking to encourage greater awareness of the critical importance of language learning, not only in terms of increasing employment possibilities and meeting industry needs, but also its broader value in the spheres of education, the arts and in the context of supporting social cohesion and intercultural understanding. In that context, Irish has a significant role to play in terms of encouraging multilingualism and bilingualism. A group called One Voice for Languages focuses on the importance of all languages, including Irish, being valued in a real sense and beyond the tokenism that often inculcates debate in this House and elsewhere. This group focuses on three basic statements. Mar a chreidimid: Tá teangacha luachmhar, riachtanach agus spreagúil. What we believe: Languages are essential, valuable and exciting. A bhfuil uainn: Ceisteanna teanga a ardú ag an leibhéal is airde rialtais agus a chur ar a shúile do phobal uile na tíre. What we want: Language issues to be raised at the highest levels of government and to be brought to the consciousness of the country as a whole. Mar a dhéanfaimid: Gníomhú mar ghlór cumhachtach agus mar shlógadh dóibh siúd go léir ar spéis leo ceisteanna teanga. What we will do: Act as a rallying point and a powerful voice for all interested in language issues. Globalisation has changed our experience of language diversity. There are now few places in the world in which multiple languages are not present and in which people do not make use of repertoires that draw on several different languages. As a former Minister with responsibility for research and innovation, I have found there is ample research evidence regarding the numerous benefits of language learning. For example, in the Irish context research has demonstrated that bilingualism in Irish and English enhances mathematics performance and that the Irish language lends itself to the better understanding of mathematical concepts. There have been repeated statements from high-level industry leaders, employment specialists, advisory bodies and experienced linguists on the deficit in appropriate language skills and the important role the learning of other languages, of which Irish is one, can play in the improvement of literacy levels. An appreciation needs to be fostered, at Government level and among the wider public, on the significant cognitive, social, developmental, cultural and linguistic enhancement that can be attained through the learning of Irish or other additional languages. We need to improve the teaching and learning of science, mathematics and engineering and research shows that where students are educated through the medium of Irish, and where they live in bilingual communities, their learning outcomes are a lot better. We should focus more on those opportunities. I speak for thousands of people throughout this country when I say I do not know if I will ever be fluent but I would love to be able to conduct my everyday business in a bilingual way. Perhaps we need to focus more on the opportunities therein. I am glad I live in an area where, over the past five years, there has been an explosion in the number of places in Gaelscoileanna and there are two Gaelscoileanna under construction in my constituency, in Mainistir Fhear Maí and Mainistir na Corann. We are very proud of that and we want to ensure that there is a continuum between what students learn at primary level and what they learn at post-primary level. We need to do more to encourage people in communities like Mallow, Fermoy and Midleton, where we have these Gaelscoileanna, to use the language in their everyday transactions on the street or through interactions with Government agencies. We need to widen the debate and recognise that there are over 160 languages spoken in this country. We need to ensure we target resources in a way that ensures that more people speak the language or, at least, are inculcated with the language during everyday usage, and this is a big challenge. We are all wedded to the 20-year strategy and if we witness economic growth we need to ensure the resources are made available so that the plan bears fruit. Every time there is a debate on the Irish language somebody gets up and says somebody has such an amount of proficiency and somebody else does not. Let us get away from that binary, hackneyed debate and broaden it out so that we can get more people actually speaking Irish. Let us encourage people to speak the language more and if we broaden the debate we can also encourage the use of bilingualism in everyday life. That is a very reasonable proposition.
19224	SeanSherlock	Labour	15869.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-18 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	301	 In the spirit of this new dispensation and new politics, the Labour Party intends to support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage.
19225	SeanSherlock	Labour	15869.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-18 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	" We believe the Oireachtas, through its committees, has the requisite capacity to interrogate the three flaws, as articulated by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, namely the constitutionality of the Bill, the need to consult the ECB before the intended Bill could be enacted and the statements by the Governor of the Central Bank that it does not wish to regulate interest rates. If it is the will of the House that this Bill be considered under pre-legislative scrutiny, then so be it. However, we see no reason that is necessary. Notwithstanding the consumer protection regulation Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, which ensures access to the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and ensures the protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, there is still a number of borrowers who signed up for variable interest rates at the top of the market who feel a legitimate grievance and feel left behind. Section 5 of the Bill, which deals with the issuance of a direction by the Central Bank to a specific lender or lenders, deserves further scrutiny. The issue of contract law looms large over the section but we believe that this is something that can be examined further at the next Stage of the Bill. We recognise that banks have to make a profit but there is a fine line between making a profit and profiteering. A person in my constituency of Cork East took out a mortgage in 2009 with Permanent TSB. Since 2009, that person has been paid interest, in one specific period, at rates of up to 6.5%. The borrower estimates that over the lifetime of the mortgage he could end up paying an additional €100,000 in interest payments alone and what grieves that person is the fact that mortgage products that are offered now on a similar property of similar value are significantly cheaper. He recognises that he signed a contract, and he recognises that banks must make a profit but with some justification he feels that having to pay up to €100,000 more than his neighbour for the same amount of money borrowed, albeit from a different bank, is unfair. On Committee Stage my party intends to examine more closely the issue of marginal interest. The question of profitability versus profiteering could be addressed, for instance, through the capping of variable interest rates such that, for instance, if the ECB sets a rate at 2.5%, a margin could be determined, for instance, two percentage points in excess of that, which would allow for a degree of profitability and competition without profiteering in that banks could compete within the two percentage points margin. We want to explore that at a further Stage or at least have a proper discussion in a collegiate way around that. I accept it is interventionist within the market but my party considers it is worthy of further examination. We have some questions on section 2, on the assessments. It is difficult to understand how the Central Bank, subject to the 11 ""factors"" outlined in the assessment in the Bill, could reasonably conclude that a market failure exists. Section 4(2) states that """"market failure"" shall mean a situation in which market conditions are such that a lender is, or lenders are, charging a variable interest rate or variable interest rates for principal dwelling house mortgage loans which are higher than the Central Bank considers can be reasonably and objectively justified by reference to the factors set out in section 3."" The question is, how can the Central Bank, even when the 11 factors are taken into account in section 3, reasonably intervene to make a direction in an individual or collective case if those individuals have, in the first instance, signed a contract with a mortgage provider, and the question then arises, does the law of contract supersede the enactment of this Bill or does this Bill give powers to the Central Bank that may be subservient to the law of contract. My party has an open mind in terms of exploring those questions at the next Stage and while we may differ from Deputy Paul Murphy in regard to the recognition that banks must make a profit, we have to distinguish between making a profit and profiteering. In the spirit of the new paradigm, in this current enlightenment period, which I hope will last, we will explore the Bill further. We believe that there is not necessarily a need for pre-legislative scrutiny because we all have the wherewithal within this House to be able to interrogate the Bill further and if we need to bring in experts to address any of the issues or the questions that may be outstanding then in the spirit of the new dispensation in which we find ourselves we should take a pragmatic view on this Bill and allow it to proceed to the next Stage and discuss these matters further."
19226	SeanSherlock	Labour	15869.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-18 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	185	 I thank Deputy Lawless for his kind words and I wish to reciprocate them. I hope he has a long and happy period in this House. As he has been a constituent of mine, I would also say that, while I have never been a constituent of his, most of my family came from Kildare and there are many constituents left there who may or may not be able to do him a favour in the future. I am not sure I can do a great deal for him today, but I can certainly give him a reply to the question he has put. The new programme for Government includes a commitment to invest €3.6 billion across the lifetime of the capital plan for the period 2016 to 2022 in order to enable a number of major transport projects to proceed and to fund additional capacity to meet existing and future commuter needs. The capital plan provides for the commencement of a multi-phase DART expansion programme, as recommended under the, National Transport Authority's recently published Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. The wider DART expansion programme, which incorporates the DART underground project, is envisaged under the NTA's greater Dublin area strategy. The programme will see the DART system expanded to Drogheda on the northern line, Celbridge-Hazelhatch on the Kildare line and Maynooth on the Sligo line. The DART underground project, as currently designed, will not proceed. Instead, it will be redesigned to provide for a more cost-effective tunnel, which is the nub of the matter raised by the Deputy. The NTA, the statutory remit of which covers the planning of public transport in the greater Dublin area, was requested in 2014 to review the DART underground project in conjunction with the preparation of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area. In July 2015, and based on the outcome of the updated business case, the NTA recommended that the project, which remains a key element of integrated transport for the greater Dublin area, be redesigned to provide a lower-cost technical solution, while retaining the required rail connectivity. A project of such magnitude - in the order of €3 billion - has to be designed and delivered in a way that ensures value for money for the taxpayer. The overall DART expansion programme has been assessed by the NTA as a positive project from an economic perspective and its advice is that the programme is essential for efficient transport in the greater Dublin area and nationally. The programme has a key role to play in delivering an efficient transport system and key elements of the overall DART expansion programme will be progressed under the capital plan. However, it has been identified that it is possible to redesign the tunnel part of the project to substantially reduce the capital cost involved. The NTA's recommendations that the tunnel element can be delivered at a reduced cost to the taxpayer cannot be ignored. I can confirm that funding has been allocated in the new capital plan to progress redesign and planning for the revised project. The Deputy will also be interested to learn that the Government's capital plan specifically provides for enhanced rail connectivity to the city centre for commuters on the Kildare rail line by upgrading the Phoenix Park tunnel line for passenger services. The project, which is funded by my Department through the NTA, will see commuters on the Kildare to Dublin Heuston line have the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara Street, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock stations. Services on the Kildare commuter line will be a mix of Kildare to Dublin Heuston and Kildare to Grand Canal Dock services, offering new connections to commuters. These services will commence in quarter 4 of 2016. The capital plan provides for investment in transport infrastructure to reduce congestion and cater for future demand. The DART underground remains a key element of the integrated transport strategy but I am anxious to ensure that the most economically advantageous and affordable solution can be identified for the benefit of the taxpayer. In the meantime, other elements of the DART expansion programme will proceed under the current capital plan.

19229	SeanSherlock	Labour	15875.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	 An pholaitíocht nua.
19230	SeanSherlock	Labour	15875.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	" With a few short words, I express the concerns of the people of Cobh, who are currently reading a recent study by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland indicating that the rates of prostate cancer there are 71% higher than the national average, with female breast cancer incidence 38% above the norm. The people of Cobh are very concerned. While he is in the House, I congratulate my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, on his new position. I know he has spoken on this issue and expressed concern about it in the past. I raise this issue because when the National Cancer Registry was asked for a reason that the rates are higher in Cobh, it stated that it could be down to the issue of social deprivation. I do not believe that is a proper answer when asked a question of that nature. We know that Cobh is a town with a history of heavy industry, that there is a remediation programme going on at the moment in an area in which heavy industry is no longer located and that the Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring the pharmaceutical or pharmachem industries in the lower harbour areas. However, we do not have actual clean air monitoring at specific reference points throughout the Cobh area and there is no live reporting to the public. It could be beneficial if a baseline study were instigated for Cobh and a full investigation could be carried out. This could be done without necessarily putting an extra charge on the Exchequer because there is a number of stakeholders, such as GPs and UCC, in particular, which have addressed the strategic policy committee of Cork County Council, that is, the environment committee. The department of chemistry and the environmental research unit have stated that they would be happy to conduct studies in this area. It is an issue that affects every family in Cobh. Professor Colin Bradley, a professor of general practice, stated recently: ""I've seen more cancers in surprisingly young people than I would in previous practices"". He is referring specifically to Cobh. I believe it is an issue that is worthy of further investigation. I do not accept the social deprivation answer that has been given by the National Cancer Registry. We laud the work it does but we need some empirical evidence. It would appear that there is an intergenerational increase in the rate of cancer, not only prostate and female breast cancer, but also in other areas. I am asking the Minister at least to consider facilitating some stakeholder engagement on this issue. I am not necessarily looking for a cheque for a baseline study but if we can get a favourable response from the Minister to the idea of putting together some sort of stakeholder group involving UCC, which has stated that it would be willing at least to partake in further studies on this issue, then we could seek to deliver something for the people in Cobh, who are gravely concerned about the matter. I am asking the Minister to have an open mind. I will leave him with one metric. If one looks at the 1994 to 2007 figures, the urban area of Cobh had a 37% higher incidence than other parts of the country. That would mean that within that timeframe, someone in Cobh was diagnosed with cancer every 11 days. I thank the Acting Chairman and hope I will receive a favourable reply."
19231	SeanSherlock	Labour	15875.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	 I thank Deputies O'Dowd, Breathnach, Adams and Munster for raising this issue and for allowing me to address the House on the matter. In direct response to Deputy Munster's question, the first thing I am going to do is stop playing party politics with the health service, and that is why I received Cabinet approval today to move ahead with the motion - which I understand Deputy Munster's own party and indeed every party in this House feels very strongly about - to set up a cross-party committee to meet within six months to look at a single vision for a single tier public health service and how we are going to fund that. I look forward to constructive ideas on that measure. I regret that a decision was made to undertake industrial action in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda following the breakdown of talks at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, last Friday on resolution of the staffing difficulties at the hospital. I believe that the interests of patients are always best served through negotiation and by avoiding industrial action. Industrial action, even if it is limited to non-core duties, is not in the best interests of patient care and cannot resolve the staffing issues. Nonetheless, I take the point made by Deputy Munster about caring professionalism and I am sure it is not a decision any nurse takes lightly. I am pleased, therefore, that the INMO and the HSE have accepted an invitation from the WRC to attend a meeting tomorrow to discuss the issues. I welcome this progress and this recommencement of talks. I am satisfied that the issues raised by the INMO can be best addressed through engagement at the WRC. Meanwhile, the hospital is implementing a contingency plan to minimise, in so far as is possible, the impact of the industrial action on patient care. The emergency departments will remain open over the course of the industrial action in an effort to continue to meet patients’ emergency medical needs. Unfortunately, the contingency plan included cancelling all planned, non-urgent elective procedures today other than cancer related care. Patients whose appointments are affected were contacted directly by the hospital and a new date will be re-scheduled as soon as possible. I want to correct the impression that there is a recruitment embargo at present. This is not the case and there is no blanket embargo on recruitment. While there has to be compliance with national pay structures and management of employment numbers within budget in the HSE, there is scope for hospitals to continue to recruit, particularly across key departments such as intensive care units, theatre and emergency departments. Our Lady of Lourdes recognises the need for ongoing recruitment drives due to the movement of staff across the HSE and to other health care services in Ireland and abroad. To date, 34 nurses and midwives have been recruited to the hospital this year and 21 staff nurses are in the process of being recruited. At present there are two campaigns of particular relevance: a Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group competition and an initiative to offer all nursing graduates of 2016 the opportunity for permanent nursing posts. The HSE has continually increased staffing levels since the beginning of 2015. By the end of March 2016 overall health service employee numbers had increased by 5,856 whole-time equivalents, the vast majority in front-line positions. During that 15-month period from January 2015, the numbers employed in acute hospitals increased by 3,500 whole-time equivalents, with nursing numbers up by more than 1,700 whole-time equivalents during the same timeframe. I assure Deputies that the Government is fully aware of the difficulties and challenges. I am due to meet the INMO tomorrow to discuss nursing issues in general and I look forward to engaging constructively with it and to continuing the very constructive role it plays in co-chairing the emergency department task force as we all work together as stakeholders to try to address the issues facing our emergency departments and hospital staff, including nurses and midwives, in delivering care. It is my intention to continue to grow the health budget as the economy improves and to obtain the resources necessary to improve working conditions for front-line staff to enable us to deliver the level of service that we all want to provide to our patients. I wish to put the health service employee numbers on the record in this House. While it does not always fit the political narrative, the numbers are the numbers. I absolutely accept there is still some way to go to get back to the numbers of front-line staff working in our hospitals before the recession but it is important to note that the numbers have continued to increase since December 2013. At that time, there were 47,934 people working in the acute sector. In December 2014, that figure had increased to 49,742. By December 2015, it had increased to 52,539. In March 2016, that number stood at 53,253. With regard to nurses, including midwives, at the end of 2014 there were 34,211, which rose to 35,036 in March 2015 and to 35,918 in March 2016. Since December 2014, there has been an increase of 1,707 nurses, which is a 5% increase. Since March 2015, there has been an increase of 825, which is a 2.5% increase. There is significantly more to do but it is simply not correct to put the narrative out there that nursing numbers and front-line staff are declining when in fact the opposite is true. Deputy O'Dowd's invitation to visit Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is absolutely something I would like to take up and I look forward to visiting shortly.

In March 2016, that number stood at 53,253. With regard to nurses, including midwives, at the end of 2014 there were 34,211, which rose to 35,036 in March 2015 and to 35,918 in March 2016. Since December 2014, there has been an increase of 1,707 nurses, which is a 5% increase. Since March 2015, there has been an increase of 825, which is a 2.5% increase. There is significantly more to do but it is simply not correct to put the narrative out there that nursing numbers and front-line staff are declining when in fact the opposite is true. Deputy O'Dowd's invitation to visit Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is absolutely something I would like to take up and I look forward to visiting shortly.
19233	SeanSherlock	Labour	15876.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-25 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	150	" We support the motion before the House and acknowledge wholeheartedly that after 42 years we seem to be no closer to the truth, despite the best efforts of Barron and MacEntee and the best efforts of this House as articulated in its report of 2004 and the subsequent motions of 2008 and 2011. Now, here we are again seeking to speak for the victims and articulate on a cross-party basis and in a manner which speaks for all of the people within the 26 counties that we want to assist the victims and their families in seeking truth. I worry sometimes when I stand before this House speaking on this issue. It has taken 42 years of debate, cajoling and efforts on the part of the victims and their families, and I hope we will not let another generation go by before we do finally seek truth on this matter. I read a speech by the UK Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, recently. It was given on 11 February 2016. In the speech she stated, ""The Government fully recognises that it will be much more difficult to achieve our objective of building a genuinely shared future for everyone in Northern Ireland unless and until we can find some way of coming to terms with a divided past."" She went on to say: Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it will be pursued. Everyone is subject to the rule of law. However, it would appear that not everyone is subject to the rule of law. Why is it that we are still talking about this 42 years later, in an era of supposed transparency, where we are trying to deal with the legacy of the past and have been through two iterations of talks? I was party to those talks in 2014 and 2015 and it seems to me that there is a hunger among the victims and survivors for simple truth and that the issue of reconciliation and moving on as a society will never be attained fully until such time as truth reigns supreme. In this era, when Anglo-Irish relations are extremely positive and evolving in a positive sense, I do not see why we cannot facilitate people who want that basic and fundamental right to justice. It is worth noting that the Oireachtas sub-committee examination of the Barron report, which dates back to 2004, states: (ii) ... in all probability most if not all of the perpetrators came from Northern Ireland. (iii) That in all probability information which identifies and which concerns the perpetrators still exists in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. (iv) That in all probability most of the information touching on collusion in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is in Northern Ireland and/or in Great Britain. They are three very pertinent points and I do not think the situation has changed between 2004 and 2016 in that regard. I know that successive Governments have raised this issue with successive British Governments and I know, having served as Minister for North-South co-operation, that this has been raised very recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan. I also know, to be fair to the Minister, that he constantly raises this very specific issue, among others, with the Secretary of State. I believe strongly that this is a worthy motion. Diplomacy is very effective, whether it is economic or political diplomacy. It is important that this House send a message to the British Government on behalf of the Irish people, which is that we will continue to press for justice and truth and that we will allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession pertaining to these bombings. These issues need to be tackled if we are to fulfil better relations from an Anglo-Irish and North-South perspective. I believe strongly that this motion is worthy of support on a cross-party basis. I am keen to acknowledge the work of Justice for the Forgotten. I know those involved are in constant contact with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I wish to acknowledge their role as one of many organisations in the Six Counties that continue to advocate for victims. The legacy issues were not dealt with sufficiently in the last iteration of the Stormont talks. There is an important role for this House to play now on a cross-party basis. We must ensure that we continue to press for the legacy issues to be dealt with. Society, North and South, will not fully move on until these issues are dealt with. We have a duty of care to people within the Six Counties to continue to press these issues with the British Government."
19234	SeanSherlock	Labour	15876.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-25 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	330	 I am happy to give five minutes to my colleague if he wants to eat into Labour time.
19235	SeanSherlock	Labour	15876.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-05-25 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	337	 I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 2: To insert the following after “its recommendations by the Oireachtas”: “believes that those who have paid their water charges in accordance with law should not now be unfairly disadvantaged compared to those who have not; considers that, if the ongoing liability to pay is suspended, there would be no practical reality to pursuing outstanding unpaid charges; concludes that in such circumstances the only fair approach would be to make a full refund to all those who have paid their water charges; and agrees in principle to a referendum on a Constitutional amendment that commits to maintaining our public water supply and treatment systems, and our electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, in public ownership.” I wish to reiterate some points we made in this House on 27 April when we had statements on Irish Water. Some of those points are pertinent to tonight's debate. Law-abiding people who did pay will have to get their money back. That will mean Irish Water will have to reprocess well in excess of 2 million financial transactions. Regardless of whether the charge is to be suspended or abolished, the Labour Party believes the Government must tell people how and when it will give them their money back. It may not suit political discourse at present but it is a matter of fact that Irish Water's investment has delivered 34 new treatment plants, 26 of which are for wastewater and eight for drinking water, as well as 73 upgrades involving 51 wastewater and 22 drinking water facilities. A further 47 water conservation projects have been completed and 452 km of pipe has been remediated. If there is a proposal to revert to the local authorities whereby funds would be divested solely through the Exchequer through those local authorities, one need look no further than County Roscommon as an example of where the old model simply did not work. I believe Deputy Fitzmaurice already has made reference to this point. I need not remind Members of the improvements it has made the lives of more than 17,000 people in County Roscommon who were on boil water notices. The residents of Castlerea, for example, were subject to a boil water notice from November 2009 to June 2013. If the proposal is that it would revert to the local authorities, which is gaining credence in some circles, and that funding would come from the Exchequer and that people are already paying for water through their taxation, why then is it that these issues were not addressed at that time? The Labour Party amendment and the addendum seek to speak for those who did pay their water charges. We believe that those who have paid their charges in accordance with the law should not now be unfairly disadvantaged compared with those who have not. We believe that if the ongoing liability to pay is suspended, there would be no practical reality to pursuing outstanding unpaid charges and that in such circumstances, the only fair approach would be to make a full refund to all those who have paid their water charges. Moreover, the Labour Party agrees in principle to a referendum on a constitutional amendment that commits to maintaining Ireland's public water supply and treatment systems, as well as its electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks in public ownership. The Labour Party has already tabled a Bill in this regard.

19239	SeanSherlock	Labour	15883.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	 We welcome the motion to develop a single long-term vision or plan for the provision of health care. I add my congratulations to those of others to the two Ministers and acknowledge Deputy Róisín Shortall's singular vision in creating the motion. We are in positive mode in relation to the potential of the committee and will engage productively with it. I welcome the tone of the Minister's speech in that there appears to be a genuine willingness to engage with all parties and all Members in this Dáil in seeking a meeting of minds on how we can figure out and instigate a proper vision for the provision of health care into the future. If we are honest, we can reasonably assume that there is much common ground between us on the needs of citizens. There has to be a particular focus on the continuum of care as between primary, secondary and tertiary care. The one question I have on the creation of the committee is how it will dovetail with the commitments in the programme for Government. Will it be a tool of Government policy into the future or what mandate will it have if it comes up with a set of recommendations that do not tally with the commitments in the programme for Government, of which there are many? Given that approximately €13 billion is to be spent this year alone in the health sector and considering the many commitments made in the programme for Government from primary care through to secondary and tertiary care, including mental health, the issue of resources will have to be addressed within the remit of the committee. If we are to aspire to having a comprehensive continuum of care between primary, secondary and tertiary care, including community care and mental health service provision, it will cost a good deal of money and clear choices will have to be made. To be fair to him, the Minister mentioned this in his contribution when he referred to the trade-offs between efficiency and equity and comprehensiveness and cost control. This is something that will merit further interrogation. I welcome the document Better Health because it provides a good template and sets out the parameters within which we are operating. Some of the challenges in health care provision include the fact that the number of people aged over 85 years in Ireland is, according to CSO estimates, increasing by approximately 3.3% each year. This presents a major challenge for all of us in the management of demographics. Some 38% of Irish people over the age of 50 years suffer from one chronic disease. Chronic diseases account for 80% of all GP visits, 40% of hospital admissions and 75% of hospital bed days. The Minister speaks strongly about focusing on primary care and trying to intervene as much as possible at that level. That is something on which we all agree. The aim of such a policy should seek to ensure people are kept out of tertiary care facilities for as long as possible and that interventions are made at community level. That would have a major impact in patient care and would also create the ability to reduce costs and be more efficient in the use of resources. On the flipside, it would require a massive injection of capital into the primary care system. If we are to manage the demographic challenges and the ongoing challenges in chronic care services, as I have outlined, in that paradigm primary care facilities will need resources. Speaking as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, the last Government created a health innovation hub. We created a demonstrator model whereby we sought to utilise the best research that exists from a geographical perspective in terms of medical devices and services. We sought to inculcate the thinking that exists based on the research that is ongoing within our academic institutions as a means of seeking to ensure those greater efficiencies. I am not sure where the health innovation hub stands at present now that there is a new Government formed. However, I believe that innovation and engagement with stakeholders in the academic space is going to be vital. We will need a proper analysis of population figures and a sense of inculcating some of the thinking that exists within academic institutions to determine how we are going to provide the vision that is necessary. I believe that the primary care centres are one mechanism by which we could link up with academic institutions to try to drive innovation and to ensure, as Deputy Kelleher stated earlier, that more diagnostics take place within the primary care settings so as to prevent people from presenting to secondary and tertiary care facilities and to keep them at home for longer. The data that is used can then be analysed and partnered with medical device companies, innovators in the health care provision space or academics to try to analyse the data so that we can then produce policy outcomes that deliver the efficiencies that are necessary for the system. We need more of that within the system. It is a case of mainstreaming that into the system because currently it is peripheral. We need to have a greater interrogation of the relationship between the HSE and the Department of Health. There is still some siloed thinking in how the HSE, this House, the Department of Health and the Minister interact. We need a greater interrogation of that relationship to ensure that there is more transparency around it. We also need to look at why there is a constant need for a Supplementary Estimate on an ongoing basis. I say that objectively. Taking this year for example, if there is provision made at the start of the year for €13 billion, will this committee have a remit to examine and interrogate the deployment of resources more closely? We need to look at it in terms of seeking efficiencies for the system in order that the citizen can have confidence that he or she will have access to the services that are necessary, whether he or she presents to a GP, a secondary care facility or a tertiary care facility. We need to look at the whole issue of health insurance and we need to talk to the health insurance providers. We need to look at why there is spare capacity within secondary care facilities, such as Mallow or Ennis, where more elective surgery could be done. We could take much of the constraints that are in hospitals such as Cork University Hospital and radiate more services out to secondary care facilities. With regard to mental health, we need to have a proper discussion on how A Vision for Change is implemented and resourced.
19240	SeanSherlock	Labour	15883.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	 I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. He has always had a keen interest in fisheries matters. In previous debates on the matter, Deputies from Malin Head to Mizen Head and from Hook Head to Clogher Head were exercised by the matter. The Deputy's constituency colleague and my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, also contacted me about the matter. As I said to the various principal officers I met today, I come to this portfolio with not a mile of coast in my constituency. Maybe in some regards this is an advantage in that I come with no baggage. I welcome good counsel on these matters and Deputy Pringle will not be shy in marking my card and giving me a whisper in the ear if I need assistance on these matters. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, which gives me an opportunity to update the Dáil on certain matters pertaining to the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2016, SI 125 of 2016. Member States are required, under the 2009 EU Fisheries “Control” Regulation, to assign the appropriate number of points to the licence holder of the vessel concerned every time a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is committed. Ireland had previously implemented the required EU points system by means of SI 3 of 2014, which was the subject of two recent High Court challenges and was struck down in one of them. The two High Court judgments are subject to appeal. Given that Ireland is required to have in place a legal instrument implementing the EU points system, a new amended instrument, Sl 125 of 2016, was drafted and signed on 1 March 2016. It took on board, to the extent possible, issues of concern regarding procedures and process which had been highlighted in the High Court cases. Much of the scrutiny regarding SI 125 of 2016 since it came into force stems from the fact that points apply separate to any criminal prosecution or conviction or where a prosecution results in an acquittal. It has been suggested that the EU points system should, instead, be combined with a successful prosecution through the courts. In recent weeks, there have been a number of meetings between me, my predecessor and the fishing industry with regard to the concerns raised. I met with representatives of the fishing industry this morning to discuss a wide range of issues and, in particular, their concerns on the implementation of the EU points system. On taking office, I requested that the Attorney General consider whether there is a way that the assignment of EU points for the licence holder can await the completion of the prosecution process while at the same time ensuring Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law. Further to the programme for Government commitment pertaining to the assignment of points, I quickly sought that advice from the Attorney General as prescribed in the document. Having received this advice, I am satisfied to move on the introduction of a system for the sequential application for EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, thus fulfilling the ambition outlined in the partnership programme and going to the heart of Deputy Pringle's concerns which he articulated here. This move is subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law. I have listened to the concerns of industry and intend to report back to the Oireachtas as soon as I have finalised a way forward in the context of dealing with the legal and administrative matters that arise. However, I am confident that these matters can be dealt with in a collaborative and constructive manner with all stakeholders. Irish fishermen should be assured that the State is taking seriously their concerns that a fishing industry can be maintained for them and those coming after them. The conservation of fishing resources is in everyone's interest and is vital for the future of the Irish fishing industry. I am confident that the reformed points system that I have announced will play a vital role in acting as an effective sanction against the minority who break the rules, protecting the vast majority of our law abiding industry and preserving the fishing resources for all fishermen and for future generations.

I note neither the education and training board nor the Department had any advance notice that this issue was likely to occur. The City of Dublin Education and Training Board has been working with TARGET for a long time and, as the Deputy noted, it has been providing further education and training in Donaghmede for more than 20 years. It was located in St. Kevin's school, Newbrook Road, Donaghmede, and it provides a wide range of courses which the Deputy has outlined and I do not believe I need to repeat them. As he indicated, they include services that go well beyond the remit of the Department of Education and Skills into counselling, child care and many community services but it is supported specifically in respect of adult education provision by the CDETB. I am aware of the pressure of school enrolments on St. Kevin's junior school because it has experienced a 57% increase in the period between 2011 and 2015 and that trend is continuing. In that context, the school submitted an application in June 2015 to provide for the refurbishment of existing spaces to create two classroom-sized spaces to create a mainstream classroom and a resource room for special education. My Department examined and approved that application and the funding was provided. This latest decision by St. Kevin's, which has written to TARGET informing it that the school is not in position to renew the lease into the future, has come as news and obviously creates difficulties for TARGET in continuing its work. I have been in touch with the CDETB and it will make contact with representatives of TARGET to discuss the possible options, bearing in mind the pressures that exist. As the Deputy requested, I will explore what solutions can be found to ascertain whether the service can be continued, as it has been delivering a valuable service for a considerable time and the notice received has been extremely abrupt. I undertake to pursue this matter, as the Deputy suggests, to establish whether a solution can be found that would allow this to continue. While I do not have a specific course of action I can recommend to the Deputy at this stage, I thank him for raising the matter and I assure him I will give it attention.

As he indicated, they include services that go well beyond the remit of the Department of Education and Skills into counselling, child care and many community services but it is supported specifically in respect of adult education provision by the CDETB. I am aware of the pressure of school enrolments on St. Kevin's junior school because it has experienced a 57% increase in the period between 2011 and 2015 and that trend is continuing. In that context, the school submitted an application in June 2015 to provide for the refurbishment of existing spaces to create two classroom-sized spaces to create a mainstream classroom and a resource room for special education. My Department examined and approved that application and the funding was provided. This latest decision by St. Kevin's, which has written to TARGET informing it that the school is not in position to renew the lease into the future, has come as news and obviously creates difficulties for TARGET in continuing its work. I have been in touch with the CDETB and it will make contact with representatives of TARGET to discuss the possible options, bearing in mind the pressures that exist. As the Deputy requested, I will explore what solutions can be found to ascertain whether the service can be continued, as it has been delivering a valuable service for a considerable time and the notice received has been extremely abrupt. I undertake to pursue this matter, as the Deputy suggests, to establish whether a solution can be found that would allow this to continue. While I do not have a specific course of action I can recommend to the Deputy at this stage, I thank him for raising the matter and I assure him I will give it attention.
19251	SeanSherlock	Labour	15905.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-06-23 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	86	" I welcome the fact that time has been devoted today for statements on the summer economic statement. If I may make a request, I ask that at some stage time be provided in the finance committee or the budgetary control committee so we can have a more iterative process and a question and answer process to interrogate the points made heretofore on the macroeconomic piece of the economic statement and the microeconomic element. If we take some of the points made on the universal social charge, there is a difference in emphasis between the parties. In its manifesto, my party made a commitment to abolish the universal social charge for the first €72,000 of an individual's income. A school of thought seems to be emerging here, and whether there is common ground to be found on the treatment of the universal social charge on a cross-party basis remains to be seen. As I said, we need to have a more iterative process in committee to discuss how we can find some common ground on this. I wish to speak specifically on the summer economic statement as it relates to next year. I do not want to go too far beyond next year, given the political ferment we are in at present. I acknowledge the projections, but the net message of the summer economic statement is that approximately €300 million is to be made available for additional tax cuts and approximately €600 million is to be made available for additional expenditure in 2017. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has described the sum as a contractional one. The ESRI, in its quarterly economic commentary for summer 2016, states that economic growth in GNP terms will be 4.8% in 2016 and 4.3% in 2017. The ESRI has reported an indicative slowdown in global trade and pointed to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the Brexit referendum as having an adverse impact on the trade sector of the Irish economy. The ESRI is pointing to ""domestic sources of growth, investment and consumption [as] the main determinants of the increase expected in Irish economic activity."" We argued at the last election for a ratio of 2:1 between investment and tax reductions. This seems to be what is being outlined in the summer economic statement. However, one could argue for a better ratio in order to deliver on the indexation of welfare payments, smaller class sizes, transport infrastructure, health care and so on. Consider also capital investment for productive purposes, be they broadband, schools or roads. If the Government sets up a rainy day fund for economic downturns or externalities over which we have no control, the question arises as to whether we are being risk averse. Should we consider investing in infrastructure to fund economic growth instead of simply leaving money on deposit? Also, the 2:1 ratio only applies after the rainy day fund has been created. We need a closer interrogation of what the fund is about and what it will mean. A more detailed analysis of the issues is required. If we understand the proposal of the rainy day fund correctly, it will commit €1 billion per annum between 2019 and 2021. When will proposals be tabled in the Dáil for the fund's creation? On Tuesday, the Taoiseach told us that the total amount available to the Government over the next five years was an estimated cumulative of €11.3 billion. The space for 2017 has increased to approximately €1 billion, with €1.2 billion available in 2018. This is the supposed logic for bringing forward spending in 2017 for ""infrastructure and social issues"", to quote the Taoiseach from Tuesday. I do not want to spend too much time discussing the projections beyond 2017, but we welcome those relating to the increase in capital expenditure. We wonder whether we could be more ambitious in that regard with a view to expansionary economic activity. Since my colleague has discussed the public sector pay elements and the Lansdowne Road agreement, I do not want to dwell too much on them, but we in the committee debated the 2016 Estimates yesterday and it is our view that, if the promise of a new budgetary architecture is to mean anything in terms of a truly collaborative approach to governance where the primacy of this House supersedes that of the Executive, there must be a better consultative process for budget 2017. If the House rises in July and returns in the autumn, the space for such a discussion is limited. We want to interrogate further whether there is common ground to be had between parties on budget 2017, particularly regarding the taxation on work side. We feel that there is greater scope for more capital expenditure. Although we acknowledge the increases, there is a positive multiplier effect. The programme for Government includes clear commitments on regional economic growth and targets for the number of jobs that it seeks to create outside of the Dublin area. If one is realistic about that job creation, though, one needs an Atlantic corridor strategy that links the three main cities beyond Dublin, namely, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Issues of connectivity between the three must be considered, including capital expenditure on roads infrastructure, if the job creation target of 130,000 plus outside of Dublin is to be achieved during the lifetime of this Government. We need to get away from the anachronistic policy provision whereby there is an increase in expenditure every year via a Revised Estimate presented to the House relating to, for instance, health. We are all of the view that, if a Department is allocated an amount of money for a year, justifying a Revised Estimate for same should be difficult if the people within the Department have already made spending projections. We go through this choreography and pageantry around Revised Estimates every year. If we are to examine performance and reform within the public sector, we must determine how to move away from the architecture of Revised Estimates. If we are considering budgetary arithmetic in a truly collaborative fashion, we should seek to ensure that Departments have enough money to do the jobs that they need to do. We must be a bit more lateral in our thinking. The summer economic statement is a point-in-time assessment of where we stand now and speaks to the challenges ahead. We must devote more time in committee to delving into how the multi-annual expenditure ceilings will operate, how the publication of the updated public spending code will operate and what the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, means to the allocation of public money in terms of greater levels of transparency and efficiency. Evidence-based decision making so as to ensure that we spend public money in ways that will be of maximum benefit to the people of Ireland is vital. The summer economic statement makes reference to the increase in the minimum wage. It is proposed that the minimum wage be increased to €10.50 per hour over the next five years. I hope that we could have a further discussion about this proposal in committee. For example, how is the Low Pay Commission proposed to operate? The Labour Party has argued for a living wage and has clear proposals on how this can be achieved. To our minds, the sum of €10.50 after five years is not where we want to go, given that the House passed a motion on 1 June that supported the call for a programme of incremental increases in the national minimum wage until it was pegged at 60% of median earnings and for a living wage of €11.50 per hour to be adopted throughout the public sector. There was a clear statement by the House, agreed by all parties, that contradicts the summer economic statement. If we are in the paradigm of new politics, we must respect the fact that there was a clear motion that was the majority view. I want to return to the question of the Low Pay Commission. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, made a very specific reference to public service pay. He reminded the House that ""the programme for Government contains a specific commitment to establish a public service pay commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay."" We welcome that proposal. We await the details of the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. It is fair to ask when the commission will be established. What will its exact remit be? How will it be constituted? Will it include members of the trade union movement? How is it proposed to deal with entry levels of pay? I echo the points made by Deputy Calleary earlier with regard to the statement made today by gardaí on restoration of pay for new entrants. It is important that we deal with this issue and find a mechanism through which a positive outcome can be achieved for new entrants. I would welcome a further discussion on the local investment fund at the relevant line committee. We need a further interrogation of what this €200 million fund will deliver in 2017. It is not entirely clear how individual local authorities will compete for this remarkable pot of money. I think we have to acknowledge the increases in capital expenditure. We would like to interrogate further with the line Ministers each of the points raised here today. Perhaps that can happen on a cross-party basis as part of an iterative process. We need to move beyond the tribes. If the paradigm shift in relation to how we do business in this House is to be meaningful, we must take a collaborative approach to reaching consensus on policy provisions."

I have some technical questions to ask and will also request a further discussion on this issue here to discuss the more technical aspects of this plan. Perhaps that could be done outside the committee structure because every Member of the House has a vested interest in the issue and, while not necessarily being members of the relevant committee, they may be spokespersons in that area. That is the new paradigm we are in. As I understand it, the options that were placed before the Minister were whittled down to two. The first, which the Government chose, is the commercial stimulus or gap-funding model whereby the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network. There are contractual obligations within that model. Second, there is the full concession model whereby the private sector again finances, designs, builds and operates the network, but the asset is handed back to the State after 25 years. My understanding is that going for the full concession model, involving a reversion of the asset back to the State after 25 years, would have had implications in putting the entire cost of the project on balance sheet. There would therefore have been an impact on fiscal space. I did not hear the Minister's opening remarks but I think he referred to Deputy Howlin's earlier intervention about certain choices that have to be made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I will not get into a political tit for tat on that. However, the logic of opting for the fully privatised or gap-funding model is that the fiscal space would not be covered by the Exchequer's capital funding envelope. I am seeking a discussion on the KPMG report which advised the gap-funding model. What was the legal advice in real terms for opting against the full concession model? I am told - and, to be fair, the Department has been open about this - that the full concession model was deemed to be significantly more complex from a contractual perspective. In addition, it would take six months or possibly longer to negotiate a contract. One tries to be as factual as one can but if one goes to a company like KPMG, or another external adviser in the private sector, on the law of averages they are not necessarily going to say that one should come back with a model that reverts the asset back to the State after 25 years. That is why I want to have a further discussion on this matter which warrants further investigation. The KPMG report presented arguments in favour of the commercial stimulus model. A departmental document stated that this model placed all the technology and demand risk on the private sector, while costing the Exchequer less. In addition, the asset will rely extensively on commercially-owned third-party assets which will not be within the control of Government. That is one of the considerations which warrants further discussion. There is cross-party support for this motion and we all have myriad examples in our own constituencies. However, anything we do now could be surpassed by new technologies in the provision of broadband. We do not know what kind of technology will exist in 25 years' time. I am not breaching the Minister's confidence in saying that we had a discussion on this matter previously; it was an open conversation. If new infrastructure is being created and the State is investing in it, a more conservative view would be to retain the network in State ownership because we do not know what will happen technologically downstream. That would be a more cautious approach. Is there is a mechanism to have a discussion here on how we would fund the cost of the full concession model over a longer period than the five or six years we are talking about? We can only talk in limited terms about the future fiscal space but if the capital envelope goes from approximately €275 million up to €600 million, which may be the true cost, is there room for such a discussion? This is particularly relevant given our relationship with the EU at present and given the new political realities that exist with the EU. I know the Minister will say that this would slow down the process. I do appreciate that point and I am not trying to score political points. I noted Deputy Stanley's reference to a Labour U-turn, but in fact there is no U-turn on this. We are, however, trying to have as broad a discussion as possible so that we can future-proof what we are creating now. In that way, we will not give something away which we might have been able, with foresight, to retain as a public asset. That is the logic of what I am proposing. However, we will support the amendment. Given that the scheme has now been announced and agreed at Cabinet, I do not know if the scheme has any legal standing beyond the fact that the Parliament will make its own voice heard on this issue. The scheme will proceed as agreed by the Government in the final analysis. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to have a more detailed discussion about the KPMG aspect, and the full concession model versus the gap-funding model. I would like us to have that discussion in a more detailed forum.

Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills make all resources available to ensure that temporary accommodation will be set up in advance of the school year in September and that all resources are deployed?
19270	SeanSherlock	Labour	15925.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	252	 I am delighted to be able to raise this matter. Today, at 3 a.m., a serious fire engulfed the Patrician Academy post-primary boys' school in Mallow, County Cork. It caused extensive damage to the administrative block, science labs, technical drawing and woodwork rooms and computer facilities. The building dates from 1886. The school was established by the Patrician Brothers and has since been laicised. The fire caused such extensive damage that adjoining residential premises were evacuated in the early hours of the morning. In the meantime the Garda has confirmed that a technical examination of the site is under way. In raising the matter I recognise that it will take considerable time to move to construction phase and that people are still getting over the shock of what happened last night. The school community still feels very raw about it, but I ask the Minister for Education, Deputy Richard Bruton, once the school community, the principal and the board of management make formal contact with the Department, if emergency accommodation can be provided in advance of the start of the new school year in September. Parents, the principal, the teachers and the community are very anxious not to be left without at least temporary accommodation, particularly for those students who will be facing into State examinations from September onwards. I am, therefore, raising the issue to ask that these resources be made available. I acknowledge that the Secretary General of the Department spoke to me today about the matter. I recognise that there are quite a number of issues that will have to be gone through, including insurance, investigations, etc., but I am hopeful the Department will prioritise this project. We acknowledge that there has been a considerable degree of capital investment in the school in the recent past, including the provision of an autism unit, as well as additional classrooms. I am hopeful, therefore, that at least in the short term, pending further planning for the rebuilding and future-proofing of the school, emergency accommodation will be provided as soon as possible and that, once the school makes formal contact with the Department, the matter will be expedited.
19271	SeanSherlock	Labour	15925.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	254	 I am very grateful to the Minister for his response and his officials for the contact that has been made with the school authorities, particularly the school principal, Ms Catherine Fitzpatrick. I also acknowledge the fact that officials will undertake a site visit, which is to be welcomed. I thank the Minister for his proactive response and I am assured by his statement that provision will be made for the emergency or temporary accommodation that will be necessary from September onwards.
19272	SeanSherlock	Labour	15925.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	" I thank the Ceann Comhairle. If the unaligned Deputies present themselves, I will be happy to share time with them. I have no hesitation in agreeing that au pair hosting is a valuable tradition. It can benefit both host families and young foreign visitors who are helped in a domestic environment to improve language skills and enjoy a positive cultural experience. None of us wants to undermine the viability of genuine au pair arrangements, but we must recognise there are two sides to this story. Not all experiences are mutually beneficial. We must also recognise that this Bill, no matter how it is presented, is aimed at removing statutory protections that are currently enjoyed. Until now, au pairs have not been treated as a separate category of worker in our employment law. If there is an agreement to do work, regardless of what title one gives the worker, he or she is entitled to the benefit of our employment protection laws, including on the national minimum wage. A realistic debate on this issue has to take into account the facts on the ground. It seems clear that in many cases au pairs are being used as underpaid domestic workers because of our crisis in child care provision. For example, last year’s survey by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland showed an age profile for au pairs that does not match the popular perception. It showed that 37% had no contract at all and 40% a verbal contract only. Some 20% had paid a fee to get the job, 38% were expected to work more than originally agreed, 31% had been asked to work when they were sick, 58% were paid €120 or less per week, one in ten did not have her own bedroom, and one in five was expected to be on call at night. A balance is needed here. On the one hand, au pair relationships are unique and deserve to be fostered. I agree that the allowance for providing board and lodging, which can be deducted from the minimum wage but which was last properly examined in 2000, needs to be reviewed urgently. On the other hand, I do not believe the best way to regularise activity in the sector is simply to exempt individuals who are legally employed on an employer–employee basis from our entire suite of employment rights legislation. One should remember that, traditionally understood, au pairs are here primarily to improve their English. They stay here as language students and the domestic setting is an adjunct to the time spent in a language school or college. It is important to bear this in mind when considering how much time an au pair should be required to devote to what this Bill describes as ""light domestic duties"". Section 2(1)(b) of the legislation states a criterion for placement is that one “be a non-citizen of the EU ordinarily resident in the Republic of Ireland with a student entry visa as prescribed by Ministerial Order under the Immigration Act 2004."" Our immigration laws restrict part-time students to working no more than 20 hours per week. I see no reason we should expect au pairs to work longer than other students for less pay in an entirely unprotected statutory environment and to the detriment of the studies that bring them here in the first place. The objectives of the Bill are inadequate. For example, it proposes an au pair accreditation council to perform important statutory functions but it does not make any provision in respect of the membership of the council, who gets to appoint the members and to whom they are accountable. The Bill does not explicitly state au pairs are exempt from minimum wage legislation, which I presume is its central purpose and the reason for the reference to “pocket money”. There are so many questions raised but left unanswered by this Bill that my party and I cannot support it. It seems to us to be designed more to meet the demands of those in the au pair sector who want light alternative regulation rather than registering as employment agencies than it is designed to meet the needs of families or au pairs themselves. Perhaps the Deputy who is proposing the Bill might respond to that. I do not make that point as a charge. We are all inherently in favour of what the sector delivers for families and the au pairs themselves in terms of the experience they gain. However, we want to ensure we have the right motives when presenting legislation of this nature. It may be that wholesale amendment could improve the Bill but we would not in any circumstances support a legislative regime brought in simply to ensure foreign au pairs could be used in an unprotected way as a resource to meet a need that is not being met within the domestic labour market."

19279	SeanSherlock	Labour	15981.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	172	" In the few minutes available, I wish to crystallise my interpretation of this issue as best I can. I represent part of the county of Cork and many of my constituents work for Apple. There is no doubt, based on the feedback I have received, that there is concern for the long-term future of Apple and other FDI companies located in the Cork region in particular. There is concern about the possible effect of the Commission's ruling on long-term investment on Irish soil and on our ability to sustain the employment that already exists not only in Cork but also throughout the Republic as a whole. Members must distinguish between what was interpreted as a breach of state aid rules, on one hand, and an overreaching by the European Commission into the sovereign affairs of a member state on a matter of taxation policy, on the other. I have been trying to get to the nub of the issue and there is a very good blog post by Mr. Tony Connelly of RTE which outlines what is at play here. He argues that for a tax concessions such as that given to Apple to qualify as illegal state aid, four criteria must be fulfilled. The aid ""must be provided by the state and financed by state resources"" - that is questionable. It must ""grant advantage"". Did it grant advantage to other companies in a similar sector? The advantage must be ""selective"", that is, ""it goes to one company or one category of companies with a specific commercial activity, and not to others"". Finally, it must ""distort competition and trade within the EU"". If it does not meet those four criteria, then arguably, the ruling should fall and there are questions around whether those criteria are being applied objectively as they relate to the treaties of the European Union. I wish to refer briefly to the US Treasury Department's white paper, which was issued on 24 August and which is entitled, The European Commission's Recent State Aid Investigations of Transfer Pricing Rulings. This document makes the following very pertinent point: There is the possibility that any repayments ordered by the Commission will be considered foreign income taxes that are creditable against U.S. taxes owed by the companies in the United States. If so, the companies’ U.S. tax liability would be reduced dollar for dollar by these recoveries when their offshore earnings are repatriated or treated as repatriated as part of possible U.S. tax reform. To the extent that such foreign taxes are imposed on income that should not have been attributable to the relevant Member State, that outcome is deeply troubling, as it would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the U.S. government and its taxpayers. It goes on to say: Adopting new enforcement regimes with retroactive effect will hinder companies’ ability to assess risks and plan for the future, and sets an unwelcome precedent for tax authorities around the world to take similar retroactive actions that could affect U.S. and EU companies alike. It also undermines the G20 agenda to improve tax certainty. There is a battleground here and that battleground is Ireland. This country is being used as a battleground between the European Union and the United States of America to see who can give effect to the issue of global tax justice and transparency. It is our contention that the only reasonable and logical thing to do is to be joined in an appeal of this decision. There is a pertinent political point here as to whether the Commission is perceived to be reaching into the sovereignty of a member state in the area of taxation policy. There is precedent here where taxation has been or could be deemed to have been used as a state-aid tool and there are established cases in that regard, for example, one involving the Spanish bank Santander. Europe is moving to the extreme right at present and while Ireland, as a nation, has always been vehemently pro-European, there is a perception that the European Commission is overreaching in this particular case. The Revenue Commissioners have stated clearly that there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law. There are some in this House who do not want to believe the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and that is fair enough, particularly if they want to make a political point in that regard. I accept the statement by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. On the basis of the fact that the Revenue is an independent statutory body, we should make this appeal."

19283	SeanSherlock	Labour	16015.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-11 00:00:00	Financial Resolutions 2017	53	" This is a do-nothing budget in a do-nothing Dáil. It has been designed by committee and makes a mockery of the Dáil reform process on which we had purportedly engaged after the last election. We were supposed to have a more collaborative approach to budgetary mechanisms and the forming of the budget but these have not transpired. It is a do-nothing budget because on account of the political reality that exists at the moment, it spreads itself so thinly that it has no material benefit for any citizen. We are trying to form a budget in this House against the backdrop of an uncertain global and political landscape, with the far right on the rise in Europe and disenchantment with politics around the world, which we ignore at our peril. It is not difficult to understand why people are cynical when they hear that we are supposed to be involved in a paradigm shift with new politics but then see this budget, in which there is no evidence of societal changes nor any economic benefit to them in their everyday lives. This is the result of the lack of real engagement on what was supposed to be a real reform in the procedures of this House on behalf of the people. We all threw our weight behind the new politics. If anything, what it has taught us is that the budgetary process is the same old political chicanery dressed up in new clothes. Budgetary oversight was to be based on the presentation of a set of figures on which we would all make our case for those whom we sought to represent, but this week we were treated to the same old political chicanery in that after the main Opposition parties had published alternative budget proposals, we were told an additional €200 million to expand the so-called fiscal space had been found through savings. It is pointless having a budgetary control committee or a budgetary process if on budget day the detail is to be announced on ""Morning Ireland"" before the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have had an opportunity to announce it in the House. Fair play to the media: they got the scoop, but it makes a mockery of the process in which we are engaged such that all we are doing is going through the motions. Following publication of the White Paper we sought clarification from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but they did not provide any. Following the remarks last week of the chief economist at the Department of Finance at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight the White Paper published over the weekend confirmed that there would be a further Supplementary Estimate on the capital side of approximately €190 million. This was despite the fact that the Minister for Finance had made it clear to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that there could be no further Supplementary Estimates. He also indicated in response to a parliamentary question that there was no scope for additional voted expenditure above the aggregate level already approved, but, lo and behold, an additional €200 million has been found in the period between when he issued that response and today. This proves the point that nothing has really changed in this House. A budget that seeks to be all things to all people will be nothing to anybody. If this is about playing to the gallery of Fianna Fáil or the Independents, let us not have Fianna Fáil Members on the plinth later tonight trying to play Tadhg an dá thaobh and saying they are disappointed the Minister has not done this or that when they were clearly part of the process. If we are honest, new politics in this new paradigm is no longer about Civil War politics or the political exigencies between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but about management and who has the better management plan. Perhaps it is time they buried the hatchet; otherwise let us get on with the new politics in a real and meaningful way. On public sector pay, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform incorrectly stated: ""Today’s budget includes the provision of €290 million for pay increases agreed under the Lansdowne Road Agreement."" I would like to nail that lie. The provision relates to the restoration of pay. It is important that the impression not be conveyed from this House that it is for pay increases; it is for a hard fought for restoration of pay by the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin. This is a budget that misdirects resources in its scatter-gun approach. It provides an additional €50 million plus for child care services and over €25 million for a sheep scheme. It does very little by way of an impact on child care. I refer to Deputy Joan Burton's contribution and what could have be done in that regard. The Labour Party's budget submission was costed on the basis of the parameters provided for last week, notwithstanding the additional €200 million that has been found. For example, as proposed in the Labour Party's submission, for an additional €177 million we could have a universal child care scheme for children under 12 years, at a cost of €71 million, and a cap on the cost to parents at €4.25 per hour for up to 40 hours a week. This would have a real impact. What we have instead is an opaque scheme, subject to publication of the details, which provides for subsidised child care from September 2017 for parents earning under €47,000, up to a figure of €8,000 for children from six months to 15 years old, and a €900 subsidy for those on a combined income above €47,000. If the budgetary process is to mean anything, these details should have been furnished to us. If we are about ensuring a more collaborative Dáil in checking the power of the Cabinet, we should have had the real detail in order to engage in a critique of it today and receive an early response in that regard. The additional spend of €35 million on child care service is not very imaginative when one considers that, as I said, €25 million is being provided for the sheep sector. This speaks to the imbalance in the Government's priorities. The Minister did not refer to upskilling those involved in the child care sector. Within the envelope of €177 million he could, for example, have created a living wage of €11.50 per hour for all child care workers, at a cost of €62 million approximately. He could also have provided for an additional four weeks of paternity leave, at a cost of €42 million. The Labour Party proposed a set of measures which, instead of providing for a piecemeal reduction in the USC that will have no real knock-on effect in quality of life for people, would have enabled the Government to invest taxpayers hard earned taxes in the delivery of a more comprehensive child care sector which would have provided for the upskilling of workers, proper wages for those within the sector, opportunities to engage in continuing professional development and for a greater degree of universality. I acknowledge that there is a degree of universality in what the Minister is proposing, but we want to see the details. It would have been good to have had them immediately. Budget 2016 provided for an increase in the old age pension. Last year the Labour Party was excoriated in every constituency by Fianna Fáil for having only given old age pensioners a miserly €3 extra in their pension payments. When one weighs up the increase in the Christmas bonus and looks at the €3 increase for those on the pension, it amounted to an increase over a full 52 weeks of €271. People from Fianna Fáil went out and did battle for the €5 increase. The net result of this Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael budget will be a total net increase, when one adds in the Christmas bonus and the €5 from 1 March, of €245. In fact, the cumulative or net increase in 2017 is less than the net increase in 2016. That is not taking into account the increase in the fuel allowance last year, which I see no evidence of this year."
19284	SeanSherlock	Labour	16015.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-11 00:00:00	Financial Resolutions 2017	55	 Let us look at health. Where is the money that will follow A Vision for Change? Where is the money for mental health? The former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, did battle internally and with our friends in Fine Gael to protect a mental health budget but I see no real monetary mention of in this budget today. Let us look at what the Labour Party would have provided for €375 million. We would have reduced prescription charges. We would have looked at the recruitment of early intervention teams for all children with disabilities. We would have put in place an extra 780 staff across the disciplines every year to clear the backlog. We would have employed more occupational therapists. We would have put €18.2 million into home care packages and built out an extra 1.3 million home help hours at a cost of €20 million. We see no evidence of real increases in the number of home help hours provided by this Government. We do not know what to tell people who are caring for others. If they look at the budget, they will find nothing in it of benefit to them. That is extremely disappointing. I referred to mental health earlier. We would have provided €7 million for better mental health, which would have provided more access to counselling for 16 to 25 year olds. We would have extended the Jigsaw programme to five further locations at a cost of €4 million and we would have ring-fenced mental health funding. For €200,000, the Government could have hired 25 specialist suicide prevention nurses. We are not seeing evidence of that in this budget today. We do not even see a nod towards the issue of mental health in terms of real and concrete proposals. Do we have to wait for the national service plan, of which the HSE has ownership through the Department of Health, for that? What we would have loved to have seen was some degree of exploration of the vision around mental health from either of the Ministers who spoke. Deputy Joan Burton referred to sport, which is inherently tied to mental health. If one looks at the figures of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, one sees an actual net decrease in the investment in sport. The Minister said he was going to announce a sports capital scheme. While such a scheme would be very welcome in most communities throughout the country, it can only go so far. We must align a greater degree of investment in sport, including minority sports, with mental health. We must also ensure that A Vision for Change is implemented in full. Let us look at health in the round. There is €15 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which is a negligible figure. I wonder if it will really have an impact on waiting lists. There is only €10 million for 950 home care packages, 58 transitional care beds, expansion of the community intervention teams and 55 acute beds. That will not clear the backlog. It will have no impact at all in real terms and it goes to the point I made at the outset of my intervention that if one spreads oneself too thinly and tries to be all things to all people, one will deliver nothing in terms of real impact for the vast majority on the ground. If the budget had focused on significant investment in child care, it would not have pleased all the people but it would at least have gone some way towards effecting societal change. It would have gone back to the idea that people should derive some benefit from the hard-earned taxes they pay. They are not feeling that now. Let us look at education. There is provision for 680 new teachers to meet demographic demands. That is not new and, as such, I would not be trumpeting it as an innovative measure. More teachers are needed as the population increases in any event. There is provision for 900 extra resource teachers and 115 SNAs from January 2017. Deputy Burton outlined the €35 million for higher education. Fianna Fáil said it wanted €100 million. I am not sure how the figure went to €35 million but I am sure there will be some engagement on it in future. For the €268 million we were going to provide through our costings, we would, inter alia, have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio at primary school level by one point at a cost of €6 million and reduced it at second level to 18:1 in general and 17.25:1 in DEIS schools at a cost of €15.7 million. This year, most school principals contacted Members of the House because they are finding themselves increasingly constrained in trying to teach while also handling administration and increasing numbers of pastoral issues. For €4.2 million, the budget could have provided every teaching principal with one administration day per week. It is a modest amount in terms of the impact it could have had. The national training fund has been increased by €21 million to address demographic growth at third level. Additional funding could have been provided for the technological universities along with €30 million capital for minor works and the investment in equipment. Something beyond the mere demographic adjustment was required. We all recognise that every budget allows for demographic changes but it is necessary to be a little bit more imaginative than that. That is why there is a sense of disappointment on this side of the House in regard to education where more could have been done. Postgraduate grants could have been reinstated for instance. It would have cost €40 million and had a tremendous effect for taxpayers throughout the country. For €10 million, 2,000 additional apprenticeships could have been created. The schools building programme could have been expanded by €50 million. We talk about climate change and the greening of our economy. For €24 million, solar panels could have been provided to schools. The full cost of that measure over time would be approximately €100 million. This is a budget which has failed to deliver a significant impact for most people. It was telegraphed to us early this morning and most people will have found that it fails to deliver much by way of a societal impact. It is not delivering a whole pile in terms of their incomes. They will not feel an increase in their incomes as a result of the budget and they will not feel an increase in the levels of services for which they have paid heavily through taxation. That is why we are saying it lacks imagination in terms of what could have been done. In terms of the concept of decency at work, the Government could have changed the mandate of the Low Pay Commission. We proposed a target of a minimum wage of 60% of the median earnings by 2021 to deliver a living wage for all. Instead, what we got was a 10 cent increase in the minimum wage, which will be eroded by inflation in 2017. More imagination in this area could have resulted in an amendment to the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission, which would have had an impact. We wanted to do more in regard to transport. The Government has announced €15 million in current expenditure and €55 million in capital expenditure to increase the subvention, which is welcome on one level. However, at a cost of €1.2 million, the Government could have delivered a 2% increase in the subvention to Dublin Bus, to Bus Éireann at a cost of €1.8 million and to Iarnród Éireann at a cost of €2.2 million. In terms of the immediate approval of all national road projects where planning has commenced, we proposed a spend of €61 million and for the road network from Cork to Limerick and Galway, an additional €10 million this year to bring the project to a planning stage. If the Government is serious about regional development - the Action Plan for Jobs states it wants to create 350,000 jobs outside of Dublin - then proper infrastructure is required. We need to develop the Atlantic corridor, which includes the line between Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Tralee and Kerry. It is very important for regional development and nationally as well. In my remaining time, I wish to discuss the help-to-buy scheme. I took some soundings from first-time buyers who cannot get on to the first rung of the housing ladder. The couples to whom I spoke are young. They come into our constituency offices and tell us they cannot get on the first rung of the ladder. Their early analysis of the help-to-buy scheme is that if a sunset clause of December 2019 was applied to the scheme, in real terms it would mean that more people would seek to take advantage of the scheme which would result in a system whereby first-time buyers would be competing against each other. It is a Darwinian theory. The scheme is unworkable and unfair on those couples. They are already stressed to the hilt by virtue of the fact they cannot get on the first rung of the ladder. I do not know what €600,000 would buy in terms of a starter home. I do not know what the logic of that figure is. Maybe in south Dublin or in the bastions of Fine Gael, there are such price ranges. The people we represent will not be buying starter homes for €600,000. The scheme needs to be worked through. I am always inherently suspicious when I hear the Construction Industry Federation welcoming a scheme. One could argue that it will have an inflationary effect on the cost of housing, which is something we have to prevent. We need a bit of equity. Information we have states that no rebate will be paid on house purchases in excess of €600,000. I do not know the logic of the Minister's position on that. The threshold for rental income in the rent-a-room scheme has increased by €2,000 to bring it from €12,000 to €14,000. What will the effect of that be? It will increase rents for people who are renting rooms in houses right across the country. Where is the logic in that? This is a do nothing budget and has been designed by a do nothing Government and a do nothing Dáil. It will not provide any real material benefit for the vast majority of people. It will actually work against a large swathe of people, in particular young people who want to get on to the first rung of the housing ladder. They will look at the budget and say there is nothing here for them.

19288	SeanSherlock	Labour	16016.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	107	 As Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I am pleased that the first budget of this Government is taking the necessary steps to support our entrepreneurs and SMEs. I am acutely aware of the economic impact of our SMEs. Over 235,000 active enterprises in Ireland are micro and small enterprises, and this makes up almost 99% of all active enterprises and nearly 50% of private sector employment. Those jobs are spread across all counties and regions. We need to continue to reward and encourage those risk takers who start a business and those who continue to take risks in creating and growing jobs. I welcome the improvements the Minister for Finance has made to the CGT entrepreneur relief, lowering the rate from 20% to 10%. I also welcome the Minister's signal that he will review the €1 million lifetime limit in future budgets. As Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I will continue to advocate for an improved tax regime to support those businesses that are taking risks and employing people. As Deputies know, regional job creation has been a priority for the Government. We want to ensure that all regions, cities and towns are facilitated in achieving their economic potential. That is what the eight regional action plans for jobs are all about. They are about getting things working from the bottom up and bringing private and public sector interests together to implement plans and deliver new ideas. The aim of these plans is to create almost 250,000 jobs across all regions by 2020. With 45,000 jobs created last year, this leaves 200,000 jobs to be achieved by the end of 2020, including 135,000 outside Dublin in all the regions. That will support the proposals of Deputies opposite who live outside Dublin. This is all part of the programme for Government. Results so far are very encouraging. Since the first quarter of 2015, the national employment rate has fallen from 10% to 8.6% and all eight regions have recorded a reduction in the rate of unemployment over that period. The Government continues to support the regional jobs agenda, with the largest enterprise allocation in over a decade. IDA Ireland will see its capital funding grow by 22% to €137 million. Some of the additional moneys will enable it to progress three more advanced facilities in the regions, with new builds planned for Dundalk, Limerick and Galway next year. On the Enterprise Ireland side, an additional allocation of €5 million in competitive funding was announced in June for 48 local and regional initiatives. A further €3 million was announced for a regional accelerator scheme for areas outside Dublin. In 2017, Enterprise Ireland will continue to roll out additional competitive regional funds to support collaborative approaches to job creation across the regions. To ensure a very strong focus on regional development, the capital allocation to the local enterprise offices is also increasing by €4 million, from €18.5 million to €22.5 million. This recognises their potential to generate start-ups and job creation in the regions. The additional funding demonstrates the programme for Government's commitment to achieve regional balance in the delivery of jobs. Brexit will present a significant challenges for us, as many speakers have said. The fall in sterling has hardened my resolve to work to deal with the challenges which Brexit poses to companies in Ireland. Volatility in exchange rates always presents challenges and I am particularly conscious of the scale and impact on the indigenous sector. Over the medium to long term, exchange rate volatility highlights the importance of focusing on a wide spectrum of competitive policies, in particular policies to enhance competition and productivity. A competitive and sustainable base can help to provide a buffer zone against exchange rate fluctuations and other uncontrollable external factors. With our plan to grow the number of jobs supported by the enterprise agencies, additional resources have been provided in the budget for 2017, primarily for staff resources for Enterprise Ireland in the context of Brexit. Enterprise Ireland is being provided with a total Exchequer capital allocation of €185 million. Some €63 million of this, an increase of 12%, is focusing on general enterprise development and business supports and €122 million, an increase of 3.7%, is for its research and development supported activities. I welcome the extra resources Enterprise Ireland will benefit from, in order to support its clients in the face of Brexit.

19290	SeanSherlock	Labour	16023.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	" I congratulate Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Their long running show is more like a documentary. On the one hand, Fianna Fáil is knocking Fine Gael for the budget, yet its Deputies will probably sit on their hands and support it very shortly. This is not a good budget for Ireland. It is certainly not a good budget for anybody under 26. It is certainly not a good budget for pensioners. If one is part of the squeezed middle, it certainly is not a very good budget. It was mentioned a while ago that it was not appropriate to give the under-26s the extra freaky fiver, as we will call it. If one puts oneself into the position of a 22 or 23 year old who has a part-time job, is probably living at home, has borrowed money from the credit union and is paying back a loan, a fiver makes an awful lot of a difference. It has not been put into perspective. I had a phone call the other night at 9.20 p.m. from an 83 year old gentleman who was so disgusted with the fiver that I actually thought it was my fault. He said, ""I don't want it, Pat, give it to the kids."" There is a sense of anger. I do not think Deputies in the Chamber realise what damage has been done to ordinary working people and to real working families. There has to be a reality check here. Again today in the Chamber I listened to the leader of Fianna Fáil criticise the Fine Gael leader on investment in health and mental health. Yet, a number of weeks ago when we proposed to do something about it, Fianna Fáil Deputies sat on their hands. There is no political will in this Chamber. I also heard the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, state a number of days ago when we were discussing the budget that Fianna Fáil did not write the budget. I can certainly say that Fianna Fáil coloured it in because it has the hallmark of both parties. We know what will happen in a couple of days' time. It beggars belief that there could not have been a better way on this budget. It should have been about investing in our country by investing in public services, housing, roads, broadband and schools. Establishing the knock-on effect of this is not rocket science. The Government has to invest in real jobs, give people an opportunity to earn real money and improve the services we have. They are all paying tax. It is not rocket science. The knock-on effect of that would be that the Government would address the problems in housing and our education system. It would certainly take the stress off the health service by investing in people. It goes back to one thing. Each and every one of these people would actually have proper, paid jobs so they could pay taxes. It is about making a fairer and more affordable system for our citizens. The Government had an opportunity to do it but unfortunately we stick to the status quo here which is very unfortunate. Big bang budgets were also mentioned. Perhaps it is not a big bang budget for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil but it was certainly a big bang budget for under-26s, pensioners and what the Government classes as the squeezed middle. That is the reality of this budget. We have to empathise with people outside this Chamber. Even as a newly elected Deputy, I understand the notion of being in a bubble, but we actually leave the bubble now and again and engage with real people. We are here as elected representatives to work on behalf of the people we represent. I have a son at home who will be a teenager very shortly. He is excited about trying to go out and get a job and save up for his first car. This budget does not give much hope to the young people of today. It has deflated the people we should probably respect the most in this country, that is our ageing population, which is on the rise. They are the people who built this country. We should be planning ahead for this but we are not. We are going back to the same old status quo, specifically targeting certain areas. Deputy Doherty mentioned the figure of €20 million a while back. That could have been used in a more productive way. We can discuss figures and numbers, but we have listened to the debate over the last few days and it just seems to be repetitive. I spoke to a gentleman last Friday at my clinic in Midleton. He asked me what it is like up here. I said, ""It is 100 mph, it is difficult but it can be rewarding."" He asked me to do him a favour. He said, ""When you go into the Chamber, will you speak plain English? Do not be intoxicated by the exuberance of somebody's vocabulary."" I laughed. The reason I laughed is the people do not need fancy terms. They do not need all of this colouring in and shading of numbers. They want the brass-tacks truth, and the brass-tacks truth of this budget is that it is not good for the young people of this country and is certainly not good for this country's sick people, pensioners or the squeezed middle. When there is another election, I hope people will remember what has happened in this Chamber. We can debate this budget at length, but at times one feels one is wasting time because the outcome will not be good for the people who put their faith in us. I could talk for longer, but it is very difficult. We in this Chamber will be judged on merit. When the next election is held I hope and pray that, please God, the young people, pensioners and the squeezed middle of this country will remember this."
19291	SeanSherlock	Labour	16029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-25 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	350	 I welcome the Minister's comprehensive reply detailing both the humanitarian response from Ireland's perspective and the multilateral political engagement at the United Nations. Ireland has, through its taxpayers, significantly invested in alleviating the humanitarian crisis since 2012. The Minister referenced the figure of €62 million committed so far. We had a debate on this issue last week and there was supposed to be a ceasefire last weekend. The United Nations had been hoping to use it to evacuate seriously wounded people and deliver aid, but that does not appear to have happened. Has the Minister given consideration to the fact that no aid has been delivered in Aleppo since 7 July? The UN Secretary General said food would run out, possibly by the end of this month. What is the Minister's view on this stark fact? What Srebrenica was to the 1990s, Aleppo is to the 2010s and the western world, in particular, the United States and others actors in the field, despite their best efforts from a humanitarian aid point of view, need to up their game in terms of political engagement

19295	SeanSherlock	Labour	16037.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-02 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	 Short of a breakthrough at the Labour Court today, we are all now expecting a full Garda strike on Friday. A total of 564 Garda stations throughout the country will lie empty. Serious questions about the safety of our communities deserve a more forthcoming response than we have yet received. Things look no better on the schools front with the possibility that 507 second level schools will lie empty from next week, potentially for an indefinite period. It goes without saying that we in the Labour Party hopes a resolution will be found with gardaí today. We believe it did not need to be like this. For weeks now Deputy Howlin has proposed a range of alternatives. The most significant of these is the establishment of a social dialogue that would involve public servants in discussions relating to public service provision as well as pay. That proposal is now receiving widespread support. As the architect of the Haddington Road and the Lansdowne Road agreements, the Deputy has also argued that we need to begin negotiations formally for a successor deal to the Lansdowne Road agreement. That would accelerate pay restoration for all public servants. Finally, yesterday we at least received confirmation that this will happen during 2017. We have also argued, and the Seanad has agreed to this, that an employer labour conference should be established. It is our view that the Government has waited too long to take any meaningful action. We keep hearing the mantra that the Lansdowne Road agreement is the only show in town. As I have made clear, we hope that a resolution will be found with gardaí today, but even if that is the case, at this stage it is abundantly clear that the Government's mantra is not good enough. We need mechanisms that will avoid such disputes from becoming increasingly common. We need to keep teachers in classrooms, nurses in hospitals and gardaí on the beat. The more than 300,000 public servants who work in various sectors need to be at work and not on strike. During the worst period of our history we managed to preserve industrial peace. It is beyond belief how the Government has allowed this situation to regress so rapidly. This week the impact of industrial unrest seems likely to become very real. My questions to the Taoiseach are as follows. Of the range of ideas proposed by the Labour Party to prevent growing industrial unrest, will he seriously consider any of them? Will he explain how the outworkings of the public service pay commission will feed into the potential successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement, if at all? Will he provide more detailed information on the contingency arrangements that are being put in place in the event of a strike on Friday?
