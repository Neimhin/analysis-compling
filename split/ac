2153	SeanSherlock	Labour	12713.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter: the proposal under the national cancer strategy to close 13 cancer services located throughout the country, particularly breast cancer services at Mallow General Hospital.
2154	SeanSherlock	Labour	12713.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	 There are two aspects to the question put down by the Deputy.  The first relates to siltation at the harbour and in this regard a Dumping at Sea Permit was issued to the council on 22 December 2006 to facilitate maintenance dredging. The second aspect relates to the drafting and acceptance by the relevant parties of a lease in respect of the proposed breakwater at Buncrana.  The council requested a reduction or total waiver of foreshore charges on the basis that the facility was to be used by the RNLI. Following extensive discussions and as an exceptional matter, the Department, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, informed the council that it would consider waiving the rental charges if the council could confirm that the proposed facility would be for the exclusive use of the RNLI.   In addition, the council was also informed that if it was unable to confirm that the facility would be used exclusively by the RNLI, the Department was prepared to apply a reduced rental charge based on the ratio of usage of the facility by the RNLI. On 20th December last the council confirmed that the works being proposed at Buncrana Harbour are being constructed solely for the use of the RNLI and are not being constructed for the benefit of any other party.    On foot of this confirmation the Department entered into detailed discussions and correspondence with the Chief State Solicitor's Office with a view to preparing an appropriate draft lease, which will best facilitate the council's proposal and also safeguard the State's ongoing interest in the management and protection of the foreshore in the public interest. The draft lease will involve the insertion of specific conditions, which will reflect the fact that the arrangements involved are unusual and are based on the need to provide a permanent location for the RNLI, which will enable the launch of their boat on a 24-hour basis.  The Department's discussions with the Chief State Solicitor's Office have focussed on the public interest provisions of the Foreshore Acts, the proposed arrangements which the Council will need to make with the RNLI and other legal issues designed to protect the interests of all parties.  The lease, when drafted, will require the agreement of all relevant parties. Every effort is being made to expedite the completion of the draft lease and, to that end, a further meeting has been scheduled between my Department and the County Council to further clarify outstanding issues. 
2155	SeanSherlock	Labour	12718.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	163	 I sincerely thank the leaders of all the political parties, of all persuasions, for those kind and wonderful words.  I thank too the staff of the House whose expressions of sympathy in the past few weeks have made us proud of the fact that when our father was a Member, he acquitted himself well, was well liked and did his best for the people he represented. Our grief for our father is personal but to be able to share it so publicly in many respects and that so many have expressed sympathy with us leaves us proud.  Our hearts are warmed by the fact that the man endeared himself to so many. I cannot say too much today but with the indulgence of the House will read some lines from a letter I received from a former colleague and dear friend of my father's who campaigned with him over many years: Joe epitomised for me all that is good, fine and noble in politics.  I was so moved to hear you speak so proudly on Thursday [the day of the funeral] about his genuine commitment to the Republicanism of Wolfe Tone and of the French Revolution, of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, because that was what I saw Joe Sherlock live when I had the privilege of working with him.  He was an instinctive socialist, and found ease with the noble of spirit and of heart.  He thought and fought from the heart.  He could readily distinguish between nationalism and republicanism, and always knew a sham when it presented.  His was an abiding humanity, a part of himself that he could not detach or shake off.  His volcanic ability for anger never failed.  He never had to feign it — his honesty valve was set so high! For the very many of us who had the privilege of walking in Joe's considerable shadow, I must say that it was a rare privilege.  It was enriching and exciting.  He gave hope and leadership, and enabled persons to dream, and to believe that there was and is a better way of doing things.  One of the other great ironies is that while Joe was never in government, he achieved more for the people of North Cork as a campaigning politician than a Mercedes full of government ministers ever have — he made a real impact on people's lives. We should not forget Joe, and though his main monument is built in our hearts, we must not leave his inspiration slip.
2156	SeanSherlock	Labour	12718.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	163	 All monies have been paid to the group on the basis of the vouched eligible capital expenditure documentation it submitted to my Department. Under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS), projects were approved for a capped amount of grant aid based on the project and financial plans.  The draw down of such grant aid was, however, conditional on the production of documentation to vouch that the requisite eligible capital expenditure had been incurred within one year of the grant approval offer.  There was no mechanism under the GBS for the award of supplementary payments to groups where a shortfall occurred between the vouched eligible expenditure incurred and the grant amount originally offered.
2157	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	229	 I raised this question in the context that Ireland has up to €8.1 billion in food exports on an annual basis.  Recently we saw that approximately 1.3 million tonnes of pigmeat are imported from outside the EU into Ireland and then branded and packaged here.  My question is based on the fact that Irish pig producers are rapidly going into decline because long-established brands are being marketed in such a way as to give the impression that they use Irish pig meat.  The European Union is currently reviewing the conditions and I understand the issue may be only within the competence of the Union.  However, the Government has a certain responsibility in the issue.  If there is no provision in our law to amend legislation, I call on the Government to ensure that labelling, through marketing and Bord Bia, is done in such a way as to ensure that where a consumer purchases a product perceived to be Irish, a clear label is attached to the product attesting to that fact.  This has serious implications for pig producers and I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the Government is making provisions in that regard.
2158	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 Is the Minister aware that Galtee Foods in Mitchelstown, a company that has sustained people in the area for many years, recently closed?  One of the main reasons is the clear perception among consumers that, though its products were branded as Irish, they were imported and the Galtee brand has diminished in stature as a result.  It is a result of a certain degree of Government intransigence on the issue that we now see the demise of a traditional company and the Government needs to do more to ensure the industry, which has sustained many farming families for a long time, is supported.
2159	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 I preface my question by stating the strong belief within my party that the loss of an industry that sustained many farm families and industrial workers throughout the land for generations was a travesty. I put it to the Minister that the Indecon report, on which the Government based its recommendations, was incorrect.  The Government, therefore, cost taxpayers untold sums of money and put them through the process of going to the High Court which subsequently reversed the decision.  It was utterly needless and a waste of taxpayers' money.  Will the Minister respond on that issue?  The fundamental question is when the restructuring package will be introduced and the growers paid.  What level of consultation has there been with growers on the issue?  Has there been final and full agreement on the matter?
2160	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	259	 The Indecon report is important.  I want to find out exactly how much the Indecon report cost the taxpayer, how much it cost to go to the High Court.  The issue here concerns the public purse and how moneys are expended on behalf of taxpayers.  Can the Minister guarantee that Greencore will not challenge this decision which, although it has been taken at a political level, has yet to go through the board of Greencore?  It should be stated that the Minister is a shareholder or has a golden share in that company.
2161	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	303	 We have heard the quintessential civil servant's answer.  Every farmer takes responsibility for ragwort or any noxious weed.  Nevertheless, it exists extensively throughout the country.  One can have all the public awareness and information campaigns in the world, but action is needed. Would the Minister consider funding local authorities to ensure this blight is wiped out, particularly on roadside verges?  Farmers and landowners take responsibility for noxious weeks when they occur on their land.
2162	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	350	 I take the view that the glass is half full but there is a trend in Irish agriculture of flight from the land.  This is largely due to global trends.
2163	SeanSherlock	Labour	12719.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-03 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 The WTO is influenced mainly by global corporations and that has an effect on small Irish family farms.  Will the Minister bear that in mind when she attends WTO talks or Council of Ministers' meetings?

2171	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter of public interest: the serious economic and employment implications for the Cork East constituency and Cork in general following the announcement that the Amgen project which was to deliver more than 1,000 jobs is not to proceed, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the background to the decision and the steps he intends to take to ensure the project proceeds or is replaced as a matter of urgency.
2172	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	 On a point of order, considerable amounts of taxpayers' money have been expended on attracting this industry to Cork East and the people of the region——
2173	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	 ——want to know exactly how much was spent.  We are seeking to bring the Minister before the House so that we can have an opportunity to ask him those relevant questions.
2174	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	283	 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The announcement by Amgen has come as a body-blow to the east Cork region.  The economic loss to Carrigtwohill and surrounding areas is unquantifiable.  I empathise with those people who have lost their jobs in the company.  While global corporate entities like Amgen are subject to the vagaries of international markets, the people of the region accepted in good faith statements made by the company in April that a delay of two years in the project would not amount to a complete cessation of it.  I put it to the Minister that a second announcement yesterday to the effect that the project is indefinitely postponed is nothing more than spin and a deliberate attempt to play down the decision not to proceed.  Anyone with common sense must conclude that two postponements in six months is tantamount to a cessation. The Government has serious questions to answer.  Questions arise as to whether Amgen or IDA Ireland is the beneficial owner of the site at which the project was to proceed.  We must also ask what will happen to the site in the event of a further postponement or acknowledgement of cessation.  The project was to be the mainstay of the region and Middleton, Youghal and other centres of population had placed their bets on it.  Many young people invested in housing in the region on foot of the promise of foreign direct investment by Amgen.  I put it to the Minister that we have been dealt a hammer blow and that people are extremely disappointed.  Expectation in this context has not been managed well by the Government, which now has a serious case to answer.  The Minister has a responsibility to deliver to the people of the region.
2175	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	 Am I allowed to make a point of order?
2176	SeanSherlock	Labour	12720.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 On a point of order, the Minister said he is teasing out the ownership of the site.

A total of 170 civil servants have committed to decentralise to these locations under the Programme.  110 of these are Dublin based and included in the total figure are 14 staff who have committed to decentralise on promotion and 23 new recruits. The Decentralisation Programme included the relocation of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), involving 42 Dublin based posts, to Dundalk.  SEI plans to have an advance party of staff based in Dundalk ahead of the permanent move.  Two SEI personnel have taken up decentralised posts in Dundalk and the target is to have a further 10 to 13 staff in decentralised posts relocated from Dublin by end 2007.  Of these additional staff, 3-5 are expected to be new recruits. In relation to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), the Decentralisation Programme initially provided for the relocation, from Dublin to Clonakilty, of four Sea Fishery Officer posts and one Seafood Control Manager post of the then Seafood Control Division of the Department from Dublin to Clonakilty.  The subsequent establishment of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority overtook the plans in place for decentralisation.  Under the relevant legislation all technical staff of the former Seafood Control Division were designated for transfer to the SFPA along with the voluntary secondment of administrative staff for a limited period of time. In effect the establishment of SFPA superseded the plan initially in place to decentralise Seafood Control Division as part of the Departmental divisions going to Clonakilty.  As regards the Central Fisheries Board no staff have to date taken up a post in the decentralised location, two staff have taken up posts, which are due to decentralise.  There are no staff appointed on promotion or recruitment to decentralising posts.  There are no staff members of an Bord Iascaigh Mhara relocated thus far, nor are there any staff recruited or promoted for decentralised posts.

2196	SeanSherlock	Labour	12733.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-17 00:00:00	Prelude	374	 Under the Government's Decentralisation Programme it is planned that the Marine functions of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will relocate to Clonakilty with the remaining functions moving to Cavan.  A total of 170 civil servants have committed to decentralise to these locations under the Programme.  110 of these are Dublin based and included in the total figure are 14 staff who have committed to decentralise on promotion and 23 new recruits. The Decentralisation Programme included the relocation of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), involving 42 Dublin based posts, to Dundalk.  SEI plans to have an advance party of staff based in Dundalk ahead of the permanent move.  Two SEI personnel have taken up decentralised posts in Dundalk and the target is to have a further 10 to 13 staff in decentralised posts relocated from Dublin by end 2007.  Of these additional staff, 3-5 are expected to be new recruits. In relation to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), the Decentralisation Programme initially provided for the relocation, from Dublin to Clonakilty, of four Sea Fishery Officer posts and one Seafood Control Manager post of the then Seafood Control Division of the Department from Dublin to Clonakilty.  The subsequent establishment of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority overtook the plans in place for decentralisation.  Under the relevant legislation all technical staff of the former Seafood Control Division were designated for transfer to the SFPA along with the voluntary secondment of administrative staff for a limited period of time. In effect the establishment of SFPA superseded the plan initially in place to decentralise Seafood Control Division as part of the Departmental divisions going to Clonakilty.  As regards the Central Fisheries Board no staff have to date taken up a post in the decentralised location, two staff have taken up posts, which are due to decentralise.  There are no staff appointed on promotion or recruitment to decentralising posts.  There are no staff members of an Bord Iascaigh Mhara relocated thus far, nor are there any staff recruited or promoted for decentralised posts.

2198	SeanSherlock	Labour	12739.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	287	" I wish to share time with Deputies Martin Ferris and Mary Upton. If Deputies Doyle and Connaughton are selling those calves, they might give me a shout because I am thinking of increasing my herd by 200%. I speak in support of the Fine Gael motion.  Between 2005 and 2006, the agrifood sector accounted for 163,400 jobs, or 8.1% of the working population.  Irish agrifood exports accounted for more than €8 billion.  As a country we discount the importance of this sector of the economy at our peril.  At a time when increased consolidation of the agrifood sector is driving the market, we must not forget the importance of ensuring that consumer interests are maintained.  We must also continue to ensure that the protection of consumer health lies at the core of agriculture and food policy. In recent times, the standards set for Irish farmers in the production of beef and pig meat are not being subscribed to by producers from third countries who have access to Irish and European markets.  In essence, Irish farmers are being asked to ensure that their produce is of the highest standard before going to market while their counterparts in countries outside the European Union can compete on an uneven playing field.  The regulatory framework is clearly not working in this instance.  The EU legislative framework, as it stands, works against the Irish farm family and the competitiveness of Irish agriculture is compromised as a result.  More important, the health of the Irish consumer is compromised if there is so much as the slightest doubt about the standard of produce being imported into Irish markets from third countries.  Brazilian beef is a case in point.  Brazilian producers in many instances produce to the highest standard but there are legitimate concerns about the traceability and production methods of some Brazilian beef which finds its way on to Irish tables. This motion rightly calls for a regulatory framework to ensure that all operators produce to the highest standard.  As a country, we must ensure our competitive advantage in the production of beef.  If third country producers are not operating to the same standard as ours and if there is a risk to the Irish and European consumer, the EU Food and Veterinary Office must be given the legislative teeth to expedite a ban or other such mechanism within a reasonable timeframe to address the concerns of Irish farm families and consumers.  Government policy on the protection of consumers in so far as it pertains to guarding against health risks in food importation is too weak at present. On substantial transformation, I realise that responsibility for the enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The issue of substantial transformation, whereby a primary product can enter Ireland, be processed in some way and subsequently be branded as Irish, is governed by EU legislation.  However, it is not good enough that the Government would hide behind EU legislation in tackling this problem, nor is it good enough for the Minister to say it can only be amended at EU level.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled on 3 October last, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent, expressed the following concern: ... this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and the Minister has raised our concerns at EU Council level. If the Minister of State shares my concerns, we need to know how he will address them and what proactive measures he will take to ensure the viability of producers and confidence of consumers, who should be the primary concern.  It is not sufficient for him to say: ""The concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem."" A weak legislative base on labelling allows consumers to be duped into believing products of the kind in question are of Irish origin.  The Government's primary concern must be to protect the health of consumers and ensure the competitiveness of Irish farming.  In seeking to be proactive on this matter, we must work with the farming organisations and processors to ensure that the quality assurance mark takes pride of place on every packet leaving the factory floor.  A clear marketing strategy, with a strengthening of legislation, is the key to solving this problem. On 3 October last I asked the Minister if she would amend legislation to ensure that foodstuffs of foreign origin would not be labelled as ""produced in Ireland"", ""processed in Ireland"" or ""sourced and produced in Ireland"".  I asked the question to remedy the circumstances whereby consumer and producer interests are not being protected and to ensure that our comparative advantage as a nation would be maintained.  I realise the Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and that food labelling is governed by Directive 2000/13/EC. The Government stated in response to the Commission paper Labelling, Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation for the EU, published in 2002, that there is an unsatisfactory practice at play regarding substantive transformation.  The Government made certain recommendations in this regard but they have not come to fruition.  Why has the Commission not acted on the Irish recommendations to date and why has the Minister not been more proactive on the matter?  The Commission is now preparing to forward proposals but I understand this involves a co-decision procedure.  We could be back in this House in 12 months still with no resolution to the issue of substantial transformation.  I urge the Minister to fast-track the process, where possible."
2199	SeanSherlock	Labour	12739.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	291	 On 29 September last, the Irish Farmers Journal reported that Reox Holdings, a subsidiary of Dairygold, was in the process of selling Breeo Foods.  Breeo Foods carries top brands such as Dairygold, Shaws, Galtee Meats, Roscrea, Mitchelstown, Calvita and Sno.  These brands are long-established in the minds of consumers and are perceived to be Irish in origin and content.  The truth is otherwise and some of these brands are marketed in a way that suggests they are Irish.  In the minds of pig producers and workers in Mitchelstown and beyond, the closure of Galtee Foods was as a direct result of substantial transformation. If there is to be no provision in Irish law to amend legislation in the short term, the Government should ensure that labelling, through a proper marketing strategy by Bord Bia, will be implemented clearly.  The Government must also allow open access to those plants that are being marketed by Bord Bia to ensure that the content of all produce is as it says on the packet or tin.  I am not ashamed to say we must protect our national interest.  We have a comparative advantage over other countries and we must maintain this competitive edge.  The future of Irish agriculture depends upon it. It is not my job to criticise the Government for the sake of criticism but it is necessary to critically assess its response to agricultural issues as they arise.  The Labour Party is not against the science of genetic modification and does not adopt a fundamentalist view thereon.  We believe biotechnology can coexist with natural biodiversity without compromising the latter.  It is in this context that we seek to ensure that the competitiveness of Irish agriculture is maintained.  With that in mind, it is beyond our comprehension that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food chose to abstain from a crucial vote on genetically modified animal feeds at a meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels last month.  The Minister's logic for this abstention, that is, that it did not affect the eventual outcome, is beyond belief. We welcome the fact that the European Commission will move to approve genetically modified feed imports.  The internal party machinations of the Green Party are of no concern to us.  What is of concern to us is the need to ensure that the EU scientific committee moves at a pace that is in keeping with the market and provides for a level playing pitch for Irish agriculture.  The Government's intransigence on this issue, by way of abdicating its responsibility, is grossly negligent and undermines our ability to negotiate on further matters of this nature. We support the Fine Gael motion.  It marks a pragmatic approach to the best means of maintaining the competitiveness of Irish agriculture while protecting the right of consumers to perfect knowledge of their purchases and ensures that Irish farming families can compete on a level playing pitch.

The company has had two postponements.  On 15 October, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin met with Amgen.  The people of Carrigtwohill and the region want to find out what the future holds for Amgen.  Is it in a position to state whether it will proceed with the plant?  If anybody is to be accused of playing politics with this issue it is the members of the Minister's party and his backbenchers.

If Amgen is retaining ownership of the site, the people of the region will want to know why it is doing so when they have postponed the project twice.  Is the Minister continuing negotiations with Amgen?  Will Amgen make a final decision on its intentions in a reasonable time?  The people of the region want to know where Amgen is going?  If it does not locate within the site will someone else do so? Given that €4 million has been expended to attract this industry, a legitimate question hangs over the use of taxpayers' money to attract industry.  The Amgen project could be used as a benchmark for foreign direct investment projects throughout the country and for global trends in industries of that nature.  If the global financial and economic infrastructure is changing and Amgen can make a sudden decision of this nature, questions must be posed regarding the nature of foreign direct investment throughout Ireland.  That is why we are asking these questions.

2217	SeanSherlock	Labour	12747.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-10-31 00:00:00	Prelude	563	" He would have given me more time but I am sure he will address the salient points in the argument. There is a gross disparity resulting from the outsourcing of driver testing to private companies.  The list of centres on the on-line driving application form on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, website does not include every centre to which drivers may apply.  I know of people who waited months for their test only to be informed by telephone that it had been outsourced to a private company at a test centre other than the one to which they had applied.  They received no notification of this change in writing. Applicants who move to live in another part of the country encounter serious difficulties in transferring their application to test centres at their new location.  I know a man who applied for a driving test in Tallaght where he was living but who later moved permanently to Mallow.  He sought in writing to do his test at the Mallow test centre.  Since then he has received two test dates from SGS in Tallaght.  He has received no correspondence acknowledging his request to change test centres.  SGS management told him it had nothing to do with the contract for testing in Cork.  He will soon have to move to his third provisional licence before receiving a driving test date. The testing system is farcical and until this is sorted out, the rate of fully qualified drivers will increase only marginally, not at the rate the Government and the RSA anticipate, certainly not in the ten week timescale determined by the Minister or, as he put it, ""on demand""."

The timelines are as we anticipated and I welcome the establishment of the consultative committee.  I refer the Minister to a speech given by Commissioner Fischer Boel in Paris last month.  She referred to the Health Check, the strengthening of competitiveness, supporting rural society and so on.  It was all very aspirational in its aims.  Farmers are worried about the issues of cross-compliance and modulation under the single payment scheme and, particularly, whether the Commission will place upper or lower limits on payments to them under the scheme in the context of the Health Check.  They are worried about the nature of cross compliance and the stringent controls under which they are placed.

I appreciate the fact that Bord Bia and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs through the Leader programme are doing much to encourage farmers' markets.  However, on the ground, many farmers' markets are striving — I will not say they are struggling — to boost their popularity locally.  Much of this work is done through voluntary effort.  While programmes are in place through Leader to help them, if some sort of direct support was made available to them for advertising through local media, it would be of great assistance to them. Judging from the Minister of State's answer, he is not telling me that his Department necessarily will be directly responsible for that and I accept this point.  I also accept the fact that there is serious potential within this country for the growth of local markets.  Will the Minister of State consider the idea of direct finance for marketing and advertising?

The €25m Salmon Hardship Scheme adopted by Government is intended to provide a measure of relief to individiuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of mixed stock fishing for wild salmon. The overall sum takes account of the levels of payment recommended by the Independent Group and the recorded catch history of the eligible licensees. An additional €5 million is being provided under a Community Support Scheme, the focus of which primarily will be those communities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric of the area.

If this Bill is to mean anything, it must ensure funding is effective and will trickle down through the various divisions within Cork County Council and its engineering areas. What we have seen to date is that roads prioritised under Transport 21 receive funding, which is welcome, but non-national roads or secondary roads receive no funding whatsoever.  The N72 and N73 are particular examples.  If we are to take Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, which are on those routes, one will serve the main tourist route between Waterford and Killarney and the other will serve the main route from Kanturk, west of Mallow and through to Dublin. Mallow currently has hub-town status but we are not getting the trickle-down effect of financial incentives to create the northern relief road, which is vital to a town like Mallow and its surrounding areas in terms of its attractiveness for inward investment and the creation of infrastructure around the town. We need a change in policy and funding for roads such as these.  They are vital arteries for towns such as Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, but they have become dangerous roads because of a lack of proper funding.  To travel the road from Mallow to Mitchelstown on a day such as today, in some instances one is taking one's life in one's hands.  Two lorries cannot pass each other comfortably on some parts of the road without stopping or slowing down to speeds of 5 km/h or 10 km/h.  That speaks volumes about the Government not investing properly in such infrastructure. Deputy Ferris spoke of community involvement and local improvement schemes.  There is almost a begging-bowl mentality in this regard for public representatives such as myself.  I have to go cap in hand to local area engineers to seek funding or to have certain roads prioritised within divisional engineering areas, which is completely ludicrous in this day and age.  If people pay road tax and a development contribution for the building of a house in a rural part of the county, I do not see why they should have to pay extra to have a road included in a local improvement or community involvement scheme.  These people should have the same rights and entitlements as any other citizen of this State to have the road outside their houses in an acceptable condition. The Cork to Limerick road also speaks volumes about Government policy, as we in Mallow and north Cork have been waiting for this northern relief road but are almost at the mercy of Transport 21 and the funding streams of the NRA.  There is also the question of whether the NRA will get the requisite funding to be able to create the Atlantic corridor between Cork and Limerick, and whether a spur will be created for the northern relief road. These are policy issues as to how funding is implemented at the local level but they have a great effect on people's lives.  That is what we are speaking to in debating this legislation.  Will a change in legislation bring about a marked increase in the quality of people's lives, as we must ensure it does? I spoke about development contributions and the current funding of local government is completely inequitable.  If a young couple applies for planning permission today, they will be levied at exorbitant rates for contributions on the building of their house.  It adds to the cost of building and they do not see a return in terms of increased lighting or improvements in the road surface outside the house.  The money is centralised within the county council and then divvied out through the division.  The northern division of a county council would compete with the southern division for funding into specific areas. The entire area of Government policy as it pertains to roads must be looked at.  If we are to enhance the quality of people's lives, any effect or change in the legislation must ensure this happens.
2232	SeanSherlock	Labour	12761.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-14 00:00:00	Prelude	476	 If the Government's proposals succeed, there will be dire consequences for the provision of not-for-profit child care and the significant contribution made by this sector to our communities will be rolled back.  Any changes to the subvention structure under the national child care investment programme that result in a reduction in staffing levels will mean a reduction in funds available to pay staff in many community-based child care centres.  This possibility contradicts the commitment in the national development plan to provide an additional 28,000 child care places and 8,000 jobs in child care.  It could be argued that this subvention is being introduced in reverse.  That is to say, the highest rate of subvention is being suggested for parents who are in receipt of full social welfare.  If a parent stops receiving social welfare and takes up employment that parent's subvention for child care is reduced.  This reduces the incentive to take up employment. The Government, through its actions, is contradicting its own stated policy.  At present, community child care facilities serve a mix of families reflective of the local community.  If this subvention scheme is implemented according to the current proposals, community child care facilities may be seen as centres at which only the children of social welfare recipients are facilitated.  This is contrary to any social inclusion remit.  How will working families on marginal incomes who are not entitled to any form of State support have access to affordable child care?  Community child care facilities which have been in receipt of staffing grants since 2002 will now be obliged to consider increasing their fees as a result of these measures.  Where is the commitment to quality child care centres and to the benefits of early childhood education and socialisation?  Where is the commitment to the volunteers all over the country who have given of their time, and are still doing so, to find sites, apply for funding, fill in forms, set up services and become employers?  I call on the Government to rethink its proposals and let common sense prevail.

2235	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	99	 In the light of the publication yesterday of the European Commission's proposals on CAP reform and of the health check and given that this is a legislative proposal to which the Government will be a party and which will have serious permutations for Ireland and bring about significant changes with regard to how the farming community and the rural economy develop, will the Government make time available to debate the matter in the House?  Although no specific legislative proposal is due to come before the House, will the Government, in view of the serious nature and importance of the issue, make arrangements for such a debate?
2236	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	 I accept the Taoiseach's point.  The matter will obviously be discussed by the joint committee.  However, in view of its serious nature, it is worthy of a debate in the House.
2237	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	264	 I wish to share time with Deputy Wall.
2238	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	266	 In speaking to this motion one wonders what is the Government's primary motivation in putting it before the House.  It is not a legislative proposal.  It contains no concrete provisions.  It is short on detail and long on aspiration and therein lies the rub.  The Government is high on aspiration but low on delivery.  The motion is so broad that one senses there is a clear agenda by the Government to pay lip service to the idea of addressing the young people's issues throughout this island.  What young people want are concrete legislative proposals that will speak directly to their concerns.  These concerns are well documented and have been brought to Government through representative bodies such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI.  The NYCI is a social partner and the genuineness of this motion will be measured by the Government's response to concerns outlined by groups such as the NYCI.  I fear, however, that this motion is meaningless and full of platitudes and that young people have become used to hearing from a Government about the provision of services. In the limited time afforded to me I wish to address a number of specific areas.  The first relates to the health of children and our young people.  The NYCI, in its budget submission, calls on the Government to deliver on its promise to double the income threshold for full medical card entitlements for parents of children under six years of age in this year's budget.  I believe this is attainable.  The Government must look positively on this proposal.  Approximately 1.1 million children and young people under the age of 18 live in Ireland.  According to the NYCI, only 305,000 of them are covered under the medical card scheme.  Access to a GP is vital to ensure that a young person can avail of services to assist him or her through these difficult years.  A young person needs to be able to do this without incurring a financial cost.  This service would serve as a positive move that would give young people the confidence and independence to avail of vital services but in a way that would ensure confidentiality.  Young people living in rural areas in particular where counselling and other services are not readily available would benefit in particular.  The Government must also look favourably on families with children over the age of seven and under the age of 18 with a view to ensuring that income thresholds are raised to allow more children to avail of primary and secondary health care. The second issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of adequate facilities and services for young people who are in need of counselling and require access to mental health facilities.  In my constituency of Cork East the organisation Lets Get Together was set up to help others affected by suicide and to examine ways of preventing it.  In 2005 the Lets Get Together Foundation linked up with a number of similar organisations throughout the country to set up an all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy, thereby raising awareness of the issue and speaking to local and national media.  If this motion is to mean anything, the Government must assist organisations of this nature.  The highest rate of suicide is found among young men aged under 35 — this age group accounts for 40% of all Irish suicides.  There is a clear lack of a coherent Government policy to encourage young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives to talk to others about it.  The lack of available facts on a range of health and lifestyle issues linking potential users to relevant help services throughout the country is exacerbating the travesty of suicide which has reached epidemic proportions throughout this land.  We have the fifth highest suicide rate in Europe among the 15 to 25 year age group and death by suicide is the number one cause of death among young Irish men.  The Government, if it is serious about this motion, needs to fund more campaigns of representative organisations such as the NYCI, through the primary care strategy, to reduce the large number of deaths by suicide.  Awareness must be raised.  Young people need options and to be able to access them in a safe and non-judgmental manner.  We have all experienced tough times.  Many of us have been fortunate in that we had family and friends to support us.  Not every young person has that luxury.  Issues such as coming out to parents, unexpected pregnancy, low self-esteem and depression need to be tackled in a non-judgmental way. On the issue of unwanted pregnancies, now that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has admitted that VAT on condoms can be cut to as low as 5%, will she not bring a proposal to Cabinet that the Minister for Finance should cut the tax from 21% to 5%, as was done in the UK and other EU member states?  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has stated that 32% of people have indicated that the cost of contraception is a major factor in the decision not to use condoms, resulting in a rising incidence of sexually transmitted disease and unintended pregnancies.  I could go on as there are many issues.  However, since I am sharing with my colleague, Deputy Wall, I am happy to do so and will leave it at that.
2239	SeanSherlock	Labour	12768.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	387	 I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The Defence Forces camp at Kilworth, County Cork, has been designated as the location for a prison covering Munster and it will replace facilities at Cork Prison in particular.  The proposed location of the prison will be within the 1,200 acre camp located close to the M8 motorway between Mitchelstown and Fermoy and it is destined to house up to 450 prisoners.  On Monday last, the residents of the immediate area called public representatives to a meeting to discuss the proposals and to air their genuine concerns.  In seeking this Adjournment debate, I wish to speak about a number of those concerns.  Given that this prison will be constructed under the terms of the strategic infrastructure legislation, there is genuine concern that local residents' fears will not be addressed.  The construction of such a large prison within a very rural area raises a number of fears.  For example, landowners who leased land from the Department of Defence for agricultural purposes now wonder where their future lies.  They had a long-standing arrangement and have asked will they be able to stay on the land or will this scenario change. People have also asked whether the land acquisition process for the prison has been completed.  If not, there is a strong school of thought within the community that the footprint of the prison should be moved to a more suitable location within the overall landholding.  The community also believe the prison should be constructed within contours that make it more suitable.  It is strongly perceived that the current proposal, as we understand it, is a site within 162 acres.  If the land acquisition is not completed, residents believe that the case could be made for the prison to be moved, even if that is beyond the current 162-acre footprint. From an environmental point of view, there are concerns that three streams within the footprint of the proposal will be compromised.  The area in question is served by the Killally, Ballinrush and Graigue group water scheme.  The source of this scheme is approximate to the footprint of the site. The Minister, in response to a question I tabled on Thursday last, stated that normal planning provisions do not apply to a prison development.  There is an understanding that for security reasons one does not broadcast or make known the exact plans.  We all acknowledge that fact, but further concerns have been raised about the transport provisions to and from the prison.  People in the nearby village of Kilworth, where at times traffic causes a bottleneck, are seeking, through their community council, assurances on the traffic management provisions of the proposals.  They also seek a buffer zone around the prison from an aesthetic and security point of view. Those who live in Cork city are used to the presence of a prison within their city.  The construction of a prison of this nature in a very rural area would give rise to genuine causes for concern and anxiety. If the proposal is being presented as a fait accompli and is not subject to normal planning considerations, I respectfully ask the Minister to ensure any provisions relating to public safety and environmental concerns are addressed.  To assist the community further, I respectfully request of the Minister and his officials that he would meet a deputation of residents and public representatives in the area so they can have their concerns addressed at an early stage.

2245	SeanSherlock	Labour	12769.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 It was reported yesterday that the Government is to spend €40 million next year on carbon credits.  Until such time as the year on year spending on credits is reduced, I will take anything said on the Government benches about this issue with a pinch of salt. As a newly elected Deputy, I find this an extraordinary week.  On two of the most important issues pertaining to Ireland, young people and climate change, we have been offered opportunities to speak at length but no legislation or other concrete proposals have been brought forward.  I thought I was elected to address these and other issues through legislation but I see this week that is not the case.  Considering these issues as only worthy of a talking shop adds to the cynicism for politics outside these Houses. I wish to speak specifically about the correlation between climate change and energy production and the demand for food.  There is a danger that the technological advances in agriculture that have dramatically increased crop yields in the past 50 years could be eroded due to the real and present danger of climate change.  Given that solar radiation, temperature and precipitation are the main drivers of crop growth, agriculture is still highly dependent on the climate.  Energy production is also a function of crop growth.  It is therefore obvious that any significant change in climate on a global scale will impact on local agriculture and thereby affect the world's food and energy supplies. It is important for this house to discuss the correlation between climate change and energy security in the context of food production.  According to an article in The Guardian newspaper, record world prices for most staple foods have led to 18% food price inflation in China, 13% in Indonesia and Pakistan and 10% or more in Latin America, Russia and India.  Wheat has doubled in price, the cost of maize is nearly 50% higher than a year ago and rice is 20% more expensive.  Next week, the FAO is expected to state that global food reserves are at their lowest in 25 years and that prices will remain high for years.  The article in The Guardian also stated: Boycotts have become commonplace.  Argentinians shunned tomatoes during the recent presidential election campaign when they became more expensive than meat.  Italians organised a one-day boycott of pasta in protest at rising prices.  German left-wing politicians have called for an increase in welfare benefits so that people can cope with price rises. There is a simple explanation for why this is happening now.  Increases in food prices stem from an increase in oil prices.  Record oil prices are forcing a flight out of food production in favour of energy production.  US farmers are leaving cereals to grow biofuel crops.  Coupled with this change, extreme weather conditions and growing demand from countries such as India and China are causing a serious spike in grain and rice demand.  It is estimated that the competition for grain between the world's 800 million motorists and its 2 billion poorest people, who are simply trying to survive, is emerging as the epic battle of our times. The Government cannot produce a motion on climate change and energy production without factoring in food production and its effect on energy security.  Climate change has already begun to have serious effects on food supply.  Therefore, policymakers in this country will need to adjust their thinking.  We can achieve self-sufficiency in the area of grain production but this must be done in a way that meets security of energy and food supply.  If the United States is seeking to reduce petrol demand by 20% before 2017, we must wake up and take note in this country. We now have a scenario where oil price increases create a demand for food for energy production.  Climate change and inclement weather patterns are forcing a spike in food prices and biofuels from grain production are experiencing unprecedented demand.  This has serious permutations for third world farmers.  Oxfam has already warned that the EU policy of substituting 10% of all car fuel with biofuels threatens to displace poor farmers in Third World countries.  Changes in climate are causing a catastrophe which is forcing the price of food upwards.  One optimistic economic analysis predicts that markets will automatically readjust to food shortages as higher grain prices make it profitable once more to grow crops for people rather than cars. If we are to be serious about this issue in Ireland, we must harness existing resources such as wind and tidal power and subscribe to a philosophy of ensuring food security.  We must encourage greater food production domestically to offset growing demand.  A growing body of opinion asserts that we can become self-sufficient in grain production.  We must examine the possibilities for both food and energy production in the future.  We must become part of the scientific analysis that seeks new crop varieties that can adapt to changing climactic conditions.  We have to encourage a slowdown in population growth globally.  However, I do not subscribe to the Malthusian analysis that population growth will outstrip agricultural growth because regulation and rational human behaviour can keep this scenario from arising. We have to wake up to the fact that if the price of oil rises further it will make fertilisers and transport more expensive, while also making biofuel crop cultivation more profitable.  In the past year alone, the cost of food in this country has risen by 4.4%.  The era of cheap food is over.  The price of milk and flour has increased by 16 and 17% respectively.  If we are to get the equation right, we must strike a balance between ensuring energy supply while also ensuring food supply.  The flight to biofuels must not come at the expense of food production.  While I do not expect much from this Government, future Governments will have to regulate human behaviour and the demand for energy will have to be curbed.
2246	SeanSherlock	Labour	12769.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	198	 I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I was motivated to table my question on the basis of the growing concern that food price inflation is increasing.  Christmas is approaching and expenditure on food is quite extensive.  There have been increases in the range of 16% to 17% in respect of staples such as milk and, in particular, flour.  There is major potential for growth in the cereal sector to meet this demand.  I accept there are global permutations that will affect how matters pan out for the industry here.  Grain farmers want to see an increase in production to meet domestic demand.  This is particularly the case if one considers the rise in bio-fuel production. My question inquired about the practical solutions the Government will be putting in place to facilitate the increasing trend towards the cultivation of grains.  I have not received an answer in that regard.
2247	SeanSherlock	Labour	12769.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	200	 Did the Minister of State refer to a figure of €10 million?
2248	SeanSherlock	Labour	12769.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	202	 The Minister of State also referred to figures of 1.355% and 1.53% in respect of output.  These represent minuscule rates of increase and the rate of inflation in respect of food will far outstrip them.  I suggest that those rates should be increased considerably to meet demand.
2249	SeanSherlock	Labour	12769.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	244	 On the CAP health check, on the Order of Business yesterday I asked for a debate on these issues on the basis that they will be subject to the co-decision procedure.  While it is a legislative proposal and does not specifically relate to the House, it has major potential implications, both positive and negative, for our agriculture sector and the rural economy.  Will the Minister consider arranging a full debate on this issue, notwithstanding that it will also be addressed in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  The importance of this issue warrants a debate.

With 29% of respondents in a survey indicating a willingness to purchase local food, it is clear that farmers' markets have scope to tap this market.  However, given that most people will shop at one of the multiples, it is necessary to target these food retailers.  While the work being done by Bord Bia is without equal, one of the issues to arise from the conference held last week was the need to build a relationship between Bord Bia and the larger multiples.  I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of this when formulating Government policy.

I do not see why the Minister can discriminate against those people who applied within those timeframes but, because the budget line is suddenly cut, are not to be considered.  I ask the Minister to review the decision on the basis that if we encounter serious changes in agriculture into the future then it will be a matter for farmers to improve their holdings and their facilities.  This is a wonderful scheme in terms of what it seeks to achieve but there should be more flexibility on the part of the Government to allow at least those people who got in before the cut-off to be considered.  The word ""review"" is a very broad term.  It is not a concrete term and it gives no solace to those farmers who applied on time."

2272	SeanSherlock	Labour	12775.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	779	" We have now reached a point where people have lost confidence in the system of delivering cancer care.  That people's confidence in the system has been shaken to its foundations is putting it mildly.  That thousands of women who are at risk of breast cancer face a cloud of uncertainty is a sad indictment of the Government.  That a committee of this House was informed by the HSE that 97 women would have to be recalled for tests before the women themselves were informed speaks volumes.  That these women had not been contacted personally within 24 hours is nothing short of a scandal. When Dr. Peter Naughton told the Minister in 2005 that breast cancer services at Portlaoise were a shambles, did she listen to his concerns?  Yes, she did.  Did she act in a manner that was reflective of her position as Minister for Health and Children?  The answer is ""No""."
2273	SeanSherlock	Labour	12775.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	781	" If the answer was ""Yes"", the Minister would not only have referred the matter to the HSE, she would have followed this issue to its proper conclusion and taken total responsibility.  That conclusion should have been the restoration of confidencein a system upon which thousands of women rely. What is the culture that now pervades the politics of health?  It is one where responsibility is passed from the Executive to the bureaucracy and where political accountability is non-existent.  The Minister was wrong to adopt a hands-off approach.  That is plainly and simply wrong.  A Minister for Health and Children cannot adopt a hands-off approach.  Otherwise, Angola will surely follow. If this motion achieves nothing else, it will have put down a clear marker to the Government that the issue of political accountability must be placed at centre stage in terms of health care facilities and delivery.  That the Minister for Health and Children has been forced to give an account of her actions is a victory for political accountability and for those women who tonight live in fear for their futures and those of their families.  No longer will the people of this country endure a system that leaves no person or organisation accountable for the lack of delivery of cancer care and other services. Our role as public representatives of the people must be respected.  If we seek answers, we must get answers, not carefully worded attempts to dodge the issue.  The Minister should not take us for fools.  Nor should she take the women we represent for fools.  If we deem it necessary to seek answers on behalf of the countless victims of the current health care regime, the Minister must respect that and must respond in kind.  We can no longer accept a lack of political accountability.  The question tonight is whether the Minister acted with due diligence.  She did not."

2277	SeanSherlock	Labour	12782.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-05 00:00:00	Prelude	107	 I wish to share time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.
2278	SeanSherlock	Labour	12782.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-05 00:00:00	Prelude	109	" In recent times, November has been one of the best months of the year for the Minister for Finance.  Today, of all days, will tell a different story.  The serious decline in the housing construction market clearly confirms the continuing fall in Exchequer receipts from taxes such as stamp duty.  Exchequer figures for November show that total tax receipts are almost €2 billion behind the target set out in last year's budget.  The Department of Finance signalled last Friday that taxes collected this year would be approximately €1.7 billion below target. What will today's budget bring and what will be the Minister for Finance's priorities for the economy for the year ahead?  With inflation running at 4.8% — among the highest rates in Europe — the scope for an expansive budget is limited.  The budget is very relevant to the Fine Gael motion.  There is not a great deal in that motion with which I disagree.  The issues of competitiveness and rising labour costs are key drivers for any economic outlook.  The budget will determine whether the calls within the motion will bear fruit. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, outlined a number of fundamental points relating to the lack of investment in infrastructure and issues of public sector pay.  It is true that infrastructural spending in this country is well below par.  There may have been serious spending on inter-urban routes such as that between Cork and Dublin, but there are still regional disparities which have not been sorted out.  How long does it take a train to get from Dublin to Sligo?  If a burst water pipe can turn Dublin's principal motorway into a car park for eight hours, then what can we seriously expect from a Government that is lunging from one crisis to another?  There are secondary and non-national roads throughout this island that are rarely travelled by Ministers, and that eminent backbencher from south Kerry himself admitted that if there was a pothole to be filled in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle, he would look after it.  Should we be living on an island as prosperous as this with even one pothole to our name in this day and age?  The fact they exist at all is a testament to the lack of investment in non-national roads throughout the country. In regard to broadband, there are parts of north Cork where people are still dialling-up to access the Internet.  Dialling up in 2007 is a joke.  Data published by the European Commission shows that in 2007, 74% of households in the Netherlands have broadband access compared with 31% in Ireland.  Who is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its goal of becoming what the Government calls a ""world-class knowledge economy"" in just over five years?  How can we compete on a global scale if the roll-out of broadband is at such a paltry level? The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to take necessary actions on public sector pay.  It is difficult to comprehend just exactly what this means.  The vast bulk of both public sector and private sector workers are operating at wage levels that keep them and their families' heads just above the water-line.  A total of 1.5 million people have salaries worth less than €38,000.  To survive on a wage of €38,000 in today's terms is a difficult task.  Real people operate and survive within this bracket, but they are under pressure in this society.  Their mortgages have increased and they have borrowed to meet the demands of day to day living.  They are overworked, overcharged for child care and overstretched.  Their average basket of food items is increasing at a rate of 4% to 5% per annum.  People on this income bracket can ill afford to absorb such increases, yet they are the back-bone of this economy. Today the Minister will present the usual budget of tax and social welfare changes.  He must look at this income bracket and provide some measure of relief to increase real income to offset the increasing cost of living.  Fianna Fáil made generous election promises on health, education and justice with more teachers, more gardaí and more consultants promised.  Today will tell whether the Minister intends to fulfil those promises. There is a nervousness about Ireland's economic prospects, and much talk of a tight budget.  This motion largely addresses those concerns.  There is a school of thought that says we should not play politics with the economy.  I do not wish to score points, but I do want to remind this Government that its handling of the economy has a bearing on people's jobs and their mortgages and how they provide for their families.  In supporting the spirit of this motion, but not the full tenet of it, we believe it is the role of an Opposition to contribute constructively on how to maintain economic prosperity and further economic development. There are serious issues about our competitiveness and we have to face up to that.  However, there is also a lot that is positive about the economy.  In that respect, as a nation we need to focus on opportunities.  The economic review and outlook, produced by the Department of Finance last month, predicted that the economy will grow by about 3% next year.  It is not what we would want but it is growth and we should acknowledge that.  We still need to focus on the possibilities.  Growth in the economy is no longer driven by the export of goods.  However, growth of services exports is very healthy.  We need to continue the focus on sectors such as sales, research and development and high-value traded services.  We need to ensure, not just that we invest in research in our universities, but that the knowledge being generated is turned into commercial activities and that young indigenous companies survive. The agricultural sector is a mainstay of our economy.  Food and drinks exports account for over €8 billion.  We must also look to our rural economy and ensure that investment continues in the agri-food sector.  We ignore the potential of the rural economy at our peril.  At the same time, we must continue to ensure we can attract foreign investment."

If the price of cigarettes was prohibitive, it would probably have that effect.  However, if one is a committed smoker, it will not change one's behaviour at all.  If it is proposed as a health measure, the Government must look at the issue of smoking cessation.  If some of these moneys could be diverted to smoking cessation measures, then perhaps it would be seen as a more productive move. I also urge the Government to look at nicotine replacement substances, such as gums and patches, which are very prohibitively priced.  Their sale is also restricted in that they are only available in pharmacies, although they are widely available in supermarkets and multiples in other mainland European countries.  If one is to discourage people from smoking, one needs to look at the distribution of those products as well.

2301	SeanSherlock	Labour	12796.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	269	" I noted with interest the contribution of the Minister for State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to this debate last night.  Not once did he mention the word ""pharmacist"" or even acknowledge the problem that exists for the IPU.  He stated: ""the Bill before us today is, in effect, championing price fixing, which is a serious crime carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years"".  This gives rise to the question of whether the Minister of State has decided by implication that the general medical scheme as it stands is administered by pharmacists in a manner that is not in keeping with the law.  He must clarify his opinion. The current impasse between the IPU and the HSE is characterised by the latter seeking to enforce its will on the former without even the courtesy or corporate social responsibility of allowing negotiations.  The very nature of this unilateral decision to slash the payments made by the HSE to pharmacists for the purchase of medicines will undermine the viability of pharmacies everywhere. I do not speak for the large multiples which will soak up the reductions in margins without pain but for community based and family run pharmacies which have a wealth of knowledge of their clients and are acutely aware of the intergenerational health issues that run within families.  The vast majority of these pharmacies are located in rural and marginal areas.  In my constituency of Cork East, towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Youghal, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Midleton are characterised by the presence of independently owned pharmacists who rely heavily on the general medical scheme.  I speak for those who may have taken over a pharmacy from a parent and are carrying on a proud tradition.  They deserve the opportunity to at least negotiate their position. This move by the HSE is dolled up as reform but we can see it for the bullying tactic it is."
2302	SeanSherlock	Labour	12796.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	271	 If the HSE had the reforming zeal it purports to have, it would have consulted the pharmacists prior to any unilateral move.  That is why we are seeking to ensure that by amending the Competition Act, organisations such as the IPU will at least have the right to negotiate a position that will not leave them stranded on this or any other issue. If the concepts of engagement and social partnership are to mean anything, the Government will at least afford them that right.  This unilateral action by the Health Service Executive, HSE, runs contrary to long-held beliefs that the primacy of negotiation with any representative body is paramount.  The Labour Party seeks to defend that right.

2304	SeanSherlock	Labour	12796.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	380	 I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to speak about the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious delay in granting permission to St. Mary's community school, Buttevant, County Cork, to build a new school to provide for an increase in the student population. This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years.  It was last raised by my predecessor and late father in April 2007.  As yet, no progress has been made in this regard.  The staff and pupils, as well as the people of Buttevant, have been waiting for ten years for this project to be expedited and I now call on the Minister to tell the people of Buttevant when she intends to notify County Cork Vocational Education Committee of her approval of the new school. When I was a member of Cork County Council, it took a proactive decision to rezone lands for the purpose of designating an educational site to provide for this school.  At present, the school principal and those who are involved in the school only seek the appointment of a design team to enable them at least to move to a stage from which progress can be made on this issue. The school itself is characterised by buildings which in some instances date back to pre-Famine times.  As the enrolment has increased from 182 last year to 194 this year, is set to rise by at least a further ten next year and is increasing on a yearly basis, the people of Buttevant and the school authorities wonder when the Department will expedite this matter. The layouts of the buildings are of a very poor standard and design because the building is not a purpose-built school.  The staffroom is very cramped and there are no sporting facilities.  The school is obliged to use the local GAA facilities for physical education and other sporting uses.  As the site has been purchased on foot of the rezoning, that step of the process has been undertaken.  I call for some progress on this matter and for the Minister for Education and Science at least to deliver on a promise and commitment to the people of Buttevant because the population of Buttevant and the school's catchment area is increasing yearly.  It is anticipated that Buttevant's location on a main national primary route will make it a far more attractive place to live in future and the needs of the local secondary school on a new greenfield site must be met in that context. This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years and the people of Buttevant and of north Cork wish to see some progress in this regard.  I ask the Minister to take this on board and expedite the matter and bring it to design stage in 2008.  I will conclude by wishing the Acting Chairman, the staff and Members all the best for the season and for 2008.

2317	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 There are measures in the Finance Bill that are laudable, such as the welcome measures to encourage companies to invest in environmentally-friendly equipment.  The measures under the save as you earn scheme are also a step in the right direction.  The health measures, such as the VAT reduction on non-oral contraceptives, including condoms, do not go far enough.  It is our contention that the Minister should have further reduced the rate to 5%, in line with the EU VAT directive. I will specifically refer to the research and development tax credit.  The Minister should fix indefinitely 2003 as the base year for availing of the tax credit.  The Bill, as I understand it, extends the base year of 2003 for the purposes of the research and development tax credit for a further four years to 31 December 2013.  However, the Bill provides that the subsequent years' expenditure, for calculating the incremental spend, will be the ten years before the end of the relevant accounting period.  For example, 2014 will have a base year of 2004.  One can compare this to the UK position, which is based not on an incremental position but on all research and development spend.  This gives the UK a comparative advantage so we should consider adopting this approach. If there is a new Minister of State responsible for innovation policy, I assume the Government is giving the notion of intellectual policy and innovation some degree of stature.  A gesture such as this would assist many companies and enterprises throughout the country which are increasingly endeavouring to heighten research and development spend. Considering the matter vis-à-vis foreign direct investment and its current unstable nature, we will have to rely on many indigenous industries.  Much work is being done within universities and third level institutions, and many spin-off companies are established from that and through venture capital.  Research and development will increasingly be a component of this process so we should incentivise it where possible.  Fixing 2003 as the base year rather than just limiting the credit to 2013 would have provided increased certainty and would have been a more favourable measure. I will comment on my constituency of Cork East and the relevance of this Bill to such a constituency, where unemployment figures are rising.  It has been proven that in towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cobh and Midleton, the figures are going up year on year.  The current Amgen issue——
2318	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	257	 I have an answer to a parliamentary question which clearly proves the unemployment figures are rising.  I can make them available to the Minister of State if he so wishes.
2319	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	260	 We are currently losing jobs in Cork East.
2320	SeanSherlock	Labour	12845.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-06 00:00:00	Prelude	262	 We have lost traditional industries and, for example, the food industry is not what it once was and is going into decline.  Irish Sugar is no longer with us and Dairygold is downsizing its operation.  There is increasing uncertainty about Amgen.  In trying to be positive about how we proceed economically and taking north and east Cork as a region, if a similar situation becomes evident, we will have to rely on indigenous industries.  The Government must proactively seek to upskill those people working within existing industries and introduce some measures for employers to enable them to upskill and grow existing companies.  There are many family-based companies in these towns and I am sure they could do with some incentivisation to grow.  The Government should consider the issue given the current global economic climate.  I am not advocating looking inward but we can start thinking more locally about how to provide incentives to grow jobs. These are the essential points I have sought to cover.  I would have liked the Finance Bill to provide for some composite scheme like the town renewal or urban renewal schemes.  Towns such as Mitchelstown, Mallow and, to a lesser extent, Fermoy are still characterised by certain areas where development has not kept pace with corresponding development on the outskirts of towns.  The Government could be in a position to consider some urban renewal scheme or an adjunct to the existing programme.  I realise a Goodbody report on the performance of the urban renewal schemes was published which indicated a slow take-up in some aspects of the schemes.  The climate is right for towns such as Mallow, Fermoy and Mitchelstown to benefit from those schemes so we could get rid of some of the dereliction still existing within the towns. I have probably used much less than 11 minutes but I do not believe in filling time for the sake of it.  I have covered the points I wished to make and others which I could expand have been expounded upon by our finance spokesperson.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board.  I will be very happy to make the figures available to the Minister of State which prove beyond any doubt that unemployment figures have increased exponentially in these towns.

How can I speak for Paul Quinn in a way that does not patronise his family or politicise his memory?  How can I, who did not know him personally, possibly speak in a manner that will pay adequate tribute to his independence and single-mindedness that ultimately cost him his life? I can only speak to the fact that neither he or his family nor the community of Cullyhanna has received justice.  If we are to subscribe to the ideals of the republic and all the beliefs going with it, we must speak up for Paul Quinn.  We must condemn, without equivocation, his murder, and that condemnation must come from all facets of the political spectrum. If there are those who seek to equivocate, they must reverse their position.  If this island, which has left so many families bereft of justice, is to move on we must hold Paul Quinn up as an example that justice can prevail.  In order for this to happen, those in the shadows must be rooted out and take responsibility for their actions.
2326	SeanSherlock	Labour	12846.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	118	" Decisions on any necessary actions to be taken by the Department and/or the Commission for Energy Regulation as a consequence of any changes to the UK gas regulatory regime will be taken in the context of the publication by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), of revised proposals to the current regime.  The publication of such proposals is awaited.  OFGEM is the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets, which supports the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA), the regulator of the gas and electricity industries in Great Britain. On 10 July 2007, the U.K.'s Competition Commission (CC) quashed a decision by the GEMA to reform the gas offtake regime for Great Britain's high-pressure National Transmission System.  The principal initiative behind OFGEM's proposals was the creation of a ""user commitment"" model, requiring all shippers who offtake at a UK gas transmission network exit point to secure sufficient capacity to meet their needs 3-7 years in advance.  This would have resulted in a number of changes to the Irish market with regard to the booking of gas capacity from the Moffat exit point of the interconnector between Scotland and Ireland.

2328	SeanSherlock	Labour	12852.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-13 00:00:00	Prelude	372	" I will address my remarks specifically to domiciliary care allowance.  The timeframe for dealing with applications for the allowance is too lengthy and causes undue hardship for those applying in respect of minors.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. In the HSE south area expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance which forms part of the rent supplement scheme amounted to €43.56 million in 2005, €46.30 million in 2006 and €49.21 million in 2007.  Annual increases in expenditure in this area would be unwarranted if the Government was doing its job and delivering an adequate social housing programme.  Every year the number on the social housing waiting list who contact me grows exponentially.  Rent supplement is directly linked to the increase in the number on the social housing waiting list and continues to cost the State exorbitant amounts every year.  The moneys expended under the scheme are pocketed by landlords.  If an adequate programme for dealing with social housing was in place, the expenditure allocated to rent supplement could be redirected to more needy sections of society. The rental accommodation scheme is one way of supplanting the rent supplement scheme.  My party advocates a ""begin to buy"" approach which would allow more people to move from social housing onto the housing ladder.  We need more joined-up thinking on this issue.  While the supplementary welfare scheme may be a necessary mechanism in the short term, we must examine the reasons expenditure on it is increasing every year.  More and more people are being forced onto social housing waiting lists.  I ask the Minister to address this issue."

2340	SeanSherlock	Labour	12859.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	508	" The people of Mallow, north Cork, south Tipperary and east Limerick fear for the future of Mallow General Hospital, MGH.  The 100 general practitioners who wrote to the Minister in September stated they are in despair and that ""a blinkered vision of health delivery is slavishly following foreign models without taking into account the existing nature and makeup of the Irish Health Service"".  They contend, as do I, that all patient contact should be in centres of excellence, be it in primary, secondary or tertiary care.  MGH is a primary example of a secondary facility that has punched above its weight, in spite of concerted efforts to downgrade it. The Government, by reducing the hospital's budget by more than €500,000, did not take into account the fact that the information being supplied to warrant a cut is at best misleading and does not take into account certain factors.  The hospital networks section of the HSE south, when asked to provide specifics in reply to questions I have posed to the Minister, responded with generalities which leave us none the wiser.  I have tabled numerous questions to the Minister on the future of the hospital, the appointment of an executive management structure, the appointment of a radiologist, casemix, and the appointment of a radiographer to oversee the CT scanner that has been sitting in an empty room for years. On the issue of casemix, I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 400 on 30 January 2008, where the HSE in response to my question on the €500,000 cut to the hospitals budget stated: Mallow General Hospital has received a negative casemix adjustment of €571,233 for 2008 (which is based on 2006 activity).  Management at the hospital are examining the underlying causes of the negative casemix adjustment for 2008 and a rigorous scrutiny of the hospital's base costs will be carried out. MGH's budget had been cut because the workload of the hospital had been under measured through casemix because of a lack of clerical staff, but it does not suit the HSE to admit this.  I have it on good authority that only 95% of MGH's workload was captured.  The HSE's official line is that the budget was cut because of ""inefficiencies"".  Nobody disputes that MGH's budget is the lowest in the country or that its workload is greater than many comparable  hospitals.  How is it then that its budget is cut? I refer to the appointment of an executive management board.  Why has Bantry hospital, with a smaller catchment area than Mallow, an EMB?  I applaud Bantry hospital in this regard but it is lucky.  The answers I received are an insult to the people I represent.  I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 119 of 31 January 2008, in which I asked about the make up and reintroduction of the executive management structure.  In its reply, the HSE stated that management of both the Cork University Hospital group and Mallow General Hospital are keen to enhance the management structures at the hospital and have over the past several months been working with the HSE's performance and development unit to facilitate the process of establishing an executive management board at Mallow hospital.  It continued that key stakeholders have been met on a one-to-one basis to explore concerns, expectations, visions for the future and development needs, that discussions are ongoing and that a proposal to re-establish the executive management board at the hospital is currently being finalised. According to the HSE, the review has taken slightly longer than anticipated because its scope was broadened to incorporate community-based services and to allow wider consultation with key stakeholders, including medical staff from the Mallow catchment area.  Again, the HSE speaks in generalities but is short on specifics.  It fails to acknowledge that an executive management board was in place Mallow General Hospital which ceased to operate and was never replaced.  As for its assertion that there was a consultation with key stakeholders, this is stretching the truth.  I can name 95 GPs who are key stakeholders in the area but were never consulted.  I know of nobody in community-based services who was consulted.  Which key stakeholders and medical staff from the Mallow catchment area were consulted?  What does the HSE regard as the Mallow catchment area? In the same reply, the HSE states that the acute hospital services review in HSE south will determine overall governance arrangements.  To whom has the proposal for an executive management board for Mallow General Hospital been sent?  On the issue of the CT scanner, which is also addressed in the reply, if the HSE see the benefits of the scanner, why did it not put a proper management plan in place in 2005? We are concerned for the future of the hospital and that the acute hospitals review will seek to downgrade our accident and emergency services, postpone further appointments when current surgical terms of employment end and further delay the building of a day procedures unit.  We want to see the appointment of a radiographer because we have waited too long for one.  We want Mallow General Hospital to be a centre of excellence for secondary care.  We are proud of our Hospital.  If the HSE persists in downgrading the hospital by stealth, we will protest vigorously."

To my mind, notwithstanding the level of co-operation with the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, that implies the risk still exists — and if testing is occurring post-import, the disease might be detected.  Is the Minister satisfied that every beast will be tested on importation to offset the risk and take into account the fact that the Commission regulation — notwithstanding Ireland's position — has gone against us?

2357	SeanSherlock	Labour	12866.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	539	 In the five minutes allocated to me I will do my best to cover the issues I feel are pertinent.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and to support it unequivocally.  I wish to address a number of general points relating to the national broadband scheme, the lack of roll-out of broadband to rural areas and the need for the Government to adopt a universal service obligation similar to that which exists for postal and telephony services. With regard to a universal service obligation, on 7 February last I received a letter from the Commission for Communications Regulation following representations by me on the issue of inadequate or no broadband provision in villages such as Ballyhooly and Glanworth.  I speak of these villages because they are typical of many rural areas throughout the country.  I was told in this letter that ComReg imposed certain obligations on Eircom but these obligations stretch only to the rights of a citizen to a functional telephone line, capable of carrying voice and data over 28.8 kbits. While this obligation might have satisfied the Ireland of 20 or even ten years ago, it no longer goes far enough in terms of providing adequate telecommunications to the Ireland of today.  Universal service obligation broadband must be enshrined in legislation as an entitlement. The politicians of my parent's generation made representations on matters relating to the provision of telephones when no one could get access to a telephone line.  Politicians of my generation make representations on the issue of broadband, when parts of this country are bereft of what is now considered an essential service.  That people of my generation are being told that next generation networks are being rolled out when people living beyond the Pale are still using dial-up and can only rely on that narrow bandwidth is a joke when the average modem for a computer is 56 kbits.
2358	SeanSherlock	Labour	12866.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	541	 A regional disparity exists and it has a negative effect both socially and economically for those living in rural areas which are not covered.  The admission by ComReg that a universal service obligation applies under EU regulations only for the provision of telephones and not in respect of broadband belies a serious flaw in the system.  Every citizen should have an entitlement to broadband in the same way they have entitlement to an operational phone line.  Consequently, I propose a review similar to that carried out by the European Commission in 2005 which would result in a legislative change and give a voice to the thousands of people living in rural Ireland denied access to what is an essential service by today's standards. The broadband availability map found on the Department's website simply does not reflect the situation on the ground.  I would go so far as to state the map is largely a work of fiction and so would many of my constituents.  There is a glaring disparity between those who will eventually be able to avail of the next-generation networks and others, many of whom I represent in a mixed urban and rural constituency, who must still dial up for Internet access.  There is an inequality at play here.  The criteria laid down in the national broadband scheme must ensure there is 100% broadband coverage.  The Minister must ensure those white areas depicting no coverage on the departmental map will have broadband access by June 2008.  Broadband access is a right in today's Ireland.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers. The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.

2369	SeanSherlock	Labour	12874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	251	" I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate, recognising that Deputy Crawford sought its instigation.  In terms of the Minister's contribution, I am reassured.  It is the first time in my experience that we have had such a comprehensive outline of the Irish position vis-à-vis the negotiations, and I am reassured by the fact that there is a very strong Irish position, one that seeks to protect the national interest.  The very term “national interest” appears to have come into fashion again, because there are clear trends in how Ireland’s terms of trade have been affected, or potentially may be, by any deal negotiated by Mr. Mandelson, purportedly on our behalf.  This could, however, be detrimental ultimately to Irish agriculture and Ireland’s interests.  I am heartened that the Minister and her officials are sceptical and have expressed caution about the concessionary approach of the Commission in its approach to the negotiations. It would appear that Mr. Mandelson's negotiating position has been further weakened by criticism by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the effect that the European Union was making too many concessions on agriculture.  It would appear, too, from the Minister's statement that the Irish and French positions are as one in this regard.  It begs the question as to how many other member states hold a similar position and whether Commissioner Mandelson's mandate has been overstepped.  As Deputy Creed stated, it is a question of determining whether the Commissioner's mandate should be reviewed on the basis that the potential for Irish agriculture is being undermined seriously by his current negotiating stance. The response of the EU Commissioner for External Trade to the remarks of President Sarkozy is that his hands are tied by those in emerging nations who want concessions on industrial goods or non-agricultural market access.  If President Sarkozy is sceptical or critical, it does not bode well for the next ministerial round, especially given his comments that he would oppose any WTO deal that went against the interests of France and the 27-nation European Union, especially in respect of agriculture.  Agriculture, therefore, remains a stumbling block to a deal.  Ironically, it is perhaps fortuitous that the French position is strong because I hope it will favour Ireland in the final outcome. It would appear that talks are not moving quickly enough for the United States, whose representatives are warning against what Ambassador Schwab, the US Trade Representative, is calling an ""erosion"" of willingness by some nations to open their markets to more imported farm goods.  The agricultural issues seem to have reached an impasse.  My understanding of this development is that future success will be based on the so-called Doha round of world trade talks, allowing for greater market access for agriculture in particular.  The big question will be whether there can be enough progress to allow a ministerial meeting in late March, April or even later to agree on the outline of a deal, given that the Doha round was launched in 2001 and was expected to last approximately four years. It is clear from the US perspective that there is a clear mood in favour of the liberalisation of agriculture.  The US trade representative, has stated an agreement on freer agricultural trade is essential if there is to be a Doha pact.  The US position is predicated on a liberalisation agenda including the European Union, by way of Mr. Mandelson advocating a similar line.  This involves the European Union reducing its subsidies in exchange for expanded access to markets in third countries and developing countries in particular.  To be frank, the Mandelson agenda is detrimental to both Irish agriculture and agriculture in developing countries. According to the Institute for International Integration Studies at Trinity College, ""The European Union supports a more market-oriented multilateral trading system but is also concerned about social, economic and environmental sustainability"".  It seeks recognition for non-trade concerns.  I remain sceptical about the EU position on non-trade concerns.  There is nothing in the current deliberations that would give solace to any Irish farmers competing in the dairy and beef sectors who fear the flooding of the Irish and EU markets with imports that are not subject to the same standards that apply within the EU Internal Market. The EU position, as adopted by Commissioner Mandelson, is nebulous.  The IFA, in its paper, Meeting the Challenges of WTO and Cap Reform, rightly reflects the concerns of consumers regarding ""the double standards between those which Irish and other European farmers have to meet on food safety, [and] traceability... and the much lower standards applying to food imports into the EU"".  It must be stated this is a rational concern predicated on a genuine fear that our standards of production will be traded away to meet an agenda that does nothing to protect our interests and concessions, which have been hard won through CAP negotiations for years. It must also be stated that the United States is championing the liberalisation of agricultural trade, targeting in particular the elimination of export subsidies and substantial improvements in market access.  One analysis of the US position is that it is weakened by the large increase in domestic support the US is paying to its farmers ""and by doubts over whether the political support exists in Congress to face down its own farm lobby and embrace far-reaching reforms"". The Doha agenda is unpopular and there are question marks over whether the end of the Bush regime in the United States will signal any mood for a deal in advance of a new President being appointed.  The Irish farming position is characterised by genuine fears about cuts to beef and dairy tariffs.  It is a question of whether there is enough support evident at Council of Ministers level for such a cut and of the consequences for the Irish position.  This has been outlined clearly today.  The Irish and French positions are very clear but one must ask whether there is a sufficient blocking majority to alter the EU Commission's position on the protection of agriculture in Ireland and other countries. Arguably, Ireland is a small peripheral nation in the negotiations and it relies on the trading bloc represented by the European Commission.  However, if the French position is similar to our own — I realise there will be subtle differences — we need to form an alliance.  The question remains as to whether the trading bloc in the European Union is sufficiently large to force Commissioner Mandelson's hand on the matter.  I remain sceptical because he has already received his mandate, but I hope it can be reversed in some respects. While guaranteeing food security for EU citizens is a priority and while this can best be achieved through a combination of supporting EU food production and through importation set in the framework of the WTO rules, food security also depends on the European Union's contribution to the building up of world stocks, which are dramatically low, and allowing the European Union not only to protect itself against shortages, but also to take responsibility with regard to global food security.  Such importation, however, must be subject to the same standards that Irish farmers adhere to, and there can be no trade-off or concessions on this matter.  In any quest to impose liberalisation of the regime, equality in terms of trade and standards must apply.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the need to protect the farmers of Europe, including Irish farmers, against a liberalisation agenda that will ultimately compromise the Irish comparative advantage in the beef and dairy sector and will add nothing of value to developing countries' terms of trade. Perhaps my assessment of the current WTO deliberations is open to debate, but it seems to me that the Irish farming position is not too dissimilar to that of developing countries in its opposition to the current round, albeit for entirely different reasons.  Ultimately, we must protect Irish agriculture and allow for an opening up of markets for third countries.  However, if there is to be any doubt about the future and competitiveness of Irish agriculture, and if the proposed tariff cuts are made, notwithstanding Commissioner Mandelson's association with a sister party of mine — I disown his current policies in this regard — there should be no deal and no compromise on this issue."

2377	SeanSherlock	Labour	12880.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	901	 I thank Deputy Lynch for her excellent time keeping.  I hope what I have to say will be equally and not more important than what she said in her contribution. The Government stated last night, in the course of this debate, that in 2008 the Department of Education and Science will pay €167 million to primary schools to cover day-to-day running costs and that a €21 increase to €330 per pupil means primary schools receive unprecedented levels of funding per pupil to meet running costs.  This belies a fundamental lack of understanding of the true nature of educational provision as our citizens understand it, as the parents understand it, and as the principals and teachers understand it. When a parent sends a child to school, an unwritten social contract that is enshrined within the Irish psyche is entered into that the child will receive the best education possible.  That social contract was not on the basis that the parent must also fundraise, take part in raffles, sing karaoke, hillwalk, play bingo and join in pub quizzes so that the child can have the benefit of water, electricity and a myriad other services within their school. In real economic terms the costs of maintenance of schools has increased considerably in recent years and the burden now faced by schools to meet these additional costs ultimately places a further financial strain on parents of children who find themselves fundraising for schools on a constant basis. Educational provision should not have to be subjected to this form of pressure.  It is enough for any school in these times to have to educate and educate alone.  That in itself remains the fundamental challenge and, arguably, it should be the only challenge.  I acknowledge that the Government has increased the capitation grant since 1997.  However, by doubling the capitation grant now, it does not have to come at the expense of providing extra teachers, a theory which has been posited elsewhere in this debate, and somewhat disingenuously. The logic of our position is to ensure that the headache of maintenance and running costs is taken away from all schools so that they can concentrate on providing education and continue, in certain instances, to do battle with the Minister on the capital programme for the provision of adequate school buildings in places such as Castlelyons, Rahan, Grange and Midleton where no proper buildings have been provided for considerable periods.  Not only have schools to raise funds, they also are operating in substandard buildings.  This is the reason the Labour Party is raising this issue.  If the capitation grant is increased, it will at least take some of those pressures away.

2395	SeanSherlock	Labour	12907.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	51	 I welcome the reply from the Minister of State and my response will be very brief.  Does the FEPS encourage the growth of native woodland?  Will the Minister of State potentially consider an additional premium for those farmers, landowners or forestry owners who wish to grow more forestry on the basis that it would reduce CO2 emissions for this country?  Perhaps an additional premium could be given to those farmers who are not already growing forestry but who may potentially embark on growing it.
2396	SeanSherlock	Labour	12907.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 I accept the Minister of State's answer but there is potential to give a further premium purely on the basis there is room to have carbon off-setting, for want of a better expression.  There is major scope for the private sector to become involved in forestry.  As I understand it, to date there is less than 20% involvement of the private sector in forestry and it is an area of agribusiness that has even more potential. I am not convinced the €7,604 per hectare payment, the maximum, is adequate given that one would have to operate on large economies of scale in order to get some sort of a decent return.  Many smaller forestry owners do not currently have the economies of scale to be able to thin back forests to allow for greater potential.  The cost of thinning and maintenance would eat into the premium. We are trying to make a case, in essence, for more grant aid or financial incentives to be provided.  Will the Minister of State consider that?

2413	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	299	 I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Caoláin and Bannon.
2414	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	301	 In response to the Ministers present, it is fair to say that we all have this country's interests at heart.  In terms of the debates that have been facilitated by this House, it is right, proper and pertinent that Opposition Members would hold the Government to account on its position vis-à-vis the WTO negotiations and that the Government would not take any pertinent questions from this side of the House as a slight, given that we all have as our best interests the future interests of Irish agriculture and Irish agribusiness. By way of response to the speech of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, I wish to clear up the notion that she seemed to convey on the issue of the single farm payments.  It is our clear understanding that to convey the impression somehow that the single farm payments will be undermined and that she is endeavouring to save them under the WTO agreements under the green box issues, is something of a misnomer.  My understanding is that they are not part of the WTO negotiations in any event and to say they are conveys the wrong impression.
2415	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	303	" The fundamental question that we must ask ourselves today is what the Doha Round will mean for Irish agriculture and for farm families who form the bedrock of our rural society.  The WTO is informed by a modus operandi that seeks, with the World Bank and the IMF, a global market devoid of trade barriers.  Since 2001, at Doha, the WTO has embarked on a strategy of liberalisation of global trade resulting in a view, by countries such as our own and, I might add, poorer countries, that the indiscriminate liberalisation agenda will be detrimental to our interests and the interests of poorer countries seeking to raise their economic output. For the purposes of analysing the Government's amendment to this motion, there is absolutely nothing in its response that would give solace to the thousands of farmers who today had to leave their homesteads in the quest to have their voices heard. Our critique of the current Doha Round is simple.  The WTO is not on the correct path to deliver worldwide economic prosperity.  It will not raise the economic tide of all comers and, from this island's point of view, will have a disastrous effect on the rural economy and agricultural sector.  Moreover, it will decimate the Common Agricultural Policy, to which we all subscribe and which has been negotiated by a process of pooled sovereignty of EU member states through many years of diplomacy. All of us recognise the primacy of agricultural negotiations and this sector has become an easy target for the EU Commission in its quest to gain concessions on a neoliberal trade agenda because of the subsidisation of agriculture.  Our view is simple.  To use developing countries as a bargaining chip to unravel CAP is a disingenuous argument and one to which we do not subscribe.  It is our analysis that concessions will be fought for on agricultural issues as a substitute for agreement on the liberalisation of services.  Developing countries rightly argue that it is unfair to expect them to open their markets on services while clear barriers to entry exist amongst developed countries on the provision of services.  The key worry for services liberalisation is what it means for the ability to regulate foreign service-based companies operating in less developed regions. Furthermore, the availability of micro-credit in Africa has had the positive effect of lifting tens of millions of small farmers out of poverty.  An agrarian revolution is taking place in Africa about which one will not hear on radio or TV.  Our concern is that the growth of urban populations in Africa, which are fed through the rural African economy, may be compromised in the quest to achieve a rate of liberalisation, which may be detrimental to their economic interests.  Therein lies the comparison with the Irish farmer.  While the Irish farmer relies on the subsidisation of agriculture, the African farmer relies on a new system of micro-credit which may allow him to survive, and even in time, flourish. In that context, Ireland and developing countries are united in their opposition to the Doha round, albeit for differing reasons.  To state that our interests are somehow detrimental to those of developing countries is a naked lie which must be firmly nailed.  To say that we are being protectionist and self-interested is true.  We should not be afraid to state that we as a nation must ensure the primacy of agriculture as an integral part of our society and any attempt to diminish hard-fought gains on CAP must be resisted at ministerial level. A fairer global trading system is something we all want.  Any agreement should also encompass bilateral deals in which the EU is engaged, particularly with the poorest and most vulnerable economies through economic partnership agreements.  As we in Ireland look at the potential cost of cuts in tariffs, the poorest countries are being asked to eliminate more than 80% of their tariffs by the EU.  There is no equity in that proposal which signals a bad deal for both developing countries and developed countries such as Ireland. Global food security is an issue that not only effects those who are more prone to adverse weather conditions but also this island.  If it advances, this deal will compromise the food security of this nation.  The African farmer may also be left with a stark choice if this process is to succeed as envisaged by the EU Commission.  The African farmer may find himself at the end of a trade liberalisation agenda that forces him to buy his seed from a conglomerate such as Monsanto, thereby risking his livelihood, chaining him to another form of bonded labour and potentially compromising his biodiversity. Doha and the WTO failed to consider the cultural and societal permutations of ramming this deal down our throats.  If it succeeds, we can wave goodbye to a traditional way of living.  Those farmers who are able to acquire more land and develop economies of scale will flourish and the traditional farm family will no longer exist.  I may be accused of expounding rhetoric but the implication of this deal will be a flight from the land.  This will be due to the influx of cheaper imports devoid of any controls, standards or traceability. The Doha round is predicated on a globalisation agenda.  It relies on unrestricted global market forces.  In this scenario, transnational corporations will commandeer advantageous terms of trade.  Small local interests will no longer be able to secure, control or protect market share.  Co-operatives will be swallowed up by larger food multiples and the ""Tescofication"" of agriculture will become the norm.  When these larger food multiples control the means of production, they will control the price the consumer pays and the price the producer derives.  We have already arrived at this scenario, albeit on a smaller scale. The structure of an unaccountable WTO rule-making militates against the small producer, be he or she European or African.  The structures give an advantage to large corporations and foreign direct investors at the cost of weakening the traditional equity-orientated economic programmes such as CAP, from which we as an island have benefited."

2419	SeanSherlock	Labour	12916.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-17 00:00:00	Prelude	311	 I thank the Acting Chairman. In reality, these shoddy proposals will bring major changes in the market structures of developing countries in terms of ownership.  It is our view that trade liberalisation will transform subsistence farming into arid export monocultures, stifle the power of micro-credit and put poor countries at the mercy of western countries such as the US.  Furthermore, the price sensitivity of markets will be more keenly felt. In essence, the WTO proposals as they currently stand are overly ambitious in terms of trade liberalisation and rule implementation.  Developing countries, as well as this country, rightly fear that they have nothing to gain from this deal.  We feel that we have made enough concessions and have gained nothing in return.  If this is the case, it is then clear that the process has failed both ourselves and lesser developed countries and is, therefore, unworkable in its current terms.  Contiguous to the analysis arrived at in recent weeks is the notion that perhaps no deal is better than a bad deal.  This is something that needs to be teased out in greater detail. The EU Commission agenda is detrimental to both Irish agriculture and agriculture in developing countries.  The Irish farming position is one which has genuine fears about cuts to beef and dairy tariffs.  The question is whether enough support is evident at Council of Ministers level for such a cut.  If this is the case, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has questions to answer about whether she feels this is a tenable position and if not, what her counter argument is and if there is a sufficient blocking minority to force a rethink on this deal. There are no grounds for believing that Pascal Lamy can push through a deal ahead of the meeting of Agriculture Ministers on 19 May.  As I understand it, the Doha agenda is unpopular and there are question marks over whether the end of the Bush regime in the US will signal any mood for a deal in advance of a new president being appointed. It is our view that, while guaranteeing food security for EU citizens is a priority and this can best be achieved through a combination of supporting EU food production and through imports set in the framework of the WTO rules, this food security also depends on the EU's contribution to the building up of world stocks, which are today dramatically low.  This allows the EU not only to protect itself against shortages but also to take responsibility with regards to global food security. We must take cognisance of the need to protect the farmers of Europe, including Irish farmers, against a liberalisation agenda that will ultimately compromise Irish comparative advantage in both the beef and dairy sector and will add nothing of value to developing countries' terms of trade.  Our view is one which unashamedly seeks to protect the national interest.  In seeking to do so, we are protecting our economy, particularly the rural economy, and a way of life that is under threat.  Commissioner Mandelson has an agenda which is incongruous with the founding principles of the European Union on issues of subsidiarity and its position as a Community-based trading bloc.  We are now left with an appalling scenario whereby the Mandelson agenda is totally at variance with that of certain members of the Council of Ministers, including our Minister.  The Commission must take its mandate from the Council of Ministers.  It must not exceed its mandate.  It is a supra-national organisation and it must derive its negotiating stance from the Minister and her colleagues.  The Minister has a hard task, therefore, in building the alliance of interests that is necessary to protect our interests. We cannot and must not trade away the rural economy at a time when other sectors of the economy have been undermined.  The agribusiness sector is the one that has remained constant through thick and thin throughout the history of the State.  It is the sector that will always be there.  If we are to trade away the concessions that have been hard won through tough negotiations and diplomacy, all those concessions will have been in vain.

2427	SeanSherlock	Labour	12921.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	 I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children, who has primacy for this issue, has left the Chamber.  I would have liked if she stayed for the five minutes allocated to me on this issue.  There was a proposal made at the end of March that the number of consultants operating at Mallow General Hospital be reduced from three to two.  This was on the termination of a contract of employment.  The result of the termination would have been to reduce accident and emergency cover within the hospital from seven days to five, resulting in Monday to Friday cover from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  This decision was already taken, a fait accompli and, but for the actions of people such as the Mallow Hospital Action Committee, of which I am secretary, Friends of Mallow Hospital and general practitioners who came out fighting and held a press conference, deciding that an expression of “no confidence” would be placed in the management of Mallow General Hospital, the management would have proceeded with the decision without a “by your leave”. Because of the action, the furore, and the amount of public protest as a result of the decision, the HSE has stated that it is in a position to fill the post with a locum consultant until the end of May.  We have no commitment in writing that the HSE is intent on the continuation of a third surgical position at Mallow.  We fear the intention of the HSE and the Minister to downgrade our hospital and reduce by stealth the number of surgical posts in the hospital, thereby reducing the accident and emergency services and funnelling everything to CUH which, if one believes the HSE, is the new Jerusalem in the south and will solve all our ills.  We believe the process will have a detrimental effect on the lives of the 100,000 people in the catchment area of Mallow General Hospital, having an adverse effect on medical outcomes.  CUH is ill-equipped to deal with the extra work load this development will entail. I call on the Minister of State to give guarantees in writing that Mallow, as a secondary care facility, will continue as the centre of excellence that it is, that the 100 GPs referring patients to the hospital will have the accident and emergency cover they need and that there will be three surgeons or more to provide the service to more than 100,000 people who require it.  We also want to ensure that the hospital — an excellent facility — goes from strength to strength and will not be downgraded any further. We demand a clear commitment in writing from the HSE, that it will ensure the continuation of a third surgical position so that we can deliver services to our people on the ground.  We have no confidence in the current management system because we have listened to promises on the roll-out of a CT scanner, which has been idle for more than three years.  We have no radiologist in the hospital, which was promised.  We have no executive management board, which was promised and for which the HSE stated it would embark on a consultation process.  The dogs on the street know that a 15 minute consultation with one or two GPs does not constitute a consultation in our book.  We call for the instigation of an executive management board so that we can call into question any decisions on the future of the hospital and examine and provide an audit report of any accounting procedures relating to the hospital. We want to see a centre of excellence at Mallow.  It has a positive effect on the outcomes of patients in the region and we will oppose vehemently any attempt by the HSE to downgrade services.  We want to see firm commitments from the Minister of State and to see the third post instigated in perpetuity so that the people of the region can have a proper standard of care, and excellent care at that.

2433	SeanSherlock	Labour	12922.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	229	" I wish to share time with Deputy Broughan. Most of the arguments in this debate have been well thrashed out and I will not repeat points that have already been made and that I support.  I am in favour of the Lisbon treaty and will vote for it.  I worked in the European Parliament for three years and, though it is an august institution, the first 12 months of my time there were spent seeking to interpret the Byzantine language that emanates from it.  This is an issue for ordinary citizens of the European Union who find it hard to interpret national legislation at the best of times, never mind European treaties and some of the language used therein.  This has negative consequences for the relationships citizens have with the European Union and terms like ""co-decision"" and ""subsidiarity"" may be examples of language used in a manner that is sometimes deliberately designed to obfuscate or confuse people.  Be that as it may, my experience of the European Union has led me to see it as a positive force. I grew up in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s and transfers from the European Union helped members of families like mine to attend college and benefit from the European Social Fund.  I was able to get a grant for third level education.  The investment in education through the fund helped thousands of people of my age who, otherwise, may not have benefited from a third level education.  Neither would we have seen the resultant economic benefits derived by this country.  This is, however, more of an historic context. What is needed is a simplification of the language used in EU documents.  The treaty should be voted for if for no other reason than that it incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a simplified document that codifies the rights of EU citizens.  Whether one is from Ballyhooly or Budapest, one is a citizen of the European Union and, therefore, one's rights are guaranteed by this provision.  The problems encountered by people in this country are exactly the same as by those in other countries.  Our rights should be as inalienable as those in other member states. I speak as a republican and subscribe to the ideals of this republic.  No provision in the treaty is at variance with any of these ideals.  Everything enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives succour to those ideals of egalitarian principles and seeks to ensure every citizen has a defined set of rights.  That is the most important issue. The farming organisations have stated a position on the referendum vis-à-vis the WTO negotiations.  While I am sympathetic to their arguments, I would not advocate a vote against the Lisbon treaty on the basis of an argument over the WTO negotiations.  The treaty will broaden the powers of the European Parliament through enhanced co-decision procedures.  The Council of Ministers it would seem has sway over agricultural decisions affecting this country.  If the powers of the agricultural committee of the European Parliament are broadened and national parliaments are given a greater say in transposing EU legislation, the voice of Irish agriculture will be strengthened and have more power on decisions affecting it. It is important to note we have had little in transparency on the decisions made at EU ministerial council level.  I would bet any money that if the attendance records for EU Council meetings were checked, Irish Ministers would be noted for a fair degree of absenteeism.  Little information is available publicly as to what goes on at these meetings.  Returning to the demise of the Irish sugar industry, a deal was hammered out at European level yet we do not know what happened on that fateful night in November 2005 at the relevant EU Council meeting.  We do not know what Minister took what decision or what was said.  The treaty will make every Council of Ministers meeting more transparent.  I welcome this and it will allow us to know what our Ministers and the Permanent Representation are doing in Brussels. When the Convention on the Future of Europe was held first, the imposition of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing probably set a negative tone.  There was a large-state view on how the proposed EU constitution should proceed with the larger member states seeking to control the agenda.  I do not blame smaller member states for kicking over the traces.  There was a clear modus operandi of seeking to impose a certain set of values in the constitution.  I am glad this has been rolled back and its replacement is a treaty. The ideals of the constitution have been simplified in the treaty.  If the treaty gives more power to the European Parliament, it gives more power to the people of Europe.  If it gives more to national parliaments, it gives more power to us as Irish citizens to have a say in how the European Parliament proceeds on any legislative matter, which can only be welcomed. The treaty also puts in place further checks and balances against the Commission, a necessary mechanism.  EU Commissioners such as Frits Bolkestein have been hell-bent on a liberalisation agenda.  Some from a left-wing perspective will oppose the Lisbon treaty because of that very agenda.  I contend we should agree with the treaty so that checks and balances can be put in place against that neoliberal agenda.  It is also an agenda for which our own Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, has been a strong advocate and has done us no favours in that regard. I support the Lisbon treaty.  While it is not perfect, on balance we will derive far more benefits than negatives from it."
2434	SeanSherlock	Labour	12922.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	313	 I welcome this debate and I wholeheartedly support the motion, which calls for some simple, pragmatic solutions to a problem that afflicts the 10,000 and more people who are affected by acquired brain injury.  The motion also requests the establishment of a regional network of rehabilitation facilities and services to be established in the context of a national rehabilitation strategy.  The response from the Government side offers nothing that would provide comfort or encouragement to those suffering from acquired brain injuries in the context of addressing their needs. There is a regional disparity in the delivery of health care.  If one lives in Cork, Kerry, Galway or Donegal, one is already at a disadvantage if one suffers with an acquired brain injury.  The disparity to which I refer must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Not only does this disparity exist in the area of health, it is also prevalent in the economy and in the Government's regional policy. I recently made representations to a neurologist on behalf of a person with an acquired brain injury.  He confided in me that if he was to close the doors of his practice tomorrow, he would have sufficient clients to deep him in business for the next two years.  That illustrates the seriousness of this issue. Those on the Government side stated that the development of a new rehabilitation centre is at the planning stage and that this will hopefully be up and running by 2012.  That assertion does not provide any grounds for confidence.  The motion before the House calls for an increase in the number of approved posts for consultant neurologists from 24 to 42.  Such a development would almost, if not quite, bring us up to a standard which obtains in other European countries and would represent an immeasurable improvement on the existing position. What we are ultimately concerned with is people's dignity.  There are those who have no access to the services of which they should be able to avail as a matter of right.  These individuals will gain no comfort from what is being said by those on the Government side because there does not appear to be a sense of urgency about this matter.  The Labour Party is requesting that there be such a sense of urgency in order to preserve people's dignity and give them the right to a standard of health care their tax euros should afford them.  Be they resident in Dublin or the regions, they should be treated as equals.  That is what we are calling for in this debate.

2437	SeanSherlock	Labour	12929.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	304	 I will speak to some very specific points on the Bill.  We welcome the Bill and the fact that a mechanism is being put in place to ensure a unified scheme to replace the existing schemes.  This is long overdue.  I will not repeat the points made here previously because there seems to be general agreement about the main thrust of the Bill.  My experience, both as a student and as a public representative, has been one typified by frustration.  For a student to go into the third semester without receiving any payment whatsoever was a sad indictment of the system of student supports as they existed in the mid-1990s.  It is blatantly obvious that the system has not changed much since then, notwithstanding the best efforts of local authority officials, especially those in Cork County Council, and those in VECs, who probably expedited the applications as best they could. The important point is that the whole system is to be streamlined.  In welcoming the Bill, I still do not think that there should be discrimination under section 8 for those students who are attending private colleges.  If a student's parents have the means which would deem the student eligible to be successful in getting a grant for an approved college as defined in the Bill, I do not see why such a student cannot avail of a grant to attend a private college as well.  In other words, the grant should be paid on the basis of the student rather than the college.  We are talking about a social mechanism that enhances the student's ability or lightens the burden as he or she goes through the education system.  There should be no discrimination on the basis of choosing one college over another. We have all been subject to the USI lobby and I welcome its address of the situation as it pertains to part-time students.  As previous speakers outlined, we are now in a society and an economy that needs to retrain and upskill itself constantly.  I would like to see a situation whereby if somebody is laid off or is forced into part-time work, that person could be deemed eligible for some student support if it means that the person is enhancing his or her prospects of getting back into the labour force.  It is time that the traditional mechanisms that existed are reviewed so that we can take account of a more plural society whereby everything is not designated by a person's parents' income, whether the person is eligible for a back to education allowance or whether a person has been out of education for a number of years and is receiving social welfare payments.  The system should also take cognisance of those people who have been working full time for a number of years but will suffer a serious loss of income by going back into full-time education.  Such people need a degree of support as well.  We must take into account the whole gamut of society, not just a few people. I welcome the appeals mechanism because the current system has been very prescriptive in how it arrives at a decision.  If a student is going to college and if there are mitigating circumstances relating to the financial outgoings of his or her parents, they should be taken into account.  To make a decision based on the P60, P21 and P45 and without taking other factors into account is not good enough.  There needs to be a certain degree of discretion and I hope that it works in favour of the student when using the appeals mechanism.  Where the VEC deems that the student is worthy of the grant, it should err on the side of granting financial assistance.  I have met people who, because they are a couple of hundred euro over the limit, have been completely washed out of the system.  There are people on fixed incomes in this country who need that financial assistance, but who have found themselves outside the system and cannot afford to return to college.  That may be an issue for which we need to look at the income limits, but we still need to examine it on an overall basis. We generally support the Bill.  We believe that it is time to look at part-time students.  We need to encourage more people into the education system and the way to do that is not to make it prohibitively expensive for them to do so.  We believe that the grant should follow the student and not necessarily the so-called approved institution, as it is labelled in the Bill.  There has been a marked increase in the number of private institutions that are providing excellent courses that ultimately add value to society and to the economy.  If a student decides that he or she wants to go to a private college, he or she should not suffer discrimination on the basis that it is not an approved institution.

2445	SeanSherlock	Labour	12943.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-14 00:00:00	Prelude	508	 In the past 24 hours we have heard much from the Government side about the ESRI report.  If I were a construction worker or a manufacturing worker who had lost his job in the past three months, the ESRI report would not mean a whole pile to me.  I would not be able to bring home the ESRI report on Thursday evening instead of a cheque and put it on the table to feed my family.  The Government has engaged in a degree of spin on the issue in the past 24 hours.  There is a state of denial on this issue. The Labour Party seeks to lobby the Government to examine this issue positively, take in hand certain aspects of the economy and re-jig its thinking on how to work our way out of the downturn, notwithstanding the potential long-term gains as outlined in the ESRI report.  To arrest the decline in the construction industry the Government must come out in favour of infrastructural spending.  It is not sufficient that the NRA and other agencies concentrate spending on interurban or intercity projects.  The NRA must be adequately funded to develop road networks between towns, especially for secondary roads that are not better, in some instances, than boreens.  If regional development, which should be a main plank of a country such as this, is to mean anything, then the national spatial strategy must be returned to the forefront of economic thinking.  A typical hub town such as Mallow must benefit from Government policy that delivers infrastructure, as should towns such as Cobh, Youghal, Midleton and Fermoy.  These towns have not benefitted from the boom except in the area of construction.  Investment in the infrastructure of road networks, business and enterprise parks will encourage local economic growth. The Government must also find ways to take a punt on innovation.  Given that we have €8 billion invested in property overseas we must find ways to claw this back and encourage those who invest in bricks and mortar overseas to take a chance on the commercialisation of technology.  We must support venture capital and divert investment in bricks and mortar to innovation.  On his website David McWilliams states that out of every €1 we borrowed in 2007, 86 cent went into property.  Speculative investment in property, unlike other investment, creates no added value, no products, exports, patents, no skills and no basis for future national wealth.  The Government's recent announcement of €500 million funding is welcome but it must go further given the recent downturn we have encountered.  Enterprise Ireland's €60 million growth fund to support Ireland's small and medium sized companies is minuscule given the potential in this sector.  The cost base to small local family owned firms, through massive local authority charges, is a testament to the contempt in which this Government holds local authorities.  Properly funded local authorities would mean fewer charges for business and more output locally.  There must be a paradigm shift in thinking towards taking the burden of charges away from small businesses.  For too long they have been a soft focus for the Government in terms of overcharging. The local economy will be the key to our future.  This, along with entrepreneurial endeavour through knowledge, will sustain us.  I call on the Government to acknowledge the potential for venture capital and greater investment in the millions of ideas outside these walls, waiting to come to fruition.  For this to take hold, the Government must become an active stakeholder in the process.  Section 23 type tax breaks that fuelled construction must now apply to the venture capital sphere, which fuels ideas, where the risks are higher but the potential for the economy in the long run is greater.

I am advised that certain protection activities on the Shannon catchment are managed on behalf of the ESB by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.

2447	SeanSherlock	Labour	12949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	 On behalf of my party I join in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and also the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen. The reason for the question is the degree of uncertainty which is having a marked result in this country in that we are now paying more for food.  Families are paying much more for staple items and that gives rise to the question.  If the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted, that will have a further uncertainty for food production throughout the European Union into the future.  Many people are asking whether the Government has a coherent policy.  Irish farmers and food producers will be asking whether that €8.6 billion in exports will be compromised in any way if global trends continue as they are.  We are trying to elicit whether, notwithstanding the CAP health check and the FAO agenda on a global basis, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a coherent strategy on the way forward for Irish producers to attain some degree of self-sufficiency — and ensure we take a long-term view on food production in Ireland.  That is the premise of the question.
2448	SeanSherlock	Labour	12949.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	124	 Does the Minister acknowledge that if the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted at present, this will have a further adverse effect for producers in developing countries — as well as for Irish producers?  Ultimately, and this harks back to what the Fine Gael spokesman is saying as regards the current WTO deal, there are political considerations, both domestically and internationally.  Irish farmers want to hear that there will be no dismantling of the long-term achievements of CAP into the future.  It is clearly the case that the WTO deal, as it stands, will compromise those gains and indeed, diminish and destroy them.  They want to hear a firm voice from the Government as to its intentions on the WTO deal.

The confusion relating to this is genuine and, from the point of view of a spokesperson on agriculture, there has been no legislation on agriculture, fisheries, forestry or food in the past 12 months.  For this reason I hope the statement is genuine and I look forward to the legislation.

I am a regular user of the Mallow to Dublin service and I rely on it greatly.  It is perhaps a credit to Iarnród Éireann in some respects that it has rolled out a fairly extensive service.  However, credit is also due to the existing drivers on those routes.  Some of these drivers have eaten considerably into their holiday time over the past 12 months because of the shortage of drivers and were refused leave in some instances when they sought and gave notice for leave for family occasions like confirmation or first holy communion. While we agree this is an unofficial strike — I particularly welcome the fact that the LRC machinery is now kicking in and I hope that both sides will come to a compromise on this — there needs to be a roll-out of the drivers as promised.  If that can be expedited so that the service is resumed and the existing drivers are not put under increasing pressure that should be done. There are two sides to this Iarnród Éireann story.  I hope it will come to a successful conclusion.  Some drivers have been very flexible in their approach with Iarnród Éireann and have been more than willing to accede to its wishes in terms of practices.  I hope Iarnród Éireann will reciprocate in kind.
2458	SeanSherlock	Labour	12956.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	255	 I have no function in relation to controlling the price of oil, diesel or petrol.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect market factors such as global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs. The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with specific responsibility for the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific statutory responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Both have responsibility for ensuring that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.  EU price figures published on 19th May, 2008, show that the average price of diesel in Ireland in April was €1.248 per litre.  The corresponding figure for April published in May 2007 was €1.072 per litre. Traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol in Ireland at the forecourts.  This was due to the fact that the international prices for both products were at a similar level, and excise duty is lower on diesel.  The excise differential in favour of diesel is 7.46 cents.  The international price of diesel is determined by supply and demand, and the increase in demand for diesel which is taking place both within Europe and in China and other rapidly-developing economies world-wide, has pushed up the international price for diesel above the price of petrol.  The increase in the demand for diesel has led to a shortage in European refineries, and diesel is now being sourced from farther afield, particularly from Russia.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also reported that US refiners have been producing substantially more petrol than usual and domestic US stocks are very high.  These factors are likely to have curbed flows of exports of petrol from Europe to the US, leaving Northwest European petrol stocks above average.  The combination of all of these market factors has contributed to the rise in European diesel prices relative to petrol.

2461	SeanSherlock	Labour	12957.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	83	 Transport is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  It is widely acknowledged that transport is one of the most difficult areas in which to affect a reduction in CO2 emissions.  Biofuels offer one potential means to counter rising emissions levels in the transport sector.  The recent EU proposals setting the biofuel obligation targets for 5.75% in 2010 and 10% by 2020 have included the provision that any new fuels have at least a 35% emissions reduction and have to show that they come from sustainable sources which do not destroy natural habitats.  Biofuel production and use will enhance security of supply and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to direct CO2 benefits, biofuels offer opportunities for waste recycling as biofuel production can use this waste oil as a feedstock.  The development of a supply line of alternative fuel supplies which would still be available should there be a disruption to essential oil supplies is essential so that we can continue to provide basic services in such circumstances. Recent events have shown us that biofuels are not without their complexities.  The diversion of food crops into biofuel production has been one factor in the recent rise in world fuel prices.  There has also been concern that new biofuel production has lead to the conversion of natural forest systems into crop production. It is for this reason that we will ensure that our expanding use of biofuels must take place within the context of the EU sustainability criteria regime, currently under negotiation. The European targets will not be pursued in a manner which threatens the long-term food security of the developing world. By establishing the longer-term targets early, and announcing our intention to move to a biofuels obligation, we aim to create a level of long-term certainty for potential investors, particularly in second-generation biofuels.  These new technologies offer the potential to generate fuels from a number of feedstocks which would not be competing with fuel supplies.  A public consultation on Ireland's biofuels obligation will be launched shortly and we will be encouraging all stakeholders to input into this process.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie. The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers. The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.  Homes and premises that are more difficult to reach are also being examined and potential solutions are being considered.  Consequently, it is expected that all homes and premises in currently unserved areas will be offered a broadband service.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in August 2008.

2477	SeanSherlock	Labour	12978.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	306	" The language used by the institutions of the European Union is not understood by the general populace or politicians.  A practical example of this would be to ask any Member what the co-decision procedure means.  I am sure the majority would find it difficult to explain.  If one cannot explain the co-decision procedure, how can one explain what the Lisbon treaty means for enhancing the powers of the European Parliament?  How can one explain that the treaty would give more powers to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  If that language deficit exists, it is difficult for the general populace to latch on to an idea of what the treaty means. I supported the treaty because it aims to enhance the powers of the European Parliament, make the European Council more transparent in its dealings and give, by extension, more powers to the people.  It would address the issues that turf cutters, fishermen, farmers and others have because the European Parliament, and by extension the people, would have extended powers.  However, we voted ""No"" to that.  Therefore, we need to ask ourselves how we should start to educate ourselves as to how the European Union works and what is the inter-relationship between the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament and how this inter-relationship and pooling of sovereignty affects us as citizens of the European Union. The argument of sovereignty was used against the treaty.  When we joined in 1973, we did so on the basis not that we were giving up our sovereignty but that we were pooling our sovereignty and becoming part of a decision-making process of which we were also members and stakeholders.  This treaty was going to enhance that very provision but, as other speakers have said, we found ourselves on the back foot, rebutting arguments that were spurious in the main.  I respect people's decision to vote ""No"".  I have to respect that decision because if there is a fundamental lack of understanding as to how the institutions work, how can a person buy into and believe in the process?  The question is how we are going to address this attitude and make people believe in the process.  Will there now be a complete recasting of our relationship with the European Union?  Do we now proceed backwards into a process of intergovernmentalism or do we enhance and deepen the process by means of inter-institutionalism?  This is the question that needs to be asked. I found it difficult to explain that very relationship to people on the doorsteps.  We must wait for the time when the people of Ireland understand the positive aspects of that relationship and we begin to use a language that does not regard Brussels as some foreign entity but merely as a city in which decisions are taken by us as equal partners to a decision-making process that is the European Union.  Until we begin to decipher the language and change the language we use and make it more amenable and understandable to people, we will continue to have this deficit."

On a personal level, I could say I have enjoyed the experience but I expected when I came to this House that I would be up to my oxters in legislation and debate but the contrary has been the case.  I sense a malaise and a lack of appetite for the issues which relate to the governance of this country from the Government side of the House. Today we debated the Lisbon treaty referendum and I, as a Deputy for Cork East, had five minutes to discuss and put forward the ideas I had but I could not do so in the time available.  The time available in this House for political discourse and debate is becoming shorter all the time.  That sends a message to the people that politicians could not care one fig about the issues relating to their everyday lives. We are now going to extend this session by one week.  That will feed into that increasing cynicism which exists beyond these walls about political discourse in Ireland.  The Labour Party has many ideas and positive contributions to make in working with this Government, in constructively opposing ideas which this Government puts forward and in offering better solutions, if it can.  However, the space for discourse and debate has been cut to shreds.  That is what exists in the country at present and it needs to be addressed. I have a particular competence as Labour spokesperson for food provision and agriculture.  I have ideas that I could put forward that would, I hope, lead to expanding the base for agricultural production and for dealing with the issues of increased food prices.  However, I am not able to do this because the Government and the leaders of the country will not allow me the opportunity to do so, thereby denying me the opportunity to represent the people who put me here.  This House has primacy in terms of its democratic function but this is not recognised.  The Government is running scared from any kind of debate and is not facing up to its responsibilities.  It needs to start doing so straight away.

2483	SeanSherlock	Labour	12979.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	456	 I propose to share time with Deputies Tommy Broughan and Brendan Howlin, if I may. I received the same e-mail as Deputy Creed and I believe it has summed up the situation as it relates to a family that is completely reliant on fishing for its livelihood.  A husband and wife re-mortgaged a house to invest in a boat, employ a crew of five people and take to the seas.  In one instance, it spent ten days, or 240 hours, at sea for a return of €725 per man before tax.  Basically, they were earning €3 per hour.  Moreover, the same fishermen then are obliged to incur the stringent regulations applied by the authorities in Ireland, while French, Spanish and fishermen from other countries are looking on and laughing at the regime here. This pertains to realising that a group of people exists within our society who, because of climactic and bureaucratic conditions, incur serious losses of income.  However, they wish to sustain their livelihoods and their coastal communities because they have done so for generations.  As the lady who wrote the e-mail stated, when they hit bad times they want a leg up and not a handout.  Moreover, they do not wish to incur the bureaucratic nightmare that relates to fisheries policy.  However, they want to see put in place a realistic mechanism that would assist them through, if one pardons the pun, choppy waters.  During times when crewmen and women are not bringing in catches and their incomes are being seriously depleted — they are deemed to be self-employed —  they should not be obliged to go cap in hand to the local community welfare officer to beg to supplement their income.  A form of tax incentive or tax break could be put in place on the basis they are sustaining communities in coastal regions.  Moreover, the Government should consider a form of social welfare mechanism to assist such men and women on the basis that their income fluctuates between one end of the year and the other, that would not necessarily be breaking EU direct aid rules. I ask the Chair to let me know when I have spoken for four minutes.  I am anxious about the other Members——

Is the European Union serious about tackling the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing?  Short of stating and acknowledging the problem, is the Government going into that meeting with a serious view on this problem?  It seems it is costing Irish and other European Union fishermen billions of euro annually because of the international nature of the problem.  This matter must be taken up at the WTO.  It must be taken up seriously at Irish level because it is taking food from the mouths of fishermen and is having an impact on a sector of our economy and society that could do very well, were this problem targeted in an effective manner.

Cork County Council announced last week that it would be cutting a range of grants designed to help people to make modifications to their homes, namely, the essential repairs grant, the mobility aids grant, the housing adaptation grant and the housing aid for the elderly grant.  The reason is that it is not in a budgetary position to deal with the number of applications being made.  The county council has stated that where possible it will try to process the disabled person's grant.  That specifically relates to Cork County Council's northern division. We are asking that the Minister consider an increase in the funding stream.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, will tell the House there has been an increase year on year in the overall allocation for 2008 and the total amount disbursed in 2007.  The announcement in February by the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, caused the other schemes announced to become so successful that hundreds of people applied for them.  That created an expectation.  We now find in the northern division of Cork County Council that there is a lack of funding to meet the schemes of which many vulnerable and older people are in need to carry out necessary modifications to their homes.  I call on the Minister to see if there is any way to provide an increase in the funding stream.

2492	SeanSherlock	Labour	12986.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	196	" I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I echo the sentiments of our spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, on this Bill.  The legislation, as it is put to us, and the subsequent statements by the Minister, would leave one wondering what is the purpose and content of this legislation.  There are few meaningful sections in the Bill.  The culture and sale of alcohol in this country would probably be better dealt with in the sale of alcohol Bill.  However there are some good provisions in the Bill that are worthy of support. In this country we cannot talk about alcohol without its having some very deep cultural meaning.  Our relationship with alcohol has been ambiguous and we have spoken about it since Adam was a boy.  In my research I came across a study in the Journal of Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland entitled Issues for Irish Alcohol Policy: A Historical Perspective with some Lessons for the Future, published in 1991.  The author of that report, Mr. Daniel McCoy, cited a quotation: “No one can be competent to discuss the drink question unless he has thought over it sufficiently to realise how complicated the subject necessarily is.”  On page 21 of that study the author refers to historical views of the relationship we have with alcohol in this country: Irish drinking was seen as convivial rather than ritual and was used as a bonding with people of the same or other groups.  Irish people ... have a ""social acceptance"" of drunkenness something that is completely opposite to the Islamic view. While I do not advocate that we all turn to Islam, neither do I advocate some of the points raised in this piece of legislation that seeks to modify behaviour.  For example, I do not believe the provision on sale of wine in supermarkets is good.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to reverse that trend.  The vast majority of people drink responsibly and like to imbibe and share a bottle of wine in their homes.  The notion that somebody would have to go to a supermarket that has an off-licence and ask for a bottle to be handed out by a member of staff so that he or she could handle it before purchase is ludicrous.  I am glad the Minister has reversed that provision. I want to speak briefly on theatre licences.  There should not be uniform closing times for nightclubs.  Having hundreds of people spilling out onto the streets at one given time is not an effective method of regularising alcohol consumption, if that is the modus operandi of the Bill.  By modifying or regulating closing times in a very uniform way one will not modify behaviour.  The core of the legislation should be to seek to change the culture.  By staggering closing times, particularly for nightclubs with theatre licences, there would be more of a drip-feed onto the streets and it would be easier to control.  The legislation proposes to have CCTV cameras installed and that would be a good way to monitor the behaviour of clientele exiting onto streets at night time.  However restricting licences, particularly theatre licences, will not be a good way of modifying alcohol consumption.  The two do not correlate. I have attended the Gaiety Theatre, which has a late licence, on a number of occasions.  According to its website, this weekend four different events will take place simultaneously in the theatre's four bars.  There will be a live band playing indie and retro music, on another stage there will be northern soul and there will also be some hip hop.  In a city the size of Dublin one is catering for a wide range of musical tastes and a clientele that likes to go out clubbing.  These people do not necessarily see themselves as deviant in any way when they have taken alcohol and will go home after enjoying a responsible night out.  Curbing that person's behaviour through legislation will not necessarily create a panacea for how alcohol is consumed in this country.  The vast majority of people behave responsibly, like to go out and have a varied night, such as the night provided by a facility such as the Gaiety Theatre.  Restricting those types of licences will not necessarily change the culture.  Although the alcohol advisory group made recommendations with regard to closing times, not all of its recommendations are necessarily contained in the Bill, from what I have read.  I repeat Deputy Pat Rabbitte's point that the sale of alcohol Bill must deal with the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption in this country by modifying closing times and the right to be able to purchase alcohol in a supermarket or off-licence.  Making provisions whereby a certain aspect of a supermarket has to be closed off and all alcohol moved behind a counter was totally ludicrous.  I welcome the changes announced in the Minister's speech and the overtones in that regard. With regard to early morning houses, while I understand the Bill must go through Committee Stage, as it is constituted at present it almost criminalises those who have early morning licences and seeks to convey an impression that anyone with such a licence is the purveyor of all sorts of iniquity.  Many people, some of them constituents of mine, have worked either as dockers or have worked night shifts all their lives.  Due to their pattern of sleeping following a night shift, they will enjoy a pint in the morning in the early house and will then proceed home in a proper and orderly fashion.  Of course, there have been instances where early houses have probably had some degree of anti-social behaviour but this is not outside the norm of any other establishment holding a normal licence. The advisory group did not undertake any quantitative or qualitative studies.  I do not know of one licensee in the early morning trade to whom I spoke who had a visit from any departmental official during the framing of this legislation.  I believe this measure was included as an afterthought and I am glad the Minister has made some concessions in this regard. In conclusion, I am glad the Minister has seen sense.  If we are talking about the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption, the link between the cultural aspects and education have to be expounded more vociferously by the Government.  The only way we will change the culture is by a process of education.  I do not believe some of the provisions in the Bill would necessarily change that culture and, in fact, they would drive alcohol more into an underground mode.  While I welcome the Bill in some respects, I am glad the changes the Minister has proposed will now be made."

The Government found out how much it would cost to clean up the site and is now seeking to spin the matter in such a way as to suggest that the subcontractors on the site were acting outside their station or ultra vires and is now seeking to put the blame on them.  When the Government realised that it had unearthed such a problem, it refused to acknowledge it and sought to cover it up.  Its intention, in the first instance, was never to fully assess and continue the works that are necessary on the site. This is a bombshell to the people who reside in the vicinity of the site.  They thought that the Government was acting in good faith when it decided that the Haulbowline site would be cleared.  For the Government to state that the contract only covered above-surface works and not sub-surface works is an attempt to cover up the problem that exists from a subterranean point of view.  Its intention was never to expend the funds necessary to clean up the site and make it safe for those who reside and work in its vicinity.  I ask the Minister to specifically address the point in the letter dated 18 April 2008 because it is the most pertinent point relating to this issue.

2505	SeanSherlock	Labour	13083.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-01 00:00:00	Prelude	139	 That this Government would expect us to come into this House, take the Bill that is before us and accept it as a fait accompli without any critical assessment is a gross underestimation and a gross insult to those we represent.
2506	SeanSherlock	Labour	13083.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-01 00:00:00	Prelude	141	 The amendments that have been put forward by the Labour Party are sensible because they seek to give a parliamentary oversight to the process that is about to be undertaken here. The amendment on the financial aspects — I refer specifically to amendment No. 24 — to the effect that an equity stake could be taken by the State in the event of a call on one of the loans is something that should be considered.  The people of this country would then have some sort of a stake and say in the control of the banking system into the future. The other issue relates to the power of the Minister for Finance.  In any parliamentary democracy there must be checks and balances.  What is being proposed by the Government in its current form gives undue power to the Minister for Finance and the amendments that we have put forward would seek to keep that in check. I do not want to engage in a rhetorical speech here about the nature of global financial capitalism, but what we need in this country, which we can bring about only through our membership of the European Union, is a greater degree of regulation that will ensure that the confidence that has always been in the banking sector will continue. Unlike Deputy Gogarty, I do not envisage that we should return to the gold standard.
2507	SeanSherlock	Labour	13083.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-01 00:00:00	Prelude	143	 Confidence is all important but if the taxpayers of this country are being asked to underwrite this, there should be some pain for the banks, there should be some quid pro quo, and there should be a possibility that the State would at some future date have a degree of equity in the banking system, if necessary.  That is what is being proposed, and that there would be complete transparency in that process as well.  Our amendments are reasonable and should be taken on board.

May we have the exact dates for publication?  With regard to the animal health and welfare Bill, given that this legislation has been included in the legislative programme for over a year and extensive consultation has taken place, why has the Bill not being brought before the House to date?  Although I have been in the House for over a year, I have not yet received a proper explanation as to the reason the Bill has not yet been published.  I am Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and I am dying to get my teeth into legislation, but we have not had any from the Department during this time.  We also deserve an explanation for this. We go through the same charade every week.  Members want to raise issues affecting their constituencies, but are prevented from doing so.

2515	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	364	 In reference to the Minister's speech, particularly where he dealt with the principles of taxation, he said the imposition of taxes must be fair and equitable and that a higher rate must apply to those on higher incomes.  That sounds familiar in that it reads exactly like my old leaving certificate economics Folens textbook and whoever wrote that probably did the leaving certificate around the same time as myself.  However, I always understood from my leaving certificate economics that taxation should be progressive, not regressive.  In this instance, the 1% levy is regressive.  Those on the margins and people who predominantly probably voted for Fianna Fáil are being punished for their loyalty.  They are the people who did not benefit extensively during the boom years.  Instead, they went out every day to do as they always did and now they are being punished.  It is the wrong strategy and a regressive measure.  When one takes account of the increases in VAT and other increases in the cost of living, it will have a negative impact on their real income.  The real incomes of those in the low income bracket will be severely affected and for that reason we oppose this measure.
2516	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	409	 On the price of tobacco, the Labour Party will support the measure on the basis that it will act as a deterrent.  However, in an effort to curb tobacco consumption, we should encourage people to use substitute products and allow those products to be free of VAT.  Products such as Nicorette should be delisted — as currently they can only be sold in pharmacies — and allowed to be sold in supermarkets and to a wider range of people.  I called for such a measure in the previous budget.  I suspect one of the things at play here is that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is firmly in control of that issue.  I take the measure at face value if it is a question of equity but it should be considered in a wider context if it is considered as a health measure. If I were an average Fianna Fáil voter, a male, who liked to back a horse, maybe enjoyed a glass of wine——

Many people who fit that demographic voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election and now they will think seriously about how they will vote the next time.  I am also pleased that the Government did not put any VAT on children's clothes or footwear because, by God, if it did, we would definitely be going back to the 1980s.
2519	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	509	 I refer to the stamp duty on cheques and bills of exchange.  While many people engage in on-line banking and make electronic payments, we have not reached the stage where the bulk of people make such payments by those means.  The facilities do not exist in the community or the commercial sector.  For example, if one goes to a builders' providers it is not always possible to make electronic payments.  This is an unfair measure, especially for older people who still rely on the use of a cheque book.  This is a sneaky way to raise a few bob. Let us suppose a person has a mortgage and there is a life assurance policy tacked on to that mortgage.  Is that person susceptible to the proposed increase vis-à-vis life assurance and investment funds?  This would have the net effect of increasing the cost of mortgages for a certain sector.  It is proposed that this would yield €13 million per year.  I seek clarification on this matter.
2520	SeanSherlock	Labour	13096.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	582	 On a point of order, I asked a question.

2533	SeanSherlock	Labour	13097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	572	 It is very patriotic.
2534	SeanSherlock	Labour	13097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	574	" Most of the points about the health effects of this budget have been well covered by my colleagues.  They highlighted how the budget has imposed numerous stealth taxes and cuts.  Deputy Shortall has outlined the so-called treacherous 30.  A rational analysis of this budget would leave one in no doubt but that every single citizen will be adversely affected.  The Taoiseach yesterday called the nation to patriotic action.  In a later deposition, for want of a better word, the Taoiseach stated this Government is predicated on a philosophy of republican egalitarianism.  When the Minister for Finance finished his speech yesterday and the backbenchers rose to applaud him, I thought they were going to spontaneously burst into a rendition of ""Wrap the Green Flag Round Me"".  From where I stand as a republican and as somebody who subscribes to those republican ideals and those ideals of egalitarianism, this budget is far from that.  If I was an elderly person today, or if I was somebody who was surviving on a low income or if I was unemployed and I was seeking some solace from this budget, none would be found.  There is nothing in this budget that covers those people who would subscribe to those same ideals, namely, every single citizen. If it was an egalitarian budget, it would not have introduced a levy of 1% on all income.  If we subscribe to the notion that taxation must be equitable and fair and it must abide by the canons of taxation, then the tax rates would have been increased and the Minister would not have increased taxation on all income.  I wish to nail the lie that this is somehow a progressive measure.  What it seeks to do is further decrease take-home pay and real income.  The people most affected will be those on the margins or in the low-income bracket.  If this is coupled with the increases in stamp duty, the increased charges for third level registration, increases in VAT and in DIRT, no matter what way, such people will be caught on all sides.  These are not the actions of a Government that cares about levelling taxation in a truly egalitarian manner. I had a call today from a lady from Cloyne in my constituency of Cork East.  This lady is married, there are two incomes coming into the family and she has four children.  This is a person who is rational in her assessment of the current climate.  She and her husband have lived through the 1970s and 1980s and had begun to raise a family in those times when her husband and herself were paying 50 pence in the pound and possibly more in taxation.  She has a 22-year old son and she is now actively encouraging him to emigrate.  She told me she can see no hope for him in the present climate in this country.  She is telling him his best chance of getting a good job and surviving in this world would be to get out of here.  There is nothing that she could see in the current climate that would give her or her family any hope.  She told me that her husband is near retirement age and that they both worked hard for every single penny they earned.  They never asked for anything from the State.  They never had medical cards.  They paid the high rates of tax in the 1970s and 1980s.  They sent their kids to college but they never qualified for third level grants.  That family is representative of thousands of families who today will have to pay the price of the profligacy of the past seven or eight years.  They will have to pay the cost of that deficit of approximately €12 billion, if the figures are to be believed.  As her public representative, what am I to say to her to give her any hope for the future?  I do not blame her for the cynicism that she expresses about the political system.  When I hear the Government wrapping the language of this budget in patriotic fervour and republican egalitarianism, it sticks in my craw a little bit.  The Government, notwithstanding the external forces we hear so much about, must take some level of political responsibility.  If we were on that side of the House, we would have to take political responsibility if the cards were stacked in the same way.  This is what the people want, particularly those who are on low to middle incomes.  They do not want always to be forced to pay the price of Government profligacy.  This is not what they have subscribed to.  They are, by their nature, always PAYE workers and they are the people that work the hardest, put their children through college and do not expect a lot from the State but they do not expect to be punished by the State either and that is what this budget has done to those people.  If we are talking about egalitarianism and about equity in the system, then I call on the Government to reverse some of those measures to at least release the real income or let them claw back some of that real income they have lost through these measures.  This would be equitable and fair and there would be a greater share of the burden of responsibility.  As a high-income earner, I would be happy to take on a greater burden if necessary. It is often said that the true mark of an egalitarian society is how older people are treated.  This budget has clawed back the medical card for the over-70s and this is nothing short of a disgrace.  I will not use superlatives or come out with a soundbite but it is unfair on those people.  We had created expectations and put in place a system that people had become familiar with.  When they came to the autumn years of their lives they had the peace of mind of knowing they could go to the GP when they wanted to and had that little entitlement when inflation and the cost of living were increasing.  They no longer have that little cushion.  I call on the Government to reverse that as an egalitarian and truly republican measure.  If the Government subscribes to those ideals it will reverse this measure."

2537	SeanSherlock	Labour	13098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-16 00:00:00	Prelude	601	 I wish to share time with Deputies O'Shea and Ferris.
2538	SeanSherlock	Labour	13098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-16 00:00:00	Prelude	603	 I wish to speak about the subject of this motion.  I will stick to the point of this debate, which has gone all over the shop, quite frankly.  The purpose of the motion is to seek an extension to the farm waste management scheme.  The Labour Party would support such an extension, not for political expediency or point-scoring, but because we realise that a certain number of farmers will not be able to make the deadline.  We support such farmers for reasons of common sense and pragmatism, some of which have already been outlined.  I am aware of farmers who have not been able to get contractors to do the works which are required under the scheme.  The poor weather we have endured this year has delayed some building works.  Many farmers will not be able to meet the deadline as a consequence of a myriad of other circumstances, which I will not repeat.  There is merit in raising, in a genuine way, the possibility of an extension to the deadline.  Some people will be adversely affected if a change is not made. The valid point made earlier by Deputy Deenihan, which has also been raised by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Organisation, ICMSA, deserves further examination.  I refer to the interpretation of State aid and the interpretation of the scheme.  I wish to quote from a letter sent by the president of the ICMSA to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 25 August last.  The letter, which gets to the heart of the debate on this motion, reads: Dear Minister I wish to refer again to the 31 December 2008 deadline under the Farm Waste Management Scheme.  While we are all aware of the background to the scheme and the setting of the December 2006 and December 2008 deadlines, there is clearly a major problem for a growing number of farmers if the 31 December 2008 deadline is to be interpreted as meaning that the work must be completed and approved by your Department on or before that date. We do not accept that this is the only interpretation.  I believe, based on the EC Guidelines for State Aid in the Agriculture and Forestry Sector, that Ireland should propose that the 31 December 2008 deadline can be met by an individual farmer where the building work is to be completed or commenced after the 31 December 2008 if that farmer has a legally binding contract for the construction of the building and or supply of materials in place on or before 31 December 2008. This procedure, reliance on a legally binding contract, is used quite often for the phased introduction or termination of tax relief measures.  I believe that this procedure can be readily adopted by your Department and would meet the requirements set down in the EC Guidelines for State Aid in the Agriculture and Forestry Sector. That proposal, which is based on a valid interpretation of the state aid guidelines, represents common sense.  I echo Deputy Deenihan's comments on it.  In his response to this motion, the Minister, Deputy Smith, did not respond to Deputy Deenihan's point.  I call on one of the Government Deputies to respond to the issue that has been raised in an honest manner.  Is this interpretation of the guidelines valid? I do not wish to play politics with this issue.  A balanced and reasonable view is being put forward by a group of farmers who will not be in a position to submit the card A due to genuine reasons.  It is reasonable for us to echo the views of those farmers, notwithstanding what Deputy Conlon and others have said in support of the scheme.  We have had superfluous speeches by Government backbenchers, but there is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.  Before the clock runs down on this debate, I hope that the Government will come back with a response to the points that I and Deputy Deenihan have raised.  There is a genuine concern among a small minority of farmers and that must be addressed.

2541	SeanSherlock	Labour	13099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-17 00:00:00	Prelude	208	" I am reminded of ""Joe the plumber"".  If he was looking at us and examining this scheme, would he and his family have confidence that the scheme being implemented would be suitable to his needs and requirements?  He would not.  When the Minister first announced the scheme——"
2542	SeanSherlock	Labour	13099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-17 00:00:00	Prelude	211	" I will put my question.  The Minister promised he would go in deep.  This scheme allows for the possibility of going in deep without going in deep to the banks.  I see nothing in the scheme that changes the regulatory framework we have seen heretofore.  My question is specifically on page 11 of the scheme, point 45, where the Minister refers to corporate social responsibility.  He states, ""The Irish Banking Federation, on behalf of all covered institutions, submits a bi-annual report to the Minister on goals and targets laid down by the Minister in relation to corporate social responsibility"".  I would like the Minister to elaborate on that statement because until we can force a recalibration of the modus of corporate social responsibility and how banks do their business, it will be more of the same and there will be no change to the banking culture.  There must be a change to the banking culture.  That question is on the minds of the people I represent and it is a legitimate question. I would like a further teasing out of the appointment of non-executive directors.  The Minister previously spoke about the problems that would arise about the legal personality if one were to appoint people directly to the board.  Is there no provision that can be made that would serve the public interest by amending any legal provisions that would give the people the power as overseeing executives on boards of banks? This State pays the Financial Regulator and his offices €57 million per annum.  We have seen no bang for our buck.  Nothing in this document——"
2543	SeanSherlock	Labour	13099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-17 00:00:00	Prelude	213	 I will.  I see nothing in this document that will give any solace, see any change or increase the powers of the Financial Regulator or see him use the powers he has.  There are questions over that.

2553	SeanSherlock	Labour	13104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	752	 In bringing forward these draconian measures the Government has alienated the most vulnerable section of our society.  Those who have reached the autumn years of their lives once had the cushion, the safety and the peace of mind of knowing they could go to a GP in an hour of need, but that luxury is no longer afforded to them.  We had lectures last week from the Taoiseach about his republican and egalitarian ideals.  What was done and visited upon these people last week was neither republican nor truly egalitarian.  It ran counter to anything that is republican or egalitarian. In the short time I have, I implore the Government to reverse this decision.  If the thousands of people who came onto the streets of Dublin today are anything to go by in terms of delivering a short sharp message to the Government, today was the day it happened.  The Government must listen to those people who have reached their autumn years and are now worried and full of angst about these measures.  If we are truly to be a republic in the purest sense of that word, we must reverse this measure.

2558	SeanSherlock	Labour	13105.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	322	 I can confirm that a devolved grant will be provided to the school to which the  Deputy refers to make good the damage to the school building. In the meantime the Department is working with the school to find a solution to  the schools immediate accommodation needs and the Department expects to have a  satisfactory solution in place when the school returns for mid term break. In relation to progression of the schools permanent project, the Department is  cognisant of the site restrictions  which would impede further expansion of the existing school. Greenfield  provision for this school will be considered in the context of the Department's  on-going multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.
2559	SeanSherlock	Labour	13111.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	" Every time I walk into this Chamber, I pass a statue of Thomas Davis, a fellow Mallow man famous for the quote, ""educate that you may be free"".  The Government, by its actions in recent weeks, has sought to curb these freedoms.  When Davis spoke of freedom, he may have spoken in the context of political liberation but he also spoke in the context of the freedom of ideas, thought and consciousness. If we are to educate our children in this nation in the context that Davis spoke about we must give them all the tools we can.  The Government, by its actions last week, sought to limit those freedoms and limit the giving of those tools to those children and it should be ashamed of its actions. When I look across the benches of this House I see certain Members of the Green Party playing the Tadhg an dá thaobh and running with the hare and hunting with the hound.  I say to them that if they are true to their political conscience and creed they will vote with the Labour Party on this motion and vote for the children of the nation and for the proper education policy that we wish to see in this land. In speaking to this motion I speak for the schools in my constituency.  I speak for the children of Ballyhooley national school and the people in Carrigtwohill, Fermoy, the Mercy national school in Cobh, Midleton College and Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann.  These are among many who made representations to me about the swingeing cutbacks that will be implemented and the adverse effects they will have on the day to day operations of their schools. It must be admitted that great strides have been made in many aspects of education during the past ten years, although not at a pace we would wish to see.  However, it is wrong for any Government to roll back those achievements in one fell swoop and send us headlong back to where we were in the 1980s.  This is not the mark of a nation making progress.  I urge the Government to think hard about its actions. If we are going to flourish as a nation we must look to future generations.  The way we can flourish, socially and economically, is by ensuring every child bar none has the best chance in life he or she can have and having an education system that is world class.  Anything else is not what we want. This motion is reasonable.  It speaks to the genuine fears the people have about the way they see the education system going.  The people beyond these walls, the people of this land, who have shouted loudly, and thank God for their voices, do not want to see their children treated this way nor should the Legislature treat their children this way.  We want to give them a fair chance and a fair opportunity.  This is what we seek through this motion. On Friday, as I walked down the main street of Mallow I was approached by transition year students from St. Mary's secondary school.  They flocked around me to tell me they will not be able to carry out many of the projects and aspirations they have for their transition year because of the cuts.  They asked me to let their voices be heard in Dáil Éireann when next I spoke on the subject.  I speak for those girls and for the aspirations they have.  I speak for the aspirations I had when I was their age and for the educational opportunities I had which were limited because of the times I grew up in during the 1980s.  Do not send the education system back to the 1980s.  Let us think forward and consider the investment that can be made now and the payoffs in the long run as a result."
2560	SeanSherlock	Labour	13111.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	 The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  The recent budgetary announcements did not affect the criteria used for the allocation of additional teaching and care resources for children with special educational needs.
2561	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	137	 This is to do with legislation.
2562	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	450	 I will get the same answer that Deputy Michael Creed got.
2563	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	457	 It is clear from the earlier reply to Deputy Michael Creed that the Minister will not budge on this issue.  Today, a recently widowed lady contacted me whose son wishes to take over the family farm holding.  He would have been an ideal applicant for these two schemes.  However, as they were going through a process of grant of probate, he was not in a position to send his application before 14 October.  The legal instrument went against him and took longer than anticipated.  Will the Minister allow for some degree of discretion and fairness for those who were in the process of applying?  On 14 October the two schemes were cut down in one fell swoop without any notice period.  That did not allow individuals, such as those I have just mentioned, to have some fairness in submitting their applications.  If they had some notice, they might have come into the scheme.  Cutting the schemes off on 14 October was the wrong way to go about it.  Will the Minister revisit his decisions for the sake of equity and fairness?
2564	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	460	 Nobody questions the validity of the scheme or its success.  We all agree that Government policy has been sound in this regard.  What we are asking for is some degree of discretion.  There should be an extension beyond 14 October to allow these people to make their applications.  There must be some degree of flexibility on this issue.  As has already been said, those people who were on the point of making their applications had a reasonable expectation, because they had gone through the process of applying, that they would be within the timeframe.  The Minister has carried out a miserly and mean-spirited act towards those who set out in good faith to participate in the scheme.  It is a sad indictment of current Government policy.
2565	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	462	 The Minister should tell that to the widow I mentioned.
2566	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	544	 The original question was based on the premise that budgetary cuts have been applied across the board in the agriculture sector.  This is the only opportunity available to me to highlight some of those cuts.  For example, investment in research and training has decreased by 13%.  Similar reductions have been applied in areas like food safety, health and welfare, plant health, income and market supports and income supports for disadvantaged areas.  When one examines the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's entire programme of expenditure, one has to conclude that the Government's ability to implement the programme for Government is seriously hampered.  Those of us responsible for the agriculture brief have not been given any legislation to consider since the last election.  When will the animal welfare Bill be published, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government?  The extensive consultation period in that regard does not seem to have come to a conclusion.  On what date will it be concluded?  I would also like to ask about the proposed establishment of an all-Ireland GM-free zone.  When does the Department envisage that this process will be concluded and this policy will be implemented?
2567	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	546	 When does the Minister envisage that the target of dedicating 5% of acreage to organic farmland will be reached?  The European Commission recently announced that it does not envisage that mandatory country of origin labelling will be introduced.  The programme for Government states that mandatory country of origin food labelling will be extended to sheep, pig and poultry meat.  Will that measure be implemented?
2568	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	554	 On the modulation issue, I am reassured to a certain extent by the Minister's statement on the move from pillar one to pillar two.  Is there a political appetite in the Council of Ministers for the rate of change from pillar 1 to pillar 2 as envisaged by the Commission proposal?  My second question is on climate change proposals.  There is a view that the basis of measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is predicated on a faulty methodology.  Will the Minister examine that methodology and request an independent, scientific analysis of it?  It will have far-reaching effects on Irish agriculture and that is the reason for my question.
2569	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	574	 It is clear that there are still issues of concern relating to Brazilian beef.  While I welcome the Minister of State's reply and acknowledge that beef exports from Brazil are confined to a small number of herds, the amounts within those herds would probably far outweigh the Irish national herd.  The numbers in question are still significant. I welcome the Minister of State's reply and accept that the Department has chosen the correct course of action in the circumstances.
2570	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	577	 Am I to take it that the answer is the same as that given for Question No. 8?
2571	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	580	 I wish to ask a supplementary question.
2572	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	583	 I will take the answer as read but I wish to state that money is being taken out of farmers' real income here.  Some of the measures that have been implemented in this budget, including this one, will bring about a further demise in agricultural productivity.
2573	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	585	 The Department has ridden roughshod over some of those programmes since then.  The Minister is being very selective, with all due respect.
2574	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	587	 The farm waste management scheme is a result of obligations under European Commission rules which had to be implemented.
2575	SeanSherlock	Labour	13112.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-10-30 00:00:00	Prelude	597	 These measures will further undermine the rural economy and that is the bottom line.

2595	SeanSherlock	Labour	13117.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	" I will begin with a quotation from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment report entitled Innovation in Ireland published in 2008: Ireland's ability to build and sustain its innovation capacity depends on developing and maintaining our skills at world-class levels, and on high quality, continuous education.  Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability;... I repeat the second sentence: ""Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability"".  I listened carefully to the Minister and it is hard to disagree with what has been said in that one senses there is a proactive approach and a continuation of strategies to maintain employment.  However, were I one of the 32,000 plus persons made redundant and thus having to apply between 1 January and the end of this month for assistance under the redundancy scheme, this would not provide me with too much solace. I know of a particular apprentice — there are hundreds like him — who, even if he wanted, could not return to complete his course because there are no jobs in his particular field.  The construction industry has dried up.  The proof of this is the current lack of house building.  Given these trends, apprentices are reluctant to continue their training. I know of an apprentice who, having completed his leaving certificate examination in 2006, decided to embark on a few years' travelling.  When he returned home he took up an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker but was subsequently laid off.  He then decided, given the trends that were emerging, to do a public relations course.  When the person concerned, who was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, approached the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of a place on a public relations course he was told he would have to be signing on for 156 days before he would quality for the back-to-education allowance.  This is wherein the nub of the problem lies. I referred earlier to the thousands of people already laid-off and made redundant, many of whom want to get back into the education sphere.  I acknowledge the €1.5 billion allocation for FÁS and the investment in SMEs.  However, many of the people who previously worked in research and development and high-end IT jobs now want to do MBAs and to upskill but there is no mechanism through which they can re-enter the FÁS or SME framework without their incurring serious economic hardship.  These people do not qualify for third level grants or the back-to-education allowance as they are already in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance. Were I on the opposite side of the House I would be re-examining the demographics of this situation in terms of where the lay-offs have taken place and the educational attainment of those involved.  I would also be much more flexible in my approach, which is what the Government will have to be if unemployment continues to rise.  A person who is eligible for jobseeker's allowance for 12 months should also be eligible for a back-to-education allowance if he or she wishes to upskill by re-entering the education system. The 22,500 people currently engaged in community employment schemes do exceptional work.  However, many of these people are hampered after a few years by the principle of progression, of which we hear so much.  I would also be a little more flexible in respect of the requirement to quit a community employment scheme after a specified period.  I would allow for a greater degree of flexibility in terms of permitting these people, where possible, to continue to work in their communities and would pay them the allowances required in this regard.  This would help to sustain communities and would provide these people with employment. There have been lay-offs in a wide range of areas, including agriculture, banking, finance and insurance.  A wide array of people will not necessarily fit into the training schemes envisaged by Government.  Many people working in the energy, manufacturing, building and civil engineering areas have been laid-off and will not get work any time soon.  Many of them were reliant on the construction industry and on the IT sector, in particular the research and development component of the IT sector, an area almost always hit first during a downturn.  These people are unable to return to the education system unless they pay for it themselves.  While an unemployed single person with savings has a good chance of accessing a third level course, an unemployed person within a family structure will need to put aside every penny to meet his or her family circumstances. The Government needs to apply some lateral thinking in this area.  It does not appear to have internalised the full extent of the problems facing unemployed people in the future.  Instead of quoting chapter and verse in this House on that which we know already — one has only to look at the Departments' websites to learn what is being spent — it should bring forth fresh ideas in regard to how our people can upskill. I acknowledge the investment in FÁS training for installation schemes and so on.  It was once said to me that the next boom might result from our having to fix some of the faulty and dodgy houses constructed in haste during the past ten years.  It may be that such a scheme will be required.  However, we must also cater for high end jobs.  We must bear in mind that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are currently unemployed. We need to look after those people who will not necessarily fit into the mechanism prescribed by the two Ministers in their response.  I reiterate the Government's words that individuals need to respond.  Individuals want to respond to the changing market and to this downturn.  However, they may want to diversify into completely different areas of education.  This, for some people, is an opportunity to re-assess from where they come.  If we are talking about entrepreneurial spirit in this country, the only way it can be reinvigorated is if the €179 million allocated to Science Foundation Ireland or €90 million spent on encouraging FDI is re-examined and perhaps apportioned at least in part to localised schemes for people who have that kind of spirit and who wish to create indigenous and SME-type industry."
2596	SeanSherlock	Labour	13117.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	249	 The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.  What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago. In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006 which, inter alia, suggested that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  Therefore, while having to make difficult decisions for the 2009 estimates, particularly in the current financial climate, my main focus has been to retain resources in the schools targeted under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) initiative. DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools have been included in the programme.  These comprise 673 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools. In the case of those schools that have not been identified for inclusion in DEIS it will now be necessary to withdraw disadvantaged posts and additional financial resources from them with effect from 31 August 2009.  These resources had been historically provided to schools under previous disadvantage schemes. As the school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme it is now necessary to withdraw its Disadvantaged Areas scheme post and additional financial resources with effect from 31 August 2009.

In the case of those schools that have not been identified for inclusion in DEIS it will now be necessary to withdraw disadvantaged posts and additional financial resources from them with effect from 31 August 2009.  These resources had been historically provided to schools under previous disadvantage schemes. As the school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme it is now necessary to withdraw its Disadvantaged Areas scheme post and additional financial resources with effect from 31 August 2009.

2609	SeanSherlock	Labour	13138.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-25 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 One question needs to be addressed regarding this banking crisis, namely whether the Government guarantee will result in the writing off of private debt and turning that into public debt for which the Irish citizen will ultimately pay.  In that context, should we be contemplating the writing off of private debt to avoid a probable recourse to the taxpayer?  In September of this year, the Central Bank published data showing that the M1 money supply — the physical currency circulating in the economy and the moneys held on deposit accounts — is shrinking rapidly.  What does the 11% year-on-year decrease in the M1 money supply tell us?  Irish businesses have less money in their accounts.  They have become stifled, they cannot repay their debts and they cannot access credit.  If Irish businesses are not able to repay their debts or access credit, the banks will incur further losses.  Who will cover such losses?  The bank guarantee scheme provides for the Irish taxpayer to cover losses to banks through shrinkage in the economy.  If banking activity is shrinking, then bank losses are inevitable. The Labour Party is proposing a set of practical measures, as outlined by Deputy Penrose, to stimulate the economy.  The European Investment Bank, rather than the private equity capitalists, has to become our saviour.  Private equity capitalists do not care about the future of the Irish economy.  As soon as they get their pound of flesh, they move on to the next target.  It should be noted that the Carlyle Group, which is currently flirting with one of this country's banks, was funded by Osama bin Laden's family at one stage of its history.  I wish to make it clear that we are dealing with people of that kind.  We should be very careful about who we flirt with when we are looking for people to invest in the Irish economy and the Irish banking infrastructure. The Labour Party is in favour of sustainable and responsible investment.  That has not been a mainstream feature of this country's banking culture.  Having a sustainable and responsible approach to investment is not part of Irish banking culture.  There is no proper risk assessment of lending and there is no proper model of corporate social responsibility.  As Deputy Penrose has said, we need to change the culture of banking in this country so that we begin to lend in the real economy.  Irish businesses should not continue to be stifled, as they have been stifled to date.  The new type of lending we advocate will, inter alia, champion social capital.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, used to speak about Mr. Putnam’s book, Bowling Alone, in the context of the need for volunteerism and investment in social capital.  Why should we not use the banking guarantee scheme that the Government is sponsoring as a means of ensuring that we enforce change in this country’s banking culture and thereby enhance investment in social capital?  Why should preferential lending rates, below the ECB rate, not be offered to community organisations, sporting clubs and schools for any measure that involves effort that enhances our communities? The banking crisis has given us an opportunity to set up an ecological loan book, whereby preferential lending rates can be made available to commercial and domestic projects that seek to reduce our dependence on carbon.  Such loans would be offered in respect of everything from residential solar panels to biodiesel plants.  Such a system would help us to offset some of the obligations we have under the Kyoto Protocol.  We need to be imaginative in our approach to lending and getting out of this crisis.  Nothing I have seen from the Government benches gives me confidence, as a Member of this House and as a citizen, that this country is in safe hands and that our banking infrastructure is secure for the future.

I support the request made last week for a debate in the House on the implications of the CAP health check, which will have far-reaching effects on Irish agriculture and the way we do business within the rural economy. With regard to the mental capacity Bill, the Law Reform Commission report has been in existence since 2006.  When will the Bill be published?  The Taoiseach has previously said it will be introduced in mid-2009.  I ask that it be published forthwith.

2613	SeanSherlock	Labour	13139.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	502	 The Minister for Finance made a call to patriotic action.  It was more of a cull in terms of patriotic action because despite the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the current difficulties we face and the external factors that have affected this economy, there was no imagination in terms of the framing of this budget.  There was little by way of providing an economic stimulus that would create jobs and build a foundation on which we could climb out of this morass if not in the short term at least in the medium term.  Instead of putting in place some inventive measures, the Government decided to slash and burn across the divide. To take one sector, agriculture is a primary producer.  Food and drink exports amount to €8.2 billion to €8.6 billion every year but at a time when production was going on in that sector and in the face of a global food scarcity, the Government decided to take money out of that productive part of the economy by way of cuts in the installation aid scheme and not extending the farm waste management scheme. It has been proven that every euro spent within the rural economy has a multiplier effect and it stays within the rural economy.  In cutting the installation aid scheme and other such schemes, the Government is automatically reducing that multiplier effect and the potential within what was a productive sector.  That did not make economic sense.  I ask the Minister, when replying, to address that particular aspect because we need to be imaginative about the direction in which this country is going in this tough economic climate. The issue of VAT is one on which I would like the Minister to respond.  If we are in an inflationary period and if there is less money in the economy, and public and consumer sentiment is non-existent, why would the Minister increase VAT at a time when people are not spending money?  The returns to the Exchequer will be significantly reduced anyway.  If the Minister could stimulate such demand by reducing VAT he would, by extension, increase returns to the Exchequer.  That seems to be the most logical approach.  He should not increase VAT but maintain it at the current rate or reduce it marginally but he certainly should not increase it in the current climate.  I do not understand the reason the Minister has done that, and perhaps we could get an answer as to his logic in that regard. On the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 relating to research and development activity, we all agree that foreign direct investment has been very good for this country.  That is something that has been a bedrock of policy for a number of years but we need to consider whether we should continue to rely on foreign direct investment. I welcome the tax credits for research and development but I again question the reason for the base year of 2003.  If a company is involved in research and development there is a good possibility that its research could predate that date.  I would have favoured 2000 as a base year to try to exercise a credit of that nature but perhaps there is a logic to the Minister's position on that.  He might respond to that when replying. On the issue of banking, we need some consistency.  Banks, by their very nature, have been profligate in the way they have lent in that much of it was developer led.  There is an opportunity now through this State guarantee to enforce a new culture on banking.  I argued last night in our Private Members' motion that an ecological loan book could be set up.  At a time when not everybody will be eligible for the national insulation scheme we could set up a system of preferential rates that would allow people to borrow for improvements to their homes that would offset carbon.  As I understand that scheme, the State has the control to enforce that type of lending and I do not understand why it does not do that.  That would have a knock-on multiplier effect in terms of job creation.  If preferential loans could be given to people who are not eligible for grant aid for home improvements, it would have a positive knock-on effect for the local economy.  We need a little more imagination.  While we all acknowledge the position we are in, four Ministers are involved in the Enterprise, Trade and Employment brief and surely many actions can be taken to stimulate the economy.  This party has given many ideas about what we would do if we were on that side of the House and there is scope for those to be taken on board. There has been much battering of the public sector of late.  I know umpteen local authority outdoor staff on Cork County Council's northern division who have been let go.  They were either on temporary contracts or had tendered for jobs.  One of them has worked for the council as a JCB operator for more than 30 years of his life, was out on call at 2 a.m., 5 a.m. or whenever the council wanted him and gave a good service.  If we are to have an argument in this House about culling the public service we must be careful.
2614	SeanSherlock	Labour	13139.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	504	 We must acknowledge that workers of that nature on the front line, who served their local authorities well and had great loyalty to them and to the people they served, are being let go.
2615	SeanSherlock	Labour	13139.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	506	 There are people working in FÁS offices throughout this country with whom I deal on a daily basis through community employment schemes.

2616	SeanSherlock	Labour	13139.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	723	 Like the people of Dromakeenan, the people of Buttevant are proud of where they come from.  They have an equally dire need for a new school.  They have been campaigning for such a school for over 11 years.  When I was a member of Cork County Council, we co-ordinated with the local VEC on the rezoning of a specific parcel of land to allow the new school to be developed.  That site was purchased over 12 months ago.  As I understand it, a schedule of accommodation was submitted in September of this year.  Nothing has come back from the Department yet.  The school authorities are seeking the appointment of a design team.  Such an appointment should not incur an undue cost.  On behalf of the community, I want the next stage of the process to be reached. Like their counterparts in hundreds of schools throughout the State, the pupils and teachers of the vocational school in Buttevant are having to work in dire circumstances.  The building in question dates back to pre-Famine times.  Its structures are not in line with what one would expect to see in a modern school.  Notwithstanding the financial circumstances the State finds itself in, if it is to be progressive it needs to move this project onto the next stage.  That would not involve a major outlay.  All I am calling for at this stage is the progression of the project — it should not be stalled. I will leave it at that because I have summed up my point.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter in the past and have raised it on the Adjournment previously.  I will continue to raise this issue.  I appreciate that the Minister of State will give me a pro forma reply.  I appeal to the official in the Department of Education and Science who will be responsible for reading the transcript of this debate to take up this case and try to move it on to the next stage.

2623	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	428	 I will share time with Deputies Penrose and Ferris.
2624	SeanSherlock	Labour	13145.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	430	 I wish to begin by replying to Deputy Collins.  Not every farmer in the country wants to build houses or become a developer on his or her land-holding.  Those people are in the minority.  I remind the Deputy that the arrangements he spoke about are only guidelines and that the county development plans of each county take precedence over those guidelines.  In response to Deputy Brady, the Government in question was not a Democratic Left-led Government.  There were three parties in that particular arrangement. I represent a party that traditionally would not be aligned to the farming community.  However, in terms of my wholehearted supported for this motion, I can give an analysis that is unfettered and devoid of political expediency.  I do not intend to be politically expedient tonight, but to speak of the facts. We reside in a European Union where UK young farmers represent 5.6% of the total farming workforce and Irish young farmers represent 10.5%.  These percentages are from a report from the European Parliament issued in May 2008 and represent farmers under the age of 35.  If we are to be innovative in the manner we create jobs during the current downturn, we need to create incentives.  The only way to create incentives is to ensure that coterie of the population — the under 35s — who are interested in becoming involved in agriculture get the financial incentives to do so. There is an economic rationale for ensuring the early retirement scheme and installation aid scheme for young farmers are maintained.  By allowing these new farmers to enter the sector, which is a productive sector and generates revenues of €8.6 billion per annum in food and drink exports about which the Minister spoke, we encourage innovation.  However, by culling the scheme, we create a disincentive.  At a time when, for example, FÁS has a budget of €1.05 billion, we have spent €48.4 billion on the indigenous sector through Enterprise Ireland and we are spending €90 million on capital expenditure for IDA Ireland, all of which is for job creation, there is a ratio of that kind of investment for every job created.  Therefore, every job created costs the economy a certain amount, a specific figure which I have not been able to ascertain. Therefore, by creating, allowing or facilitating the installation aid scheme and by investing in each and every one of the young farmers new to the sector, the Government is progressing the sector and creating a job, or in economic terms a multiplier effect, that ensures the rural economy will continue to be maintained.  This is a rational, objective and cold view that is devoid of any political expediency. These schemes are essential if we are to maintain our comparative advantage within the rural economy.  If the Government continues to remove funds from the rural economy, the rural depopulation we have witnessed, the lack of proper infrastructure and the lack of expenditure within that economy will have a further detrimental effect.  Any person who avails of a scheme such as the young farmer installation aid does not spend the money in Santa Ponsa, but invests it in his or her own farmholding, generally in a way that is innovative and will increase the yield or return to that farm. To return to the demographics, the bulk of farmers are within a certain age group and there is a certain wisdom that comes with that intergenerational solidarity that occurs within the sector.  However, with every new influx of blood, there comes new ideas.  We talk about issues such as carbon off-setting and the possibility of micro-energy production, but if we talk about innovative ideas, we need to ensure the incentive is there to allow young people come into the sector.  What the Minister has done by culling the scheme is to disincentivise them and that is not the way to go. I represent a rural-urban mix of a constituency.  My constituency traditionally had large agribusiness interests, but these have declined over a period of time.  There is now a real opportunity for people of my generation to come into the sector.  These people will have a farming mix that will involve energy creation and a different type of product mix that will yield benefits to the country in the long run.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to rethink the changes. I conclude by quoting from Macra na Feirme, which has a rational position on these issues: Macra is demanding the complete reopening of the young farmer installation aid scheme.  This scheme was agreed under the Social Partnership for 2007-2013 and is co-funded by the EU. If it is a co-funded procedure devised under social partnership pillars, we must honour the agreement, just as we honour all the other pillars of the social partnership arrangement in the country.

Last night he indicated: ""I wanted to ensure that the changes in the health check initiative will open the possibility for some useful action.""  Now the Minister is stating that he ""may"" use some of the €24 million fund to support the sheep sector.  What the farmers who are protesting on Kildare Street want to know is whether the fund will be used.  Will the Minister give a definitive commitment that he will honour the statement that was made at the conference in Limoges?  Given that the Minister has committed to meeting representatives of the sector, will he move the date of 16 December forward given that the farmers are protesting outside Leinster House?  It would be courteous if the Minister committed to meeting them earlier than 16 December."

2633	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	389	 The Minister should just answer the question.
2634	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	399	 Will the Minister clarify whether the original ratio in the rural development package was to be 50:50 between EU funding and Exchequer funding?  In the event of Exchequer funding being at 25%, will the Government commit to that funding in light of the new modulation or the Common Agricultural Policy health check package?
2635	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	401	 I welcome the Minister's statement in terms of the commitment on modulation and how it is to be ringfenced within agriculture.  That is vitally important and is something I have raised with the Minister previously.  There should be no leakage of that commitment into other sectors, or into non-governmental, community and voluntary pillars.  That is essential. Does the Minister not agree that the €170 million package delivered by the CAP will be delivered by farmers themselves?  The 1% increase in quota will effectively come down to the farmer who gets up every day to milk more cows.  The Minister is overselling the package somewhat.  It was widely thought that the 1% increases in quota were coming down the track in any event. Will the Minister explain the €70 million that is in the balance?  Some €100 million will be provided for additional milk production and there is an extra €70 million.  Will the Minister clarify how this extra sum will be designated?
2636	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	461	 On a point of order, did the Minister state the EU has not sought any regulation in this regard to harmonise the situation?

Anyway, as somebody who posed the question, even though it is in the name of Deputy Liz McManus, I wish to put on record that I do not see why this is so, there is not any legal impediment and there is no European Union directive that states that the Minister cannot extend the deadline to allow for this scheme to be implemented.  The scheme is revenue neutral. I do not see why, if it can be done on one part of this island, it cannot be done on another part of this island.  It defies logic.  Farmers in the North are farming the same types of land as farmers in the South.  I cannot see the logic of the Government's position on this matter.  I do not see why the Minister cannot change his mind on it.  I ask the Minister to consider changing his mind on it.
2639	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	652	 Hear, hear.
2640	SeanSherlock	Labour	13146.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	810	 I raise this issue because there is deep concern in Fermoy about proposals made by the OPW to replace the weir in the town with a rock ramp pass.  People fear for their rowing club which some argue has been in existence since Adam was a boy.  They fear that if the weir is replaced by a rock ramp, it will have untold consequences for the water level in the River Blackwater, thus negating the amenity value of the rowing club. Why is the Government proceeding with this folly?  There is no justification for the project.  The OPW's flood alleviation works were sanctioned and welcomed but it is now seeking to change the weir, to which there seems to be no logic.  When I put a question to the Minister on the issue on 4 November, I was told the direction had been issued in the interests of conserving wild salmon resources and avoiding the initiation of infringement proceedings by the European Commission under the habitats directive on foot of a complaint lodged with the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission. Given that the Government is seeking to adhere to the habitats directive, the people of Fermoy and I would like to know the nature of the complaint and who lodged it.  We want to know the justification for it.  If it is to ensure enough salmon can get up the river, plenty of salmon are being caught by rod on the river.  It does not require the destruction of the weir to ensure more salmon can get up the river because there is a much cheaper solution that would ensure the continuation of a fish pass without compromising the valuable amenity constituted by the rowing club in Fermoy. We want to ensure the future viability of the rowing club.  We do not see the economic justification for the proposal in the current climate.  If the Minister of State tells me that the project is being carried out by the OPW because Fermoy Town Council cannot afford to do so, she should note that the former Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, visited the town in 2006.  Two years have passed since his visit and the project is to be hitched to an OPW flood alleviation plan, to which there is no logic to whatsoever.  The people of Fermoy cannot comprehend it. The EU habitats directive is being used as a battering ram to carry out the project.  There is no justification for this.  If there was a complaint lodged to the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission, will the Minister of State make a copy of it available to the House in order that Members will know exactly who is behind the works?  I do not believe for one moment that the OPW is fully responsible and believe there are other mechanisms at play.  I would go so far as to say the Southern Regional Fisheries Board is the main instigator and that it is seeking to justify its position.  It will gladly sacrifice a rowing club to this end but should realise that, ultimately, as many salmon will get up the river without a rock ramp as they would if one were installed.  Hiding behind the fallacy of a habitats directive is typical of a Government which has used the European Union when it wants to push through some bad proposals.  This project will have an adverse effect on the community in Fermoy.  I ask the Government to rethink its strategy, particularly in the current economic climate.

2665	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	 On the basis that the debate will take place forthwith, I wish to withdraw my submission, with the permission of the Chair.
2666	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	55	 I will share time with Deputy Willie Penrose. I express solidarity with all pig producers in the organic and non-organic sector, craft butchers, processors and every worker who has been adversely affected by this crisis.  Public health and consumer confidence must be restored immediately.  This will be the indicator of the future viability of the pigmeat industry.  Producers have been unfairly plunged into a crisis which is not of their making.  Farms which purchased contaminated feed did so in good faith and on the basis that the product was licensed. The pork industry is the fourth largest in the agriculture sector and is worth approximately €400 million per annum.  I understand exports of pigmeat were worth €212 million in 2007.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the fact that only ten of a possible 400 producers have been affected by contaminated feed.  I understand the producers in question produce less than 10% of the overall kill.  The minimal number of producers affected should help restore public confidence because if the figures I cite are correct, 90% of the pig kill is beyond reproach and scientific evidence will show that the risk to human health diminishes significantly. We cannot underestimate the importance of the meat industry.  Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach and Minister, I note that neither of them referred to a timeline for the return of pork to the shelves.  I understood from the Taoiseach that the European Food Safety Authority must make this call from a scientific perspective.  I call on the authority and European Commission to make allowance for the importance of the meat industry to this State.  These institutions must act as soon as possible to ensure products are placed on the shelves again and public confidence restored.  If the European Union will not provide a compensation package, at least Commissioner Kuneva and the EFSA should issue a statement within 24 to 48 hours indicating that production can commence again. The true test of patriotism, if I may use that word, is to stand in solidarity on this issue.  We should not use it to score political points off the Minister.  We all know family farmers or workers in processing plants whose livelihoods depend on a viable pig and beef industry.  At the same time, however, fundamental questions must be asked of the Department.  I call on the Minister to act with greater urgency and to implore the European Commission to make a statement forthwith to enable the industry to start working again. While the Government was correct to introduce a total recall of pork products, if the problem affected less than 10% of producers and 90% of pork products are thereby deemed to be safe and fit for human consumption, the Minister should have made a statement in the 24 to 48 hour period following the total recall indicating that production could recommence.  He should clarify the reason this has not been done. If the traceability system was working adequately and the one-step-up, one-step-back principle was being adhered to, it would have been possible to isolate the relevant producers and stop their production.  This would have allowed other producers who never used this material to continue to provide product for the market.  This issue must also be addressed. The national feed inspection programme is a rigorous regime applied to all primary producers, whether pig or beef farmers.  Everything which reaches the farm gate is subject to the most stringent inspection controls in the world.  Why did the inspection process for feedstuffs fail in respect of the producer in question?  The systems failure which occurred has significantly diminished the potential of the pig and pigmeat industry.  The sector will take a long time to claw its way back to its previous position.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. We need to show solidarity with all the players in the industry.  This is a national issue on which the Labour Party will support the Minister in every step of the process.  Nevertheless, the problem must be handled with a greater sense of urgency.
2667	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	87	 I have three questions.  Will there be a new regulatory framework dealing with non-food grade oil, as I understand it?  My second question relates to the routine sample of pork fat.  The Minister stated on 28 November that a routine sample of pork fat taken as part of his Department's national residue monitoring programme was shown to be positive for the presence of non-dioxin-like marker PCBs.  Is there routine testing for PCBs on an ongoing basis throughout the food industry?  On Friday, 28 November we were told that this indicative testing took place.  On 4 December the Department issued a press release confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.  The Dutch authorities contacted the Department and the FSAI regarding their independent investigation.  When they communicated that, how long had the Dutch authorities' investigation been in train?  When was the rapid alert system kicked into action?  This is also an important point.  The Minister has told us this all happened on this island, effectively.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests the rapid alert kicked in long before this process and we need some clarification on that point.
2668	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	114	 On a point of order, if that trade notice went out and the product is verifiable, why is stock not back on the shelves in pork butchers throughout the country?
2669	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	155	 On a point of order, we have only had one question from this side of the House so far.
2670	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	344	 I wish to share time with Deputy Willie Penrose and I propose to take seven minutes.
2671	SeanSherlock	Labour	13152.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	346	 Something that does not necessarily relate to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, given that we do not have many opportunities to discuss fisheries is the additional funding emergency measures were agreed in July.  It is still urgent that progress be made to make funds available at the earliest possible date.  I understand that the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, has made submissions and there is an ongoing campaign.  We all know that fuel prices have decreased dramatically but the cost inputs for fishermen during that period were significant as were losses incurred during that period.  We should support that measure. Will that €37 million expenditure be expedited?  Perhaps the officials could revert to us in due course on this matter. With the pending December Council of Ministers meeting due on 18 and 19 December, it is important that this House give time to debating the issues at hand.  I have had some significant briefings today from the FIF, more specifically from the Irish South and West Fish Producers' Organisation, on the issues.  It is worth reiterating some of the points they make. They state that the decisions taken at the December Council meeting will be vital to the future of the industry.  I note the Minister of State said he supports the appropriate conservation measures for Celtic Sea cod such as spawning area closures which were originally proposed by fishermen and are delivering positive effects on stock levels in that area.  The organisation's position is such that it proposes that the creation of a sub-divided management area separating the English Channel from the rest of the existing Celtic Sea, has certain implications for Ireland.  The organisation's briefing paper states: The separation of Area VIId, the English Channel, from the remainder of Area VIIb-k for the purposes of management, and the establishment of a separate Total Allowable Catch for that area has significant implications for the Irish fishing industry. While the measure is not objectionable in itself, the subdivision of the stock must not disadvantage Irish fishermen by directly dividing the quotas, giving Ireland quota in an area (VIId) where Irish fishermen do not fish. Irish fishermen catch most of the Cod in the west of the existing management area, to the south of Ireland.  This must be reflected in the new subdivision of quota between the management areas. I could not have put the argument any better. With regard to the proposals on the fishing effort, there is a school of thought that suggests that the European Commission is effectively re-writing, after the fact, the decision reached by the Council.  The FIF state that the Commission is re-writing the text of the decision on fishing effort in the Irish Sea and the north west which was reached at last month's EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  This cannot be allowed as it would mean an immediate 25% cut in fishing possibilities in 2009, from what was in the decision which was in itself misguided, draconian and punitive.  The November Council of Fisheries Ministers reached a decision on a new and intensified series of measures for fisheries in the Irish Sea and the north west.  I also understand that the Irish Government and industry succeeded in thwarting the efforts to have this approach extended to the south and west coasts.  The FIF has stated this to me today.  The measure agreed which affect the Irish Sea and north west, clearly curtailed fishing effort in the form of kilowatt-days to the amount of effort in previous base years.  It has only come to light in recent days that the Commission is going significantly beyond what was agreed and it now proposes in 2009 to impose a further 25% cut from the base effort.  This is contrary to all understanding of what was agreed.  I understand the Minister may share this position but he needs to put it on the record of the House at some stage. I note the Minister of State's statement on the Hague Preferences, that they are an integral part of the TAC, total allowable catch and quota allocations system and they must continue to be allocated or formally incorporated into the TAC and quota system and not perhaps subjected to the annual approval which they must undergo.  I understand the point made by the Minister of State when he states that certain member states would seek to denigrate or downgrade that agreement.  The position adopted by the FIF in continuing to ensure that the Hague issues are maintained, is paramount to the industry in the future.  More recently there has been positive interplay between the fishermen's organisations and the Minister.  The emergency package agreed in July, however, needs to be expedited.  It is a matter of grave importance to the industry.

2679	SeanSherlock	Labour	13153.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	451	 The amendment in the Bill that replaces section 45(5)(a) of the Health Act 1970, coupled with the fair deal legislation on nursing homes, by their very nature, seek to destroy any semblance of public provision and universality in the health care system, as it relates to older people.  The research indicates that 20,000 people who have had access to a medical card will no longer have such an entitlement.  This sends the wrong message about how the country deals with public health to those who are in their autumn years.  Notwithstanding the pre-existing deal done with general pracititioners, whereby the payment per patient would be significantly more than it is today, the health outcomes for patients in that category were significantly better as a result of having a universal right to a medical card.  For men, in particular, having the medical card meant a much greater likelihood that they would go to their GP to monitor their health.  I know of people in my constituency who were more inclined to go because they had the medical card.  From talking to GPs, I also know that they achieved far better outcomes for their patients owing to the entitlement to a medical card.  When we talk about public health and primary care provision which is woefully inadequate in the part of the country that I represent, I do not understand why the Minister would row back on a decision made to provide a medical card when the net benefit to the Exchequer is positive in terms of improved health outcomes because it keeps people out of secondary and tertiary care facilities. Fianna Fáil backbenchers spoke about hysteria and the media frenzy whipped up over this issue.  The people who marched on Leinster House were not whipped up into a frenzy of hysteria.  At the time they took the rational view that their rights were being undermined.  They were rightfully fearful of the possibility that their entitlements would be taken from them in one fell swoop.  I am glad they decided to organise and exercise their right to protest.  If they had not done so, we would not be here today and the Government would not have rowed back on the position it took on this issue on budget day.  If we are to exercise public health policy correctly, it is clear that the campaign to maintain the automatic right to a medical card will need to have a positive outcome.  We need to continue in that vein.  I do not see how the Minister will be able to garner savings in this instance.  It seems that she intends to reallocate resources from those whose automatic entitlement is being withdrawn to others who might be able to avail of a medical card.  People on lower incomes will not receive a medical card in the current climate because the thresholds have not been increased sufficiently.
2680	SeanSherlock	Labour	13153.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2008-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	451	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 to 223, inclusive, together. Language support teachers are appointed to assist schools in providing  additional English language support for pupils for whom English is a second  language. There are currently 554 Language Support Teachers allocated to post- primary  schools, at a current cost of approximately €35 million per annum. The number  of teaching posts in each second-level sector is broken down as follows: 288 in  voluntary secondary, 88 in community and comprehensive and 178 in VEC schools. The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalents (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools. The budget measures announced recently will mean that the level of language  support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a  maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007. As I announced on budget day we will provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis. At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out the allocation process for 2009/10 in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for individual schools  or list of schools could not be justified and would actually impede this  process. Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the  OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning  that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively  unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high  concentrations of newcomer children. I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching  resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the  inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing  the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises  that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided  to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our  provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the  question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to  ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an  intercultural Ireland. My Department is providing support and training for teachers of English as an  additional language in the current school year. At post primary level, the  Second Level Support Service (SLSS) have identified members of their team to  provide training and support for teachers of English as an additional language.  The training has been designed and will be rolled out in early 2009. The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalent (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools: WTE No of schools Between 0.1-1 310 1-2 100 2-3 41 3-4 24 4-6 14

The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a  Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants. In 1993, the Department issued a circular (M 51/93) to post-primary schools,  advising of a memorandum of agreement between the Department and the  post-primary schools managerial association, that selection for the purposes of  enrolment based on academic ability should be discontinued. Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally  obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that  policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their  children to a school of the parents choice are respected. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.

2691	SeanSherlock	Labour	13159.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy. The  Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over  the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably  extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the  Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the  past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public  finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put  ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future. However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that  they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country. My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme. I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will  impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced  levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary  services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this. The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of funding for the day to day running costs of primary schools which will  see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  The Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit. Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of  absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave. In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent. In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of  the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with  the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the  additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are  met. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

2694	SeanSherlock	Labour	13160.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	582	 I wish to share time with Deputy Penrose.
2695	SeanSherlock	Labour	13160.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	584	" I appreciate that we all had to act in unison last week and take the Minister's statements in good faith as the crisis unfolded.  Across the political divide we acted in the public interest.  A total product recall was the only way to go to restore consumer confidence and export markets in the long run.  This week, however, we are at a different juncture.  The Minister is now asking us to stand over a payment of €50 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  I have serious reservations about it because the Minister has not provided sufficient detail on how that sum will be spent down to the last euro.  I agree that the compensation package must be negotiated but the lack of detail shows a certain disregard for Opposition Members who represent all sides, including consumers, farm workers and processors.  We should be provided with far more detail of this Supplementary Estimate, given that it is taxpayers' money. My understanding is that this €50 million payout will cover interim payments to processors, although that is not stated in the Minister's speech.  Perhaps we can get some clarification on that.  I did not hear anything in the speech to indicate that workers who were left out of pocket through last week's closure of plants will be compensated.  If plants such as Rossderragh are not in a position to compensate workers for loss of pay, which occurred through no fault of their own, there is a strong case for the Government to compensate them.  That is not an unreasonable request in this instance.  I am disappointed, however, that there is no detail of such a scheme in the speech. I did not write a speech in advance of this debate because I wanted to listen to the Minister before responding.  I wanted my remarks to be based on his speech.  Over the past 72 hours, I have read a great deal about Millstream Recycling company in Bunclody.  The Minister stated: ""In regard to the specific investigation into the source of the contamination, my Department is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Garda"".  Why is the Garda involved?  Is it the Department's opinion that an illegal or nefarious process was involved?  If people are being asked to stand over a payout to the industry of between €50 million and €180 million, it is fair that they ask pertinent questions as to why the Garda has become involved. The Minister also stated: ""The investigations focus on the type of fuel used in a burner which dried surplus food material for animal feed and the appropriateness of this type of oil"".  He went on to state: ""In view of the apparent link to the type of fuel used in the drying process, I am asking the European Commission to consider whether the type of oil to be used by feed business operators can be more strictly regulated"".  It appears that the use of this type of fuel is not governed by the Department's rules, the hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation or EU regulations.  Will the Minister clarify this issue and inform the House as to why the Garda is involved?  If the Garda is involved, a nefarious scheme is the presumption.  If there was an illegal process, will there be a source of redress?  Was the Millstream process illegal?  It is the reason for this debate.  The process will cost the State up to €180 million. Ironically, anything that I have read about the factory in question suggested that the process was a forward looking venture well ahead of the posse in terms of new industry initiatives.  This does not sit well and I hope that we are not hanging a particular individual out to dry.  The issue must be addressed transparently.  While we agree that compensatory measures must be put in place, we need to know who negotiated the package on behalf of the pig industry.  We also need to know when the funding will be divvied up and, in light of the public interest, whether the details of who gets what will become available.  If the taxpayers are to cover the cost, it is only fair that they know what is at stake and in play. There has been a failure of regulation, but I do not attribute it to the Government necessarily.  By way of constructive criticism, I suggest that we have a single figurehead — a supremo, if the House wills — to be in charge of food regulation.  I am not discussing the creation of a new agency or quango.  However, the statements issued by the Department, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the European Food Safety Authority could give rise to a certain degree of confusion as to where competencies lie in food safety.  It took some 24 hours to realise that competence lay with the FSAI.  Rather than a merger of competencies, I propose there be one voice within the regulatory framework so that when the members of the Fourth Estate and the Legislature need questions answered, we will know to whom we should go.

2697	SeanSherlock	Labour	13160.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	589	 Will the Minister of State respond to our questions?

2699	SeanSherlock	Labour	13160.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	851	 There is a local authority housing development in Mitchelstown, north County Cork.  The houses are some of the finest I have ever seen and there is a mixture of social and affordable housing.  However, many of the affordable houses are empty because they cannot be sold.  The empty houses have given rise to anti-social behaviour, as a consequence of which they have been vandalised.  The estate is wonderful and the residents are very proud of where they live.  They have organised residents' associations.  However, they are very concerned that some of the empty affordable houses will not be sold, as they have been on the market for almost two years.  I have a list as long as one's arm of people in the Mitchelstown area who would gladly take one of these houses if they were transferred to social housing status. Officials in the northern division of Cork County Council told me that because of certain funding and resource stipulations put in place during the preparation of the affordable housing scheme, the status of these houses cannot be changed from affordable to social housing.  I am certain that is not the only such estate in the country.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should allow some flexibility.  In cases where the social housing waiting list is of a certain size, it could show some degree of flexibility to ensure such houses are occupied.  In this way the problems of anti-social behaviour can be offset.  We need a common-sense approach to the use of empty houses under the auspices of local authorities. I refer to the tenant purchase scheme.  I have encountered many people who have paid rent to local authorities and invested thousands of euro in their house during the years.  As a result of restrictions on the tenant purchase scheme, they are prevented from purchasing their house.  If there was greater flexibility and the discounting system was more extensive, many older local authority residents who have invested much money in their house and made it their own could purchase it.  It would realise a certain amount for the State and allow it, in turn, to embark on a further housing programme.  I realise that my colleague, Deputy Lynch, has done a lot of work in this area, which I acknowledge.  The State must find imaginative solutions to this problem and should examine the possibility of introducing such schemes.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Cuffe, stated in his contribution to the debate that some progress had been made.  However, a good deal more could be made and many imaginative solutions implemented.  We may propose such solutions through motions and the work of Deputy Lynch who is the Labour Party spokesperson on the issue.  Such solutions must be taken on board.  We seek to work positively to address the issue. Many rural dwellers do not wish to be shepherded into large urban areas to be facilitated in social housing.  The State must make provision for such persons and allow them, if eligible for social housing, to be housed within their communities.  The vibrancy of any community depends on a housing mix in which that demographic is also catered for.
2700	SeanSherlock	Labour	13160.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	948	 In raising this matter, I am seeking to highlight the fact that, in the view of the 100 plus GPs who refer people to it, Mallow General Hospital is a centre of excellence.  It is also a secondary care facility that caters for the needs of a population base of well over 100,000.  If the national service plan, as envisaged, is implemented, the accident and emergency department at Mallow General Hospital will be downgraded to a minor injuries unit.  The GPs from whom I have received representations and the people who live in the area want to know what will be the future of the accident and emergency department.  There is a concern that if it is downgraded to the status of a minor injuries unit, many GPs in the area will bypass Mallow General Hospital and refer people instead to Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Given an expected population base of 4.53 million in 2009, it is vital hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital maintain some coherence in terms of accident and emergency services.  Reducing or diminishing it to a minor injuries clinic will result in more people being put into the narrow funnel that is Cork University Hospital, which is not the way to go. I have taken advice on the matter from general practitioners who refer stroke patients and people with heart complaints to this hospital.  Many of these interventions can be dealt with by the accident and emergency department.  Downgrading the hospital to a minor injuries unit will have an adverse effect on outcomes for patients.

2710	SeanSherlock	Labour	13209.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	 The reason I ask for a debate is that it is important to examine the allocations made by the NRA in relative terms and in the context of Exchequer expenditure on roads, particularly in County Cork.

2713	SeanSherlock	Labour	13209.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	656	 I wish to record my utter disgust, as well as that of the staff and patients of the Heatherside Hospital in north Cork, at the HSE's unilateral decision to close the facility which has housed 42 patients for many years.  The decision is illogical and without any common sense basis.  It was taken without any consultation with the stakeholders, the nursing staff or the patients.  This is a facility that has looked after patients with mental health issues for several years.  What is happening in society is disgusting.  These 42 patients will be moved into a facility that was already closed down, unfit for human habitation and with Dickensian conditions. I do not know what the Government or the HSE is at, particularly when they give us much rhetoric on how well they look after mentally ill patients.  I am calling on them to put a stay of execution on this decision until such time as there is consultation with the patients' representatives, the families and the community to ensure everyone's rights and entitlements are vindicated.  If we have any sense of decency, this issue will be re-examined.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to intervene directly with the HSE to ensure the rights and entitlements of the affected patients are protected and common decency prevails.

2723	SeanSherlock	Labour	13210.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	309	 In light of the Taoiseach's announcement on Tuesday, I wish to refer to the Financial Regulator's proposal to examine a specific code on mortgages.  Can the Minister provide a clearer picture as to what that entails?  The vast bulk of expenditure by those in the private and public sectors is on mortgages.  When will the Government introduce some scheme to grant relief to mortgage holders who lose their jobs?  While the current rate of home repossessions is quite low, it can be reasonably assumed that the rate will increase seriously in the next few years.  I would like to get some response from the Minister in that regard. The Taoiseach's statement also referred to tax credits available to companies and exemptions on capital gains tax.  If the exemptions were significantly increased beyond €40,000 it would give a further incentive for people to come into that sector.  The back-to-education allowance should be amended to allow people who are going to become unemployed to avail of educational training, including how to start up their own companies, without losing their entitlements.  We need to be a bit more imaginative.  If we are going to create tax exemptions based on production in the smart economy, one must create incentives for people to get into that sector in the first instance.
2724	SeanSherlock	Labour	13210.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	326	 I asked about tax exemptions, but got no reply.

2729	SeanSherlock	Labour	13215.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	240	 Will the Minister tell us whether it is envisaged that the Health Act 1970, which guaranteed the right to a bed, will be revoked and whether that right will be enshrined in the new legislation?  If that right is not to be revoked and in the event of somebody deciding not to sign up to and be a willing stakeholder in this scheme but it is decided medically that the person requires a bed, will he or she have an automatic right to a bed in a public or private facility? On the resourcing of the scheme, if somebody goes into a private facility, will the charges accruing for the provision of that bed be capped by the State?  Will the State legislate for or regulate the charges of nursing homes for the provision of that bed?  I can envisage a situation where the private sphere, because of the economies of scale in that sector and the dramatic reduction in the provision of public beds for elderly people, will see an opportunity, when the budget is outlined each year in the annual Estimates passed by this House, to get together, pool their resources and calculate what the charging regime could be for a bed.  That will present untold problems for many families.  Can the Minister comment specifically on this issue? If a person has a property and a son or daughter has been bequeathed that property or if a son or daughter who is not married has been given that property legally and if there is a legal arrangement whereby the person has an automatic right to residence in the home, what is the legal provision in the event of that person going into a nursing home?  The regime at present is such that even though the son or daughter is residing within the family home and there is a legal arrangement to that effect, there is still a calculation of 15% rental income in arriving at the nursing home subvention.  That is unfair.  I consider it so unfair that I have referred the specific case to the Ombudsman, as an independent source, to ascertain her determination on such a provision.  What will the legal provision be in the new arrangement, after the legislation is passed? We are shoring up many problems but in seeking to deal with one set of problems the House and the Government will create a new set.  I still cannot get my head around the proposals in the legislation regarding ancillary State support.  I refer Members to the Citizens Information Board which produced a paper in December 2008 that referred specifically to ancillary State support in the context of this Bill.  The paper says the Bill distinguishes between State support and ancillary State support.  We are aware of the provisions relating to State support but, according to the paper one must apply separately for ancillary State support; one can apply even if one does not qualify for State support; ancillary State support can be based on relevant assets only, not cash assets; and there must be a property over which a charge can be taken. If somebody applies for ancillary State support, a charge is levelled against the property.  What is the repayment schedule on that?  If I need to go to a nursing home tomorrow, for example, and I apply for ancillary State support, what agency will pay the money to the nursing home in terms of the support that is given?  Will it be the HSE or another such agency as determined by the Minister for Health and Children?  If this will be a resource-based scheme and if we are now living in times of economic turmoil, I can see a situation where there will be hundreds of people queuing up for nursing home beds who will not be able to get one as they will not be able to benefit from the ancillary State support because there will not be such funding.  How that will work its way out through the system needs to be teased out. We are reaching a stage in this country where the community beds that once provided wonderful nursing home care are being whittled away by a process of stealth.  We are moving so far into the private sector that by the time it comes for me to be cared for in a nursing home, the costs accruing will be so astronomical it will place such a burden on the State as to be untenable.  At this stage of the process I would put forward a theory that there needs to be a greater degree of analysis about how we can provide beds within the public sector.  For example, there is a 42-bed facility in north Cork which is about to be closed.  It is neither a geriatric nor a psychiatric unit; it has no designation.  It is a wonderful facility in a wonderful setting.  If, instead of being closed, it received the right amount of investment, it could provide a wonderful facility for the provision of care for the elderly within its catchment area as a community facility.  Those same people would happily pay their pension or a proportion of the cost of getting their bed within that facility and they would gladly welcome whatever subvention or State support that would arise. However, there is no foresight and no planning.  I see nothing in this legislation that would give me any grounds for hope — I must be honest about it — that the Minister will ensure we will move seamlessly from the current regime into a new regime and that this will be a panacea for the elderly.  I can see a situation where the number of people, family members of persons who are in nursing homes, who come to my clinics will increase as a result of this ill thought-out legislation. I heard the Taoiseach describe himself here as an egalitarian republican.  If we are speaking of egalitarianism, older people should be able to come to their autumn or winter years with a certain peace of mind knowing that they or their families will not be left with an undue financial burden when it comes to caring for them.  I cannot see anything in this legislation that will give solace to those people. I reiterate the point that if we are to have a proper system in this country, it must be with the proviso that the cost of care in nursing homes must be capped.  Deputy O'Dowd made the point earlier.  There is the bare cost of provision for the bed for the week but there are also the extra costs that now seem to be accruing, which are not accounted for.  I refer to chiropody, hairdressing and other such services which seem to be added on week in, week out. I am not against the private sector because I visit nursing homes on a regular basis and I see the good work that is being done there, but there must be a good mix.  This comes back to the point I made about the 1970 Act.  I am asking that the 1970 Act not be rescinded and that everybody would have a right to a bed, whether in the public or private sector.

The information requested by the Deputy will be forwarded to him directly, when the schools concerned have been notified.
2731	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	531	 The Minister neglected to mention that before the Common Position was reached, it was proposed to reduce the quantities of pesticides supplied or used by 50%.  That proposal did not take into account the national plant health requirement to have certain substances available.  Similarly, it did not take into consideration the properties of the substances concerned.  Will a list of the specific pesticides that are to be prohibited as a result of the directive, or the Common Position that has been reached, be provided?  The Minister mentioned that people will have to be trained to use pesticides.  Will such training comprise another layer of bureaucracy to be dealt with by landowners and farmers before they can set about their daily business of growing crops?  What is the Irish position on this directive?  I accept that the directive is specifically aimed at protecting human and animal health, which is laudable.  We need to find out, within the remit of Question Time, what impact the directive will have on farmers and landowners.  Will a list of pesticides be prescribed?
2732	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	533	" When Ministers speak about EU legislation, they have a tendency to use words like ""lacuna"".  The Minister's response was somewhat confusing.  I will try to interpret it as best I can when I read the Official Report.  If there is a Common Position and a framework for Community action, there will be a prescribed set of pesticide uses or functions.  Will there be a defined list?  Will pesticide users be required to undertake training?  Does the Minister envisage that this will be implemented within a certain timeframe?  The Minister has said that Ireland had an alliance with Britain and Hungary on this issue, but what position did the three countries take?  Did Ireland abstain when the vote was taken on the final Common Position?  Did Ireland vote against it?"
2733	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	551	 I understand the target set by the EU Commission for the production of biofuels is 10% by 2020.  The European Parliament and its environment committee, which consists of members from across the political divide, voted to scale down the proposed EU-wide target of 10% by 2020 to 4% by 2015.  Notwithstanding the 1,800 hectares of miscanthus planted, to which the Minister of State referred, we have moved from the planting of 137 hectares of energy crops in 2003 to just more than 9,000 hectares in 2007, which represents approximately 0.02% of all agricultural land.  Teagasc has estimated that potentially 75,000 to 100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on food production. Are the targets that have been set realistic?  Is the Government doing enough to encourage farmers to get into the business of growing crops for fuel?  How will the food versus fuel debate impact on Ireland?  What is the Government doing to encourage more farmers to diversify into such production?  Is there a ready market available for fuel crops?
2734	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	553	 I put it to the Minister that it is hardly a bureaucratic target, it is a political target that was reached partly with the agreement of the green movement throughout the European Union.  I do not mean to be facetious when I say that.
2735	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	555	 We are currently at a point where fuel prices have decreased due to the fall in oil prices.   The Government has a tendency to take its foot off the pedal with regard to developing a coherent and long-term policy.  Post CAP reform, there will be an abyss into which many Irish farmers will fall.  There will be significant loss of revenue.  This is one way in which the slack can be taken up.  I put it to the Minister that the Government must come back to the House with a defined Government policy on how farmers can look to the future with regard to alternative energy production and the creation of markets.
2736	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	 The question is whether there will be a loss of money to farmers.  The point of modulation, as the Minister has stated, is to contribute towards environmental measures such as water conservation.  Will the moneys involved be controlled by the Department?  Will they be paid directly to farmers, or will they be paid to other agencies as determined by the Department to administer those schemes?  The point is whether farmers will lose money through the measures that are supposed to be incorporated within modulation.
2737	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	640	 To what extent does the Minister believe that the commodification of dairy products and the fact that they are tradeable commodities has an effect on the markets and on the price of milk for Irish farmers?  This should be taken into account.  Are there discussions at EU level or within the WTO framework to tackle the fact that commodification is causing great vagaries in prices?  That is having an impact on the market here.
2738	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	661	 I anticipate that the Minister of State will spend some time in the air to visit some of the events.  I welcome the fact that there is a significant budget for Bord Bia.  It is money well spent when one thinks of the return.  The €8 billion to €9 billion in food exports will be one of the saviours if this economy is to lift itself out of recession.  The emphasis on food production will be vital in that sense. Has there been a full restoration of the markets in light of the pork dioxin scare?  I refer to the markets prior to 6 December.  As I understand it, we have lost some market share to the UK because of the sterling differential, which is a major factor.  I welcome the Minister of State's answer but we need to step up our efforts in terms of the potential of continental Europe given that we have 33% of exports there currently.  There is a greater potential in continental Europe.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to come back with a reply on that one given the timeframe — it is just by way of a general comment.
2739	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	 We wish to support the motion on the basis that the permutations of the HSE Teamwork-Howarth report for the delivery of care for people in the mid-west will have untold consequences for those who do not live in the region served by Limerick Regional Hospital.  In addressing this motion I wish to speak specifically for the southern region, where the national service plan has been published.  We have also recently received a document from the HSE stating that new efficiencies to the value of €80 million are sought in its operations.  The Teamwork-Howarth report has not been published in the south.  Having read the Fine Gael motion and the prescriptions of the Teamwork-Howarth report for the mid-west, I do not doubt that the delivery of services in the combined Munster region, as espoused in this document, will have a negative effect on hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and Mallow.  While I might be accused of being parochial, it is important to note that the hospital in Mallow is like those in Ennis and Mallow, and to address this as a Munster-wide issue. There has been no politically accountable, coherent analysis of the HSE's proposals.  This is the first time that the House has had an opportunity to properly debate their implications and it is happening on Opposition time.  The Government should make time available to debate the issues adequately so that we can go through the implications of these proposals euro by euro, and hospital by hospital. We have witnessed the erosion by stealth of services at the former county hospital in Mallow.  A CT scanner was put in place a few years ago and became operational last year for approximately ten to 15 hours per week, but now runs for between four and six hours per week.  Last week, we found out that the ear, nose and throat services will be taken away in one fell swoop.  We have also been notified that no children under the age of 16 will be treated within the hospital and that the long-term plan is to replace the accident and emergency unit with a nurse-led minor injuries clinic. The motion notes that between 15 and 30 people are regularly on trolleys for over 24 hours in Limerick Regional Hospital.  If services in Mallow are further reduced the same will apply to Cork University Hospital.  We in the Munster region are arguing for a re-think of the policy.  Clinicians who advise me, and the 120 GPs who serve the hospital, say that there should be no diminution in services in Mallow general hospital until the HSE can guarantee that the services are available in Cork University Hospital.  That is the logic of the argument being applied to Limerick Regional Hospital and to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  There is a complete lack of foresight in the approach to this.  Every time I raise the issue with the upper echelons of the HSE management in the southern region, I meet vague answers and lack of specifics. I do not see how the Minister can dress up the service plan for the southern region as a configuration, or a reconfiguration, because it drives a coach and four through the services being delivered to the catchment areas of Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh.  Those who reside in the catchment areas will have to travel further to get into Cork University Hospital and Limerick Regional which will force more people through a narrow bottleneck.  The services and capacity do not exist within those hospitals.  There is no logic in seeking to further downgrade the satellite hospitals that serve Cork University and Limerick Regional Hospitals.  We want a proper debate on this and I ask that the Government make time available for it.  I appreciate that Fine Gael raised this issue and we support it. How much time do I have left?
2740	SeanSherlock	Labour	13216.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1086	 Why are Fianna Fáil Deputies elected by these constituencies allowing this to happen?  Why do those Deputies constantly move to blame it on the HSE?  Are we to believe that Professor Drumm, by virtue of his management of the HSE, is the de facto Minister for Health and Children?  Is there no voice on the Government backbenches from the Munster region served by the hospitals at Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh that will call a halt to what the HSE is trying to do?  If we proceed with the degradation of services at these hospitals there is no way that hospitals such as Cork University and Limerick Regional will be able to deal with the capacity.  That will have untold consequences. The hospital in Mallow serves over 100,000 people in four counties.  I speak to the staff in Cork University hospital and if one visits it on any given day, one will see that the accident and emergency unit cannot cope with the numbers coming through.  Why would the Government seek to further diminish services to the satellite hospitals? We support the motion and believe that if the Government backbenchers who represent constituencies served by the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and Mallow have any backbone they will support such motions because in that way they will support the people.

The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.

However, it was decided to prioritise the placement of the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible. The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over €100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country, thereby reducing the demand for prefabs. It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame.

2754	SeanSherlock	Labour	13222.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	323	 I was raised with the notion that the taxation system should be progressive, based on equity and one's ability to pay.  This is not a pension levy; it is a levy on income.  It is completely and utterly contrary to any canons of taxation and to the republican — I use that in the widest sense of the word — ideals to which we subscribe in this great little liberal democracy of ours.  I wish to reflect the anger of one person in north Cork who wrote to me and whose voice is reflective of thousands of others.  I wish to read into the record an e-mail I received from him.  It states: I am appalled at the proposed levy of 7.5% being imposed on me by the Government.  I am a committed public servant who works hours far in excess of those required by my work contract, for nothing.  In December 2008 alone I worked forty hours overtime for which I neither claimed nor was given payment.  During my twenty-three years of public service I have worked about ten hours a week overtime without pay, on many occasions I have worked far more than that.  Last year my conditions of employment were varied and I was obliged to pay Eighty Euros additional tax per week.  I did so without complaint.  This year in January an employment levy was imposed on me that took an additional Twelve Euros plus per week.  Now in February 2009 I am being told to pay an additional Ninety Euros pension levy for which I will receive no benefit whatsoever!  My deduction prior to the imposition of any of these additional taxes were as follows: PRSI [approximately] 3.25%, Superannuation plus Widows and Orphans 6.5%, Notional service 7.28% totalling 17.03% plus VHI of [approximately] fifty Euros as my PRSI contributions entitle me to nothing while my wife and I are both alive.  I recently put two members of my family through third level college and received no grants whatsoever.  My weekly deductions after this levy is applied will total approximately four hundred and sixty Euro per week.  I have always felt that it was my duty as an Irish citizen to give a contribution above and beyond that called for by my work contract.  I have done so willingly and have even enjoyed doing so.  I paid my taxes and did so without complaint.  I felt that I was doing what every loyal Irishman or Irishwoman should do and that every other working Irishman or Irish woman was doing the same.  Now, however, I feel that I am being singled out as a soft target because of my position as a public servant and that my contribution to Irish society and the country has been demeaned.  I would not object as vehemently if the load were spread out evenly among all contributors.  However, if and when we get back on our feet in this country, I will still be paying this levy, whereas if it were income tax I would be treated in exactly the same way as other taxpayers and when taxes were reduced all round again I would also benefit.  [This] is not to be the case, however, and I will remain a victim of this unjust imposition for the rest of my working life.  You will understand why I feel that my commitment and dedication are not appreciated, why I feel that I am being singled out as a scapegoat for the economic collapse and why I will not feel in the future that I should go that extra mile, as I and many others do every week of every year without acknowledgement or expectation of it.  This is taxation without consultation, a punitive measure directed at a section of Irish society that has contributed to Irish economic growth without receiving a commensurate reward. The Government must seriously rethink its strategy on what I call this income levy.  We are all willing to share the burden but if we are to spread the burden, it must be done on the basis of equity and fairness.

The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a  recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board's network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is the key means by which the Board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child  attends and benefits from education.  EWOs deal with approximately 10,000  cases, involving children with reported school attendance difficulties, per  annum.  Officers work closely with the family, the school and other support  services to address the particular issues for each child. In line with Government policy the Board prioritises its resources to support  the most disadvantaged areas and schools participating in DEIS (Delivering  Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for educational inclusion.   EWOs provide an intensive service in these areas.  Outside of these areas,  priority is given to children who are out of school or who have significant  difficulties with school attendance. The National Educational Welfare Board's Analysis of School Attendance Data in  Primary and Post-Primary Schools, 2003/04 to 2005/06, shows that the response  rate from schools is improving.  In primary schools, the response rate rose  from 81% (in 2004/05) to 95% (in 2005/06) and in post primary schools from 76%  (in 2004/05) to 88% (in 2005/06). I am advised by the Board that 270 schools failed to make Annual Attendance  Returns for 2005/06 and this fell to just over 170 schools for the 2006/07  returns.  Data in relation to the 2007/08 school year is being finalised. The Board have informed the Department that it continues to work with schools  and provides guidelines for schools in meeting their obligations in relation to  reporting. The Board developed an online reporting system www.schoolreturn.ie  in consultation with schools to simplify the process of reporting of  non-attendance and submitting the annual attendance report as required under  the Act. The continued increase in the number of schools making returns since the  establishment of the Board is very encouraging and indicates the importance  placed by schools on providing data to the Board.

In the case of schools that have over-quota teachers, vacancies do not arise as a result of teachers approved for job-sharing or career break. This position is no different from that pertaining in previous years. In these schools that have over-quota teachers, applications for job-sharing and a career break may be considered by the authorities of the schools concerned in the normal way. Because the school is over its allocation of teachers my department will not give automatic replacements. It is, of course, open to the school authority to apply to my Department for additional teaching hours by way of curricular concessions to cover part or all of the hours in respect of an approved job-sharer/career break teacher. Each such application is considered on its merits.

2768	SeanSherlock	Labour	13236.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	511	" I propose to take ten minutes. The Bill is being presented to us against a backdrop of an announcement today that AIB is to write off €1.8 billion in bad loans for 2008.  The Minister is asking the House to support a Bill that will recapitalise that same bank to the tune of €3.5 billion.  That is laudable but only if it results in provision of credit lines to businesses and borrowers in general. The Labour Party must critically assess the proposals brought before us in the Bill.  As I understand it, €4 billion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund's current resources will be used as part of that recapitalisation, out of the total of €7 billion.  Bearing in mind that the global markets are not touching Irish stocks currently, I wonder whether that is a wise move and whether the methodology the Minister proposes in the Bill is not without its flaws. We are told by the Minister that he has consulted widely with financial and property experts in drafting this Bill.  I would like to know who were those financial and property experts.  I become a little afraid when I hear of Ministers taking the advice of property experts given the culture we have been used to in recent years.  I would like to know the nature of that advice and whether there was an alternative advice to that on which he has based his Bill. For example, what was the alternative advice, if any, on devolving more power to the Minister with regard to directing the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission ""to make investments in such institutions and to underwrite their share issues""?  Such a concentration of power must be questioned and the Minister must tell us whether there is scope for this power to be abused.  It is a theoretical question but in terms of the enactment of a law it is worthy of answer by the Minister in his reply. For instance, if the Minister determines, for political expediency, that an investment should be made in a specific financial institution, and if the NPRF determines that this is contrary to any responsible investment policy, it is powerless to act against such a move.  My understanding is that the responsible investment policy is one of the key components underpinning the governance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Furthermore, investing such powers in the Minister bypasses this House and any scrutiny we may wish to pursue in this regard.  I would like the Minister to address that point when replying to the debate. In his contribution the Minister told us that the State will get a direct return for its investment.  In the current climate, and in the context of AIB's write-down of €1.8 billion today, it is difficult to envisage any return to the taxpayer any time soon.  I understand that if we take the long-term view an alternative view could be argued but the fundamental principle underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund is the responsible investment policy.  That is a stated policy that gives rise to the need to meet the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the years 2025 to 2055. On the face of it, the Bill should, ceteris paribus, yield a return to the Exchequer over a long-term period if a number of assumptions are taken.  If we assume there is no restructuring of the banking regime in this country within that period of time, that is, that no banks will merge or there will be no rationalisation or consolidation of banking, then it is reasonable to assume that the taxpayer will see a return on his or her investment but I question the Minister’s strategy in that regard.  That we invest with the possibility of a return is fair enough but the manner in which the Minister has pitched the proposed return on the investment speaks to me of an ill-thought out strategy that allows the banks to dictate the terms by which they will be recapitalised and not the people, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, whose moneys will be used for this purpose. The Minister proposes to get a preference share with a fixed dividend of 8% or ordinary shares in lieu.  I would like the Minister to explain the reason he is proposing to take preference shares in the first instance instead of ordinary shares.  If the Minister is buying preference shares with a fixed dividend at today's prices, what will be the total yield to the National Pensions Reserve Fund if those shares are bought back by the bank within the five year period?  I understand they have a provision to do so or they are allowed to do so.  It seems to me that the Minister has allowed the banks a provision to buy back shares within the five year period at today's prices. I question the validity of such a strategy and wonder if it would have been more expedient for the taxpayers' money, through the NPRF, to be used to buy ordinary shares.  That would have been a more responsible strategy.  If the two banks report losses within the next five years, what will be the status of the 8% yield on those preferences?  Also, what will happen to the yield?  If there is a return of 8%, where will that yield be invested?  Will it be awarded to the NPRF? I would also like to know what the Minister means, in layman's terms, when he states that he will allow the commission to set up a special purpose investment vehicle.  Notwithstanding that I have a degree in economics, I admit with a degree of humility that I do not have a clue what a special purpose investment vehicle is.  When we are writing legislation in this House, and if we are using taxpayers' money to underpin a strategy of recapitalisation, we must have it set out to us in clear terms what exactly that means.  If the Minister is to be given devolved powers and if we are setting up special purpose investment vehicles, we must know for exactly what purpose they are designed and, if there is a return on such a vehicle, the nature of that return and how those investments will be pitched.  Will they be for philanthropic purposes?  Will they be a sop to our learned friends in the Green Party?  Will there be a sustainable element to those vehicles?  What will be the nature of those vehicles?  The people are entitled to know that and it must be set out clearly in any legislation that is brought before the House. I wish to address some points made by Deputy Gogarty.  I do not mean to be personal in my response to his contribution earlier but I wish to state for the record that I have never taken a bribe or a red cent from any corporate entity, except through a fund-raising race event I held whereby local companies bought in to a race night I ran when I was raising funds to try to get elected to this House.  There is a desire by Deputy Gogarty to impugn certain Members of this House and develop a language that states that we are not credible to critically analyse any measure that comes forth from this Government in respect of any tract of legislation because somehow our respective parties in opposition are dirtied by the fact that they may have taken corporate donations.  I wish to state for the record that I have never taken corporate donations in that sense of the word."

2771	SeanSherlock	Labour	13237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	823	 The financial crisis is due to both external and internal factors, external in that the beliefs we held regarding the behaviour of banks and financial markets as actors in a real economic setting have been challenged like never before.  It must be said that somewhere in the recesses of our minds there was a nebulous idea that the global financial economic structure was based on a false premise but we never realised just how much the Irish banking sector was tied to that false premise.  We are now left with a new rhetoric from the centre left and centre right about the role of the State.  The question for all of us is how to construct a new narrative for the position we are in and a solution for the next generation. This country was over-reliant on tax receipts from stamp duty.  That issue will be analysed until kingdom come and there is nothing that I can bring to that analysis that is new.  The question now is how we get ourselves out of this morass and restore our economic well-being, and what we can do to ensure a sustainable economic and social model into the future. The restoration of the economy must be based on strong Government intervention and co-decision making with our European Union partners.  The Stability and Growth Pact has vanished and the question remains as to what will replace it.  This country is nowhere near a fiscal stimulus plan and all talk of change, President Obama style, is futile.  What we need now is a new definition of the role of markets and the role of the State regarding market behaviour. I am encouraged by the fact that the European Commission published proposals last week that would set up a pan-European regulatory body with strong powers to intervene in national regulation.  Unfortunately, that is a necessary consequence of Ireland's soft attitude in regulating the behaviour of financial institutions.  We await the political outcome of such proposals and I hope the Government will support that initiative.  It is necessary if it is to send a message to global markets that Ireland is getting its house in order.  If the Government is to restore public finances it must also restore confidence.  The restoration of confidence will ensure that investors will once again begin to look at Ireland. Given that we are an open economy, it is vital that our membership of the European Union is seen in a positive light.  I am encouraged by the fact that the EU monetary affairs Commissioner has stated publicly that any country in crisis will receive financial assistance in advance of the International Monetary Fund knocking on our door.  We must be encouraged by those signals.  In terms of the motion before us, we must acknowledge that any Government strategy has to incorporate our European Union partners.  Without them, we are doomed. In putting forward these ideas I am conscious that a new language must emerge, which is one of social solidarity.  This Government has sought to pitch sectional interests against each other.  We need a new language that does not put the private sector against the public sector or the urbanite against the rural dweller.  Any interventions made by Government must be based on equity and on the basis that each bears the pain in accordance with their ability to pay. We all have ideas.  Our membership of this House is based on the notion that we put forward ideas to get elected here.  I suggest we examine the notion of social capital.  Amidst this economic storm there are practical solutions that would put thousands to work if the Government thought more laterally about its policy interventions. Many communities are in need of serious investment in terms of public works that could be carried out at an extra marginal cost but that would yield a massive return in terms of adding to the quality of this country's citizens' lives.  We need a proactive Government intervention at the most basic and community level to ensure our communities can survive. In that light and in light of the fact that in the past six months my colleagues within the Labour Party have put forward some concrete proposals, we wish to work in a positive sense to try to do what we can to get this country up and running again.  Today I spoke with my colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who put forward proposals on the inclusion of certain persons within the tax net.  In the past two weeks or so, we have heard many social commentators speak about the fact that 38% of the population is currently outside the tax net.  If we are talking about a mini-budget in the coming months and if we are talking about changing the tax code or increasing personal taxation, we must take cognisance of the fact that there are large numbers within that 38% bracket who are pensioners and low paid.  If the Government proposes to bring more people into the tax net, it must be on the basis of equity and not on the basis of making sure that those people on marginal or lower incomes are not taxed unfairly.

This school building is planned to come on stream in 2009 and will operate under the patronage of  County Dublin VEC.  Based on current demographic trends, my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils. My Department has been in contact with South Dublin County Council regarding a potential site for future educational provision in the area, and has arranged a technical inspection of the various site options identified by South Dublin County Council.  These options are currently being considered and the Department will be in further contact with South Dublin County Council in the coming weeks regarding the matter.

I will start with a simple question — will the Minister close Mallow General Hospital?  I want a clear ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer from her.  If it is the Minister's intention to keep the hospital open, people want to know the extent of its services in future.  We have been met with nothing but confusion and obfuscation concerning the provision of services in the HSE south region in recent months.  We have had the national service plan 2009, the reconfiguration of hospitals report for the HSE south region, which was also published this year, and we have also had the teamwork report and the Howarth report.  Now we are being told that Professor John Higgins will examine proposals on savings that will be garnered as a result of the cuts to be implemented. The people of the HSE south region want to know what will happen by way of facts, figures and timelines.  We are sick of this culture that exists whereby the only person who will answer publicly for HSE decisions is Professor Drumm.  We want to know why people in the hospital networks office of the HSE south region, and other such high-ranking figures, are not speaking publicly and answering in proper, public fora for the decisions they are taking. There is a positive alternative to the scenario that is currently provided by the HSE south region.  The Minister must listen to GPs who are referring to hospitals like Mallow and Cork University Hospital.  She must listen to people working at the coalface.  If we listened more to doctors and other health professionals and less to the coterie of managerial mandarins, we would be able to effect a proper system that could guarantee health services to the public. With respect to the Minister, I want to know today if she intends to close Mallow General Hospital.  On behalf of that region's taxpayers, I also want to know what future scenario she envisages for the hospital.  We can rotate far more disciplines from Cork University Hospital through to Mallow General Hospital.  In addition, we can enhance the services at Mallow and add value to them.  That case is also being made by health professionals who are operating in that catchment area.  We need proper answers without obfuscation."

I would like a clear ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer.  I understand the Minister replied by stating it would be subject to revised service plans.  In the event that the subject plan does not adhere to standards laid down by the Department, what does she envisage for the future of the hospital?  We need clarity on this once and for all."

The management sought an increased grant toward the provision of additional accommodation over and above that approved. The school were advised that in the context of the funding available and the number of applications for that funding, their application was not successful.  An appeal from the school management is under consideration and a decision will  be conveyed in due course. I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009. The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September. My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed. The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.

2777	SeanSherlock	Labour	13244.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	427	 I wish to provide an example of one of the ways in which we might assist people who have recently become unemployed.  I refer to the provision of State-backed loans to allow people to return to postgraduate education.  A number of months ago I was contacted by a friend of mine who resides in the west.  The man in question graduated from UCG in the mid-1990s and has since worked as a design engineer for a blue chip company.  He is highly qualified but he was made redundant because the American company for which he was working filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.  After 12 years, my friend was offered a statutory redundancy package.  He now proposes to embark on an MBA programme but in order to do so he will be obliged to put up €16,000 from his own savings.  When one considers that he is getting married later in the year, there is no doubt this is quite an amount of money. He approached his local county council, the local enterprise board and FÁS but he was turned down by each for funding to assist him to retrain and up-skill so that when things get better he could return to the jobs market.  If that person was provided with a loan from the State, specifically for postgraduate studies, he told me he would be more than willing to draw it down if he could repay it as soon as he re-enters the workforce.  He would be willing to pay an administrative fee and even a low rate of interest on the loan.  I see the logic of his suggestion.  If we can fund the banks to the tune of €7 billion, I do not understand why we cannot direct those banks to provide lending for people in such circumstances.  They cannot pay exorbitant postgraduate fees at present because every cent they have must go on keeping life and limb together.  The money they have is real income that will be used, in this person's case, for survival and to keep food on the table. There must be lateral thinking about where we are going.  The old paradigms relating to how we allocated resources and money have gone out the window.  There is an opportunity now to come up with radical proposals.  Let us not be afraid to embrace radical proposals on how to get back on our feet.  If the person I mentioned was given that assistance, he would not squander it.  Everything he has done has been achieved through hard work.  That is, generally, the nature of the Irish psyche.  Nobody wants anything for free and if they can get some form of assistance, they are willing to pay for it if it is given in an equitable fashion. The Governor of the Central Bank addressed the economic regulatory affairs committee yesterday.  He said the country's competitiveness has been on the wane for some time.  If this Government intends to put forward a budget shortly, it must examine the issue of competitiveness and the cost of employing people in the current environment.  Employers' PRSI must be changed in some way to make it easier for employers to retain employees.  The Government must deal with this in its deliberations on the budget.

2779	SeanSherlock	Labour	13257.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	 Given that what the Minister has outlined represents a short-term response, will he indicate whether a long-term response has been discussed?  I ask this question in the context of the announcement by Dairygold, one of the main processors in Munster, that it has had to reduce milk prices by 17.4 cent per litre in the last 12 months.  The price is currently bottoming out at some 20 cent per litre.  The intervention mechanisms to which the Minister referred, such as aid to private storage and export funds, will have a short-term effect in terms of improving price.  Has there been any political discussion on the overall quota regime?
2780	SeanSherlock	Labour	13257.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	 Why has the Minister entirely ruled out revisiting the health check?  As he said, we are under quota.  In the current global economic environment, the demand for dairy-based products is reducing significantly over time.  Has there been any political analysis of how that will pan out?  Given our emphasis on milk-based production, there will be serious implications for the agriculture sector if there is no improvement in global demand.  There will be little choice but to revisit the health check because it will have serious implications for how we produce dairy-based products into the future.  I do not see how such a review can be ruled out emphatically without some degree of debate and analysis of where we are going.

That was the basis of my decision to table this question.  Over 32,000 beef farmers have participated in the Teagasc training sessions that are required under the scheme.  It is vitally important that the scheme be maintained in the first instance.  The answer given by the Minister will not reassure the House.  Will the scheme be maintained?  If so, farmers are entitled to know the level at which it will be maintained.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a statement on the budgetary position ahead of 7 April next.  However, farmers are entitled to know whether the scheme will be maintained.

This is the second time in a short period that the Minister has clarified the situation in respect of Mallow General Hospital.  When will the Teamwork report be published?  The reconfiguration document was published on 15 January and laid before the regional health forum.  The document stated that the only services rotated through Mallow General Hospital would be outpatient and obstetrics and gynaecology services and no other services were envisaged.  ENT services are now being cut, which does not tally with the Minister's statement.  Will the Minister further clarify what day procedure services she envisages would rotate through Mallow General Hospital in future?

2793	SeanSherlock	Labour	13265.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-01 00:00:00	Prelude	396	 I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  How did we arrive at a stage in the country's development where thousands of people are on local authority waiting lists yet thousands of houses throughout the land are unoccupied?  When did we, economically and socially speaking, decide that a house would become a tradeable commodity to be used as an instrument for investment primarily and not as a place of refuge or to raise a family?  Until such time as we legislate in this area with people in mind and give up our obsession with the property market we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes.  We have, through this legislation, an opportunity to provide decent housing for all those who need it, if only we can embark on a little lateral thinking. My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, stated that recent figures published showed a massive jump from 43,700 on the social housing waiting lists to nearly 60,000 in just three years.  How did we come to this point when so many houses were being built during this period?  With the right thinking, this legislation provides a golden opportunity to address the imbalance that exists within the social housing sector. The relationship between the Department and the local authorities needs to reflect the realities on the ground.  For instance, in my constituency of Cork East, there is a local authority scheme at Stag Park in Mitchelstown where affordable houses remain unsold and are boarded up.  I have queues out the door of my clinics in Mitchelstown with people on the social housing list who would dearly love to obtain one of these modern, well-appointed and fantastically designed houses.  However, they will remain unsold until such time as the Department frees up the financial obligation of the local authority to the Department with regard to their sale.  The current market conditions dictate that they will remain unsold because they have been boarded up for so long that a certain stigma is attached to them. The Department must become more flexible in its approach.  A house which is designated as an affordable house and which is unsold within a specific period must be allowed to be occupied at the discretion of the local authority if the local authority has made a decent attempt to sell the house.  The Minister of State must examine this.  Countless thousands of affordable houses throughout the State could be used for social housing but this cannot be done because of certain constraints placed upon them. Generally, I am in favour of voluntary housing associations but I have certain reservations about trends that I have seen within this sector.  I am anxious that voluntary housing associations would not supplant the role of the local authority in terms of the provision of social housing.  It is true that they fulfil a need in terms of catering to a certain demographic.  However, I have documented cases and had representations from quite a number of constituents who find that once they occupy a voluntary housing association property, they find they have no recourse to eventual purchase or to an independent arbiter with regard to the conditions of their tenancy.  In one case I encountered, the rent of a couple on a fixed social welfare income was increased substantially by the voluntary housing association and they had no recourse to an independent arbiter when they sought to question the increase.  This issue must be addressed. Irish people will always want to own their own home.  This is ingrained within our psyche.  This trait must inform how we formulate policy.  If one provides a social house it must be on the basis that it will become available for purchase in the medium to long term.  This choice and right must exist even if it is not exercised.  The current tenant purchase scheme is woefully inadequate, in that there would be a golden opportunity to sell off older housing stock if it were discounted at a more favourable rate.  Most local authority houses I visit which have long-term tenancies have so much invested in them by the occupiers that the valuations they get when they seek to purchase the house have no bearing on the original real cost of construction and the amount invested in the intervening period. If one wishes to purchase one's home in the current climate there is a discounted rate but it has become an instrument of the market by virtue of a valuation which must be sought.  This is in spite of the fact that people have built communities around their homes and have ensured the upkeep of the houses for the duration of their tenancies.  If we are to incentivise the ownership of houses we must create better conditions to allow older people to purchase their homes.  There is a net benefit to the State in that it would yield a massive dividend and would provide an opportunity in terms of significantly reducing maintenance costs to local authorities. Section 16 provides that making a draft plan is required.  The country is facing a pensions nightmare for the future.  On several occasions, I recall the Minister for Health and Children reminding us that life expectancy has risen dramatically since the Government came into office.  I question her claim to fame in this respect, but if we are living longer, then any draft plans must be formulated on the basis that housing provision for older people in the future is encapsulated within such plans.  We cannot keep shoving people into nursing homes, and sheltered housing is only part of the solution.  Where a draft plan is formulated on foot of a county development plan, lands must be zoned specifically for housing for the elderly.  There must be some degree of forward planning which must start now to deal with that issue. If people are currently residing in quite large houses, they will want to downsize in the future.  It is probable that there will be a demand for smaller units.  County development plans — by extension, the draft housing plans — must take account of that kind of planning.  We cannot just plan for the next two or three years, but for 20 years hence.  We need a little bit of foresight in that respect.  In my experience, I have found that planning policy units lack the necessary resources to carry out demographic studies of population trends for future housing provision.  The Government must take cognisance of this.  The CSO could be a viable instrument in assisting local authorities in that respect. The rental accommodation scheme with which I am most familiar is in north Cork, and it has been well deployed.  This is the case because the staff have used the scheme to best effect, which is a tribute to people who are using limited resources.  How did we get to a stage where we would use taxpayers' money — approximately €450 million — to pay a rental subsidy to a landlord with a second or third home, to ensure housing provision for people on the housing list?  There is an economic fallacy to that argument.  It defies any kind of logic or common sense.  We need to wean ourselves off this dependence on rent allowance.  There would be no need for a rental accommodation scheme if resources were being allocated to provide houses for people in need.  If we take approximately €450 million per annum, there is a multiplier from that which would adequately provide capital spending for all of the social housing needed.  I am not railing against the scheme as it currently exists, because it has done well in the circumstances in which it operates, but there must be more lateral thinking about how we provide social housing.  That is something that needs to be examined. The over-supply of housing in large parts of the country in the recent past must teach us that the relationship between demand and supply must be a qualitative one and not based on quantity alone.  We must re-jig our thinking in this area.  I wish to speak specifically on antisocial behaviour in this respect.  We had a scheme on Mallow Town Council whereby the council and other sources funded a tenant liaison officer.  Since that officer's contract of employment had to be terminated because there was not adequate funding to meet the need the qualitative relationship between the tenants and the local authority has deteriorated.  The work the person in question carried out on a three year contract was so valuable that the relationship between tenants and the local authority improved dramatically during that period and the incidence of antisocial behaviour reduced dramatically.  One way to deal with antisocial behaviour is to build relationships by ensuring that a tenant liaison officer is appointed under statutory provision in every local authority jurisdiction.  The relationship building process in this instance was done over time and with a very meticulous approach and it yielded results.  That needs to be examined in this Bill. Section 30 states that the housing authority can delegate some or all of its management and control functions in respect of its dwellings to a designated body.  I would like the Minister to expand on that provision.  I have a certain reservation that if we move to cede power to the voluntary housing associations, we would cede exclusive control of social housing policy to non-statutory bodies.  The Minister should speak about this in his response. There is land zoned in Mallow that is owned by the town council, in which a plan for more than 100 houses was formulated.  The entrance to that site is currently no wider than the width of two cars.  There is a lack of joined up thinking where land owned by a council is zoned for local authority housing.  There must be proper access to the site.  The land adjoins a private estate and if one considers the multiplier of 100 houses for cars and traffic movements, then without any rectification of the access, we are storing up difficulties for the future.  We cannot speak about antisocial behaviour or about building communities unless we have proper zoning and proper access to local authority housing sites.  That is something that needs to be addressed as well. For too long, social housing has been a poor relation in long-term planning.  Successive Governments have built houses with the sole aim of getting people off the list.  That in itself is worthwhile, but we have never thought about the implications of crowding hundreds of houses into one area without any thought for the implications of lack of proper space, amenity space and proper access to the sites.  That is why so many problems exist.  There will be a great opportunity presently for the Government to ensure social housing provision in a way that provides for everyone in need of housing.  We must have some foresight in our thinking in that regard.

This restriction applies to every student who already holds a qualification at the same level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained or whether or not funding was previously awarded.  The objective of the student grant schemes is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to postgraduate studies.  There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in the light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.

Based on an initial analysis of the figures, today's budget will create a larger demographic sector of the working poor.  When the income levies and health levy are factored in as well as the fact that most people working in the private sector have had to endure pay cuts across the board, the real income they will be left with will be so marginal that it will not enable them to have an adequate standard of living.  We all appreciate that measures had to be taken.  However, they should have been taken on the basis that they would not be regressive.  There is now a large demographic cohort of ordinary working families who will be devastated financially by the proposals within this document. With regard to income tax, we were always told that the canons of taxation dictated it should be progressive.  I do not see anything in the budget that ensures high net worth individuals will pay a proportionate amount of their incomes towards getting us out of the mess we are in.  I do not see why the Minister for Finance could not have introduced a higher tax rate at this time so as to cushion the blow against middle and low income earners.  It is completely regressive and when people wake up to the fact of what this document contains, it will make them even more angry at the Government than they already are.  That is why I will not support this resolution."

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

2800	SeanSherlock	Labour	13286.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	457	" Was it not a very cynical move to introduce such a measure at this time of the year, knowing it would not affect people until the winter?  It speaks volumes about how this Government treats older people that it did not have the guts to try this in December, during normal budgetary times, because if those who marched when the Government tried to take medical cards from the over-70s numbered thousands, they would be out in their hundreds of thousands during December. We now live in a society with a breakdown in the intergenerational solidarity that always sustained the communities in this country.  That a Government would take away an economic measure that gives comfort to older people, at a time when people spend extra on their families and themselves, was miserly and unbelievable.  No Fianna Fáil leader, such as Lemass or de Valera, would have countenanced such a move during their tenures.  It is a measure of how far right this Government has moved in distancing itself from the very people who would ordinarily have supported it. The philosopher Bertrand Russell stated, ""To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future"".  This Government is increasingly isolating our older people, taking measures that are dumping people in nursing homes who cannot get nursing home subvention, putting older people into penury in respect of how they pay for care in their autumn and winter years and now the Government is taking away a measure that gave some small assistance to see them through the winter months. Those who I represent are not upper middle class people living in urban conurbations.  They are living in rural areas, in older housing stock, have modest pensions and must have the fire lighting all day every day to keep the back boiler going to run the radiators to ensure there is heat in the house.  By reducing this payment, the Minister is telling us these people can pay for their heating costs but when they go to the community welfare officer to ask for a supplementary payment they will not be given it.  They would ordinarily have used the bonus to pay for the extra bag of coal or other such simple measures that sustained them through the hard winter months.  I ask the Minister to think of the intergenerational solidarity we always had in this country, the social solidarity to which previous Fianna Fáil Governments adhered, and I ask her to reverse this miserly, mean measure.  To introduce it at this time of the year, when it is not so high on the political agenda, is a cynical move.  It is symptomatic of the cynical politics that inhabit this country."
2801	SeanSherlock	Labour	13286.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	704	 I represent a rural constituency where many people live in isolated areas and this scheme allowed them to have the peace of mind and feeling of security brought about by having a monitored alarm system.  Their relatives were also reassured by the scheme.  I do not understand, therefore, why the scheme is being suspended.  I hope the Minister will be true to his word when he says it will be reinstated in September. This signifies a further erosion of services, particularly for older people.  Tonight we debated the loss of the Christmas bonus for pensioners and we all remember the fiasco of the medical cards for the over 70s.  Now many older people who live independently in isolated areas no longer feel safe as a result of the loss of this scheme. It also gives a certain degree of comfort to people who might embark on robberies in rural areas.  People are now storing money at home and older people have always had a tendency to do so.  The reduction in home help hours means there are fewer callers to people in rural areas, so the lack of monitored alarms will have an effect.  In the Fermoy area of my constituency of Cork East, 51 monitored alarms were distributed since January.  A further 28 older people were on the waiting list.  They will now have to pay approximately €300 from their pension to get an alarm. According to Irish Rural Link, Muintir na Tire and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the scheme costs approximately €3 million but €2.4 million of that is recouped through VAT paid to the Exchequer.  It is a worthwhile scheme and I ask the Minister to reinstate it.

2805	SeanSherlock	Labour	13293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	336	" I welcome the publication of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pat Rabbitte in introducing the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill, which I believe is the forerunner to the legislation before the House today.  I also acknowledge the very helpful document published by the Oireachtas Library and Research service, which was an invaluable source for me, in particular, in seeking to interpret the legislation. The basis on which we would support the legislation is the morass that exists in Irish society today.  This is exemplified by the spate of ruthless killings we have borne witness to over a number of years.  The question outside these walls is whether the tipping point has been reached — and whether this legislative proposal will facilitate that tipping point to restore some semblance of peace, again, on our streets.  We were previously told that the murder of Veronica Guerin was the turning point in the context of gangland killings.  That point came and went and now we are being told that the murder of Shane Geoghegan in Limerick is the turning point.  I hope it is, and I continue to hope that this legislation, while it will not be a panacea, will facilitate a process that will allow the Garda Síochána to have the necessary tools to allow it to carry out its work in this regard. As Deputy Rabbitte has said recently, in outlining the Labour Party position on this, the fundamental question is whether the response by way of legislation is reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.  I believe that it is and that the Garda must be given powers to respond in a manner that facilitates a preventative mechanism.  The powers within this legislation, on first reading, would deem that to be the case.  I am encouraged, also, by the statement on 17 April by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which gave a cautious welcome to the Bill.  Its statement said that intelligence-led policing and not the restriction of fair trial rights was the most effective way to tackle gangland crime.  I refer specifically to Mr. Mark Kelly, the ICCL's director who stated that the Bill would at last place Garda surveillance on a lawful basis that broadly conforms to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  He went on to say that the need for judicial authorisation of most forms of surveillance was welcome.  However, it remained unclear why it was felt unacceptable to allow tracking devices to be placed on people's vehicles on Garda authority alone. While the ICCL has reservations, I am sure many of them can be worked through on the later Stages of the Bill.  Mr. Kelly said that in the interests of protection of privacy, the ICCL was urging the Minister to publicly disclose before the Bill becomes law the proposed content of the regulations foreseen in section 8(2) in order to ensure that there will be a human rights framework for the use by gardaí of tracking devices.  I understand that Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier that this would also be teased out on later Stages.  However, I welcome the ICCL's support while appreciating its concerns in relation to Article 8 under the European Convention of Human Rights 2003, and the recognition of the need to ensure that the right to a fair trial is maintained, or not compromised in any way. I hope that putting into effect an explicit statutory provision in relation to surveillance will assuage any fears regarding the rights of an individual and the need to reduce crime.  I believe that ICCL support for this, while qualified, is significant.  My interpretation of this support is that there is no danger such an Act would contravene Article 40.3 of the Constitution in term of the personal rights of the citizen.  Such Article 40.3 rights are germane to the tipping point or the turning point I spoke of earlier.  What Shane Geoghegan's murder teaches us is that at some crucial point the personal rights of a citizen must not be unqualified.  That is to say, they are not absolute.  If we are to pursue his killers and those of others, then the constitutional rights of some must be subservient to the common good, and as the late Mr. Justice Hamilton previously stated, subject to the requirements of public order and morality. I believe that is what this legislation is about.  It is about ensuring that we can reach a stage where a person's personal rights are vindicated but that the common good and the desire for the rule of law is maintained or restored within this country.  We need to get to a point where we can have some confidence that the powers the Garda have will be used to such an extent. If I was never involved in the legislative process, I would still take the view that it is necessary for the Garda to have such powers to enable it to carry out its functions.  That this Bill will provide a statutory framework for carrying out such surveillance by gardaí and others is the right approach at this time.  In fact, it is overdue and if the gardaí are not given such powers, then the morass that this society finds itself in, which incorporates the slaughter of innocents, will continue and go unpunished in some cases. In addressing the specific provisions of the Bill, there are a number of questions to which I seek answers.  Section 5 provides that ""an authorisation may be madeex parte  and shall be heard otherwise than in public”.  I hope that the power to seek authorisation for surveillance in such circumstances is balanced against the power of the judge to grant a specific authorisation.  If I interpret that provision correctly, there is no onus on the superior officer to state a particular offence and I hope that this power will be used wisely.  However, I am satisfied the specifications in regard to the authorisation leave no grounds for a potential abuse of power. Section 5 outlines that where an authorisation is sought, there are specifics in regard to the particulars of the surveillance device authorised to be used, the person who or the place or thing to be the subject of the surveillance, the name of the superior officer to whom it is issued, the conditions subject to which the authorisation is issued and the date of expiry.  It is necessary that there are specific provisions within that authorisation which will ensure there is no vagueness about the authorisation and, therefore, it will not be potentially open to abuse.  I welcome that provision in regard to the authorisation and I hope it will be stringently adhered to when implemented. In regard to sections 5 and 6, where an authorisation is sought, it may authorise the superior officer named in it or any member of the Garda Síochána, member of the Defence Forces or officer of the Revenue Commissioners designated by that superior officer.  There is a provision where a superior officer may seek the authorisation but that any other member of the Garda Síochána can also be subject to that authorisation.  If another garda who is not a superior officer is subject to that provision, is he or she named in it? If we are to grant new powers of surveillance, will there be specific training or will resources be allocated to train junior officers under the legislation?  If the legislation is to work, it must be on the basis that every officer, whether in the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces, is given specific training which will ensure there is no scope to challenge the provisions of the legislation thereafter where criminal proceedings are brought.  Will the Minister address that in his reply? I refer to section 8.  What does the Minister interpret as a ""tracking device""?  I have watched many cop shows and we all know what a tracking device is.  In practical terms, how will this play out?  I know it provides for specific vehicles to be tracked.  I would like to hear the Minister's take on that section when he responds to the debate. I refer to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the powers vested in section 11.  There is a complaints procedure in the legislation which states specifically that recommendations can be made and that a matter can be reported to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  What are the powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in regard to the legislation?  There is a reporting procedure but is there a power of intervention or recommendation which must be acted upon where a complaint is made? I understand the provision in regard to the power of a Circuit Court judge and the complaints referee.  That is very clear.  However, the powers in regard to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are unclear to me and I would like a more specific interpretation of that. I hope from a societal point of view, that we have reached a tipping point where we can now restore some semblance of peace on our streets and that once this legislation is enacted, there will be a pressure on people who have acted with impunity which will stymie their activities and put them out of business for a long time to come.  It is necessary to enact this legislation and in that sense, I welcome it.  It will not provide a panacea for all our ills but it will provide the start of a real process which will restore some semblance of peace."
2806	SeanSherlock	Labour	13293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	336	 The animal health problems on the farm referred to by Deputy White have been ongoing for several years and relate mainly to ill-thrift and stunted growth of cattle on the farm in addition to reduced milk yield.  I thank Deputy White for her tenacious determination to pursue this investigation in recent years on behalf of Mr. Dan Brennan, his family and the wider community of Castlecomer.  The farm in question, which I have visited, has been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years.  Since late 2006 it has been the subject of further thorough and comprehensive investigations by the Department's centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis, CVERA, based at University College Dublin.  A high degree of inter-agency involvement and co-operation has been a feature of the investigations.  The agencies involved have included the EPA, Kilkenny County Council, Teagasc, the HSE — previously, the South Eastern Health Board was involved — and my Department. In 2004, my Department's veterinary laboratory service arranged for a wide-ranging study to be undertaken into the problems on the farm, following which a report was produced in June 2006.  The report documented the range of the investigations, the methodology involved and the results of different aspects.  The farmer involved had certain difficulties with some aspects of the report and, at his request, the report was not published. As part of the inter-agency investigation, several reports, in addition to my Department's 2006 report, were produced.  These included the UCC report of 2006 commissioned by the EPA entitled, An Impact Assessment on Epiphytic Lichens; the Ambient Air Quality Survey report of 5 May 2006; the John J Gardiner report, entitled Condition of Trees on the Farm of December 2005; and the EPA summary report of the work completed by the EPA as part of the multi-agency investigation of animal health in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny of September 2006. Apart from these reports my Department and others have also been involved in several initiatives on this farm.  For example, a herd health programme was developed by the farmer's private veterinary practitioner and supported by my Department, to deal with respiratory disease in calves and mastitis in cows.  The Department also funded treatment for mastitis, a vaccination programme, the provision of calf hutches to segregate the calves from each other and feeding trials.  Other initiatives included a grassland management plan, monitoring growth of calves at grass and checking sources of water to the farm. Following finalisation of the Department's veterinary laboratory service report in 2006, the then Minister met a delegation of interests, including the farmer, in July 2006 and confirmed that the authorities were more than willing to pursue the investigation further and to seek to get to the root of the problems on the farm.  The Minister also met with the director of the EPA to discuss a report it had produced on the environmental impact of emissions.  Arising from this process, in 2006 the then Minister asked the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis to conduct a further thorough and comprehensive study. The centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis study is designed to complement the work to date and used some different approaches to investigate the production problems on the farm.  The study entails a major sampling and testing programme, including investigation of various metabolic pathways, as well as epidemiological studies.  In addition, a comprehensive and detailed soil survey is included in the remit of the study.  A draft report arising from this work has now been sent for peer review and when this is completed the report will be finalised and published. The article in theKilkenny People refers to a report.  However, I am not aware to which document the newspaper refers and I trust the Deputy would agree, therefore, that it is inappropriate for me to comment in detail upon it.  I emphasise that my Department and I, along with the other agencies involved, are determined to establish the underlying cause of the problems on this farm.  It is inappropriate at this stage to make any further comment on the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis investigation until the report is finalised and published, which will take place shortly.

This document consolidates the principles an official is expected to adhere to in carrying out his or her official duties and following their retirement or resignation from the service.  If an official breaches the terms of the code, he or she can be subjected to disciplinary procedures in accordance with the Civil Service Disciplinary Code as revised in accordance with the terms of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005.  The content of both documents can be viewed on the Department of Finance's website, www.finance.ie.
2815	SeanSherlock	Labour	13307.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	426	 I wish to share my time with Deputy Arthur Morgan.
2816	SeanSherlock	Labour	13307.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	428	 In the interest of an overview, I ask the Minister to indicate the effect on buoyancy within the economy of the most recent budget and the subsequent publication of the Finance Bill.  If the Labour Party's estimates are correct, it is proposed that more than €3 billion will be taken out of the economy as a result of the measures proposed in the Bill.  This would have an effect on economic buoyancy through returns into the Exchequer.  We are very concerned that the lack of buoyancy or the effect on buoyancy is extremely negative.  This will have further negative consequences for economic growth in the economy.  I would like a coherent and specific response from the Minister with regard to the measures proposed in the Bill and their effect on economic buoyancy.  It is important that if we find ourselves in a scenario where we seek to stimulate the economy that we have those figures. On the pension levy and its effect on part-time public sector workers, I have had representations from constituents who are employed by County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  They work on a part-time basis, have never subscribed to a pension plan within the VEC, yet they have been hit by the pension levy.  How were these people deemed eligible for the pension levy if they are only part-time employees and have never subscribed to a pension scheme or provisions?  Is it legal to apply the pension levy to this coterie of workers, whether within the VEC or any other public sector body with part-time employees who do not pay into pension schemes? I wish to raise the issue of capital allowances, specifically with regard to the low paid, self-employed and farmers.  Section 2, in dealing with the income levy, outlines technical amendments to clarify that the levy applies on gross income.  Subsection (1), paragraph (a) states: ‘aggregate income for the year of assessment', in relation to an individual and a year of assessment, means the aggregate of the individual's relevant emoluments in the year of assessment, including relevant emoluments that are paid in whole or in part for a year of assessment other than the year of assessment during which the payment is made, and relevant income for the year of assessment; In the past year a dairy farmer might have had significant capital outlay to comply with EU legislation through the farm waste management scheme and the nitrates directive and would have been subject to the farm improvement scheme, for which there is no economic return.  He might have invested €100,000 in respect of those schemes and had single tax credits such as a €3,000 pension contribution.  If his gross farm receipts amounted to €150,000 and one factors in costs between variable and fixed of approximately €115,000, his net income would amount to €35,000. Taking into account the income levy of 2%, the health contribution of 4% and the PRSI levy of 3% for the full year the total deductions come to approximately €2,700.  The overall deductions on the income, net of capital allowances could be in the region of 9.4%.  Adding the capital allowances to the pension contribution they could be in the region of10.5%. Could provision be made within the Bill for self-employed people who have significant capital outlays to take those capital allowances into account in the calculation of income?  That should be done particularly where someone is deemed to fall below a certain income threshold.  There is scope to do this for someone who is self-employed when it is necessary to encourage growth, particularly in the rural economy. In rural Ireland dairy farmers have had a significant outlay and their incomes have been dramatically reduced.  It is, therefore, important to have some stimulus to maintain the income status quo.  Not taking into account capital allowances made on Government schemes or obligations under EU legislation would bring some equity into play.
2817	SeanSherlock	Labour	13307.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	426	 The National Disability Strategy supports and reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities. Its elements include — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, the Disability Act, 2005 and its associated Sectoral Plans published in 2006 by six Government Departments, the Citizens Information Act, 2007 and a commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability support services. The Deputy will be aware that although my Department does not have a Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, appropriate education services are supported as a central element in the Government commitment to supporting those with special educational needs/disability. This support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within the education sector. At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports are also provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs. Such supports include additional resource teaching support, special needs assistant support, special transport arrangements, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. When the overall annual spend in 2009 to support persons with special educational needs is considered, my Department will spend an estimated €1bn in total by the end of this year. The equivalent spends for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 and 2008 are €468m, €605m, €706m and €838m and over €900m respectively. With these levels of investment, it is clear that significant progress has been made in educational provision for people with special needs in recent years. This progress has been achieved through the additional investments made by successive Ministers for Education. Advances in the level of dedicated provision to support children with special educational needs include: Schools are now allocated extra resource teachers and special needs assistants to enable them meet the special educational needs of students. In the region of 19,000 staff in our schools work solely with children with special needs. Special Needs Assistant posts have increased from under 300 in 1997 to over 10,000 in 2009. Primary schools are staffed up-front with additional teachers to cater for the most prevalent special educational needs — removing the need for assessments and delays in recruitment. The level of training available to teachers has improved significantly. The establishment of the Special Education Support Service to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant. In 2008, the service was in contact with over 23,000 teachers. The range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to professionals in the special needs area has also significantly expanded. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) aims to support the personal, social and educational development of all children through the application of psychological theory and practice in education, having particular regard for children with special educational needs. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established to co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs. The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. Assistive technology, specialist equipment, building adaptations and special school transport arrangements continue to be provided as necessary.  As announced on Budget day, in the current financial circumstances it is not possible to proceed with full implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2010 as originally envisaged. Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date. I am particularly pleased that, in order to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date, the Government provided €20m in 2009 — €10m for education services and €10m for health services. In my Department this additional funding will provide for an expansion of the NEPS service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service as well as enhancing the capacity of the NCSE to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs. In addition teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs and there will be further investment in teacher training in this area.

2819	SeanSherlock	Labour	13308.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-14 00:00:00	Prelude	173	" We broadly welcome the legislation, which is long overdue, and wonder why the draft Bill from 2007 has not been introduced before now.  However, it is now before us.  It is ludicrous that a significant number of people are incarcerated on the basis that they are unable to pay fines.  It is expeditious and proper that the State put in place a system to allow people to pay their fines by instalment or other means, thus negating the need to go to prison.  The case was already made by my colleague in Fine Gael that the problems that persist in prisons as a result of overcrowding are in no small way attributable to the fact that people are in prison due to non-payment of fines.  This is leading to an undue burden on the State and must be rectified. There was a previous judgment in this regard. I believe it was Mr. Justice Henchy who stated that in no circumstances should a court impose imprisonment as an alternative to a fine solely on the grounds that the defendant could not afford to pay the fine considered by the court to be appropriate.  Imprisonment is the most serious punishment, and if it is not appropriate because the case is not sufficiently serious, a fine should be imposed as a lesser penalty.  If the defendant cannot afford an appropriate fine, the amount should be lowered, and if he or she cannot afford any fine, imprisonment should not be considered as an alternative solely on the grounds that the fine cannot be paid.  This is an important point.  According to that judgment, it is better for someone to walk free without punishment rather than be punished by imprisonment just because he or she has no money to pay a fine.  Otherwise we are imprisoning people on grounds of poverty rather than according to the seriousness of the offences they commit.  This legislation will facilitate a process whereby those people who are unable to pay their fines in one fell swoop will be able to pay by instalments.  This results in greater equity in that somebody who is convicted of a crime but is not a criminal in the classic sense of the word now has an opportunity to pay the fine in smaller instalments, which is to be welcomed. I do not understand why, when the Law Reform Commission introduces recommendations — which in this instance date back to 1991 — the legislature does not come forward with proposals in a more timely fashion to rectify matters or make the law better.  This Bill was first published in 2007 and the Law Reform Commission has been speaking on this issue since 1991.  Any functioning democracy should have within its remit the ability to enact laws in a timely fashion.  If one considers the cost factor alone, based on the number of people who have served prison sentences for non-payment of fines, we could have saved the State countless thousands of euro if better legislation had been introduced earlier.  The Law Reform Commission, from any document I have seen, has been far-reaching in its approach to these issues.  This is a matter that needs to be addressed. I do not think it is fair that the limit above which instalments can be paid is €100.  This limit should be removed so that fines of less than €100 can be also paid in instalments.  There are many people out there who survive on subsistence wages or rely solely on income from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and to whom literally every penny counts.  To those people a fine of as little as €50 would be a considerable burden. Provision should be made in the Bill so that a fine of less than €100 can be paid by instalment.  Daily, I deal with people who find themselves in difficulty over the non-payment of refuse charges, for example.  Local authorities have systems whereby €5 per week could be paid.  In many such instances, the outstanding debt could be as little as €70 or €80.  The same type of principle should apply to this provision, a matter I hope can be addressed. The legislation's net effect should be to reduce the number of impecunious offenders being sentenced to imprisonment.  There should be careful monitoring of sentencing practices across the board to ensure the objective is achieved.  For this reason, the Bill should provide for some form of statistical analysis whereby its net effect can be quantitatively and qualitatively measured in order that we can see the knock-on effect in terms of any reduction in the number of people presenting to prison and the success or otherwise of the legislation as enacted.  If the legislation is updated in future, it is important that there be a statistical analysis.  In this context, the Courts Service would be an important actor. I refer to the Bills Digest.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service issued a good document from which it is worth quoting.  It states: A problem inherent in a system of penalties based on fines is the changing value of money over time.  This can deprive a fine of its punitive nature and reduce its deterrent effect. In terms of indexation, the Schedules are clearly set out in section 2, but we will submit some amendments that will be of a semantic nature as opposed to a substantive one.  A good job has been done in the legislation's drafting in terms of the changing monetary effect that will persist in future.  This is welcome. The issue of a statement of means should be addressed.  If someone presents himself or herself before the court and claims an inability to pay a fine despite possessing sound financial means, by what mechanism can the judge determine whether the person has the ability to pay?  While there is provision in the legislation, should it be more prescriptive?  As mentioned by the Minister of State, section 13 creates an offence of knowingly or recklessly making a statement ""that is false or misleading in any material respect to a court conducting an inquiry into a person's financial circumstances"".  Should the section be more prescriptive in seeking a statement of means by the convicted person to prevent those with means from claiming otherwise?  As there is scope for someone to misrepresent his or her position to the court, it might be desirable that a statement of means be sworn by the offender who is seeking an abatement of the fine by reason of his or her circumstances. Two issues are not provided for in the Bill, to which the Minister of State might respond.  Under the Bill, could judges be trained to analyse the types of scenario that appear before them and to work with the Courts Service to ensure efficiency is built into the system?  There seems to be no specific provision regarding revenue offences.  Is there such a provision? I do not wish to repeat the points made by my colleague in Fine Gael, although I could.  I would like to see specific issues addressed.  The Labour Party is broadly in favour of the Bill and strongly believes that it is high time to reduce the numbers presenting to prisons for, in many instances, being unable to pay fines.  It is proper that legislation be introduced to prevent such occurrences.  The Government must take into account the fact that many people find it difficult to pay fines of less than even €100.  We also believe that, since some people might try to misrepresent their true financial positions before judges, the Bill should have a prescriptive provision vis-à-vis the presentation of a statement of means.  Judges should be trained on the Bill’s mechanisms and its effect should be monitored by the Courts Service to ensure its intended impact because only by means of a statistical analysis can we measure the Bill’s true impact."
2820	SeanSherlock	Labour	13308.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-14 00:00:00	Prelude	173	 As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures.  Pupils may move to a different school or to post-primary school.  In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.  This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  There are 55 and 126 whole-time equivalent SNAs in primary and post-primary schools in counties Leitrim and Roscommon respectively.  My Department will be in further contact with the Deputy in relation to a more detailed breakdown.

I seek such a debate in the House to ask the Minister for Health and Children to explain how she proposes that Cork University Hospital will become the sole provider of acute care.  I also seek an explanation as to how people’s lives in the catchment area of these hospitals will be affected as a result of this reconfiguration.

The Minister is not giving us much solace on the responses to the downward trajectory in global milk prices.  Is there scope within the European Commission and will the Minister ask at next week's Agriculture and Fisheries Council for a dairy adjustment scheme to be implemented under EU legislation through the use of unused EU funding?
2825	SeanSherlock	Labour	13314.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	442	 Will the aid to private storage continue indefinitely or does it have a definitive timeline?  Quotas will be abolished in 2015.  Notwithstanding that we cannot foretell what will happen in global markets, the Government must take responsibility for the question that is on every farmer's lips.  Will farmers be able to produce milk after 2015, notwithstanding the current difficulties?  It would appear the Government has no coherent policy regarding the potential loss of many farms and an outflow from farming because we do not know what will happen in 2015.  There is no sense of direction from the Government in terms of planning for that eventuality.  Farmers need to get such a sense.

2837	SeanSherlock	Labour	13314.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	624	 I welcome the publication of this Private Members' Bill and I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on the work he has done on it.  It is worthy of support.  Deputy Pat Rabbitte summed up the basis of the Bill last night when he stated that this is a growth industry for the times in which we live.  People find themselves indebted for whatever reason and in some cases they are extremely vulnerable, stressed and unable to discharge debts, not because of recklessness on their part but because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves.  Only a small number of debtors plunged themselves knowingly and recklessly into these circumstances.  In so far as recklessness is involved, it is not merely on the side of the consumer, but is frequently shared by the lender where moneys are recklessly lent in circumstances where questions might reasonably have been raised about ability to repay.  Honest, decent, law abiding citizens find themselves in these circumstances, and one has heard the case being made that they are being subjected to debt collection methods of which the House could not approve. It is important to speak about the culture surrounding instances where people find themselves subjected to inordinate amounts of debt.  It has been stated previously that the level of financial literacy in this country still leaves a lot to be desired.  If I look at the socio-economic group that finds itself largely at the mercy of debt collectors, I note they are invariably persons who may not have a degree of financial literacy that would pervade throughout all of the socio-economic strata.  In 1997, the OECD conducted an international audit literacy survey.  It found that 25% of Irish adults have difficulties with simple everyday numeracy and literacy tasks, such as adding up a bill, understanding a payslip or filling in a building society form.  The National Adult Literacy Association and MABS have done much work in this regard, but it is important that if this Bill is taken on board, we should look at the overall context of people getting themselves into increasing debt.  A proportion of those people will find themselves in that situation because they may not have read the fine print. It should be acknowledged that IFSRA has done much work in making the language of financial services much clearer for people, and the campaign for plain English has achieved much in that respect.  However, there are people who are still getting into debt, either through debt collection agencies or debt collectors, and a portion of that is due to an inability to understand the process on which they embarked in the first instance.  That must be borne in mind. When it comes to the issuance of a licence for the purposes of undertaking debt collection, it is important that something is built into the legislation that protects the consumer.  The licence holder should be made take cognisance of a certain set of criteria.  Although they are not dealt with specifically within the legislation, perhaps they could be dealt with in section 5 and section 6.  Where debt is being collected, it should be collected where there is an assignment of wages.  This is referred to in the Bill.  There must be safeguards to prevent an assignment of wages from adversely affecting the debtor's ability to maintain a basic standard of living for themselves and their family.  In particular, the level of an assignment should not undermine the debtor's access to the basics such as food, clothing, housing and basic utilities, so there is a social inclusion component built into the Bill in order for people to have their basic rights. There also needs to be more regulation of the costs of debt collection in order to protect the debtor and his or her family.  There are often penalty charges for late payment built into debt, and the interest payments on that alone are significant and sometimes can be a multiple of the original debt.  That is something that should be examined. In welcoming the Bill, we also need to look at whether or not there is a basic EU model.  Deputy Rabbitte stated last night that there does not appear to be a regulatory framework for debt collectors across the EU.  My research tells me that there is no such framework but I am open to correction on that.  We need to have some kind of overarching regulation of debt collection, so that every citizen knows his or her rights and entitlements.  There should be an effective right of redress in the Bill for the debtor in respect of harassment, excess debt recovery costs and the wrongful removal of goods.  If a regulator is empowered to look at this issue, there should be some framework to give a right of redress to the debtor.  If we look at the nature of most unregulated debt, it is very often at the hands of moneylenders.  It remains a difficulty as to how we can regulate moneylenders who operate in the black market, but for those who are incorporated and are collecting debt, then harassment issues should allow for a certain right of redress on the part of the debtor where actions are proven to be excessive. The defaulting consumer should have a statutory right to be advised on who is authorised to collect the debt so that there is complete transparency in the process.  It could be argued that the use of multiple debt collection agencies to collect debts simultaneously should be prohibited.  We dealt with the Fines Bill last week in the House.  We are witnessing a sea change in Government thinking, so that we are trying to keep people out of prison and facilitate them by allowing for payment of fines by instalment.  That is to be welcomed.  It could be argued that a similar type of facility should exist for people who find themselves in debt; they should not be subjected to the same offences.
2838	SeanSherlock	Labour	13314.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	649	 We have had reports from Horwath, Wrixon, Teamwork and Professor John Higgins and today's Irish Examiner claims that all acute services other than those provided at Cork University Hospital, CUH, will be done away with.  Subsequently, a HSE press release stated that Kerry General Hospital will be excluded from the process.  What will be the position of acute services in hospitals other than Kerry General Hospital and CUH from 9 June? The people of the region have been through the mill, given the obfuscation on simple questions on the future locations of acute services for the countless thousands served by hospitals in, for example, Mallow, Bantry and Cork.  We want a little bit of decency and for people to tell us their intentions with regard to acute services.  Mallow General Hospital is efficient and at the top of its league in terms of cleanliness and the other HIQA statistics.  It needs its acute services, given its catchment area of more than 150,000 people.

However, my Department has guidelines in relation to the size of classrooms in new school buildings.  These are guidelines rather than statutory  requirements. In the provision of major extensions/new school buildings it is the current practice of my Department to use a guideline of 80 sq. metres as a standard  size of general primary school classroom. This space allows for the inclusion  of two en suite toilets and in room storage. 80 sq. metres is considered to be the optimum size of classroom in a new primary school and was determined by studies carried out by my Department and  in line with international best practice. Due to the varied nature of subject provision under the post-primary curriculum the guidelines for classroom size in a new or refurbished post-primary school  are more complex and vary from 49m2 for a general classroom up to 136m2 for  some of the larger specialist subject rooms. Detailed dimensions along with  room layout sheets are set out in my Department's Post-Primary School Design  Guidelines which are available on the Departments web-site. It should be stressed however that, at both primary and post-primary level, these are guidelines rather than statutory requirements. Classrooms in older  schools may be of a smaller size but can allow the full delivery of the  curriculum.

2868	SeanSherlock	Labour	13334.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	646	 I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10. In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment  data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received  and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that  begins next September. My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public  detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now  published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the  details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain  128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my  intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final  position when the allocation processes are completed. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors  such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts  allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment  arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his  or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until  the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will  have been considered. I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to  the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. Following consideration of the case at its  meeting on 14 May 2009, the Board refused the appeal. The Board of Management  of the school has been notified in this regard. The decision of the Appeal  Board is final.

2875	SeanSherlock	Labour	13335.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	67	 Will the Government admit the existence of a political, social and economic morass, at the bottom of which lies the Fianna Fáil Party?  The culture created and nurtured over the past ten years has done much damage to this country's reputation abroad and has created a cynicism about politics and the political class.  It will take years for any restoration of the notion of public service or for the notion that democracy is fundamentally good and should be cherished. We are now in a situation where the rating agency, Standard & Poor's, has changed our designation from AA+ to AA.  One may have certain views on the nature of rating agencies and their methodologies, but that rating sends a signal to the rest of the world that Ireland is not a place in which to do business or in which to invest, but a country where the political and economic circumstances are such that inherent or structural economic flaws mean it is not conducive to investment.  The reason for this is that the political and economic situation is currently so negative that nobody wants to touch the country with a barge pole.  Until there is a change of the guard and the political regime, we cannot hope to restore some semblance of confidence, internationally, economically and politically.  That is the reason the Labour Party supports a vote of no confidence in the Government. Will the Government admit that over the past decade the economy was built on a false edifice that has now come tumbling down like a ton of bricks?  The architects of this false edifice were the Fianna Fáil Party.  Ireland needs to recover economically and to recover faith in the political system.  The people cast their votes in the local and European elections to send a message to Fianna Fáil that its regime and days are numbered.  The people have registered their disgust with the Government not only because they feel that the Fianna Fáil model of governance has failed us, but because they now want a change of the guard.  They want to see a restoration of a model of governance that is based on the fundamental principle of service to all of the people, not just the few. It will take a new political reality to restore the notion of public service.  The past ten years have seen the unhinging of economics from society.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, summed it up when he said the public had been reduced to the level of spectator as the economy is analysed as something separate from society.  It will take a new, centre of left government to have a new discourse and make things different.  That is the reason we support a vote of no confidence in the Government.  We seek change and to inject a new positivism into the political sphere.  The Government will, probably, defeat us with its motion, but it is vital that we in opposition lay down a marker on behalf of the people who voted in recent days to get the Government out.  It is right that those people have their voices echoed by us on this motion. The Labour Party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, stated yesterday that the Fianna Fáil Government allowed our economy to become so reliant on the construction sector that in 2006 one in every four men in the labour force was working in it.  Now, almost one in eight people in our labour force is on the dole, a massive rise in unemployment which has rippled out of the collapsing construction sector.  The Fianna Fáil Government at best turned a blind eye, while the banks and big developers grew the property bubble to bursting point.  The people have paid for this type of cynical politics.  They will no longer continue down this path.  They are sick of the current regime.  It is an ailing and failed regime and we must restore a proper one. By their actions this past weekend, the people have sent a message that the Fianna Fáil way is no longer the way to run a country.  That way is no longer tenable and we can no longer afford it.  Fianna Fáil has moved to a situation where it has almost bankrupted the country.  It can no longer be trusted on the economy.  It has not got a clue.  With some €64 billion in deposits in Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish taxpayer, not the Government, is now the lender of last resort.  That is the regime created by Fianna Fáil, but it has no shame about it.  It comes out day in and out and defends its position.  Those in the Fianna Fáil Party will no longer take responsibility for their actions.  They will not confess to the fact that they could not run the economy properly and have run it into the ground.  That has always been the Fianna Fáil way. They are interested in power for the sake of power and not in public service or the people.  We want a changing of the guard so that we can inject positivity into politics once more, restore some degree of what it means to be a public servant and walk through these halls with pride, knowing the people outside know we are doing something good and performing a public service.  They should be ashamed of themselves.

2881	SeanSherlock	Labour	13341.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	293	 It is vital that we view this legislation in the context of Directive 2009/14/EC.  The changes incorporated within this directive form the basis of the Bill before us.  The purpose of the legislation is to mitigate risk, the risk faced by small depositors or working people who rely heavily on the banking system to assist them in their daily lives.  It is vital at this time that we insure depositors against a run on a bank or financial institution.  Therefore, the provision within the Bill that increases the statutory limit from €20,000 to €100,000 is to be welcomed and necessary, given that a vast number of depositors within a certain age bracket who have contributed to the economy throughout their working lives would have deposits within this range. The fact that the guarantee scheme is to be extended to include the credit unions is also to be welcomed.  However, I too have questions about the credit union movement because the Minister states the current level of contribution is set at 0.2% of the prescribed deposit base.  He went on to say there would be further discussions with the credit union movement as regards admission to the scheme from an administrative perspective.  Will the Minister, please, tell the House what the nature of the discussions with the credit union movement has been so far?  Will he inform us how this will pan out in practical terms for the credit union movement?  Because of the disparate nature of credit unions, some practical difficulties will emerge and I am sure they have questions about the Bill which they will expect us, as legislators, to reflect.  It is easy to forget, too, that a considerable amount of money is held within credit unions.  It would not be equitable, therefore, to exclude them from the ambit of the Bill. The current economic environment is uncertain.  Thankfully, thus far we have not seen a stampede by ordinary depositors to extract their savings from financial institutions.  We must guard against this possibility as the last thing the State needs is a run on the banking system.  It is vital, therefore, that a measure of guarantee is provided by the State so as to ensure ordinary people who are normally casualties in any downturn do not stop putting money into the banks.  By increasing the deposit protection limit from €20,000 to €100,000 we are at least ensuring individual savings will not be split disproportionately between a wider range of institutions.  Liquidity must be preserved within the system.  The only way to do this is to ensure there is sufficient money on deposit. On the matter of moral hazard, the movement of responsibility for this area from the Financial Regulator to the Central Bank has to be explained in greater detail.  I have certain reservations about the role of the Central Bank in the last 12 months in overseeing the banking crisis.  I remain to be convinced that its warnings, issued in quarterly reports, were adequately articulated.  Perhaps it was the case that it was just not being listened to, or perhaps it was not shouting loudly enough about what was going on.  Some, more cynically minded, might suggest there was an air of complicity in terms of what was happening throughout the economy for a number of years.  The Central Bank, with the Financial Regulator, has been diminished in its role in overseeing the banking structure.  However, I am hopeful the Minister will ensure their role in the future will involve vigorous policing of the scheme once it comes into being.
2882	SeanSherlock	Labour	13341.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	327	 I refer to the taking into public ownership of Eircom.  It was reported in the newspapers at the weekend that yet another private equity firm, Permira, has expressed an interest in taking over Eircom.  The others are CVC Capital Partners Limited and STT.  The asking price for Eircom is approximately €100 million but the debt mountain is in the region of €3.8 billion.  If a private equity firm takes over Eircom lock, stock and barrel, I am not convinced we will see an increased rate of broadband penetration in this country.  I am not convinced this would be the most effective way of ensuring the broadband provision and capacity required in order to make this country competitive with regard to rates available in Japan.  A private equity firm will not ensure the rate of penetration will allow us to compete with other countries.  They would concentrate on the most profitable areas and would not ensure the rural economy or society would be served in such a scenario. The Labour Party sought to take Eircom into public ownership to ensure there is another suitable platform for investment in broadband.  If we are to bail out banks, I do not see why we will not enter the fray and take Eircom in charge to ensure all rural exchanges that need to be upgraded are upgraded.  There would be a multiplier effect and a positive net benefit to the rural economy.  It would ensure some income is derived from other users through the unbundling of the local loop.  It is important to debate this.  It is not right to hand it over to private equity firms. The current taxation regime has included increases to taxation and some will argue they were necessary.  As a short, sharp solution we are increasing taxation on income and that is also stifling the economy because people are not spending.  Are we not concentrating on ensuring greater efficiencies in public expenditure?  Today I received the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on the amount spent by the HSE on legal fees between 2006 and 2009, inclusive. The response was that, between barrister and solicitor bills, approximately €8.6 million has been spent in legal fees by the HSE to date. The reason I was prompted to put down the question was because of a young couple who had to send a child to hospital and thought they were covered under private health insurance.  It transpired that they were not covered and they were pursued vigorously for €5,000.  I would hazard a guess that it probably cost the State a multiple of that €5,000 to pursue the family for those costs. The point is that there must be a greater analysis of how we can achieve greater savings without adversely affecting people on lower incomes.  It can be achieved with a little lateral thinking.
2883	SeanSherlock	Labour	13341.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2009-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	293	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 to 282, inclusive, together. The numbers of school projects at each respective stage of architectural planning in June 2008 and June 2009 and their allocated band ratings are contained in the tabular statement.  In the time available to answer these questions it was not possible to compile and verify similar information for June 2007. The proportion of the 2009 capital allocation which will be expended on band one projects in 2009 will depend on the progress of individual projects to tender and construction and the speed of construction for projects on-site.  However, I can inform the Deputy that my Department has profiled an expected spend of €165m on major primary school projects for 2009 and a further €80m on major post-primary projects. A further €80m has been allocated to the 2009 Summer Works Scheme. To date in 2009, expenditure on band 1 projects at primary level has amounted to €19.38m and at post-primary level expenditure on band 1 projects has amounted to €13.29m.  In 2008, my Department spent €230.65m on major primary projects of which €118.34m was on projects completed in 2008 which had a band 1 rating.

2884	SeanSherlock	Labour	13341.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2009-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	327	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 to 282, inclusive, together. The numbers of school projects at each respective stage of architectural planning in June 2008 and June 2009 and their allocated band ratings are contained in the tabular statement.  In the time available to answer these questions it was not possible to compile and verify similar information for June 2007. The proportion of the 2009 capital allocation which will be expended on band one projects in 2009 will depend on the progress of individual projects to tender and construction and the speed of construction for projects on-site.  However, I can inform the Deputy that my Department has profiled an expected spend of €165m on major primary school projects for 2009 and a further €80m on major post-primary projects. A further €80m has been allocated to the 2009 Summer Works Scheme. To date in 2009, expenditure on band 1 projects at primary level has amounted to €19.38m and at post-primary level expenditure on band 1 projects has amounted to €13.29m.  In 2008, my Department spent €230.65m on major primary projects of which €118.34m was on projects completed in 2008 which had a band 1 rating. In 2008, my Department spent €81.73m on major post-primary projects of which €4.2m was on projects completed in 2008 which had a band 1 rating.

2895	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	30	 Does the Minister of State accept that while some farmers made profits that could be described as super-normal in recent years, when historically high prices were being paid for milk, the vast majority of them reinvested those moneys in their farm holdings?  Does he agree that the lowest price being garnered in the market at the moment — 20 cent per litre — is completely unsustainable for dairy farmers with small and medium-sized holdings?  I take the point the Minister of State made about export refunds.  I welcome the extension of the aid to private storage scheme.   Is the case in aid scheme in operation at present?  What kind of take-up is it enjoying?  Is the efficacy of the calf replacer scheme being analysed at present?  As part of the overall process of increasing market supports through the EU, will the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food examine the relationship between producers, retailers and the co-operative movement?  It seems to me that the relationship is unbalanced — it is not based on equity.  Perhaps the Minister and his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, should consider introducing legislation on fair trade practices.  We need to ensure the multiples act fairly when they designate a price to the primary producer, especially as the primary producer is a price taker.
2896	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	32	 I respectfully suggest that this is not necessarily a short-term blip.  This is potentially a structural change in the market.  Nobody, up to the EU Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner herself, can foresee what will happen in the market in the future.  Will the Government consider other means of ensuring that primary producers of all hues are guaranteed some kind of fair market price for their produce in the retail multiple sector?  I refer to the introduction of fair trade legislation, for example, or the appointment of a retail regulator.  Such measures should be introduced as part of a package that includes the market mechanisms being implemented by the Commission.
2897	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	54	 Without meaning to sound facetious, the Minister of State could have dealt with this point when answering Question No. 28.  However, this is a question of marketing negotiating power.

2900	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	64	 The Commissioner has outlined a number of points which are aspirational and laudable in their own way.  For Irish agribusiness to flourish there needs to be a fundamental shift in the position vis-à-vis the retailer and the primary producer and processor.  This has been already outlined in great detail.  Rather than waiting for report after report, will the Government not grab the bull by the horns, take the initiative and implement legislation?  It should stop waiting for the European Union’s guidance on every matter relating to the agribusiness sector in this economy.  We have a very viable market, with the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, at the forefront given that he has responsibility for food.  We need to see action now and that relationship needs to be reinstated.  This House has the power to implement its own rules and regulations vis-à-vis the relationship, as it does not contravene EU rules.  I ask the Minister of State to act urgently to reinstate that relationship.
2901	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	74	 The model to which the Minister of State aspires is the French model whereby one goes to the Carrefour for one's larger cheaper products and to the boulangerie for one's baguette and so on.  The problem with the Irish model is that there is absolutely no transparency vis-á-vis profits.  A lack of transparency vis-á-vis the profits of the larger multiples affects the relationship between the product, primary supplier and the retailer, thus allowing situations as that described by the Minister of State.  Until we get that transparency we will not get a better deal for the primary producer resulting in a loss of jobs in this economy.  We are already seeing this in the Border counties.  Members are aware of what happened with Tesco.
2902	SeanSherlock	Labour	13355.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	76	 I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, but an ombudsman will not be enough to rectify the problem.  This will require a legislative framework such as fair trade legislation.  That is the only way we will be able to guarantee jobs and smaller producers some degree of livelihood.

Will the Minister of State set out the reason or logic for excluding these farmers who were new entrants having only acquired quota after 1 April and will he state whether it is possible the Minister will reconsider his decision?

2913	SeanSherlock	Labour	13358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	16	" In yesterday's edition of the Irish Examiner, the Limerick State solicitor welcomed the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill but said that it would face difficulties.  When asked whether the new law represented a good day’s work, he replied: It remains to be seen, but it is an attempt to address a very serious problem.  And I have no doubt it will be challenged, and I have no doubt there will be difficulties ahead for this legislation.  But something has ... to be done and we just can't roll over and let these people take over our city and our country. He went on to state ""the contract is being rewritten by the State on its terms, and I think rightly so"". I completely agree with the sentiments expressed by the State solicitor and everyone wants this matter to be dealt with.  The Labour Party differs on this legislation, not on the sentiments regarding the need to tackle organised crime, but on whether the proposal before the House presents a solution to get society out of the morass in which it finds itself.  One's natural instinct is to ensure that every innocent victim will get justice.  One's human instinct is that the only way to handle these criminals is with a short, sharp shock.  The question remains, however, of whether the proposal before us will result in a crack down on organised crime or in legal challenges to the legislation on a number of fronts.  That question is not ideological, it is practical.  Will this legislation assist in the pursuit of criminals in Limerick and west Dublin or will it be challenged by their legal representatives at every turn?  Are we making good law or law that will be challenged due to loopholes? In the Criminal Justice Act 2006, there is already a considerable body of law that should adequately deal with organised crime.  I do not understand why the Government is hell-bent on swamping us with more law, common sense must prevail.  We all want to see these criminals behind bars, and no one in this House would advocate a soft approach that would not see the blight of organised criminal activity wiped out once and for all, but we differ on how this can best be achieved.  It cannot be achieved only through increased legislation, the dogs in the street will tell the Minister that the shortage of resources for the gardaí at the coalface is the most significant impediment to progress in bringing criminals to trial. The idea that we apply more legislation without a comprehensive spend on overtime, surveillance and other enabling mechanisms that would allow gardaí to get on with the job raises serious questions about this Government's strategy to tackle gangland crime.  If common sense was used, the gardaí would have all of the necessary intelligence gathering and surveillance mechanisms at their disposal to hinder any attempt at a crime.  The fact remains that the cutting of overtime for gardaí and the likelihood that there will be a massive cull of more experienced gardaí near the end of their tenure due to the possible taxation of pension lump sums will further exacerbate the situation.  We can have all the law we want but if the experience does not exist in the Garda Síochána to break down these criminal elements, it is all for nothing.  Laws such as that proposed today will matter not one jot if the resources to match are not in place. The first thing that strikes me is that there has been very little change to the definition of a criminal organisation from the 2006 Act except to include a requirement that two of the gang can be involved with a view to act in concert in the commission of an offence.  Has anyone been convicted under section 72 of the 2006 Act that makes it an offence for a person to participate in or contribute to any activity of such an organisation? It is a distraction to introduce a new offence under section 71(a) of directing the activities of a criminal organisation if it has not been possible to prove that a person is a member of a gang.  To introduce a provision to establish the requisite intent is a gimmick.  The new section 72(6) provides that it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that participation or contribution was made with the requisite state of mind if the circumstances under which the relevant act was committed involved the possession by the defendant in the presence of one or more other persons of a balaclava, boiler suit or other means of disguise.  I hope the plumbers and handymen of the country know that wearing a boiler suit is now proof of requisite criminal intent of membership of a criminal organisation. The Minister has argued this legislation is necessary to uphold the rule of law.  Instead, by introducing a system whereby instead of seeking out evidence and putting it before a jury, a garda's opinion will suffice to convict and this can be done before a court sitting without a jury.  Granted, this is not the first time the opinion of a garda has been used to replace the obligation to obtain evidence and allow a court to decide on guilt, the Offences Against the State Act 1972 provided that in prosecutions for membership of a paramilitary organisation, the evidence of a chief superintendent as to that membership could be admissible.  At least the fact that only a very senior garda could give such evidence gave an indication of the seriousness of the matter.  Now, however, a prosecution can rest on the opinion of any garda who has the appropriate expertise.  This is a meaningless criterion because it is difficult to envisage a court refusing to hear the opinion evidence of a trained member of the Garda Síochána on the basis that he or she does not know enough about gangs. The garda's opinion can be based on the fact that the individual in question has previous convictions.  Again, the Minister has already asked us to support the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which will allow gardaí to plant listening devices where there is a suspicion of any arrestable offence.  I have no issue with this.  The stated purpose of that legislation is to obtain evidence with which to pursue gangland crimes but now we find we are not even going to rely on such evidence and instead all we will require is the opinion of a garda.  The Minister stated that such evidence will not go to the guilt of the person in question but there must be a further clarification on that point. Section 71 onwards deals with the Special Criminal Court, the main issue here.  If the perceived problem is that witnesses are afraid to give evidence, and we distinguish between witnesses and those who are members of a jury, surely the Minister should be looking at greater support for witnesses?  Any Bill that states that ""it is hereby declared that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to an offence under each of the following provisions"" conveys the impression that the current legal remedies are inadequate and must be overhauled.  Are we in a de facto state of emergency?  The Minister in this legislation expressly states that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with criminal organisations.  That is a serious contention that goes to the heart of the common law system and must be further analysed.  No evidence has been presented to demonstrate why the current operation of the courts is inadequate.  The provision in section 8 amends the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to allow certain offences to be tried at the non-jury Special Criminal Court, including the offence of directing a criminal organisation, participation in or contribution to certain activities, and the commission of an offence for a criminal organisation.  We acknowledge the role of the Special Criminal Court in that context and its powers have been extended in this regard. The protection of jury members and witnesses has been suggested as the reason for extending the remit of the Special Criminal Court.  However, as recently as last month, speaking at the annual prosecutors' conference, the Director of Public Prosecutions raised an important point about the participation of the ordinary citizen in the criminal justice system through service on juries.  This, he said, ""imports a degree of democratic legitimacy into the system"".  This is a point that is worth bearing in mind.  One can infer from this statement that it is in question whether the reality of the DPP referring a case to the Special Criminal Court will actually play out, given the potential doubt as to whether this legislation will stand on its own two feet and withstand any legal challenge down the line. The issue of witness intimidation will not be solved simply by the use of the Special Criminal Court, as witnesses will still need to give evidence in court.  The common sense point of view is that witness protection should be dealt with by instigating measures designed to protect witnesses' identities, if necessary, in addition to Garda protection operations.  This is a more rational approach. The decision on whether to prosecute a case in the Special Criminal Court comes down to one law officer, the DPP.  The existence of total discretion on his or her part as to whether to prosecute and to prosecute in the Special Criminal Court or otherwise is a significant power and must be exercised with great caution.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended to put this power on a statutory footing.  That would be a reasonable approach.  Could we not instead enact a provision within that section along the lines of the UK practice whereby the prosecution may apply for a non-jury trial in cases in which it can show evidence of a real danger of jury tampering?  This would ensure a robust response where there is proof of jury tampering.  The question for this Legislature is whether the provision is a new departure from the norm compared to other common law jurisdictions.  At what point should we depart from a principle enshrined in our Constitution for the pursuance of a goal that can be achieved by means other than fundamentally changing the basis of a criminal trial, namely the right to trial by jury?  The Minister should think long and hard about this provision. I put it to the Minister that the provisions contained within existing legislation should be adequate to deal with the fundamental premise of this Bill; namely, the eradication of organised crime.  There is some presumption that the new provisions are based on the threat posed by criminal gangs.  It conveys an impression that the people engaged in such criminal activity possess a malevolent influence that is beyond the powers of normal court procedures to pursue.  I do not buy into this.  It presumes that we in this House — representatives of the people — no longer have the confidence to curb criminal activity within the normal legal parameters and must embark on some pretence at emergency provisions to placate certain viewpoints. We have developed a new language and rhetoric with regard to organised crime and it needs to be deconstructed.  These people are mere individuals.  They do not live in locations that are beyond the powers of surveillance.  The High Chaparral in Limerick is not a remote location.  People can be photographed and tracked and their movements can be traced.  They are not possessed of special powers and the existing judicial system and corpus of law, coupled with the provision of adequate Garda resources, should be robust enough to bring them to justice. I wonder whether terms such as ""organised crime"" would ever have crept into our lexicon and would need to be legislated for if the State had provided adequate funding for Garda operations such as Anvil, which allowed the development of surveillance and checkpoints and acted as a thorn in the side of criminals.  The ability of the Garda to tackle crime is severely hampered by a cut in Garda overtime from approximately €120 million last year to €80 million this year.  A total of €21 million has been set aside this year for Operation Anvil, yet the State is spending approximately €12 million on policing north Mayo.  Does the Minister not see an inherent contradiction in his own policy in this regard? I doubt if one extra gangland boss or minion will be brought to justice as a result of the measures contained within the Bill.  We do not argue against any provision that addresses the increasing levels of violence and intimidation directed at witnesses and juries, or the use of the Special Criminal Court for the hearing of particular organised crime offences, but I would like to see some proof of the fact that juries are systematically being intimidated.  Does it really happen?"
2914	SeanSherlock	Labour	13358.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	18	 It is one thing to suggest that witnesses are being intimidated, but the suggestion that juries are being systematically intimidated and that this requires a seismic shift away from trial by jury should not be entertained without further analysis.  That a country of this size, which is not densely populated, must resort to such measures suggests that the successful tackling of crime should be predicated on the application of resources and not necessarily on a fundamental change in the law.  If there is proof beyond doubt that juries are being tampered with and intimidated, there are protective instruments that can be applied which are practical and based on a common sense approach.  These are well documented. Under section 7 of the Bill, the opinion of any garda who appears to the court to possess the appropriate expertise will be admissible as evidence of the existence of a criminal organisation.  Under this section, expertise means experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties drafted a paper prior to the instigation of this legislation from which I will quote.  I do not necessarily agree with all the views espoused by the various civil society organisations and I have my own view about the rule of law.  However, there are certain points of law addressed by the ICCL which should be read into the record.  It points out that the opinion of the garda can be informed by the existence of previous convictions of the accused.  The Supreme Court has considered the use of belief evidence and its compatibility with Article 38 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the right to a fair trial. While a garda may claim privilege as to his or her sources when being cross-examined about belief evidence, the Supreme Court is clear that a conviction cannot take place without supportive or corroborative evidence in recognition of the disadvantage that accrues to the defence in a trial.  Moreover, in regard to the rank of garda who is entitled to provide belief evidence, the court has stated that the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 were carefully crafted to ensure belief evidence must come from an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent.  This, the Supreme Court stated, was with a view to establishing trust and credibility as far as possible.  This must be borne in mind in regard to the provisions contained within this Bill.  The UN human rights committee has referred to decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions in assigning cases to the courts not being made public.  To confer further powers on the Director of Public Prosecutions for the hearing of particular organised crime offences in the Special Criminal Court on the basis of his or her total discretion begs the question as to whether the application of increased Garda resources might be a more reasonable solution to the problem which would negate the need for these provisions. On the matter of secret detention hearings, under Part 4 of the Bill, procedures of District Court detention hearings for the purposes of extending the detention of persons under the Offences Against the State Act are altered.  One legal opinion suggests it is contrary to the principles of fair trial that the Bill allows for the hearing to take place in private if the judge considers there may be a risk of prejudice.  In justifying this, it is claimed that members of organised criminal gangs are attending the detention hearings and deciphering the direction of the investigation from the evidence given in court.  However, this provision fundamentally alters the nature of criminal justice in this State, allowing for the judge to hear evidence from a garda of any rank, in private and without legal representation.  This includes answers to questions and a cross-examination without either the defendant, his or her legal representatives or the prosecutor present.  In essence, this means a person can be held without knowledge of the grounds on which the judge is justifying his or her continued detention.  That detention can be justified by secret information from any member of the Garda Síochána, irrespective of his or her expertise or experience.  Regardless of whether or not we are convinced of the necessity for such provisions, the reality is that any criminal lawyer worth his or her salt will most likely be able to identify any number of potential loopholes and, thus, the prospect of a legal challenge. We must also look at our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even where we are seeking to make provision for heinous crimes such as murder, our obligations under the convention remain clear.  We must avoid a situation where a person detained on a murder charge ultimately walks free as a consequence of a challenge to this law under an Article 40 provision.  It does not matter whether or not we are in favour of waiving Article 40 rights in emergency situations.  My point is that we must avoid making bad law or law that will be discovered by a good criminal lawyer to have all types of loopholes.  That is how the State has typically dealt with issues relating to criminality heretofore.  Criminal lawyers have always been able to find loopholes that have allowed people to walk free in certain circumstances.  If we are to tackle this problem once and for all, we must make robust and effective law that will not be subjected to future challenge at a supranational court, as Deputy Charles Flanagan observed. We intend to propose several amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  Practical changes can be made that will not alter the Minister's modus operandi in seeking to tackle organised crime.  In particular, we must ensure there is protection for witnesses and that jury tampering does not take place.  I understand the courts in the United Kingdom have found that the state is obliged to take particular steps to protect certain vulnerable categories of people such as witnesses.  We are not so naive as to suggest there is an onus on the State to prevent every possibility of violence, but where individuals are exposed to threats to their lives, the State will, in certain circumstances, be obliged to provide police protection.  In order to fulfil these obligations, we must ensure effective measures are taken to thwart attempts to trace witnesses and collaborators of justice by criminal organisations.  Several procedures can be put in place to ensure juries are not tampered with and that witnesses are afforded adequate protections.  These must be brought forward as practical measures in line with the implementation of this legislation. Any procedural rules that are enacted to protect the rights of witnesses must be formulated taking into account the need to safeguard the criminal trial process.  Measures which could be made available to assist witnesses include anonymity before, during and after the criminal trial.  However, this should be an exceptional measure and should be set down in law so that procedures are available for the defence to challenge the need for anonymity. A cause of concern in the criminal justice system is the considerable delay in court proceedings in the State.  If court proceedings could be expedited in a timely fashion, this would offset the risk of any potential tampering with juries.  We should not set about fundamentally changing our common law system when we could instead tackle criminals with robust measures through adequately funded and effective policing mechanisms.  While we agree with the tenor of the Bill in terms of what it seeks to achieve, we are of the view that it requires amendment.

2928	SeanSherlock	Labour	13362.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	270	 The Minister indicated that the amended definitions are merely a simpler formulation but that they will nonetheless make it easier to charge persons with the offences in question.  The Bill does not substantially change the definition of what constitutes a criminal organisation which is contained in the 2006 Act.  If it was never deemed practicable to bring the 2006 definition into play and if no convictions were secured on the basis of it, we must ask whether convictions can be secured on the basis of that which is contained in the legislation before the House. Is there a requirement that sufficient evidence to be provided to allow a judge, of the Special Criminal Court or any other court, to decide to convict someone on the basis of his or her membership of an organisation?  This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the provision in the 2006 Act has not been implemented.  Further consideration must be given to this matter.  I am of the view that section 3 is not practical.  It is so vague that if one were a criminal lawyer of some standing, one could pick holes in it.

2933	SeanSherlock	Labour	13362.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	437	" I was prompted to raise this issue in response to calls to my office and to Deputy Brian O'Shea's office with regard to the probable cessation of the rural bus service between Waterford and Cork.  This is a service which specifically serves the towns of Dungarvan, Cappoquin, Lismore, Curraglass, Ballynoe, Conna, Castlelyons, Fermoy, Castletownroche, Killavullen and Mallow.  There is a concern that if the mid-day service which is provided by Bus Éireann is stopped, because in the company's words it is deemed to be ""not profitable"", this will have an untold consequence for those people who are older, who do not have their own transport and who would normally use this service to access general day to day services such as medical, post office and other services that generally keep life and limb together. I am concerned because if it is the case that Bus Éireann decides to terminate this service, then in the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that the rural transport programme would be sufficiently funded to replace the route and provide the service to what I would call a vulnerable section or our society who do not have the means to provide their own transport and are not in a position to be able to get taxis if they are living in rural areas to the towns I have mentioned. We saw in 1967 that the railway line between Mallow and Dungarvan or Cork and Waterford through Mallow was stopped and it was replaced by a bus service.  I am arguing now, along with my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, that there would be a public service obligation to ensure that those people would continue to be served by some form of public transport and ideally through the auspices of Bus Éireann.  It is my view that if we are to go down the line in this country of stopping routes which are deemed to be not profitable, then it will be another nail in the coffin for rural society.  At a time when we are talking about the sustainability of the rural economy and rural society, it is vitally important that we would ensure that Bus Éireann and other providers would continue to have some obligation to provide services, particularly during the week when it is predominantly elderly people who avail of these services.  It is not only so that they can go into town to purchase groceries but it is also a form of social interaction for them they may not otherwise have without the service. If Government policy is one that assures that rural transport would be well catered for, particularly in more isolated areas, and if it is the case that Government policy is such that there is a service in existence, I call on the Minister to ensure that the service is maintained, preferably by Bus Éireann, but if not, that the Minister would intervene directly with Bus Éireann to ensure that it is maintained.  That will ensure that if we get rid of the railways we do not also get rid of the rural bus routes.  People use this service and it is vital that they have access to the services that maintain them in their everyday lives. I call on the Minister to intervene directly with Bus Éireann on this issue and ensure we maintain that service and other such services that are being threatened.  Bus Éireann is undergoing a process of reviewing its routes and those deemed to be not profitable could cease in the future.  That would be a bad day for rural society and the rural economy in particular."

If we pass the Lisbon treaty, we will say to our EU neighbours that we are on board and intend to proceed in partnership with them.  By passing it, we will say to our EU partners that we want to see the establishment of areas of co-operation or shared competences, particularly in respect of the internal market, energy and economic and social cohesion.  These are the areas on which we must focus if we are to be assisted in putting our economy back together and getting people back to work.  Without these areas of co-operation, we will be forced to proceed alone.  We cannot afford such a policy.  We rely, from this juncture, on our EU partners to assist us in getting back on track.  These provisions are built into the treaty and if we reject it for a second time, any assistance to be garnered from our EU partners will be nullified. We are a shrewd people and have built our country on the management of relationships, either socially, politically or from a business perspective.  Adopting the treaty will assist those relationships, particularly in the areas of foreign direct investment and EU research programmes, two areas that are vital to our economic growth and which are encompassed by the treaty.  I hope we can continue to play a qualitative role as a member of the European Union in this regard and that we can continue what has been a long and fruitful relationship.  I am grateful for our membership of the European Union because mine is the generation that has benefited most therefrom. Membership of the Union and protection of our national interests are not mutually exclusive.  In spite of the economic constraints upon us now, it will be through a deepened relationship with our EU partners that we will restore our economic vitality. At the EU Foreign Ministers meeting held after the last referendum, our Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke on the diverse nature of the Irish debate and the overlap in that debate between issues that were relevant to the treaty and others that were not.  Some of those extraneous issues, which have no part in the debate on treaty revision, have now been put to bed.  The guarantees are secured and we should acknowledge that. Our national interest is a strong Ireland within a strong European Union and one that is concerned with jobs, families and social solidarity.  The Union consists of 27 countries and 490 million people and I make no apologies for contending we should be part of an integrated union that challenges the hegemony of the United States, China and Russia. Our views in the Labour Party have been always tempered by a belief in social solidarity, as espoused in the European social model.  That model of social solidarity has come under attack from people such as our own Commissioner.  Those who argue in favour of the retention of a Commissioner should ask themselves if the incumbent Irish Commissioner has acted in the best interest of this country or propagated an agenda that is contrary to our largely social democratic principles.  I hope our next Commissioner will possess the egalitarian republican ideals once espoused by the Taoiseach.  I am glad to note we have retained our Commissioner nonetheless. The EU Commission, by its composition, has shifted to the right.  That provides clear evidence of the need for the Union to reform its structures.  The primacy of inter-institutionalism, that is, of an all-powerful Commission, must be challenged.  I am not espousing intergovernmentalism per say because there must be a finely tuned balance between the two.  The treaty provides such a compromise.  That balance, as contained within this treaty, is provided for by extending the decision-making powers of the European Parliament, an institution that reflects the wishes of the peoples of Europe. We, the peoples of Europe, must understand that the model underpinning the workings of the European Union has been dominated by those who have sought to de-regulate every aspect of our lives, especially within the realm of public services or services of general interest, as they are referred to in the treaty.  I am glad we have made progress on that matter and that these services are recognised within the treaty. We have seen the fruits of the Commission's labours — a European financial structure that is in tatters and an EU economy that is floundering.  This is unsustainable and unbalanced.  The way to redress the imbalance is to give more powers to the European Parliament.  This will shift the power back to the people, the same people who are currently unemployed and face an uncertain future and who are rightly suspicious of their Governments and want to see jobs and the economy put to the forefront of the political agenda.  The European Parliament will at least provide a counter-weight that will be more reflective of the wishes of the European peoples, even if it is dominated by the right.  The Parliament, by its nature, because it does not govern unilaterally, is closer to the people and will reflect their concerns.  It will ensure that job creation throughout Europe remains the first priority.  That is provided for within the treaty. The Lisbon treaty provides that the ""ordinary legislative procedure"" involves co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, with qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers.  This mechanism, by its nature, increases democratic control over legislation.  This concept, however, is not debated widely because there is still a serious deficit of knowledge among legislators and the public as to the general powers of the European Parliament.  Until every citizen has as much knowledge of how the Union works as they do of their local councils or even the Houses of the Oireachtas, treaty revisions will be dominated by issues such as those on which legal guarantees have been obtained and which form no part of the treaty. The fact remains that we still do not understand how the whole mechanism works.  Before I am accused of patronising anybody, I must state every single person to whom I spoke prior to the last referendum stated he or she did not understand the treaty or how it worked.  That is a fact.  How can I sell this treaty to anyone if the majority of us do not understand qualified majority voting or co-decision or know the difference between a directive, a regulation and a decision?  We must inculcate our fellow citizens with knowledge of the workings of the institutions in a positive way.  This must start in every school and from a young age.  Until such time as this is achieved, there always will be opportunities for Governments and self-interested groups to take advantage of people's lack of knowledge. There is still a dearth of knowledge.  It is not sufficient for the Government to suggest it has delivered the goods in terms of legal guarantees or solemn declarations.  There are many who were never exercised by these issues in the first instance.  Most were exercised by the fact that they did not know what was in the treaty.  There are many who were never exercised by these issues in the first instance. We, in this House, are to blame for this.  We have never set out to have a meaningful educational dialogue with our fellow citizens on the fundamentals of how the European Union works.  That is partly why the referendum fell the last time.  It could do so again unless we engage in a meaningful way with our fellow citizens."

The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in a number of classes therefore schools no longer qualify to retain the classes. My Department has considered a number of appeals from schools in relation to the loss of the classes.  Some schools have advised that they had enrolled children with a low incidence disability in classes intended for pupils with a mild general learning disability.  These children may qualify for individual resource teaching support through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and schools were advised that it is open to them to liaise with the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in this regard.

It warrants further discussion particularly on Committee Stage and it warrants further consideration by expert opinion before we decide its finality.  I oppose the guillotine of the Bill.
2946	SeanSherlock	Labour	13365.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	" The legislation is based on a challenge to section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940, which provides that where a debtor has an instalment plan to pay a debt and fails to discharge that obligation, the creditor may apply to the District Court for the arrest and imprisonment of the debtor. The Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, in its opinion, states the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill 2009 confines itself to remedying the constitutional deficiencies identified by the High Court in the McCann case and this is the most fundamental point.  Political and legal arguments were well made by my colleague, Senator Alex White, on the Bill in question and particular reference was made to the instigation of an attachment of earnings procedure when cases come before the courts for non-payment of debt.  I have made provision for this argument by way of proposed amendment to the Bill to reflect that view. We should also take cognisance of the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that the Department will await the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on debt enforcement before taking any further action in this area.  Will the Minister give a commitment to legislate for this and, in particular, that aspect of the Laffoy judgment on attachment of earnings?  The Law Reform Commission's report will be most welcome but if it does not give voice to legislation almost immediately then I suggest the inherent problems will continue. I acknowledge FLAC's comments in that regard and it should also be noted that its report, To No One's Credit, published on 6 July, proposes a wide range of recommendations for change in this area.  The FLAC position paper states: ""These are welcome changes to the existing legislation but it must be said that they only address the last step in what is a complex and less than user friendly procedure that takes place in open court and is in need of comprehensive reform generally.""  The report points out that while the Bill contains welcome changes necessitated by the McCann judgment, it does not go far enough in that it still contemplates imprisonment as a sanction for debtors.  Although it will improve the current position, it is akin to placing a sticking plaster on an open wound, namely, our shameful policy of continuing to imprison people who for genuine reasons cannot pay their debts as opposed to refusing to do so.  We must make the distinction between those who cannot and those who simply will not pay their debts. FLAC suggests that the State moves towards the removal of imprisonment as an option in debt cases and instead employs effective non-penal remedies to enforce compliance with civil debt judgments.  I hope the Law Reform Commission would give greater voice to this aspiration.  There is merit to this argument but the complete removal of the sanction of prison is not a vista that we would support at present, particularly with regard to family law matters. In introducing the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister of State said: The High Court found that the existing legislation lacked a number of necessary safeguards in circumstances where a person is at risk of imprisonment.  The judgment stated that, while this process had traditionally been regarded as a civil matter, its effect was akin to a criminal one and the debtor was entitled to similar protections.  There was particular concern that the 1940 Act did not appear to require a person to be heard by a court before being imprisoned.  Following a default on an instalment order made by the District Court, a creditor could apply to the court for a committal order and even in the case of the non-appearance of a debtor, committal orders could be, and were, granted by the District Court. The new section 6 addresses this and we will not seek to amend it in that regard.  I believe we must give voice to the McCann judgment and deal with it immediately.  However, whether the legislation deals with the Laffoy judgment in its entirety is another matter. In the debate in the Seanad, my colleague rightly asked how a debtor could be imprisoned without any requirement that the District Court would first have to decide whether the non-payment was due to an inability to pay or a refusal to pay.  This seems a fundamental point, but it was not an area of the law with which many of us were familiar until the judgment was made in this case.  The judgment probably surprised people in that it deemed the area unconstitutional, which necessitated legislation.  I could not understand how it could be justified as a law.  It seemed to require a change.  It seems basic that fair procedures should be available for a hearing before the courts dealing with the possible imprisonment of a debtor. The Labour Party acknowledges this is serious legislation, as it involves the potential imprisonment of people for non-payment of debt.  We also acknowledge that serious issues were raised in the judgment of Laffoy in the McCann case.  We need to discuss those issues in greater detail.  The question for the House is whether this legislation is drafted to take cognisance of the difference between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay and whether the application of criminal procedures against debtors who fail to discharge their debts is reasonable. The fact that the imprisonment order made against Ms McCann would have been carried out if she had not taken the action shows that a person could be deprived of his or her freedom, regardless of whether he or she was deliberately flouting the law or could not simply pay their debts.  In that case, the respondents had informed the court that they would vary the instalments, but that the debt would still stand.  This was widely reported in the media at the time and The Irish Times of  27 June stated that Judge Neilan said he would remand all committal and many enforcement matters to the end of November, when it might be clear if the Laffoy decision would be appealed to the Supreme Court or if legislators would take action.  We are taking action today, but it still remains unclear whether the Government has adequately dealt with the Laffoy judgment as it pertains to attachment of earnings procedures. The question remains as to whether we should vote against the Bill on the basis that the findings within the Laffoy judgment are not implemented in their entirety in this legislation or whether we should revert to the 1940 Act.  I suggest we should not revert to the 1940 Act but that a response is required.  I feel the response is delivered in the legislation, although the Labour Party still finds the legislation somewhat flawed.  It remains to be seen whether the lack of a provision in this regard will be challenged once the Bill is passed. We must legislate to ensure that maintenance orders are enforced and upheld and ensure that the threat and potential for imprisonment remain.  On the enforcement of maintenance orders, the current situation in this regard is unclear in light of the McCann judgment and until the implementation of this legislation.  District Court clerks must maintain those orders, but the situation as to their standing is unclear.  Is there an issue with regard to time constraints, from the time of the McCann judgment up to the implementation of this legislation?  People seeking maintenance through maintenance orders wonder whether they will be affected adversely and whether the orders will be enforced.  They want to know what direction the Minister will give to the Attorney General with regard to advice to court clerks on the matter of what they should do next about those orders once the legislation is passed.  There is significant confusion and concern in this regard. I understand that in one area in the west up to 200 maintenance orders have been put in abeyance as a result of the lack of implementation of the legislation.  Will the Minister address that in his response?  I may be missing the point, but if Judge Neilan made a judgment he would not do anything until such time as the legislation was passed, we need to find out exactly what the effect the passing of the legislation will have on the issuing of maintenance orders.  We must legislate to ensure that maintenance orders are enforced and that the Minister maintains the potential threat of imprisonment where they are not paid. The attachment of earnings procedure could still be incorporated in the Bill.  The changes in the Bill will, in some circumstances, put an end to the sentence of imprisonment of a debtor in his her absence and alter the onus of proof in these cases so that it is now for the creditor to establish that the debtor's failure to pay instalments was either due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  This is as suggested by FLAC.  This shifts the balance away from the debtor to the creditor but allows for the possibility for the creditor to reclaim the debt or part of it.  This concept, however, gives rise to some difficulty for the Labour Party.  We seek to amend the legislation to reflect the fact that in her judgment Judge Laffoy spoke specifically about the issue of attachment of earnings procedures. The Minister of State in his response to the Fine Gael amendment moved in the Seanad stated that the question of attachments of earnings — the substantive basis of the amendment — and of the whole area of attachments of earnings to social welfare payments had been considered by the Government, both in this Bill and in the Fines Bill.  The conclusion, however, was that it would be problematic and difficult to operate fairly.  The amendment also acknowledged that it would be necessary to include attachments to social welfare payments, but that this might not be the best time to try to do that.  There would also be practical difficulties that would need to be overcome where persons in temporary employment were concerned. I question the logic of such an approach.  If the Law Reform Commission is going to consider the issue of debt and seek solutions by way of legislation, we must consider the range of options available.  I contend the attachment of earnings procedure is one such option.  This already operates within the family law system and I see no reason that it cannot operate within other areas of civil debt.  In the Seanad the Minister of State said the attachment of earnings procedure presented a difficulty.  If the difficulty is due to the cost factor or if it is an administrative difficulty, what is the logic of his argument?  If the ultimate aim is to keep people out of prison, the cost of administration of such a scheme would be far less than the cost of imprisonment.  There is logic in considering the attachment of earnings procedure and including it in the legislation.  That would be the way to go.  The Minister of State said people had been imprisoned for not adhering to maintenance orders, but with regard to civil debt, one could instigate such procedures. Senator Bacik, when speaking in the Seanad and addressing the Fine Gael amendment said it is eminently sensible since it proposes a different regime as an alternative to the sanction of imprisonment being imposed upon a debtor, and rather than imprisonment, it envisages an attachment of income or welfare order that would be made to address circumstances where somebody is unable or unwilling to pay debts. We agree with this approach and have tabled amendments to that effect.  We still need to go back to the judgment of Ms Justice Laffoy, who refers to Article 11 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It states: ""No one shall be imprisoned merely because of their inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.""  The principle in international law that people should not be imprisoned merely because of their inability to fulfil a contractual obligation is clear and we are in breach of it. Although there are improvements to the current situation in this Bill, which were necessitated by the McCann judgment, the fundamental principle upon which the current system is premised, namely, that people can be imprisoned for non-payment of debt remains in place.  What was the point of imprisoning Ms McCann?  It is fair to assume that the vast majority of those before the courts are people with little or no means or without the necessary life skills, in some instances, to manage household income. The idea that someone would be subjected to a committal order without having engaged in any process before a judge speaks volumes about the arcane, archaic and outmoded and borrowed common law procedures which form part of this system.  Even when someone receives documentation regarding the discharging of a debt, the chances are that they are intimidated by a language that is far from simple and is typical of a bygone age.  I am glad this is being dealt with in the Bill. The State must immediately begin the process of changing the arcane procedures regarding the discharging of debt.  It is one thing for us to change the legislation, but the question then arises as to when the section 6 provisions will kick in and whether we will see a revolution in the courts regarding their arcane procedures and the type of language they use, and whether they will change overnight.  I suggest they will not and that many people who present themselves to the courts will be as confused as ever.  Until we develop a language for the law that reflects modernity — if I can use that word — we will still have situations like the McCann case."
2947	SeanSherlock	Labour	13365.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	450	 We still await the Law Reform Commission's paper in that regard and hope it will lead to the overhaul of the system. We need to strike a balance between the rights of the debtor before the court and the rights of the creditor to obtain payment.  The Minister stated there were 4,300 applications for enforcement orders to the District Court and that 186 people were imprisoned so far this year.  There is no doubt that figure will rise.  When one takes into account those in prison for non-payment of fines, we have more trouble than is worth it inside our prisons, where people are there for civil rather than criminal issues.  It is something that needs to be addressed. This brings me back to FLAC.  Why not look seriously at the proposal launched on Monday called To No One's Credit and engage on those issues in a meaningful way?  I suggest the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has its face set against any idea that seeks to look more laterally at the issue.  The fact remains that since Adam was a boy people have reneged on their debts and no government, no matter how well-intentioned, will be able to legislate for human behaviour.  I suggest a little bit of common sense and the accommodation of new ideas would be the way to go.  We can no longer afford the notion that people would be jailed for debt where it is proven that they genuinely cannot pay. Ms Justice Laffoy, on page 82 of the judgment, states that the application of elements of the test to section 6 illustrates that it is disproportionate interference with the constitutionally protected right to liberty because the objective of imprisoning a debtor for failure to comply with an instalment order is to procure the discharge of arrears of instalments.  She refers specifically to a statutory procedure under which a debtor who is unable to discharge the arrears is imprisoned because of the absence therein of procedures, including procedures which give effect to the debtor's right to fair procedures under the Constitution, which ensures that the judge ascertains that the debtor is unable to discharge the arrears, cannot be said to be rationally connected with the objective.  This speaks to points we made on the attachment of earnings procedures.  She states such a procedure is arbitrary, unfair and not based on rational considerations, and is an unreasonable and unnecessary interference with the debtor's right to personal liberty. The question is whether this aspect of her judgment has been remedied by the new section 6.  I am a layman; I am not solicitor, as are my two learned colleagues, but perhaps the Minister could respond and let us know whether that aspect of her judgment has been remedied.  Could the statutory scheme she refers to be applied by way of an attachment of earnings procedure?  She states that in circumstances where a debtor has some resources to meet a debt, a statutory scheme which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources does not impair the debtor's right to liberty as little as possible.  We wish to speak to that issue by way of the amendments we have tabled. Ultimately, the question for us is whether we need to amend the legislation to give voice to Ms. Justice Laffoy's judgment so as to offset the risk that the Bill may be struck down again on foot of a legal challenge in these strange times.  Where we guillotine at will, we risk the prospect of a challenge when the space for proper debate is curbed.  Proper space and time has not been allocated for debate on this matter.  It should be stated, for historical purposes, that guillotining legislation such as this does the Legislature no good.  I often think that when we legislate in haste, it may come back to haunt us. We welcome section 6.  It will get the Minister over the hump, so to speak, regarding the McCann judgment, but there are other issues which need to be addressed.  If we had more time and debate, a greater allowance for amendments and more expert opinion on this matter, perhaps we could have addressed it more fruitfully.

My party would agree with the principle of attachment of earnings being added to this legislation for obvious reasons.  It would provide a way towards off-setting the risk against imprisonment.  It would set in place a clearly defined procedure within the legislation on which there could be no doubt afterwards.  On that basis, we would support the principle of attachment of earnings as used in maintenance orders, which could be extended here.  It would address the Laffoy judgment also.

2967	SeanSherlock	Labour	13454.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	400	 I wish to share time with Deputies Mary Upton, Ruairí Quinn, Kathleen Lynch and Jan O'Sullivan. The recent scandals at FÁS have taken the organisation to such new lows that its name alone evokes any number of negative connotations.  Its unfortunate association with the Fianna Fáil Party has cast a further shadow over its reputation.  Whether one argues that this patronage is real or perceived, it is now time to end the era of the nod and the wink and sever the long association with the Fianna Fáil movement.  It is time to break this unofficial link and rebuild the organisation so that FÁS can re-ignite a sense of trust in those who avail of its services.  Let us be sure that people will from now on be 100% confident that FÁS is apolitical in its approach to everything it does.  We must strive to bring FÁS back from the brink and excise from its employment anyone who is being carried unnecessarily.  Its upper echelons have tarnished the authority's standing in the public eye.  The reasons for this are well documented and have been covered extensively by my colleague, Deputy Shortall. However, we must be mindful of the fact that there is much to praise in FÁS.  The Labour Party is determined to assist in the restoration of its reputation.  It is important to acknowledge the good work that currently goes on in FÁS, which has a network of 66 regional offices and 20 training centres across the country.  The majority of its work is carried out at a grass-roots level through the hard work of its training and education supervisors, employment scheme participants, business advisers and recruitment specialists.  It has specifically catered for the marginalised in our society.  Through initiatives aimed at people with disabilities and members of the Traveller community, FÁS has always sought to empower and include all citizens of our country at a grass-roots level.  Its wider horizons initiative aims at increasing understanding among young people north and south of the Border, reconciling the two traditions while increasing work skills for every participant.  At ground level, the work carried out by FÁS helps people from all walks of life to find jobs and obtain training, and promotes work throughout our communities.  We must not ignore this. My experience of FÁS at a local level has been positive, and it would be unfair to associate the local workers with the shenanigans of those within the hierarchy.  What these people on the ground represent is far removed from what the hierarchy has come to embody.  Where it represented neglect, the work of those on the ground is characterised by a sense of duty and obligation to the people they were supervising through the community employment schemes and in the various offices throughout the 66 centres.  Where waste is widespread among a minority at the upper level, the majority have come to represent a significant investment in our communities.  This cannot be overlooked in our efforts to reform the organisation.  FÁS has given hope to many in terms of their own personal circumstances and those of their neighbourhoods.  I am representative of a largely rural constituency and I have seen first hand the benefits yielded by the community schemes, spearheaded by FÁS and managed by local people working within those communities. As with all State-funded bodies, cutbacks have affected the services offered to people in both rural and urban communities.  The idea that the waste at the top level of FÁS ran parallel with the reduction of valuable services to communities has angered the public and the body politic alike.  We have every right to be angry but we must differentiate between the person in the board room and the worker on the street.  Our anger must be channelled appropriately.  This anger laments the fact that this fine institution should have become a vessel for such waste when it has been a force for good.  I believe it can be a force for good again, but we must bring about the necessary changes.

2970	SeanSherlock	Labour	13455.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	193	" That we are only now transposing a directive which was agreed in 2006 is typical of the manner in which the Government has been remiss in its obligations vis-à-vis the transposition of EU directives in general.  Ireland is behind the curve again because our European counterparts, in some instances, are already preparing to undertake a review of the directive that we have yet to transpose. This House, for the first time, will bring about legislation specifically charged with the retention of communications data.  This legislation is so flawed that it will have to be completely rewritten if the Labour Party is to support it.  It is bad for business, too costly to implement, undemocratic and the oversight provisions are too weak.  I hope it will be significantly amended to make it more realistic and not the sham we have before us. The reason for Ireland's delay in following our EU counterparts in introducing such a Bill is well documented.  An attempt by previous Administrations to exclude the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice delayed the adoption of the directive here.  Thankfully, with the exception of Slovakia, the overzealous and restrictive measures favoured by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, curried little favour in Europe.  This directive was seen as the lesser of two evils by the Party of European Socialists in the European Parliament, in 2004-05.  This is where we differ with the Minister's interpretation in terms of the historical perspective of the directive. Following the Madrid bombing in 2005 the Irish, British and two other governments came forward with proposals for a third pillar intergovernmental decision on data retention.  Such a measure would have been adopted by the Justice Council with consultation rights only for the European Parliament and no oversight role for the European Court of Justice afterwards.  This course of action was opposed by the Commission and the European Parliament, largely on the grounds that such a measure should be approved by the European Parliament.  The Commission then issued a proposal for a draft directive in September 2005 and the socialist group negotiated amendments in the European Parliament and adopted it December. One of those amendments concerned a full review of the measure in September 2010.  My colleague in the European Parliament, Mr. Proinsias de Rossa, MEP, voted in favour of the compromise and the four Fianna Fáil MEPs at that time abstained.  The directive was approved by the Council in 2006 and was to have been transposed into Irish law by September 2007.  However, the then Minister, Mr. McDowell, took a case to the European Court of Justice, arguing that the Council had no authority to adopt the directive and that only a third pillar initiative was permitted.  The Government refused to transpose the directive while this case was ongoing.  In response the European Commission began legal proceedings over Ireland's failure to transpose.  Last February the European Court of Justice rejected the Government's argument and upheld the directive. My understanding is that civil liberties groups did not have an opinion about the four countries' initiative in 2005, but had written in opposition to the draft directive.  If there were no directive, it could be argued, it is likely that the four countries' initiative would have been adopted.  In that context there are two views that can be taken on the directive, and consequently this Bill.  One is that we transpose and thereby pass the Bill into law without question and accept it as a fait accompli.  The second is that we seek to amend the Bill and ground it in reality by addressing the cost of its implementation for businesses and the issue of oversight.  The Labour Party takes the view that there are circumstances in which data retention is needed and useful.  However, there are some many flaws in the proposed legislation that it would have to be considerably amended before we could be satisfied with its passing into law.  If we take the historical perspective and the context in the which the directive was fashioned, then we must speak of the Madrid bombings and the Omagh atrocity, which occurred prior to the instigation of the directive.  However, much water has passed under the bridge and the need to transpose and legislate remains.  We have an obligation in that respect. It could be argued that this legislation has been superseded in some respects by the surveillance Bill in its use as a crime prevention measure.  Whether this Bill is a complement to recently adopted legislation is open to question.  Generally speaking, the provisions within the Bill must be such that they are only allowed in clearly prescribed circumstances and we must guard against any nefarious use of the Act when it comes into force.  The provisions must be subject to democratic review.  They must also be subject to proper judicial review. A criticism of the Bill relates to its timing.  I have already stated that we are behind the curve and Ireland should now be preparing for the 2010 review of the directive.  It should also be pointed out that the European Court of Justice will now be bound by the data protection article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights because of Lisbon.  If there are claims from any quarter that this represents excessive interference from Brussels, it would be my view that Mr. McDowell's alternative was far more draconian and that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats arrangement originally sought to extend this measure to the entire EU.  If one argues this Bill from the civil libertarian perspective, then I respectfully suggest that the only alternative was Fianna Fáil's original proposal.  It is better that, rather than having ""an intergovernmental measure"", we have a ""Community measure"" that gives a voice to the European parliament, and gives the European Court of Justice a meaningful role. Concerns have previously arisen as to the nature and specifically the volume of requests made for retained data.  Previously, Deputy Brendan Howlin highlighted how, in 2006, there were 10,000 Garda requests for access to personal telephone records under powers arising from the amendment to the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act.  This amounts to almost 30 requests for every day in 2006, and it is evident that a review of the practice has been long required.  That we are finally to address this directive with a Bill is positive but it is not without its perils. The Labour Party fully supports data retention but only for specific circumstances.  With these powers, there is a responsibility, and it is our hope that through the legislative process we will address some of the ambiguities and issues arising from what has been presented in the Bill.  I am concerned with the provisions in the Bill in regard to the timeframe within which data will be retained by service providers.  There are concerns also in regard to costs undertaken by those service providers to adhere to such a provision.  It is our considered view that the minimum period of six months may be sufficient.  However, we will take this under advisement and speak about this on Committee Stage.  I fear that if the maximum allowable retention period will be two years, then we will open this process to an abuse and the cost to business will reduce competitiveness and will ultimately affect the consumer. I fail to see how 10,000 requests per annum could possibly be pertinent to a serious crime investigation.  Further, the lack of a role for the Garda Ombudsman is of itself a cause for concern.  Where an officer of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is investigating a complaint against a Garda that may involve a criminal offence, the officer of the commission has all the powers, immunities and privileges of a member of the Garda Síochána.  This includes common law powers and powers under any Act, whether passed before or after the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  So, it seems that officers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will have the powers vested in the Garda under this Bill.  While this is reasonable, it raises the question as to why the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and its officers have been specifically excluded from exercising the powers to be vested in gardaí under the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  Consistency in application would require that the ombudsman commission should have investigative powers equivalent to those of gardaí under both these pieces of legislation.  What is the reason for excluding the ombudsman commission under one Bill and including it in the other?  I hope the Minister will address this point. On the issue of oversight, I must ask whether the Minister is seriously asking this Legislature to accept section 11 as it is worded at present.  If we speak specifically to the issue of oversight, section 11 would have to be modified to give a more structured role for judicial oversight other than that which is proposed.  The wording in sections 11 and 12 is as weak as water and pays lip service to the notion of oversight.  There is no provision for redress for a person who has been investigated inappropriately under this provision.  There is no provision for a Revenue officer, member of the Garda Síochána or member of the Permanent Defence Force to be brought to book where a misuse or abuse of the process is proven.  The oversight process must investigate an adequate number of files and this must be on a random basis. The question again arises as to what real powers a judge has in regard to any abuse of process.  There is none that I can see in the Bill.  I refer the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the Bills Digest produced by the Oireachtas Library, which produced an excellent paper on this matter, and I acknowledge its invaluable service in this respect.  On the matter of judicial supervision, the paper states: ""In carrying out his-her duties the judge may investigate any case in which a disclosure request is made, communicate with the Taoiseach or the Minister concerning disclosure requests, and the Data Protection Commissioner in connection with the Commissioner's functions under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.""  While this oversight broadly echoes similar approaches used in, for example, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009, Mr. Tom McIntyre, speaking in the context of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, raised concerns about the effectiveness of this form of supervision scheme.  He stated: . . . this oversight system has been almost entirely opaque from the outset.  The annual reports of the Designated Judge — since the position was created in 1993 — have consisted every year of no more than a single line stating that the operation of the Act has been kept under review and its provisions have been complied with.  There has been for example no discussion of what steps have been taken to keep the operation of the Act under review; whether the individual files were reviewed; the volume of surveillance being carried out; and whether mistakes were made in carrying out surveillance (such as targeting of the wrong individual or number) and, if so, what steps were taken to safeguard against such mistakes in future.  There is similarly no publicly available report of the Complaints Referee indicating what complaints, if any, have been made and-or upheld.  This may be contrasted with the most recent Annual Report of the UK Chief Surveillance Commissioner which reveals, amongst other things, that 23,628 authorisations for directed surveillance were granted to law enforcement agencies; and 60 different law enforcement agencies were inspected during the year. . . The reports of the designated judge are not exactly what one would call models of transparency.  There is no reason that we should not have a provision in the Bill which would guarantee that statistical data is made available.  There is an irony in that because, if one examines section 9 of the Bill, one will see there is provision for an annual statistical report to the European Commission, as required by the directive, but not to the Oireachtas or to Irish citizens. At least this report should be laid before the Oireachtas. The opaque nature of the Irish oversight system also becomes obvious when compared with the equivalent report in the United Kingdom.  The relevant official in the UK is the Interception of Communications Commissioner.  That individual is a retired judge who has similar functions to our designated judge.  However, his most recent annual report runs to 24 pages in total, nine of which are devoted to data retention issues.  Granted, the UK system is on a much larger scale, but one key difference is that the UK commissioner does not see his role as limited to the narrow question of legality — instead his report goes into detail about mistakes which were made and explains what is being done to prevent further mistakes.  It would be desirable to establish a greater role for the designated judge along these lines.  I hope we can address those issues on Committee Stage. The functions of the designated judge and complaints referee are too limited.  One of the problems with the role of the designated judge under section 12 is that it envisages him or her as being engaged in a largely paper-based exercise.  Section 12 gives the designated judge ""the power to investigate any case in which a disclosure request is made"".  Let us suppose however that a junior garda informally pressurises an Internet service provider, ISP, employee to hand over information — perhaps for some private purpose.  In that case no ""disclosure request"", as defined in section 6, would have been made, thus leaving a question mark as to whether the judge has any power to investigate.  It might be possible to read section 12 widely to find such a power — but it would be desirable for it to be made clear. The judge's role under section 12 is also limited to ""ascertain[ing] whether the Garda Síochána, the Permanent Defence Force and the Revenue Commissioners are complying with"" the Act.  As such, the judge does not appear to enjoy any power to, for example, make sure that ISPs and telcos are storing this information securely or are responding appropriately to requests. Similarly, the role of the complaints referee under section 10 hinges on there being a ""disclosure request"".  As such, he or she would have no power to investigate if, for example, a newspaper were to bribe a telecoms employee for access to information.  I refer to a recent case where a red top, which I will not name, was recently implicated in a similar phone tapping scandal.  Those problems are to some extent mitigated by the fact that the Data Protection Commissioner might investigate those situations but the Data Protection Commissioner will not have the same oversight powers.  The Act should clarify the functions of the designated judge and complaints referee and make clear what is to happen in borderline cases. There is uncertainty about to whom the Bill will apply.  The Bill takes, essentially verbatim, the loose language of the directive and in section 1 defines a service provider as ""a person who is engaged in the provision of a publicly available electronic communications service or a public communications network by means of fixed line or mobile telephones or the Internet"".  Those are wide, and imprecise definitions and given that specific statutory obligations are created an element of doubt can arise.  There are many various applications and we do not know how the provisions would apply to or affect those who use webmail, webmail-like applications, open WiFi, and voice Internet messaging.  The list is endless.  There is such a broad scope and range of technologies that it is our view that the definitions need to be clearer.  That will cause panic and confusion across the sector and will have seriously damaging consequences for Ireland's ability to promote itself as a destination for high-tech industries. I wish to read into the record a copy of a letter received by the Minister from the ICT Division of Engineers which speaks further to the concerns they have about the Bill: We first observe that electronic data is diverse, and increasing in its diversity.  Telephone, mobile phone and text messaging are well established, along with electronic email messaging.  However, in many communities it is now more common to use social networking sites — such as Facebook, Bebo, and LinkedIn — for direct person to person, and person to group communication.  Such communications use a different technology than email, and cannot necessarily be detected by software which specifically tracks email.  Further, direct internet messaging — such as AIM, MSN, Yahoo Messenger and Skype messaging — are also extremely common.  Finally of course Twitter is also now perhaps the most prevalent of them all, and can be used both for instant person to person communication, as well as person to group communication.  No doubt next year, there will be another new communication technology.. Our concern is that as criminals become aware of the legislation pertaining in Ireland, they may well be able to displace their electronic communication modes to new ones for which legislation has yet to be passed.  [That issue needs to be raised as well.] On a different track, we would note that in today's world, much electronic communication is international in nature.  Correspondents (of instant messaging, email, social networking, twitter and so) may not always be within the Irish jurisdiction, and not even within the EU.  We gently draw this to your attention, and assume your legal advisors are considering the consequences of capturing information relating to citizens and companies from outside the EU who may not be covered by Irish legislation.  [That point must be addressed by the Minister in response to this debate.] With today's falling costs of storage, there is no particular great concern over the cost of the physical hardware.  However, safely and securely storing and then retrieving (perhaps after several years) increasing quantities of information does have implications on the business processes of the service providers concerned. There is the aspect of capturing the information in the first instance, based on the number of modes of communication.  That will run into billions if one takes the two year retention period into account.  That issue will have to be addressed.  Following that, there is a significant cost implication for businesses as a result of that.  In this country we are talking about the possibility of a smart economy.  What the legislation does is incur a further cost on businesses by virtue of the data retention period.  Wider issues arise in terms of the jurisdiction of the legislation vis-à-vis the fact that we trade internationally and messages pass internationally.  That is something that must be addressed by the legislation. No justification has been given for a two-year retention period for phone data.  Under the directive, member states are free to choose a data retention period between six months and two years.  The UK adopted a standard 12 month period.  I am not aware of any justification as to why the Bill opts for the maximum two years for telephone data.  The European Commission's own research on police requests for data has shown that the overwhelming majority of requests are for data which are less than three months old.  If the Garda experience is different then some evidence to that effect would be desirable. As to the budgetary implications of this legislation, I have serious reservations about the undue cost that would be borne by businesses as a result of that measure. Again, I refer to the Oireachtas research service that focused on the budgetary implications.  It stated the Bill is silent on the likely costs to be involved in implementing and complying with the provisions of the directive.  According to the status report on the transposition of the directive by EU member states and EFTA and the regulatory impact assessment prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the State will not reimburse service providers the costs involved in complying with the obligations under the Bill, even though ""service providers have complained that management of data would impose heavy costs that they would in turn have to pass on to businesses and consumers"".  The net effect of the legislation, arguably, is that we will retain all sorts of data, 99.9% of which will be superfluous messages that pass between ordinary citizens.  This will be stored by the service providers.  There will be a cost for that storage and the consumer will end up paying that cost. I accept the principle that there must be data retention.  However, there must be balance in terms of how long it is retained and whether it is necessary to retain data for two years.  I believe it is unnecessary.  It is impractical and in the context of crime prevention measures, I am not convinced that retaining data, particularly Internet data, for a period of two years will catch more criminals or undo a terrorist organisation.  We must exercise a little common sense in our approach to the legislation.  With that in mind, we will seek to amend the legislation significantly to reflect our views."

I am seeking a debate in the House so that the Minister for Health and Children can say why little progress has been made in implementing the 33 recommendations made by the Committee on Health and Children in 2006, what tangible deadlines have been set out for the implementation of those recommendations and to ask the Minister to respond to the description of this Government’s record on suicide prevention as a litany of failure.

2975	SeanSherlock	Labour	13460.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	149	" While I have great respect for Deputy Michael McGrath's views, as a layman I still find it difficult to understand how the State can justify the investment of €4 billion of taxpayers' money in Anglo Irish Bank.  To date, no one has been able to give me an economic rationale for allowing this bank to stay afloat.  I have not heard it from a market perspective, nor have I heard a cogent political perspective to convince me of the need to have invested so much taxpayers' money in that institution.  There will have to be a further analysis of that decision.  I can only surmise that some of the stakeholders in that bank were so strategic in terms of the Irish economy and the employment they provide that if there was a risk their investments were going to be compromised in any way, it could have had untold consequences for jobs in a number of other sectors.  That has not been stated by anyone on the Government benches, however.  I would prefer people to come clean about the motives for such an investment because taxpayers deserve no less. As regards the Deputy's comments on the levy, those who will ultimately pay the price if such a levy is imposed on the banks will be the customers, not the institutions themselves and certainly not the shareholders.  If a levy is imposed, the taxpayers will pay it, thus imposing another cost on the customer base. As regards the NAMA legislation, four months ago, a representative from the Irish Banking Federation told an Oireachtas committee that approximately 14,000 people in this country have mortgages which are in arrears.  Juxtapose this with a blanket guarantee, which Labour opposed, and one has a situation where the Government now stands as guarantor for the funds of speculative bondholders in some instances, as well as shareholders in a banking system in a state of paralysis and to which it is proposed to transfer resources in the name of all taxpayers, present and future. One of the fundamental questions for my constituents in Cork East is whether legislation of this magnitude will protect home owners who are at risk of repossession.  The answer to that question, quite plainly, is ""No"".  We are losing jobs every day and liquidity plays a part in that analysis.  More seriously, as my colleague Deputy Michael D. Higgins pointed out earlier, home owners are terrified of the day when interest rates increase as the European Central Bank responds to a slow European recovery.  A wave of repossessions may ensue.  That figure of 14,000 represents thousands of families who live with the fear of repossession hanging over their heads as they attempt to make ends meet.  These are families living in unfinished estates or shoebox apartments.  Young families are sending their children to prefab classrooms in schools too small to cope with the influx of new housing.  They are families who made a choice.  Much like the bankers who will be bailed out by this legislation, these families decided to take a risk in purchasing houses at historically high prices.  Taking out a mortgage constitutes making an investment in property, with all the potential hazards that come with it.  In the main, however, their behaviour could not be characterised as speculative.  Their behaviour was predicated on the basic human need to set up home and put down roots.  The difference, however, is that these families will not be afforded any bailout.  The best that families in arrears will get is a moratorium, a stay of execution that will delay the inevitable proceedings that could see a percentage of them rendered homeless. There is also another difference.  While bankers and builders looked to a multitude of so-called financial experts hell bent on hitting financial targets, the people took their Government's assurances at face value when stepping onto the property ladder.  The Fianna Fáil Party laughed off warnings of a recession with jokes about naysayers committing suicide and insisted that we were in for a soft landing when cautioned about the overheated economy.  Weeks prior to the 2007 general election, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, criticised an RTE programme entitled ""Future Shock: Property Crash"".  At the time the programme was frightening in its bleak appraisal of the property market, but it is now seen as remarkable in its prescience.  At the time, Deputy Bertie Ahern described the programme as irresponsible and inaccurate. Why should the public trust those who got us into this mess to get us out of it?  The Fianna Fáil Party has not got the confidence of the people of this country on NAMA or any other issue.  Once again, the people are being asked to trust Fianna Fáil, the party which gave assurances of soft landings and ignored the advice of those concerned with the property bubble.  Once again, its members chose to ignore the warnings, this time disregarding the sound economic consensus that NAMA is a bad deal for the taxpayer.  Any faith the public once had in Fianna Fáil is gone.  We can see this legislation for what it is — an attempt by Fianna Fáil to maintain the status quo.  It will continue to prop up those who benefited greatly from the economic policies of Deputies Bertie Ahern, Charlie McCreevy and Brian Cowen.  Those policies enlarged the gulf between the wealthy elite and ordinary citizens.  The people of Ireland do not want NAMA and they do not believe that this Government can repair the damage done to Ireland’s economy, reputation and confidence. The Labour Party policy on NAMA is predicated on a belief that the payment to a bank of a long-term economic value for loans amounts to a significant gift by taxpayers.  This is a €7 billion gift to the banks.  As CORI and other organisations have pointed out, this is likely to undermine the State's finances and public services for years to come while failing to secure credit for businesses. The Government's approach to resolving the current fiscal crisis is inherently flawed.  There is no talk of stimulus and the assets are over-valued.  Banks do not have to change their behaviour.  We believe the current market value is the price that must be paid for these assets.  The Government should ensure nothing above the true current market value is paid for the assets in order that the risk to the citizen is lessened.  If the €47 billion valuation is accurate, the decision to pay the banks €54 billion for the assets amounts to a gift of €7 billion to them.  Where is the economic justification for such an action? The Bill is one of the most significant the Dáil will ever debate.  The risks to the Exchequer are enormous and irreversible.  Overpayment by NAMA for the loans will impose a major financial burden on the State, yet it is clear this is the inevitable consequence of the Government's approach.  Throughout the banking crisis, the Labour Party's analysis has been consistent in its determination to protect the interests of the taxpayer, while advancing proposals to restore a functioning banking system, supplying much needed credit in the economy at the lowest cost and risk to the taxpayer.  Our analysis is there will always be a risk to the taxpayer but we can mitigate it more expeditiously than Fianna Fáil.  Our approach, based on temporary nationalisation of the two largest banks, would minimise the risk to the taxpayer and provide a potential upside when the banks were reintegrated into the private sector. We have published our position in this regard and been consistent in our opposition to the underlying culture of greed and recklessness that gave rise to the banking crisis in the first place.  We have always called for tougher regulation at EU level and countered the role of our own Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, in completely rolling back the regulatory framework, a process started by his predecessor, Commissioner Bolkestein.  In addition, we have always said the financial services sector would have to be regulated because the invisible hand of capitalism would render the type of crisis we are now experiencing.  During the bubble years we pointed to the dangers and unfairness of soaring house prices, brought forward legislation to control the price of building land and challenged the tax breaks fuelling property prices.  Instead of acting to control prices, Fianna Fáil stoked the property boom at the same time as the party flaunted its relationships with property developers. There are serious weaknesses in the proposed governance structures of NAMA.  As well as the risks and costs of bad loans being borne by the taxpayer, no provision in the Bill gives assurance that a tough, commercial approach will be taken to developers.  The legislation has inherent flaws.  The Bill states the agency is to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State having regard to a number of factors but it vests extraordinary powers and discretion in the Minister for Finance.  I am not convinced these powers will achieve the best financial return for the State. The legislation states, ""except where otherwise provided by this Act, NAMA is independent in its performance of its functions"".  In an overall assessment of the Bill's provisions, the agency, in all major respects, is not independent but it must act at the direction of the Minister.  Its function is ""to acquire certain assets from certain persons to be designated"" by the Minister and ""to perform such other functions related to the management or realisation of bank assets that it has acquired as are directed by the Minister"".  The power of designation of ""eligible bank assets"" to be purchased by NAMA is vested in the Minister.  He or she must consult NAMA, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator but the power to designate resides with him or her exclusively. This is a flawed process in the context of democracy.  I hope the Labour Party will have an opportunity to address this issue on Committee Stage because there must be proper financial and regulatory oversight of the legislation to ensure it will not be abused if the Minister is seeking to achieve the aim of gaining the maximum value for the amount invested by the State.  The legislation requires NAMA, in the performance of its functions, to have regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister and sets out his or her powers of direction, which are extensive.  The agency is required to comply with any ministerial direction.  The legislation gives the Minister too much power.  These powers need to be devolved to the financial regulatory regime.  I hope this issue will also be addressed on Committee Stage. The NTMA must provide NAMA with such business and support services and systems as the NAMA board determines acting on the recommendation of the chief executive officer of NAMA and following consultation with the chief executive officer of the NTMA.  It is also obliged to supply staff and provide NAMA with treasury services and advice.  Other than these functions, NAMA appears to be a cuckoo in the NTMA nest.  While the formula of having consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank is included in the Bill, clearly the Minister is not bound by and does not need to have particular regard to his or her views. With regard to the role of the Oireachtas, the Minister is required to furnish an annual statement to the Houses of the Oireachtas but the Bill entitles him or her to omit ""any matter that would disclose confidential information"".  ""Confidential information"" is widely defined and could be construed to justify withholding any information the Minister sees fit.  The chairperson and chief executive officer of NAMA must appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and deal with general matters that are specified, for example, the economy and the efficiency of NAMA systems and procedures.  However, the Bill includes a section that gags and prevents them from expressing an opinion on the merits of the policy of the Government or a Minister or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy. The legislation appears to leave it in the hands of the Minister to evaluate after five years whether NAMA ""had made progress towards achieving its overall objectives"" and whether a continuation of the agency is necessary.  That should be a decision for the Oireachtas, rather than the Minister. The Minister also has critical overriding functions in the determination of acquisition values.  The Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations to require NAMA to take into account the report of an expert concerning factors or matters relevant to the determination of the value of any property in question.  Under the legislation, he or she will appoint the expert reviewer and the valuation panel.  The panel will review the total portfolio acquisition value and then proceed to communicate its position to the Minister, not NAMA.  However, the Minister can reject the valuation of a portfolio by the panel.  In other words, if he or she does not secure the valuation he or she wants from the panel, it will have to reconsider the valuation.  That is a Labour Party analysis and is something I hope the Minister will respond to in the debate because it is pertinent. There is much in the Bill that will require further discussion.  The valuation process is inherently flawed.  The taxpayer will have paid a surplus of their own money to the banks for this process.  The legacy of this legislation will be negative.  The Labour Party had a constructive alternative analysis through the construction of an asset recovery which we felt would be a much more expeditious way of dealing with the crisis in the banking sector.  We felt that temporary nationalisation, with a view to selling stock back into the market once there was an upturn in the economy, was the way to go.  We hope to deal with all of the issues we have outlined on Committee Stage."

Why did the Minister not refer to biodiversity?  It will be argued the scheme was used as a supplementary income measure in some cases.  The scheme's closure will result in more applicants for farm assist, which is already happening in some areas.  Considering the biodiversity measures already contained under the existing scheme and its success, it seems illogical that a new scheme needs to be introduced when the old scheme could be continued.

2983	SeanSherlock	Labour	13462.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	364	 I asked this question, given that Teagasc's procedures and operations have already been reviewed.  I do not doubt that the recommendations will be implemented.  However, the McCarthy report states that there is scope for reducing Teagasc's staff numbers by a minimum of 250 in the short term by rationalisation of agricultural colleges and locations, reducing lower priority advisory and research activities, reducing administration and advisory services, the latter by 50%, reducing education and training functions by 30% and 20%, respectively, by 2011 and reviewing the network of offices. If the economy is to get back on its feet, the research, administrative and support services provided by Teagasc will be necessary to ensure people operating in the rural economy have the advantage they require.  I strongly suggest that the Minister of State should defend the services operated by Teagasc, particularly scientific research where McCarthy proposes that all research should be codified in one body.  This will not necessarily assist in agricultural or agribusiness-related research and this should be revised and reviewed. With regard to those people who are employed by Teagasc in the agricultural colleges, a question arises about their future if this report is implemented.  I agree there is a budgetary process in train but I ask that this area be defended.  If it is not defended, and we see post-budget in 2009 and 2010 a further reduction or diminution in the services operated by Teagasc, it will have untold consequences for the rural economy which we will not stand over.

My questions are pertinent to what is in the report.  I want to know whether those services will be defended; I do not want an answer that hides behind the budgetary process which is still a long way off.  We want definitive answers.  I ask those questions on behalf of those people who live in rural Ireland, who live beyond the so-called Pale, and who depend on these services.

Will that meeting give rise to a new regulation regarding a CMO, common market organisation, for milk or dairy, or will the status quo remain for political intervention in the market, given that there is a slight increase in the price and a slight recovery at present?  Is the strategy within the European Union to do nothing at present?  It is possible a logical strategy would be to wait to see if there will be a further recovery, or will there be further intervention?  I did not quite understand the Minister’s original reply.
2986	SeanSherlock	Labour	13462.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	394	 Environmental measures, such as water management, will become more prevalent under the CAP in future.  The question concerns the administrative functions.  There is a suggestion afoot that we will move from pillar one to pillar two and that, instead of direct payments to farmers for management of the economy, it will be administered through various local organisations.  That danger is there, so the question needs to be addressed.  It may not be a real fear, but it is something that needs to be addressed.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that in the first instance. Second, as regards carbon reduction, at some stage there will have to be an internal debate between the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, as to whether methane reduction will become an issue if the process of carbon reduction becomes part of the CAP regime.  The climate change agenda is also on the cards, given the forthcoming UN conference in Copenhagen in December.  How will we get to a situation where we do not compromise production or market share, while meeting future demands for food, as well as other targets?  There will be an internal battle within the Government on that issue.  It is something that will arise in the context of the CAP.  I would like to get an opinion from the Minister on these questions.
2987	SeanSherlock	Labour	13462.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-15 00:00:00	Prelude	295	 I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority. This is reflected in the fact that my Department was the only Department other than Social Welfare that got an increase this year. The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years. There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998. Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.  As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. I assume that the reference in the correspondence to special classes being cut relates to my Department's decision earlier this year to suppress a number of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability (MGLD). I would like to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a MGLD. My Department examined the enrolment numbers in these special classes and found that a number of classes did not have the minimum number of 9 pupils required to retain the special class teacher. Over half of the classes suppressed had five or fewer children. Schools which had MGLD special classes were allowed to keep them as long as the number of pupils enrolled was 9 or more. The special classes which closed pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with MGLD as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose. All children with MGLD who were in the classes that have been suppressed will be able to receive additional teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model. The correspondence also referred to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004. The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date. A significant number of sections of the Act have already been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special  Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged.   Notwithstanding this, a commitment has been made in the renewed Programme for Government to develop, in consultation with stakeholders, a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act, focusing on measurable and practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs. Furthermore, as announced in the renewed Programme for Government, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) will be provided with funding for 28 additional posts to bring the number of NEPS psychologists to 210. This means that every school in the country will have access to NEPS which provides assessment and psychological advice for schools to enable them to provide  appropriate supports and programmes for children with special educational needs.  The renewed Programme also commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the renewed programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.

There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years. There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998. Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.  As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. I assume that the reference in the correspondence to special classes being cut relates to my Department's decision earlier this year to suppress a number of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability (MGLD). I would like to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a MGLD. My Department examined the enrolment numbers in these special classes and found that a number of classes did not have the minimum number of 9 pupils required to retain the special class teacher. Over half of the classes suppressed had five or fewer children. Schools which had MGLD special classes were allowed to keep them as long as the number of pupils enrolled was 9 or more. The special classes which closed pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with MGLD as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose. All children with MGLD who were in the classes that have been suppressed will be able to receive additional teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model. The correspondence also referred to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004. The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date. A significant number of sections of the Act have already been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special  Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged.   Notwithstanding this, a commitment has been made in the renewed Programme for Government to develop, in consultation with stakeholders, a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act, focusing on measurable and practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs. Furthermore, as announced in the renewed Programme for Government, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) will be provided with funding for 28 additional posts to bring the number of NEPS psychologists to 210. This means that every school in the country will have access to NEPS which provides assessment and psychological advice for schools to enable them to provide  appropriate supports and programmes for children with special educational needs.  The renewed Programme also commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the renewed programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.

3008	SeanSherlock	Labour	13490.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	443	 As the Deputy will be aware, the proposals in the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes are being considered as part of the estimates process for 2010. The decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government. While I will have to await the outcome of these deliberative processes, I can confirm that there are no plans to close small schools at the moment other than those that would arise in the normal course  under the current sustainability limits. I fully acknowledge the attachment of local communities to their schools and the association of the school with a sense of place. However, I am of the view that my Department will have to examine the implementation of more strict guidelines in relation to the number of pupils required for the sustainability of schools.  The Deputy may be aware that building projects involving amalgamation of schools already attract a high band rating within the Schools Building Programme.

The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date. I understand that in this instance that the NEWB are actively assisting the family in pursuing applications to other schools.  I also understand that a home tuition grant has been sanctioned for the child in question and that the National Council for Special Education are in contact with the family in question.

3013	SeanSherlock	Labour	13502.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	320	 The Minister states that the €1.3 billion reduction — he calls it an adjustment — envisaged will be offset by the 6.6% decrease by which prices have fallen.  The import of this is that a reduction of €1.3 billion in the public sector pay bill has no effect in real terms because prices have been reduced effectively by the same amount.  If one takes the 6.6% and the 7% levy, that is over 13%, and if one takes the potential for an increase in interest rates which is inevitable against a backdrop where there are no adequate supports for those people who will inevitably fall into arrears on their mortgages, then the Minister is creating a major problem for those people who are on middle to low incomes.  I ask the Minister to address the question of the inevitable rise in interest rates in real terms and the effect that will have for those people who will be affected as a result of such an increase.

3016	SeanSherlock	Labour	13502.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	437	 I refer to the praise meted out to the Fourth Estate.  My colleagues may have inadvertently forgotten to mention Jonathan Healy of Newstalk, Ralph Riegel of the Irish Independent, Barry Roche of The Irish Times, and all the staff in the Evening Echo.
3017	SeanSherlock	Labour	13502.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	438	 Paschal Sheehy may have been on holidays but I understand he was here with us in spirit. I hail from the town of Mallow, which is in the flood plain.  Mallow has been flooding since Adam was a boy but the events of recent days have proven that the flood alleviation works have worked very well for the town.  The flood defences for the first phase worked extremely well.  It is important to acknowledge when work is carried out successfully.
3018	SeanSherlock	Labour	13502.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	440	 I humbly give praise to the members of Mallow Town Council and its staff.  I refer to George O'Malley and the lads who put on the oilskins and go out year after year when flooding occurs.  There is no fuss.  They just get on with the job because that is what they do.  They do not want praise for it but that work is worthy of acknowledgement because they do it year in, year out.  This year they were out with the demountable walls, working with the area and town engineers, and had those defences up in no time.  That must be acknowledged also. I acknowledge the Minister's statement on the start of phase one in Fermoy but issues remain concerning the clean-up there.  At the risk of being parochial, both sides of the river, particularly at Rathealy Road, Francis Street, Thomas Street, Greenhill and Brian Boru Square on the north side, are all badly affected.  If some form of aid is to be made available, I ask that those residents be eligible for it, as should the people on the south side, particularly at Ashe Quay, the mart road, O'Neill Crowley Quay, Elbow Lane and Tallow Road, which were all badly hit.  It has been said to me that the Fermoy flood was the worst in the past 25 years.  That should be on the record because while we agree the works will commence shortly in Fermoy, some damage remains arising from the flood works in that area.  I ask the Department to examine the damage that has been done and look favourably on the residents and the businesses in that area. There is a stoicism among people who are born in the flood, so to speak.  They get on with life and do the business, but what seems to have characterised the flood events throughout the rest of the country is that they would not normally occur in those areas.  While we will deal with the problems in Fermoy and Mallow, and I visited south Galway at the weekend to see the damage done, it is vital that other parts of the country are examined in the same way as Mallow and Fermoy. It is important that the flood alleviation works due to be carried out in Fermoy do not compromise the amenity that is the rowing club.  There are proposals to carry out works on the weir on the Blackwater in Fermoy but we are concerned they will have a negative impact on the rowing club.  I am aware the Minister made some public statements about that in recent days and I hope he will look favourably on the fact that there is a rowing club in the area and that this amenity cannot be compromised in any way. It is particularly ironic that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party blame the flooding events on bad planning in certain parts of the country.  They might revisit some of their statements in that sense.
3019	SeanSherlock	Labour	13502.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	488	 The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated that development on flood plains should be avoided, where possible, and that development should mitigate, not add to, existing risk.  Mallow Town Park is located on a flood plain.  It was owned by the Jephson family, which also owned Mallow Castle.  A descendant of that family sought to have the Mallow town development plan materially contravened in order that the land within the flood plain might be developed.  There has been a constant battle on Mallow Town Council in respect of this matter.  The people of Mallow want to ensure that the park will be held by them in perpetuity for the common good.  In light of the Minister of State's comments, will the Government entertain the possibility of compulsorily purchasing the land in question in order that it might be held for the people?

3027	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	222	 I acknowledge the Minister's response, in which he referred to the importance of the scheme.  Given that more than 50,000 farmers participate in the scheme while 32,000 have participated in Teagasc training and the budget is approximately €250 million, would the Minister not consider increasing the payment from €40 to €60 per head in the coming year because of the difficulties faced by farmers due to recent adverse weather conditions and the state of the market?  Farmers have a deep commitment to the scheme but given the reduction in their incomes, an increase in this payment next year would provide a major buttress against loss of earnings in the current climate.
3028	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	224	 I appreciate the Minister's answer.  I speak to this issue because of the current importance of the export market.  It is a very productive sector and any inputs now or in the next two years will be vital to maintaining productivity and market share.  There is a logic to maintaining the scheme.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to maintain the scheme and to review the payment.  The Minister mentioned the ICBF.  Its recent research, as indicated in the Irish Farmers’ Journal of last week, suggests that the cow herd has shrunk by 6% this year.  That could have negative implications for the future of the export market. Is the Minister engaging with the farm organisations to, at least, maintain the scheme and to ensure, if there is a reduction from €80, that payment will continue to those farmers under the scheme?
3029	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	256	 I posed this question on the last occasion the Minister answered questions and I got the exact same answer as he has imparted to Deputy Cregan.  I note he said that a meeting took place on 2 November.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  Will the stakeholder group, the consultative group, engage in a reporting procedure to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in order that we can be in a position to monitor the nature of deliberations therein?
3030	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	258	 We are aware of the importance of the abolition of quotas.  This is why we have called for consultation and an act of participation.  It is important that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would feed into that process in some way.  It is also important that we are notified of the ongoing nature of the consultations.  Did the Minster invite Teagasc to the last meeting?  Is the scientific community involved in this process as an active participant?  When I put the question in October, I was informed it would be invited.

3034	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 ——and the Minister's reply indicated that it is proposed to transfer operations there to Fermoy.  Having consulted some of the staff in Mallow, it transpires that major issues have arisen with regard to the move to Fermoy.  How definitive is the decision in this regard?  What consultations took place in respect of retaining the staff in Mallow and transferring operations to a larger premises there?
3035	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	310	 I assume the Minister in his reply is giving an assurance on the future of live exports.  Is this the case?

3037	SeanSherlock	Labour	13504.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-11-26 00:00:00	Prelude	326	 Concerns have been expressed to me about a proposal to close a branch office of the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership in Mallow.  Some members of the board are concerned about the proposal because the office in Mallow supervises the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and rural transport programme.  I attest to the good work done by the office which has been in operation since 1996.  I also share the concerns communicated to me by board members about the closure of the office as it will create significant potential for a diminution of the service provided in the Mallow and north Cork region. I am also concerned that proposals have been made by the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership to instigate a round of voluntary redundancies in advance of any announcement in the budget of a reduction of a ministerial budget line for such groups to provide services.  I am further concerned about certain corporate governance issues which arise as a result of the decision to which I refer.  At the most recent board meeting of the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership, it was communicated to members that no decision had been made on the closure of the Mallow office or on seeking a round of voluntary redundancies.  Despite this, staff have been notified that the office will close and a voluntary redundancy package will be offered.  They must give their decisions on the package by next Monday. Has the Minister given a direction to the partnership that the office in Mallow should close?  Has the board or chief executive officer communicated to the Department an intention to seek voluntary redundancies?  Has the Department communicated with the partnership about the need to seek redundancies and close one of its operational centres, namely, the Mallow office? I ask that the Department give the board of Blackwater Avondhu Partnership an undertaking that all rules and regulations pertaining to corporate governance procedures will be adhered to as regards the responsibilities of the board, as distinct from the chief executive officer.  I also ask that the Department issue guidance to the board in this respect. The individuals who communicated with me are board members.  While some of them vehemently oppose the closure of the Mallow office, they accept the argument that if rationalisation is required services will be moved to another office in Fermoy.  They seek to ensure that the process applied to staff members in the Mallow office is completely transparent, the wishes of board members are observed and no person or persons act in a unilateral fashion.  The reason I saw fit to raise this issue is that concern has arisen about the actions of some individuals with regard to the continuation of services in Mallow.  I share this concern. While I accept that we live in constrained times and the amalgamation of two entities sometimes causes one entity to suffer, I am adamant that the LDSIP, a phenomenally successful programme, should continue within the amalgamated structure.  The rural transport programme, which delivers excellent services, should also continue, as should the other services such as those at the Mallow office.

3049	SeanSherlock	Labour	13510.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	622	" I would like to quote from an academic analysis that suggests an additional unit of income earned or gained by a female is more likely to be spent on child care, or children's clothing, than an additional unit of income earned or gained by a male.  The report in question, The Kids are Alright: Who Benefits from Child Benefit?  An Analysis Using Irish Data, which was published by Dr. David Madden in March 2000, states: Child Benefit in Ireland is unlike most other transfer payments in two respects.  First, it is a universal non means-tested payment made to all families with children.  The second unusual feature regarding child benefit is that it is normally paid to the child's mother or step-mother.  If the child does not live with the mother or step-mother, then it may be paid to the child's father or step-father. The report continues: The combination of these two factors implies that analysis of child benefit and the pattern of expenditure from child benefit can throw light on a number of features of interest.  The first of these concerns the issue of within household allocation.  Much economic analysis treats the family as the unit of measurement and little attention is paid to the allocation of resources within the household.  Since child benefit is paid to the mother then analysis of how it is spent may shed light on the degree to which ownership of a source of income may affect its use. Dr. Madden's analysis refers to a report published in the UK, which shows how: A change in the payment of child benefit from fathers to mothers led to increased expenditure on children's clothing.  In a similar vein [another report showed] the different influence of male and female incomes on patterns of household expenditures.  They find that an extra unit of female income is more likely to be spent on childcare or children's clothing than is an extra unit of male income. The Madden report continues: If the propensity to consume ""child-intensive"" goods such as food or children's clothing is higher from child benefit than other sources of income then it seems reasonable to infer that children do gain disproportionately from child benefit.  The universality of child benefit lends itself in particular to the analysis of this issue since it implies that apart from the obvious difference of having children, families receiving child benefit should be reasonably representative of the population at large. Dr. Madden also refers to the 1994 Rottman report, which examined some of these issues.  Although it relates to an original survey from 1987, I suggest that the same principles continue to apply.  The report states: He uses a sample of 625 households who were part of a follow-up to a major survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1987.  He finds that the source of income appears to be important from the point of view of sharing of resources.  Households with income derived mainly from social welfare sources share about 33% of their income compared with an average of about 63% for other households.  With regard to child benefit households appear to divide fairly evenly between those who use it for general household spending and those who use it for child specific goods.  That breakdown is sensitive however to who controls the spending of child benefit.  Where it is jointly controlled there is a significantly lower proportion spent on children's goods as opposed to the case where the wife [I assume he means ""partner""] controls child benefit.  He also finds that when asked how a windfall increase of £20 per month in household income would be spent, 18% of wives listed children's clothing as a priority as opposed to 10% of husbands. A total of 18% of wives listed children's clothing as a priority, as opposed to 10% of husbands.  The fundamental point here is that this a payment to women for their children.  It is used in households for children, is protected by women for their children and goes directly towards the welfare of children. Although this study may be dated, I believe it stands the test of time.  If the payment goes to women for the welfare of children, then there is a logical case for it to be preserved, as has already been elucidated by my colleagues.  That is our central point."

The Department of Foreign Affairs, including Ireland's network of diplomatic  missions, also plays a key role in promoting international education, including  through awareness-raising, supporting Ministerial visits, maintaining contacts  with overseas Government Ministries and education agencies and lending  support and assistance to visiting Irish institutions; it works very closely  with Enterprise Ireland in this regard.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is  represented on the inter-agency group on international education which my  Department chairs, and will also be represented on the high-level group on  international education.  In order to ensure full awareness of the issues  involved in international education, my Department provides a full briefing to  Irish Ambassadors and other diplomats prior to their departure on overseas  posts."

The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of teachers paid pass or honours degree allowances and teaching the specific subjects referred to is not available from my Departments payroll databases.  However, there were six thousand nine hundred and eighty two teachers employed in secondary community or comprehensive schools in receipt of pass degree allowances. There were eight thousand eight hundred and seventy four in receipt of honours degree allowances. My Department is obtaining information from the Teaching Council in relation to the numbers of registered teachers holding honours or pass degrees in the subject areas referred to.  I will arrange for that information to be forwarded to the Deputy.

I do not think it warrants the measure produced here.  There are other ways of tackling the tide or stemming the flow across the Border.

3084	SeanSherlock	Labour	13519.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	582	 If those on jobseeker's benefit aged under 24 are residing with their parents, will there be a pro rata cut to reflect the parents’ means?  I have received more and more calls from parents whose sons or daughters recently left college and are living at home.  They have a high dependency on the parental income to give them spending power.  How will they be affected? The reduction in income for claimants in this category will have a detrimental effect because the Minister's announcement about additional training places has not been set out in concrete form.  We do not know what shape the places will take or whether a demographic or qualitative study has been conducted as to who in this category would slot into the places.   We do not know how they will slot in or what type of course they will take up.  This is ill thought out.  The overarching philosophy of the Minister was to drive a coach and four through those who most need that marginal income without any thought or lateral view of how this might impact on them.  Will the Minister outline how this cut will affect those people if their parents' income is above a certain level?  I fear for them.  For example, if a parent who works in the public sector has an income up to €40,000 per annum and has a son or daughter who has just graduated, it is most likely that son or daughter is now living at home because he or she cannot get a job.  If that graduate son or daughter cannot find an adequate training place because, as has been stated, he or she is over qualified for the training position, will he or she now be penalised through a reduced payment because of refusing a training place?  What negative effect will this have on their income if they live at home.  These are issues of concern.  In talking about active labour market mechanisms for people who are under the age of 25, the Minister should have thought a little more laterally about putting some well thought out schemes in place before effecting a cut.
3085	SeanSherlock	Labour	13519.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	707	 Deputy Gogarty has now acquired a God complex.
3086	SeanSherlock	Labour	13519.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	715	 On a point of order, if one is shoving somebody——
3087	SeanSherlock	Labour	13519.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	859	 There are approximately 69,500 people aged under 24 on the live register.  The Minister for Finance claimed in his speech that he will make 26,000 training places available.  Therefore, we cannot force all of those people into training schemes because there are simply not enough places.  Many of those are graduates who will be over qualified for the type of training places I imagine will be envisaged under this proposal. We are now in a situation where parents, especially those in the public sector who are in the €30,000-45,000 income bracket and who have seen their incomes reduced, will see a further squeeze on their finances if they have children who have recently graduated living at home who may not fit the type of training schemes that are envisaged.  Under section 3, the Minister has already acknowledged there will be a pro rata decrease, depending on means.  I understand that the minimum amount for which somebody living at home could be eligible is about €30.  That is pocket money and it reduces the dignity of people who qualify from third level education and who continue to live at home. There are over 69,000 people aged under 24 on the live register and a significant number of them are graduates who cannot get a job.  The logical conclusion — I say this rationally and without emotion — is that many of the people to whom I refer will be obliged to migrate to some other part of the world to obtain employment. In the past ten years, Australia was the new Klondike and it was a good place for people in their early 20s to go.  However, this choice is no longer available because the employment situation in Australia is not as good as previously.  It appears Canada is the new Klondike for many people.  However, employment opportunities there will also soon dry up.  As a result, a significant number of people under the age of 25 will be obliged to reside at home with their parents.  These individuals will be obliged to survive on incomes of €30 or €40 per week and this will place an increased burden on their parents. What we needed in the budget was some degree of programming which would ensure that people would not be obliged to take up positions on Mickey Mouse courses in order to maintain their social welfare payments.  The Government should have put in place a proper, well thought out, structured programme of internships.  This would have allowed the people to whom I refer to use the knowledge and qualifications they possess. The Minister should think about things in a more lateral fashion.  If she is going to put in place schemes, these should be properly thought out.  People's entitlements should not be cut until they can be given positions on meaningful courses or be provided with internships.  If they are afforded such opportunities, it will assist them in getting back into the workplace.  My party is opposed to this amendment because it will place further hardship on low-paid parents whose sons and daughters under the age of 24 continue to live at home.

3095	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	659	 What about our old people?
3096	SeanSherlock	Labour	13523.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	685	 This Bill was drafted by a generation of politicians and mandarins who have their mortgages paid and have, for the most part, reared their children.  It shows blatant disregard for people of my generation who will end up being saddled with the burden of the economic morass in which we find ourselves for the rest of their working lives.  If we are to inject some equity into the process of economic recovery, it must be done on the basis that everybody will take the pain equally. One cannot take €1,500 from somebody in the public sector who is earning €30,000 or €1,875 from somebody who is earning €35,000, while introducing a carbon tax which will affect the ability of such people to get to and from their place of work on a daily basis.  Such people will also be affected by the impact on them of the potential mortgage increases they may incur in the future. I have a short time in which to speak on this issue.  It is a sad indictment of this Parliament that we cannot debate these measures in a proper fashion with real discourse.  The strike by the public sector was ill-timed, in that we all had to buy into the idea that there would be a reduction in the public sector pay bill.  I also believed in the bona fides of a Government and a trade union hierarchy to hammer out a deal that would ensure those earning incomes of less then €50,000 would not incur any further pain as a result of measures which might have to be implemented and those earning between €50,000 and €100,000, would have a minuscule percentage cut in their salaries and they would be benchmarked against cuts in the private sector. We have a situation whereby a single person who earns €52,000 per annum in the private sector incurs no cut to his or her salary, but somebody who earns €50,000 in the public sector will incur a cut of €3,000 or 6%.  There is no equity in such a situation.  If anybody in the Government tells us that everybody has to incur pain, the proof of that view is not evident in such budgetary measures.  I am quoting from the very document the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, laid before the House when he announced his budget last week. All we are asking for is a review of the cuts to people on the lower end of the public sector wage scales.  One cannot expect a single female clerical officer who works in a local authority, has taken out a mortgage in the past three years and now has to pay increased charges for her petrol to get to work to incur a cut of €1,500 to €2,200 in her salary.  It is completely inequitable.  I know it and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, in his heart of hearts, knows it.  I believe his words are correct, he told us to reverse the cuts would cost the Exchequer €500 million. He never examined the quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations.  He did not adequately examine those earning more than €250,000.  It is time the Government looked equitably at those who will now bear the brunt.  The new poor now exist in our society.  A person who incurs a cut of €1,500 will not be able to survive in real terms and the Government should not patronise such people by telling them it has reduced the cost of living by 6% because that will not wash.

Under the student maintenance grant schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for financial assistance where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, age, nationality and previous academic attainment.  For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students. A mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age in the year of entry to an approved course. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course. When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account. Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.  The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate for different classes of applicants. This power would enable me, if there are compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider the circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental income. Any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent mature  student will have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period before the commencement of their studies.

3100	SeanSherlock	Labour	13524.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	351	 ——-I believe we need to start slaughtering a few sacred cows in this great Republic of ours.  When somebody in the public service has to incur a cut of €1, 500 in his or her salary and a member of the Judiciary is exempt by virtue of a constitutional arrangement, that speaks volumes about the nature of the society in the Republic.  If Ireland, as a republic, is to treat and cherish everybody equally, and if we subscribe to the French principles of liberté, égalité and fraternité of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware, then we should have no qualms in these troubling times about reducing the salaries of the members of the Judiciary. I believe we are unduly deferential to people who hold such positions.  While we are respectful of the role they have and of the constitutional arrangements as regards the separation of powers, I do not believe they should be exempted from such cuts by virtue of a legal advice that has been given to the Government.  We rely too much on such legal advice matters and hold them in too great a stock, because sometimes they supersede what is fair and equitable in terms of how the common man or woman might perceive such questions.  I gladly support the amendment that has been tabled on the basis of it being equitable and right for this country at this time.

If I may, I will allow some of my time to Deputy Ferris, with whom I was to share my time.  Why do we find ourselves in circumstances where I have merely two or three minutes to discuss a princely sum that could potentially amount to €400 million? I do not have adequate time to discuss the fact that the CEO of Coillte is being paid over €400,000 at a time when the subsidiaries under Coillte are completely under-performing, nor do I have time to analyse properly the Minister of State's speech, in which he states €1.89 billion, or just under 1% of GDP, is attributed to forestry.  That figure is from 2008 but it will be reduced significantly in the future given that the subsidiaries are under-performing.  I wanted time to discuss this in greater detail. I also wanted to discuss the fact that the Forest Stewardship Council audited Coillte in 2006 and that this is not mentioned in the Minister of State's speech.  The results of the audit cast a poor light on some of Coillte's practices that are worthy of consideration in respect of this Bill.  I wanted to discuss the fact that Coillte is currently being audited by the Forest Stewardship Council.  Will the Minister expound on that process? If there is time, I will allow some to Deputy Ferris.
3108	SeanSherlock	Labour	13525.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	358	 The Bill seeks the permission of the House to afford to Coillte the opportunity to increase its statutory borrowing requirement from €101.5 million to €400 million.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister of State pointed out that inflation alone would allow an increase in the borrowing limit to €182.5 million.  This is based on inflating the €101.5 million limit in 1988 by Ireland's inflation rate up to October 2009.  Will the Minister of State give us a more detailed analysis of that assertion?  Coillte's borrowings to the end of 1988 are €161.2 million and it has approval to borrow up to €260 million under sections 24(1) and (2) of the Forestry Act 1988. The Minister of State gave a good overview of Coillte's workings, the direction it wants to take in corporate planning and the working groups established to review its operations.  There was no mention, however, of the pensions deficit, a fundamental aspect of the company's operations, or the chief executive officer's and the board's remunerations.  There are also questions surrounding a Forestry Stewardship Council report which indicted some aspects of Coillte's operations.  The Labour Party would be reluctant to support any mechanism to allow for an increase in a company's borrowing requirements unless there is some degree of transparency in its operations.  The Minister of State's Second Stage speech did not sufficiently address these matters. The company's reports and accounts also do not address these issues.  When Coillte attended the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in October, one got the impression everything was rosy in the garden.  There were, however, some difficulties for ancillary firms such as Mediate and others with the downturn in the construction industry and this was reflected in their results.  What is the future for these firms?  I do not see enough reporting back to this House on how these operations will proceed and their individual financial positions.  Is the new borrowing requirement to facilitate any of these offshoot companies?  What will the nature of their financial position be as a result of this amending legislation?  Before the House is requested to up Coillte's borrowing requirement, it requires more information as to how it does business. People tend to look favourably on Coillte's operations because of the recreational and amenity value of its work.  I have benefited from them myself in the Ballyhouras and there is a certain pride in how Coillte has developed amenities well.  With the Copenhagen summit agenda, there is the political consideration of the role of forestry in reducing or offsetting CO2 emissions.  Will the increase in permissible borrowing go towards facilitating this process?  If so, will Coillte have a significant role in that process? I would also like the Minister of State to address the issue of the role of the Forestry Stewardship Council.  It is hoped, given the 2006 report and the audit under way, that there would be significant improvement in corporate social responsibility and the role of corporate governance in respect of how Coillte performs its functions.  Fundamentally, we need a little more transparency in regard to the operations of Coillte.  While we all believe that it is a force to do good, there are aspects of its operation which, from time to time, leave doubts in one's mind.  Were the agency to be a little more transparent there would be a great deal more goodwill towards measures such as this.
3109	SeanSherlock	Labour	13525.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	378	 I refer to the issue of inflation, the 1988 Act and the Minister's response to questions put.  My understanding of the Forestry Act 1988 is that at any one time the aggregate borrowings of the company should not exceed £80 million or €101.5 million in today's money.  The Minister of State stated borrowings had reached €182.5 million in October 2009 and that this is accounted for by inflation.  Perhaps I misunderstood the legislation or I am naive but my understanding is the figures set out in the 1988 Act are finite and definitive and that there is no allowance for inflation within the 1988 Act.  Perhaps my interpretation is wrong and, if so, I will stand corrected.  If borrowings increased beyond the limit at any time between 1988 and 2009 there should have been an amendment to the 1988 Act to facilitate such a change long before now.  The importance of the point is that if the Minister of State allowed for inflation or if such a measure were not in the 1988 Act, then the Government should have amended the legislation long before now and this raises a question over any borrowings in excess of €101.5 million in the intervening period.  Will the Minister of State clarify this for my satisfaction and understanding? I refer to the Fine Gael amendment, which is reasonable because the tone of the debate from the Opposition side of the House has been such to ensure Coillte is subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny.  As we stated, Coillte was before the committee and there was no mention of potential for increasing its borrowing requirement at that stage.  That throws up a question about the role of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  When witnesses from the semi-State sector report to the committee, are they obliged, in the interests of transparency, to let members know what their strategic requirements are, particularly with regard to borrowing?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that. Questions regarding the remuneration of the chief executive officer and other high-ranking staff were not answered adequately by the Minister of State.  There is a question mark over whether the borrowings are for the purposes of remuneration or to meet deficits in the pension.  I understand the Minister of State said this would be dealt with in further legislation but it is also pertinent to this Bill, in particular, to the amendment put down by Fine Gael and supported by the Labour Party.

In no other liberal democracy would a Minister for Finance stand before the legislature and, in addressing his justification for an inquiry behind closed doors, refer in one form or another and on no less than six occasions to the global international crisis, while omitting to refer to the political climate underpinning the anatomy of the crisis or the political decisions made that were inherent to its very character. It is extraordinary that the commission of investigation will not reach into the domestic political decisions which gave rise to the crisis.  That Ministers for Finance will not be subjected to examination or held accountable for their actions is ludicrous.  I am not sure if Deputies on the Government benches are aware of how ridiculous this sounds to people. The Labour Party does not seek retribution, an issue alluded to by others, but it is entitled to seek to have answers provided in public to questions surrounding the role of the Financial Regulator.  Why was the regulator able to ride out of ""Dodge City"" with a €600,000 pay-out without being subjected to an analysis of his performance or at least some scrutiny of his decisions?  We also seek an answer in public to the question as to why Anglo Irish Bank continues to exist.  We want to know the reason analysts in the city of London were baying for a kill when a substantial shareholder in the bank could no longer cover his position.  How could one individual build up a stake of 28% in Anglo Irish Bank through numerous contracts for difference?  The hedge funds had a field day on that issue and no one in the Office of the Financial Regulator called time on the madness.  I am sure we will never know the reason because an open inquiry will not allow us to ask this very question.  Instead, we will have to continue to read the business pages of the broadsheet newspapers to glean the knowledge we so desperately need to make honest appraisals. If there is a sound economic logic for the continuance of Anglo Irish Bank, let the case be made publicly in order that those who elect us can adjudicate for themselves.  As a society we need to learn valuable lessons from this period in our economic history.  We want Ministers for Finance to be subjected to rigorous questioning in the public interest.  The only way we can achieve this is through a transparent process that stands up to political scrutiny.  By not having this inquiry in public we add to the moral turpitude that has underpinned this society for too long.  We want the facts to fit the preconceptions.  As long as a veil of secrecy exists, we will not make the changes that are necessary to move on in a real sense."

She found that the advertising process was utterly inadequate and the family had no way of benefiting from the scheme as a result.  Would the Minister acknowledge that her decision to grant compensation was based on her acknowledgement of the wrong that was done and that there was no way the family could benefit from tonnage? The Ombudsman found that some prospective applicants were put in a more advantageous position than others as they were written to by the Department and the Minister to inform them of the scheme when it was launched.  The Minister must respond on this matter.  Third, the very fact that the Ombudsman deemed it necessary to place the report before the House must be significant.

Does the Minister of State agree that a code of practice would not be worth the paper it was written on until such time as a legislative mechanism is put in place to ensure primary producers of animals and vegetables are given a fair crack of the whip in terms of securing a fair percentage of the market price for their products? The Minister of State indicated that 200 producers enjoyed a share of the €8 million provided in grant aid.  Will he provide a breakdown of the figure?  Do potato growers feature among this coterie of beneficiaries?

3131	SeanSherlock	Labour	13566.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	335	 In that review I ask the Minister of State to recognise that €1,450 is too modest a grant sum because the input cost is high enough for individual farmers who might wish to move into growing miscanthus.  If the sum were to be increased it would encourage more growers. There is no doubt about the potential of miscanthus especially for the manufacture of pellets and firelogs, as the Minister of State outlined.  Demand is growing exponentially and on an almost weekly basis.  The delay does not relate to miscanthus being brought to market but rather it revolves around trying to encourage more farmers to grow it.  The only way to achieve the latter is to provide a greater incentive at the start-up point.  I, therefore, ask that the Minister of State consider increasing the start-up grant.

However, a great deal of micromarketing is taking place in various regions — Limerick and east Cork are two examples of which I am aware — in respect of certain sectors.  Those involved in the industry have informed me that if the start-up grant paid to farmers is increased, and if a proper education process to accompany this is put in place, this will be of major assistance to local or micromarketing initiatives. With respect, we should not discuss this matter in an aspirational way.  Let us put our money where our mouth is and invest in the industry.  Miscanthus is both a carbon offset plant and a fuel source and it offers massive potential.  We should display a great deal more urgency in the context of how we promote the growing of this plant.

3144	SeanSherlock	Labour	13573.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-03 00:00:00	Prelude	696	 The Minister has not yet declared Cork an independent republic, so we are reassured. I raise this matter to highlight the potential for exploitation within the work placement programme.  I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to instigate a review of the programme to ensure this does not take place.  I understand that many employers have signed up for this scheme, under which they can employ a full-time worker for free.  It does not cost the employer a penny; the Department foots the bill by offering those who secure a place on the programme a weekly payment of approximately €200, which is considerably less than the minimum wage.  The aim of the scheme is to allow graduates and other persons to learn a new skill and gain experience, which is important in the current climate.  However, many of the job advertisements under the work placement programme specify that the candidate must be experienced and, in some cases, that he or she must be able to work unsupervised.  This defeats the purpose of the programme. There are currently over 800 work placement programme jobs listed in the FÁS jobs bank.  Among these positions are sales representatives, receptionists, caretakers, laundry operatives and construction workers.  There is a six- to nine-month training period for each of these jobs.  The question arises of whether working in a laundry for six to nine months will offer any real progression and thus whether such jobs are of any real value for graduates.  This is why I am seeking the review.  It is evident to me that the work placement programme could be used as a means of exploiting well-qualified employees by providing work that offers no real opportunity for advancement. For graduates who have no previous experience of their chosen field and who do not qualify for a social welfare payment, the work placement programme has its merits.  For others, this programme offers absolutely no benefit but actually comes at a cost when travelling expenses are deducted from the already meagre payment of €200 per week.  The only winner here is the employer, who gets a worker for up to nine months for nothing. The Minister must revisit this scheme urgently, as FÁS is giving the green light to employ staff for work under the guise of a training scheme for which candidates are grossly overqualified.  She should also consider requiring the employer to pay some salary or expenses so the person is at least earning a living wage while working a full week.  We argue that they should at least be earning the minimum wage, if that is possible.  A testimonial on the scheme was posted on www.boards.ie: “I think the work placement programme is a good idea but a person would only be earning the €196 (paid by the social welfare) for a full week’s work.  While I agree that any kind of work looks better on your CV this small amount of money has made the uptake of this programme very slow”. In essence we are seeking to prevent the exploitation of workers.  If the scheme is designed so that people can progress and use whatever skills they have to advance in the workplace, even if they are only retaining their social welfare benefits, it should be a real advance and should not be used by employers to advertise jobs that involve no real upskilling.  I hope the Tánaiste will at least review this scheme

3147	SeanSherlock	Labour	13574.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	257	" I do not want to begin with a litany of platitudes or patronising comments but we must recognise the suffering and hardship endured by the Byrne family.  We must also have regard for the loss of three crewmen and the father and uncle of Mr. Danny Byrne, the complainant.  It is important that we keep the Byrne family to the forefront of our minds when speak on this matter.  However, the manner in which the Minister of State sought to question the family's motivation is utterly degrading.  In his contribution to the debate, he stated: In the case of the family in question, no replacement vessel had been purchased and no immediate family member had continued in fishing in the 20-year period between the accident and the inception of the scheme. Given that the scheme was intended to allow families to continue a family tradition of sea fishing, it is difficult to see how it can be sustained that the family was disadvantaged by the failure of their application some 20 years later. Indeed after the sinking the family were seen, perhaps understandably, to have left the fishing industry for the subsequent 20 years. The Minister of State has no right to adjudicate on the motives of that family nor to introduce spin and revisionist views on this historical case.  I have also seen correspondence from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which sought to undermine the role of the family.  Nobody in this Chamber knows exactly what the Byrnes were going through but today we are debating the maladministration of a scheme and the Ombudsman's role in investigating it.  In the preamble to her report on the Byrne case, the Ombudsman states: ""I found that the design of the Scheme and the manner in which it was advertised were contrary to fair and sound administration.""  Let there be no attempt by anybody on the Government side of the House to undermine the family or the historical record. The matter at hand is one of natural justice and whether the Byrne family received due recognition for its complaint or an appropriate response from the agencies of the State.  As an Opposition Deputy, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, filed a complaint over the role of the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, in this affair with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  While SIPO rejected the complaint, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent's action demonstrates that certain Members who are now in Government recognised the maladministration inherent in the scheme.  The Ombudsman found the scheme to be ""seriously deficient and flawed"" and the European Commission was never informed of the scheme's existence. The Byrne family has been treated abysmally by the agents of the State, with the notable exception of the Office of the Ombudsman.  There can be no doubt that the Ombudsman dealt with the complaint in a manner that was conducive to the powers vested in her office.  However, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food clearly has decided to ensure that the family will not gain redress.  As a Legislature, we are left for only the second time in the history of this State with a scenario that has completely undermined the role of the Office of the Ombudsman. By its decision to reject the Ombudsman's findings, the Government has undermined the confidence of citizens that they can successfully resolve their complaints and severely compromised the independent statutory role vested in that office by this Legislature.  For the Labour Party, this is a case of ensuring that the organs of the State are not undermined or demeaned in any way.  We must not neglect the significance of a rejection by the Government of the Ombudsman's report.  That the report has been laid before the Houses, presumably as a last resort, speaks volumes about the contempt this Government holds for any independent arbiter whose role is laid out under statute. What hope can the ordinary citizen have that a complaint will be adjudicated upon fairly if a decision can be rejected by the Government of the day for reasons of political expediency?  The Byrne family has been subjected to the ignominy of seeing a report which offers redress and a measure of natural justice rejected for the sake of that same political expediency.  I have studied the correspondence between the Department and the Ombudsman's office.  It is clear even to a layman that the Department is engaged in a parsimonious exercise and will do anything to abdicate its responsibilities.  The Minister of State's lengthy speech clearly demonstrates that attitude.  The essence of his argument, namely, that he rejected the findings of the report out of hand, could have been expressed in ten seconds. I seek justice for the Byrne family and an acknowledgement of the Ombudsman's report.  It is insufficient to make statements on this issue.  If this House is to conduct its business properly, we must refer the report to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is critical that we afford the Ombudsman an opportunity to present her findings to that committee.  We must also be able to hear from all interested parties in order to understand the issue fully. The Ombudsman stated: My role as Ombudsman is to ensure that our public administration system deals properly and fairly with members of the public and this is a task which I am committed to fulfilling, without fear or favour, in line with the statutory authority which has been granted to my Office by the Oireachtas. My decision to make a special report in this case was not taken lightly.  It is my statutory duty under the Ombudsman Act, 1980 to decide what is fair and reasonable in relation to each complaint that comes before me.  Where a remedy is warranted I take great care to ensure that my recommendations are both appropriate and proportionate.  The credibility of any Ombudsman depends on his or her ability to deliver adequate and appropriate remedies to people who have been treated unfairly.  My investigation of the Byrne family's complaint has been painstaking and forensic.  However, in this case, despite my best efforts, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continues to dispute my findings and recommendations and I have been unable to resolve the impasse.  My only option when this arises is to seek the intervention of the Oireachtas. It now has the task of deciding who is right and who is wrong in the context of good administration and fairness to the complainant. We in the Labour Party propose that the House would adhere to the recommendations of the Ombudsman.  I accept it is not within our gift in the context of this debate to apply her findings and deliver some degree of natural justice to the family.  Accordingly, I propose that we facilitate the Ombudsman at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, so that she and her office may be afforded an opportunity to outline further her findings and to enable the members of this House to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the matter. It is vital that no one, be it an official of the Department, or a Minister or Minister of State, has the right or entitlement to subjectively question the motives of the family as to whether they would continue to fish, whether they should have read certain industry newspapers to search for advertisements, or whether that was taken as a given, because as the Minister in effect said, it was a small community and they should have known that the scheme was available.  It is not for the Minister to decide on the motivations of the family or to comment on them in 2010 in the context of a scheme that was in place from 1980 or 1981 to 1989. What is at stake is the role of the Ombudsman and the decision and findings of that office.  The Ombudsman clearly stated that there was maladministration and that the scheme was not properly advertised.  She made a decision to grant redress for the reasons outlined in the report.  The issue is whether the Government decides to take on board the views of an independent arbiter, which has a statutory function.  We are plunging ourselves into dangerous territory if we decide for the second time to reject a report of the Ombudsman. This is the tribune of the people but decisions taken by the tribune of the people have to be subjected to an independent arbiter.  We are in dangerous territory if we go the route of rejecting an Ombudsman's report.  We all have to be subject to scrutiny on decisions by branches of the State.  That is why I feel strongly that the Ombudsman must be brought before the committee so that we have another opportunity to explore further this decision."

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to allocate additional teacher/SNA posts to schools in line with my Department's policy criteria. The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of SNA allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02, are properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. It is expected that the NCSE will have completed the review by the end of March 2010. I wish to assure the Deputy that additional teaching and/or SNA support will continue to be made available to schools, including those in Co Kildare, in line with current policy criteria.

This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. It is expected that the NCSE will have completed the review by the end of March 2010. I wish to assure the Deputy that additional teaching and/or SNA support will continue to be made available to schools, including those in Co Kildare, in line with current policy criteria.

3157	SeanSherlock	Labour	13580.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	522	 In furtherance of the last point made by Deputy Rabbitte, the fact this is a windfall tax on landowners whose sons or daughters may seek to build a house near the family home in a rural area, based on a genuine housing need, is an issue that needs to be re-examined. I wish to speak specifically to the issue of the carbon tax and the permutations of that tax for the agricultural sector.  Speaking as a Deputy of the Labour Party, a party with no apparent natural ties with the agricultural sector, it could be argued that anything we may say on this subject will not always be taken seriously by those who operate within the rural economy.  I want to put on record that what is vital to the recovery of this economy is how the rural economy will thrive. The imposition of the carbon tax, for example, particularly as it pertains to marked gas oil or agricultural diesel, will have a severe impact in terms of the cost inputs for those who operate within the agricultural sector.  Be they primary producers or agricultural contractors, the very fact a tax of this nature is being levied at 8.7% when road diesel is at 4.4% will cause an undue cost impact for those who are operating within this sector, and it needs to be revised.  There is an irony to the situation.  For the multiples such as Tesco, their lorries on the road are subject to a tax of 4.4% whereas the primary producers such as the farmers who are producing for the multiples are being levied at 8.7%, which will put a further squeeze on those primary producers in terms of their ability to supply goods into the market.  This is an issue that needs to be taken on board, particularly by the Green wing of the Government, who have heralded this carbon tax as the dawn of a new age. In principle, we are all in favour of the tax, but it has to be on the basis that it is levied with some degree of equity and fairness.  I do not believe a proper analysis was undertaken of this measure before it was decided upon.  It should be revised and revisited because it has not been costed and it will have a negative impact on the very recovery that is necessary for this economy, particularly in terms of how the rural economy weighs into that recovery.  I would like a response from the Minister on this issue when he is replying to the debate. I wish to refer the Chair to an e-mail I received from a farmer who is directly impacted as a result of this proposal.  He stated: I too have no problem with CT [carbon tax] but only if it is dealt out in fair way.  To me it seems that this tax at nearly double the road % is a tax on production. ... Another concern I would have is that seeing new engines in tractors are going to cost on average between 20%-50% more than now, this tax would be a barrier to cleaner and newer emission targeted machines being used in agriculture, as people will just make do [that is to say, make do with existing machinery].  It is a fact that these newer tractors burn more fuel due to the nature of the emission recycling that goes on. ... By hook or crook everyone in agriculture will be affected by the rise, any contractor will just have to pass it on to customers, and they are finding it hard enough to get paid as it is. We need to take a more lateral view as to how the carbon tax will be implemented.  From an agricultural perspective, it is proven that agricultural incomes were down significantly in 2009 — the figures are there for everybody to see.  If one is operating a large-scale farm unit, the chances are one will be able to absorb the extra costs because one has the economies of scale to be able to do so.  However, in the case of a small farmer, such as a hillside farmer or sheep farmer on a small margin, any increase in costs of this nature could have the potential to put that farmer out of business.  We need to revise this mechanism on that basis alone. I keep coming back to the idea that if the agricultural sector is to form a part of our economic recovery, what we must not do is place an undue burden on the costs of production.  The costs of production, if one considers the overall economy, have to be the same for agriculture as they are for the lorries that supply Tesco and the other multiples, which take their primary products from those same primary producers.  We need equity in this regard. I also refer the Chair to the proposal by the Irish Farmers' Association, which stated: Farm diesel has excise duty charged at a lower rate than road diesel or petrol.  Furthermore, the rate of VAT applying is the low rate of 13.5% as compared with 21% for normal automotive fuels.  The low rate of excise duty also applies to farm diesel in other EU countries.  This demonstrates recognition by Government and at EU level that a lower rate of taxation is appropriate for farm diesel, which is exclusively used in agricultural production, than is applied to other motor fuels. Again, we need to take cognisance of the fact that agricultural diesel, by its very nature, is used on-farm and primarily for agricultural related purposes — or it should be — and, therefore, if its cost to the farmer is increased, many farmers will be wiped out, particularly those in marginal areas.  I ask the Government to revise this provision.

3159	SeanSherlock	Labour	13586.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Prelude	687	 The spectre of Abbeylara has hung over this House for some time, predating my membership.  This Bill represents an honest approach to dealing with the legalities surrounding that judgment, which would put the issue to bed once and for all in order that the legislative functions we have relative to the Executive can be dealt with in a meaningful way.  It is about time — I say this as somebody who entered the Dáil for the first time in 2007 — this issue was dealt with in a substantive way. I wish to outline some of the principal features of the Bill.  It is worth reading these into the record because they are so clear it is difficult to fathom why they would not be accepted by the Government.  The purpose of the Bill is to address a pressing need to restore the status of the Oireachtas vis-à-vis the Executive.  In particular, we need to address the view that the Supreme Court decision in the Abbeylara case has put an end to any possibility of inquiry by an Oireachtas committee.  We reject the view that, short of constitutional change, there is now no lawful means of holding a parliamentary inquiry.  We do accept, however, that legislation is required to address the defects identified by the court in that case, hence this Bill. I stand before you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a member of the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs, which has dealt with a number of bankers in recent years.  We have had the spectre of Abbeylara hanging over us in that every time a witness comes before the committee we need to be careful about how we question him or her.  The issue of compellability also loomed large over the proceedings, as Members will see if they check the records of the committee from the past number of years. Let us fast forward to the announcement by the Minister for Finance that a private inquiry would be held.  It beggars belief that the Government would hide behind a Supreme Court judgment as an excuse for not holding such an inquiry in public.  That is an affront to any Member of this House who puts his or her name on a ballot paper and seeks to represent the people.  It allows for the possibility that people who may have been responsible for undermining our banking system and our very economic structures will hide behind such a judgment as an attempt not to answer questions in a public forum — what I would call the tribune of the people.  The people demand that the issue be dealt with in a meaningful way, and this Bill does so.  I ask that the Government seriously consider accepting the Bill. It is right and proper — particularly from the point of view of the banking crisis — that Ministers for Finance, their officials, and various actors within the banking sector should be subjected to rigorous questioning in the public interest and within the public domain on the basis that the taxpayer has bailed out some of those very institutions, which have received a guarantee under the auspices of the State.  It is only right that we have such proceedings in public.  Any excuse that might be put forward by Ministers that they are restricted in doing so by virtue of a Supreme Court decision will be dealt with by this legislation, which will prevent any excuse for not having such public inquiries. It is not right or proper that somebody who is a member of the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, which has a particular remit in respect of the banking sector, would need to glean his information from the business pages of the Sunday papers.  When I read The Sunday Times or The Sunday Tribune on any Sunday, the amount of leakage on issues surrounding Anglo Irish Bank tells me that the Government is selectively talking to journalists.  That subverts the very role of a committee such as the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs — or any other committee of the House.  The Government, if it adopts a historical perspective — the Minister of State will be conscious of this — will admit that it must be seen by the people to be doing right, and the only way it can do this is by conducting its affairs in a public fashion.
3160	SeanSherlock	Labour	13586.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Prelude	702	 I raise this issue because a meeting of the northern committee of Cork County Council took place yesterday at which a decision was announced to dispose of up to 106 affordable units, under the auspices of Cork County Council, 51 of which are to be disposed of through local auctioneers and the remaining 55 through the social leasing schemes announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, some time ago. I am concerned that these houses will not sell on the open market.  There is not a snowball's chance in hell that they will sell on the open market.  There is an over supply of affordable houses within local authorities and, particularly, within the northern division of Cork County Council.  I am sceptical about any attempts by Cork County Council to use the social leasing scheme because that will come under the ambit of the housing associations.  Anybody who takes up residence in any of those 55 houses which come under the social leasing scheme will never have an opportunity to purchase those houses.  Any person who may be on an affordable housing list and who may be eligible for financing will not consider going down that road if it means that for the duration of that lease he or she cannot own the house.  I am also of the view that the 51 houses it is proposed to sell on the open market will not be sold. I propose that there must be a greater degree of flexibility on the part of the Minister when dealing with local authorities in respect of housing issues.  If the 106 houses to which I refer were advertised as rent-to-buy type lettings, they could then be occupied, which is extremely important.  After two or three years, the occupants could then decide whether they wished to purchase those houses. In one estate in the Mitchelstown area there are 20 houses, ten of which will be disposed of through the social leasing scheme while the other ten will be disposed of through the affordable housing scheme.  For every day these houses remain unoccupied, problems arise in the estate to which I refer.  If its is left to auctioneers to try to sell these houses in a market in which no one is buying, I contend that they will remain unoccupied for some time. I put it to the Minister of State that a degree more flexibility and lateral thinking would provide people who are living in the area with the opportunity to rent those houses.  They could do so through the social housing schemes or through a rent-to-buy scheme, under which they could eventually decide to buy if the opportunity arose.  This would constitute a more common-sense and practical approach to dealing with the issue of unoccupied houses in certain estates.

3163	SeanSherlock	Labour	13593.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	319	 This is an issue of fairness and connectivity.  Those who benefit from this route do not have their own means of transport.  As most of them are isolated, they rely on the route to access essential services they cannot access other than through Bus Éireann.  Many of those who travel on the 366 route cannot avail of a supplementary service under the rural transport programme.  We are seeking to achieve the retention of the service in some way, even if it means a reduction in the service to one day a week.  We strongly believe this route should be subject to a public service obligation.  It was put in place to supplement the loss of railway infrastructure.  While that may be deemed to be an historical debate, the principle still applies.  If this route is taken away, a significant number of people, most of whom are elderly, will be cast further into isolation.  A lady who attended one of my clinics two weeks ago was visibly upset about the loss of this route.  When one speaks about access to services, one always wishes to bear in mind the notions of a national spatial strategy and intergenerational solidarity.  If we are to axe routes that allow for connectivity, we will do a disservice to older people.  We will marginalise those who do not have their own transport and therefore rely heavily on services of this nature as they travel to where they want to go each day.

3165	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	470	" I move amendment No. 1: In page 5, line 2, to delete ""2 years"" and substitute ""1 year"". I am making the same arguments here as I did on Committee Stage.  Looking at the legislation in the main, it is about the transposition of a directive which was completed in 2006.  We have to look at the historical perspective and the fact that the directive was initiated as a result, in particular, of the Madrid bombings.  It was a counter-terrorism response relating to that period.  We are now in a situation where a number of years have past and we are moving towards the final transposition of that directive now.  Our view is that some of the provisions in the Bill are excessive, particularly in relation to the length of time for which data must be retained. The Minister of State's justification for the Government's position vis-à-vis the two-year retention period for telephony and the one-year retention period for Internet data is on the basis of security and counter-terrorism measures, as well as the detection of crime.  We in the Labour Party understand that rationale and would not argue against it.  In principle, we are not against the retention of data and believe that the directive must be transposed.  However, we take issue with the manner in which it is being transposed and the length of time for which data must be retained, particularly in relation to ISP and telephone records, because we believe this will place an undue burden on business and that the costs could be prohibitive and reduce any future comparative advantage Ireland might gain through the Internet and telecommunications sectors. I refer to the historical context of the transposition of a directive dating back to 2006 and any subsequent legislation enacted that has dealt with counter-terrorism or crime prevention measures more than adequately, including the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act and the recently passed Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act.  The Labour Party is examining the permutations of the Government's position, especially vis-à-vis the cost implication.  I submit that placing on Internet service providers, ISPs, and telephony companies an obligation to store data for two years would result in an undue cost burden and would not have an impact on crime prevention in real terms or in terms of detection.  I refer to the Minister’s submission on Committee Stage.  He stated that the 12 month detention period for Internet data is very much in the mainstream and this is significant because the Internet is a relatively new technology.  He further stated that it is accepted that the vast majority of disclosure requests which would arise as a result of the legislation relate to data less than three months old. If the requests for data are, to use the words of the Minister on Committee Stage, for data less than three months old, then I submit that the Labour Party amendment, which seeks to substitute two years for one year and one year for six months, would be in line with his thinking in respect to the prosecution of a crime or any investigation pertinent to committing a crime.  I further submit that if the legislation is passed and data is to be retained for two years hence, then on this day in two years time, that is, on 23 February or 24 February 2012, if someone were to be investigated for a crime then I suggest any telephone call made on today's date, the content of which is unknown, or if a person logged on to a website in the intervening period of one year hereafter, it would impact in no way on whether one could suitably detect that any such communication was pertinent to any crime committed.  The approach of the Government in terms of transposing the directive is that of a sledge-hammer being used to crack a nut. I reiterate that we are not against the principle of data storage.  We agree the directive must be transposed but we maintain the time periods are excessive and, contrary to the Minister's statement on Committee State to the effect that the legislation is in line with the mainstream, we believe it is against the European mainstream and that other countries have transposed the directive on the basis of time periods more in line with the proposal contained in the Labour Party amendment."
3166	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	570	 I am aware of one Defence Forces member who missed his opportunity for promotion because his final medical examination could not take place for reasons beyond his control.  The former Minister for Defence was well aware of the case.  Given the Minister of State's response, perhaps the case could be re-examined.
3167	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	576	 Article 6 of the directive allows for telephone and Internet data to be retained for a minimum of six months and a maximum of two years.  We all accept the principle of the retention of data and each state is at liberty to choose where on that scale it pitches its obligatory data retention provision.  The norm is as per the Labour Party position set down in these amendments.  There is no contradiction between being in favour of the principle of the retention of data and being against what the Government proposes.  If one puts an onus on Internet service providers and telephony companies to retain data, they must retain all Internet related traffic for a period of two years.  If one is investigating a crime, one cannot speak to the content of the data.  If I use my Gmail account to e-mail someone, who is subsequently charged with a crime, one can only state that correspondence took place between me and the other person but one does not have access to the content.  Why would one impose a cost beyond 12 months on a telephony company or an Internet service provider if one can merely deduce that communication took place without having access to the content?  Let us consider the examples of social networking sites such as Bebo, Facebook and Twitter and web-based e-mail accounts such as Hotmail.  The Minister of State cannot argue that this measure will not place a cost burden on these providers because every single piece of traffic must be stored somewhere.  I imagine the vast bulk of it will be stored outside the confines of the State because many of these Internet service providers are international companies and have specific storage facilities.  However, it will increase the cost burden for those who operate in Ireland, such as Irish companies with storage facilities here.  By increasing the cost burden, one must consider whether it will be pertinent to the solving of a crime thereafter.  The argument of the Labour Party is that it will not. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State commented: The significance of this is that Internet is a relatively new technology.  It is accepted that the vast majority of disclosure requests [the requests that will arise from the vested officers] are for data less than three months old. If the vast majority of disclosure requests are for data less than three months old, the position of the Labour Party is that the measure exceeds that which the Minister of State stated on Committee Stage.  That is the logic behind the two amendments we have tabled.

When oral requests are made they should be done expeditiously and properly and, if this law is to be passed and disclosure requests are made, we want to ensure that the procedure is so tight, there can be no ambiguity as regards the processing such requests, so that this does not become subject to question thereafter in a court of law or by other means.  We want to ensure the procedure is watertight."
3172	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	585	 I accept the Minister of State's response.
3173	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	586	" I move amendment No. 5: In page 6, to delete lines 43 and 44 and substitute the following: ""7.—A provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope in that the request is not so wide as to place an undue cost on the service provider."". There are suggestions that the telecommunications industry, through various submissions it has made, would request that this should be brought into the legislation.  The amendment is self-explanatory.  We are asking that a provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope — in that the request is not so wide as to place an undue cost on the service provider. Again, with reference to the cost burden, if, for instance a designated officer should make a disclosure request, there has to be a reasonable approach to this.  If, for instance, the request trawls so wide as to be entirely non-specific and take up a large amount of time, then this will obviously place a burden on the relevant ISP or telephone company.  If a disclosure request is as wide-ranging as a chief superintendent determines it should be, then we must be mindful of the cost to the service provider in yielding up that information. I know the Minister of State will argue to the effect that disclosure requests are needed and there has to be discretion on the part of the chief superintendent.  Nonetheless, I believe the request has to be targeted and some degree of scope must be allowed for as regards the ISP or telephone company.  That is fundamentally what I am addressing here."
3174	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	588	 To my mind, the memorandum of understanding referred to by the Minister of State on Committee Stage is not on a statutory footing.  Section 7 states that service providers shall comply with a disclosure request made to them.  It is important the views of the telcos and the ISPs, Internet service providers, are acknowledged.  One of the parties to the memorandum of understanding is the ISPAI, Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland.  It made a submission on the Bill and stated section 7 was far too wide and unwieldy and takes no account of what is reasonable, technically possible and not very expensive.  Its recommendation is that a service provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to it only where it is technically possible.  I take on board the views expounded by the Minister of State but the reality is that we do not know for sure how many requests will be made by a designated officer.  We do not know for what purposes such requests will be made, against whom they will be made or the reasons why they may be made.  If we accept in good faith what the Minister of State is saying, then we deduce requests will only be made in respect of taxation or an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners, a chief superintendent or an officer of the law. I refer to the Bills' digest, a very good document published by the Oireachtas Library service.  It states that under the Bill an individual can only find out that data relating to him or her is accessed on foot of a disclosure request by first making a request on the basis that they believe the data has been accessed.  This veers somewhat from the point of the amendment but I seek to nail down the idea that there is a clear focus in respect of how the legislation is used.  We may agree that one must retain data and that such data can be pertinent to solving a crime but we have no wish for anyone to flout the purpose of the legislation for their own ends.  We have no wish for anyone to make nefarious requests for disclosure and trawl with the net so wide such that it would put a cost on the ISPs and such that a service provider is spending resources for something that may not be for the detection of a crime or for which the legislation is designed.  I wish to put down a marker in this respect and I intend to press the amendment.
3175	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	591	 Do we know who the responsible judge would be in respect of this oversight?  How has that system been used?  Has the judge used this provision in respect of other legislation?  My understanding is that provision is also relates to the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages and the oversight is pertinent with regard to that legislation.  I am given to understand reports are rubber-stamped in respect of how that provision works, without any qualitative analysis of the provision in question.  I am unconvinced that the oversight mechanism in this legislation would be used as designated.  I suspect that the oversight provision will end up simply being rubber-stamped as per other legislation and that we will not know in real terms whether the legislation will be flouted or abused by certain persons.  It is open to abuse regardless of whether one accepts the bona fides of a chief superintendent or any other designated officer.  That is the point we want the Minister of State to clarify.  I want to ensure disclosure requests are made only where it is technically possible and reasonable and that the oversight mechanism will be subject to proper scrutiny.
3176	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	593	 Yes.
3177	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	598	" I move amendment No. 6: In page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following: ""(5) A report under this section shall contain details of the numbers of prosecutions actually commenced as a result of investigations to which requests related, and a detailed justification for any significant excess of numbers of requests over numbers of prosecutions actually commenced."". This is another strengthening provision and it seeks to ensure that the law will not be flouted in any way.  It speaks to the theme of amendment No. 5. Bearing in mind the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, the current reporting format is inadequate, even if there is judicial oversight.  If one examines some of the reports and documents arising from the oversight procedure, one will see they contain a single paragraph stating records regarding the legislation have been examined by a judge.  That is all they state.  We do not want similar circumstances obtaining regarding the legislation under discussion. We would like to have included a provision seeking to examine the nature of the disclosure requests.  If a request is made and leads to a criminal offence or prosecution, there would be some justification for the provision.  However, if there were a large number of disclosure requests made but no correlation between those requests and subsequent prosecutions, it would provoke questions.  There is always a need for some form of qualitative analysis to ensure legislation is working properly and fit for purpose.  That is why the Labour Party is saying a detailed report should be made. Oireachtas Library and Research Service documentation states an individual can only find out if data relating to him or her has been accessed on foot of a disclosure request by first making a request on the basis that he or she believes the data have been accessed.  That is a fairly serious provision.  The reporting procedure could redress such a disparity in the Bill.  If one does not know that a disclosure request has been made about one, one has no way to access the referee or other such designated person.  Perhaps the Minister has a view on that.  If my understanding of the provision is wrong, I will openly acknowledge it but the amendment will ensure that the legislation is not used for nefarious purposes, that it is fit for purpose and that it is used in a manner to ensure that somebody cannot trawl widely for a disclosure request and do so for purposes other than expediting justice."
3178	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	600	 The Minister of State offered the example of a Mr. Ryan, so I will continue to use that example.  He also referred to the requirements of the directive and the terms under which data must be submitted to the Commission.  I accept that point.  However, if we are discussing the rights of this Mr. Ryan in respect of whom disclosure is requested, under the Bill Mr. Ryan can only find out if a disclosure request has been made by first making a request to the Data Protection Commissioner on the basis that he believes that personal data has been accessed.  If the data relating to Mr. Ryan has been accessed, there is no analysis after the fact.  If nothing arises from the disclosure and Mr. Ryan is innocent, there is nothing in the analysis thereafter that allows Mr. Ryan to know that a disclosure request was made about him by one of the designated officers.  The reporting mechanism to the Commission does not allow for that either. We are trying to ensure that if Mr. Ryan is not prosecuted, a report under this section will contain details of the numbers of prosecutions actually commenced as a result of investigations to which requests related and detailed justification for any significant excess in numbers of requests.  If no prosecution is taken against Mr. Ryan, it could be argued that it is an excess.  That must be quantifiable as well.  I know I am repeating myself but I am trying to strike a balance between what is appropriate and inappropriate use of the disclosure request in the first instance to ensure that in the case of people who are innocent parties and against whom disclosure requests are made, the State, because of a reporting procedure, 12 months after the enactment of the Bill would be able to note an inordinately large amount of disclosure requests from a particular source about a certain person where no action has arisen from them.  It is right to have a method by which we can question that process. I might be overly pedantic about this but we must prevent nefarious use of the law.  That is my objective.
3179	SeanSherlock	Labour	13594.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	602	" Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify and acknowledge whether the Bill states an individual can already find out if data relating to him or her has been accessed on foot of a disclosure request.  That provision is already open to the person.  Amendment No. 6 includes the statement: ""A report under this section shall contain details of the numbers of prosecutions actually commenced as a result of investigations.""  The Minister and I will differ on this amendment and I will conclude my deliberations on it."

The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that some balance is brought into the question of how to deal with a minor breach of section 6.  If there is a breach, the user will be notified and may be compensated, but if any prosecution is to be quashed as a result of the destruction of the evidence on the orders of the Data Protection Commissioner, there must be some consideration of the rights of the victim concerned.  That is the justification."

This is a technical amendment.  Others more learned than I advised that it be made.  We tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage which the Minister rejected.  On reflection, the Minister's reply to our amendment highlighted a further problem, namely, that there is a contradiction between the reference to section 1 in line 10 and the reference to a number of Acts in line 11.  The reference in section 1 means that we should refer to the 1889 Act in the singular.  As only individual Acts have sections, we have tabled a revised wording on Report Stage."

3206	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	367	" I move amendment No. 5: In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: """"maximum fine"", in respect of a specified amount or within a specified range, includes a fixed fine of that amount or within that range;"". The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that amounts of fines specified in the Bill can be varied by order so that the Bill does not get out of date.  That is the effective justification."
3207	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	369	" I move amendment No. 6: In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: """"Oireachtas"" includes the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann."". The purpose of the amendment is self-explanatory.  It requires the Minister to include the words ""Saorstát Éireann"" in the wording."
3208	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	371	" I move amendment No. 7: In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: ""(2) The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, by order, vary the amounts of money specified in subsection (1) from time to time having regard to changes in the value of money since the commencement date.”."
3209	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	373	" I move amendment No. 8: In page 4, line 17, after ""enactment"" to insert ""amended by or"". The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarity and avoid any constitutional difficulty in respect of the offences to which the section applies.  Clearly, it would be legally improper to impose the new penalties on persons convicted after the commencement date for an offence committed before the commencement date.  The European Convention on Human Rights expressly states that a higher penalty than the penalty enforced at the material time of the offence cannot be imposed on a person.  This amendment will avoid any challenge based on this point by making clear that the new penalties will only apply to offences committed on, or after, the commencement date."
3210	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	375	 It could be argued that the existing Bill is ambiguous, in that it does not state clearly whether it refers to the conviction or the offence that occurred before the commencement date.  It is a matter of trying to tighten up the wording.  That is our approach.
3211	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	377	 I appreciate the Minister's response and will withdraw the amendment on that basis.
3212	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	378	" I move amendment No. 9: In page 4, line 17, to delete ""after"" and substitute ""on or after""."
3213	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	381	 I appreciate the Minister's response and will withdraw my amendments.
3214	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	383	" I move amendment No. 12: In page 4, line 26, after ""fine"" to insert ""of or""."
3215	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	385	" I move amendment No. 14: In page 4, line 28, after ""offence"" to insert ""committed""."
