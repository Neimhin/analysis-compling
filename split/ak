10727	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I welcome the delegation.  How many credit unions are on the books of the ICB?
10728	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 In terms of loan data held, Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh refers to historical indicators and a rotating window of 24 months.  What does he mean by that?
10729	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	 In effect, the Irish Credit Bureau is the vessel which institutions which are members will go through in terms of loan histories and so on.  If I understand Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh correctly, there could a person who, for example, hits a snag in the last two to three years, which is what is invariably happening, despite having had a perfect credit history for the previous ten or 15 years, and this is taken into account and the ICB's systems are designed in such a way as to allow for this eventuality.  In other words, a person may have a very good credit history but then hits difficulties and the system would take that up on an overall basis when assessing the person.
10730	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	 What one wants to see, if it is put on a statutory footing, is that the system and its underpinning assumptions do not militate against somebody who is ordinarily very compliant in terms of his or her repayments but who may hit the wall at some stage during his or her repayment schedules.  My main fear concerns those I have referred to MABS or who would have had dealings with credit unions. What I have found is that credit unions have acted as a type of lender — I will not call it a lender of last resort, but they have cushioned people who have dodgy credit histories against moneylenders, who are largely unregulated.  I have seen situations in which credit unions have kept the wolf from the door for certain people with bad credit histories.  What I am anxious to find out is whether the Irish Credit Bureau's system will take that into account or see it as a mitigating factor.
10731	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	 I accept the point. How many moneylending organisations, which charge rates of up to 100%, are on the books of the Irish Credit Bureau?
10732	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 What would be the implications of putting all this on a statutory footing?  It would obviously increase the bureau's operations significantly.
10733	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	 What is Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's view on that?
10734	SeanSherlock	Labour	13726.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 The bureau is not a statutory body, so Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh can speak freely.

10743	SeanSherlock	Labour	13810.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	 I will be brief.  I welcome Mr. Guiomard and his colleagues.  With regard to the cost of €2.33 per passenger on top of the Government passenger taxi, what is Mr. Guiomard's opinion on whether we are screwing passengers to the wall with regard to infrastructure, at a time when we are trying to get more people to use Irish airports on either short term or long term visits?  Is there scope for a reduction in that figure even further?  In the current climate by reducing that figure is it the case that financing is being tacked out for a longer period to encourage more throughput through the airports? My second question relates to the travellers' protection fund.  Is there a projected figure for 2011?  The size of the fund has decreased from €7.5 million to €5.5 million.  I take it there has been a number of failures - 19 failures according to the commission's submission.  Is the commission projecting further failures within that sector and what contingencies are in place to account for that possibility? I refer to the potential merger of the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the National Transport Authority.  What kind of synergy is envisaged by the commission in terms of its role in that equation?  I presume if there is synergy there will be doubling up of resources and personnel.  What are the projections as to possible efficiencies in light of such a merger?  Will Mr. Guiomard give details of the nature and outcome of the 300 passenger complaints?
10744	SeanSherlock	Labour	13810.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	 To have some clarity on this point, I wish to ask another question.  I understand this is the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  I ask Mr. Guiomard to correct me if I am wrong but in layman's terms I imagine that the ability to maximise throughput is part of the commission's remit.  Is there scope for the regulator to seek to influence Government with regard to the annual throughput of passengers through the airport and how the charging mechanism affects that rate?  I take Mr. Guiomard's point about the charging mechanism and I make the distinction between a Government policy and what is within the remit of the commission.  However, I would like to see regulators expressing opinions as to what needs to be done to get more punters through Irish airports.  If Mr. Guiomard could step outside the comfort zone and give the committee an opinion, I do not think anybody will come down on him like a ton of bricks.  I make that comment with due regard to respecting his position.

10751	SeanSherlock	Labour	13831.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	" I welcome Ms Doyle and her colleague to the committee.  What is the surplus income this year and for what is it being used?  Was part of the surplus income used to produce the booklet presented before this committee today?  I received a copy of the proposals and the presentation by e-mail and do not understand, therefore, given the times we are in, how anybody could justify a spend on an elaborate, glossy presentation such as the one we have here.  I do not want to sound ‘holier than thou' about it, but we are all attuned to electronic media and I find this ridiculous. Ms Doyle stated an ""equilibrium"" of 25,811 licences had been reached.  How did she ascertain we have reached an equilibrium level, particularly when countless numbers of taxi drivers say there is over supply of licences in the market?  She acknowledged that between 2005 and 2008 real income reduced by 5% and says there has been a further reduction since 2008.  I represent a constituency with an urban rural mix, and given the number of taxi drivers who approach me with queries as to how they can obtain supplementary welfare income from the Department of Social Protection in lieu of income they are no longer earning, I suggest the reduction in income is far more stark than 5% or whatever the current figure is on reduction in earnings.  The key issue is that taxi drivers with a licence are no longer making a living out of their licences.  If I was to speak for drivers in smaller towns like Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, I would suggest there is an over-supply of licences within regional areas outside of the larger metropolitan areas and that the drivers are not able to make a living.  Perhaps the point is that it is not their divine right to earn a living from taxi driving, but if there were some control or greater control over the number of licences issued full-time drivers who are trying to put food on the table might be able to make some kind of living without having to supplement their income with income from the Department of Social Protection.  What are the delegates' views on this? I understand the Competition Authority will have a separate view on licence numbers and competition but I fail to see how the Taxi Regulator can say we have reached equilibrium.  I hope I did not misunderstand the regulator in this regard. Reference was made to regulatory impact analyses.  What is involved in the regulatory impact analysis of 25,000 licences in terms of the ability of the drivers to make a living?  Is the latter factored in?  The regulator stated she had carried out studies on real earnings.  If so, she is considering sociological aspects or the economic cost of having an over-supply of licences or a set supply of licences.  Did the regulatory impact analysis take into account the qualitative cost to individual licensees of having so many licences in the market at present? I acknowledge we are experiencing an economic downturn and that there may be a downturn in business between Thursday to Saturday night.  In my town, Mallow, for instance, 40 or 50 licence holders ply for trade on a relatively small rank on a Thursday afternoon.  It is ridiculous and not sustainable.  Where does one draw the line?  Does one continue to say that any applicant who fulfils all the criteria should get a licence or does one say that a town such as Mallow has enough licences and that no more should be issued?  This applies to every town of Mallow's size."

10754	SeanSherlock	Labour	13831.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	11	 Ms Doyle stated the regulatory impact is control over numbers through the establishment of rules to modify behaviour.  The Taxi Regulator will continue to regulate the industry.  Although there is a dip in numbers at present, they will probably increase in the longer term.  Something will have to give at some stage.  The current number is not sustainable.  Nobody wanted a closed shop in the taxi industry.  While there should be equilibrium between supply and demand, the regulator is referring to a false equilibrium because the number of drivers is not the optimum.  Bearing in mind geographical variations, the dogs in the street know there are too many licences.  People will say anecdotally one can get a taxi in Dublin at 4 a.m. on a Saturday and that one might not have been able to do so previously, but one must ask how this can be balanced with the over-supply in towns such as Mallow, Tralee and Killarney.  There are drivers fighting each other for spaces on the main street.  This Government and the next will have to take that into account.  Surely the regulator will have to make a statement or adopt some position on supply and over-supply.

10759	SeanSherlock	Labour	13853.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 I welcome Professor Honohan and his colleagues to the committee.  It is good we are having this frank and open discussion. Professor Honohan referred to burdensome mortgage debt, the buy-to-let category and the policy challenges arising from this.  Will he give a more unambiguous view as to how active policy interventions can assist those ordinary mortgage holders at risk of defaulting?  While I understand the points about capital adequacy ratios and the 5% write-off provision, the language used in describing this problem should be less abstract and provide some comfort for those mortgage holders pinned to their collars. David McWilliams and others have posited the notion of debt forgiveness for mortgage holders.  Is that a tenable proposal?  Has the Central Bank information on private banks' bad debt provisions for residential mortgages?  Is there an oversight mechanism in place for the various stages of default from a mortgagee moving to interest-only payments to actual arrears? A report in last week's edition of The Sunday Tribune stated the European Central Bank holds €18 billion in Irish sovereign bonds, 20% of the total debt.  For how long more will it keep purchasing Irish debt?  Are we wholly reliant on it now? We are trying to get a picture of how austerity measures and achieving growth will help get us out of the economic morass in which we find ourselves.  It goes back to the language used in these discussions which is often suitably vague.  I will have to go back and read some of Professor Honohan's answers three times to interpret them and read between the lines.  Clear and unambiguous statements on the economy are needed not just for the committee but also for the wider audience.

10769	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	 I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to discuss the proposed resolutions from the Dáil and Seanad approving the draft of the order which I will be proposing. The order seeks to reserve 32 places in the first year of the Bachelor of Education degree course in the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or belong to the broad Protestant tradition. The making of the order and its laying before the Houses arises from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and is designed to ensure that the rights and interests of colleges and schools with a Protestant ethos and the students of those schools are provided for. The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination on a wide-range of grounds, including religion. While the Act deals primarily with discrimination in employment it also extends to discrimination in vocational training. Vocational training is defined as any system of instruction that enables a person to acquire the knowledge for the carrying of an occupational activity. Teacher-training falls within this definition. For many years, the Church of Ireland College of Education has provided training in primary school teaching only to students who come from the Church of Ireland and the broader Protestant tradition. The purpose of this practise is to ensure that there is available to schools under Protestant ownership a sufficient number of teachers who themselves come from a Protestant background and are trained in an institution with a Protestant ethos. Most primary schools in the State are privately owned, publicly funded denominational schools. This system of denominational education is underpinned by the Constitution. Central to the right of the religious denominations to conduct schools with a particular ethos is their need to ensure that they have available to them a body of staff belonging to and trained in the particular religious denomination of the school. If such staff were not available, the constitutional right to free profession of religion and the conduct of denominational schools would be seriously impaired. To avoid imposing what would in effect be unconstitutional restrictions on the rights of the religious denominations in this regard section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which prohibits discrimination in vocational training, makes two exceptions. It provides that the prohibition of discrimination does not apply for the purpose of ensuring the availability of nurses and teachers to denominational hospitals and primary schools respectively. In the case of primary schools the section provides that an educational or training body may apply to the Minister for Education and Skills for an order permitting the body to reserve places on the vocational training course. The Minister for Education and Skills, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, may then make an order allowing the body to reserve such number of places to meet the need for teachers in primary schools as is considered appropriate. The Church of Ireland College of Education has made an application on behalf of the college for the reservation of 32 places in the college for the academic years 2013-14 up to 2017-18 for students who are members of recognised churches in the Protestant tradition. The college makes the case that the reservation of 32 places, which is currently the full complement of first year places in the college, should be made in order to provide sufficient teachers for Protestant schools over the next number of years. The grounds for the request as put by the college are as follows: the necessity of providing a sufficient number of qualified primary teachers to maintain the distinctive ethos of Protestant schools remains the central concern and motivation for seeking the order; primary schools in the Protestant community depend almost exclusively on the college for the provision of an annual supply of well qualified teachers from a Protestant background; a reported continuing shortage of applicants for teaching positions in Protestant primary schools, particularly small schools in rural areas; some of those who enter the college will not complete their studies and of those who qualify some will not take up posts in schools with the Protestant ethos; also, a number of graduates go to live and work abroad while others engage in further studies. I believe, in the circumstances set out by the college, the continuing reservation of 32 places in the college for students from the Protestant tradition appears reasonable to ensure that Protestant schools have available to them a sufficient number of teachers who share their value system and religious beliefs. Apart from the constitutional requirements from which this order flows, the order is a necessary support for the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and Irish society. Given that schools with a Protestant ethos represent only a small minority of primary schools in the State, there is clearly a risk that that ethos could be diluted unless specific protections are provided. This order puts in place a protection which the Oireachtas considered appropriate and which will guarantee Protestant schools that they can continue to provide education for their students in accordance with their particular values and beliefs. I acknowledge that some aspects of the environment in which the Church of Ireland College of Education operates are changing. I refer in this regard specifically to developments in relation to school patronage and the work underway on the restructuring of teacher education provision in Ireland. However, there is a continuing need for this provision to be made. The primary legislation governing the order provides that it may be revoked and any effects of these developments on the necessity for the order will be kept under review. I thank the committee for its consideration of this important issue, which safeguards and supports the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and Irish society.
10770	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 Deputy McConalogue's first question was about places and all 32 places have been taken and it has happened three times. I did not really understand the third question and perhaps I misheard it. There is a philosophical element in this, I suppose, and if I am reading the interventions by Deputies Ó Ríordáin, Collins and Bannon correctly, there seems to be an issue with whether the State should provide wholly for education of primary and post-primary levels, or if there should be what could loosely be called a subvention for provision at schools where there is a particular religious ethos. We are all aware of the particular provision proposed here, which is to ensure we can guarantee the teaching ethos through the Protestant tradition. We would not necessarily disagree with that. Speaking personally, one could argue that religious formation for any citizen could take place through a Sunday school mechanism or outside normal teaching hours. Nevertheless, the State provides for a number of hours, which is probably a vagary of our history of a strong Catholic ethos with other minority religions. The education sector in Finland has 97% of schools within the state sector and religious formation is extraneous to the process. The majority of the schools are within the public sphere. Ireland is a particular country with a specific history and traditions, so there is an historical narrative in that regard. It is a question of where we are moving. Are we looking to divest ourselves of any State intervention with schools of a particular ethos? That is a particular philosophical question with which we must grapple. I have a particular policy responsibility for science, technology, engineering and maths, and if members are asking me whether I believe we should spend more time in schools teaching in those areas than preparing for certain aspects of religious formation, I know I would prefer to invest the time in teaching core subjects. That is a personal opinion. I sense from the committee that there is no difficulty with the provision being proposed. In response to Deputy Bannon, there is no different set of rights. We are recognising a minority ethos and ensuring it is protected in terms of pedagogy, teaching and ensuring the supply of teachers, and we are doing it in a structured way.

Some will go to Educate Together schools and some have even gone to Roman Catholic schools. It is about ensuring the need is met on a continuing basis. That is the fundamental aspect of this.
10772	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 The restructuring of teacher education colleges throws up vagaries. For example, with regard to the DCU ethos, if one is mapping-----

10775	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Absolutely. Fundamentally, our objective is to ensure that every ethos is provided for specifically.
10776	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 That is the fundamental tenet of this provision. In any restructuring of teacher training colleges, for example, no single entity or ethos is excluded. I believe that is the point the Senator was making.
10777	SeanSherlock	Labour	14805.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-06-19 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 Yes. Historically, teacher training was very much aligned to particular traditions, even within the Catholic ethos. There were varying traditions in distinct geographical locations. Personally, I believe we must move to a teacher training paradigm that is more reflective of Irish society and more pluralist in its approach, while ensuring there are inherent guarantees for a minority ethos that probably needs a certain protection. This is evolving. As Irish society evolves, the restructuring of teacher training evolves. Even the debate about patronage is evolving. There has never really been a big debate in Ireland about patronage. It is about parents looking at their own religious beliefs and where they want their children to go in terms of religious formation-----

I apologise if I have not. Deputy Ó Ríordáin mentioned the issue of sexuality and equality. That does not have a bearing on this provision in terms of the equality Act, as I understand it. One's sexuality is a matter for one's self. I hope I understood correctly the point he was making. It has no bearing on this provision.

10789	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	66	 Quinn Insurance Limited arrived in an insurance market inhabited by an old boys' network.  Quinn Insurance Limited opened up the sector and that is to be welcomed.  What comes across in the submissions is that the Quinn Group is hungry for new business and this means new jobs in the regions we are talking about.  I represent Cork East, in which Fermoy is located.  I visited the branch in the Eastgate Business and Retail Park in Cork.  Quinn Group employees have massive loyalty to the group and having a coterie of loyal employees means people want to strive for new business.  I realise the constraints on us because of the difficulty in making a direct political intervention as a result of the new culture with regard to the regulatory framework.  However, facilitating the Quinn Group making its case means that the regulator is listening.  I have a particular interest in Quinn Healthcare.  I would like to get a sense of the permutations of today's announcement and what this means within other businesses in the Quinn Group.  Quinn Healthcare is a highly profitable business and has slaughtered many sacred cows in terms of the old boys' network that existed within that business.  It continues to have to pay €39 million per year to keep another company afloat.  Will today's announcement have an impact on other businesses in the Quinn Group?  It would be a shame if the current system had a negative impact on other businesses.  That would be unnecessary and is preventable.

10793	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	16	" My questions relate to the sugar industry.  I hail from the town of Mallow.  When the court's report was issued, it was met with utter devastation, disgust and complete surprise, even in view of what other Members have stated here today.  The report, which is comprehensive, states ""the audit found that in one MS [member state] the only producer, which before the sugar reform had undertaken a consolidation/rationalisation of its processing facilities and defined itself as one of Europe's most efficient producers, closed down its large, modern and potentially efficient sugar factory justifying their decision on the risk of the lower prices reducing the supply of sugar beet to an uneconomic level"".  I am unsure whether the following quote comes from Mr. O'Shea but as per the RTE news on the day of the publication of the report, a quote attributed to Mr. O'Shea stated that it is possible the Greencore plant would still be operating today if it were not for the sugar reforms introduced by the European Commission. I seek a confirmation of what has been stated already in the report.  Did this so-called reform of the sugar industry meet its targets?  If it did not meet its targets is there a possibility, notwithstanding the fact that we are not to produce sugar in this country until 2017, that it can be revisited in light of the fact that the European Court of Auditor's report clearly states that the regime did not set out to do what it was supposed to do.  The use of the word ""reform"" is thorny because it is a loaded term as well.  It was not a reform and clearly it did not work.  The growers and the workers who lost their jobs wish to know where now for the report?  What is the import of it?  Will it work its way into the ether?  Are we left with the political entrails of it?  Is there hope that we could glean from the report the potential to rekindle the industry? I to refer to the summary in the report.  Point II states the objectives of the reform were ""to ensure the competitiveness of the EU sugar industry"".  That has not been achieved because we now have a cartel and 75 factories have closed with 20,000 jobs lost throughout the European Union.  Will the delegation inform the committee how many we are left with?  I believe there are only a handful operating within France, Germany and perhaps others countries.  The French and Germans have now created a cartel in the production of sugar in the European Union.  A layman's view is that if the European Court of Auditor's report is to mean anything there should be a reversal of this trend and peripheral countries such as Ireland should be able to get back into the market not only for sugar production for confectionary or other purposes but also for the production of ethanol to meet our bio-fuel obligations under EU legislation.  I would like to get the opinion of the witnesses on the matter and I apologise if my question is not strictly relevant to the business before us."
10794	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	52	 Mr. O'Shea stated the purpose of the Court of Auditors is to set down a marker now on what to do or what not to do in the future.  There is a tacit expression in the report that the Commission - I do not want to speak in the vernacular - made a complete hames of this and that we decimated an industry overnight.  We are now being told not to do it again and that this is not the way to do business.  Do not get me wrong; I am not having a go at the witnesses and I understand from where they are coming on this.  However, when global sugar prices are increasing and we can produce the product here it does not seem good enough to tell the citizens of this country that mistakes were made but to drive on and this is what not to do in the future.  It is not good enough.  Particularly for somebody in my party, which is overtly pro-European and outward looking, it feeds into a cynicism as to how the Commission works, particularly on how certain governments can control certain aspects of the regime while professing to be moving into an intra-institutional framework in terms of decision-making.  It is still very much an intergovernmental framework and very much about the interest of the nation states.  This clearly proves that the interests of France and Germany were tied up in ensuring that Irish sugar could no longer exist.  The Court of Auditors is now vindicating this position in its report but there is not a blessed thing we can do about it.  This is not good enough.  I am not trying to shoot the messenger but if the powers of this Parliament have been increased under the Lisbon treaty there must be something we are able to do to change this type of decision-making because it is completely inadequate.

10796	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	58	 Is it true that for €20 million less we could have kept the factory open in Mallow?  We got €20 million to raze it to the ground.  If that had been foregone, the factory could have remained standing and we could have moved into ethanol production.  The opinion that the factory was destroyed for the sake of a €20 million compensation package has been doing the rounds locally for some years.
10797	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	95	 This is important.  How did the auditors adjudicate that the information received was incorrect?  Did they do that through their own sources or was that knowledge imparted to them by a third party or another source after the fact?  The policy was implemented and did what it set out to do. The auditors are now saying the information was flawed.  At what point did the auditors adjudicate the information was flawed?  From what source did they get that information?  Did it come from a member state or the Commission?  I presume the Commission was acting on information supplied by the member states.  That is what we are trying to establish.  As far as we are concerned, that is the kernel of the issue.
10798	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	98	 We are at a crucial stage of this interaction.  Could I ask that Mr. O'Shea is given a chance to respond?
10799	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	102	 The delegation is basing this on Commission information, data or statistics.  That is a racing certainty.  However, what Commission data was used?  Where did the Commission ascertain its data on growing, numbers and funding?  It had to do this through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this country, directly from farm sources or other sources.
10800	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	104	 Or from Greencore.  There must have been an information flow between the agricultural or beet growing sector here and the Commission for the court to adjudicate on the Commission data.

At issue is transparency in the European Union.  At the outset of the report I took the view Mr. O'Shea was a man who has just authored a report which clearly shows inadequacies in how the regime worked and the court's report is remarkably tacit.  Let us start drilling down.  I note the gentleman beside Mr. O'Shea, who has not made any contribution, whispered something into his ear.  We wish to establish the situation.

I am not trying to have a go at Mr. O'Shea or Mr. Weldon.  We are simply trying to ascertain something.  I am not an accountant or an auditor.  However, I assume an auditor receives information from a particular source.  Clearly, it was deemed that the source of information was flawed.  Are we not entitled to ask what the source of information was?  If it was from the Commission, from whom or which entity did the Commission get its information?  Did the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that is to say, the member state parcel together the position on the reform of the sugar regime, or was it from another source?  We are entitled to ask this question because we are asking it on behalf of the growers, the workers who lost their jobs and their families.  That is the bottom line.  Everyone associated with the industry wishes to know on what basis the decision was made.
10810	SeanSherlock	Labour	13873.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	135	 No, it was an intergovernmental decision.  It was a Council of Ministers decision.

10833	SeanSherlock	Labour	16360.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-21 00:00:00	Special Meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs meeting with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement	18	 I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt. His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments on enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed. I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland. He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter. My first question is very simple. Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principles of parity of esteem and human rights protection are upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU? If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights? My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in The Observer on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position on citizens' rights. He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement. This is another simple question. How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years? I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.

It is just a suggestion and as I have stated, I will be guided by-----
10836	SeanSherlock	Labour	15981.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-07 00:00:00	Election of Vice Chairman	21	" Those watching the proceedings of the committee are looking for some comfort that the Government is intervening in a manner that will seek to reduce the cost of motor insurance premiums and other premiums as well. For the purposes of today we are talking about motor insurance premiums. I am a little bit worried by the Minister of State's response. If I interpret his intervention correctly, he is telling us that ""the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk"". If a person received a letter from the insurance company saying that the premium had increased by 30% or 50% or whatever and that person been driving for quite a number of years with a clean record, he or she would be shocked at having to pay upwards of 50% of an increase in his or her insurance premium because there is not such an increased risk overnight. One has to conclude from the point of view of ordinary motorists that the provisioning arrangements by insurance companies was too low, that there is the lack of transparency and that perhaps the insurance houses, most of which are global corporates, are readjusting the price setting for the Irish market in order that they can engage in super-normal profit sharing. What we really need to hear in this committee is whether the Government has the power to legislate effectively to compel the insurance companies to meet their obligations to ensure that people pay a fair premium for a fair risk on their driving. I am worried about the Minister of State's intervention and that the working groups are predominantly constituted by Departments of State, which is fair enough and is appropriate. There is the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Injuries Board. I have not heard from the Minister of State what the level of engagement has been so far with the insurance companies based in Ireland and those underwriting that risk, be they operating in the Irish market or externally. I have a funny feeling that they are readjusting their business model to extract a lot more profit from the Irish market overnight with a short sharp shock. That is what many people are experiencing this year with the massive increases in their premiums. If the purpose of the insurance companies is, under European law, to price in accordance with risk, it has to be said, with some degree of fairness and balance, that the behaviour of most drivers has not changed and they are still driving competently, so why should they pay extra for their premiums? Can the Minister of State give a clear idea of whether we can legislate to change the behaviour in the insurance sector? That is a simple yes or no question. It is incumbent on us to be very clear with motorists experiencing these difficulties. Is there a proper level of co-operation with the insurance companies, if they have been engaged in this process, and the working group? If they wanted to, they could ignore this process and continue to do whatever it is they want to do. If they do not buy into this process we could argue that we are at nothing here. There could be some legislation around what the Injuries Board does, or transparency in respect of settling claims. Can we legislate to ensure there is transparency around settling claims out of court, through the PIAB, and within the courts? We need much more transparency and we must be clear with motorists about whether we can legislate to reduce premiums. We also need to have some degree of compellability in respect of how the insurance industry engages with the working group and politically, to give motorists some comfort about reducing the cost of premiums."

As far as the public is concerned, I have met many people who battled with their insurance companies about increased premiums and succeeded in having them reduced. The public have a role in this too. People should not take increases in their premium at face value. They should engage with their insurance companies and seek reductions, thus bringing attention to this issue, which is critical to all of our lives, as we want to be insured.

Their submissions have been very informative. I have a few interactive questions. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was before the committee yesterday and I am sure the witnesses have read some of the transcripts. He said ""the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk"". It is worth our while interrogating further the setting of the discount rate. The rate may be 2% or 3% but the insurance premiums have increased by multiples of that. I assume that is because of provisioning. It would be useful for people watching online if Mr. Faughnan could give them a better appreciation as to why there has been a loading on insurance premiums this year. I am fascinated by the fact that he says insurance companies are narrowing their footprint and cherry-picking customers. Mr. Moran has said that there has been no increase in the risk related to old drivers but they are being told when the go to renew their premiums that they carry a greater risk. I imagine the market is still lucrative so I do not see why they are narrowing their footprint. I imagine the risk is still covered to a large extent. Is it because the underwriters, of which globally there are a limited number working in the motor insurance sector, are deciding the Irish market is not lucrative enough? Are they saying that profit is the ultimate motive over and above that of risk? I would like a deeper understanding of why the witness feels there will be a further rise of 20% over the next two or three quarters. Are the witnesses interacting with the Minister of State's working group? I get a sense from the Minister of State's intervention yesterday that while there have been meetings, the insurance industry is not really a stakeholder in the process but merely a contributor. The firms give information but are not influencing a potential outcome which would see the necessary reductions in premiums, as called for by Mr. Griffin, especially in the case of younger drivers and older drivers. We all have experience of this issue from our work in our constituencies, whether they be rural or urban. As public representatives, we have seen a massive increase in the cost of premiums. When we see increases of between 33% and 50% in the cost of premiums, we wonder if it is based on the profit motive or something else. Is it only about the book of quantum or the automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, or the discount rate? It seems to me there is something more to it than that. Is there another explanation of the discount rate?"

10845	SeanSherlock	Labour	15982.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-08 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion	19	 -----but it seems there is a loading on that correction which is now moving it into the supernormal profits, if I can incorrectly use that term. In other words, if somebody had paid a premium of €500, for example, and this year it is €800, of the €300 extra, what is the correction and what is absolute supernormal profits? That is why if one speaks to Mr. Kian Griffin's constituency and to older people they are absolutely perplexed. We are all perplexed as to why we are paying so much extra for our premiums overnight. It seems to me that not all the factors that Mr. Faughnan talks about here are contributing factors but that there is a profit loading on that as well. For instance, AA has three underwriters.
10846	SeanSherlock	Labour	15982.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-08 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion	21	 Obviously, it is in a pretty secure position because it has three underwriters. Perhaps that is the norm; I do not know. It seems to me that the underwriters, which are big international houses, are influencing the market in little Ireland because it is a small market in global terms. We should interrogate that further because I think Mr. Faughnan is saying that there is hope in terms of some legislative changes and data sharing, which is the European norm. If we can get those things right within this committee and within the Houses, we will go some way to ameliorating the situation but the profit element is something we need transparency on.

10857	SeanSherlock	Labour	15987.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-13 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	46	 I too thank the delegations for attending the committee today. The points they have made have been raised previously by others who have intervened. There is a common purpose there which is distilled down into a number of issues, namely, about access to proper data and ensuring an upgrading of the book of quantum. An additional point was made today by the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and Ms Verona Murphy on access to the Single Market. I understand the cabotage issue and flagging in another country. Does the IRHA have an assessment as to where the political fault lines are in opening up the insurance market for hauliers? Up to 90% of our export goods are moved by road which means hauliers are absolutely vital to the economy. We introduced a set of measures to reduce the motor tax element in budget 2016. It seems now, however, that has been wiped out because of increased insurance costs. I would like to get an idea as to how Irish hauliers are interfacing with European hauliers in opening up the market. For instance, Aviva is an international insurance house. If it can operate in the Irish market and other member states, I cannot see why there cannot be a greater degree of flexibility across boundaries, particularly as we have a Single Market and free movement of goods and services. What does the IRHA perceive to be the blockage to that? The Minister has set up the cost of insurance working group. Has he invited the IRHA to discuss these issues which we are dealing with today? If so, have these points been made to him and the working group?
10858	SeanSherlock	Labour	15987.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-13 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	48	 I do not want to give Ms Murphy platitudes. I think we all appreciate the attendant costs that are being loaded on to the sector. Our purpose here is to try to drill down. My understanding is that there is a single European market for insurance. I want to get to the nub of the interaction between the witnesses and the working group. It appears that there has been no engagement so this committee could recommend that the people who have made presentations here today in respect of very specific points could carry forward and interact with the working group because this is vital. In respect of the guidelines on injuries, I know we will use the big toe and little toe analogy. The Injuries Board is basically telling us that the average pay-out on claims between 2009 and 2015 was approximately €22,000 or €23,000. Mr. Redmond and Mr. McDonnell have touched on this issue. We have to find a solution somewhere. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court decision where there is the right to legal representation, and one takes that for what it is, it seems that if it has dealt with 100,000 awards since 2005 and the average pay-out is approximately €22,000 or €23,000, it appears that there is a multiple of that, which is not quantifiable at this point in time, where claims are paid out on the steps of the court. This is where the data and lack of transparency come in. This is where we will be engaging with the Law Society of Ireland in interrogating that dynamic as well as engaging with Insurance Ireland. The issue of cartel-like behaviour does come into play. If Insurance Ireland has a finite membership composed of the bigger houses and if Zenith Insurance, which is exiting the market, is saying that it does not have access to data, it is clear that there is a blocking mechanism there by certain elements of the insurance sector to ensure there is incomplete access to information by either the Irish Brokers Association or some of the insurance players in the market. If we can tackle that element, we can introduce data sharing among insurance providers. If data sharing was introduced it would sort out the taxi drivers that Mr. Herron is representing. To have a situation where there are only three insurance companies providing insurance for the Taxi Drivers' Federation seems to me to be a ludicrous scenario given the importance of taxis to how we operate. I want to get a sense of the witnesses' perspective on or perceptions of how Insurance Ireland and its members operate and whether they perceive there to be a blocking mechanism in relation to data. To return to the PIAB, if we could have transparency around the data from claims settled out of court, it would sort many of the people who are renting cars in this country. It would sort many of the problems for the providers in that sector. I want to make one small point on the staging of accidents before I let the witnesses back in. Mr. Redmond touched on the issue of soft tissue injuries. He stated he had no confidence in the review unless it benchmarks against European Union norms. If we had a situation here, for instance, whereby small claims for minor injuries such as whiplash were dealt with by things like vouchers for access to medical services, it could then be monitored on an ongoing basis. Is that something that the witnesses' members would accept?

If I understood Mr. McDonnell correctly, what he is saying is that there is an inconsistency in what hauliers are being quoted by the same company. That is something the committee needs to take on board. I will leave it there but before I conclude I would like to get the perspective of Mr. Redmond on the soft tissue injury issues and what seems to be a friction vis-à-vis the Law Society view.

I want to drill down to this issue of data. It seems there is not perfect knowledge in terms of how the industry operates. We do not have perfect knowledge except through the reports we have from the PIAB. Its submission to the committee gave the average award from 2009-15, which was approximately €23,000. The PIAB submission stated there is: ...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases. Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact on insurance premiums is difficult to establish... The Irish Brokers Association, IBA, submission states the same thing. I am trying to grapple with the issue. Insurance Ireland through its public utterances in the past 48 hours or so has been quoting from ""independent data sources"", from the Injuries Board figures, from the bodily injuries review published by the Central Bank and from the OECD report which states that Ireland is the eighth most expensive country in which to enforce a contract, given the average award of a Circuit Court increased by 21.2% in 2015, following a 13.5% increase in 2014. The point I am getting at is that I do understand why Insurance Ireland is not sharing data. First, I am making an assertion that is it not, so the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong and I would like to get the IBA position on that. If we had perfect knowledge in regard to all of the claims, we would be able to drill down to the reason people's premiums have gone up by 70% to 80% or why some people are not being insured at all. To give an example I have used before, if a premium goes from €500 on a Thursday to a cost of €800, which is a surcharge of €300, what percentage of that €300 is what I call super-normal profit and what percentage is attributable to the cost of the historical decrease in insurance and the provisioning that is necessary? The witnesses should correct me if my analysis of the situation is wrong. I am directing my questions in the first instance specifically to the IBA. The second element I need an answer on is in regard to Zenith. There seems to be a contradictory position between what Insurance Ireland is saying and what Zenith is saying. If I understand Mr. Humphreys correctly - he is on the public record so I have no issue about naming him here - he is saying Zenith is exiting the market because it does not have access to proper data. If so, I would like to have an assessment or a view from the IBA as to why that is the case or what its take is on that. I was very taken by a point in the IBA submission, which states: ""All gardaí should have APNR equipment so they can scan registrations to see if they are insured, and the requirement for insurance discs should be abolished."" If we think about that logically, the driver gets the insurance disc in the post and slots it into the pouch on the window, and the technology now exists to scan or copy it in order to create a false disc. If we are depending on a garda at a checkpoint with hundreds of vehicles passing through to intimately examine the disc, there is a case to be made for the APNR model so this can be based on checking of registrations, and we can look at the enforcement procedures thereafter. What this committee is trying to do is to drill down into what it is that we need to recommend by way of solutions. I will come back to Ms Dowling in the second part of the meeting as she suggests there is a potential legislative solution to this. Those are my opening remarks and I will come back in again later, if I may."

10878	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	46	 I think it is best that we make this distinction now. We are beginning to drill down into the nub of this now. If the insurance I am paying for suddenly increases by 20% or 30%, I will scratch my head. Most people will accept that historically, it might have come down for a certain demographic. Where is the loading? Mr. Carty has referred to the SFCR. If I am interpreting him correctly, he hinted that the corporates are rejigging balance sheets and preparing for the Solvency II rules. It seems to me that the victims in this, if I can use that word, are the people who are driving cars in Ireland. Regardless of the age of their vehicles or their own ages, their risk profile has not increased over a short period of time. It does not matter if their cars are three months old or 30 years old. If they have passed the NCT, they are roadworthy. This is the point. It seems to me that ordinary people are becoming victims or pawns in a bigger corporate game. There is a bit of re-provisioning going on. There is pressure to adhere to the SFCR rules or the Solvency II rules. There is a bit of naked profiteering going on as well. This is why the joint committee wants to drill down into the issue of public knowledge. The market is not perfectly competitive. If it were, anyone who wanted to enter the market tomorrow would have perfect knowledge of all elements of data. The Injuries Board is telling us one story. As it is a public body, we absolutely believe in the veracity of its figures. Not everybody is going through the Injuries Board. Why are the insurance companies settling? We know there was a constitutional case relating to the right to legal representation. I have sympathy for the IBA position in respect of transparency around the insurance system and the measures that can be taken. Everyone is saying the same thing with regard to data. We do not have perfect knowledge from the insurance industry. Maybe we have to wait for Insurance Ireland to come in later on to drill down into that element of it. Until we have that, we are really at nothing here.

10880	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	52	 Before he comes in, I would like to say it appears that the data are proprietorial, in effect. It is questionable whether we can legislate to make that data available to all comers. I would welcome a view on that. If the data are of a comprehensive nature, and if they profile every single purchaser of insurance, we can crack the nut here by getting access to them. That is really what we are trying to drill down into.

10882	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	57	 If it is supposed to be a perfectly competitive market, those who want to enter the market should have access to all the information they need to do so. If there is a blocking mechanism, there is a suggestion that cartel-like behaviour could be at play. We will have an opportunity later to discuss whether that is the case. I want to get a sense from Ms Dowling and the representatives of the IBA of whether they believe this sector is operating in a cartel-like manner. If Insurance Ireland is not giving us access to all the data we require in the interests of transparency and to enable the Oireachtas to make a set of recommendations that can potentially be legislated on, it is arguable that we are on the back foot.

Let us start at the beginning, because the CCPC has said it is going to open up an investigation into, to use Ms O'Leary's term, the issue of pricing predictions or intentions that ""may result in a degree of unspoken co-ordination"". What does the expression ""unspoken co-ordination"" mean, in layman's terms? Could the witness speak to the punter who has seen a 50% increase in their insurance premium? What does ""unspoken co-ordination"" mean?"
10885	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	416	 What Mr. Kenny is telling me, as somebody who has just seen an increase in their own premium, in layman's terms is that this could be adjudicated or there could be concerns around cartel-like behaviour in that instance.
10886	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	418	" Mr. Kenny used the analogy of the smoke-filled rooms. If one fast-forwards to modern language, it is air-conditioned rooms in glass towers, on the 15th floor, but it is the same type of behaviour, where an influence is being brought to bear on the market in the context of pricing. Whatever way one parses the language, what Mr. Kenny is essentially telling us, on behalf of a statutory agency or body, is that there is a concern about cartel-like behaviour. Let us not be too prescriptive on the word ""cartel"" as Mr. Kenny has elucidated it to us. That is de facto cartel-like behaviour, where one is influencing the price determination for a project."
10887	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	420	 The Chairman has raised the issue of data. We know what the Injuries Board pays out, but there is a whole indeterminable figure that we do not know in respect of settlements. We do not know the true cost of settlements because there is not perfect knowledge. If the CCPC is investigating this without having access to the three so-called databases, it could be argued - correct me if I am wrong - that it is on the back foot in respect of this investigation. Unless it can get access to what is on Insurance Ireland's databases, then, short of a legislative change, Insurance Ireland could block the CCPC out of that and not give it access to the database. I do not know how the legislation could be changed. Ms O'Leary alluded to this matter earlier, and forgive me if I am incorrect, but if there are any number of insurance houses in this country and they are all under an umbrella organisation and not everybody has access to the databases vis-à-vis settlements out of court - about which figure there is no perfect knowledge, generally speaking - then how is the CCPC going to crack this nut? What is it going to do? Where are the powers of compellability in respect of that data from the CCPC's point of view? If it does get access to that data, what can it do to assure consumers that their premiums will reduce as a result? I have been using the following analogy for the past few days: if my insurance premium has gone from €500 to €800, which is a €300 increase, what proportion of that €300 increase is reprovisioning or rebalancing? What proportion of that is to deal with the Solvency II rules or the financial systems control review report? What proportion of it is absolute and naked profiteering? Where will the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission come in to shed light on that for the people we represent?
10888	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	422	 Forgive me, I have no wish to confuse the issue. From a statutory point of view, does the commission have the power to go into any insurance house? The commission is investigating the sector, effectively. Does it have the power or remit to go in to any insurance house, any of the big names? Three of the biggest names in the world in this sector begin with the letter A. Can representatives of the commission go in to those houses and explain that they work for the CCCP and want access to all the data on pay-outs? We know what the Injuries Board is doing. There is perfect knowledge of its activity and the average level of claims. Can commission representatives ask these firms about what is on the databases?
10889	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	424	 The commission obviously does believe that. Otherwise, it would not have notified of the fact that it is undertaking an investigation.

We are talking about huge increases in premia. The commission has received complaints. We already know the scenarios. Let us suppose a person's car has an NCT certificate, he is over a certain age, the car is roadworthy and he has never been a risk before. Then, all of a sudden, he is paying a 50% increase in his car insurance. There is no justifiable reason for it if insurance pricing is based on risk and there is no change to the risk. Then, obviously, there is behaviour within the industry that is determining the investigation. Can the commission compel the insurance industry to yield onto Caesar their databases, which show the level of claims that are settled out of court? We, as ordinary citizens, have no knowledge of this. That is where the gap in data materialises. If we are talking about absolute transparency, then we need to have access to the data. Now, from where I am sitting, there is only one relevant entity, aside from the Central Bank reports and the Injuries Board. It is opaque and there is no perfect knowledge relating to the data.

The commission press release clearly states that there was a signalling of price increases. If the commission cannot get access to the reasoning behind the price increases, even on issues like re-balancing, provisioning or the historical reduction in premia in recent years, then what does a successful outcome of the commission investigation look like, from the point of view of the consumer?
10893	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	432	 Let us not couch language here. The people watching this online want a simple answer. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is going in now to take a look at the insurance sector, as it relates to motorists. That will give people some degree of comfort, but it will only give them comfort if they know there is an outcome that results in a reduction in premium prices.

With all due respect, I am not satisfied with hearing that speed is the friend of success. The people watching this want to know. The commission is a statutory body and one of the commissioners, Mr. Kenny, is before the committee. Can Mr. Kenny give us a timeframe by which the investigation will be completed? What could the outcome potentially be after the investigations? If the commission makes findings against the insurance industry, what recourse does the commission have? Mr. Kenny has not given us a timeline. He has said months but we need to be more definitive. If it runs to court proceedings after that, then this could conceivably take years. I am pressing Mr. Kenny because if we have to wait for the CCPC to make a determination but the industry has already signalled a 20% increase for next year, then it seems to me the firms are not going to stop that increase pending the investigation the commission intends to carry out. Therefore, the consumer will still end up paying more. Not only will the consumer be subject to the 2016 increases, he will also be front-loaded with 2017 increases as well while this investigation is going on. Can the commission stop the increases while the investigation is going on?
10899	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	444	 With all due respect, Mr. Kenny cannot say that definitively. That is a rather subjective statement. The proof of the pudding in that case will become evident. As Mr. Kenny has said, there is potentially a year in this. He cannot say for sure that premia will not actually increase as a result of the fact that the commission has signalled that it will undertake an investigation.

What we are hearing is that the commission will look at one element of what is effectively a much bigger picture, if I am to sum up its contribution. As the Chairman articulated, there is still the issue of data, of having perfect knowledge within the sector. It is clear that in the absence of perfect knowledge, we, as legislators, are in the dark. If we are expected by the consumer to make a set of recommendations, until we have access to that data and those databases, in terms of the qualitative analysis of that data, the industry can continue to behave as it has behaved.

10903	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	542	 To corroborate what the Chairman is saying, the Injuries Board has stated that there is no public information available in respect of overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries as the only figures that have been made public do not contain any information on the numbers or cost of directly settled cases. It stated that without access to this information, a full picture of the impact of personal injury claims on insurance premiums is difficult to establish. The witnesses can tell us that the commission is looking at the notified intention to increase pricing but that is still only one element of it. After this submission, we still will not know whether there is a legislative basis that can be provided or whether a case can be made for legislating for perfect knowledge within the industry aside from whether or not one is a member that is locked in or out of Insurance Ireland or whether one is a broker, an underwriter, a small indigenous insurance house or a large international insurance house. It remains the case that if there is a proprietorial element to that data, there could be all kinds of constitutional provisions around that in respect of who owns the data, who minds it and how one interprets it. We can have all sorts of assessments and can make a rough adjudication on what is in the book of quantum. We have already heard that the book of quantum needs to be updated. Ms Dorothea Dowling told us that one can go from €400,000 maxima, if I am not mistaken - she mentioned an injury to a quadriplegic level - to a minor injury like a soft tissue injury, add a percentage and extrapolate an award from that. Perhaps we have to wait and see what Insurance Ireland tells us but I am trying to ascertain here whether or not we can provide a legislative base to compel the sector to anonymise the data and give it up. There is separation of powers but that would at least provide guidance for the Judiciary, where something is not settled through the Injuries Board, to allow it to quantify the extent of the damages so that there is no back-loading or front-loading on the cost of premiums. No matter what way one parses this, there must be an element of profiteering here if a premium increases overnight by 50%, 60% or 70% or if certain people have been locked out of the market when by any objective analysis their level of risk has not increased. My level of risk has not increased from 9 to 10 September when I renewed my car insurance. Do the witnesses see my point?

We are told there are three fundamental databases, but it appears that not everybody operating within the market, or seeking to become a member, can access them. It is like a club, I suppose. If somebody is in Insurance Ireland, he or she is away on a hack, so to speak, as the person would know the pricing mechanisms and how to game the pricing systems. I use the word ""game"" as the person would have perfect knowledge of reserves and how much of a profit can be made. Even taking historical factors into account, we were told there was a reduction in the market for premiums, with certain players trying to get to the top of the market or have the most market share, resulting in a reduction in premium costs, but all of a sudden there is a reset going on. If that is happening, one does not set a price based on an intention to earn super-normal profits. The price is clearly being reset based on the fact that there must be resetting of the market to meet reserves, the Solvency II rules and what we spoke of earlier. It would appear the insurance sector is confining its behaviour to a certain number of larger firms, to the detriment of other players. On the face of it, that is what appears to be happening. They are using Setanta as cover for that. They are using the dysfunction in the market as a resetting mechanism to profiteer. That is the theory here. It comes back to whether we can legislate to get access to data. Ms O'Leary was beginning to elucidate the point that there is a difference between what happens internally within the market and what is in the public domain. That distinction has been made."

10909	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	635	" I thank the witnesses for coming into us today. There has been a focus on data. I am looking at this from the point of view of whether the market is competitive. Whether it is perfectly competitive or not remains to be seen. There is still a fundamental question about whether there is perfect knowledge around the market. We all recognise there has to be a surplus on every premium derived by a company. That is a given but we are finding it difficult to reconcile the extent to which premia have increased. It is a steep, unaffordable rise. If insurance companies are pricing risk and liability and if by any reasonable, objective analysis the individual motorist's personal circumstances have not changed, the car has passed its NCT test and nothing has changed from the motorist's point of view yet they are incurring a cost of 30%, 40% or 50% they are asking themselves, ""What is going on here?"". Most people will accept the argument around the resetting of the market to adhere to rules and provisioning. The witnesses' opening statement outlined that the price of premiums had reduced significantly over quite a number of years. What most people cannot reconcile is the extent of the increases. I have listened carefully to what Mr. Horan is saying about the data. He speaks about the private motor insurance statistics report in 2015, the IIDS, the ANPR and so on. In the Personal Injuries Assessment Board's submission to us it states there is: ...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases. Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact [of personal injury claims] on insurance premiums is difficult to establish. If we take Insurance Ireland's submission before us today and its willingness to seek a solution to this issue and layer on the fact that it is saying there is adequate data available to make an assessment of the market, why is it that the PIAB, which is a statutory body, is telling the Houses of the Oireachtas there is not perfect knowledge? How do the witnesses reconcile these statements?"
10910	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	637	 What does scoping out an exercise mean? If Insurance Ireland provides statistics to the Central Bank then yes, there are statistics, but the issue is how they are mined for quantitative analysis of the data so that decisions can be made. Will the scoping exercise, whatever that is, result in transparency around the cost of a premium? There is no breakdown of the cost of an average motorist's premium. People accept the insurance companies must make a surplus on the premium and accept, to a certain extent, a rejigging or resetting of provisioning, but they do not accept the stark increase. The witnesses still have not explained this, not even in their opening submission. There is nothing in the opening submission, with all due respect, or in the subsequent replies which answers for the ordinary motorist the question as to why premiums have increased. The witnesses have not spoken to us about behaviours in the insurance industry regarding the settling of claims - whether the insurance companies interrogate fully every claim that comes before them, or whether they settle them just to get them off the desk and out the door. We do not know who the members of Insurance Ireland are. The witnesses state that it is representative of 95% of the domestic market but, presumably, all of the big insurance houses are members of Insurance Ireland also. We know it is a not-for-profit organisation. We are all intelligent people here, presumably, so we know Insurance Ireland gets its riding instructions from those paying subscriptions. The question is whether Insurance Ireland is here to speak for all of its members, including the big insurance houses. We now hear there will be an investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, but we are none the wiser more than half an hour into these proceedings. I am still ignorant as to why there has been such a stark increase. The witnesses state that the data is available, but clearly it is not.
10911	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	639	 I apologise for cutting across Mr. Thompson, but now we are drilling down into the nub of this. He states that the data is proprietary but, at the same time, he states that Insurance Ireland is yielding up sufficient data to statutory organisations and the Central Bank. Effectively, he is giving the impression, with regard to its intervention, that there is perfect knowledge in the sector because he stated it has the IIDS and InsuranceLink, notwithstanding the ANPR issues, and the private motor statistics with the Central Bank. Insurance Ireland is creating an impression that it is yielding the data unto Caesar, so to speak, but it is not telling us, in very real and simple terms, why the increase is happening. We accept a certain degree of provisioning and resetting in the market, and we accept that the insurance companies need to make a degree of profit, but not to this extent. We do not have visibility as premium holders of the level of profit that will be made and the stark increases that have been made. This is the real issue for motorists. To be fair about it, the risk profile for the vast bulk of motorists by any actuarial standard has not actually increased. We do not have perfect knowledge on what insurance companies settle out of court on the steps with solicitors. The witnesses will not give us this information.
10912	SeanSherlock	Labour	15989.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-15 00:00:00	Rising Cost of Motor Insurance: Discussion (Resumed)	641	 The reality contradicts this. If I am to be very frank and blunt, insurance is a hard-nosed business and is highly competitive. The companies have shareholders and a bottom line. The witnesses cannot come into the Oireachtas and state that there are eight aspirations or solutions to this and that the sixth is to reduce legal costs, when we know, anecdotally and factually, that insurance companies settle out of court without investigating to a large extent whether a claim in the first instance was fraudulent, or where there is a history of repetitive cases involving people who are up and down the steps before it goes into the courtroom. There is a culture of settling before going to court, where the case could be interrogated properly, and the industry is not taking on the fraudsters. The companies have realised it is much easier to just settle and get cases off the books and off the table. The second solution suggested is tackling whiplash. The witnesses have stated that eight out of ten motor insurance claims in Ireland are for whiplash and awards here are three times those in the UK. They stated that premiums are a function of the costs of claims, so high awards mean higher premiums. However, they did not tell us the percentage of these whiplash claims which are settled without going through an Injuries Board process or are settled outside the doors of the court. Until we can drill down into this information it appears that the insurance industry will ride the storm, apply the further 20% increase in the premiums already signalled to the market, and go through the investigation with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and pay lip service to what we are trying to achieve, which is lower costs for motorists. It is plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. There is no evidence here that the industry is really making an honest effort, beyond aspirational language, to reduce premiums.

Mr. Thompson has said that the industry is settling more and tackling fraudulent claims, but it is increasing premiums at the same time. It does not figure. I wish to go back to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, statement which argues that there is no public information available on the overall number and cost of claims. The PIAB has access to the same report that Insurance Ireland furnished to the Central Bank. One would also assume that because it interfaces with the insurance industry all the time, it has access to InsuranceLink or can get a sense from Insurance Ireland of the integrated information data service, IIDS, for example, yet there is a contradiction between its position and that of Insurance Ireland on the availability of information.

10953	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	 I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming before the joint committee. The flood risk management schemes in Mallow and Fermoy were both very successful. The Minister of State has said the final accounts will be agreed for the Mallow south and Fermoy south schemes in 2016. What is the full projected cost in 2017 of the two schemes? On the intervention of the Minister of State regarding the memorandum of understanding which has now been signed with the OPW, I know for a fact that insurance providers represented by Insurance Ireland are flatly stating they will not provide flood insurance in the Munster Blackwater region which includes Fermoy and Mallow. What is the response of the Minister of State? If both areas have a flood risk management scheme which has been tested and proved to work and be effective and certain component members of Insurance Ireland state they will not provide insurance in certain parts of the Munster Blackwater region, we have a serious issue. I would like to hear the response of the Minister of State.
10954	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 What about the Insurance Ireland issue?
10955	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 To be helpful, the demountable flood defences have been proved to work and there is robust engineering evidence of this. The man and woman on the street have seen it for themselves. To be helpful to him, I suggest to the Minister of State that he should not be led a merry dance by Insurance Ireland because it speaks for the big global insurers and I do not want to name names. Even if there is a memorandum of understanding, the question is what is the extent of its power? I have proof which I will furnish to the Minister of State, through the Irish Brokers Association which tells us people are being refused flood insurance in towns such as Fermoy and Mallow, notwithstanding the fact that there are demountable flood defences. I will come back to the Minister of State, but only if I get a sense from him that he will use the full weight of his office to lean on the insurance providers because the decisions taken by the insurance industry are not necessarily taken in Dublin. They are normally taken in Switzerland, London or any of the global capitals. If the reinsurers or underwriters are not covering the risk, with all due respect, the Minister of State is at nothing. The people of Carrigtwohill regard Barryscourt Castle as a major resource. Will the Minister of State give a definitive date as to when it will open?
10956	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	 What do I tell a business on Bridge Street in Mallow or a business in Fermoy? The response of the Minister of State suggests Insurance Ireland is looking for bells and whistles, but it should take at face value the word of the OPW if it states the demountable defences work because, being the robust organisation that it is, it will not state this unless they absolutely work. We have all seen that they work. If Insurance Ireland is looking for conditions to be met before it will insure, I suggest the Minister of State not be led on a merry dance by it. It is about having teeth in the game.
10957	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 My final questions are very specific. We need a definitive date on when Barryscourt Castle will reopen. I would like to know the operating budget for Doneraile Court. What is the headline budget for Anne's Grove Gardens, a recent enough addition? I know a notification has gone out on opening the facility but what is the specific date on which it will be open to the public?
10958	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 I suppose I am asking if there is a budget line.
10959	SeanSherlock	Labour	16003.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-09-29 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 I appreciate that. To be helpful to the Chairman, I listed three specific facilities and if I could get a note from the Minister of State on the operating budget for Doneraile Court, the works required for Barryscourt and the budget therein and the budget required for Anne's Grove its prospective opening time, I would be happy to leave it at that.

10967	SeanSherlock	Labour	16024.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-20 00:00:00	Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016: Discussion	11	 On Second Stage we assented to bring the Bill to this stage. One of the questions I have had on my mind for some time has been where the Central Bank is in respect of its position on mortgage pricing in Ireland. There was a report from 2015 but is there an updated report in that respect? I do not necessarily need the answer now. It seems there is a very clear position within the Central Bank on bank profitability. The report states that equity investors, whether the State or others, cannot be expected to inject capital if a return in the form of profits is not in prospect. The report stated: That is why it is unrealistic to imagine a regime even in the long-run in which mortgage lending rates do not build in not only a sufficient spread (over the cost of funds) to cover the credit risk being undertaken, but also make an adequate contribution to profits. It is likely, however, that the rates in effect for most banks at the end of April 2015 [which is when the report was published] were higher than would be necessary in the long-run for a bank unburdened by a poorly performing mortgage back book. Could we get a perspective from the Central Bank as to whether this view point has been updated? It would be pertinent regarding dealing with the issues of competition as elucidated by the Minister. There is an issue regarding how the property rights of some creditors would be affected. Can we have a deeper dive into the dynamic of the property rights as they affect those people who paid 6% or 7% on variable rates? In one case I am familiar with, it will add approximately €100,000 to the cost of the mortgage over its lifetime. I wonder how somebody like me could explain to the person that it is a constitutional issue in which the property rights of the bank or financial institution take precedence. It is a little unclear.
10968	SeanSherlock	Labour	16024.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-20 00:00:00	Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016: Discussion	13	 Perhaps we could have an updated report from the Central Bank on the standing of the mortgage book in that respect. If there were an update of the May 2015 report Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland, it would be very useful.
10969	SeanSherlock	Labour	16024.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-20 00:00:00	Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016: Discussion	30	 Is this a precedent in the history of the House?

Specifically for the reasons outlined therein I asked for an update on the position. Given the Minister's intervention, it is clear that the modus operandi of the Central Bank is, to all intents and purposes in relation to mortgage lending, to take a laissez-faire approach. The question for us then is whether we can legislate for the cost of funds and a percentage over and above that. For the purposes of this engagement we are fairly clear at this juncture that there are two courses of action open to us in terms of our seeking legal advice and further engagement with the European Central Bank, ECB, on this matter. From my perspective, at this juncture we should move on.

10975	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 Not at this juncture.
10976	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	 On that issue, I was going to wait to make an intervention on that point at a later stage because it is something on which we would need clarity. The Bill will be very specific in regard to that point. It needs further teasing out.
10977	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 That is the point I am making. Without being too pedantic, we will have an opportunity to do that. We are not closing out that issue at this juncture.
10978	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	" I appreciate that we are talking about principles here and that these are the heads of a Bill. However, head 43 refers to the conduct of investigations. However, subsection (4) provides, ""The Ombudsman may, in the course of investigating a complaint, periodically report to the complainant on the progress of the investigation and, in so doing, may make such comments to the complainant on the investigation and its consequences and implications as that Ombudsman thinks fit."" What is meant by ""thinks fit"" or deems appropriate perhaps needs to be examined. Will the Minister give us a sense of the guiding principles? We can compare this with head 44. If the ombudsman embarks on a process of mediation and the complainant or the ombudsman feels that the organisation, intermediary or institution against whom the complaint is being made is merely going through a box-ticking exercise to be seen to be going along with a process, what kind of recourse does the ombudsman have? What level of discretion does the ombudsman have in determining that the financial institution is not playing ball and, therefore, that a sanction will be issued? If the document is prepared for the purposes of the mediation, some of it may not be deemed to be admissible if it has gone through a mediation process. The question then is how much power in real terms does the ombudsman have to ensure the financial institution goes along with the process or, at least, is an honest party to the process."
10979	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	 Yes.
10980	SeanSherlock	Labour	16031.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	 I put him on notice by asking the question.

10989	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	181	 Will Mr. McLoughlin throw in a few tickets for the All Blacks game while he is at it?
10990	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	259	 There was nobody here to do that. With all due respect, he is chairing the meeting.
10991	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	362	 I want to refer to lending to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in particular. Mr. Boucher will be aware of Horizon 2020, the €80 billion European Union research and innovation programme which has given rise to the InnovFin fund from which Bank of Ireland, in partnership with the European Investment Fund, EIF, has an opportunity to avail of €100 million. How much of that €100 million has been divested for new lending since October 2015 when Bank of Ireland did the deal with the EIF?
10992	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	364	 I ask the question because I have a sense that at branch or regional level - I do not know if agriculture comes into that component - there is a lot of new lending to SMEs in gearing up for the position post-milk quotas. There is a lot of investment in agricultural lending also, but I have not seen any documentation or publication from Bank of Ireland on lending in the technology sector. If Bank of Ireland is not lending in the technology sector, an elemental part of the InnovFin fund, is it because there is reticence on the part of banks - I believe Bank of Ireland is the only bank that has drawn down funding from the InnovFin fund - to lend in the technology sector as the risk profile might be too high? I am trying to gain an understanding of where Bank of Ireland sits on lending in sectors other than, for instance, agriculture or traditional SMEs.
10993	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	367	 Is Mr. McLoughlin telling me that Bank of Ireland is lending in that sector?
10994	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	369	 It is actively engaged in lending.
10995	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	371	 Would it be possible for somebody to contact me or come back to the committee on the way that lending which is vital is emerging? If the economy is expected to grow and we are talking about the traditional lending profile, we will have to start looking at other areas such as the technology sector and start-ups, in particular.
10996	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	373	 To finish the point, Bank of Ireland will have to carry risk and the question is whether it is overly conservative about carrying some of it. We are all watching closely to see how the fund of €100 million will be divested.
10997	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	375	 Mr. Boucher mentioned Kernel Capital. I am familiar with Kernel Capital in Cork which is part of its footprint. How many jobs were created or what is the level of economic output as a result of investments by companies such as Kernel Capital, for instance? I am trying to gain an understanding of the matter. I do not expect Mr. Boucher to have the answer to that question now, but if somebody could revert to me on it, I would be very grateful.
10998	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	377	 How much new business does the bank generate from the national enterprise week? It has been firmly in the mix for quite a number of years and it is good profiling at local level for businesses, but does it generate new business for the bank or is it just a marketing tool?
10999	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	379	 We are under the cosh time-wise. I know Mr. Boucher has been here for a few hours and I am grateful for that. Are there definitive metrics in terms of the national enterprise week? I know he bolsters his troops to go out and generate new business. That is part of his modus operandi. What I am trying to understand is whether it generates new lending and new business and whether it works as a tool.
11000	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	381	 I want to ask about lending to the agricultural sector. I come from Cork and represent a dairy production area. Where is the Bank of Ireland with respect to the other banks in terms of competing for new business in that space? Is it highly competitive or behind the curve?
11001	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	383	 Regarding the Caherdavin example, it is not that we believe older people are not engaging with technology. It would be futile for anybody to suggest that because we are probably the closest to the people on the ground in that we represent them every day of the week. The angst in regard to the branches and how they are evolving relates to the deficit in the personal relationship. While people of all ages can engage with the bank's 365 online model - and that can lead to subsequent phone calls with a person - the concern is about the one-to-one banking relationship. It is in that context that we are to articulate the point regarding places, such as Caherdavin, where the bank has flashpoints. It is not an ageism issue. I am a customer of the excellent branch in Mallow. I have a relationship with the people there. Over the years, however, there has been a diminution of the traditional relationship, particularly in respect of people going into the branch to discuss new lending or borrowing for day-to-day services. That is the point we are trying to articulate. Traditionally, the pillar banks always had that relationship with the person on the street. We recognise that the Bank of Ireland must evolve and move to a certain point and that there are cost elements involved, but it should not throw the baby out with the bathwater and move completely to an online process. If it were to do that, customers might leave. Customers need to know they are being listened to and they need to have eye contact with an official in the bank if they are transacting new business or even dealing with daily transactions. Does Mr. Boucher understand the point I am making?
11002	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	385	 The bank has taken a big stake in rugby sponsorship. I am a Munster supporter.
11003	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	387	 It is welcome that the bank has a large footprint in the provinces. Is it possible for Mr. Boucher to answer how much that sponsorship is costing the bank and whether a proportion of that is filtering down into encouraging young people, male and female, into the game? My thinking here is from a CSR perspective, as opposed to mere sponsorship and getting the name out there.
11004	SeanSherlock	Labour	16052.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Bank of Ireland	389	 Mr. Boucher mentioned flags and Leinster. We are talking about corporate sponsorship and we are all interested in the growth of the game. I am interested in discovering whether parcels of that funding go into the development of the game among young people in particular. Mr. Farrell is nodding his head. Is there a message that Mr. Boucher wants to impart about how he is concerned about the future of the game and that this is not merely corporate sponsorship and about flags? What I am trying to tease out is whether that sponsorship actually enhances the game.

11021	SeanSherlock	Labour	16057.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Permanent TSB	40	 There are some specific questions on the buy-to-let, BTL, field, including No. 6, which is about the short-term solutions being provided, and No. 7 which is about the long-term solutions being provided. First, however, I want to deal with question No. 2, which asked the number of BTL mortgages reported as in arrears greater than 90 days as of 30 June. Since 2013, when the bank cited a figure of 5,000, it now has 2,112 BTL mortgages more than 90 days in arrears. What was the mechanism by which the bank arrived at that number?
11022	SeanSherlock	Labour	16057.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Permanent TSB	42	 When considering the BTL long-term solutions, Mr. O'Sullivan referred specifically to the reduced payment greater than the interest rate. In fairness to the bank, it has provided all the numbers comprehensively for us, which is to be welcomed. The figure of 1,351 is quoted. If there are 1,351 mortgage holders paying a reduced payment that is greater than the interest rate, wherein lies the risk? This committee is mindful of the tenants of those properties because of the problem of homelessness and if there is 92% performance on the loans, I wonder how those 1,351 will play out. Is there security of tenure? While the bank's first duty is to the mortgage holder, does it feel a social obligation to ensure there are tenants and that they have some security of tenure where those mortgages fail to perform?
11023	SeanSherlock	Labour	16057.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Permanent TSB	44	 Specifically on buy-to-let, Mr. O'Sullivan quoted the figure of 423 as the sum total of rent receivers the bank has in place.
11024	SeanSherlock	Labour	16057.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Permanent TSB	46	 I would like to get a sense from the witnesses of the fallout from Springboard Mortgages. A total of 1,372 customers of the bank were in line for substantial refunds. I know this was last year, but I would like to get a sense of whether the issue has resolved itself and whether the bank is giving due recognition to its own failings in regard to Springboard, where people lost properties as a result of the issue.

11026	SeanSherlock	Labour	16057.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Banking Sector in Ireland: Permanent TSB	51	 Does Mr. Mitchell agree a certain number of these people fell into arrears and lost their homes and were subsequently compensated? How is the bank dealing with these people? Does it have a protocol in place to recognise their loss as a result?

11040	SeanSherlock	Labour	16066.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-01 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	49	 Could that be published or made available to this committee? There was in the United Kingdom a process in which Royal Bank of Scotland provided €400 million to compensate small business customers. There is a question mark as to whether or not, as a result of the GRG process, there are businesses in this State that could be eligible for compensation among the 2,000 odd businesses we have discussed. This committee will have to explore this matter further and it will endeavour to bring in people whose businesses have been directly affected by this GRG process. Does Mr. Blair foresee that compensation will be paid out to customers in this State?
11041	SeanSherlock	Labour	16066.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-01 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	51	 We should not be pedantic at this stage, although perhaps Mr. Blair is not being deliberately pedantic on this one.

11046	SeanSherlock	Labour	16066.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-01 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	200	 I will lighten the load somewhat for Mr. Mallon. I ask Mr. Mallon to give the perspective of Ulster Bank and that of its parent on Brexit from a macroeconomic viewpoint. He spoke about some headwinds coming down the track regarding Brexit. He spoke about Ulster Bank's strategic position vis-à-vis the parent company, which has inoculated it, for want of a better word. This committee and the Houses in general are trying to get as many perspectives as possible on the outworkings of Brexit. It would be interesting to get Mr. Mallon's perspective on the significance of Brexit. I do not necessarily expect him to go into the political realm, but there are the permutations of the triggering of Article 50 and the permutations of a hard Brexit. Is Ulster Bank doing any forward planning for a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit with access to the European market?
11047	SeanSherlock	Labour	16066.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-01 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	202	 Is there significant variance on that point?

This is quite a complex proposal. I do not doubt there is not a politician across Europe who will have questions about the modalities of the Commission’s proposals. One point the Commission raised with the committee concerned the treatment of research and development. It stated the 2011 proposal for full deductibility of research and development costs was a one-off. There was no capitalisation depreciation of research and development over several years. This regime had been retained under the relaunched proposals with the exception of immovable property. What is the immovable property element? Over the past several years, this country has focused on the knowledge box and the research and development tax credit. There is an 80:20 split between the domestic and foreign direct investment sectors. What would be the effect of the Commission’s proposals on domestic companies?

11061	SeanSherlock	Labour	16078.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-12-13 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals (Resumed).	15	 I appreciate that. The fear we have in this committee is that the work Ms O'Brien just described in regard to creating the research and development regime, if one likes, in terms of attracting foreign direct investment is undermined in any way by virtue of the proposals people would have serious issues with that, while wishing to continue working with the proposal. I am trying to get an understanding of the arbitrary figure of €750 million in relation to the turnover and the common base. There is an 80:20 split between the domestic and non-domestic sectors. My instinct tells me that loopholes could be created to circumvent that. Perhaps I am wrong. Does Ms O'Brien have a perspective on that also? How does one calculate the €750 million threshold? It is conceivable that people might not come up to that base for all sorts of reasons or they could be very creative in ensuring that they do not come up to that base so as not to hit the threshold, so to speak.

There is a long way to go on this proposal but it important that we have perspectives on the tax implications for R&D in particular. Are other taxation institutes across the 27 or 28 member states flagging these concerns and is there collaboration between the Irish Tax Institute and others on these bespoke issues?

I wish to hear Mr. Coffey's view on one issue I zoned in on in his submission, and perhaps he will have to repeat himself. The document states that the European Commission study does not have data on sales by destination and that in this instance, rather than try to impute the location of sales, the study proxies sales with output. Could Mr. Coffey give us a layman's view on what he means by this, particularly for people watching the proceedings of the meeting who are very interested in this subject?

He seems to critique the proposal by the Commission on the basis that it only uses company financial data. I do not want to put words into his mouth, but my ears are telling me that the Commission's fundamental proposal is quite flawed, or at the very minimum can be seriously critiqued, because it does not delve into the very factors to which Mr. Coffey refers. A country such as Ireland has a huge dependence on foreign direct investment and notwithstanding global tax justice, all these are issues that are sometimes raised, including the BEPS process under way through the OECD. To be fair, Ms O'Brien is right that we must give that process a fair wind and a chance to settle. However, there could be serious permutations for Ireland's ability to continue to attract FDI and maintain it. The pharmaceutical sector, for instance, has a regional importance in the south, east, west, north and north west. I am not being too parochial; it spans the whole country. If I were in the pharmaceutical sector considering these proposals and if I were a lead on a site making strategic decisions from a corporate point of view, I would be potentially quite worried by these proposals as they stand.

11079	SeanSherlock	Labour	16120.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-24 00:00:00	EU Corporate Taxation and Investment and Growth Strategies: Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs	62	 I welcome the Commissioner, Mr. Moscovici, to our committee. I will start by making a political point. As a former Member of Parliament and a former Minister, the Commissioner will take a reading from this meeting of the Irish Parliament's Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach today. The mood thus far is one of a degree of scepticism about this proposal because too many questions are left unanswered on how it will affect our ability, for instance, to attract foreign and direct investment. We take the Commissioner's intervention in good faith and the proposal is that there would be a 1.2% rise in growth across the European Union and €90 billion in extra investments. If we are inhabiting a political space in which there is the rise of the extreme right and of populism, there is a school of thought that would say that if there is a proposal that seeks to undermine sovereignty or even the perception of sovereignty - I note the Commissioner's colleague is nodding her head - and there is a perception of a diminution of Ireland's ability to maintain its sovereignty as it relates to taxation measures, I would suggest it is ill-timed. The focus of the Commission's agenda or policy outcomes should not be to examine the consolidated tax base but to examine the Stability and Growth Pact. If a country like Ireland has the sword of Damocles in terms of Brexit handing over it, where there is a degree of uncertainty and nobody can definitively answer questions from a macro-economic point of view on how Brexit will affect small countries like Ireland because the negotiations de facto have not been concluded, and if there is a proposal on top of that which creates the perception that Irish people's sovereignty as it relates to their tax affairs is undermined in any way, then the Commission is adding to a degree of euroscepticism, notwithstanding the EUROSTAT poll numbers on Ireland's relationship with the European Union. It should be concentrating on matters such as the Stability and Growth Pact instead. If we consider rules such as the excessive deficit procedure, the balanced budget rule and the six pack, what Europe needs if we are to have a 1.2% rise in growth is a greater degree of flexibility with respect to the Stability and Growth Pact as it relates to countries like Ireland, which is currently very constrained and is seeking changes to the rules to ensure that it can start making investments in infrastructure and the capital investments that will add to and fuel growth in the economy. We are not a eurosceptic country. I inhabit the centre left. My group within the European Parliament has put forward proposals for a relaxation of Stability and Growth Pact rules. We want to see growth happening. If those of us who champion the EU want to see it sustained against the rising euroscepticism and increasing populism that we see, we have to see reforms. I put it to the Commissioner that reforms come in allowing for greater flexibility with respect to the Stability and Growth Pact. That is my main point. I hope that as a former Member of Parliament and a former Minister, the Commissioner will be able to give us some insight from that perspective. He will have to wear his Commissioner hat at the same time but I put it to him that growth in Europe is predicated on a greater relaxation of the Stability and Growth Pact rules.

On 19 December our Department of Finance issued a statement setting out some clear and unambiguous views relating to the ruling or interpretation of the Commission. I will quote from the statement in the context of the various entities, including Apple Inc., Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. I am trying to distil this for people who may not have technical knowledge, for example, ordinary citizens who are watching the proceedings. On 19 December the Department of Finance stated that the Commission's decision: The Decision also mischaracterises the activities and responsibilities of the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the USA, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. How does the Commissioner respond to that contention from our Department of Finance?

The Commission has not been silent on the question of whether other member states or other countries have a call on the magical figure of €13 billion. What are the modalities the Commission is proposing for Ireland to set up a system for other countries to come calling for that €13 billion or a portion of it? I would like to examine the statement the Commissioner made to this effect - if I understood her correctly - when she said other countries might have a call on the €13 billion. I have listened carefully to what she has said as a Commissioner of the European Union about the importance of the Single Market. My view is that if the Commission is to make such a statement, it must also have a view on how other member states are to collect this money, if that is what will transpire in the final analysis.

We did not investigate how Apple organised its operations. We did not investigate the cost-sharing agreements. We did not investigate the fact that Apple records its profits in Cork, Ireland. We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland. We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity. That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland. I am trying to reconcile, in my own mind, the statement made by the Department of Finance on the Irish branches of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. Can the Minister give us an opinion on the Commissioner's statement, particularly on the stateless headquarters and the activity levels she says were not supported by economic activity?

I am trying to distil this. In respect of the theme around the methodologies, the Commission has stated that the decision of 30 August asserts that the two opinions given in 1991 and 2007 by Revenue renounced tax revenue that Ireland would otherwise have been entitled to collect from the Irish branches of Apple Sales International, ASI, and Apple Operations Europe, AOE. Mr. Cody speaks of a mis-characterisation. I think those were the words he used in the documents we have. Will he explain what he means? What is meant by ""renounced"" in this instance?"

What the Commission is saying is that in this instance, there was €130 billion worth of economic activity conducted on the island of Ireland through two entities. Is that correct based on that model?
11103	SeanSherlock	Labour	16129.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	EU State Aid Rules - Investigation into Preferential Tax Rulings: Minister for Finance and Office of the Revenue Commissioners	202	 That is what it is saying.

She said: We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland. We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity. That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland. She went on to state: We do not investigate or value the intellectual property. We have not done that here. We have seen that Apple has organised itself with what it refers to as a cost-sharing agreement. This means that most of the research and development takes place at the Apple Inc. facility in Cupertino. I am trying to get my head around this. In Mr. Cody's lines of argument, he states that the Commission's attribution of Apple's intellectual property licences to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI is not consistent with Irish law and, moreover, is inconsistent with the principles it claims to apply, as is its stated refusal to take into account the activities of Apple Inc. There is no reconciliation between those two statements. I am trying to distil the contradiction in layperson's terms. In respect of the intellectual property piece, the Minister asked us to refer to the phones and so on being made in China and the intellectual property in Cupertino. Can somebody distill that for me in bare simple terms? Where does the intellectual property piece fit into all this if the Commissioner is saying that the Commission did not investigate or value the intellectual property? Mr. Cody is saying that the intellectual property is not generated in Ireland. If I am interpreting the Commissioner correctly, she is saying that the Commission is not investigating the intellectual property so, therefore, it is not investigating an Irish operation in that sense. How do we reconcile that? How do we get a better understanding of that dynamic?

11117	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	4	 I welcome both Mr. Deering and Ms Cassidy to the committee. Mr. Deering stated that the FSO is dealing with 400 complaints on tracker mortgages. Is that the cumulative number of complaints or are there more?
11118	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	6	 I have a figure of 600 for tracker mortgages specifically. Is that correct?
11119	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	8	 If I understand the figure correctly, the FSO has carried out a review of 600 complaints regarding tracker mortgages in 2015.
11120	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	10	 It is quite a volume nonetheless. Mr. Deering states that two appeals relating to tracker mortgages were listed for hearing on 16 February 2015 and when they came for mention, they were withdrawn by the bank. Why were they withdrawn?
11121	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	12	 Did the bank possibly settle with the complainants at that stage?
11122	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	14	 On the FSO's interaction with the Central Bank, I will try to go back to what Mr. Deering said. The FSO stated that two of the complaints were remitted to it for further consideration, while the bank was unsuccessful in the remaining two appeals. Mr Deering stated that the FSO is waiting for the Central Bank to come back to it. He stated: We are currently dealing with approximately 400 complaints relating to tracker mortgages. In the vast majority of these, the mediation or investigation and adjudication of the complaint has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Central Bank examination statement here. What are the FSO's interactions with the Central Bank at present in respect of this process? How long will it take? Are those 400 cases de facto in limbo?
11123	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	16	 Presumably, those complainants are communicated with and are fully au fait with the process in hand.
11124	SeanSherlock	Labour	16157.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-02 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	18	 How many complaints has the FSO upheld?

11141	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	53	 I welcome the representative groups and thank them for their time. I am trying to reconcile the gap between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the individual member of a credit union, as represented by these groups today. If I start with Consultation Paper 76 - or CP76 - my understanding was that the representative organisations made specific proposals on tiered regulation. I note the point made by Mr. Tim Molan of CUMA earlier: Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered. This was a key deliverable of the commission report. Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged … Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88. I want to drill further into that dynamic. I read the speech by the registrar of credit unions to the CUMA spring conference. Objectively, one would think that, from a regulatory point of view, the issues raised by her in that speech seem to apply to many credit unions. If there are still outliers in the system that are not ticking all the regulatory boxes from a legislative point of view, should they be dealt in one parcel, while those credit unions, whether they are large or involved in the hub-and-spoke model, are allowed to progress into areas such as payment accounts, debit cards, longer term lending and investment in social housing? Is it the case that the Central Bank is trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach? If that is the case, will that hamper the ability of the credit union movement to progress in lending for productive, social and other purposes?
11142	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	55	 Does that involve a change to one of the sections of the legislation or does it involve a change in the culture within the Central Bank regarding how it views credit unions?
11143	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	57	 That is a question which should be posed to the registrar as one of the workings of this interaction when she is before the committee on Thursday. I read her speech to the CUMA conference in which she addressed issues such as everyday payment accounts. She stated: [T]he market is not large enough to support multiple offerings of the same products and services, but that limit is not one confined to one service model. So far, we have not received any formal applications beyond MPCAS, although our sectoral engagement suggests that this is an area of active interest. If the credit union movement is talking about innovating and the potential for payment accounts, how does that work its way through the system? What does that mean from the credit union movement's perspective?
11144	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	59	 Mr. McCrory has moved on to AGMs. On that issue, I understand that quite a few AGMs have not taken place and that sanction is needed for an AGM to take place. Why is this the case?
11145	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	61	" I wish to broaden the perspectives on these issues with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Molan and even Ms O'Connor who should forgive me as we have not included her in the interaction yet. We are trying to get a better understanding of this. As I said, it is still about the gaps that exist. Mr. McCrory has already articulated a gap in respect of CP88 and spoken about the indefinite delays in the holding of AGMs. What the average member wants to know is why this is the case. How do we close this gap? The theme of the registrar's speech was ""Mind the Gap"". She referred to: - Your current v. your needed level of regulatory compliance. Given some of the issues we have found in recent supervisory engagements, I could characterize this as ""Mind the basics"", and - the sector's current business model and capability, and the ambitious proposed or evolving business models, which often carry very much different risks and capabilities. There is then still a massive gap between how the registrar perceives the Credit Union Managers Association and how the organisation perceives itself. Somewhere in between, we are trying to see if we can broker or mediate that gap, and in broad terms there seems to be a long way to go. On the face of it, the registrar seems, if I am reading the speech correctly, to put a major limit on the issue of the payment accounts and debit cards. She seems to suggest a major curbing of one's enthusiasm, for want of a better expression, in respect of long-term lending. She is very reticent, if I interpret her correctly - and she will have a chance to respond to these comments on Thursday - on the investment in social housing. In addition, I have a difficulty understanding the issues regarding section 35. No review has yet been undertaken, even though we are technically out of recession, on the section 35 rescheduling restrictions because individual impacted members - and this is based on anecdotal evidence - are back in work and have continuing borrowing requirements in excess of the emergency amounts allowed under the regulations. Again, the question on my mind is whether it takes a legislative change to amend this or whether a cultural change is needed within the Central Bank to broker that. I hope that makes sense."

11151	SeanSherlock	Labour	16176.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Overview of the Credit Union Sector: Discussion	74	 In other words, if there is an outlier who does not fit all the criteria vis-à-vis regulation, in a one-tier system of regulation one cannot develop new business models or innovate. I think that is the core message we are getting from the witnesses.

11163	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	4	 Mr. Carville described credit unions as diverse and stated their mode of operation presents challenges in that there are 283 different boards and entities. He also referred to the need for flexibility and proportionality in policy and regulation to support the credit union framework. Does this involve having a process of tiered regulation and, if so, when will such a process be in place?
11164	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	6	 I ask Mr. Carville to provide brief, concise answers because I have only a short time to question him.
11165	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	8	" I would prefer the view of the Department of Finance. The credit union representative organisations appeared before the joint committee on Tuesday last. Tiered regulation does not appear to feature in the model being pursued from a policy perspective, that is, by the Department, or by the Central Bank. According to one school of thought, a rural credit union cannot be assessed in the same way as an industrial credit union, to use Mr. Carville's term, or any other type of sectoral credit union. Members need to find out whether there will be movement towards tiered regulation. The question requires a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer."
11166	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	10	 When will it report?
11167	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	12	 I am failing to grasp something here. We all offer platitudes on the importance of the credit union sector. How long has the CUAC report been in existence?
11168	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	14	 Time is passing. We need a definitive answer as to when tiered regulation will take place. Mr. Carville says the implementation group is meeting. Can we have an expectation that it will be in the first, second, third or fourth quarter in 2017 or the first quarter in 2018? We need definitive timelines.
11169	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	16	 The Department will have oversight of that process.
11170	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	21	 This is what I do not understand. As parliamentarians, we are aware of the restructuring that has taken place because it has happened within our communities. However, there was a clear message on Tuesday that the regulation does not reflect the reality. The witness says that once the ReBo process is completed, the tiered regulation will follow, if I interpret her correctly.

11174	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	29	 What is the Department of Finance's position on that, given that there is a clear programme for Government commitment around social housing and there has been engagement with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on including the credit union movement? Why has that not moved on?
11175	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	31	 The credit union representatives told us on Tuesday that they have been going around in circles. I am sure the witnesses have read what they said.

The bulk of the larger credit unions are sitting on massive reserves and have potential. They say they are going around in circles to Departments and the regulator but nothing is moving on this matter. Why is that the case? Is it the case that the Department and the Central Bank are taking a view that they do not want the credit union movement to move into these spaces? I hear words such as ""innovation"". I was formerly a Minister of State with responsibility for innovation. What does it mean? What does business model development mean? Many credit unions have moved into smart payments and so forth. They are trying to innovate in the products and services they are providing, but it appears that they are constrained in doing that. I cannot understand why and I am not getting answers here either."

11182	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	45	 Does the witness agree with the assertion that CUAC has identified elements of the commission report that are outstanding? If he agrees with that assertion and if those elements of the commission report that are outstanding have not been implemented, what happens?
11183	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	47	 Mr. Carville is part of the implementation team.
11184	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	49	 What will the Department do if parts of the CUAC report are not implemented?
11185	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	51	 That is not a hypothetical question.
11186	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	53	 This committee is in something of a vacuum. We want to hear what the stakeholders have to say and we want to ensure that there is a vibrant credit union movement into the future. I am not convinced that a sunset is being put on actions or key deliverables within definitive and clearly defined timelines. It seems from what Mr. Carville is saying that the Department is not a million miles away from understanding the needs of the credit union movement and realising the potential of the movement. However, there is still a logjam. This is why we are trying to go hard on the questioning here. I suggest that tiered regulation is the nut that needs to be cracked. The impression I get from the engagement of the Department and the Central Bank with the credit union movement is that one of them, or both, does not want to be dealing with 283 entities. I think there is a certain attitude that regards the credit unions as somehow amateurish because they are voluntary and non-paid. All credit unions have gone through the rigours in recent months. Some of them have spent hundreds of thousands of euro from members' money on consultancy fees to meet the needs and requirements of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. They are not seeing light at the end of the tunnel. They need to see that happening. That is why I am asking about clearly defined timelines for the full implementation of the CUAC recommendations. We are depending on the Department of Finance as a stakeholder in that process. If we do not see progress in this respect within clearly defined timelines, that will not bode well for our confidence in the Department of Finance or the Central Bank. I hope that makes sense.
11187	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	55	 Okay.
11188	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	58	 Do the witnesses understand the frustration of the credit unions about the lack of progress?
11189	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	62	 I thank Mr. Carville.
11190	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	142	 I support what the Chairman says about Mr. Corr. In Mr. Carville's presentation he stated that the credit union policy within his division is well resourced and is headed by Brian Corr. If the head of the credit union policy team cannot be here today in this Parliament and feels that Brussels is of greater importance that is a bad day for our interactions with the Department
11191	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	244	 I wish to support that statement if I may. At the start of the crisis, we were informed there was a €1 billion hole in the credit unions. The Department now informs us the sum involved is €500 million, consisting of €250 million related to restructuring and a further €250 million related to resolution. Of the €250 million provided for one of these two purposes, only €20 million was used as bail-out money. I use that term for the sake of argument. This means the extent of the crisis in the credit union movement was grossly exaggerated. If only €20 million of a €250 million fund has been required, the amount needed has been minuscule when compared with what was needed for the banks. It is certainly minuscule relative to the €1 billion we were informed would be needed for restructuring. The credit unions are now being levied to generate funding for an unspecified purpose. It does not seem to be for any particular reason because two separate funds, each of €250 million, are already in place. This is akin to imposing a highway tax on the credit unions. Will the witnesses explain the reason for this in simple language, please?
11192	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	246	 Will the credit unions have their money returned to them?
11193	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	248	 Put another way, will the money be returned to us because we are all credit union customers?
11194	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	250	 This is taxpayers' money.
11195	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	256	 There is a restructuring fund and resolution fund in place.
11196	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	279	 Mr. Carville should not try to stretch his credibility on this issue.
11197	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	287	 They took the money.
11198	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	290	 May we have an update in the next quarter on the work of the implementation group? I suggest we send a message to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank that the committee will monitor the work of the bank very closely on behalf of the people we represent. We need clear, identifiable timelines and deadlines because progress has slipped. Contrary to what Mr. Carville said, tiered regulation was defined in the original commission's report. There were to be three processes for tiered regulation.
11199	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	292	 I do not understand why we have not moved from that point to having tiered regulation under way at this stage in the first quarter of 2017. Many credit unions have done the necessary hard graft and paid thousands of euro in consultancy fees to go through the process. The hub and spoke model was developed in which the bigger entities took on the smaller ones. We have a lot of work to do to ensure there will be a proper throughput in a clearly defined timeline.
11200	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	347	 How many staff does Ms McKiernan have in her office?
11201	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	349	 Some 70 staff. How many people interface with the individual credit unions on a daily basis?
11202	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	351	 That is 35 staff dealing with 281 credit unions.
11203	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	353	 I thank Ms McKiernan. That is fine.
11204	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	355	 How would Ms McKiernan describe the nature of the relationship between her staff and individual credit unions on a day-to-day basis? Would she describe it as professional and courteous?
11205	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	357	 Are there times when voices are raised between her staff and individual staff members of credit unions?
11206	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	359	 Have there been occasions?
11207	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	361	" Going back to the regulation-making powers, Ms McKiernan spoke about the broad class of investments and the upcoming consultation. She also referred to expectations in respect of developing new business models. During our engagements on Tuesday, we heard from credit unions that they are undertaking digital and social media based marketing on a shared basis and that they are generating new business successfully. We have heard about a shared approach to the mortgage support framework, notwithstanding the views articulated today. My understanding is the bodies do this without necessarily engaging with the Central Bank. How prescriptive does Ms McKiernan see the bank's role in the development of new business models? She indicated that the bank had a vision of a particular business model started in 2014 but which did not progress in 2017. I am trying to gain an understanding of the culture within the bank's organisation; it is quite difficult to understand it. She should correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that if I was to come to the bank with something I deem to be progressive for a credit union, it would state it would fly or it would not. It is a case of ""Yes"" or ""No"". Am I right in discerning that the bank will not come up with a business model or ideas for how something should progress? What is the process involved? Is it iterative or interactive? Does the bank engage positively? It seems that if an idea does not fly, that is it and a credit union must go back to the drawing board. I want to understand the Central Bank's powers in developing new business models and how deep is the engagement. How prescriptive is the bank in developing new business models?"
11208	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	363	 As I have a short amount of time, can we keep the answers short, if that is okay? If I were to come to the Central Bank with a proposal, it would kick the tyres, but it might not necessarily come back to me saying it could be tinkered with here or there. Its role, remit and power are very clear when it comes to new proposals.
11209	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	365	 I appreciate that. The delegates have indicated that standards of regulatory compliance are still well below those required to credibly safeguard members' funds and position credit unions to tackle business model development. They are still seeing an unacceptable number of credit unions failing to display a strategic understanding and good governance. In several cases we have encountered limited financial skill sets and weak management. There are 281 credit unions within the Central Bank's remit, but how many are still weak in terms of having limited financial skills and weak management. I would like a specific number.
11210	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	367	" That was said in an earlier intervention, but I need numbers. Are there ""several"" outliers? Do they amount to a very small minority, less than 10 or 20 of the 281 credit unions? One could easily create the impression that this refers to the majority rather than being the exception. I need to have an understanding of how many are still behind the door in getting their governance procedures correct. We all understand credit unions went through a very difficult restructuring process. The hub and spoke model was developed and it is probably an iterative and ongoing process. They spent thousands of euro on consultant fees. Would Ms McKiernan agree that many credit unions have come through that process?"
11211	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	369	 Indeed, but I am trying to understand how many still have a way to go in ensuring risk management, compliance and internal audit functions are robust.
11212	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	371	" If the number is at the ""higher end"", Ms McKiernan should have a figure in her mind."
11213	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	373	 What is the number today, 23 March?
11214	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	375	 Ms McKiernan has already said that three times and does not need to repeat the point. I want to come to the issue of tiered regulation. We are being told that there is no tiered regulation, but if I understand the language used by Ms McKiernan today, she is telling us in couched terms - she can correct me if I am wrong - that there is tiered regulation in everything but name. Is that correct?
11215	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	377	 Let us not couch our language. As politicians, we are used to couched language. Is Ms McKiernan saying there is de facto tiering?
11216	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	379	" Ms McKiernan has indicated that the bank has seen ""no investigations of short-term or medium-term lending proposals."" When did it become necessary for a credit union to obtain the registrar's permission for such proposals?"
11217	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	381	 Ms McKiernan has also stated the Central Bank has undertaken to publish enhanced guidance on what it expects to see in terms of long-term proposals. Are the guidelines inadequate or fit for purpose?
11218	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	383	 In respect of sectoral leadership, if I was reading that as a CUDA, CUMA or ILCU member and if Ms McKiernan was telling me that there is a need, in her own words, for greater sectoral leadership and a fuller understanding of risks involved to develop a roadmap of business model development, I might take issue with that. In respect of our interactions with the sector on Tuesday, there was consistency in its approach with no outliers. CUMA, CUDA and ILCU were represented. They would argue that they are showing leadership and that they are more than willing to engage. The Chairman has used the merry-go-round analogy. They have been on the merry-go-round with the Department of Finance and they contend with the Central Bank as well to show the type of leadership and develop the innovation and business models Ms McKiernan is speaking about here, but there still seems to be a resistance to that. It would be my contention that by any objective analysis, they have shown leadership because they have gone through the rigours of restructuring and, with some outliers, have adhered to the restructuring process as regulated by the Registrar of Credit Unions. To use Ms McKiernan's language, they now want to move into that multi-step of developing the sector again, growing the business model and encouraging new lending with a younger demographic of borrowers. It seems that neither they nor Ms McKiernan are a million miles apart but there is something within the chasm and vacuum that needs to be unblocked. I do not know if it is an issue of perception regarding how the Central Bank perceives the sector and how the sector perceives the Central Bank. Somebody needs to do a bit of mediation because if I listen to Ms McKiernan and the intervention of the representative bodies, I can see that they all want to go in the same direction but there is some blockage in the way that needs to be worked through because they have already gone through the rigours of the regulatory process. I know Ms McKiernan is not paying lip service to the idea of recognising the importance of the sector, but there is some responsibility on the part of the Central Bank to ensure the sector progresses back into productive lending sooner rather than later because this has been going on too long. The Credit Union Advisory Committee report has been in existence for a while and the implementation group only met in the first quarter of this year so we need to see progress by the second or third quarter because we have already told the Department of Finance that we want it to appear again before this committee. I hope the Central Bank would appear before the committee as soon as possible to see what progress is being made on these issues.
11219	SeanSherlock	Labour	16178.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-03-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	385	 Not all 281 common bond credit unions will come to the Registrar of Credit Unions with a set of proposals. They will work their way up through their representative organisations. I presume the articulation of development of new business will be done primarily through the representative bodies, with which Ms McKiernan engages regularly. If I understand it correctly, in a nutshell, Ms McKiernan is telling me that more work needs to be done on the business model development piece.

11277	SeanSherlock	Labour	16190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-04 00:00:00	Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with Central Bank of Ireland	57	 I, too, welcome the Governor and his colleagues here today. I want to focus on the tracker mortgages issue. The update of the Central Bank of Ireland's Examination of Tracker Mortgages-related Issues 2017 paper was quite comprehensive and assisted us in getting a deeper understanding of where the Central Bank is in terms of examining this issue. However, where individuals made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and received a negative decision, I am fearful that the Central Bank's examination will not adequately cover all the people concerned. I say this because I have evidence particularly about PTSB. I will refer specifically to PTSB because the Central Bank stated in its report that it had commenced enforcement investigations against the bank. I know of samples of cases where the FSO made a negative decision about complaints and the people concerned have not received notifications that their cases are being examined, neither from the bank nor the Central Bank. Will the Governor give guarantees or assurances to those people that they will receive letters?
11278	SeanSherlock	Labour	16190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-04 00:00:00	Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with Central Bank of Ireland	60	 It must be acknowledged that the Financial Services Ombudsman is very proactive on this issue and has engaged with us on this. I want to look at one of the thematic areas, namely, data protection. This should be apparent to the Central Bank at this stage but I want to get the bank's assessment of this. In the bank's examinations to date, has it found that there are glaring gaps in how data protection law was applied to individual customers when they sought information on specific telephone calls, dates of engagement or correspondence they had? I understand that when complaints were made or when people sought to interact with their bank, especially on the options issue, and again I am talking about PTSB, there were glaring inaccuracies in some instances in how the bank interpreted that engagement. Also, the bank refused in some instances to acknowledge that telephone calls had taken place or that particular correspondence was entered into. When people sought to have records furnished, they were not furnished or, if they were, they might have been furnished inaccurately or less than adequately. I want to ensure that from a consumer protection point of view into the future, where people have issues with their mortgages, a robust system is in place to ensure the data protection element provides protection to the consumer. I hope the Central Bank will address that matter.
11279	SeanSherlock	Labour	16190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-04 00:00:00	Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with Central Bank of Ireland	62	 When looking at this matter, one's instinct is to think that there should be a robust consumer protection entity that is separate from the Central Bank. In other words, it should be decoupled because there is a resources issue. If it is necessary to examine 2 million accounts, presumably microscopically, that gives rise to questions as to whether there should be a separate entity to speak for the consumer in this instance. Professor Lane will understand if there is a certain degree of scepticism in respect of the idea that the banks appoint their own independent advisers to oversee the conduct of the investigations and then liaise with the Central Bank in the process. For all sorts of historical reasons, he will understand that there would be some scepticism about whether the Central Bank can adequately and robustly protect the consumer.
11280	SeanSherlock	Labour	16190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-04 00:00:00	Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with Central Bank of Ireland	64	 On the issue of criminal prosecution, to which reference is made in the comprehensive review to which I referred earlier, there are specific powers in respect of the bank's obligations under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942. Has the bank referred or reported to the Garda any aspect of its examination of tracker mortgages?
11281	SeanSherlock	Labour	16190.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-04-04 00:00:00	Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with Central Bank of Ireland	67	 Finally, to close the loop, while the Central Bank states that all mortgages are being examined, I seek reassurance that those who have not received correspondence who were the subject of FSO complaints and who received negative decisions will not be outliers. Essentially, I am asking for that assurance because we do not want to come back to this again in the future when another raft of borrowers who have potentially been forgotten about will have a legitimate case to be heard.

11289	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	" I thank the individual speakers for their contributions. I wish to question Mr. Sunderland on his submission. If I am reading between the lines correctly, there is a sense that there is a great deal more work to be done on the Bill before the Office of the Data Commissioner is satisfied that it passes muster. Is Mr. Sunderland confident that the issues he flagged are being dealt with at present? If so, how and what is the level of engagement around the issues he is talking about? In the course of his address Mr. Sunderland stated, ""It is our understanding that the Bill is not intended to provide a legal basis for large structural government projects which would still need specific primary legislation provision for any data-sharing that would be required"". Will he elaborate on this? He also states, ""We would also expect to see significantly more detail to provide clarity in terms of how the governance ... and security arrangements ... are to be dealt with"". Will he also elaborate on this and give us a sense of where or how his concerns or flagged issues are being dealt with?"
11290	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	 Is Mr. Sunderland getting traction for that argument?
11291	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	 It is interesting that Mr. Sunderland has articulated this point. I speak from the research perspective and specifically in the health space to which Mr. Sunderland referred. I am going a little bit off kilter and am not speaking directly to the legislation here, but I am a great believer in the idea that if we are talking about longitudinal studies and anonymising data and so on, there is a mine of information that could be used effectively for positive societal outcomes, particularly in the area of health. I am trying to understand at present if there is a move or an initiative that would allow for that. We have the unique patient identifiers but is there a mechanism that we can drive in a country that is open and has a very strong research infrastructure, where we can begin to look at data and analyse it and drive positive outcomes?
11292	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	 I appreciate that. The Bill provides for what Mr. Sunderland describes as an unambiguous legal basis for data sharing between public bodies. Can any of the three witnesses articulate exactly what is meant by that? What are the underpinning conditions for an unambiguous legal basis? I have not yet read the legislation as we have not had sight of it. I am taking that on trust. I presume that in order to derive an unambiguous legal basis, one will have to be very prescriptive as to how that is done. In other words, he will be kicking the tyres to ensure the consumer, whose data are being used, will have the requisite protections built in.
11293	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	 Therefore, the underpinning will be in the statutory instrument, if I understood Mr. Sunderland correctly.
11294	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	 Not necessarily.
11295	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	 Mr. Sunderland should correct me if I am wrong.
11296	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	 When Mr. Sunderland speaks about the statutory instrument, will he articulate in simple language what it means for each public body? To be honest, I am unclear in my mind.
11297	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	 Where do the Department of Justice and Equality and Mr. Lowry stand on that issue?
11298	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	 If I am reading Mr. Carroll's intervention in a particular way, there is perhaps a suggestion that there are already robust legal mechanisms in place.
11299	SeanSherlock	Labour	16234.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-18 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	 From our perspective as the tribune of the people, we want to ensure - as does Mr. Carroll, I am sure - that the individual consumer, citizen or client will have the protections that are vital and that there will be a strong legal basis underpinning them. It seems, therefore, that there is still a little bit of work to be done in underpinning the robustness of the legislation to protect the consumer, which is fair enough. This meeting has been useful for me personally in understanding the dynamics. I want to ask one last question about complaints that might be made a consumer, client or citizen. What protections are built in? Mr. Lowry might wish to answer that question.

11312	SeanSherlock	Labour	16241.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	 Thus far this has been a very useful exercise for us in terms of the degree of enlightenment on the dynamics at play vis-à-vis the customs union, tariffs, the tax code and so on. However, we need to look at the matter in the context of the ongoing political discussions which are an iterative process, notwithstanding the rhetoric and the fact that there is a general election under way in the United Kingdom. This is a very useful exercise for us, particularly in gleaning the level of readiness of individual businesses or sectors for Brexit. Following on from the submissions made by Mr. Keegan and Ms Lynch, it appears that the level of readiness is poor. Ms Lynch has said 4% of Irish companies have sought external advice and support in meeting the implications of Brexit and that only one in 20 firms has a plan in place to deal with a potential customs border with the North following Brexit. Is it possible for businesses to do more? We do not yet know what the final outcome of the political negotiations will be and so there are all sorts of scenario in that regard. For example, there could be a hard Brexit, for which every business has to prepare, but we could also have a political solution, comprising outcomes of a lesser degree, including European economic area status and so on. I am trying to get a sense of what businesses need to do to be more ready. Is there more State organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Departments and local enterprise offices, LEOs, could do? In other words, is there more that needs to be done from the State's point of view to assist businesses to be ready for what is inevitable?

Mr. Cody referred to the postman coming to the door. Again, are we talking in theoretical terms pending the outcome of a final political negotiation? Until that is determined, the position is effectively the status quo. I will put it another way. Reading between the lines of the Revenue Commissioners' submission, I believe it provides us with some sort of framework of understanding regarding the challenges that present themselves. However, the Revenue Commissioners' planning, as Mr. Cody said, ""is based on the full range of possibilities, including the possibility that customs controls or processes will apply between Ireland and the UK"". Has Mr. Cody given us an insight into the full range of possibilities right down to the individual consumer? Are the Revenue Commissioners scenario-planning for the individual consumer, to go back to the postman knocking at the door, right up to the multinational company? That is what we want to get a sense of from today's engagement."

11318	SeanSherlock	Labour	16241.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	 I just wish to be clear about that.
11319	SeanSherlock	Labour	16241.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	 If I, for instance, have an eBay shop and am an online trader operating out of Cork, for the sake of argument, or anywhere else in Ireland, does Mr. Cody anticipate that I would have to get authorised economic operator, AEO, status, or am I misunderstanding the mechanism by which AEOs operate? Mr. Cody says there will have to be an increase in the number of AEOs. Would I be subject to this? More and more business is moving online now. Perhaps I am misunderstanding the nature of AEOs.

11331	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	 I welcome the three speakers. It has been quite informative and it is interesting to get their perspectives. I will start with the political-economic element of this. I want to kick the tyres a little bit. I do not think it follows that the direction of travel will be closer to European integration. The Franco-German alliance has been quite strong since the end of the Second World War. It may have been under threat but the election of Macron has settled it. I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath on the veto. The veto still exists and there is very clear, unambiguous messaging about Ireland's position on the veto. There are other smaller countries that potentially have similar positions to ours. It is not just one country on the western periphery setting its face against the 26. There will be other countries as well. The Dutch, the Danes and others might be in a similar position to us. I want to get the witnesses' perspective on it briefly because it is 5.04 p.m. We have until 5.30 p.m. but Deputy Tóibín wants to get in as well. The briefer the answers, the more we can get through. I want to get a sense of the BEPS and OECD process. As far as I am concerned, it is a transparent, open and clear process we have subscribed to as a country. Will the witnesses discuss it?
11332	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	 This is dead in the water.
11333	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	 What is the position if there is no political willingness, unanimity or treaty change any time soon? My opinion is woe betide any nation that tries to propose a referendum on any changes to the CCCTB or any matter of tax competency in the EU treaties. It would find it quite difficult.
11334	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	 I will park it for a second. I just wanted to make the point that I do not think the so-called new paradigm is necessarily a new paradigm. The Irish position is unambiguous. It depends on who is in government at a particular point in time. We will not be presumptuous. I want to talk about prudential supervision. Does Mr. Pat Lardner or Mr. Marc Coleman know how many new authorisations have been granted by the Central Bank across financial services in the past six or 12 months?
11335	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	 Is that as a result of the IDA strategy of going out and winning the business or because of corporate decisions?
11336	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	 Do we know how many changes there have been to existing operations in terms of new authorisations? There is an authorisation for a very specific activity. If one wants to change that activity they have to seek a change to the authorisation.
11337	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	 I am aware of that but I just wanted to get a perspective from the guys who are at the coalface of the industry.
11338	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	41	 I am asking because if the authorisation is changed it could change the type of activity. It could have an impact on the types of jobs whether they are front of house or back office.
11339	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	 In fairness to Mr. Coleman, he referred to FinTech earlier. That has the potential to be a game-changer around how business is done. This leads me then to seek a perspective from the witnesses on the existence of the European supervisory authorities, the Single Supervisory Mechanism for instance. If a company in the UK is thinking of moving outside of the City of London for instance, and I do not confine that to a geographical space but rather the City of London as we know it, and is thinking of moving to Dublin, it presumably still has to subscribe to those rules and adhere to those two regulatory mechanisms. I put it to the witnesses that the decision to locate in Dublin is a marginal call. It is a competition between Dublin, Paris, anywhere in Switzerland or effectively anywhere across Europe. The decision to move to Ireland may not necessarily be predicated only on the skill-set. I have worked in banking myself and anyone smart can be trained within a short eight-week window. There is not necessarily a need for a long apprenticeship; anybody can be trained in any country with the right type of approach. My point is that the call to move to Dublin could be predicated on quality of life indicators as much as regulatory or prudential supervisory ones. There is no certainty about this whatsoever, we are still in a nebulous space because the political negotiations are nowhere near getting down into the nitty-gritty yet. If we are talking about winning jobs post-Brexit, however, the decision to move to Dublin would not necessarily be predicated on the financial culture but more on the following question: can my employees live, work and exist in this city? That is as much a decision on the call to move here as anything else.
11340	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	47	 I am conscious of time so-----
11341	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	49	 Being deliberately parochial here, I suggest to Dr. Regan that an IDA Ireland strategy for those kinds of wins does not have to be centred on Dublin. It can be centred on Limerick or Cork if we are talking about quality of life indicators, because the technology allows for it now.
11342	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	74	" I will be brief, as I am under time constraints, so I apologise in advance. I welcome the submission. Were we seeking the Central Bank's state of play in the context of what is still arguably a nebulous process in terms of the politics of Brexit and the negotiations therein, this would be a good one. I will ask a simple question to seek a better understanding of the nature of authorisations. Mr. Sibley referred to ""currently authorised firms that are considering changes to existing operations and those that are considering seeking entirely new authorisations"". Will he give us a brief sense of what that means in real terms? What types of changes to those authorisations and new authorisations are being discussed? Will he break them down by sector? Do they relate to banks, fund managers, financial services and so on?"
11343	SeanSherlock	Labour	16246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-05-30 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	76	 That makes sense.

11357	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	108	 I would like to return to the tracker mortgage issue. Under the Central Bank review, as I understand it, where customers made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and where those complaints were actually upheld in Permanent TSB's favour, the complaints were also to become part of this review. Even where the FSO found against the customer, that customer was still to be contacted. I listened carefully to Mr. Mitchell's description of trying and failing to contact certain customers, but is Permanent TSB satisfied that it has contacted all customers? I ask that question because I have a specific case that could be representative of a sample of cases where the individual has not been contacted at all. This individual is still at the same address as before and continues to be a Permanent TSB customer. I worry that perhaps not everybody has been included in this investigation.
11358	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	110	" That is interesting. What does Mr. Mitchell mean when he says that they ""are in the process of being contacted""? That suggests to me that not everybody has been contacted."
11359	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	112	 Forgive me, I do not want to be too pedantic but I just want to really understand this.
11360	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	 The very specific case that I have was the subject of an FSO complaint. The individual in question should prima facie have been contacted but has not been. Could I correspond with the bank with regard to this specific case? I am worried that it could perhaps represent a sample of cases. That is my central point here.
11361	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	116	 Is Mr. Masding satisfied that Permanent TSB is fulfilling its legal obligations under data protection law? Let me be more specific. I assume the witnesses are aware that banks are legally obliged to retain all communications for six years after the ending of a product. A 30-year mortgage, for example, would result in a bank retaining records for 36 years. Is Mr. Masding satisfied that Permanent TSB is retaining all of those records with regard to correspondence with the customer, even where the customer makes a complaint? This might include phone records, emails or any kind of electronic communications with those customers.
11362	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	 The witnesses acknowledge, then, that there was a lapse. How systemic was that lapse and how many customers were affected by it? I ask the witnesses to be specific.
11363	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	124	 Absolutely. Again, one suspects that this is symptomatic. It goes back to the tracker mortgage issue where complaints where made to the FSO, where somebody sought records and was unable to obtain them from Permanent TSB. This weakened that individual's case and, indeed, rights. The bank was clearly in breach of the legislation in not retaining fully the records as per its obligations. The witnesses have acknowledged that in one case, but I would suggest, as with the one case I am referring to, there is probably more than one. The bank has acknowledged it will gladly accept correspondence from me relating to that, if I understand the witnesses correctly. I put it to the witnesses that the data protection law is the one protection the customer has when it hits the fan. If institutions such as Permanent TSB do not protect customers' rights in that respect, it is a serious failing.
11364	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	 How often does the bank correspond with or meet the regulatory authorities regarding its obligations under the Data Protection Act?
11365	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	128	 If the person to whom I am referring requests their records tomorrow, can they be satisfied that those records are retained?
11366	SeanSherlock	Labour	16367.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	130	 Pretend I am an ordinary customer. Can every customer be satisfied that their records-----

11377	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	9	 I thank the three witnesses for their very comprehensive opening statements. I also thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing the Bill forward, which the Labour Party will be supporting. I hail from the town of Mallow. It would not be fair to say that I was born in the flood but I was certainly baptised in the flood. I live less than 100 paces from the River Blackwater. If I threw a stone from my house, it would pretty much land in the Blackwater. I have first-hand experience of flooding incidences on the Munster Blackwater and I know that the schemes that have been put in place in Mallow and Fermoy demonstrably work. There is clear evidence that they work. There is no ambiguity about that whatsoever. The system of demountables that has been put in place has been extremely successful. I know of only one breach, which was in a very particular location and was due to an electrical fault on a pump, in the past ten years, and it has since been fixed. I, therefore, see no reason whatsoever for any entity or party to hold back flood insurance from any premises or business within the floodplains of Fermoy and Mallow. I concur with Deputy McGrath that we should not have to seek a legislative solution to this issue. What is the perception of the three witnesses of the memorandum of understanding and how it is operating as it relates to the OPW and Insurance Ireland? It appears to me that it merely seeks to share information and does not go beyond that. There does not appear to be any statement of principles. For instance, when the OPW kicks the tyres on a successful flood alleviation project, the OPW's word does not seem sufficient within that memorandum of understanding, MOU, to give assurances to any constituent member of Insurance Ireland that it can proceed to provide insurance in any areas covered by flood alleviation works. There seems to be a complete flaw in that regard. That is my first point and my first question. My second point - I would like the witnesses' perception of this - concerns something I find incongruous and contradictory about the involvement of a global player such as Arup. Arup's consulting engineers were engaged to assess the flood relief scheme in Mallow. The Lagan Group provided the consulting engineers on the second phase. Arup is a globally recognised company. It did not come to Mallow and carry out the works it did without itself having insurance. There are more than 100 names, including some very big ones, on the list of Insurance Ireland's members. Starting with the As, there is Accenture, American International Group, AIG, and Alliance; going down the list, there is Lloyds and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, BBVA. It is fair to assume that any one of these members of Insurance Ireland probably provided Arup with some degree of cover for the works it carried out. Therefore, it seems to me a contradiction that Insurance Ireland is happy to provide cover for consulting engineers who might provide works and kick the tyres on the works carried out, which then pass muster, and does not then provide cover after the fact, after the works have been successful - it is incontrovertible that they have been successful - for the people who benefit from the very schemes provided by companies such as Lagan and Arup. There is an inherent contradiction here. Furthermore, we are at a disadvantage here because Insurance Ireland always comes before the Oireachtas with one person as the representative of all of these insurance houses. I contend that we need to hear from individual voices who have provided insurance cover in the past but who do not have the guts, quite frankly, to come before us and give an account of their actions. I would like to hear from the witnesses how they perceive the contradictions I have just outlined. I want to ask another, more specific question. It is a very simple question. Forgive me if it is a stupid one. I have always thought that the principles of insurance cover were such that an insurance house or company was legally obliged to provide a quote and therefore had to provide cover. Mr. Kavanagh spoke about the issue of excess but, regarding instances of people I know and people he knows not being able to get insurance, I always thought there was a provision governing the principles of providing insurance that one had to at least provide a quote for cover. Perhaps the witnesses could provide me with some information on that. I will leave it at that for now. With the Chairman's indulgence, I might come back in for one more bite of the cherry.

Mr. Kavanagh referred earlier to the risk profile. The risk profile, as I understand it, has become so low. Is there something that needs to be done from an OPW point of view regarding mapping? I am aware of mapping that has been used by insurance companies. They sit at the desk, a customer phones them, they look at the map and they say the customer has been kicked out of the system because the map in the first instance is the guide they use. Could we do something to address the mapping issue beyond the mere desktop? In other words, if we started drilling down into the histories, the amount of moneys that have been spent on demountables, flood alleviation works, arterial drainage and so on, we could start to create a more accurate picture of what is actually happening in reality. I contend, and I would like to hear the witnesses' perceptions and opinions on this, that the OPW probably has to push harder against Insurance Ireland, in terms of how the memorandum of understanding actually operates.

Historically, very clear protocols were set in place, whereby early warning systems in place for local authority staff are in towns such as Mallow and Fermoy. It is pertinent we are speaking about Mallow and Fermoy because they will have a bearing on what happens in Cork city down the line, in terms of their early warning systems, which are now so robust that the response times of staff in local authorities are extraordinary. They are par excellence. This is because of the historical nature of flooding events. What I am trying to glean, and we will have an opportunity to ask the Minister, is where the local authorities actually feed into the OPW processes on early warning systems and those exchanges of information. What Mr. Kavanagh has articulated is that there is still a gap between Insurance Ireland and the OPW on a raft of issues that need to be articulated and highlighted.

To what extent are Insurance Ireland and its constituent members drilling down into the deployment protocols in respect of pending or rising flood waters? Take, for example, the Blackwater flows through Mallow and Fermoy, where there are demountable defences. To what extent have Insurance Ireland's constituent members seen at first hand or examined the protocols which exist in respect of those two towns' defences?
11390	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	153	" As I said in the previous session, I live in Mallow. I know Mallow and Fermoy intimately. I know that there is incontrovertible evidence that there are currently no risks in Mallow. It is a similar case in Fermoy. I am a little bit worried that Insurance Ireland is depending on the OPW, and on the information which flows up directly from local authorities to the OPW, to make decisions. I am worried that insurers are not actually going out on the ground when flooding events occur. I contend that Insurance Ireland's flood working group depends solely on what comes through from the local authorities, via the OPW and into this forum which Insurance Ireland has with the OPW. Mr. Thompson used the word ""anecdotally"". I do not want to up the ante on the rhetoric but ""anecdotally"" does not cut the mustard. I hope the witness will bear with me."
11391	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	155	 It is easy to deploy resources when there is a flood pending. It does not involve a big cost. It is a matter of sending somebody down to observe. Insurance Ireland's members need to be on the ground observing what is happening in real time for themselves. Insurance Ireland's members hold 95% of the domestic insurance market and 85% of the international life insurance market in this country. I do not see why they cannot go down to places such as Fermoy, Mallow and other areas which have been covered by capital works carried out by organisations such as the Lagan Group and Arup. Arup is a global leader. It carried out the flood alleviation works in Mallow. Arup recently conducted a study with Lloyds of London on offsetting or mitigating against risk for catastrophes owing to climate change in global cities. Lloyds is a member of Insurance Ireland. I acknowledge Mr. Thompson will not be able to respond to this but when Arup was doing the flood alleviation works as consulting engineers, its cover for insurance was being provided by one of the witness's constituent groups. I find it incongruous that Arup could be covered by one of Insurance Ireland's constituent groups and the works could be stood over but that after the fact, the people who rely on those works could not be covered by one of his constituent groups. Can Mr. Thompson understand the level of anger that exists in this regard? I believe some members of Insurance Ireland have already decided they absolutely and utterly will not provide flood cover regardless of what protocols Insurance Ireland puts in place or are covered by the memorandum of understanding, MOU. They have just taken a corporate decision. Mr. Thompson himself mentioned the profitability and risk profile earlier and because of that, they are just not going to get into or are withdrawing entirely from this market.

Mallow and Fermoy are classical examples of where the State has expended vast taxpayer resources to ensure that flood plains and the people in those areas are protected. They have worked. Does Mr. Thompson agree they have worked?
11396	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	165	 They have worked to date. Mr. Thompson is qualifying it. He remains to be convinced about the very protocols that have been tried and tested in towns like Mallow over decades, not years. This constitutes decades of corporate memory of the local authority where staff intergenerationally has clear systems put in place in both those towns. They are typical of examples throughout the country where flood works have been carried out. Mr. Thompson still appears to be doubting those very protocols because he said that Insurance Ireland deployed staff in Storm Ophelia. I defy anybody to have gone out on the Monday of Storm Ophelia because one would not put anyone outside the door on that day. He is referring to deploying after the fact and not before the fact. There must be a greater degree of willingness on the part of Insurance Ireland to drill down further and to start talking to local authority officials. As somebody who lives in the town, the process by which one would do that is not as formal, as formulaic or as systematic as I would like. I live 100 paces from the Blackwater River and I still have not seen the evidence of this happening in real time. Mr. Thompson has stated there are two processes, one being Insurance Ireland's own working groups and the other being through the OPW process. I would bet any money that the next time there is a pending flood in Mallow, one will not see any constituent member of Insurance Ireland going down there to talk to local authority officials or taking notes on whether the demountables are working. Incidentally, they clearly are working but I guarantee there is no process in place for that.

11398	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	169	 Let me put it in another way. Is it true that Mr. Thompson will know when the next flooding incident will occur on the Munster Blackwater?
11399	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	171	 No, I do not mean not after the fact. I refer to Insurance Ireland being serious about increasing coverage from 83% - the figure Mr. Thompson mentioned earlier - as there is still 17% to go. The members of Insurance Ireland cover 95% of the market. Mr. Thompson has told us that he wants to extend and grow the coverage. However, everything he is saying points to there still being many hoops to be jumped. Can Insurance Ireland or its constituent members give us an undertaking? In his own submission, Mr. Thompson has poured doubts over whether the legislation will work and over the Flood Re example in the UK. He is saying that the MOU is everything. It is the ship on which the insurance industry will sail. We have kicked the tyres on the MOU and no one here is absolutely convinced that the MOU is working. What we are trying to do, piecemeal, is work through a system whereby Insurance Ireland's members can be absolutely and utterly convinced that they have witnessed at first hand how the demountables are working because the witness is throwing doubt over the demountables. That is the evidence Mr. Thompson is giving here and he has cited two Irish examples. I want to ensure that Insurance Ireland and its members will be confident that the human error protocols that are put in place, for instance, by Cork County Council are so robust as to ensure the risk is absolutely and utterly mitigated. The only way I can be convinced of that is if people from the insurance industry are deployed on the ground when the early warning system kicks in and that there is a transparent protocol, to speak to Dr. Surminski's point, whereby we can all see that the insurance industry has been down there and is satisfied that the systems have worked.

There is nobody talking about discarding the MOU here. However, all the MOU provides for is an exchange of information. There are no obligations inherent within the MOU. Would Mr. Thompson agree?
11402	SeanSherlock	Labour	16423.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-23 00:00:00	Scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016	177	 That is all it is about.

I am not going to articulate what the principles are, but it could be contended that some of them could, in principle, be incorporated into the MOU as well. We would not be distorting competition. This would allow for pricing that reflects risk, which would deal with the excess issue. This would allow investment in flood risk-management activity and sustainable long-term approaches to flooding insurance. We have to kick the tyres on the MOU, because that is the only avenue that we have, as individual Members of the Oireachtas, to advocate for those who do not have flood insurance at the moment. Insurance Ireland needs to come a little bit further more quickly. Some of Mr. Thompson's language is encouraging, I will say that. He talks about a rate of coverage of 83% and efforts to increase that rate. We need to see the evidence of that much sooner. That is why my final question to him is this: has he received any correspondence, or had any discussions, with any of Insurance Ireland's members who stated absolutely and utterly that all the demountables in the world would not change their position of not providing insurance cover? Have any of Insurance Ireland's members ever come to Mr. Thompson and said that they would not provide cover, regardless of how much is spent and no matter what is done on rivers, river basins, arterial drainage schemes or whatever? Have any of his members said that they are getting out of that market and coverage is not going to happen?

Many of my questions have been addressed, so I will be very brief. I am very interested to hear Mr. Boland's and Mr. Maye's commentary. If I understand their statements correctly, they are saying the Sparkasse model would fill a gap in respect of lending. Could I get an understanding as to whether there is a geographical bias in this regard, so to speak? Are we talking about the midlands, the north west, the south west or the south east? If I understand Mr. Boland correctly, if there were a better lending model, there would be no need for another banking system. Do I understand him correctly, first, on the geographical considerations?
11440	SeanSherlock	Labour	16757.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-23 00:00:00	Report on Local Public Banking: Discussion	235	 It does.
11441	SeanSherlock	Labour	16757.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-23 00:00:00	Report on Local Public Banking: Discussion	237	 I take some comfort from the representative organisations' interventions today. If I read them correctly, they are stating they are open for business and ready to adopt new mechanisms to enhance their offerings and try to move into the very space referred to where there is a gap. The proof of this is, for instance, in CUMA and Mr. Molan's intervention on the 2016 regulations, in which he stated that in March commercial loans accounted for 1.9% of the €4.5 billion credit unions had out on loan, equivalent to 0.51% of their assets. Do the delegates take some comfort from these proceedings that there is scope, subject to a move by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and, one hopes, these Houses, for the credit union movement to step in and plug that gap?
11442	SeanSherlock	Labour	16757.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-10-23 00:00:00	Report on Local Public Banking: Discussion	239	 That is understood.

There was much discussion at this committee about that process. If I read the tone of the delegates' interventions today correctly, one senses that there has been some improvement in that relationship, or else they are couching their language in very careful terms. I do not know, but I would like to hear from the representative organisations about their perception of the relationship with the Central Bank in respect of regulation and the future of credit unions. Short interventions or answers will suffice. I will start with Mr. Johnson.

11453	SeanSherlock	Labour	16360.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-09-21 00:00:00	Special Meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs meeting with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement	18	 I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt. His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments on enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed. I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland. He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter. My first question is very simple. Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principles of parity of esteem and human rights protection are upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU? If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights? My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in The Observer on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position on citizens' rights. He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement. This is another simple question. How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years? I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.

11455	SeanSherlock	Labour	13705.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 I apologise for coming late to the meeting.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me in and forgive me if some of my points have already been covered.  In regard to the constituency I represent, Cork East, there is a deep sense that there is not a policy in respect of the delivery of home care packages.  I know of nobody who is in receipt of a specific home care package, particularly in the north Cork area.  The sense I have of the situation as it relates to north Cork is such that the policy is ad hoc and that it is a little arbitrary in that there is no consistency for each individual.  One relies on the service but one cannot be guaranteed that it will be delivered to a particular person in his or her home at a given time and it can be cut at a given time also.  We want a national policy or guideline that ensures each person has a minimum right.  I realise Mr. Mulvihill may have addressed that point already and if he has, I apologise but I want to record it anyway.
11456	SeanSherlock	Labour	13705.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 I thank the delegates for their presentation and for dealing so comprehensively with the questions.  I ask members to remain while the delegates leave to deal with minutes and some housekeeping items.
11457	SeanSherlock	Labour	13733.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	127	 I want to speak specifically on the reconfiguration process in so far as it relates to Mallow General Hospital.  I will be brief because I realise there are many questions to be answered today.  I raised this issue on the Adjournment last week and was given an undertaking by the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, that officials would be in touch with me to organise a meeting to discuss the acute services and the reconfiguration process as it pertains to Mallow General Hospital. I am concerned about the document that is being discussed internally.  It relates to ceilings of care, certain protocols and modelling systems that may be put in place by the HSE.  As a member of the Mallow General Hospital action committee and a representative of the people of Cork East, I believe this will have an adverse effect on the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services. Professor John Higgins states the reconfiguration process is about change management.  We are all in favour of the change that is necessary.  We were given undertakings that there would be no change to acute medical services and that they would be increased.  We were told there may be changes with regard to the delivery of accident and emergency services and acute surgical services.  The document I put into the public domain last week clearly contradicted that.  Trust has broken down.  We bought into a process with Professor Higgins whereby we accepted there would be ongoing negotiations with people such as the group I represent.  When the document came into my possession last week, it threw that process out the window.  Trust must be regained because it has been lost under Professor Higgins and the HSE with regard to the reconfiguration process. Some members may feel the advisory group comprises a wonderful approach that espouses lateral thinking.  However, when a secret advisory group is put in place and people who have bought into the reconfiguration process and who are trying to manage change, such as the people I represent, are not being consulted on that process or the internal document, it makes a mockery of the whole process.  I seek a meeting with the head of the HSE and the people who are in charge of reconfiguration at national and local levels.  That is all I want.
11458	SeanSherlock	Labour	13733.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	127	 On behalf of the members I thank Professor Drumm for his five years of service.  At that time he took on what looked like being probably the most challenging position in the Irish public service.  That took courage and it probably took more courage to stay with the position over the past five years.  It has been very turbulent.  I think history will record that he led the service through significant positive change and the nation owes him a large debt of gratitude.  His successor will have big shoes to fill.  We wish him well but we wish Professor Drumm success in whatever course he decides to follow.  I thank him for his courtesy over the years.

I am not a member of this committee but there has been specific reference to Cork, about which I have a few questions. Begging the indulgence of the members, while we are on the theme of Cork and the governance issue, I ask for some forbearance to ask one or two questions while it is the hot topic. Obviously, I will be guided by the members and the Chairman on that matter.
11460	SeanSherlock	Labour	16115.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-19 00:00:00	National Maternity Strategy: Discussion	41	 I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and the committee for allowing me, as a non-member, to pose some questions. I will endeavour to be very brief. I refer specifically to the issue of governance, particularly as it relates to Cork University Maternity Hospital which the Minister visited last week. Following the visit I asked a parliamentary question about the engagement with clinicians at the hospital. I am particularly delighted that Professor Louise Kenny is here. I acknowledge publicly the work she has done, particularly as a principal investigator and a Science Foundation Ireland funding awardee. I also acknowledge the work being done at the infant centre at Cork University Maternity Hospital where the research conducted is world class. To get down to brass tacks, my parliamentary question was related specifically to the issue of waiting lists for gynecological services. We have had an articulation of the pressures and the potential for the presentation of cancer cases in the absence of proper and timely interventions. When I asked the Minister what his intentions were on waiting lists, he replied: I am assured that the 2017 NTPF waiting list initiative will help to alleviate some of the difficulties in Cork. In 2017, the NTPF will have an allocation of €20 million and, in the first instance, in the region of €5 million will be targeted at day case procedures. The NTPF anticipate that 2,500 of the longest waiting day case patients, including patients on the CUMH waiting list, will be treated under this initiative. My question is very simple. Is the National Treatment Purchase Fund the proper mechanism under which women waiting to be seen at Cork University Maternity Hospital should be dealt with? I have my doubts about whether the National Treatment Purchase Fund is the correct mechanism or the most appropriate solution to this problem and I ask Professor Kenny and her colleagues for their views in that regard. There are two theatres in Cork University Maternity Hospital, but I understand only one is open and four days a week. As such, it is operating at a sub-optimal level. I ask for the perspective of Professor Kenny of how this is impacting on services and whether, if the two theatres were operating at the optimum level, that would be the best use of resources.
11461	SeanSherlock	Labour	16115.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-01-19 00:00:00	National Maternity Strategy: Discussion	43	 In that case let me couch it in the language of the national maternity strategy. If we are to have a fully operational national maternity strategy, there is a governance issue, to which the delegates have referred. It is evident by any objective analysis of the operation of Cork University Maternity Hospital under the umbrella of Cork University Hospital has been to the detriment of health services for women. There is a very clear, linear connection. I am trying to ascertain something on the governance issue that has been referred to and relate it to the south/south west hospital group. We are being told that the HSE's national women and infants health programme and maternity networks will be established across hospital groups, if it has not already been done. My question is whether, if Cork University Maternity Hospital is part of the south/south west hospital group, it is being represented adequately within the group such that there are transfers of funding and resources from the parent hospital in a manner which ensures services are delivered for women.

11469	SeanSherlock	Labour	16381.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-12 00:00:00	Electoral (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Discussion	19	 I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for giving me a hearing today. The Bill is self-explanatory. Microbeads and other microplastics are used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products such as scrubs, soaps, lotions and toothpastes. They are added to these products to make the product more abrasive or for decoration. The Bill is a follow-on Bill based on a Green Party Bill put forward by Senator Grace O'Sullivan. I acknowledge the role of the Green Party in bringing forward the issue in the first instance. Our Bill seeks to follow on from that and to strengthen the Bill to allow for us to legislate. Section 2 provides for the prohibition of microplastics. It provides that a person who manufactures, sells, exposes, offers, advertises, keeps for sale, imports or attempts to import into the State for sale any cosmetic containing microplastics is guilty of an offence. A cosmetic is defined as meaning any cosmetic or personal care product, including but not limited to facial scrubs, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste. Microplastic is defined as meaning plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter. The section provides that a person guilty of an offence is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment of 12 months or both and, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for five years or both. Provision is made for the liability of directors, managers, secretaries etc. of corporate bodies where they consent to or connive in the commission of an offence by the corporate body. The section provides that it is a defence for an accused person to prove he or she did not know and had no reason to suspect the cosmetic in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed contained microplastics. That is it in a nutshell. I have brought forward my Bill on the basis that I believe the State should move to legislate. I understand the Government stated its intention to legislate on an earlier Stage. On Second Stage of the Bill such a commitment was made. I have not had sight of any Government proposal to legislate for the prohibition of microplastics yet. I am hopeful we can keep this issue on the agenda. If the Government is to legislate for this and if we see the heads of a Bill coming from Government, I would be very happy to withdraw or amend my legislation. Until such time as that happens, I hope to keep the Bill on the agenda. If the Second Stage debate is anything to go by, it is something on which there is a willingness across party political lines to legislate for and to be seen as taking leadership on globally, given we are a maritime nation. The scourge of microplastics is something that is having untold health consequences for sea life. We now have evidence that it is finding its way into the food chain. It is quite an important issue. I am hopeful the committee will retain the legislation or allow for safe passage of the legislation.
11470	SeanSherlock	Labour	16381.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-12 00:00:00	Electoral (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Discussion	22	 There may be a defence by the Government on this to the effect that there are Single Market implications for the introduction of legislation of this nature. I appreciate that the then Minister communicated with Commissioner Vella. I am not sure what the status of that interaction is at present but there is a precedent when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, introduced the smoking ban. It could have been argued at that time that it could have run contrary to some of the treaty provisions relating to the Single Market but as it was subsequently deemed successful as a measure, the same could apply here. The important point is that a number of countries have signed up to the principle of banning microplastics. This goes as far back as December 2014 in respect of the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden. A joint press statement was released by these countries calling for the ban and the political willingness is there. Regarding the communication from the Commission, I have not seen a legislative proposal or Commission proposal as of yet regarding this issue. It may be there; I may have missed it. However, I believe, as Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, that there is a strong willingness within the community for Ireland to take a lead on that and that is the main purpose of the legislation.
11471	SeanSherlock	Labour	16381.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-10-12 00:00:00	Electoral (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Discussion	25	 I do not have any specific information about what is happening in other countries throughout the EU. I am basing my legislation very much on policy and principles and am seeking to find a mechanism through the Irish Legislature as to how we can design robust legislation for this issue. I have a very open mind about this. I would be quite happy were the Government to decide to take my legislation and to amend it significantly to allow for legislative passage of the Bill. I would very much welcome a further deliberation, if necessary, by this committee on some of those questions. If the committee decided that it was necessary to have further deliberations with outside persons such as experts in the field, I would be very happy to take part in that. This Bill seeks to strengthen the Green Party Bill because the rebuttal by Government of that Bill was on the basis that it could run contrary to Single Market or treaty provisions. We have built into the legislation what we hope is a strengthening of that. A research report commissioned by the Commission in January 2016 stated it was unclear as to whether any of the existing directives or regulations that had been identified would be suitable. The EU is in a space at present where it has not come to a definitive position on this. It seems to be an iterative process. There is a school of thought that says that the Canadian and US legislation may not necessarily be transferable to an EU scenario. I have no doubt that there are challenges to passing this legislation but if we can move to the principle of the legislation and if this House decides that it wants to legislate for this, we can find ways of doing so.

11475	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	 It is my Bill and I have many questions but I am conscious that I am a guest of the committee.
11476	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	 I thank the members. I thank the officials and the academics for their attendance today because I believe that having this opportunity to interact with them is a crucial part of the legislative process. I view it as a free tutorial, for which I am very grateful. I also thank the Chair and the members of the committee for facilitating the discussion this morning. The key point that emerges from the evidence before us is that there is no doubt but that there is clear evidence of the presence of microfibres and microbeads in sea life and on land, having been washed ashore. The witnesses have presented clear evidence of that today. The Dublin Bay prawn presented is a very distinct piece of evidence to that effect. I believe this makes the legislation all the more worthwhile in that sense. I appreciate the point being made about the legislation I have introduced. It deals specifically with microbeads that, according to the presentation, represent a small fraction in sea life and flora and fauna. However, my Bill is a first or a second cut. This is an iterative process and I am not tied to the fact that it should deal only with microbeads. I am quite happy for it to be amended in any way to reflect the realities of the science presented before us. If that means dealing with microfibres or any other particles present that fall into the general microplastic group, then I have no qualms about that whatsoever. The key thing is that we are at a juncture where we are acknowledging there is a need to legislate on this issue. It needs to be done post-haste. My first question is to the officials, namely, Mr. Harrington and Mr. O'Connor. They mentioned that the heads of a Bill will come before us or that a Bill is being worked on. Can they be more specific on when that Government Bill will come before the House?
11477	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	 I appreciate that and that is clear evidence of action by the Government in this regard. While this not a remark directed at the officials per se but is more a political statement, I must state that this legislation has been in gestation since 2016. I had hoped we would be further along the line at this stage because I have always expressed my willingness to withdraw my Bill were more robust legislation to come along. This is a non-partisan and a non-political issue. I want to take a bipartisan approach to this matter. I still feel the need to ensure my legislation is kept on the books until such time as I see evidence from the Government as to the seriousness of its intentions. That is notwithstanding the additional resources which have been allocated to this. I refer back to the originator of the legislation, who is Senator Grace O'Sullivan. We are only taking up the cudgel on this. However, we do need to see this Government legislation sooner rather than later. I welcome the fact that Mr. Harrington is seeking permission within a month to draw up heads of a Bill. I am anxious that the clock might tick down on the lifetime of the Government or that its mandate may expire. It is a Private Members' Bill. I am conscious that if Mr. Harrington is talking about the summer months for this, it then will not be long until we are into the autumn and then into 2019. We do not know what is going to happen then. As I understand it, my Private Members' Bill falls on the ending of that mandate.

11479	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	 I appreciate those comments. I recognise Mr. Harrington is speaking for the Minister here. However, we will have an opportunity to talk to the Minister directly about this as well and kick the tyres on his commitments. I will return briefly to the science again, just for a moment. The scientific rigour that has been applied here shows us that the research in an Irish context is nascent in the grand narrative of things. It is from 2014 I think. I acknowledge the witnesses probably have all been working in this area prior to this. Can I get a sense from the witnesses as to where the Legislature needs to go on this issue? That is pulling them from the realm of pure academic research into the realm of politics. I am directing this at Dr. Nash. If she was designing legislation or a response to the scourge of microplastics and microbeads, this plastic pollution that is killing our flora and fauna and being ingested by human beings, where would she go, where would she start or what would she do? It is a tough one but I just want to get the perspectives of the witnesses on it because I think it is vital.
11480	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	 Forgive me, does that mean more time is needed to design the legislation? If the legislation is to be designed in a robust way, does it need a stronger scientific and research basis? Is Dr. Nash stating that industry needs to be involved because the generators of these plastics need to be involved? Is she talking about a more holistic approach?
11481	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	 Just-----
11482	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	 To be helpful, I recognise that Dr. Nash is saying that it is too narrow and that microbeads, based on the evidence put forward from Nephrops norvegicus, were only something like 2% of the content and 75% was microfibres. That makes the legislative proposal before us here quite narrow. We could legislate for microbeads, but the point is we need legislation with much broader scope because, based on the evidence before us, microbeads only represent a portion of the plastics used. In that sense, the legislation is quite narrow.
11483	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	 As I am conscious of time and the format being used, I am happy to stop and come back in at the end of the process, with the Chairman's permission.
11484	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	45	 Is Cuala the GAA-----
11485	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	53	 As the originator of the Bill, the Deputy is correct in the sense that the initial mood of the Government and the speech that was distributed to us on the night of the Second Stage debate was in opposition to the Bill. There have been some discussions with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to his credit and he decided subsequently to come on board. I think Deputy Barry is correct in that sense.
11486	SeanSherlock	Labour	16548.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	57	" I am again conscious of time. My Bill is very simple and it deals with a bespoke element of the entirety of the challenge - microbeads. I am very happy to change the title of my Bill to call it the prohibition of microbeads Bill 2016 or such. This is where the scientific research has been invaluable to us. It really explains to us just how large the scope is and the methodology that one needs to underpin all of the research, and that work is ongoing. The wording of my Bill is ""any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence"". I allow for summary offences. It calls for penalties if one manufactures, sells or imports. I also set out what would be actually banned. These are all what I would call products of conspicuous consumption. They are not necessities. They include a ""personal care product including but not limited to a facial scrub, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste"". We are not banning those products but we are banning products of that nature that contain microbeads. We have a scientific definition of microbeads. My Bill is very simple. Notwithstanding the Government's intention, I cannot see what it is that the committee will produce that is more robust or comprehensive than this if we are dealing specifically and only with the issue of microbeads. That is the point I really want to make. I welcome this interaction and the bona fides of the Department officials. I recognise the challenge. Maybe the wording of my Bill needs work and I acknowledge that. One could amend my Bill to say that microbeads or microplastics means plastic particles of less than 5 mm in diameter, for instance. In one fell swoop, the legislation would remove an array of products for which there is incontrovertible proof that they find their way into watercourses. That could be done in a very short time. That was also the intention of Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill before it was opposed. I do not see why that could not be done at an early juncture while working on the wider issues of marine litter in parallel. The witnesses came here with the issue of marine litter very firmly in their sights. Finally, I return to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point that the funding for research on this is something that needs to be looked at. I will go to Science Foundation Ireland and will speak to the Minister and the Marine Institute to see if there is a mechanism. It may be that there is a mechanism for researching this area in terms of societal challenges through Horizon 2020. I was at the negotiating table for Horizon 2020 and recall that this was looked at as one of the societal challenges and that there should be funds available for this. It would not take a lot of money to buttress the research that the witnesses are doing which is vital if we are looking at the entirety of the coastline of Ireland."

11503	SeanSherlock	Labour	14545.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Forthcoming Competitiveness Council Meeting: Discussion with Minister of State	2	" I thank members for giving me the opportunity to provide a summary of the outcome of the previous Competitiveness Council and discuss the agendas for the meetings in Luxembourg on 10 and 11 October.  I will also briefly apprise the joint committee of my Department's priorities for the EU Presidency in 2013.  I am accompanied by Mr. Tommy Murray and Mr. Pat Kelly from my Department and Mr. Tim Cullinane from the Department of Education and Skills. I will begin by dealing with the outcome of the previous Council in May.  It was a two day meeting attended by my colleagues, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, who dealt with Internal Market and industry issues and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Perry, who dealt with research and space issues on the second day.  A ministerial informal lunch attended by Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and Commissioner Vassiliou provided an opportunity to review the achievements of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT, to draw lessons for the future, as well as to engage in an exchange of views. Among the main decisions reached at the Council on research issues were: the Horizon 2020 framework programme for research and innovation; the EIT; and  Council conclusions on European innovation partnerships.  In respect of the Internal Market, decisions were reached on the competitiveness and SME programme,  COSME, for the period 2014-20, the Single Market Act and the governance of the Single Market and the Digital Single Market.  The Council agreed to the main elements of the COSME programme. I now turn to the forthcoming Council meeting which will take place on 10 and 11 October. The first day will deal with the research items and the second day will deal with the industry and Internal Market issues. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will attend the Council on 11 October to deal with issues relating to the internal market and industry. I will deal with the research items. On the research side, the main issues are a proposal for an amending regulation establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The debate during the ministerial lunch will consider the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the rules for participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020, and a communication from the Commission, A Reinforced European Research Area Partnership for Excellence and Growth. The European Commission will present its communication and associated recommendation on better access to scientific information. On the Internal Market and industry side the main issues are: adoption of a Council regulation on a communication from the Commission, A European Consumer Agenda - Boosting Confidence and Growth; a presentation by the Commission of its mid-term review findings on the implementation of the EU flagship on industrial policy; a ministerial discussion devoted to the proposed improvements to the operation of the competitiveness council; another presentation by the European Commission on the cultural and creative sectors for creative growth in the EU; adoption of Council conclusions on key enabling technologies and the European innovation partnership on raw materials; and a debate on the state of play in relation to the Single Market Act I, initiated by the Cypriot Presidency. I will deal initially and briefly with the Internal Market and industry issues. In terms of the consumer agenda, the European Commission published its communication A European Consumer Agenda - Boosting Confidence and Growth on 22 May 2012. The agenda is intended to support consumer interests in the areas identified by the consumer markets scoreboard as being most problematic for consumers, namely food, energy, financial services, transport services and digital services. The communication identifies four main objectives for the agenda: reinforcing consumer safety, enhancing consumer knowledge, improving enforcement and redress and aligning rights and key policies to economic and societal change. It also identifies key measures needed to empower consumers, boost their trust and put consumers at the heart of all EU policies as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 goals. The Presidency is seeking the endorsement of the communication by way of the draft resolution which it has tabled on the agenda. Ireland endorses the agenda's four key objectives and acknowledges the significance of the consumer agenda in terms of its potential contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Accordingly, Ireland is happy to support the draft resolution on the consumer agenda as proposed by the Presidency and is committed to working with other member states and the European institutions to ensure the timely achievement of the agenda's objectives. Under the agenda item of the Commission's communication on industrial policy review, the Commission will present its mid-term review findings on the implementation of the EU flagship on industrial policy. This flagship, which was launched by the Commission in October 2010 under the Europe 2020 strategy, aims to boost growth and jobs by maintaining and supporting a strong, diversified and competitive industrial base in Europe offering well-paid jobs, while becoming more resource-efficient. The mid-term review of the industrial policy flagship will be published as a communication by the Commission in October 2012 and will review progress on implementing the flagship. I believe it will focus on developing a limited number of further initiatives to tackle the consequences of the economic crisis and that it can deliver sustainable results in the short to medium term. In general, as a priority, the review must deal with new instruments to address access to finance, especially for SMEs, and to promote SMEs and their inherent added value to a competitive industrial Europe. Strengthening the Single Market must also be of paramount importance. The European Commission's communication on the strategy for sustainable competitiveness of the construction sector and its enterprises sets out a number of initiatives that are aimed at taking action to support jobs and provide opportunities in the sector. While we will never see a return to pre-recession levels of employment in the construction sector, we need an economy that plays to our strengths across a variety of sectors. Construction, therefore, still has an important role to play in helping to rebuild our economy. The communication notes that there are new opportunities for the sector that support the EU's objectives in moving to a low-carbon economy to take advantage of the emerging opportunities. The European Commission will present its communication on cultural and creative sectors for creative growth in the EU. Ireland welcomes the initiative and looks forward to working with the Commission in developing programmes under the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, that will assist in the recovery of both the Irish economy and the European economy. It will be a difficult challenge but one to which the cultural and creative sectors can contribute strongly in a positive way. On 26 June the European Commission tabled its strategy to boost the industrial production of key enabling technology-based products such as innovative products and applications of the future. The Council of Ministers will be asked to adopt the current conclusions and to welcome the Commission's communication entitled Making Raw Materials Available for Europe's Future Well-being - Proposal for a European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials; call on the Commission to launch the European innovation partnership, EIP, on raw materials and to develop and finalise the strategic implementation plan by the end of 2013; and invite the Commission to report to the Council by the end of July 2013 on progress achieved in the raw materials EIP, particularly with regard to the strategic implementation plan. Ireland supports the adoption of the Council conclusions. While we, with some other member states, remain sceptical about the added value of EIPs, we are prepared to support this initiative. Ireland's main concern has been to ensure that member states through the Council retain the right to approve EIPs and that EIPs are not a means to determine research priorities outside institutional procedures. These issues have been addressed satisfactorily from our point of view. The Presidency will present a state of play report on the implementation of the 12 priorities under the Single Market Act I package. In the context of my Department's Presidency competitiveness agenda, there will be a particular focus on finalising those priorities in the Single Market Act I which have not yet been completed. My Department, through the interdepartmental committee on the Single Market and services directive, will co-ordinate with other relevant Departments on how the Cypriot Presidency proposes to deal with the Single Market Act II package and any individual files emanating from the Commissioner's proposals with a view to finalising agendas for relevant working groups during the Irish Presidency. We are looking forward to working collaboratively with the Council and Commission to ensure we finalise those measures that are not concluded by the end of the year and we are looking forward to the challenge of instigating work on the new measures announced by Commissioner Barnier in the next phase of the Single Market. In regard to research issues, in November 2011 the Commission submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council its proposal for a regulation amending the original regulation which established the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. This has been intensively examined in the research working party and delegations have generally welcomed the Commission's proposal. As the EIT will be an integral part of Horizon 2020, and implemented in accordance with its rules for participation and dissemination, an amendment to the existing regulation is needed to align EIT within Horizon 2020. I shall comment further on Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020. In the context of the negotiations on Horizon 2020, the EU’s next funding programme for research and development, the Cypriot Presidency will propose a compromise text of the rules for participation and dissemination for approval by the Council of Ministers. As the proposal requires co-decision with the European Parliament, I expect trilogue negotiations between the Council, Parliament and Commission to be commenced under Ireland’s Presidency. It will be a priority for me to complete these trilogue negotiations and secure agreement on Horizon 2020 during the Presidency. With regard to European research areas or ERAs, the European Commission will make a presentation on a reinforced European research area partnership for excellence and growth. The overarching objective of the European Commission is to open up and connect EU research systems, thus leading to a significant improvement in Europe’s research performance to promote growth and job creation. More joined up and smarter specialisation across member states will be a significant milestone en route to a fully developed European research area and will avoid costly overlaps and unnecessary duplication of activities. The Irish Presidency will highlight the importance of joint programming in addressing the fragmentation of research in Europe and its role in contributing to the achievement of the European research area. On research careers, the Irish Presidency will provide an opportunity to assess progress and map out outstanding issues in the area. With regard to better access to scientific information, the concept of open access to publicly-funded scientific data has been around for some time, having first been put forward by the Commission and endorsed by the Council. Progress on open access to scientific data has been slow due to a number of barriers identified in the Commission communication. In brief, these are: the potential of the Internet for improving access to scientific information has not been fully exploited; the low level of investment in the scientific dissemination system; the uneven and unco-ordinated actions by the different member states; the costs associated with the process of selecting, reviewing and publishing articles; and the lack of financing for rapidly emerging e-infrastructures and thematic data infrastructures for storing and providing access to data. In addition, funding has tended to be short lived and fragmented. It is often related to specific projects only and has not provided long-term solutions. The Commission communication encourages all member states to intensify their efforts to implement open access and follows up the communication with a recommendation for endorsement by the European Parliament and the Council. It calls on the member states to implement open access and to report back to the Council on progress 18 months after the recommendation and every two years, thereafter. In order to give effect to this, each member state is instructed to designate by the end of 2012 a national point of reference whose tasks will be as follows: to co-ordinate the measures listed in the recommendation; to act as interlocutor with the European Commission on questions pertaining to access to and preservation of scientific information; and to report on the follow-up to the recommendation. Ireland is supportive of the proposal to implement open access to scientific information and allows for the protection of legitimate commercial interests. We are conscious that there may be significant cost factors involved in establishing the necessary e-infrastructures for data storage. There may also be legal barriers to implementation across the EU which must be addressed. There are a small number of ""any other business"" items on the agenda. Of significance are the items that relate to communication on enhancing and focusing international co-operation in research and the Single Market Act II, as mentioned earlier. I shall comment on the communication on enhancing and focusing international co-operation in research. The European Commission will present its communication dated 14 September entitled Enhancing EU International Co-operation in Research and Innovation. The communication sets out a new strategy to help the European Union maximise the opportunities presented by globalisation of research and innovation. Obviously the Single Market Act II is the second phase of the Single Market Act and comprises a new set of 12 priority actions. The Single Market Act II will be presented in the form of a Commission communication by Commissioner Barnier, as indicated earlier. I shall now discuss the Department's priorities for the EU Presidency 2013. My Department will play a central role in driving the EU policy agenda embodied in the overarching policy theme of “Promoting sustainable economic growth and jobs and building Europe’s competitive advantage""."
11504	SeanSherlock	Labour	14545.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Forthcoming Competitiveness Council Meeting: Discussion with Minister of State	8	" With the permission of the Chair, I will call on my officials, Mr. Tommy Murray and Mr. Pat Kelly, on some of the technical issues.  I was not aware of the sunset clause to which Senator Quinn referred, but I will defer to Mr. Murray to answer that specific question.  The issues relating to food are in the health silos but we have a prioritisation action group which is a research prioritisation exercise.  We have streamlined what must be done.  The country needs to engage in 14 key areas of research, and food is one of those areas.  Teagasc would be one of the stakeholders in the prioritisation action group because we are trying to set out a new stall that does not put its eye on basic research or blue sky research but moves to an area where we get a closer alignment with industry.  It is the collaboration between academia and industry that will drive jobs growth.  On the announcement by Teagasc that it was trialling potato crops in certain parts of the country, I would have no problem on the basis that there is an inherent trust in the work that Teagasc does and there is a growing realisation that the exponential increase in global populations deems it that we as a country must engage in new technologies to ensure the people on this planet can feed themselves.  That is the high level view but if one is drilling down into a more granular level that should present opportunities for Ireland. I take Senator Quinn's point on innovations in that regard.  I have an open mind but it is within the health remit.  That is not to kick the issue to touch.  I am always happy to engage further on that agenda if needs be because I firmly believe we must grapple with it at some stage. Senator Quinn made the point that the State should create the environment for the entrepreneur.  The architecture of the action plan for jobs was based on engaging with industry, employers, business groups and so on.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, issued an invitation to those groups to come up with ideas.  The State has a clear role.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is being driven directly by the Taoiseach through the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs.  In my area of responsibility, research and innovation, there is a very clear sense of driving new messages to academia in terms of trying to foster greater collaboration with industry through the prioritisation action group.  We do a great deal of work on the foreign direct investment side of the house but the clear challenge is to try to create more indigenous companies arising from that.  There is a greater role for the State to play in facilitating innovation.  The State agencies are feeding into the action plan for jobs.  The Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs has a results-driven agenda. Deputy Seán Kyne raised the issue of raw materials. We may have a traditional view of them in terms of what can be derived from the earth. For example, at the CRANN Institute in Trinity College Dublin or the Tyndall National Institute, housed near UCC, material science is becoming ever more important as a subject in driving new innovations down to hand-held technology in the use of mobile phones and so on. When distilled to its most basic level, t is how we are driving energy projects, data production and so on in terms of the use of raw materials to drive new technological advances. The partnerships will target non-energy and non-agricultural raw materials, including but not limited to the European Union's list of critical raw materials. It covers metallic industrial and construction materials, as well as other industrial raw materials such as natural rubber and wood. Many of these materials are vital inputs for innovative technologies that offer environmentally friendly clean-tech applications. They are also essential for the manufacture of crucial alloys and products required by modern society. That is the Commission's definition in its own words. On the issue of open access, we have an intellectual property protocol which was signed off on this year. Academic papers are available to everybody as a source material when individuals are completing doctorates and so on. On the interface between academia and industry, there is a need to set out some rules of engagement because if there is private capital for research, one must ensure there is a protocol in place for how that funding is used. However, where there is publicly funded research, a protocol is in place in terms of the interaction involved. If we were to examine the issue of open access from a global perspective and the European Union was to compete globally with other hegemonic areas of the globe such as the US or Asia, the greater the degree of co-ordination on strategies to enable open access the greater the level of competitiveness that can be driven on a pan-European basis. If Ireland is ahead of the curve on an EU-wide basis, that puts it in the early mover stage which will allow us to benefit from potential financial packages arising from EU programmes. For example, the Government will deal with open data systems as one of the disrupter technologies and see how we can secure a greater degree of co-ordination across Departments and between industry and government in respect of how we can mind more of the information derived in every day life in order that we become a first mover in that space. I hope that deals adequately with the question put by Deputy Seán Kyne. I will refer the questions on the consumer agenda, the Single Market Act and the progress made on smart regulation to Mr. Murray. On my own agenda, we have set targets in regard to access to finance. The next Horizon 2020 framework programme for which I will have specific responsibility could ""potentially"" be an €80 billion package, subject to the multiannual financial framework. If it is an €80 billion package, we hope the research prioritisation exercise in which we are engaged in 14 key priority areas that we are going to fund will align with the Horizon 2020 framework programme priorities. Arising from this, the target figure would be upped from 15% to 20% in terms of SME engagement. We need to ensure greater engagement by SMEs. In Ireland I understand work on the foreign direct investment aspect of the puzzle is progressing well in terms of that engagement with the research community, but we need to do more to ensure more indigenous companies thrive. I will refer the overall arching issue of access to finance to Mr. Murray."

To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Bruton regarding his interaction with Commissioner Barnier, there is a determination to distil the Act into areas where Ireland has an interest.  In terms of the Presidency we are talking about the proposed establishment of a high level group on services to business and progressing the digital Single Market agenda, especially building confidence measures in cross-border transactions.  With regard to the cloud computing sector, there is the language of the SME access to capital markets, access to banking services, a professional qualifications directive and issues around public procurement.  I agree with the Acting Chairman that the language used is arcane and does not reflect the vernacular or everyday usage.  In terms of an engagement with 27 member states, it is a language that people subscribe to but I take his point. By way of example, the Department is determined to ensure that when Council meetings take place, we can distil the language of the Commission's proposals or Council regulations into a language that can be disseminated in a way that every person, including Ministers, can grapple with.

Hence, the communication between the Minister, Deputy Bruton and Commissioner Barnier.  There will be an impetus during the first six months of the Presidency to drive results and reduce regulations in the SME sector.  Over-regulation is a key impediment to SME competitiveness.  Today, the Department wants to disseminate the message that reducing regulation is one of the key themes of the Irish Presidency.  We wish to assist small businesses that the Acting Chairman talked about.

11513	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	46	 I thank Deputies and Senators for their kind remarks on the Presidency. I concur that our Department is not seen as a shining light relative to others in respect of what we have delivered. I add to the comments of the Minister by saying that many of our officials had to up tent and pegs to Brussels for six months, leaving their families and significant others behind, to chair working groups and participate in hundreds of meetings. They had to chair trilogues with a gargantuan effort. Perhaps it is easy for us to walk into a chamber of Ministers and other colleagues and just take the plaudits, so I also officially record my gratitude to the officials for the work they have done. Horizon 2020 is a win for Ireland as we successfully concluded a package which is worth €70 billion, and within that there is potential for Ireland to surpass the framework programme target of €600 million. I do not see why we cannot reach a target of €1 billion of a drawdown during the lifetime of the next programme. It was fortuitous that the co-decision procedure allowed us to conclude those negotiations, which I chaired. They were concluded with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and the rapporteurs within the European Parliament. The research part of the Competitiveness Council will deal with the follow-on from those negotiations, dealing with issues related to the next EU framework for research and innovation, Horizon 2020, the innovation union and the European research area. During our Presidency, Ireland successfully negotiated a political agreement on the proposals for the EU’s €70 billion research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020. Research and innovation are key drivers of growth and job creation. The strategic approach to research and innovation contained in Horizon 2020 will develop, diffuse and drive research across the European Union. The Competitiveness Council will receive presentations from the European Commission on proposals for an investment package of more than €22 billion under Horizon 2020 over the next seven years in innovation for sectors that deliver high quality jobs. Most of the investment will go to five public private partnerships in innovative medicines, aeronautics, bio-based industries, fuel cells and hydrogen, as well as electronics. These research partnerships will boost the competitiveness of EU industry in sectors that already provide more than 4 million jobs and also find solutions to major challenges for society that are not being solved quickly enough by the market alone, such as reducing carbon emissions or providing the next generation of antibiotics. The package also includes four public public partnerships, so-called, between the European Commission and EU member states on new treatments against poverty related diseases, measurement technologies for industrial competitiveness, support for high tech small and medium enterprises and solutions for the elderly and disabled to live safely in their homes. The council will also receive presentations from the European Commission on its communication on the State of the Innovation Union 2012 - Accelerating Change and on Measuring Innovation Output in Europe: Towards a New Indicator, and on progress on the European research area. The communication on the State of the Innovation Union 2012 notes significant progress towards setting the policy framework for an innovation union in various areas accelerating the development and uptake of innovations to address societal challenges. The business environment in Europe will become more innovation-friendly with Single Market measures such as the unitary patent, faster standard-setting, modernised EU procurement rules and a European passport for venture capital funds. The communication also notes progress on EU financial instruments for SMEs through Horizon 2020 and the programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, COSME. The communication states that the global position of Europe is still relatively strong. The EU is one of the world’s best performers when it comes to producing high quality science and innovative products. Since 2008, the EU has improved its innovation performance and it closed almost half of the innovation gap with the US and Japan. The EU is also keeping its strong innovation lead over Brazil, India, Russia and China, although the last is catching up. In addition, South Korea has almost tripled its innovation lead over the EU since 2008 and joined the US as an innovation leader. Also, while public research and development spending in the EU grew throughout the crisis as governments strived to keep up their research and development investments and incentivise businesses to do likewise, recent data point to a potential reversal of this trend. In 2011, for the first time since the beginning of the crisis, the total public research and development budget decreased slightly. As growth disparities between some European regions are increasing, there is an even stronger need to implement the innovation union swiftly, particularly in the areas crucial to innovation, such as higher education, innovation-based entrepreneurship and demand-side measures. A new indicator of innovation output has been developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and monitor the EU's performance against its main trading partners. The new indicator classifies Ireland in the highest category of top performers. Ireland's performance under the new Indicator of Innovation output is highly significant as it measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This is a very positive indication of improvement in Ireland's competitiveness in key areas of the economy. The top performers in the EU owe their ranking to doing well on several or all of the following factors: an economy with a high share of knowledge-intensive sectors, fast-growing innovative firms, high levels of patenting, and competitive exports. The novelty of the new indicator is that it focuses on innovation output. Sweden, Germany,
11514	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	49	 That is fantastic news about Kinsale Community College. It is a testament to the school and its ethos. It is also a testament to what I will not call a new-found interest in STEM but a growing interest in engaging with the STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics. There is a fearlessness among students now at post-primary level about taking on these projects. One can see it at the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition and in other science-related outreach programmes that are taking place with industry. There is a confidence among students to embrace new technologies. They are digital natives, as it were. However, there are still challenges, such as ensuring that an increasing number of students will engage with the hard sciences such as physics and chemistry. We must try to ensure there will be a throughput so these people will have the necessary skill set to slot into the jobs we have not yet even imagined, as Deputy Calleary described them. I join in the congratulations. We have increased the target for engagement by SMEs from 15% to 20%. The Horizon 2020 target tallies with the current policy whereby the foreign direct investment sector and SME section in Ireland very much have an opportunity to now engage with the research infrastructure. Where a challenge is presented by an SME, it can bring that challenge to a research entity. There are means and mechanisms for funding, either through innovation vouchers or through the various research entities to bring the product to market. The recent announcement of the €300 million was - but I will not call it a paradigm shift - a collaboration that involved over 150 industry partners bringing a €100 million in cash or in-kind contributions that was matched with a €200 million State investment to create seven new SFI research centres. The purpose is to drive innovation and allows one to turn good ideas into jobs in the first instance. Also, one can ensure that we will have a throughput, focus on and smartly specialise, where we will invest for the next five to ten year horizon. The societal challenges contained in Horizon 2020 map onto our own priority research areas. For instance, we have identified 14 key areas that we will fund. Then industry will join with academia to create the new research entities. We have already announced quite a number of them and some of them are under way. Just last week we announced the enfant centre. It is an amalgamation of between seven to ten industry partners and Cork University Maternity Hospital and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland. Some of its work will be the development of perinatal research. There is also an expectation now that within the research infrastructure, we must deliver jobs, deliver for the economy and deliver new innovations for society. A clear challenge has been set for the research community but it maps onto the same challenges inherent in Horizon 2020. A specific SME target has been set for research but the challenge is how to get the SMEs engaged. Let us say one has a traditional SME who has a traditional relationship with a county enterprise board, for example, or soon to be local enterprise office. How do we get them to start engaging with academia in a way to get leverage from research innovation on the products? How do we convey the idea that the SME must get the product to market and create jobs? We have sent strong signals to them through the agencies such as Enterprise Ireland which is mapped on to the research infrastructure. We have also conveyed the message through the various research entities that the Government expects to have a more proactive engagement with SMEs on the matter. I hope that I have answered the question.
11515	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	51	 Its not easy to answer and I can only focus on what Ireland is doing. Ireland has taken a long term view. We are working proactively on the stem side and education. The latter is the key in South Korea and its population seems to be natural innovators. At present we are doing a lot of work on, for instance, funding out-of-field mathematics teachers. We are spending a considerable amount of taxpayers money in bringing the out-of-field maths teachers and upskilling them with a professional diploma in order to allow them to teach the curriculum and so on. We are now talking about funding continual professional development at primary school level in order to equip teachers to teach mathematics. Sometimes a deficit exists. Sometimes there is a competition in primary schools between other subjects and mathematics and science related topics. There are outreach projects such as the Discover Science and Engineering programme, industry engagement and Coder Dojo and whatnot. We must start thinking long term. We must analyse how we train teachers to teach these subjects and find out whether there is more to be done in order to begin challenging other regions like Singapore and South Korea. There is a consciousness around that goal. In the short term, Ireland is not in a position to fund the whole gamut of research. We must be smart, specialise in certain areas and ensure that we do not leave basic research out of the loop. We must ensure that there is blue sky research and find pockets of funding to invest in astrophysics, etc. I am not saying that we are putting all of our eggs into the 14 research priority areas because one must include the humanities, social sciences, digital humanities and so on. We must ensure that the research infrastructure is more rounded. In order for us to compete with regions like Singapore in the long term then the key is to equip the teachers of science and mathematics in a certain way. The output is students who are driven. Naturally those students would then go into post-primary education and then on to courses at tertiary level where there is more a take up of those science related and STEM related subjects.
11516	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	56	 I take the point. We have deliberately set out targets and increased the targets for engagement by the SME sector in Horizon 2020. The subject of today's committee meeting is the upcoming Competitiveness Council. The challenge, as Deputy Áine Collins said, is to engage the SME sector. There are people who come into our offices who have had no formal engagement, who have great ideas and who want a pathway for the idea so that they can monetise it, commercialise it and get it to the market. The local enterprise offices should present an opportunity in that regard. More outreach must be done by academic institutions. There must be greater flexibility by academic institutions where there are technology transfer offices or centres of innovation, such as the Rubicon or NIMBUS centres in Cork. There is an open-door policy in those centres and we must break down the filtration system between the citizen who has the idea and the academic institution. There should be a more flexible approach. I agree with the Deputy in that regard. I strongly argue that it can be done once the local enterprise office is up and running. From a regional perspective, the local enterprise office will naturally map onto the existing structure because of the service level agreement within Enterprise Ireland, which has an engagement with academic institutions. That should present an opportunity to people so that they do not get bogged down and they have the confidence to come in when they have an idea. Tyres can be kicked and innovation vouchers can be applied to the ideas. Someone from the research community can engage with the person. The success of this will be predicated on how many innovation vouchers become companies or tradeable or commercialised licences. We have some way to go in this country. I take the point being made. Deputy Áine Collins referred to the University of Maryland. Ireland is a small country. Globally speaking, we are punching above our weight on the innovation index. There is a tendency for Irish people to be self-congratulatory. However, looking at the objective metrics, we have a large FDI presence, with parent companies and people on-site in Ireland. Invariably, the leaders of teams are Irish people who have come up through the corporate structure. Those Irish people are allowing us to leverage opportunities with academia. It is not every day that industry will come up with €100 million in hard cash or contributions in kind and marry it with an investment from the State. We will never compete with the United States because it can fund through philanthropy and a whole realm of funding mechanisms, including blue-sky research. We must specialise and we must be smart about where we invest. We have collaborated with industry and we have developed a set of areas we can fund, which will deliver for the economy. I take the point made by the Deputy.
11517	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	58	 On that point, every institute of technology in this country has a technology centre, which is based on the same philosophy as the RTOs to which Deputy Collins refers. There are competency centres which are managed through Enterprise Ireland which are very much focused on commercialisation of research and there are also the larger Science Foundation Ireland centres. It might not be any harm for this committee to invite some people from Enterprise Ireland in to map out exactly where the research centres and the competency centres are and to provide an overarching picture for the members. Enterprise Ireland could also give members an overview of the themes and how the research is being funded. On the issue of innovation vouchers, one must remember that we are talking about taxpayers money. Deputy Collins did make the point that probity is necessary from that perspective. I can understand the point made about the bureaucratic nature of the process. Ultimately, we are trying to get to a point where companies which are often family companies or inter-generational companies in areas such as engineering or manufacturing, come into the research system. We are trying to de construct the filtration system that exists between academia and business so that there is a confluence between the two. It works very well in some parts of the country but not so well in other parts. It is about creating an open-door policy whereby a potential entrepreneur can sit down with a researcher and if there is a new widget to be developed, for example, the process can be seamless. We are aiming to reach a point where the facilitation takes place seamlessly. If the idea does not fly, then so be it. If it does, then it can be funded in a flexible way to get it to the next stage. That is the system we are trying to work towards.
11518	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	60	 This was a co-decision procedure so effectively it involved negotiations between over 700 MEPs and, at the time, 27 member states and the Commission. One of the areas on which the Commission and the Council of Ministers, represented by myself, had a very stringent view was on the need for simplification. The process has to be simplified. The manner in which researchers and industry engage with Horizon 2020 has to be such that there is a simplification of the procedure for applications. There was a tendency for the larger research infrastructures throughout Europe to have a major administrative function built into their silos, for want of a better term, such that they had a comparative advantage over others. They were already well equipped to deal with the bureaucracy involved in the funding application process. We are creating a flat structure around that now and that is agreed politically and built into the new Horizon 2020.
11519	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	65	 That point is duly noted. I will relay it to the Minister, Deputy Bruton. As we speak, new innovations are being created by the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster as part of its work with Commodore Mark Mellett and the entire Naval Service, which is funded through the public purse and has its headquarters at Haulbowline, and its engagements with University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology. There is a role for thinking about how the Irish Defence Forces interact with the SME sector. A number of companies are being scaled out of the activities of the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster at Ringaskiddy, in terms of meeting the needs of the navy in areas like fisheries patrols, drones and earth observation through the European Space Agency. The navy interacts with civilian society, and protects civilian society, in all sorts of innovative areas. One can drive new innovations from that activity as well. I am trying to read between the lines of what Senator Cullinane said about the south east without misinterpreting what he said. The telecommunications, software and systems group is extremely well funded not because it is based in Waterford but because it does excellent research. Some people have claimed that there is a regional disparity and that funding goes into the universities but not into the regions. I would contend that one has to fund first and foremost on the basis of the excellence of the science and the research that is being conducted. That is a rule of thumb in research funding. If one were to shift the balance towards the provision of funding in this area on the basis of regional disparities, one would be going down a very narrow cul-de-sac. Senator Cullinane referred specifically to the landscape in the south east. If I am not mistaken, the telecommunications, software and systems group has already leveraged approximately €13 million under the seventh EU framework programme. That is a testament to the people who are there. The fact that they are in Waterford is incidental. Science Foundation Ireland awards worth €7.47 million have been made in the south east. It is a strategic research cluster, as the Senator will know. An infrastructure award of €1.9 million was made in 2012. I was in the area two weeks ago. I maintain a close working relationship with the principal figures in all the research entities because I like to know what is going on. The telecommunications, software and systems group unquestionably stands out as a beacon. I am conscious of the need to ensure the group continues to evolve so that it can create new partnerships and collaborations with industry. I do not want to suggest that it needs to be protected. I think the Deputy answered his own question when he spoke about the group's engagement with SMEs. Our investments in research are predicated on that model of innovation, which is taking place throughout the country. I would like to respond to the point that was made about the public sector by saying that research scientists are invariably public sector workers. Many of the funds we award are used to meet the cost of overheads in terms of human capital.
11520	SeanSherlock	Labour	14902.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2013-09-24 00:00:00	European Competitiveness Council: Discussion	67	 I was going to come to that point in terms of the overall answer. It goes back to the point Deputy Áine Collins was making earlier. Many SMEs that operate in the technology sector are already well versed because they were born out of academic institutions. Radisens Diagnostics in Cork has developed innovations in the area of point-of-care blood testing. This is an example of a company that is gradually scaling up and ramping up to SME level. As it was born within an academic institution, it is predicated on excellent research. It will use the levels that are available through Horizon 2020 to access greater funding. As the OECD has pointed out, it is a big challenge to get more traditional types of SMEs - the Momma and Poppa intergenerational companies in the more traditional sectors - to engage. I acknowledge it is a challenge. I am confident we can do it. I believe the local enterprise offices can serve as a mechanism to enable us to do so. If one examines this from a regional perspective, one will reflect on the role played by the county enterprise boards. There is a service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland. The chances are that Enterprise Ireland is funding many of the companies that were born out of the research landscape. Enterprise Ireland is conscious that it has a direct mandate and a mission to deal with the SME sector and the indigenous sector. I think we will address that dynamic through that process. I am confident about that. Most of the greatest innovations we know about have come from investment in defence. Our constitutional arrangement governs where our own defence infrastructure sits relative to the world and relative to the United Nations. Deputy Áine Collins referred to Israel earlier. The greatest innovations that have come from Israel are predicated on that country's massive investment in its defence sector. The same thing applies to the United States of America. We have a clear mandate that dictates what we can and cannot fund. There is no question about that. We are not funding people to make weapons - we are funding innovation in microelectronics. It may be the case that a piece of innovation can be applied to defence infrastructure as a by-product. I will leave it hanging there.

11529	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	2	 I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the members of the joint committee on the research and development landscape in Ireland. I thank them for inviting me to do so. The importance of investment in science, technology and innovation to Ireland's ongoing and future economic and social development and wellbeing has been well recognised by this and previous Governments. Our focus has been very much on prioritising public investment in research while better exploiting results in order to lead to an acceleration of growth and job creation. Over the past decade we have expanded and consolidated our research and innovation system considerably and investment in research and innovation has grown substantially. This investment has been based on an ambitious strategy of investing in people, infrastructure and associated facilities to build the science base across many areas of scientific research in both the higher education institutions and other public research organisations, notably through the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, as well as Science Foundation Ireland and other research agencies. This investment in scientific research is having many positive impacts, including powering an innovative and enterprising economy, creating high-value jobs, attracting, developing and nurturing business, scientists and talented people and ensuring Ireland is connected and respected internationally. We can draw much encouragement from the fact that Ireland has enhanced its standing in global research by steadily building a very credible research base, particularly over the past decade or so. Our publication rates have doubled, for example, with Ireland's citation rates now surpassing EU and US averages. Ireland is now ranked in the global top 20 in all scientific fields and, specifically, by way of example we are ranked first in molecular genetics, and genomics, second in probiotics, third in immunology, sixth in nanotechnology, eighth in materials science and tenth in computer science. Across the EU we are ranked third, according to the new indication of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This proves we are investing smartly in this area and that our investment is delivering jobs. Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, will continue to drive commercialisation form State-funded research, facilitating the emergence of new products and services that underpin export growth and employment. In 2013, in excess of 30 spin-offs were generated and more than 120 licences, options and assignments were agreed. Enterprise Ireland will fund in the region of 80 research and development projects for client companies that are valued in excess of €100,000, while investment in the multi-annual programme for research in third level institutions will continue to improve Ireland's competitive offering in terms of research capability through the delivery of key physical infrastructural projects, that is, buildings and equipment, and research personnel. I hope that I have touched on the more salient points. The Government recognises that research, development and innovation form a major plank and we are smartly investing in and prioritising key areas. We are leveraging industry involvement, bringing in-kind benefits and cash to the table, in partnership with our research infrastructure in a way that will deliver an economic impact. This is the kernel of our approach.

11531	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	7	 The central aim is to maximise job creation. The investment by successive Governments in research, development and innovation is recognised. Less than 20 years ago, our capacity was much less than it is now and those Governments had the vision to build it. We are now at a juncture. We have a highly evolved infrastructure in which those in the oriented, basic research landscape and those in the applied space co-exist well. In terms of the potential for maximising job creation, we have designed an infrastructure that is supra-institutional. Traditionally, the universities and institutes of technology operated inside their own silos and collaborated on specific programmes that had thematic areas of interest, for example, pharma. We have put together a fund through SFI under which the seven new centres that have been created must collaborate outside of their traditional institutional frameworks. We have identified 14 areas, including big data and data analytics. We have co-principal investigators, co-PIs, from six, if not seven, institutions. The potential for job creation lies in the industrial engagement. I cannot give the Deputy an exact figure of the number of industrial partners in an entity, but the investment of the industry's money in these new infrastructures is being done with a view to delivering an economic impact, by which I mean job creation. The philosophy has been to create the seven new infrastructures with more to come this year, to accrue in-kind benefits - people from industry or cash investment - and to get the scientific community to act above its traditional institutions on specific themes and create a vital economic impact. The Horizon 2020 target investment is attainable. By creating new, large-scale infrastructures that supersede individual institutions and by attracting 156 industry partners and €100 million, one creates a leveraging effect that puts one in a stronger position vis-à-vis the €80 billion available in the Horizon 2020 pot. While UCC or any other institution that the Deputy cares to mention may have been successful under framework No. 7 in its own right, larger infrastructures based on specific themes, strong industrial engagement and targets for small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, engagement in Horizon 2020 strengthens one's leveraging position. Therefore, one's ability to attain the target becomes more realistic. The investment in research, development and innovation is primarily an investment in human capital, for example, excellent scientists. I do not have an exact breakdown of how much has gone towards bricks and mortar, equipment or human capacity. By and large, it is about investment in the very best people in the world in order to create impact.
11532	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	9	 A review of patents is currently under way. The Deputy will be aware of the technology transfer strengthening initiative. A review of patents under that initiative is currently under way. We have created an infrastructure which includes a central technology transfer officer and Enterprise Ireland supported technology transfer officers, TTOs, in the individual institutions, all of whom are tasked with pulling out that intellectual property and creating from it the economic opportunities arising for economic or societal benefit. Let us take, for example, business investments in research and development. During periods of economic downturn, it is less likely that companies will engage in research and development because of the cost element. In other words, during periods of retrenchment companies will engage in a battening down of the hatches. There is a direct correlation between that and the reduction in the number of patents. This is being addressed through the national research prioritisation exercise. Let us imagine we had all of the research funders in one room going through action plans for each of the priority areas. Working with Forfás, we have set out metrics in terms of how the institutions should perform, in particular those funded through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI. I anticipate a behavioural change in this regard from the institutions in the context of what the State expects from them in terms of job creation. The usual measures within academia are the numbers of publications and citations. We are driving new metrics in relation to job, patent and licence numbers, etc. There is a clear expectation among the research community in terms of what Government expects of it. A review of the patents is, as I said, under way through the technology transfer strengthening initiative. The dip in economic activity-----
11533	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	11	 Yes, it is. I apologise if I did not answer that question correctly. The funding is tied down. Commitments have been given. There is potential for further industrial engagement. For instance, in terms of the seven centres across the seven seams that have been created, there is further scope for industry to tack on to that. We have created a type of hub and spoke model. In terms of the current landscape, we are moving into the applied space. There are greater flexibilities being created in terms of how industry maps on to or partners with academia in relation to creating spin-outs and so on. I do not know if we can compare ourselves to Israel per se. Account must be taken of the manner in which Israel does its business through Government investment or external investment, which is quite heavy in research, development and innovation. It is very well financed and resourced. There are also a lot more freedoms inherent within that system for individual researchers to draw down pots of money. They also have flexibilities in terms of how that money is used. We do not have those freedoms because of the economic constraints on us. We are moving to a system which ensures that technology transfer is not carried out in a haphazard manner. I am not suggesting that up to now it has been carried out in that way. However, sometimes technology transfer within individual institutions could be a matter of whether I, as the technology transfer officer, had a positive or negative relationship with an individual principal investigator. We are trying to disrupt that dynamic positively. Bringing in the 156 industry partners means that dynamic cannot but be positively disrupted. This is because the industry is investing its own money in thematic areas such as, for instance, the pharmaceuticals sector, particularly in Ireland in the context of the move from what are called molecules to medicines, which sector is partnering with academia to sustain jobs already in the system while creating new innovations in relation to how medicines are delivered, thus sending the message from Ireland's pharma sector to parent companies that the Irish Government is not only serious about maintaining investment in pharma here, but also in leveraging new opportunities to strengthen those individual entities relative to the mothership. That is part of the philosophy, which I accept does not necessarily answer the Deputy's question. By setting clear metrics we are setting clear expectations. If these expectations are not delivered upon, the State agencies or taxpayer then has to review the operations of each of the centres. There is no ambiguity about that. I hope I have answered the Deputy's question. If not, he may challenge me further.
11534	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	14	 Some 40% of foreign direct investment wins are predicated on relationships with Science Foundation Ireland. By any standard, 40% is a significant amount. More than 40% of IDA new client wins in 2012 have direct links with Science Foundation Ireland funded researchers. That translates into 4,500 jobs, which I contend is not insignificant. If one looks at the metrics - I refer to licence, option or assignment agreements - and at the trajectory from 2006 to 2013, there was a dip between 2011 and 2012 but we are now back up. In 2011, the figure was 118, in 2012, it was 87 and in 2013, although this is only a provisional figure, it was 120. In regard to spin-outs, the indicative figure for 2013 is 34, which is the highest it has been since 2006. There is a dip in regard to invention disclosure and in patents. Licensing is something which one is monetising. It is an income stream. I agree that we want to see more spin-outs coming from the investments in research. We have laid down very clear expectations in regard to the investments the taxpayer is making. If industry makes investments, it must ensure there is a return on its investment. I agree with the tenet of the point but we are taking very concrete steps to engage.
11535	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	19	" I probably will not be able to deal with all of them, but the committee can revert to me. On the question of targets, the Commission allows member states to set their targets in line with conditions. I know there is an aspirational target set for 2020 and ideally we would like to be hitting it, but current conditions do not allow us to do that. Small countries have to be smart and specialise in very specific areas of opportunity. I think that is what we are doing. We have identified 14 core areas, and food is identified as a national priority. Already one of the new SFI centres is very much mapped on to the potential for food. The Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre, APC, is a research company led by Professor Fergus Shanahan and his team of researchers in UCC with investment in the region of €40 million. They are exploring the next wave of opportunity in the area of food, probiotics and functional foods. They are currently mapping the human digestive tract at microbial level with a view to distinguishing between the good and bad bacteria and creating medicinal products that will be vital to sustain humanity. Their work has a global focus. The researchers from Teagasc, the dairy and pharma industries are mapped into the activity. We are focused on the next wave of potential in areas such as food, pharma and medical devices. These are our inherent core strengths and will allow us to compete with industries in other countries, such as New Zealand. We are lagging behind Singapore in terms of the delivery of education, particularly in relation to STEM subjects, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We have programmes such as the ""Smart Futures"" and ""Discover"". There is flexibility in the new junior cycle curriculum to introduce STEM related activities. In my role in the Department of Education and Skills, I have responsibility for the policy of STEM. We have set up a STEM educational review group, comprising academia and industry partners - chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith - and operating at arms length which is doing a complete mapping exercise on all STEM activity throughout the country, whether it is industrial engagement, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA or the State agencies delivering education. If we can collate all of the activity, we can then create an impact through the primary and post-primary schools by inculcating an even greater sense of the potential of education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in terms of the jobs that need to be created downstream. I have a real personal interest in pedagogical research. The primary school teachers have to be given the skill sets and have the tools that allow them to have complete confidence to teach mathematics and science related subjects. Teachers at primary school level have to teach across a myriad of subjects. An idea emanating from the STEM committee is the need to spend more on research to assist teachers so that we can achieve higher scores on the PISA and other international ranking tests and to adopt the methodologies that are inherent in places such as Singapore, Finland and Estonia. That will allow us to create economic opportunities down stream and enable us to compete with other centres. That is the philosophy that is guiding us. The review group will report to me very soon. I will now respond to the questions on the regions. Senator Cullinane mentioned TSSG, Telecommunications Software & System Group. One only has to look at how many successful applications that have come from TSSG, a company formed as part of the Waterford Institute of Technology, in the south east, to see how well they have done on FP7. They have done very well because there are excellent people in TSSG. What must drive research and development is excellence and not regional considerations."
11536	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	23	 I take the point that has been made about baseline funding. The calls from SFI are open to any institution and are based on the ability of the institution to attract the right personnel. I am very familiar with the work that is going on in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and how the IOTs compete with the universities. The recent Irish Photonics Centre is led by the Tyndall National Institute comprising UCC and CIT. The excellent research base in light and photonics in CIT has allowed it become academic partners and win when the call was put out by SFI. The process of creating a technological university is under way. The issue of baseline funding will have to be teased out. The targets for research performing organisations are set out and we have mapped out where SFI, the Health Research Board and Teagasc spend money. We have conducted a research prioritisation exercise and established the priorities. If we are to set out what we call compacts for each institution in terms of performance, we must have a level playing field. A research entity may have expectations but in the case of a dearth of baseline funding, the question of performance has to be considered in the light of circumstances. Let me sound a warning and say, without prejudice, that this is still an evolving process. It must happen in a collaborative way and through a conciliatory process. Some of the issues have still to be teased out. Deputy Áine
11537	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	26	 Yes.
11538	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	28	 We are alive to the challenges that are being voiced. The Department is currently examining all the issues and looking at all of the options in terms of Ireland's participation in the unified patent court. One must look at the implications of each policy option and one must look at cost. There are probably other issues that may apply to individuals or certain representative organisations, which Senator Cullinane was referring to in terms of the lobbying on this issue. One must have due regard for the positions that are being put forward by various entities and their views have to be taken into account.

The officials who are led by Ms Anne Coleman Dunne are very proactive in this area."
11540	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	32	 There is absolutely no deadline in respect of this issue.
11541	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	34	 Yes, absolutely. I will not express a personal view on it.
11542	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	37	 I was waiting for that.
11543	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	39	 Let me respond to Senator Clune first. Industry has always been a partner with academia on outputs from research, be it economic, development or specific industrial or SME needs. The creation of the SFI centres has seen industry put up significant resources in kind and in hard cash contribution so industry is very much taking a punt and becoming active stakeholders in this process. The €100 million is a direct investment by industry - with two thirds coming from the taxpayer and one third from industry. If one looks at the revisions to the research and development tax credit, we have tried to improve the system in a way that allows for an increase in the amount of expenditure on what we call a full volume basis. It used to be based on a base year but now we are increasing the limit from €200,000 to €300,000. We are trying to encourage more SMEs to participate in research and development. We have put in place an increase, from 10% to 15%, in the limit on the amount of qualifying research and development expenditure that can be outsourced to another company. If one examines the OECD average on the balance between public and private investment, we are ahead of the average. If one considers the OECD average as an universally accepted metric, we are doing well. I hope that answers the question.
11544	SeanSherlock	Labour	15035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Research and Development Landscape: Minister of State	41	 We are examining the options and engaging with the stakeholders. An agreement was reached in February 2013. We have a decision to make on Ireland's position with regard to a local or out-of-state court, and that decision will be made in due course. The process of engaging with stakeholders is arguably still ongoing. On CERN, I make the point that the European Space Agency, ESA, is not often heard about in the public domain. If one was to measure the column inches on the ESA versus CERN, CERN would garner many more inches. However, if one considers our membership of ESA, an area for which I have particular policy responsibility, we have carried out an analysis of our investment of €17 million and found it has directly impacted on turnover to the tune of some €250 million for Irish and FDI-related companies because it has allowed those companies to win contracts. For example, Radisens Diagnostics is a company that, through its engagement with the ESA, has won significant funding nationally and is now winning serious funding rounds internationally. The position is similar with Treemetrics, a company that has also won grant aid from the ESA and a company this committee might be more familiar with in terms of the impact it is creating in regard to global forestry solutions. It has been said we can get an associate membership of CERN for €1 million. The reason we are carrying out the review is that we need to kick the tyres on that statement. We are carrying out a review of our membership of all international organisations. However, it is only fair, if we are carrying out a review of our membership, to do so in the best interests of the taxpayer, which has to be the bottom line in all of this. The question in my mind, given there is now a campaign, which we all welcome, is whether it is the case that individual researchers are barred from accessing CERN as a facility by virtue of the fact that Ireland has not paid its €1 million associate membership. I have not seen any evidence to suggest they are barred. As I understand it, although I stand to be corrected, individual academic institutions can pay a particular fee, whatever that is, or they might have an arrangement with an external university which will allow Irish researchers access to the facility of CERN. We are being very honest about our approach on this and we have an open mind on it. Before making the decision to invest €17 million in the ESA, we undertook an economic analysis. It is only fair that we undertake an economic analysis and, potentially, a societal analysis of the impact of our membership of CERN. To be fair, while I do not want to be facetious, I have heard it said that CERN has been great for humanity and it has brought us the Internet. However, the Internet was coming anyway, and it is not certain whether we would have had an influence on that, or perhaps there were Irish researchers already there who had an influence. If we spend €1 million on associate membership or €12 million on full membership, will it have a quantitative impact on our interaction with CERN? That is the question that has to be asked. I believe we should have the review. I take absolute cognisance of the bona fides of those who are campaigning on this issue. They are excellent researchers who are part of international consortia which have access to CERN. However, the question has to be asked what is the benefit in real terms and what kind of contracts will Ireland get from it. I would like to look at countries of a comparable size to Ireland and see what benefits they have derived from their membership of CERN in terms of various contracts.

11575	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	 With regard to the indigenous base, there are many centres of excellence within the higher education institutes.  UCC, for example, is doing considerable work through Food for Health Ireland, an initiative that involves collaboration between the dairy industry and Teagasc in Moorepark in Fermoy, for instance.  The objective is to build on extracting value from milk.  Much research is being done in this regard.  There is collaboration between Teagasc, UCC, UCD and UL to determine how to build functional foods and add nutritional value to foods.  This work is taking place in the indigenous base.  NUIG has the Competence Centre for Biorefining and Bioenergy, which is researching second-generation bio-fuels. The key components are the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions, PRTLI, and Science Foundation Ireland, which provides funding.  There is very strong engagement between these bodies and industry.  In real economic terms, investment in research allows this country to compete with other centres of excellence, including global ones such as Singapore, and become a world leader.  It is not often publicised that research and collaboration between industry and the institutes allow us to support exports from our economy valued at approximately €73 billion. Since 2005, foreign direct investment in research, development and innovation increased from approximately 10% to approximately 50%.  There is a highly evolved realisation globally that the companies operating in Ireland through collaboration realise they are able to mine much more value out of the arrangement, and that this is adding to our export base.  However, we must continue to invest because, if investment slips, we could signal to the rest of the world that Ireland is taking its foot off the pedal in terms of investment in very high-level research.  There is a logical component that ensures we can support between 72,000 and 78,000 jobs.  We need to continue on that trajectory.  In other words, a large component of FDI is predicated on ensuring that basic and applied research is there and that we have the requisite competent centres.  We have 28 competent centres of excellence in various scientific fields.  We have the Irish Centre for Manufacturing Research and the Tyndall Centre in UCC, which is a competent centre for micro-electronics.  In addition, there is a competence centre at NUI Maynooth for IT and innovation, which is well supported by companies such as Intel Labs.  There is a strong collaboration in evidence there and, in that sense, we are continuing to push out the boundaries. I profess to having been ignorant of this field when I was in opposition.  Now that I am in government, once one delves into this, one realises that it is undersold as a concept.  The deep collaboration between research and industry is a good news story because of the number of jobs it supports and the exports it generates.  We would not generate so many exports, with a net value of €73 billion, if we did not have these competence centres and the world-class researchers we are able to attract to this country.  I hope that answers the question.
11576	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	14	 I want to address one aspect of Senator Kathryn Reilly's question on commercialisation.  Each institute or university competence centre has a technology transfer office which seeks to facilitate commercialisation of research.  Coupled with that, the State is seeking to prioritise those areas of research for which we can create the necessary jobs, thus focusing on the required research areas.  That prioritisation exercise is currently ongoing.
11577	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	 Enterprise Ireland has a presence in all the BRIC countries and the technological component of that would be as integral as any another sector within the economy. Very often, intellectual property, which is valuable and might form part of a larger innovation, is created and the key for us is how to commercialise that research and add value to those who created it.  Sometimes that gives rise to the creation of a spin out company.  A total of 31 such companies were created through the higher education institutes in 2010 but some of the IP created adds value to the Intels or HPs of the world, which have a presence in the country and which are collaborating with the researchers through their involvement in the higher education institutes.  It is a multifaceted approach.  Our challenges are to get more spin outs from Irish universities and institutes of technology and to create the right framework to ensure any research or intellectual property created will add value to Ireland Incorporated.  Technology transfer offices have a key role in this.  Most importantly, the very fact that these blue-chip companies interface with Irish universities and institutes of technology through research collaboration to create intellectual property ensures we can continue to retain that investment in the country.  We can also grow it because these companies return to their parent companies with the good news story of the research component, as the intellectual property adds value to the parent company's stock or portfolio.  We will maintain this route and trajectory but we must also meet the challenge of trying to get more indigenous spin-outs.  The research prioritisation exercise and the work of Jim O'Hara on the innovation task force is part of this and it continues apace.
11578	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	32	 I am not sure one can one put a stricture that intellectual property remain in the country where it has been created by a researcher in a centre of excellence in collaboration with an international company operating in Ireland.  The market is involved in this in terms of how intellectual property is sold.  We try to retain it here in a way that ensures spin-out companies can be created but it does not always happen this way.  The only way a small open economy dependent on foreign direct investment can ensure that investment is to sell technology, innovation or intellectual property because it realises a commercial value for the company in Ireland and retains jobs in Ireland.  I hope this explains it.
11579	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 Regarding Deputy Lyons's point, having a presence in the Department of Education and Skills allows one an overview.  Consider the teaching of mathematics, in which leaving certificate pupils who are well capable of doing higher level maths are instead choosing to do lower level.  It is a calculated decision on points and the allocation of time and resources.  We must move away from that scenario and Project Maths is moving in the right direction.  The Government is seeking to give political impetus to greater involvement by industry stakeholders in shaping policy so that people might be encouraged towards industry and provided with the necessary preparation and skills.  This will take time and I would like this committee or a sub-committee thereof to have a central role in that regard.  If we have experts within, we should find them a role to try to work out the nuts and bolts. From a basic pedagogical point of view, the idea of a steady pipeline and a more rounded graduate means more applied learning and problem solving as opposed to by rote learning.  The latter seems to have evolved to such a point that young people who are going into universities or institutes of technology still structure their learning in this way.  The applied learning skill set needs to be buttressed so that, when companies employ graduates, this will be one way to ensure applied learning has been well built in psychologically.

11589	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	14	 I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.  I am very pleased to be here to discuss my role as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  I am accompanied by Mr. Michael Davitt, assistant principal officer, Mr. Martin Shanagher, assistant secretary, Ms Anne Forde, principal officer, and Ms Helen Nugent,  Ms Gráinne O'Carroll, Ms Patricia Timmins and Ms Anne O'Mahony. Members of this committee will be aware that the Government has set job creation and retention as one of its key priorities in the programme for Government.  In this context, the concept of supporting enterprise and promoting business innovation goes to the heart of what we are doing as a Government.  We will seek, and we will succeed, in our efforts to provide a better future for our young people, for our society and for Irish business by creating a climate in which entrepreneurs can do business, business can flourish and trade can grow.  Our objective in Government is clear. We are encouraging the renewal of a sustainable economy by putting in place supportive enterprise policies and investments aligned to deliver a return of sustainable jobs.  A key element of these policies is the research and innovation initiative.  It is a central priority at the core of my Department's efforts and that of the enterprise State agencies under the auspices of my Department. Our exports are performing well and leading recovery.  In June 2011, exports were up 5.6% to €8.343 billion on June 2010.  The €4 billion trade surplus in June was the highest ever.  This feeds through to the domestic economy as exporting companies grow and increase their trade with suppliers.  Investment in science, technology and innovation is directly linked to growth in sales and exports.  From 2000 to 2009, exports from El and IDA firms that were research and development performers grew from €44 billion to €87 billion while exports from non-performers fell from €48 billion to €39 billion.  Research and development and innovation has evolved to become a key driver of business success. I would like to outline the areas of focus within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  They are supporting the agenda for research, development and innovation and ensuring it is a strong driver of growth; prioritising public investment in research, development and innovation so we obtain the greatest possible return on our investment in terms of jobs, new intellectual property and technologies; winning more FDI investment and getting enhanced technologies and ideas rapidly from research to companies that will commercialise them; and ensuring that our education system is lining up the skills and expertise needed for the future.  Our emerging workforce will need skills in science, technology, engineering and maths and these skills must be fostered from the early days of school life. I strongly welcome the fact that our cost base is improving to enhance our competitiveness but cost reduction is only part of the answer.  If we are to compete and be successful in the challenging and competitive trade environment in which we operate, Ireland must become both a high productivity and high innovation economy.  We must have top-class research and innovation and embed it in our enterprise because this is a sure-fire way for Irish companies to acquire a competitive advantage in national and international trade. As a country, we have trebled the level of investment in research and development.  We strongly support enterprises to do more research and development.  We have invested in human capital, in top quality researchers and third and fourth level education.  We have now got excellent physical research infrastructure in place and the structures to commercialise research.  This public investment has accelerated the creation and application of new knowledge and technologies, has contributed significantly to the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and has played a large part in attracting increases in foreign direct investment. The three enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, are working together in a coherent and complementary way under the direction of my Department to support the development of an innovative and vibrant enterprise sector.  I will briefly touch on the role being played by a number of agencies in implementing and underpinning Government policies in this area. Through Enterprise Ireland we are working to enhance the capacity of indigenous enterprise to develop new products and services, we are building research development and innovation capacity within companies to create competitive advantage, we are providing support to commercialise research ideas and we are developing and fostering links with the third-level research base. Enterprise Ireland's goal is to grow the capacity of Irish companies so that both domestic activity and exports can expand, create wealth and increase jobs.  Enterprise Ireland client companies exported €14 billion in 2010, which was a 10% increase on 2009.  New export sales totalled a record €1,945 million, with growth in all major sectors.  During 2010, El approved funding to 1,070 companies, supported 80 new innovative start-up enterprises, and financial support was approved for significant research and development projects, that is a grant in excess of €100,000, for 860 client companies.  In 2010, 8,193 new jobs were created in El supported companies, bringing the total number employed in these companies to 137,000. With the goal of getting existing companies involved in research and innovation and of developing new innovative companies, a number of strategic programmes are offered by Enterprise Ireland.  The high potential start-up scheme provides supports and funds for start-up companies and entrepreneurs through investment in equity.  The target is to increase the number of new companies created to 100 per annum by 2013.  The initiative to transform research and development activity in enterprise fosters and supports the growth of research and development capabilities needed by an enterprise to grow, develop and trade.  Through industry collaboration programmes, companies are linked with third level researchers and get them working together for the benefit of industry.  The commercialisation of a research programme provides funds to bring an already developed research idea to a point where it can be transferred to the market place. Through the IDA we are continuing to attract high quality foreign direct investment projects to Ireland and embed existing FDI companies in the Irish economy.  Half the FDI wins are now research and innovation projects; in 2010 there were 37 investments, worth around €500 million.  The IDA is focused on winning new investments, in particular in sectors such as life sciences, including pharma, biopharma and medical devices, ICT and financial services. Foreign direct investment has been hugely important for the Irish economy and job creation over the last 30 years.  The IDA supported FDI sector alone accounts for around 240,000 jobs in the economy or 13% of the labour force.  Research, development and innovation plays its strategic role as part of Ireland's FDI landscape embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment.  In overall terms, IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies directly accounted for the employment of approximately 300,000 people in the Irish economy.  These companies also supported an estimated additional 300,000 indirect jobs. Through Science Foundation Ireland we are continuing to foster top-class research and develop and make Ireland into an attractive option for researchers and firms seeking to conduct world-class scientific research.  In ten years, Ireland has moved from Third World status into the world's top 20 countries based on quality of research output.  Science Foundation Ireland activities are undertaken because the long-term competitiveness of enterprise can only be successfully built upon a base of top-class national research. Much of the focus of SFI is directed to strengthen connections between researchers and industry.  This is achieved through the centres for science, engineering and technology - CSETs - and strategic research clusters - SRCs.  SFI currently supports nine CSETs and 19 SRCs and currently supports over 2,500 research positions directly.  CSETs and SRCs help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies, and grow partnerships with industry that will make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy. A substantial impact of the SFI investment is in attracting new foreign direct investment, previously beyond Ireland's reach.  Importantly, this also underpins existing jobs.  SFI researchers now interact with 534 companies, the majority of whom are IDA and Enterprise Ireland clients based in Ireland. Although not within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I want to speak briefly about the role of county and city enterprise boards in supporting small enterprises.  A network of 35 local offices are the primary initial contact point for business start-ups in Ireland.  The micro-enterprise support programme assists business start-ups at local level. Exchequer funding of €27 million was provided for the CEB network at the start of 2011 and an extra €3.1 million was recently provided to fund further job creation projects, a necessary investment in the current economic situation.  A number of other areas of activity such as the programme for research in third level institutions and the work to enhance maths and science literacy have an important bearing on the future for the enterprise sector, for which I have responsibility. PRTLI is an enabling investment, putting in place the bedrock of national research capacity in the higher education sector.  This includes top-class research infrastructure, namely, buildings, laboratories and cutting edge equipment, including national shared facilities and structured PhD programmes.  It is about providing appropriate top-class facilities for Ireland's research community while also providing training and education opportunities for our next generation of scientists.  It will significantly contribute to the Government's goal of developing the capacity and capability of the higher education institutions to carry out high quality research across various fields of strategic national importance.  The €359 million investment under PRTLI will stimulate our economy and is an investment in the future. On science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, I am working in a cross-departmental role with the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to enhance science and maths literacy and to up-skill our emerging workforce for the skills needs of the future.  We must ensure that graduates in science, technology, engineering and maths have the relevant skills that are applicable in the current employment market.  While the latest OECD data shows that, on average, the number of science graduates in Ireland is higher than other countries, there is need for continued focus.  A targeted approach is being taken to bridge the short-term skills gap in ICT graduates identified by the expert group on future skills needs.  We will also address the longer-term pipeline issues.  The emerging action plan on ICT will be complemented by initiatives to improve the mathematical proficiency of new entrants to higher education, as well as by measures to ensure that the higher education sector responds to the changing skills needs of industry.  The promotion of science awareness and careers in science is particularly important if there is to be a steady pipeline of young people equipped to sustain a true knowledge economy. The Discover Science and Engineering, DSE, programme, an initiative of my Department and Forfás, has undertaken two key initiatives as part of the ongoing campaign to encourage young people to develop an interest in maths and in careers where a high level of competence in maths is required.  A major reform in the teaching of maths at primary and post-primary school, Project Maths, is also under way, involving a major curriculum revision, a different approach in the examinations papers and a nationwide programme of education for existing mathematics teachers.  From summer 2012, bonus points will be awarded to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in leaving certificate maths in respect of entry to higher education institutes.  In addition, the programme for Government contains commitments to reform maths and science teaching at second level, to make science a compulsory junior certificate subject by 2014 and to prioritise professional development for maths and science teachers. The Government is committed to ensuring that we get the maximum return on public investment in science, technology and innovation.  My Department, together with Forfás, is leading a research prioritisationinitiative to identify areas of opportunity with the greatest potential to deliver economic return, with a view to the Government prioritising the public investment in science, technology and innovation to support the real opportunities there.  This is chaired by Dr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.  Another planned change is the extension of the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, to enable it to bring the research it funds closer to market.  Work is also well under way on the development of an intellectual property protocol, the objective of which is to establish clear, straightforward ground rules around ownership of and access to all State supported IP, with a view to supporting commercial exploitation of the results of publicly funded research.  Clarity and certainty with regard to IP can be another plus in choosing Ireland as a place to do business. I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation this morning.  I assure the committee that the Government is taking a strategic approach to the science, technology and innovation field.  I welcome all opportunities to engage with this committee or individuals of it on any aspect of this field.  I would argue that it is largely an apolitical space and, as such, the views of all Senators and Deputies will be vital.  The more we engage with committees and individual Members, the more proficient we will be in terms of the roll-out of policies in this area.  The Government is open to engage with Members on identified needs in this regard.  I thank the committee for its time.
11590	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	 Science Foundation Ireland funds basic research.  We need to move it into a more applied space.  The key aim is to increase market outputs.  The research prioritisation exercise is focused on ensuring that research can move into a commercialisation space and, therefore, create necessary spin-outs and embed further the collaboration between industry and academia.  In extending the remit of SFI into a more applied space we can facilitate that process.  That is key.  The legislation in that regard is currently being drawn up.  It is vital that we acknowledge the collaboration between SFI and industry.  Approximately 3,000 researchers are funded and there are 530 plus collaborations with industry or individual companies.  We are talking about supporting 90,000 plus jobs in this field. We need to ensure Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is in a space in which it is closer to industry but maintaining its core principle of having the best researchers in the field.  That is where the funding of basic research comes into play. The rate of job losses is being stemmed.  While no spin can be put on the fact that in 2009 there were 18,000 net jobs lost compared to only 5,300 net new jobs, the rate of losses is being stemmed now, which is vital in Enterprise Ireland's view.  In 2010, there were 80 new HPSU, high potential start-up, companies.  The HPSUs have funded about €18.7 million in equity grants and €21 million in follow-up investment.  In the first six months of 2011, some 41 HPSU companies were supported which will provide more than 750 jobs in the next three years. Patent applications in 2005 came to 83 while in 2010 they came to 101.  In 2008 and 2009 they came to 2002 and 144 respectively.  Licensing arrangements between 2005 and 2010 went from 12 to 93.  More licensing of innovations is good for industry and academia.  I accept the peak in 2008 has reduced but it has gone up on average since 2005. SFI capital grants increased from €150 million in 2010 to €160.8 million in 2011.
11591	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	 The changes that will take place in the county enterprise board structure will bring them more in line with the one-stop shop model.  This will also address some of the concerns regarding enterprise support at local level.  We all agree there needs to be a more streamlined approach.  I absolutely agree with the point made on fragmentation. With regard to job creation in science, technology and innovation I would argue there is highly evolved interaction between academia and industry.  The number of collaborations is very high.  It is highly evolved in the sense that Enterprise Ireland is very close to the ground and very knowledgeable on what companies' needs are with regard to science, technology and innovation because they interface with them on a daily basis.  I think I can stand over this because I have responsibility for science, technology and innovation. Extending the remit of SFI to allow it into the applied space would leverage more in terms of economic outputs.  However, a challenge still exists.  We could do more work with the technology transfer offices in each institution to try to leverage more.  The research prioritisation exercise will create thematic approaches on where research funding will go, so EI, SFI and the IDA will be locked into a space with the Government to allow as much as possible to be extracted.  It would allow the potential to be exploited commercially to create more jobs in the field. It is not a case of resting on our laurels.  Successive Governments have realised the potential of science, technology and innovation and more and more related foreign direct investment jobs are embedded in Ireland by virtue of the research and development component.  We cannot overlook this either. I take the point made by Deputy Tóibín on streamlining.  He asked for figures on the budget allocation for county enterprise boards, CEBs.  Exchequer funding for the CEB network at the beginning of 2011 was €27.2 million of which €15 million was made available for capital expenditure.  In the past two weeks, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, announced funding of €3.1 million for the CEBs for further job creation projects in the remaining months of 2011.  I have not seen the metrics on how this has been spent so far or what is the return on the investment in terms of job creation.  It has yet to be assessed as far as I am aware. One must be careful with regard to high potential start-ups.  I imagine the Deputy has a figure in mind, and he mentioned 100 in Dublin alone.  If one seeks to achieve this, one cannot be afraid of failure.  By this I mean in the US, which has a highly-evolved venture capital structure, there are fewer hang-ups about failure.  However, if the State will fund an exponentially larger number of high potential start-ups using taxpayers' money then the State cannot be afraid of these companies failing.  There is a good chance a certain proportion of high potential start-ups will fail. The balance we have struck is correct.  I will hear the Deputy's views on it and I have an open mind.  If we try to hit these targets we will be doing fairly well.  We must be mindful that we are funding companies in the sector using taxpayers' money and we must be careful about how we expend these resources.  There must be checks and balances to ensure the risk is mitigated. Much work is being done with regard to InterTradeIreland and the North-South link.  The trading and investing in a smart economy strategy was launched in September and it uses all of our diplomatic resources to maximise support for Irish businesses in key markets.  The focus is on promoting team Ireland.  The Deputy is aware of the good work done by the Government throughout the island with regard to InterTradeIreland.  I do not have statistics with me on this work but I can come back to the Deputy with the information.
11592	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	 I take the point.  Another point to make on funding in the science, technology and innovation framework is that there is much collaboration on the framework 7 funding model between North and South.  Enterprise Ireland's innovation vouchers also work on a North-South basis.  I am happy to speak to the Deputy on the point he has made.
11593	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	 I am not entirely sure I accept Enterprise Ireland is demand-led.  Perhaps more could be done with regard to SMEs but the level of engagement between Enterprise Ireland and the multinational sector which supports more than 100,000 jobs is a highly-evolved model and constantly pushes out.  If members have not already done so I encourage them to visit any of the Enterprise Ireland partially-funded centres throughout the State which are involved in frontier research with industry.  They are supported by the State agencies in a very highly-evolved model.  It puts us in the top 20 in some of the metrics in specific areas of research.
11594	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	28	 The point can be fleshed out when Enterprise Ireland comes before the committee.  My experience as a Minister of State with regard to working with Enterprise Ireland on science, technology and innovation is that there is no complacency.  It constantly listens to industry on its needs.  If one visits institutes such as the Tyndall Institute in Cork; the Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices, CRANN; Athlone Institute of Technology; or Institute of Technology, Sligo one will see a highly-evolved model of engagement on the needs of industry by the State agencies.  We should not underestimate this.  Perhaps an opportunity will be provided to flesh it out in greater detail.
11595	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	 I am not aware of international comparators in this area.  The measurement is the number of jobs supported and the top tens and top 20s we hit in specific fields of research.  Eight of the top ten pharmaceutical companies are based in Ireland.
11596	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	 I do not have an answer but I will come back to the Deputy.
11597	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	37	 To reply to Deputy Conaghan's question, the city of science programme will be a vital showcase for Ireland.  It will happen in July 2012 and we are expecting between 5,000 and 7,000 delegates.  The Government will provide €2.9 million towards the cost of the programme which will cost approximately €6 million.  They key focus will be on showcasing Ireland's talents in this field to boost our standing internationally.  The multiplier effect of up to 7,000 delegates returning to their respective countries will be great.  Our key goal is to promote the country in this global setting.  The programme will have the knock-on effect of promoting careers in science and greater engagement by students and parents because of the publicity that will be generated.  We are, therefore, taking the event seriously.  In the recent past people have made a joke about Ireland trying to restore its international reputation, but the Government takes this agenda seriously, of which this programme is part.  If we take the opportunity to showcase the best and the brightest, we will get a return on our investment in terms of reputational enhancement.  That is one part of the process. With regard to schools, Project Maths is a vital component at second level.  The ship has sailed and the programme will be rolled out in every school.  We believe strongly that because of how it is taught, it will have a positive effect downstream on examination results.  The provision of bonus points next year should result in a marked change in the results obtained.  The aim is to ensure students think more laterally about the everyday use of maths.  We want to deconstruct a language where parents say they were never any good at maths and this is reinforced in their children.  If we can do this, there will be a positive effect downstream, but we have to be mindful of the need to ensure that while education is a priority, there is a balance between this and the graduates we produce.  The intention should not only be to churn out engineers in order that they can interface with companies but also to get students to think laterally in solving problems, which is the key component. Within the innovation and maths space we have young social innovators.  I attended an event in my home town of Mallow which was attended by more than 2,000 parents and primary schoolchildren who interacted with providers in the science and maths space.  A great deal of work is being done by the national centre of excellence in the University of Limerick, Calmast and the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork.  The aim of these initiatives is to make STEM subjects more attractive to students at a younger age.  We are having success in this regard, but the challenge will be to roll out these projects in primary schools. The fundamental question is whether it is possible to teach entrepreneurship.  Is it something that is innate or can it be learned?  That is a matter on which I would defer to Senator Quinn.  There are now more flexible models in schools, particularly in transition year.  The YSI model is very good and we have seen a major proliferation of companies being set up at schools level.  It seems to be more embedded, but if we need to do more I would like to hear the Senator's views on that.  Where do we go and are we on the right track?  I believe we are with Project Maths.  We need to do more in the junior cycle, but the Department is doing considerable work in that and the primary sector is the key.  We will have continuing professional development of teachers, especially for teachers who are out of field.  I may have used the term unqualified teachers before - I openly admit that was the wrong choice of phrasing.  We need to look at out-of-field teachers who are teaching maths and invest money - which will happen - in upskilling those teachers and providing CPD.  It all depends on the engagement of the teachers and schools, and I hope they will engage.
11598	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	 We also have the excellent discover science and engineering programme run by Forfás, which does much outreach with individual schools.  Peter Brabazon there does great work in interacting with schools. I have only just begun to engage with the issue of fear of failure.  It is worn like a badge of honour by Americans engaging with VCs.  It is almost as if one must fail in order to ultimately succeed.  We should inculcate that culture that one is allowed to fail once and the State agencies will support such a person who wants to come back into the system again.
11599	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 The Department set up an ICT steering group in 2010.  That was a stakeholder forum to address the issues Deputy Lyons and Senator Clune raised.  We need to start with the dotcom bubble that burst, which led to a decrease in the points requirements for science and ICT-related courses.  As demand for those courses has now increased, some of that demand will be fulfilled, albeit within the next three to four years.  The question is what we should do in the intervening period to fill the 2,500 vacancies Deputy Lyons mentioned.  The Department will shortly roll out a facility to facilitate bridging of the skills gap for industry.  That will facilitate engineers or others who want to upskill and transfer into the industry. These issues are being tackled, but the fundamental issue is one of getting kids to engage in programming languages.  They know how to play games and are early adopters of technology.  I have witnessed this with children as young as two years of age.  How do we get them into a space in which they begin to engage in creating games and the knowledge base to see what occurs behind the screen?  This is where we want to go.  Work is being done in this regard, but industry, including Internet service providers, has a greater role to play.  A further engagement with the Irish Internet Association may be the way to go. An ICT action plan is in place.  Its purpose is to engage with the questions being posed by Deputy Lyons and Senator Clune.
11600	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	44	" We can make it available.  DSE and others are trying to engage kids in these platforms, but the work is disparate.  We have heard from individuals working with VECs on rolling out specific programmes in, for example, east County Galway, where someone visited schools to teach languages.  How can this be rolled out across the State, given the fact that not every kid will be able to engage? The key point is we are grappling with the issue.  One must strike a balance between the core educational subjects and other subjects.  I do not want to say ""market-focused"", but if we want to create the best graduates in the world, that is the space we must enter.  It must start when kids are young.  The action plan's bridging courses will tackle personnel shortages in those sectors in the short term. I have just been informed by my officials.  They are excellent and we sometimes underestimate them.  By all accounts, the shortage within the ICT sector is a global phenomenon.  We are conscious of this fact and are trying to bridge the gap. We need to maintain the engagement with technology transfer offices, TTOs.  The structure that is in place is vital.  Their current round of funding is up for renewal and a conversation is under way within the Department as to how the funding process will evolve.  I have met TTOs from individual institutions and one cannot but be impressed by their work.  We need to discuss with them the question of extracting more, but their work is inherently good and they have a strong link with industry. Discussions are under way on how to extract further IPs and obtain further licensing arrangements, whether we need to be more pragmatic in our approach and whether a conversation on getting more of a return on this publicly funded research is necessary.  The TTOs have a forward-looking viewpoint and I will meet them shortly."
11601	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	46	 Yes.  One must be conscious of the need for TTOs.  If this component is axed, there will be a major gap.
11602	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	48	 It is under review.
11603	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	50	 Pre-service training will be extended.  There will be a two-year higher diploma and a B.Ed of four years.  This is one way of tackling the issue.  I had a good meeting with the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, last week.  There seems to be a strong willingness to engage on each of the platforms in question. According to the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MTSL, which rolls out many continuous professional development, CPD, programmes, there is a strong demand among teachers for CPD in out-of-field subjects.  This is encouraging.  My sense of the situation is that the teaching community wants to upskill and train.
11604	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 Deputy McFadden referred to incubator units.  Last Friday, I visited Athlone Institute of Technology, a shining light regionally in how these units should be run.  The Midlands Innovation and Research Centre, MIRC, in the institute is doing fabulous work. I do not know the statistics on age, but the number of mature students in higher level institutions is increasing year on year.  This is one way of tackling the skills shortage and providing opportunities for people within the age bracket in question.  Through the VEC structures, colleges of further education are doing a great deal of work.  Their age coterie is higher than average.  This is one platform.  The labour market activation programmes deal specifically with people aged over 50 years.  JobBridge provides opportunities for people to obtain skills relevant to sectors other than those in which they worked heretofore.  In fairness to the Department of Social Protection, there is a great deal being done to ensure we get people within that age bracket back into the workforce. Deputy McFadden is correct that there are people with huge life and work experience who do not necessarily have a qualification.  The Government is actively trying to bring that breadth of experience back into structure.
11605	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	55	 I take on board the Deputy's point.  Springboard is a targeted programme.  On mentoring, I have spoken at length on this issue with Deputy Collins and have taken on board her point about soft skills.  People will say that it is not always money they are looking for when interacting with the State agencies.  Very often, what they need is mentoring.  Enterprise Ireland operates a mentoring programme.  If members have views on that programme-----
11606	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	 It is often perceived that those who provide mentoring are ex-consultants or ex-bank managers.  That is not a criticism of bank managers.  However, we may perhaps need a wider array of advisers in terms of mentoring. I am happy to take part in deeper engagement with the committee in respect of issues which individual members believe the Government needs to do more.
11607	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	60	 We will also work to that end.  On work permits, I have been told turnaround through the IDA is usually 15-days for people with key skills.  I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality is also working on ensuring a quick turnaround in respect of visa applications.
11608	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	62	 If there are specific examples, I would like to hear them.
11609	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	65	 Perhaps we should take a closer look at that issue.
11610	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	 I thank Deputy Fleming for his comments and questions.  I agree with him in respect of the priorities he has outlined.  I hope I have addressed those in the course of the debate.  Strategic alliances between the State agencies is highly evolved in the field for which I am responsible.  There is an intimate knowledge between the State agencies and industry, including the personalities involved in individual companies.  The relationships there are close.  This issue is highly embedded therein. I responded earlier to questions on education.
11611	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	73	 I am grateful for the opportunity to be here.  I am happy to interact with any cross-party sub-committee on the science, technology and innovation issue, even on an informal basis.
11612	SeanSherlock	Labour	14196.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	77	 I see no problem with that proposal.  I will take the Deputy's views directly to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.

11637	SeanSherlock	Labour	13629.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 I apologise for missing the submissions as I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The issue is one of equity.  It also speaks to the fact of how women are treated vis-à-vis the pensions system as a whole in this country.  The issue is very simple in that if the terms of a scheme are agreed, people buy into the scheme in good faith and the bona fides of the scheme are clearly established, as a matter of equity and fairness it is necessary that the obligations of the scheme are met.  These women signed up to the scheme in good faith and the State should honour its commitments in that regard.  There is also the wider issue of the treatment of women who are atypical workers, if I can use that phrase, and how we are to deal with their pensions provision into the future.  I welcome the submissions.  I have been in touch with the IFA on the issue and welcome the fact it is represented here today.
11638	SeanSherlock	Labour	13629.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	13	 We will discuss that suggestion at a further meeting. I thank the officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and from the Department of Social and Family Affairs for briefing us so comprehensively on the issue.  I thank the members for their attendance.
11639	SeanSherlock	Labour	13467.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	84	" The second-last paragraph on page 3 of the IFA submission stated that because the nitrates regulations require slurry to be spread by the 15th of the month, the slurry was spread and good growing grass was spoiled.  Such grass is an essential and cost-effective fodder. On the science of prescribing a specific calendar date with regard to this cut-off point, can the delegates say, in all good scientific knowledge, that after the 15th any slurry spread will definitively fall into the water course or table and act as a pollutant?  If the answer is ""No"", is there now scope within the nitrates action plans — which presumably are to be negotiated next year — for a re-jigging of the system to allow for a greater degree of flexibility to offset the prohibitive nature of these so-called prohibitive periods?  It makes absolutely no sense to spread slurry at certain times of the year, given our weather patterns, especially this year, as speakers noted.  Such weather makes the spreading of slurry impossible. Are we now suggesting there must be a State slurry storage facility if we are to adhere to the rules and regulations, or will there be scope in any renegotiation of the nitrates action plan with the Commission to extend the deadlines or come up with some other system based on common sense?"
11640	SeanSherlock	Labour	13467.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	102	 I asked about the prohibitive periods and the negotiation of the nitrogen action plans for 2010.  Based on the answers we have received from Mr. Duggan, I am assuming there will be no change in the State's approach to the issue; I assume the status quo will remain in terms of our position on the matter.

On page 4 of Teagasc's proposals in the independent review document it is stated that it had been demonstrated that in specific farm scenarios those anomalies are leading to large structural phosphorus deficits.  I would like to get a broader view of what that means in terms of understanding the language.  On pages 24 and 25 of the same document the denitrification process is referred to and it is stated that during the delay period a large proportion of nitrate is expected to be ameliorated and denitrified to environmentally benign N2 gas.  Would it be possible to explain the preceding paragraphs in layman's terms? The reason I ask those questions is because they have a bearing in terms of calculations.  On page 3 of the Teagasc submission the introduction of new scientific research and flexibility in the closed period is referred to.  I would like an explanation of that paragraph and the transitional arrangements for pig and poultry manure.  Specific reference is made to proposed amendments in the submission on nitrogen availability in organic manures.  Could one of the Teagasc representatives expand slightly on this? It seems what is being suggested is that amendments on the simplification of calculations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser allowance be adopted to encourage the use of pig and poultry manure by livestock farmers.  What is the basis of that advice?  I would like to know that in layman's terms because perhaps I do not fully understand the scientific language of it. The draft GAP regulations include a mechanism through which they can be regulated to reflect the outcomes from new research on peer requirements of crops and animals as soon as these are published before the next review.  Can the delegates expand on this also?  Page 97 of the Teagasc document refers to streamlining the derogation under the GAP regulations.  This has a major bearing on outcomes in the political process.  Teagasc believes that having two separate dates associated with the process can cause unnecessary confusion for derogation applicants and participants.  Can the process be streamlined mid-stream?  What would the benefit of that be in real terms? We are all in complete agreement that the Food Harvest 2020 proposals will have to be predicated on the notion that we can continue to maximise efficiencies and that there is a political process set up so that Ireland's comparative advantage on food production will not be compromised.  There is a programme set out for each of the sectors such as dairy, poultry, pig and so on, and the Labour Party would welcome that new programme.  If the science is suggesting that we can deal with phosphorus and nitrogen and manage it in such a way, and if Teagasc is coming up with research that ameliorates it so that we do not compromise on our production and our comparative economic advantage, then every political party will have to support a process that ensures we can achieve the best for Irish agriculture.  I happen to think that the science is there to ensure that, but I also think that a message should be sent to the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government that if there are pollutants within the agricultural sector and if he is hell bent on going down the line of constricting agricultural practices, then he must take cognisance of the fact that there are other major pollutants that are also under his remit, such as local authorities.  If the Minister spent more time going after local authorities and invested properly in infrastructure, that would significantly improve water quality in this country also.

11645	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Current Developments in Northern Ireland: Discussion on Fresh Start Agreement	2	 I thank the Chairman and members of the committee. I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the current situation in Northern Ireland and the agreement reached following ten weeks of intensive talks. As members of the committee will know, these talks were brought to a successful conclusion on 17 November 2015 with negotiations resulting in “A Fresh Start – the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan”. The agreement is split into six sections covering ending paramilitarism and tackling organised crime, welfare reform and financial matters including financial supports from the British and Irish Governments and implementation of other aspects of the Stormont House agreement. Regrettably, it was not possible within the timescale of these talks to address all aspects of the Stormont House agreement and this is something I will return to in more detail later. The Fresh Start agreement is not a final destination but represents a significant step forward towards normalising politics and society. Considering where we began, in terms of the threat to the very existence of the devolved power sharing institutions, the agreement’s fundamental achievement is the stability it has brought to the institutions so that they are now in a position to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. With the strong support of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and I, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland worked with the five main political parties in Northern Ireland to ensure the threat of collapse was overcome and the political impasse was resolved. All parties around the table worked tirelessly to ensure Northern Ireland did not fall off the precipice and that all the good work that has been achieved in the North in the past 17 years was not undone. While focusing to some extent on the removal of obstacles, the Fresh Start agreement has ultimately delivered an outcome that not only unblocks progress, but provides a credible roadmap for implementing many aspects of the Stormont House agreement and tackling the continuing impact of paramilitarism. The continuing impact and legacy of paramilitarism was a key issue going into these talks and one that was threatening to destabilise the devolved power sharing institutions. The Fresh Start agreement sets out a plan to end the scourge of paramilitarism and associated criminality. Critically, all parties have agreed to sign up to a set of principles which commit them to achieving a society free of paramilitarism and challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities. In practical terms what this means is the execution of a strategy and action plan to be put in place by the Northern Ireland Executive by June 2016, the aim of which will be to work to disband paramilitary groups and end their destabilising influence on communities. Together with the British Government, the Irish Government will establish a four-member international body that will monitor and report on the progress made towards ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, taking account of the strategy to be agreed and implemented by the Executive. We will also work to enhance and improve cross-Border law enforcement and co-operation, particularly when it comes to tackling organised crime. This will be achieved through a joint agency task force that will be established to tackle these serious issues that are a threat to our communities. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will lead on this and will meet her Northern counterpart and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland next Monday to begin this process and to discuss measures to enhance further cross-Border co-operation. Important progress was also made in the areas of budgetary reforms and financial assistance. The Fresh Start agreement represents a genuinely exciting opportunity. It unblocks several important financial and institutional reforms which are so important for economic stability and will enable the Northern Ireland Executive to deliver more effectively for all the people of Northern Ireland. It will also help the Government and the Executive to co-operate further with the aim of unlocking the full potential of our island economy. The Government has made important financial commitments under the agreement. Contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive are under way with regard to the implementation of these, including the provision of £75 million towards the completion of the first part of the A5 motorway. This project will help unlock the full potential of the north west of the island. The Government has committed a further €2.5 million, which will be matched by the Northern Ireland Executive, for investment in a north-west regional development fund that includes County Donegal. We will continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueway leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal, and remain committed to the concept of the Narrow Water bridge which has the potential to provide jobs and a significant boost to tourism in the surrounding area. The Fresh Start agreement reaffirms the Government’s support for the EU PEACE and INTERREG programmes and its commitment to working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to fully realise the programmes' potential. Almost €500 million will be available from EU sources during the period 2016 to 2021. It also recalls the existing commitments set out in the Government’s capital plan regarding investment in key transport corridors, including the €18 million in funds committed to the ongoing upgrade of the Dublin-Belfast rail corridor and cross-Border co-operation in the areas of flood relief and the energy and communications sectors. The Government will continue to explore capital investment in health projects and services which benefit the Border region. These projects and initiatives have the potential to bring real day-to-day benefits to the people on both sides of the Border. We have committed a total of €110 million under this agreement, much of which will go towards realising the full economic potential of the north west. As the Minister of State with responsibility for North-South co-operation, I am especially pleased with the resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council following re-engagement by DUP Ministers. The North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, plenary meeting, hosted by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Armagh, was held last Friday, 11 December. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, attended the plenary where discussions centred on the recent A Fresh Start agreement and the work to be undertaken by officials to review North-South infrastructure projects. The council also welcomed the commitment in A Fresh Start to tackle paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime and to bring to justice those involved in them. I am glad to report that five North-South Ministerial sectoral meetings have taken place since the re-engagement of the DUP Ministers. It is important that momentum on North-South co-operation is picked up again both within the NSMC and outside of the formal structures, with particular focus on the economy, employment and business development. It was not possible, unfortunately, to address all aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in the Fresh Start agreement. It is regrettable that A Fresh Start did not address the implementation of the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement dealing with the legacy of the past. I share the disappointment felt by the victims of the Troubles, the survivors and their families. On several occasions I acted as co-chair to the round-table discussions on legacy issues. We were very close to agreement on a range of issues, including the establishment and operation of the historical investigations unit and the independent commission for information retrieval, the setting up of the implementation and reconciliation group on a statutory footing and the detail and operation of the oral history archive. A crucial issue upon which agreement could not be found was in striking the right balance between the disclosure needs of families and the national security requirements sought by the British Government. I stress again, and as the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has said previously, it was not the Irish Government which pressed for an agreement that left aside the legacy of the past. However, when it became clear that the choice was between having an agreement which uncoupled the past or having no agreement at all, the Government agreed most reluctantly to have a less than comprehensive deal which would at least ensure devolved institutions would be protected and placed on a stable and sustainable footing. It is important now to find a way forward that banks the good progress achieved during the talks and secures a solution to outstanding matters. To this end, contacts continue with the British Government, the five main political parties in Northern Ireland and, most important, with various victims’ groups. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Northern Ireland’s Commissioner for Victims and Survivors on 26 November to discuss the concerns of victims and possible ways to take the issue forward in a way that satisfies these concerns. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, also met the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, MLA, last Friday, 11 December 2015, and legacy was a key agenda item. Legacy will also be key in the upcoming meeting of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland before Christmas. The provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles. To achieve this, it is vital these new institutions have the trust and confidence of survivors and their families. Their needs will remain central to the Government’s work in this area. I reiterate the Government’s commitment to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to ensure A Fresh Start is implemented in full. While work will continue on the vital issue of dealing with the legacy of the past, this agreement is a further step forward in Northern Ireland’s journey towards long-term peace and stability. Through the implementation of the agreement, there is an opportunity to demonstrate that power-sharing devolution can provide good government and can offer hope for future generations. I thank committee members for their time.
11646	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Current Developments in Northern Ireland: Discussion on Fresh Start Agreement	4	 I will come back to the Chairman on the petitions of concern, but as I have said, it was not the Irish Government which pressed for an agreement that completely left aside the legacy of the past. The Government was faced with a choice between having an agreement which uncoupled the past or having no agreement at all. With regard to dealing with the legacy, there is a very firm commitment by the Government to ensure we continue the engagement on legacy issues. It will be vital to continue the engagement with victims' groups and their families and high-level political engagement will continue between the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. That engagement will continue apace next week. One could say there is a period of reflection happening now. However, it is important that we acknowledge that a lot of energy was put into dealing with legacy issues during the ten week process. It would not serve the best interests of both communities, north, south, east and west, not to continue the work. It is vital that we continue it but we must find a mechanism and a means that will allow us to do so. The Executive agreed a protocol on the use of the petition of concern that seeks to limit its use. It is voluntary in nature so we will have to see how it will operate within the Assembly. There is perhaps a school of thought that the petition of concern power has been used at sensitive times. The protocol is now in place, however, and the Irish Government hopes the procedure will be used with a positive mindset, if that makes sense.
11647	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Current Developments in Northern Ireland: Discussion on Fresh Start Agreement	10	 I will endeavour to be as comprehensive as possible. If I miss out on something, I hope members will come back in. Deputy Kitt made a point on legacy. We took the view that we were close to agreement on the operation of the historical investigations unit, including on the provision of guaranteeing its independence and the point that it would be compliant with the Patten principles on policing and justice. Let us go back to what I said originally and factor in Deputy Crowe's point on where the agreement fell. We expressed our preference during the talks for a process that would cover the range of legacy issues on which agreement was possible. The view was that there should be an approach to inculcate a process or speak to the issue of legacy in such a way as not to exclude it from an agreement. The idea was to ensure that we would have a pathway for continuation. In the absence of agreement on the issue we are now in a situation where we stand ready to engage on legacy issues again. The two Governments are seeking a way forward. It is not possible to put an exact timeline on it. We are willing to engage. However, in the case of legacy issues people have to be willing to engage on the basis that there is the prospect of success. I take the point made about what one might term the anachronistic iterative processes that have gone on since 1998 and whether it is possible to provide a way for innovation to allow us to overcome these issues outside of a hothouse arrangement or an intensive process that goes on for ten weeks, but one in which there is no guarantee of success on certain aspects that need to be dealt with for the benefit of this island and our neighbours to the east. There is scope now for some new thinking at political level in terms of how we engage on an ongoing basis rather than within the confined process. We do not always get the outcomes we desire. Deputy O'Reilly made a particular point. Section A of the agreement contains a specific reference to the joint agency task force. The Deputy asked how that is comprised. It will be led by senior officers from Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs. There is a specific reference to the effect that the task force will report on its work in accordance with the statutory arrangements in place for the law enforcement agencies. In turn, the task force will have a strategic oversight group and an operations co-ordination unit. That much is well laid out. Deputy O'Reilly also asked about economic activity and supports within the Border region. He made reference to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. I contend that the Government has done a great deal of work with our neighbours to ensure funding will be provided where there is framework for it. A great deal of work was done to get us to the point where we actually agreed on PEACE, for example. That will translate back into the Border region in respect of economic activity. I take the point made on the north-west gateway initiative. The A5 proposal is the key. Deputy Kitt asked about the €110 million allocation. That is the entirety of the package from an Irish Government perspective, so it is inclusive of the north-west gateway initiative. It also includes the other commitments on the A5. No one would disagree with the fact that the north west is a region requiring more in respect of political commitment. There are good initiatives at play there at present, particularly with the two councils on either side of the Border. It is for us at governmental level to try to support that in every way we can. Increasing economic activity is one of the key areas. Deputy's Crowe spoke about legacy, national security and the approach taken. I think I have answered the question about the approach. If I was to speak personally, I would say that perhaps the approach needs to be looked at again. I do not mean to be ageist, but I am, perhaps, part of a particular generation of politicians. We can name any number of agreements and negotiations, such as the 1998 process or the Weston Park negotiations; it is an iterative process. This generation is as much obliged as the previous one to continue the work on legacy issues, however. We do not want to let another generation pass without ensuring that justice can be found for the victims and their families. That is a fundamental principle which underpins any Irish Government policy on the North, no matter who is in the driving seat. While we stand ready to re-engage on legacy issues, the timing of that engagement remains to be determined. We look forward to co-operating. In my opening remarks I said that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be meeting with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, next week. Part of that conversation will be about continuing to maintain momentum on the need to deal with the issues which Deputy Crowe has articulated in respect of national security and disclosure. I do not think today is the day to open up parts of the negotiations again. We felt that we had made some progress in creating the institutions that were necessary to deal with legacy, such as the implementation and reconciliation group, IRG and the historical investigations unit, HIU. However, during the process of negotiation there was agreement all around that we need to get to a point at which there is at least agreement on the need to restore confidence in the institutions. There was consensus that we would revisit the other aspects and continue to devote energy to them. People have expressed their good wishes and congratulations but I have to say that congratulations are due to Mr. Garvin and Ms McGrath beside me, and to a great team of officials from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality. Incidentally, that Department will take the lead in the interaction on the task force issues. It is a team approach and the work will continue between sets of negotiations. I reassure the committee that it is a constant process. There was a specific question about flood relief and energy. Those issues are dealt with in the sectoral elements and in the ongoing work at ministerial level. As I said at the outset, we have seen a new energy about ensuring that the agenda on ongoing North-South issues, such as flooding and flood relief, is dealt with through sectoral engagements.

We should note the contribution he made as a negotiator on behalf of his party; he was at the table as well. A great deal of work was done by all parties in respect of the contributions to this agreement. I am just one person. Along with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, I represented the Irish Government at the talks. However, talks are only as good as the people who contribute to them. Significant contributions were made by those on all sides. I take this opportunity, in a personal capacity, to thank Dr. Alasdair McDonnell for his role and also for the contribution he made, as the former leader of his party, when the talks were ongoing. The word ""blanket"" was used and Mr. Brady referred to the cover of the blanket during the past 40 years. With respect to the generational element, there is as much of a responsibility on politicians of my generation as there is on those who go before us to ensure that the legacy issues are not forgotten. We need to continue to press the British Government on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Pat Finucane case and the relatives groups. In the context of the issue of disclosure and national security, we need to ensure that some mechanism is found to deal with the outstanding historical issues. If society is to heal itself and if we are talking about the restoration of normative politics, in my humble opinion, there will not be a move on that restoration until such time as those issues are dealt with. That is a view that informs the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice and Equality in their everyday work. In the context of the team of people from the Department of Foreign Affairs who work with the victims and families and at political level in Northern Ireland - quietly and underneath the radar - in terms of trying to progress this agenda on a constant basis, it is fair to say that successive Irish Governments have sought to lean heavily on the British Government with regard to very specific cases and in respect of the principle that if society is to heal itself, it cannot do so unless the legacy issues are dealt with. I would contend that much progress was made last year on devising a process for dealing with the legacy issues and in regard to the potential for setting up institutional changes that would deal with that. We will continue to work on that matter. When the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, meets the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, next week, the legacy issues will continue to be discussed and they will continue to be live issues. I take the point that was made by Deputy Smith on the issue of the timelines and the electoral cycle. The work continues regardless of the electoral cycle. Whether it is possible to begin a process again early in the new year remains to be seen but, as I said at the outset, the Irish Government stands ready to engage. If there is a process that is to be started again in regard to dealing with these issues, we stand ready. There is no doubt but that we stand ready to deal with the legacy issues."
11651	SeanSherlock	Labour	15716.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2015-12-17 00:00:00	Current Developments in Northern Ireland: Discussion on Fresh Start Agreement	24	" We will continue the engagement with the Secretary of State. We have a soon to be appointed First Minister, if that person has not been ratified already and there is a Deputy First Minister. With respect to the negotiations, we felt strongly that we had made progress on the legacy issues. If the parties within the Executive feel that there is an urgency about dealing with these matters in the next number of weeks, the Irish Government stands ready to engage with the parties on it. With respect to Senator Jim D'Arcy's points on justice issues, a meeting between the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and Mr. David Forde took place on 11 December and another meeting will take place next week. If one notes the strategic oversight group, a distinction can be made between setting up an agency and setting up a task force. In the context of establishing a task force and doing so correctly, I would refer to a strategic oversight group which is inherent within the task force and an operations co-ordination group. I will quote directly from the document, which states, ""representatives from the relevant law enforcement agencies at senior management level) that will identify strategic priorities for combating cross-jurisdictional organised crime"". There is the day-to-day work that continues with respect to the cross-Border crime effort. This will allow for a flexible and reflexive response at the same time and it would be possible to do that in a co-ordinated way. There will be six-monthly ministerial meetings to ensure that this work is given the energy that it absolutely deserves. I note the points in the agreement about Narrow Water bridge, the points about the symbolism of the road going both ways, as was said, in regard to the potential for tourism. I note also the points that are made in it on the issue of funding for tourism in context of the PEACE or INTERREG programmes. I further note the point that is made about the wording in regard to strengthening it and putting a budget line behind it, and that is something we will take away from this. With regard to the point on the petition of concern and having an opposition, we have an appreciation of the various strands that exist under the Good Friday Agreement. There is an appreciation in this committee of the area of competences. In the context of Mr. McCallister's Bill, I would say that if one views it from one perspective, it is a very positive contribution to the restoration of normative politics in Northern Ireland. However, as a Member of the Dáil, and observing it from that vantage point, I would say, without seeking to kick to touch, that this would still be a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. We would not go into the proposals in the Bill from a Government point of view but it is a positive step forward in terms of the contribution it will make towards the restoration of normative politics. I am not saying that politics there is abnormal in any sense, I am just saying that we operate in a particular way within this House. As parliamentarians, the concept of opposition and government is completely inherent to how we do business. I would imagine that any moves towards that would be welcomed but there is still an Executive and we acknowledge that as well. I hope I have answered all of the questions that were put to me and if I have not, I would be happy to come back in again. I want to record my appreciation of the thanks people have offered us. I will convey that to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and our team in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I thank the Chairman and members for the time they have afforded us."

I am trying to get my head around the status of PEACE IV, the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, and INTERREG. There are concerns about the future status of projects in the pipeline. We will have the North's Minister of Finance here later. Will the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, give us his political perspective on where PEACE IV and INTERREG stand? Approximately €550 million from Europe is allocated in this regard. Many people in the Border areas have an expectation around that matter and there is some question mark over it. What is the Minister's perspective on it, particularly in light of the deadline on these projects coming in November vis-à-vis the Treasury? Do we know the Treasury's position? Has that position hardened with regard to commitments there? These projects have serious implications for people.

My first question relates specifically to the Minister's intervention where he stated that he had agreed a safeguard clause to Brexit-proof letters of offer to programme beneficiaries. Could he flesh out that statement and tell us exactly what it means in relation to securing funding lines for the very programmes he talks about? The second issue I wish to raise relates to Horizon 2020. I am encouraged by the fact that the Minister made specific reference to it. He might indicate what the permutations might be for Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, funded programmes whereby the legislative base within the Twenty-six Counties is such that the remit of SFI allows it to fund researchers in the North and the South. I am concerned that when the United Kingdom exits the European Union, it will put this island at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing the Horizon 2020 funding pot because, to all intents and purposes, there are two jurisdictions which can collaborate to access funding from the main source. Has the Government given any thought to what the permutations will be in seeking science funding and for the island of Ireland in reaching the stated target in accessing the Horizon 2020 funding pot? Has the Government, not specifically the Minister, engaged with Science Foundation Ireland on having a co-ordinated view on the research infrastructure which is vital in supporting thousands of jobs, North and South? What is the Minister's general view on that issue? We are all following the passage of the legislation before the House of Commons. I understand the opposition tabled an amendment, No. 86, to require Article 50 not break to anything agreed to in the Good Friday Agreement, to put it loosely. I understand the amendment was defeated by a majority of 39. Therefore, de facto, the Tories defeated the amendment. I am concerned about this. Is the Government watching the legislation from that vantage point? Does it have a strong view that sufficient attention is being given by the UK Government to the Good Friday Agreement? If the UK Government is defeating simple amendments of this nature, it may speak to a certain attitude that would concern me.

His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments on enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed. I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland. He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter. My first question is very simple. Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principles of parity of esteem and human rights protection are upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU? If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights? My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in The Observer on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position on citizens' rights. He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement. This is another simple question. How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years? I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.

First, to what consultation was Mr. Hynes referring? Second, from a layman's point of view how would Mr. Stack envisage an amnesty would work relative to current legislation? For example, if the person comes through the process and if the family recommends the amnesty would that give rise to a legislative framework which would have to supersede or complement current legislation vis-à-vis criminal law as it stands? On Glencree, the conclusion is that we must ensure that the legacy of the past is not another stage to play out tired, repetitive and old, worn out arguments. Is there a critique to be had of the Stormont House Agreement as it relates to, for instance, the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, the oral history archive and the legacy of the past issues? Is there enough within those three proposals as agreed in Stormont to chart a way forward which everybody could potentially buy-into with confidence from a Glencree perspective?
11668	SeanSherlock	Labour	16409.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2017-11-09 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	 I thank all of today's witnesses. Mr. Hynes noted our responsibility as a committee. We are trying to formulate a report on the issue of victims and legacy issues and it is hoped that some of the issues raised today will form part of the report and its recommendations. I hope the witnesses found the opportunity to give evidence here today useful and I apologise again for the late starting hour of the meeting. I realise the structure itself is probably not great for interaction and so on but it is what we are faced with. I think everyone was impressed with the evidence today. It has given us a lot to think about for the report. If there is anything the witnesses feel they, as a group, may have overlooked here today, please forward it to us and we will include it in the report. I wish the witnesses a safe journey home.
11669	SeanSherlock	Labour	17625.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-03-09 00:00:00	Public Consultation on the National Development Plan (Resumed): Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and for Transport	85	 I thank the Chairman for allowing me to substitute for Deputy Duncan Smith. I come from the town of Mallow, which is one of those towns that the Minister has described in terms of developing their potential and radiating their services outward. I am a regular rail user. Currently, 90% of my travel is by rail between Mallow and Dublin. I am an onward user of the Leap card, which is like a piece of gold to me. If I am a Mallow resident, though, I cannot use it to travel to Cork. I can travel from Dublin Pearse Station to Greystones using a Leap card, but not from Mallow to Cork. Therein lies the injustice and inequality. I have been campaigning for nearly three years to have the Leap card service extended between Mallow and Cork. I have been going in and out of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and going around the houses. If the Minister is serious about shifting modes of transport and putting people on trains and buses, will he please take on this simple issue? It is useless for us to talk about modal shifts unless we go after the low-hanging fruit. It would be significant if the Leap card could be used by students, older people or people of any age to go in and out of Cork. We would see a dramatic reduction in the number of cars on the roads to Cork because public transport services could be extended. My next issue concerns towns themselves. I hope that the Minister has relations in or some connection to Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville. I am sure he will recount a personal tale for us. If he has a personal connection to any of those towns, I implore him to ensure that the ongoing consultation process in respect of a bypass for Mallow is followed up with a budget line. It is vital that the town be bypassed, but it is also important that if we are going to - I believe I have interpreted the Minister correctly in this - bypass towns like Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville, we do not take our eye off the ball as regards the proposed M20 Cork-Limerick motorway. I continue to make the case for the motorway on the basis of regional investment into the very towns the Minister was talking about on the one hand and, on the other, ensuring that we make roads safe. There have been too many fatalities on the routes between Cork and Limerick. On average, there are more than 17,000 movements between Cork and Charleville per day. Too many people have died. I ask that the proposals not be mutually exclusive goals. The bypass is needed, but there is also a need to deal with towns like Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville. I do not want to be too parochial, but we must speak to thousands upon thousands of people in the Munster region who are depending on the bypass to be completed in an appropriate way. Like the Chairman, I welcome the investment in public transport that the Minister mentioned. I am someone who loves using the train. The two proposals are not mutually exclusive. My final point is on EirGrid and the interconnector. Everyone sees the interconnector's potential. The point at which landfall takes place is in east Cork. There are residents in the little area around Churchtown and Roxborough who have expressed concerns. If possible, will the Minister use his good offices to intercede with EirGrid, insofar as that is appropriate, to ensure that there is no disruption to the lives of people living in those little pockets? We all realise that the interconnector will be a vital piece of infrastructure, as do the residents, but they have expressed concerns.

11675	SeanSherlock	Labour	13454.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	58	" I will be brief.  I apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation.  Along with Deputy Broughan, who sends his apologies, I have already met Mr. Roche and Mr. Bonham.  As a representative of a rural constituency that has seen the benefits of this programme, I would like to restate the Labour Party's support for it.  The intergenerational solidarity that existed when people lived in tighter and smaller communities has diminished over the years as people have dispersed.  Many older people who reside on their own are unable to drive or have stopped driving over recent years — their children may have flown the nest to live in Dublin and other far-flung places — and therefore depend on rural transport services. If one considers this matter rationally, it is clear that the budgetary provision of €11 million that has been made is no more than a drop in the ocean in the grand scheme of things.  One of the benefits of the existence of the rural transport scheme is the social solidarity it engenders.  I had the good fortune to travel on the Blackwater-Avondhu service last Thursday morning, in the company of a bunch of the finest people one is ever likely to meet.  Such country people, who are the salt of the earth, could be described as our own people.  They benefit from their interaction with similar people as they access services which they would not have been able to access before now.  Common sense says that it is practical and worthwhile to defend such services. As someone with a background in economics, I am aware that it is sometimes called ""the dismal science"".  I suppose there is a sense in which economists apply a certain rationale to how things are done.  They sometimes extract the human benefit from that rationale.  I suggest that the production of the McCarthy report was a very academic exercise, which did not take account of the need to protect our strong rural population and provide the services that are needed in rural areas.  The diminution of services advocated in the report must be fought at a political level.  I am here to support that fight."
11676	SeanSherlock	Labour	13454.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2009-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	58	 I thank the delegation for its contribution.  Mr. Jack Roche has a long history of achievements and the latest is no exception.  I thank Mr. Coppins, in particular, for the good support he has received in the Department.  I hope we will see a continuation of this very good service.  I thank all the Oireachtas Members in attendance, including those who are not members of the committee.
11677	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	16	" I note with interest Mr. Nolan's submission, especially where he refers to the capital investment programme, saying, ""Should additional funding be allocated following the mid-term review of the plan, TII will look at the potential to accelerate certain projects, the construction of additional projects and the planning of others, including the upgrade of the strategic connection between Cork and Limerick."" In the context of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and regional economic growth and development, the Cork to Limerick corridor, or the Atlantic corridor as it was known previously, is a vital link because there are more than 300,000 jobs earmarked for that region in the action plan. Is the M20 being actively considered in discussions between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister in terms of ensuring that the project, which is so vital to the economic and social interests of the people in the south, south west and west, is progressed? Is there any potential for money to be made available on the basis of the submission that has been made to this committee? The witnesses have said that it can take five years to achieve planning approval for major roads projects. They also said that we risk having a shortage of approved projects for inclusion in any new capital investment plan. Failure to respond to future needs will lead to increased congestion. Reading between the lines, TII is sending a signal that this project is vital and that funding is required to get it through planning or at least to the first phase. I am not talking about an entire package of funding for absolute completion but funding to at least progress the project. Is there a funding line for that project? Under the previous capital investment plan announced by the last Government there was a specific reference to the relief road for Mallow. As everyone knows, Mallow forms part of the M20 corridor. The people of Mallow and north Cork want to know when they can expect to see that work starting. They also want to know if TII, the Department and the Minister are considering the question of dovetailing the two projects. How will the two projects coalesce? There is an understanding on all sides of the need for the M20 Cork to Limerick project. That is understood by everybody in an apolitical sense but the question is, ""When?"". The submission to the committee today suggests that a political decision on funding will be vital in order to get the project off the starting blocks. I want to acknowledge the constructive engagement I have had with TII on national secondary roads. Notwithstanding the dearth of funding that is available for such roads there have been some improvements to the N72 and the N73 in the north Cork area of late. However, further funding is required for these roads. There is a serious public safety issue, particularly with regard to the Mallow to Mitchelstown link which serves as a corridor west of Mallow for connectivity onward to Dublin. It is a vital transport corridor but there are parts of that national secondary road that are so narrow that two lorries trying to pass each other would have to slow down to 5 kmph to do so safely. I am making the case for further investment from a road safety point of view and ask that this be actively considered and prioritised in the TII budget line in co-operation with Cork County Council. To reiterate my earlier point, if it takes five years to achieve planning approval for major road projects such as the M20 then we need a signal now from TII that it is engaging with the Department on the Cork to Limerick section of the route. We need to see some progress made."
11678	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	43	 Is it appropriate for me to seek clarification?
11679	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	45	 Effectively, Mr. Nolan is saying that this progressed significantly in that resources have been made available to get the M20, Cork to Limerick, back on the planning agenda.
11680	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	61	 Thank you, Chairman, for your indulgence on this matter. It is a vital piece of infrastructure. The witness mentioned the abolition of quotas and, perhaps, going back to a blank page again because the previous routes that had been selected might have to be revised. That is not to put words into his mouth. As I said previously, there is a situation with the Mallow relief road. It is a vital dovetail to this project. That is the view of the Mallow Development Partnership, which is a stakeholder group, and Dairygold Co-operative Society Ltd., one of the biggest dairy co-operatives in the country. With the abolition of milk quotas, there is talk about massive drying plants in Mallow and Mitchelstown. The vehicular issues in Mallow arising from agricultural transport and milk production will be vital. That is the reason the thinking behind the northern relief road, in terms of dovetailing into the M20 project, will be important. I am not saying the witness will have the wisdom of Solomon on that at this juncture for the purposes of this committee, but I seek a sense from him of how that project will progress now.
11681	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	65	 I am glad the Deputy is coming around to my way of thinking.
11682	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	74	 I also asked about the N72 and N73. I would like a reply about the road safety issue. Ideally Mr. Nolan should drive the stretch of road between Mitchelstown and Mallow. We all acknowledge the works on sections of the road between Mallow and Fermoy and Mallow and Mitchelstown but there are still sections which are very unsafe.
11683	SeanSherlock	Labour	16051.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2016-11-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee.	76	 That is the ideal time to drive it to see how bad it is. I thank Mr. Nolan.

I had hoped to raise two issues today but instead I will ask the witnesses to provide a written update to the committee. The first issue is our winter readiness preparations. While the weather is unseasonably mild at the moment, a week is a long time in politics and in meteorology. I ask for an update on what has been done to prepare for any potential cold snap or other adverse weather conditions. The other issue is the commitments made regarding tolling, public private partnerships and the expense being incurred by the Exchequer by way of payments in respect of the motorway network. I ask the witnesses to provide data on the annual payments and to indicate whether the Exchequer has benefited from the increased usage of the motorway network as a result of the improvements in the economy. I would be grateful for an update on the current position in that regard. I thank all the witnesses for their attendance this morning. We have had a long meeting and we appreciate the openness and frankness of the witnesses' engagement with us.

11691	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	62	 I thank Senator Hoey for allowing me to deputise on her behalf at this meeting. How many beds are situated in the Owenacurra centre?
11692	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	64	 How many beds are registered for respite?
11693	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	67	 Would the families of residents who stayed at the centre for short periods have classed that stay as respite or inpatient? I suggest to the witnesses that we have to be very careful about language here because there is an expectation within the community that there is a respite provision. We can use all of the euphemistic language that we like. The HSE's understanding may be that they are technically not respite beds, but they are known and understood within the community to be respite beds. Notwithstanding that those beds may not have been occupied over the period of the pandemic, I suggest to the HSE that in closing this centre it is removing a massive respite service and that is going to have a knock-on effect for the people of Midleton, Youghal, Cobh and further afield. What consideration is the HSE giving to St. Stephen's Hospital as an alternative setting for some of the residents of the Owenacurra centre?
11694	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	69	" I beg the Chair's protection. I do not wish to sound rude, but allow me to rephrase the question. Is the HSE, ""Yes"" or ""No"" considering St. Stephen's Hospital as an alternative accommodation for current residents of the Owenacurra centre?"
11695	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	71	 Can I take it that the HSE is considering St. Stephen's Hospital and, possibly, St. Catherine's centre as well? If it is the case that the HSE is considering all of the needs of all of the patients, I put it to the HSE and to the clinical director that taking people out of the Owenacurra single room setting on the basis that room sizes are too small, as identified in the Mental Health Commission report, and putting them into a ward setting is a Dickensian and backward step and is not in the interests of the residents. I hope the HSE is not considering that as an option. I am no therapist or clinician, but I know from talking to the families that from a therapeutic point of view, that would be a very poor step. I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to respond. If he can tell me that the HSE is not considering St. Stephen's Hospital as an option, a lot of people will be very relieved.
11696	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	73	 Is the Mental Health Commission currently doing a review of St. Stephen's Hospital?
11697	SeanSherlock	Labour	17821.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2021-09-21 00:00:00	Mental Health Services: HSE	75	 Has the Mental Health Commission been in touch with the HSE in respect of St. Stephen's Hospital? Is Mr. Fitzgerald aware of whether the Mental Health Commission has visited St. Stephen's Hospital? In terms of where I am coming from on this, Cois Alla in Kanturk covers a geographical area, Solas Nua covers Mallow, the Carrigabrick service covers Fermoy and the Carrigmore service covers Cork. What the HSE is doing in closing Owenacurra centre is to de facto take out a massive geographical area in terms of residential capability, including respite and short-term capability. That is the message that is being sent to the families. As a committee, we have to speak for the families. The witnesses may argue that we are being rhetorical in doing so, but we empathise and sympathise with the families on the basis that we share their concerns and fears that this process, which started in June and is to be a four-month process, is too short. Not enough time or consideration has been given to all of the factors involved such that every person can be happy that whatever transition he or she makes will be safe for him or her, but that if there are any question marks over the process, a break will be put on it. The Minister should intervene directly on this issue. At this stage, we have all been in contact with him about this. There needs to be pause for thought and reflection about whether we are sending residents who have made huge progress from a therapeutic point of view backwards instead of forwards into life. We should not be providing services in a setting that is further away from where they live and where their families are. Do the witnesses understand those fears? They are legitimate fears on the part of people and we are trying to reflect them to the witnesses. I refer again to the services in Kanturk, Mallow, Fermoy and Carrigmore. They are set within the towns and they are fit for purpose, although I accept there are issues with them from time to time in terms of meeting the full panoply of regulations. I am not convinced. We have heard here from every single member across the political divide that there needs to be some pause for reflection on this. Quite frankly, the witnesses have not fully articulated the issue of the cost of replacement. They state that they have produced an internal report. However, it is unconscionable that the HSE should come to this committee without anticipating a question from one or all members as to how much would it cost to do the repairs and refurbishment, as well as on the cost of a replacement building on that site. The HSE has significant capital resources to do that. We do not want a situation following this decision whereby people in the east Cork region who need access to mental health services will be left bereft. I ask that the HSE pauses and reflects on this decision. They have given four months' notice. If you are kicking a dog out of the kennel, you would give him more notice than you have given some of these people to be out of their home. I am sorry if I sound exercised about this issue but I feel strongly about it. A pause needs to be put on this in the public interest and in order that we as public representatives have more time to interrogate line by line everything that you are doing here. Then we can fully and with good conscience represent constituents for whom we are deeply concerned on this matter. I apologise that I have used up most of my time, Chair. They have 30 seconds to reply.

11705	SeanSherlock	Labour	14092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	 I thank the Senator for his gracious and kind comments which are greatly appreciated.  He might drop me a note on the issues he has raised because we should engage on what is a genuine undertaking on his part. I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills. I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the provision of new post-primary schools to cater for demographic increases.  The Department's most recent statistics indicate that the number of pupils at second level is projected to increase by 24,900 from the current level of circa 317,400 pupils to 342,300 by 2017.  The projections indicate that pupil numbers will continue to rise until 2024, when it is expected there will be in the region of 383,000 pupils in the second-level system.  That represents an increase of 65,700 pupils over the current levels. The Department is utilising a geographical information system, GIS, to identify the areas in which there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This detailed analysis is now being finalised and action plans are being drawn up for each priority location in order to determine how to meet the additional school accommodation requirements for each area for the next four to five years. It is within this context that the Minister recently announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established within the next six years, comprising 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools.  Of the 40 new schools, 17 will be in the Dublin area, with a further 12 in the commuter belt of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth.  Six new schools will be established in Cork, three in Galway and one each in Wexford and Cavan.  Included in this announcement are new post-primary schools for Navan, Drogheda and Ashbourne, which will greatly enhance second-level provision in the wider area referred to by the Deputy.  In addition, the Department recognised a new post-primary school for east Meath, located in Laytown, in 2008-09.  The school is currently located in temporary accommodation beside the site on which the permanent new school is under construction.  The new permanent school building, which will provide accommodation for 1,000 pupils, is expected to be ready in July 2012.  This school caters for children from the east Meath areas of Laytown, Bettystown, Stamullen and Julianstown.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.
11706	SeanSherlock	Labour	14092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	331	 I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  As the Senator has raised the issue of the job losses at GlaxoSmithKline, it is important for us to join with him in acknowledging the addition to the numbers unemployed in Dungarvan.  I acknowledge what the Senator is saying in that regard and I join with him, although I do not want to give just platitudes, in extending our sympathy to those families.  I have listened to his comments about the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I must note for the record that the Senator's Oireachtas colleague Deputy Ciara Conway also contacted me today about the GlaxoSmithKline announcement.  I was told that while the headcount reduction is regrettable — there is no question about that — the company's aim is to remain focused on the long-term future of the site, ensuring that it remains competitive.  Although the site remains strategic within the company's network, the company must continue to control its cost base and be more flexible because of global trends.  That is the line coming from the company on this. It is easy for us as Ministers to stand here and say this is down to a global phenomenon, but a foreign direct investment company is particularly subject to retrenchment in terms of its cost base, especially if it is competing against other aspects of its own structure, and it is appropriate for it to reduce its costs.  The unfortunate thing about that is the resulting job losses.  If it does have a programme of retrenchment, the important thing is that the company makes itself sustainable so it can preserve the remaining jobs.  We must try our best to work with the State agencies in that regard. I have noted the report referred to by the Senator, which was produced in 2008, a time when the country as a whole was facing immense challenges.  We all know that job creation is central to our economic recovery and it will be clear from the programme for Government that job creation is at the core of the Government's policies.  The role of my Department is to ensure we have the right policies in place to support and enlarge our enterprise base in order to facilitate job creation and job retention. The jobs initiative announced on 10 May focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation.  The initiative represents a positive intervention to support those entrepreneurs and business people who will create jobs and rebuild our economy.  The key elements were the retention of the 12.5% corporation tax and the introduction of a new, temporary, second reduced rate of VAT to apply primarily to restaurants and catering services, hotel and holiday accommodation and various entertainment services.  I hope these reductions were adhered to in Waterford especially in recent weeks with the visit of the tall ships and I hope that the hospitality sector there has done well out of it.  Our hope is that this will continue.  Other elements include the halving of the lower rate of employers PRSI on earnings of up to €356 per week; the focus of the State's capital expenditure towards more employment-intensive projects in the areas of education, local and regional roads and sustainable transport projects; and the provision of an extra 20,900 activation places for the unemployed.  The jobs initiative is an important first step in this regard. One announcement for the south-east region this year will create 50 new jobs in Waterford.  Also, jobs announced for the region in recent years continue to come on-stream.  As well as marketing the region for new green-field investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland and also with existing clients to re-invest in sites in the region.  While we are operating in difficult economic times, there are still investment opportunities in global markets.  There are 31 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Waterford city and county employing approximately 5,300 people.  Clear evidence of a transition towards more knowledge-based and higher value activity is apparent in the resilience of companies such as Bausch & Lomb, Honeywell, Citi Hedge Funds, Genzyme and Sun Life Financial. I will be visiting Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, because I have heard about the great work under way there in the life sciences, information and communications technology, international services and high technology engineering areas.  WIT is one place earmarked for a visit by me as the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  It is important to spin out as many companies as we can, locally if possible, from such institutes as WIT.
11707	SeanSherlock	Labour	14092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	 I refer to the last point made by the Minister of State.  This is precisely why we need a university for the region.  Some people maintain that if a university were in place, there may be greater research and development opportunities and we might not have seen the job losses announced at GlaxoSmithKline.  The Minister of State is correct to suggest this is about reducing costs in the company.  The company wishes to reduce costs by €10 million.  The costs of these job losses will be €3.3 million.  However, the money being borrowed from the IMF and put into the banks, the cost of the bailout to the State and the profit which our European partners will make will be in the region of €9 billion.  Yet, such companies are struggling and need support. I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I welcome that the Minister of State will visit Waterford Institute of Technology but I hope the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will consider the town of Dungarvan.  I do not share the Minister of State's view that IDA Ireland is doing its best for the town.  There have been no major investments in the town in recent years.  There have been major job losses but no new opportunities.  I hope the Minister of State will take this on board.

11709	SeanSherlock	Labour	14188.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	 I am happy to have the opportunity to speak in the Seanad about supporting, embedding and realising a return on investment in science, technology and innovation for national competitive advantage.  It is at the heart of what we do.  We do not invest for investment's sake but in order that Ireland can gain a competitive advantage and prosper economically.  Investment must result in jobs.  Senators will be aware the Government has set job creation and retention as one of its key priorities in the programme for Government.  This is what drives the work of my Department and that of other key Departments as we seek to provide a better future for our young people and society in general. For the first time in three years, Ireland is likely to experience growth this year.  Although the growth will be modest, it charts the successful turnaround of the economy by the Government.  Economic commentators generally agree that stronger growth is likely to follow for Ireland next year.  The labour market is starting to show signs of stabilisation.  We still have the long-standing Irish strengths that have served us well for many years, including a young and well educated workforce, growing levels of research and development activity, an attractive corporate tax regime that will be maintained, a hub of internationally trading businesses and a foreign direct investment record which is envied worldwide.  A number of companies have recently shown that they are aware of these strengths by making new investments and expanding existing operations here.  They include Coca-Cola which has expanded its operations in Wexford; arvato which is increasing its workforce by more than 10% in financial services; ClearStream Technologies which is creating over 70 new jobs in Enniscorthy and Combilift which is creating 25 new jobs in Monaghan. In terms of others announced in the past few months: Bioware in Galway is recruiting another 200 employees in preparation for one of the biggest game launches of the year; MSD announced the creation of a further 50 jobs at the official opening of the new €100 million pharmaceutical research and development centre in Tipperary to add to the 70 additional jobs already planned at its site in Cork; Boston Scientific will invest €26 million in research and development at its facility in Clonmel; Paypal will recruit 200 more employees in customer services in Blanchardstown; Ericsson is building on its successful research and development operations in Athlone in taking on an additional 100 software engineers at its research and development centre to support local and regional remits; Intel has announced another 200 jobs in Kildare; DELL expects to employ an additional 150 workers between its operations in Dublin and Limerick; VM Ware, the global  leader in virtualisation and cloud infrastructure, has announced plans to create 250 new jobs in Cork over three years; while SAP announced plans to expand its workforce by 100 in Citywest, Dublin. These companies are all showing their belief in the economy and the Irish labour market.  For those who are still out of work, however, our objective in government is to encourage the creation of new jobs by putting supportive enterprise policies in place and aligning all of our investments for a return in the form of sustainable jobs. The improvement in our conditions is being led by the exporting sectors of the economy.  Increased exports will lead to a multiplier effect and feed through to the domestic economy as exporting companies grow and increase their dependence on suppliers. The Government is continuing to implement the trade strategy, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy,which is aimed at helping Irish businesses to compete in global markets.  It is heartening to know that despite the turbulent international markets into which we are exporting, our exports are continuing to perform to an extremely high level.  Merchandise exports are performing strongly — up 6% in the first half of the year, with the highest monthly trade surplus for ten years being seen in June.  Meanwhile, Ireland's services exports for the second quarter of the year reached a new quarterly record of nearly €20 billion, representing an increase of 7.3% on the same quarter in 2010. Investment in science, technology and innovation has played a large part.  It is no accident that companies undertaking research and development have shown a level of growth in trade and exports during the downturn that demonstrates the value of productive, high calibre research and innovation activity.  Less than ten years ago, in 2004, just 10% of the FDI project wins achieved by IDA Ireland were research and development based and valued at €120 million. Subsequent years have seen a continuing upward trajectory in the research and development component of IDA Ireland wins, where in 2009 the level based in research, development and innovation was 49% of overall IDA Ireland new client business and valued at a very impressive €500 million. My responsibilities as Minister of State entail close and co-ordinated engagement with the key enterprise agencies to deliver a real and positive impact on improving Ireland's competitiveness.  Strategic investments in research and development have contributed significantly to the creation and application of new knowledge and technology across the enterprise spectrum, the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and embedding the FDI base in Ireland.  This work is also meeting the objective of improving Ireland's international reputation as a place in which to do business and a location for generating and using new technology and knowledge. Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver a world-class standard of research activity in third level institutions and linked with Irish enterprises.  Through industry-embedded research groups, it is helping to support the retention of employment in high value jobs in Ireland.  It is funding 28 research centres — nine centres for science, engineering and technology, CSETs, and 19 strategic research clusters, SRCs, undertaking research activity allied with the needs of industry, involving in excess of 180 industry partners. Enterprise Ireland is the agency responsible for the promotion of indigenous exporting companies, with the ultimate objective of increasing exports, employment and prosperity.  Increasing the value of our indigenous exports will play a critical part in securing economic recovery, maintaining existing jobs and creating new ones.  Enterprise Ireland operates a suite of programmes to expand research capacity in companies, increase collaboration between enterprise and the research sector and maximise the commercialisation of the State's research investment.  The agency provides hands-on support, promotes awareness of the benefits of innovation in the context of a company's business plan, provides important funding support in the form of grants and equity and promotes awareness of incentives such as the tax incentives that are available.  Foreign direct investment has been hugely important for the Irish economy and job creation over the past 30 years.  Companies supported by IDA Ireland directly employ approximately 139,000 people and have a total impact on the Irish economy of 240,000 jobs.  They account for over 75% of total Irish exports, worth some €110 billion, including goods and services.  The companies in question contribute over €19 billion to the economy. Ireland's strengthened national research ecosystem has enhanced IDA Ireland's capacity to attract increased levels of high value research and development projects.  Investment in research, development and innovation continues to play a strategic role as part of Ireland's foreign direct investment landscape.  It is a question of embedding existing employment and setting the ground work for further job creation.  The work of the enterprise agencies is underpinned by the investments being made under the programme for research in third level institutions.  These investments are aimed at strengthening national research capabilities in human and physical infrastructure.  The programme has supported the development of research centres and facilities that underpin key national priorities and individual institutional strategic missions.  It has enabled the establishment of national networks and consortia. As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, my immediate focus is on three key areas.  I am supporting the research and development and innovation agendas and shaping them as a strong domestic engine of growth.  I am prioritising public investment in research, development and innovation in a way that will allow us to get the biggest return on our investment in terms of jobs, intellectual property and leveraging of investment from enterprise.  I am ensuring our emerging workforce learns science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills — the so-called STEM agenda — at second level, goes on to qualify in these disciplines at third and fourth levels and applies those sought after skills in working life. I wish to speak about the strategic direction for science, technology and innovation.  Ireland must develop a high productivity and high innovation economy.  The guiding principle underpinning this overall objective is that the quality of our human capital in research and innovation is a key engine in accelerating Ireland's economic recovery and helping us back on the path of sustainable growth.  In the past decade, we have trebled the level of investment in research and development, underpinned enterprise demand for it and invested in human capital, physical infrastructure and the commercialisation of research.  This public investment is leveraging twice its value from business investment.  It has contributed significantly to an increase in foreign direct investment, the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and the creation and application of new knowledge and technologies. If we are to grow an innovation system to build national competitive advantage, we will need to support and embed innovation across the economy and facilitate the commercialisation of research.  We are taking action to achieve this.  We are leading and co-ordinating a whole of Government approach to investment in science, technology and innovation, as underpinned by the 2006 strategy for science, technology and innovation, the 2010 report of the innovation task force and the programme for Government that will apply from 2011 to 2016.  This will soon be informed and steered by the recommendations of the research prioritisation steering group.  This distinguished group of people from academia and enterprise was constituted under the eminent chairmanship of Mr. Jim O'Hara to advise the Government on the most strategic make-up of public investment in science, technology and innovation.  We are continuing to build world-class human capital in scientific research in Ireland and develop and sustain Ireland as a location of choice for researchers and firms seeking to conduct world-class scientific research.  Through Enterprise Ireland, we are working to enhance the capacity of indigenous enterprise to develop innovative products and services for competitive advantage by building research and development capacity within companies, linkages with the third level research base and commercialisation support. We are continuing to attract high quality foreign direct investment, FDI, projects to Ireland and more firmly embed existing FDI companies in the economy.  For example, one of our foremost CSETs — centres for science, engineering and technology —  is CRANN, the Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices, which includes Hewlett Packard, Intel and Boston Scientific as research partners.  Members will know this is housed within the footprint of Trinity College. We are promoting and supporting research collaborations for the competitive advantage of the island of Ireland through linking the research system to centres of excellence and fostering partnerships through involvement in EU and other international collaborative research programmes.  An example of this can be seen in the EU joint programme on neurodegenerative disease research, focusing on diseases such Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  The Health Research Board and Science Foundation Ireland are working to lead effective Irish participation in this new EU research and development initiative between 23 EU member states.  The programme aims to develop a European strategy to co-ordinate national efforts in neurodegenerative research across the biomedical, clinical and social spectra.  It is also proposing innovative ways of pooling expertise and resources to address the fragmentation and duplication of current research efforts.  The Health Research Board and Science Foundation Ireland are also leading the development of an Irish strategic research agenda in this area which will identify a common national vision on how to address the enormous social challenge of neurodegenerative diseases. We are developing our intellectual property policy, legislation and procedures to meet our national requirements and international obligations, support enterprise and influence the outcome of international intellectual property initiatives in the best interests of Ireland.  A key initiative in this regard is the development of an intellectual property protocol, the objective of which is to establish clear, straightforward ground rules around ownership of and access to all State-supported intellectual property, with a view to supporting commercial exploitation of the results of publicly funded research.  Clarity and certainty with regard to intellectual property can be another plus in choosing Ireland as a place to do business.  Work is well under way on this initiative and we should see the results very soon. Utilising my cross-governmental role, I am pursuing a suite of measures across the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to enhance science and maths literacy and to upskill our emerging workforce for the skills needs of the future.  Key to our future success as a nation and an economy will be a sustained focusing on company capabilities in research, innovation and technology, and linking enterprise with research institutions and each other to deliver innovative market-led products.  Leadership, management and market skills are critical requirements, along with ongoing competitiveness and productivity gains, to successfully and profitably export our goods and services.  For our indigenous companies, this requires a mix of equity and grant investment, together with underpinning angel, seed and venture capital funds, all of which Enterprise Ireland is providing on a tailored case-by-case basis. Ireland's national recovery plan 2011-14, as endorsed by the European Commission and the IMF, takes account of the fact that strategic science, technology and innovation, STI, investment is one of the Government's infrastructure investment priorities.  In order to realise the return on investment in this area, issues we are addressing include start-up risk, embedding innovation across the economy, the need for collaboration between industry and research providers and the need to bring the outputs of research and innovation activity to the marketplace.  The role of research and development and innovation has evolved to enable it to become a key driver of business success.  In the past decade, since the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland and the initiation of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, there has been a transformational change in Ireland's research landscape and the interactions between academia and industry.  We have developed a truly credible scientific base with top-class research facilities and world-class researchers.  In addition, with the maturing of SFI and other agency research investments, there has been a commensurate increase in the level of pre-commercial outputs from research investments, including patents, licences and spin-outs. I have mentioned that the Government's objective is to maintain world-class research in Ireland, that is, the so-called excellence model which has been built up in the past decade to sustain Ireland as a location of choice for researchers and firms seeking to conduct world-class research, development and innovation.  Science Foundation Ireland investments are based on the rationale that the long-term competitiveness of enterprise requires national excellence in research allied with enterprise needs.  Ireland has moved from Third World status into the world's top 20 countries, based on the quality of research output.  While SFI supports more than 2,500 research positions directly, much more important is the indirect job support provided by it.  The SFI research community interacts with 534 companies, the majority of which are IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland clients based in Ireland which employ more than 90,000 people.  Another substantial part of the value of the SFI investment is in attracting new foreign direct investment previously beyond Ireland's reach and in underpinning existing jobs with world-rated research. SFI is focused on strengthening connections between researchers and industry through its centres for science, engineering and technology, the so-called CSETs, as well as strategic research clusters, SRCs.  CSETs or SRCs or both help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial energy research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies and grow partnerships with industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy.  SFI supports nine such CSETs and 19 strategic research clusters.  In addition, it is the Government's intention to extend the remit of SFI to enable it to bring the research it funds closer to market and ensure SFI investments continue to drive Ireland's long-term strategic, economic and competitive development.  The legislative heads to give effect to this are well advanced. The Government also will oversee successful completion of the investments in PRTLI-funded projects which through cycle 5 will see a ramping up of a significant number of physical and human capital investments in areas of strategic need.  Only yesterday I announced funding of €4.3 million for the clinical and translational research scholars programme, an exciting PhD programme developed by the partner institutes of Molecular Medicine Ireland to prepare science graduates for jobs in Ireland's knowledge economy.  The programme will deliver more scientists in Ireland who will undertake innovative patient and disease-focused research and then, crucially, bring their findings from the bench to the clinic for the ultimate benefit of the population's health.  This is further tangible evidence of how Ireland's higher education sector, in developing such a programme, is delivering for Ireland's enterprise needs. Another key objective is to ensure continued growth in the capacity of Irish companies to develop innovative and cutting edge products, processes and services in order that both domestic activity and exports can grow with a consequence of creating wealth and increasing jobs in Ireland.  This will be achieved by focusing on developing company capability in research, innovation and technology, by linking research-providing organisations with industry for the benefit of the latter, and transforming the outputs of research into commercial activity. Building on the investment in infrastructure, and human and intellectual capital, a number of strategic programmes are run by Enterprise Ireland with a view to commercialising research and development, exploiting market opportunities and driving innovation.  These include transforming research and development activity in enterprise.  This research and development initiative supports the significant building-up of a company's in-house research and development capabilities and infrastructure in the context of a development plan by the company for growing the business.  This activity is tailored to achieve a well targeted output, taking into account the economic and market context in which companies operate. Regarding the high potential start-up scheme, the provision of strong supports for start-up companies and entrepreneurs primarily through equity investment instruments, will help to secure a source of future employment and will ensure that Enterprise Ireland's client companies are in a strong position when markets begin to recover.  This activity is targeted for priority funding under the current budget projections to increase output to 100 HPSUs per annum by 2013. Regarding industry collaboration with the third level sector, technology centres and industry-led networks, the objective is to achieve competitive advantage for industry in Ireland through world-class collaborative research.  The centres are industry-led and carry out market-focused strategic research and development by translating advanced research into technology capable of commercialisation.  It is planned to expand the number of technology centres to 16 by 2015 under the existing budget projections. Regarding the commercialisation of research through Enterprise Ireland, the commercialisation fund activities support academic researchers to undertake commercial, output-driven research and to bring that research to a point where it can be transferred into industry.  The technology transfer system, supported by Enterprise Ireland, captures, identifies and protects intellectual property throughout the third level system. I have mentioned the importance of foreign direct investment in job creation in the past 30 years and IDA Ireland's role in that regard.  IDA Ireland-supported FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the economy through its contribution to Exchequer finances, exports, and research and development.  It generates more than 50% of corporation tax, which was €2.9 billion in 2009.  It generates more than 70% of national exports, representing €110 billion in 2009.  Some 73% of business research and development spend comes from the FDI sector.  It contributes 30% of Irish gross value-added expenditure of €19 billion in the economy. IDA Ireland leverages significant investment in science, technology and innovation.  In 2010 IDA Ireland won 37 high value research, development and innovation projects for Ireland with more than €500 million in new research, development and innovation investment. In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, published in 2010, IDA Ireland has set specific targets for job creation for the period 2010 to 2014, including 105,000 new jobs and 640 investments; 50% of investments located outside Dublin and Cork city; 20% of greenfield investments originating from emerging markets by 2014; and an annual client spend of €1.7 billion in research, development and innovation by 2014. IDA Ireland will focus on winning new investments, in particular in sectors such as life sciences which include pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical devices, ICT and financial services. Our aim is that a growing proportion of FDI will come from high growth markets new to Ireland — India, China, Russia and Brazil.  FDI will also come increasingly from early stage companies, which IDA can help attract to Ireland in part because so many established leading multinationals are already here.  Research, development and innovation play their strategic role as part of Ireland's FDI landscape, embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment. To address the need to maintain jobs in Ireland, IDA Ireland is actively encouraging its clients to strongly engage in transformation initiatives, and is assisting them in programmes to improve company-wide competitiveness, enhance the use of new technologies and grow the skills of the business. In the context of this forward looking agenda and in line with a commitment in the programme for Government, my Department is considering the possibilities around developing Ireland as a location for global intellectual property management, licensing and IP trading services.  The objective would be to provide high quality, high added-value jobs in specialised niche areas which have a demand for dedicated legal and financial instruments and a range of ancillary services.  We are tendering for a feasibility study to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in intellectual property. I will now deal with the issue of prioritising public investment in STI to maximise return on investment.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we get the maximum return on public investment in science, technology and innovation.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, together with Forfás, is leading a whole of Government research prioritisation initiative to identify areas of opportunity with the greatest potential to deliver economic return, with a view to the Government prioritising public investment in science, technology and innovation to support the realisation of opportunities in those areas. We are expecting a final report on this issue soon from the steering group under the chairmanship of Mr. Jim O'Hara.  There may be a shift of emphasis towards realising more economic outputs for that prioritisation exercise.  In addition, there is a strong sense that one must not compromise the educational value of basic research.  There is a strong need for a balance between basic research, applied research and the necessity to commercialise outputs.  The strategic development of research centres across the system will be informed by the research prioritisation findings. I mentioned one other priority to which I would now like to return, that is, ensuring that graduates in science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, have the relevant skills that are applicable in the current employment market.  This is an issue which cuts across the two Departments in which I serve and both Departments are very engaged in initiatives to deliver on that priority. My concern is twofold: first, to deliver quality jobs to our emerging workforce; and, second, to deliver qualified and quality personnel to take up jobs emerging in foreign direct investment enterprise and indigenous Irish enterprise.  We are also pursuing the provision of highly skilled employment by repositioning Irish enterprise higher up the value chain. The higher education system has been successful in producing science graduates for the labour market.  The latest OECD data show that graduation rates for science graduates are higher, on average, in Ireland compared to other countries.  Unfortunately, higher education has not been as successful with engineering as a result of lower student demand for these courses.  However, there has been an increased demand for STEM courses in recent years.  Although the overall number of applicants through the CAO has remained stable since 2010, there has been a significant redistribution of first preferences with science courses experiencing almost a 6% increase in first preference applications and a small increase in first preference applicants for engineering and technology courses. Data for new entrants from the Higher Education Authority show that between 2007-08 and 2010-11 there has been a 37% increase in the number of new entrants entering science, maths and technology courses at all levels of undergraduate higher education.  This points positively to a continuation of the upwards trend in recent years of acceptances on to STEM courses, particularly at honours degree level. In 2010-11, some 28% of all new entrants to higher education institutions were enrolled in courses in the science, maths and technology areas.  Building on this increased capacity in mainstream provision, a targeted approach is being taken to bridge the short-term skills gap in ICT graduates identified by the expert group on future skills needs in addition to addressing longer-term pipeline issues. The emerging action plan on ICT skills provides a good model of collaboration between agencies for the alignment of education programmes with the skills needs of the economy. The action plan, a multi-level and multi-sectoral plan, aims to boost the supply of ICT skills in the short term through an increase in conversion and upskilling opportunities, and to boost the long-term supply of ICT graduates.  These aims are complemented by initiatives to improve the mathematical proficiency of new entrants to higher education, as well as by measures to ensure the responsiveness of the higher education sector to the changing skills needs of industry.  The action plan also seeks to maximise the uptake of ICT programmes offered through the Springboard initiative and of work placement opportunities offered through the national internship scheme. The promotion of science awareness and careers in science is crucial if we are to be guaranteed a steady pipeline of young people who choose to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, disciplines.  This will be vital if we are to become a true knowledge economy.  The Discover Science and Engineering programme, which is administered by Forfás on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, promotes an awareness and understanding of the importance of STEM in a modern knowledge-based economy.  Its raison d’être is to develop more effective ways of engaging students, teachers and the public in science, technology and innovation, thereby contributing to Ireland’s growth and development as a knowledge-based economy, helping to keep Ireland among the world’s most competitive economies. Discover Science and Engineering runs a range of flexible initiatives at first and second levels, for both pupils and teachers, and it has a particular value as a change agent.  It can initiate and try out programmes and activities with a view to wider application where the results would warrant that.  Its overall objectives are to increase the numbers of students studying the physical sciences, to promote a positive attitude to careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and to foster a greater understanding of science and its value to Irish society. The current renewed focus on job creation is particularly relevant to Discover Science and Engineering and its remit as it is designed to enable more Irish students have the necessary skills to participate in the knowledge society.  Many areas of the enterprise economy, including the pharmaceutical, medical devices and ICT sectors, are still suffering from a shortage of key skills despite economic recession.  The flexible programmes of Discover Science and Engineering are designed to meet this demand in the medium term by enthusing young people at primary and second level with the career opportunities available in the enterprise economy and achieved through the study of the physical sciences.  In addition to inculcating an entrepreneurial mindset among second level students, there is a concerted effort to support and encourage a broader interest in careers underpinned by STEM qualifications and capacities. Senators will be aware of two key initiatives taken recently as part of the ongoing campaign to encourage young people to develop an interest in mathematics and in careers where a high level of competence in mathematics is required.  First, a major reform programme, the so-called project maths initiative, is under way and was rolled out to all second level schools in September 2010.  Results from the 2011 junior certificate show that those who took project maths fared better in their examination results in mathematics.  Although it is very early in terms of the roll-out of project maths, these results are very encouraging and we are firmly committed to mainstreaming the approach in all schools. Second, to encourage more students to study leaving certificate higher level mathematics, bonus points will be awarded for leaving certificate mathematics from the summer of 2012 for entry to higher education institutes.  In addition, the programme for Government contains commitments to reform mathematics and science teaching at second level to make science a compulsory junior certificate subject by 2014 and to prioritise professional development for mathematics and science teachers. Senators will be aware of recent comments regarding the global ranking of Irish universities.  It is worth noting that while some higher education systems have invested heavily in elite institutions and adopted a policy of differentiated support for different tiers of institutions, our focus is on sustaining and advancing performance throughout the system.  In this regard, we can draw encouragement from the overall performance of the Irish system in the latest Times Higher Education system performance tables which place Ireland firmly in the world's top 20.  We are ranked 17th overall and sixth in the world relative to GDP. I sincerely thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators for giving me the opportunity to discuss this topic.  I hope Senators will be reassured by the Government's commitment to the science, technology and innovation agenda.  My sense is that it transcends party political boundaries, that it is one in which successive Governments, no matter their hue, have realised the potential, and that it will form the bedrock of our economic recovery.  We must ensure there is collaboration among public representatives, including Senators, Deputies and Ministers.  I am keen to ensure I hear from Senators on any views they have on this agenda to allow us to make it world class, as we are ambitious in our aims.
11710	SeanSherlock	Labour	14188.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	254	 I will meander through the contributions in no particular order.  I will start with Senator Thomas Byrne.  I am supposing he has not read the qualitative criteria laid down by the The Times Higher Education review in how it quantifies university rankings.
11711	SeanSherlock	Labour	14188.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	256	 Senator Barrett hit the nail on the head in regard to the rankings.  Nobody in the Government is committing himself or herself to mediocrity.  We must be honest about these things and the ECF has had a bearing on the pupil-teacher ratios and that has had a bearing on the quantitative criteria laid down in regard to rankings and hence the headlines. I take the point Senator Barrett made in regard to the scientific agenda.  I do not believe we are swallowing hook, line and sinker everything said to us by the agencies.  That is not the case.  I assure the Senator that we are critically assessing everything that is coming across our desks because it is not a case of continuing on as before. I recognised and acknowledged the role of previous Governments in regard to the science, technology and innovation agenda because it is dominated and informed by industry, academia and by previous Governments.  While I would not go as far as following the McCarthy report, because I contend that it too had its own agenda, there is a sense that we must critically assess everything coming across our desks.  That is why we brought in somebody like Jim O'Hara on the research prioritisation exercise because the clear emphasis of that exercise will be towards gaining more economic outputs.  That will run parallel with the legislation underpinning Science Foundation Ireland whereby one can extend the remit towards more applied research and the economic agenda we want to fulfil.  I agree that we need to slaughter some sacred cows within academia.  Certain institutions are able to attract massive amounts of money and issues arise in terms of the duplication of research.  We have to grapple with these issues in the forthcoming period, but my starting point will be the research prioritisation exercise.  I want to ensure we gain access to the metrics arising from this.  A process is under way within the Department in extrapolating information from various agencies, including SFI, the research councils and Enterprise Ireland.  This will also form part of the expenditure review of these agencies' budgets.  We will hear more about this at budget time. I assure those Senators who expressed criticisms of the policy that we are mindful of the issues arising, although I continue to believe we need a strong base for basic and applied research.  If we lose that base, we will compromise our ability to attract foreign direct investment.  A significant number of existing jobs are underpinned by increasing collaboration across industry and between industry and academia, which is a positive development. Senator Clune referred to the economic outputs which are our current focus.  We can no longer sustain a position where people make calls for proposals within the research community in the absence of at least some qualitative criteria to ensure there are outputs for the research.  We are conscious of the need to ensure value for money. On Senator Barrett's point, I share the instinctive view that the entities could be further consolidated.  Perhaps that reflects the opinion of an agnostic; like the good Senator, I also have an economics background.  One thinks in a certain way about the possibility of slaughtering some of the sacred cows within our hallowed institutions.  That would be an easy thing to do, but I am not sure if it would achieve much.  I am often told that Stanford University has the same number of undergraduates as the island of Ireland, although I am not sure if that is true.  My instinct suggests we should be striving towards the centres of excellence to which Senator Byrne referred.  The question arises as to whether a Government could force the consolidation of entities, but there is far greater collaboration between entities on research and innovation than heretofore.  There is also closer collaboration between the universities and the institutes of technology than I have seen previously.  This is a welcome development.  One gets from institutes such as CRANN and the Tyndall Institute a strong sense of collaboration with industry in order to achieve outputs.  Theirs is output focused and results driven research.  Cork Institute of Technology and the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group in Waterford are also using their funding to collaborate with industry in achieving the necessary economic outputs. On the issue of broadband in schools, there is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Education and Skills.  However, the question arises whether it is necessary for every school to have 100 MB.  I do not believe it is.  We have sufficient capacity to provide between 10 MB and 15 MB and if schools need greater bandwidth, they can draw from this resource.  The issue is being discussed and the two Ministers are aware of the need to address this agenda.

As I said, there are no proposals to downgrade the hospital.  It is important for the Senator not to be disingenuous when dealing with this issue.  More than anybody else, he should know that no new money is available.  When his party was in government, it brought this country to the brink of ruin.  No new money is available.  It has been perfectly clear that hospitals have to live within the budgets that have been set for them.  The old system, whereby hospitals and other aspects of the health service sought supplementary budgets towards the end of the year, is simply not on at this point because there is no spare money.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has made it very clear that hospitals must live within their budgets.  They must provide the range and quantity of services they are contracted to provide.  That is what is expected of Connolly Hospital.  That is the situation.  We are committed to the future of the hospital.  We are committed to ensuring there is no downgrading of the hospital.  At the same time, it must be clear to it that it is expected to live within the budgets it has agreed to live within.

11721	SeanSherlock	Labour	14203.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	137	 I thank the Senator for bringing this project to my attention.  Literacy and numeracy are among the most important life skills taught in schools.  We are determined that no child should leave school without having mastered these skills to the best of his or her abilities.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, launched the national literacy strategy on 8 July last.  Ensuring that all young people achieve high standards of literacy and numeracy is one of the key aims of the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister. The key to the success of the literacy and numeracy strategy will be the engagement of the whole community in ensuring that the strategy is fully implemented.  Developing literacy and numeracy is not the business of schools alone, and families and communities also play a key role by setting high expectations, providing good role models for learners and providing every opportunity for children and young people to become more proficient in literacy and numeracy.  The literacy and numeracy strategy acknowledges the important role that libraries can play in supporting communities, families and young learners to develop better literacy.  Libraries and librarians are an important resource in supporting children's literacy and public library services have been to the fore in promoting reading over many years.  Public libraries enable families to support their children's literacy development through the range of resources and information they make available in a free, open and informal setting.  Whereas libraries are an excellent resource for all families, they can be of particular assistance to families who find it difficult to meet the cost of providing a rich range of books and educational resources in the home. The project referred to by the Senator, based in the Oranmore branch of County Galway library service to support children in developing their reading skills, is a very fine example of what we have in mind in the literacy strategy.  We compliment the Senator on the leadership and commitment to voluntary effort that she has shown in initiating this project, in organising the participation of children in the workshop and in building fruitful co-operation with the library service.  From what I know of the project, it is an example of a public library putting its resources at the disposal of young learners to give them an opportunity to learn to read and to love to read.  I wholeheartedly compliment the library service on its involvement in this initiative and also the young teachers who are voluntarily giving their time to support the project. I fully support community-based intervention projects that support literacy and numeracy.  The project gives children the opportunity to select books with expert guidance from professional librarians and the children are assisted in learning to read the books with professional guidance from teachers.  I am delighted to hear from the Senator that she believes it is successful and the Minister has asked the inspectorate of the Department to visit the project in order to provide a detailed report for me on how it works, the profile of children who are involved, the activities organised and the impact that the project is having on children's learning and reading habits. In the brief time left I should clarify that any accreditation with regard to teaching practice for trainee teachers is a matter for the Teaching Council.  I take on board the Senator's comments regarding lateral thinking being applied to the project, which is to be welcomed.  I contend that if there is a visit by the senior inspectorate, we would proceed from there as such engagement is positive.  It is important to note that the conditions for registration as a teacher are a matter for the Teaching Council, not necessarily the Minister.  The supervisory role relating to teachers in training would be deemed a matter for a school principal. That is not a negative reply but rather a suggestion that the Senator could have engagement arising from the impending visit by the inspector.  More lateral thinking should also be applied.  I wish the Senator well in the endeavour and we should support it in so far as we are able, although we should be mindful of some of the constraints the Department may be under because of its competence and that of the Teaching Council with initiatives such as this.

11725	SeanSherlock	Labour	14217.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	302	 Access to certain social insurance payments, which are based on PRSI contributions, differ between employees and the self-employed.  While employees and the self-employed are liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of employees, bringing the PRSI payment in respect of employees to a combined 14.75% rate per employee under the full class A rate.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits based on the higher level of contribution.  Class S self-employed contributions provide cover for long-term benefits, such as the State contributory pension, widow's or widower's pension or surviving civil partner's contributory pension. I am keenly aware of the very difficult financial position self-employed people are now in.  We have all heard cases in our clinics and advice centres, in particular small business owners who find themselves in a very precarious financial position.  However, we have to strike a balance between contributions made and benefits received.  PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within the social insurance context, such as this, is common in other European social protection systems.  In this context, it should be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared with employees.  The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found it favours the self-employed over the employed when employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person. For example, a male married self-employed contributor earning gross average industrial wages had a value for money index of 10.3 compared with an index of 3.1 for an equivalent employee.  In basic terms this means that, with regard to benefits, the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over ten times what he or she contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who, even with access to a broader range of benefits, only gets three times what he or she and his or her employer contributes. The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can gain substantially more from the fund than employees.  It should be noted that the State contributory pension increased in excess of inflation and earnings growth in the period up to 2010 while annuities offer CPI linked increases at best.  The market cost of an inflation linked annuity with €12,000 a year in initial benefits is in excess of €300,000, without any associated survivor's benefits. Any changes to the PRSI system in order to provide access to short-term benefits such as social insurance illness-related benefits would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, established the advisory group on tax and social welfare earlier this year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.  It will examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether it is technically feasible and financially sustainable.

The State has to be mindful of the cost of implementing such a scheme, in terms of deriving short-term benefits.  I take the point made on the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  I will refer the matter to the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I respectfully suggest the Senator engage with the Minister. The Senator referred to a specific case in her constituency.

11728	SeanSherlock	Labour	14217.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-09 00:00:00	Prelude	308	 I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The national strategy for higher education to 2030, otherwise known as the Hunt report, lays out a clear possible development pathway for amalgamated institutes of technology, which meet specified performance criteria, to seek redesignation as technological universities. A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape. Following publication of the higher education strategy, the Department commissioned input from an international expert, familiar with the Irish higher education sector, on the detailed performance criteria against which any future applications for redesignation as a technological university would be assessed.  In its statutory advisory capacity, the Minister then asked the Higher Education Authority for its formal advice on final appropriate performance criteria.  A consultation process on draft criteria has been undertaken by the HEA and it is understood that the HEA hopes to sign off its formal advice to the Minister at a meeting of the authority later this month.  Following consideration of this, the Minister aims to be in a position to publish the designation criteria and the process arrangements before the end of December. The establishment of a technological university will also require legislation and this will be advanced as part of the overall work programme for implementation of the higher education strategy.  However, the first step is to provide clarity on the performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  It is important to repeat that it has to be done in an informed and balanced way.  It would not be right to designate a particular structure as a technological university at this stage, it must go through a proper academic and formal consultation process while retaining the need to ensure the commitment is maintained. Any decision must be made on the basis of sound academic and performance-related criteria.  The first step is to provide clarity on those performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  Once a process is in place, it will be open to institutes of technology to come together to make applications for consideration for redesignation.  That is an eminently sensible approach.  All applications, including any involving Waterford Institute of Technology, will be considered under an independent assessment process.  This is a necessary prerequisite of upholding the quality and international reputation of the higher education system. There is a clear understanding, on a cross-party political basis, of the need to ensure there is balanced regional development, as referred to by Senator Cullinane.  I acknowledged during a recent visit to Waterford Institute of Technology, including the TSSG centre, that world-class research is being carried out there.  It is an exceptional entity of which people in the Waterford region can be very proud.  The capability and capacity are there, but we must go through a process.  Moreover, it must be a logical and informed process rather than a knee-jerk reaction which could create an entity that is not self-sustaining.  We must ensure that whatever is created can sustain itself and compete with other institutions.  We should also take into account that there are as many students on the campus of Stanford University in California as there are in third level institutions throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  We must think relatively and be careful of how we proceed.

11735	SeanSherlock	Labour	14287.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-18 00:00:00	Prelude	114	 I am pleased to bring before the Seanad for its consideration the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011,  the main purpose of which is to make the necessary changes to the Patents Act 1992 to provide for the ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement.  The London Agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, is aimed at reducing the cost of the European patent process to applicants by reducing the requirement to file translations of the granted patents under the European Patent Convention. Before considering the provisions of the Bill, I wish to set out the background to it.  It is clear Ireland's international competitiveness increasingly depends on marketable high-value goods and services which have strong knowledge content.  In spite of the challenging economic environment, approximately 50% of all enterprises in Ireland continue to engage in significant research and development activities.  A recent report shows that enterprises across all business sectors spent almost €1.8 billion on research and development activities in 2010 and to convert that investment into economic growth Ireland needs an effective patent system. It is incumbent on the Government to provide the very best framework for these resulting innovations to be captured and exploited in a manner that will create high-value employment.  Any unnecessary legal or administrative barrier in the intellectual property framework that limits access owing to high translation costs or other factors will not serve its purpose.  Providing efficient and affordable access to registering patents is vital to stimulating innovation in Irish enterprises, universities and research institutions.  The high cost of obligatory translations of granted European patents acts as a deterrent to filing patents and, as a consequence, to innovation.  By lowering the current cost barriers to entry and enhancing SME access to the patent system, the London Agreement represents a significant step forward for the European patent system. As for the London Agreement, the European Patent Office, established by the European Patent Organisation, is an intergovernmental institution comprising 38 European states, including the 27 EU member states.  The office examines patent applications and grants a European patent, should the relevant conditions be met.  Patent applications originating in Ireland and granted by the European Patent Office have been increasing steadily, underlining the importance to the Irish research sector, both public and private, of European patent protection.  Since 2004, the number of Irish patent applications to the European Patent Office has risen by48%, with grants of European patents to Irish applicants increasing by 34%.  However, the patent process at European level is both complex and expensive, acting as a disincentive to innovation, especially for young innovative start-ups with limited resources.  An enterprise endeavouring to protect its innovation throughout Europe will apply to the European Patent Office for a patent.  At this stage, applicants can file their application in English, French or German, thus saving on translation costs at this early stage.  The claim which sets out the limits of the monopoly granted is published in the three languages upon grant. Once granted, the European patent is, in effect, a bundle of national patents and the proprietor must validate or file the patent in each state in which patent protection is required.  In order to validate a European patent in a country, a full translation of the patent must be lodged in each country designated in the national language of that country.  These translation costs make up a large proportion of the costs of acquiring a European patent and constitute a cost enterprises can scarcely afford at a vital stage of expensive product development.  This process ensures the European patent is uncompetitive when compared with the cost of acquiring US or Japanese patents.  Under the current system, a European patent validated in 13 European countries is approximately ten times more expensive than a US patent and 13 times more costly than a Japanese patent.  The key cost difference is the processing and translation costs involved with a European patent.  In this context, validating a patent in 27 European countries can cost up to €32,000, of which €23,000 alone is for translations.  Approximately 75% of the cost differential between the granting of a European and US patent is due to translation costs.  It is, therefore, right and proper that this cost, which is functioning as a very real barrier to exploiting innovation in Europe, should be tackled. The publication of the translations takes place very late in the life cycle of a patent.  As these translations are only provided after the patent is granted, they do not serve the purpose of informing the public about new technologies on a timely basis.  It can take up to five years to grant a patent, meaning that any cutting-edge technology described in a patent is usually already in the public domain and rendering the translation, as an information tool, obsolete even before it is completed.  Research has shown that these costs have forced Irish innovators to take a selective, cost-effective approach when designating states for patent protection.  This leaves patents vulnerable in those states where innovators simply cannot afford to validate them. The advantages arising from implementation of the London Agreement, quite apart from the direct translation costs, can also have a positive effect on research and development and can enable scarce financial resources currently spent on translations to be reallocated to research and development and other business activities.  The London Agreement is now in force in 17 of the 38 member states of the European Patent Organisation, including, importantly, major Irish trading markets such as the UK, France and Germany.  Ireland hopes to join that number shortly and, in doing so, wishes to encourage other states to follow in order to further reduce costs for Irish patent holders registering their innovations throughout Europe.  The overall aim of the London Agreement is to reduce the cost of translations across the 38 member states by approximately 50%.  To reach this level of reduction, it is vital that all contracting states to the European Patent Convention become party to the agreement. I wish to outline how the London Agreement works in practice.  Article 65 of the European Patent Convention provides that any contracting state may require a translation of the full text of a European patent into one of its languages, if that language is different from the language in which the patent is granted.  Under the London Agreement, countries will, either partly or wholly, waive the requirement for translations of European patents to be filed in their national language.  This means that under the agreement, a member state with English, French or German as an official language will dispense with translation requirements entirely in order to for the European patent to come into effect.  Ireland, with English as an official language, will no longer require a translation into English of the detailed specification of European patents drawn up in French or German. In accordance with best practice and to assess the implications for Irish inventors and businesses, my Department carried out a regulatory impact assessment in respect of the London Agreement in 2009.  This established that the main advantage of the agreement for Irish inventors seeking patent protection abroad is that it would no longer be necessary for them to furnish translations to the extent currently required in those countries which are party to the agreement.  This would lead to significant savings when filing a European patent in other non-English language European states.  There would be a significant reduction not only in translation costs but in the context of publication and patent attorney fees.  The impact assessment also highlighted that in 2007 Ireland was the origin for some 126 European patents that were granted.  The cost of designating these patents in 28 states was estimated at €6 million.  If the significant impact of additional publication and patent attorney fees are added, this represents a considerable cost to Irish industry. To bring Irish law into line with the London Agreement, it is necessary to amend our primary legislation.  The core of Irish patent law is the Patents Act 1992, which is designed to meet our national needs and international obligations.  We continue to amend this primary Act to ensure that the patent legislative framework remains robust and fit for purpose.  The Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 is a short but very important item of legislation which amends three sections of the Patents Act 1992 to allow for the forthcoming ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement.  The other two sections provide standard provisions for legislation. Section 2 amends the provisions of section 119 of the Patents Act 1992.  These changes relate to the translation requirements for official language translations.  It is necessary to delete section 119(6) to ensure that a translation in English of a European patent specification no longer needs to be filed in the Irish Patents Office in order for that patent to have effect in Ireland. Section 3 provides for the repeal of section 119A of the 1992 Act in its entirety.  Transposing the London Agreement into Irish law means that this section will no longer be necessary or applicable when section 119(6) is deleted.  Section 4 amends section 121(2) of the 1992 Act and deals primarily with what constitutes an authentic text of the patent in cases of dispute. Section 5 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions of the Bill.  The text relating to commencement contained in this section is standard in nature and allows for the legislation to come into operation on a date or dates to be specified in an order or orders.  This provides some ministerial discretion with regard to when the Act will become effective in law.  The purpose of this provision is to allow for any administrative changes which may be required before the Act can commence.  In this instance, it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them into line with the London Agreement.  The proposed amendments to the patent rules of 1992 are being drafted at present, in consultation with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. It is my intention to commence the Act and the new patents (amendment) rules 2012 by way of an order as close to the enactment of this Bill as possible.  The legislation, as published, was the subject of one minor amendment in the Dáil in respect of section 5.  That amendment altered the title of the Minister following on from the change of name of the Department by Statutory Instrument No. 245/2011, which came into effect on 2 June last. The Bill before the House is just one of many steps being taken to reduce the burden of patent costs.  I take this opportunity to update Senators on a separate development at EU level.  We are working with other member states towards finalising legislation for the creation of unitary patent protection that will reduce the cost of registration and enforcement of patents for businesses.  Various proposals for a single EU patent have been under discussion for more than 50 years.  Just prior to Christmas, 25 member states reached political agreement with the European Parliament on regulations for a unitary patent.  This will lead to the introduction of a simpler, cheaper and more robust patent system in the European Union of the type which has eluded it for decades.  When fully implemented, the unitary patent will enable Irish-based holders of patents to seek protection for their patents across the 25 member states supporting unitary patent protection — representing 79% of the territory of the European Union — for a fraction of current costs.  The European Commission estimates that by implementing unitary patent protection, the overall savings to European business could be up to €50 million per annum, even in the early stages.  These cost savings should be of particular benefit to Irish high-tech start-ups and small enterprises.  When fully implemented, a unitary patent will mean large reductions in red tape and costs.  This will stimulate European innovation and make patents more accessible to all companies in the European Union.  I look forward to reporting back to the House when legislation for this unitary patent and its enforcement is finalised. Until an EU unitary patent comes into force, perhaps in 2014, Ireland will continue to improve the patenting process in any way possible.  The Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 builds on our continuing efforts to facilitate Irish-based enterprises and research institutions in their effort to ensure that their innovations are properly protected in as many states as possible and at the lowest cost.  I am confident the House will strongly endorse any initiative which reduces costs for innovation in Ireland in an efficient and inexpensive manner. The enactment of the Patent (Amendments) Bill 2011, followed by our ratification of the London Agreement, will remove the current expensive translation requirements.  In addition, Ireland is likely to be designated in more patent applications, increasing overall patent-related activity here.  It is expected that more inventors and small and medium-sized enterprises, currently deterred from registering patents because of the high costs involved, will be attracted to protecting their intellectual property across Europe.  This will further support Ireland's efforts to generate economic growth through promoting and innovating better processes and products. I commend the Bill to the House.
11736	SeanSherlock	Labour	14287.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-18 00:00:00	Prelude	126	 I thank Senators for their great comments.  A number of issues have been raised, all of which indirectly relate to the legislation but are not pertinent to today's process.  Generally, if the starting point for innovation is Government policy interacting with State agencies, there is a very clear sense of purpose in ensuring we do not rest on our laurels.  The recommendations of the innovation task force are being dealt with in an ongoing process, with one recommendation relating to tax credits.  That was addressed in the recent budget and I will deal with that in further detail. I thank Senators for their considered contributions, which raise issues that must be taken on board by the Government.  A patent is not the only measure of innovation but rather one of a number.  The clear purpose of this legislation is to reduce that burden and put in place a European system, where Ireland will play a part and Irish SMEs and other stakeholders can ensure administrative and legal costs are reduced as a result.  In its complementary policy, the Government is going through a research prioritisation exercise which seeks to build upon between 12 and 14 core themes or areas of research on which we must concentrate in order to interact with the State agencies which Senator Crown spoke of, including Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, academic institutions and multinational companies.  In doing this we try to focus the amount of money spent by the State on research in a way that ensures the basic research requirements and a more applied approach that can drive more economic benefits by creating as many jobs as possible.  Complementary to that is a patents process which ensures that where a citizen, researcher or SME wants to invest in a new patent system, the European system will ensure the burden is not heavy in cost.  The process should be as simple as possible. An interesting point was made by Senator Mooney regarding the young scientists' exhibition.  When two people from a school in Dublin or elsewhere can develop algorithms at such a stage in their lives, we must be bowled over by the depth of their imagination and creativity as well as the ecosystem which supports them through their local school.  Successive governments have been in this apolitical space and no specific party owns it.  As a State we want to ensure the Irish Patents Office — representatives of which attended the exhibition — can provide people with the advice they need.  When I attended its stand at the young scientists' exhibition, there were a phenomenal number of interactions with students. The €32,000 figure is average or indicative but we want to ensure we get to a stage where people like the students in question plug into the idea that there is a process for their innovation which is not cumbersome.  Listening to the radio interviews, the people in question were already plugged into the space of patenting their work.
11737	SeanSherlock	Labour	14287.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-18 00:00:00	Prelude	128	 That culture is changing in students, who are becoming more aware of the potential.  It is not for the State to own all the intellectual property deriving from the research in which it invests.  That is not a good direction to take and we do not want to create a disincentive for individual researchers or companies with an investment in labs, for example.  They should not have to give intellectual property back to the State and we should foster the creation of such intellectual property or patents. The Forfás report compiled for the office of science and technology examined the level of support for research and development across all Departments, indicating that total State support for research and development increased from €756 million in 2005 to €941 million in 2008.  The slowdown in the economy was evident, with a slight decline in 2009, with total expenditure in 2010 of €872 million.  My Department has a 2012 budget which will provide €518 million in capital grants this year, which is an increase on 2011. With regard to promotion of research and development, Science Foundation Ireland has a pivotal role in enhancing Ireland's human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavours relevant to the future competitiveness of Irish industry and enterprise.  That body has up to 3,000 researchers in 28 centres throughout the State, with up to 500 industry collaborations.  They generate intellectual property, although some is generated within the multinational sector through the existing collaborations.  Multinational companies are increasingly coming here not just because of the corporate tax rate but also because of a very highly evolved research and development facility that exists within this country. The research and development tax credit scheme provides for a tax credit of 25% of the incremental expenditure incurred by a company in an accounting period on research and development activities.  That can be off-set against a company's corporation tax liability.  I note the points made by Senator Quinn.  Perhaps we could engage further to see whether there are possibilities in terms of graduates.  The research and development tax scheme was enhanced in budget 2012, as promised in the programme for Government.  A greater proportion of the total spend on research and development is now eligible to be written off by including without restriction the first €100,000 spent for the purposes of availing of the credit.  In addition, businesses that outsourced research and development activities to universities or other institutions will be subject to fewer limits in availing of the tax credit — a measure designed with SMEs in mind.  Companies will also have the option to use a portion of the research and development tax credit to assist in the employment of key employees to drive their research and development agenda. Senator Gilroy made a point on the registration of patents here, in the European Union and in Europe in general.  Irish companies marketing their products strategically choose to apply for a European patent, an international application by means of the Patent Cooperation Treaty or directly to the country to which they want to export.  Increases in the number of filings abroad indicate that export-orientated Irish companies are widening their market reach, expanding into new international markets, opening up new businesses and becoming more competitive and innovative.  Direct European patent filings and international filings under the Patent Cooperative Treaty and by Irish resident companies rose from 667 in 2008 to 687 in 2010, an increase of a meagre 3%, but it is an increase.  Applications for UK patents from Irish-resident companies filed directly to the UK Intellectual Property Office rose from 278 in 2008 to 289 in 2010, an increase of 3.9%.  Applications for US patents filed by Irish resident companies increased from 740 in 2008 to 796 in 2010, an increase of 7.5%.  That trend, where Irish-resident companies are filing directly for US patents, is due to the low cost of acquiring a US patent compared to the European patents system.  I hope that answers the point adequately.

The purpose is that they would be complementary.  By instigating a unitary patents system one would hope to drive down further the cost of implementing patents to reduce the cost of registration further and to benefit from an estimated €50 million in savings.  It is a mechanism by which one would have a wider European scope.  The aim is the same in that it complements the London Agreement.  I hope that clarifies the position.  If it does not I am happy to return to the matter on the next Stage.
11739	SeanSherlock	Labour	14287.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-18 00:00:00	Prelude	132	 Senator Crown summed up the legislation very well when he referred to reducing obstruction, greasing the wheels of innovation and improving society.  That is key to what we are doing.  It is part of that process.  While the legislation is technical it speaks to the attempts by the Government to increase our competitive advantage, ramp up research and development incentives, as we did in the budget, and ensure that we can mine more of the intellectual property within our research facilities and institutions, and to encourage the SME sector to ensure it can get on board as well in terms of beginning to think more laterally about whether it wants to engage in research and development and to provide incentives to that end.  I hope I have addressed the points in general.  If I have not, I am happy to come back to any points that are outstanding on a later stage.
11740	SeanSherlock	Labour	14287.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-18 00:00:00	Prelude	134	 There is some loss of income.  The Senator should forgive me for not responding to the question.  The number of applications for patent protection received in 2010 was 792.  There was a decrease of 18% from 2009.  A total of 243 patents were granted in 2010, a decrease of 26% compared to 2009.  A loss of revenue arises in terms of fees for translations in the context of this country becoming a party to the agreement.  As part of the validation process an applicant must lodge a translation for a patent granted in French or German in the office within six months of grant of patent together with a fee of €35.  In 2010 that came to €33,215.  It is worth noting that the figure has been steadily decreasing.  In 2006 it stood at €62,000.  The crucial point is not necessarily the loss of revenue to the State but the increase in the accessibility of the system to people who are innovating within the system.

11747	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	150	 I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and broad support for the Bill.  The rationale behind it is very sound.  It can end the current financial burden on industry by providing the full translation of the European patent to ensure full protection of the patent across Europe.  There is a strong appreciation in this House that it is vital that Irish business no longer be hampered by a system that is inefficient and costly. I wish to address two issues raised on Second Stage last week, one of which was raised by Senator Mooney.  Concern was expressed that Irish enterprises were losing under the current European patent system as a result of the expense of registering a patent throughout Europe.  I would characterise it more as a loss of opportunity for Irish firms to enter new markets in Europe when patent holders take a selective cost-effective approach to invalidating states for patent protection.  Implementation of the London Agreement will go a considerable way to reducing this barrier, offering Irish enterprises easier access to these markets as a result of being able to protect their intellectual property at a more reasonable cost. I will address an issue raised on Second Stage by Senator Crown last week, namely, a patent cliff for pharmaceutical products.  This is an issue that is well recognised by the pharmaceutical sector based in Ireland and our enterprise agencies.  The strategy for dealing with this includes a greater emphasis on niche markets and markets in rapidly developing economies and a modest but growing generic medicine industry in Ireland.  It is encouraging that the most recent trade figures continue to show strong export growth in medical and pharmaceutical products and the best way to sustain this growth is to maintain the current policy of the IDA of targeting the attraction of research and development activities in the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland. Although the Bill introduces modest changes, I ask Senators to take a note of two important points.  First, as the London Agreement comes into force throughout Europe, Irish-based enterprises and research are saving increased amounts in translation costs.  By ratifying the London Agreement Ireland will become a more attractive location to validate European patents, resulting in greater innovation activity here and income increase for the Irish Patents Office.  Second, this is one element in the continuing process of reforming the patent and overall intellectual property regime in Ireland to ensure it remains fit for purpose and enhance our attractiveness as an international IP hub. The Bill will not come into effect until the corresponding patent rules are amended.  They give the detailed administrative guidance on the application of the Patents Act 1992.  Amendments to these rules will be brought in to effect by means of a statutory instrument signed by the Minister.  With regard to the EU patent, to date, 25 of the 27 member states of the EU have indicated a willingness to partake in such a system.  The Commission envisages that the first unitary patent protection will be issued in 2014.  I hope that adequately addresses the question. I am grateful to the Senators for their comments and contributions on this issue, and also for their insights.  Some very incisive comments were made on Second Stage, to which we must have regard as we proceed with the legislation.  I express my appreciation to the House in that regard.
11748	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	150	 I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss this issue and expressing his concerns about the alignment of local communities and local government. The programme for Government has committed to a review of local governance structures with a view to improving delivery of services to the citizen.  As part of giving effect to this commitment, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, established a high-level steering group last September to discuss enhancing the alignment between local government and the local development sector.  The Minister set out on a course of alignment rather than integration — I assure the Senator in that regard — and I know he is still thinking in those terms. The steering group was given a broad remit to review the roles of local development and local government, to identify the scope for greater synergies between the sectors, and to provide recommendations on how we might deliver simplified, cost-effective and efficient services for the citizen in a way that allows for local oversight and democratic accountability.  The group has consulted extensively with stakeholders in order to receive input from all those involved in the area of local and community development, and I understand this input has proved valuable to the group in its work towards developing recommendations for greater alignment of the sectors.  The steering group presented an interim report to the Minister in early December, outlining some preliminary conclusions vis-à-vis the existing arrangements and the respective roles of local authorities and the local and community development sector in the provision of local and community development services.  The group reaffirmed the need for a more coherent approach to local service provision.  It sees the need for a more central role for local government in planning, decision-making and oversight of local development programmes.  The group also acknowledged the importance of retaining the developmental bottom-up approach to local development, with its focus on targeting those most in need and facilitating meaningful community participation.  It recommended that this valuable approach be embedded as an integral part of the planning and decision-making process for the delivery of services at local level. In the past two decades, certain gaps in service provision at local level have been filled successfully by local development companies.  They now have a proven track record when it comes to supporting local communities.  The Minister is aware that the local development companies have unique strengths, skills and experiences, and he will expect them to continue to play a pivotal role in the implementation of local development actions.  The Minister has an equally strong belief in the central role that local government has in the lives of our communities.  Local government should exercise local leadership.  As part of that, local authorities give coherent and strategic direction to the delivery of community and local development interventions at a local level. A key focus, therefore, of this alignment process is to harness the strengths and experiences of the local government and local development sectors.  This is a great opportunity to bring greater coherence to the provision of services and maximise the benefits for communities, especially when resources are scarce and services are very much needed.  The Minister is confident that local government and local development can work in partnership to deliver efficient, sustainable, joined-up and easy to access services for people locally. The Senator raised the issue of the European Court of Auditors report on the implementation of the Leader approach.  I recognise that it contained a number of recommendations to ensure the values of the Leader approach are retained.  There is a strong record in Ireland with regard to the Leader programme and we will not introduce measures that will damage our standing in this regard.  I am confident that any recommendations the steering group proposes will fully respect the findings in the European Court of Auditors' report and will not breach the Leader requirements with regard to the composition and decision-making process of local action groups as defined in the EU regulations.  I understand the steering group will present its final report to the Minister in the coming weeks.  Its recommendations will inform our plans with regard to the overall local government reform agenda and will be subject to careful consideration in that context.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.
11749	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	232	 I thank Senators Power and Zappone for raising this matter.  As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has said, he extends his apologies that he is unable to be present, therefore I speak on his behalf. Before commenting on Sweden's legislative model which criminalises the purchase of sexual services I  wish to outline the legislative measures in place to tackle the phenomena of human trafficking and organised prostitution.  Ireland has strong legislation to combat the scourge of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 gave effect to Ireland's obligations in various international instruments to criminalise human trafficking.  The trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation, including prostitution, is a criminal offence and those convicted of such trafficking are liable to life imprisonment.  In addition, it is an offence under the legislation for any person to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution. In the case of prostitution legislation, there are a number of offences directly aimed at protecting prostitutes from exploitation.  Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, the solicitation offence in the legislation is targeted at buyers, sellers and third parties, such as pimps.  Buyers as well as sellers are liable to prosecution and the same penalties apply. The 1993 Act, as amended, provides that a person who solicits or importunes a child — whether or not for the purposes of prostitution — to commit an act which would constitute carnal knowledge or sexual assault is guilty of an offence.  Moreover, in addition to being charged with such solicitation, a person who engages in a sexual act with the child could be charged with serious offences under sexual offences legislation.  In these circumstances, consent to the sexual act is not a defence.  Strong as the law is, there is always room for improvement and the law on prostitution is being reviewed with a view to enhancing the protection of vulnerable persons. I should add that the law is being enforced.  An Garda Síochána continually targets the individuals and criminal groups involved in prostitution and related activities.  A number of individuals and criminal groups have been identified, arrested, prosecuted and convicted.  The Garda carries out targeted operations to address crime in regard to prostitution, and these often encompass situations where it is suspected that women and girls have been trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  This includes monitoring of websites associated with the advertising of prostitution, targeting the activities of criminal groups involved in organised prostitution, brothel keeping and money laundering offences.  Given the involvement of organised crime gangs, such operations may be supported by specialist assistance provided by units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. As part of the review I mentioned earlier, the Minister announced in October that he would be arranging a consultation process on the future direction of prostitution legislation.  A detailed discussion document to facilitate the consultation process is being prepared.  It will be appreciated that the discussion document, if it is to fully inform the public, needs to be prepared carefully.  It is expected that the document will be ready in the coming weeks. The Senators have asked for clarification as to whether it is the Government's intention to change Ireland's laws on prostitution to bring them into line with the Swedish approach, as advocated by the Turn off the Red Light coalition.  The Government has not made any decision in this matter.  When the review, including public consultation, is concluded, the Minister will bring any legislative proposals to Government in the normal way. While no decisions have been taken with regard to legislative proposals, it is important to point out, as was already indicated in the Seanad debate last October, that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sex within our legal framework raises complex issues.  A provision in the substantially different constitutional framework of one jurisdiction cannot be simply transposed into another jurisdiction's constitutional and legal framework. The Minister does not wish to appear to be dismissing the Swedish model out of hand.  All options will be considered but it is important to mention that there are issues which require in-depth examination.  The Swedish offence of purchasing sexual services would appear to be a strict liability offence.  There are difficulties in this jurisdiction in establishing offences of strict and absolute liability arising from the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  If the Swedish approach were adopted here, one party only to a two-way transaction between consenting adults would be guilty of an offence.  The buyer only would be culpable and subject to penalty, with all that entails.  The buyer would have no defence in law and the seller would not commit any offence in respect of the receipt of a consideration for sexual services.  Criminalising one party only in this manner, were it not clearly justifiable on objective grounds, could be open to constitutional challenge. There would obviously be concerns too, at criminalising the sale of sex by exploited persons.  In addition to legal concerns, there are different and genuinely held views on this matter.  The Minister does not believe that the introduction of a Swedish style ban could be advanced here without a considered public debate. This is an issue which affects individuals and communities.  It is also a societal issue.  Public debate should be open to the widest possible audience and the Minister wants to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  That is the reason the Minister has decided on a consultation process before charting the way ahead. I would like to thank the Senators for raising this issue today.  The Minister would like to reiterate that everything that can reasonably be done to combat prostitution will be done, and he looks forward to the outcome of the consultation process, which is expected to get under way shortly.
11750	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	235	 We must have due regard to what Senators Power and Zappone are saying.  If such a statement was made in October 2011 and if they justifiably feel that no progress has been made on that issue, then I would like to assure them that I will speak to the Minister and that we need to make haste on it.  I genuinely have regard to the statements that have been made. As this is a cross-bench issue and affects all of us as a society, I hope that the Senators' views would have a major influence in the process and I hope that the Department would take seriously the views that have been expressed here today.  I will talk directly with the Minister and try to move the process along.
11751	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	238	 I am glad that both Senators have raised the issue.  The last point made was about the over-dependence on the construction industry.  That is part of the structural difficulty which exists in many of the regions outside of the larger urban conurbations, where the labour force moved into the construction industry. When the construction industry fell apart, all of a sudden there were massive rates of unemployment.  The south east, in particular, has seen its unemployment rate jump from 4.9% in 2007 — which was marginally above the countrywide average of 4.6% — to 18.2%, compared with a national average of 14.3%.  There is a clear acknowledgement of the difficulties facing the south east.  I will be frank and say that neither of the two Senators have proffered any solutions.  We must acknowledge that State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as local authorities, academic institutions and enterprise boards, will have to be part of a plan to stem that tide of unemployment and reverse the trend. The south-east action plan contains specific actions to address the unemployment problems affecting the south east.  The plan, which is geographically oriented towards that area, was launched more than two months ago, on 2 December.  Its intention is to provide for regular meetings with a forum representing the agencies and local stakeholders to progress its implementation. The structural challenges faced by the south east region have built up over many years and will not be reversed by a simple set of actions.  What is required is to build a stronger local enterprise base in the region as a whole.  The report identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition, but it will only achieve so much.  The Senators will acknowledge that we cannot reverse the unemployment trend overnight.  There will need to be structural changes and investments in key areas in order to stem that tide.  There are challenges for all agencies to build up the region's competitive advantage and then promote it in a co-ordinated manner. One of the key issues that no single agency or Department can hope to address is the issue of the overall coherence of the region's value proposition to investors from home or abroad.  What has arisen again and again in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and agencies in the region is the need for greater co-ordination of effort from all those with an interest in improving the enterprise potential of the region.  This was brought to the fore when the agencies, local authorities, CEBs, educational institutions and other local representative groups met with the Minister on 24 November last.  That meeting was the first time a group of that nature had met with a focus solely on what could be done to improve the region's fortunes, which is worth noting.  We must also bear in mind that the figures quoted by Senator Cullinane are from a time when a different political entity was at the helm.  In all fairness, what this Government has done is to seek to meet the challenges faced by the south east head-on, in partnership with the State agencies.  I understand the Senator will want to score a point off me, as Minister of State, but he should recognise that people across party political boundaries want to work together to stem the tide of unemployment.
11752	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	240	 The Minister intends in the coming year to facilitate a series of further meetings of that same group as a means of monitoring the implementation of the proposals in this report and also to forge greater co-operation and collaboration between the various stakeholders across the region.  I hope Senator Cullinane will get on board with that process.
11753	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	242	 It is not just a matter of identifying a set of metrics from 2007 to 2010.  We need to consider the problem from a qualitative point of view.  We cannot just extrapolate from the rate of investment by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland and say that in monetary terms, the south east has not benefited, because other regions have the same claim, in real terms.  We can say that the larger urban areas such as Cork, Dublin and Galway have a disproportionately high rate of inward investment in the form of IDA projects, but we also need to consider human capital, soft skills and the relationships among stakeholders.  There is now a model, sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to deal with this.  It is not that I am being defensive.  If we are debating an issue, we need to set out the parameters for that debate.  We must have due regard to the fact that all of the stakeholders want to drive this on.  In fairness to all political entities, they also want to drive this on.  If it needs to be critiqued, we are open to that.  However, it is not just a question of investment by the IDA, although that is one aspect of it.  It is a question, also, of ensuring that we can deliver on education.  Senator Cullinane will be aware of my commitment to the Telecommunications Software & Systems Group, TSSG, which is, as far as I am concerned, a beacon for the region.  We need to mine more of that intellectual development and human capital.  Inch by inch, that is what will restore the region so that we have a level playing field.  I have listened to the points that were made.  We are not going to be complacent about this.  We have a job to do.
11754	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	244	 Yes.
11755	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	247	 I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is recognised that international ranking systems are referenced by international investors, employers and students and consequently they cannot be ignored.  However, it should also be noted that these systems are not infallible and it is widely agreed that they should be interpreted with caution.  We can draw encouragement from the overall performance of the Irish system on the latest Times Higher Education system performance tables which place Ireland firmly in the world's top 20.  We are ranked 17th overall and sixth in the world relative to our GDP. The focus in Ireland is on sustaining and advancing performance throughout the system as a whole rather than investing in elite institutions.  Earlier last year the Minister, Deputy Quinn, set out his priorities for the development of the higher education system during the next 20 years and endorsed a range of actions to develop the quality of teaching and learning and to ensure the relevance of programme and curriculum design throughout the system.  These actions are focused on improving the overall student experience and improving the quality and employability of Irish graduates. On 30 January the President of American Chamber of Commerce Ireland joined the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Chairs of the Higher Education Authority, the expert group on future skills needs and ICT Ireland to launch a new action plan to address the high-level ICT skills needs of enterprise in Ireland.  The action plan is available on the Department website.  It was developed in response to a clear message from industry that there are ICT skills shortages and, more important, that jobs can be created if we have the graduates to fill them.  In a highly mobile and global sector such as ICT, inward migration by skilled professionals will always play a key role in meeting the skills needs of companies.  However, boosting the domestic supply of graduates for 21st century jobs is a key objective for the education system. The action plan, published last week, has been developed during the past 12 months with close collaboration between officials of the Department of Education and Skills, the expert group on future skills needs, the HEA, ICT Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  It sets out short-, medium- and long-term actions with specific time-bound targets to meet the skills gap in the short term while, in tandem, building up the longer term supply of high quality graduates.  This includes the establishment of an ambitious target of doubling the annual output of ICT graduates from 1,000 this year to 2,000 by 2018. The skills shortages experienced have not arisen overnight and are not unique to Ireland.  There are no quick-fix solutions that will meet all of the shortages overnight.  However, the plan includes steps that will be taken to increase the supply of graduates within the next 12 months.  The key action in this regard is the immediate roll-out of 750 places on 17 new fully funded graduate skills conversion programmes throughout the country.  These programmes have been developed by public and private higher education providers in collaboration with industry partners.  Participants on the programmes will obtain a post graduate qualification in core computing skills at honours degree level and will be offered a work placement with one of the companies involved in the design of the programmes.  Details of all of the new conversion programmes are available on the BlueBrick.ie web portal.

11756	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	249	 I appreciate the points made by Senator Walsh but I do not believe there is a sense of complacency.  The opposite is the case; there is a great sense of urgency and there are sleepless nights in respect of how we should address this problem.  The bottom line is that one can extrapolate from the Times Higher Education system performance tables.  One can delve into the criteria they apply.  Criteria for measuring rankings differ from one set of rankings to another.  There is no sense of complacency.  The data are important and widely reported and when the reports come in we take them seriously.  In fairness our work and that of previous Governments with American Chamber of Commerce Ireland stands up.  When they send signals across the table we sit up and listen, as have previous Governments; if messages come from them we take note. It is important to realise that there are many Irish people working in US companies who have had long and distinguished careers in those companies.  They are very attuned to their needs as well and they have the ear of Government.  In fairness, traditionally Fianna Fáil Governments have set out this approach and have been a part of the process for the science, technology and innovation programmes.  This is an apolitical area. With regard to the points made by Senator Walsh, there is a strong sense of the urgency in respect of dealing with the skills shortages.  However, the Senator will acknowledge that there was an over-reliance on construction and many children went into construction studies from second level rather than software engineering or other engineering programmes and one cannot turn around that ship overnight.  It is healthy for the system to have world class researchers coming from abroad.  It causes us to up our game.  I appreciate the points made.  There is no sense of complacency; we are moving rapidly to address the deficit.
11757	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	251	 Iarraim ar an Seanadóir mo leithscéal a ghabháil toisc nach bhfuil Gaeilge líofa agam.  B'fhearr liom leanúint i mBéarla, lena thoil. This House is aware that, in the context of budget 2012 and the need for the State to achieve economic independence in the coming years, difficult choices had to be made to achieve savings.  To this end, in 2011 all Departments carried out a comprehensive review of expenditure on all budgets and programmes, and proposals to achieve savings were put to Government.  As one of the largest spending Departments, this was also the case in regard to expenditure on education. In making these difficult decisions, priority was given to protecting resources for front line services as far as possible in the coming years.  For example, the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level has been maintained and the overall number of special needs assistants and resource teachers will be maintained at current levels.  However, savings had to be made, even against a background of the expected increase in the school going population in the coming years.  One such decision was the abolition, for new students, of the grant paid for student teachers' three week placement in Gaeltacht summer colleges.  Currently, satisfactory attendance at an Irish language course in the Gaeltacht is a compulsory element of the primary initial teacher education, ITE, courses. In respect of students in the State-funded colleges of education, the Department pays a grant of €637 per student directly to the Gaeltacht summer colleges per three week course.  This is an annual cost of over €700,000, representing moneys that would have to be found elsewhere within the education budget.  The removal of the grant means students will be liable for the cost. We would all prefer if this choice did not have to be made.  It has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible.  This move brings the primary ITE courses more into line with a number of other types of degree programmes, such as language degrees, where students are required to bear the costs of additional special requirements themselves.  For example, there are modern languages degrees where a stay in a foreign country might be required. The Senator might wish to note ITE courses are being reconfigured in line with the recommendations of the Department's literacy and numeracy strategy and the Teaching Council's policy on teacher education, and the need to ensure that all primary teachers are competent and confident in their use of the Irish language, especially given its importance in the primary school curriculum.  To this end, we are looking at raising the bar in regard to the Irish leaving certificate entry requirement for teacher education, but the quality of engagement during the Gaeltacht placement also needs to be of a high standard and be more focused on the outcomes required for our teachers.
11758	SeanSherlock	Labour	14309.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-02-09 00:00:00	Prelude	253	 The Senator's point is fair.  I wish I was in a position to be able to tell him we can  reverse this decision but we cannot.  Some 80% of the budget relates to pay.  There are commitments under Croke Park.  I have to be honest and straight with the Senator.  The decision has been made with regard to this budget line.  However, the IT courses will be reconfigured in line with the recommendations.  It is the case that the money is not there.  I do not want to plámás the Senator or give him the usual political platitudes but I must be straight with him and tell him that the money is not there.

11769	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	164	 I thank the Senators for tabling the amendment.  I appreciate their concerns about the intention to have the Bill apply retrospectively from 5 December 2011, the transposition date of the directive.  On Second Stage earlier this week the Minister indicated that he was in receipt of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the legislation should, on enactment, have retrospective effect from 5 December 2011, with the notable exception of the offence creating provisions in sections 13 and 15 in Part 4 of the Bill.  These provisions will come into effect on enactment of the legislation.  My advice is based on the fact that implementation of the directive provisions is necessitated to meet the obligations arising from membership of the European Union and that, therefore, they enjoy protection under the Constitution.
11770	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	201	 One must have regard to the points that were made by those such as Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O'Brien in terms of their experience as business people and given Senator Quinn's long-standing membership of this House as a legislator.  One has to have due regard and respect for that and for everything he says. If we strip out all of the rhetoric, the verbose language and the accusations, which I appreciate given such language occurs in the normal course of political dialogue, the key point is that this is about the implementation of a directive.
11771	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	204	 I will not be dragged into a debate on the last Government's performance and its relationship with the European Union——
11772	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	206	 ——or the nature of our own relationship with the European Union.  I happen to believe we are a member of the European Union — that is factual.  As such, we have signed up to a process of consultation through co-decision procedures and interaction with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  When the Commission makes a legislative proposal, if there is a co-decision procedure to be adhered to, then we, as a member of the EU, are party to that consultation process.  When an agreement is reached, primarily on the basis of consensus, we then transpose the directives.  In this case, the directive dates back to 2008; therefore, we have to transpose it.  If we all agree to the fact we are a member of the EU, then we subscribe to those founding principles and the legislative actions arising thereof and to which we are party. To take the points made by Mr. Jim Power, he was extrapolating from a UK figure.  While the Senator states he has no grá for Mr. Power, I happen to think Mr. Power is provocative and one who has provoked debate in a very positive sense in this country around issues such as agriculture, for example——
11773	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	208	" ——and in regard to the nature of employment.  He has provoked good debate, which is what we need in this country.  However, there is no evidence to date that in the UK job losses have occurred as a result of the same directive that must be transposed into UK law. I am not aware of any evidence on the record of this House or the Dáil in respect of utterances by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in regard to job losses.  With the indulgence of the House, I will quote again from his speech: The final derogation available under Article 5.4 of the directive recognises the voluntarist nature of industrial relations in the United Kingdom and in Ireland and was designed to meet the needs and flexibilities required in the labour market to accommodate the system in place in both countries.  The derogation includes the possibility for a ""qualifying period"" before the principle of equal treatment would apply to temporary agency workers. To be fair to the Minister, what we are trying to do here is to protect the rights of workers, to comply with the EU directive and to do so in a way that is balanced.  If there is a contention that job losses will occur directly in one specific company or entity as a result of this, I respectfully suggest I have my doubts.  The evidence in terms of inward investment into Ireland by global companies, which have public affairs departments and are au fait through those departments with trends in EU legislation and transposition of EU directives, is that they are aware this legislation is on the cards and would have regard to that fact when they are making their investment decisions in Ireland.  We have had some notable investment decisions and notable companies setting up here, some of whose operations would be within the sphere of employing temporary agency workers or contract workers. I have not seen any evidence of job losses in the UK and do not know of any public utterance by the Minister to this or the other House in respect of prospective job losses.  If somebody has done a study or has extrapolated from UK figures, it should be put on the record or submitted to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service."
11774	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	219	 The proposed amendment which has been ruled out of order seeks to move beyond the scope of the requirements contained in the directive.  The directive seeks only to set a floor of entitlements in respect of basic working and employment conditions.  Article 3.2 allows member states, in their national law, to determine the definition of pay, as well as other elements.  Under Article 5.4, member states are asked to specify whether elements such as pensions, sick pay, etc., are included in basic working and employment conditions.  Given the scope of the directive, this extends only to basic working and employment conditions.  It is not the Government's intention to move beyond either the spirit or intent of the directive, particularly at a time when we face such challenges in the labour market. I may be obliged to defer to the officials on Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's point.
11775	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	221	 Perhaps I might deal with it later then.
11776	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	224	 Yes, I will be obliged to do so.
11777	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	231	" I will begin with the last point.  If the lights are flashing amber or red in Columbus, Ohio, and the company to which the Senator referred is IDA Ireland supported or other State agencies have been actively involved with it, I suggest the State agencies talk to representatives of the company.  The Senator should approach the State agencies to discuss potential difficulties the company may have.  Successive Governments have always taken a hands-on approach and intervened through the State agencies to try to assist individual companies. On Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's earlier point, where there is no comparable employee, the rate paid should be that which would be paid to a comparable direct employee.  If such were to employed, the rate would have regard to skills, qualifications and length of service under sections 3 and 7(3), which sets the clock to 5 December 2011 and allows the hirer to base the rate on the rates that applied on that date.  I hope that addresses the point raised by the Senator. I thank Senators for their amendments.  The Government understands the various circumstances Senators are trying to guard against with the amendments.  Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend the definition of ""comparable employee"" as contained in section 3.  Amendment No. 5 seeks to avert any attempt by agency workers to select the most advantageous possible comparable employee in a scenario where there may be more than one possible comparator in a hirer undertaking.  Amendment No. 8 seeks the ability for the hirer undertaking to designate one person as the comparable employee against which the agency worker would be measured for the purposes of equal treatment.  In the context of ministerial amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil, the legislation already caters for the circumstance Senators are seeking to address.  In this connection, sections 3 and 7 must be read together.  The criteria in section 3 require that the employer of the agency worker and employee must be the same, the agency worker and employee must work at the same place and the work undertaken must be the same or similar in nature and be carried out under the same or similar conditions. Section 2 provides a further safeguard to avoid the selection of the most advantageous possible comparator, where it is a relevant factor, in the recruitment of direct employees, by providing that skills, qualifications and length of service are reckonable factors that a hirer can take into account.  These provisions all address in an appropriate manner the concerns of hirers and allow them to develop a robust defence in terms of the relevance or otherwise of the comparator selected. While I understand the concerns raised on the issue of the possible selection of inappropriate comparators, it is the case that there are instances, even in the civil and public service, where new entrants are taken on on less favourable terms and conditions than those that applied previously.  In this case, it is difficult to see how a successful challenge could be mounted by an agency worker in favour of the application of terms and conditions that applied previously.  For instance, new terms and conditions now apply to new recruits to the teaching and nursing professions, which would, therefore, be a logical benchmark for new agency workers being taken on.  It is inconceivable that a claim for equal treatment would succeed on the basis that an agency worker could claim that the previous terms and conditions of direct recruits should apply to him or her.  The Bill provides this certainty in so far as it can without unduly prejudicing the position of agency workers. On the basis that they are already catered for, a view supported by the Parliamentary Counsel, while I thank the Senators, I cannot accept the amendments."
11778	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	247	 With respect, I am happy to take all views and then respond finally to the amendment, if that is okay.
11779	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	250	" There have been a number of points.  I suppose now would be a bad time to say I am a big fan of Neuhaus Belgian chocolates.  I would say ""Fair play and well done"" to anybody with an Irish company trying to penetrate the Belgian market.  If the Senator is getting a foothold in that market, I applaud her."
11780	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	252	 That is fantastic.  In fairness, one must applaud the business model used by two of the Senators present and the fact that the two businesses compete at a world class level.  I am acknowledging this without plámás.  I lived in Belgium for three years and I always thought Cadbury's was the only chocolate product until I moved to Belgium.  We can now appreciate where we are with the wonderful product ranges and the high quality of those products. Collective agreements are addressed in section 8 and the possibility is allowed for in that section of concluding local and enterprise level agreements.  The fundamental point of the legislation concerns transposition of a directive and protection of workers' rights.  The question is what a person should be paid now.  There is no question of referring or reverting to old pay rates.  This does not arise.  Where does the Bill mention reverting to old pay rates?
11781	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	254	 The clock started on 5 December last.
11782	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	256	 Let us be straight about it.
11783	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	265	 One must always have regard to what is said in the Seanad on legislation.  I accept the points made about trying to revisit the issues involved before Report Stage.  However, there was a consultation process on the legislation dating back to 2010; therefore, it is not a case of the Government trying to ram it through.  The consultation process involved the social partners and, in fairness, the Minister took all views on board.  However, we are working within the limitations of the directive which was agreed at EU level by all member states.  It is arguable that no further consultation is required because there has been full engagement. With regard to measuring the potential job losses, Senator Jim Walsh, with all due respect, is a member of Fianna Fáil which was in power for the past decade.  To ask a Minister whether there will or will not be job losses and quantify the rate at which job losses will occur is a little like asking how long is a piece of string.  We do not know. I accept the point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien about the derogation period in the United Kingdom.  It has only been in place for the last three months, but as of today there is no evidence of job losses.  There might be some, but that is not based on information to me from the State agencies or stakeholders such as IBEC and others.  One cannot measure exactly whether there will be job losses or whether there will be no change to employment structures as a consequence of this legislation.  Bear in mind that its purpose is implementation of the directive and that we have obligations in terms of adherence to EU law. With regard to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, the requirement in the directive is that agency workers enjoy at least the same basic and working conditions that they would enjoy if they had been directly recruited by the hirer to do the same job.  Section 7 aims to remain faithful, as we are bound to be, to the wording of the directive and, therefore, provides for two separate and distinct possibilities.  The first, in section 7(1)(a), provides for a situation where there is already in existence a comparable employee.  In this instance, close regard must be had also to section 3 which defines the criteria for establishing a comparable employee.  The criteria set down are very specific and cumulative and, in that sense, do not allow a broad interpretation to be make of a comparable employee. Separately, section 7(1)(b) provides for instances where there is no comparable employee, in which case the terms and conditions applicable will be the same as those to which a comparable employee would, if directly employed, be entitled.  This is compliant with the directive requirement.  It is not possible to move beyond this, as the amendments seek to do, and introduce conditionality, effectively a watering down of the provisions, as proposed, because we would run the risk of falling foul of the directive requirements.  As in the case of section 7(1)(a), this provision must be read in conjunction with section 3. A further amendment brought forward to assist with legal certainty on the issue is that contained in section 7(3) which provides that in respect of agency workers on assignment prior to 5 December 2011, although the assignment may end after that date, the effective date for the purpose of establishing equal treatment is 5 December 2011.  The Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the directive wording does not facilitate the inclusion of the conditionality proposed in the text of the Bill.  In this regard, we have travelled as far as we can legally with the safeguards contained in sections 3 and 7(3) which are designed to assist in the proper implementation of the provision. In the proposed amendment to section 7(2) Senator Mary Ann O'Brien is, in effect, proposing a deeming provision to certify that an employer would be deemed to have conferred the entitlements of equal treatment on an agency worker where it was demonstrated that these were at least the same as those applicable to a comparable employee.  While understanding the rationale for the amendment, I am advised that such a provision is extraneous and not necessary.  In instances where there are comparable employees alongside agency workers it will in practice be the case that employers will seek to demonstrate that equal treatment between agency workers and comparable employees applies.  This will be useful in providing evidential proof.
11784	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	268	 It is a matter for the Senator if he wishes to call a vote on his amendment.  With regard to the consultation process, people were sent letters.  It involved the usual stakeholders such as IBEC.
11785	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	270	 No.  We can provide the Senator with a list.
11786	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	 We can provide a list.  The Minister met the National Recruitment Federation, individual recruitment agencies, IDA Ireland, IBEC and the ICTU.  There was an extensive consultation process on the issue.
11787	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	275	 No.
11788	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	280	 While I understand the rationale behind this amendment, it would not, even if accepted, have any material effect and is redundant.  It is already the case under the employment legislation that a contract of indefinite duration can be terminated for reasons such as redundancy, liquidation of the employer and so on.  Under the provisions of the existing law, this Bill does not discommode existing law in this context.
11789	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	282	 I am certain there is no prescriptive measure laid down, such as, for example, that employees must be a member of a trade union, by which they can consult under the provisions of section 8.
11790	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	283	 This is a technical amendment which seeks to ensure that for the purposes only of equal treatment of working and employment conditions for agency workers that are part-time employees, it is the provisions of this legislation and not that of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 that applies.  In effect, this means that whereas in that Act, the appropriate comparator that is established for an agency worker is another agency worker, that is superseded by this legislation, which takes as the appropriate comparator another directly recruited employee, subject to the criteria of section 3.
11791	SeanSherlock	Labour	14330.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	287	 I understand the rationale behind these amendments.  The provision as it stands, however, lists the facilities and amenities intended.  While the list is not exhaustive, it is not intended that collective facilities and amenities would include remuneration or expenses.  There is a danger in introducing one proposed exclusion as to do so would raise other issues that could be equally proposed for exclusion.  This type of detail is more appropriate for inclusion in guidance documentation on the Bill in preparation in my Department.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 14. On amendment No. 15, it is not suggested in the legislation nor would it be legally possible under the Bill that an agency worker could contend that there is any employment relationship between the hirer and the worker on the basis that the latter now has an entitlement to use any collective facilities in the same manner as direct employees.  The definitions make clear there is a three way relationship and the employer of the agency worker is the employment agency.  In that sense, the amendment is unnecessary.
