3216	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	411	" I move amendment No. 40: In page 9, line 29, after ""number"" to insert the following: ""or to a fine not exceeding €10,000, whichever is the greater"". The basis of this amendment is that the 2007 version of the Bill, in section 7(5), sets forth a minimum fine on indictment of €10,000 for fines set prior to the commencement date.  This has disappeared from the Bill, although it seems an appropriate provision to maintain the hierarchy of penalties between summary conviction and conviction on indictment.  We suggest that this be re-inserted."
3217	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I will not delay proceedings except to say that I agree with the tenor and tone of the amendments tabled by the Minister.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to ensure that people who are not criminals but who transgress or make mistakes will not be imprisoned as a result of not paying fines.  The legislation is also designed to put in place a process to ensure that people will have every avenue open to them in order that they might pay fines. Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to people's financial circumstances?  Do I understand that there is some degree of sympathy for persons who may have transgressed and who might find themselves subject to fines?  Will the new process take into account an individual's inability to pay in the context of both their outgoings and their overall earnings?  The Minister referred, in some sympathy, to persons who may have unintentionally transgressed and indicated that, for obvious reasons, he wants to keep them out of prison.  Is it the case that an appointed receiver will be in a position to recover property from someone who does not pay a fine? The amendments before the House improve the legislation.  The bottom line is that citizens must be given every means and opportunity possible to pay fines and avoid prison.  In addition, the legislation must contain a mechanism which ensures that no one will take advantage of any perceived softening in the approach of putting in place a system of fines in the first instance.  I welcome the amendments.
3218	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	535	" I presume the clock starts now.  On the recovery order in section 16, subsection 2 states: ""Before making a recovery order, the court shall conduct an inquiry into the financial circumstances of the person who has failed to pay the fine concerned and may require the person to provide the court with such information as it may specify relating to those circumstances.""  Although I am not speaking specifically to the amendments we are dealing with now — I wish to give notice that I will not be moving amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 51 — they do deal with this area.  We are seeking to ensure that all possibilities are exhausted concerning a person's particular set of financial circumstances.  That person's outgoings should potentially be taken into account also in adjudicating on the issue before going to a recovery order.  We want to ensure that a person who is not a serial offender or a hardy perennial before the courts, and who may have transgressed but who ordinarily is a very good citizen, would have every opportunity to pay the fine if they do not have the means immediately at their disposal.  I would like to get further clarity on that."
3219	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	538	" I move amendment No. 52: In page 11, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following: ""(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), where a person is convicted of an offence for which a fine or a sentence of imprisonment, or both, may be imposed, the court— (a) shall consider whether a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case; (b) shall, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, take into account the person’s financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine to impose in respect of the offence; (c) shall not, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case but that, having regard to the person’s financial circumstances, undue hardship would be caused by the imposition of a fine of any amount greater than a nominal amount, impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of such a fine if a sentence of imprisonment would not be appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, but may in that event direct the payment of the fine by instalments for such period as the court shall fix, but without prejudice to the power of the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of payment of a fine in such amount as the court considers is within the capacity of the defendant to pay.”. I take on board what the Minister has said.  These amendments seek to ensure a sense of appropriateness in each individual case.  I am satisfied that the Minister's position on these amendments has already been dealt with by the earlier amendments.  Therefore I intend to withdraw the amendment."
3220	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	567	 I am not against the amendment per se, but it states that the Courts Service “may” from time to time, publish in such a manner as it considers appropriate, including on the Internet, a list of the names and addresses of persons who have failed to pay fines imposed on them by the due date of payment.  I assume, since the word “may” is used that there is no obligation on the Courts Service to publish the names.  Without being sarcastic, when somebody presents himself or herself before the court, there is a good chance the court reporter from The Corkman or The Leitrim Observer or any other local newspaper will publish the person’s name in the following edition.  I suggest the persons concerned will have been subjected to enough embarrassment through that.  There may be circumstances where this imposes another administrative cost on the Courts Service.  I do not think the Minister has set out how much this will cost to administer.  By virtue of use of the word “may”, I wonder if it will ever be used at all.  That is a question, by the way.
3221	SeanSherlock	Labour	13601.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-03 00:00:00	Prelude	606	" I support this Bill which should have the effect of fundamentally changing our culture by ensuring that everyone who gets behind the wheel of a car does so in the full knowledge that new penalties will be imposed for certain driving behaviours.  As a result of this legislation, those who drink will have to significantly change their behaviour.  We need to modify how we, as a society, deal with the issue of alcohol and the only way to achieve this objective is to ensure there is no ambiguity about the blood alcohol limits that apply while driving. Having served on Cork County Council with him, I have the greatest respect for the previous speaker, Deputy Christy O'Sullivan.  I, too, am only too well aware of the conditions experienced by rural dwellers who are frequently disadvantaged by virtue of their rural isolation and experience a lack of access to services.  I find it difficult to listen to Government Deputies deplore the state of rural roads and the problem of rural isolation. If people are to have access to the services they will require as a result of the measures provided for in the Bill, we must ensure ancillary services are in place to meet their demands and needs.  For instance, in my area Bus Éireann has decided to withdraw the No. 66 route which serves a rural area and individuals living in rural isolation.  They include older people who travel to towns such as Fermoy, Ballyhooly and Castletownroche to enjoy a drop before taking a bus home later in the evening.  Many of these people do not drive and will no longer have access to the service as a result of the decision to close the route.  This problem is a function of Government policy because an ancillary rural transport programme is not in place to pick up the slack arising from the loss of the service.  In particular, a night time bus service is not in place to facilitate those who want to act responsibility but are unable to avail of a bus service.  Government policy militates against the very people who experience rural isolation. We need to be clear about the implications of the legislation.  If we support the Bill on the basis that driver behaviour must change significantly, we must also take into account that some people, by virtue of residing in rural areas and deciding to behave responsibly as required under the legislation, will no longer have access to the local pub.  Current policy does not meet their needs.  If Bus Éireann drops routes at a rate of knots and the rural transport programme is not rolled out quickly enough to pick up the slack, particularly with regard to night time services, those who live in the rural areas  obviously will be affected.  This issue needs to be teased out in greater detail. On the commencement of the sections which will become operational before mid-2011, I refer to the Bills digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Unit.  It states: . . . different sections may become operational before others.  Some of the provisions of the Bill will not come into force until mid 2011.  This is because evidential breath-testing (EBT) machines used in Garda stations to measure the alcohol in a driver's breath cannot be recalibrated to the 20mg/100mL limit as yet. What is the current state of play with regard to the Garda's capacity to recalibrate the EBT machines as required? I understand the legislation reduces blood alcohol limits and introduces mandatory alcohol testing for drivers who are involved in traffic collisions as well as roadside preliminary impairment testing to detect drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  One would expect the Government to have ensured all necessary technology was available prior to or in parallel with the implementation of the legislation.  Will the Minister provide an update on the Garda's capacity to use the required technology? On road collision statistics, while I do not doubt the bona fides of the Road Safety Authority, I have a healthy scepticism about some of the statistics produced on road traffic accidents.  The Government has stated its commitment to improving road safety and the number of deaths on Irish roads declined to 240 in 2009.  It is estimated that 25% of road accidents and 33% of fatal road accidents are attributable to alcohol.  I often wonder how such statistics are measured and what process is used by the Road Safety Authority or Garda Síochána to produce their statistics, particularly those relating to road fatalities.  I am not sceptical about the figures but I question the qualitative methods used to compile the statistics used for making an argument for a particular proposal.  I ask for a response in that regard. I welcome the provisions on new drivers.  We cannot disregard the link between driver impairment and alcohol consumption.  It has been proven scientifically and is supported by anecdotal evidence.  Common sense says that if a person imbibes, their ability to operate a machine or vehicle will be impaired. The Vintners' Federation of Ireland opposed the reduction in the limit and I can see its point.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that their regular rural customers might drink a pint and a drop before ambling home.  They never go beyond their usual level of imbibing, which is a social outlet for them.  We must be able to provide for those who use the pub as a social outlet.  If they are not able to drive, how will we facilitate them?  Some of them will be able to get taxis while others will travel with neighbours.  However, do we now have to tell them that there is no other alternative?  In implementing the legislation, we need to strike a balance and speak for those people as well. The section creates a distinction between newly qualified and other full licence holders.  Novice drivers are subject to a lower BAC and will be automatically disqualified for three months if an administrative fixed penalty is accepted, or disqualified for six months if found guilty after a court hearing.  Other licence holders do not face automatic disqualification following a first conviction.  Can the Minister of State clarify if this is an age-related distinction, or does it merely distinguish between novices and experienced drivers?  Is any qualification brought into play concerning an older person who may have transgressed?  It is not that I am advocating a particular position on that, but I am seeking clarification in the Minister of State's response. On balance we are experiencing a serious erosion of services in rural areas.  Some argue that the decline of the rural pub reflects a decline in overall infrastructure, particularly roads.  As someone who meets members of the public every day, I hold that view myself, because they are finding it increasingly difficult to access services.  That is particularly the case for older people.  I would distinguish between older and elderly people, because the use of the word ""elderly"" sometimes implies a certain infirmity.  Many older people are mobile, although they may not drive.  We always had a sense of inter-generational solidarity in this country, but it is being undermined by stealth.  When drafting legislation we must, therefore, ensure that if it impacts on one service we should try to replace it with another service if possible. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that lives are saved and one cannot qualify that.  While it is a black and white issue, there are grey areas where some public services will be diminished.  Government policy on rural transport should be structured in such a way that people can access community centres or pubs outside normal office hours if they wish to do so.  We must facilitate them in this respect."

3239	SeanSherlock	Labour	13602.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	 At yesterday's meeting of the agriculture committee, a motion was put before it concerning the Lost at Sea scheme and a decision was taken on the Ombudsman's report.  The Labour Party has circulated a motion for the House to seek that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would discuss this matter.  The House has the power to refer it to the committee in a bid to seek that a report be sent back to the House by a set date. I am asking that the Ombudsman be afforded an opportunity to present her findings on the Lost at Sea scheme.  She has not been afforded such an opportunity to date.  Yesterday's vote by the committee denied her that opportunity, but we are seeking to table the matter before the wider House so as that the Oireachtas allows her an opportunity.  It is vital——
3240	SeanSherlock	Labour	13602.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	 The motion will be tabled before the House.

3256	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	282	 With all due respect, I indicated on this issue.  There is a motion before the House and all the Labour Party wants is to provide the Ombudsman with an opportunity to present the findings of her report before a designated committee, preferably the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  That is on the Order Paper and we are asking that there be some degree of common sense in terms of how this is approached.  We do not want further statements in the Dáil on this matter and, as Deputy Gilmore said, it can be done without debate if we facilitate the person in question.  That is all we are asking.
3257	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	284	 It is a very reasonable request and it is all we are asking.
3258	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	336	 I note what the Taoiseach has said about the Ombudsman's Act being silent on the matter.  Again, we respectfully ask that the Taoiseach allow the Ombudsman an opportunity to present her findings.  I believe that is a reasonable approach.  This can be done in a non-partisan way.  I am sure this House could facilitate such a process.
3259	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	870	 I support the amendment on the basis of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children report on primary care published last month.  There is a view that the primary care strategy will be vital in terms of health care provision in the future.  The Labour Party believes primary care centres should be licensed by the HSE and subject to the rules of HIQA.  If one adheres to the goals in the primary care strategy, one would encourage more people to be treated in primary care centres and moved away from accident and emergency centres.  If more people are to be treated in primary care centres, then it is obvious that we need more such centres and, therefore, one must provide some degree of stimulus to bring about more of them. I am aware of one such centre in north Cork which will bring together approximately 17 general practitioners.  The HSE has bought in as an active stakeholder in that process and the PCCC, primary, community and continuing care, programme will arise from the process.  There are beneficial social outcomes as a result of facilitating specific reliefs by regulation. I anticipate the Minister will speak to the issue of property-based reliefs and there is general agreement in respect of their future.  However, specific reliefs can be made in respect of capital investment or equipment.  We must be far-reaching in this regard.  I admire the wording put forward because it allows the Minister a degree of latitude.  We should consider the amendment laterally and take a lateral view of how we proceed with primary care centres, which the amendment facilitates.
3260	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	874	 It takes a regime change.
3261	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	878	 May I tease out the figures that the Minister placed before us and seek a clarification on the number of contracts that are under negotiation presently?  I may have misheard the Minister.  I thought she stated 30 are under negotiation.  I want to get a more qualitative analysis of the present state of negotiations.  The reason I ask that is because I believe it is pertinent to the amendment. The current state of negotiations could be influenced by whether or not further stimulus is given to primary care centres that may be under negotiation presently or that persons may be thinking of setting up where they may have started cursory negotiations with the HSE or the Department of Health and Children.  Given the present state of the economy, the state of those negotiations will be predicated on whether there is a stimulus provided and an amendment such as this will definitely have an influence in bringing more of them to fruition.  That would be my party's view.
3262	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	970	 I listened with interest to the arguments put forward by Government Deputies, particularly from the Green Party Member from Carlow, because I never heard such patronising drivel in all my life.  To suggest that we are giving businesses a false hope by bringing forward this Bill reflects the unreality of Green Party Deputies.  This legislation tries to find positive solutions to the real problems that people face in villages, towns and cities throughout the country because they cannot renegotiate their rents. We are taking a realistic approach to the problem, backed by a sound body of legal opinion.  Deputy Kennedy's demand that we put our legal opinion before the House is merely a digression from the issues at hand.
3263	SeanSherlock	Labour	13608.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	972	 Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are aware that we are offering a genuine solution but they will not even entertain our attempt to build a positive outcome.  I remind Deputy White that the Bill seeks to address the emergency that has arisen in regard to upward-only rent reviews and the substantial economic havoc that such provisions are wreaking on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Rent reviews, which normally occur every five years, are resulting in the wind up of a large number of companies.  In many cases, liquidators are having to exercise special statutory powers to disclaim onerous leases and the effective abandonment of businesses results in substantial employment losses.  This Bill attempts to find a solution to this serious issue.  We are not giving anybody false hopes when we seek to find a way to help these businesses survive and flourish. I do not know if Deputy White received as many e-mails on this issue as I did.  I wish to share with her one such e-mail I received from a lady in Mallow who operates a small niche business called Fountain of Angels.  Her rent is €8,500 per annum.  She told me in her e-mail that the upward-only rent review clause is unfair and discriminates against tenants.  It is putting her under significant pressure and calls into question the viability of her business.  If she tries to leave, however, the landlord is entitled to pursue her for loss of income for the remainder of her lease, which happens to have a term of 11 years.  This situation is not helped by auctioneers who give misleading information and it reflects every e-mail we have received on this issue.  This is a real issue and it must be dealt with in a real political sense and that is what we seek to do tonight. Other matters that must be tackled include the hold on legal opinion and the hold that auctioneers, landlords and property owners have over people.  We should think more laterally about how to allow businesses to survive, a purpose at the heart of the Bill.  The proposals are perfectly realistic for people who live in the real world.  We do not contend that we are giving people false hope.  We are serious enough to put forward a Bill of this nature because we wish to tackle this issue realistically such that we can give small businesses an opportunity to flourish.  That is the motive from which this Bill emanates.

3275	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	631	 The reason I asked the question is because we have an opportunity in this country to phase out such fuels as coal and they can quite easily be replaced by miscanthus.  Farmers tell me that the establishment costs are quite high and that the grant could be improved, if possible, to assist in that regard.  Did I hear the Minister of State correctly when he stated that he is precluded by European Union rules from expanding or increasing that level of grant aid?  I ask him to expand on that point.  Once the crop has been established, is there any scope to improve the increments for weed control, the control of pests and also ploughing and cultivation?  If he is unable to increase the grant for the establishment of the crop, perhaps he could consider an increase on the embedded side, if I could use that expression.
3276	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	633	 Will the Minister of State agree there are many companies facilitating farmers in establishing the crop in the first instance and that the expertise exists?  Will he acknowledge the potential for this crop and that perhaps the Government is under-valuing the potential of this crop in meeting an alternative energy need?  Will he also acknowledge that there may be a reluctance on the part of farmers to switch into this crop because the scheme itself is undersold?  The Government needs to do a marketing job to encourage more farmers to diversify into this crop, given the level of expertise, particularly in the east Cork and west Limerick regions where two companies that are market leaders are only itching to get more farmers under their ambit but they need a greater financial incentive.
3277	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	668	 I was unsure whether the question related to competition policy or food labelling, but I will address both matters while I have the opportunity.
3278	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	671	" I appreciate that.  Will the Minster acknowledge in respect of food labelling that there is no willingness on the part of certain EU countries to proceed with a change to the country of origin labelling regime in operation at present, because it would materially affect their trade and the issue of substantial transformation?  If there were a real political initiative at EU level in respect of this issue, the Government and the Green Party would be shouting about it from the rooftops.  Let us not be disingenuous about it. I refer to the Competition Act.  I appreciate the Spanish EU Presidency is taking initiatives in respect of this issue but there is already a considerable body of law on the Irish Statute Book.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the Competition Act 2002, which incorporates the treaty on the functioning of the EU, prohibits agreements and concerted practices which have as their ""object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade on any goods""?  Will the Minister further acknowledge that upon the abolition of the groceries order in December 2005 it was stated that certain unilateral action on the part of non-dominant undertakings in the groceries trade would effectively be legislated for——"

3280	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	685	 Has the Minister of State an opinion on the fact that the committee took a unanimous decision across all of the political party boundaries and across the political spectrum, and that such decision was based on hearing a corpus of evidence from all sides?  I respectfully suggest to the Minister of State that he must take cognisance of the fact that it is a unanimous view, which should be taken seriously by him in determining the final outcome, and that when the committee took the view, it did so on the basis that the aims of the Irish Draught Horse Society were not mutually exclusive from those of HSI and that there would be no threat to HSI by ceding the studbook to the Irish Draught Horse Society.

3289	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	711	 The decline in farm employment has been stark.  The loss of employment in the construction industry, as acknowledged by the Minister, is also having a major bearing on off-farm employment. A report by David Meredith of Teagasc's rural economy research centre in Kinsealy, County Dublin, highlighted that 70% of farmers recorded lower secondary education as their highest qualification, meaning they are more vulnerable to an economic downturn.  If only 6% of farmers have a third level degree, will the Minister agree more has to be done to encourage young farmers to up-skill so if they need an off-farm income they will have good employment choices and still be able to part-time farm?  Will he also agree it is important to provide proper resources to the agricultural colleges?
3290	SeanSherlock	Labour	13609.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	718	 The rate of decline was from 115,000 in 2008 to 98,000 in 2009.  Not all of the agricultural colleges will be able to take up that slack to re-educate these farmers.  While I appreciate the Minister's response, he will have to widen the scope of the existing education policy.

3343	SeanSherlock	Labour	13651.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-22 00:00:00	Prelude	333	 I wish to start by quoting Commissioner Piebalgs, who stated: Europe's energy import dependency is forecast to reach 64% in 2020 . . .  That is why the Commission does all it can to improve European levels of energy efficiency and renewables including biofuels . . .  This growth [in greenhouse gas emissions] threatens to cancel out the savings being made elsewhere.  On present trends, transport will account for more than 60% of the EU's increase in carbon dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2020. There is a global debate at the moment on the scarcity of food supply.  There are those, particularly the NGOs who represent developing countries, who have rightly stated that the move towards bio-fuel production globally is having an impact on global food prices.  The question for us is where we strike the balance.  Given such a high dependence on fossil fuels, we cannot detract from tackling that issue.  If we do not take action now, it will have serious implications.  The Labour Party's view is that while we acknowledge that the increase in food prices globally is as a result of the movement towards bio-fuels, we also acknowledge that appropriate land use and rules governing deforestation would assist in attaining a greater balance between the two. In essence we welcome the introduction of a bio-fuel obligation scheme.  The reduction of the target from the 5.75% reflects current economic realities.  Perhaps the right conditions were not in place to reach those targets in the first instance.  The legislation before us is a realistic attempt to try to shift the focus from fossil fuels to alternative energy, which we welcome.  In establishing a bio-fuels obligation scheme that seeks to ensure that 4% of transport fuel is derived renewable sources from July 2010, we must ensure that such an obligation is as favourable as possible to existing domestic bio-fuels companies and to new companies that will emerge.  It is vital that the bio-fuels obligation scheme becomes a source of potentiality, particularly regarding the rural economy. We must ensure we can stimulate supply domestically to avoid excessive reliance on imports in order to fulfil the requirements of the bio-fuels obligation scheme.  For instance, the Munster region traditionally depended largely on the sugar beet industry with approximately 31,000 hectares given over to the production of sugar.  There is a potential for diversion of land use in order to be able to meet this obligation.  If companies wish to set up in order to assist in meeting the obligations here, it would stimulate a demand that could be filled by the rural economy, which is what we should be doing.  We do not want to have this obligation and end up importing the raw materials in order to meet that obligation.  We need to consider the economic potential on this island to facilitate that. Inherent within the bio-fuels obligation scheme is a capacity for growth and economic development of a sector which is, to all intents and purposes, in its infancy in this country.  Bio-fuels industry lobbyists, such as Ethanol Ireland, have maintained a starting point which would mandate that, in order for any ethanol to be eligible for an obligation certificate, it would have to meet the EN 15376 standard and be designated as Taric or CN code 22071000.  It has been suggested by Ethanol Ireland that a situation similar to that in Germany would be appropriate. In the Seanad, the Minister, in his response on this issue to Senator Joe O'Toole, stated, more or less, that Ireland had an obligation to remain within the WTO rules and in compliance with EU regulations.  My understanding of this is that the introduction of a tariff could not unfairly restrict imports, and that this was the Government position.  I appreciate the Minister's statement in regard to the regulation and we will revisit that at a further stage. The simple issue here, and let us not forget that we are debating this issue at a time when the economy is on its knees, is that compliance with EU and WTO rules must be mutual with this country's need to create new economic opportunities, particularly within the rural economy.  The question arises, therefore, as to whether it is possible to introduce an amendment which would tally with the German or other EU member states' positions.  As we understand it, the Seanad amendments were fully consistent with EU trade guidelines and do not restrict imports unfairly or unduly.  There are concerns, outlined by the Minister in the Seanad, for the implications for this island and the cross-Border impact as to whether this could lead to a distortion in terms of the impact where pricing models may differ. Senator Joe O'Toole summed it up correctly when he stated in the Seanad debate: The Minister said that from a national perspective the only substantial problem with the course of action proposed is that the United Kingdom has not adopted such a measure and given that we import 60% of our road transport fuel from the UK, such a measure would have the potential to increase costs to Irish consumers substantially as they would have to be supplied with a different blend of bioethanol.  That is probably the most challenging of all the points made. He further stated: Most Brazilian fuel ethanol is transported to Europe in bulk tankers in an undenatured state.  Normally, it is only denatured at the point of receipt into the member state to benefit from the lower tariff and technical requirements.  Most of it is brought into Rotterdam and subsequently broken down and then distributed across Europe.  Best practice recommends that blending takes place as close as possible to the point of distribution.  Hence, the point of blending tends to be the destination member state.  Currently in Ireland, bioethanol blending usually occurs at the point of receipt in the bond — whichever bonded facility it goes into.  With regard to petroleum, we currently import approximately 50% of our requirements from the UK, 35% through Whitegate and the balance from Scandinavia, through Derry.  We have been reliably informed that all the oil majors in Ireland will have blending capacity and undenatured ethanol at their facilities by the end of the year.  This has been confirmed separately to me as being correct.  Topaz, in Whitegate, already has full capability.  Even if oil companies opt to blend in the UK or mainland Europe, these are pan-European suppliers that already supply some member states with a product similar to the Irish specified product.  All that matters is that the bioethanol coming into Ireland satisfies the definition under the bio-fuels legislation, which must comply with Taric code 22071000 and EN 15376. If I understand the Minister's speech in the Seanad, he alluded to the fact that because the UK has not adopted such a measure, and given the massive rate of importation from the UK, there could be a cost impact for the Irish consumer.  I hope this is a matter the Minister will go into further on the next Stage. To deal with Taric or CN code 22071000, Ethanol Ireland produced a paper which I am sure the Minister and every Member in the House has had sight of.  In it, Ethanol Ireland suggested that the German bio-fuel quota law would be the most appropriate for this jurisdiction.  There are two provisions within that law and these would effectively create a barrier to imports from non-EU sources being eligible for certificates unless they were of a quality equal to EU production and had paid the higher of the two tariff's applicable to ethanol, namely, 19.2 cent per litre versus 10.2 cent per litre.  The issue for Ethanol Ireland is that Irish-produced ethanol can compete with that produced elsewhere in the EU and with non-EU imports if those imports are of a similar purity and attract the 19.2 cent per litre tariff. I should point out that I hold no brief for Ethanol Ireland but it is the only group I have had an interaction with in regard to the potential domestic producers and I believe its voice probably speaks for the domestic industry in this sense.  There have been, to my knowledge, extensive discussions with the Department on these issues, mainly overcoming the Department's issues relating to the pump price impact and on the economic potential of an indigenous bio-fuels industry. In the Seanad, the Minister gave himself the power to make regulations pertaining to the eligibility of bio-fuels.  In discussions I have had with Ethanol Ireland, the reason given for choosing this way is that if the specific regulation were included in the Bill itself, it would require notification to the EU, as the Minister has stated.  This would result in a potential delay in implementation of the Bill, which, given the timeframe involved in the bio-fuels obligation scheme, would not be acceptable.  We will have to deal with this issue again on the next Stage as it warrants further discussion. The essence of this issue is whether, by regulation, bio-ethanol used for transport fuel must comply with EN 15376 and, if imported, must have been imported under Taric code 22071000 in order to qualify for an obligation certificate.  The two provisions would effectively create a barrier to imports, as I have already outlined. The other issue in regard to the obligation is whether the three main EU policy objectives are being met, namely, the reduction in CO2 emissions, increased security of energy supply, and the maximisation of EU, national and regional social and economic benefits.  If we can create a situation on this island which allows for a new market or a new industry which will take as much of the market share as possible in terms of creating a domestic supply and a domestic market, this legislation should seek to create the conditions which will bring that about.  As Deputy Coveney said, farming and agri-business is in a state of flux at present in that there are uncertainties in regard to the dairy sector and the meat sector.  We have to recognise that if we do not grasp this opportunity now, it could be lost for a long time. The Minister's speech gave a sense that he wishes to create domestic supplies for this and if we can facilitate that, it is the way to go.  We must not be afraid to take this course of action.  Other countries have already implemented tariffs under various models.  I see no reason why we cannot be protectionist in our attitude to this issue.  If the obligation exists, Ireland should be able to ensure its own security of supply by using domestic means. I welcome the Bill and will study the Minister's speech in depth before Committee Stage.  This is a step in the right direction.  We should not be ashamed to protect our own domestic supply in a way that is congruous with WTO and EU rules.

3345	SeanSherlock	Labour	13657.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-28 00:00:00	Prelude	346	 I wish to specifically address the issue of credit unions and their ability to reschedule loans and pay dividends at the same time. Part 7 refers to section 15(7) of the Bill, which seeks to amend section 35 of the Credit Union Act, will make it impossible for credit unions to undertake rescheduling and pay a dividend to members.  This is because the cost to credit unions of additional reserves arising from the rescheduling would leave nothing to be paid out by way of a dividend.  This could cause members to withdraw savings from credit unions, resulting in them having less money to loan out and forcing members into the hands of loan sharks or moneylenders. The Minister for Finance undertook in April 2009 to review section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to make it easier for credit unions to accommodate members desiring to reschedule their loans, due to the recession.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Noel O'Flynn, will be aware that the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs has undertaken extensive consultations with all the representative bodies on this and other regulatory provisions.  The economic and regulatory affairs committee's consultations, under the chairmanship of Deputy Moynihan, in my opinion, have surpassed those of the Department of Finance in that the latter's consultation process has been more limited and technical difficulties are now manifesting on the eve of this legislation being passed into law. I understand that the expert committee established by the Minister's Department was limited originally in its membership and met infrequently.  The proposed regulatory requirements underpinning this legislation will result, to my mind, in the opposite to what was intended by the Minister unless amendments are made on Committee Stage.  If not amended, it will mean a more restrictive regime around credit unions, denying them the ability to meet the needs of some members impacted by unemployment, wage cuts and even public service levies.  I am sure this is not what the Minister had intended when the legislation was first drafted. It is impossible and unwise to look at the Central Bank Bill as it relates to an easing of restrictions on credit union loan duration limits, without looking at what the registrar proposes as the underlying requirements and operational guidelines.  The Registrar of Credit Unions viewed the proposed legislative change as an opportunity to impose yet more stringent reserve and liquidity requirements upon credit unions, it could be argued.  This has to be seen in the context that credit unions are the most reserve-rich financial institutions in the State.  The registrar introduced a regulatory or non-distributable minimum capital reserve requirement of 10% for credit unions in 2009 — a very stringent reserve requirement, given that the banks at present are baulking at their new standard of 8%.  It should also be measured against the fact that the vast majority of credit unions benefit from an additional layer of protection in the form of a self-funded mutual stabilisation fund, the savings protection scheme, under the auspices of the Irish League of Credit Unions. There is a very real danger of over-egging the cake in this particular instance.  The registrar proposes to apply his section 35 requirements to all credit unions regardless of whether a credit union wishes to avail of the extension to the section 35 limits.  This is something that must be addressed on Committee Stage.  The registrar is proposing a liquidity requirement of 25% to 30% where the section 35 exemption is availed of.  Even the current 20% liquidity requirement is very onerous when measured against the standards the regulator currently applies against banking. There is every danger here that the combination of the registrar's and Minister's proposals will have the impact of rendering it impossible for credit unions to pay a dividend to their members.  If all surplus funds must be ploughed into additional reserves, credit union dividends will suffer, driving funds out of responsible credit unions and into irresponsible banks. It must be stated, and the Minister must accept, that no credit union has needed to be bailed out by the State.  No taxpayers' money has been poured into a single credit union, to my knowledge, and the vast majority of credit unions are part of a voluntary mutual stabilisation fund which acts as a backstop to the State deposit guarantee scheme.  There are ongoing calls for this stabilisation scheme to be regulated by the Registry of Credit Unions and extended to all credit unions in the State. The registrar seems to be taking the view that every rescheduled loan is an at-risk loan.  This is a false assumption.  Many credit union members are taking the responsible route when confronted by a drop in income and approaching their credit unions immediately, before arrears occur, to renegotiate their payments.  This must also be considered on Committee Stage.  The proposals before the House today, if unaltered, will tie the hands of credit unions behind their backs.  It is inconsistent of the regulator to encourage banks to reschedule loans for their borrowers while, at the same time, financially penalising credit unions that seek to accommodate their members.  Practical amendments need to be agreed on Committee Stage.  A balance must be struck between the needs of borrowers and savers and the requirement to supplement already strong reserves. I understand the credit union representative associations, including the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers' Association, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the National Supervisors' Forum and the credit unions themselves, have been in negotiation with the regulator and the Department of Finance on these issues.  I look forward to the introduction of positive amendments that will add strength to the credit union movement, which is one of the few bright lights on the financial horizon. The Minister for Finance set out, in April 2009, to make it easier for credit unions to respond to the needs of members experiencing unemployment and reduced incomes by affording greater flexibility to credit unions to extend loan terms, where necessary, beyond five years.  His Department entered into limited consultation on this matter and it was the registrar of credit unions and not the Department that became the driver in this reform.  The result is legislation that makes it more difficult — that is, more expensive — for credit unions to respond to member requests for rescheduled loans. I am not saying credit unions should not have strong reserves.  Nobody is arguing that.  I fully support the registrar's introduction of the regulatory reserve requirement in 2009 and commend credit unions on building up their capital reserves to 10% as a result of this requirement.  This compares favourably with the equivalent figure for banks, which is 8%.  However, this House should pause for thought when we see yet another reserve-driven initiative from the registrar that has not been the subject of a regulatory impact analysis.  Credit union representative associations are responsible bodies and are warning against the financial impact of this latest — dare I say it — hurried imposition by the registrar.  It is unwise for this House to consider such an imposition when the registrar and the Department have clearly not undertaken an impact analysis.  Impact models produced by credit union bodies show many credit unions facing nil dividend returns to members as a result of the Minister's proposals. The proposed change will not address the needs of unemployed credit union members but will make it impossibly expensive for credit unions to respond to the needs of their members.  In addition, and equally importantly, the measure will jeopardise the ability of many credit unions to pay dividends to their members, which will drive money out of credit unions over time and ultimately damage this great not-for-profit resource.  Ultimately, the only bodies that will gain from the weakening of the credit union movement will be banks and moneylenders. It could be argued that this is a hurried and ill-conceived measure.  It merits careful scrutiny before damage is inflicted on the credit union sector.  This sector has not demanded any bailout at taxpayers' expense and it has acted with probity at all times, although there are some notable exceptions.  Looking at the credit union movement, one must be convinced that it has acted for the common good at all times.  It is a responsible sector with its own stabilisation fund.  When we hear warnings from the credit union representative associations of the damage that this so-called reform will bring, we must take cognisance of this and act cautiously. The Registrar of Credit Unions has extensive powers of regulation and is currently overseeing a review of the credit union sector on behalf of the Department of Finance.  Radical proposals to heap additional reserve requirements on an already reserve-rich credit union sector need careful consideration.  I urge that this take place and that there be plenty of dialogue with the representative associations.  I hope their concerns will be reflected in the Minister's response and in amendments introduced to the Bill on Committee Stage. I ask the Acting Chairman how much time I have left.

3348	SeanSherlock	Labour	13657.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-28 00:00:00	Prelude	575	 The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, in response to a Parliamentary Question today in regard to the Mazars review of lending to small and medium enterprises stated: The third Mazars report on lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, which covers the period from October to December 2009, showed that credit applications in number and value terms rose slightly in the last quarter of 2009 over the previous quarter, which is encouraging.  The level of applications for credit appears to be stabilising and Mazars also reported a small improvement in the overall credit approval rate. However, the reduction in the stock of credit, as repayments exceed new credit, and in credit quality reported by the banks remains a concern for the Government.  To address this concern, I announced earlier this month that AIB and Bank of Ireland are to make available a minimum of €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities, including working capital targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises, in the real economy in each of the next two years. The small and medium enterprise group appeared before the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs yesterday.  Its members constitute more than 98% of all business entities in Ireland and number more than 240,000 in terms of the number of businesses they represent and employ just under one million people.  In response to questions on the Mazars report, Mr. Fielding, the representative, stated that, with regard to access to credit, the Mazars report published last week has been hijacked by the banks. In the first two Mazars reports there was major input from the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and small business.  We did not even know the third report was coming out and it was launched at a joint press conference by Mazars and the Irish Banking Federation with no Department of Finance, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or small to medium enterprises.  It was very disappointing from our point of view.  In further deliberations on the difficulties facing small businesses we spoke about the employment subsidy scheme. Mr. Fielding went on to state that last summer the Tánaiste introduced the employment subsidy scheme.  Initially, it was for exporters only but it was extended to all companies.  I direct the following comment to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  However, Mr. Fielding went on to state that in the small print one saw it was extended to all companies except those employing fewer than ten people, immediately excluding 90% of all businesses.  Therefore, Government policy on employment relates to firms employing ten or more employees.  It gives an unfair advantage to those employing 11 as against a firm employing nine people.  The Government does not have bottomless pockets but one would think more could be done when one sees the amount of money being invested in the banks.  These are the words of the person who represents 98% of businesses in the country.  These are his views in respect of funding and the role of banks in this society at the moment. There is a vacuum at present.  It is the view of ISME that there remains a significant lending deficit which undermines competitiveness, constrains productivity, threatens recovery and puts at risk the ability of SMEs to gain access to working capital and growth capital.  That is what this motion is about. The banking crisis has seriously impaired the capacity of Irish banks to lend to the SME sector.  I refer to the answer I received to my question on the Mazars report.  The Minister stated that a letter was sent to both Bank of Ireland and AIB on 7 April of this year requiring them to prepare an SME lending plan, broken down by sector and geography for submission to the Department by 12 May.  What does this tell us about the Government's response to lending in the SME sector in the first instance and the banks response since the guarantee was put in place in September 2008 in respect of lending in the SME sector?  It is non-existent; it is not happening.  The evidence of a letter on 7 April this year does not inspire confidence into the process being undertaken in respect of the systemic banks and other banks at present.  The Minister also stated both banks were expected to make credit available.

The bottom line is we have a viable plan here, one which will facilitate lending to the SME sector.  We can do this post haste, which is what needs to be done to effect growth in this economy again.

Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the initial focus of this analysis is on primary school accommodation requirements and this will be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary accommodation requirements. When the required reports have been completed for these initial identified areas the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country. Overall school accommodation requirements in the North Kildare area, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary school, will be considered in this regard.  In addition to this detailed analysis of accommodation needs currently being carried out by Forward Planning Section, the Department is also currently examining a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools. As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second level schools and their patronage.

3355	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	475	 With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission, I, too, wish to warmly congratulate Deputy Connick on his accession to the position of Minister of State.  I wish him well and look forward to working with him. I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  If the scheme is designed with biodiversity in mind, will the Minister of State acknowledge that hedgerows in particular and road margins and the biodiversity within are being threatened by the illegal dumping of plastics, which, in turn, will have an effect on biodiversity over time?  Will he also acknowledge that there could be an opportunity, through this scheme, for farmers to work in partnership with the local authorities to ensure drainage mechanisms are put in place?  We could potentially have an arterial drainage type scheme at a local level and could also, by incentivising farmers to maintain the hedge rows, create from this some degree of income.
3356	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	477	 I believe this is a missed opportunity.  If the scheme is so diverse, is not a whole farm scheme and relates to issues such as tree planting, moor land grazing, lake catchments, mixed grazing and conservation of wild bird habitat then I honestly believe an opportunity has gone abegging to do something to stem the tide of illegal dumping and to bring farmers and landowners into partnership in terms of seeking to alleviate that problem.  I accept the Minister of State's response.
3357	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	513	" I am glad the Minister of State mentioned the word ""flooding"" because one can have all the nitrates alleviation measures in the world, but if one does not tackle the issue of flooding it does not amount to anything.  Would the Minister of State acknowledge that since the serious flooding last year nothing has been done, in concrete terms, to instigate measures which would prevent such flooding happening again, in particular in the Shannon basin region?  The consultation process is lagging behind the need for direct action on flooding events, such as those we saw in the west and throughout the Shannon region.  Action is now needed and it precedes the consultation process.  We should not envisage a situation in the coming months like that which we saw previously, in terms of its effect on agriculture."

3359	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	530	 I am also reassured by the Minister's reply.  Given the alleged breaches of contract, will a mechanism be introduced to facilitate the compensation of farmers for loss of contract?  Potentially, the company has abused its dominant position by allegedly breaching contracts.  What is the Minister's view on that?

I refer to the market management regime, the export refund scheme and intervention stocks.  Will the Minister acknowledge that until such time as there is a pick-up in global demand that the system will remain as it is for some time?  Perhaps I am wrong but it appears that not much more can be done in terms of intervening to facilitate a recovery until such time as global demand for milk and milk-based products picks up.

In posing the question I was interested in finding out why farmers were becoming liable for penalties and what was the source of the non-compliance.  If we had a record of that information, matters could be rectified in future.
3363	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	544	 How many did not submit payment claims or did so late?

3367	SeanSherlock	Labour	13658.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-04-29 00:00:00	Prelude	562	 I should say at the outset that Cobh community hospital is a facility that is very well-regarded by the people of Cobh.  I have been asked by my Labour Party colleagues on Cobh Town Council to raise this issue as a matter of urgency because there is a situation whereby the National Treatment Purchase Fund has taken over the fair deal scheme as it relates to Cobh hospital.  That will have serious permutations for the cost per patient per week in that it is stated that the possible drop in fees from €1,200 to €800 per bed per week could result in a serious deficit.  Obviously a deficit in funding would have an impact on the ability of the patients to remain within the hospital in the first instance, but also severely impact on the hospital's ability to take in new patients. It is a 38-bed hospital and there are approximately 40 staff.  What goes to the heart of this is the issue whereby care for our older people who are in community-based facilities is being eroded by this Government through a process of stealth.  The Government's model of health care is about rolling back the State and these wonderful community-based facilities so that they may be completely and utterly subsumed into a private nursing home model, thereby rolling back the stakesholdings that communities have within these hospitals which make them the excellent facilities they are.  It is all being done under the wonderful guise of HIQA rules and the fact that these institutions are older.  Anything that is deemed to be older in this new paradigm we have with this Government is deemed not to be of sufficient standard. I want to speak for hospitals such as Cobh, the welfare home in Youghal and Nazareth House in Mallow, all of which provide an excellent standard of care, but are now under threat because of the new rules that have come into play through the fair deal scheme and the new punishing HIQA standards.  All I want to do here is make the case for Cobh community hospital, in that it is an excellent facility.  There is a significant buy-in from the people of Cobh into this hospital.  The staff coterie is very loyal to the hospital.  The patients there are happy, and I would hope the Government ensures the continuation of this hospital in perpetuity, especially for the older people of Cobh who will use it, hopefully, into the future.

The Labour Party supports the Bill which we believe is predicated on common sense, does what it says on the tin and is unambiguous in what it seeks to do, that is, decriminalise certain transgressions under the law.  For Fianna Fáil to suggest somehow that any amendment to the current position would wreak havoc on the sustainability of the future of the industry is, to be frank, patronising to the thousands of fishing families who seek to make a living from this industry.  It is quite patronising to the person who has taken the time to do the research and come before this House, and, in a genuine sense, who seeks to provide a solution to a problem the House has been debating since 2005. I have examined the historical debates and it has to be stated, as a matter of fact, that the committees dealing with this matter had a very united view.  There was cross-party support for an amendment to the legislation in order that one would not criminalise a person, as Deputy Sheahan has pointed out.  Such a person would not be brought before the courts if he or she was 4 kg over a quota.  That is the type of ludicrous situation which Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill seeks to address.  That is fair. In examining the Commission's Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, it states that a minuscule amount, as I understand it, is afforded to fisheries protection.  I agree the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is needed, but there is a perception that the authority is not working in partnership or in tandem with the fishing organisations or the fishermen themselves.  It is perceived, on the quay sides, as being against these people.  I will speak about that in greater detail later. I also wish to address the remarks of the Minister of State.  I do not understand the logic behind the following comment: I am not convinced, unfortunately, that this Bill would contribute positively to the rebuilding of fish stocks.  Quite the opposite, in fact, my belief is that it could result in increasing the level of illegal fishing and further drive down the biomass of fish stocks leading to a collapse of many of the key commercial stocks around the coast on which our fishing industry is so dependent. There is an assumption in that comment that if the current provisions whereby a man who overfishes by 4 kg is not subjected to the potential for administrative sanctions or sanctions before a court are changed or amended in any way, such a man will fish at a level of 200 kg over quota the following day.  There is an underlying assumption that if some of the sanctions are amended or softened, the fishing industry and all those who own vessels will err on the side of criminality or will flout the law. It is true that some have transgressed and should be subject to the full rigours of the law.  However, for Fianna Fáil and the Government to suggest that any amendment would lead to a serious undermining and depletion of our fish stocks and would have an effect on sustainability is over-egging the pudding. In his speech the Minister of State remarked in respect of France that all member states, including Ireland, were under close scrutiny by the Commission.  He further remarked that in the case of France, in 2005 the European Court of Justice imposed a fine of €20 million together with a fine of €57.8 million for every month until the appropriate level of regulation was applied to its fishing industry.  Did the Minister of State contextualise that statement?  Did he state how much the fishing industry is worth to France?  Did he state what percentage that fine was relative to the overall industry in France?  Common sense dictates that fines of €20 million and €57.8 million are a drop in the ocean by comparison with what the industry is worth to France.  It could not care less about sanctions.  Few fishermen in France are subject to the equivalent of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority entering and confiscating their boats and bringing them up before the civil courts within two or three weeks or subject to files going to the French DPP or the Attorney General.  That is simply not the case in France but if the Minister of State can prove otherwise I would be pleased to hear it.  It is a matter of relativity.  We are all aware there are fishermen who are no saints; it is well documented.  However, if the Government is going to give us an argument against proposed legislation, at least it should give us something factual, not something out of context. There is also the issue of proportionality to which the Minister of State referred in his speech.  He stated that successive fisheries Ministers have seriously considered the imposition of administrative sanctions following representations and that on a number of occasions the advice of successive Attorneys General has been sought in relation to this approach.  He further stated that the legal advice was that imposing sanctions such as those set out in the Fine Gael Bill would undermine the existing legislative framework, allowing offenders to avoid the very serious penalties, prosecution and forfeiture of gear by payment of a fine of €1,000 or less.  However, the Bill clearly states there is no reason one cannot go after those persons who flout the law, who are repeat offenders and who have been in breach on successive occasions.  It is still possible to impose the full rigours of the law and I do not understand why the Minister of State cannot apply the same logic here to the situation that applies to those who use quads on the mountains, to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred.  I believe this point is worthy of a response by the Government. As I understand the Bill, it allows for a scenario whereby an element of discretion is applied.  If someone seriously flouts the law, one can bring that person before the court.  However, where a person exceeds the limit of 4 kg, for example, which has happened, one does not apply the full rigours of the law because it is such a small administrative mistake or transgression and therefore common sense applies.  I do not understand the Government's position in this regard. We support the Bill.  It has been discussed at cross-party level and at committee in the past.  There has been agreement and I do not understand why the current situation prevails in the House.  It speaks to the culture in this House as well, and it speaks volumes about why people outside the House are so cynical when one position is taken outside and inside the House, but then a person votes in a different way.  It feeds into the cynicism about politicians when we give rich tea and sympathy to a position but then vote against it when it comes to the substance of the matter. We agree there can be no doubt but that better enforcement is necessary for more effective fisheries management systems.  Questions arise in our mind in respect of criminal sanctions and an equitable way of dealing with non-compliance of fisheries management systems.  If the figures are to be believed, the marine sector yields an annual turnover of almost €3 billion and supports 44,000 jobs.  These figures are supplied by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority 2007 report.  If we are to believe it, then we must examine in greater detail where sanctions should be applied. We all agree that any illegal activity that endangers the fish stocks of this island must be punished.  When speaking to the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill in 2005, my colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, stated the most effective route for implementing a workable and successful means of control seems to be to impose harsh criminal penalties only on the most persistent and extreme offenders, which corresponds with the point I made earlier.  This Bill allows for such a mechanism.  The Labour Party believed strongly then, as now, that other breaches should be dealt with by mechanisms such as administrative penalties, on-the-spot fines and a transparent and predictable points system on licences similar to that which applies to owners of motor vehicles found to be transgressing the law. An amount of consternation exists among Irish fishermen about the role of the SFPA.  There is a perception among fishermen that they come under greater scrutiny from the authority's officers and that non-Irish vessels are left off the hook.  We should examine this in greater detail.  On page 27 of the authority's 2007 report there is a reference to the number of instances where legal action is taken by the SFPA against Irish vessels.  Of the 99 cases in which legal action was required, some 23 were referred to the Attorney General's office, 52 written warnings were issued and 24 detention orders were made.  There were 99 cases from 19,174 landings in 2007.  These figures may have been updated since.  Let us compare this to the figures for non-Irish vessels.  In 2007, there were 1,465 landings and 1,351 inspections whereupon enforcement was taken in 42 cases.  Of the 42 cases, some 18 resulted in detention orders, warning letters accounted for 23 cases and one file was sent to the Attorney General.  We must speak to relativity because when we compare the number of inspections of Irish to non-Irish vessels we must factor in the number of landings as well.  Perhaps this addresses Deputy Sheahan's earlier point.  In essence, based on these figures it could be argued there is no evidence to suggest Irish owners are scrutinised more.  However, I am certain that the fishermen's organisations would have a strong view on the matter and such data should be scrutinised independently.  The essential point is that of the legal actions taken, the vast bulk are administrative in nature.  However, there is little or no analysis provided by the SFPA as to the nature of those administrative and detention-related sanctions.  The Bill, rightly, points out that ""the sea fishing community in Ireland has been aggrieved at the use of onerous criminal penalties to control even minor breaches of technical regulations"".  This is the essence of the Bill and it is on this basis we support it."

Deputy Charles Flanagan has summed up the issue well.  We must prevent situations where the cost of recovery of the fine exceeds the fine itself.  It would be dangerous to allow that type of culture to emerge.  Seanad amendment No. 35 is quite vague in this regard, indicating that the Minister may specify the ""rates at which fees that may be so deducted shall be calculated"".  There must be clarity in order to prevent the system being undermined in any way."
3393	SeanSherlock	Labour	13679.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-20 00:00:00	Prelude	369	 In fairness, we must acknowledge a decent Bill when it comes before us.  We in the Labour Party sought to ensure that the Minister would take into account a person's earnings and means when making a decision on imprisonment.  I am glad that has happened. I take the Minister's point about the small percentage of those who are in prison as a result of non-payment of fines.  However, this Bill is only one part of a jigsaw that needs to be examined, because the overall prison service must also be examined.  The recent departure of Kathleen McMahon and John Lonergan is significant and we must take cognisance of what Ms McMahon was saying in respect of the governance procedures that dictate how the prison system is run. There is an issue of overcrowding and there are scenarios where we have three or four people in a cell.  The former governor of Mountjoy Prison has spoken extensively about the humane treatment of prisoners.  The idea of a prisoner slopping out in this day and age is ludicrous.  If we take the Fines Bill as one part of the jigsaw, then there is no doubt that we will have fewer people in prison as a result of this legislation, which is welcome.  However, common sense must speak to the issue of overcrowding in prisons and the governance procedures for the prison service.  We need to ask whether somebody like Ms Kathleen McMahon could have stayed within the system if she had been allowed a greater deal of autonomy to allow her to progress the agenda upon which she had embarked.  There is also the issue of the Dóchas centre.  There is overcrowding and there seems to be a shortage of prison places.  The Minister recently stated in this House that Kilworth prison is still on the agenda.  In real terms there is no sign of that prison and the creation of extra places.  A wider debate needs to take place on this issue.  We support the Bill, which we hope will reduce the number of people in prison.  We hope a qualitative and quantitative approach taken to how the prison system is run. Seanad amendments reported.

3401	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	388	 I welcome the Minister's response and I am seeking to ascertain definitively whether he is giving any credence to the idea of introducing a de facto minimum income for every farmer so as to buttress against potential market instability in the future.  The recent volatility in the dairy sector showed us, along with other factors, just how volatile farm incomes are at present and the fact that there will have to be an EU-wide response to this. What I am really trying to ascertain is whether the Minister is giving credence to the notion of a minimum payment for farmers and, if so, whether there is EU-wide support for such a measure.
3402	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	390	 The Minister mentions the historical model of payments, and I acknowledge the speech he gave to the Seanad recently in which he expressed a preference for the retention of this model.  What I took from that speech, however, was that the historical model would come under increasing attack and that it is not guaranteed into the future.  That is the basis upon which the Minister could state, at least, that there is a degree of stability of income, but it is not necessarily guaranteed to continue if the model changes, unless the Minister states otherwise.  If the historical model changes, will that compromise basic incomes to farmers?
3403	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	411	 The Minister's reply is taken directly from a recent speech he gave to the Seanad.  The own initiative report on this issue was authored by Mr. George Lyon, MEP, a Liberal Democrat representative for Scotland, whose party is a member of the same group within the European Parliament as Fianna Fáil.  Mr. Lyon refers to the desire to go beyond 2020 for phasing in the move from historic to area-based payments and to significant differences in terms of the criteria to be used for the distribution of single farm payments to member states.  As far as he is concerned, it is a foregone conclusion that the historical model will be no more.  I acknowledge the Minister's point that there is increasing pressure for that to occur. If it is a foregone conclusion that the majority of member states will seek to move away from the historical model of payments, then what is the current thinking within the Fianna Fáil group in the European Parliament as to what will be the replacement?  Is Mr. Lyon speaking for all Fianna Fáil Members of the European Parliament when he speaks about a movement towards area-based payments?

It is on this basis that I give great credence to what he is saying because it could be reflective of the position of the group within the European Parliament to which he belongs.
3406	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I accept what the Minister is saying about the political considerations but I am sure he will acknowledge that George Lyon's position on this issue will be very influential in terms of the final outcome.  I also acknowledge that there are approximately 700 amendments to that particular report currently before the European Parliament. The key for us at this stage of the process is to try to nail down a more definitive Government position, that is, to ascertain whether the Minister has come to a conclusion regarding the new system for payments for farmers post 2013.  If I understand him correctly the Minister is saying that is an ongoing process and if that is the case, I accept that answer.
3407	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	444	 If we take the three fundamental pillars that will underpin CAP, namely, water management, biodiversity and climate change, an issue will arise regarding the whole pillar of rural development and whether income will be taken from direct payments to farmers and housed in a rural development pillar, which could see it going into an administrative function through various local bodies and development organisations.  Does the Minister have a view on that at this stage?  Has a clear Government position evolved on that aspect?  Would the Minister acknowledge that there are reservations by farm organisations on the matter on the basis that they would not wish to see income being diversified into that area at the risk that it could go down the so-called administrative black hole?
3408	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	454	 If one's solution is to reduce the number of cattle, it is a simplistic way of looking at the problem and one is not looking at the problem of GHGs properly.  That is a scientific view. I would refer the Minister of State to TResearch, which is a Teagasc publication in this regard.  Perhaps he might acknowledge that looking at the areas of animal genetics, animal management, animal nutrition and performance stimulants would  be a better way to reduce GHGs like methane and that there is a scientific basis for doing that.  Would he acknowledge that any proposals to implement the McCarthy report as it pertains to the scientific budget would have an impact on Teagasc’s operations and on reducing methane emissions potentially in the long run?  We need to take a more lateral view.

What is the exact timeframe for the Minister to conclude schemes for dairy hygiene, sheep fencing and water harvesting?  On what date will those schemes come into effect?
3411	SeanSherlock	Labour	13685.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	572	 This issue boils down to some simple facts.  Fermoy Town Council has been instructed to fix a fish pass on the River Blackwater in Fermoy to adhere to an edict from the European Commission handed down on foot of a complaint by persons or bodies unknown on the matter of the impediment to fish swimming up river west of Fermoy.  The local council does not have the means to pay for the repair of the fish pass, which is protected and which the council owns.  The estimated cost of repair is €100,000.  The Department is unwilling to cover the cost of the repairs.  Last Christmas, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, gave Fermoy Town Council until the end of 2010 to repair the damaged fish pass at Fermoy weir to become compliant on foot of the complaint to the EU Commission. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board, which may or may not have been the originators of the complaint and which favours the replacement of the weir with a rock ramp pass, when asked through a freedom of information request about its involvement in the matter informed the secretary of the rowing club, Mr. Donal O'Keeffe, that old files were destroyed in a flood in 2009.  In the meantime, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, informed Fermoy Rowing Club last week that he is deeply concerned no progress has been made in the past six months.  He went on to indicate that the rock ramp would definitely happen if Fermoy Town Council does not repair the fish pass.  When informed that the council has no money to effect these repairs, the Minister of State made it clear it is the duty of Fermoy Town Council, as owners of the weir, a protected structure, to find the money somewhere.  The Minister said that he cannot give them money towards the cost of repairs to the fish pass.  However, the Government, of which the Minister is a member, is willing spend a multiple of €100,000 in order to install a rock ramp pass at the behest of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. Incidentally, there is no indication that the EU Commission has instructed the Government to install a rock ramp pass but it was satisfied that the repair of the fish pass was sufficient.  In the meantime, we still do not know how many salmon are moving up river, because there is no fish counter in Fermoy town. We all want to see fish being caught on the rod, and I do not particularly wish to see the Duke of Devonshire taking the lion's share of the spoils below in Clondulane weir, but we must ensure that there is a balance struck between ensuring that fish have safe passage and guarding the future of the rowing club. Let the Government assist with the cost of the repair of the fish pass and install a fish counter in Fermoy.  Let common sense prevail.

This co-ordination occurs through a network of 89 Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) posts, including 12 Senior SENO positions based in over 40 NCSE offices throughout the State. SENOs are employed by the NCSE. The NCSE is also responsible for the deployment of SENOs.  I understand that there has been a SENO vacancy in the area referred to by the Deputy, arising from a resignation in August 2009. The NCSE has advised my Department that it arranges for appropriate cover in circumstances where SENO vacancies arise.

3446	SeanSherlock	Labour	13706.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	567	 I will start by nailing the lie that is coming from the Fianna Fáil benches in regard to the Labour Party and any policies it may or may not have.  I invite Deputies McGrath, Collins and Byrne to take a look at the Labour Party website.  Therein they will see at least 50 position and policy papers on a wide range of subjects from tourism right through the economy.  I invite them, in particular, to take a look at the Labour Party proposals on the creation of a strategic investment bank that will get this economy up and running again.
3447	SeanSherlock	Labour	13706.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	570	 It will create wealth and jobs and will be used in a manner which is productive and will grow the economy, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and can be used effectivity to get this economy up and running again.  I want to nail this lie which is now emerging from Fianna Fáil that somehow we are a party which is devoid of policies.  It is an insult to the intelligence of anybody in the Labour Party who put their names to a ballot paper because it suggests somehow that we were devoid of any kind of substance politically before we ever decided to enter politics We have always been a policy-driven party.  I invite people to take a look at our record in terms of our involvement in this House down through the years and ages.  The record will speak for itself on that matter.  When we are in Government the people of this country will see that we will do our best for them and will not be pandering to vested interests. On the reports, nobody, including me who is on my first mandate, had perfect knowledge on the fateful night of September on the Government's position or the true picture of where the banks stood.  It is right and proper that when we are legislating in this House that every single Deputy who is given a mandate in this House has perfect knowledge.  It is very clear now — we do not seek to take political advantage from it — that the guarantee which was given on that night was too wide-ranging.  It was too big a blanket, in terms of how it covered the individual banks. Anybody who examines the reports in any objective fashion will see that it was too wide ranging.  Anybody who is an ordinary decent citizen of this land will see that the cost of covering Anglo Irish Bank has been €22 billion so far, if I am not mistaken. The €22 billion spent thus far is money that the next Government will be down in terms of being able to provide services to the ordinary decent citizens of this country.  Fianna Fáil Deputies will be lambasting us from the other side of the House for not delivering services because we will be down €22 billion.  This is Fianna Fáil's classic game.  It is acting as surreptitiously as possible and is spinning the story that winding down the bank in an orderly manner will cost a multiple of €22 billion, even though we do not know that for certain.
3448	SeanSherlock	Labour	13706.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	572	 We want transparency so that every citizen, regardless of his or her political affiliation, can decide whether the Government of the day is doing a decent job. These independent reports clearly have not vindicated the Government's position.  Their criticism of past macro-economic policy and the over reliance on tax breaks is as clear as the nose on my face.  The bottom line is good governance in the banks, a proper regulatory framework and a public inquiry that allows us to understand the relationship between politics and banking so that we can develop legislation that ensures the chicanery we have become used to over the past decade will be no more.

3450	SeanSherlock	Labour	13706.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	489	 I must advise you that the selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. My role as Minister does not involve me identifying specific placements for individual children, but requires me to provide for Education by providing grants and funding for buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers, as well as the recognition of qualifications and inspection of facilities. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The National Educational Welfare Board will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) can also assist parents with regard to education services for persons with special educational needs. Where a child is without a school placement, Home Tuition support may be provided to parents to assist in providing for their child's education, as an interim measure, pending the sourcing of a school place. I am advised that in this instance, that a grant of nine hours per week for Home Tuition has been provided by the Department for the periods, during school term time, that the child has been without a school placement and that there has been no reduction in the number of tuition hours.

Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. My role as Minister does not involve me identifying specific placements for individual children, but requires me to provide for Education by providing grants and funding for buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers, as well as the recognition of qualifications and inspection of facilities. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The National Educational Welfare Board will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) can also assist parents with regard to education services for persons with special educational needs. Where a child is without a school placement, Home Tuition support may be provided to parents to assist in providing for their child's education, as an interim measure, pending the sourcing of a school place. I am advised that in this instance, that a grant of nine hours per week for Home Tuition has been provided by the Department for the periods, during school term time, that the child has been without a school placement and that there has been no reduction in the number of tuition hours.

3461	SeanSherlock	Labour	13713.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	496	 Our motion seeks to build the capacity of the tourism product and to take a more lateral view of its potential to create wealth and jobs and sustaining communities.  No longer can we rely solely on the US dollar and the busloads of Americans that graced traditional hotspots like Killarney and Bunratty.  We must diversify the product range.  The Labour Party motion, under the stewardship of Deputy Upton, seeks to develop Ireland's capacity as an eco-tourism destination. One of Ireland's natural advantages is the unspoiled 3,500 miles of coastline.  It is so indented that one is never more than 80 miles from the sea.  Add to this the 800 lakes and rivers.  Paddle sports like sea kayaking and river kayaking are, as yet, an untapped potential.  While organisations such as the Irish Sea Kayaking Association, ISKA, are active in promoting these sports, the time is right for them to be included in a new consultative process that develops capacity in this area. We have underestimated the potential for eco-tourism, particularly as a maritime nation.  The report of the tourism renewal group recognises the need for domestic marketing.  It states: Domestic demand has a vital role in helping enterprises survive the current international downturn and particularly the current negative impact of the sterling exchange rate on our largest and nearest market.  Similar arguments apply to the economic rationale for domestic as to international marketing. Domestic destinations compete directly with overseas destinations for Irish tourists. We take a more lateral view than that articulated in the review in respect of the marketing target.  Ireland always seems to tailor its product towards the UK or North American market.  The Labour Party believes that, in order to build the capacity of the tourism product, we must move away from the narrow focus of selling, for example, a weekend by the lakes of Killarney, although there is a market segment for that product.  We need to examine minority sports such as kayaking and develop them into segments. Given our natural environment and easy access to the sea, an eco-tourism product is there to be developed.  To assist this process, we must build a stakeholder model that allows groups such as the ISKA, which has led expeditions all over the world, to develop a product to encourage kayakers to visit this country.  Such organisations have the necessary contacts, intelligence gathering and viral networks to assist in creating a domestic and international product that will bring people to our shores.  I refer to sea-kayaking but we can develop a model for other such niche ecotourism products like surfing, mountaineering and hill-walking.  The idea is to bring these people in as part of the stakeholder process. These people have the necessary contacts on the international stage.  I have sea-kayaked and gone mountaineering in other parts of the world.  One does this through building up contacts through membership of various organisations.  We need to bring these people together as part of a stakeholder group to develop the product domestically and use those contacts in the existing marketing framework to slowly develop the markets we need in order to bring people to our shores.  This is taking a more lateral view of building products in niche areas.  That is the future for the specific ecotourism product this country has the potential to develop.

In her reply, the Minister stated an emergency is determined by the treating clinician, the contracted general dental practitioner, in agreement with the local HSE.  Dentists throughout the country are trying to provide emergency treatment under this scheme for people with severe disabilities and people with other conditions, such as a person with Alzheimer's disease in a case of which I am aware.

3473	SeanSherlock	Labour	13714.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	511	 I appreciate the time yielded to me by Fine Gael on this issue.  In the short time available to me, I do not intend to go into some of the comments I have just heard.  I have no intention of personalising this issue even though people have referred to me and to my colleagues.  In the view of the Labour Party, the bottom line is whether this legislation is necessary at present, whether it is purely politically motivated or whether it is based on true animal welfare.  In 2007, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which, unless I am mistaken, he placed 27 conditions.  In 2008, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which 34 conditions were placed.  In 2009, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt, unless I am mistaken, on which he placed 35 conditions. If one speaks to the rights of man, common sense or a man's motivation, if at that time, he as Minister issued a licence for that hunt to proceed, surely that includes a tacit understanding that he recognised its right to exist as a hunt?
3474	SeanSherlock	Labour	13714.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	513	 Why is he now moving, in 2010, to revoke the licence?  It is bad legislation——
3475	SeanSherlock	Labour	13714.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	515	 —— and the solution proposed by Deputy Higgins in 1997 was a reasoned, rational and responsible approach.
3476	SeanSherlock	Labour	13714.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	518	 The absolute fundamentalists who exist within this Parliament legislate on an absolutist approach.  It is the wrong way to do so because I foresee trouble ahead in respect of this legislation.  It is the wrong way to legislate.

3513	SeanSherlock	Labour	13721.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	459	 Is the Minister of State aware of the situation with the Midleton train at present?  If he wants to speak authoritatively, he should check his facts.
3514	SeanSherlock	Labour	13721.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	464	 The guidelines that are published are only guidelines.  When Deputy Batt O'Keeffe was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he published guidelines on the relaxation of rules for one-off houses in rural areas.  The guidelines that were issued stated councillors must have regard to development plans as they existed in local authority areas. However, the local development plan itself had very stringent rules and regulations on green belt areas, and certain types of designations for particular areas which superseded the guidelines themselves.  It did not make any change whatsoever to the number of one-off houses built as a result of the publication of those guidelines. Similarly, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, published guidelines last week — or gave notice of his intention to publish guidelines — on houses on national secondary routes.  I am aware of three cases of people who have a genuine housing need who wish to build on family owned land on a national secondary route.  I have regard to the guidelines published by the Minister but I am told by the local authority that the development plan, which was adopted by the members elected by the people will supersede those guidelines.  There is a precedent whereby a local authority granted planning on a national secondary route and it was appealed by the NRA to An Bord Pleanála in any case. The issuance of guidelines is a bit of a sham to be honest.  Sometimes, they are deliberately put out there by Ministers to give voice to the idea that they are somehow dealing with an issue.  In reality, I have never seen them have an effect in how they are transposed.  The local development plan as passed under a reserve function always seems to take precedent. In essence, the point I am trying to make is that if we further diminish the power of local public representatives to intervene in planning cases or in the planning laws, too much power will be ceded to the Minister who may not have regard to local factors and the grey area that exists which might push a case one way or the other.  If too much power is prescribed in a centralised way it will have a negative impact on the ability of a local authority to function as it relates to planning, and good planning at that. I fail to understand the Green Party's position on this.  I state respectfully and without any malice that what Deputy Gogarty is saying in effect is that the gentlemen and ladies on local authorities have received their democratic mandates from the people but the Green Party does not trust them to exercise that mandate as it relates to the planning process and therefore it will instigate a set of rules and regulations that will supersede their powers.  By implication, what is stated is that the people are wrong.  The people put in the councillors and therefore there is an implication in the legislation that the councillors made mistakes and the Green Party will come along and rectify those mistakes in a condescending and patronising fashion.

However, with privilege I stand before the people here as a Member for Cork East and I will not allow other Members to debase the House's legislative programme by imposing legislation that is undemocratic and will have serious permutations for how local authorities will be able to operate because it gives too much power to the Minister.  I say that without use of bad language, without debasing the House and without bringing the debate down into the morass to which others would like to bring it.
3522	SeanSherlock	Labour	13721.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	853	" I wish to raise an issue which I feel will have a deep impact on the ability of hospitals like Mallow General Hospital to deliver acute services. For the past five years we have been through a number of processes in relation to Mallow General Hospital, including the Horwath, Wrixon and Teamwork reviews.  Now, through a new national reconfiguration process, the HSE will seek, in an underhand and surreptitious way, to undermine the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services. I have before me a document in respect of this matter.  The people who represent the interests of the hospital and who live within its catchment area are undergoing a reconfiguration process, headed up by Professor John Higgins.  There is general agreement that change is needed within the hospital and that there will be implications for the delivery of acute services, but that the capacity of the hospital should not be undermined in any way.  In other words, if there is to be a loss or diminution of acute surgical services, they would be buttressed by acute medical services. We have bought into that process and have been given assurances in relation to it.  We now discover documentation emanating from the HSE showing that it seeks to assign to every hospital in the country a new modelling system ranging from 1 to 4, depending on the category of hospital, and which will put Mallow into the No. 2 category.  The document states that this hospital will not have an ICU so the patients and doctors need to be made aware that the resources are not in place to provide the full spectrum of an acute hospital resuscitation, that is, intubation, ventilation and resuscitation, IVR.  The patient must give informed consent and have knowledge of this prior to admission.  A ceiling of care discussion needs to take place and be documented with appropriate patients prior to admission to this facility.  The document goes on to say that standards of care should be measured and comparable to those delivered at a model 3 and model 4 hospital.  A model 3 or 4 hospital would be the equivalent of Cork University Hospital, which is a tertiary centre and the nearest geographically to Mallow. I demand a meeting with Mr. Pat Healy, regional director of operations for the HSE south region.  I demand respectfully, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member, a meeting with Ms Laverne McGuinness and Mr. Brian Gilroy, who are in charge of efficiencies, and I demand that the Joint Committee on Health and Children discuss this document because it will have serious implications for the delivery of acute care.  By a surreptitious and secretive method, the HSE will seek to diminish the ability of Mallow to deliver acute care.  If a ceiling of care discussion has to take place on every admission, most people will not be admitted to the hospital and will have to go to CUH, thereby reducing the ability of Mallow General Hospital to deliver services. There are many scenarios where resuscitation might be appropriate for an individual on whom a ""do not resuscitate"" order has been placed, for example, anaphylactic reaction to an infusion.  Such a notion has major consequences for the status and reputation of a hospital and for the esteem of those working there.  Discussion about ceilings of care as espoused in this process is, in most clinical situations, unnecessary and often inappropriate and counter-productive.  I wonder if dividing patients into categories of access with regard to resuscitation is unconstitutional, in that it would negate the rights of a patient. Numbers in the hospital would be so reduced that it would not be viable.  That is what is at play here.  This is an attempt by the HSE at national level to undermine the local reconfiguration process which all of the stakeholders have bought into.  We recognise that change is needed but it seems the HSE is trying push through a plan whereby hospitals like Mallow will no longer be able to provide acute care, whether medical or surgical, and the 4,500 people who are served in an acute setting in Mallow will have make their way through CUH, which does not have the capacity to deliver those services because the capital investment has not been made there. We need transparency.  I am asking, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member representing the people of Cork East, for a meeting with the HSE at national level so that I can learn what plans are afoot and what surreptitious methods are being employed in the downgrading of hospitals like Mallow."

3533	SeanSherlock	Labour	13728.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	290	 The Labour Party seeks, by way of amendment, to ensure the Act does not apply to any matter regulated by the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.  We believe strongly that if we are to support the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, it must be on the basis that there is a clear and unambiguous attempt by the stakeholders in the greyhound industry in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure the code of practice put in place to ensure the welfare of the greyhounds is maintained. I speak on behalf of the smaller breeders; these are the people I represent.  The situation at present is such that when one visits a stud dog with a bitch with the intention of breeding a litter, the fact is publicised in the sporting press immediately.  When pups are born one notifies the ICC, Irish Coursing Club, within 14 days.  Details of date of birth and size of litter are published in the sporting press.  The bitch can be inspected anytime during this period.  The control steward inspects the pups and takes a DNA sample.  At 12 weeks old, the control steward tattoos the full litter on both ears; the left ear with a personal identification number and the right ear with the litter number.  Before they are 12 months old, the pups are officially named and their markings entered into their identity cards.  These are the current procedures as they stand. I am in favour of field sports and coursing and I have been at greyhound meetings.  The people I represent are those who rear pups.  They do not consider that the establishments or kennels they have are dog breeding establishments.  They are genuine people who have a genuine regard for field sports and for the welfare of the animals they keep.  For the most part, they are not in it for the primary motivation of profit, in the sense of developing breeding establishments.  The gain for such people is a potential win at such a venue as Clonmel or Youghal and for the love of the sport.  There is no fiduciary gain for the most part.  Most of these people have been involved in the sport at an intergenerational level.  If a book were kept of their expenses, one could be guaranteed that they have made a loss during the years they have been involved in the sport.  The primary motivation is not profit but a love of the pursuit of the sport.  It is genuine and integral for these people.  It is an affront to insult these people with some of the language I have heard from various sides of the House and we must speak for them.  We wish to speak for them in a modest and reasonable way.

If Members are being asked to pass this legislation, I would like to know more about the substantive nature of those negotiations, the qualitative and quantitative outcomes of those deliberations, and if we are to have regard and to have trust in the Minister or the Government of the day to deliver the right kind of amendments to the 1958 Act.

I am sure the Minister agrees with our line of questioning in that we are merely seeking clarification.  We seek clarification on the negotiations with the ICC and Bord na gCon regarding the role of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food vis-à-vis the amended 1958 legislation.  The second point concerns how specifically that Act will be amended. The animal welfare Bill is under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  On no fewer than ten occasions, the Labour Party has asked the Taoiseach when that legislation will be published.  We do not have a Bill before us even though we are told it will be published in the autumn.  If this is on the C list of the Government's legislative programme, where is the balance of priorities and how does the Minister envisage its implementation?  Will legislation enacted now be superseded by that legislation or is it separate?  It is very confusing.  I am relatively new to this game but I am trying to speak with common sense.  With respect to the Minister, all I seek from him are some clear unambiguous answers to which Members are entitled.

3541	SeanSherlock	Labour	13728.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	405	" I wish to refer to the Minister's Second Stage speech where he stated: I have also stated that I understand the legitimate concerns of certain industry sectors, such as the Irish Greyhound Board, and I am prepared to accommodate them as best I can.  For that reason it is proposed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would amend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to legislate for welfare provisions for members of the Irish Greyhound Board. We note the words ""welfare provisions"".  Given that the Minister has stated that it is not possible to give an indication today of what will be in the amended legislation, which we accept to a certain extent, in order to ensure that there is no ambiguity and so that the greyhound industry is not placed in a position where it is taking a giant leap of faith in terms of what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food might offer by way of the amended legislation, we propose an amendment that would make it clear and unambiguous as to where the Minister's intentions lie.  If he were to support the amendment that would give great solace to the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club and to every single dog owner throughout the country who courses hares or races greyhounds in such places as Curraheen Park and Youghal."

3551	SeanSherlock	Labour	13811.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	764	 On 9 August, when the Dáil was in recess, HIQA announced an investigation into ongoing services at Mallow General Hospital.  Tonight I want to put forward the views of those I represent who have a particular interest in the investigation and who felt strongly that it was spurious and unnecessary. The investigation was announced on the basis of a specific complaint about procedures from someone at the hospital.  We now know that was not the case, and know there was no specific incident related to the treatment of a person.  We also know the investigation arose from the fact that in April 2009, HIQA published the report of the investigation into the quality and safety or services in Ennis, that there would be recommendations arising from that, and that a report would follow for Mallow, which was a similar hospital but that had never been put forward by the HSE.  It was on foot of that alone that HIQA decided to go into Mallow General Hospital. The process at present is that HIQA has met representatives of the hospital and the staff and is continuing its investigations.  The staff at the hospital operate in constrained circumstances and are punching above their weight.  In June, after many years of campaigning, an executive management board was finally put in place.  The hospital is under the auspices of CUH but for years it was left on its own, devoid of support from the larger hospital. I will bet money that when the report is published, it will clearly show that the staff and personnel at the hospital have delivered, in spite of the HSE bearing down on them while refusing to put in place adequate funding.  This report will vindicate the doctors, nurses and other staff in the hospital by showing they are in no way negligent and are doing more than they should to deliver services.  It will also show that management structures were inadequate and the HSE never properly resourced the administrative function at the hospital, which led to inadequacies in terms of reporting procedures.  It will also show that CUH never adequately recognised Mallow for the facility it is as part of its operation. I want to point out that the staff support the hospital and maintain that services can be modified.  They are willing to work with the HSE to achieve that and doctors, nurses and staff will buy into the change management process.  We do not want to see a reduced service facility, however, or to see the hospital's capacity being sacrificed on the HSE's altar of cost efficiency.  This is key because we will modify services but we must not reduce capacity.  We can deliver the services within the hospital but we must be given the opportunity to do so.

3553	SeanSherlock	Labour	13812.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	661	 Earlier today, Deputy Joan Burton stated the following: Today, we have been given more bad news about the two institutions to which I refer.  The Financial Times  states that the cost in respect of Anglo Irish Bank will be €35 billion and €5 billion for the tiny building society that is known as Irish Nationwide. That is the pass to which the Minister and his leader, the Taoiseach, have brought this country.  Today is black Thursday and the Minister and his party, Fianna Fáil, will be remembered for visiting it upon this country. I am an optimistic person by nature.  I came into this House in 2007 as an Opposition Deputy.  When my party, the Labour Party, is elected to govern this country, how will we get it out of the economic maelstrom in which we find ourselves?  To say it will be a Herculean task is to put it mildly. I listened intently to the contributions from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, which looked backwards in their analysis of the situation.  They do not give me grounds for optimism.  It was especially disheartening to hear someone of my own generation, Deputy Thomas Byrne, seeking to undermine the Labour Party as part of his contribution to a debate on the financial institutions as they are now.  When the Deputy referred to Labour's 2007 manifesto and the promises or aspirations contained therein, he neglected to mention that those promises and aspirations were based on figures that were then in the public domain.  The figures to which I refer were provided by the Department of Finance and the plans in the manifesto were costed in respect of the economic climate that obtained at that time.  It is not credible for a member of Fianna Fáil to attack the Labour Party for what has happened in the past two years, even if doing so is part of some defence mechanism. I have stated publicly on previous occasions that I have a great regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, particularly in the context of the depth of knowledge he possesses and the values he espouses.  However, the Minister of State indicated earlier that because Madame Christine Lagarde has bestowed her imprimatur on the strategy that has been adopted, this is somehow a justification——
3554	SeanSherlock	Labour	13812.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	663	" ——for that strategy.  Madame Lagarde is representative of the centre right in France and is a member of President Sarkozy's Government.  I would not be looking to France in search of a degree of comfort or solace with regard to this country's current economic position.  We are, however, very fortunate that we are part of the European Union and that we have access to the European Central Bank, ECB.  I suspect the latter shored up our position in respect of the bond issue in recent weeks.  I would be anxious to discover the degree to which the ECB intervened in this regard. There is no doubt that this is a black day.  However, I am moved to state that I am of a generation that benefited from the fact that, socially, politically and economically, Ireland looked outwards during the 1980s and 1990s.  We drew economic strength from the pooling of sovereignty that occurred with our European neighbours at that time.  As a result of this, people of my generation benefited by being able to travel, obtain an education and gain proper employment.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, we thought we could go it alone.  We became extremely greedy and selfish and began to look inwards again.  In order to claw our way out of the morass in which we find ourselves, we will be obliged to look outwards once again.  We must work with our European neighbours in order to find solutions to the economic problems that exist. I sat the leaving certificate in 1991.  I am of the generation which benefited from the abolition of university fees.  Many of the other members of my generation who also benefited in this way travelled the world for a number of years and returned to Ireland when the economic climate appeared brighter.  These people, some of whom are friends of mine, got married, had children and bought houses for astronomical prices.  It is our generation that will be obliged to pay for the profligacy and disastrous economic policies preferred by the so-called republican party. If it is given the opportunity to govern, the Labour Party, and people of my generation, will get us out of the morass to which I refer.  In the past it was the Labour Party which made the ultimate sacrifice.  During previous periods of severe economic difficulty, it was my party which took the tough decisions that were necessary to place the country back on an even keel.  The country has been holed below the water line but we are not beaten yet.  I refuse to be beaten.  I am of that generation of politicians whose members will be obliged to look not two or three but rather 20 years hence in order to identify how we want our society to develop.  We will be obliged to set down a formula to achieve our goals in this regard. The figures that emerged earlier today mean the next Government, of which I am sure Labour will be a part, will be at a disadvantage in the context of being able to repair the damage that has been done.  That is a message which must be put across.  We will not give up on the Irish people.  Although there is an air of despair and depression in this Parliament today, I can inform the Minister of State that we will fight with every fibre of our beings in order to try to claw our way out of our current difficulties.  The Irish people will do so because they are resourceful. Deputy Quinn referred to the time he spent as Minister for Finance.  When it is once again in government, the Labour Party will work to claw the country out of the mess in which it currently finds itself.  We may, as in the past, pay the ultimate price by losing the general election which follows.  However, we will do what is necessary because we are patriots.  We will not do what is required for personal gain, we will do it because we believe in this country and its people. It will take a great deal of time to do what needs to be done.  A message must be sent to the people that it will be the Labour Party that will rectify the problems caused by the policies that were followed during the past 13 years.  It will not be easy and the people know that.  What citizens want is some honesty.  If the Labour Party is honest and states that the next five years are going to be tough but that there will be a point below which no citizen will be permitted to fall, I am of the view that the people will give us the chance to do what is required.  That is all we are seeking. I wish to refer to an article by Colm Keena in The Irish Times on 21 September.  Mr. Keena reported that: The Governor of the Central Bank has indicated he believes the December budget should involve a package of cuts in excess of €3 billion so Ireland can keep reducing its deficit on track. Prof Patrick Honohan said yesterday the Government's multi-year plan for reducing the deficit needed ""explicit reprogramming"" and this was ""clearly necessary soon"".  He did not want to go into detail for any given year, but there was an overall need for reprogramming... If the economy stayed on track with what had been initially envisaged, the deficit would come close to 3 per cent by 2014.  ""But as the IMF and others have noted, the real economy, the price level and interest rates on Government borrowing have evolved in a less favourable way.  Servicing of the additional debt related to bank restructuring is also a negative factor."" With the passage of time, one comes to learn what is meant when language is used in a certain way.  The term ""explicit programming"" is code for stating that a deficit target of 3% by 2014 is just not tenable.  That is particularly true in light of the figures produced today.  Where does this leave us? Deputy Coveney brought some degree of realism to the debate by outlining an agreed approach in terms of how we might proceed.  I am sure the Deputy's thoughts in this regard are based on his experiences as an MEP.  In Europe, programmes are multi-annual in nature and there is a political consensus in respect of them.  We need to ensure that our European partners will allow for the fact that the banking crisis has cost us so much that any servicing of a deficit or any stimulus package will be a major challenge and that we need some degree of stability and political consensus as to how that might be reached.  An election tomorrow morning would clear the air and allow for an alternative government to be able to tell the people that we are starting on a new footing.  We could also say to our partners in the European Union and the European Commission that there is a new impetus as to how we can get ourselves out of the mess in which we find ourselves, but that it might take longer than the period envisaged in the target to reduce the deficit to less than the 3% by 2014. Ireland is a test bed and there is no paradigm for where we are at the moment.  Nobody in Europe can judge how this will pan out.  It would be fundamentally dishonest for me as a representative of the people of Cork East to say that I know exactly what the answers are because I do not.  I am trying to grapple with these figures and it is impossible.  It would be wrong of me to claim there is a model for where Ireland is now, which is why we need to work outwardly and why our membership of the European Union will ultimately be our saviour.  Many of my fellow citizens would claim that some of the blame for this should be laid at the door of Europe.  When people speak of Europe they do so as a concept that is somehow out there, but we are Europe.  While we may be on the periphery geographically, we are part of that decision-making process and we may need more help from our European neighbours to ensure that we can rebuild from the ashes of a republic that is in a terrible state at the moment. I believe in this republic and that we can find a way out of this.  We must not be afraid to take tough decisions to ensure our citizens have some hope for the future.  We should not give up or give in to a body such as the IMF.  Our sovereignty must mean something more than just an economic value.  We need to recreate the value systems or go back to previous value systems we had in this country and work in partnership with our European Union neighbours to look outwardly for some solution to the problems in which we find ourselves.  Now that the banking system has been brought into temporary public ownership it needs to go through a major overhaul.  The culture that exists, which has not changed since September 2008, must be revisited.  If the guarantee that was provided in 2008 has not changed the banking culture and people in the real economy are still suffering owing to lack of credit, then given that we have taken these banks into temporary public ownership we should do whatever we deem necessary on behalf of the people to ensure those banks are functioning as they should and we should make no apology for that.  We have been too deferential to the banking moguls here. I have searched the Statute Book to ascertain whether it would be possible to bring these guys out in handcuffs and do the perp walk as famously mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  I know a change in the Constitution and a change in law would be required to effect that.  How many of them have been arrested and brought before the courts for threatening the very sovereignty of the State?  The silver-haired foxes in the Department of Finance and those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House have left the people of my generation and the people of the generation to come after me with an albatross of debt around their necks.  Fianna Fáil politicians have the temerity to come out and attack the Labour Party.  What is patriotism?  They are not patriots and never were.  They are self-interested and always were."

We support that very notion.  In regard to the reconfiguration process, in particular as it pertains to hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital, there is often the accusation that we are being overtly parochial.  It must be remembered that a hospital like Mallow General Hospital will serve more than 100,000 people and will have approximately 100 GPs referring to it. Mallow General Hospital is under the umbrella of Cork University Hospital but there is a deficiency in that Cork University Hospital has never viewed Mallow General Hospital as being under its umbrella or its ambit.  The Health Information and Quality Authority is in the hospital currently.  A case is being made in regard to Mallow General Hospital by all of the stakeholders, including the hospital representative groups, the GPs and the consultants, that we will accept changes.  We accept change management and that there are budgetary constraints but we want a more lateral view to be taken by the HSE in regard to the future capacity of Mallow General Hospital. We will accept changes in regard to Mallow General Hospital but one can do that and save money without reducing capacity.  What is needed is for the sister hospital, Cork University Hospital, and the HSE to think more laterally about how they deploy resources from the centre to the margins to serve this community such that one does not have a bottleneck effect, that is, a reduction of capacity in Mallow General Hospital filtering through to Cork University Hospital and thereby undermining the capacity which will not be there because the budgetary provision will not be made to allow for increased capacity at Cork University Hospital. We speak common sense.  Large swathes of the population are served by the hospitals mentioned in the motion.  We noted that Mallow General Hospital was not mentioned in the Fine Gael motion but I am sure that was an oversight on its part.  We speak for those hospitals and support the motion in that regard.

Can the Tánaiste indicate when the animal health and welfare Bill will be introduced?  I find it strange that it is not possible to indicate the position with that Bill because commitments were given on this legislation. There are 250,000 workers who are party to defined benefit pension schemes.  They face a nightmare in terms of the returns from such schemes.  Could time be made available to the House to discuss this issue because many of the schemes are underperforming?  This is a vital issue so we should arrange a debate in this House or a discussion with the Pensions Board on the funding of those schemes.
3568	SeanSherlock	Labour	13819.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	180	 The main objectives of the Rural Development Programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy, and the individual measures under the Programme, including indicative allocations, are as follows: Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families —   €16.66m; Support for business creation and development — €48.26m; Encouragement of tourism activities — €45.4m; Basic services for the economy and rural population — €49.61m; Village renewal and development — €54.2m; Conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage — €51.7m; Training and information on adapted and new skills — €29.45m; and Implementing co-operation projects  — €10.7m. I am pleased with the progress to date under the RDP, which continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities since it started in 2009. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times, and there is no question of funds being diverted away from the RDP. The RDP currently has registered project activity of €71 million, with almost €30 million at an advanced stage of development. Expenditure to date amounts to almost €47 million, which includes funding for a diverse range of projects from support for micro-enterprise in rural areas to the build and maintenance of community infrastructure and the provision of training in a variety of disciplines for rural dwellers. I am confident that all of the activity funded under the RDP to date is contributing to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities in rural areas. My Department and I will be working closely with Minister Batt O'Keeffe and his Department in the coming months to promote increased co-operation between LAGs and County Enterprise Boards in order to ensure that we maximise the impact of all of the funding available and fully support enterprise and job creation in rural areas. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with rural communities through their LAGs to explore all possible funding opportunities under the RDP.

3590	SeanSherlock	Labour	13831.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Prelude	577	" I am aware of businesses in the small to medium-sized enterprise sector which have the ability to trade their way out of their difficulties, some of which have already reached agreement with Revenue on excise, VAT returns, income tax etc., but now find that some of the agencies of the State, including Revenue, because there is such a clamour to get money in, are changing those terms somewhat.  It is something that needs to be examined.  The motion refers to the SME sector, the loan guarantee etc.  However, we need to look to the wider aspect and the potential of the SME sector within the economy.  Where Revenue is now putting the squeeze on businesses that have the capability to trade their way out of difficulties, we respectfully suggest there might be some word from some Minister to suggest to Revenue that while it will get the tax due and every person will maintain his or her responsibility for that, it should be more relaxed in lengthening the terms so that some of these businesses are not put out of business for want of better terms from Revenue and other State agencies. While it is said there is an oversupply of houses in the market, at the same time some businesses are still willing to build houses because there is still a demand by people, in rural areas in particular, who want to build, for example, one-off houses on family-owned land or in localities with which they have a connection.  Many people of my generation who have received mortgage approval are finding that such approval lasts for only three months.  However, a small building company cannot operate on the basis that someone has approval for only three months.  Extending the approval to six or nine months would also help small building firms, most of which are family-owned and intergenerational, to get up and running.  It is a case of looking at things more laterally. I would also like to concentrate on the issue of the regulatory burden ascribed to the small to medium-sized enterprise sector.  On 2 June, Mr. Seán Gorman, chairman of the high-level group on business regulation at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs to discuss the work of the group in identifying ways to reduce the administrative burden on business arising from regulation.  The high-level group was established in 2007 to act as the fulcrum which Government, business and unions could tackle issues such as administrative burdens and red tape issues, and propose simplification procedures to reduce SMEs' cost burden.  According to the terms of reference of the group as elucidated by Mr. Gorman ""its remit is to identify the administrative burdens placed on businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, arising from regulation or other administrative requirements, particularly in the areas of taxation; health and safety regulation; employment law; environmental regulations; company law and statistical returns; to determine ways to reduce and simplify administrative burdens and to eliminate them where they are unnecessary."" The bottom line for the group was to reduce the paperwork associated with regulation, and simplify and streamline the information flow between business and Government.  The question for the group is whether it has achieved its aims and whether adequate resources are attributed to this task. Since 2008 the CSO, in co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, has adopted its standard cost model to compare the results.  Mr. Steve MacFeely of the CSO, who also addressed the committee that day, stated: Previously we had been using the EUROSTAT recommended methodology.  The standard cost model measures the burden in terms of money rather than time.  From those studies, we estimate that the CSO imposes a burden of approximately €10 million per annum on Irish businesses.  That accounts for about 0.5% of total regulatory burden and is consistent with findings in other countries. Compared with the figures for bank bailouts etc., €10 million is probably minuscule.  For a small business, however, perhaps a sole trader or a business employing fewer than five people, reducing that kind of cost would increase turnover and should be considered. The Labour Party would seek to address the baseline target.  If the target is a reduction of 25% by 2012, it would appear there is not enough departmental staff to deal with the high-level group aspirations adequately to move forward the agenda.  I am not convinced that any target has been reached to date in reducing the regulatory burden for small businesses.  A new political impetus should drive this agenda and no more lip service should be paid to reducing the cost burden.  The Government has signed up to an EU target in this respect.  The challenge facing us now, given that this process started in 1999 and has been through two transitions, is that we are in an economic downturn.  There is a serious urgency about this because of the cost implications for those same businesses. There is a 25% target for 2012 but it must be remembered that the SME sector is under significant pressure.  We clearly should have had a yearly target.  The high-level group has met only five times in 2009 and if the need to reduce the regulation burden on businesses is critical then the group should meet monthly.  This is a view that was proposed by Deputy Kieran O'Donnell when the high-level group appeared before the committee. The group is examining five key areas where businesses have stated they have issues.  These include the burden of complying with tax law, health and safety, employment law and environmental regulations.  The fifth area is company law and the related area of statistical returns.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs, I questioned the high-level group on the cost burden arising from the work of the Health and Safety Authority.  I did so on the basis that we wanted the cost of health and safety measures reduced without compromising the safety of workers.  On health and safety, the administrative costs associated with the IO/20 risk assessments were €167 million, and €146 million for the IO/13 safety statements.  As a percentage of the overall cost burden, these amounted to 51% and 44%, respectively.  How, in practical terms, is it proposed to reduce the burden of these two areas by 25% by the end of 2012? I am somewhat sceptical about the targets being reached.  It needs a new political impetus.  What I am saying does not necessarily speak to the motion, but in terms of the spirit of the motion and giving some kind of a fillip and assistance to the SME sector, we also need to review the regulatory burden the sector is facing."

3595	SeanSherlock	Labour	13833.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	292	 The Labour Party welcomes the proposals contained in Food Harvest 2020 and that eminent persons such as Seán Brady chaired the group that comprised a wide array of stakeholders involved in the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors. The report is worthy of support in that its key action recognises the need to ensure the maximum possible resources are employed to drive an export-led economic recovery and the development of a smart economy.  There is a sense in which food and the agrifood sector has taken a back seat in the past 20 years because of the Government's blind faith in the construction industry.  I am glad this rearguard action has come at a time when there is a latent realisation that agriculture is vital to the country's needs and its future development.  The report's aspirations are a return to basics with clear targets and a vision set out. The agrifood sector has seen a shift over the past several years from commodity-based supply to a brand-centred and consumer-focused approach.  That, in itself, presents challenges.  How will we ensure the shift from a commodity-based supply to adding gross value to food produce? The Government's claim that the smart economy will be the foundation for economic renewal is still nebulous.  One can apply smart economy principles to the idea of food and food production but it needs to be fleshed out more.  The Food Harvest 2020 report points out the smart economy will ensure the primary producer will have higher value output and reduce costs while maintaining higher productivity.  It also claims the food industry will have more targeted research and development components, will collaborate more and will respond to the market in a more enhanced fashion.  These are wonderful terms which I would readily endorse but how will this all happen?  There should be a follow-up document to flesh out this language, which is a little too nebulous.  There should also be concrete action plans for implementing the policy, if we are to support it.  We support the aspirations in the document.  From a consumer's point of view, the smart economy can facilitate a more informed choice and lead to more innovative product ranges.  There must also be an educational component in the policy.  When we talk about the smart approach, we must include a greater partnership between industry and science, fostering the entrepreneurial culture and innovation and the need to ensure that the agrifood sector's position within the smart economy is recognised and acted on in real terms. The Labour Party agrees that we have an opportunity in this policy document to deepen the link with green issues.  Our natural environment and the fact that we have a grass-based agricultural system comprise one of our greatest comparative advantages, but the mere recognition of this fact is not sufficient.  We must develop a deeper approach to what it means.  We talk about Ireland being a green country and the opportunities arising from that comparative advantage, but how do we take that aspiration forward?  The opportunities arising from the green economy are clear from the points of view of primary producers, the food industry, consumers and the country.  There are very transparent methods of production and full traceability in food production.  This should be a comparative advantage relative to third countries that are trying to export into the European Union.  The fact that it is a grass-based agricultural system means we have natural resource benefits, as outlined in the document, but a greater role for agriculture in the economic recovery requires that European Union funding for that aim be enhanced or at least preserved at current levels. We welcome the document and the global context outlined in it.  There will be massive demand for food due to population growth.  As the document states, the world's population in 1999 passed the 6 billion threshold and is due to reach 7 billion in 2010.  By 2025, it is expected to reach 8 billion.  That presents a massive opportunity for this country.  Given the increasing desertification due to climate change in other regions and peripheral nations, Ireland's grass-based agriculture should mean it is well placed to benefit, particularly within the dairy sector where we anticipate Ireland becoming a major global player.  When we consider the dairy sector we traditionally think of brands such as Kerrygold.  Liquid milk is a major commodity but the CAP proposals that are due to be published in November by the European Commission will pose a threat to the national envelope of approximately €1.3 billion that Ireland receives.  If there is a reduction in that budget, it could cause challenges for the dairy sector and undermine the policy the Government is seeking to roll out under Food Harvest 2020. The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, is holding its national conference this week and one of the issues it will address is how the dairy sector will prepare for the end of milk quotas.  This will present a challenge for co-operatives in Ireland.  The question is whether the co-operative movement in its current form will be well placed to meet the twofold challenge of the increase in the global population, and the increased demand that goes with it, and the post-milk quota situation.  Will Ireland be able to make the changes necessary to ensure the amount of milk being produced can be increased by the anticipated 50% which is deemed possible under a quota free regime?  Everything we use is home produced and net inputs and outputs are local.  In an increased market for dairy products, there should be a net benefit to the Irish economy as a result.  This will obviously add to growth figures. One of the matters due to be discussed at the ICOS national conference is the cost of preparing for higher milk output.  How will the relationship between farmers, who are shareholders, and their co-operatives continue in the post-quota situation?  What will the nature of that relationship be after 2013 and will farmers be able to embrace the challenge?  I believe they will.  Many people in the dairy sector are vying to gear up for that eventuality, but there is also a generational shift in that regard.  There will have to be a common mechanism to regulate milk production and it must have an all-island approach.  Whether it is an all-island or one Ireland approach is a matter of conjecture but we believe there should be a deepening of the relationship between the two parts of the island to achieve such a common mechanism. There must be a consensus between co-operatives with regard to the potential for the dairy sector and this can only come from the people who own the co-operatives.  It will probably require a change in mindset and a more lateral view as to how we can look at the market strategically.  It has been suggested that Ireland could become another New Zealand or that perhaps Ireland should ally itself with New Zealand to create a type of duopoly to control milk supply from grass-fed cattle.  This is necessary to compete in a global market and we should not be ashamed to look strategically at how that can happen.  There is a critique of the New Zealand model in that land ownership structures are more fluid there than they are here, which facilitates the existence of that model.  Here it is a little more difficult due to the greater ties to the land, but that is a challenge which should be examined.  The key point is that we should take a more lateral view in terms of how to gain a greater foothold in the global dairy market.  If forming strategic alliances is required, we should at least examine the possibilities even if they do not come to fruition.  We must take a more lateral view in forming our strategy. According to Food Harvest 2020, there will be an increase in the global population.  The question for Ireland is how to maximise that potential.  The theory is that the dairy sector must consolidate further and traditional behaviours must be examined with a view to ensuring that we increase our milk supply to cater for that demand.  The success of Food Harvest 2020 will be predicated on ensuring that more young farmers enter the sector.  This should become a priority.  In yesterday's Irish Examiner there was a report by Macra na Feirme indicating that less than 7% of Europe’s farmers are under the age of 35 years.  The Food Harvest 2020 report puts emphasis on giving young people access to farming but the educational aspect of that must be examined more deeply.  If the strategy is to be successful, it must be based on a clear and unambiguous need to provide active measures to ensure participation rates by younger people. There is a suggestion that if there were specific schemes for young people under the new CAP, it would go a long way towards addressing the challenge of ensuring a throughput of new farmers.  The policy would bear fruit arising from that.  Members are familiar with the adage that it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  If there is a throughput of young farmers, they would be better able to adapt to new methods and will bring forward the policy as necessary.  One of the key deficiencies in the report is the lack of a coherent chapter on education.  It is all well and good to have the targets of increasing the value of the primary output in agriculture, fisheries and forestry by €1.5 billion or 33% compared to the 2007 to 2009 average, increasing the value added in agriculture, food, fisheries and wood products by €3 billion or a 40% increase on 2005 and having an export target of €12 billion for the sector, representing a 42% increase compared to 2007 to 2009, but if that is to be achieved there will have to be a more fundamental educational input for the reasons I have outlined.  Even though innovations are taking place in the beef, dairy and wood sectors, if the age profile of farmers is higher there will be a lag time in reaching those targets.  It will be necessary to increase the throughput of younger people who are educated specifically to achieve those targets. If the overall vision is based on acting smart, thinking green and achieving growth and if the Department is trying to prioritise research and development, improve skill levels, increase best practice, foster creativity and improve consumer preferences, this can only be achieved to a certain extent under the current paradigm.  In other words, the underlying assumptions need to change.  The Labour Party's view is that there has to be a root and branch review of the educational aspects of how to proceed.  We acknowledge that centres of excellence like UCC, which have specialist knowledge food production, should be incorporated into the roll-out of this policy and become active stakeholders.  We also need to overhaul subjects such as agricultural science at second level.  A farming-related model or a food-related model-module of education could be introduced into the leaving certificate curriculum to develop, foster and create the aspirations outlined in the overall vision.  We believe that the younger people start, especially in second level institutions, the more of an opportunity there will be to create the coterie of food and agribusiness entrepreneurs needed to sustain the policy.  If it is a 2020 strategy, it has to be implemented on the basis of ensuring that we start now and we start at second level to ensure more people are brought through the educational system with a focus on food production and all that entails. There are major challenges in the fiscal and economic context.  The report issued by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation under rapporteur, Deputy Arthur Morgan, and Chairman, Deputy Willie Penrose, examined what is required to expand employment in the agrifood sector.  It takes a deep view of what needs to be done and one of the areas it examined is the role of co-operatives.  I referred to the ICOS model and to its meeting this week to discuss how to improve the co-operative movement and the need for greater consolidation.  One of the aspirations in the Morgan report is to ensure an important role for co-operatives.  It states: The Government needs to support the Co-operative enterprise from start-ups to employee buy-outs in the agri food sector. Co-operatives have a long tradition in the agri food sector in Ireland where some businesses, which started out as local co-ops have gone on to be multi-nationals and market leaders such as in the areas of dairy products. The Co-operative Movement has played a central role in the economic development of rural Ireland. Co-operative enterprises create many benefits for business, employees and communities. That aspiration should be incorporated into the strategy. The development of a new generation of co-operatives, particularly for organic foodstuffs, must play a role in creating new jobs in the agrifood sector.  Establishing a co-operative may be the most viable option for starting a new business and government policy needs to reflect this.  The Labour Party will stand over that aspiration and we believe that it needs to be incorporated into a Government policy where one goes back to first principles.  There is a need for greater consolidation within the co-operative movement in the dairy sector where scaling upwards will achieve a greater export market without losing core principles and deepening relationships with the local market. There is massive scope in this area but there is also a role, for instance, for enterprise development agencies to assist in the process of adding value to the industry.  The Morgan report outlines how access to expertise and capital for ventures and projects, which provide economic benefit but which may not happen if left to market forces alone, can be increased.  In other words, State involvement is vital in this process. Improving skill sets is one of the aspirations in the growth and competitiveness chapter of the Food Harvest 2020 document.  It acknowledges the role of Teagasc, the Marine Institute and universities and other third level institutions and states they have a crucial role in creating and disseminating new knowledge.  If one owns an existing business and if one wishes to retrain, there are programmes which are tailored to one's needs.  For instance, a programme in UCC is aimed at people working within the artisan food sector and it is designed to try to encourage them to add value to their products and to learn new business skills.  However, there is a cost component to doing the course and, very often, people working within that sector are operating on tight margins and find it difficult to get funding for courses such as this. If we want to concentrate on education and to try to upskill people or get a more educated coterie working within the food sector, barriers cannot be put in their way.  UCC is oversubscribed for the course it has designed for the artisan food sector.  Some people cannot access the course because they are on marginal incomes within their own food businesses and they cannot afford the fees.  If we are serious about adding value in the sector, it needs to be ensured institutions such as UCC, which provides courses, are not impeded from doing so for want of grant aiding people within the food industry who want to do the courses.  It is a common sense principle and, notwithstanding current economic constraints, they could be provided with interest free loans, for example, but there should be a guarantee that people will not be impeded from upskilling because of the fees. Increasing knowledge is important to add value to output within the sector but despite the wonderful aspirations in the Food Harvest 2020 document, it will fail as a policy if it does not allow for a proper educational component.  Access to courses is vital and if we are to deepen the involvement of entrepreneurs in the agrifood sector, educational establishments should be able to take people in without impediment.  There should not be a barrier to entry to courses. Post-primary school enrolments will also increase significantly to reach 334,500 by 2018.  Traditional subjects such as English, Irish, maths, French and so on remain and there is still not an emphasis on science or agriscience subjects.  The Labour Party believes in the policy but for it to work, the Government needs to deepen the educational tie-in and the only way to do so is to foster a culture of entreprenuerialism in young children at second level and to develop an education model that reflects the fact that we have always been an agricultural country, we have always had strong ties to the land and even though we have become urbanised in our thinking, we are never too far from the land.  The land will get us out of the economic morass but we need to think more laterally about that.

Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training, designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of any changes in the threat assessment or mission requirements. The Defence Forces are also involved in interoperability training and technical developments in co-ordination with UN and EU partners  For example, the Defence Forces are currently engaged in the Live Exercise (LIVEX) Joint Action, part of the main interoperability exercise during Ireland’s membership of the Nordic Battlegroup 2011.  The Defence Forces have also participated in a range of desktop and command post exercises based on realistic peacekeeping scenarios.  Defence Forces training is based on and updated in accordance with best practice international training standards. Ireland, in common with other neutral EU Member States who are members of Partnership for Peace (PfP), participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP) mechanism for planning in relation to peace support operations.  The scope of Ireland's involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability so that Defence Forces personnel can operate efficiently and effectively in a multi-national environment. I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel will continue to receive the necessary training to enable them to carry out their duties in a professional manner.

I, too, on behalf of the Labour Party, welcome this legislation.  As with any consolidation Bill, it is for the purposes of simplifying procedures and that is to be welcomed.  It will potentially reduce the compliance burden on small and family businesses and family farms, and this is to be welcomed. I noted the Minister of State's remarks on the January 1982 budget.  My late father played no small part in that particular decision as regards VAT on children's shoes, so that is a decision which has worked its way into the annals of our family, and we are proud of it.  There is not much to be said, apart from acknowledging it as being a fine body of work.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, instigated by Deputy Ruairí Quinn, had a similar type of effect.  However, the 1997 Act has been amended in every Finance Bill since, and arguably has led to an unwieldy tax system.  One hopes that this legislation will remain as codified and in that sense, retain its purity. There is not much more to be said.  We have some amendments in respect of certain parts of the Bill, but nothing substantive.  We shall deal with those on Committee Stage.  We congratulate the Minister, officials of the Department and everyone who had a part in drafting the legislation.  It was no easy task and they are to be commended.

3623	SeanSherlock	Labour	13846.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-03 00:00:00	Prelude	571	" I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Labour Party supports the Fine Gael motion.  Although the motion speaks specifically to the incompetence of the Government, with particular regard to the banking crisis, it is important to speak about the lack of regulation of the money lending and debt advisory sector.  In the current regulatory environment there is a coterie of so-called debt advisers who charge rates commensurate with the usurers of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"".  This is an outrage and a further indicator of the indifference this Government shows towards ordinary working people.  This was evidenced in its recent reply to a parliamentary question I posed on licensed moneylenders. It may be said I am straying slightly from the guts of the motion but in speaking on this sector my party believes there must be a level of equity in the way a Government and a regulatory regime examine financial services.  If one talks about giving powers to the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement, one must also examine how those powers are divided up and to which sectors they should apply.  The motion speaks of these powers applying specifically to the banking sector but my party believes it is essential that we consider the wider financial services sector. On 27 October I asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention had been drawn to the fact that the country's largest licensed home collection moneylender has acquired an additional 13,000 customers in the past year and what his plans were to introduce a system of regulation for debt collection agencies. The Minister responded: In my role as Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing the regulation of financial institutions in Ireland.  The day to day responsibility for the supervision of these financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank, which is independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  The Central Bank issues licences to money lenders on a yearly basis.  The Central Bank has produced a consumer protection code for licensed money lenders and under this code money lenders are required to prominently indicate the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher.  The disclosure must take the following form,  there must be a warning that this is a high-cost loan and money lenders must also provide consumers who demonstrate difficulty in meeting their repayments with information on debt counselling services such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which provides free independent advice and guidance. The reply continues: Other provisions of the code cover a range of areas including unsolicited contact and unsolicited credit facilities, handling complaints, arrears and guarantees and debt collection . . . The Deputy may wish to note that in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms the Central Bank has imposed requirements under its consumer protection code that offer protection to consumers.  This code obliges the regulated financial institutions that it covers to ensure that any outsourced collection activity complies with the requirements of the code.  This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the code such as the requirement for institutions to not exert undue pressure or undue influence on the customer, act honestly, fairly and professionally and with due skill and diligence in the best interests of its consumers and prohibit personal visits to or oral communications with consumers except in specified circumstances.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the National Consumer Agency provides extensive information on its website and through its helpline to help consumers avoid getting into debt difficulties.  The agency also provides information for those at risk of not being able to meet loan repayments. I know of nobody who has borrowed money who has been offered such information or is even aware of their rights and entitlements.  These are people who traditionally come from working-class areas, have fallen on tougher times and are borrowing from the moneylender.  There must be a role for the regulator in regard to this sector because not only is it under-regulated but it deals with the most vulnerable people in our society at this time. My party sees a glaring discrepancy in the way this sector is being treated where we see a light touch approach applied.  The Minister's response to my parliamentary question reflects a mish-mash type of response that does not deal directly with the problem of moneylenders and how insidious they have become.  At the same time, however, the regulatory regime has borne down very heavily on the credit union sector, unnecessarily so, some would argue. In essence, we support the motion but if we are to use opportunities such as this to take a look at the regulatory regime we contend the Government must also examine other aspects of financial services.  It must examine the moneylending sector and ask whether it places too heavy a hand on the credit union sector.  If one takes the credit union sector as an example, it is one that has never needed a bail out.  This House has never debated whether the credit union sector was going into crisis because we know full well it is not, even though there may be a small handful of credit unions which have encountered serious difficulties.  The regulatory response from Government, however, has been to bear down heavily on the credit union sector — unnecessarily, we contend —  but not to do anything in regard to regulation of the moneylending sector which adversely affects those people who are most vulnerable and therefore needs to be regulated. We can have no faith that this Government will introduce adequate measures for the Garda or the Director of Corporate Enforcement when we see clearly from the reply to my parliamentary question that the Government is failing to legislate adequately for the moneylending sector while going hell for leather to regulate the credit union sector.   Moneylending is a hidden sector, one that needs to be examined and that should be subject to Garda monitoring.  I believe it was on 12 February last year that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, stated in a debate on the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland that there would have to be a change in the regime such that people would have to do ""the perp walk"", to cite the expression he used.  Nobody yet has done the perp walk and we question why there has not been progress since 12 February 2009 in that regard."

3631	SeanSherlock	Labour	13847.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	341	 I wish to consider the matter from two perspectives.  Would the Minister of State acknowledge that ensuring the target is met would potentially capture in the private forestry sector up to 160,000 tonnes of CO2?  According to the private forestry sector, if the State were to purchase carbon credits for that amount, it would cost approximately €46 million.  While the 10,000 hectares is an aspirational figure, would the Minister of State acknowledge that we should move beyond aspirations at this stage?  There is a clear need in a very productive sector to ensure that the investment will yield a multiplier of the benefits in the longer term.

To what does he attribute this figure? What is the up to date position regarding those who are leaving REPS 3?  Will they be accommodated under the AEOS next year?
3633	SeanSherlock	Labour	13847.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	369	 Speaking of the Estimates, is the Minister confident he can secure the €50 million next year, or more, depending on the demand for the scheme?

If we take the Deputy's point about the Food Harvest 2020 report, would the Minister acknowledge that one criticism of the document, which we support, is that if we are to achieve those targets, particularly in the dairy sector, there must be a major restructuring in the use of land and stock?  To incentivise new blood into the sector, the reliefs must be continued and extended.  Does the Minister agree with that point?
3635	SeanSherlock	Labour	13847.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	383	 All parties welcome the Food Harvest 2020 report.  Will the Minister acknowledge, however, that the implementation body's membership is not wide enough?  Will he agree he should have included representatives from this side of the House as we represent a significant proportion of the population?  Will the Minister guarantee the €641 million allocated to the agrifood research and development programme will be maintained to achieve this policy?

Will the Minister provide some direction as to when a statutory code of conduct will be put in place?  When will this happen?  We seek a specific time and date.  Will the Minister not acknowledge there is a certain irony in the fact that the Minister of State sitting beside him, Deputy Cuffe, has referred to Terra Madre and the Slow Food movement, which comprises small organic producers who seek to find an export market?  Meanwhile, in this country, the Government is capitulating to the Tescos and Asdas of this world which seek to gain a foothold here.  Will the Minister confirm that he will do everything in his power to ensure that the retail planning guidelines will not be moved or shifted in any way to facilitate the ""Tescoification"" of the Irish grocery sector and to ensure that we can protect the primary producers to whom the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, referred such that we retain a good mix and not do not sell ourselves out to the large multiples?"

3641	SeanSherlock	Labour	13847.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	442	" I raise this matter in the context of the fact that €300 million is spent annually in Cork on prefabricated buildings in the primary school sector.  Today, we learned through RTE that €330 million of the budget of the Department of Education and Skills has not yet been spent.  I use the particular example of Midleton because three primary schools are housed in inadequate conditions.  I put the question to the Minister about the educational needs of Midleton in the future and the answer stated: ""School accommodation requirements in the Midleton/Carrigtwohill area have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified areas, which indicates that up 38 additional primary classrooms may be required across that area to cater for increased enrolments up to the school year 2014/15.""  There are three schools in the area — St. John the Baptist national school, an Educate Together school and a gaelscoil.  I am sure the Minister's response will point out the Department has applied for planning permission at Ballinacurra, a site that would be woefully inadequate for meeting the longer-term needs of primary schools in Midleton.  The Educate Together school is housed in the local rugby club at a cost of €45,000 per year.  The gaelscoil is spending approximately €81,000 on rental costs and is being housed in the local community centre.  I do not have the figures for the third school.  If we take a lateral approach about how to provide this, we can make savings in the long run.  We want the Department to come down and make a proper study and assessment of the educational requirements in the Midleton area so that it can adhere to the aim to meet the need for 38 additional primary school classrooms and adhere to the various ethos that exist. St. John the Baptist national school is largely a Church of Ireland denomination school.  Along with the Educate Together school and the gaelscoil, it could be housed on one campus, but the Ballinacurra site is woefully inadequate.  Something must be done.  In the case of St. John the Baptist national school, the school authorities have an imaginative plan and have sought a loan from the Department in order to carry out the work.  It has proven it can do this work in the past.  If the Department got out of its centralised, structuralised tendency to think along the same lines, these people could achieve their aims.  They seek a little help from the Government in order to do so.  Similarly, the Educate Together school is housed in the local rugby club and was offered a site at the local co-op, which it could rent at a significantly lower price than the Department is paying at present.  Why do we not think laterally about how we can help them? Midleton is a barometer for many towns beyond the Pale.  I asked the Department and the Minister to take on board the submissions made by the schools and to recognise the deficiencies at the Ballinacurra site.  I call on someone to please meet with these people and think a little more laterally about how they are going to deliver for educational needs in the primary sector in the future."

3655	SeanSherlock	Labour	13853.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-10 00:00:00	Prelude	741	 I will follow on from the theme as espoused by Deputy McManus on the role of the Ombudsman.  In a speech given by her recently on her office and this institution, she quoted from a speech made by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in which he stated: [W]e should . . . return Dáil Éireann to a central place in public thinking.  It should be the battleground for ideas, the location for intellectual debate . . . where the brightest and best work in concert to achieve optimal results over the long term, not cheap point-scoring in the short term. Those are the words of a Fianna Fáil Minister — a Front Bench senior Minister of long standing.  The Ombudsman referred to the lost at sea report.  I can only speak about my own experience of this Parliament and state that the manner which the lost at sea report was dealt with suggested to me that no matter what the Ombudsman's finding was, the Government was going to have a partisan, party political view on whether it would support it. From the point of view of citizens and the complainant this denigrated their position.  For a complainant to come forward in the first instance and to go through the process of making a complaint to the Ombudsman is quite a lengthy and stressful process.  It was particularly traumatic for the Byrne family with regard to the lost at sea report.  For the Government then to reject out of hand a report from an independent officer who is above politics, and to do so in such a partisan way within this House at the joint committee, suggested that the Fianna Fáil Party decided it would trample all over that very institution.  There was not even a recognition that the complaint had validity.  Even if the amount of compensation to be offered was rejected, there should at least have been an acknowledgement of the faults on the Government side. I speak on this motion as a person who received a mandate for the first time in 2007.  This Parliament is ceasing to be relevant for ordinary citizens.  The roof needs to be lifted or blown off so that a little light can be let in and the institution can be reformed.  It will not take much to do so.  With a little lateral thinking and cross-party consensus on how it can be done, we can restore this institution to some degree of relevance to ordinary people's lives.  So long as the Executive continues to hold the power it does, this Parliament will die on its feet.

3675	SeanSherlock	Labour	13854.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	610	 I understand that €100 million has been committed over three years by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, to assist poorer countries to tackle climate change.  Consequently, either the Minister, when responding to this debate, or someone from the Government side should indicate the current status of this initiative to Members. The content of the Bill has already been anticipated in the joint committee's report.  Members often speak in this House about the partisan nature of politics and I agree it is understandable that in certain circumstances, the House will divide on political or philosophical issues or on managerial issues pertaining to how the country should proceed.  However, an issue such as this, on which a cross-party report has been produced that has been accepted by all political stakeholders and with the Green Party in power, should surely be out of the starting blocks already.  At this point, Members should not only be talking about heads of agreement and so on. There is a sense that because the economy has taken such a downturn, an issue such as climate change can move to the back burner.  I reiterate a point made by Deputy Barrett by questioning the reason the election of a mayor for Dublin is being prioritised through changes in legislation.  Why does that measure take greater precedence than an issue such as climate change in the legislative programme before Members? I refer to today's Order of Business in the Dáil and the furore, partly started by me I admit, on the decision by the European Court of Auditors to critique a Government decision on the closure of the Irish sugar industry.  While one may ask the reason this is pertinent to the subject under discussion, I was town mayor of Mallow at the time when the sugar factory there closed and one issue I sought to put on the political agenda was an examination of the potential for ethanol production.  It was considered that if Ireland was moving out of sugar production and if the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries were going to be given a greater slice of the market under the Everything But Arms initiative, then this was a WTO decision to which one would, to a certain extent, be obliged to buy in to.  At that time, I was strongly of the opinion, based on sound advice, that there was potential at least for a survival mechanism for the plant for two years.  Thereafter, once the market had opened up, it would be a case of sink or swim depending on how the global market went.  It is now evident that the global market for sugar has increased but in the absence of the continuation of sugar production at the Mallow plant there could have been a move towards an ethanol production facility. Timing is everything because this year, the House has transposed the bio-fuels obligation legislation, which seeks to ensure that each tank of petrol has ethanol or alternative fuel sources as part of its constituent composition.  The Labour Party strongly believed that stimulation of an ethanol production market within Ireland was possible but to be able to so do it would be necessary to put in place a set of tariffs.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, rejected this position.  I am not trying to score political points because if I understand his position correctly, he wished to go back to ascertain what would be the Commission position on such a proposal.  Members opposite will correct me if I am wrong in that assessment.  Nevertheless, there is a precedent in respect of ethanol importation as I understand that other countries are placing a tariff on importation to stimulate local production within their countries. I represent the constituency of Cork East, within which is located the Whitegate refinery.  I am reliably informed that for a number of years, the big oil companies operating at Whitegate have been storing up undenatured ethanol that more than likely has been imported from third countries such as Brazil.  While it is probably derived from former forestry sites, Ireland has not even started localised production. In respect of climate change, I refer to the attempt to wean ourselves off petrol and to substitute it with alternative energy sources.  One does not do this by allowing big oil companies to control the political agenda, thereby enabling them to meet their obligations under the bio-fuel obligation scheme by imports from locations such as South America because that does not make any sense.  At that time, when Members were doing battle on this Bill, I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Ryan, would have been ahead of the curve.  I would have expected him to play, dare I say it, the green jersey card by asserting that Ireland would stimulate local demand.  This comes back full circle to my point about Irish sugar and how, at a time when Ireland is importing substitute ethanol to put in its cars, it could have an ethanol industry that could provide the same service.  This is where political thinking in Ireland has become so disjointed.
3676	SeanSherlock	Labour	13854.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	612	" We must begin to think more laterally about how to achieve our aims.  We must start by ascertaining where we want to go and what is our target.  Thereafter, we should look towards achieving that target without fear of being perceived to be too nationalistic.  I do not use the word ""nationalistic"" in the narrow sense by which most people define it.  I mean having some pride in our ability to produce such ethanol ourselves to be able to stimulate local production.  This could then offset many of the challenges Ireland faces vis-à-vis the production of carbon resulting from the importation of substitutes. On the issue of forestry, the stated Government target in the revised programme for Government is to achieve 10,000 hectares per annum.  At present, I understand that approximately 7,000 hectares is being achieved, therefore, Ireland still is off-target.  Forestry is a productive indigenous sector that has a multiplier into the local economy. There is a justification, even in these constrained economic times, for continuing the subsidisation of that sector.  If, for instance, a Government can justify the subsidisation of foreign direct investment type jobs, whereby a grant or subsidy is given to a company for each job created, the same logic can apply where we seek to upscale indigenous sectors.  If we are to target climate change, forestry will become a fulcrum in terms of achieving targets. With the impending budget, I ask the Government to take a look at this again.  Funding this sector will create an economic multiplier that will assist local economies.  I ask the Government to bear that in mind."
3677	SeanSherlock	Labour	13854.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	724	 I express solidarity with the workers and growers in north Cork, the area with which I am most familiar, who fought tooth and nail and through thick and thin to try to keep the sugar factory in Mallow operational.  They were given a clear indication that the factory had a viable future if efficiencies and changed work practices were introduced.  Having agreed to the changes, the workforce was sold out by the Fianna Fáil Government. The Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time, made the following statement to the House this morning: Second, as then Minister for Agriculture and Food, I opposed the Commission's proposals, as the Members will be aware and led the group of 14 in its opposition to that reform.  I led that opposition with a number of other colleagues in the European Union. There is a disparity between this statement and the minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 20 February 2006, which state: The Council successfully adopted by qualified majority the three Regulations on the reform of the sugar sector as set out in documents 5588/06, 5589/06, 5590/06.  The Greek, Polish, and Latvian delegations voted against. If the Greek, Polish and Latvian delegations voted against the so-called reforms, only the Tánaiste, who was a party to the discussions in the Council of Ministers and claims she opposed the proposals, is in a position to describe what occurred at the meeting.  Why is she not present to clarify the matter?  She owes an explanation to the growers of north Cork and elsewhere in the country as well as the workers who lost their jobs as a result of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers. I remind the Minister that some of the same workers had to wait for more than 12 months for redundancy payments.  I was a councillor at the time and had to seek supplementary welfare payments on the behalf of workers at the Mallow plant, pending the outcome of negotiations with Greencore, a company that had received millions of euro from the compensation fund.  That story was never told because we were in the midst of the Celtic tiger and the Government side did not want to hear it. The bottom line is that the former Minister shifted her position from one in which she was in a blocking minority with other countries to one in which she accepted the compensation package.  She owes it to people in north Cork, all those who grew beet and everyone else who was affected by the decision to explain the reason she shifted her position.  That is the least the House deserves in terms of the history of this episode. In 2005, I stated that if Ireland was to stop producing sugar, the perfect place to start producing ethanol was either Carlow or Mallow.  Ethanol is now being imported into Whitegate.  The Labour Party tabled an amendment on the biofuels Bill providing for the imposition of a tariff on ethanol imports to stimulate local production.  Despite the presence of the Green Party in government, this measure has not been taken.  If we are not to produce sugar again, we should at least produce ethanol locally to meet the requirements of the biofuel obligation.  The Government must explain the position it took on this matter.
3678	SeanSherlock	Labour	13854.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	750	 Regarding the night of 20 February 2006, I understand the difficulty for the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in needing to account for a decision taken in 2006 at a meeting at which he was not present.  Therefore, he is reliant on the officials.  Ideally, the then Minister should be in the Chamber so that we could have a full and frank account of what occurred at the meeting. Why did the Government shift its position?  While we were considering the matter from the perspective of Mallow and the protection of jobs and a viable national industry, there were grounds for hope because of the blocking minority.  The Tánaiste stated it was a group of 14 member states.  I understood that, under the old regime, a blocking minority consisted of nine member states.  Why did the Government shift its position from a blocking minority of nine to acceding to the cessation of trading as an industry?  Something must have happened.  Perhaps a vested interest intervened because it wanted to take the compensation.  This could have been a minority group of larger growers, the Government or even Greencore, which might have decided that it was going to get out of the industry and applied political pressure on the Government to that effect. The question of the golden share and related responsibilities comes into play in this respect.  I understand that the 1990 legislation makes provision for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to acquire a special share in the holding company and to exercise the rights attached to that share.  However, the Minister stated that he had no rights in the context of the share.  Forgive me, as I am not a lawyer or a solicitor, but if the Minister is telling the House that we had a golden share with no rights attached to it in terms of the performance of the company, why did we have a golden share in the first instance?  What was its purpose if we could not influence internal Greencore decisions on the compensation package and the industry's future in Ireland? I will tell the House the reason.  The Government did not care about the future of the industry.  Vested interests had sufficient influence in Government circles to tell it to adopt the new negotiating position of taking the money and running.  If we had the support of the other member states, we could have retained a blocking minority.  If the contrary is the case, then the Minister should tell us. I refer to the stand-alone paragraph which stated that we had a proficient factory — this is obviously a reference to the Mallow factory in point 30 as the Minister has stated.  Has the Minister been in contact with the Commission regarding that specific point of the report?  What has been the Commission's response to the Minister on that matter and on the report in general?  Deputy Jack Wall has already stated that the decision had not been justified on the risk of lower prices reducing the supply of sugar beet to an uneconomic level.  We did not really know what the true market would be, post-restructuring.  My information in 2005 was that Greencore was going to proceed with production and move into a post-quota scenario and then see how the market would pan out.  This was the impression given to me by senior people within Greencore at the time.  In other words, even if the quota regime was not in place, the industry might survive for a year or two in a new market scenario.  If after that time the industry did not survive, there might be a possibility it could diversify into ethanol and other such products.  I ask for the Minister's view at this stage.  Will I be allowed make another contribution later?

3681	SeanSherlock	Labour	13854.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	812	 The Everything But Arms Initiative was something of a fallacy in terms of a justification for the Government's position on the loss of an industry which goes back to the foundation of the State.  The Minister, in his justification, weakens his own argument because the Everything But Arms Initiative and the ACP countries have not found the foothold in the European markets that they were supposed to get as a result of the restructuring of the sugar industry.  The bottom line here is that what was a sustainable industry has been sold down the river but it was let go too easily.

Issues relating to disciplinary procedures within the Irish Red Cross Society are a matter for the parties thereto, each of whom can receive independent legal advice as to their rights and entitlements.
3719	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	339	 What kind of accusation is that?
3720	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	404	 On a point of order, I did not quite understand what the Minister was saying.  I ask his forgiveness.  Could he explain it to the House in layman's terms?
3721	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	436	 How much will all this cost the ordinary taxpayer?  How much will it cost the ordinary taxpayer to fund the loan, the bailout or whatever?  In its quarterly report, dated October 2010, the Central Bank stated that the unemployment rate next year would be about 13.3%.  I want to know what the permutations of this current initiative will have for the unemployment rate next year.
3722	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	438	 I referred to the unemployment rate.  There is a projected rate for next year.
3723	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	440	 There is a correlation.
3724	SeanSherlock	Labour	13861.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	339	 The agencies under the remit of the Department are the Civil Defence Board, the Army Pensions Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.

3729	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	322	 Will the Minister clarify his reply?  Did I interpret him correctly when he said there is no impediment to the process but it would be subject to an EU Commission proposal?  Is there a clause in the agreement that resulted in the closure of the industry, which says that no sugar beet should be produced in Ireland up to 2017?  That needs to be clarified by him. Has he regrets?  Does he now feel Government policy at the time was short-sighted in that even if we were not producing sugar, we could have used the sugar beet crop to produce ethanol to fulfil our obligations under the bio-fuels scheme and we would not have to import undenatured ethanol from third countries such as Brazil because we could blend it into stocks at Whitegate and produce an indigenous crop?
3730	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	324	 That reply is extremely disappointing but I do not want to make political hay out of this.  I accept what the Minister is saying in so far as Greencore, as the commercial entity responsible for processing sugar, stated it would renounce its quota but there is a disconnect between that and the political decision taken at Council of Ministers level, to which Fianna Fáil was a party, to accept the restructuring package as it pertained to Ireland.  Will the Minister acknowledge that post-2015 we could grow sugar beet again in Ireland, if not to supply the confectionery market, to ensure we can meet our obligations under the bio-fuels scheme?
3731	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	326	 The Minister has not answered my question about the potential of the sugar beet crop in the production of ethanol.
3732	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	329	 The Minister is kicking to touch again.
3733	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	332	 This is the only forum I have to have my question answered.  I want the Minister to give an opinion on whether we can produce ethanol on an indigenous basis.  He is kicking to touch again.  That sums up this Government.
3734	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	346	 I welcome the Minister's response.  It is one of those issues where we need a broad political consensus for the final outcome.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is beginning to tie down the three options and is being specific about the second option.  I also welcome his statement on payments and upper ceilings for larger farms.  I acknowledge what the Minister is saying about potential capping and the need for further detail on that. If Ireland is to go for the second option — I realise that it is early days in negotiations — and there is a basic rate envisaged in that for income support, how does the Minister envisage that this will work out in real terms?
3735	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	356	 I acknowledge the Minister's response with regard to capping and to the United Kingdom's position.  It is clear the British would be against a cap for reasons arising from their monarchy, the Queen's progeny and the amount of land they own.  Consequently, this would stand to reason.  However, I refer to the flexibility arrangements about which the Minister has spoken.  Does he refer to flexibility in the sense that there would be an envelope for Ireland regarding the greening aspect, whereby Ireland would have a degree of flexibility as to how it could spend such funds?  Alternatively, does he refer to a degree of flexibility for Ireland with regard to the overall envelope?  The Minister should clear this up.
3736	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	358	 That is reassuring.
3737	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	373	 Has the Minister read the article by Darragh McCullough and Caitríona Murphy in this week's farming section of the Irish Independent?  The article in question refers to a “€35.7m cut in the Department of Agriculture’s budget for REPS and the Agri Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS) next year”.
3738	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	375	 I apologise.  I can paraphrase the document.
3739	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	377	 The article, which suggests that the remaining €294 million in the Department's budget will cover just 9,000 farmers, gets to the nub of the issue.  The farmers in question need a response from the Minister.  I ask the House to forgive my ignorance when I say I did not follow what the Minister said, to be frank.
3740	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	379	 Can the Minister guarantee the future of the AEO scheme?
3741	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	382	" I appreciate the Minister of State's reply.  I accept that the laws of supply and demand are among the dynamics in this instance.  He said that ""4% of sheep meat imports into Ireland last year came from New Zealand"".  How does that translate in terms of monetary value?  I do not know if the Minister of State has those figures.  If he does not, I will accept it and suggest they may be forwarded to me in the near future."
3742	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	406	 I ask for clarification.  From where has the Minister derived the figure of the price of 26 cent per litre?  Is this the amount that would make it sustainable?  Is the Minister now saying that pre-2015 there is no possibility of subsidisation of beet growing for the production of ethanol?  Is he saying there would be no Government support for the production of ethanol from sugar beet?
3743	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	409	 Tell that to the Fine Gael boys in Mallow.
3744	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	433	 The Minister is now deliberately provoking a debate on the issue.
3745	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	436	 The Minister had the last word, and then——
3746	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	438	 The Minister is provoking a debate on this issue.
3747	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	440	 That was a cheap parting shot.
3748	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	444	 You could not be up to them.
3749	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	446	 I do not know whether the Minister was about to get to it, but one part of the question was about deficiencies found by his inspectors in the past.
3750	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	455	 On the basis of the targets set out for increased production in that area, what bearing will the Food Harvest 2020 proposals have on this scheme?
3751	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	647	 He is hale and hearty anyway.
3752	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	654	 I welcome the Fine Gael motion, which the Labour Party supports.  In speaking on the question of political and economic stability, we have before us proposals by the European Commission in relation to co-ordination on economic governance issues.  What goes to the heart of this is the very existence of political and economic co-ordination on issues of a monetary nature.  Events in recent months have shown clearly that there is an existential crisis as regards the very existence of the euro.  As a result of the current crisis there are some who seek to impose on countries greater economic and political co-ordination in return for the continued existence of the euro.  In other words, the very threat we see to the euro at present, in the opinion of some people, is as a result of a lack of greater political co-ordination. My view is that if the Government of the day is to talk about greater political and economic co-ordination at a European level, we must be very honest with the people about that.  There is a choice now in this country as regards where we go.  Do we follow an intergovernmental model so that we may ensure our sovereignty, both economic and political, or do we go for a deeper co-ordination at European level and follow an intra-institutional model, whereby greater power is derived by the European Commission?  Instinctively in this country, because it is supposed to be a republic, there is a view to the effect that while greater economic co-ordination is necessary and we subscribe to the very existence of the euro, this should not be to the further detriment of our sovereignty.  We have now given away too much of that sovereignty along with our ability to be able to make and break our own fiscal and monetary policies.  There has to be a breakpoint which determines that this current crisis should not present itself as an opportunity by the European Commission as potential for deepening European integration so that the intra-institutional model wins out over the intergovernmental one. The plan that has been put before us, on which we will not be even entitled to vote, is a further kick in the teeth to the citizens of Ireland, who believe very strongly that they should have the ability through this House to decide as to its efficacy.  There is now a well-founded deepening suspicion that this crisis has presented itself as an opportunity by the European Commission and the intra-institutions to deepen their grip and to bring about a federal construct for the European Union.  I want to lay down a marker to the effect that any new Government must think carefully as regards where it wants to go and on its policy in relation to the European Union in this respect. Mine and future generations have been sold down the river, and deemed expendable in the greatest ever swindle to which the people of Ireland have been subjected as a result of the economic policies of this Government.  I note the presence on the Fianna Fáil benches of members of my generation, some of whom became Members of the Dáil around the same time as I did.
3753	SeanSherlock	Labour	13874.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	657	 I am speaking of the people of my generation.  While there is no blame apportioning to that generation of Fianna Fáil politicians, there is a sense that they do not appreciate the anger and sheer sense of betrayal among the public.  Some of the people of my generation on the Government benches are as vigilant as their elders in defending the party line and the sins of those who have gone before them, politically.  If this country is going to mean anything, I believe our generation of politicians will have to come clean with the people and begin a new political paradigm that ensures it will not be about serving Fianna Fáil or the party first, but rather the people, so that they are sovereign.  It is the people on whom we will rely to guide us in terms of how the country should be governed. It is deplorable that a deal of this magnitude could be brought in by a Fianna Fáil Government, which through pure chicanery knows it will not have to implement half of it and that a large part of the deal will be very difficult to unhinge for any incoming Administration.  That is the trick of the Fianna Fáil party and that is what it has done for generations.  There will be Fianna Fáil speakers of my generation tonight who will defend the position and the deal with great gusto, knowing full well that they will be on this side of the House in six months time when we will have to defend and do our best to renegotiate a deal into which the Government has manoeuvred us.  It is chicanery of the highest order.  That we cannot vote on this deal makes a mockery of the very sovereignty of this country, and of this House.

3817	SeanSherlock	Labour	13882.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	299	" I wish to nail the lie that the universal social charge is a charge.  It is in fact a tax and let us call it what it is.  Financial Resolution No. 13 on which we voted on Tuesday stated: THAT, with effect from 1 January 2011, there shall be charged, levied and paid, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution, a tax to be known as ""universal social charge"" in respect of the income specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Table to this paragraph. So it is a tax and that tax is a time bomb that will seriously affect low-income earners with serious medical conditions who have medical cards and are exempted from the other levies.  The grouping together of the health and income levies under this universal social charge — that is, universal social tax — will mean that such people will now not be exempted from these levies, will be subjected to this tax and will have their already meagre and marginal incomes reduced further by the imposition of this tax.  It is completely and utterly regressive.  I find myself saying the same thing this year as I did in the debate on last year's budget; any principle of taxation must be such that it is meted out fairly and in an equitable fashion.  This runs contrary to the canons of taxation because it will affect those people on marginal incomes who also have serious underlying medical conditions in an adverse way by virtue of its imposition.  It is completely unfair and should be opposed.  I stand proud that our party will oppose the imposition of this tax because it is not what we are about in this Republic and any country with proper republican ideals would not impose such a tax in such a way as to affect those people who are on such marginal incomes. The Union of Students of Ireland provided a very good critique of Tuesday's budget and highlighted that the budget seeks to double the distance required to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of third level grant from 24 km to 45 km for all existing and new applicants from September 2011.  The net effect is that it will exclude working-class families from the potential to gain a grant.  It will exclude people living in rural areas from being able to get a third level grant and will act as a disincentive for people who want to upskill and come back into the educational sphere if they happen to be living such distances away from the third level institution they want to attend, which is also ludicrous.  If we are seeking to get people back to work, arbitrary bands such as this discriminate against those who will not qualify on the basis of distance. Carers are protecting vulnerable people and allowing them to live independently within the family home but subject to help from those who are caring for them.  Why has the Government created a further disincentive for anybody to take up a carer's allowance when the net impact could be to force more people into nursing homes?  There is a social economy and we need to take a more lateral view by regarding care givers as people who are making an active contribution and who should get a due reward for that contribution to avoid forcing people into nursing homes because of the disincentive."

3819	SeanSherlock	Labour	13882.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	385	 We are interested in the substantive issues.
3820	SeanSherlock	Labour	13882.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	455	 I wish to speak about social assistance schemes and, specifically, the farm assist payment.  The rate of payment has been reduced from €196 to €188 per person.  The qualified adult dependant allowance goes from €130 down to €124.80. I speak for people on farm assist because they are farming very small holdings and live, for the most part, in remote rural settings.  I am talking about parts of south Kerry, Connemara and Sligo and Donegal in the north west.  They often farm marginal land.  The fact that they are receiving the farm assist payment is proof that their incomes from farming are meagre.  These people will now suffer from the reduction in the rate of farm assist.  They will also be subject to increased charges to get their children to primary and secondary schools.  These families take the bus because do not have their own transport.  They will also be subject to the new universal social charge.  Their farm income will bring them into the social charge band.  While they may have been exempt from levies in the past, they are now being brought into the tax net.  The universal social charge is not a charge.  It is a form of taxation.  These people will suffer from the cut in social welfare rates but also because the Government has developed this inequitable social charge. We must speak for these people.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil no longer speaks for the marginalised people who live in rural areas.  The message sent by the budget to these people is that they may have voted for Fianna Fáil all their lives but they, and their votes, will now be taken for granted.  However, I can see from the number of calls I have received from people who are adversely affected by this budget that they are beginning to change their minds.  No longer can one fool these people with false promises or take from them in a disproportionate fashion. A millionaire makes a net gain from this budget while a person making a marginal income from a small farm makes a loss.  A family with a child in university will be further caught by the new adjacency ruling for third level grant qualification.  Why does the Government need to make these cuts?  There is no level of equity in them.  The person who shaped this budget cannot have thought laterally about how it would affect people on the margins. In spite of our political differences, we were always a nation of people who sought to look after our most vulnerable.  This universal social charge is grossly unfair.  In normal times, we might have accepted the need to reduce payments for farm assist, for example.  However, the universal social charge adds a further financial penalty for those people who are living on the margins. The same is true of the cuts in carer's allowances and in other rates.  Why must we consistently attack these people?  There is no logical explanation for it.  It is a disproportionate cut and is contrary to the canons of taxation.  One is supposed to levy tax in an equitable fashion but that has not been done in this case.  I accept that we are discussing the Social Welfare Bill, but taxation is pertinent to the argument.  People who are earning money and are also in receipt of social welfare will suffer a double whammy because they will come into the net of the universal social charge as well as suffering a reduced rate of social welfare.  I had a call today from someone who has a very marginal income and is dependent on a medical card, because of a genuine underlying medical condition.  The person had an exemption from the levies but will not be exempt from the new charge.  I have sought advice from colleagues as to whether such a person, despite the fact that the household has an income, should apply to the community welfare officer for a home heating grant in the coming months. We should ensure that households with a marginal income are not penalised further.  These people may be in their 30s and 40s and still making large mortgage repayments, which eats up a large part of their disposable incomes.  Imposing charges of this nature on those people could tip them over the edge and force them to rely on community welfare officers or supplementary welfare payments in order to sustain life and limb.

3823	SeanSherlock	Labour	13882.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	624	 I wish to share time with Deputy Ferris.
3824	SeanSherlock	Labour	13882.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	626	" I will share time equally with the Deputy. If I understood the Minister correctly, bank bonuses will be taxed at a rate of 90%.  I have not been informed as to the number of employees who will benefit from bonuses.  If, however, 90 employees of the banks which come under the guarantee were to benefit from a bonus of €40 million, each of them would receive €444,444.  If a tax rate of 90% was applied to this figure, they would each receive a net payment of approximately €44,400.  Any type of spin which seeks to dissipate the effect of paying these bonuses will not work because the beneficiaries will still receive significant sums of taxpayers' money.  An underhand approach has been taken and the legislation needs to be revisited in this regard. It is immoral that bonuses should be paid to fat cats when those on the minimum wage are countenancing a cut in their income.  Some 6,000 signatures of people opposing the cut were gathered in the past 24 hours by the Migrants Centre of Ireland whose members campaigned outside the gates of the House today.  The payment of bonuses to bankers is an affront when juxtaposed against cuts in the incomes of people who are barely surviving on the minimum wage.  It is an insult and certainly not how the country should do its business. The introduction of the new universal social charge will bring those on the minimum wage into the tax net.  The Minister misled the House last night when he stated those on the minimum wage would not be subject to taxation.  The universal social charge is a tax, as explicitly stated in Financial Resolution No. 13.  The Minister stated: ""In the measures I am presenting today, those on the new reduced minimum wage will not be brought into the tax net.""  Is he suggesting that those on the minimum wage will not be subjected to the universal social charge?  It is as clear as the nose on my face that if one earns more than €4,004, one will be subject to the charge at a rate of 2% up to €10,000.  There is a question mark over whether one can claim back the charge for the first €4,004.  This matter should be clarified.  The bottom line, however, is that the Government is not only reducing the minimum wage but removing the exemptions enjoyed by those on the minimum wage and subjecting them to a new tax. This measure is woefully inadequate and inequitable.  If one subscribes to the notion that everyone must share the pain proportionately, one must accept that the proposal requires people on the minimum wage to pay a disproportionate amount.  The measure must be opposed.  I am proud to oppose any proposal that seeks to reduce the pay of those who are on marginal incomes."

3834	SeanSherlock	Labour	13887.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	26	 The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, like all areas of the public service, will operate on a reduced budget in 2011. The gross allocation in 2011 for Defence and Army Pensions combined is €933m, an overall reduction of 4% on the 2010 allocation.  Investment in new equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces is normally provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, Naval Service ships and stores, property, building and engineering, communications and Information Technology equipment. Each of these Subheads will operate with a reduced allocation in 2011. The exception is the Naval Service Subhead, the allocation for which in 2011 includes continuation of payment for the new ships contract. The Department is engaged on an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces. The programme provides for new starts and the continuation of capital building projects already underway. No projects will be cancelled as a result of the reduced capital allocation in 2011. However the capital programme will be revised to reflect available funding. The specifics in relation to equipment acquisitions that will be deferred or postponed will be the subject of review with the military authorities in January 2011. The steady investment since 2000 means that the Defence Forces are well placed in addressing the challenges for 2011 and the adjustments required under the National Recovery Plan. The priority in the coming year will be on maintaining the capability of the Defence Forces to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by Government.
3835	SeanSherlock	Labour	13888.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2010-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	622	" I wish to share time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I propose to take approximately seven minutes.  I refer in the first instance to the Minister's speech on budget day.  He stated: ""In the measures I am presenting today those on the new reduced minimum wage will not be brought into the tax net"".  If ever there were a case of misleading the House, that was it.  Some four pages later, the Minister introduced the universal social charge, which was defined in the financial resolutions that came after the budget speech as a tax.  It is a tax of 2% on income from zero to approximately €10,000, 4% on income between €10,000 and €16,000 and 7% on income from €16,000 upwards.  Not only have those concerned suffered the reduction in the minimum wage rate of itself but they have been brought into the tax net and must suffer the double whammy of the universal social charge, a tax, on top of it. To give an idea of the logic and an insight into the mind of the Minister, I refer the House to the debate on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill of Thursday, 9 December in which the Minister stated: The Government decided that the pay of the Taoiseach and Ministers should be cut again.  When combined with the changes in taxation and PRSI in the budget, their pay will drop by an equivalent percentage amount . . .to the reduction applied to the minimum wage. Such is the logic that dictates how this Government works.  It is the logic of a Government that has thrown out the window the idea of poverty proofing any taxation or budgetary measure.  It is high time it was booted out of office and that a Government comprising the Labour Party was brought in so that we can reverse these measures and restore some degree of equity.  What the Government has done to people working on the minimum wage is grossly unfair; there is no other way of putting it.  It is contrary to any canon of taxation and to any republican ideal that we may hold in terms of how one treats workers in an economy, especially those on the margins and the low paid.  It is grossly unfair and it should be reversed. When the Labour Party launched its budget proposals two weeks ago, reference was made to the impact of the national minimum wage and the Government strategy for job creation.  According to the most recently available statistics, 41% of those on the live register have a manual, craft or industrial background.  One third of those aged between 15 and 24 years who have remained in the labour force are unemployed.  We are concerned that 116,000 workers, some 6.6% of the workforce, are living below the poverty line; that the working poor make up 24% of all those in poverty and 40% of all households in poverty; and that the minimum wage is especially relied upon for protection by women, migrants and other vulnerable workers. A total of 68% of those earning the minimum wage work in the hotel, catering, retail and wholesale trades.  Low or no employment growth is anticipated in these sectors in future because there will be a permanent contraction from boom-time employment levels.  Consequently, a cut in the national minimum wage will not lead to any direct job creation.  It is expected the primary areas in which jobs will be created in the coming year are financial services, insurance, business and communications services and health and ancillary care services, all of which are non-minimum wage sectors. The Irish labour force has already proved itself adaptable and flexible.  The decline in unit labour costs has exceeded the decrease in consumer prices, producer prices and GDP by 11.2% between 2008 and 2010.  In manufacturing, the real effective exchange rate is expected to be down 20% between 2008 and 2011.  Lower paid manual and craft jobs have been hardest hit by the reduction in gross earnings of -9.75% between the end of 2008 and the start of 2010. The Government's strategy is to use supply side solutions such as cutting social welfare benefits and the national minimum wage to address a demand-led problem in a slumping economy.  This is an illogical, incompetent and bogus argument for those who rely on the minimum wage."

The receipts accruing from the sale of the first five barracks were as follows: Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig €44.5m, Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy €973,889, Devoy Barracks, Naas €9.3m, Castleblayney Barracks €761,843, and Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge €25.4m.The Government decided on 1st July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. However, this will not now occur and the Department has retained control of this property. In relation to the Government decision of 14 October 2008 that approved the closure of the barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in Donegal the current position is as follows: Monaghan Military Barracks has been disposed of for €3.1 million; part of Connolly Barracks, Longford has been sold for €950,000 while some interest has been recorded in the remaining portion of the barracks; Rockhill Military post is being prepared for public sale, although an agreement is in place with another Government agency for the purchase of part of the lands; the sale of Lifford Military post remains under negotiation with another Government agency. Minimal costs are incurred in relation to the sale of premises as the preferred method is by public tender.

The award is backdated to 1 June 2006 and the Department of Defence estimates that the cost per annum of the award will be €266,412 with arrears of €1.1 million. Current public pay policy of the Government is dictated by the statutory prohibition contained in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act, 2009 which precludes increases to pay and allowances. Any claim, inclusive of adjudications, that has financial implications for the Exchequer cannot receive the sanction of the Minister for Finance under the terms of the 2009 Act. The legislation further provides that before 30 June 2011 the Minister for Finance shall carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the Act.
3841	SeanSherlock	Labour	13930.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	263	 I would be happy to get any seat at all, myself. I wish to speak to section 46 and in particular the betting duties.  Section 46(2) provides for the repeal of sections 17(2) and 17(3) of the Finance Act 2009 relating to the rate of betting duty.  I do not understand why the Minister is seeking to repeal these sections.  The Labour Party through its former spokesperson, Deputy Upton, published a very comprehensive paper entitled Raising the Stakes, in which she established a formula that would allow for a greater degree of online capture.  Mr. Kavanagh from Horse Racing Ireland gave a comprehensive overview on the state of play at today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  His overview referred to a fourth consecutive cut to the horse and greyhound racing fund which has fallen from €76 million in 2008 to €57.2 million in 2011 and that this was not a sustainable position from which to develop a key industry. Across the political divide we have as a common cause the interests of the horseracing and greyhound racing industries.  However, we must ensure the provisions at paragraphs (f), (e), (d) and (a) stand up to scrutiny.  I do not understand why the Government is not going after the online capture.  I would like further clarification as to how these provisions will translate in real terms.  I do not understand why the taxpayer through the Exchequer should continue to fund the industry directly through the provision of prize money.  We all understand it is an extensive industry and support the aims of Horse Racing Ireland, but we must ensure tax is captured from the punter and anybody who makes a bet whether it is online or through bookies offices on-street. I speak for people like Mrs. Bambury in Mallow, who is a second-generation bookmaker but who does not have an online presence.  The levy is being collected and yet there are bookmakers in Mallow — which has its own racecourse — which have an on-street and online presence also.  There is a disparity between the collection from the on-street presence and the lack of a collection from the online presence.  We should go after the online betting and we need to go after the exchanges.  It is disingenuous for certain celebrities to push the exchanges as being somehow very egalitarian in their outlook.  Our interpretation is that, by their very nature, the exchanges will pay out the prize money, which is fair enough.  However, it will be the Exchequer — the taxpayer — which pays the prize money at the racing stadia and so on.  We need to introduce a level playing pitch here.  I am not clear as to the various paragraphs.  We need a proper analysis.  Perhaps we should look at the French model in terms of collection.  The submission by Mr. Kavanagh to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was an in-depth one and there was an actual willingness on the part of Horse Racing Ireland to engage on the issue of capturing more revenue through more imaginative means.  I ask for a response to that point from the Minister of State. I am conscious of time.  HRI made a presentation to the committee today.  There are 9,530 registered breeders in Ireland, some 15% are overseas investors and 92% own fewer than five mares.  There were 416 stallions at stud in 2008, of which 362 stood for a fee of €7,000 or less.  We must support the industry but we must also ensure that such support does not militate against the taxpayer.  The industry must find more imaginative ways to fund the prize money henceforth.

Written documentation relating to the drug is provided to the relevant personnel via, inter alia, Instructions from the Director of the Medical Corps, documents published by individual units and the patient information leaflet that accompanies the medication itself.

3843	SeanSherlock	Labour	13987.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-03-24 00:00:00	Prelude	182	 A National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, otherwise known as the Hunt report, was published in January which set out a vision for the future development and direction of higher education in Ireland over the next two decades.  I support the broad analysis of the strategy in recognising the central role higher education plays in economic development and the need for continuing State investment in research activities.  As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation I will be working closely with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Minister for Education and Skills and other colleagues in co-ordinating delivery on the Government's strategic research priorities and in seeking to enhance and support the further development of our research system. There has been significant investment in research in Ireland over the past decade and we must continue to build on this investment.  We need to invest across the full range of disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences, to maintain a broad base of knowledge and capacity, coupled with targeted investment in specific strategic areas of national opportunity.  We must continue to encourage our institutions to work together and build critical mass around areas of key strength, and also support better and deeper working relationships with industry. While our institutions have developed a strong base of research activity, the focus of the next stage in our system's development must be on our ability to maximise the impact of our research results in terms of the commercialisation of that research and its conversion to real sustainable jobs.  In this regard, our programme for Government pledges to introduce a number of measures to support innovation and technology development in our institutions, including the establishment of a network of technology research centres which will focus on applied technological research in specific areas. It is also important to recognise the role research investment plays more generally across higher education.  The knowledge created through research and the skills associated with research activities has a direct bearing on the quality of teaching and learning in our institutions and on the formation of our students, both at postgraduate and undergraduate level.  All students should have some exposure to the latest research developments, and the connection between the teaching and research missions of institutions must remain.
3844	SeanSherlock	Labour	13987.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-03-24 00:00:00	Prelude	186	 Not only is research covered under the education and skills remit but there is also an important function under the enterprise, jobs and innovation remit.  Within that substrata there is a specific remit vis-à-vis Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI.  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, alone has a budget of €160 million for 2011.  There is a clear priority.  If we are to get people back to work, we must ensure that we maintain the current level of spending within that area in so far as possible so that investment can be maintained.  It will thus be possible through SFI, Enterprise Ireland and the research programme to build the synergies with the companies.  That is already happening; the model is well established.  However, I strongly believe that the Government’s job must be to try to grow and deepen that remit and commercialise the research.  If we can commercialise the research and continue that model, it will be possible to create more jobs from the third level sector.

3847	SeanSherlock	Labour	13992.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	119	 In the programme for Government a commitment has been given to establish a network of technology research centres that will accelerate the exploitation of new technologies and bridge the gap between research and technology commercialisation.  The initial focus will be in the key areas of biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing. In establishing the technology research centre networks I intend to build on the existing infrastructure of relevant centres for science engineering and technology, CSETs, strategic research centres and competence centres currently in place.  My intention is that over a period of time a programme will be devised that will put in place a structure, or structures, to deliver on this initiative.  Experience has shown that the best results are delivered when such centres are established by means of a competitive process.  In this way the best proposals come to the top, ideas can be generated and refined, collaborations established and both industry and research centres afforded an opportunity to define the most apposite agenda to bring together both the needs of the present and the opportunities of the future.  This process will determine both the timing and location of the centres. The programme for Government has committed to the initial establishment of three technology research centres, one in each of the fields of biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing.  The establishment of an applied biotechnology centre is timely because it will allow Ireland to fully capitalise on the very significant investments made in our basic research base since the late 1990s through highly talented people and the provision of world-class infrastructure.  Nanotechnology is set to have a big impact on sectors which are important to the economy, in particular ICT, life sciences and the food sector.  Ireland has made substantial investments in nanotechnology research, principally in CRANN in TCD and the Tyndall National Institute in UCC.  A Forfás review of the nanotechnology infrastructure in Ireland proposed that the State should take a more proactive role in driving the commercialisation of nanotechnology, diversify funding and collaborate with industry and academia to deliver on key focus areas and leverage existing resources more fully. The proposal to establish technology research centres can facilitate a transformational change, enabling Irish industry to exploit new opportunities.  The timeframe for future centres will be determined by the progress and success of the three initial centres.
3848	SeanSherlock	Labour	13992.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 We already have a process in place which adopts the clustering approach and brings together industry and research institutions.  The purpose is to create synergies between industry and the research function within third level institutions in order that research findings can be commercialised.  In the applied nanotechnology sector, for example, companies such as Aerogen, Analog Devices, Intel and Medtronic are all well established and already have well established links between industry and the research component.  The Deputy has raised a valid point as to when research takes place and when the findings are commercialised.  A relationship is developing between Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and it is growing deeper as the months pass and the sector becomes a more important part of the economy and our recovery.  It has become glaringly obvious that we need to ensure the two agencies work side by side to ensure jobs are created as a result. I will revert to the Deputy on the question of value for money and the return on our investment.  I have the same question and, therefore, beg the Deputy's indulgence in giving a response.  At this time I am being briefed as a new Minister of State and only developing my knowledge of the situation.  These questions are inherent in the process.  I will be happy to share information with the Deputy in due course.
3849	SeanSherlock	Labour	13992.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	125	 The Deputy's comments presuppose that there is no interaction between the private sector and the Government.  However, there is interaction, through the State agencies.  I invite the Deputy to look at the Enterprise Ireland website or interact with the organisation when he will see there is a vast array of companies which interact with both it and Science Foundation Ireland.  There is interaction between them so as to ensure research findings can be commercialised.  The three strands selected were industry-driven and driven by the technology leaders within the various competence centres.  The strategy is clear and well thought out.  If the Deputy has ideas as to where there should be research, I would welcome engagement with him in that regard. Question No. 36 answered with Question No. 34.

3853	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	226	 The programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government within thefirst 100 days of taking office, will provide a jobs initiative.  This initiative will contain apackage of measures to support employment creation and stimulate economic growth, while enhancing the activation supports available for those seeking employment.  It will deliver a minimum of an additional 15,000 places in training, work experience and educationalopportunities for those who are out of work as committed to in the programme for Government. Details of these additional activation places will be contained in the forthcoming jobs initiative launch, which is due next week.  The activation places outlined in the initiative will be in addition to 108,500 training places, 168,000 places in the further education sector and 156,000 places in the higher education sector, which the unemployed may access.
3854	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	 Yes.  I nearly referred to the Deputy as Minister as I marked him in a former mandate.  In terms of the issues raised vis-à-vis graduates, there will be a clear priority within the upcoming jobs initiative towards adopting a qualitative approach to internships.  The intention is to take a more holistic view of the workplace programmes which it could be argued were not necessarily providing for the progression required in allowing students to progress from graduate status into the workplace and move further within that stream.  There is a clear priority in terms of internships which are additional to the existing programmes.  It should also be noted that there are at least 276,564 training places provided for if one takes the FÁS programme, the Skillnets programme, the labour market activation programme, the PLC programmes and the VTOS programmes.  They are well encompassed and the 15,000 places are additional.  It is envisaged that there will be a particular emphasis on providing quality internships in order to stem the tide of emigration and ensure graduates will not just be educated to take up jobs in such places as Australia and other countries.  A qualitative approach will be taken to the placement of graduates.
3855	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	 I can give that assurance.  The point the Deputy made parallels my own thinking.  It is clear that what is required is a more holistic approach to how we view training.  It must be with a view to ensuring progression and an outcome in order that the person in training either stays within the organisation across a broad public or private sector sphere or that he or she moves on but that he or she will have gained a progressive experience.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy said.  As he will appreciate, at this juncture I cannot say what will be in the jobs initiative document, but there will be a clear emphasis on the points he made.
3856	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	 The programme for Government has been negotiated and mandated by the House.  The most prescient approach would be to await publication of the jobs initiative.
3857	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	 I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciaran Cannon. The review group was established in January 2009.  The review was carried out as part of the 2009-11 round of value for money reviews approved by the previous Government and conducted in accordance with the criteria for such reviews set out in the Department of Finance's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative Guidance Manual.  The emphasis in such reviews is on the efficiency and effectiveness of the programmes under examination to assess value for money in their delivery. The composition of value for money review committees can vary.  In this instance, membership of the steering committee was drawn from my Department and other relevant Departments and included an independent chairman, namely, Mr. Willie Soffe, former county manager of Fingal County Council, and two independent experts. All external stakeholders, including school patrons and parent and teacher organisations, were given an opportunity to make their views on the school transport scheme known.  The process included a call for submissions on a range of specific issues which resulted in 85 submissions.  In addition, following an assessment of these submissions and in order to give stakeholders a further opportunity to present their views, a day-long consultative forum was organised in October 2009 by the steering committee with a combination of individual sessions and an open forum discussion with the chairperson and committee members.  In this way, it was considered by the steering committee that all stakeholders were afforded a further opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the review process. I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to the issue of the cessation of the closed school rule, CSR, as it relates to primary school transport eligibility.  This change was announced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derived from a recommendation in the published value for money review of the scheme.  To put the matter in context, the review showed that the unit cost of primary school transport was €1,020 per child.  Furthermore, the four year national recovery plan requires savings of €4.5 million to be made through operational efficiencies and other savings measures in the school transport budget in 2011, rising to overall full-year savings of €17 million by 2014.  The aggregation of the measures being implemented arising from the value for money review will be an important element in achieving these savings. It is important to stress there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the closed school rule.  The first of these which will be implemented from September involves the uniform application of the distance criteria to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the closed school rule.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 km from the school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport.  In such cases, the children concerned may apply for concessionary transport. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012 to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the value for money review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are, in fact. attending their nearest school.  Therefore, the majority of these families will not be affected by this change. Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the on the ground impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have the information available to me this summer.  I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely effect of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.
3858	SeanSherlock	Labour	14028.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	273	 I concur absolutely with the points the Deputy is making on the basis that I have received representations from families who are fearful they will be split as a result of the implementation of this mechanism.  I am aware there is a further review taking place and that it will conclude at an unspecified date some time this summer.  It should take a deeper look at exactly how many will be affected.  I am also aware of the potential for certain parishes to be affected adversely, whereby an amalgamated school may, ironically, have reduced numbers in the future.  There is no question but that a number of issues arise from the implementation of the initiative.  However, I ask the Deputy to give us some time pending the outcome of the review which will result in a closer examination of the exact effect on families.  I hope it will give rise to a further set of public utterances by the Minister on how some of the issues could be tackled.

However, up to this year, Traveller pupils were not included in the valid enrolment for the purposes of implementing the more favourable Pupil Teacher Ratios in DEIS schools.  As I indicated in my response to his question of 24 March, Traveller pupils have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.  I can now advise the Deputy that 81 posts have been provided for this purpose.

The local authorities concerned will be notified of the outcome of the review in due course. Finally, given the current status of the Competition as outlined, it is premature at this stage to confirm review processes for future initiatives and funding provisions for existing Competition applications.

3867	SeanSherlock	Labour	14029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	299	 I assure the Deputy and this House that since assuming office I have incorporated a strong focus on our research and development strengths and incentives in my engagement with Government and business abroad, and with overseas governments and business presences in this country and I will continue to do so. I engaged with Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn recently when I met with her at the recent Council of Ministers meeting in Budapest.  I signalled to her this country's strong intention of seeking to ensure that we can draw down the maximum amount and hit the target of €600 million under the current framework programme 7 and that we would endeavour to surpass that target if we could but, furthermore and more importantly, that we would engage deeply with her on the next framework programme which we feel would ensure that we can continue on the programme for research and development in this country in order to ensure that the research engine keeps going and we can build on that. I do not know how much time I have.
3868	SeanSherlock	Labour	14029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	301	 In establishing the itinerary for any official visits abroad, the three State enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, work very closely together, with my own Department and with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The objective is clear: we want to achieve increased sales and exports and to headline our attractiveness as a locale for FDI.  This entails setting out our stall not only on the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the research and development tax credit but also on our intellectual capital and other attractions and in restoring reputational damage in that regard also. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. Ireland's ongoing development as a centre for research excellence continues to be a crucial factor in the attraction of foreign direct investment and SFI serves as a magnet of attraction for FDI through its support of research expertise in ICT, biotechnology and energy, its 341 principal investigator teams, its partnership with FDI and Irish companies in the nine centres for science, engineering and technology, CSETs, and the 19 strategic research centres, SRCs. As the agency tasked with attracting industrial FDI to Ireland, IDA Ireland approved 126 investment projects for support in 2010, including 37 research, development and innovation projects, where IDA support underpinned total RDI investment of approximately €465 million. Given the small size of the Irish economy, increased sales will be largely achieved overseas through exporting.  Enterprise Ireland is therefore focused on every aspect of the exporting and trade development process and the promotion of Irish companies on overseas trade visits is a key part of this process.  Overseas visits present an opportunity to build awareness among the international community of the availability of sophisticated products and services emerging from innovation and research and development within indigenous industry. We have other strengths, complementary to our fiscal regime and intellectual capital.  The availability of qualified labour, a workforce noted among peers internationally for its flexibility and adaptability and falling costs in terms of property, workforce and energy.  Our task, working together with the relevant Departments and agencies, is to marshal all of these strengths to deliver a positive outcome.
3869	SeanSherlock	Labour	14029.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	313	 On the first part of the question, as the Deputy is well aware the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already visited India and a further visit to the United States is envisaged some time during the summer.  The Deputy will also be aware that the President has visited The Netherlands.  Part of that process involved engaging on the European Space Agency, ESA, programme in which six Irish companies are already involved. An internal engagement in ongoing on the content services centre.  We do not have definitive timelines at this stage but there is a very clear direction within the programme for Government that we would build on the existing centres of excellence and create three additional competence centres.  That engagement is currently ongoing.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy on the matter, as I would be with any Member of the House, because it is in the national interest that we continue to ensure we can build on the €600 million that is invested in research and development in this country. The research and STI programme will be vital in order to ensure that companies already in this country which are based on the FDI model stay here and that we can build and add to what exists.  That is why the budget lines are vital.  I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.  I thank him sincerely for his kind remarks.

3877	SeanSherlock	Labour	14035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-11 00:00:00	Prelude	445	 I welcome the jobs initiative.  It was not designed to be a panacea and I do not believe a panacea can be achieved in such a short space of time.  What it seeks to do, however, is to provide an overarching framework which will underpin the economic recovery.  Within that framework there is a set of criteria so existing jobs can be maintained, the cost of doing business can be reduced, people can be helped back to work and there can be an attempt to restore confidence in the economy.  In that way people can begin the recovery which is so vital to our national interest and to the interests of those people who are looking at this House and asking what we are trying to do to fulfil our mandate to them. At this juncture members of the Opposition may posit the notion that the initiative does not necessarily fulfil all the obligations set out in the Labour Party or Fine Gael manifestos.  However, a programme for Government was agreed and mandated by this House.  In the normal day to day life of a parliament we score points off one another — this is vital and we have all done it.  The situation is that we will not get the 400,000 people we want to see back in work back at work within eight or nine weeks.  It is simply not possible.  What we can do, however, is to try to instil some confidence and some pride in the fact that governance in this country is based on the idea that we will serve the people——
3878	SeanSherlock	Labour	14035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-11 00:00:00	Prelude	447	 ——to the best of our ability.  We are trying within the very meagre resources we have — which were squandered — to try to fulfil a programme that sets down these very parameters. I fulfilled the research and innovation brief and am greatly encouraged that the research and development tax credit will bring about a benefit in ensuring we can try to fulfil that agenda.  It is vital to our national interest.  I acknowledge that the parameters set down in the agenda for research and development are as a result of work by successive Governments in the past, including the previous one.  Through the State agencies they identified the vital part research and innovation fulfils in supporting jobs.  The single message that emerges is that if we do not support the research and innovation agenda now, over a longer period it will be very difficult to be able to maintain existing jobs acquired through foreign direct investment.  If parent companies see that we are not continuing our investment in such research this may send a signal that this agenda is being sidelined.  It is vital that through initiatives such as the one announced yesterday we send a signal to the world that we will continue to ensure we can maintain the number of jobs we have, as well maintaining the quality link between research and foreign direct investment related jobs and thereby continue to attract further jobs. I wish to speak specifically about the area of research and development.  The positive evidence for economic recovery is clear.  This year, for the first time in three years, we can look forward to positive growth which we fully expect to accelerate as we move into 2012 and beyond.  This is by contrast with the years between 2007 and 2010 when the volume of goods and services produced in Ireland fell by 12%.  On foot of recent gains in competitiveness and improving external demand the exporting sectors of the economy are once again performing very well generally.  Last year exports increased by 9.5% in real terms, the strongest rate of growth for more than a decade.  Looking to the future, export growth is projected at around 6.75% in 2011 and 5.75% in 2012. Our focus now, and for the foreseeable future, is on the maintenance and growth of sustainable jobs.  I am glad to say the auguries are good on this front.  The number of foreign investment projects in Ireland rose by 15% in 2010.  These came about because of the proactivity of State agencies such as IDA Ireland which was responsible for the creation of approximately 11,000 jobs, more than double the figure of 5,000 for 2009.  That transcends two mandates, two Governments.  I acknowledge, as one must, this came about as part of a previous Government's mandate.  Moreover, these are quality projects.  In the area of attractiveness for research and development projects, Ireland is positioned in fifth place, behind Finland, Taiwan, Israel and Puerto Rico.  The joint Forfás and CSO 2009-2010 business expenditure survey on research and development, BERD, was published on 29 April and it, too, tells a positive story.  The BERD results indicate that in spite of expectations research and development expenditure in indigenous Irish businesses remained strong during 2009 and estimates indicate continued growth in research and development spend in 2010. During a recession one might expect to see companies make cuts in areas such as innovation and research and development spend but the BERD figures show that Irish businesses continue to invest in this area, mainly due to recognition of the importance of bringing new and innovative goods and services to the market in order to remain competitive and to grow exports.  This is very positive as this sustained research and development investment is what will underpin future economic growth, jobs and exports.
3879	SeanSherlock	Labour	14035.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-11 00:00:00	Prelude	449	 I wish I had more time but am glad to have what I have.  Today I attended an event where Johnson & Johnson, a company with a significant presence in this country, had its global management structure meet at Carton House.  That company sustains more than 2,000 jobs in this country.  Arising from that, Science Foundation Ireland hosted an event which showed how innovative Ireland is.  There was a showcase, with more than 30 companies and research functions coming together.  There is one clear message that comes across when one talks to people from Johnson & Johnson and other companies of that nature.  We must send a signal to them that we want to push out the boundaries on framework programme 7, which sees a target of some €600 million being achieved.  We must show that we can look forward, via the European Commissioner, Máire Geoghegan Quinn, and an enhanced relationship with the European Commission, to continuing, in framework 8, to push the boundaries further.  We must signal to companies like Johnson & Johnson our commitment to the research and development component and show we are committed to the spend in hitting certain targets that will see us grow jobs in the area.  Investments made in recent years are already beginning to pay off. The initiative launched yesterday is a signalling exercise to companies that have invested in this country.  It states we are still very serious about ensuring we can retain them and the right kind of conditions so the companies and researchers we fund will be able to sustain this economy in the long run.  During the 1970s we depended on agriculture in terms of inputs from a European Union perspective, while during the 1980s and 1990s it was infrastructure.  The next big tranche in sustaining jobs will be on the research, scientific, technological and innovation side.  We must continue with this agenda.

The Coast Guard is continuing to provide full day and night watch and rescue co-ordination services utilising the three centres in Dublin (National Maritime Operations Centre), Malin and Valentia. As part of my Department's commitment to the modernisation of the Coast Guard communications and coordination system a new national maritime communications infrastructure is being rolled out which will, when fully implemented, allow for greater interoperability and work sharing by the three centres. For example, work currently being undertaken on the project will facilitate the connection of the entire communications grid later this year, thus enabling greater efficiencies to be realised across the three co-ordination centres at that time. My Department undertook, as part of the Croke Park Agreement, to carry out a strategic review of the Irish Coast Guard, including the watch manning system which accounts for the majority of the Coast Guards staff. The Coast Guard review will also take account of efficiencies that may be possible due to the introduction of the new technology referred to earlier.

3893	SeanSherlock	Labour	14049.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	539	 I propose to take five minutes. I refer to a point made by Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan about maximising a potential within communities to grow that sector and to develop local markets.  I completely agree with the Deputy on that score.  I looked at models in upstate New York of community-supported agriculture.  I am very much on the same page as the Deputy on that issue.  A consolidation of the dairy sector and the meat sector would mean a smaller number of larger farms feeding into a co-operative structure which will probably be restructured.  One must then have due regard for the smaller community-based agriculture and the smaller farm and their place in a community and social structure.  Because they are so vital we need to ensure they are not left behind.  I hope that once the new Oireachtas committee structures are up and running we will be able to discuss those kind of issues.  Local authorities should be encouraged to maximise a new space and look at models being rolled out in places such as Tralee and other towns.  The use of land could be maximised especially around urban areas.  We need to ensure we do not lose the family farm structure.  The family farm should not be left behind. I would like to speak about the consolidation of the dairy sector.  Milk quotas will be abolished in 2015.  We all buy into the Food Harvest 2020 proposals.  However, we are not blind to the fact that it may present some constraints.  Will greater consolidation of the dairy sector result in jobless growth?  Will it result in the existence of just one or two milk dryers in this country?  What would be its permutations be for regional growth in this country?  There are challenges in this regard.  If there is a 50% increase in milk production, it must be accompanied by job creation.  We cannot have jobless growth. We must ensure we continue to add value to milk as a commodity.  That is where my research and innovation brief comes into play.  Teagasc is doing a great deal of work on infant formula at its Moorepark facility in Fermoy.  It wants to ensure the commodity has a research component and to add value in order to create jobs.  There is an engagement in that space.  If we do not engage politically, however, there is a danger that we could get left behind.  My role is to prioritise research so that we can mine as much potential as possible from the food industry while feeding into policy at the same time. I hope we can realise the potential of research in assisting the added value process.  If that does not happen, there is a danger that we will go down the commodity line and, as a result, fail to create the type of jobs we need to create in this sector.  I am very conscious of that.  It is all very well to talk about the expansion of the dairy and meat sectors, but there is a danger that growth will not be accompanied by job creation.  We all favour expansion.  We do not know what the post-2015 scenario will be.  Many younger farmers are scaling up at the moment because they can see the potential that offers.  We need to have due regard for those smaller farmers who do not have the required economies of scale to act in a similar manner.  We are conscious of the needs of that sector of the agricultural community.

Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 empowers road authorities, in the interest of the safety and convenience of road users, to provide such traffic calming measures as they consider desirable in respect of public roads in their charge. These measures would include traffic signs, road markings, ramps, rumble strips and measures to prevent, restrict or control access to a public road or roads by mechanically propelled vehicles. In the case of national roads the consent of the National Roads Authority is required.

This decision was taken by Vodafone and it raises some questions which have been clearly and well articulated by the Deputies.  I will not refer to my script because I honestly believe that serious questions have been raised, including the relationship with Vodafone which is a very profitable company.  When the issues were raised by the Deputies, Vodafone supplied the Department with some information which would not necessarily have answered the questions put.  With this in mind, I ask the Deputies to allow me some leeway so I can interact with Vodafone's public affairs section, and with Enterprise Ireland because I understand Rigney Dolphin is a client company, and so that we can examine the exact reasons the outsourcing has begun. According to a document received from Vodafone, it is expected that at the conclusion of the consultation process the credit and collections activity will be outsourced to a specialist supplier in Ireland.  Mobile data and customer operations will transfer to an existing group subsidiary based in Egypt and mobile back office will transfer to a subsidiary company based in India.  I also understand that Ireland is not the only country affected by the Vodafone move.  The group also moved call centre operations from Germany to Egypt. Rather than give the Deputies a pro forma answer, I ask them to allow me some leeway.  Deputy Adams referred to the Communication Workers’ Union and if it has been in touch with him, I would be more than happy to field a telephone call from it on this matter.  I cannot give any guarantees as it was a corporate decision.  All I can say is that we are committed to trying to retain jobs.  The State agencies in this region as well as the Louth County Enterprise Board will continue to promote Dundalk as a centre for inward investment and enterprise development. I acknowledge the Deputies have raised some interesting points.  Vodafone employs 1,200 staff in various locations in Ireland which is a significant investment in this country and that must be acknowledged.  However, questions have been raised this evening and perhaps this merits further examination.  I would be happy to oblige the Deputies in so far as I am able to do so and I will endeavour to help them in this regard.

In particular sports tourism can be a valuable instrument in the promotion of Ireland both at home and abroad.   Already this year the Aviva Stadium has hosted the Europa League Final which introduced thousands of Portuguese fans to our country.  Ireland is also hosting the Volvo Ocean Yacht race and  the Solheim Cup which will further boost our economy and showcase Ireland as a country worth visiting and doing business with. In terms of building on the Good Friday Agreement all-island sports are very important.  Cricket is a good example.  The Irish team plays for the Republic and the North, for Protestants and Catholics, and those of no particular persuasion.   The highlight of this sporting year may well have been our team's performance in the Cricket World Cup.   The defeat of England, in particular, probably did more to raise Ireland's profile in the sub-continent of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh than the work of our embassy and agencies combined.  It has opened a lot of doors. Success in sport provides a means of projecting a national image to an international public.

3899	SeanSherlock	Labour	14064.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	365	" In the EMI v. UPC High Court judgment of 11 October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton decided that he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and could not grant an injunction in respect of infringement of copyright against an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of “mere conduit”.  Accordingly, he stated that Ireland was in breach of its EU obligations in that respect. ""Mere conduit"" provides that if an information service provider does not initiate a transmission or modify the material contained in a transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission, it is granted a ""safe harbour"" against liability by virtue of the e-commerce directive.  However, this does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements. Two EU directives, namely, the copyright directive of 2001 and the enforcement directive of 2004 specifically require that the holders of copyright, authors, music composers, lyricists, record producers, etc., are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. My Department had considered that injunctions were already available under section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  However, this was not the court's view in the case. Having examined the High Court judgement referred to, which was extremely long and complex, the Deputy will be aware that my Department sought the advice of the then Attorney General as to the implications of the judgment and any legislative changes which might be required arising from it. In furnishing his advice on the issues raised, the Attorney General indicated it would be prudent to consult both with his office and with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with regard to any implementing measures arising from the ruling concerned to ensure that any such measures do not impose any unnecessarily onerous obligations on the Internet service providers. Accordingly, my Department has been in consultations with both the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as to the terms of any legislative instrument which should be made in this area and I expect to consult interested parties to the case very soon about proposed action in this respect. It is important to note that my Department does not propose to introduce a ""three strikes"" regime for disconnection from the Internet, as has been introduced by France and the United Kingdom, but simply proposes to provide explicitly for injunctions to be granted, as obligated by the two EU directives I mentioned earlier. Additional information not provided on the floor of the House. All other member states of the European Union would have powers to grant such injunctions enshrined in their domestic legislation by virtue of their transposition of the aforementioned two directives."

I am not in a position to provide a definitive timeline to the Deputy at this juncture but, as he stated, there is a clear and urgent need to engage on this issue and to ensure the directives are properly transposed.  I will revert to the Deputy.

Ireland became a member of the European Space Agency in 1975.  The purpose of Ireland's membership of the ESA is to participate in the European space programme, thereby facilitating innovative Irish companies to develop leading edge space technologies and to commercially exploit their ESA participation.  A total of €14.029 million has been committed in 2011 in respect of Ireland's subscription to the European space programme.  The focus of the Irish ESA industrial strategy is to build scale in participating Irish companies by supporting technology and product development that can be exploited in both the commercial space and other non-space markets. Ireland's ESA membership has contributed to the development of a highly knowledge-intensive industry sector with in excess of 70 Irish technology companies having secured ESA contracts since 2000.  ESA participation has a demonstrated direct effect on the participating companies' ability to generate commercial export sales in the supply of products in the commercial space and non-space market.  An analysis of Ireland's ESA membership in 2008 concluded that Irish ESA contractors generated a total turnover of €136 million in 2007.  A recent survey by Enterprise Ireland of the top 19 Irish companies representing over 60% of activities in the space sector projects an increased growth in ESA-derived sales from €35 million in 2010 to €96 million by 2014.  Employment in these companies is projected to almost double from 865 in 2008 to more than 1,600 in 2014 and 65% of these jobs are at graduate and postgraduate level.

A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies — IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place. Numerous measures have been taken to support enterprise to ensure that trade, exports and investment are positioned to retain sustainability and to ensure that emerging opportunities can be maximized.  These include: — R&D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland  — Competence Centres established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology and bioenergy, and the new generation of Technology Centres.  The Centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research.  — Supports for new start-up companies with the potential to achieve significant exports — 80 new High Potential Start Ups were established in 2010 — In 2010, over 49 pieces of commercially relevant technology were transferred from State Funded Research into industry. — The Enterprise Ireland Technology Transfer System facilitated the creation of 31 spin-out companies in 2010   — 526 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2010 worth over €2.5m, bringing the total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened to over 1,000. — Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years. At present SFI is supporting 29 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 20 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are collaborating with over 550 industry partners, both multinational and indigenous. — Both in 2009 and 2010, IDA investments of over €500m were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multinational sector.

3911	SeanSherlock	Labour	14076.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	422	 The programme for Government states: We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs who will retain a casting vote.  Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. To inject some context into the debate and, perhaps, give an account of the conclusions of the Duffy Walsh report, the so-called independent review, I will speak to some of the facts as they pertain to that report. The basic framework of the current JLC-REA regulatory system should be retained, the report concludes.  However, the system requires overhaul to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  The overriding purpose of the recommendations of the report is to create a framework within which greater efficiencies and necessary adjustments in payroll costs can be achieved in the affected sectors. Lowering the basic JLC rates to the level of the minimum wage rate is unlikely to have a substantial effect on employment, the report concludes.  Having investigated the size of the wage differential in some detail, the review team did not find evidence of substantial wage premiums.  Even to err on the side of the strand of the literature that finds the largest negative effects from minimum wages on employment, the results imply that cutting minimum wages lowers total earnings of low wage workers and has potentially important distributional consequences.  However, as is clear for all to see, the minimum wage has been restored. Those who advocated abolition of the current system pointed to the significant body of employment rights legislation now in force as providing adequate legal protection for employee rights and interests.  However, the review team concludes that it is not accurate to suggest that the body of primary employment rights legislation currently in force adequately covers matters dealt with by EROs and REAs.  Most of the EROs provide for overtime payments and premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  These provisions are a source of significant concern to employers in sectors which normally trade on Sundays.  They contend that the cost of employing staff on Sundays is now prohibitive.  Independently of the JLCs, the obligation to provide additional compensation for Sunday working is derived primarily from section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The review team believes, however, that the mode of compliance with that provision should be addressed to ensure uniform and fairer arrangements across the affected sectors. There are potentially substantial competitive gains that could be realised in some of the affected sectors by reforming the structure of decision making in JLCs so that the system is more flexible and responsive to the needs of particular sectors.  Competitiveness can also be enhanced by simplifying the system in a way that reduces the burden of supervision and compliance and by providing a degree of co-ordination and oversight over the system that ensures arrangements across sectors are reasonable and proportionate. Nothing in the Duffy Walsh report is radical, depending on one's point of view.  It speaks to the issue of a greater degree of flexibility but also to the issue of reform in regard to examining the rates for atypical hours, which is dealt with in the programme for Government.  A process is under way in which all the stakeholders have been consulted, including trade union interests, and I understand there has been extensive consultation in that regard.  I hope this will bring about a measured solution so that all parties, whether workers or employers, can find a middle ground in order that there is a degree of satisfaction on all sides.

3913	SeanSherlock	Labour	14085.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	576	 The drive to encourage Irish companies to use science, technology and innovation to increase competitiveness and value added is a significant pillar of government policy. As the government agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, Enterprise Ireland provides support to maximise the R&D and innovative potential of Irish firms in order to increase their capability to create new products, services and exports, which result in additional employment opportunities within these firms and in the wider community with which they interact. Cognisant of the difficulties and the investment requirements in starting an R&D activity for the first time, the programme of company R&D supports are designed to provide support for research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development and supports companies in their progress from an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&D activities. The Innovation Voucher initiative in particular is playing an important role in opening up access for small companies to a wide source of innovative acumen available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. The Initiative aims to drive an innovation cultural shift within small enterprise by promoting and encouraging a transfer of knowledge between Ireland's public knowledge providers and the small business community and in the process creating on-going and lasting synergies between the two.  The programme provides vouchers worth €5,000 that can be used by the average small Irish company to bring in knowledge that is new to the company. Since 2008, €380,000 worth of Innovation Vouchers has been awarded to companies in Westmeath and €30,000 worth of Vouchers has been awarded to Longford based companies. These Vouchers have been strongly promoted and feedback from companies has been positive, confirming that the application procedures, level of funding, the low level of bureaucracy and the frequency of calls are welcome features of this initiative. Direct R&D funding for larger projects is also available under the R&D Fund, which will enable companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&D activities. Since 2008 €567,000 worth of funding has been awarded to Longford based companies and €1.4m awarded to Westmeath companies. Increased innovation and start-ups particularly in the high technology sectors are vital to the future growth of the Midlands.  In this context, a grant of €2.54m was approved in order to establish the Midlands Innovation & Research Centre (MIRC), which offers a range of supports to entrepreneurs who wish to start a new, export focused, technology based business. The 800m2  facility at Athlone Institute of Technology has, as of December 2010, seven companies occupying units, employing 24 people, as well as 13 emerging entrepreneurs making use of the hot-desk facilities at the centre. Enterprise Ireland also funds applied research and supports the industry engagement capabilities of Universities and Institutes of Technology.  Since 2009,  Athlone Institute of Technology has been awarded over €4.6m in order to bolster their industry relevant research capabilities. This includes ongoing support for the Applied Research Enhancement Centre — SUNAT (Seamless Use through Network Abstraction Technologies), which is a translational research centre in the area of seamless communications and specialises in adaptive networking technologies. Through the vote of my Department, funds will continue to be provided to support and encourage enterprises, in particular small enterprises, to engage in R & D through a mix of funding, advice and expertise in order to help businesses transform in terms of improved productivity, greater efficiencies and achieving necessary product and service innovation to support growth and jobs.

Under this legislation Science Foundation Ireland invests in academic researchers and research teams who are most likely to generate new knowledge, leading edge technologies and competitive enterprises in the strategic areas of research that fall within the Foundation's remit, i.e. biotechnology, information and communications technology, and sustainable energy and energy efficient technologie. In order to achieve this objective, Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of funding programmes with funding determined on the basis of world-class research excellence and utilising a competitive process of international peer review. Funding of research proposals is dependent on the availability of funding at any given time and notifications of funding calls including eligibility criteria are publicised on the Foundation's website from time to time.

3918	SeanSherlock	Labour	14091.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	578	 I wish to speak specifically on Mallow.  I am not aware of any commitment that was given on Mallow General Hospital regarding accident and emergency services but I am open to correction.  I am a member of the Mallow Hospital Action Committee since I entered public life.  In Mallow and north Cork we have been through a very difficult and dramatic time, especially when on Tuesday, 19 April, it was announced by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that it would investigate the services at Mallow General Hospital.  At the time it was purported that the investigation was on foot of a complaint, which turned out not to be the case.  When HIQA visited the hospital, it found the staff, clinicians and physicians were absolutely and utterly beyond reproach. I note the comments of Deputy Donnelly.  In parallel with the investigative process, there was a roadmap for the reconfiguration of Cork and Kerry hospitals whereby the designation of Mallow would evolve or change to reflect the concerns that arose in the HIQA report.  All the stakeholders, including the hospital action committee of which I am a member, physicians, GPs and those who were referred to the hospital were part of the process.  The endgame was to ensure we could maintain the capacity of the hospital to deliver in order that more services would be taken out of Cork University Hospital on an elective basis, acute surgical services could be maintained and an urgent care centre or medical assessment unit established which would allow for the vast bulk of cases that present on an emergency basis to continue to be dealt with in Mallow.  We were on that route map until I discovered this week that certain forces within the HSE wanted to derail it and go way beyond the HIQA recommendations to reduce the capacity of the hospital to deliver. I am encouraged by a meeting I had with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  He reflected a statement he made when the HIQA report was issued, namely, that he was strongly committed to the role of smaller hospitals.  I can only speak for Mallow with any great authority.  We now need to get the roadmap back on track so that if we have to go through change management, it will reflect HIQA.  However, it must not be solely for budgetary reasons.  It has to allow for a situation to arise whereby we can take more of the elective procedures that can be done in Mallow and have a short stay surgical unit in order that we can continue to have an emergency department facility and begin to facilitate the structures around CUH. If we proceed along a pathway that seeks to excise acute surgery or the acute medicine programme from Mallow in a short space of time, I have no doubt it will contribute to the risk profile of larger hospitals like CUH.  We must be cognisant and very wary of the need to ensure hospitals such as Mallow have a role.  We need to consider in a more lateral way how the role can proceed.  Mallow differs from other hospitals in that HIQA has examined it and provided recommendations.  The issue of licensing is coming down the track.  No matter what one's political hue is — I accepted this a long time ago — one has to take the view that one does not reduce the capacity.  The HIQA requirements should be met, we should ensure that a hospital has a license to practice and that services can be delivered, albeit possibly in a different way.
3919	SeanSherlock	Labour	14091.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	684	 I have been informed by Enterprise Ireland that the agency has 175 client companies in Meath employing 4,109 people on a full time basis and 689 on a contract/part-time basis.  Since 2008 Enterprise Ireland has made payments of approximately €9.5m to clients in the county.  This funding has helped companies to retain and create employment, to explore new markets for innovative products and services and build innovation capacity. In 2010, 80 Innovation Vouchers were awarded to companies in Meath to the value of €400,000.  These Vouchers allow small Irish companies to access innovative solutions provided by Third Level Colleges.  The Voucher gives small companies the financial support to embark on a process of continuous innovation. Enterprise Ireland co-ordinates business start up workshops on a nationwide basis called EnterpriseSTART.  In the Dublin — Mid East region it is delivered over two afternoons for potential entrepreneurs with a desire to start technology or knowledge intensive businesses with good export potential.  It provides them with an overview of what is required to start a business and tests their business idea.  A workshop will be held in Ashbourne, Co Meath towards the end of July this year.

The PDST has ten full time members of staff who have the capacity to provide a service through the medium of Irish and this is being reviewed in the context of planning for the next school year.  Recruitment processes take account of the skills and capacity requirements of the service and relevant statutory requirements. In addition to the supports provided by the PDST, there are a number of other supports for teachers in Irish-speaking schools.  At post-primary level, An tSeirbhís Tacaíochta Dara Leibhéal don Ghaeilge is a full-time team dedicated to providing support to teachers of Irish in all post-primary schools.  Other supports include summer courses and online resources.

The provision of the proposed new secondary school in Skibbereen was included in that announcement.  As a site for the school was secured in 2009, it had not been possible to include this project in any of the bundles already being procured.  As part of the jobs initiative recently announced by the Minister, I confirmed that I am developing two further bundles of PPP schools.  The provision of the school in Skibbereen will be considered in this context. The issues to be considered in the timing and bundling of schools include, site availability for each school, geographical spread and total cost of the proposed school bundle.  The timescale for the provision of the school is approximately four years from the time the bundle is announced.

The Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the registration of teachers including the recognition of teaching qualifications.  Neither I nor my Department have a role in this process. Currently, there is a large range of engineering courses which are recognised for the teaching of Mathematics and/or Applied Mathematics.  These are listed on the Teaching Council's website.  I am advised by the Teaching Council that eligibility for registration depends on the amount of Mathematics or Applied Mathematics covered in the undergraduate degree course. The Teaching Council has engaged with the professional body for engineers, Engineers Ireland, on this matter with a view to identifying further study options through which persons with engineering degrees not recognised above can make up for shortfalls in mathematical content in their qualifications. Options identified include a Higher Diploma in Mathematics/Mathematical Studies available in a number of Irish Universities or one or more modules in Mathematics available from the Open University.  Engineering graduates interested in following one of these routes should check with the Teaching Council beforehand to ensure that the proposed qualification would make up for any mathematical shortfalls in their engineering degree.

The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs plays a key role in advising on the future skills needs of enterprise.  Its reports are disseminated directly to third level institutions and provide a valuable input to the development and amendment of course curricula.  EGFSN research and engagement between higher education providers and industry also informed the development and selection of the part-time higher education programmes being funded through Springboard.  Under this new initiative 6,000 places are being provided for unemployed people in areas where employment opportunities are expected to arise in the future, ranging from the food industry to ICT to green technology and international services.  My Department and the HEA, in collaboration with the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, are also working closely with the ICT industry to develop further responses to specific skills needs that have been identified by that sector.
3930	SeanSherlock	Labour	14092.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-07 00:00:00	Prelude	317	 My attention had not been drawn to the specific comments of the UK company MD to which the deputy refers. However, I am aware that the Irish equivalent company point out that cloud data is not in any different position than any other kind of data in terms of its exposure to government access, whether by the US or many other countries. A recent report by ENISA, the EU body responsible for information security concluded that holding data in the cloud could represent both a risk and a protection in that the concentrations of data may be an attractive target but the economies of scale can allow defences to be more robust. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has pointed out that robust EU and national data protection laws must be complied with and that the legislation is technology neutral and must be complied with equally when data is moved to the cloud. Ireland is extremely well-placed to take advantage of the rapidly-growing international potential of cloud computing. A recent report commissioned by Microsoft has estimated that by 2014 the cloud computing industry in Ireland could be worth €9.5 billion and employ 8,600 people. Now more than ever we must do everything we can to seize opportunities like this. I do not believe that these jobs will be created automatically, and Government must act decisively and urgently if we are to position Ireland as a world leader in this high-growth sector. In May I announced the establishment of a €5 million applied research centre in cloud computing, which will bring industry and researchers in this sector together in order to turn good ideas into good jobs.  I have also established a cross-Government implementation group on cloud computing, to support the implementation of the ambitious programme for Government commitment on cloud computing.

3940	SeanSherlock	Labour	14097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	489	" I move amendment No. 2: To delete all words after ""Dáil Éireann"" and substitute the following: ""commends the Government for continuing to prioritise the allocation of resources to support the education of pupils with special educational needs; notes that the Government is continuing to fill special needs assistant posts and resource and learning support teacher posts at a time when a moratorium on filling posts applies in the wider public sector; notes the level of expenditure on additional dedicated resources for special education of some €1.3 billion which is almost 15% of total education expenditure; notes that provision has been made for the coming school year for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) which is more than were in place in 2010 and in preceding years; notes that the number of resource teachers for special needs children in mainstream schools is at an all time high of 9,950; notes that the cap on Special Needs Assistants was introduced by the previous Government when Ireland entered the Programme of Financial Support with the EU and IMF; notes the recent review of the special needs assistant scheme and in particular the findings that the scheme has assisted as many students as possible to be included in mainstream schools, that it is contrary to best practice for SNAs to adopt a pedagogical role and that there is a need to clarify the ‘care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals alike; notes that school transport for children with special educational needs continues to be prioritised and that no charges have been introduced for these pupils; and recognises that special education will continue to be a priority for the Government and that the considerable provision of resources for special education must be deployed in the most equitable and effective manner possible."" The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has asked me to apologise for his absence from tonight's debate.  He is in Chicago as part of efforts to increase international student numbers in Ireland, in line with commitments made in the programme for Government.  In the education area, he will address the National Association of Fellowship Advisors, attend a function aimed at promoting the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme, promote links with Irish-educated alumni, and promote Ireland to a group of high schools.  He will also hold meetings with the Chicago Board of Education and engage in a number of wider activities for the Irish community in Chicago and the American Ireland Fund. This evening's debate provides an opportunity to clarify some of the confusion evident in some of the public comment on the provision of supports for children with special educational needs.  It also provides me with an opportunity to reassure all parents of children with special educational needs that their children will continue to have access to an education appropriate to their needs. It is important to note that 15% of the entire budget of the Department of Education and Skills — €1.3 billion — will be spent in support of children with special educational needs this year.  The provision is in line with expenditure in 2010 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut. The Government is committed to the protection of front line services for pupils with special educational needs.  This year we will fund approximately 9,950 resource and learning support teachers in schools.  That represents an increase of 350 over last year.  Additionally, we have protected staffing levels in special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools.  More than 1,000 teachers are in place in special schools.  The average pupil-teacher ratio in special schools nationally is 5.6:1.  Also, 500 special classes will be in place in mainstream primary and post primary schools. All sides of the House will recognise that it is necessary to ensure that educational services are delivered within the limits of the resources available.  Within these limits however the Government will prioritise and support special educational services.  The Government will not however re-visit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme."

3942	SeanSherlock	Labour	14097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	493	 Okay.  Deputy Healy.  Members should bear with me.  Through the Chair, I ask Deputy Halligan to forgive me.  It is the Munster intonation. There are 10,575 SNA posts available nationally for the coming school year to support eligible children.  Unlike other areas of the public sector, SNA vacancies are being filled up to this number.  In 2001, a total of 2,988 SNAs were employed at a cost of €33.7 million.  By 2010 that had risen to 10,543——
3943	SeanSherlock	Labour	14097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	495	 ——at a cost in excess of €340 million.  As Deputy McGrath is interjecting, it should be noted for the record——

3947	SeanSherlock	Labour	14097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	503	 That should be put on the record of the House.
3948	SeanSherlock	Labour	14097.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	505	 In all, there are more than 20,000 adults, including SNAs and resource-learning support teachers in schools to support children with special educational needs.  Each year my Department makes detailed plans, taking account of population growth, for future allocations of resources across all areas of education, including special education.  In this context, Deputies may wish to know that the pupil population to SNA ratio has reduced from 252:1 in 2001 to 78:1 in 2010.  By any standard the development and growth of the special needs assistant programme has been remarkable.  I wish to stress that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources it is considered that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school. Deputies will be aware of the recent value for money and policy review of the SNA scheme.  The review has found that the scheme is supporting schools in meeting the needs of eligible students, and that it has assisted as many students as possible to be included in mainstream schools.  However, the review also points to a possible over-allocation of SNAs in schools of which 10% are in special schools and up to 27% in mainstream schools. The decision to introduce a cap on overall SNA numbers means that all SNA posts will now be subject to annual review and there will be ongoing monitoring of overall SNA numbers throughout the year, in accordance with the recommendations of the review.  That will facilitate the allocation of SNA support in the most fair and equitable way.  I note Deputy Clare Daly's points in that regard, but if one is to have teaching assistants then one will have to have a teaching assistant scheme.  It is either an SNA scheme or it is a teaching assistant scheme.  The case she made was a genuine one. The review has also concluded that the SNA scheme has moved away from the objectives of the scheme originally envisaged, which was to provide for children's care needs in an educational setting, and has moved towards SNA involvement in behavioural, therapeutic, pedagogical and administrative duties.  The review concludes that this may stem from a lack of understanding of the role of the SNA which has led to inefficiencies in the system.  Schools and parents have come to expect the allocation of SNA posts for students whose care needs do not meet the terms of the scheme.  I wish to be clear in explaining to the House that there are no plans for the expansion of the SNA scheme beyond the provision of supports to schools to enable them support the care needs of pupils with disabilities. The value for money and policy review is clear in that respect when it states the crucial importance of communicating the purpose of the SNA scheme in order to ensure that the care role envisaged for the SNA is understood by schools, professionals and parents, and that SNAs are not used to supplement teaching or as therapeutic support for students.  The NCSE allocates separate additional teaching expertise to provide the additional teaching support needs for these children. I wish to be clear on some key issues regarding the SNA scheme: SNAs are being allocated on the basis of priority criteria and in a consistent manner.  The NCSE will use its professional judgment in that regard.  Some of the priority criteria which apply are: ensuring that the minimum SNA to special class ratio is maintained in both special schools and special classes; ensuring that schools which have enrolled children with the most significant special care needs are supported to meet those needs; ensuring the provision of support for children with incontinence issues; and ensuring that the full-day cover provision is not reduced below a full day. To ensure that the allocation of SNAs for the 2011 to 2012 school year is managed in a prudent and responsible manner, the NCSE, in consultation with the Department, has decided to retain approximately 475 of the 10,575 SNA posts in order that they are available to be allocated over the remainder of the school year.  That will ensure the NCSE retains the capacity to meet urgent cases as they arise over the school year while also ensuring that the overall number of SNA posts allocated will remain within the capped number of 10,575.  The reserve posts will be prioritised to address appeals and emergency cases, acquired injuries and new assessments during the school year, new entrants to schools, and reconsideration of allocation levels for schools in which interventions have been unsuccessful. A process will be in place in the new school year to review allocation decisions to ensure correct procedures were followed and that they comply with the Department's policy.  I understand the NCSE will communicate this to schools early in the new school year.  Schools, for their part, must demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect. In 2010 the Department provided 9,600 posts for learning support and resource teaching.  It is intended to provide 9,950 learning support and resource teaching posts in the 2011-2012 school year, an increase of 350.  This is an historically high level of provision.  It has been calculated that, based on the number of applications received to date for resource teaching support by the National Council for Special Education, an allocation of 90% of the identified resource teaching allocations can be made to schools in the first instance.  This will provide schools with the majority of their allocation while preserving enough capacity to ensure the Department can provide for late or emergency applications while remaining within ECF obligations. I wish to clarify for the House that 4,538 posts available in mainstream primary schools under the general allocation model of additional teaching support are not affected by the 90% measure.  The effect of a 90% allocation of resource teaching support means a reduction of six minutes per hour of resource teaching allocated.  Schools can make up additional time through grouping of children, doubling of children and more effective management of teaching time.  When the full level of demand is known, the initial 90% allocation may be revisited. As Deputies are aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the NCSE and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  The Department has established a cross-departmental working group, including relevant agency personnel, to consider each non-commenced part of the Act.  The group will focus on preparing a plan for the implementation of the Act. The Government continues to ensure all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments.  We have committed to reversing the cap placed on the number of psychologists employed by the National Educational Psychological Service.  The issue of recruiting more psychologists will be kept under review in the context of the overall employment control framework in the public sector. There are no changes proposed to the provision of school transport services, including escorts, for eligible children with special educational needs.  At present, my Department also provides a direct grant to 500 parents to support their school transport costs.  The grant has been reviewed and from the start of the coming school year it will be based on Civil Service mileage rates. In the face of economic turmoil, the Government has prioritised the provision of supports for pupils with special educational needs.  As well as teachers and special needs assistants, we will continue to provide assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  We will protect front-line education services as much as possible within the resources we have to work with.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country.  All areas of Government will have to manage on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.  I commend the Government's amendment to the House.

3963	SeanSherlock	Labour	14098.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	525	 The EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, (FP7) covers the period 2007-2013 and has a budget of approximately €50 billion.  The national target for drawdown by Ireland from FP7, over the seven-year period, is €600 million.  The tabular statement that is being provided with the official reply provides details of the amounts of funding awarded to Irish participants to date. The number and value of projects funded from FP7 which have a North-South dimension, are as follows: Some 43 projects, securing €35.2 million, have a North-South dimension.  These projects involve 119 Irish participants (47 from Northern Ireland and 72 from the State). The amount of funding awarded was €8,495,247 to Northern Ireland participants, and €26,699,845 to participants from the State.  The period covered, for which latest figures are available, is from 2007 to April 2011, inclusive. Details of the number and value of projects funded, in which the lead partner is from the State and includes a researcher from Northern Ireland, are as follows: 16 projects securing €20.9 million, have the lead partner in the State and include a researcher from Northern Ireland. The breakdown of funding to these projects is €17.5 million to the participants from the State and €3.4 million to participants from Northern Ireland. FP7 has long been identified as an area where cross-border collaboration is feasible and makes eminent sense.  In order to maximise Irish participation in FP7, Ireland's National Support Office, which is headed by Enterprise Ireland, leads an all-island approach by all of the relevant agencies to promote FP7 and support the participation of companies and research organisations to provide significant competitive advantage for the island of Ireland.  The aim is to focus on areas and instruments that present opportunities for cross-border collaborations, including opportunities to exploit existing and future sectoral networks.  One example of this approach was the recently held Regions of Knowledge Conference in Belfast, on 30th   June, 2011, which was attended by representatives of the research community from both sides of the border.

However, the Department does have a Permanent Representation Office in Brussels staffed by 3 officers dealing with EU policy matters on a full-time basis and supported by one officer providing administrative support on a shared basis with two other Government Departments.
3965	SeanSherlock	Labour	14099.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-14 00:00:00	Prelude	556	 Ireland is a successful major centre for Industrial operations.  In the ICT sector nine of the top ten software companies in the world have substantial operations here.  The ready availability of top quality talent has been an important contributing factor to the success of both multinational and indigenous companies in Ireland.  The cluster of internationally renowned firms and smaller Irish companies offer a range of attractive career opportunities for professionals. I am aware of the skills shortage currently being experienced by industrial employers, and particularly within the ICT industry.  As part of frequent discussions which I and my Department and agencies have with Industry, I recently met with ICT Ireland, the ICT arm of IBEC along with my colleague, Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. Industry representatives outlined their concern at the shortage of skilled graduates for the vacancies that currently exist in this industry. The Minister for Education and Skills outlined his plan for meeting the needs of the ICT Sector in the short and medium term.  This includes the Springboard programme, which will provide approximately 6,000 part time higher education places for unemployed people.  The programmes are in areas where skills shortages or potential employment growth opportunities have been identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN).  Nineteen public and private higher education providers will offer a total of 65 ICT courses, with a target enrolment of 2,074 students.  This is the single biggest area of provision (31%) supported through Springboard. I also met on 11 July with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which represents US Business in Ireland, and this was one of the issues raised.  The Chamber has recently done a survey of its members which indicates a number of vacancies which are difficult to fill, arising mainly from skill shortages in the ICT and Engineering fields.  The number of vacancies revealed in this survey was similar to the number identified by the EGFSN.  The Chamber had also discussed the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It very much welcomed Minister Quinn's proposed Action Plan on the issue, and indicated that industry is anxious to play its part in implementing this.  The Chamber also expressed the view that, for the longer term, initiatives in second level education in mathematics and science would be crucial to addressing the matching of skills with Science, Technology and Engineering employment opportunities.

3967	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	258	" The ""green economy"" is a term used to categorise a range of economic activities which contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions, better resource usage, and respect for the environment.  It covers a range of activities from carbon trading to energy efficient and environmentally friendly products, renewable energies and eco-tourism. The programme for Government makes commitments to supporting the sector, including through increasing support for energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes, establishing Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment, and expanding renewable energy generation to achieve our renewable energy targets.  Clearly, implementation of this agenda spans several Departments and State agencies. As part of the jobs initiative, the Minister for Finance announced that an additional €30 million would be invested in the national retrofit home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes this year.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has indicated that this initiative will support an additional 2,000 jobs in 2011.  Other measures announced in the jobs initiative help to promote jobs in green tourism, such as halving the lower rate of employer's PRSI until the end of 2013 on jobs that pay up to €356 per week, removing the travel tax and cutting the lower rate of VAT. The green economy is an area which could become strategically important for Ireland at a global level.  We have a number of particular strengths which can realise jobs and growth opportunities and contribute to export-led growth.  The sector already employs 18,775 people and the value of the Irish market in these sub-sectors was estimated at €3 billion in 2010.  However, the value of the sector globally is set to increase rapidly, driven by a range of factors, including EU directives and regulations, rising energy costs, increased investment in environmental services and infrastructure, consumer preferences, and climate change and international agreements. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. The Department's agencies, namely, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, have established units dedicated to working with both indigenous and multinational companies in the so-called cleantech sector.  A practical example of the success of Enterprise Ireland's supports for the sector was seen in last week's announcement of the creation of 145 jobs in County Galway in the manufacturing of wind turbines.  Another notable development is that green financial services are part of the new strategy for the IFSC which was launched by the Taoiseach last week. A number of policy issues need to be addressed to realise the potential of the sector.  Some relate to planning and licensing. Others relate to the capacity of the electricity grid and the price for delivery of renewable energy.  I will work with other colleagues to develop this policy framework."
3968	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	260	 I agree with the Deputy on the change of emphasis over recent years, but I disagree with him on the Green Party's agenda.  All parties in the House have been engaged with the agenda for a long time.  An additional 2,000 jobs were created in 2011.  A Cabinet sub-committee is dealing directly with this area and it gives Government impetus to it. There is a challenge for Ireland in the next phase of commitments which we have to meet on carbon reduction.  That should give rise to new opportunities in this field.  It is not possible to quantify how many jobs will be created.  No one can do that and it would be unrealistic to do so.  However, I agree with the Deputy in another respect.  A SWOT analysis was carried out and it showed that there was a lack of coherence in overall policy due to a large number of State and local agencies being involved, and there was some fragmentation of the research base.  That is now being firmly taken in hand.
3969	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	264	 The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach launched the strategy for the international financial services industry 2011-16.  One of the initiatives is the creation of the Green IFSC whereby we pin down areas in which there are new opportunities ranging from carbon management, IP commercialisation, private equity investment to green tech fund management.  The Government is engaging in this space.  It is impossible, realistically, to set a finite target for job creation.  The main point is that we are setting down the policy framework by which we can drive these agendas and ensure strong political co-ordination and coherence. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's proposal, I respectfully ask him to make contact with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and that he seek to meet him to ask him to consider it.
3970	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	265	 The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I have had separate meetings recently with the European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, with a view to building strong relationships to ensure Ireland maximises the benefits of our position in the European Union in terms of jobs and opportunities to further develop the economy.  Most recently, the Minister met the Commissioner on 24 June when they held an event in Dublin to highlight opportunities for Irish researchers, businesses and educational institutions under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, FP7.  The Commissioner highlighted the fact that upcoming calls for proposals under FP7 in July 2011 and July 2012 would be worth approximately €18 billion. With a budget of over €50 billion in the period 2007 to 2013, FP7 is the European Union's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a national support network has been put in place, headed by the national director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the programme.  This support structure ensures a co-ordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all the Departments, agencies and other organisations involved.  Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the programme.  The range of financial supports available includes travel support which assists researchers to meet potential partners and proposal preparation support for academic co-ordinators and companies, covering all costs included with the submission of FP7 applications.  Ireland's target for the drawdown of funds from FP7 in the lifetime of the programme is €600 million.  Achievement of this target is well on track, with some €300 million already awarded to date.  I am determined that we will achieve the target set. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. The next European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, to be called Horizon 2020, will operate from 2014 to 2020, for which the European Commission has proposed a budget of €80 billion in its recently published multi-annual financial framework for the period.  While no target has been set for the next framework programme which has yet to be proposed by the Commission and agreed by the Council, I am determined to ensure ambitious Government policies are in place in order that we can continue to improve our performance.
3971	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	267	 There is a multi-layered approach in this respect.  There is clear recognition of a strong policy started by successive Governments which forms the foundation for ensuring the maximisation of the potential for the drawdown of funds.  We are already involved in a research prioritisation exercise that will seek to concentrate on specific themes of research and, ultimately, commercialise that research.  However, it is important to have regard to the educational aspects of basic research and the commercialisation agenda.  The prioritisation exercise which involves all of the State agencies interacting with each other and the Department is about ensuring we maximise the potential to meet our targets.  In regard to Horizon 2020, the process seeks to ensure we will be more ambitious and that Ireland will become an agenda setter for the programme.
3972	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	269	 If I was to proffer a personal opinion, I would contend we could be doing more on the commercialisation agenda.  If we were spinning out more companies, for instance, from the higher education institutes, that would ultimately lead to further job creation.  It must be remembered also that our investment in research, or research, development and innovation, through the collaborative approach with all of the foreign direct investment companies housed here, ensures their continuation in the country.  It also ensures greater innovation in these companies.  It is a two-prong approach.  It is about trying to achieve more in the commercialisation space through the creation of more companies and also about ensuring the existing foreign direct investment, FDI, infrastructure is not compromised in any way.  It is also about ensuring the research component is maintained.
3973	SeanSherlock	Labour	14104.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Prelude	636	 The High Court indicated that it intends to grant an order declaring sections 42, 43, and 45 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and section 45 of the 1990 Act to be unconstitutional.  In this new Bill, the response by Deputy O'Dea has been to import the exact provisions of four original sections that had featured in the now lapsed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009.  The 2009 Bill had been introduced by the last Government in the summer of 2009 but it did not proceed beyond its Second Stage reading in this House, which was completed on 11 February 2010.  Regrettably that Bill failed to make any progress on the last Government's legislative programme until it eventually lapsed with the end of the last Dáil. The only really novel provision in this Bill is at section 7, which repeals section 45 of the 1946 Act which makes it an offence for an employer to pay to a worker remuneration less than the statutory minimum remuneration, or to fail to comply with statutory conditions of employment.  This section, which the High Court ruled was unconstitutional, was the subject of recommendation 19 in the independent review report, the Duffy Walsh report.  That report recommended that the mechanism for enforcing EROs be brought into line with that for regulated employment agreements and that, as an alternative to a criminal prosecution, a complaint could be brought before the Labour Court.  The report recommended that NERA be authorised to bring such a complaint in respect of either an REA or an ERO. I welcome the proposal to decriminalise the initial steps in the enforcement process of EROs.  It makes sense, as Kevin Duffy and Dr. Walsh had recommended, to allow room for NERA to bring a complaint to the Labour Court on behalf of an individual or group of workers rather than retain the current arrangements where enforcement is only by way of a prosecution before the District Court.  Unfortunately the incorporation of the proposed amendment on the enforcement of EROs at section 7 is the only provision in the Bill that responds directly to the specific recommendations in the independent review report. The new Bill does not contain any provisions to respond to other specific changes that were called for in the recommendations of the Duffy Walsh report.  Recommendation 16 of that report called for all of the changes that were proposed in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 to be enacted along with amendments to cover the additional recommendations made in the report regarding the legislative framework within which both the ERO and REA systems operate.  It makes no sense to tackle this task in a piecemeal way or to leave REAs to the mercy of some continuing legal challenges.  Unfortunately this Bill does not address the significant range of changes called for by Kevin Duffy and Dr. Frank Walsh to safeguard the statutory wage-setting machinery from the threat of constant litigation and judicial review. Recommendation 1 of the independent review report also called for an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 to provide a means whereby the scope of the particular establishment orders of JLCs could be reviewed by the Labour Court.  The report also recommended that the Labour Court be empowered to undertake periodic reviews of EROs in the interests of greater clarity as regards their purpose and the classification of the workers and the types of enterprises covered.  Action with regard to these recommendations will be crucial to providing protection for EROs against further legal challenges. Recommendation 9 of the independent review report also called for amendments to be made to the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 regarding the constitution and proceedings of JLCs.  This is another critical area in which action is now required in light of the High Court ruling. Unfortunately at a time when it is vital to provide more certainty for vulnerable workers in low-paid sectors the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011 presented by Deputy O'Dea offers only limited protection.  I am convinced that the urgent preparation of substantive legislation represents the only reliable means of guaranteeing protection for vulnerable workers in low-paid sectors.

Planning for this event is being coordinated by the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government.  Hosting City of Science will serve three functions. It will provide a platform to showcase the best of Irish science and research across all disciplines; boost the international standing of Ireland as a leading centre for scientific and research excellence and to provide a framework to demonstrate the world class research system that we have built over the last decade; and, promote careers in science, technology engineering and maths among prospective students and their parents. With regard to the third function, on 6 April last I announced a call for proposals for a year-long programme of events to engage the citizens of the island of Ireland in science.  The intention is to devise a programme of events that will demonstrate the reach of science into almost every aspect of our lives — education, business, the arts, sports and our communities.  Partnerships are being sought with organisations and individuals who wish to develop events that will encourage the public to engage with science. The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser has confirmed that, when this call closed at end June, over 320 proposals had been received from across the island.  An initial overview of these proposals shows strong elements of creativity, diversity and concern to make science more accessible to the citizen.  The proposals are currently being assessed and it is planned to produce a first outline of a programme of outreach activities in the Autumn.

3986	SeanSherlock	Labour	14162.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-15 00:00:00	Prelude	8	 In accordance with the Programme for Government, I am investing in the National Cycle Policy which calls for a wide programme of action including publicity, education, development of a national cycle network; investment in cycling infrastructure and demonstration projects, including off-road cycle tracks in rural locations; legislative change; improved enforcement of traffic laws and support for sports cycling. In terms of the development of a national cycle network, the National Roads Authority completed a scoping study for a network in 2010. This study is available from www.smartertravel.ie   and identifies potential route corridors, although not actual routes, between urban areas with a population of 10,000 or more that could constitute a national cycle network.  Following completion of the study, the Department tasked the National Roads Authority to conduct a feasibility study of the route from Dublin to Galway and onto Clifden. Side by side with the work of the National Roads Authority, it is a matter for local authorities to identify, design and deliver, as individual demonstration projects, off-road cycling trails in rural locations that can form part of the network.  My Department provided significant financial support for the completion of the Great Western Greenway in Mayo and the Carrigaline to Crosshaven route in Cork and has committed finance to the Fenit to Tralee route in Kerry and elements of the Great Southern Trail in Limerick.  My Department is aware of work carried out on a possible route in the Boyne Valley.  It is the case that the success of the Great Western Greenway has generated a desire among other local authorities to deliver such projects. I am keen, though bearing in mind current financial constraints and the forthcoming findings of the comprehensive expenditure review, to support off-road cycling projects as part of  a wide programme of action on cycling matters.
3987	SeanSherlock	Labour	14167.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Prelude	561	" I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this issue, which provides me with an opportunity to outline some of the ongoing developments in mathematics and science that are most pertinent to the matter she has put forward for debate.  Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics and science is of strategic importance to the State and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue in the House. As part of the Government's overall strategy to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics in schools, a number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years.  Deputy Murphy referred to the project maths initiative, the aim of which is to change how mathematics is taught and learned in post-primary schools.  Its purpose is to show how mathematics connects with real life problems and how skills developed in the subject can be used in other subjects, the workplace and at home.  It also aims to change attitudes to mathematics and encourage more students to take the subject at higher level in their examinations and study mathematics and mathematics related subjects in college. The Government is committed to the full roll-out of project maths, which is supported by industry, colleges and universities.  The roll-out of the programme is supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for all teachers of mathematics.  By the end of 2012, teachers will have been offered six workshops, and a range of supplementary evening courses and teaching resources has been made available.  A bonus points system for mathematics for third level entry has also been introduced on a trial basis. The Teaching Council, about which questions have been raised in certain quarters, is an independent body which operates at arm's length to the Department.  The council sets standards for teacher qualifications across the curriculum.  It was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 to promote the professional development of teachers and regulate standards in the profession. Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the council shall ""review the standards of education and training appropriate to a person entering a programme of teacher education and training"" and ""review the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching and shall advise the Minister"".  To be registered as a teacher of mathematics with the Teaching Council, a person is required to have a recognised teaching qualification and degree in which mathematics represents at least 30% of the course over at least three years and which qualifies him or her to teach the syllabus to the highest level.  As part of its ongoing remit, the Teaching Council is reviewing the registration criteria for teaching subjects on the post-primary curriculum, including mathematics and science, and will publish its decisions in this regard as soon as they are finalised.  The appointment and deployment of teachers is a matter for individual schools.  Schools have been directed by my Department, as far as practicable, to appoint only appropriately qualified and registered teachers. The Teaching Council recently carried out the survey of post-primary schools to which the Deputy referred to ascertain the qualifications of mathematics teachers.  I acknowledge the rate of response highlighted by the Deputy.  Preliminary results show 68% of teachers teaching mathematics in 258 schools are fully qualified to do so, 29% have undergone some studies in mathematics and only 2% do not have any third level qualifications or studies in mathematics.  The survey findings will help us obtain a clearer picture of what is happening in schools and allow us to plan to meet training needs.  The schools have until 26 September to respond. The Department is keen to arrive at a position in which all teachers of mathematics have a qualification in the subject.  It is making arrangements for the provision of a new training programme for mathematics teachers which will provide unqualified mathematics teachers with the opportunity to upskill their knowledge of the subject and study the strategies best suited to the new project maths syllabuses.  Tenders will be invited shortly."
3988	SeanSherlock	Labour	14167.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Prelude	563	 We can overcome the challenges facing us notwithstanding the recruitment embargo.  The national centre of excellence in the University of Limerick is doing a great deal of work in the area of continuing professional development to enable teachers to attain the required standard.  In addition, there are conversion courses that can be done.  In this way we can ensure we have a coterie of teachers with the right skill sets to help us to achieve our aims. The question of how we got to this point is one that would have to be teased out over a longer time period than the two minutes I have.  However, if we are open to the challenge, which we are, we must find out where we need to go. Deputy Murphy raised valid issues about fragmentation, with which I agree.  We must ensure there is standardisation across the board and that the Teaching Council and the individual boards of management are singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of what we need to achieve.  However, I am confident that the Project Maths initiative, in spite of whatever hiccups it may have along the way, will ensure we can help the students currently achieving E, F and NG grades to move up the scale.  I am less concerned about those currently achieving A, B and C grades.  The introduction of bonus points for maths will facilitate those students who choose not to do honours maths because it is time consuming.  They can devote more time to ordinary level maths and still get a reasonable number of points. There will be a tender process for training and continuing professional development.  We are engaging with industry and academia in this regard,  but there are challenges.  We will not turn the ship around within the next 12 months.  However, we are engaging with the issue in a deeper fashion than heretofore.  Based on the soundings I have taken outside of the usual advisory groups — I have delved into academia and sought the views of individual teachers — there is a sense that if we stay on track with Project Maths, we can tackle the qualitative and quantitative issues involved in getting grades up.

3993	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	234	 I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter.  My primary concern is with the workers facing uncertainty today.  Taking account of the domestic economy, Aviva has decided to review its operations to ensure its capacity is in line with domestic demand to ensure sustainability.  Industry figures show that general insurance has fallen by more than 20% in the past two years, while life insurance and pensions have fallen by more than 30%, due to concerns over long-term savings and people cancelling or reducing pension policies.  Aviva has stated it is committed fully to Ireland and is currently in discussions with unions representing staff about the review.  Until this review has been completed, it would be premature to speculate about the outcome.  To be fair, it is pertinent that the Government allows the unions to engage with Aviva to see where that process might go. As for the role of the IDA, the Deputy has greater knowledge than me in this regard and is well aware that it supports multinational companies predominantly trading outside Ireland or internationally.  As part of its business in working to attract international activities into Ireland from multinational companies, the IDA has been in contact with Aviva at both corporate and local levels.  The Minister has asked the IDA, given its knowledge of the company, to continue to work with it to mitigate any possible negative outcomes.  Consequently, the IDA has been active in this regard. Ireland has succeeded in building an international financial services industry that is diverse in the activities carried out and which enjoys a world-leading reputation in several sectors.  While the past three years have represented a severe stress test for all the financial centres, firms at the International Financial Services Centre have shown resilience and flexibility.  Employing 33,000 people directly and many more indirectly, the IFSC remains both critical as an employer and as a centre of economic activity.  The goal of ensuring that jobs and economic activity are protected is a mainstay for the Government and I ask that Members allow further review to take place and for the discussions to conclude with the unions representing the staff.  The Government undoubtedly will engage at a later point.

3995	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	238	 I acknowledge the Deputy's statement.  There is no sense of complacency on the part of the Government on this issue.  We must have regard to the fact the Cabinet has asked the IDA, given its knowledge of the company, to continue to work with it to mitigate any possible negative outcomes. Let us be frank.  I can dance around the language of redundancies and job losses but if a multinational company that transcends many boundaries has decided the course of action it will take, it is difficult for Governments to influence decisions.  Nobody wants job losses but sometimes decisions are made in other centres, financial powerhouses and capital cities other than Dublin. The key point is for us to engage with the company and try to move it from its current trajectory in terms of job losses.  We will do everything we can in that respect.  If the company makes a decision God or man will not shift it.  We should be honest and frank about the discourse.  We must try to ensure the same situation as TalkTalk does not arise and there is an early warning system that ensures we can engage with a company to try to stem the flow of job losses and learn valuable lessons to ensure the policy is tapered to have the right mix of companies. I will engage further with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The Deputy's comments are on the record of the House and I will relate them to the Minister and the IDA.
3996	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	309	 The Teaching Council recently carried out a survey of post-primary schools to ascertain the qualifications of maths teachers.  The results of the survey show that a significant majority of teachers — 68% — teaching maths in 258 schools are fully qualified to do so, that 29% have pursued some studies in maths and that only 2% have not obtained third level qualifications or pursued studies in maths.  The Teaching Council has asked schools which have not completed the earlier survey to do so by 26 September. Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics is of key strategic importance to the State.  As part of the Government's overall strategy to improve the teaching and learning of maths in schools, my Department is making arrangements for the provision of a new training programme for maths teachers.  This will provide unqualified maths teachers with the opportunity to upskill their knowledge of mathematics and study the strategies best suited to the new Project Maths syllabuses.
3997	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	311	 To give the Deputy a straight answer, I am not in a position to do this.  As he is well aware, the boards of management of schools have autonomy in respect of who they hire and fire.  There is an issue of governance in that regard.  I ask the Deputy to have faith in the process being undertaken.  We must obtain the results of the survey and analyse them.  As announced on 12 September, a programme that will allow for continuing education and continuing professional development, CPD, for unqualified maths teachers is to be rolled out.  The contract in this regard is due to go to tender shortly.  I would be cautious with regard to the Department exercising control over decisions made by individual schools.  Again, I ask the Deputy to have faith.  We will analyse the results of the survey and proceed cautiously.  There must be an outcome which ensures teachers are properly qualified and that students obtain good results in their examinations.  In that context, we must seek to ensure there is a deeper engagement in this matter.  We will not turn the ship around overnight; it is going to take some time to do this.
3998	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	316	 Is the Deputy referring to the teaching of maths?
3999	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	320	 I ask that the Deputy table a separate parliamentary question on that matter.  This question relates to the teaching of maths. With regard to Deputy Smith's question, there are no exact figures for the take-up of CPD.  However, I will endeavour to come back to him at a later date with additional information on the matter.  If he is asking whether I am satisfied with the rate of reply to the survey, the straight answer is that I am not.  The schools have until 26 September to provide responses to it.  I ask the Deputy to have some forbearance and allow us to assess the position at that point.  The Department and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, are extremely conscious of the fact that we must grapple with this issue.  We must do so on the basis that we will be provided with a true picture of the actual scenario.  In that context, the agencies and stakeholders involved have been given a clear signal to the effect that we require sound data.  We cannot make proper policy decisions unless such data which must be both qualitative and quantitative are forthcoming.  I hope the Deputy will accept my comments on this matter in good faith.
4000	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	346	 In relation to concerns regarding the teaching of mathematics, I expect to receive shortly full figures from a Teaching Council survey of the qualifications of mathematics teachers in second level schools. Initial indications from the schools which have responded, approximately one third, are that some 68% of maths teachers are fully qualified to do so, 29% have undergone some studies in maths and 2% have no third level qualifications/studies in maths. A tender to provide a post-graduate course to the last two groups is due to issue shortly. On the question of standards, I am not happy with the level of uptake at higher level mathematics.  Project Maths which was introduced in all schools in September 2010 aims, inter alia, to increase uptake at higher level.  I note that the uptake of higher level at junior certificate level was 52% among candidates who sat Project Maths in the Project school as opposed to 45.6% nationally.  This is a positive trend.
4001	SeanSherlock	Labour	14169.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-22 00:00:00	Prelude	349	 As the Deputy is aware, Project Maths is a major programme of reform in mathematics in second level schools, which is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics. Project Maths began in 24 project schools in September 2008.  Strands 1 and 2 began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at Leaving Certificate and 2013 at Junior Certificate. Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011, and strand 5 will start in 2012. In Leaving Certificate 2011 candidates in the Project schools had, at ordinary and higher levels, a higher proportion at A/B/C grades, and a lower proportion at E/F/NG.  Trends in relation to candidates who sat Project Maths at Junior Cycle in 2011 broadly mirror those of the Leaving Certificate Project Maths candidates. I am heartened to note a higher level take up rate of 52% among Project School candidates which compares favourably to the national rate of take up of 45.6% at Junior Certificate.

4011	SeanSherlock	Labour	14175.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	491	" I hope I can respond positively to all the ideas that were put forward.  I acknowledge the contribution by Members to the debate on the past two evenings.  Members have been generally constructive in their comments to date. I wish to put on record press releases from the IDA which outline certain examples of foreign direct investments made in the past two weeks.  On 26 September the headline read ""Twitter to establish international office in Ireland"".  On 22 September, the headline read ""MSD opens new €100m R&D centre in Tipperary"".  On 21 September the headline read ""arvato Finance marks 15 year anniversary with ambitious growth plans"".  On 20 September the headline read ""Pfizer invests €200m in its Grange Castle biotech site"".  On 20 September the headline read ""HCL Technologies establishes Software Delivery Centre in Dublin"".  On 16 September the headline read ""The Coca-Cola Company opens new manufacturing and innovation facility in Wexford.""  I only put those on the record because they are examples of success in attracting foreign direct investment. As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, we are currently engaged in a research prioritisation exercise.  The purpose of the exercise is to narrow down key elements of areas of research so we can continue to attract that kind of FDI in order that we can ensure we have a platform for the basic research and applied research and that the level of collaboration between industry and academia is deepened so we can ensure we can continue on that platform and to put us even higher up the global rankings in research and innovation.   No party or Government should claim for itself this evolutionary process which has been put in place since 1996 by various parties.  It is only successful because of the fact that we have organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Science Foundation Ireland and Forfás which have the level of expertise to pitch to a market and attract the type of companies we need."
4012	SeanSherlock	Labour	14175.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	493	 I apologise to Opposition Members because my time is limited and I would like to respond.  Since July, some 1,400 people have signed up to the jobs initiative and the national internship scheme.  It will not be a panacea but it is making incremental progress.  That is how the Government will proceed.  We will not have a great leap forward within the next thee or four months because we must still address a deficit issue which has been acknowledged by all sides of the House.  There will be differences over the manner in which we continue to address the deficit, but we still have that restraint in terms of our public finances which hampers one's ability to concentrate solely on stimulus.  It will be a mix of stimulus and retrenchment, which is the reality of the situation.  I will not blame past Governments but will rather look forward to our FDI and strong export sector. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, will soon be receiving the first draft report of the small business advisory group.  He announced today that county enterprise boards will get another €3.1 million.  These are all initiatives which locally and nationally will create the type of stimulus we need.

If I am to engage in a bit of rhetoric along with some of my counterparts in opposition, I would say that to govern is to choose.  That means we will have to make tough decisions in future, but at the same time we are trying to keep the basics right. I would like to address the habitats directive and farming, as Deputies have referred to them.  The ""Food Harvest 2020"" document has been bought into by all stakeholders involved in the rural economy, including the co-operative movement and farming organisations.  We will see tangible growth in that area, but the challenge is whether it will be jobless growth.  I acknowledge we must be cognisant of that also. Flooding was referred to and the Deputy mentioned his inability to get information on the habitats directive.  However, not one Deputy in the Technical Group has ever approached me as a Minister to ask for any kind of briefing on the area I represent, which is a foundation for the growth we are talking about.  Like other Ministers, my door is open to any Member of the House in order to engage with them constructively on any aspect.  Let us do away with the rhetoric that has filled the air for a long time."

4023	SeanSherlock	Labour	14182.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	421	 I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  As I reported to the House on the 22 September, Aviva is undertaking a review of its operations in response to a significant reduction in demand for insurance and pensions products.  Aviva has found it necessary to review its operations here to ensure its cost base is in line with domestic demand to ensure sustainability.  The CEO of Aviva Ireland has assured the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that no decisions have been taken on the final structures or potential job losses.  He has also confirmed that Aviva is committed to remaining a significant player in the Irish insurance and assurance market. As the CEO of Aviva has confirmed that the company is in ongoing contact with employee representatives, it would be premature to speculate about the outcome.  To be fair, it is pertinent that the Government allow the unions to engage with Aviva to see where that process might lead.  The company has given a commitment to communicate the results of the review to my Department and IDA Ireland when completed.  We anticipate that the review will be completed by the end of October.  In the interim, IDA Ireland is in contact with the company at both corporate and local level, with the intention of mitigating the impact of potential negative outcomes following the review.  IDA Ireland is also in dialogue with the company on potential future opportunities in respect of the company's significant international business.  In this context, recent media coverage does not reflect a formal announcement by the company.  The review of its operations is ongoing and the company has not officially confirmed the scale of potential job losses.  My Department, through IDA Ireland, is monitoring the situation closely and will engage further with the company at any stage.
4024	SeanSherlock	Labour	14182.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	423	 Let us be straight.  If a global company such as Aviva decides to restructure, it is pertinent, if there is engagement with the trade unions in the organisation, that we allow such a process to proceed.  I have stated IDA Ireland is in dialogue with the company on potential future opportunities.  I have also stated it is in contact with the company at both corporate and local level, with a view to mitigating the impact of potential negative outcomes.  I note the point made by the Deputy which I will pass on to IDA Ireland.  However, it is vital that we allow the review to take place.  The CEO has assured the Minister that no decisions have been taken on the final structure and potential job losses.  However, it is important that we take on board what the Deputy is saying and reflect the concerns outlined and the view that IDA Ireland raise the ante in advance of the review.  That is a fair point.

4028	SeanSherlock	Labour	14183.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	269	" I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" On a personal note, as this is the first legislation I have introduced as a Minister of State, I wish to say it is a privilege to be able to do so. The Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 is a short but very important Bill amending three sections of the Patents Act 1992, to allow for the eventual ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement.  I will set out the context in which I am bringing this Bill before the House today.  Patents are central to supporting innovative businesses in several ways.  Patents add economic value to inventions by giving them a monopoly right for a fixed term to enable the commercial exploitation of ideas in the market place.  However, in return for that monopoly the inventor must agree to have the details of the invention published.  The publication of patents enables research and encourages research, allows business in technical fields to stay abreast of the state of the art and encourages further innovation.  It also helps to create co-operative links between inventors, investors and manufacturers through patent licensing. Protecting intellectual property rights through patenting is important to Irish industry and business.  The Irish Patents Office provides for the granting of patents and registering of trademarks and industrial designs.  In 1964, a new Patents Act was passed to bring our legislation in line with that of the main industrial countries.  This reflected Ireland's outward looking focus for economic development through international commerce, which has continued to this day.  The main body of Irish patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1992 which now serves to meet our national needs and our international obligations. Over the past decade, it has become clear that Ireland's international competitiveness depends increasingly on goods and services, which have high knowledge content.  A recent report shows that enterprises across all business sectors spent almost €1.8 billion on research and development activities in 2010.  An effective patent system is the key to converting that investment into economic growth.  It is imperative that this knowledge is captured at the early stages, protected and exploited to its full potential.  Today, inventions can be protected in Europe either through national patent offices or through the European Patent Office located in Munich.  Irish and European companies marketing their products, strategically choose to apply for a European patent rather than a national patent to ensure larger geographical protection for their products. The European Patent Office, established by the European Patent Organisation, is an intergovernmental institution comprising 38 countries, the EU 27 along with 11 other European countries.  The functions of the office are to examine patent applications and grant a European patent if the relevant conditions are met.  It is worth noting that patent applications originating in Ireland to the European Patent Office have been increasing steadily, underlining the importance to industry of European patent protection.  Patent applications to the EPO have risen by 44% and grants of European patents to Irish applicants have increased by 21% since 2004. Unfortunately, the European patent process can be expensive and complex which can act as a disincentive, especially for small and medium-sized firms.  A company wishing to protect its invention across Europe applies to the European Patent Office for a patent.  Once a European patent is granted by the office the proprietor must designate the countries where he or she wants patent protection and then the patent must be validated in each member state.  At this stage the European patent effectively becomes a bundle of national patents. To validate a patent, a full translation of the patent must be lodged in each country designated, in the national language of that country.  These translation costs make up a very sizeable portion of the costs of acquiring a European patent and the costs must be borne by the applicant.  As a result, the European patent is uncompetitive when compared with the cost of obtaining US and Japanese patents. Let me put the matter in real terms.  A European patent validated in 13 European countries is about ten times more expensive than a US patent and 13 times more expensive than a Japanese patent when processing and translation costs are taken into account.  It has been estimated that validating a patent in 27 countries costs €32,000, of which €23,000 is for translations alone.  Anecdotal evidence suggests these translations into national languages are hardly ever consulted.  Only 1% of patents go down the litigation route and in the event that a court case ensues, the authentic text of the patent before the judge is always the patent text as granted by the European Patent Office.  Meanwhile, the national translations required all over Europe remain in the drawer.  Moreover, it usually takes four or five years to process and grant a patent in the European Patent Office.  Consequently, these translations do not serve the purpose of informing the public about state-of-the-art new technologies, as they are only required to be filed after the patent has been granted. There are other costs associated with the translation requirements such as filing and publication fees to local national offices.  Local patent agents often act as intermediaries between the patent proprietor and the national patent offices where the translations are to be filed.  These patent agents take on the role of ensuring formal requirements laid down by national law are complied with and the correct fees are paid.  Obviously, the patent agent has to be paid for providing this service and a recent study conducted by the European Commission concluded that these costs varied from around €150 to €600 per validation, depending on the member states involved.  If a patent is being validated in a number of countries, we can see how these costs can mount up.  They particularly affect small and medium-sized enterprises, young innovative companies, start-up companies and public research universities. Research shows that Irish industry, as elsewhere, often takes a selective cost effective approach when designating states for patent protection, thus leaving the patent vulnerable in those states not designated.  In order to reduce these costs, an intergovernmental conference held in London in 2000 adopted the London Agreement.   This agreement, which entered into force in May 2008, set out to reduce the cost to applicants by easing the requirement to file translations of granted patents under the European Patent Convention in those countries that signed up to the agreement.  The overall aim of the agreement is to reduce the cost of translations across the 38 member states by 50%.  In order to reach this level of reduction, it is vital that all member states of the European Patent Convention become a party to the agreement. Article 65 of the European Patent Convention provides that any contracting state may require a translation of the text of a European patent into one of its languages, if that language is different from the language in which the patent is granted.  Under the London Agreement, the parties to the agreement undertake to waive, entirely or largely, the requirement for translations of European patents to be filed in their national language.  In effect, under the agreement, states with English, French or German as an official language will dispense with translation requirements entirely for the patent to come into effect. Having English as an official language, Ireland would have to dispense with the requirement to seek a translation into English of the detailed specification of European patents drawn up in French or German.  However, it is important to note that the claims which are the core part of the patent that defines the limit of the monopoly would continue to be available in English after granting.  Section 119(6) of the Patents Act 1992 requires that a European patent designating Ireland and drawn up in either French or German must have its specification translated into English for that patent to be validated in Ireland.  It is necessary to delete section 119(6) and corresponding subsections where reference to these translations is made in order to give full effect in our legislation to the London Agreement. In order to assess the implications for Irish inventors and business, my Department carried out a regulatory impact assessment of the London Agreement in 2009.  It concluded that the main advantage of the agreement for Irish inventors seeking patent protection abroad was that they would no longer be required to furnish translations to the extent currently required in those countries which became a party to the agreement.  This would lead to significant savings when filing in other non-English language European states.  Translation costs, publication fees and patent attorney fees would be reduced, with the greatest saving on translation costs.  For example in 2007, there were 126 European patents granted originating from Ireland.  Twenty-eight states were designated and the total cost of translations to protect the patents was estimated at €6 million, a significant cost to industry.  This figure does not include the filing and publication fees to the national offices or patent attorney's fees. The London Agreement is an optional agreement and to date 16 countries have signed it.  However, our accession to the agreement should encourage other member states to accede, thereby reducing further the cost for Irish inventors when filing in other non-English language European states.  The more members involved, the greater the benefit to European business. I see the Bill as just the first step in reducing the burden of costs involved in protecting patents internationally.  On the European Union front, we are working with other member states towards the creation of unitary patent protection that will have the effect of reducing the costs of registration and enforcement of patents for businesses.  The Commission's proposal for a single EU patent has been under discussion for over 50 years and we are finally seeing some progress.  At the EU Competitiveness Council in March of this year the Council authorised the use of the enhanced co-operation procedure for the creation of unitary patent protection in those member states that wished to join.  Ireland is one of 25 member states which are forging ahead to achieve a simpler, cheaper and more robust patent system in the European Union that has eluded us of decades.  This measure, when fully implemented, will enable Irish-based holders of patents to seek protection for their patent across the 25 member states supporting the unitary patent protection — representing 79% of the territory of the European Union — for a fraction of current costs.  The Commission estimates that by implementing unitary patent protection, the overall savings to European business could reach €50 million per year, even in the early stages.  These cost reductions should particularly benefit Irish start-up firms and small businesses.  When fully implemented, this measure will facilitate a big reduction in costs and red tape which will provide a stimulus for European innovation and make patents more accessible to all companies in the European Union. Enacting the Bill, combined with our accession to the London Agreement, will remove the current expensive translation requirements which is likely to lead to Ireland being designated in more patent applications and to more patent-related activity in Ireland.  It is expected that more inventors and small and medium-sized enterprises, currently deterred from registering patents because of the high costs involved, will be attracted to protecting their intellectual property across Europe.  This will further support Ireland's efforts to generate economic growth through promoting and innovating better processes and products.  I commend the Bill to the House."
4029	SeanSherlock	Labour	14183.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	288	" I thank all of the Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  Some have been pertinent to the legislation before us, others arguably not so.  I will seek to address the points that were raised in regard to the legislation itself.  As an aside, there is only one Deputy Finian McGrath and one could not patent him if one tried. I will start with the points raised about the UK patent box regime and the royalty exemptions and other reliefs that were suggested by Deputy Eoghan Murphy and also the points raised by Deputy Donohoe.  That is being considered at present under the budgetary process.  I note the points, which were well made, and we should hear more about it anon.  We are talking about innovation, utilising human capital and allowing for where someone who is creative and has an idea that becomes the subject of a patent to have as easy as possible a transition of that idea to commercialisation.  The London agreement would facilitate that process through the translation arrangements.  That is really what we are talking about in this context. The proposed change in the legislation would result in a modest loss of revenue to the Patents Office in terms of fees for translations.  In the context of this country becoming a party to the agreement, an applicant must lodge a translation in the office within six months of grant of the patent together with a fee of €35.  In 2010 that came to €33,215.  The level of renewal fees is likely to increase if we accede to the agreement and it is likely that owing to the lack of translation requirements, this country will be designated in more patent applications to the European Patents Office, EPO. On Deputy Clare Daly's point on the protection system, the unitary patent protection system will address the excessive costs in Europe.  That is without question. The feasibility of the international content clearing centre, which was raised by Deputy Donohoe, is currently under examination by a group from my Department which includes Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  There is a process under way in respect of that project. Deputy Eoghan Murphy raised points on the physical manifestation of the patented invention.  It could be argued that the direction patent applications are taking worldwide is that of an electronic on-line application, but I would like to hear more from Deputy Murphy on this one, perhaps at a later stage and even on Committee Stage.  We can address this further if necessary in a more substantive sense.  The question of tax relief on patent royalties is currently under review in advance of the next budget, and that should address Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's point on the UK regime. There were many other points raised.  Deputy O'Dea asked when the EU patent will come into effect and about the current position.  The concept of the EU patent, previously Community patent, is to provide a patent system that will be affordable, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and will provide automatic patent coverage in all member states of the European Union.  As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, as protracted negotiations over many years failed to reach agreement on the EU patent, the Commission has requested to examine the possibility of bringing a proposal under enhanced co-operation whereby unitary patent protection applying to these member states willing to participate will be introduced.  So far, 25 out of the 27 member states of the EU have indicated a willingness to take part and the Commission envisages that the first unitary patent protection will issue in 2013.  As is the case normally with any European initiative, I would not be held to that timeframe. I thank the Members for their contribution to the debate.  In my introductory speech, I set out the rationale for the proposed Patent (Amendment) Bill 2011 and outlined the financial burden on industry in providing the full translation of the European patent to ensure full protection of the patent across Europe.  I also stated that these translations are rarely consulted and, as such, offer little or no advantage, either to the patent holder or users of the system.  It is imperative, both from an Irish and European perspective, that business is not hampered by a system that is inefficient and costly.  Access to a cost-effective and efficient patent system is key to stimulating innovation.  Under the current regime, the high cost of translating granted patents acts as a deterrent to business and as a consequence, is a deterrent to innovation.  Currently, more than 50% of all enterprises in Ireland continue to engage in considerable research and development activities in spite of the difficult economic environment.  It is vital that their innovation is captured and exploited in the best way possible.  A patent system in which users have limited access due to high translation costs does not serve this purpose and the cost savings from the London agreement should have a positive effect on research and development, allowing for resources saved on translations to be reallocated to further research and development and other business activities.  That is the kernel of this legislation. I hope Deputy Clare Daly, who spoke about taxation of corporates, gets the point of this legislation.  It is about being able to facilitate those who are innovators, those who are Irish who want to get out into other markets and who have ideas.  We facilitate that process by implementing the London Agreement so that we can make that passage as easy as possible for young people, for researchers and for industry. I hope this does not sound patronising.  I suggest that every Member of this House, if they have an opportunity to do so, should engage with Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and all of our academic institutions to delve into, and inform themselves of, the interaction between research, intellectual property copyright and the innovation and commercialisation taking place.  I have undergone such an education process.  Every day one learns more about this field.  Before Members come into the House and make sweeping statements about taxation of innovation, they should be well informed about the process.  I say that respectfully and in a debating manner in the spirit in which we debate these issues in the House.  It is not meant as a personal statement to any one person in particular.  We should be careful about the language we use in implementing legislation.  This is technical legislation.  That is all it is.  It is to the common good.  There is some contention that it may not be, but I argue forcefully that it is to the common good ultimately and it will be beneficial to this country. The more countries that sign up to the agreement, the greater the saving will be across Europe.  In essence, by even one country joining up, the savings are significant.  It has been estimated that since the entry into force of the London Agreement in 2008, on average savings of 38% on translation costs have been achieved.   The results speak for themselves.  That is what we are trying to achieve here today. On some other points raised, the Patents Office runs business seminars across the country aimed at SMEs, start-ups and entrepreneurs, and these seminars are entitled, ""Building a Business on Your Ideas"".  That is a pertinent point.  It speaks to the issue of innovation and how ordinary people can become involved in the process if they have ideas, and there is an excellent programme, through the Patents Office, that seeks to achieve that.  The seminars include talks on all elements of intellectual property, IP, how to identify IP within a business and how to protect it.  They also provide talks on State supports to industry and they are extremely useful. On Deputy Clare Daly's points, the number of patent applications, originating in Ireland, to the European Patent Office was 510 in 2010, a slight increase from 498 in 2009.  The latest figures for patent filings in 2010 ranked Ireland 14th of the 38 countries in the European patents organisation and we ranked 23rd in the Patent Cooperation Treaty international rankings which cover most countries worldwide. However, it is important to make the point that the number of national patent applications is not an indicator of patent activity in Ireland.  In Ireland, many of the multinational companies, which employ thousands and which undertake and fund major research and development here, patent their products on a global level.  Patent applications submitted by large multinational organisations in the United States, for example, would not show Ireland as the source of the application or that the research and development has been carried out in Ireland.  It is important to make that point to rebut some of what has been said by Deputy Clare Daly.  There are Irish people working in multinational corporations here, or working within academic institutions that interface with those same corporations, who are producing excellent work, ground-breaking world-class research based on Irish intellectual property which will not necessarily be registered as Irish, but it is still Irish people producing the intellectual property and that is the most important point.  It forms the basis, and underpins, thousands of jobs within this economy.  It is important to send out a more positive message in terms of what this legislation is about."

4035	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	296	 The programme for Government sets out clearly that Ireland's economic recovery must be export-led and commits us to achieving the maximum growth in exports.  Enterprise Ireland will spearhead this work. A potential exporters' unit is currently being operationalised in Enterprise Ireland.  It will offer a new service delivery and model of engagement for new and existing client companies.  Along with the provision of business-related toolkits, including export toolkits which will be delivered in part on-line, the division will provide tailored export capability building workshops, modules and programmes for companies entering new markets as well as access to mentors.  A new series of guides to markets is also being introduced with a focus on practical information aimed at new exporters.  This will be available even to companies who do not meet Enterprise Ireland's normal employment test of having at least ten employees.  The intention is to widen the range of companies which can graduate to other established programmes focused on exporting opportunities. Such programmes are tailored to a company's stage of export development.  They include the international selling programme and the excel at export selling workshop series as well as first flight workshops and mentor services.  As well as training programmes, Enterprise Ireland helps companies retain the services of industry experts to support market expansion and development.  The going global fund also supports established but domestically-focussed companies to explore opportunities on the international market.  Through its client knowledge services offer, Enterprise Ireland allows client companies and potential exporters access to a comprehensive library of sector and market intelligence and information on doing business overseas.  Enterprise Ireland has also developed detailed third-party legal and tax contacts in priority markets which can be accessed by new exporters, as well as organising and engaging business networks in all markets wherever possible.  It recently launched the second call of its very successful graduates 4 international growth programme.
4036	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	298	 Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated high growth markets unit in Dublin to provide further assistance to client companies doing business in a range of countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Trade missions support this work.  Under the programme for Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has taken particular responsibility for trade promotion.  This means the diplomatic service is fully engaged in promoting trade and plans have been developed for each of Ireland's target markets.  The Tánaiste chairs the new export council which brings together the focus of this work. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is engaged in developing trading opportunities in emerging economies through the negotiation of free-trade agreements between the EU and third countries and improved opportunities for exporters can also emerge from reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers through trade and regulatory discussions between the EU and China, Russia and Brazil. To answer the question, it is an ongoing process and one must speak to the figures.  Between 2004 and 2010, merchandise exports from Ireland to Brazil, Russia, India and China rose by approximately 122% and in the same period services exports to those countries rose by688%.  Another key example of this success is the fact that Ireland now has a significant trade surplus with China, which is a dramatic turnaround from the position only four years previously when we had a deficit of approximately €2.9 billion.
4037	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	300	 I understand that for the year to date exports have increased by approximately 6%——
4038	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	302	 The overall year to date figures show an increase from last year and exports from indigenous industries have increased by approximately 10%.  The omens are good on the export side.  The creation of the export trade council, which arises from the trade, tourism and investment strategy, signals a clear intention by the Government, as per the programme for Government, to drive exports even further in the countries I mentioned earlier.  The new council's membership includes the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and senior representatives from the relevant agencies and Departments.  This derives from a previous policy which was borne out of common sense and will continue.  There is greater emphasis, and the figures bear this out, to drive exports in the so-called BRIC countries.
4039	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	321	 On 29 September last, the establishment of NewERA was announced by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister of State Fergus O'Dowd, who has special responsibility for NewERA.  The Government took the decision to establish NewERA to reform the manner in which Government manages its shareholding in the semi-State companies.  It is one of the key commitments in the programme for Government and is central to our plans for investment. NewERA will initially be established on a non-statutory basis as a shareholder executive within the NTMA.  It will have responsibility for reviewing capital investment plans of the commercial semi-State companies from a shareholder perspective and will identify possible synergies between investment programmes of different State companies.  The companies in question are the ESB, Bord Gáis, EirGrid, Bord na Móna and Coillte. The decision to establish NewERA is an important element in the Government's strategy to create jobs and promote economic growth.  The operation of NewERA will be overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure, of which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is a member. The Government is doing everything it can to create jobs and improve Irish infrastructure.  Part of this is to ensure that critical infrastructure is put in place to allow enterprise to grow now and in the future and take advantage of the opportunities which arise in traditional and emerging sectors.
4040	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	323	 The fact that Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA is incidental in terms of this being a whole Government approach to the issue.  We should not underestimate the fact that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is on the Cabinet sub-committee.  There is a corporate view at Government level between the two parties of Government of the need to ensure we have an entity that will carry out a corporate governance function from a shareholder perspective and that will report to the relevant Ministers and be overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure.  The bottom line is that it is a whole of Government approach.  Through NewERA, the Government is taking control of the infrastructure as per the semi-State companies involved. Regarding the second part of the question on the jobs target, the key emphasis is to ensure we get it up and running.  We must get the key strategic infrastructure fund in place through the NPRF and we must become more efficient in terms of how we run these companies.  Infrastructure is the key at this point.
4041	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	325	 There is a commitment in line with obligations to the troika in respect of non-strategic State assets.  Deputy O'Dea is aware of why we are in that position.  The key issue is that, following the appropriate legislative changes, resources will be channelled from the NPRF to productive investment.  We are talking about productive investment in the Irish economy.  I realise there may not be a specific target of a number of jobs.  Although one of the parties in government set out a specific target as part of its manifesto, there is a programme for Government and a clear convergence in terms of what both parties are trying to achieve.  We must be mindful of targets and ensure we have an efficient organisation in NewERA to manage infrastructure and investment in partnership with the NPRF, using the strategic infrastructure fund, which will be the forerunner to the strategic infrastructure bank.
4042	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	327	 Discussions with the troika are ongoing this week in respect of the issue.  We are ensuring that we can leverage State assets to create jobs.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has a political philosophical view on selling State assets that must be respected but there is a process of engagement with the troika in which commitments are given by this Government, which is sovereign.  We are not going to disavow those commitments but, as a Government, we are in the business of seeking to ensure we can get out of this economic morass.  The sale of State assets is one mechanism by which we can do this.  We want to create an efficient tool called NewERA so we can ensure that we can leverage the assets to create jobs.  I cannot give an exact answer of pounds, shillings and pence for the number of jobs we can create.
4043	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	329	 The assets will be used in a way that seeks to leverage them to create jobs and we have not maximised the potential of those State assets heretofore.
4044	SeanSherlock	Labour	14189.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	341	" My Department recently carried out a public consultation in regard to this matter.  The consultation document set out the background to the matter arising from the judgment issued by Mr. Justice Charleton in the High Court in the case of EMI Records (Ireland) Limited and others v. UPC Communications Ireland Limited.  It indicated that it had been considered heretofore that injunctions, as required under Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, known as the copyright or info soc directive, were already available in Irish law under subsection 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. However, in the judgment referred to, Mr. Justice Charleton held that he was constrained by the wording of the 2000 Act and could not grant an injunction, as sought, in regard to infringement of copyright against an information service provider in the circumstances of ""mere conduit"", as set out in the EU e-commerce directive, 2000/31/EC.  Accordingly, and for the avoidance of doubt, the consultation document indicated that it was considered necessary to restate Ireland's compliance with the directives concerned.  In proposing to do so, it was pointed out that the Department was particularly conscious of the importance of online content and digital businesses in the Irish context and that, accordingly, it was simply seeking to ensure Ireland's continued compliance with its obligations under the relevant EU directives, following the decision of the High Court in the aforementioned UPC case. Additional information not given on the floor of the House The consultation document also contained the text of a proposal to amend the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, by means of a statutory instrument under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, which had been drawn up after careful consideration and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Arising from the public consultation, more than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  Several of these submissions contained legal argument in regard to the issue, including, in at least one case, advice of senior counsel, as well as detailed comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments are being considered by my Department in conjunction with its legal adviser and the Attorney General's office."

There is more work to be done between my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Given that I have been in office only since March, I reserve the right to take more time on this issue.  I do not accept the argument that there are jobs at stake.  It is an issue on which there is an interaction between rights holders, the ""mere conduits"" — that is, the Internet service providers, ISPs — and the end users, of whom there are millions.  We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct.

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) represents my Department at these discussions and I am informed that the proposals relate only to vehicle standards, not to the vehicle's use or the driver, and specify the standards to be applied to new motorcycles. The proposals present a legal framework for the type approval and increased market surveillance of mopeds, motorcycles and quads, which will replace and simplify the existing Framework Directive 2002/24/EC. Contrary to suggestions that have been made by various parties, the proposed Regulations do not include provisions for mandatory wearing of high visibility clothing by motorcyclists, banning older motorcycles from urban areas or changes to driver licensing. The proposed Regulations are designed to improve the safety of those who belong to a vulnerable road user group and who account, proportionately, for the highest fatality and injury rates among all road users. The main elements of the proposed Regulations relate to mandatory anti-lock braking system, prevention of tampering with the powertrain and automatic use of headlamp on. The Regulations are also designed to reduce vehicle emissions for these types of vehicles, which, statistics show, currently are not reducing in line with other road vehicles such as cars, buses and goods vehicles. The Road Safety Authority has recently published an information note on the proposals on their website, and they are inviting feedback from stakeholders and the general public before 29th October, 2011.  The RSA's Motorcycle Safety Action Plan has an action for the compulsory wearing of high visibility vests by 2014. This initiative is based upon research into road traffic collisions involving motorcyclists. Observation studies conducted by the Road Safety Authority have in the past reported already high visibility clothing wearing rates of approximately 40% by motorcyclists in Ireland and it may be higher now. The RSA are carrying out a follow up study which is due to commence this month. The RSA will have analysed the data and will release the findings by the end of the year. In the event that there are high wearing rates by 2014, the Road Safety Authority  will then re-evaluate the need for compulsory wearing of high-visibility vests. However if  there is a need to make a high visibility vest compulsory, the Road Safety Authority  will not make a decision on the type of high visibility vests without consulting with motorcyclists and the industry.  It is the intention of the RSA to encourage the use of high visibility vests by offering them free of charge to motorcyclists.

The proposed Regulations are designed to improve the safety of those who belong to a vulnerable road user group and who account, proportionately, for the highest fatality and injury rates among all road users. The main elements of the proposed Regulations relate to mandatory anti-lock braking system, prevention of tampering with the powertrain and automatic use of headlamp on. The Regulations are also designed to reduce vehicle emissions for these types of vehicles, which, statistics show, currently are not reducing in line with other road vehicles such as cars, buses and goods vehicles. The Road Safety Authority has recently published an information note on the proposals on their website, and they are inviting feedback from stakeholders and the general public before 29th October, 2011.  The RSA's Motorcycle Safety Action Plan has an action for the compulsory wearing of high visibility vests by 2014. This initiative is based upon research into road traffic collisions involving motorcyclists. Observation studies conducted by the Road Safety Authority have in the past reported already high visibility clothing wearing rates of approximately 40% by motorcyclists in Ireland and it may be higher now. The RSA are carrying out a follow up study which is due to commence this month. The RSA will have analysed the data and will release the findings by the end of the year. In the event that there are high wearing rates by 2014, the Road Safety Authority  will then re-evaluate the need for compulsory wearing of high-visibility vests. However if  there is a need to make a high visibility vest compulsory, the Road Safety Authority  will not make a decision on the type of high visibility vests without consulting with motorcyclists and the industry.  It is the intention of the RSA to encourage the use of high visibility vests by offering them free of charge to motorcyclists.

4079	SeanSherlock	Labour	14224.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2011-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together. The key recommendations in the report, including bonus points for higher level mathematics, professional development for teachers and the roll-out of Project Maths, are being progressed.  Bonus points will be implemented from 2012.  Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 project schools which started the programme in 2008.  This is being supported by extensive investment in professional development for teachers which began in 2009 and which will continue until 2013 at least.  As part of this, intensive postgraduate courses will be developed aimed at teachers who do not hold a major qualification in mathematics.  A Project Maths implementation support group, an industry and education partnership, reported in 2010 on how stakeholders from business, second level and higher education can work together to achieve the objectives of Project Maths.  The recommendations of this report are being progressed.  My Department has also published the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is designed to promote a significant improvement in mathematical skills throughout primary and second level schools.
4080	SeanSherlock	Labour	14224.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	420	 One of the main recommendations related to bonus points.  From next year there will be 25 bonus points for mathematics.  There will also be a system of continuing professional development of teachers at primary and secondary level in the teaching of mathematics, including a professional masters degree and a part-time higher education diploma in mathematical education.  Consideration has been given to a four-year honours degree in mathematical education and, in addition, a tender for a postgraduate programme in mathematics will be finalised shortly, aimed at teachers who need extra support. A report was produced by National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSDL, a function of the University of Limerick.  It has carried out a good deal of work in this area and it is to be commended on the report completed under the tutelage of Dr. John O'Donoghue on the out-of-field teaching in post-primary education.  Project Maths is dealing with this in terms of continuing professional development.  The incentive of the 25 bonus points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, is being introduced in 2012 and it should have a positive bearing.  The fact that there will be continuous benchmarking and evaluation against the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results will be a true testament of whether we are getting results. There has been significant buy-in by teachers, parents and schools and the new junior cycle curriculum will feed in to greater outputs because the short courses devised as part of that will give students a greater chance to interact with industry.  For example, areas such as software programming, the pharmaceutical area and a host of other possibilities will engage their brains more laterally with mathematics and problem solving.  We must ensure that there is a good coterie of people who can think critically and laterally and who can solve problems in a more effectual way, the end result being better outcomes.  This is not to criticise the existing structures in place but we must continue to evolve mathematics learning in this country.

4087	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	42	 On 30 June, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced the establishment of a cross-Government implementation group on cloud computing.  This group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, comprises representatives of Departments and agencies responsible for all aspects of cloud computing policy, IT procurement, security, infrastructure and enterprise policy.  The group last met on 28 September.  In addition, the group's work was complemented by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in 23 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies being facilitated by my Department. In conducting its work, the group examined the opportunities and challenges presented by cloud computing for business and government from the following perspectives: the cloud as a source for exports, growth and jobs;  the adequacy of key infrastructures; the regulatory environment; the opportunities and benefits for indigenous enterprises; the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment; and Government as a leader and user of the cloud. The Secretary General of the Department, upon his recent retirement, submitted a draft interim report to the Minister.  This report is currently being reviewed by the group and it is intended that the group will meet shortly for the purpose of agreeing the content of the report and an action plan to implement its recommendations.  The group's final report is expected before the end of this year. Ireland is extremely well placed to take advantage of the rapidly growing international potential of cloud computing.  A recent report commissioned by Microsoft has estimated that, by 2014, the cloud computing industry in Ireland could be worth €9.5 billion and employ between 8,500 and 9,000 people.  Now, more than ever, we must do everything we can to seize opportunities like this.  These jobs will be created automatically, and the Government must act decisively and urgently if we are to position Ireland as a world leader in this high-growth sector.  The commitment in the programme for Government on cloud computing sets out the Government's intentions in this important area of the ICT industry.
4088	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	44	 Our job is to engage with the centre for management and organisation development, CMOD.  The Government acknowledges the possibilities of this.  One could say work is ongoing on making the ICT infrastructure more user friendly.  There will be challenges, potentially in regard to industrial relations peace, but I believe strongly that through proper engagement with all the stakeholders across government and by taking a more horizontal approach as opposed to the more siloed approach we are used to, we can achieve something and become global leaders in adopting early new technologies such as that associated with cloud computing.
4089	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	46	 I did not quite get the last point.
4090	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	48	 I am not aware of such problems.  I say that openly and honestly.  Research is ongoing and the centre is in the process of developing a cloud computing strategy for the public service, which it intends to bring to the Government for consideration and approval in the first quarter of 2012.  If a specific issue arises, I would love to hear the Deputy's thoughts.
4091	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	51	 I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy.  If he is willing to show me the source of the statistics he cited, I will revert to him on the matter.
4092	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	53	 EMC, the Irish Internet Association, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Dell and A&L Goodbody are all engaged in this process.  It is a worthwhile process because if we can become global leaders by dint of being early adopters we will have a competitive advantage.  I recognise that problems arise in broadband provision but the capacity is present in terms of cloud.  If the Deputy engages further with the Department, we can send him some facts on the issue.
4093	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	 On job creation, this Department must deal with the reality of the capital funding available to it.  On 10 November the Government published its infrastructural and capital investment medium-term Exchequer framework for the period 2012 to 2016.  Overall, capital investment totalling €17 billion has been allocated across Departments.  In one way or another, all of this €17 billion ultimately has a focus on job creation.  The Government's role is to create the conditions within which it will maximise the impact of this capital allocation and support the private sector in the creation of jobs.  Within the medium-term framework the State's support to enterprise and innovation has been protected and prioritised and clear targets for job creation have been set.  When averaged over the lifetime of the framework, the job creation targets for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are set to approximately 22,659 per annum. The capital allocation for programmes funded by the Department is to be increased in 2012 to €514 million, an increase of €6 million on the 2011 allocation, and supports to industry will be maintained in excess of pre-recession levels when total capital expenditure was at its highest.  This represents a strong commitment in this Department to the development of enterprise and provides the development agencies with sufficient resources to target aggressively the projects and investments that will drive economic renewal.  In setting out this level of capital investment in the productive economy the Government has been cognisant of issues, including maximising the achievement of value for money and the sustainability of job creation measures. While the notion of spending an additional €3.1 billion per annum on job creation might sound attractive, what the economy needs is structural change.  The Government must ensure the enterprise development supports and agencies are fit for purpose and well positioned to help Ireland to move out of the current downturn by creating sustainable jobs and continuing to grow exports in traditional key markets, as well as targeting high growth markets such as the BRIC countries for both exports and inward investment.  The Government has made inroads in bringing about these changes, as well as restoring confidence across enterprise, investors and consumers.  For example, work is advanced within the Department on determining the extent of the restructuring of the county enterprise boards; IDA Ireland has restructured in order that more of its staff are in client-facing jobs, while Enterprise Ireland has made operational a new potential exporters division which will target companies with export potential.  These are just a few examples of the changes being brought about.
4094	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	 I take the Deputy's point which is made in good faith.  However, in respect of the Government's capital allocation, there has been a 4% increase in Enterprise Ireland's capital budget for 2012.  I will rush through the figures because I am conscious of the time constraints, but there has been a 10% increase in the number of high potential start-up companies, a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships and expenditure of €18 million on the innovation fund.  The key point is that the Government is trying to set down the foundations or the bedrock on which one can sustain jobs over a longer period.  If one considers Sinn Féin's proposals for capital expenditure, they entail borrowing something like €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  It is talking out of both sides of its mouth in this regard — there is a bit of the Tadhg an dá thaobh about it — because, on the one hand, it states it would not pay back moneys to the European institutions from which Ireland has borrowed money while, on the other, it would have no problem in borrowing approximately €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  This does not stack up.
4095	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	92	 The Government is trying to create long-term sustainable jobs, but the Deputy is talking about short-term projects based on capital expenditure.  This does not stack up.
4096	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	 In fairness to the pensioners who were outside the gates of Leinster House today, if I interpreted the vox pop correctly, the strong message also extended to the amount of money being taken in administration fees.
4097	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	97	 I respectfully ask the Deputy to allow me to answer the question.  The pensioners were as adamant in their opposition to that aspect.  Let us take another look and look at the issue from the perspective of the communication passed between Departments.  However, with all due respect, as the question tabled by the Deputy pertains to capital expenditure of €3.1 billion, he will forgive me if I do not have an exact answer for him on the issue of the pension fund mentioned.
4098	SeanSherlock	Labour	14230.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	622	 The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of over €50 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved. Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme. The latest available data in relation to participation by enterprise in FP7, from 2007 to April, 2011, illustrates the number of participations (applications), number of successful applications, number of specific companies and funding to those companies. In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to April this year, 171 companies based in Ireland have had projects approved for funding under the programme. A number of companies are involved in more than one project and the total number of projects approved involving Irish companies in that period is 262. The total amount of funding to Irish based companies in these projects is €74.8 million. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for €55.5 million i.e. 74% of funding to Private Industry with 206 out of the 262 participations in projects. 22 Multinational companies (MNCs) based in Ireland have been approved funding and are involved in 56 approved projects. Ireland's overall success rate in FP7 of 23% (percentage of successful Irish applications including industry and academic) remains above the European Member State average of 22.21%.  The funding secured by Irish applicants at 21% (funding secured as percentage of funding requested) is also above the EU average of 20.68%.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of the prospects for Irish participation in FP7 and are broadly in line with our national targets. With regard to the number of projects pending and prospects for a major breakthrough, it is not possible to provide details at this stage.  All major FP7 Calls for 2012 opened in July, 2011 and will close sequentially from September, 2011 to March, 2012.  The next information available from the European Commission with regard to these Calls will be in April, 2012.  There will be one more series of Calls in respect of 2013, before the end of FP7, which is due to conclude at the end of 2013. The Commission gives special consideration to the funding of SMEs within FP7, setting a target of at least 15% of the available funding.  Ireland's SME participation remains in line with this target. Indeed, Ireland has the highest SME participation degree of the EU 27 Member States, with 104 per 100,000 SMEs participating in FP7 Themes. EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013. It includes the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme which aims to improve the conditions for innovation, such as exchanges of best practices between Member States and actions to improve, encourage and promote innovation in enterprises. It also includes the ICT Policy Support Programme which aims to stimulate the new converging markets for electronic networks and services, media content and digital technologies. The CIP is administered through the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry.

4111	SeanSherlock	Labour	14231.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	342	 Like many in the international community, the Government has been closely following events in Egypt in recent days in the run-up to historic parliamentary elections which are due to get under way on 28 November.  We all recall the events last February in Tahrir Square which proved so inspiring, when the discredited government of former President Hosni Mubarak was swept away in an impressive demonstration of people power.  In the intervening nine months, Ireland and its EU partners have been monitoring closely the transition to democratic rule in Egypt.  We have been offering all possible political support and responded positively to requests for practical assistance.  It is recognised that, as in other countries undergoing democratic transformation in the region, the uprising in Egypt that ended President Mubarak's rule was a genuinely popular one, drawing support from all sectors of society, and that it is for Egypt itself to determine the pace of its own transition and how the international community can best assist. It needs to be recognised that profound and historic changes have taken place in Egypt during the past nine months.  The country is on the verge of holding its first genuinely free elections in many years.  Political parties have been openly campaigning, many of which, including those linked with the Muslim Brotherhood, would only have encountered repression previously.  The former President and his close associates have been publicly put on trial for their crimes, an event to behold for ordinary Egyptians when they consider how impregnable the rule of President Mubarak appeared just one short year ago. Despite this, concern has been growing in recent months at the overall slow pace of the transition in Egypt and the degree of real change and reform taking place.  Despite repeated requests from the European Union and others, the ruling Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has refused to lift the long-standing state of emergency.  As a hard hitting Amnesty International report has highlighted in recent days, we have continued to see large-scale trials of civilians in military courts, as well as many credible reports of arbitrary detention and torture. Also of considerable concern has been the growth in sectarian tension.  This had its most recent manifestation last month, when more than 20 people, mostly Coptic Christians, were killed after coming under attack from elements linked with Egyptian security forces.  The military authorities have undertaken to investigate these deaths fully and also promised legislation to address well founded Coptic grievances.  As with other aspects of the change agenda in Egypt, the pace of reform has been slow and hesitant. Most recently, the prospect of military rule continuing until well into 2013 has caused renewed apprehension among many ordinary Egyptians, as well as Egypt's international partners.  That this and other failures to realise the full promise of change have given way to renewed violence and deaths is regrettable.  The Government joins others in the international community such as High Representative Ashton and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in expressing our deep concern about and condemnation of the violence in Tahrir Square and other parts of Egypt that is now estimated to have claimed at least 33 lives. The need for restraint, an avoidance of all violence and renewed dialogue on all sides is obvious.  There is no doubt that excessive force has been used by the Egyptian police and security forces in responding to what are peaceful demonstrations in Tahrir Square and other Egyptian cities.  The clear impetus behind all the renewed violence and tensions of recent days is the failure to respect fully the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people.  High Representative Ashton has warned that the demands of ordinary Egyptians and their political parties for a progressively unfolding transition that will safeguard the principles of democracy must be listened to. The head of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces in Egypt, Field Marshal Tantawi, has undertaken to advance the date for the presidential election to next July.  He has also held out the prospect of a referendum on the military continuing to play a political role in Egypt.  A new government is also likely to be formed.  This is a step forward, but considerably more remains to be done if the democratic promise of last February's Tahrir Square revolution is to be fulfilled and if a genuine process of democratic change akin to what is being observed in Tunisia and Libya is to get under way.  The Government will continue to work with our EU and international partners to assist Egypt along the path towards democratic transformation.
4112	SeanSherlock	Labour	14231.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	345	 The question for Ireland, the European Union and the wider international community is how best we can support the Egyptian people along the path towards full and a genuine democracy.  The first step in that process is the holding of parliamentary elections which are scheduled to take place next Monday.  The Government has committed €250,000 to the United Nations' development programme to support the electoral process in Egypt in the coming months and help to create a genuine and deep democracy that is respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms. High Representative Ashton was the first major international figure to visit Egypt.  She went to listen to the Egyptian people about how the European Union could support Egypt's transition to democracy.  The Union has promised greater political association, economic integration, mobility and financial support for Egypt and other countries experiencing democratic transition in return for real reforms.  It has made available €350 million until the end of next year to support the process of democratisation and the achievement of economic growth throughout the region. It is for Egyptians to determine their future.  In partnership with the European Union, Ireland can continue to accompany the Egyptian people in their praiseworthy efforts to build what we all want to see, a democratic Egypt, in order that its people can fulfil the basic aspiration of a better life and have the opportunity to fulfil their potential.

4119	SeanSherlock	Labour	14232.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	 While the areas around which public R&D budgets have been oriented to date (ICT, biotechnology, aspects of energy policy) were appropriate for building a broad base of national expertise in fundamental, underpinning science and technology we now need to leverage the strengths that have emerged from the investment that has taken place.  We need to target investment so that we have critical mass in areas that link more precisely to sustaining or growing jobs. The recommendations of the independently constituted Research Prioritisation Steering Group, chaired by Jim O'Hara, former General Manager, Intel Ireland, will be key in implementing efficiency and effectiveness in our system of public investment in R&D, and this will be complemented by other initiatives, notably the forthcoming legislation to extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to enable it to fund applied research. The report of the Research Prioritisation Group has been completed and submitted to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself and will shortly be brought to Government for consideration.  Future focus of investment on the priority areas identified will require greater cohesion of funding across Departments and agencies.  Achieving this cohesion is likely to be more impactful than a single funding stream per se.
4120	SeanSherlock	Labour	14232.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together. The Public Service Reform Plan published last Thursday 17th November sets out the State agencies that will be rationalised.  These include the merger of the Railway Procurement Agency with the National Roads Authority and the merger of the Irish Aviation Authority with the Commission for Aviation Regulation by June 2012.  There will also be a critical review by the same date of the establishment of a single transport safety body comprising of the Road Safety Authority, Railway Safety Commission and the Maritime Safety Authority.  The potential savings arising from these mergers will be identified as detailed implementation plans are developed.
4121	SeanSherlock	Labour	14237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	 The public consultation process referred to attracted more than 50 submissions from interested parties on this subject.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration. I consider that there is further work to be done on the issue between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General and I want to give this matter the fullest consideration.  It is an issue on which there is interaction between rights holders, the internet service providers (ISPS) and the end users, of whom there are millions.  We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct in this area.
4122	SeanSherlock	Labour	14237.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	 The information requested by the Deputy in respect of my Department is being compiled and will be forwarded as soon as possible. In relation to agencies, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to each of the agencies in order for them to provide the Deputy with further details. If the Deputy does not receive a reply from the agencies within ten working days, please advise my Private Office.
4123	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	416	 I thank Deputy Troy for raising this matter.  I have some sympathy for his position as I understand the frustration of any Deputy who represents areas outside of the large urban conurbations when it comes to attracting inward investment to their business parks.  I too have had words with the agency when it comes to its policy of attracting inward investment to places other than the larger urban conurbations. IDA Ireland's property portfolio comprises approximately 1,240 ha.  Under section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 the agency has responsibility for managing its property programme which consists of the acquisition and disposal of land, the development and servicing of land and the provision of building solutions.  The programme has been designed specifically to support the promotion of Ireland and its regions as a suitable location for foreign direct investment, FDI, by providing tailored property solutions. The midlands region is a priority for IDA Ireland and it is continuing to market the region, including Mullingar, to its existing clients and to potential new investors.  In line with the national spatial strategy and IDA Ireland's strategy, Horizon 2020, IDA Ireland is focused on advancing regional economic development, primarily through gateway locations and in the midlands this includes Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone. IDA Ireland has invested heavily in the business and technology park in Mullingar to make it more attractive to overseas clients.  The agency has confirmed that it will continue to promote this park and other local private property options to secure new investments for Mullingar and its surrounding areas.  As Ireland competes for high-end investments, the concept of scale is crucial to success.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talented people, effective physical and digital infrastructure, coupled with the availability of sophisticated support services, an attractive quality of life and proximity to third level institutions. IDA Ireland is actively marketing the midlands gateway through its network of overseas offices and is in regular engagement with all local economic stakeholders including local authorities, midlands gateway chamber, county development boards, academia and Enterprise Ireland to develop constantly the value proposition for the midlands and to provide the most attractive conditions for growth. With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute from within the midlands gateway.  IDA Ireland considers a project win in one midlands town to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. As well as marketing the region for new greenfield investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to deepen their mandate in Ireland and to continue to reinvest in their sites in the region.  This encourages further business in areas which are compatible with our skills base and which are sustainable within our economy in the longer term. The strategy of developing lands and property in advance of securing new business has been a fundamental and successful tool in the IDA's marketing to overseas clients.  The ready availability of property solutions often eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property and for completing necessary development work.  It also allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating many of the potential difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is an accepted that the role of IDA Ireland in making available appropriate and timely property solutions tailored to the needs of prospective multinational clients has been a key contributor to winning FDI to Ireland. I have been informed some clients tend to opt for site locations in larger urban areas.  I agree with the Deputy that there must be a meaningful dialogue with IDA Ireland around the designation of hubs in attracting inward investment to sites such as the one in question.  There may also be a need to examine more closely how these sites can be better utilised.
4124	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	418	 I have sympathy for the Deputy regarding the issues raised.  If one considers this from the vantage point of companies that may invest inward, they do not necessarily look at county boundaries or constituencies and, therefore, if they are considering the midlands gateway, they will look at the towns, in particular, not the county boundaries.
4125	SeanSherlock	Labour	14239.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	420	 I take what the Deputy said in good faith.  Given that Mullingar has a strong stakeholder forum, I respectfully suggest it should take up the cudgel through its local public representatives to forge a closer link or dynamic with IDA Ireland in respect of the issues he has outlined. With regard to a site visit, I can bring this to the attention of the Minister.  I have visited AIT and NUIM.  They are two fine institutions conducting world class research and there is continued investment by the Government in science, technology and innovation to ensure this world class research can be maintained. There is merit in the Deputy's contribution.  There has to be a dialogue around these sites throughout the country and how they are marketed and utilised.  We need a discussion about a more lateral approach and if a set of potential investors locally or a set of stakeholders or entrepreneurs who are from without the IDA Ireland portfolio want to engage, an approach should be made to the authority to discuss the potential of the land use.  I fail to see why that could not happen.  I thank the Deputy for raising these issues.

4130	SeanSherlock	Labour	14244.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1051	 Researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) are employed by their respective higher education institutions. Therefore individual researcher salaries are a matter for the higher education institutions. SFI is currently supporting approximately 3,000 researchers. On average, approximately  60% of any SFI grant award is a contribution to the salary costs of the researcher teams. The remainder of the SFI award goes towards supporting the research effort through overheads provision to the relevant higher education institution and covering the cost of necessary research equipment. Given the volume of individual awards, in excess of 2,200 to date, and the several thousands of researchers directly supported by SFI since its establishment in 2000, it is not possible to specify precisely the amount of capital grants that were a contribution to the salaries of researchers.

IDA Ireland continues to secure significant wins in FDI investment, a significant portion of which is due to the strong research base that Ireland has built up primarily through Science Foundation Ireland and the Programme for Research in Third-level Institutions over the past decade.  There is a very strong human capital capacity in the micro-electronics sector in Ireland, which reinforces our offering to FDI companies while also simultaneously enhancing our tradition of excellence in this area. The micro-electronics industry in Ireland has become much more high-value over the last decade. There is a high demand globally for skilled electronic engineering graduates including for micro-electronics circuit design work- especially for persons with several years' experience. The Irish approach to promoting interaction between universities and industry in the field of microchip design has been recognised by the prestigious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as the best in the world. The required skill sets are best developed in a semiconductor environment through in-company professional development programmes as well as public and private funded research programmes such as the Micro-electronic Competence Centre in the Tyndall National Institute, Cork and the NUI Maynooth Competence Centre in Micro-electronics. These initiatives are directly supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland — and build on the collaborative strengths of both industry and academia.

4141	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	194	" It is essential that European leaders make and implement clear decisions quickly to prove our shared determination to protect our currency, support member states that are working towards economic recovery, and introduce strong rules to ensure fiscal discipline.  Those are the words of the Taoiseach.  A philosophical debate needs to take place within this House about the nature of our membership of the European Union.  We either have an inter-governmental model or an inter-institutional or community method based model.  The question the Opposition must ask itself if it proposes a strong inter-governmental model, is if it will be based on one country with one vote or a qualified majority vote mechanism. Notwithstanding the current economic morass in which we find ourselves, since 1972 Ireland traditionally has always done much better through a community method.  It is through strong inter-institutional links, a strong European Parliament and smaller member states binding together that we can act as a contrary force to the weight of the larger countries.  If we implement a raw inter-governmental model, the ""Merkozy"" effect will always continue to hold sway.  We must have a qualitative debate about what membership entails, and this must be based not just on short-term political gain by certain parties in the House but in a proper discussion of membership. I do not see how a position can be reconciled where a party believes a referendum must be put on membership but it also argues that the powers of the ECB should be extended to cover more than its remit with regard to inflation.  The premise of the belief is that the referendum would be supported as it would expand the powers of the ECB.  The Sinn Féin Party must grapple with that idea.  Nobody should come to the House to talk about such wide issues as the loss of economic sovereignty without spelling out in detail what that means.  There is a bit of a Tadhg an dá thaobh approach from Sinn Féin on the matter, and its position is fundamentally contradictory."

4143	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	473	 The Government is attempting to create a necessary framework that seeks to reform and evolve the social protection code.  I would like to address my comments to the budgetary measures introduced.  If I stray from the exact contents of the Social Welfare Bill 2011, I do so because I want to comment on it in a wider context. We must consider the Social Welfare Bill 2011 in the wider budgetary context.  There are thousands of workers who are not in receipt of any type of social protection measure.  There is, therefore, a strongly held view that reform of the social protection code is necessary.  I take on board the views espoused by those speakers who preceded me.  We must have due regard to the extraordinary fiscal pressures we are under in terms of the deficit reduction target to which we are aligned. To be fair, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has genuinely sought to address the disability payment issue.  The Government has listened to what has been said by all sides of the House on that matter and has moved to address it.  Some of us are only in government a relatively short time and we openly acknowledge that there are issues in the budget which need to be addressed.  We acknowledge the statements made by Members on the opposite side in relation to that matter. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that the pressures on our social welfare budget are enormous.  The financial allocation for jobseekers' payments increased from €1.4 billion in 2007 to €3.9 billion this year, an increase of 176%.  The provision for State pensions has increased from €3.75 billion in 2007 to €4.7 billion this year.  We will need to increase this financial allocation year-on-year owing to the demographic profile.  An additional allocation of €1.75 million will be required in 2012.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is honouring the Government's commitment not to cut welfare rates, increase income tax on working people, to protect carers and to standardise child benefit payments.  The social protection measures in this Bill signal a move by Government to move our country closer to economic recovery and towards the restoration of our sovereignty.  Some €4.2 million will be provided for training on CE through the national training fund.  In addition, SOLAS will continue to provide access by CE participants to its training programmes.  The Department will spend €977 million on employment supports in 2012, up from €882 million in 2011.  It is in that context that reforms of labour market activation and supports funding and management are being examined, as well as funding received from other sources, including statutory organisations.  We must reform our welfare and training systems so that people who lose their jobs do not drift into long-term unemployment.  This is committed to in the budget.  The need to shift from a passive welfare system to a far more active approach is vital.  I am sure we would all subscribe to that philosophy regardless of our own political ideological views. The Government will publish Pathways to Work, which will outline its approach to deepening the labour market activation policy area.  In my view, the social protection budget needs to be viewed holistically.  Capital spending on job creating programmes will be increased in 2012.  My Department and its agencies will be able to continue current levels of spending on job creation, to increase the scope for some crucial programmes and to implement some new measures.  In my area of responsibility, research and innovation, there is an allocation of €370 million for 2012, although that is a slight decrease at only 98% of last year's provision.  However, it allows us to continue to support the collaboration between research and industry.  It will enable us to support Irish companies to gain capacity to develop innovative products and services, which are vital for survival and growth, and will strengthen Ireland's capacity to attract high quality foreign direct investment companies and to embed them here as a consequence of our cutting edge innovative profile, the ultimate aim being the creation of jobs and to move people back to work or into upskilling and away from the social protection measures on which they rely.  We know that companies that invested in research and innovation and ensured their products or services have a competitive edge have held or grown market share or employment. The increased capital budget in 2012 will allow for a 4% increase in the Enterprise Ireland capital budget, maintenance of the IDA and County Enterprise Boards capital budgets, delivery of the partial loan guarantee scheme and microfinance loan fund, an €18 million spend on innovation fund Ireland to further improve the Irish venture capital industry and, specifically, in the area of research and innovation, it will enable new technology centres in cloud, e-learning and financial services to be commenced.  There is also a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships, support for the Science Foundation Ireland research community of more than 3,000 researchers, including research teams working with more than 500 industry partners.  The programme for research in third level institutions will be also maintained.  The number of technology innovation development awards will be doubled to 200.  We are also improving R&D tax credits.  The first €100,000 of companies' expenditure on research and development will be allowed, on a volume basis, for the purpose of the R&D tax credit.  The outsourcing arrangements for R&D purposes will be improved in a targeted manner to allow the greater of the existing percentage arrangement or €100,000.  Companies will have the option of using some portion of the R&D to reward key employees who have been involved in research and development.  All of this will ensure companies can grow, create employment and move people, in particular research funded graduates, into workplaces, thus reducing people's dependency on social protection measures. The future for business lies in remaining competitive and maintaining an innovative edge over our competitors.  The initiatives on R&D tax credits announced in the budget will send a clear signal to businesses that this Government is supporting their efforts to develop new products and processes and to assist them in winning new markets in the current challenging environment and, ultimately to create jobs.  During the next two years, the Government will commit approximately €1 billion in enterprise capital supports.  The enterprise capital budget is not alone being largely maintained, the capital provision is receiving a small increase in 2012, its highest level ever.  In the context of total capital cuts of €750 million in 2012, this represents a major statement of Government priorities. The Government has chosen to prioritise jobs and enterprise.  The budget announcements this week are a tangible result of that choice.  The budget provision of €20 million will assist this process and the measures are designed to ensure that the Government aids recovery in order that those on the live register can take up the work that is being created as a result of these initiatives.  The Government has delivered on the commitment in the programme for Government not to cut primary social welfare payments.  Child benefit rates for the first two children remain unchanged at €140 per month.  The Government is unwilling to impose the level of cuts to social welfare spending espoused by the previous Government, that is, by an additional €665 million in 2012.  Instead, it is limiting the adjustment in social protection spending to €475 million or slightly more than 2% of the Department's spend in 2012. The primary weekly social welfare payments are fully protected.  For example, jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit remain unchanged at €188 per week, while the child benefit rate for the third child will be reduced to €148 and for the fourth and subsequent children to €160 from 2012.  If one compares this with Northern Ireland——
4144	SeanSherlock	Labour	14246.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	475	 —— child benefit in Northern Ireland is £102.50 per month for the first child and £67.70 per month for each additional child.  Moreover, the adult rate for jobseeker's allowance and benefit in Northern Ireland is £78.33 for an individual and £122.95 for a couple.  The rate here will continue to be €188 for an individual and €312.80 for a couple.  Payments to carers also will be maintained and the half-rate carer's allowance will continue to be paid to those who are full-time carers and who are in receipt of another welfare payment. One must provide context to this Social Welfare Bill.  Those who will pore over these debates for historical purposes must know that the loans that are financing our day-to-day spending are subject to the condition that we reduce our deficit to 3% of gross domestic product by 2015.  While the Government has been obliged to take some tough decisions, in fairness it has preserved the basic rates.  It also has acknowledged a mistake it made and is moving to address it.  The Government is trying to create labour market activation measures that will move people from dependence on social protection into work and is doing its best in that regard.

This €5m was for the provision of e-Journals, which allows scientific researchers access to key databases, to assist them in conducting their work. This was not an additional cost to the Exchequer in 2011. The indicative SFI allocation for 2012 is as follows: Capital/Research Grants allocation is €156m. Current expenditure/Pay allocation is €4.40m. Current expenditure/Non-Pay cost allocation to run SFI programmes is €4.49m.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. My Department does not set aside funding in its budget to cover expenditure resulting from severe weather.  Instead, local authorities are provided with flexibility, where possible, to amend their Specific Improvement Grants Programme or their Restoration Improvement Programme to accommodate remedial works.  As you will be aware, the initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these State grants is a matter for each local authority, and it is open to local authorities to prioritise these works and revise their applications should they wish to do so. The 2011 regional and local road grant allocations have now been allocated and there are no further funds available at this time from which an additional allocation could be made.
4155	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	" I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  A number of points have been raised in each of the contributions.  I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to respond.  I am concerned at the continuing situation at the Vita Cortex factory in Cork which has involved workers at the plant engaging in a sit-in since 16 December last arising from a dispute with their employer over redundancy payments.  The workers involved in the Vita Cortex sit-in are seeking severance terms of 2.9 weeks per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, in line with previous redundancy deals at the company, and they maintain this will amount to a total of €1.2 million.  We know that the workers had been offered a paltry sum of €1,500 to leave the premises over the Christmas period and they rightly rejected this offer claiming that the company would use their absence to remove important machinery and stock. The company stated that it informed workers that their redundancy would have to come from the State's social insurance fund unless NAMA agreed to release €2.5 million held on deposit by another Vita Cortex firm on foot of an Allied Irish Banks, AIB, loan taken over by NAMA.  However, NAMA issued a statement that these funds were put out of reach of the Vita Cortex group not by NAMA but by AIB two and a half years ago when they were pledged as security for loans.  While NAMA has stated that it empathises with the Vita Cortex workers, it has stated that: ""unfortunately legally it cannot simply use charged deposit funds pledged against loans of one company to meet costs incurred by a separate legal entity"".  NAMA also stated that it is the responsibility of the owners and shareholders of Vita Cortex to resolve this situation.  It is difficult to disagree with that contention.  In the interests of achieving a resolution in this dispute, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, urged both parties to avail of the State's industrial relations machinery as soon as possible with a view to exploring ways of resolving the issues in dispute. Officials from my Department were in contact with the workers' union representatives over the holiday period, in an effort to clarify the issues involved and to make them aware that the industrial relations machinery of the State is available to help them resolve the dispute.  I understand that the Labour Relations Commission has today invited both parties to meet in Cork next Tuesday to clarify the facts and to explore with the parties the potential for moving forward.  I welcome the initiative by the LRC and urge both parties to engage constructively in the process.  Engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way at this stage."
4156	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	 The ultimate aim is to ensure that the rights of workers are vindicated.  We all have that interest at heart.  The second aim is to ensure that corporate social responsibility is adhered to and that there is some degree of corporate governance.  I agree with the Deputies on the perceived Byzantine structures of Vita Cortex.  We must also remember that Vita Cortex was a recipient of State funding.  It would be in the interests of this State to ensure that we can shine a light on those companies in some way.  If there is a mechanism through which a query can be made to the Director of Corporate Enforcement about the company structure, then I actively encourage people to use it. It is impossible to say at this stage what the premise of the discussions will be.  The LRC extended the invitation just today and I hope that both parties will agree to engage in that process.  We should see where we can go from there.  Other points were raised in respect of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation meeting with both sides and with company management.  I will take back those points to the Minister. We need to ensure that the State will use its force in a positive sense to ensure that workers' rights are vindicated.  We are not going to rest on that-----

4158	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	 No one political entity in the House has a monopoly on the rights of workers.  I spoke with regard to the Vita Cortex case, in which there is a serious breach of corporate social responsibility and corporate governance, and the same applies in respect of this case.  There is no question but that the rights of workers have not been vindicated and have been trampled upon.  Under legislation from 1977 to 2007 governing the protection of employees, a number of provisions deal with an information and consultation process that must be entered into prior to any redundancies being implemented and the provision of information to employees and to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In this case, the Minister has not received any statutory notice of such redundancies.  That is a serious breach in the first instance.  There is a need for my Department to engage with Mr. Meegan and others of Mandate who, it is reported met KPMG today.  I would like to get an assessment of what transpired at that meeting because the points raised on this and the previous Topical Issue matter go to the heart of industrial relations policy and vindicating the rights of workers.  As a Government, we must ensure there are no precedents set and the legislation is adhered to by corporate entities, individuals and citizens.  There is no question that we support the rights of workers as set down in legislation and will seek to do so. By way of being helpful, I express my willingness to meet workers representatives on this issue in order that we can provide some degree of assistance where possible.  I am keeping my statement brief because I realise Members will wish to make further submissions.
4159	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	122	 I acknowledge the points made by the Deputies and I am not one to pay lip service to issues such as this.  With respect, I have indicated that I want to meet the workers' representatives on this issue.  I am concerned, as Deputy McDonald has pointed out, that there is a perceived breach of legislation.  There is a perceived breach of legislation in respect of sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 and Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations whereby employees, whose employer has not complied with sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, may refer complaints to a rights commissioner.  There are issues around the mandatory notice to employers.  Please allow me that mode of communication and let us see how we can proceed.
4160	SeanSherlock	Labour	14280.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	 I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise. The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal. The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet society service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability. In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information. It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month.

In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested  that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information."" A consultation process seeking comments from interested parties on the content   of a proposed legislative amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act, by means of a Statutory Instrument, was conducted over last June and July. More than 50 submissions were received.  I am extremely grateful to those interested parties and groups who responded. Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved. Broadly speaking, individual copyright holders and rights holders organisations supported the amendment in principle, with some arguing for stricter measures. The various elements of the communications industry who responded were mostly opposed.  Other contributors were concerned with the protection of fundamental rights in the digital environment and some feared for the freedom of the net. Legal opinion and closely argued legal positions which were submitted in the course of this process were referred to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration."

While the Act preceded the Directive, most of the Directive's provisions were known at the time and incorporated into the legislation. The outstanding provisions were transposed by S.I. No. 16 of 2004 European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2004. For the avoidance of  any doubt as to the transposition of one of the provisions of the directive, i.e. injunctions against intermediaries as set out in Article 8(3) of the directive, a further Statutory Instrument is planned to restate Irish law in this regard.

4172	SeanSherlock	Labour	14281.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-12 00:00:00	Prelude	111	 Achieving savings in the Department's budget has required difficult decisions.  Despite pressures on spending, the Government has shielded to the greatest extent possible front line services in schools.  The Government has and will continue to prioritise targeted supports for schools, with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme and action plan.  More than €158 million is currently being provided by way of additional resources and supports for primary and post-primary schools, including DEIS.  This is only part of an overall amount of some €700 million, which continues to be provided to tackle educational disadvantage across the full education spectrum, from pre-school to further and higher education.  This includes schemes such as the school completion programme and disadvantaged youth, which now come under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the school meals programme, which comes under the Department of Social Protection. It is important to note that a key aspect of the EU-IMF programme of support and Ireland's overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll.  This is a particular challenge for the education sector, considering that a third of all public sector employees work there.  Furthermore, unlike in other countries, our school-going population is rising rapidly and places must be provided for the extra 70,000 pupils arriving in our schools in the next six years.  Providing for increased enrolments is a key priority but making some adjustment to teacher numbers is unavoidable, given budgetary constraints. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.  We are conscious of the concerns of some schools which will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of posts under previous disadvantaged schemes, and with these concerns in mind we have made clear since the budget announcement that this matter would be managed as sensitively as possible.  To this end the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has met school principals, teachers, parents and community representatives in recent weeks to hear their concerns and clarify the position of announced changes in the 2012 budget to posts allocated to schools under previous schemes to tackle educational disadvantage. The Minister has held many meetings with members of my parliamentary party and all Government colleagues, who have performed an invaluable service in assisting him in developing an understanding of the impact of the proposed measures in these schools.  It is in this context that the Department of Education and Skills has been directed to report to the Minister within the next four weeks on the position of DEIS band one and band two schools which currently have posts under schemes predating DEIS.  That will done in the context of staff allocations due to issue to all schools in the coming weeks.  We look forward to receiving that report and continuing the process of engagement with schools on the impact of the measures announced in the 2012 budget.

It is our intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2011 by way of an order as soon after the enactment of the Patents Amendment Act 2011 as possible.  I am very conscious of the points the Deputy has made in that sense. I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill through Report Stage in this House.  The purpose of the Bill is to make the necessary changes to the Patents Act 1992 to provide for the ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement, which aims to reduce the cost to applicants of the European patent process by reducing the requirements to file translations of the granted patents under the European Patent Convention.  It is a technical Bill that deletes references in the existing Act to the requirement for translations to validate a European patent in Ireland.  The short Bill makes changes to the Patents Act 1992 that relate exclusively to the European Patent Convention. In this instance it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them in line with the London Agreement.  The proposed amendments to the patent rules 1992 are being drafted.  It is my intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2012 by way of an order as near to the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 as possible.  I thank the Deputies opposite and in particular Deputy O'Dea for their assistance in allowing us to introduce this legislation which strengthens the intellectual property infrastructure of Ireland, making Ireland a more competitive place to locate and manage intellectual property rights.

4190	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	121	 Students can study Russian on the leaving certificate curriculum.  There are a number of Confucius Institutes throughout the State where Chinese languages may be learned, as well as at University College Cork and quite a number of secondary schools.  As to Portuguese, I may revert to the Deputy on that one.  I note the point he is making; we are conscious of that. In his introductory speech, the Minister set out the rationale for the proposed Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011, which is necessary to meet our obligation to transpose the EU directive on temporary and agency workers.  In the contributions by Deputies on the Bill, it has been evident that there is, in general, an overall welcome for the Bill in this House, with most Deputies expressing their support in recognition of the fact that it is a fair and balanced measure to improve the level of protection for agency workers under employment law.  While Deputies have indicated broad support for the thrust of the Bill, I note the intention on the part of a number of Deputies to table amendments on Committee Stage in order to achieve greater clarity in some aspects of the Bill. In several interventions on the Bill, there has been a strong emphasis on the need for balance in the manner in which the EU directive is transposed, so that the necessary protections for agency workers do not act as a deterrent to our ability to sustain existing jobs and increase employment.  Given the current challenges that face the Government in the domestic labour market and the economy generally, the Bill has been drafted with a view to achieving this necessary balance.  It provides that agency workers are afforded equal treatment, in respect of their basic working and employment conditions, with directly recruited employees who occupy the same job.  This marks a further important step forward in workers' rights and builds on the already considerable baseline of rights afforded to agency workers in this country who are protected under the existing suite of employment legislation. The Government is fully committed to decent standards of employment across the spectrum of work.  It is clear that agency workers have, on an incremental basis, been brought within the scope of employment rights legislation over many years, including legislation on the payment of wages and unfair dismissals.  In addition, agency workers in Ireland, unlike in some other jurisdictions, also enjoy entitlements under redundancy payment legislation.  In terms of minimum standards of pay, temporary agency workers are already covered in legislation governing the national minimum wage; as Deputies will be aware, the Government has, true to the commitment given in the pre-election period last year, reversed the reduction in the minimum wage rate.  This Bill therefore builds on existing standards of protection that are conferred on agency workers and reflects the Government's willingness to fully support the principle of fairer treatment for agency workers. The Government must have regard to other equally valid concerns that have been expressed about the need to create a positive environment for businesses to grow and develop.  A number of Deputies referred to the importance of agency workers in the multinational sector as well as in the domestic economy.  A fully functioning labour market that contributes to the retention of jobs, and indeed future growth, is important in these challenging times.  We must maintain labour market flexibility in all areas, including the area of agency work, which provides flexibility for workers and employers alike. Deputies raised a number of issues during the course of the debate.  With regard to the failure of the national social partners to reach agreement on a qualifying period before equal treatment would apply, this is, as the Minister outlined in his introductory speech on the Bill, a matter of regret, as it would at least mean that recruitment agencies that operate both north and south of the Border would be operating under similar arrangements in both jurisdictions to allow an all-of-Ireland approach.  While there is still time for the national social partners to negotiate agreement on this issue should the basis for such an agreement become apparent before the deliberations of the Oireachtas on this Bill are complete and the Bill is enacted, the basis for such agreement is not currently in evidence and, as Deputies will be aware, the Legislature cannot unilaterally provide for this derogation. The legislation is, with the exception of the offence provisions, being made retrospective to 5 December 2011 - that is, the date of transposition of the directive.  This is because the State is obligated by virtue of its EU commitments under the treaties to have the transposing measure in place as and from the transposition date, and the advice available to the Government indicates that this course of action is required.  I appreciate the difficulties associated with retrospective application, and that is why, in the interest of providing the greatest possible level of clarity to all parties affected by this legislation, my Department moved quickly, following the breakdown of negotiations on the qualifying period with the national social partners on 30 November 2011, to communicate with the various stakeholders.  Advertisements were taken out in the national newspapers and the Department produced a guidance document and placed it on its website to cover the issues of greatest interest to all parties. A number of Deputies referred to the importance of agency working in the multinational and domestic sector and pointed out that, contrary to common perception, agency workers are in some instances very well remunerated.  It is important to note that the directive and this Bill aim to provide a new minimum floor of basic entitlements and pay.  For this reason, there is no intention to include other elements that are not required by the directive, such as pensions, sick pay, maternity top-up and benefits-in-kind.  The latter are discretionary elements that are not, in the words of the directive, binding and generally applicable.  Given the current economic circumstances, now is not the time to try to provide gilt-edged conditions of employment when the creation of employment on a fair and equitable basis is what is required. Under this Bill, agency workers are entitled to be treated, in their basic working and employment conditions, including pay, as if they were directly recruited by the hiring organisation to occupy the same job.  I am conscious that a number of interventions have focused on the need for a comparator in this situation, and have referred to the tests under section 2 of the Bill in which any such comparable employee might be identified.  I am conscious that the Bill needs to be as clear as possible to ensure delivery of the fundamental principle enshrined in Article 5.1 of the directive.  In this regard, it is not necessary for the purposes of this legislation and the entitlement of agency workers to equal treatment to have a real - what might be termed flesh-and-blood - comparator; section 6 of the Bill provides for this.  Of course, where there is such a comparator, that makes it easier to establish that equal treatment applies, and this is provided for in section 6(1)(a) of the Bill.  Where there is no such comparator, section 6(2)(b) effectively places the onus of responsibility on the hirer to notify the employment agency of the relevant terms and conditions, including pay rates, that would apply if a comparable employee were to be hired by the hirer. A number of Deputies referred to the fact that the outworking of the legislation gives rise to intricate and complex issues at an operational level.  For this reason, they considered that the Bill would benefit from further clarification in some instances.  In legislation of this nature, which is designed to embrace the main principles and policies at issue, it is difficult to encompass all of the outworking of the legislation that follows on from the Bill.  While I agree that the Bill will need to be perfected in certain aspects to provide some necessary clarifications - in that context, it is intended to table some amendments on Committee Stage - many of the issues raised by Deputies will be clarified by the development of further guidance.  It has been the practice of the Department in introducing new employment legislation to prepare a guidance publication that is better geared to deal in greater depth with the detail required, and that is also the intention in this instance. Finally, there was some discussion about section 7 of the Bill.  Deputy Boyd Barrett, in particular, had concerns about this section in case it was intended as some type of escape hatch from the provisions of the Bill.  It is important to clarify that this is not the intention behind section 7, which is a provision that is welcomed by all stakeholders in that it will recognise existing collective arrangements in place such as under registered employment agreements in some sectors.  It will also allow for the conclusion, in the future, of collective arrangements at workplace or sectoral level and provides a mechanism for the registration, subject to approval, of these agreements by the Labour Court.  This type of flexibility in the labour market is very much welcomed by all parties that have an interest in this legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it is intended to bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage with a view to clarifying certain aspects that have been already mentioned.  I thank the Deputies for their considered interventions on this important Bill.

However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their postgraduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the student grant scheme. In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold.  The income threshold for this level of grant is being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012-13 academic year.

Another 4,000 students will receive a fee contribution of €2,000.  The new arrangements will apply to two thirds of the postgraduate cohort on the lowest incomes, which is arguably a wider cohort of students.
4196	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	233	 It is like trying to measure how long is a piece of string.  We cannot predict the impact of this in terms of exact numbers and participation rates.  Participation rates at third level are determined by a myriad of factors and income is not the only criterion.  Parental aspects, social and cultural factors, the level of pre-existing educational attainment, whether someone is in employment, whether someone has lost a job and a certain amount of income are other factors.  One can safely assume it will have a negative impact but we do not know for certain and there is no way of measuring its impact.  It is part of a package of measures the Department and the Government had to take in reducing spending.  We are honest about that.  We must try to ensure the student assistance fund, at the behest of individual institutions, is retained and that tax reliefs for postgraduate students are retained.  Arising from these budgetary adjustments, the people who are least affected are the people who will be given the greatest chance to go to postgraduate education, namely, those who are on the lower income thresholds.  We have tried to protect and preserve that.
4197	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	236	 That is a very subjective statement.  There is no way of predicting the number of people who will apply for postgraduate courses, except to say that it is increasing year on year.  Ironically, this increase is as a result of the loss of economic sovereignty.  I take the point made by Deputy Smith in respect of interaction with industry.  The research prioritisation exercise will be published and its purpose is to derive greater economic benefits from the research we are carrying out.  There is a deepening collaboration between industry and academia in terms of research.  I am talking to global companies that provide thousands of jobs in this country and I am talking to indigenous firms that want to move into the space of taking on board more graduates.  Labour market activation measures, which will be launched shortly, will also attest to this. In terms of the finite number, we must know the number of people who will apply for funding before we know the endgame in terms of the amount allocated.  There is no doubt that the level of a person's economic resources has an impact on the level of educational attainment.  We are seeking to ensure we can fund those with the lowest incomes.  A number of postgraduate research based courses are funded by industry or through calls.  We must also bear this in mind.
4198	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	247	 I am pleased to note that the National Competitiveness Council endorses the approach outlined in Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life which I launched in July 2011.  The Strategy provides for a range of measures which will improve mathematics.  These include curriculum reform, actions with parents to support their children's learning, improved initial and continuing professional development for teachers, strengthened assessment, school leadership and planning, and support for children with identified needs. In that context, a national programme of professional development is under way for primary and second level schools.  Primary schools have been asked to increase the time spent on mathematics by 70 minutes per week from January 2012, to introduce a third point of standardised testing in literacy and maths, and to report the results to parents as part of an overall report on their children's progress. I recently launched a report on the first phase of evaluation of DEIS which shows significant improvements in literacy and numeracy scores since 2006/7, and a report of English reading and Mathematics achievement in Irish medium schools.
4199	SeanSherlock	Labour	14288.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-19 00:00:00	Prelude	341	 The Enterprise Platform Programme (EPP) comprises a suite of entrepreneurship development courses operated by the Institutes of Technology (IoTs).  The Programme has become an established mechanism for the development of entrepreneurs and the creation of start-up businesses across the regions. The Programme was funded until mid-2010 by the Higher Education Authority at which point budgetary responsibility transferred to Enterprise Ireland. During 2011 Enterprise Ireland and the IoTs conducted a review of the current programme, with the objective of improving programme performance and increasing value for money.  Arising from this review the operation of the programme has been redesigned in an effort to ensure increased value for money through more competitive operating costs, greater economies of scale through, for example, partnerships and consortia of IoTs, higher standards of entry and progression, and more focus on output metrics.  The overarching aim of the programme is to accelerate the development of sustainable new businesses which have strong employment and export potential.  The enterprises developed on the programme will be primarily based on a technology or innovative business application.  Enterprise Ireland anticipates that approximately 100 business starts of varying scale will emerge from the programme annually and that of these a significant proportion will evolve to become HPSUs. The revised EPP will operate as an intensive programme focusing on developing the entrepreneur's skills and the business concept.  It will be targeted at scaleable businesses based on innovative or knowledge intensive product or service and will seek high-quality potential entrepreneurs who show both the commitment and the capability to develop sustainable businesses. The following IoTs will operate the programme and are currently phasing in the new programme. Waterford IT in partnership with IT Carlow Cork IT Limerick IT in partnership with IT Tralee Galway Mayo IT IT Sligo in partnership with Letterkenny IT Dundalk IT IT Tallaght in partnership with IT Blanchardstown Dublin IT Athlone IT Enterprise Ireland will provide expertise and support to the IoTs and will engage in promotion of the programme both nationally and overseas to high-quality potential entrepreneurs.

4211	SeanSherlock	Labour	14293.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-24 00:00:00	Prelude	558	 I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal. The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability. In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.  It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month. The Minister does not have information in relation to the costs of copyright infringement in the area of digital piracy.  Independent research as to the effects of illegal downloading is limited therefore the costs of such activity are not readily quantifiable. However, in the judgement of Mr Justice Charleton in EMI & Others vs UPC (2009 no. S472 P) it is noted that Mr Dick Doyle of the Irish Recorded Music Association posited a cost of €20m per annum in relation to music.
4212	SeanSherlock	Labour	14293.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-01-24 00:00:00	Prelude	558	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 718 to 720, inclusive, together. I am actively pursuing the rationalisation programme set out in the Public Service Reform Plan with the relevant agencies.  Developments so far in relation to agencies for which I have responsibility are that Dundalk Port Company merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, and Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1 January 2012. I also recently announced that Dublin Tourism is being merged with its parent body — Failte Ireland — as part of the rationalisation programme. Furthermore, there is a review being undertaken with regard to the future tourism role of Shannon Development and its possible integration into Fáilte Ireland, while Coaching Ireland has been subsumed into the Irish Sports Council. On the issue of possible further rationalisation, the Public Service Reform Plan requires that a number of other agencies are subject to critical review which will be completed by June of this year. In addition, a ports policy review is at an advanced stage and I hope to publish a revised policy document in the coming months. Port Company restructuring is one of the issues being considered as part of the policy review.  It is not possible to quantify the potential savings from rationalisation until full details of each implementation have been worked through with the agencies in question.
4213	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	640	 There are no proposals to introduce a Government guaranteed export credit insurance scheme for Irish exporters to these countries.  The Government's position on this issue has been informed by the findings of the 2009 report commissioned by my Department from KPMG consultants.  That report established that the introduction of such a scheme would be expensive, with significant ongoing costs arising for the State.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about €1.7 million, and this cost would rise significantly if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative. Under EU state aid rules, any such state scheme is not normally permissible for short-term credit insurance.  Most Irish exports fall into this category.  A temporary derogation was established in 2009 due to the financial crisis at that time.  That is now under review and is very unlikely to be maintained.  Even under this current exemption, the specific provisions of any scheme must be approved by the European Commission.  Approval would include a condition that the level of insurance premia to be paid by companies should be higher than rates provided in the open market.  This is a considerable deterrent to business, and some of the schemes introduced by other member states had poor uptake for this reason. In the intervening two years, there has been an improvement in the market for short-term export credit insurance.  Insurers have recovered their capacity for risk and the market has recovered significantly, with both new entrants to the market and new products being offered.  This has greatly improved the availability of export credit insurance on the commercial market. The publication of the detailed KPMG report is not possible.  The forensic analysis on the operation of the market for this type of insurance was only possible through the provision of sensitive, confidential data and detailed company specific information to KPMG.  This information was provided to KPMG on the condition of strict confidentiality.  Given the commercial sensitivity of this material and the limited number of companies in the market, both KPMG and the Department signed legally binding agreements with the insurers that the information provided would not be released. Additional information not given on the floor of the House. While the background research and analytical elements of the KPMG report cannot therefore be released, the key overall findings were publicised at the time and supported the view that a State supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.  This remains the position but will be kept under ongoing review, including in light of advice and evidence from the appropriate agencies and business representative groups.  As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, a commitment of large-scale funding to an initiative with marginal benefits for Irish industry and high level risks to the State would be unwise.
4214	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	642	 I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  The strict confidentiality clause, which was one of the conditions that applied when people gave information during the compilation of that report, should be respected.  We can provide the Deputy with the information that is available from Enterprise Ireland about export figures and the opportunities that are arising in the BRIC countries.  The Deputy also asked about investment in jobs and the opportunities that will arise after February.  A great deal of work is ongoing at Government level to compile the new action plan for jobs.  More lateral themes are being explored as we do that.  I hope the Deputy will take in good faith my assurance that we are trying to explore and mine as many opportunities as we can.  I say that in response to the point she made about job creation.  If I understood the point the Deputy was making correctly, she said we should avail of the intellectual capacity of people who will find themselves in a new situation after February of this year.  The State needs to provide opportunities to such people, or engage with them at least.

4217	SeanSherlock	Labour	14294.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1358	" My Department, through the work of the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offers a range of supports to assist and enable Irish entrepreneurs and enterprises to engage in the optimal exploitation of innovation, research and development and to apply for patents.  The Patents Office provides information supports to applicants through the Office's website www.patentsoffice.ie   regarding patenting procedures in Ireland and abroad. The Patents Office also provides an Intellectual Property (IP) clinic service providing members of the public, inventors, entrepreneurs and business people an opportunity to discuss on a one to one basis with Patents Office staff their ideas and matters concerning IP. Since April 2010, the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Enterprise Europe Network and County Enterprise Boards have partnered to present a series of one day free seminars at a range of regional locations under the working title of ""Building a Business on your Ideas"".  Support nationally and locally for micro enterprises, small businesses and new start ups is provided through the wide range of assistance offered by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland.   Both the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland tailored programmes and supports in the form of grants, business advice, training and mentoring elements of which are directed at ensuring that innovative technologies and intellectual property are secured and protected. EI has strengthened the resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property and have recently appointed (January 2012)  an Intellectual Property Manager,  whose role is to act as the central point in EI for enquiries and advice on IP matters as a strategic tool in business development.  In addition, EI's Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme drives the national effort in transferring IP from the research base in the HEIs and Research Institutes in Ireland into industry, while the Technology Partnering Programme aims at partnering Irish client companies with multi-national corporations with a view to facilitating access to and promotion of significant technologies via licensing of IP and technology spin-outs.  EI also provides funding support for innovative High Potential Start-Ups under which assistance is provided towards the patent costs of the company to protect its in-house intellectual property.  Under the EI R&D Fund patent costs are an eligible expenditure item which can be included in the support offered. While it is first and foremost a matter for owners of IP to decide on the best way to protect IP rights, those owners can be confident that the Government is committed to ensuring Irish IP legislation reflects best practice in IP protection systems in Europe and elsewhere.  Indeed, the Government has been making a sustained effort over recent years to ensure that patent, trademark, industrial design and copyright laws, among other IP areas, are kept as up to date as possible. This work arises primarily in the context of EU and other international obligations. In the area of patents, my Department continues to make it easier for enterprises to patent their innovations. The Patents Amendment Bill 2011, currently in the Seanad, will enable Ireland to implement the London Agreement with the effect of lowering the current high level of translation costs for patent applicants. At EU level, Ireland is actively participating in the enhanced cooperation process for a unitary patent that will further reduce costs for Irish innovators wishing to obtain patent protection across Europe."

4223	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	496	 I will begin by confirming that this is absolutely not a version of the SOPA legislation.  It is a restatement of a position on copyright that the Government has held to be the case.  The Charleton judgment in the case of EMI v. UPC held that Ireland was not ad idem with the EU copyright directive.  We are implementing a statutory instrument to give voice to that judgment and bring us into line with the directive.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 was implemented in the State.  Every member state of the European Union has the right to seek an injunction, in line with EU legislation, in the event of a perceived infringement of the copyright of a party.  Prior to the Charleton judgment, to which we were not a party, our position was that we were in line with EU legislation.
4224	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	498	 I do not have one.  When Mr. Justice Charleton issued his judgment, we considered it was best to remove any doubt by restating our position, as set out in the 2000 Act.  That is what is before us today - an amendment to the Act to ensure we are in line with the judgment.  Every member state has the right to seek an injunction in the event of a perceived breach of copyright.  Before a judge makes a decision he or she will need to have regard to the e-commerce directive which states there are inherent rights in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to freedom of expression and that the copyright directive provides that an Internet service-provider has the right to conduct a business and to have regard to the right of ordinary users to be able to use the Internet freely and openly.  We would not seek to prejudice this right in any way.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  The State funds new technologies, the development of web-based technologies to the tune of millions of euro annually and we very conscious of the need to continue to do so. I take Deputy Murphy's point about the abdication of responsibility.  However, I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that we need to see a dialogue, an engagement, between the Internet service-providers on one hand, the copyright holders on the other side and a space in between for a very highly active Internet web-based community.  They all need to sit down together to chart a way forward.  Personally, I am not averse to the notion of primary legislation but no matter what action is decided upon, we must have regard to the Charlton judgment.  If, prior to this judgment, the State already held that a person could seek infringement proceedings where a breach of copyright is perceived and there have been no sites closed down as a result, we are merely restating what is in the Copyright Act or adding to it, then it is logical to assume there will not be a move to close down further websites.
4225	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	500	 I apologise.  This is an issue which warrants more time but I will speak again if I may.
4226	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	502	 That is not what I said.
4227	SeanSherlock	Labour	14295.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	506	 I reiterate the point that no national authority or court can require an Internet service-provider to carry out general monitoring of the information it transmits on its network.  That gives rights to the Internet service-provider and to the individual IP address or the individual user.  This means the ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  This is clearly stated in EU law. We are attempting to balance the right of the copyright holder and to transpose that which is already in EU law and then to recognise the rights of the individual user, the individual business and not to limit the freedoms of the Internet.  Nobody wants to limit the freedoms of the Internet because this is counter-intuitive.  We live in a democracy and we thrive on the businesses we have created in this country, through State intervention and subsidies which support those types of businesses. The business model pertaining to the music industry is increasingly and arguably - I will not use the word outmoded - an evolving process.  So long as it is a case of never the twain shall meet, then no matter how one legislates primarily in this field, as soon as one legislates, the Internet, of its very nature, will evolve in a way to circumnavigate the legislation.  In my view, the stakeholders must sit down together in an organic fashion because if they do not reach an agreement then no matter what Government is in power, it will never be able to legislate for this issue.  Given the level of activity on the Internet, which is to be welcomed, and the level of innovation, no one member state, no one geographical boundary, can set laws to try to control it.  This is a commonly-held view to a certain extent.  I think a liberal view is taken, in the main, regarding the power of the Internet and its inherent good.  However, as an EU member state, Ireland must have regard to copyright law.  Anyone who generates intellectual property has a right but that right is not superior to the right of the Internet service-provider nor superior to the right of the individual user.  When governments legislate, they must be very careful.

4243	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	327	" Let me start by repeating that I fully subscribe to the freedoms, the opportunities and the access to information that the Internet provides us with.  Ireland is home to some of the world's most innovative Internet companies and we are determined to grow our reputation as a location where smart people and these smart companies can continue to innovate in this fast moving arena. The last thing innovators need is a culture where the outputs of their creative endeavours have to be locked away or kept secret for the fear of theft.  Ireland is very proud of the fact that we have a modern suite of intellectual property laws that by their very nature balance a range of competing interests and rights in a manner that is seen right across the globe as reasonable and proportionate.  I intend that this will continue. In regard to the proposed statutory instrument, it may be useful to explain the background against which the requirement for an amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 has arisen.  In the EMI and others  v. UPC High Court judgment of 11  October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton decided that he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and thus could not grant an injunction to prevent infringement of copyright against an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of “mere conduit” transient communications.  In doing so, he stated that Ireland had not fully transposed the relevant EU directives. The ""mere  conduit"" principle provides that if an ISP does not initiate a transmission, or modify the material contained in a transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission, it is granted a ""safe harbour"" against liability by virtue of the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.  However, according to the same directive, this freedom from liability does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements. I point out that two EU directives, namely, the Copyright Directive 2001 and the Enforcement Directive 2004 require that the holders of copyright - authors, music composers, lyricists, record producers, etc. - are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  What is an intermediary?  In a nutshell, an intermediary is an ISP which provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet. My Department had considered that injunctions were available under section 40(4) of the Copyright Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  However, this was not Mr. Justice Charleton's view. In regard to the legal advice, the Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for its advice as to the implications of the High Court judgment.  The office has advised that the obligation contained in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rightholders must have a mechanism available to them to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  Separately the office advised that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance. I fully acknowledge that this is a very sensitive issue.  We seek to strike a balance between creators and users and intermediaries in regard to online services and businesses, which are of great importance to Ireland's economy.  Considering this, and in the context of the obligations due under the EU directives, discussions took place with the Office of the Attorney General and the legal adviser in our Department in order to frame a draft regulation and put it into the public domain for consultation.  The regulation follows the wording of the copyright directive so that we are in compliance and includes a very important proviso that the courts shall have due regard to the rights of any person likely to be affected and this includes, where appropriate, a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This latter provision respects the European Convention on Human Rights. After consultations with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, my Department launched a public consultation on the text of the proposed statutory instrument on 17 June 2011.  In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Association of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Limited, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, the IDA, IMIR, the International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone and Xtra-vision. Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.  The consultation attracted over 50 submissions from interested parties.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue, as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for further consideration. Following this, and after meetings with interested parties, it is clearly necessary to proceed with the statutory instrument which will restate the law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries which was considered to pertain prior to the judgment.  This will make compliance with the copyright directive manifestly clear.  The wording of the statutory instrument has been formally drafted and the text was published last Thursday, 26 January. There is no change of policy being put forward in the proposed legislative measure. It is merely a restatement of the position that was considered to be in place before a High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in October 2010.  I would like people to note the timeline, which was in October 2010.  Ireland is obliged to provide that rightsholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It should also be noted that legal proceedings against the State have been issued by the plaintiffs in the UPC case and damages arising from a successful challenge could be substantial.  The European Commission also requested information, on 22 December 2011, on Ireland's compliance with the copyright directive. While the copyright directive requires that rights holders must be able to seek an injunction against intermediaries to prevent or terminate an infringement, the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights - such as the right to freedom of expression and information, data protection, and the right to conduct a business - and that any remedy must be proportionate. No national authority or court can require an ISP to carry out general monitoring of the information that it transmits on its network.  This means an ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  National courts must strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures. As regards relevant case law, I refer to the recent Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, case, Scarlet  v. Sabam, C-70/10, which enunciated the general principles in relation to the balances required to be taken into account.  In this case on 24 November 2011, the CJEU clearly laid out the aforementioned principles that will guide all national courts in future. I beg your indulgence on this, Acting Chairperson, because there are some pertinent points."
4244	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	329	 I will read faster. In that case, the CJEU also found that requiring an ISP to install a contested filtering system would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information. I am fully aware that concerns have been expressed that the proposed statutory instrument mirrors the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States.  However, I would point out that these concerns are not based on fact.  The most worrying aspects of the US proposals would involve blocking access to websites internationally; taking down entire websites for one infringing item; blocking access to websites by the US state enforcement without notice; targeting companies between the site and end-user, without notice - for example, service providers, search engines, payment network providers and advertising networks; imposing a monitoring of content requirement on Internet companies and, in effect, forcing them to self-censor; extension of criminal liability; the by-passing of safe-harbour provisions in copyright law; lack of due process; disregard for fundamental human rights; and the involvement of government in civil infringement areas, etc. I would stress that such a regime could not be introduced in the EU, where the safe-harbour provisions are protected in the e-commerce directive and where, in implementing EU law, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights must be applied.  This includes the right to conduct a business, protection of data, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information with the right to intellectual property.  Critically, any order granted must be proportionate.  These matters must be considered when deliberating on the granting of an injunction. It is of the utmost importance to note that the purpose of the proposed statutory instrument is simply to provide explicitly that injunctions may be sought, as obligated by the two EU directives that I have already referred to, namely, the copyright directive, 2001 and the enforcement directive, 2004.  It should also be noted that such injunctions are available in all other EU member states by virtue of the two directives already referred to.  They have been required since at least December 2002 and since that time the Internet has flourished. In granting such injunctions, the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgments.  As I have already stated, these judgments require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  The statutory instrument is sufficient because, particularly following the Court of Justice decision in the Scarlet  v. Sabam case, the courts have authoritative guidance on the balance to be achieved between, on the one hand, intellectual property rights and, on the other hand, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet service providers, the protection of private data, the right of freedom of expression and information, and proportionality of any remedy.
4245	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	339	" I thank the Members opposite and I appreciate the Acting Chairman's discretion. My Department launched an independent review committee on 9 May 2011, with a view to examining and reviewing the existing Irish copyright and legislative framework.  The Copyright Review Committee is an independent body.  Its terms of reference are clear and, in general, are concerned with identifying any areas that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation, and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified. Following the advice of both the former and current Attorneys General, it is considered necessary that Ireland's position in ensuring that rightsholders can apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are being used to infringe their copyright, must be restated.   Otherwise, the State is at risk of actions against it, which would probably result in substantial damages.  Nothing the review committee could suggest can change this fact.  It is difficult to see what conditions could be attached to the statutory instrument that are not already provided for by EU law, for example, data protection, freedom of expression, information, and freedom to conduct a business.  The copyright review committee is expected to publish its first consultation papershortly following consideration of the submissions received.  One of the items for further consideration could be a voluntary forum for all stakeholders, in which various copyright matters could be discussed. An intermediary is an ISP that provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet.  As such, an entity such as www.boards.ie, because it avails of the hosting exemption, could be considered an intermediary.  However, no injunction may be taken against it provided it abides by the notice and take down procedures as set out in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, to which section 40(4) refers. In conclusion, in proposing to amend the copyright legislation, I am particularly conscious of the importance of online content and digital businesses in the Irish context and, by introducing the proposed statutory instrument, I am simply seeking to ensure Ireland's continued compliance with its obligations under the relevant EU directives following the decision of the High Court in the aforementioned UPC case.  It is clear from the rulings of the European court that any remedy applied will have to be proportionate and we can be confident that this approach protects rightsholders by allowing them the access to the courts that we must provide while protecting the fundamental rights of third parties and fellow citizens. Changes are expected at EU level in several areas affecting e-commerce.  For instance, the main objective of the informal competitiveness Council in Copenhagen on 2 and 3 of February 2012 is to reach a common understanding of the most important, concrete actions needed at EU level and in member states to create a well-functioning digital Single Market.  It is understood that discussions will be held on the necessity for providing clarification at EU level on the liability of Internet service providers and to provide certainty for those providers when made aware of illegal content on their websites.  Among other proposals, a European framework for notice and action procedures will be considered. Going back to 22 December 2002, the date by which every EU member state had to have implemented Directive 2001/29/EC, every EU country has had to ""ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right"".  Having that provision enshrined in EU law and the laws of member states for a decade has not restricted the development of the Internet or innovative Internet companies.  On the contrary, the Internet has flourished.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her indulgence in granting me a few extra minutes."
4246	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	348	 As I outlined in my speech, one must have regard to proportionality.  The Sabam ruling is such that if somebody were to seek an injunction before a judge, the latter would have to establish that infringement occurred in the first instance.  In making such a decision, a judge must have regard to the basic rights that exist.    Members articulated the circumstances that arise in this regard with reference to the EU charter of fundamental rights and the rights in the copyright directive.  A judge would have to have regard to the facts that there is a copyright holder and that there is an individual ISP, a business, with the right to conduct its business, as is inherent in the EU copyright directive.  In other words, the right of the copyright holder is not superior to that of the individual citizen or business. With regard to seeking an injunction and measuring costs, there is no way of determining the actual cost, even though individuals have come forward with proposals on the cost of a High Court injunction.  I would have faith in the fact that the Irish judicial system would have to have regard to the fact that there are specific rights regarding monitoring, especially in light of the Sabam ruling. On the effect of an ISP, one must ask what is an intermediary.  I have outlined this in my speech and will probably not repeat it.  It is question of proportionality.  If a person is accessing a site such as www.youtube.com and is not acting legally, a court would have to have regard to the need for proportionality.  Why would an Irish court shut down an Irish website, potentially with millions of users, because of the actions of one person?  One could argue it would be an infringement of the right of the business person to conduct his business.  The issue of proportionality, therefore, must come into play.  There are certain fundamental rights that must be adhered to.  Before an injunction is sought, a judge in Ireland would have to have complete regard for those rights.  I hope that answers the question.
4247	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	352	 I take the Deputy's points.  I do not believe reputational damage will arise from this.  It is a statutory instrument.  We must ask its purpose.  We must bear in mind Mr. Justice Charleton's judgment in the case of EMI and others v. UPC.  Advice received from the Attorney General under the last and current mandates stated that, in order to remove any doubt as to the right of the copyright holder to seek an injunction, the best approach would be to amend existing legislation.  In this statutory instrument, all we are doing is amending existing legislation, namely the Copyright Act.  Having regard to the Charleton ruling, we are putting ourselves in a position in which there will be no doubt as to whether we will be compliant with EU law.
4248	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	354	 No.  I draw attention to the circumstances that would obtain if we were not a party to the EMI and others v. UPC case.  It could be stated that, under the Copyright Act 2000, the right to seek an injunction over an infringement already existed.  We are merely restating that position. The reason for much of the controversy on this stems from the fact that this issue has been arising for well over a year, bearing in mind the Charleton judgment was in 2010.  The new Government instigated a review and engaged in consultation.  People are accusing us of not consulting but we had a consultation period.  I made it clear to people that I was open to discussions with all stakeholders on this issue.  As late as last Thursday, I met the Irish Internet Association and had further discussions with it. We are not trying to impose something.  If we were to legislate from a primary perspective in regard to the Internet, we would have to be very careful about how we would do that given there are so many disparate communities within the web space as well as the copyright holders.  My preferred option, given the EU is now looking at the copyright or e-commerce directive, is that the community would start talking across the various and disparate groupings, such as the hosters, the ISPs, the software developers, the copyright holders and so on.  It is important that this community starts to consult with the various stakeholders within the community to begin the process of coming up with a strategic view as to how we can either legislate primarily or put in place voluntary agreements. My preferred option is for voluntary agreements because assuming all stakeholders come to the table honestly and openly, this ensures that if primary legislation is implemented it does not become outmoded or outdated as soon as it is enacted by virtue of further innovations within the web.  What we are doing here is merely restating a position which we hold to have already existed, namely, upholding the right of the copyright holder while having regard to the balance of rights in that respect. I do not believe primary legislation is required at this stage.  The Technical Group has put forward a proposal for a statutory instrument.  If time allows and bearing in mind there are more questions to follow, I would like to answer the individual points the Technical Group has made given it has put forward an honest and open solution to this issue.  While I have only had a brief few hours to analyse it, since it was submitted today at 12.45 p.m., there are some issues within it which I would like to address because I consider it an honest effort to address the issues at hand.
4249	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	357	 On Deputy Eoghan Murphy's point, Ireland has the concept of the take-down notice.  I use www.boards.ie and there are other examples with which we are all familiar, such as YouTube.  If a person becomes a member of www.boards.ie, the presumption is that the person has signed up to a set of behavioural protocols by which he or she will abide, and will not say anything defamatory or do anything that is in breach of copyright, as an individual user.  If the person does that, there is a mechanism so that, through its own monitoring mechanisms, www.boards.ie can expel an errant user or somebody who is, if I may use the term, acting the maggot.  Therefore, this already exists as a voluntary code dealing with behaviour. If, however, we begin legislating in a proscriptive way for every single behaviour on the Internet, we will be going down a very narrow funnel.  As I have stated and to answer Deputy O'Dea's question, the informal competitiveness council is to try to come up with a set of actions in regard to the issues we are talking about, which is the correct approach.  However, the reason we have had to implement the statutory instrument, as the Deputy will appreciate given he was a member of the last Government, is that this has been ongoing for a considerable period and the State is potentially exposed to being sued by various entities.  I must have regard to the fact it is taxpayer's money which is potentially in question. The point is that I do not believe an Irish judge, if he or she is having regard to the e-commerce directive, will not also have regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has come into operation and is the legal entity, and also the SABAM ruling.  I do not believe any Irish judge would not adhere to the principles of proportionality in this sense. To go back to the point about take-down notices, if a hoster decides it is not going to take down the content following a take-down notice on the assumption that this take-down notice is on foot of a real breach of copyright, perhaps it is then open for the person against whom the infringement occurs to seek the injunction.  What we want to do is to get into a space in this country where the system operates on a voluntary basis, with clear protocols.  To be fair, the music industry needs to adopt new models and needs to begin to get its music on to more platforms, as noted by Deputy O'Dea, and needs to begin finding new mechanisms for selling its music.  Already, Netflix is coming on stream, which will also give rise to issues.  The more content that is legally available through a multitude of mechanisms, the more likely it is we will encounter copyright theft and piracy issues. That is where we want to get to.  However, I do not believe the State should be too prescriptive about how we get to that point.  I would like to see the community coming together on that issue.
4250	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	360	" I refer to Deputy Ferris's point.  People are interpreting this as us doing the bidding of the large corporations.  This is not the stop on-line piracy act, SOPA.  We are not extending massive powers of intervention so that we can step into the breach to try to protect one side over another.  This is not SOPA legislation.  This is balancing the right of a copyright holder against the right of an individual. There are inherent rights in the charter of fundamental rights and in the e-commerce directive which give rights to the individual company to conduct its business.  We must also have regard to the rights of the copyright holder, which could be a small publishing house.  People perceive the copyright holder to be ""big music"" but it could be a small Internet publishing business, a person creating his or her own music at home.  They have copyright and certain protections.  I do not believe this measure will be used by big business as a tool to beat down websites.  Google is one of the biggest corporations in the world and it has a right to do business here if it has an Irish or European Union domain.  Those rights are protected but are not subservient to the right of the copyright holder. I take the Deputy up on a point he made about the statutory instrument.  He is infinitely more experienced than I am, as a legislator, and he will appreciate that this is not new policy and therefore a statutory instrument can apply.  We are not at odds with the programme for Government in this because we are only amending legislation.   I reply respectfully to the Deputy in that regard. This is a balancing between the two.  The small guy or girl who begins with the gaming industry have certain rights as copyright holders and we must protect them as much as we must protect the citizen's right to access the Internet.  Proportionality is the key to this debate."
4251	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	363	 At this point, I will address the points submitted by the Technical Group in regard to the statutory instrument.  I will briefly give my analysis of them.  There is not a great deal of difference between the two statutory instruments.  I respect the point made.  We are not setting out a new policy framework but clarifying legislation through an amendment to the copyright Act.  We are going back to the position prior to the EMI v. UPC case where the right to seek an injunction by a copyright holder was there. I note the Technical Group's alternative clauses propose the statutory instrument be of two-year duration.  We have to monitor events, however, in the intervening two years and move quickly if essential balances are not maintained.  That would be impeded by a two-year clause. On the Technical Group's paragraph c, my proposed statutory instrument already includes a provision that the courts will have due regard to the rights of any person affected by virtue of the grant of any such injunction and the court will give such direction, including where appropriate a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This covers the Technical Group's point and to our mind it would be the action of a prudent judge. On paragraph d, the remedy of damages will not be available against an intermediary provided it abides by the e-commerce directive.  Again, the e-commerce directive has certain rights which protect the business.  Given the wide variety of circumstances that may prevail, it is felt the best approach is to have the matter dealt with case by case through a judicial process which must balance all the rights involved.  Protections are already in place under European law.  The European Court of Justice requires all remedies must be proportionate while the right to freedom of expression and to conduct a business must be balanced with the right to intellectual property in considering the granting of an injunction.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights provides in law for the protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property and consumer protection. On paragraph e, one cannot predict future circumstances.  That is why we again feel the best approach is to deal with the matter case by case through the judicial process.  Many rights are involved in this paragraph such as the right to copyright and to intellectual property in general.  The first matter to be considered is to establish if there is an infringement.  If lawful content is also included, the right of making available by the owner of the lawful content has to be considered.  The rights of the citizen, consumer and end-user in freedom of expression and freedom to receive or impart information must also be taken into account.  The right to data protection must come into the mix on the point made by the Technical Group.  The right of the Internet service provider, ISP, to conduct a business and all that it entails must also be upheld. For the purposes of clarity, the Technical Group submitted an alternative statutory instrument, and I am addressing specific points in it. On paragraphs f and g of the Technical Group's submission concerning injunctions, these matters are already within the discretion of the court.  EU law has held any measures must be fair and proportionate and not excessively costly.  Yet again, given the varying circumstances that could arise, we feel a case-by-case analysis and the balancing of rights and consideration of all matters by judicial process is the proper forum for such decisions. On Deputy Keating's point about publicising this, I want to reiterate we had an open consultation on it.  I stated on the record I was available to meet anybody.  I have sent out three communications to all Deputies, across all parties, and Senators on this issue so far.  I have engaged with the media in as open a fashion as possible.  I am willing to talk to people and am making myself available to the Internet community to talk to it on this. On Deputy Buttimer's point about the implications of this amendment, I reiterate this is about balancing the rights of Internet users, Internet businesses and the copyright holder.  The ISPs, as I outlined earlier, are the mere conduit, the mechanism through which information flows.  They act responsibly, as do individual websites, and in the majority of cases do not overtly seek to facilitate copyright theft.  A solution to the problem might be voluntary agreements in place between copyright holders and individual ISPs, hosters and caching companies. I do not believe we are doing the bidding of big business because there are as many - a multitude of - small Irish copyright holders on this island who have the right to certain protections which are not superior to the other rights I have outlined prior to this.
4252	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	367	 I thank Deputies for a considered and thoughtful debate.  Our key belief is that we cannot trample on the rights of individual citizens or businesses.  We are trying to uphold that belief and all we are doing with this amending legislation is ensuring we are on the right side of EU law.  Copyright is a principle to which this State adheres but I reiterate it is not a superior right for the purposes of this statutory instrument. I disagree with Deputy Donnelly's contention.  The mechanism by which www.boards.ie operates is such that if members do anything untoward, a take down notice can be issued to the website.  I am sure www.boards.ie complies with take down notices where illegal activities or defamatory comments are suspected.  Why would that threaten its core business?
4253	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	369	 I listened to the Deputy.  People speak about the cost of defence.  Just because one applies for an injunction, the judge will not necessarily grant it.  We must have regard for the rights of individual companies to conduct their business and for citizens to express themselves freely.  Nobody is trampling on those rights.  This statutory instrument restates a position which we already held prior to the Charleton judgment. It is important that all the stakeholders sit down with each other to chart a strategy on how this space will operate in the future.  In the context of the disparate nature of the users and businesses that operate in this space, it is incumbent on us to chart a way forward.  I would be delighted to make myself available to facilitate that process.  As recently as this morning, there was engagement with the Internet community through the Irish Internet Association as one of the stakeholders.  We are open to that discussion.
4254	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	371	 In regard to signing the statutory instrument, I have addressed the issues raised by the Technical Group.  I have already stated that it is our intention to proceed with the statutory instrument.  The State has been exposed on this issue, which has been ongoing since November 2010, and what we are doing is a proportionate response.  We will not infringe on anybody's right to conduct a business or to free expression through the Internet.
4255	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	375	 In regard to the alternative statutory instrument proposed by T.J. McIntyre, I have debated the issue with him in public media and I am not averse to engaging with the digital rights community with a view to hammering out a strategy.  However, we have to implement the statutory implement and we are doing so on foot of advice from two Attorneys General.  I have to take account of the sound advice given by an Attorney General.  This legislative measure is being introduced on foot of the legal advice my Department has obtained.  The Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for advice on the implications of the High Court judgment and it has advised that the obligation set out in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rights holders must be given a mechanism to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  The Attorney General's office advised separately that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance.  That is merely what we are doing.
4256	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	377	 I thank all who contributed to this debate and reassure citizens that this State and successive governments have invested heavily in new technologies related to the web and communications.

I respectfully suggest they should defer to their legal advisers.  I will also defer to their legal advisers on this so that we can have a strategic conversation about how the future of the web operates in the State, but we are not changing the wording of the statutory instrument.
4259	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	383	 I remind Deputy Donnelly that I have stated that on numerous occasions, with all due respect.

4261	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	657	 Some background information may be useful in appreciating the context of the proposed legislative instrument.  The EU provided in the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC for exemptions from liability for copyright infringement for intermediary service providers in cases of mere conduit, caching and hosting, upon certain conditions.  This was to provide a framework for the development of e-commerce and telecommunication industries. Although such providers are thus free from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC (as allowed for in the e-Commerce Directive) provides that rights holders must be in a position to apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. A High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, for a member of the European Union, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has been decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment. In granting such injunctions the Courts must take account of various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, on 24 November 2011, clearly laid out these principles that will guide all national courts in future (Case C-70/10-SABAM). These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.
4262	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	658	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 291 together. In relation to the scenario the Deputy has outlined, it is important to mention that copyright holders will not have power to compel the intermediary as stated.  The copyright owner will have the right to apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary in respect of works in which he holds the copyright. The proposed Statutory Instrument allows for the possibility of applying for an injunction only in respect of a particular works.  This would have to be considered by a court in its deliberations on the granting of an injunction against an intermediary.  Furthermore, all remedies contemplated must be proportionate, as required by the Copyright Directive, and take into account the various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.  It is important to note that following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies to the court when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, including: Protection of personal data,  Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and right to property. It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It is not a matter of believing or suspecting piracy or simply hosting copyright material. It must be shown that the services in question are used to infringe copyright. The legislation proposed is a restatement of the situation that was thought to pertain prior to the EMI & ors v UPC judgment in October 2010.  It is required in order to clarify Ireland's compliance with Art 8(3) of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.
4263	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	659	 An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law. Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works.  Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process.  This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a Treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business. It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.

4264	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	662	 A consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument. More than 50 submissions were received.  Some were from rights holders such as songwriters, authors and their representatives.  Others were from telecom companies and businesses that carry out intermediary activities on the internet and still more were from bodies concerned with freedom of expression and data protection issues. I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  Legal advice, which was received with some submissions, was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.  Following this, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion and advice of the Attorney General, it is felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI & ors v UPC case.

4268	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	671	 The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, ACTA, to which the Deputy is referring, is an international legal framework to more effectively combat the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods.  As you are aware, counterfeiting and piracy are now serious problems which undermine legitimate trade and the sustainable development of the world economy.  The growth of this illegal trade has led the ACTA participants to agree to develop an instrument that will strengthen international co-operation regarding this serious development. ACTA is an agreement about the enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights.  It does not oblige any of its EU signatories to create new substantive rights or to change existing ones.  It only commits its EU signatories to ensure that the right holders can fully assert their rights if, when and where they exist.  The ACTA provisions are compatible with existing EU law.  Therefore, it will not require any revisions or adaptation of EU law and will not require any Member States to review the measures or instruments by which they implement relevant EU law. My Department has consulted the relevant Departments affected by ACTA and the Office of the Attorney General to ascertain compliance of Irish legislation with the provisions of ACTA.  It is not expected that there will be a need to amend current Irish legislation.  However, before ratifying ACTA, my Department will again confirm with all relevant Departments of State and with the Office of the Attorney General,that all legislative and administrative requirements are in place to enable Ireland to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. The Directorate General for Trade organised a stakeholder consultation exercise in both 2009 and 2010.  My Department, through advertisements on its website invited interested stakeholders to take part on both occasions. For the 2010 exercise, details regarding the stakeholder consultation exercise were also advertised on the Patent's Office website.  In addition, my Department wrote to a wide range of stakeholders to invite them to take part in the exercise.  My Department has also provided information regarding ACTA on its website, including the final text of the Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the EU and its Member States cannot conclude the Agreement without the consent of the European Parliament.  The Parliament's International Trade Committee is reviewing the Agreement, and is expected to make a decision on whether to approve it in April or May. A final plenary vote is tentatively scheduled for June.
4269	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	answer	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	672	 I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 297 together. As the Deputy is aware the judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI & ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.

This is necessary to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EU Copyright Directive.  It is for this reason that a legislative instrument is proposed. I wish to state that no policy change is proposed in the Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the High Court judgment in EMI Ireland & others versus UPC.    Accordingly, the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument has been framed in a manner which merely gives effect to the wording of the EU Copyright Directive (i.e. Article 8(3) of 2001/29/EC) rather than extending its scope beyond that of intermediaries. The intended purpose of the proposed Statutory Instrument is not to enact new EU legislation but rather it seeks to merely restate the position that was thought to exist in the Copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton's judgment here and in all EU Member States.  Accordingly, the introduction of this measure by way of Statutory Instrument is not inconsistent with the legislative policy outlined in the Programme for Government.

This was to provide a framework for the development of e-commerce and telecommunication industries.  Although such providers are thus free from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC (as allowed for in the e-Commerce Directive) provides that rights holders must be in a position to apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. The High Court judgment (in the case of EMI & ors v UPC) held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  My Department had considered that injunctions were available under Section 40(4) of the Copyright Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment. A High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, for a member of the European Union, non-compliance with EU law is a serious matter.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has been decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment. It is expected that this measure will be introduced shortly.
4271	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	674	 An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  A public consultation in relation to the content of a draft legislative measure in this regard was held.  This received wide publicity at the time.  In addition to a web-based consultation and liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Assoc of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Ltd, Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Ltd, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, IDA, IMIR, International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Provides Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone, and X-tra Vision.  Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.
4272	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	675	" As the Deputy is aware the judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI & ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  A public consultation process seeking comments from interested parties on the content of a proposed legislative amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act, by means of a Statutory Instrument, was conducted over last June and July.  More than 50 submissions were received and these submissions were afforded careful consideration. In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Assoc of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Ltd, Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Ltd, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, IDA, IMIR, International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Provides Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone, and Xtra Vision.  Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.  The submissions and input from all those concerned has been carefully considered and has proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved including the relevant issues raised from the perspective of companies operating within this jurisdiction. It is important to note that no policy change is proposed in the Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the High Court judgment in EMI Ireland & others versus UPC.  The legislation proposed is a restatement of the situation that was thought to pertain prior to this judgment. Going back to 22 December, 2002, the date by which every EU Member State had to have implemented Directive 2001/29/EC, every EU country has had to ""ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right"".  Having that provision enshrined in EU law and the laws of Member States for a decade has not restricted the development of the Internet or innovative internet companies.  On the contrary, the Internet has flourished."
4273	SeanSherlock	Labour	14300.0	Cork East	speech	unknown-language	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Prelude	676	 The judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI & ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  Following a public consultation process which was conducted by my Department, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion of the Attorney General, it was felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI & ors v UPC case.  This is necessary to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EU Copyright Directive. This Directive and the Court of Justice of the European Union require that all remedies must be proportionate and that the right of freedom of expression and the right to conduct a business must be balanced with the right to intellectual property in considering the granting of an injunction.  The Deputy will be aware that since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must apply when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter which include: Protection of personal data, Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and the right to property. I wish to inform the Deputy that the proposed Statutory Instrument provides that the owner of the copyright in a work may, in respect of that work, apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary to whom paragraph 3 of Article 8 of Directive 2001/29/EC applies.  The right of appeal in respect of any injunction granted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed Statutory Instrument would lie to the Supreme Court.
