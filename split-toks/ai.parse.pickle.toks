for
attend

they
have
yield
much
information
in
they
presentation
and
pose
many
question
,
particularly
relate
to
child
protection
and
preventative
element
relate
to
child
sexual
abuse
imagery
.
what
more
can
parent
do
to
protect
child
from
become
vulnerable
to
that
macabre
world
of
child
sexual
abuse
?
most
child
live
in
protect
,
loving
home
where
there
be
a
element
of
vigilance
by
parent
,
but
many
child
globally
do
not
have
such
privilege
.
what
more
can
government
or
state
agency
do
to
intervene
and
to
protect
?
be
the
law
currently
robust
enough
?
be
there
glaring
ignorance
-
a
term
which
I
do
not
use
pejoratively
-
about
the
so
-
call
dark
web
among
policymaker
like
ourselves
with
regard
to
what
the
dark
web
actually
be
?
much
of
this
activity
allegedly
take
place
there
.
it
be
something
that
most
parent
and
citizen
have
no
concept
of
.
perhaps
more
education
be
need
.
might
I
get
a
answer
to
that
question
first
and
then
,
with
the
chairman
's
indulgence
,
ask
one
or
two
more
?
if
the
ISPAI
which
Ms
Niculescu
represent
be
aware
of
it
,
while
the
State
respond
through
legislation
and
try
to
deploy
resource
,
and
if
one
look
at
the
innovation
cycle
and
the
ability
to
bypass
protocol
,
be
there
a
sense
in
which
the
ISPAI
's
member
have
a
responsibility
to
police
this
activity
?
if
Internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
or
other
provider
be
the
conduit
for
this
type
of
content
,
should
they
police
it
and
ensure
that
content
be
not
available
or
be
block
?
I
be
be
a
bit
controversial
in
say
that
because
I
understand
the
role
of
the
conduit
.
there
be
a
sense
where
many
parent
or
anybody
else
with
a
sense
of
decency
who
have
a
interest
in
this
issue
would
ask
the
question
of
why
the
content
be
not
block
.
why
do
search
provider
such
as
Google
or
Yahoo
!
not
just
block
they
?
I
know
it
be
a
very
simplistic
question
but
perhaps
it
warrant
a
answer
.
would
block
remove
it
?
why
not
remove
it
then
?
so
the
ISPAI
be
effectively
build
a
file
?
for
a
criminal
case
?
I
have
two
final
question
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
she
reply
because
it
be
extremely
informative
.
I
appreciate
she
response
.
in
respect
of
the
professional
Development
Service
for
teacher
,
PDST
,
and
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
,
what
be
the
budget
for
Webwise
?
how
much
of
the
budget
be
allocate
to
this
endeavour
?
be
that
€
740000
per
annum
or
for
the
project
?
over
how
many
year
will
the
programme
run
?
on
the
pdst
,
how
many
teacher
have
take
up
continue
professional
development
in
respect
of
webwise
and
Internet
safety
awareness
?
be
this
content
include
in
the
mainstream
social
,
personal
,
health
and
education
,
sphe
,
curriculum
?
be
it
a
de
facto
part
of
it
?
be
it
compulsory
for
student
or
be
it
undertake
by
choice
?
can
school
principal
or
teacher
say
that
they
have
a
interest
in
this
area
,
that
they
want
to
take
it
on
board
and
that
they
will
go
for
the
CPD
and
teach
they
pupil
about
the
content
?
be
the
witness
say
it
be
not
compulsory
and
that
it
be
not
part
of
the
mainstream
curriculum
?
I
appreciate
that
.
it
be
not
a
de
facto
part
of
the
SPHE
curriculum
,
however
.
if
one
talk
about
,
for
example
,
student
safety
,
it
be
very
much
down
to
whether
a
teacher
decide
to
inculcate
this
programme
within
he
or
she
sphe
pedagogy
or
content
.
if
a
school
or
a
individual
teacher
do
not
want
to
subsume
this
into
its
curriculum
,
it
do
not
necessarily
have
to
do
so
.
should
we
think
about
make
this
a
compulsory
part
of
the
curriculum
?
that
be
the
key
question
.
while
that
be
a
matter
for
government
and
policymaker
,
I
be
sure
there
be
a
provision
within
the
Department
to
have
a
discussion
about
bring
this
into
the
mainstream
and
about
every
teacher
teach
the
SPHE
curriculum
have
to
include
this
.
it
be
a
good
idea
.

I
thank
the
assistant
commissioner
and
he
colleague
for
attend
today
.
how
many
gardaí
work
in
the
Garda
national
protective
service
bureau
?
how
many
gardaí
work
in
the
online
child
exploitation
unit
?
that
be
three
people
in
total
.
what
be
the
total
number
,
include
civilian
?
that
bring
it
up
to
78
.
how
many
people
work
in
the
Garda
national
cybercrime
bureau
?
I
ask
Mr.
Daly
to
repeat
that
number
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
the
overall
number
.
for
the
pilot
programme
in
New
Ross
and
Ballincollig
,
be
they
extrapolate
from
the
number
Mr.
Gubbin
have
outline
?
how
many
be
in
Ballincollig
and
New
Ross
?
that
be
three
.
I
want
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
resourcing
.
the
number
be
quite
finite
.
give
the
scale
of
the
challenge
it
could
be
argue
that
the
number
be
quite
small
.
what
be
the
business
case
be
make
for
additional
resource
?
be
such
a
business
case
be
make
?
I
appreciate
that
point
.
I
be
try
to
ascertain
what
the
numeric
strength
be
and
I
recognise
that
other
resource
be
deploy
as
need
.
will
Mr.
O'Driscoll
give
I
a
perspective
on
how
the
relationship
with
Internet
service
provider
,
ISP
,
of
Ireland
work
with
regard
to
a
notice
and
take
-
down
procedure
?
the
hotline
,
as
I
understand
it
,
will
serve
a
isp
with
a
notice
of
removal
or
take
-
down
.
Mr.
O'Driscoll
refer
to
a
block
mechanism
.
maybe
this
be
a
false
analogy
,
but
it
be
a
bit
like
when
I
block
somebody
who
be
abusive
to
I
on
social
media
,
such
as
Twitter
of
Facebook
,
it
do
not
necessarily
stop
the
activity
.
how
be
the
activity
investigate
?
it
be
one
thing
to
block
it
,
but
how
be
it
stop
and
investigate
?
how
do
gardaí
investigate
,
since
they
jurisdiction
be
the
Republic
of
Ireland
and
the
crime
may
be
transnational
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
investigation
and
how
be
crime
investigate
subsequently
?
be
it
merely
a
blocking
mechanism
or
be
it
subsequently
report
to
other
jurisdiction
?
for
that
instance
that
happen
in
Ireland
,
specifically
,
how
many
investigation
be
under
way
at
present
and
how
many
case
be
before
the
court
for
this
type
of
activity
?
how
many
site
be
host
in
Ireland
?
can
Mr.
Daly
say
if
it
be
in
fives
or
ten
?
how
many
case
come
before
the
court
?
the
witness
make
a
statement
on
the
Communication
(
retention
of
data
)
Act
.
there
be
a
specific
section
in
they
statement
,
"
however
,
if
internet
provider
fail
to
provide
the
Garda
Síochána
with
datum
pursuant
to
the
Communication
(
retention
of
data
)
act
2011
,
we
ability
to
identify
people
involved
in
the
sexual
exploitation
of
child
or
the
distribution
of
child
pornography
on
the
internet
will
be
restrict
"
.
be
there
a
lacuna
in
the
law
relate
to
this
?
have
there
be
incidence
where
isp
have
refuse
to
yield
information
?
I
be
try
to
get
a
close
interpretation
of
that
statement
.
we
would
all
acknowledge
that
the
work
of
the
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
and
hotline
be
laudable
and
proactive
.
there
be
mobile
telephony
and
internet
service
provider
.
the
witness
make
a
very
pertinent
point
about
how
technology
have
move
on
.
a
phone
be
no
long
merely
a
phone
but
it
be
also
a
computer
.
do
the
Communication
(
retention
of
data
)
act
as
it
relate
to
this
subject
matter
pertain
to
mobile
telephony
too
with
regard
to
the
retention
of
datum
?
my
point
,
to
be
helpful
,
be
that
it
would
be
very
good
to
have
a
perspective
in
order
for
this
committee
to
make
determination
and
recommendation
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
attend
the
meeting
today
.
this
be
a
insightful
discussion
and
it
build
a
deep
understanding
for
member
of
the
committee
.
I
wish
to
get
a
sense
of
the
nature
of
the
collaboration
.
there
be
the
ISPAI
,
the
Garda
,
CyberSafeIreland
,
the
Office
for
Internet
Safety
and
so
forth
.
there
be
myriad
organisation
.
what
level
of
collaboration
take
place
?
there
be
a
finite
number
of
actor
in
the
field
but
what
level
of
real
collaboration
be
there
at
present
?
perhaps
the
representative
of
CyberSafeIreland
will
respond
to
that
first
.
do
the
witness
have
a
genuine
critique
of
the
system
as
it
exist
?
I
be
glad
the
witness
mention
Webwise
because
I
intend
to
ask
about
the
office
's
relationship
with
same
.
the
witness
speak
a
great
deal
about
education
and
continue
professional
development
,
CPD
,
in
school
for
teacher
.
there
be
a
conflict
in
my
mind
around
this
.
I
be
a
parent
.
be
there
a
onus
on
the
parent
to
have
the
primary
responsibility
in
respect
of
educate
he
or
she
child
about
Internet
safety
?
to
say
that
I
have
mental
blockage
about
use
the
technology
and
so
forth
be
not
really
sufficient
in
this
day
and
age
.
a
parent
teach
he
or
she
child
the
safe
cross
code
,
road
safety
and
all
sort
of
other
safety
mechanism
.
I
have
a
perception
,
and
the
witness
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
that
sometimes
parent
will
say
that
it
be
the
role
of
the
school
through
the
professional
Development
Service
for
teacher
,
PDST
,
Webwise
and
so
forth
to
educate
they
child
on
internet
safety
.
Webwise
do
not
necessarily
reach
every
school
and
not
every
teacher
have
take
up
the
CPD
.
Representative
of
Webwise
have
appear
before
the
committee
.
if
the
CPD
be
not
inculcate
within
the
teaching
and
academic
institution
as
a
core
subject
,
it
be
likely
that
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
slippage
in
this
regard
.
what
be
the
witness
's
perspective
on
that
?
I
believe
every
teacher
should
be
equip
compulsorily
,
but
how
do
we
marry
the
role
of
the
teacher
with
the
role
of
the
parent
?
I
be
sorry
if
I
be
a
little
long
-
winded
but
the
witness
understand
what
I
be
say
.
there
be
a
role
for
school
.
the
school
be
probably
the
primary
institution
with
which
parent
will
interact
in
respect
of
they
child
up
to
the
age
of
18
year
.
we
be
talk
about
distil
this
down
and
create
a
platform
nationally
whereby
parent
voluntarily
interact
with
school
and
the
programme
be
deliver
through
that
.
Parent
go
to
parent
-
teacher
meeting
.
there
be
no
reason
that
on
one
night
per
year
there
could
not
be
outreach
programme
,
for
example
,
for
every
school
in
the
country
.
it
would
only
require
two
or
three
hour
.
Parent
would
interact
with
each
other
thereafter
and
natural
collaboration
would
begin
to
build
up
through
parent
interact
with
each
other
.
if
it
be
to
be
distil
down
to
community
level
,
it
would
not
take
a
massive
amount
of
resource
or
money
to
do
that
.
I
hope
Ms
Cooney
will
forgive
I
for
cut
across
she
but
time
be
limited
.
the
one
thing
I
have
note
be
that
teacher
need
access
to
material
.
Ms
Cooney
be
,
in
effect
,
say
that
it
be
not
only
about
access
to
material
but
about
the
confidence
to
be
able
to
-----
-----
have
the
pedagogical
skill
and
understand
the
content
in
order
to
deliver
it
.
that
be
certainly
a
issue
which
this
committee
could
take
forward
.
I
be
very
conscious
that
the
Chairman
have
to
progress
the
agenda
.
I
want
to
speak
very
specifically
about
the
research
component
of
this
issue
.
this
be
straightforward
question
.
be
funding
line
available
through
the
Irish
Research
Council
for
the
area
the
witness
have
speak
about
?
there
be
no
bespoke
funding
line
.
be
there
any
funding
line
from
industry
?
for
instance
,
be
there
any
funding
from
the
body
represent
by
the
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
,
which
be
a
global
body
,
or
from
any
of
the
top
global
Internet
-
base
company
,
nine
out
of
the
top
10
of
which
have
facility
in
Ireland
?
have
Dr.
Brennan
,
or
anyone
from
the
academic
side
,
approach
this
company
and
tell
they
that
they
need
to
start
cut
check
?
forgive
I
if
I
mix
up
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
.
it
be
okay
to
do
a
kind
of
surface
mapping
of
Whatsapp
,
but
to
drill
down
one
need
proper
quantitative
analysis
of
what
exactly
be
happen
in
this
field
.
good
research
lead
to
good
policy
.
have
the
government
make
any
funding
available
in
this
space
through
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
?
it
seem
to
I
that
for
small
amount
of
money
-
a
grant
of
€
10000
here
,
a
€
50000
grant
there
-
a
very
solid
research
platform
could
be
create
within
the
academic
field
,
where
there
be
collaboration
between
ucc
,
DIT
and
so
on
.
if
that
be
map
,
could
the
witness
drop
the
committee
a
line
on
where
the
research
landscape
be
at
the
moment
?
will
Ms
Cooney
provide
the
committee
with
a
copy
of
that
research
?
if
I
understand
correctly
,
of
the
€3.9
million
which
be
available
for
funding
under
the
EU
Connecting
Europe
facility
,
CEF
,
programme
-----
what
be
the
Office
of
Internet
Safety
's
budget
line
at
the
moment
?
how
much
be
in
the
kitty
?
it
be
just
for
staffing
.
the
body
be
the
National
Parent
Council
,
the
Irish
Society
for
the
Prevention
of
Cruelty
to
Children
,
professional
Development
Service
for
teacher
-----
this
be
the
point
.
I
will
make
one
final
point
and
then
I
be
finish
.
we
have
a
disparate
system
but
everyone
be
work
with
the
same
aim
in
mind
.
there
might
be
a
role
for
this
committee
in
try
to
map
the
system
.
if
we
can
simply
map
what
be
happen
throughout
the
Irish
landscape
,
we
can
begin
to
work
on
solution
and
outcome
.

I
be
hope
that
the
witness
would
come
before
we
today
with
a
very
clear
,
metric
-
drive
response
to
each
of
the
point
which
be
raise
in
the
HIQA
report
.
this
point
be
address
in
quite
general
term
in
the
witness
's
statement
,
but
I
be
hope
that
we
would
be
able
to
go
through
the
six
standard
with
which
there
be
moderate
non-compliance
,
for
instance
,
and
that
the
witness
would
lay
out
a
very
clear
timeline
as
to
what
action
be
be
take
to
address
that
non-compliance
and
when
they
would
be
complete
.
I
would
also
like
the
witness
to
address
the
two
standard
with
which
there
be
major
non-compliance
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
witness
can
come
back
to
we
with
a
very
clear
,
definitive
action
plan
as
to
when
that
action
will
be
complete
.
I
will
start
with
something
which
be
a
little
bit
outside
of
what
have
go
before
.
there
be
a
major
incident
on
the
campus
in
August
2016
.
there
be
a
fire
.
the
date
of
the
announce
inspection
in
the
HIQA
report
range
from
27
March
to
30
March
.
in
that
report
it
be
state
that
there
be
moderate
non-compliance
in
respect
of
standard
9
-
premise
,
safety
and
security
.
for
instance
,
"
staff
be
find
to
have
inconsistent
response
with
regard
to
the
procedure
to
be
follow
in
the
event
of

.
"
the
report
identify
that
door
be
of

,
in

of

standard
,
"
Appropriate

in
compliance
with
the
appropriate
standard
.
"
notwithstanding
the
positivity
of
what
the
witness
have
present
to
the
committee
regard
deconstruction
of
some
of
the
cultural
,
staff
and
managerial
practice
and
the
fact
that
they
be
engage
in
a
process
to
try
to
rectify
many
of
this
issue
,
by
any
fair
analysis
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
if
there
be
a
fire
in
August
2016
and
in
March
2017
,
a
good
number
of
month
late
,
HIQA
be
still
identify
deficiency
in
respect
of
something
as
simple
as
fire
safety
.
that
be
the
first
point
the
witness
might
address
.
the
second
point
relate
to
the
recent
high
court
judgment
against
Oberstown
in
which
the
judge
clearly
state
that
there
be
a
limited
breach
-
and
I
emphasise
the
word
"
limited
"
-
of
constitutional
rights
in
respect
of
deprivation
of
physical
exercise
;
loss
of
contact
with
family
;
lack
of
procedural
safeguard
relate
to
the
imposition
of
separate
and
associate
deprivation
,
particularly
the
formal
write
recording
of
decision
;
and
regard
imposition
of
the
separation
regime
.
as
I
understand
it
,
and
I
would
like
the
witness
's
perspective
,
this
case
be
take
by
four
people
.
it
relate
to
a
specific
incident
or
incident
which
take
place
in
August
2016
.
be
Oberstown
Children
Detention
Campus
still
breach
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizen
-
child
and
young
adult
-
in
respect
of
separation
and
associate
deprivation
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
formal
write
recording
of
decision
?
be
it
still
breach
this
rights
or
have
it
rectify
the
matter
in
the
intervene
period
?
I
be
not
a
lawyer
,
but
the
HIQA
report
of
March
2017
would
clearly
suggest
that
there
be
major
non-compliance
in
respect
of
standard
2
and
that
"
some
child
spend
long
period
of
time
in
single
separation
and
the
reason
for
this
be
not
always
clearly
record
.
"
I
suggest
that
,
notwithstand
the
positivity
in
the
witness
's
embrace
of
cultural
and
managerial
change
in
a
real
and
meaningful
way
,
the
witness
still
have
not
deal
with
this
issue
satisfactorily
.
this
be
simple
issue
which
can
be
deal
with
without
expenditure
of
major
resource
and
within
a
short
timeframe
.
when
will
the
witness
satisfy
the
committee
,
the
minister
,
and
the
user
and
staff
of
this
service
that
this
will
be
rectify
?
for
the
record
,
in
respect
of
the
witness
be
cautious
in
they
response
,
the
high
court
judgment
be
a
matter
of
public
record
.
be
the
witness
say
the
issue
have
be
address
?
the
principle
be
simple
.
I
thank
Mr.
Bergin
.
I
be
happy
to
help
Mr.
Bergin
to
understand
where
I
be
come
from
.
how
many
review
of
Oberstown
have
be
carry
out
over
the
year
?
how
many
review
have
there
be
in
the
past
five
year
,
for
example
?
I
will
accept
a
approximate
figure
.
I
apologise
for
interrupt
.
I
ask
a
very
specific
question
.
how
many
review
have
take
place
?
okay
.
that
have
be
over
a
period
of
a
year
.
I
would
say
that
by
any
operational
standard
,
if
five
review
be
carry
out
internally
or
externally
it
would
set
off
some
kind
of
signal
or
alarm
to
the
effect
that
action
need
to
be
take
in
a
short
timeframe
.
I
have
a
final
question
.
be
the
management
structure
flat
or
hierarchical
?
be
there
any
comparable
management
structure
in
the
public
sector
?
do
it
mirror
the
structure
in
the
Prison
Service
,
the
Civil
Service
or
the
public
service
?
be
it
the
case
that
there
be
a
director
and
a
deputy
director
with
a
management
team
underneath
they
?
Mr.
Bergin
do
not
answer
deputy
Neville
's
question
about
the
number
of
agency
staff
.
what
be
the
turnover
of
staff
?
okay
.
I
would
like
to
ask
about
the
culture
in
Oberstown
.
yes
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
he
forbearance
.
I
be
very
grateful
.
can
a
individual
employee
feel
comfortable
in
address
a
issue
that
he
or
she
might
have
directly
to
Mr.
Bergin
,
or
be
there
a
line
of
command
through
which
such
a
person
have
to
go
?
okay
.
that
might
seem
obvious
,
but
it
be
a
very
important
point
for
we
in
term
of
we
understanding
.

Professor
Goldson
and
Hardwick
be
reference
in
the
report
.
how
do
what
they
be
do
and
what
HIQA
do
differ
?
they
purpose
,
accord
to
the
report
,
be
to
evaluate
practice
and
policy
in
line
with
international
standard
and
good
practice
,
to
identify
obstacle
or
barrier
to
achieve
great
implementation
of
international
standard
and
good
practice
and
to
make
recommendation
to
ensure
great
and
more
successful
implementation
of
this
standard
.
be
that
not
what
HIQA
do
?
the
committee
have
have
some
consideration
of
that
issue
at
hand
,
because
it
be
the
one
piece
we
have
not
have
the
opportunity
to
interrogate
although
,
as
Ms
Dunnion
note
,
we
have
sight
of
the
recommendation
.
notwithstanding
that
,
I
want
to
understand
HIQA
's
point
of
view
and
if
she
be
comfortable
now
with
the
cultural
and
procedural
change
and
the
improvement
that
have
be
articulate
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
the
chief
executive
.
they
have
make
a
submission
to
this
committee
and
I
be
pretty
sure
that
Ms
Dunnion
have
have
sight
of
that
submission
.
be
there
anything
in
that
submission
that
have
be
state
previously
that
she
would
critique
in
any
way
?
on
the
single
separation
issue
,
which
I
think
HIQA
adjudicate
on
the
fact
that
it
be
not
consistently
adhere
to
by
staff
or
management
.
obviously
there
be
a
process
under
way
where
that
be
be
monitor
.
what
methodology
do
HIQA
use
?
do
it
involve
inspector
go
in
and
talk
to
staff
,
inspect
the
physical
facility
and
so
on
?
how
do
it
actually
work
?
what
criterion
do
HIQA
apply
?
presumably
,
it
will
use
good
international
practice
.
what
be
good
international
practice
for
the
purpose
of
the
HIQA
inspection
?
HIQA
refer
to
how
the
authorisation
for
the
approval
of
the
use
of
single
separation
and
the
extension
to
the
time
spend
in
single
separation
be
not
always
complete
by
manager
in
line
with
policy
.
one
can
overcome
that
by
document
,
time
keeping
and
so
on
,
but
one
must
see
the
justification
in
the
first
instance
for
single
separation
.
as
HIQA
obviously
have
regard
to
good
international
practice
,
can
Ms
Boyle
enlighten
we
as
to
what
good
international
practice
be
?
the
measure
of
success
for
that
who
read
the
report
and
examine
the
Oberstown
campus
will
be
evidence
of
cultural
change
.
I
perceive
that
cultural
change
be
take
place
in
Oberstown
and
that
it
be
move
towards
a
more
positive
disposition
with
regard
to
tackle
this
issue
from
a
staffing
point
of
view
.
I
also
perceive
that
internal
communication
have
dramatically
improve
.
be
my
perception
correct
?
I
do
not
necessarily
expect
Ms
Boyle
to
comment
on
my
conclude
remark
.
if
there
be
real
time
improvement
across
all
the
HIQA
standard
,
it
will
be
necessary
for
member
to
see
a
copy
of
the
Goldson
and
Hardwick
report
.
it
be
not
enough
that
we
have
the
recommendation
without
see
what
be
in
the
body
of
the
report
.
while
I
understand
that
legal
issue
may
arise
in
respect
of
the
report
,
if
the
improvement
be
take
place
in
real
time
,
I
do
not
see
any
reason
the
committee
cannot
have
regard
to
the
report
.
we
need
to
have
a
great
interrogation
of
the
Goldson
and
Hardwick
report
.
that
may
not
be
the
correct
name
but
that
be
the
name
of
the
report
's
author
.
we
need
to
see
what
be
in
the
report
because
it
be
a
missing
piece
of
the
jigsaw
.
I
have
no
further
question
and
I
thank
Ms
Boyle
for
she
time
.
I
thank
the

Dr.
Muldoon
's
report
present
some
sober
reading
for
member
.
with
a
certain
degree
of
collective
responsibility
in
mind
,
it
be
perhaps
a
indictment
of
how
the
political
system
engage
vis-à
-
vis
protect
the
rights
of
child
in
this
State
.
my
head
be
slightly
hang
down
on
this
one
because
there
be
a
certain
sense
of
embarrassment
or
shame
that
the
political
system
have
not
prioritise
the
care
of
we
child
within
the
State
to
the
extent
that
it
should
.
as
a
member
of
the
Dáil
for
ten
year
at
this
stage
,
I
also
consider
myself
partly
responsible
for
that
to
a
certain
extent
.
as
a
individual
and
a
new
member
to
this
committee
,
care
of
child
have
not
be
in
the
top
echelon
of
political
priority
.
I
say
that
in
a
honest
and
open
fashion
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
I
wish
to
speak
to
Molly
's
case
.
I
be
startle
that
there
be
471
child
with
severe
disability
who
be
in
foster
care
,
in
de
facto
State
care
,
who
need
additional
support
but
who
be
fight
for
that
additional
support
.
I
be
aware
of
one
case
in
my
own
area
.
do
Molly
have
a
care
plan
?
my
understanding
be
that
every
child
should
now
have
a
care
plan
and
that
care
plan
should
be
follow
up
upon
.
if
Molly
do
have
a
care
plan
,
why
be
that
not
act
upon
?
whose
responsibility
be
that
?
the
irony
of
this
be
that
the
person
represent
the
agency
that
be
suppose
to
provide
and
enact
the
care
plan
be
so
frustrated
that
she
give
advice
to
Molly
's
foster
mother
.
I
be
delighted
that
Ms
McKenna
-
Keane
be
use
the
term
"
foster
mother
"
because
she
be
care
for
she
since
the
age
of
four
month
.
I
be
make
a
kind
of
aside
here
but
we
do
not
see
they
as
integral
to
the
care
of
the
child
in
question
.
they
be
always
live
in
the
fear
that
the
child
could
be
take
from
they
at
any
point
.
the
key
point
here
be
there
be
a
care
plan
in
place
but
the
resource
do
not
follow
the
care
plan
.
it
be
the
key
point
in
Molly
's
case
.
there
be
471
child
.
in
the
short
time
I
have
,
I
be
try
to
drill
down
into
whether
the
471
child
speak
of
in
the
report
be
now
in
the
same
position
as
Molly
,
with
the
same
risk
profile
pertain
to
that
child
.
I
would
like
some
forbearance
.
there
be
no
guardian
ad
litem
in
this
instance
.
be
it
not
the
case
that
there
be
a
serious
flaw
in
the
system
,
where
child
with
severe
disability
not
the
subject
of
court
case
and
availing
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
scenario
be
already
at
a
disadvantage
relative
to
other
child
in
foster
care
who
be
the
subject
of
court
case
?
the
case
must
now
be
make
that
every
child
with
a
disability
-
whether
it
be
a
severe
,
moderate
or
intellectual
disability
-
in
foster
care
should
have
a
guardian
ad
litem
to
advocate
independently
and
ensure
that
agency
,
include
Tusla
and
the
HSE
,
will
deliver
on
that
rights
.
be
this
down
to
a
turf
war
between
two
agency
?
it
be
a
turf
war
and
the

I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
the
committee
today
.
we
be
involved
in
the
process
of
examine
this
issue
.
very
often
we
hear
voice
from
academia
and
industry
but
the
most
important
voice
of
all
be
that
of
the
witness
.
what
they
have
do
today
be
to
articulate
a
clear
vision
of
what
they
want
to
achieve
,
and
they
have
do
so
with
such
clarity
that
I
want
to
get
copy
of
they
submission
.
they
have
distil
the
issue
with
such
clarity
that
it
have
give
I
,
as
a
member
of
the
committee
,
a
clear
sense
of
what
we
need
to
achieve
now
.
I
express
we
gratitude
to
the
witness
.
I
have
a
few
question
arise
from
the
submission
.
my
first
question
be
for
Ms
Reynold
on
the
role
of
parent
.
we
be
try
hard
to
grapple
with
where
parent
come
into
the
equation
.
do
the
witness
think
the
vast
majority
of
parent
have
the
confidence
to
monitor
,
as
Ms
Reynold
say
,
the
activity
of
they
child
online
so
they
can
make
the
Internet
safe
for
they
child
?
how
would
this
be
do
?
if
I
ask
Ms
Reynold
to
design
a
workshop
or
programme
to
educate
or
help
parent
would
she
do
it
in
the
school
community
or
in
the
sport
community
?
if
I
give
she
€
1
million
to
design
a
programme
for
the
country
,
what
would
be
she
vision
and
how
would
she
do
it
?
would
it
be
do
during
school
time
or
out
of
school
time
?
Parent
be
look
for
programme
they
can
grab
onto
in
they
community
so
they
can
educate
themselves
.
Mr.
Burke
speak
about
peer
to
peer
programme
and
young
people
teach
young
people
but
there
be
a
big
gap
in
adult
's
mind
on
this
issue
.
will
Ms
Reynold
give
I
a
sense
of
this
?
it
might
help
in
the
devising
of
scheme
here
also
.
do
the
other
witness
have
a
perspective
on
this
?
I
be
not
a
technophobe
but
I
be
not
a
technophile
either
.
probably
like
most
people
,
I
be
somewhere
in
the
middle
.
one
do
not
necessarily
have
to
fully
understand
the
technology
to
be
able
to
use
it
.
I
be
a
early
adopter
of
technology
but
I
be
probably
in
the
minority
.
the
majority
of
people
do
not
feel
confident
about
try
to
reach
in
and
understand
what
they
child
be
do
.
where
be
Comhairle
to
nÓg
on
this
?
it
have
its
charter
.
how
do
we
implement
the
charter
?
how
do
we
get
it
to
a
point
where
every
citizen
in
the
country
,
young
and
old
,
have
a
sense
we
be
design
a
safe
place
for
people
to
inhabit
when
they
use
the
Internet
?
how
do
we
get
there
?
get
the
programme
up
and
run
,
start
the
learning
and
replicate
they
throughout
the
country
.
my
next
question
require
short
answer
.
do
the
witness
believe
there
be
a
cut
-
off
point
with
regard
to
child
and
young
adult
?
smartphone
have
be
speak
about
quite
a
bit
recently
,
and
people
be
say
child
under
the
age
of
12
or
16
should
not
have
access
to
a
smartphone
.
what
be
the
view
of
the
witness
on
this
?
Ms
Muireann
Whelan
want
to
answer
it
.
Ms
Whelan
be
state
parental
responsibility
be
key
to
all
of
this
and
there
be
a
onus
on
parent
.
the
relationship
and
sexuality
education
,
rse
,
module
have
be
mention
.
we
have
have
some
engagement
with
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
with
parent
about
the
role
of
teacher
.
what
I
be
pick
up
from
the
witness
be
that
it
depend
on
what
school
someone
go
to
.
some
teacher
be
very
confident
with
technology
and
some
be
not
.
should
we
start
roll
out
programme
at
undergraduate
level
for
teacher
in
training
so
they
do
a
compulsory
module
on
Internet
safety
?
they
would
then
be
able
to
roll
out
programme
in
they
class
through
rse
and
other
programme
.
good
luck
with
that
.

this
evidence
be
mind

blow
.
there
be
so
much
that
be
in
what
the
witness
have
say
that
I
be
find
it
hard
to
internalise
it
in
live
stream
,
so
to
speak
.
it
be
devastatingly
pertinent
and
,
thankfully
,
there
be
a
language
relate
to
it
that
be
coherent
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
that
because
this
be
what
we
,
as
legislator
,
really
need
to
hear
.
we
be
get
down
to
the
nub
of
the
matter
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
to
the
data
Protection
Bill
.
Professor
O'Sullivan
refer
to
section
29
,
which
act
coterminously
to
article
8
of
the
regulation
.
we
have
have
before
the
committee
entity
that
represent
the
rights
of
child
state
with
goodwill
and
solid
bona
fide
that
the
digital
age
of
consent
should
be
retain
or
legislate
for
at
13
.
Professor
O'Sullivan
make
the
point
that
there
be
a
distinction
to
be
make
between
the
article
and
the
legislation
.
in
other
word
-
and
this
be
what
I
want
clarification
on
-
be
he
say
that
the
article
be
not
about
a
child
's
general
capacity
to
enter
into
a
contract
?
indeed
.
that
be
where
I
need
clarity
.
I
have
research
this
matter
and
discover
that
under
the
law
of
contract
in
Irish
common
law
which
have
not
be
update
or
consolidate
recently
,
a
minor
do
not
have
full
capacity
to
contract
.
I
shall
quote
the
antiquated
language
use
in
the
law
of
contract
in
Irish
common
law
.
it
state
:
where
necessary
be
sell
and
deliver
to
a
minor
he
must
pay
a
reasonable
price
for
they
.
necessary
in
this
section
be
define
as
mean
''
goods
suitable
to
the
condition
in
life
of
[
a
minor
]
...
and
to
he
actual
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
sale
and
delivery
"
.
if
this
aspect
of
the
law
be
leave
in
place
and
not
amend
,
it
seem
possible
that
a
minor
will
have
the
capacity
,
at
13
year
,
to
consent
to
the
processing
of
he
or
she
personal
datum
but
will
not
have
the
capacity
to
enter
into
the
substantive
contract
in
question
on
the
grounds
that
it
be
not
one
for
necessary
.
in
other
word
,
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
13
year
would
put
we
offside
in
we
own
common
law
system
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
excellent
information
.
do
I
hear
they
correctly
when
they
say
-
I
shall
paraphrase
-
that
when
a
parent
sign
a
contract
to
buy
a
phone
and
give
it
to
he
or
she
13
-
year
-
old
,
14
-
year
-
old
,
15
-
year
-
old
or
16
-
year
old
and
image
of
a
adult
nature
be
share
between
boy
and
girl
,
girl
and

,
etc.
it
constitute
-----
what
do
that
constitute
?
be
the
future
dystopian
or
be
it
hopeful
?
on
UK
legislation
and
the
point
in
the
witness
's
submission
,
the
UK
amendment
refer
to
high
privacy
setting
be
switch
on
by
default
.
I
need
a
explanation
as
to
how
that
would
work
in
practical
term
.
Ireland
be
one
of
the
most
innovative
country
in
the
world
and
nine
out
of
the
top
ten
"
bear
on
the
Internet
"
company
be
here
.
they
European
,
Middle
East
and
Asian
,
EMEA
,
headquarters
be
operate
out
of
Dublin
.
we
have
the
Insight
Centre
,
a
Science
Foundation
Ireland
-
fund
body
.
we
be
invest
significantly
in
big
datum
analytic
.
the
innovation
the
witness
be
talk
about
to
crack
that
code
could
be
do
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
we
have
the
scientific
personnel
and
the
excellence
in
science
to
be
able
to
do
it
.
I
want
to
get
the
witness
's
perspective
on
the
fear
I
have
.
the
top
company
I
refer
to
have
commercial
sensitivity
and
be
look
for
market
share
.
my
fear
be
that
if
one
try
to
legislate
for
or
create
the
innovation
to
block
and
filter
access
,
Mr.
Facebook
,
ceo
,
or
Ms
Facebook
,
ceo
,
and
other
may
ring
the
Taoiseach
to
say
they
do
not
like
what
we
be
do
in
Ireland
where
they
have
make
a
solid
commitment
to
they
investment
.
the
threat
of
pull
out
could
be
use
to
push
back
.
that
be
a
fair
point
but
it
be
a
consideration
I
put
to
the
witness
.
I
will
have
to
draw
proceedings

a

I
will
do
a
rapid
-
fire
question
-
and
-
answer
session
within
my
five
minute
.
I
thank
the
Internet
Content
Governance
Advisory
Group
for
appear
before
the
committee
today
.
the
presence
of
the
group
reaffirm
the
work
do
previously
by
the
group
.
it
refresh
we
memory
with
regard
to
the
30
recommendation
make
by
the
group
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
recommendation
,
especially
with
regard
to
the
office
of
the
digital
safety
commissioner
.
what
be
the
understanding
of
the
group
representative
at
present
of
the
nature
of
that
office
and
how
it
should
be
constitute
?
my
second
question
relate
to
what
Professor
O'Neill
say
about
the
digital
age
of
consent
.
we
take
part
in
lengthy
deliberation
last
week
with
Dr.
Mary
Aiken
,
who
be
also
a
member
of
the
Internet
Content
Governance
Advisory
Group
and
Professor
Barry
O'Sullivan
.
they
be
advocate
for
the
age
to
be
16
year
.
they
make
compelling
argument
for
the
age
to
be
increase
from
13
year
to
16
year
.
can
Professor
O'Neill
enlighten
we
with
he
understanding
of
the
interpretation
of
the
EU
regulation
as
it
relate
to
the
distinction
between
internet
freedom
and
a
13
-
year
-
old
child
yield
all
personal
datum
to
a
website
,
social
media
site
or
whatever
?
can
Professor
O'Neill
understand
that
some
of
we
be
fearful
of
keep
it
at
13
year
and
not
increase
it
to
16
year
?
we
fear
that
if
a
child
at
the
age
of
13
year
be
yield
all
this
information
to
a
unknown
entity
,
then
that
information
can
be
use
for
all
manner
of
nefarious
reason
.
it
be
possibly
the
case
that
we
misunderstand
what
be
in
the
regulation
.
I
be
keen
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
group
representative
.
I
will
focus
the
question
towards
Mr.
Lupton
.
we
have
to
be
specific
-----
I
have
a
final
question
.
may
I
please
-----
in
support
of
the
other
speaker
-----
-----
may
I
ask
that
we
not
hear
a
intervention
from
Professor
O'Neill
at
this
stage
?
I
be
ask
the
committee
to
move
to
the
other
speaker
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
law
of
contract
as
it
relate
to
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
law
of
contract
as
it
relate
to
the
gdpr
and
this
regulation
.
in
other
word
,
be
the
13
-
year
old
enter
into
a
contract
for
the
procurement
of
service
and
do
the
law
of
the
land
not
supersede
that
law
,
in
effect
?
could
Mr.
Lupton
give
the
short
answer
?
in
other
word
,
the
law
of
the
land
could
supersede
it
if
it
be
put
to
the
test
,
the
age
of
consent
be
13
.
I
sincerely
thank
the
minister
for
appear
before
the
committee
today
.
which
of
the
minister
present
will
have
responsibility
for
the
digital
safety
commissioner
when
that
office
be
establish
?
we
need
a
clear
unambiguous
answer
to
that
question
.
the
internet
content
governance
advisory
group
be
constitute
in
2013
.
one
of
its
recommendation
be
that
there
would
be
a
specific
senior
or
junior
minister
responsible
.
we
need
to
find
out
who
have
political
responsibility
for
online
safety
.
my
second
question
be
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
Assistant
Garda
Commissioner
O'Driscoll
,
and
Mr.
Declan
Daly
appear
before
the
committee
in
October
.
they
tell
we
that
few
than
100
Garda
personnel
be
involved
in
the
Garda
national
protective
service
bureau
and
under
that
the
online
child
exploitation
unit
.
they
give
we
clear
figure
on
the
number
of
personnel
,
but
it
amount
to
few
than
100
people
,
if
civilian
be
include
.
if
we
be
talk
about
cybercrime
and
the
protection
of
child
and
minor
,
we
need
to
well
resource
the
Garda
national
protective
service
bureau
.
have
additional
number
there
would
go
a
long
way
to
the
cause
of
protect
child
effectively
.
we
be
all
disgusted
by
the
Horan
case
.
the
initial
inquiry
on
that
case
come
from
a
American
intervention
on
a
Gmail
account
.
that
set
off
a
chain
of
event
in
the
investigation
.
have
that
email
not
come
from
the
authority
in
America
or
have
there
not
be
a
intervention
on
that
,
the
Horan
case
might
not
have
come
to
light
.
I
speak
about
resource
specifically
in
that
case
.
I
know
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
a
very
strong
advocate
of
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
.
we
be
all
very
supportive
of
the
STEM
initiative
in
the
junior
and
senior
cycle
and
the
short
course
in
the
junior
cycle
.
some
parent
argue
that
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
school
to
look
after
online
safety
-
to
teach
the
child
or
young
adult
well
so
to
speak
.
insufficient
resource
be
allocate
to
the
professional
development
service
for
teacher
,
pdst
.
we
need
more
resource
for
pdst
because
the
translational
effect
be
not
happen
in
every
school
and
we
need
to
reach
beyond
post
primary
and
right
down
into
primary
level
.
we
need
to
educate
teacher
and
make
they
online
safety
advocate
.
we
should
appoint
a
online
safety
advocate
in
every
school
or
region
so
that
they
can
deploy
a
lot
of
this
resource
in
teaching
across
region
.
as
it
be
a
technological
issue
,
I
would
start
with
the
minister
for
Communication
,
climate
action
and
environment
,
deputy
Naughten
.
be
that
still
a
live
report
?
be
the
minister
say
the
digital
safety
commissioner
will
not
come
under
he
Department
's
remit
?
we
need
guidance
as
to
where
that
will
sit
.
I
also
ask
a
supplementary
question
on
that
issue
.
perhaps
the
minister
may
------
I
thank
the
chair
.
in
term
of
the
EU
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
GDPR
,
on
the
age
of
consent
,
section
29
of
the
data
Protection
Bill
2018
provide
that
,
"
the
age
of
a
child
specify
for
the
purpose
of
article
8
be
13
year
of
age
.
"
article
8
itself
say
that
,
in
relation
to
the
offer
of
information
society
service
directly
to
a
child
,
the
processing
of
the
personal
datum
of
a
child
shall
be
lawful
where
the
child
be
at
least
16
year
old
.
it
also
state
that
member
state
by
law
can
provide
for
a
low
age
,
not
below
13
.
processing
the
datum
of
a
child
below
that
age
be
lawful
only
if
and
to
the
extent
that
consent
be
give
or
authorise
by
the
holder
of
parental
responsibility
over
the
child
.
follow
on
from
Senator
Freeman
's
question
,
how
do
the
common
law
of
contract
apply
to
the
minister
's
propose
legislation
?
in
other
word
,
as
I
understand
it
,
under
Irish
common
law
,
which
have
not
be
update
for
a
long
time
,
a
minor
do
not
have
full
capacity
to
contract
.
that
be
my
understanding
.
in
the
circumstance
in
which
the
minister
be
devise
legislation
,
it
seem
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
to
give
consent
for
the
minor
to
enter
into
a
contract
to
yield
onto
the
relevant
service
provider
whatever
service
it
happen
to
be
,
personal
detail
and
enter
into
a
contract
.
be
there
a
distinction
to
be
make
here
between
where
a
transaction
take
place
or
do
not
take
place
?
do
the
law
supersede
the
new
legislation
,
or
do
the
new
legislation
supersede
the
law
of
the
land
as
it
relate
to
contract
?
I
hope
that
make
sense
.
I
would
like
to
contribute
on
the
same
point
?
with
the
Minister
's
forbearance
,
may
I
ask
a
final
question
for
clarification
purpose
?
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
not
mind
.
could
you
give
I
ten
second
?
it
be
just
ten
second
.
I
beg
you
indulgence
.
initially
,
I
ask
about
the
age
of
consent
and
the
issuing
of
enter
a
contract
.
the
new
article
be
not
about
a
child
's
general
capacity
to
enter
into
a
contract
but
it
be
about
a
child
's
capacity
to
consent
to
the
processing
of
personal
datum
.
the
minister
have
answer
that
but
I
want
full
and
final
clarification
because
it
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
either
13
or
16
.
I
be
scared
that
if
the
age
be
13
,
one
might
be
enter
into
a
contract
to
give
up
all
one
's
datum
to
a
entity
.
that
be
why
I
remain
to
be
convince
,
along
with
this
committee
,
on
the
matter
.
it
be
a
general
point
.

I
be
very
impressed
by
the
submission
because
it
get
to
the
nub
of
the
issue
and
provide
a
set
of
recommendation
that
be
easily
digestible
for
generalist
such
as
ourselves
.
I
welcome
the
submission
that
have
be
provide
here
today
.
I
tend
to
ask
rapid
-
fire
question
,
if
I
may
.
the
W82GO
!
team
be
a
multidisciplinary
one
.
how
many
multidisciplinary
team
be
in
this
country
?
be
the
W82GO
!
team
the
only
one
?
why
have
the
team
not
be
replicate
throughout
the
region
?
why
must
a
child
who
present
in
Cork
,
Kerry
or
Limerick
travel
to
Temple
Street
Children
's
University
Hospital
in
Dublin
?
if
I
understand
what
have
be
say
correctly
as
a
layman
,
be
it
appropriate
that
severe
case
be
refer
to
the
centre
of
excellence
in
Temple
Street
Children
's
University
Hospital
?
yes
.
as
a
former
minister
of
State
who
have
responsibility
for
research
,
I
note
the
team
have
clinical
lead
and
I
seek
to
understand
both
the
resourcing
and
the
research
element
in
this
regard
.
the
W82GO
!
multidisciplinary
team
receive
funding
from
the
Temple
Street
Foundation
and
the
HSE
.
have
peer
-
review
research
paper
and
output
be
produce
?
obviously
the
research
be
peer
review
as
Ms
Sheridan
have
nod
she
head
.
I
seek
a
insight
into
what
be
happen
on
the
research
side
.
the
HRB
.
yes
.
I
be
happy
to
hear
from
other
people
on
this
matter
.
research
be
a
particular
area
of
interest
for
I
because
I
know
that
strong
peer
-
review
research
lead
to
successful
outcome
.
it
have
be
state
that
as
many
as
145000
child
attend
the
hospital
every
year
and
the
team
have
extrapolate
a
figure
of
4000
.
be
I
correct
?
yes
.
be
I
correct
to
say
that
there
be
4000
attendance
in
the
year
2014
to
2018
,
inclusive
?
it
have
also
be
state
that
49
%
of
patient
in
2017
be
aged
under
ten
year
.
be
the
unit
conduct
live
research
into
the
type
of
child
who
attend
in
term
of
demographic
,
background
and
the
psychosocial
element
?
do
all
of
that
form
part
of
the
research
?
there
be
short
,
medium
and
long
-
term
effect
.
I
note
that
the
unit
be
part
of
Growing
up
in
Ireland
,
the
national
longitudinal
study
of
child
.
have
the
research
and
study
have
a
bear
on
the
issue
?
fundamentally
,
this
committee
want
to
find
way
to
stamp
out
obesity
.
what
tool
be
need
to
tackle
the
problem
?
to
I
,
research
be
one
element
.
obviously
resource
be
require
to
be
invest
in
the
clinical
area
.
if
I
have
read
the
situation
correctly
,
there
be
not
enough
clinician
work
in
the
sector
as
it
be
relatively
new
.
what
can
we
do
about
that
aspect
?
I
want
to
discuss
the
statement
that
family
with
financial
challenge
be
more
likely
to
be
prone
to
obesity
and
40
%
of
the
child
who
attend
the
unit
come
from
seriously
deprive
background
.
how
do
that
fact
present
themselves
?
I
be
open
to
hear
about
this
matter
from
other
witness
too
.
be
that
element
the
exception
or
the
norm
?
how
can
we
disrupt
that
dynamic
and
improve
thing
?
person
have
call
for
safe
play
environment
for
child
.
yes
.
Ms
Sheridan
be
advocate
a
common
-
sense
approach
.
as
a
layperson
,
I
will
ask
whether
the
witness
think
the
solution
be
as
simple
as
get
child
to
become
active
.
yes
.
there
be
a
psychological
aspect
too
.
yes
.
I
have
one
last
question
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
he
indulgence
.
let
we
say
the
witness
be
give
a
magic
wand
tomorrow
that
grant
they
all
of
the
resource
they
need
.
what
would
the
development
of
a
implementation
plan
and
evaluation
framework
for
the
provision
of
service
to
child
and
adolescent
with
clinical
obesity
throughout
Ireland
look
like
in
real
term
?
would
it
be
a
case
of
stage
what
Dr.
O'Malley
be
do
and
scaling
it
out
to
the
region
or
would
it
be
a
question
of
add
more
layer
of
resource
to
what
she
be
do
with
she
team
?
can
I
take
it
from
Dr.
O'Malley
's
request
for
increase
funding
that
there
a
shortage
of
funding
?
will
Dr.
O'Malley
explain
why
endocrinology
will
be
need
?
how
many
bariatric
procedure
have
be
carry
out
?
be
people
lose
they
life
as
a
result
of
not
have
bariatric
procedure
?
do
Dr.
O'Malley
have
figure
for
the
number
of
people
who
have
die
?
that
be
a
very
interesting
discussion
.
the
witness
's
presence
and
answer
to
we
question
have
be
very
much
appreciate
.

three

overweight
and
6
%
be
obese
and
that
50
%
of
obese
child

adolescent
.
how
do
we
disrupt
the
behaviour

what
happen
to
the

50
%

do
not
become
obese
?
where

?
this

be
to

anything
that
disrupt
behaviour
.
both
programme
before
we
,
food
Dudes

behavioural
change
.
how

create
government

give
effect
to
disrupt
behaviour
in
a
positive
way
?
I
be
go
to
come
to
that
.
my
next
question
be
go
to
be
about
the
zero
to
three
-
year
age
category
.
Dr.
McCrory
speak
about
breastfeeding
and
it
be
a
disrupter
of
obesity
in
kid
.
will
he
give
I
some
sense
of
how
we
can
disrupt
behaviour
at
a
much
early
age
?
some
54
%
of
parent
of
overweight
child
and
20
%
of
parent
of
obese
child
in
the
Growing
Up
in
Ireland
cohort
report
that
they
be
about
the
right
weight
for
they
height
.
will
Dr.
McCrory
help
we
to
understand
how
it
be
possible
to
get
into
that
house
?
he
make
a
specific
reference
to
low
socio-economic
group
have
a
great
propensity
towards
obesity
.
if
child
have
already
be
involve
in
a
early
childhood
scheme
,
a
crèche
and
primary
and
post
-
primary
education
,
how
do
we
talk
to
or
educate
the
parent
?
be
we
talk
about
public
health
nurse
have
a
role
or
direct
intervention
in
primary
healthcare
service
?
be
we
talk
about
resource
such
intervention
to
a
great
extent
or
carry
out
study
to
a
great
extent
?
where
do
the
intervention
take
place
to
disrupt
behaviour
in
the
zero
to
three
-
year
age
cohort
?
the
metric
Dr.
McCrory
have
show
we
create
a
picture
that
be
-
I
be
not
say
it
be
dystopian
-
negative
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
longitudinal
societal
scenario
,
for
want
of
a
good
expression
,
the
future
do
not
look
too
bright
.
be
Dr.
McCrory
suggest
we
have
more
public
health
nurse
at
the
very
early
intervention
stage
and
that
they
role
be
expand
?
we
all
know
what
they
do
at
the
early
childhood
stage
,
but
be
we
talk
about
great
public
intervention
and
develop
a
cohort
of
public
health
nurse
who
would
deal
specifically
with
try
to
disrupt
that
pattern
?
do
that
make
sense
?
Dr.
McCrory
be
in
Trinity
College
Dublin
,
as
be
Professor
David
Hevey
.
have
Dr.
McCrory
speak
to
he
about
the
Laya
Healthcare
research
?
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
a
great
believer
in
break
down
silo
.
we
can
see
the
effect
of
the
research
when
we
look
at
the
translational
element
of
the
Laya
Healthcare
and
Super
Trooper
programme
.
the
metric
for
the
satisfaction
level
under
the
Super
Trooper
programme
probably
somewhere
map
the
GUI
longitudinal
study
.
when
we
,
as
a
society
,
start
break
down
silo
and
get
two
eminent
researcher
such
as
Dr.
McCrory
and
Professor
Hevey
to
work
across
platform
such
as
psychology
and
health
,
perhaps
we
might
start
to
see
the
programme
have
a
great
translational
effect
.
I
thank
Dr.
McCrory
for
he
interaction
.
I
have
be
read
the
Super
Trooper
handbook
which
be
mightily
impressive
.
I
have
a
little
fellow
at
home
who
be
almost
ten
month
of
age
and
look
forward
to
engage
in
the
animal
antic
,
do
the
scissors
jump
,
the
pasta
dance
,
the
magic
number
and
take
part
in
the
ball
alley
and
potato
race
.
it
be
about
create
something
that
be
about
fun
and
subtle
behavioural
change
.
it
be
very
positive
.
the
statistic
for
take
-
up
rate
by
school
speak
for
themselves
.
there
be
330
primary
school
in
the
pilot
project
;
there
be
now
1500
school
,
with
238000
child
.
if
we
,
as
policymaker
,
can
do
anything
to
help
to
have
it
fully
translate
into
all
school
,
I
ask
Dr.
McCrory
to
please
contact
we
.
it
be
a
very
worthy
programme
.
perhaps
we
might
kick
the
tyre
a
little
more
on
the
research
Professor
Hevey
have
conduct
and
then
bring
it
back
to
the
government
and
especially
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
I
would
love
to
see
body
such
as
Science
Foundation
Ireland
put
more
funding
into
this
space
to
see
if
we
can
really
disrupt
the
trajectory
towards
obesity
.
I
do
not
need
to
tell
Laya
Healthcare
how
much
it
be
cost
by
way
of
intervention
every
year
.
we
all
pay
we
subscription
to
the
Layas
and
VHIs
of
this
world
.
we
premia
be
increase
and
this
be
obviously
because
we
have
community
rating
and
we
be
fund
more
and
more
health
intervention
for
probably
preventable
disease
.
therefore
,
anything
we
as
policymaker
can
do
that
,
in
the
long
term
,
support
such
initiative
as
Super
Trooper
,
we
absolutely
must
do
.
the
one
question
I
have
be
where
this
need
to
go
.
if
the
witness
have
one
ask
of
government
as
to
the
next
step
,
what
would
it
be
?
they
mention
resource
early
.
be
they
satisfied
they
have
the
resource
to
take
this
a
step
further
?
what
would
be
they
wish
list
if
they
have
the
Minister
for
Health
or
the
Taoiseach
here
,
for
instance
?
Mr.
O'Connor
can
answer
the
question
after
Ms
O'Reilly
.
what
be
the
ballpark
cost
?
have
Mr.
O'Connor
do
some
figure
as
to
how
much
it
would
cost
to
take
the
programme
to
the
full
rate
of
penetration
of
all
school
?
a
€3
million
headline
overall
budget
.
to
be
fair
,
that
be
not
a
massive
-----
perhaps
I
can
make
a
practical
suggestion
that
we
as
a
committee
write
to
either
the
Minister
for
Health
about
it
or
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
with
responsibility
for
health
promotion
.
perhaps
we
could
also
write
to
the
Taoiseach
directly
to
see
if
there
be
any
way
we
could
either
meet
with
he
or
facilitate
some
meeting
between
the
stakeholder
here
and
the
Taoiseach
,
with
a
view
to
see
how
we
can
translate
a
programme
such
as
this
right
across
the
school
and
whether
there
be
anything
we
can
do
to
assist
the
programme
.
for
health
promotion
.
and
the
Taoiseach
.
on
that
point
,
Ms
O'Reilly
refer
to
the
active
flag
and
the
fact
that
Super
Trooper
be
a
stakeholder
in
that
regard
.
we
have
all
visit
school
as
deputy
and
Senator
where
there
have
be
the
raising
of
a
green
flag
,
and
one
need
only
see
how
that
behavioural
change
be
have
a
effect
translate
into
the
home
.
I
have
not
see
the
evidence
of
this
yet
in
respect
of
the
active
flag
.
that
be
not
to
say
it
do
not
exist
;
I
just
have
not
see
any
research
.
if
we
be
talk
about
positive
public
health
policy
,
obviously
there
would
have
to
be
some
more
tyre
-
kick
regard
the
research
the
witness
have
conduct
.
however
,
I
do
not
see
any
reason
that
could
not
be
do
.
if
we
be
serious
about
tackle
obesity
,
it
will
require
the
deployment
of
resource
,
and
if
there
be
programme
that
one
can
just
take
on
or
partner
with
,
that
be
the
model
we
must
use
because
there
be
a
evidence
base
here
of
it
have
a
effect
.
this
be
why
I
would
love
Dr.
McCrory
to
talk
to
Professor
Hevey
.
perhaps
that
can
be
facilitate
because
that
be
the
space
we
need
to
be
in
.
the
different
side
be
quite
complementary
,
I
would
argue
,
and
they
be
both
within
the
same
organisation
.
if
there
be
a
way
of
talk
to
one
another
to
see
how
we
can
work
on
this
one
and
come
up
with
practical
solution
,
we
should
try
to
do
so
.

do
Mr.
Elliot
mean
in
the
context
of
safeguard
?
yes
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
he
generosity
.
I
do
not
know
where
to
start
because
I
be
flabbergasted
at
some
of
the
evidence
that
have
be
present
to
we
.
I
want
to
gain
a
deep
understanding
of
the
distinction
between
governance
and
safeguard
issue
.
there
will
be
some
repetition
in
the
delegate
's
answer
.
Mr.
Ian
Elliott
have
be
appoint
to
look
at
a
sample
of
between
500
and
600
case
in
which
safeguard
issue
arise
,
date
back
to
2003
.
be
that
correct
?
there
be
a
box
of
file
on
all
of
the
case
somewhere
within
the
bowel
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
be
that
what
the
delegate
be
tell
we
?
we
be
talk
about
paper
file
.
the
Garda
,
Tusla
and
all
of
the
relevant
agency
-----
the
ceo
have
be
in
office
since
2012
.
have
he
be
involved
in
any
of
the
safeguard
case
since
he
appointment
?
that
be
not
what
I
be
ask
about
.
my
question
be
specific
.
have
the
ceo
be
involve
directly
between
both
party
-
the
complainant
and
the
person
against
whom
the
complaint
have
be
make
?
therefore
,
Dr.
Lawlor
have
be
directly
involved
in
specific
case
as
ceo
.
in
normal
circumstance
be
it
appropriate
for
the
ceo
to
be
directly
involve
in
safeguard
case
?
yes
.
I
be
look
for
help
to
understand
this
issue
.
it
be
probably
awkward
to
ask
Mr.
Elliot
the
question
when
the
ceo
be
sit
beside
he
,
but
the
ceo
have
bring
in
Mr.
Elliot
to
do
a
job
and
I
will
proceed
on
that
basis
.
there
be
a
number
of
sample
case
on
file
during
the
tenure
of
the
ceo
and
Mr.
Elliot
be
go
through
a
internal
process
,
albeit
with
a
external
consultant
.
I
have
deal
with
he
in
the
past
on
the
Cloyne
report
.
historically
,
we
have
have
much
engagement
on
the
national
board
for
safeguard
child
in
the
Catholic
Church
.
have
it
not
be
for
he
,
the
Cloyne
report
would
never
have
see
the
light
of
day
.
we
do
a
great
deal
of
work
on
it
and
I
appreciate
the
work
he
have
do
in
safeguard
child
.
however
,
I
have
a
difficulty
in
understand
why
,
for
instance
,
if
a
investigation
be
ongoing
into
a
sample
number
of
file
during
the
ceo
's
tenure
,
the
board
and
the
ceo
have
not
step
aside
from
the
process
and
the
investigation
have
not
become
a
fully
external
process
on
the
basis
that
there
be
considerable
taxpayer
funding
at
play
and
there
be
a
massive
disparity
between
the
ordinary
experience
of
the
leader
of
a
scout
troop
and
the
child
and
that
who
operate
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
organisation
.
this
speak
to
the
issue
of
governance
to
which
I
will
come
shortly
.
should
the
entire
board
and
leadership
step
aside
while
the
process
be
ongoing
and
should
somebody
else
step
in
to
act
as
a
honest
broker
in
order
that
everybody
can
have
confidence
in
the
process
?
that
be
the
safeguarding
element
,
about
which
there
be
further
question
.
however
,
the
minister
suddenly
announce
the
appointment
of
Ms
Jillian
van
Turnhout
,
a
former
Oireachtas
Member
.
I
still
do
not
have
a
proper
understanding
of
what
she
role
will
be
.
she
be
the
minister
's
appointee
,
but
what
will
she
do
exactly
?
what
be
Mr.
Elliot
's
interpretation
of
she
role
in
this
process
?
be
it
Mr.
Burbridge
's
understanding
Ms
van
Turnhout
do
not
yet
have
a
sense
of
what
she
role
will
be
?
do
she
articulate
that
to
he
?
this
be
a
issue
because
,
as
a
committee
,
we
be
still
in
the
dark
.
last
week
in
the
Dáil
I
ask
a
question
about
Scouting
Ireland
,
but
I
be
still
none
the
wise
about
what
Ms
van
Turnhout
's
role
will
be
.
I
do
not
need
they
.
I
will
continue
with
my
question
.
I
appreciate
that
,
but
it
would
be
good
to
have
scout
Ireland
's
perspective
.
as
yet
,
there
have
be
no
articulation
of
or
contact
on
the
term
of
reference
and
how
the
investigation
,
whatever
it
will
entail
,
will
proceed
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
still
a
little
in
the
dark
in
that
sense
.
I
refer
again
to
the
issue
of
governance
.
reference
be
make
to
a
new
board
of
director
.
Dr.
Lawlor
be
subject
himself
to
a
internal
process
to
appoint
a
new
board
of
director
to
reflect
the
new
reality
in
which
he
find
himself
.
that
be
not
a
appropriate
way
in
which
to
proceed
and
he
should
subject
the
board
's
governance
procedure
to
a
external
review
,
whether
it
be
the
van
Turnhout
review
or
another
.
I
refer
to
the
public
,
individual
scout
leader
,
scout
,
cub
and
volunteer
,
in
particular
.
how
be
they
go
to
be
confident
,
if
they
be
not
fully
confident
at
present
,
that
the
new
board
of
director
have
clean
hand
and
will
result
in
a
new
culture
with
strong
and
more
robust
governance
procedure
?
I
have
question
about
whether
there
have
be
document
complaint
make
by
volunteer
-
this
be
adult
scout
leader
-
against
member
of
the
board
,
right
up
to
ceo
level
,
or
other
staff
,
or
whether
there
have
be
allegation
of
bullying
,
for
instance
.
have
report
be
commission
by
Scouting
Ireland
to
examine
complaint
and
the
mechanism
by
which
it
can
resolve
that
complaint
in
a
mediate
fashion
?
have
the
report
be
publish
and
have
they
be
provide
,
for
instance
,
to
all
party
involve
?
that
be
just
some
of
the
question
that
be
still
on
we
mind
,
which
have
not
be
present
to
we
here
as
representative
of
taxpayer
's
interest
in
relation
to
the
submission
today
.
we
do
not
know
if
there
be
any
legal
case
open
against
the
organisation
by
volunteer
for
allege
harassment
,
for
instance
.
if
we
be
talk
about
change
management
and
if
it
be
a
change
management
structure
from
within
and
the
board
be
hope
to
bring
all
of
this
people
with
it
,
I
suggest
that
it
do
not
necessarily
have
the
confidence
of
a
lot
of
people
in
the
organisation
on
the
ground
.
I
be
a
layman
in
this
regard
but
my
perception
be
that
what
the
board
be
try
to
do
be
to
give
effect
to
change
internally
and
try
to
manage
it
internally
use
the
same
people
and
the
same
resource
.
the
witness
do
not
have
to
answer
the
question
if
they
do
not
want
to
.
in
the
interest
of
transparency
,
it
be
in
everybody
's
interest
that
the
witness
be
as
forthcoming
as
possible
with
this
committee
because
the
answer
and
the
truth
will
out
ultimately
on
this
process
anyway
.
who
be
manage
that
process
?
Mr.
Burbridge
should
forgive
my
ignorance
,
but
he
be
honorary
vice
president
of
Scouting
Ireland
and
the
team
lead
on
this
crisis
and
he
be
also
manage
the
change
management
.
I
be
only
get
warm
up
.
I
appreciate
that
answer
because
at
least
it
give
I
some
knowledge
that
this
be
subject
to
some
sort
of
external
tyre
-
kick
,
if
one
want
to
call
it
that
.
what
the
volunteer
need
be
some
signalling
from
the
upper
echelon
that
change
management
be
go
on
because
they
be
floor
by
what
be
go
on
at
present
.
they
be
not
too
happy
at
the
fact
that
Scouting
Ireland
do
not
come
before
the
committee
soon
because
it
create
a
very
bad
perception
.
that
say
,
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
Scouting
Ireland
be
here
today
.
I
do
ask
whether
there
be
internal
report
on
complaint
.
be
there
internal
complaint
about
bullying
and
harassment
?
I
think
that
be
a
fair
question
.
it
can
be
answer
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
a
legal
impediment
to
it
be
answer
.
first
I
be
try
to
establish
whether
there
be
complaint
of
bullying
within
the
organisation
or
complaint
by
volunteer
or
individual
scout
leader
and
,
second
,
that
a
process
be
under
way
to
deal
with
they
in
a
robust
fashion
.
I
be
try
to
understand
the
process
.
could
I
ask
for
a
little
bit
of
indulgence
,
just
for
two
minute
?
deputy
Mitchell
have
nod
in
affirmation
of
my
request
.
I
appreciate
that
.
the
Chairman
take
a
fair
amount
of
time
himself
.
I
will
wrap
it
up
,
so
to
speak
.
be
there
live
case
of
bullying
and
harassment
?
do
Dr.
Lawlor
as
ceo
deal
directly
with
that
case
or
be
there
a
process
under
way
where
a
staff
member
deal
with
the
case
?
have
Dr.
Lawlor
deal
with
case
?

we
all
know
where
this
be
go
.
I
join
in
welcoming
Mr.
Regan
to
the
committee
today
.
we
have
hear
of
a
number
of
tremendous
and
positive
initiative
.
it
be
good
to
have
crystallisation
of
what
the
GAA
be
do
right
down
to
the
local
community
,
because
sometimes
we
think
of
the
GAA
in
binary
term
,
whether
hurl
or
football
,
camogie
or
handball
and
so
on
.
often
,
we
think
of
the
GAA
in
binary
term
and
in
a
intercounty
context
only
.
as
policymaker
we
might
not
fully
appreciate
what
happen
across
the
land
except
perhaps
through
the
prism
of
we
individual
club
.
give
that
we
be
good
parochial
people
,
I
be
keen
to
hear
more
about
the
fun
and
run
activity
.
my
club
in
Mallow
,
County
Cork
,
have
world
-
class
facility
.
we
have
a
multimillion
euro
facility
.
it
be
something
that
could
be
use
as
a
hub
for
the
Munster
region
for
outwork
in
that
regard
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
work
with
the
GAA
on
this
.
we
should
not
simply
look
at
the
facility
in
term
of
Mallow
but
from
the
Munster
or
regional
perspective
give
its
specific
location
.
perhaps
I
will
share
more
with
Mr.
Regan
on
that
afterwards
.
we
cannot
underestimate
the
metric
Mr.
Regan
have
give
we
today
.
the
key
metric
be
the
top
-
line
metric
,
which
be
a
total
of
142467
participant
in
the
Cúl
camp
.
it
be
the
big
child
sport
promotion
in
the
world
.
that
be
a
phenomenal
metric
for
what
be
a
indigenous
sport
when
we
look
at
it
in
global
term
.
we
should
be
shouting
that
metric
from
the
rooftop
.
it
be
testament
to
the
lateral
thinking
that
now
exist
within
the
GAA
.
the
GAA
see
itself
as
have
a
clear
social
function

itself
as

responsibility
to
its
community
right
down
to
the
neighbourhood
.
committee
member
be
delighted
to
hear
the
metric
in
the
context
of
we
deliberation
on
tackle
obesity
.
do
Mr.
Regan
believe
more
need
to
be
do
in
outreach
to
primary
school
?
be
some
primary
school
not
be
reach
?
be
the
ability
to
get
in
the
front
door
hamper
for
certain
reason
?
if
so
,
what
be
the
reason
?
excellent
.
I
have
another
question
on
primary
school
and
how
to
reach
a
penetration
rate
of
100
%
.
Mr.
Regan
state
that
the
GAA
be
willing
to
reach
out
into
other
area
.
he
refer
to
the
principle
of
get
basic
movement
,
how
the
GAA
do
not
claim
ownership
of
this
,
and
how
the
association
be
willing
to
work
with
other
.
the
committee
will
have
to
make
recommendation
.
if
Mr.
Regan
be
to
make
recommendation
,
be
there
anything
he
would
recommend
by
way
of
a
action
to
try
to
reach
a
100
%
penetration
rate
for
every
school
so
that
every
child
in
the
country
could
hit
that
target
?
my
last
question
be
more
of
a
shout
-
out
for
handball
.
it
be
a
minority
sport
.
we
have
produce
world
champion
in
handball
in
my
great
town
of
Mallow
and
have
invest
heavily
,
through
sport
capital
funding
,
in
retrofit
we
club
.
I
would
always
put
my
hand
up
for
have
handball
.
the
GAA
,
from
a
global
perspective
,
should
consider
that
sport
.
it
be
develop
slowly
but
it
could
develop
quickly
if
it
be
give
a
global
platform
.
I
would
welcome
if
handball
could
be
translate
into
the
work
Mr.
Regan
be
do
and
be
consider
in
some
of
this
initiative
,
particularly
with
respect
to
catching
,
throw
,
forward
movement
and
so
on
.
indeed
.
exactly
.
I
put
my
hand
up
for
handball
.
I
thank
Mr.
Regan
.
this
have
be
a
wonderful
contribution
to
we
discourse
on
obesity
.
I
must
give
Mr.
Regan
my
apology
.
I
have
to
go

I
have
to
ask
a
question
of
the
minister

hold
on
.
I

question
.
do
that
mean
all
senior

be
involved
in
ensure
there
be
absolute
capture
?
yesterday

how
can

reassure
when
Mr.

how

I
would
like
to
join
in
welcoming
all
the
witness
here
before
the
committee
today
.
they
submission
be
very
interesting
,
and
there
be
some
very
pragmatic
and
practical
recommendation
therein
.
they
be
base
on
common
sense
but
very
often
common
sense
be
not
apply
when
one
be
try
to
conduct
a
public
policy
and
a
set
of
outcome
that
have
a
beneficial
effect
for
the
general
population
.
we
all
have
a
instinctive
view
on
what
need
to
happen
,
but
then
how
be
that
translate
into
practical
policy
and
action
?
that
be
what
we
be
try
to
get
to
the
nub
of
here
in
this
committee
.
we
be
try
to
come
up
with
a
report
that
have
very
practical
suggestion
.
the
witness
's
recommendation
be
very
beneficial
to
that
process
.
before
I
question
anybody
,
I
want
to
congratulate
Mr.
John
Treacy
on
he
appointment
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
concern
.
it
be
a
very
welcome
appointment
,
which
I
think
we
would
all
wholeheartedly
welcome
.
on
the
Children
's
Sport
Participation
and
physical
activity
Study
of
2010
,
the
witness
have
openly
acknowledge
in
he
submission
that
it
now
need
to
be
update
and
make
fit
for
purpose
for
2018
,
2019
and
onwards
.
could
I
ask
if
the
effect
of
the
use
of
technology
be
map
onto
that
study
in
any
way
?
have
the
use
and
preponderance
of
technology
in
home
and
society
be
examine
?
the
reason
I
ask
be
we
be
hear
that
technology
have
a
massively
negative
impact
on
very
basic
activity
level
in
child
,
and
other
people
who
have
submit
to
this
process
here
have
say
that
.
be
that
part
of
the
study
?
who
own
that
study
?
be
Sport
Ireland
just
a
participant
?
where
be
the
academic
research
be
carry
out
?
that
be
fine
.
I
think
it
would
be
useful
for
we
-----
I
appreciate
that

two
hour
of
screen
time
seem
almost
nostalgic
by
today
's
standard
,
which
be
ironic
.
if
they
be
to
report
in
November
,
which
be
only
a
few
month
away
,
and
if
that
be
not
include
in
the
study
,
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
to
know
,
perhaps
through
Sport
Ireland
or
one
of
the
other
stakeholder
,
whether
the
use
of
technology
be
be
map
onto
that
type
of
longitudinal
study
.
it
would
be
useful
to
we
and
we
work
here
.
when
we
speak
about
obesity
in
Ireland
,
we
speak
about
target
low
socio-economic
group
.
I
often
wonder
how
that
happen
in
real
term
.
can
Mr.
Treacy
give
a
practical
example
of
a
local
sport
partnership
,
of
the
29
on
the
€
6
million
budget
line
,
where
there
be
a
clear
target
of
a
low
socio-economic
group
?
I
appreciate
that
.
if
some
clear
example
of
that
project
could
be
outline
to
the
committee
,
it
would
help
we
in
draft
we
report
.
perhaps
Dr.
May
could
outline
in
that
submission
how
this
could
be
replicate
across
a
number
of
different
area
.
we
need
practical
example
like
that
to
help
we
in
we
work
.
I
be
grateful
for
that

I

the

Nolan

at
the
outset
to
the
effect
that
we
almost
see
the
situation
as
"

and
insoluble
"
.
I
cannot
think
like
that
,
and
we
cannot
think
like
that
as
a
committee
.
I
have
to
be
optimistic
about
what
we
can
achieve
and
keep
drive
on
and
pursue
this
issue
.
I
do
not

I
welcome
the
minister
here
today
.
she
have
give
we
some
very
devastating
news
base
on
what
she
hear
late
last
night
.
we
hear
that
there
be
71
allege
abuser
historically
and
108
survivor
that
we
know
about
.
it
be
pertinent
for
we
to
empathise
with
the
fact
that
there
be
potentially
more
than
108
people
out
there
who
be
potentially
traumatise
by
they
experience
.
when
Mr.
Elliott
come
before
we
on
9
May
he
give
a
undertaking
that
he
would
look
at
the
historical
case
pre-2003
and
the
review
have
come
up
with
that
devastating
news
.
in
light
of
this
news
very
late
last
night
I
want
to
get
a
understanding
of
the
minister
's
interaction
with
the
new
board
in
term
of
how
she
and
the
Department
will
deal
with
it
.
be
it
the
case
that
all
bet
be
now
off
regard
future
funding
until
such
time
as
the
situation
be
clarify
and
rectify
?
notwithstanding
what
I
have
say
,
I
should
add
a
proviso
to
the
effect
that
99.9
%
of
that
involve
in
Scouting
Ireland
be
honest
,
decent
volunteer
who
be
do
a
excellent
job
and
will
be
devastate
by
the
news
.
they
will
be
traumatise
by
this
as
well
and
they
will
want
the
funding
to
continue
.
how
do
we
find
a
mechanism
to
ensure
that
scouting
continue
and
that
the
new
board
,
which
we
wish
well
and
which
have
be
give
a
clean
slate
,
can
operate
and
that
we
find
a
mechanism
to
deal
with
the
historical
issue
and
also
ensure
that
scouting
can
continue
safely
and
without
any
cloud
hang
over
it
?
the
minister
's
human
response
will
perhaps
give
some
solace
to
people
who
be
honest
and
decent
and
who
constitute
the
vast
majority
of
scouter
,
they
parent
and
friend
.
we
need
to
hear
from
she
on
how
it
be
intend
to
deal
with
the
issue
.
a
lot
of
we
focus
in
the
main
meeting
of
the
committee
be
on
the
barrister
's
report
on
the
allege
event
that
take
place
in
2009
.
this
new
information
be
shocking
.
I
be
viscerally
shocked
by
the
information
we
have
receive
today
.
I
want
to
get
clarity
in
my
own
mind
that
the
minister
be
satisfied
that
that
file
have
now
be
send
to
the
Garda
.
give
that
the
minister
only
receive
the
information
late
last
night
I
would
like
to
know
what
have
occur
,
procedurally
,
in
the
less
than
12
hour
or
so
since
she
have
be
in
receipt
of
the
information
.
I
be
sure
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
board
in
respect
of
its
handling
of
the
issue
but
I
wish
to
get
the
minister
's
perspective
.
if
the
minister
be
tell
we
there
be
71
allege
abuser
and
that
there
be
108
victim
,
be
it
fair
to
assume
it
be
only
a
sample
?
I
be
make
that
assumption
and
I
could
be
wrong
.
I
would
like
to
be
correct
or
educate
on
whether
that
be
the
case
.
if
it
be
only
a
sample
,
the
question
then
arise
as
to
whether
the
minister
or
Department
have
be
inform
about
whether
this
be
representative
of
a
much
large
figure
that
be
under
investigation
.
to
try
to
assist
my
understanding
of
this
,
be
it
safe
to
assume
that
in
Larch
Hill
,
there
be
a
number
of
file
in
addition
to
the
number
we
be
talk
about
here
today
?
it
be
pertinent
to
this
because
what
it
mean
be
that
what
the
minister
be
present
we
with
today
-
to
speak
to
the
minister
's
bona
fide
-
be
that
the
figure
she
have
articulate
to
we
be
exactly
the
number
articulate
to
she
as
minister
.
we
have
make
a
great
deal
of
progress
since
the
witness
's
appearance
in
May
.
at
that
point
,
there
be
much
that
we
do
not
know
.
Mr.
Elliot
have
say
at
that
stage
that
record
be
"
keep
securely
in
fireproof
filing
cabinet
in
Larch
Hill
"
and
the
Garda
and
Tusla
have
be
inform
about
that
.
we
be
a
number
of
month
on
in
the
process
and
we
have
a
picture
of
the
number
of
allege
abuser
.
we
may
not
have
be
present
with
a
finite
number
but
we
understand
that
it
be
a
iterative
ongoing
process
and
that
the
number
of
victim
may
increase
as
well
.
as
he
say
,
in
the
case
of
one
or
more
allege
perpetrator
there
be
no
file
.
I
be
satisfied
as
to
the
openness
of
scout
Ireland
's
engagement
with
we
today
in
ensure
that
there
be
confidence
on
the
part
of
member
present
but
,
most
important
,
on
the
part
of
the
ordinary
decent
people
who
give
of
they
time
every
day
to
the
organisation
and
that
who
fund
the
organisation
,
namely
the
taxpayer
.
notwithstanding
the
devastating
number
of
people
who
be
survivor
or
victim
,
some
of
whom
be
decease
,
we
cannot
even
imagine
on
a
human
level
what
the
survivor
be
go
through
at
present
.
it
be
unconscionable
.
we
have
to
have
some
confidence
in
the
fact
that
the
organisation
be
now
,
to
use
its
own
phrase
,
"
take
ownership
"
of
the
issue
and
that
they
be
put
in
place
a
victim
policy
.
that
certainly
give
I
some
confidence
.
be
Scouting
Ireland
make
a
financial
contingency
on
its
book
for
a
number
of
case
where
the
dpp
decide
that
there
be
a
nolle
prosequi
with
some
case
because
of
insufficient
evidence
?
I
do
not
want
to
presume
the
outcome
here
but
,
for
example
,
there
be
a
recognition
in
the
Cloyne
diocesan
investigation
where
certain
case
come
before
the
court
with
the
same
modus
operandi
that
on
the
balance
of
probability
etc.
that
there
be
enough
proof
,
notwithstand
the
lack
of
proof
in
the
book
of
evidence
,
and
that
there
should
be
some
form
of
compensation
.
be
the
new
board
discuss
that
issue
?
I
do
not
expect
the
board
to
say
that
it
be
but
I
want
this
issue
on
the
agenda
to
get
some
sense
from
the
organisation
that
it
be
deal
with
that
issue
.
there
be
precedent
in
case
bring
to
the
dpp
where
nolle
prosequi
be
the
determination
of
that
office
but
there
be
a
acknowledgement
by
the
organisation
that
abuse
take
place
.
be
Scouting
Ireland
discuss
the
possibility
that
some
fund
will
be
make
available
for
financial
compensation
or
for
service
to
be
wrap
around
the
person
in
question
?
be
litigation
outstanding
?
can
Ms
Kelly
say
how
many
case
be
outstanding
?
but
Ms
Kelly
acknowledge
that
there
be
case
outstanding
specifically
in
respect
of
allege
abuse
.
I
would
like
further
engagement
with
the
committee
regard
progress
on
that
matter
.
the
second
issue
be
the
complaint
policy
.
Ms
Kelly
's
intervention
deal
with
three
thematic
area
:
safeguard
;
accountability
and
disciplinary
policy
.
as
a
member
of
this
committee
,
I
wish
the
new
board
well
.
the
mood
music
have
change
on
ensure
that
there
be
a
new
transparency
in
how
matter
be
deal
with
.
the
new
board
have
receive
a
strong
mandate
from
the
individual
member
of
the
scouting
organisation
.
when
it
come
to
a
new
disciplinary
policy
,
be
I
correct
that
the
organisation
have
engage
a
employment
lawyer
who
have
externally
review
the
policy
,
and
that
it
have
adopt
new
procedure
since
18
November
?
if
there
be
complaint
then
,
for
instance
,
by
a
senior
member
of
the
organisation
against
a
individual
,
which
be
register
prior
to
that
,
what
be
the
status
of
that
complaint
now
?
it
do
but
only
to
a
certain
point
,
because
I
be
in
receipt
of
correspondence
about
individual
.
there
be
outstanding
issue
that
I
want
to
deal
with
.
there
be
,
for
instance
,
a
complaint
against
a
individual
who
be
now
the
subject
of
a
disciplinary
procedure
because
he
be
critical
of
a
senior
officer
within
the
organisation
.
there
be
allegation
against
the
complainant
by
a
senior
officer
of
the
organisation
,
who
have
state
in
a
letter
that
the
complainant
have
actively
support
criticism
of
he
and
of
he
performance
of
he
duty
and
have
call
for
he
resignation
.
the
person
who
call
for
the
resignation
of
the
senior
person
be
now
be
bring
in
front
of
Scouting
Ireland
under
page
11
of
the
dispute
and
adult
policy
,
etc
.
when
we
be
member
of
organisation
and
put
we
head
out
there
,
it
be
likely
that
people
will
criticise
we
.
there
be
a
fine
line
between
criticism
and
something
that
be
actionable
or
subject
to
a
disciplinary
procedure
.
have
the
new
board
examine
whether
the
four
live
complaint
will
proceed
?
have
they
the
support
of
the
board
?
I
be
keen
to
understand
the
new
structure
.
the
voluntary
board
be
disaggregate
itself
from
the
procedure
.
be
that
correct
?
I
be
suggest
now
that
this
will
become
a
live
issue
if
there
be
four
live
complaint
.
it
be
something
that
Ms
Kelly
,
as
chairperson
,
should
have
cognisance
of
in
respect
of
the
nature
of
the
complaint
.
that
be
all
I
be
say
.
I
be
keen
to
keep
this
in
a
positive
vein
.
again
,
I
thank
the
representative
of
Scouting
Ireland
for
come
before
the
committee
.
we
have
a
clear
sense
and
understanding
now
of
where
Scouting
Ireland
be
go
,
and
that
be
important
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
advertising
of
the
safeguarding
manager
position
.
Ms
Kelly
say
the
safeguard
manager
be
advertise
in
the
national
and
international
press
.
when
be
that
exactly
?
scout
Ireland
representative
be
before
the
committee
in
May
.
in
the
time
since
then
,
be
it
the
position
of
the
board
that
Scouting
Ireland
would
have
a
interim
position
with
Mr.
Elliot
in
place
and
then
move
to
advertising
?
be
Ms
Kelly
refer
to
the
barrister
's
report
?
as
layperson
look
in
on
Scouting
Ireland
,
we
all
want
to
give
the
organisation
a
fair
wind
.
however
,
in
the
answer
be
give
today
I
be
hear
that
the
organisation
will
decide
if
and
when
the
barrister
's
report
will
be
publish
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
taxpayer
's
money
be
spend
wisely
and
I
believe
we
need
to
hear
something
strong
to
assure
we
that
there
be
full
transparency
around
the
report
.
I
do
not
get
a
sense
of
that
at
the
moment
,
on
account
of
the
time
that
have
pass
.
on
the
disciplinary
procedure
,
I
be
very
heartened
to
hear
that
the
organisation
have
bring
in
a
external
lawyer
with
expertise
in
the
area
of
employment
and
labour
law
.
however
,
I
and
other
be
in
possession
of
letter
about
complaint
make
against
individual
.
I
accept
Ms
Kelly
's
statement
that
there
be
a
disaggregation
between
she
role
as
a
volunteer
and
as
a
member
of
the
executive
but
if
she
be
aware
that
there
be
four
live
complaint
,
I
assume
she
be
aware
of
the
nature
and
content
of
that
complaint
.
I
be
discuss
policy
and
procedure
.
a
submission
be
before
we
-----
there
be
correspondence
and
we
be
tell
a
new
policy
be
in
place
for
disciplinary
procedure
,
which
be
agree
on
18
November
.
disciplinary
letter
be
issue
prior
to
that
,
the
content
of
which
I
have
not
go
into
.
I
be
try
to
ascertain
whether
the
new
board
have
regard
to
that
letter
when
it
be
consider
the
new
policy
which
be
agree
on
18
November
.
in
other
word
,
do
the
new
board
stand
over
the
letter
that
be
issue
and
the
policy
around
they
?
I
thank
Ms
Kelly
for
she
frankness
,
which
be
refresh
.
there
need
to
be
a
clear
demarcation
between
role
and
everything
should
be
upfront
.
a
person
who
be
listen
to
this
meeting
and
who
may
be
the
subject
of
a
complaint
will
know
that
there
be
a
policy
and
procedure
for
how
the
complaint
be
deal
with
.
I
wish
the
new
board
well
.
there
will
be
a
role
for
we
in
seek
to
examine
how
the
transition
between
the
old
and
new
board
progress
.
Mr.
Elliott
be
very
honest
with
we
on
the
challenge
he
find
and
I
imagine
that
the
new
board
will
have
to
challenge
a
pre-exist
culture
.
I
be
not
say
there
be
a
black
mark
against
exist
culture
but
one
have
to
let
in
the
light
and
certain
people
might
not
be
favour
of
that
.
who
be
the
current
national
secretary
of
Scouting
Ireland
?
if
a
disciplinary
proceeding
be
issue
under
the
signature
of
the
national
secretary
in
October
,
what
be
the
status
of
that
if
the
association
be
wind
down
?
on
1
October
.
the
policy
have
remain
the
same
.
how
?
to
be
straight

I
will
try
to
give
the
minister
a
fair
hearing
and
look
at
the
issue
in
a
cold
and
rational
way
.
I
understand
from
she
response
that
a
set
of
substantive
recommendation
,
arise
from
the
operational
review
,
be
be
enact
but
that
she
will
not
publish
a
report
which
underpin
the
recommendation
.
be
that
assessment
correct
?
I
wish
to
tease
out
the
reason
for
the
minister
's
decision
.
we
have
all
receive
most
of
the
freedom
of
information
legislation
material
base
on
the
work
of
Justine
McCarthy
of
RTÉ
.
I
also
have
correspondence
date
17
November
2017
.
the
report
be
receive
in
February
2017
,
almost
a
full
two
year
ago
.
I
be
reluctant
to
name
people
,
but
there
be
correspondence
from
the
chairperson
of
the
board
to
a
senior
person
in
the
Department
which
state
the
board
's
view
remain
that
it
be
not
legally
safe
to
place
the
report
in
the
public
domain
and
that
it
could
see
no
basis
for
deviate
from
the
position
or
distinguish
between
different
type
of
publication
.
I
understand
some
of
the
reason
for
the
use
of
the
phrase
"
legally
safe
"
on
the
basis
that
,
in
give
it
to
certain
stakeholder
,
it
could
be
deem
to
be
legally
publish
.
however
,
I
be
confused
and
worried
about
the
minister
's
submission
,
in
which
she
state
:
when
I
be
last
here
I
advise
the
committee
that
the
board
of
management
of
Oberstown
have
decide
that
it
be
not
safe
to
publish
the
report
on
that
review
.
this
decision
be
base
on
a
careful
and
lengthy
process
of
deliberation
,
include
the
commissioning
of
independent
legal
advice
.
the
board
have
its
own
independent
legal
advice
,
while
the
minister
have
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
.
be
there
a
conflict
between
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
and
the
board
's
legal
advice
on
whether
the
minister
could
or
could
not
safely
publish
the
report
?
be
the
minister
minded
to
publish
the
report
?
if
the
Attorney
General
's
report
state
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
that
there
be
no
impediment
to
publication
of
the
report
,
it
would
be
logical
for
the
minister
to
deem
it
safe
to
publish
it
.
what
be
the
risk
?
be
the
advice
receive
from
the
Attorney
General
clear
on
the
publication
of
the
report
?
do
the
Attorney
General
hedge
he
position
?
I
understand
the
minister
will
not
go
into
the
detail
of
the
content
of
the
Attorney
General
's
advice
,
but
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
could
be
give
the
sense
that
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
publish
the
report
.
there
be
always
a
risk
,
but
there
do
not
appear
to
have
be
a
prima
facie
case
against
the
report
's
publication
from
the
government
's
point
of
view
.
be
there
a
statutory
entitlement
on
the
part
of
the
board
not
to
publish
?
frankly
,
I
do
not
understand
that
.
I
be
not
a
lawyer
,
but
I
look
at
it
from
the
layman
's
perspective
.
many
stakeholder
have
have
access
to
the
report
.
do
HIQA
not
have
access
to
the
report
?
do
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
have
access
to
it
?
be
HIQA
and
the
Minister
's
Department
the
only
two
stakeholder
that
have
access
to
the
report
?
what
do
the
minister
mean
by
"
fair
procedure
"
?
can
she
spell
it
out
in
very
simple
term
?
that
be
the
point
.
individual
be
name
in
the
Goldson
-
Hardwick
report
.
be
there
specific
name
person
who
it
be
believe
be
entitle
to
fair
procedure
?
be
that
the
reason
the
report
be
not
be
publish
?
the
minister
be
say
the
process
of
the
report-----
I
appreciate
that
.
I
be
keen
to
have
the
point
clarify
to
ensure
I
understand
it
correctly
.
be
the
minister
say
there
be
a
flaw
in
the
process
?
perhaps
I
do
not
mean
a
flaw
in
the
process
but
rather
the
question
of
whether
the
process
be
imperfect
to
the
point
of
say
there
be
nothing
build
in
to
allow
person
possibly
name
in
the
report
to
be
afford
due
process
and
a
entitlement
to
they
good
name
,
to
use
the
language
of
the
law
of
tort
.
to
be
helpful
to
the
minister
,
I
will
refer
to
correspondence
receive
from
senior
official
.
the
relevant
date
be
13
November
2017
.
the
correspondence
state
the
Department
be
of
the
view
that
the
follow
be
mechanism
to
progress
matter
to
ensure
the
matter
raise
be
address
in
respect
of
the
board
and
principal
people
within
it
.
the
first
mechanism
be
a
response
to
the
author
of
the
report
point
to
the
existence
of
concern
about
fair
procedure
and
suggest
a
further
process
of
engagement
with
staff
and
management
at
Oberstown
to
ensure
person
criticise
in
the
report
have
be
fairly
hear
.
the
alternative
mechanism
would
involve
a
submission
by
the
board
and
management
of
the
Oberstown
campus
on
behalf
of
the
person
criticise
in
the
report
to
be
disclose
to
HIQA
and
the
Oireachtas
joint
committee
,
with
the
report
.
the
official
seek
to
arrange
a
meeting
between
the
relevant
people
and
the
Department
to
discuss
the
matter
since
the
minister
be
due
to
appear
before
the
Oireachtas
joint
committee
on
22
November
.
as
I
recall
,
the
issue
do
not
arise
at
that
meeting
,
but
the
minister
do
anticipate
that
they
would
arise
.
they
be
arise
now
.
on
what
we
be
strident
-
I
think
the
minister
be
see
unity
across
the
member
of
the
committee
in
that
regard
-
be
the
fact
that
I
would
not
be
do
my
job
if
I
leave
here
with
question
on
my
mind
about
the
content
of
a
report
from
eminent
person
such
as
Professor
Goldson
and
Professor
Hardwick
.
I
be
not
a
conspiracy
theorist
,
but
be
there
some
cover
-
up
of
practice
at
the
Oberstown
centre
about
which
we
need
to
hear
in
the
public
interest
?
be
people
be
protect
unduly
?
the
conflict
I
have
in
my
mind
be
that
I
must
always
take
step
to
protect
the
good
name
of
individual
and
due
process
,
but
there
be
also
the
matter
of
the
public
interest
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
recommendation
be
be
implement
,
that
HIQA
be
now
in
Oberstown
and
that
there
be
a
clear
pathway
in
the
improvement
be
make
,
we
still
have
the
sword
of
Damocles
of
the
report
hang
over
we
head
as
a
Oireachtas
committee
and
I
do
not
believe
we
will
be
satisfied
until
we
receive
clear
answer
on
its
publication
.
I
do
not
believe
the
public
will
be
satisfied
until
it
be
publish
.
we
need
clear
answer
to
certain
question
.
what
be
the
level
of
risk
inherent
in
the
Attorney
General
's
advice
to
the
minister
?
there
be
possibly
more
than
one
piece
of
advice
.
perhaps
the
minister
might
clarify
the
matter
.
there
may
have
be
more
than
one
engagement
with
the
Attorney
General
's
office
.
frankly
,
I
do
not
think
the
Attorney
General
say
to
the
minister
of
the
day
that
it
be
the
advice
of
the
office
not
to
publish
the
report
.
I
come
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
be
respectful
of
the
minister
's
position
.
have
they
respond
since
?
I
be
ask
the
question
specifically
about
whether
the
process
of
publication
of
the
report-----
the
person
name
in
the
report
.
I
be
refer
to
the
person
or
entity
and
practice
criticise
in
the
report
.
have
they
have
a
chance
to
respond
?
be
they
invite
back
?
be
they
invite
back
?
be
the
process
design
to
accommodate
it
?
that
be
why
I
be
talk
about
the
process
.
be
the
process
design
in
such
a
way
that
if
finding
be
make
against
person
or
the
entity
,
there
would
be
a
right
of
reply
?
they
do
not
do
that
.
I
think
it
be
a
little
clear
now
.
I
be
try
to
reconcile
in
my
own
mind
the
interpretation
of
the
minister
and
the
Department
regard
the
status
of
the
report
.
if
there
be
respect
for
due
procedure
,
then
there
be
a
entitlement
on
the
part
of
that
who
be
the
subject
of
the
report
to
due
process
.
give
that
there
be
no
further
interaction
between
Professor
Goldson
and
Hardwick
,
and
notwithstand
the
fact
Oberstown
be
implement
the
recommendation
and
HIQA
be
across
that
,
do
this
mean
this
report
be
still
,
arguably
,
in
the
minister
's
or
the
Department
's
interpretation
,
not
a
full
but
a
draft
report
,
and
incomplete
in
that
sense
as
per
the
term
of
reference
?
this
be
where
the
foi
datum
come
into
play
.
I
refer
to
a
document
of
15
August
2017
in
this
regard
.
I
have
a
full
set
of
the
document
through
FOI
.
the
source
be
RTÉ
and
this
be
in
the
public
domain
.
there
be
a
letter
in
the
Department
which
state
that
there
be
confusion
generally
as
to
the
status
of
the
report
and
that
,
while
the
reviewer
consider
the
report
to
be
the
final
report
,
this
be
not
necessarily
the
view
of
the
Department
or
Oberstown
.
if
the
minister
tell
we
there
be
a
conflict
between
the
reviewer
in
term
of
a
understanding
of
what
the
status
of
the
report
be
,
that
will
provide
some
clarity
.
however
,
notwithstand
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
in
the
context
of
risk
,
as
I
understand
it
,
the
minister
still
have
full
discretion
,
base
on
that
advice
,
as
to
whether
she
wish
to
publish
the
report
.
I
be
only
one
member
of
the
Oireachtas
.
I
note
the
minister
's
early
comment
in
respect
of
the
mandate
of
this
committee
but
we
be
all
also
member
of
the
Oireachtas
and
we
speak
to
the
public
interest
and
can
question
anything
at
any
time
.
notwithstanding
the
mandate
of
this
committee
,
it
be
my
view
that
the
minister
should
publish
and
be
damned
,
as
they
say
,
and
put
it
all
out
there
in
the
public
domain
.
I
suggest
we
will
be
revisit
this
.
to
give
the
minister
some
food
for
thought
,
I
do
not
get
into
the
statement
that
be
issue
by
Professor
Barry
Goldson
on
10
November
,
where
he
state
very
clearly
in
the
public
domain
that
he
give
the
board
and
the
various
stakeholder
every
opportunity
to
engage
with
he
in
respect
of
the
issue
before
they
go
to
publication
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
there
seem
to
be
a
contradiction
between
the
minister
and
the
Department
's
position
and
that
of
Goldson
and
Hardwick
in
this
respect
.
in
term
of
the
procedure
-----
I
ask
previously
in
term
of
fair
procedure
whether
the
reviewer
go
back
and
my
understanding
of
the
minister
's
response
be
that
they
do
not
go
back
.
they
be
say
in
they
statement
that
they
offer
every
opportunity
before
come
to
they
final
report
for
the
individual
involve
,
or
for
Oberstown
,
to
provide
further
detail
or
clarification
of
point
they
have
make
.
it
seem
to
I
that
perhaps
the
mechanism
or
procedure
operate
by
the
reviewer
be
more
robust
than
we
have
previously
understand
.
the
impression
have
be
give
here
that
they
be
less
than
robust
.
I
would
contend
,
base
on
that
statement
,
that
Goldson
and
Hardwick
be
more
than
comprehensive
in
respect
of
they
interaction
with
Oberstown
.
this
need
to
be
tease
out
further
.
be
the
minister
finish
with
the
process
follow
the
Oberstown
report
?
I
apologise
to
the
chairman
for
take
up
so
much
time
on
this
.
it
would
appear
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
base
on
Goldson
and
Hardwick
,
that
everybody
in
Oberstown
be
give
the
right
to
reply
or
be
allow
due
procedure
.
I
be
certainly
of
the
impression
,
however
,
base
on
the
minister
's
interaction
with
we
,
that
this
be
not
she
interpretation
of
event
.
that
be
where
the
question
lie
in
my
mind
.
that
be
the
point
make
by
deputy
Lisa
Chambers
.

of
the

I
be
delighted
the
witness
be
here
today
because
this
have
give
we
much
clarity
and
have
probably
answer
some
of
the
question
we
have
on
the
process
undertake
.
the
witness
should
know
that
neither
we
committee
nor
I
have
have
access
to
or
see
the
report
.
this
committee
be
fly
blind
.
we
have
a
sense
from
the
minister
's
interaction
with
we
prior
to
Christmas
that
the
HIQA
recommendation
be
be
work
through
.
I
certainly
have
the
impression
from
that
interaction
with
she
that
that
be
as
a
result
of
work
that
have
flow
from
the
witness
report
.
my
question
be
about
the
term
of
reference
.
we
have
be
give
a
impression
that
observation
be
make
by
the
witness
that
be
outside
the
term
of
reference
of
the
report
.
what
be
they
view
on
that
?
I
be
quote
the
minister
directly
.
in
response
to
a
question
from
deputy
Rabbitte
at
the
last
committee
meeting
,
the
minister
state
:
the
report
be
write
and
conclusion
,
observation
and
recommendation
be
make
.
I
answer
deputy
Rabbitte
's
question
about
observation
make
that
be
outside
the
term
of
reference
and
which
go
into
policy
issue
.
it
be
not
provide
for
Oberstown
House
for
people
to
review
.
person
may
have
be
name
.
person
be
name
within
the
report
.
I
ask
Professor
Hardwick
to
forgive
I
if
he
have
answer
this
question
already
.
on
that
basis
,
do
the
witness
see
any
impediment
,
in
the
public
interest
,
to
this
report
come
into
full
public
view
?
again
,
I
will
quote
from
my
own
question
to
the
minister
at
we
last
committee
meeting
about
this
.
I
ask
she
"
be
the
process
design
in
such
a
way
that
if
finding
be
make
against
person
or
the
entity
,
there
would
be
a
right
of
reply
?
"
the
minister
reply
:
yes
.
they
be
ask
to
provide
the
report
for
the
people
concerned
before
there
be
a
final
report
.
that
be
what
I
be
say
.
from
what
I
have
hear
so
far
,
the
witness
be
satisfied
in
they
own
mind
that
this
actually
take
place
and
that
they
openly
say
that
if
anybody
want
to
discuss
the
finding
of
the
report
,
they
would
make
themselves
available
to
do
so
.
the
minister
do
say
follow
that
-----
the
minister
say
:
the
Oberstown
centre
envisage
that
the
visit
would
take
place
before
the
reviewer
finalise
the
report
-
that
be
include
in
the
term
of
reference
-
in
order
that
comment
could
be
take
into
account
in
the
final
version
of
the
report
.
however
,
the
reviewer
maintain
that
it
would
not
have
be
possible
to
provide
feedback
until
the
final
report
have
be
complete
.
be
that
what
the
deputy
want
to
have
publish
?
the
reviewer
consider
it
to
be
final
.
I
acknowledge
the
witness
be
repeat
themselves
.
what
I
be
try
to
reconcile
be
that
while
we
have
not
have
access
to
the
report
,
we
do
have
access
to
the
recommendation
and
we
know
that
HIQA
have
have
access
to
the
report
and
there
be
a
process
of
work
through
it
.
ultimately
all
of
this
be
to
ensure
that
Oberstown
be
fit
for
purpose
and
there
be
robust
procedure
,
protocol
and
standard
operating
procedure
.
if
there
be
still
a
sword
of
Damocles
hang
over
Oberstown
in
respect
of
this
report
,
we
be
try
to
tease
out
the
fair
procedure
the
minister
tell
we
about
in
this
committee
.
as
she
have
not
publish
the
report
,
she
must
have
receive
advice
against
publish
it
.
we
be
try
to
reconcile
that
with
the
fact
that
to
we
mind
,
the
public
good
be
not
be
serve
by
not
publish
the
report
to
date
.
do
Professor
Hardwick
think
the
board
of
Oberstown
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
publication
of
the
report
?
I
mean
from
a
personal
responsibility
point
of
view
.
and
to
embrace
it
.
as
a
final
question
,
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
methodology
.
Professor
Hardwick
and
Goldson
be
both
academic
and
most
of
we
in
this
house
be
not
,
although
we
have
interface
with
academic
.
can
the
witness
give
we
confidence
that
the
methodology
they
use
be
in
line
with
international
good
practice
?
I
be
not
question
they
bona
fide
.
there
may
be
other
who
would
come
before
this
committee
and
question
the
methodology
.
I
want
to
be
sure
in
my
mind
that
the
methodology
be
robust
.
I
thank
Professor
Goldson
.
Professor
Goldson
make
a
point
about
the
minister
's
interaction
in
respect
of
the
legal
advice
.
I
will
go
back
and
quote
directly
what
the
minister
say
:
I
have
indicate
in
term
of
the
legal
advice
as
well
as
the
experience
of
the
board
,
the
staff
and
my
official
,
that
fair
procedure
be
not
follow
.
therefore
there
be
a
lack
of
fairness
there
,
which
lead
to
the
legal
risk
,
which
be
why
there
be
not
a
publication
.
I
do
not
in
any
way
wish
to
put
word
in
Professor
Goldson
's
mouth
but
perhaps
he
can
enlighten
we
.
do
he
agree
with
that
statement
?
okay
,
so
there
be
no
reason
from
a
legal
standpoint
for
the
report
not
to
be
publish
.
to
be
helpful
,
the
legal
advice
to
the
minister
be
from
the
Attorney
General
's
office
and
we
do
not
have
access
to
that
legal
advice
in
this
House
.
therefore
,
one
can
assume
the
representative
of
Oberstown
do
not
have
access
to
that
legal
advice
either
.
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
law
.
on
that
basis
,
my
understanding
be
that
the
minister
have
discretion
,
on
the
basis
of
the
advice
,
as
to
whether
to
publish
.
what
we
be
hear
here
,
base
on
what
have
be
a
enlightening
interaction
with
the
delegate
,
be
that
there
be
now
a
clear
need
for
the
report
to
be
publish
and
put
in
the
public
domain
so
the
question
that
arise
may
be
answer
satisfactorily
and
so
member
of
this
committee
can
make
some
determination
as
to
they
interpretation
of
matter
.
this
be
a
political
domain
,
not
a
legal
one
.
to
reiterate
the
point
make
previously
,
we
do
not
have
sight
of
the
report
.
however
,
we
do
have
sight
of
the
recommendation
and
take
in
good
faith
the
statement
make
in
respect
of
the
implementation
of
that
recommendation
.
what
we
find
hard
to
reconcile
be
the
non-publication
of
the
report
.
I
listen
very
carefully
to
Professor
Kilkelly
in
respect
of
the
constitutional
element
in
term
of
implicate
people
in
the
report
.
I
appreciate
that
dynamic
because
Professor
Kilkelly
state
that
while
nobody
be
specifically
identify
,
the
language
of
the
report
could
be
deem
to
identify
individual
.
in
light
of
what
Professor
Kilkelly
say
,
what
be
the
exact
nature
of
the
independent
advice
give
to
the
board
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
independent
advice
give
to
the
board
?
could
she
be
more
specific
about
it
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
interaction
with
the
minister
or
she
official
regard
that
independent
advice
?
when
the
minister
appear
before
we
,
she
state
that
she
have
be
advise
by
the
board
that
its
decision
not
to
publish
the
report
of
the
operational
review
be
not
one
it
either
expect
or
want
to
make
and
that
it
result
from
a
lengthy
,
careful
and
extensive
process
of
consideration
that
weigh
up
the
legal
risk
associate
with
publication
in
light
of
the
independent
legal
advice
.
we
be
in
the
political
domain
and
we
perceive
that
the
non-publication
of
the
report
could
arguably
be
perceive
to
be
cover
up
or
protect
practice
,
culture
or
individual
.
we
need
some
reassurance
from
Professor
Kilkelly
that
the
board
's
independent
legal
advice
be
robust
and
some
great
articulation
of
what
Professor
Kilkelly
mean
by
the
implication
of
that
advice
.
could
I
ask
Professor
Kilkelly
to
hold
it
there
?
in
light
of
that
very
statement
,
be
a
opportunity
give
to
that
individual
,
or
be
discussion
hold
with
they
with
a
view
to
interact
with
the
two
eminent
expert
in
respect
of
the
content
and
language
of
the
report
?
that
be
not
what
I
ask
.
there
be
a
tendency
sometimes
in
this
House
to
go
after
people
and
witness
.
the
dynamic
of
this
committee
have
be
such
that
it
have
be
very
patient
on
this
issue
.
we
seek
to
ensure
witness
's
bona
fide
be
respect
.
that
be
why
we
need
very
clear
,
succinct
and
simple
language
.
my
question
be
very
simple
.
I
want
to
know
whether
the
individual
who
might
be
implicate
by
virtue
of
the
language
of
the
report
be
give
a
opportunity
to
interact
with
the
eminent
professor
in
respect
of
the
report
's
content
or
the
implication
of
the
language
use
in
the
report
.
yes
or
no
?
I
believe
Professor
Kilkelly
use
the
word
"
property
"
in
respect
of
the
report
.
I
be
just
quote
the
professor
and
she
may
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
she
say
the
report
be
the
property
of
that
who
commission
it
.
on
that
basis
,
who
own
the
report
?
the
board
own
the
report
.
if
the
board
own
it
,
notwithstand
the
issue
of
timing
,
the
fact
that
the
committee
have
demand
the
publication
of
the
report
,
and
we
interaction
with
the
minister
,
be
there
still
scope
and
time
,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
Professor
Goldson
and
Hardwick
in
respect
of
they
willingness
to
engage
at
all
level
and
with
all
stakeholder
,
to
go
over
the
report
again
and
work
through
its
content
if
it
be
deem
that
there
be
adverse
finding
against
or
implication
for
certain
individual
?
from
my
perspective
in
seek
to
address
the
issue
concern
the
recommendation
publish
in
July
2017
,
even
if
that
recommendation
be
implement
,
the
sword
of
Damocles
of
this
report
will
still
be
hang
over
we
.
as
I
say
at
the
outset
,
we
be
in
the
political
domain
,
not
the
legal
domain
.
report
perceive
to
have
be
suppress
always
get
publish
,
one
way
or
another
.
I
say
respectfully
to
Professor
Kilkelly
that
I
perceive
defensiveness
here
on
the
part
of
the
board
.
I
do
not
perceive
the
same
defensiveness
on
the
part
of
Professor
Goldson
and
Hardwick
.
this
be
perception
;
it
be
reality
in
the
political
domain
.
both
side
need
to
go
through
this
report
again
and
find
some
common
ground
,
irrespective
of
whether
this
process
be
broker
by
the
minister
or
someone
else
.
one
way
or
another
,
the
report
will
have
to
be
publish
.
the
public
interest
absolutely
demand
it
.
be
there
not
a
contradiction
there
?
Professor
Kilkelly
be
say
finding
have
be
reach
.
have
she
not
accept
the
finding
and
content
of
the
report
on
the
basis
that
she
be
implement
its
recommendation
?
arguably
,
then
,
the
report
be
not
a
final
report
.
I
have
a
question
before
Professor
Kilkelly
conclude
.
I
will
reinforce
the
point
make
by
deputy
Clare
Daly
.
Correspondence
be
make
available
on
13
November
2017
as
a
result
of
a
freedom
of
information
request
.
the
board
have
receive
legal
advice
on
13
March
2017
.
the
correspondence
be
from
a
principal
officer
,
who
I
will
not
name
,
in
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
it
state
that
the
Department
be
of
the
view
that
the
follow
be
mechanism
to
progress
matter
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
matter
raise
by
the
board
be
address
.
this
be
the
independent
legal
advice
.
there
follow
a
set
of
proposal
.
the
first
be
a
response
to
the
author
of
the
report
point
out
the
existence
of
concern
about
fair
procedure
and
suggest
a
further
process
of
engagement
with
staff
and
management
of
Oberstown
in
order
to
ensure
that
person
criticise
in
the
report
have
be
fairly
hear
.
alternatively
,
the
board
of
management
of
Oberstown
campus
could
make
a
submission
on
behalf
of
the
person
criticise
in
the
report
to
be
disclose
to
HIQA
and
the
joint
Oireachtas
committee
along
with
the
report
.
to
reinforce
deputy
Daly
's
point
,
member
be
very
much
of
the
view
that
everything
be
do
to
try
to
facilitate
the
board
,
either
through
further
engagement
with
the
author
of
the
report
or
through
the
legal
mechanism
of
the
high
office
of
the
State
,
to
publish
the
report
,
yet
it
refuse
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
its
own
independent
legal
advice
.
the
argument
the
witness
be
make
do
not
hold
water
.
the
board
decide
not
to
go
along
with
that
suggestion
.
I
place
on
record
the
content
of
the
Department
's
correspondence
with
Professor
Kilkelly
.
by
any
interpretation
,
the
Department
be
seek
to
suggest
further
engagement
with
the
staff
and
management
to
ensure
that
person
criticise
in
the
report
have
be
fairly
hear
.
notwithstanding
the
point
that
a
finding
have
be
make
,
which
Professor
Kilkelly
make
previously
,
there
be
still
scope
for
further
engagement
with
the
various
stakeholder
before
the
publication
of
the
report
.
Professor
Kilkelly
seem
to
be
say
that
in
spite
of
that
suggestion
,
the
board
decide
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
its
independent
legal
advice
.
a
pathway
be
be
seek
for
the
board
but
it
refuse
to
take
it
.
fair
procedure
have
be
the
defence
here
.
I
believe
that
Professor
Kilkelly
's
argument
in
respect
of
the
finding
militate
against
fair
procedure
.
the
Department
make
a
offer
to
the
board
of
Oberstown
to
discuss
the
issue
of
fair
procedure
.
Professor
Kilkelly
be
say
the
board
take
up
that
offer
.
I
do
not
understand
she
answer
to
that
,
because
the
evidence
we
hear
from
Professor
Goldson
and
Hardwick
today
would
suggest
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
there
be
no
further
qualitative
engagement
with
they
on
the
issue
of
fair
procedure
.
it
be
very
hard
to
find
Professor
Kilkelly
's
answer
to
be
credible
.
I
thank
Professor
Kilkelly

she
presentation
today

for

with
the
question
pose
by

.
I
thank
the
representative
for
they
attendance
.
the
motivation
for
ask
they
to
appear
be
to
gain
a
understanding
of
the
dynamic
within
and
between
HIQA
and
Tusla
.
I
be
try
to
understand
the
dynamic
that
exist
in
term
of
the
regulation
of
social
worker
.
CORU
be
the
regulatory
body
for
registration
and
so
on
.
however
,
I
do
not
have
a
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
exist
between
HIQA
and
,
for
example
,
the
social
care
or
social
work
framework
.
HIQA
may
have
,
for
example
,
14
inspector
operate
across
the
country
.
its
open
statement
state
:
Tusla
cannot
rely
on
recur
staff
shortage
as
the
default
reason
for
fail
to
deliver
a
efficient
and
safe
service
to
child
and
they
family
.
nor
can
they
use
this
as
a
excuse
for
not
provide
a
environment
where
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
can
enjoy
do
the
core
job
they
be
qualified
to
do
.
be
that
statement
base
on
a
determination
or
examination
of
the
dynamic
that
exist
as
between
the
client
or
service
user
and
the
social
worker
?
do
that
mean
that
HIQA
's
14
inspector
speak
to
each
social
worker
throughout
the
country
in
order
to
allow
that
adjudication
to
be
make
?
how
do
HIQA
determine
the
level
or
quality
of
contact
time
?
how
do
it
determine
the
level
of
bureaucracy
and
paperwork
?
can
it
manage
that
time
?
can
it
measure
the
time
social
worker
spend
in
contact
with
they
client
and
the
time
they
spend
on
paperwork
?
do
HIQA
go
down
to
that
level
of
granularity
?
I
wish
to
be
sure
that
I
understand
correctly
.
the
statutory
investigation
shine
a
light
on
the
process
.
the
standard
operating
procedure
and
protocol
be
offer
up
to
HIQA
and
it
could
determine
from
that
how
the
overall
organisation
be
operate
.
be
adherence
a
systematic
issue
within
Tusla
?
HIQA
interact
with
the
Department
on
that
group
.
what
be
the
current
rate
of
progress
on
that
issue
?
the
natural
instinct
of
committee
member
be
to
empathise
with
social
care
worker
and
social
worker
.
we
limited
interaction
with
they
through
we
constituency
office
indicate
that
caseload
be
a
significant
factor
for
they
.
if
there
be
a
finite
number
of
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
and
the
rate
of
attrition
be
high
,
one
can
reasonably
extrapolate
that
the
number
of
case
each
worker
must
manage
be
increase
.
I
would
contend
that
there
be
not
enough
hour
in
the
day
for
they
to
deal
with
every
case
from
a
time
management
point
of
view
.
there
must
be
some
sympathy
for
the
position
in
which
they
find
themselves
,
notwithstand
the
immediacy
of
the
need
of
the
child
or
family
.
be
social
care
worker
and
social
worker
now
be
put
through
the
ringer
?
the
statutory
investigation
be
very
challenging
in
term
of
its
conclusion
and
be
instigate
in
the
wide
context
of
a
tribunal
.
be
Tusla
staff
now
subject
to
a
high
level
of
bureaucracy
that
be
challenge
they
ability
to
deliver
for
the
people
they
serve
and
put
they
under
even
more
pressure
?
to
give
some
of
the
context
,
we
all
understand
very
well
how
HIQA
operate
.
we
know
,
for
instance
,
what
it
do
in
tertiary
hospital
in
measure
bed
space
and
process
within
acute
hospital
setting
.
however
,
should
it
be
so
strident
within
social
care
setting
in
human
contact
between
a
social
worker
and
the
client
and
he
or
she
family
?
as
state
,
I
know
that
it
be
not
possible
to
compromise
in
deal
with
risk
,
but
we
need
to
give
they
a
bit
of
a
break
and
recognise
that
they
find
themselves
under
massive
pressure
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
fair
to
state
"
nor
can
[
Tusla
]
use
this
as
a
excuse
for
not
provide
a
environment
where
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
can
enjoy
do
the
core
job
they
be
qualified
to
do
.
"
Ms
Dunnion
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
might
not
be
able
to
do
the
job
they
be
qualified
to
do
because
they
do
not
have
the
toolkit
to
do
it
and
they
caseload
be
get
heavy
.
therefore
,
the
risk
also
increase
,
which
be
not
necessarily
always
the
fault
of
the
social
worker
.
I
be
fearful
that
we
could
be
put
the
blame
on
the
head
of
the
social
worker
or
the
social
care
worker
.
that
be
my
key
point
.
I
ask
Ms
Dunnion
to
dissuade
I
in
hold
that
view
.
I
appreciate
that
.
I
thank
Ms
Dunnion
for
that
answer
.
I
have
one
final
question
.
I
want
to
understand
the
dynamic
in
the
relationship
between
HIQA
and
the
institute
of
high
education
.
HIQA
have
make
specific
recommendation
on
the
need
for
more
graduate
,
etc
.
do
it
have
a
statutory
role
in
determine
that
dynamic
?
do
it
have
influence
in
lean
on
Tusla
and
the
Department
to
be
able
to
suggest
that
if
certain
course
of
action
be
take
,
certain
programme
be
create
or
there
be
engagement
with
a
particular
institution
,
more
place
could
be
create
to
meet
the
shortage
?
I
understand
HIQA
can
make
recommendation
,
but
be
that
all
it
can
do
?
do
it
have
any
power
to
follow
through
on
they
?
that
be
fair
enough
.
on
the
review
of
good
practice
,
HIQA
make
a
recommendation
that
a
international
review
of
good
practice
be
undertake
.
how
stand
that
recommendation
?
I
thank
Ms
Dunnion
.
I
apologise
in
advance
as
I
be
under
time
constraint
and
will
have
to
leave
the
meeting
.
some
of
we
have
question
to
the
minister
,
who
be
in
the
Chamber
so
I
will
not
delay
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
.
Tusla
's
statement
be
very
clear
in
that
it
set
out
pathway
and
challenge
.
I
welcome
this
and
acknowledge
the
recruitment
and
retention
challenge
Tusla
face
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
challenge
it
face
in
respect
of
the
HIQA
report
and
investigation
and
the
outworking
of
that
.
the
expert
assurance
group
,
EAG
,
which
be
establish
to
oversee
and
advise
on
the
implementation
of
the
recommendation
of
HIQA
's
investigation
,
have
publish
its
first
quarterly
report
.
will
the
witness
give
I
a
sense
of
how
this
be
work
for
they
at
present
?
do
there
continue
to
be
a
structure
engagement
with
HIQA
?
how
often
do
that
take
place
?
do
it
take
place
through
the
expert
assurance
group
?
I
ask
Mr.
Smyth
to
talk
to
I
about
Tusla
's
whole
-
time
equivalent
.
the
number
of
staff
have
reach
3893
.
of
that
,
1453
be
involved
in
social
work
or
social
care
.
be
this
increase
a
result
of
the
recruitment
drive
?
Tusla
have
499
agency
staff
.
of
that
,
226
be
social
worker
and
160
be
in
social
care
.
how
much
be
this
cost
Tusla
,
quarterly
or
annually
?
that
be
obviously
a
substantial
cost
.
what
be
Mr.
Smyth
do
to
shift
that
dynamic
in
order
that
Tusla
can
recruit
this
people
as
whole
-
time
equivalent
?
if
I
be
a
agency
worker
,
why
would
I
want
to
go
into
Tusla
?
be
it
more
beneficial
in
term
of
my
term
and
condition
and
rate
of
pay
to
stay
as
a
agency
worker
?
be
Mr.
Smyth
try
proactively
to
disrupt
this
dynamic
in
order
to
bring
they
in
?
do
we
know
how
much
the
agency
be
creame
off
the
top
for
-----
how
much
?
can
Mr.
Smyth
supply
we
with
general
figure
regard
this
dynamic
?
if
it
be
€
31
million
,
it
be
a
big
chunk
of
change
out
of
Tusla
's
annual
budget
.
if
10
%
be
go
to
recruitment
agency
,
that
be
a
unmitigated
scandal
.
I
be
not
blame
the
witness
for
that
-
that
be
the
way
the
system
be
work
-
but
there
be
something
inherently
wrong
in
that
.
my
next
question
concern
foster
.
of
the
1453
social
worker
,
how
many
be
in
foster
?
there
be
a
perception
that
people
be
move
more
and
more
into
foster
.
Mr.
Smyth
may
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
in
my
perception
,
but
child
protection
,
for
instance
,
be
incredibly
difficult
work
both
psychologically
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
stress
.
I
imagine
that
there
may
be
a
perception
that
foster
be
a
little
easy
.
I
be
not
say
it
be
not
challenging
-
I
be
try
to
understand
the
dynamic
-
but
I
imagine
there
be
a
high
rate
of
attrition
,
not
people
leave
the
service
but
move
into
another
service
within
the
overall
family
.
how
many
be
move
across
from
child
protection
or
other
area
?
foster
be
as
difficult
and
challenging
as
the
other
area
.
my
last
question
concern
international
good
practice
.
the
witness
may
not
have
the
answer
now
.
I
perceive
that
the
role
of
a
social
worker
in
society
today
be
potentially
very
much
more
complex
than
it
might
have
be
ten
,
15
or
20
year
ago
.
be
there
a
natural
rate
of
burnout
?
be
there
a
period
of
year
beyond
which
one
should
not
work
so
as
to
guarantee
the
well
-
being
of
the
individual
social
worker
?
again
,
this
be
just
perception
.
one
would
imagine
that
if
one
be
work
at
the
coalface
of
child
protection
for
ten
,
15
or
20
year
,
manage
that
stress
level
would
become
hard
and
hard
.
be
there
a
period
after
which
one
should
leave
?
I
ask
this
because
if
the
answer
be
in
the
affirmative
,
that
have
a
bear
on
the
strategy
for
graduate
recruitment
and
so
on
.
I
just
wonder
if
Tusla
be
deal
with
that
dynamic
.
it
be
a
complex
question
,
to
which
a
complex
answer
be
probably
require
.
if
the
witness
cannot
answer
now
,
I
understand
,
but
it
would
be
useful
if
they
could
revert
to
the
committee
to
give
we
a
sense
of
that
dynamic
.
be
that
process
under
way
?
be
someone
kick
the
tyre
in
the
process
to
see
if
it
work
?
I
thank
the

considerable

I
nominate
deputy
Neville
.
I
find
myself
in
a
strange
position
.
we
be
address
a
issue
in
respect
of
Mr.
Rabbitte
's
chairing
of
Tusla
.
he
be
a
former
colleague
so
it
feel
very
strange
to
be
on
this
side
of
the
table
when
he
be
on
that
side
.
I
acknowledge
Mr.
Rabbitte
's
stellar
public
service
.
as
he
state
,
he
have
spend
much
of
he
life
in
public
service
.
on
a
personal
level
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
he
will
bring
a
perspective
that
reflect
that
public
service
to
he
role
as
chairperson
of
Tusla
.
he
will
have
a
very
strong
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
drive
the
type
of
work
we
,
as
public
representative
,
so
and
the
challenge
we
face
in
represent
constituent
whose
family
interface
with
organisation
like
the
HSE
and
Tusla
.
he
will
have
a
very
intimate
knowledge
of
that
and
,
because
he
have
that
perspective
,
it
will
very
much
drive
the
type
of
culture
to
which
he
refer
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Rabbitte
's
open
statement
.
I
sense
from
it
that
there
be
a
need
for
Tusla
to
be
very
open
in
term
of
how
it
operate
and
also
in
recognise
the
challenge
that
it
face
as
a
organisation
.
I
wish
Mr.
Rabbitte
well
in
the
role
.
today
be
perhaps
just
a
starting
point
in
deepening
the
relationship
between
Tusla
as
a
organisation
and
this
committee
.
Mr.
Rabbitte
make
reference
to
the
challenge
he
face
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
shortage
of
social
worker
,
which
have
a
massive
bear
on
the
interaction
between
the
family
unit
and
the
State
in
term
of
the
societal
issue
that
exist
.
I
want
to
delve
a
bit
deep
into
the
issue
of
recruitment
.
we
have
a
very
positive
interaction
with
Tusla
in
respect
of
the
challenge
it
face
and
the
interaction
it
be
have
with
academia
in
the
context
of
try
to
recruit
social
worker
in
a
very
competitive
space
where
,
arguably
,
the
issue
that
exist
mean
that
it
be
compete
on
a
global
level
for
talent
.
I
wonder
if
there
need
to
be
a
strong
political
input
at
government
level
and
on
a
cross-
departmental
basis
between
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
and
Education
and
Skill
,
for
example
,
in
the
context
of
ownership
of
this
as
a
policy
issue
.
I
would
like
to
hear
Mr.
Rabbitte
's
perspective
on
that
,
although
I
be
conscious
that
he
cannot
stray
too
much
into
the
political
space
.
we
know
there
be
a
shortage
of
social
worker
and
what
the
consequence
of
that
shortage
be
.
we
know
people
be
do
they
good
within
the
organisation
to
manage
they
caseload
.
we
also
know
that
that
caseload
be
increase
exponentially
,
with
a
consequent
rate
of
attrition
among
social
worker
.
if
we
can
crack
that
nut
collectively
as
between
the
Oireachtas
,
the
Minister
and
Tusla
,
we
will
be
do
a
good
day
's
work
in
respect
of
the
operation
of
Tusla
.
my
only
intervention
today
be
to
see
if
we
can
get
a
great
perspective
,
even
at
this
early
stage
,
in
respect
of
what
the
Oireachtas
need
to
do
or
focus
on
in
respect
of
the
recruitment
issue
and
what
government
could
be
do
in
respect
of
face
that
challenge
.
give
the
competitive
nature
of
the
market
at
present
,
be
the
issue
of
remuneration
a
potential
stumbling
block
?
reason
of
public
expenditure
and
reform
.
I
have
one
final
issue
to
raise
.
I
do
not
expect
a
substantive
answer
at
this
stage
.
I
want
to
put
on
record
the
fact
that
this
committee
have
be
deal
with
matter
in
Scouting
Ireland
and
that
a
helpline
have
now
be
set
up
.
more
than
200
case
,
and
possibly
well
in
excess
of
that
number
,
have
be
report
in
the
Irish
Times
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
relationship
between
the
Oireachtas
and
Tusla
,
my
concern
be
that
there
should
be
some
understanding
of
the
dynamic
between
Tusla
and
Scouting
Ireland
in
respect
of
the
handling
of
that
case
.
if
the
number
of
case
have
go
north
of
200
-
and
there
be
a
Scouting
Ireland
helpline
in
respect
of
that
issue
-
I
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
at
some
point
in
the
future
,
perhaps
when
the
chief
executive
have
be
appoint
,
in
order
to
inform
ourselves
of
the
dynamic
that
exist
with
regard
to
the
handling
of
that
case
.
I
do
not
even
expect
a
response
to
that
point
at
this
juncture
.
I
just
wish
to
put
it
on
the
record
.
that
be
a
worthy
intervention
from
deputy
Sherlock
because
it
be
something
which
ultimately
affect
50000

it
be
important
for
we
,
as
a
committee
,
to
be
able
to
stand
over
the
information
that
come
to
we
from

I
will
start
with
the
helpline
,
as
we
be
on
that
theme
and
to
follow
-
on
from
deputy
Mitchell
.
there
seem
to
be
,
if
I
be
interpret
it
correctly
,
common
ground
emerge
between
Scouting
Ireland
and
Tusla
in
respect
of
the
helpline
.
will
Mr.
Gibson
help
I
to
understand
what
the
independent
review
will
mean
in
real
term
?
if
they
go
to
a
academic
institution
,
what
will
it
be
task
with
do
?
will
it
examine
every
case
and
do
it
have
the
statutory
authority
to
be
able
to
examine
every
case
?
be
it
a
logging
and
document
exercise
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
independent
review
?
if
there
be
clear
statutory
obligation
in
respect
of
the
historical
case
-
I
make
the
distinction
between
the
historical
and
contemporary
-
I
still
do
not
understand
from
what
Mr.
Gibson
state
how
that
process
will
be
manage
.
if
Mr.
Gibson
can
enlighten
I
on
that
in
the
first
instance
,
I
would
be
grateful
.
on
that
,
Scouting
Ireland
will
tell
we
that
it
have
a
team
of
professional
staff
who
have
listen
and
engage
and
it
would
have
notify
Tusla
to
that
effect
.
personally
,
as
one
member
of
the
committee
,
I
take
in
good
faith
that
a
process
be
under
way
in
respect
of
the
historical
case
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
Mr.
Elliott
,
who
have
a
strong
track
record
on
this
,
be
also
involved
in
that
process
and
have
good
form
in
respect
of
Cloyne
and
other
issue
.
I
take
that
in
good
faith
and
I
be
satisfied
with
that
.
I
refer
to
the
18
February
letter
from
Tusla
to
Scouting
Ireland
.
the
explosive
line
in
that
letter
relate
to
the
overnight
.
do
Tusla
have
any
sense
of
the
hurt
and
shock
that
it
would
cause
when
that
letter
go
into
the
public
domain
in
respect
of
the
thousand
of
volunteer
and
parent
who
have
go
through
Garda
vetting
and
child
protection
training
and
would
see
themselves
as
be
protective
and
compliant
in
every
way
?
do
Tusla
have
any
sense
of
the
sheer
hurt
and
the
magnitude
of
that
statement
,
as
well
as
of
the
potential
effect
of
close
down
a
organisation
in
one
fall
swoop
?
one
of
the
main
modus
operandi
of
scouting
be
that
child
experience
overnight
camping
.
the
letter
be
devastating
to
the
thousand
of
innocent
and
decent
people
who
give
hour
of
they
time
to
Scouting
Ireland
,
who
be
dedicate
to
this
lifestyle
,
and
do
so
for
the
common
good
and
the
purpose
of
bring
benefit
to
society
.
do
Tusla
feel
any
regret
for
include
that
in
its
letter
of
18
February
?
with
respect
,
the
letter
come
into
the
public
domain
via
the
minister
herself
on
foot
of
a
topical
issue
matter
which
deputy
Rabbitte
and
I
put
down
.
I
will
not
go
into
the
modality
of
that
now
.
the
fact
be
that
the
letter
be
in
the
public
domain
and
be
put
there
by
the
minister
herself
.
notwithstanding
the
child
safeguarding
statement
and
the
Safety
first
legislation
,
Tusla
be
state
there
be
a
job
of
work
to
be
do
in
respect
of
compliance
with
the
safety
statement
.
that
be
the
role
of
the
professional
staff
in
Scouting
Ireland
.
I
want
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
role
of
the
professional
staff
regard
they
obligation
.
it
be
map
on
to
the
letter
Tusla
send
.
in
three
-
certainly
two
-
of
the
case
,
a
professional
person
in
Scouting
Ireland
make
a
intervention
that
could
be
deem
to
be
inappropriate
in
respect
of
whether
it
be
compliant
with
the
child
safeguarding
statement
.
we
need
to
make
the
distinction
between
that
and
that
episode
.
one
could
argue
that
when
that
incident
occur
,
that
the
volunteer
who
be
on
the
ground
come
in
straight
away
and
notify
the
relevant
person
in
charge
of
safeguard
.
it
be
thereafter
that
there
might
have
be
a
failure
of
process
.
it
be
important
to
make
the
distinction
that
the
volunteer
on
the
ground
,
who
go
through
the
child
protection
training
and
receive
they
instruction
from
the
professional
staff
as
to
they
obligation
,
be
without
blemish
in
this
instance
.
I
want
a
understanding
of
that
dynamic
from
Tusla
.
if
it
acknowledge
this
distinction
today
,
that
will
go
some
way
towards
assuage
the
thousand
of
people
who
perceive
that
Tusla
come
down
heavily
on
volunteer
.
one
have
to
accept
there
be
always
risk
but
,
in
the
main
,
the
bulk
of
volunteer
across
the
country
be
compliant
and
au
None
with
they
obligation
as
parent
and
volunteer
.
it
be
not
subtle
.
it
be
obvious
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
,
as
a
layperson
,
I
interpret
the
letter
from
18
February
as
state
there
be
to
be
certain
action
to
be
carry
out
by
the
person
in
charge
of
safeguard
within
the
organisation
.
it
be
clear
from
the
letter
that
certain
matter
be
not
deal
with
.
again
,
that
be
at
the
professional
staff
level
.
I
reiterate
there
be
a
difference
between
that
level
of
engagement
and
a
parent
's
or
a
volunteer
's
level
of
engagement
on
the
ground
on
a
typical
weekend
.
as
a
parent
,
I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
send
a
child
off
to
a
camp
with
Scouting
Ireland
.
I
be
happy
and
satisfied
that
the
volunteer
be
compliant
with
they
obligation
.
the
committee
need
to
be
satisfied
that
the
process
under
way
with
Scouting
Ireland
be
actually
address
the
issue
of
the
letter
of
18
February
,
that
there
be
a
cascade
effect
regard
child
first
and
that
Tusla
be
satisfied
that
a
process
be
under
way
which
will
give
confidence
to
everybody
,
particularly
that
outside
of
Scouting
Ireland
who
be
not
necessarily
au
fait
with
policy
,
procedure
,
practice
or
the
culture
which
exist
within
the
scouting
family
.
it
be
the
public
which
need
to
have
confidence
on
this
matter
.
when
be
Tusla
meet
Scouting
Ireland
next
?
I
be
sorry
to
interrupt
but
I
must
ask
Mr.
Gibson
to
repeat
what
he
have
just
say
as
I
could
not
hear
he
.
chairman-----
I
be
help
the
chairman
.
it
be
on
he
point
.
the
chairman
have
raise
a
pertinent
issue
.
to
follow
on
from
what
he
say
about
Scouting
Ireland
's
update
on
its
action
plan
,
it
acknowledge
issue
related
to
structural
policy
monitoring
and
what
else
?
scout
Ireland
be
acknowledge
they
be
on
hold
.
I
deduce
from
that
that
they
be
be
actively
work
on
.
on
point
4
of
that
,
relate
to
historical
case
and
the
agree
action
plan
,
if
there
be
some
articulation
back
to
we
about
how
the
historical
case
be
be
deal
with
,
that
would
be
very
helpful
.
my
last
question
relate
to
the
interaction
between
Tusla
and
the
Department
.
Tusla
issue
a
letter
on
18
February
which
clearly
outline
specific
issue
about
the
adherence
to
Children
first
,
the
legislation
,
and
so
on
.
on
21
February
,
the
minister
announce
through
the
Irish
Times
that
State
funding
for
child
protection
improvement
would
be
increase
and
that
€
220000
be
receive
by
Scouting
Ireland
.
I
be
try
to
reconcile
the
concern
of
Tusla
as
of
18
February
,
address
in
the
witness
's
letter
,
and
the
vote
of
confidence
of
the
minister
about
safeguard
procedure
.
it
seem
to
be
incongruous
that
the
minister
or
she
spokesperson
say
it
be
on
the
right
path
.
be
there
a
line
of
communication
between
Tusla
and
the
Minister
's
Department
,
official
or
office
about
concern
that
Tusla
have
on
safeguard
issue
?
have
deputy
Rabbitte
and
I
not
raise
this
as
a
topical
issue
matter
and
if
Mr.
Elliott
have
not
put
the
correspondence
from
Tusla
in
front
of
the
minister
,
which
she
then
put
on
the
public
record
,
we
would
not
be
sit
here
today
.
the
minister
would
have
be
none
the
wise
and
would
have
continue
in
good
faith
to
restore
the
funding
and
make
funding
available
.
Specific
funding
,
some
€
220000
,
be
make
available
for
safeguard
and
that
be
the
question
here
.
we
be
try
to
understand
this
.
I
speak
as
a
former
minister
.
protocol
relate
to
letter
of
this
nature
,
that
relate
to
a
public
issue
which
affect
thousand
of
people
,
be
a
key
component
of
Tusla
's
statutory
work
.
Tusla
be
a
statutory
agency
with
the
power
of
legislation
behind
it
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
one
would
have
think
there
would
be
a
clear
line
of
communication
to
the
minister
's
official
,
if
not
directly
to
the
minister
's
office
,
for
a
response
to
the
granting
of
a
extra
€
220000
for
safeguard
,
which
be
report
on
21
February
,
when
clear
concern
be
raise
by
Tusla
on
18
February
.
be
it
Mr.
Elliott
?
there
be
much
to
try
to
internalise
and
understand
from
the
contribution
.
my
early
intervention
be
base
on
the
idea
that
there
need
to
be
progress
while
we
be
all
move
forward
,
which
mean
the
state
agency
,
the
statutory
body
,
Scouting
Ireland
,
as
a
voluntary
organisation
,
and
we
,
as
member
of
the
Oireachtas
,
be
all
on
a
journey
to
ensure
that
a
organisation
that
be
cherish
within
Irish
society
emerge
strong
as
a
result
of
what
have
happen
.
while
we
be
on
that
journey
,
there
remain
question
to
be
tease
out
.
if
we
have
concern
,
no
matter
how
seemingly
ill
found
they
might
be
,
they
be
nonetheless
concern
.
it
be
important
that
we
reserve
the
right
to
ask
question
,
and
so
do
should
not
be
take
as
have
a
particular
view
on
a
organisation
or
individual
within
it
.
as
deputy
Rabbitte
note
,
she
and
I
raise
the
topical
Issue
matter
but
if
we
have
not
,
we
would
arguably
not
be
have
this
discussion
.
the
motive
for
raise
the
matter
be
predicate
on
the
concern
we
have
that
information
be
enter
the
public
domain
via
the
Irish
Times
and
we
read
the
information
but
there
be
no
mechanism
where
the
minister
would
report
to
we
in
the
committee
or
to
the
Oireachtas
in
respect
of
the
process
.
we
merely
want
to
establish
the
fact
of
the
process
for
the
historical
case
.
I
understand
the
point
Mr.
Elliott
make
about
historical
case
but
give
that
the
number
be
in
the
public
domain
,
we
feel
that
it
be
necessary
to
interrogate
the
process
.
it
be
at
that
juncture
that
the
minister
put
the
Tusla
letter
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
that
lead
I
to
my
first
question
.
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
,
Tusla
,
have
state
on
the
record
that
the
letter
of
18
February
be
not
copy
or
issue
to
any
person
outside
of
Scouting
Ireland
or
Tusla
.
on
Wednesday
,
27
February
2019
,
Tusla
receive
a
request
from
the
Department
to
provide
a
copy
of
the
letter
date
18
February
2019
.
the
Department
have
receive
direct
communication
from
Scouting
Ireland
's
interim
safeguarding
manager
,
Mr.
Ian
Elliott
,
on
Tuesday
,
26
February
2019
in
connection
with
Tusla
's
letter
.
that
letter
be
provide
to
the
Department
,
and
the
minister
read
its
recommendation
into
the
dáil
record
and
late
publish
the
letter
on
the
Department
's
website
.
will
Mr.
Elliott
confirm
he
version
of
event
vis
-à
-
vis
Tusla
's
interpretation
of
event
?
the
letter
exist
-
that
be
a
statement
of
fact
-
and
it
be
send
to
Tusla
.
how
do
the
letter
then
return
to
the
Department
?
do
Mr.
Elliot
furnish
that
letter
to
the
Department
?
by
whom
?
from
the
Department
.
Mr.
Elliott
do
not
send
a
copy
of
the
letter
.
it
be
important
to
make
the
distinction
that
Scouting
Ireland
email
the
Department
-----
-----
but
the
letter
be
seek
by
the
Department
and
Scouting
Ireland
do
not
furnish
it
with
same
.
do
the
two
official
which
Mr.
Elliott
name
say
why
they
want
the
letter
?
the
email
be
send
on
26
February
,
which
coincide
with
the
raising
of
the
topical
issue
matter
in
the
Dáil
.
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
Mr.
Elliott
have
proof
through
the
correspondence
,
a
log
of
the
call
and
so
on
that
it
be
the
departmental
official
who
contact
Scouting
Ireland
.
they
want
a
copy
of
the
letter
.
do
they
say
why
?
how
do
they
know
that
the
letter
exist
?
without
furnish
they
with
the
letter
.
a
question
mark
now
hang
over
this
process
.
we
may
need
to
contact
the
Department
and
the
minister
about
this
issue
,
give
that
she
have
now
arguably
be
put
into
this
process
.
she
stand
before
the
Dáil
and
say
clearly
that
she
be
in
receipt
of
the
letter
.
I
do
not
have
the
transcript
before
I
,
but
she
certainly
say
that
she
have
receive
the
letter
.
Tusla
say
that
it
-----
she
have
receive
the
letter
only
a
matter
of
hour
before
.
I
will
park
that
for
the
time
being
,
as
it
be
pertinent
to
the
issue
and
there
be
now
a
question
mark
over
the
nature
of
the
minister
or
she
Department
's
involvement
in
this
process
.
the
interagency
meeting
be
hold
on
25
February
.
what
transpire
at
that
meeting
?
regard
the
timeline
,
18
February
be
the
date
of
the
letter
and
25
February
be
the
date
of
the
interagency
meeting
.
be
the
18
February
letter
discuss
at
that
25
February
meeting
?
Mr.
Elliott
do
not
receive
it
until
22
February
,
but
the
letter
be
date
18
February
.
be
the
issue
contain
in
the
letter
address
at
the
interagency
meeting
on
25
February
?
Mr.
Elliott
feel
that
,
in
line
with
he
obligation
vis-à
-
vo
he
interaction
with
Tusla
and
give
the
confidentiality
of
this
matter
,
there
should
have
be
a
clear
-----
the
minister
come
into
the
House
on
27
February
,
put
the
letter
of
18
February
into
the
public
domain
and
the
bombshell
be
drop
in
respect
of
the
weekend
and
overnight
,
but
that
issue
have
be
address
prior
to
27
February
in
the
interagency
meeting
.
what
be
the
nature
of
the
discussion
with
the
Garda
?
Mr.
Elliott
get
that
assurance
from
the
Garda
.
will
Mr.
Elliot
explain
that
?
no
case
record
have
be
examine
.
no
staff
member
have
be
interview
.
this
have
open
up
a
whole
new
can
of
worm
.
Tusla
appear
before
we
early
and
give
a
version
of
event
,
and
we
now
have
scout
Ireland
's
interpretation
of
event
.
it
throw
up
a
set
of
new
question
.
I
wish
to
discuss
the
letter
of
18
February
again
.
arise
from
the
evidence
we
have
just
hear
,
there
be
question
to
be
ask
of
the
departmental
official
and
the
minister
in
respect
of
this
matter
.
regard
the
helpline
,
I
will
ask
Mr.
Elliott
to
put
himself
in
the
politician
's
position
for
a
second
.
the
minister
appear
before
the
House
and
put
the
key
point
of
the
Tusla
letter
on
the
record
.
when
a
Oireachtas
Member
hear
the
word
,
"
scout
Ireland
should
consider
the
viability
of
continue
with
overnight
trip
"
,
the
natural
and
immediate
reaction
be
to
wonder
whether
something
explosive
that
we
do
not
know
about
have
happen
and
to
take
the
minister
in
good
faith
.
have
parse
this
situation
out
a
little
further
and
consult
people
on
the
ground
regard
they
obligation
in
respect
of
safeguard
,
and
give
that
overnight
camp
take
place
at
the
weekend
,
there
be
public
confidence
in
matter
at
ground
level
.
notwithstanding
all
of
that
,
legitimate
issue
be
raise
in
the
letter
of
18
February
regard
the
three
case
at
hand
.
they
should
not
be
gloss
over
,
and
I
be
not
say
anyone
have
.
it
be
not
that
the
incident
do
not
take
place
.
there
be
arguably
a
response
at
the
time
by
the
designate
liaison
officer
.
one
could
safely
conclude
that
.
if
there
be
not
,
the
case
would
not
have
be
highlight
in
the
way
they
have
be
.
I
be
not
happy
at
the
manner
in
which
professional
staff
respond
.
for
I
,
the
issue
be
the
manner
in
which
Scouting
Ireland
respond
to
matter
.
I
make
no
apology
in
that
regard
.
in
two
of
the
case
Tusla
highlight
that
the
intervention
and
interrogation
of
child
be
inappropriate
.
that
be
where
the
fail
be
.
we
all
appreciate
and
understand
risk
be
inherent
in
any
voluntary
organisation
,
but
in
this
instance
the
manner
in
which
the
eight
professional
staff
respond
be
inappropriate
.
that
be
the
issue
for
Tusla
.
it
be
mention
that
it
have
be
raise
at
the
inter-
agency
meeting
on
25
February
.
what
be
the
response
of
Tusla
to
Scouting
Ireland
in
raise
it
,
or
do
it
raise
in
the
manner
I
have
just
articulate
it
?
in
the
three
case
.
we
have
the
sample
case
to
go
on
.
I
would
like
to
ask
one
more
question
because
new
information
have
come
to
light
that
be
explosive
.
I
hope
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
discuss
this
issue
again
.
what
be
so
injurious
in
the
letter
from
Tusla
in
respect
of
the
helpline
that
Scouting
Ireland
be
seek
to
refute
it
?
the
letter
state
further
concern
arise
about
the
management
of
a
recent
situation
and
that
confidential
information
be
share
with
a
child
first
information
and
advice
officer
,
CFIAO
,
etc
.
my
impression
from
early
intervention
by
Mr.
Elliott
be
that
it
be
injurious
to
Scouting
Ireland
.
we
be
all
try
to
understand
the
issue
.
I
be
not
a
child
protection
expert
,
but
Mr.
Elliott
be
say
that
,
in
respect
of
case
a
and
case
b
,
Tusla
's
interpretation
of
the
course
of
event
be
incorrect
?
in
other
word
,
there
be
question
mark
over
Tusla
's
interpretation
of
event
in
regard
to
the
intervention
make
by
eight
professional
safeguard
officer
for
Scouting
Ireland
.
what
do
that
mean
?
Mr.
Tennant
read
he
interpretation
of
the
barrister
's
report
,
about
which
I
have
a
number
of
question
,
but
we
do
not
have
time
to
deal
with
they
today
.
we
need
a
further
iteration
in
that
regard
.
as
it
be
almost
3
p.m.
,
this
be
almost
we
fifth
hour
of
meeting
and
I
be
very
conscious
the
member
of
Scouting
Ireland
who
be
before
we
as
witness
and
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
have
be
here
since
we
start
at
10
a.m
.
I
thank
all
of
they
for
they
participation
,
as
I
thank
the
member
for
they
diligence
and
attendance
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
.
there
be
a
great
many
positive
aspect
to
be
highlight
in
any
such
environment
,
particularly
this
one
,
as
to
the
effort
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
in
the
context
of
why
we
be
here
,
it
be
even
more
important
that
we
get
to
grip
with
some
of
the
detail
.
to
echo
some
of
the
comment
of
deputy
Mitchell
,
from
a
personal
perspective
,
not
just
scouter
and
legislator
but
parent
be
rightly
horrify
by
some
of
the
example
and
this
elicit
a
emotional
response
.
as
a
parent
,
a
emotional
response
when
it
come
to
the
protection
of
one
's
child
manifest
itself
in
various
way
.
for
some
parent
,
the
decision
they
might
make
with
regard
to
future
or
continue
involvement
with
Scouting
Ireland
,
or
whatever
the
decision
might
be
as
a
parent
,
be
clearly
justify
in
the
context
of
that
emotional
response
.
it
be
very
clear
to
the
member
and
that
who
have
be
observe
this
proceedings
for
the
past
five
hour
that
there
be
question
relate
to
what
have
be
put
into
the
public
domain
by
the
minister
and
there
be
response
that
will
have
to
be
provide
by
Scouting
Ireland
in
conjunction
with
Tusla
.
however
,
personally
speak
,
I
be
very
pleased
to
hear
it
reiterate
over
and
over
that
Scouting
Ireland
be
not
in
conflict
with
Tusla
and
be
work
with
it
.
that
provide
the
opportunity
to
restore
the
trust
that
,
in
fairness
,
and
I
be
not
alone
in
say
this
,
Scouting
Ireland
have
be
work
steadfastly
to
rebuild
follow
the
announcement
in
January
or
February
of
2018
that
there
be
historical
case
file
that
be
throw
up
difficulty
for
the
movement
in
this
country
.
from
my
own
perspective
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
we
and
,
if
not
present
they
side
,
present
a
robust
response
to
the
position
they
find
themselves
in
.
I
thank
the
member
for
they
engagement
,
the
Scouting
Ireland
representative
for
make
themselves
available
at
short
notice
previously
and
this
afternoon
and
the
Tusla
representative
who
come
before
we
and
provide
we
with
a
great
deal
of
information
.
as
deputy
Sherlock
illustrate
,
there
be
a
series
of
question
,
some
of
which
perhaps
come
to
light
a
little
early
in
the
process
but
be
not
put
into
the
public
domain
in
regard
to
the
information
we
all
come
to
find
.
we
need
to
look
at
that
.
I
ask
Tusla
what
I
feel
be
a
legitimate
question
,
namely
,
whether
the
child
of
Ireland
be
serve
by
this
document
find
its
way
into
the
public
domain
.
if
the
member
of
this
committee
have
be
present
with
such
a
incendiary
document
,
would
we
have
make
a
decision
to
put
it
into
the
public
domain
or
would
we
have
carefully
consider
how
good
to
respond
to
it
,
to
engage
with
Scouting
Ireland
either
publicly
or
privately
,
and
to
engage
with
Tusla
either
publicly
or
privately
?
I
be
not
100
%
convinced
,
as
Tusla
allude
to
,
that
the
good
thing
in
this
case
be
what
have
occur
.
I
do
not
need
to
dwell
on
it
for
long
than
that
as
I
have
make
my
point
clear
from
the
start
of
this
proceedings
five
hour
ago
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
attendance
,
participation
and
response
and
,
indeed
,
for
they
volunteer
spirit
in
everything
they
do
.
the
committee
will
adjourn
until
10
a.m.
on
Wednesday

27
March
2019

when
it
will
meet

and
the
Irish

its

if

would

whether

if

,
namely
,
whether
the
child
of
Ireland
be
serve
by
this
document
find
its
way
into
the
public
domain
.
if
the
member
of
this
committee
have
be
present
with
such
a
incendiary
document
,
would
we
have
make
a
decision
to
put
it
into
the
public
domain
or
would
we
have
carefully
consider
how
good
to
respond
to
it
,
to
engage
with
Scouting
Ireland
either
publicly
or
privately
,
and
to
engage
with
Tusla
either
publicly
or
privately
?
I
be
not
100
%
convinced
,
as
Tusla
allude
to
,
that
the
good
thing
in
this
case
be
what
have
occur
.
I
do
not
need
to
dwell
on
it
for
long
than
that
as
I
have
make
my
point
clear
from
the
start
of
this
proceedings
five
hour
ago
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
attendance
,
participation
and
response
and
,
indeed
,
for
they
volunteer
spirit
in
everything
they
do
.
the
committee
will
adjourn
until
10
a.m.
on
Wednesday
,
27
March
2019
,
when
it
will
meet
representative
of
the
Irish
Foster
Care
Association
and
the
Irish
Association
of
social
worker
to
continue
its
consideration
of
the
topic
of
recruitment
and
retention
of
social
worker
.
as
it
be
almost
3
p.m.
,
this
be
almost
we
fifth
hour
of
meeting
and
I
be
very
conscious
the
member
of
Scouting
Ireland
who
be
before
we
as
witness
and
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
have
be
here
since
we
start
at
10
a.m
.
I
thank
all
of
they
for
they
participation
,
as
I
thank
the
member
for
they
diligence
and
attendance
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
.
there
be
a
great
many
positive
aspect
to
be
highlight
in
any
such
environment
,
particularly
this
one
,
as
to
the
effort
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
in
the
context
of
why
we
be
here
,
it
be
even
more
important
that
we
get
to
grip
with
some
of
the
detail
.
to
echo
some
of
the
comment
of
deputy
Mitchell
,
from
a
personal
perspective
,
not
just
scouter
and
legislator
but
parent
be
rightly
horrify
by
some
of
the
example
and
this
elicit
a
emotional
response
.
as
a
parent
,
a
emotional
response
when
it
come
to
the
protection
of
one
's
child
manifest
itself
in
various
way
.
for
some
parent
,
the
decision
they
might
make
with
regard
to
future
or
continue
involvement
with
Scouting
Ireland
,
or
whatever
the
decision
might
be
as
a
parent
,
be
clearly
justify
in
the
context
of
that
emotional
response
.
it
be
very
clear
to
the
member
and
that
who
have
be
observe
this
proceedings
for
the
past
five
hour
that
there
be
question
relate
to
what
have
be
put
into
the
public
domain
by
the
minister
and
there
be
response
that
will
have
to
be
provide
by
Scouting
Ireland
in
conjunction
with
Tusla
.
however
,
personally
speak
,
I
be
very
pleased
to
hear
it
reiterate
over
and
over
that
Scouting
Ireland
be
not
in
conflict
with
Tusla
and
be
work
with
it
.
that
provide
the
opportunity
to
restore
the
trust
that
,
in
fairness
,
and
I
be
not
alone
in
say
this
,
Scouting
Ireland
have
be
work
steadfastly
to
rebuild
follow
the
announcement
in
January
or
February
of
2018
that
there
be
historical
case
file
that
be
throw
up
difficulty
for
the
movement
in
this
country
.
from
my
own
perspective
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
we
and
,
if
not
present
they
side
,
present
a
robust
response
to
the
position
they
find
themselves
in
.
I
thank
the
member
for
they
engagement
,
the
Scouting
Ireland
representative
for
make
themselves
available
at
short
notice
previously
and
this
afternoon
and
the
Tusla
representative
who
come
before
we
and
provide
we
with
a
great
deal
of
information
.
as
deputy
Sherlock
illustrate
,
there
be
a
series
of
question
,
some
of
which
perhaps
come
to
light
a
little
early
in
the
process
but
be
not
put
into
the
public
domain
in
regard
to
the
information
we
all
come
to
find
.
we
need
to
look
at
that
.
I
ask
Tusla
what
I
feel
be
a
legitimate
question
,
namely
,
whether
the
child
of
Ireland
be
serve
by
this
document
find
its
way
into
the
public
domain
.
if
the
member
of
this
committee
have
be
present
with
such
a
incendiary
document
,
would
we
have
make
a
decision
to
put
it
into
the
public
domain
or
would
we
have
carefully
consider
how
good
to
respond
to
it
,
to
engage
with
Scouting
Ireland
either
publicly
or
privately
,
and
to
engage
with
Tusla
either
publicly
or
privately
?
I
be
not
100
%
convinced
,
as
Tusla
allude
to
,
that
the
good
thing
in
this
case
be
what
have
occur
.
I
do
not
need
to
dwell
on
it
for
long
than
that
as
I
have
make
my
point
clear
from
the
start
of
this
proceedings
five
hour
ago
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
attendance
,
participation
and
response
and
,
indeed
,
for
they
volunteer
spirit
in
everything
they
do
.
the
committee
will
adjourn
until
10
a.m.
on
Wednesday
,
27
March
2019
,
when
it
will
meet
representative
of
the
Irish
Foster
Care
Association
and
the
Irish
Association
of
social
worker
to
continue
its
consideration
of
the
topic
of
recruitment
and
retention
of
social
worker
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
be
here
today
.
this
meeting
be
certainly
assist
we
in
understand
the
dynamic
between
the
IFCA
,
the
people
it
represent
,
and
officialdom
.
how
would
the
witness
characterise
the
IFCA
's
relationship
with
Tusla
?
be
it
a
positive
relationship
?
do
the
IFCA
leadership
feel
it
be
be
listen
to
and
its
recommendation
be
bear
some
fruit
?
the
witness
note
that
foster
carer
do
not
have
a
link
social
worker
.
that
suggest
to
I
that
there
be
a
big
gap
.
the
foster
carer
and
the
child
have
the
right
to
a
social
worker
.
could
the
risk
increase
dramatically
if
the
relationship
between
the
carer
and
the
child
deteriorate
in
any
way
?
if
we
do
not
have
a
accurate
figure
for
how
many
of
the
5000
child
in
foster
care
arrangement
be
without
a
link
social
worker
,
there
be
a
possible
or
potential
risk
of
some
of
that
relationship
be
in
a
state
of
disrepair
.
we
might
not
know
that
.
the
theme
here
be
recruitment
and
retention
.
we
be
try
to
plug
that
gap
,
so
to
speak
.
if
there
be
no
link
social
worker
for
a
particular
family
and
issue
arise
for
the
foster
carer
or
the
child
,
the
risk
be
offset
by
a
mechanism
allow
the
foster
carer
to
contact
the
IFCA
via
the
helpline
.
do
recourse
exist
for
a
child
where
he
or
she
be
at
risk
?
we
assume
the
relationship
be
benign
and
positive
and
we
concur
with
Ms
bond
about
the
good
work
do
by
people
who
care
for
child
in
a
foster
arrangement
.
we
have
to
have
regard
,
however
,
to
the
fact
that
if
there
be
a
shortage
of
social
worker
,
the
risk
profile
increase
and
child
protection
issue
become
even
more
prevalent
.
if
there
be
5000
child
in
foster
care
arrangement
,
and
like
the
witness
we
do
not
have
exact
figure
,
there
be
a
major
gap
in
the
service
and
the
risk
to
child
be
potentially
increase
.
that
be
my
impression
.
perhaps
the
witness
can
disavow
I
of
that
or
help
I
to
understand
further
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Murphy
correctly
,
some
foster
carer
do
not
have
a
link
social
worker
and
as
such
they
do
not
have
access
to
support
as
require
.
if
I
interpret
that
correctly
,
he
be
say
there
be
gap
.
do
the
IFCA
have
a
numerical
analysis
of
the
gap
?
how
many
child
be
without
a
link
social
worker
at
present
?
there
be
nobody
in
the
system
who
be
literally
cast
adrift
.
this
discussion
be
all
about
develop
we
understanding
of
the
dynamic
.
who
exactly
be
on
the
foster
care
committee
?
I
refer
again
to
recruitment
and
retention
.
the
former
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
be
now
chair
of
Tusla
.
he
come
before
the
committee
some
week
ago
and
the
recruitment
and
retention
of
social
worker
be
a
key
area
that
he
want
to
discuss
.
in
parallel
with
the
IFCA
,
he
also
raise
bridging
education
that
would
upskill
social
care
staff
.
if
people
have
identify
this
as
a
issue
that
have
be
ongoing
for
many
year
,
why
have
the
system
not
bridg
that
gap
?
why
be
it
that
instead
of
go
back
into
full
-
time
education
,
social
care
staff
cannot
do
a
bridging
or
postgraduate
course
that
would
see
they
suitably
qualified
?
what
be
the
IFCA
's
perception
of
the
gap
there
?
why
have
that
not
happen
?
it
be
suggest
that
bursary
could
be
provide
by
Tusla
.
demand
for
foster
care
place
be
increase
.
the
figure
be
approximately
6000
in
care
and
5000
in
foster
care
.
how
do
we
encourage
people
to
become
foster
carer
or
foster
parent
,
to
use
that
expression
?
where
be
the
gap
and
why
be
more
people
not
take
up
that
challenge
?
would
Ms
bond
characterise
the
challenge
that
foster
carer
face
at
the
moment
as
be
extremely
difficult
in
the
main
?
the
perception
I
have
be
that
for
foster
carer
,
the
placement
can
be
quite
difficult
if
they
do
not
have
support
.
presumably
foster
carer
be
constantly
fight
with
the
HSE
and
Tusla
for
additional
service
.
I
sincerely
thank
the
witness
for
be
here
today
.
five
minute
do
not
do
justice
to
the
wide
submission
IFCA
supply
to
the
committee
and
I
sincerely
thank
they
for
articulate
a
way
forward
for
we
,
as
a
committee
,
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
recruitment
and
retention
.
I
also
thank
Ms
McGuirk
for
defend
she
colleague
because
we
live
in
time
where
it
be
easy
to
beat
up
on
the
social
worker
and
he
or
she
,
in
a
judicial
or
societal
setting
,
can
be
see
as
the
easy
target
for
public
opprobrium
.
while
there
have
be
case
in
the
recent
past
and
historically
,
relate
to
the
quality
of
engagement
with
social
worker
,
that
be
the
exception
and
not
the
norm
.
I
have
a
appreciation
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
and
we
deliberation
on
this
issue
of
recruitment
and
retention
generally
,
that
it
be
the
hidden
work
,
which
be
undocumented
,
define
the
quality
of
the
engagement
.
one
can
not
put
a
hiqa
,
stamp
on
or
tick
a
box
for
the
relationship
building
,
which
be
vital
to
sustain
the
very
system
that
we
have
.
again
,
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
attendance
here
today
and
for
they
important
submission
because
we
now
have
something
on
which
we
can
roll
up
we
sleeve
.
I
would
like
to
be
educate
on
the
day
-
to
-
day
role
of
a
social
worker
.
my
first
question
be
on
child
protection
and
the
welfare
of
child
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
interaction
on
foster
care
but
I
want
to
well
understand
how
a
case
be
triage
when
it
come
in
the
front
door
of
Tusla
or
any
other
agency
.
how
do
a
child
protection
case
land
on
the
desk
of
a
social
worker
?
we
have
a
good
interaction
on
foster
care
but
I
would
like
to
discuss
child
protection
.
how
do
a
social
worker
,
typically
,
secure
a
care
order
?
where
be
the
social
worker
in
the
peck
order
in
respect
of
the
legal
framework
to
secure
a
care
order
?
let
we
say
a
social
worker
must
go
to
court
.
what
do
a
typical
social
worker
have
to
do
from
the
time
a
case
land
on
the
desk
front
-
of
-
house
to
secure
a
care
order
?
how
much
paperwork
be
involved
?
once
the
care
order
be
successfully
apply
for
,
what
be
the
ratio
of
contact
time
to
administrative
time
?
be
it
50:50
or
80:20
?
do
a
social
worker
now
have
to
do
much
more
administrative
work
with
much
less
contact
time
?
be
that
,
within
the
exist
cohort
of
social
worker
,
have
a
bear
on
outcome
for
the
relationship
between
the
social
worker
and
the
child
?
have
that
contribute
to
a
malaise
or
a
set
of
circumstance
whereby
a
social
worker
,
after
a
couple
of
year
,
face
burnout
and
decide
to
leave
he
or
she
post
cite
a
inability
to
deal
with
the
work
any
more
?
how
can
the
nature
of
the
relationship
be
change
in
such
a
way
that
there
be
a
large
quotient
of
social
worker
,
a
manageable
workload
and
family
-
friendly
hour
?
social
work
be
a
female
dominate
profession
.
woman
,
in
particular
,
will
inevitably
have
family
.
what
arrangement
be
put
in
place
for
a
female
social
worker
who
want
to
continue
in
she
profession
yet
want
the
requisite
time
off
and
work
within
hour
that
meet
the
need
of
she
own
family
while
allow
she
to
continue
professionally
,
progress
careerwise
and
so
on
?
I
have
offload
a
load
of
issue
.
I
have
a
picture
in
my
own
mind
about
social
work
but
the
witness
will
present
a
picture
that
will
help
we
to
deal
with
the
key
issue
of
recruitment
and
retention
.
I
ask
they
to
paint
a
picture
for
we
of
some
of
the
point
that
I
have
outline
it
will
prove
very
useful
.
the
local
election
be
come
if
Mr.
McCarthy
want
to
put
on
the
jersey
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
Mr.
McCarthy
be
make
,
but
to
assist
we
and
notwithstand
the
fact
that
I
make
a
lot
of
point
to
he
early
,
where
for
instance
a
case
come
in
,
be
triage
and
go
on
for
further
assessment
,
if
the
case
go
to
court
and
a
care
order
be
require
,
I
have
a
number
of
question
arise
from
that
.
I
will
be
as
brief
as
possible
,
allow
for
the
amount
of
time
I
have
available
,
and
forgive
I
if
I
take
a
lot
of
time
at
the
start
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
social
worker
in
the
court
setting
?
what
be
the
contact
time
versus
the
administrative
time
?
I
would
like
to
have
a
understanding
of
that
two
dynamic
from
we
committee
's
interaction
today
with
the
Irish
Association
of
social
worker
.
the
new
chair
of
Tusla
speak
about
brid
course
to
get
people
from
social
care
to
social
work
.
what
be
the
view
of
the
association
on
that
suggestion
?
how
be
academia
and
Tusla
deal
with
this
idea
?
everybody
have
acknowledge
and
know
the
problem
of
recruitment
.
should
we
be
put
good
therapeutic
solution
and
counselling
in
place
for
social
worker
themselves
who
work
in
child
protection
setting
?
should
we
be
design
family
friendly
policy
for
social
worker
?
all
of
this
thematic
area
could
contribute
to
a
good
outcome
for
social
worker
themselves
and
,
ultimately
and
most
importantly
,
for
child
and
family
.
okay
.
be
the
social
worker
,
however
,
subject
to
cross-examination
?
there
be
massive
element
of
stress
involve
in
that
.
however
,
they
be
represent
by
a
solicitor
.
my
understanding
be
develop
now
.
if
the
social
worker
go
into
court
he
or
she
be
represent
in
a
adversarial
system
.
presumably
,
the
social
worker
historically
would
have
make
the

I
be
assume
this
and
Mr.
McCarthy
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong

we
now
have
a
system
where
there
be
a
guardian

a
social

presumably
the
guardian
ad

have
legal

,
the
social

have
legal
representation
,
the
child
be
represent
by
the
guardian

then
there
be
the

there
could
be
five
or

probably
a

on

there
could
be
a

be
Mr.

say
that
the

he
can
tell
we

be
then
task
with
do
the

of

several
more

they

Tusla
would
prosecute
in
the
event
that
a
service
be
unregulated
.
I
welcome
the
witness
before
we
today
.
I
want
to
start
by
say
that
I
have
much
sympathy
for
the
predicament
that
parent
find
themselves
in
at
present
,
particularly
that
parent
whose
child
be
attend
some
of
this
facility
as
we
speak
and
who
be
absolutely
and
utterly
conflicted
about
send
they
child
to
this
facility
but
have
no
other
choice
other
than
to
go
back
to
this
facility
because
they
have
no
alternative
arrangement
.
such
parent
seek
clarity
from
we
as
to
whether
the
interaction
we
be
have
today
will
provide
some
degree
of
confidence
to
that
parent
.
as
a
parent
,
if
my
child
be
in
any
of
that
facility
and
I
have
no
choice
but
to
send
my
child
there
,
I
would
be
rack
with
guilt
,
feel
ambivalent
about
what
I
should
be
do
and
I
know
for
a
fact
that
some
of
the
child
have
be
withdraw
from
such
facility
because
I
have
be
talk
to
some
of
the
parent
of
that
child
.
I
be
not
sure
I
have
hear
anything
today
that
would
give
I
crumb
of
confidence
or
give
that
parent
grounds
for
confidence
.
I
want
to
make
that
point
at
the
very
start
.
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
everything
I
have
hear
today
point
back
to
Tusla
say
it
be
revert
to
child
first
guideline
.
early
,
the
acting
chief
executive
state
:
it
be
important
to
state
in
the
clear
term
possible
,
however
,
that
Tusla
's
early
year
inspectorate
have
no
evidence
of
the
serious
child
protection
concern
or
the
high
degree
of
serious
non-compliance
with
standard
that
be
show
in
the
RTÉ
programme
.
indeed
,
the
behaviour
display
be
unlikely
ever
to
be
evident
during
a
inspection
and
we
rely
on
good
governance
practice
and
appropriate
mandatory
reporting
under
child
first
or
through
Tusla
's
unsolicited
information
office
for
the
notification
of
child
protection
concern
.
to
parse
the
language
,
Mr.
Smyth
be
say
that
if
people
do
not
report
child
protection
concern
to
Tusla
within
the
facility
themselves
,
as
childcare
worker
,
Tusla
have
no
way
of
know
what
be
go
on
.
be
that
correct
?
I
want
straight
answer
from
Mr.
Smyth
,
please
.
I
appreciate
that
and
we
have
be
through
that
.
I
appreciate
all
of
that
.
my
time
be
limited
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
ambiguous
,
I
want
clear
answer
.
Mr.
Smyth
be
say
that
if
the
Children
first
and
mandatory
reporting
guideline
be
not
be
adhere
to
by
the
staff
on
the
ground
in
the
facility
,
if
they
be
not
compliant
,
then
Tusla
have
no
way
of
know
what
be
go
on
outside
of
the
inspection
that
it
carry
out
.
be
that
correct
?
please
answer
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
.
that
be
what
we
be
talk
about
.
on
that
basis
,
it
be
reasonable
to
objectively
say
that
the
regulatory
regime
be
not
work
comprehensively
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
a
parent
can
have
absolute
confidence
that
the
misbehaviour
,
put
it
mildly
,
that
we
see
in
that
programme
be
deal
with
.
there
be
absolutely
no
guarantee
for
any
parent
,
across
the
country
,
that
the
regulatory
and
inspectorate
regime
can
move
across
or
cover
that
type
of
eventuality
.
I
be
make
a
point
.
I
again
go
back
to
Mr.
Smyth
's
submission
.
Hyde
and
seek
have
be
on
the
radar
of
Tusla
for
quite
some
time
and
Mr.
Smyth
have
clearly
articulate
that
to
we
today
.
do
he
ever
look
at
the
culture
that
exist
within
Hyde
and
seek
?
be
he
ever
concerned
about
the
management
structure
of
Hyde
and
seek
such
that
it
might
be
difficult
for
a
individual
childcare
worker
,
if
he
or
she
have
concern
,
to
find
a
mechanism
to
air
that
concern
in
a
way
that
would
ensure
that
they
would
be
protect
,
short
of
make
a
protect
disclosure
or
go
to
Tusla
's
-----
-----unsolicited
information
office
?
my
fear
be
for
junior
staff
who
might
be
afraid
,
if
a
particular
regime
exist
,
to
make
know
they
concern
because
of
the
potential
repercussion
that
might
be
visit
upon
they
if
they
make
a
complaint
.
it
happen
across
business
and
in
the
public
and
private
sector
.
be
there
a
flaw
in
the
inspectorate
regime
if
it
do
not
pick
up
on
that
type
of
conflict
when
talk
to
staff
during
inspection
?
when
?
be
that
through
the
prism
of
RTÉ
?
when
?
the
timeline
here
be
very
important
,
chairman
.
what
do
Tusla
say
to
parent
-----
nobody
be
suggest
that
the
vast
bulk
of
facility
be
beyond
reproach
.
let
we
nail
that
to
the
mast
.
that
be
self
-
evident
because
we
have
relationship
in
we
constituency
with
childcare
facility
and
they
be
excellent
.
I
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
what
I
would
call
junior
staff
,
as
oppose
to
management
staff
,
who
be
work
under
duress
in
some
instance
in
this
facility
.
however
,
there
be
a
systemic
failure
somewhere
because
if
there
be
not
,
we
would
not
be
sit
here
today
and
we
would
not
have
witness
the
scene
we
witness
on
the
RTÉ
programme
.
what
I
be
try
to
do
be
nail
down
where
the
obligation
lie
.
there
be
obligation
regard
mandatory
reporting
and
there
seem
to
have
be
a
failure
somewhere
in
that
respect
and
we
need
to
address
that
failure
.
similarly
,
parent
listen
to
this
discussion
will
hear
some
sympathetic
language
about
improve
the
quality
of
the
conversation
with
parent
and
involve
they
more
in
respect
of
policy
and
so
on
.
however
,
if
a
parent
who
send
he
or
she
child
to
one
of
this
crech
today
have
a
inkling
that
something
be
go
on
,
he
or
she
will
not
go
to
the
Tusla
website
or
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
website
to
check
the
criterion
.
they
would
not
necessarily
act
on
they
instinct
because
they
have
trust
that
the
regulatory
regime
be
robust
enough
to
ensure
they
child
be
protect
.
that
be
a
failure
in
the
system
.
as
mention
by
other
speaker
,
we
need
to
get
to
a
point
now
,
arise
from
this
episode
,
where
parent
be
give
power
on
a
statutory
basis
to
be
part
of
a
communication
set
-
up
,
so
to
speak
,
with
whatever
facility
they
child
happen
to
be
in
or
attend
in
a
way
that
ensure
there
be
proper
communication
with
they
because
they
be
be
leave
out
of
the
loop
.
I
repeat
that
parent
be
rack
with
guilt
.
I
be
a
parent
.
I
be
rack
with
guilt
watch
that
programme
.
one
could
not
but
be
rack
with
guilt
.
Parent
already
feel
guilty
send
they
child
to
childcare
daily
,
give
the
society
we
live
in
where
the
two
parent
have
to
work
.
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
address
and
engage
with
the
academic
about
whom
Ms
McNally
speak
because
it
be
we
intention
to
have
a
second
committee
hearing
,
for
which
I
thank
the
Chairman
,
to
which
that
academic
will
be
invite
because
it
be
important
that
we
kick
the
tyre
,
so
to
speak
,
in
respect
of
what
the
witness
be
tell
we
and
have
a
robust
discussion
.
we
will
need
to
hear
from
parent
also
in
respect
of
what
we
be
hear
today
.
I
want
to
drill
down
into
the
programme
.
obviously
,
the
people
work
undercover
make
representation
,
disclosure
or
notify
Tusla
.
I
be
concerned
that
too
much
time
elapse
between
the
notification
by
that
undercover
worker
and
the
lack
of
communication
with
parent
such
that
some
parent
be
not
notify
other
than
via
RTÉ
.
nobody
be
blame
RTÉ
.
it
have
do
a
public
service
on
this
issue
.
however
,
the
parent
want
to
know
why
Tusla
do
not
phone
they
to
notify
they
this
be
go
on
and
if
they
could
be
give
a
guarantee
that
they
child
will
be
safe
in
the
intervene
period
.
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
Mr.
Lee
say
that
already
.
let
I
be
clear
.
when
an-----
what
I
want
clarify
be
when
the
undercover
reporter
-
worker
notify
Tusla
of
they
concern
,
aside
from
RTÉ
,
as
a
corporate
body
,
write
to
Tusla
.
in
the
period
from
April
to
July
there
be
child
in
a
facility
who
could
have
be
subject
to
the
behaviour
we
have
witness
and
who
could
have
be
at
risk
.
I
be
tread
very
carefully
.
there
be
the
law
and
there
be
the
regulation
but
then
there
be
right
and
wrong
.
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
be
right
and
wrong
,
no
matter
what
the
law
state
,
if
one
be
in
receipt
of
information
in
April
,
one
should
not
take
the
bureaucratic
path
.
I
have
two
final
point
.
I
would
like
to
take
the
same
amount
of
time
as
the
Chairman
take
.
we
need
to
create
a
culture
in
which
there
be
adequate
parental
representation
,
because
parent
need
to
have
a
voice
in
all
of
this
.
access
for
parent
via
cctv
or
app
have
to
be
look
at
.
be
there
a
requirement
on
the
manager
and
owner
of
a
crèche
or
child
care
facility
,
who
also
work
in
the
crèche
,
to
have
all
the
necessary
qualification
?
I
also
put
a
question
on
management
.
can
Tusla
take
special
measure
,
short
of
close
a
facility
,
if
it
need
to
do
so
in
case
of
a
failure
of
management
?
that
need
to
be
look
at
.

I

the
representative
for

before
the
committee
.
I
do
not
doubt
but
that
they
seek
to
make
a
genuine
effort
to
tackle
this
sensitive
issue
.
a
common
theme
which
be
emerge
here
be
that
of
resource
.
I
acknowledge
the
role
play
by
the
former
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
in
seek
to
progress
matter
,
particularly
in
mental
health
,
and
the
challenge
she
face
in
try
to
get
a
great
slice
of
the
health
budget
assign
to
mental
health
.
I
understand
the
constraint
.
I
will
speak
specifically
on
Cork
.
how
many
inpatient
bed
be
there
in
Cork
at
present
?
that
will
be
the
operational
number
.
how
many
be
there
now
?
be
they
at
capacity
every
night
of
the
week
?
I
know
.
my
motivation
in
ask
be
,
whether
or
not
there
be
full
occupancy
,
in
a
effort
to
understand
the
culture
that
exist
within
the
acute
inpatient
facility
.
I
be
try
to
have
some
degree
of
knowledge
about
the
decision
-
making
process
whereby
a
person
find
himself
or
herself
in
one
of
the
this
unit
.
due
to
the
culture
or
decision
making
process
,
there
be
situation
from
time
to
time
when
some
of
that
bed
be
leave
vacant
for
prolonged
period
when
there
be
clear
evidence
of
a
demand
for
they
.
I
do
not
have
sight
of
that
and
Mr.
Ryan
might
not
be
able
to
give
a
answer
on
it
today
,
but
I
would
be
happy
to
revisit
it
with
he
and
the
HSE
at
a
future
meeting
.
if
there
be
such
a
demand
for
service
and
if
it
be
the
case
that
there
be
empty
bed
,
there
be
a
disparity
that
must
be
address
.
I
do
not
wish
to
extrapolate
too
much
from
what
Dr.
Doody
say
or
to
put
word
in
he
mouth
,
but
he
refer
to
Linn
Dara
versus
the
Cork
facility
,
Eist
Linn
.
Eist
Linn
be
a
refurbish
facility
.
would
that
come
up
to
the
mark
as
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
or
appropriate
setting
post
-
refurbishment
for
the
type
of
structure
he
just
speak
about
?
my
time
be
brief
and
I
will
refer
back
to
Dr.
Doody
on
the
Cork
facility
at
a
future
date
as
there
be
further
question
to
be
ask
about
it
to
shed
light
on
,
and
understand
well
,
the
dynamic
that
inform
the
running
of
the
facility
.
there
have
be
legitimate
question
in
the
past
about
the
culture
that
exist
there
.
there
be
130
individual
wait
more
than
18
month
for
camh
assessment
in
my
neck
of
the
wood
.
if
I
be
read
information
relate
to
intervention
correctly
,
and
without
put
word
in
anybody
's
mouth
,
the
term
"
resource
"
be
the
key
.
it
be
prevent
child
and
family
in
my
area
from
receive
proper
assessment
.
I
understand
there
be
a
multidisciplinary
team
and
that
there
be
constraint
with
regard
to
recruitment
and
so
forth
.
have
the
HSE
examine
the
multidisciplinary
team
model
with
regard
to
reduce
the
number
on
the
waiting
list
in
such
a
way
as
to
redeploy
resource
from
other
area
or
through
outside
recruitment
on
short
-
term
contract
or
by
ensure
that
with
proper
supervision
it
might
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
psychiatrist
who
would
make
the
initial
assessment
and
it
could
be
somebody
else
under
the
supervision
of
a
psychiatrist
?
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
family
I
know
must
be
able
to
get
assessment
.
if
we
be
talk
about
stave
off
problem
down
the
line
,
as
deputy
Lisa
Chambers
mention
,
intervention
at
the
early
stage
be
require
.
that
be
self
-
evident
,
and
I
be
not
a
physician
.
it
can
prevent
many
problem
down
the
line
.
be
more
imaginative
solution
be
consider
at
present
to
ensure
we
can
get
the
waiting
list
down
in
spite
of
the
capacity
and
resource
constraint
?
I
apologise
for
cut
across
Mr.
Ryan
but
Dr.
Doody
be
say
that
50
%
be
see
within
four
week
.
I
have
130
family
wait
18
month
.
that
be
base
on
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
,
which
be
Mr.
Ryan
's
reply
.
there
be
a
big
gap
there
.
what
be
good
international
practice
vis-à
-
vis
the
multidisciplinary
team
?
be
it
a
flat
structure
or
be
it
a
hierarchical
structure
whereby
the
psychiatrist
be
the
head
honcho
,
as
it
be
?
be
that
good
international
practice
or
do
it
differ
in
other
country
?
I
will
follow
up
with
Mr.
Ryan
.
we
might
have
a
meeting
in
Cork
in
respect
of
service
there
.

the

I
welcome
Mr.
Gloster
and
he
colleague
to
the
committee
.
I
congratulate
he
on
he
appointment
as
ceo
.
it
be
heartening
to
hear
that
he
have
some
experience
as
a
front
-
line
professional
in
this
space
.
that
give
we
some
grounds
for
comfort
.
I
be
also
encourage
by
he
attempt
to
ensure
a
transparent
process
in
which
we
as
public
representative
be
see
as
key
stakeholder
in
communication
and
the
transparency
of
Tusla
's
function
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
culture
of
the
organisation
.
Mr.
Gloster
have
speak
about
ensure
a
process
of
local
ownership
.
I
do
not
fully
understand
what
that
mean
.
be
he
talk
about
flatten
the
structure
and
get
rid
of
silo
?
what
do
that
mean
for
social
care
worker
,
social
worker
,
childcare
worker
or
anybody
under
the
employ
of
Tusla
?
we
have
to
move
beyond
word
and
take
action
.
every
person
work
in
the
organisation
must
feel
he
or
she
have
a
pathway
right
to
the
top
.
there
must
be
no
Chinese
wall
.
I
would
like
Mr.
Gloster
's
perspective
on
that
.
I
welcome
that
.
my
second
question
be
a
programmatic
one
.
the
school
completion
programme
,
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
and
the
creative
community
alternative
pilot
programme
be
under
way
.
they
be
three
key
programme
.
I
ask
Mr.
Gloster
for
he
perspective
on
ensure
proper
standard
in
the
school
completion
programme
and
standardisation
across
the
country
.
on
the
guardian
ad
litem
legislation
before
the
House
,
what
be
the
full
year
cost
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
?
what
transition
planning
be
take
place
to
code
the
service
to
the
Department
and
what
be
Mr.
Gloster
's
perspective
of
how
the
transition
be
proceed
?
as
a
public
representative
I
already
see
the
outworking
of
the
creative
community
alternative
programme
,
even
though
it
be
a
pilot
.
it
be
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
ground
.
I
be
familiar
with
Cloyne
Diocesan
Youth
Service
,
CDYS
,
in
north
Cork
,
a
organisation
that
be
probably
typical
of
the
many
organisation
that
act
as
agent
for
this
programme
.
CDYS
be
concerned
that
there
will
be
staff
lay
-
off
if
its
funding
be
not
continue
into
2020
.
be
it
envisage
that
the
programme
will
continue
?
what
tyre
kick
,
so
to
speak
,
have
take
place
in
respect
of
that
programme
?
from
the
conversation
that
I
,
as
a
deputy
in
the
area
,
be
have
with
the
people
work
on
the
programme
,
it
be
clearly
have
a
positive
impact
on
family
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
will
see
the

I
ask
Mr.
Gloster
for
he
perspective
on
that
question
.
be
the
€
16
million
adequate
to
meet
the
need
of
the
service
as
it
be
currently
constitute
?
that
be
the
key
.
it
be
a
demand
-
lead
service
,
which
be
at
the
discretion
of
the
District
Court
.
if
the
judge
make
a
determination
,
Tusla
have
to
resource
it
.
I
appreciate
the
response
.
I
speak
not
only
on
behalf
of
CDYS

also
in

of
the
principle
because
-----
-----by
Mr.
Gloster
's

admission

it
be
a

good
programme

it
could
become
a
flagship

Tusla
,
the
Child

Agency

if
resource

be
allocate
.

Mr.
Tennant
say
that
the
RTÉ
programme
make
a
number
of
allegation
relate
to
individual
in
senior
position
in
this
organisation
and
they
failure
to
act
on
information
relate
to
sexual
abuse
in
scout
group
across
Ireland
.
will
he
expand
on
that
?
what
exactly
do
he
mean
by
that
statement
?
Mr.
Tennant
would
agree
that
they
be
he
word
.
there
be
a
agreement
that
there
be
a
failure
to
act
on
information
.
in
other
word
,
staff
or
responsible
person
in
a
safeguard
role
arguably
fail
to
act
on
information
relate
to
sexual
abuse
.
be
that
the
case
?
no
,
I
would
like
Mr.
Tennant
to
answer
the
question
.
they
be
Mr.
Tennant
's
word
.
Mr.
Tennant
have
to
stand
over
they
as
chairman
.
something
be
fundamental
to
this
.
we
all
understand
that
there
be
scout
Ireland
now
.
we
all
accept
that
and
have
give
goodwill
to
the
new
procedure
and
protocol
that
have
be
put
in
place
relate
to
governance
.
however
,
Mr.
Tennant
be
here
as
head
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
I
argue
that
he
must
also
answer
for
what
happen
in
the
CBSI
and
the
SAI
.
we
job
here
be
to
interrogate
the
dynamic
that
lead
to
allegation
against
person
not
be
deal
with
by
the
organisation
.
I
be
still
unclear
in
my
mind
as
to
why
,
if
the
Children
first
guideline
be
adopt
in
2012
,
it
take
a
full
five
year
before
Scouting
Ireland
bring
in
Ian
Elliott
.
during
that
time
,
and
arguably
now
,
there
be
person
in
the
organisation
,
and
I
do
not
know
if
they
be
still
in
the
organisation
,
who
take
receipt
of
information
from
people
who
be
traumatise
and
that
case
file
be
put
into
a
filing
cabinet
.
a
review
be
to
have
take
place
in
2012
but
we
remain
blind
about
where
that
review
go
,
how
that
case
be
manage
and
whether
there
be
people
who
be
part
of
the
2017
to
2019
review
who
be
take
receipt
of
the
information
who
be
still
part
of
the
staff
.
we
want
to
understand
the
culture
that
exist
within
the
organisation
.
if
,
as
Mr.
Tennant
suggest
,
the
new
broom
be
sweep
clean
,
be
there
people
who
be
in
receipt
of
information
in
1987
and
1996
,
the
year
which
be
subject
of
the
"
RTÉ
Investigate
"
programme
,
who
be
still
on
the
staff
and
be
part
of
the
old
culture
who
continue
to
be
employ
?
that
be
the
kernel
of
the
matter
.
Mr.
Tennant
speak
of
Scouting
Ireland
open
up
its
process
and
create
helpline
,
but
I
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
anybody
who
be
deal
with
by
personnel
in
1987
or
1996
might
find
themselves
be
deal
with
by
the
same
personnel
in
2017
,
2018
or
2019
.
do
Mr.
Tennant
understand
how
that
might
look
extremely
bad
for
a
organisation
such
as
Scouting
Ireland
?
Mr.
Tennant
be
put
a
lot
of
store
in
the
Ian
Elliott
process
.
everyone
here
accept
Ian
Elliott
's
bona
fide
,
but
what
they
do
not
buy
be
that
regardless
of
whether
he
be
a
consultant
,
he
be
pay
by
Scouting
Ireland
to
conduct
a
review
and
therefore
he
be
a
employee
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
we
be
question
the
independence
of
the
process
.
what
we
be
try
to
get
at
be
what
will
arise
from
the
Elliott
process
when
he
report
.
regardless
of
whether
he
like
it
,
Mr.
Tennant
have
a
idea
of
how
this
will
play
out
because
he
strike
I
as
someone
who
have
game
this
,
which
I
do
not
mean
in
a
pejorative
sense
.
he
know
how
the
process
be
go
;
we
do
not
.
I
do
not
know
the
content
of
Ian
Elliott
's
report
.
I
be
very
concerned
that
it
will
go
into
the
public
domain
and
the
people
who
make
complaint
in
1987
and
1996
and
the
people
who
be
the
subject
of
the
"
RTÉ
Investigate
"
programme
will
have
no
justice
,
recourse
or
right
of
reply
.
do
Mr.
Tennant
see
my
point
?
Mr.
Tennant
should
start
with
the
staff
.
I
be
ask
the
ceo
to
answer
this
question
.
I
thank
Mr.
Begley
.
that
clarify
that
matter
.
please
talk
about
the
2012
review
because
I
be
try
to
clarify
in
my
mind
what
the
status
of
that
review
be
.
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
but
my
interpretation
of
that
be
Scouting
Ireland
fail
to
carry
out
a
scoping
exercise
to
see
if
further
work
be
require
on
the
file
of
complaint
.
my
understanding
be
that
be
never
do
,
that
a
undertaking
be
give
to
carry
out
such
work
and
that
there
be
minute
to
that
effect
.
what
be
pertinent
there
be
that
Scouting
Ireland
would
carry
out
the
scoping
exercise
,
it
would
have
a
statistical
analysis
for
all
child
protection
case
,
especially
for
the
file
in
Mount
Melleray
.
we
be
be
tell
it
be
ongoing
process
and
I
be
confused
why
that
be
so
because
we
be
now
in
2019
.
I
have
a
question
about
the
traffic
light
system
.
Mr.
Tennant
say
in
he
open
statement
:
"
scout
Ireland
have
always
report
any
reportable
offence
"
.
what
be
the
threshold
for
a
reportable
offence
?
I
understand
the
current
framework
.
we
would
be
well
verse
in
Children
first
,
Sign
of
Safety
and
all
of
that
but
I
want
to
know
about
happen
historically
because
that
be
what
be
pertinent
to
this
hearing
.
I
wish
to
distil
this
matter
down
to
the
"
RTÉ
Investigate
"
programme
and
extrapolate
what
deputy
Rabbitte
have
mention
about
the
reporting
mechanism
.
if
we
accept
absolutely
the
bona
fide
of
that
who
bear
witness
on
that
programme
and
accept
they
as
genuine
witness
,
it
be
arguable
that
there
be
a
failure
of
report
in
that
instance
.
that
bridge
the
divide
between
the
historical
and
the
current
.
if
the
complaint
go
back
to
1987
and
1996
and
people
in
2019
be
say
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
process
in
respect
of
they
individual
story
,
one
would
have
to
contend
that
there
be
a
failure
of
report
.
Irrespective
of
the
process
scout
Ireland
engage
in
in
2012
,
the
distinction
it
make
between
the
CBSI
,
SAI
and
the
creation
of
Scouting
Ireland
in
2004
,
the
start
of
the
process
,
the
Children
first
guideline
and
the
so
-
call
review
in
2012
,
all
of
that
process
map
across
the
narrative
of
the
individual
who
bear
witness
on
the
"
RTÉ
investigate
"
programme
.
have
watch
that
programme
,
at
a
human
level
I
would
say
there
be
a
failure
of
report
and
a
failure
to
deal
properly
within
whatever
protocol
scout
Ireland
have
design
post
2012
to
deal
with
the
trauma
suffer
by
that
people
.
do
Mr.
Tennant
agree
that
be
the
case
and
that
we
be
still
deal
with
failure
of
report
?
we
all
acknowledge
what
Scouting
Ireland
be
try
to
do
with
its
new
governance
procedure
.
we
all
acknowledge
the
involvement
of
that
14000
family
.
we
represent
they
also
;
they
live
among
we
in
we
community
.
we
be
very
much
aware
of
the
good
work
that
go
on
in
Scouting
Ireland
right
down
to
troop
level
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
need
to
be
satisfied
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
system
be
robust
.
it
be
hard
to
be
convince
that
it
be
robust
in
light
of
the
"
RTÉ
investigate
"
programme
.
indeed
.
that
be
acknowledge
,
but
I
be
talk
about
the
present
day
.
I
be
very
conscious
that
certain
matter
be
before
the
court
or
potentially
may
be
,
but
the
story
be
in
the
public
domain
.
what
reasonably
-----
I
appreciate
that
,
but
it
be
fair
to
ask
this
question
.
can
the
representative
of
Scouting
Ireland
state
categorically
that
the
process
fail
then
and
do
so
right
up
to
the
present
day
?
I
make
the
point
that
,
of
the
organisation
over
which
the
committee

Scouting
Ireland
be
second

I
welcome
the
minister
,
who
be
appear
before
we
at
short
notice
but
with
potential
solution
.
I
be
seek
a
great
degree
of
clarity
around
the
programme
support
payment
of
€
1500
.
I
wish
to
show
the
minister
example
whereby
,
notwithstand
the
process
that
provider
have
be
through
,
in
particular
provider
of
long
standing
who
have
always
be
compliant
and
whose
risk
profile
have
not
increase
,
provider
who
be
today
able
to
get
insurance
be
be
tell
that
the
cost
will
increase
twofold
in
one
instance
,
fourfold
in
another
and
sixfold
in
another
with
which
I
be
familiar
.
notwithstanding
everything
that
the
minister
be
say
and
the
exit
from
the
market
of
a
certain
insurance
operator
,
even
where
provider
's
risk
profile
have
not
increase
because
they
have
always
be
compliant
as
per
child
and
Family
Agency
and
HSE
regulation
,
they
premia
cost
be
increase
.
one
be
leave
with
the
impression
that
the
insurance
company
be
take
advantage
of
the
lacuna
in
the
market
by
step
in
to
profit
from
the
challenge
face
provider
.
how
will
the
programme
support
payment
be
divide
?
be
it
a
one
-
off
payment
for
every
provider
?
what
formula
will
be
use
?
under
what
heading
will
it
be
do
?
will
it
be
deem
a
supplementary
payment
to
meet
the
cost
of
overhead
?
will
it
be
a
direct
grant
just
by
dint
of
the
fact
that
someone
be
a
provider
?
be
it
the
case
that
provider
can
benefit
without
have
to
go
through
a
rigorous
process
?
the
minister
will
be
conscious
of
the
fact
that
many
provider
will
benefit
from
the
time
extension
,
but
as
public
representative
,
we
be
all
conscious
that
the
capital
cost
incur
by
provider
to
become
compliant
and
continue
they
operation
have
put
they
into
debt
.
we
should
not
overburden
the
sector
to
the
extent
where
facility
be
be
force
to
close
because
they
capital
and
insurance
cost
be
too
high
and
the
€
1500
payment
be
not
enough
to
meet
the
challenge
they
face
.
the
minister
have
state
that
,
by
28
December
,
the
process
will
have
be
go
through
.
I
fail
to
understand
how
the
minister
be
go
to
get
through
a
process
where
the
childcare
provider
that
I
represent
can
interact
with
Pobal
or
the
county
childcare
committee
to
benefit
from
this
grant
by
-----
so
it
be
not
a
application
process
.
then
there
be
the
issue
of
the
current
insurance
model
-----
-----
and
the
need
to
address
the
fact
that
people
have
receive
quote
with
twofold
,
fourfold
or
sixfold
increase
,
as
in
the
three
example
to
which
I
can
speak
.
with
respect
,
what
the
minister
state
do
not
give
any
comfort
to
that
provider
.
there
be
also
that
people
who
have
yet
to
be
register
up
to
June
.
what
can
they
derive
from
the
process
to
which
the
minister
refer
?
do
the
minister
say
30
%
?
a
provider
who
be
not
a
member
of
early
Childhood
Ireland
pay
€
550
last
year
and
be
now
be
quote
€
2100
.
she
will
pay
only
€
1500
if
she
pay
€
245
to
early
Childhood
Ireland
,
but
the
risk
profile
of
someone
who
be
a
member
of
early
Childhood
Ireland
do
not
increase
or
decrease
.
the
government
have
skin
in
the
game
because
the
minister
partly
fund
early
Childhood
Ireland
.
therefore
I
believe
she
have
some
muscle
in
this
regard
with
the
insurance
company
.
I
wish
the
minister
,
the
member
of
the
committee
and
the
staff
of
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
a

I
thank
the
minister
for
come
before
the
committee
today
.
I
welcome
he
word
in
respect
of
rebuild
trust
,
particularly
on
the
mother
and
baby
home
issue
.
I
note
he
remark
during
the
passage
of
the
legislation
in
respect
of
request
this
committee
to
have
regard
to
this
issue
.
however
,
we
be
unclear
what
the
minister
mean
by
that
.
it
would
be
useful
to
have
he
perspective
in
that
regard
.
underpin
all
of
that
be
the
commitment
by
the
minister
in
regard
to
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
.
when
will
that
Bill
come
before
we
?
the
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
gdpr
,
issue
be
matter
on
which
we
also
need
to
have
the
minister
's
perspective
.
we
have
receive
correspondence
from
Dr.
Maeve
O'Rourke
on
rights
of
access
to
information
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
be
in
possession
of
that
same
information
.
the
minister
tell
we
that
he
have
meet
with
survivor
and
group
.
I
be
sure
they
notify
he
of
some
legislative
change
they
seek
in
respect
of
the
Civil
Registration
Act
2004
,
which
would
provide
people
with
they
birth
certificate
.
in
the
case
of
the
Clann
project
and
the
datum
protection
issue
,
I
understand
a
Bill
on
access
to
historical
care
-
related
archive
be
be
draft
.
I
be
raise
many
issue
to
which
I
do
not
expect
the
minister
to
respond
fully
today
but
I
want
to
put
they
on
the
record
.
on
the
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
the
gdpr
,
which
we
understand
provide
for
access
to
information
,
and
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
,
what
be
the
timeline
in
that
regard
?
how
important
will
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
be
in
deal
with
the
mother
and
baby
home
issue
?
if
it
be
to
deal
with
the
issue
,
the
committee
must
see
the
minister
show
good
faith
in
respect
of
a
throughput
of
work
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
to
ensure
we
do
not
end
up
hear
from
stakeholder
and
then
nothing
happen
after
the
fact
.
we
need
to
work
with
the
minister
,
the
stakeholder
and
everybody
else
involved
in
this
matter
.
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
,
we
need
to
work
in
a
process
of
partnership
with
all
of
the
stakeholder
to
ensure
the
voice
of
the
Maeve
O'Rourkes
and
Claire
McGettricks
of
this
world
be
hear
and
that
what
they
say
be
deal
with
in
a
meaningful
way
so
that
we
work
through
all
of
the
issue
.
I
be
sure
other
member
will
make
similar
point
on
this
issue
.
have
the
minister
give
consideration
to
amend
the
Civil
Registration
Act
2004
to
provide
all
adopt
people
with
a
birth
certificate
?
when
will
the
commission
's
report
be
publish
?
I
do
not
wish
to
deal
with
any
of
this
issue
until
the
committee
have
have
sight
of
that
report
and
read
through
its
recommendation
.
I
also
want
to
give
more
time
to
the
gdpr
consideration
and
the
information
and
trace
Bill
consideration
because
they
be
all
vital
if
we
,
as
a
committee
,
be
go
to
deal
with
this
issue
in
a
sympathetic
and
meaningful
way
.
this
be
general
point
.
I
realise
that
the
clock
be
tick
down
.
I
do
not
expect
the
minister
to
reply
completely
in
the
one
minute
that
be
leave
but
I
be
sure
he
will
have
a
opportunity
to
do
so
in
the
course
of
proceedings
.
I
thank
everybody
for
they
co-operation
particularly
on
the
time
aspect
.
it
be
difficult
with
Covid
consideration
when
we
must
work
within
a
certain
timeframe
.
there
be
a
few
technical
glitch
but
in
general
it
go
very
well
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
appear
today
.
we
very
much
look
forward
to
work
with
he
and
to
we
ongoing
engagement
.
I
propose
that
we
publish
the
minister
's
open
statement
to
the
Oireachtas
website
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
welcome
the
witness
.
I
would
like
to
start
with
foster
carer
.
how
many
additional
foster
carer
be
recruit
as
a
result
of
the
awareness
-
raising
campaign
?
I
thank
Mr.
Gloster
.
I
would
like
to
draw
he
attention
to
a
recent
report
by
the
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
,
HIQA
,
on
service
in
Cork
.
the
report
identify
unacceptable
delay
in
respect
of
the
child
protection
notification
system
.
have
there
be
a
improvement
in
that
service
?
what
improvement
have
arise
from
that
report
?
I
would
like
to
move
on
to
Kerry
.
Recent
media
report
highlight
the
failure
to
refer
365
case
of
suspect
child
abuse
in
the
Kerry
area
.
one
report
in
the
Irish
Times
say
some
delay
be
attribute
to
"
effort
by
social
worker
to
substantiate
the
abuse
allegation
before
make
a
referral
"
.
in
ask
this
question
one
try
to
be
as
sympathetic
as
possible
to
that
on
the
front
line
who
have
to
go
through
each
of
the
case
.
I
understand
that
122
case
related
to
suspect
abuse
of
child
under
the
age
of
18
.
of
this
,
19
be
give
a
high
priority
.
I
understand
that
about
115
case
be
deem
to
be
of
medium
priority
.
Mr.
Gloster
use
the
word
"
consistency
"
.
I
have
highlight
it
in
he
submission
to
the
committee
.
where
do
service
in
Kerry
stand
now
as
a
result
of
this
note
failure
?
one
do
not
want
to
attribute
blame
but
if
there
be
delay
we
must
ask
why
.
be
delay
a
function
of
people
within
Tusla
be
overload
or
overwork
?
be
a
excessive
burden
place
on
individual
or
team
seek
to
ensure
this
case
be
deal
with
appropriately
and
in
accordance
with
protocol
and
law
and
that
they
be
watertight
?
be
people
in
Tusla
get
the
resource
they
need
to
triage
this
case
?
I
appreciate
that
.
if
I
be
to
extrapolate
from
Ms
Duggan
's
answer
,
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
people
who
be
deal
with
case
that
arguably
be
beyond
they
experience
.
I
think
that
would
be
a
fair
comment
.
yes
or
no
?
can
I
make
one
more
intervention
?
I
apologise
.
I
will
ask
my
question
.
we
be
endeavour
to
understand
how
the
culture
of
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
work
.
I
accept
the
statement
of
the
ceo
today
in
respect
of
move
the
culture
on
or
change
practice
,
culture
and
structure
.
we
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
ceo
in
that
respect
.
when
we
use
a
term
such
as
"
variation
"
,
it
be
meaningless
to
I
.
it
suggest
to
I
there
be
a
massive
variation
in
practice
in
different

it
come
to
timeline
and
to
how
case
be
deal
with
.
if
we
be
to
be
helpful
to
we
constituent
,
we
need
to
have
a
great
understanding
of
the
culture
that
exist
within
.
to
be
frank
about
it
,
notwithstand
the
ceo
's
statement
today
,
which
I
find
very
helpful
,
my
perception
be
that
there
be
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
a
lot
of
the
practice
that
be
happen
within
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
be
deconstruct
such
that
the
service
flow
more
seamlessly
,
as
constrain
and
all
as
it
be
by
staffing
and
other
administrative
challenge
.
that
be
the
point
,
essentially
.
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
and
we
will
have
to
revisit
this
.
that
be
fine
.
it
would
be
we
intention
to
have
ongoing
engagement
with
Tusla
anyway

the

up
of
the
next
meeting
.
I
wish
to
record
my
appreciation
for
Dr.
Muldoon
and
he
colleague
appear
before
the
committee
and
for
they
report
,
which
have
give
we
a
clear
framework
and
overview
.
it
have
give
I
some
riding
instruction
on
where
to
pursue
the
specific
issue
.
on
foot
of
the
report
,
I
have
be
submit
parliamentary
question
that
seek
to
gain
answer
in
respect
of
metric
and
where
money
will
be
allocate
across
the
cho
for
assessment
of
need
.
what
be
become
apparent
to
I
be
that
there
be
a
major
disparity
between
individual
cho
.
for
example
,
if
one
be
live
in
CHO
1
,
the
funding
allocate
from
the
€
7.8
million
be
€
214000
,
but
if
one
be
live
in
CHO
9
,
the
allocation
be
approximately
€
1.9
million
.
my
question
be
on
process
and
standardisation
.
this
be
a
small
country
and
I
do
not
understand
why
there
be
such
disparity
between
the
cho
in
term
of
the
progress
disability
service
,
pds
,
programme
for
child
.
I
be
still
unclear
as
to
how
the
child
's
disability
network
team
,
cDNT
,
will
be
able
to
work
effectively
base
on
the
funding
allocation
they
have
receive
.
have
Dr.
Muldoon
's
office
be
able
to
critique
that
model
in
any
way
?
I
rely
on
he
office
and
we
rely
on
the
reply
from
the
HSE
,
although
it
must
be
say
that
the
HSE
have
a
way
of
respond
to
deputy
's
question
and
couch
the
language
in
a
particular
way
that
do
not
always
give
we
the
answer
to
the
question
we
ask
.
base
on
the
allocation
provide
,
I
remain
sceptical
about
the
ability
of
each
CHO
to
deliver
on
the
assessment
of
need
and
diminish
or
tackle
fully
the
list
for
initial
assessment
in
the
first
instance
.
I
would
dearly
love
to
hear
what
the
witness
have
to
say
about
whether
the
team
be
the
right
structure
to
tackle
this
problem
.
I
thank
Ms
McKenna
-
Keane
.
Dr.
Muldoon
mention
CAMHS
.
be
it
he
view
that
it
operate
differently
depend
on
the
region
?
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
a
perception
that
the
culture
within
CAMHS
in
some
region
-
this
be
my
word
-
can
be
enclose
and
silo
base
depend
on
which
party
of
the
country
one
be
in
and
there
be
a
protectiveness
about
each
region
's
work
such
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
deconstruct
the
culture
in
order
to
deliver
the
service
where
it
be
most
require
.
will
Dr.
Muldoon
confirm
that
what
he
say
in
he
open
statement
in
respect
of
reimbursement
be
that
there
should
be
reimbursement
for
that
family
who
seek
a
private
assessment
of
need
?
this
would
chime
with
many
of
we
who
want
to
see
child
get
the
service
.
if
there
be
a
mechanism
for
reimbursement
by
the
State
for
that
service
,
that
would
assist
we
greatly
in
deal
with
this
issue
.
be
there
a
standard
international
metric
of
the
cost
of
assessment
per
child
?
the
new
standard
operating
procedure
for
assessment
of
need
be
address
in
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
of
mine
,
which
state
that
the
HSE
have
develop
a
standard
operating
procedure
for
the
assessment
of
need
process
to
ensure
that
child
with
disability
and
they
family
access
appropriate
assessment
and
intervention
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
the
approach
of
assessment
of
need
be
consistent
across
all
area
.
this
ultimately
come
down
to
funding
,
resource
and
money
.
we
know
what
the
price
of
a
assessment
of
need
be
in
the
private
sector
.
I
do
not
know
if
there
be
a
costing
in
the
public
sphere
.
if
there
be
a
internationally
recognise
cost
,
depend
on
the
need
level
of
intervention
,
that
would
help
we
in
we
understanding
when
interrogate
the
figure
that
the
minister
,
whoever
that
might
be
,
put
before
we
.
I
thank
Dr.
Muldoon
and
he
colleague
,
Dr.
McAuley
and
Ms
McKenna
-
Keane
,
for
appear
before
we

I
thank
the
witness
.
it
have
be
compelling
evidence
that
have
dovetail
very
much
with
the
evidence
of
the
ombudsman
last
week
.
the
AOTI
submission
state
:
the
new
sop
do
not
facilitate
the
diagnosis
of
,
for
example
autistic
Spectrum
Disorder
or
intellectual
Disability
and
will
no
long
be
provide
as
a
part
of
the
AON
protocol
.
instead
child
will
be
identify
as
'
health
need
'
in
the
service
statement
.
Mr.
Smyth
might
help
I
to
understand
that
more
fully
,
as
succinctly
as
possible
.
if
it
do
not
take
in
asd
and
id
,
what
do
it
take
in
?
if
they
come
under
health
need
,
will
that
not
exclude
potentially
thousand
of
child
?
child
be
be
de
facto
reclassify
,
which
mean
the
service
do
not
have
to
follow
.
be
that
the
case
?
I
would
like
Mr.
Smyth
's
perspective
on
this
,
if
I
may
,
because
he
be
a
front
-
line
professional
.
I
do
not
want
to
put
word
into
anybody
's
mouth
but
my
assessment
of
this
,
for
what
it
be
worth
,
be
that
with
the
sop
,
some
€
7.8
million
will
be
spend
by
the
various
community
health
organisation
,
and
there
will
be
any
number
of
pta
through
the
sop
model
,
but
it
will
not
deliver
service
,
in
essence
,
for
child
.
be
that
correct
?
it
be
retrospective
.
it
be
now
the
case
that
the
ombudsman
have
objectively
critique
this
model
,
as
have
three
compelling
witness
.
there
be
a
evidence
base
,
base
on
any
rational
,
independent
or
objective
assessment
,
to
suggest
that
the
policy
be
completely
wrong
and
need
to
be
review
,
reverse
,
rescind
and
reshap
into
a
new
policy
,
take
into
account
voice
such
as
that
of
the
three
compelling
witness
we
have
hear
from
during
this
meeting
.
that
be
something
the
committee
will
take
seriously
.
what
be
the
witness
's
view
on
the
consistency
of
outcome
for
child
among
the
cho
?
reference
be
make
to
recruitment
.
I
receive
a
response
on
17
September
2020
to
a
parliamentary
question
in
which
I
ask
the
number
of
occupational
therapist
hire
from
each
university
by
the
HSE
.
the
witness
might
note
the
follow
figure
on
the
back
of
a
envelope
if
they
have
a
pen
handy
.
in
2016
,
135
be
recruit
,
while
in
2017
,
120
be
recruit
,
which
be
a
reduction
.
in
2018
,
there
be
a
further
reduction
to
119
.
thus
far
in
2019
,
there
have
be
73
.
the
difference
between
73
and
119
be
stark
and
I
imagine
that
when
the
figure
come
in
for
2020
,
there
will
have
be
a
further
reduction
.
how
be
we
go
to
crack
the
conundrum
of
ensure
there
be
sufficient
train
personnel
to
deliver
the
service
,
depend
on
what
that
service
need
to
look
like
,
follow
we
forthcoming
interaction
with
the
minister
?
I
will
ask
he
this
same
question
.
how
be
we
go
to
deliver
for
child
if
there
be
not
enough
people
who
be
suitably
qualified
to
assist
child
such
as
Linda'
?
what
be
the
good
way
to
ensure
we
recruit
enough
people
in
order
that
every
child
can
get
access
to
the
service
?
do
the
PTA
-
sop
system
call
into
question
whether
professional
be
adhere
to
they
code
of
conduct
in
term
of
how
they
deal
with
from
a
moral
or
ethical
point
of
view
with
the
child
who
come
before
they
for
a
90
-
minute
desktop
service
?
I
apologise
to
the
chair
for
delay
.
at
this
stage
,
I
think
all
the
question
have
be
ask
.
like
many
other
deputy
and
Senator
,
I
deal
with
this
topic
regularly
in
my
constituency
.
the
committee
feel
passionate
about
the
issue
and
want
to
examine
it
as
one
of
we
first
topic
but
we
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
a
report
that
sit
on
a
shelf
gathering
dust
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
the
chair
of
a
committee
that
oversee
anything
like
that
.
it
be
fantastic
that
we
have
this
presentation
today
in
advance
of
we
meeting
with
the
Minister
of
State
because
we
can
directly
put
that
issue
,
concern
and
question
to
she
and
we
will
have
further
engagement
in
the
new
year
.
then
we
can
meet
as
a
committee
about
some
of
the
suggestion
that
be
make
,
such
as
the
cross
-party
motion
.
the
good
thing
about
this
committee
be
that
it
be
cross-party
.
all
party
,
as
well
as
Independent
,
be
represent
.
it
be
the
appropriate
forum
in
a
way
to
try
to
get
that
cross-party
approach
that
everybody
want
to
see
.
I
sincerely
thank
the
witness
.
the
testimony
of
Ms
Murphy
and
Ms
Comerford
be
powerful
.
I
know
they
be
tired
and
that
it
be
a
battle
and
a
struggle
but
we
really
appreciate
they
give
up
they
time
and
come
before
the
committee
today
and
tell
we
they
story
.
when
I
speak
about
this
topic
I
always
say
people
should
not
have
to
tell
they
story
to
they

up

,
I
deal
with

the

feel
passionate

want
to
examine
it
as
one
of
we
first
topic
but
we
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
a

that
sit
on
a
shelf
gathering
dust
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
the

that

anything
like
that
.
it
be
fantastic
that
we
have
this

put

we
will
have

then
we
can
meet

about
some
of
the

that
be
make

such
as

the

about

be
that

it
be
the

today
.
we
genuinely
appreciate
it
and
we
will
be
stay
on
top
of
this
topic
.
I
propose
we
publish
the
open
statement
to
the
Oireachtas
website
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
remind
everyone
to
vacate
the
room
immediately
to
allow
for
cleaning
and
set
-
up
of
the
next
meeting
.
I
also
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
as
a
former
member
of
the
committee
.
while
we
be
on
very
friendly
term
and
I
be
conscious
of
not
throw
any
brickbat
at
she
,
I
have
some
very
direct
question
.
I
think
she
will
appreciate
that
.
I
represent
the
area
cover
by
community
healthcare
organisation
,
CHO
,
4
,
which
comprise
Kerry
,
north
Cork
,
north
Lee
and
south
Lee
.
of
the
€
7.8
million
that
be
allocate
for
the
6558
people
,
€
1.1
million
be
allocate
to
CHO
4
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
that
as
of
30
June
,
a
total
of
1798
assessment
of
need
have
be
complete
over
September
to
November
,
inclusive
.
will
she
provide
I
with
a
breakdown
of
how
this
cut
across
CHO
4
?
I
ask
because
it
be
still
not
clear
to
I
whether
this
assessment
of
need
,
which
the
Minister
of
State
say
be
historical
,
be
under
the
new
sop
and
be
,
therefore
,
under
the
90
-
minute
bracket
.
if
the
answer
be
that
they
be
,
then
,
give
evidence
that
have
come
before
the
committee
,
I
have
serious
concern
about
that
.
the
case
for
CHO
4
can
be
extrapolate
to
all
the
cho
in
the
country
.
I
need
some
word
of
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
for
the
family
and
child
whom
I
represent
so
that
they
do
not
come
back
to
I
in
a
matter
of
month
,
have
receive
the
initial
assessment
of
need
,
to
say
there
have
be
no
follow
-
up
of
service
,
or
say
the
assessment
of
need
,
as
previous
witness
have
suggest
,
be
a
sub
-
par
method
by
any
international
standard
of
assess
a
child
with
need
.
that
be
the
first
reassurance
I
seek
.
that
be
not
the
90
-
minute
desktop
assessment
but
a
full
and
proper
assessment
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
as
this
will
be
a
ongoing
issue
,
I
would
appreciate
if
she
offer
to
communicate
with
the
committee
's
chairman
to
give
figure
for
each
of
the
cho
to
assess
that
number
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
this
would
be
very
useful
.
we
will
put
down
we
own
parliamentary
question
anyway
.
when
the
ombudsman
be
before
the
committee
,
he
suggest
without
any
ambiguity
that
some
sort
of
a
refund
scheme
could
be
establish
for
that
family
who
wish
to
procure
private
assessment
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
in
a
parliamentary
reply
to
I
date
30
October
2020
,
refer
to
a
letter
from
Dr.
Cathal
Morgan
in
which
it
be
state
that
,
in
relation
to
Sláintecare
funding
,
which
be
the
€
7.8
million
provide
on
a
once
-
off
basis
and
which
be
time
limit
,
the
cho
would
engage
with
private
provider
in
they
area
to
procure
private
assessment
where
appropriate
.
will
the
minister
of
State
provide
we
with
a
breakdown
of
the
cost
and
the
number
of
private
assessment
?
as
I
understand
it
,
the
€
7.8
million
be
not
fully
allocate
or
spend
yet
.
to
what
extent
be
that
funding
be
give
over
to
private
provider
?
once
that
funding
be
spend
,
be
there
scope
for
family
who
wish
to
seek
private
assessment
to
get
a
refund
?
that
would
provide
a
massive
alleviation
because
the
€
7.8
million
will
not
cover
the
full
extent
of
the
demand
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
make
.
I
ask
about
a
potential
refund
for
family
.
after
this
backlog
be
clear
,
or
even
if
this
backlog
be
clear
,
there
will
always
be
demand
and
the
resource
will
not
always
follow
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
know
from
she
own
experience
that
family
be
force
into
a
situation
where
they
be
wait
on
the
public
list
for
a
inordinate
time
.
the
pressure
come
on
they
to
take
out
a
credit
union
loan
to
get
a
private
assessment
.
all
family
will
do
that
if
need
be
.
be
there
any
scope
,
as
per
the
ombudsman
's
suggestion
,
for
some
sort
of
recoupment
of
that
cost
for
individual
family
at
the
family
level
?
could
the
State
intervene
to
facilitate
that
family
or
,
if
the
family
make
a
request
for
the
recoupment
of
expense
,
could
a
application
or
some
sort
of
protocol
or
process
be
set
up
to
facilitate
that
?
that
be
a
honest
and
fair
answer
.
I
accept
that
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
welcome
she
commitment
.
as
she
will
know
,
have
watch

I
wish
everybody
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
she
staff
a
very
happy
Christmas
.
I
acknowledge
the
statement
of
Councillor
Mary
Linehan
Foley
,
Mayor
of
Cork
.
I
wish
to
quote
from
the
statement
she
issue
last
week
.
as
many
will
be
aware
,
I
be
the
child
of
a
mother
and
baby
home
.
I
be
bear
in
Bessborough
mother
and
Baby
Home
.
this
be
a
fact
I
never
shy
away
from
.
I
have
come
to
know
my
birth
mother
and
consider
myself
to
be
very
fortunate
.
but
I
know
there
be
many
who
have
not
be
so
fortunate
.
she
go
on
to
say
:
it
be
almost
a
contradiction
for
I
to
issue
a
apology
on
behalf
of
a
organisation
that
I
be
myself
a
survivor
of
;
and
now
a
member
of
.
but
I
want
all
survivor
to
know
that
I
mean
this
truly
and
sincerely
.
I
know
that
while
this
action
take
place
in
the
not
too
distant
past
,
as
a
society
we
have
transform
entirely
.
but
we
must
never
forget
the
part
we
play
in
this
painful
past
,
never
forget
what
happen
and
ensure
it
never
happen
again
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
she
word
because
it
be
important
to
listen
to
somebody
who
be
a
public
representative
who
be
bear
in
a
home
.
she
want
a
process
and
want
we
to
move
on
,
but
the
process
must
be
a
robust
one
.
that
be
the
reason
we
be
here
today
.
my
first
question
for
the
minister
be
a
technical
one
.
be
the
minute
of
the
collaborative
forum
record
?
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
.
the
second
question
relate
to
narrative
.
the
minister
,
I
think
it
be
fair
to
say
,
have
describe
the
language
of
the
executive
summary
as
be
cold
.
in
the
absence
of
we
have
recourse
to
question
the
member
of
the
commission
-
they
have
refuse
invitation
to
be
here
and
I
be
not
go
to
pass
judgment
on
that
-
the
minister
be
the
person
in
the
fire
line
for
question
on
the
narrative
.
the
process
of
correct
the
narrative
have
yet
to
be
flesh
out
.
if
I
understand
he
correctly
,
what
he
be
say
be
that
through
the
interdepartmental
process
he
be
go
to
seek
some
mechanism
that
he
have
call
a
right
to
rectification
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
follow
,
in
very
simple
term
.
will
he
consult
with
external
body
,
such
as
the
collaborative
Forum
on
mother
and
Baby
Home
,
about
what
that
will
mean
in
real
term
for
people
like
the
follow
?
today
,
I
speak
to
a
lady
that
I
will
call
Mary
.
she
say
to
I
that
she
give
evidence
to
the
commission
,
not
the
confidential
committee
.
she
say
that
she
do
receive
she
transcript
.
she
say
it
be
reflect
in
report
but
she
tell
I
that
there
be
inaccuracy
.
normally
,
politician
be
good
judge
of
character
and
when
I
speak
to
this
person
today
I
know
well
within
a
minute
or
two
that
this
be
a
reasonable
,
rational
person
who
,
crucially
,
do
not
give
evidence
to
the
confidential
committee
,
she
give
it
to
the
commission
but
there
be
inaccuracy
.
no
matter
how
small
or
big
that
inaccuracy
be
,
they
be
inaccuracy
.
what
can
I
tell
this
person
in
respect
of
a
process
that
the
minister
will
now
create
in
the
absence
of
,
we
assume
,
the
commission
not
be
reconstitute
again
although
we
would
support
call
for
that
?
what
process
can
that
person
rely
upon
now
to
ensure
that
she
story
be
accurately
reflect
in
this
report
?
the
minister
,
dare
I
say
it
,
have
to
give
a
simple
,
clear
answer
in
respect
to
the
right
of
rectification
.
will
there
be
a
restorative
process
?
will
he
open
up
a
whole
chapter
again
in
respect
of
people
such
as
I
have
describe
?
there
be
many
of
they
out
there
,
we
all
have
testimony
of
it
and
the
minister
have
acknowledge
that
people
and
the
fact
that
there
have
be
no
correct
interpretation
of
what
they
say
to
the
confidential
committee
and
the
commission
.
what
will
the
minister
do
to
ensure
that
the
narrative
be
correct
for
people
?
we
cannot
talk
about
burial
legislation
,
and
information
and
tracing
,
until
there
be
confidence
that
the
narrative
have
be
correct
.
if
material
have
be
destroy
,
how
do
the
minister
reconcile
what
he
have
just
say
with
that
fact
?
what
will
be
the
entire
cost
of
this
process
in
term
of
a
compensatory
process
,
build
out
a
package
with
access
to
medical
card
,
counselling
,
healthcare
and
so
on
?
what
be
the
indicative
budget
for
this
entire
process
,
as
we
stand
?
I
thank
the
minister
and
all
of
the
member
for
they
co-operation
.
it
be
really
difficult
when
we
have
to
fit
everything
into
two
hour
.
deputy
John
Paul
Phelan
want
to
contribute
but
,
unfortunately
,
a
member
need
to
be
within
the
Leinster
House
complex
to
contribute
to
public
session
.
I
thank
all
the
official
for
attend
.
be
it
agree
to
publish
the
opening
statement
on
the
Oireachtas
website
?
agree
.
