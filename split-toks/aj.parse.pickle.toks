to
fit

unfortunately
,
a

need
to

I

of

I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
we
.
I
will
put
my
question
to
the
witness
in
a
rapid
-
fire
way
.
the
question
be
short
,
and
I
hope
to
get
short
answer
as
I
only
have
seven
minute

have
there
be
a
discussion
internally
on
the
ethical
basis
on
which
the
sop
have
be
devise
and
have
anybody
within
the
HSE
or
academia
raise
issue
about
it
?
my
first
question
be
for
Dr.
Morgan
.
so
how
would
the
witness
characterise
the
statement
that
this
new
sop
be
merely
a
defensive
process
for
legal
reason
?
perhaps
Dr.
Morgan
might
want
to
take
that
question
.
the
implication
be
that
the
system
be
devise
use
approximately
€
7.8
million
purely
for
legal
reason
to
offset
the
risk
of
legal
action
against
the
HSE
downstream
.
I
accept
the
answer
.

and

Parliamentary
question
no.
151
of
2
December
2020
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
for
the
reason
for
the
delay
in
all
intervention
for
child
under
the
age
of
18
year
of
age
.
the
subsequent
HSE
response
to
I
of
17
December
be
that
in
respect
of
community
CAMHS
service
,
the
waiting
time
for
young
people
to
be
see
by
the
child
and
adolescent
mental
health
service
continue
to
be
a
issue
in
a
number
of
cho
.
it
state
that
a
renew
focus
on
improve
capacity
and
throughput
be
in
place
in
this
area
and
some
improvement
be
be
show
.
I
cannot
say
that
be
the
case
in
CHO
4
.
Dr.
Morgan
speak
about
silo
previously
.
in
the
very
short
time
available
,
if
we
be
talk
about
knock
down
silo
,
then
CAMHS
need
to
be
put
under
the
microscope
.
he
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
my
perception
be
that
CAMHS
operate
as
a
silo
and
until
that
silo
be
smashed
and
there
be
a
great
interdisciplinarity
about
the
way
in
which
team
operate
at
a
community
level
then
we
be
not
go
to
see
the
throughput
in
respect
of
the
therapeutic
effect
base
on
the
assessment
of
need
.
be
that
a
fair
characterisation
of
CAMHS
now
in
term
of
the
challenge
face
?
how
be
I
on
time
,
chairman
?
Parliamentary
question
be
the
limited
power
deputy
have
in
respect
of
get
answer
.
to
be
fair
to
the
HSE
,
I
always
receive
comprehensive
reply
to
my
question
.
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
in
September
2020
,
which
seek
the
number
on
the
initial
assessment
nationally
.
the
figure
that
come
back
be
13273
.
I
tab
the
same
question
in
December
and
the
same
cohort
have
risen
to
16466
.
that
be
a
24
%
increase
on
the
number
nationally
wait
for
initial
assessment
.
the
HSE
have
map
in
€
7.8
million
but
in
real
term
,
the
waiting
list
be
increase
.
that
be
fact
;
it
be
base
on
the
HSE
's
own
figure
.
in
CHO
4
,
cover
Kerry
and
Cork
,
the
number
of
child
await
initial
assessment
rise
from
930
in
September
to
1436
in
December
.
I
tab
two
question
,
one
in
September
and
one
in
December
.
the
number
in
CHO
4
indicate
242
additional
people
be
await
assessment
.
nationally
,
the
number
wait
for
a
initial
intervention
have
increase
by
7
%
.
even
if
Dr.
Morgan
be
talk
about
change
to
community
team
-
we
take
what
he
be
say
in
good
faith
-
in
real
time
,
the
real
figure
show
there
be
still
a
exponential
increase
in
the
waiting
list
.
notwithstanding
the
amount
of
money
that
have
be
map
onto
this
and
the
entirety
of
the
budget
,
the
figure
show
I
that
it
be
still
difficult
to
keep
pace
with
demand
.
that
be
something
that
must
be
address
.
I
be
sure
I
be
out
of
time
but
I
will
make
a
final
point
and
Dr.
Morgan
can
come
back
to
I
late
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
deaf
school
,
in
particular
the
fact
that
site
-
specialise
speech
and
language
therapy
service
be
be
take
away
from
deaf
school
at
present
.
that
be
wrong
and
it
need
to
be
revise
.
they
be
people
who
always
have
a
service
within
that
school
and
it
seem
now
that
it
be
be
excise
out
of
the
system
by
the
centralisation
of
service
under
the
progress
disability
service
strategy
.
I
ask
that
the
decision
would
please
be
revise
,
in
particular
as
it
relate
to
deaf
school
throughout
the
country
.
I
welcome
this
process
and
see
it
as
be
part
of
a
ongoing
process
of
communication
with
the
HSE
and
Dr.
Morgan
and
the
team
so
I
welcome
most
of
the
response
.
it
give
rise
to
further
question
but
we
will
interrogate
they
in
due
course
.
the
€
7.8
million
be
still
hang
out
there
for
I
.
I
receive
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
date
22
December
from
Dr.
Morgan
in
respect
of
the
breakdown
of
the
€
7.8
million
.
I
use
CHO
4
because
it
be
the
area
with
which
I
be
most
familiar
but
it
be
representative
of
many
cho
.
he
state
that
assessment
of
need
complete
go
from
29
in
September
2020
to
69
in
October
and
257
in
November
.
this
be
a
massive
jump
.
what
I
want
to
find
out
be
the
breakdown
of
the
cost
.
how
be
that
€
7.8
million
distribute
?
I
do
not
get
a
sufficient
answer
to
that
answer
.
I
ask
he
to
revisit
question
no.

I
be
take
with
the
submission
we
have
receive
today
because
it
have
shed
new
light
on
this
legislation
and
have
allow
I
to
think
more
critically
about
the
flaw
inherent
in
the
legislation
.
we
,
collectively
and
in
a
non-partisan
way
,
need
to
find
some
mechanism
to
come
together
to
ensure
that
this
be
a
robust
piece
of
legislation
and
that
it
deal
with
all
of
the
issue
that
have
be
put
before
we
today
by
the
esteemed
person
who
have
come
before
we
and
give
of
they
time
.
I
want
to
pose
one
question
to
Professor
Scraton
or
Dr.
O'Rourke
in
respect
of
the
transitional
justice
model
,
and
this
be
something
Ms
Lohan
have
also
raise
,
in
particular
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
accountability
,
truth
tell
,
reparation
and
reform
in
a
transitional
justice
model
.
it
seem
to
I
that
it
be
not
inherent
or
present
within
the
legislation
as
it
be
constitute
.
we
be
talk
today
about
find
a
model
that
speak
to
the
bereaved
family
.
to
I
,
there
be
a
model
that
could
be
use
,
and
that
be
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
where
there
be
a
historical
investigation
unit
,
a
independent
commission
on
informational
retrieval
,
a
oral
history
archive
and
a
implementation
and
reconciliation
group
.
I
wonder
if
some
of
that
idea
could
be
inculcate
into
this
legislation
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
local
knowledge
,
so
there
be
information
gathering
,
retrieval
and
processing
so
as
to
build
a
more
complete
picture
for
everybody
.
that
be
the
first
question
.
the
second
question
relate
again
to
Professor
Scraton
.
as
we
hear
in
the
open
remark
:
the
Bill
imply
that
family
of
infant
and
mother
who
die
in
institutional
custody
will
be
compel
to
make
a
choice
between
exhumation
and
identification
of
they
relative
's
remains
follow
by
reinternment
on
the
one
hand
and
the
coroner
retain
the
power
to
hold
a
inquest
to
confirm
the
decease
's
identity
,
approximately
when
he
or
she
die
,
where
he
or
she
die
and
,
most
important
,
how
he
or
she
die
.
will
Professor
Scraton
elaborate
on
that
?
it
seem
to
I
that
he
and
Dr.
O’Rourke
be
say
that
if
we
proceed
with
the
legislation
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
,
we
be
potentially
in
breach
of
article
2
of
the
EHCR
.
what
I
do
not
want
,
as
one
legislator
,
be
to
be
in
breach
of
any
article
that
deny
people
they
natural
rights
.
that
be
all
I
will
say
.
I
thank
Professor
Murphy
.
in
term
of
how
this
legislation
be
constitute
or
draft
at
present
,
how
would
Professor
Murphy
propose
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
transitional
justice
?
transitional
justice
be
a
common
theme
run
through
every
submission
we
have
consider
so
far
today
,
and
I
now
have
a
honest
understanding
of
what
transitional
justice
be
.
how
would
Professor
Murphy
inculcate
that
into
the
legislation
properly
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
that
who
should
have
the
right
to
know
what
happen
to
they
love
one
?
may
I
come
in
there
,
please
,
Chairman
?
I
be
aware
the
time
be
short
and
I
thank
Professor
Murphy
.
in
conclusion
,
and
to
ensure
I
adhere
to
the
time
constraint
,
I
ask
if
the
Irish
human
Right
and
Equality
Commission
be
advocate
for
a
separate
process
inculcate
within
the
legislation
but
a
separate
or
independent
process
that
would
find
truth
and
speak
to
all
of
the
issue
that
the
professor
have
just
speak
to
there
.
I
thank
the
Vice
Chairman
.
I
thank
Ms
Ansbro
and
Ms
Carthy
for
come
before
the
committee
.
we
be
again
see
a
consistent
message
from
everyone
who
have
submit
to
the
committee
in
respect
of
the
flaw
inherent
within
the
legislation
.
it
seem
it
have
more
hole
in
it
than
a
block
of
Swiss
cheese
and
considerable
work
will
have
to
be
do
to
amend
it
to
make
it
fit
for
purpose
.
it
be
encouraging
to
hear
so
many
government
representative
on
the
committee
,
as
well
as
opposition
member
,
come
together
in
what
I
interpret
as
one
voice
in
respect
of
the
need
to
amend
the
legislation
.
return
to
the
coronial
process
,
there
have
be
consistency
in
respect
of
the
message
we
hear
from
everyone
from
Ms
Lohan
to
Professor
Scraton
and
Dr.
O'Rourke
.
everybody
have
consistently
say
that
this
legislation
could
put
we
at
variance
with
we
article
2
obligation
.
do
Ms
Ansbro
or
the
ICCL
have
a
view
on
the
coronial
process
as
it
be
constitute
and
on
whether
the
legislation
as
draft
deal
sufficiently
with
the
article
2
provision
?
do
either
the
legislation
relate
to
the
coronial
process
or
the
legislation
we
be
discuss
need
to
be
amend
to
take
account
of
the
statement
by
the
UN
special
rapporteur
on
extrajudicial
,
summary
or
arbitrary
execution
to
the
effect
that
mass
grave
be
crime
scene
?
there
be
no
ambiguity
in
what
Ms
Ansbro
say
or
in
what
the
UN
rapporteur
say
and
,
therefore
,
there
should
be
no
ambiguity
in
regard
to
how
the
legislation
should
be
constitute
to
deal
with
the
rights
of
that
who
be
inter
in
that
grave
,
how
they
come
to
be
there
and
what
the
cause
be
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
continue
sense
of
understanding
of
where
the
ICCL
sit
in
respect
of
the
current
coronial
system
and
whether
Ms
Ansbro
agree
with
statement
make
by
other
people
who
have
submit
to
the
committee
in
respect
of
the
article
2
provision
.
do
we
need
amend
coronial
jurisprudence
or
legislation
,
or
should
we
buttress
this
legislation
further
?
have
i-----
may
I
make
a
very
short
intervention
,
with
the
permission
of
the
Vice
Chairman
?
I
think
I
be
well
within
the
three
-
minute
limit
in
my
first
contribution
.
I
be
only
ask
for
30
second
here
and
,
furthermore
,
some
member
have
have
-----
I
appreciate
the
forbearance
of
the
vice
chairman
.
the
question
on
which
I
be
conflicted
relate
to
the
rights
of
that
people
who
wish
to
be
memorialise
versus
the
law
of
the
land
,
as
it
be
,
where
in
unnatural
circumstance
,
the
coronial
process
kick
in
.
how
do
we
balance
the
rights
of
that
people
who
want
to
memorialise
site
such
as
Bessborough
,
for
instance
,
and
establish
whether
that
wish
be
supersede
by
the
law
of
the
land
?
if
any
member
or
witness
participate
remotely
be
experience
any
sound
or
technical
issue
,
will
they
let
we
know
through
the
chat
function
?
otherwise
,
I
will
proceed
.
I
think
we
be
okay
.
we
have
receive
apology
from
Senator
Keogan
.
before
I
begin
,
I
remind
member
participate
remotely
to
keep
they
device
on
mute
until
they
be
invite
to
speak
.
when
they
be
speak
,
I
ask
where
possible
that
they
have
they
camera
switch
on
and
be
mindful
that
we
be
in
public
session
.
in
addition
,
I
remind
member
of
the
constitutional
requirement
that
they
must
be
physically
present
within
the
confines
of
the
place
which
Parliament
have
choose
to
sit
,
namely
,
Leinster
House
,
in
order
to
participate
in
public
hearing
.
I
will
not
permit
a
member
to
participate
where
he
or
she
do
not
adhere
to
this
constitutional
requirement
.
therefore
,
any
member
who
attempt
to
participate
in
this
meeting
from
outside
the

will
be
refuse
.
we
will
continue

scrutiny
of
the

I

should
be
the
statement
they

in
advance
of

however

may
be
impact
by
or
have
a
professional
view

.
it
be
the
responsibility
of

consider
and
discuss

in

and
only

as
act
chairman
,
I
will
take
a
few
minute
to
acknowledge
all
of
the
correspondence
before
we
today
and
the
compelling
testimony
the
witness
have
give
.
as
I
have
state
in
the
early
session
,
this
be
about
ensure
that
we
,
as
member
of
this
committee
,
broaden
we
perspective
so
that
we
try
to
make
the
good
legislation
possible
.
we
cannot
do
that
without
hear
from
person
such
as
the
witness
.
regard
Bessborough
,
I
be
proud
to
be
from
Cork
but
what
be
happen
in
Bessborough
at
the
moment
be
very
disturbing
for
any
decent
Cork
person
.
we
all
want
a
process
that
ensure
there
be
memorialisation
but
that
we
do
not
fall
foul
of
the
coronial
process
where
remains
be
find
because
that
be
a
long
-
establish
process
and
it
be
base
on
legislation
.
we
need
to
find
some
compromise
in
the
legislation
between
the
two
view
around
that
and
that
will
be
a
challenge
for
we
;
I
say
that
honestly
and
openly
.
I
ask
Mr.
Dodd
about
the
balance
of
argument
as
between
memorialise
the
entirety
of
the
site
and
the
responsibility
that
exist
in
respect
of
adhere
to
the
coronial
process
in
circumstance
where
remains
be
find
.
I
ask
whether
the
creation
of
a
agency
in
such
circumstance
could
undermine
any
process
as
to
natural
justice
for
the
person
who
may
be
bury
in
Bessborough
base
on
the
balance
of
probability
and
Mr.
Parfrey
's
submission
.
how
do
we
strike
a
balance
between
memorialise
the
entirety
of
the
site
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
coronial
process
where
remains
be
discover
be
not
compromise
?
I
be
talk
about
the
legal
element
of
this
,
as
see
from
Mr.
Dodd
's
position
as
a
barrister
at
law
.
the
legislation
before
we
be
clear
on
create
a
agency
.
Mr.
Dodd
have
express
a
very
legitimate
view
on
close
off
a
specific
element
of
the
site
,
and
we
be
very
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
he
be
speak
about
a
very
specific
part
of
it
.
he
have
already
articulate
that
very
well
.
I
be
refer
to
the
law
,
however
.
could
Mr.
Dodd
express
a
opinion
on
the
law
and
the
coronial
process
as
it
relate
to
the
entirety
of
the
Bessborough
site
?
it
may
be
that
he
have
not
consider
that
point
,
which
be
entirely
legitimate
,
but
if
he
have
a
opinion
on
it
I
would
dearly
love
to
hear
it
.
we
will
keep
go
.
I
will
take
further
question
from
that
who
wish
to
contribute
more
to
the
process
.
be
there
any
other
contributor
?
we
be
about
to
wind
down
proceedings
but
,
before
we
do
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
will
be
a
oral
hearing
in
respect
of
the
Bessborough
planning
application
on
Wednesday
,
21
April
.
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
that
process
will
bring
in
term
of
close
investigation
of
the
issue
of
investigation
.
I
be
hopeful
that
if
there
be
people
watch
from
a
Bord
Pleanála
now
,
they
will
have
regard
to
how
the
Oireachtas
be
consider
this
matter
and
the
pertinent
point
that
have
be
make
by
we
contributor
today
.
it
should
be
note
that
we
contributor
have
make
the
point
that
survivor
be
not
against
planning
per
se
,
but
there
must
be
due
regard
and
recognition
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
site
and
a
process
must
put
in
place
to
deal
with
all
of
that
.
that
be
absolutely
note
.
will
either
of
the
party
from
Cork
be
party
to
that
a
Bord
Pleanála
process
when
it
emerge
?
unless
anybody
else
want
to
come
in
,
I
be
now
of
a
mind
to
close
the
meeting
.
please
do
.
I
will
give
Mr.
Higgins
a
few
minute
.
please
do
not
.
I
do
not
see
anyone
else
signal
to
speak
at
this
juncture
.
be
Senator
Seery
Kearney

again
?
I
thank
Senator
Seery
Kearney
.
on
that
note
,
I
propose
that

be

view
that

with
the
legislation
,

legislation
as
draft
on
the
coronial
process
?
I
thank
Ms
Ryan
-
O'Brien
for
that
answer
.
we
be
try
to
interrogate
the
whole
issue
around
thing
such
as
DNA
storage
.
we
know
from
Mr.
Tansey
,
in
a
submission
to
the
committee
from
the
group
he
work
with
in
Tuam
,
that
survivor
would
have
they
DNA
take
and
store
for
possible
match
with
baby
's
remains
that
be
exhume
.
since
then
,
two
of
they
group
have
die
but
no
DNA
have
yet
be
collect
from
any
survivor
who
accordingly
be
increasingly
anxious
.
therein
lie
the
terrible
hurt
that
can
be
relieve
in
the
short
term
.
it
be
about
create
a
system
where
evidence
gathering
be
robust
such
that
the
restorative
justice
and
the
transitional
justice
that
be
be
speak
about
be
base
on
a
set
of
structure
and
protocol
whereby
a
person
have
somebody
to
interface
with
where
thing
such
as
DNA
be
examine
and
there
be
a
investigatory
process
that
tally
with
the
law
of
the
land
.
that
be
why
I
be
ask
about
the
coronial
process
.
perhaps
Mr.
O'Brien
could
address
that
further
because
I
be
grapple
with
it
at
the
moment
.
I
just
want
to
say
a
really
sincere
"
thank
you
"
to
everybody
for
come
here
today
and
to
Ms
Ryan
-
O'Brien
and
Mr.
O'Brien
for
virtually
diall
in
.
it
be
a
strange
format
when
one
have
people
speak
from
a
screen
.
it
be
great
,
give
the
Covid
regulation
,
that
we
be
still
able
to
have
this
debate
.
it
have
be
good
to
hear
from
people
so
directly
impact
,
particularly
Ms
Coughlan
,
Ms
Larkin
and
Mr.
Herdman
.
theirs
be
the
real
story
.
it
be
so
important
for
we
in
do
pre-legislative
scrutiny
that
we
get
the
opportunity
to
hear
from
as
many
people
as
possible
.
for
we
,
when
we
be
compile
we
report
on
this
,
it
will
be
invaluable
.
it
probably
be
not
easy
for
people
come
in
today
but
we
appreciate
it
.
we
would
not
be
able
to
do
the
work
without
they
.
it
have
be
invaluable
.
I
say
a
very
sincere
"
thank
you

.
I
just
need
to
get
agreement
to
publish
the
open
statement
to
the

agree

I
be
in
Leinster
House
,
the
1932
annexe
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
be
present
.
I
also
thank
she
for
the
very
professional
manner
in
which
she
deal
with
query
from
my
constituency
office
on
individual
case
.
I
record
my
gratitude
to
she
for
she
engagement
with
I
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
and
people
in
the
Cork
region
who
live
outside
my
constituency
.
I
will
start
with
the
private
Member
's
motion
tab
by
the
Labour
Party
last
week
.
I
question
the
Minister
of
State
about
the
figure
during
the
debate
.
I
have
tab
a
parliamentary
question
for
answer
on
8
April
which
show
that
the
total
number
of
overdue
application
for
a
assessment
of
need
,
AON
,
be
run
at
50078
,
give
or
take
.
I
need
some
reconciliation
of
the
figure
give
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
tell
we
today
.
there
be
a
slight
discrepancy
between
what
be
in
the
script
we
receive
and
the
script
the
Minister
of
State
deliver
.
she
state
she
be
pleased
to
inform
the
committee
that
by
the
end
of
April
we
have
reduce
the
waiting
list
to
approximately
1500
case
.
the
information
I
receive
be
50078
versus
1500
case
.
that
be
the
first
point
.
could
the
minister
of
State
give
we
a
perspective
on
that
?
perhaps
in
accountancy
term
,
a
reconciliation
statement
need
to
be
do
and
that
might
require
I
tab
a
further
parliamentary
question
or
perhaps
the
minister
of
State
could
write
to
the
committee
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
the
Minister
of
State
,
she
Department
or
the
HSE
could
communicate
with
the
Department
to
correct
the
information
or
inform
the
committee
because
we
rely
heavily
on
this
figure
.
I
take
she
point
and
thank
she
for
she
clarification
.
I
will
run
through
my
question
very
quickly
as
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
the
interim
review
of
the
sop
be
due
to
take
place
.
be
there
a
set
of
term
and
condition
or
term
of
reference
for
the
sop
and
will
that
include
take
testimonial
from
parent
?
follow
on
from
the
point
make
by
deputy
Cairn
,
it
would
be
vitally
important
that
parent
would
be
part
of
that
process
.
if
this
issue
be
a
matter
for
jurisprudence
at
the
moment
,
that
would
certainly
worry
I
.
as
a
member
of
the
committee
I
would
have
to
be
confident
that
this
be
not
go
to
be
just
a
box
-
ticking
exercise
.
I
be
concerned
about
the
possibility
that
it
be
go
to
vindicate
the
exist
sop
and
then
we
be
out
the
gap
in
2022
with
the
box
tick
and
we
must
do
retrospective
work
on
what
could
potentially
be
flaw
aon
.
I
be
genuinely
worried
that
we
would
have
a
problem
down
the
line
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
do
not
know
how
much
time
I
have
leave
.
I
will
ask
a
question
.
again
,
it
be
about
a
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
on
30
April
where
I
ask
about
additional
staff
recruitment
in
CHO
4
since
2018
.
the
reference
number
of
the
question
be
20364/21
.
I
be
inform
that
there
be
one
whole
-
time
equivalent
speech
and
language
therapist
for
the
cope
Foundation
,
one
speech
and
language
therapist
for
north
Cork
in
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
,
one
occupational
therapist
for
the
South
Lee
Brother
of
Charity
,
one
occupational
therapist
for
the
cope
Foundation
in
north
Lee
,
one
occupational
therapist
for
north
Cork
in
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
and
one
speech
and
language
therapist
in
south
Lee
.
I
do
not
expect
the
Minister
of
State
to
internalise
all
of
that
,
but
I
have
give
she
the
reference
number
of
the
parliamentary
question
and
she
staff
will
probably
have
regard
to
that
.
the
point
be
that
there
have
only
be
one
of
each
type
of
therapist
in
each
of
the
sector
in
north
Lee
,
north
Cork
,
south
Lee
,
north
Cork
,
north
Cork
and
south
Lee
.
I
refer
to
speech
and
language
therapist
and
occupational
therapist
.
it
be
never
go
to
be
enough
to
meet
demand
.
that
be
dismal
figure
in
term
of
the
follow
-
on
from
the
aon
and
the
need
for
access
to
the
service
.
it
be
very
hard
to
see
how
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
able
to
provide
service
to
support
people
in
each
of
that
area
unless
there
be
a
serious
effort
in
respect
of
recruitment
.
I
put
that
information
before
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
want
to
ask
that
question
when
I
have
the
opportunity
.
I
want
to
say
a
very
sincere
thanks
to
the
Minister
of
State
.
some
of
the
question
stray
outside
she
exact
remit
but
she
be
very
fair
and
honest
in
she
answer
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
a
very
difficult
role
.
I
know
that
she
be
push
and
advocate
greatly
and
do

I

I
thank
the
chairman
.
I
be
in
Leinster
House
.
I
join
other
in
welcoming
the
minister
to
the
committee
.
I
will
read
briefly
from
the
minister
's
open
statement
:
careful
attention
be
be
pay
in
draft
to
the
specific
relationship
between
the
coroner
and
the
agency
to
make
sure
that
investigative
obligation
which
currently
lie
with
the
coronial
service
be
not
undermine
.
the
position
be
that
nothing
in
the
legislation
should
preclude
further
investigation
if
that
be
warrant
.
the
minister
will
hear
very
clearly
from
member
the
doubt
and
worry
that
be
be
express
with
regard
to
the
disapplying
of
the
power
of
the
coroner
.
we
all
know
that
a
person
of
no
less
standing
than
Professor
Phil
Scraton
submit
to
the
committee
,
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
hear
.
when
talk
about
the
legislation
,
Professor
Scraton
say
:
...
its
enactment
would
disapply
exist
power
of
the
coroner
in
whatever
location
and
in
respect
of
all
death
over
which
a
new
agency
be
give
jurisdiction
.
the
Bill
imply
that
family
of
infant
and
mother
who
die
in
institutional
custody
will
be
compel
to
make
a
choice
between
exhumation
and
identification
of
they
relative
's
remains
follow
by
reinterment
...
[
or
]
the
coroner
retain
the
power
to
hold
a
inquest
to
confirm
the
decease
's
identity
,
approximately
when
...
[
they
]
die
,
where
...
[
they
]
die
and
,
most
important
,
how
...
[
they
]
die
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
he
have
not
adequately
address
thus
far
the
proposal
to
disapply
the
power
of
the
coroner
.
I
remain
very
doubtful
about
this
piece
of
legislation
at
present
on
the
basis
that
witness
after
expert
witness
,
from
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
to
Professor
Scraton
,
have
all
express
they
deep
concern
about
the
disapplication
of
that
power
.
I
do
not
care
if
this
be
a
misuse
of
that
word
.
I
do
not
believe
the
minister
have
adequately
address
the
elephant
in
the
room
today
.
I
would
love
to
hear
he
view
on
that
first
point
.
I
do
understand
this
.
I
apologise
for
cut
across
the
minister
but
my
time
be
limited
.
I
have
note
this
and
I
have
internalise
what
the
minister
have
say
in
respect
of
this
point
.
if
he
be
say
that
we
cannot
have
a
cross-
jurisdictional
regime
and
there
have
to
be
consistency
in
respect
of
the
coronial
process
,
or
a
system
of
investigation
,
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
legislation
before
we
still
do
not
robustly
instill
within
it
a
coronial
process
akin
to
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
standard
that
apply
in
respect
of
death
and
the
investigative
process
arise
from
they
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
he
still
have
not
adequately
address
this
issue
in
the
proposal
before
we
today
.
this
be
the
elephant
in
the
room
.
I
cannot
move
on
with
the
legislation
until
we
have
deal
with
this
issue
sufficiently
.
the
minister
be
say
he
will
consider
this
element
of
the
legislation
to
ensure
no
element
could
be
construe
as
provide
a
barrier
to
any
investigation
.
I
be
not
see
the
evidence
of
this
come
forward
in
the
wording
.
forgive
I
if
I
have
miss
this
in
dispatch
.
I
ask
the
chair
to
forgive
I
if
I
be
over
time
.
I
do
not
know
how
much
latitude
I
have
.
what
make
I
uncomfortable
be
the
issue
of
what
the
minister
describe
as
"
manifestly
inappropriate
"
and
the
criterion
that
be
to
be
set
down
in
the
first
instance
by
the
agency
to
determine
what
be
or
be
not
manifestly
inappropriate
.
even
if
we
take
exhumation
and
investigation
,
be
there
a
fear
that
the
power
of
the
coroner
and
the
coronial
process
will
be
undermine
?
to
refer
to
what
Professor
Scraton
tell
the
committee
,
9000
,
or
15
%
,
of
infant
bear
in
the
institution
examine
die
there
,
in
addition
to
the
death
of
200
mother
.
we
know
the
rate
of
mortality
be
extremely
high
and
I
would
have
think
this
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
ensure
there
be
no
ambiguity
on
the
issue
of
the
discretion
of
the
government
of
the
day
to
put
in
place
,
or
set
up
,
a
agency
as
it
see
fit
.
if
the
number
of
death
be
so
high
,
and
if
we
know
from
the
commission
's
report
that
the
mortality
rate
in
institution
be
extremely
high
,
this
in
and
of
itself
surely
be
worthy
of
investigation
,
such
that
a
minister
cannot
limit
the
power
to
investigate
it
if
the
government
of
the
day
decide
for
economic
reason
not
to
go
there
and
not
to
open
that
casket
because
it
could
be
at
it
for
year
and
investigation
could
cost
the
State
million
of
euro
.
if
we
go
down
the
road
in
the
Bill
of
be
influence
by
economic
factor
and
not
factor
of
transitional
justice
,
such
as
the
convention
on
enforce
disappearance
,
the
obligation
of
investigation
and
the
rights
to
remedy
,
then
we
will
come
back
to
this
down
the
line
.
I
be
on
the
side
of
the
minister
but
I
want
to
be
reassure
by
what
he
be
tell
we
about
the
legislation
be
robust
enough
to
ensure
justice
will
not
be
deny
in
future
to
people
or
relative
and
to
that
poor
soul
who
have
the
right
to
justice
.
forgive
I
as
I
do
not
mean
to
be
rhetorical
about
this
but
I
want
to
be
sure
we
get
it
absolutely
right
.
forgive
I
if
I
repeat
some
point
that
have
already
be
make
.
if
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
power
of
the
coroner
be
be
disapply
on
two
out
of
three
set
of
criterion
,
which
be
what
the
minister
be
say
,
but
that
the
power
of
investigation
be
not
diminish
in
any
way
because
that
be
the
law
of
the
land
,
the
legitimate
question
arise
about
the
number
of
agency
involve
.
refer
to
Tuam
specifically
-
and
thank
goodness
for
the
work
of
Catherine
Corless
and
other
-
we
reasonably
know
where
we
stand
and
what
be
ahead
of
we
in
the
road
ahead
as
this
application
apply
.
if
I
refresh
my
memory
,
we
have
a
presentation
from
the
historical
burial
legislation
unit
-
the
minister
's
own
colleague
-
where
they
say
that
the
legislation
be
be
apply
because
exist
jurisdiction
to
authorise
exhumation
do
not
readily
apply
to
the
particularly
unusual
circumstance
arise
at
Tuam
,
and
similarly
the
legislation
govern
the
identification
of
remains
by
means
of
DNA
comparison
be
not
suitable
for
that
circumstance
.
we
know
why
we
be
legislate
.
I
have
a
final
request
for
the
minister
.
if
we
accept
that
the
power
of
the
coroner
be
not
diminish
in
any
way
will
the
minister
give
this
committee
some
comfort
that
resource
will
be
make
available
for
the
recruitment
of
a
additional
number
of
coroner
,
or
give
we
a
assurance
that
the
coronial
process
as
it
apply
to
the
creation
of
a
agency
in
respect
of
a
specific
site
or
other
follow
-
on
site
will
not
be
hamper
by
the
lack
of
adequate
coronial
service
,
such
as
for
the
effort
in
seek
justice
and
the
effort
in
seek
to
identify
remains
,
and
that
this
service
be
not
undermine
by
a
lack
of
resource
?
that
be
my
question
,
fundamentally
.
I
have
a
second
point
for
the
minister
.
there
be
one
limited
power
that
individual
member
of
the
Oireachtas
have
,
which
be
the
power
to
submit
the
parliamentary
question
.
I
hope
that
something
would
be
build
into
this
legislation
on
the
accountability
feature
that
allow
for
I
,
as
a
member
of
the
Oireachtas
,
to
make
representation
on
behalf
of
a
person
or
family
who
may
wish
to
seek
information
.
I
hope
that
the
making
of
that
representation
or
the
advocate
for
family
,
which
be
what
we
all
do
as
member
,
would
not
be
diminish
in
any
way
and
that
some
structure
could
be
put
in
place
so
member
could
assist
such
person
,
and
that
gdpr
and
other
barrier
would
not
be
put
up
in
front
of
we
.
again
,
I
just
want
to
be
very
clear
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
forgive
I
,
and
I
know
he
be
not
deliberately
misinterpret
what
I
be
say
.
I
be
talk
about
the
resourcing
of
the
coronial
service
,
and
that
be
a
matter
for
the
government
.
I
recognise
that
silo
exist
in
Department
,
but
the
minister
be
the
line
manager
,
as
it
be
,
for
the
setting
up
of
this
agency
.
therefore
,
if
there
be
to
be
a
extensive
coronial
investigative
process
in
this
regard
,
I
ask
that
it
will
not
be
hamper
.
that
be
presumably
a
whole
-
of
-
government
matter
and
not
just
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
.
therefore
,
I
take
the
point
the
minister
be
make
about
the
review
,
but
I
ask
he
to
use
he
good
office
to
ensure
that
when
a
agency
be
create
that
it
will
not
be
hamper
by
the
lack
of
investigative
power
due
to
the
unavailability
of
a
coroner
or
coroner
or
other
such
appropriate
staff
as
might
be
deem
necessary
to
carry
out
investigation
.
again
,
I
be
not
ask
for
the
disapplication
of
the-----
I
be
sorry
,
I
apologise
.
that
be
fine
,
but
I
want
to
be
clear
that
I
be
not
ask
for
the
disapplication
of
gdpr
.
GDPR
be
sometimes
put
up
as
a
block
to
Teachtaí
in
respect
of
certain
agency
which
be
subset
of
Department
.
it
be
sometimes
misapply
,
and
I
do
not
want
that
to
happen
in
this
case
.
the
minister
be
again
tell
we
that
the
coronial
process
be
be
disapply
in
two
out
of
three
criterion
,
if
I
understand
he
correctly
.
I
may
be
mishear
the
minister
,
but
he
appear
now
to
be
say
that
the
coronial
process
be
be
completely
disapply
.
my
hearing
could
be
at
fault
or
I
might
be
misinterpret
the
minister
.
if
I
be
,
I
will
stand
correct
.
however
,
there
need
to
be
clarity
in
this
regard
,
because
I
be
a
little
more
confused
after
the
minister
's
last
intervention
than
I
be
before
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
forgive
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
I
thank
the
chairman
and
look
forward
to
talk
to
member
of
the
committee

the

I
be
in
Leinster
House
.
I
thank
everyone
who
have
make
a
submission
to
this
process
.
it
have
be
informative
for
we
,
and
certainly
I
.
I
do
not
expect
to
be
call
so
soon
,
as
I
do
not
realise
that
there
be
so
many
member
miss
,
but
I
will
start
with
the
many
question
that
be
raise
by
the
Adoption
Authority
in
its
open
statement
.
do
Ms
Traynor
believe
that
there
be
still
many
question
on
resourcing
,
timeframe
and
so
on
that
have
not
be
adequately
answer
in
the
authority
's
interaction
with
the
Department
on
this
legislation
?
I
do
not
want
to
misinterpret
she
but
it
seem
that
,
from
she
question
at
this
meeting
,
the
import
be
that
there
be
still
many
unanswered
question
in
respect
of
this
legislation
.
be
I
right
in
assume
that
or
be
I
read
too
much
into
it
from
Ms
Traynor
's
submission
?
she
can
be
as
frank
as
she
like
.
in
its
submission
,
the
Adoption
Authority
write
:
can
birth
parent
apply
to
get
they
child
's
birth
and
adoption
record
?
could
this
be
include
in
propose
legislation
?
the
Authority
believe
that
consideration
need
to
be
give
on
the
implication
of
release
personal
information
,
for
example
,
a
person
name
as
birth
father
on
record
which
late
prove
to
be
incorrect
.
what
be
inform
that
point
?
what
exactly
be
Ms
Traynor
say
there
?
what
be
she
concern
,
in
plain
language
?
be
there
a
statistically
significant
number
of
example
-
and
I
suppose
one
be
statistically
significant
in
this
case
-
of
a
person
be
name
as
birth
father
on
a
record
that
prove
to
be
incorrect
.
how
many
such
scenario
have
Ms
Traynor
encounter
?
how
many
do
she
envisage
encounter
in
the
future
?
Mr.
O'Mahony
make
a
point
on
adoption
record
be
disperse
and
fragment
between
agency
and
geographical
location
.
how
would
the
legislation
deal
sufficiently
with
that
?
what
be
the
solution
to
that
?
I
thank
Mr.
Gloster
and
we
witness
.

I

have
the
data
Protection
Commission
reach
the
end
of
the
line
in
its
involvement
with
this
legislation
?
I
ask
this
because
if
there
be
to
be
a
datum
protection
impact
analysis
,
presumably
the
DPC
be
still
in
,
what
I
would
call
,
a
iterative
process
in
respect
of
the
legislation
.
I
ask
Mr.
Sunderland
for
clarity
on
that
.
I
be
try
to
think
forward
to
where
there
might
be
-
I
will
use
the
word
"
dispute
"
,
though
lightly
-
a
dispute
between
two
party
,
the
parent
and
the
child
.
if
it
reach
the
point
where
there
be
a
dispute
,
where
do
the
DPC
see
itself
in
term
of
the
exist
legislation
in
respect
of
dispute
resolution
and
in
the
context
of
this
legislation
when
it
be
pass
?
in
other
word
,
when
there
be
compete
party
,
as
I
understand
it
,
the
DPC
seek
to
mediate
between
they
.
if
a
situation
arise
,
however
,
that
be
beyond
mediation
or
agreement
,
where
stand
the
DPC
in
all
of
that
?
I
hope
that
question
make
sense
.
if
it
do
not
,
tell
I
straight
out
.
this
be
a
issue
that
be
on
my
mind
and
I
want
to
seek
clarity
on
it
.
Mr.
Sunderland
have
confirm
what
I
think
.
this
be
a
iterative
process
and
the
DPC
have
yet
to
fully
analyse
or
process
the
datum
protection
impact
assessment
.
in
light
of
that
,
and
once
that
analysis
be
do
,
I
ask
the
chair
if
there
be
a
possibility
of
hear
further
from
the
DPC
on
how
this
legislation
work
in
the
context
of
its
responsibility
?
I
would
welcome
a
further
submission
on
that
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
.
I
thank
Ms
Gibney
.
I
thank
all
we

we
look
forward
to

engagement

can
I

starting
with
the
individual
family
support
plan
,
I
have
a
parliamentary
question
on
this
issue
answer
by
Mr.
O'Regan
.
it
be
date
24
May
2022
.
in
that
question
,
I
ask
the
Minister
of
Health
the
number
of
individualised
family
service
plan
issue
and
accept
by
each
cdnt
,
break
down
by
CHO
area
.
the
response
I
get
be
that
the
individual
family
support
plan
process
be
a
live
one
,
in
that
the
team
and
family
keep
it
under
review
while
service
support
and
strategy
be
be
implement
and
as
the
need
and
achievement
of
the
child
and
family
change
.
be
the
output
of
the
individual
family
support
plan
be
measure
as
this
process
be
be
roll
out
?
where
I
be
go
with
this
question
be
towards
try
to
get
at
the
experience
of
the
family
that
interface
with
the
service
.
on
this
same
issue
,
we
have
now
create
another
bolt
-
on
aspect
to
the
experience
of
the
family
and
the
child
.
the
experience
of
family
of
which
I
be
aware
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
reflect
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
service
.
family
be
afraid
that
they
be
be
send
down
yet
another
road
and
to
another
service
that
they
must
sign
up
to
get
access
to
service
.
I
be
not
go
to
be
rhetorical
.
I
just
ask
the
HSE
to
be
mindful
of
this
point
and
if
it
can
do
that
,
it
would
be
good
.
we
know
what
the
experience
of
family
be
.
we
all
know
they
be
jaded
now
.
let
we
take
that
as
a
give
.
we
all
accept
that
.
if
I
dovetail
the
individual
family
support
plan
process
now
with
the
creation
of
the
cDNT
,
then
this
be
again
about
measurement
.
turn
to
Ms
O'Neill
,
another
parliamentary
question
I
submit
ask
"
the
number
of
child
that
have
be
transfer
from
Children
's
Disability
Network
Team
back
to
primary
care
on
foot
of
assessment
since
April
2021
,
by
age
,
CHO
and
LHO
in
tabular
form
and
general
categorisation
for
such
a
transfer
back
to
primary
care
operation
"
.
Ms
O'Neill
's
response
to
I
state
,
"
though
there
be
no
specific
timeline
on
when
the
system
will
be
available
,
I
can
confirm
that
there
have
be
a
procurement
process
and
the
system
be
now
at
the
development
stage
.
"
again
,
we
do
not
have
a
live
measurement
of
the
family
's
experience
as
they
be
go
through
the
system
.
they
be
again
be
ask
to
sign
up
to
a
cdnt
process
and
they
be
wonder
how
many
more
arguably
bureaucratic
process
they
will
have
to
go
through
before
they
can
get
access
to
the
speech
and
language
therapist
,
SLT
,
the
occupational
therapist
,
OT
,
the
psychologist
and
all
the
therapy
service
.
do
the
witness
appreciate
where
I
be
come
from
in
this
regard
?
we
must
ensure
that
parent
and
child
be
minded
in
this
context
.
the
bottom
line
in
all
of
this
be
still
access
to
the
service
,
notwithstand
all
the
issue
we
be
talk
about
here
concern
recruitment
,
which
be
,
effectively
,
the
big
elephant
in
the
room
.
I
just
want
to
hear
from
witness
from
the
HSE
that
they
be
go
to
be
careful
and
mindful
of
family
in
this
process
.
I
be
happy
for
Ms
O'Neill
to
answer
because
she
reply
with
the
letter
respond
to
my
parliamentary
question
.
I
will
keep
move
on
because
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
do
we
know
how
many
therapist
,
by
they
designation
as
SLT
and
ot
,
have
leave
the
cDNT
since
January
2022
?
if
we
know
the
answer
to
that
question
,
do
we
know
if
that
people
have
be
replace
?
what
be
the
status
of
the
individual
file
?
I
ask
this
because
,
again
,
we
have
the
child
interface
with
a
service
,
and
he
or
she
have
already
start
to
do
so
in
this
case
.
one
person
who
be
a
part
of
deliver
that
service
then
leave
,
for
all
sort
of
appropriate
reason
,
and
,
suddenly
,
that
child
and
the
family
be
leave
in
limbo
.
they
do
not
know
where
they
stand
.
I
will
ask
my
fourth
question
and
then
I
will
be
do
.
can
I
ask
my
final
question
?
my
last
question
concern
the
section
39
organisation
.
if
I
be
read
Mr.
Reid
and
the
Minister
of
State
correctly
concern
the
need
to
address
the
imbalance
here
on
the
pay
parity
side
,
there
be
a
responsibility
,
and
I
say
this
respectfully
,
on
the
government
to
engage
with
the
trade
union
and
the
representative
of
employee
to
address
this
subject
.
I
say
this
because
,
and
the
Co-Chair
will
attest
to
this
,
we
have
a
facility
in
north
County
Cork
,
namely
,
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
locate
at
Cooleens
House
,
and
every
time
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
-
and
there
be
a
plethora
of
they
now
-
the
response
I
get
back
refer
to
the
problem
of
recruitment
and
be
unable
to
recruit
.
my
fear
be
that
what
have
happen
be
that
people
have
move
over
from
one
service
to
another
,
because
,
whether
people
like
it
or
not
,
there
be
this
perception
that
there
be
this
type
of
Darwinian
system
where
the
HSE
have
recruit
and
take
on
people
from
section
38
and
39
organisation
because
of
good
term
and
condition
.
if
we
do
not
address
this
aspect
,
we
will
be
at
nothing
.
chairman
,
my
question
be
not
answer
.
I
refer
to
the
specific
question
I
have
about
what
happen
in
a
cdnt
when
somebody
leave
and
there
be
a
live
file
.
what
happen
to
the
file
?
what
be
the
legitimate
expectation
of
the
child
and
he
or
she
family
in
respect
of
that
file
?
I
need
a
answer
to
that
question
because
I
have
case
where
that
have
happen
.
the
second
point
I
make
that
be
not
address
be
pay
inequality
.
Mr.
Reid
say
he
meet
with
the
section
39
organisation
,
I
think
he
say
specifically
.
I
would
like
to
know
what
the
nature
of
that
discussion
be
and
whether
the
issue
of
pay
parity
and
equality
of
pay
come
up
.
there
be
a
elephant
in
the
room
here
.
I
reference
St.
Joseph's
Foundation
but
it
be
one
of
many
service
provider
where
the
same
thing
be
happen
,
namely
,
they
cannot
open
service
and
they
remain
close
because
the
provider
cannot
recruit
.
I
be
be
tell
they
cannot
because
they
be
compete
with
the
HSE
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
Mr.
Reid
about
how
the
HSE
intend
to
grasp
the
nettle
on
that
one
and
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
then
as
far
as
ensure
we
have
parity
be
concerned
.
deputy
Tully
be
here
early
and
open
up
with
that
very
point
.
we
need
to
address
that
point
.
I
would
like
some
response
from
-----
what
about
my
question
on
the
file
?
I
be
not
go
to
let
that
one
go
.
we
be
way
over
time
,
but
the
importance
of
this
meeting
justify
that
.
I
thank
the
delegation
from
the
HSE
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
official
from
the
Department
for
be
here
.
this
have
be
a
joint
meeting
aim
at
try
to
address
the
issue
under
discussion
.
it
be
important
that
it
have
be
accept
here
this
morning
there
be
failure
in
respect
of
child
right
across
the
spectrum
.
when
I
take
the
job
of
chair
of
my
committee
,
I
state
that
the
Taoiseach
would
go
before
the
House
to
apologise
for
the
way
the
State
have
treat
child
with
disability
.
that
be
evident
from
the
meeting
.
a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what
need
to
be
do
.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
question
I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE
versus
the
Department
of
Health
discussion
as
to
what
legislation
need
to
be
change
and
what
need
to
be
do
.
from
the
way
the
meeting
have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as
regards
the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent
day
where
,
in
the
past
two
or
three
week
,
people
who
have
be
on
temporary
contract
with
the
HSE
or
with
one
of
the
service
provider
have
not
have
they
contract
renew
.
they
have
have
to
proceed
somewhere
else
to
get
a
permanent
contract
because
they
be
look
to
purchase
house
or
to
do
the
normal
day
-
to
-
day
living
thing
.
that
have
leave
vacancy
within
the
service
for
people
with
disability
,
whether
that
be
in
respite
,
in
the
HSE
or
in
section
38
or
39
organisation
.
as
everybody
here
have
accept
,
there
be
a
shortage
of
staff
within
all
of
the
service
.
we
have
see
in
the
past
week
or
two
that
people
have
have
to
leave
the
service
because
the
State
have
not
do
its
business
in
ensure
that
staff
member
be
retain
.
we
have
hear
it
from
different
area
that
there
have
be
a
brain
drain
.
we
have
people
here
who
have
give
they
time
to
care
,
who
understand
people
with
disability
,
who
care
passionately
about
they
and
about
improve
they
life
,
and
we
need
to
ensure
we
be
keep
that
people
within
the
service
.
the
section
38
and
39
organisation
and
the
parity
of
esteem
in
pay
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
deal
with
because
every
logjam
must
be
remove
to
ensure
we
keep
all
the
good
people
in
the
service
.
I
make
the
point
in
the
dáil
yesterday
in
another
debate
that
the
recruitment
drive
have
to
involve
a
overseas
element
as
well
.
on
the
point
that
be
make
in
respect
of
the
high
education
minister
,
we
need
to
have
everybody
work
on
board
here
.
the
State
,
the
HSE
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
we
committee
here
need
to
accept
that
,
while
this
morning
's
meeting
be
a
very
thorough
meeting
,
from
here
on
we
have
to
try
to
ensure
we
be
do
something
meaningful
to
change
this
.
we
would
hope
,
if
they
schedule
allow
it
,
to
have
both
the
Department
and
the
HSE
back
here
in
the
autumn
to
review
this
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
the
member
today
be
be
address
and
that
the
family
,
the
child
,
the
life
and
the
live
experience
of
people
with
disability
who
have
be
fail
by
the
State
improve
from
here
on
in
.
that
be
what
we
committee
and
everybody
here
be
charge
with
,
and
we
hope
to
do
that
.
I
thank
sincerely
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
for
she
dedication
to
the
job
,
the
HSE
and

a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what
need
to

at
the
very

of

I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE

discussion
as

what

from
the
way
the

have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as

the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent
day
where
,
in
the

two

three

,
people
who

on
what
need
to
be
do
.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
question
I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE
versus
the
Department
of
Health
discussion
as
to
what
legislation
need
to
be
change
and
what
need
to
be
do
.
from
the
way
the
meeting
have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as
regards
the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent
day
where
,
in
the
past
two
or
three
week
,
people
who
have
be
on
temporary
contract
with
the
HSE
or
with
one
of
the
service
provider
have
not
have
they
contract
renew
.
they
have
have
to
proceed
somewhere
else
to
get
a
permanent
contract
because
they
be
look
to
purchase
house
or
to
do
the
normal
day
-
to
-
day
living
thing
.
that
have
leave
vacancy
within
the
service
for
people
with
disability
,
whether
that
be
in
respite
,
in
the
HSE
or
in
section
38
or
39
organisation
.
as
everybody
here
have
accept
,
there
be
a
shortage
of
staff
within
all
of
the
service
.
we
have
see
in
the
past
week
or
two
that
people
have
have
to
leave
the
service
because
the
State
have
not
do
its
business
in
ensure
that
staff
member
be
retain
.
we
have
hear
it
from
different
area
that
there
have
be
a
brain
drain
.
we
have
people
here
who
have
give
they
time
to
care
,
who
understand
people
with
disability
,
who
care
passionately
about
they
and
about
improve
they
life
,
and
we
need
to
ensure
we
be
keep
that
people
within
the
service
.
the
section
38
and
39
organisation
and
the
parity
of
esteem
in
pay
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
deal
with
because
every
logjam
must
be
remove
to
ensure
we
keep
all
the
good
people
in
the
service
.
I
make
the
point
in
the
dáil
yesterday
in
another
debate
that
the
recruitment
drive
have
to
involve
a
overseas
element
as
well
.
on
the
point
that
be
make
in
respect
of
the
high
education
minister
,
we
need
to
have
everybody
work
on
board
here
.
the
State
,
the
HSE
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
we
committee
here
need
to
accept
that
,
while
this
morning
's
meeting
be
a
very
thorough
meeting
,
from
here
on
we
have
to
try
to
ensure
we
be
do
something
meaningful
to
change
this
.
we
would
hope
,
if
they
schedule
allow
it
,
to
have
both
the
Department
and
the
HSE
back
here
in
the
autumn
to
review
this
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
the
member
today
be
be
address
and
that
the
family
,
the
child
,
the
life
and
the
live
experience
of
people
with
disability
who
have
be
fail
by
the
State
improve
from
here
on
in
.
that
be
what
we
committee
and
everybody
here
be
charge
with
,
and
we
hope
to
do
that
.
I
thank
sincerely
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
for
she
dedication
to
the
job
,
the
HSE
and
the
official
present
,
we
own
team
here
,
all
the
member
of
the
two
joint
committee
,
and
deputy
Funchion
for
allow
I
to
chair
the
meeting
with
they
.
we
be
way
over
time
,
but
the
importance
of
this
meeting
justify
that
.
I
thank
the
delegation
from
the
HSE
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
official
from
the
Department
for
be
here
.
this
have
be
a
joint
meeting
aim
at
try
to
address
the
issue
under
discussion
.
it
be
important
that
it
have
be
accept
here
this
morning
there
be
failure
in
respect
of
child
right
across
the
spectrum
.
when
I
take
the
job
of
chair
of
my
committee
,
I
state
that
the
Taoiseach
would
go
before
the
House
to
apologise
for
the
way
the
State
have
treat
child
with
disability
.
that
be
evident
from
the
meeting
.
a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what

I
thank
sincerely
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
for
she
dedication
to
the
job
,
the

and
the
official
present
,
we
own
team
here
,
all
the
member
of
the
two
joint

,
and
deputy
Funchion
for
allow
I
to
chair
the
meeting
with
they
.
I
thank
we
guest
for
they
submission
.
it
be
very
well
research
.
this
be
the
first
time
I
have
see
some
sort
of
crystallisation
of
the
issue
of
vulnerability
among
that
cohort
of
about
10000
people
,
include
the
1274
in
the
18
-
to
-
24
-
year
-
old
category
.
they
come
to
we
,
as
public
representative
,
and
they
present
in
some
way
,
shape
or
form
but
we
just
do
not
know
how
to
deal
with
the
issue
.
there
be
no
playbook
for
any
deputy
or
Senator
for
deal
with
that
cohort
of
people
.
if
they
have
be
in
the
care
system
,
there
be
no
transition
,
and
if
they
have
not
and
they
be
identify
as
have
have
,
as
Mr.
Stanley
note
,
a
adverse
child
experience
,
they
just
fall
through
the
gap
.
when
I
talk
to
local
authority
,
there
do
not
seem
to
be
a
solution
there
either
.
the
question
be
how
we
can
help
this
people
transition
and
what
we
guest
have
come
up
with
be
,
potentially
,
a
way
forward
.
be
they
confident
they
can
get
sufficient
traction
with
this
strategy
such
that
resource
will
be
provide
,
give
this
will
be
about
resource
follow
on
from
they
organisation
's
advocacy
?
can
we
sort
it
out
?
be
there
a
sympathetic
ear
at
departmental
level
?
I
be
not
sure
how
much
time
I
have
.
the
Galway
example
involve
place
people
in
accommodation
.
what
be
the
real
-
time
experience
of
somebody
who
present
to
a
local
authority
,
for
instance
,
where
he
or
she
have
to
fill
out
a
housing
application
form
and
go
through
this
bureaucratic
process
?
be
it
know
by
people
on
the
ground
that
there
be
a
front
door
they
can
go
through
?
I
go
to
college
in
Galway
.
I
always
find
the
Galway
people
industrious
and
when
it
come
to
find
solution
to
problem
,
that
people
come
together
.
the
mighty
Corrib
unite
they
.
I
be
fascinate
that
they
have
develop
a
model
where
all
of
the
stakeholder
be
willing
partner
and
they
have
be
able
to
find
accommodation
and
to
have
the
wraparound
support
.
how
could
I
get
this
service
go
in
Cork
,
for
instance
,
which
be
where
I
be
from
?
I
could
see
some
challenge
in
break
down
the
silo
between
all
of
the
constituent
partner
that
would
be
need
to
come
together
on
this
.
although
not
insurmountable
,
this
be
challenge
nonetheless
.
have
the
Simon
Community
carry
out
research
,
either
academic
or
they
own
,
around
the
result
and
the
follow
-
on
of
individual
come
through
the
system
?
how
they
be
get
on
now
,
because
I
would
love
to
see
this
model
replicate
?
if
I
,
as
a
public
representative
,
could
guide
somebody
into
such
a
service
,
that
would
be
meaningful
for
I
instead
of
have
to
go
through
the
usual
frustration
that
we
experience
as
deputy
try
to
advocate
for
we
own
people
.
I
would
love
to
take
they
model
.
I
would
love
to
engage
in
the
research
that
they
have
carry
out
,
if
any
,
and
bring
it
to
Cork
,
for
instance
,
and
say
that
here
be
a
model
and
it
work
.
it
would
force
people
to
shake
off
they
own
preconception
about
young
people
who
be
present
to
they
because
often
they
experience
be
not
a
good
one
.
Ms
Feeney
crystallise
it
for
I
perfectly
in
term
of
the
snake
and
ladder
.
when
somebody
be
vulnerable
,
it
be
easy
for
I
to
talk
as
I
have
the
capacity
to
advocate
for
myself
.
not
everybody
else
do
and
they
need
that
support
.
what
be
they
perspective
on
how
we
could
replicate
this
model
and
get
the
political
buy
-
in
for
that
?
I
would
welcome
they
view
on
that
.
it
be
a
big
question
and
I
be
sorry
for
that
.
I
would
like
to
hear
more
about
ucc
.
can
I
presume
that
Mr.
Finnerty
would
be
more
than
familiar
with
the
model
in
Galway
?
I
welcome
we
guest
.
I
want
to
speak
about
foster
carer
.
I
receive
correspondence
from
a
foster
carer
who
be
also
a
social
worker
.
she
write
to
I
in
a
private
capacity
.
in
she
letter
she
state
she
worry
be
that
many
foster
carer
will
not
be
able
to
continue
to
do
what
they
do
and
that
it
will
not
be
affordable
for
people
to
consider
become
foster
carer
,
especially
as
foster
impact
on
a
carer
's
ability
to
be
available
for
other
pay
work
.
she
have
layer
much
more
into
the
letter
but
this
be
the
kernel
of
it
for
I
.
Mr.
Gloster
have
state
that
Tusla
's
strategic
plan
on
foster
care
service
be
approve
by
the
Tusla
board
on
Friday
,
30
September
2022
.
I
will
reflect
some
of
what
I
have
hear
from
foster
carer
about
the
letter
issue
to
they
.
they
find
the
letter
extremely
patronising
.
it
be
important
that
Tusla
hear
this
because
it
be
what
I
have
be
hear
from
foster
carer
.
they
engage
in
what
they
think
be
a
meaningful
process
after
which
one
of
the
recommendation
be
a
increase
in
allowance
and
financial
and
other
support
.
this
be
highlight
in
the
letter
from
Tusla
to
they
.
Mr.
Gloster
and
Ms
Duggan
say
they
hear
loud
and
clear
what
the
foster
carer
say
.
the
budget
come
after
this
.
all
that
arise
for
foster
carer
from
the
budgetary
process
,
in
which
I
assume
Tusla
be
directly
involved
with
its
parent
Department
and
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
be
a
allowance
of
€325
or
€350
.
do
Tusla
,
through
its
parent
department
,
make
a
specific
recommendation
that
the
allowance
to
foster
carer
should
be
increase
in
budget
2023
?
be
copy
of
this
correspondence
available
?
yes
,
I
do
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gloster
.
if
I
understand
he
correctly
he
be
say
that
as
a
organisation
Tusla
advocate
through
the
budgetary
process
with
the
Department
for
a
increase
in
allowance
.
if
there
be
some
evidence
of
this
it
would
assist
I
,
and
perhaps
the
committee
,
in
advocate
for
that
foster
carer
.
if
this
be
the
case
and
we
have
the
proof
of
it
,
we
can
ask
where
the
Department
be
in
its
engagement
with
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
we
can
ask
why
we
have
be
leave
with
a
situation
whereby
foster
carer
feel
extremely
patronise
by
the
fact
the
allowance
be
a
paltry
sum
by
any
objective
analysis
.
the
great
job
they
do
be
acknowledge
in
the
language
that
be
use
but
concrete
support
be
not
forthcoming
in
real
term
.
I
acknowledge
there
be
a
strategic
plan
but
I
be
not
sure
whether
,
follow
what
happen
with
the
budget
,
foster
carer
now
have
confidence
in
that
.
there
be
a
political
element
to
this
.
there
need
to
be
engagement
with
government
party
on
the
non-delivery
of
support
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
Tusla
have
actively
advocate
then
,
I
say
"
fair
play
"
to
it
.
this
must
be
acknowledge
and
there
be
a
line
of
question
that
must
be
pursue
with
the
minister
.
what
be
happen
with
Positive
Care
Ireland
?
have
it
be
wind
down
?
be
it
still
in
existence
?
what
be
its
status
?
it
be
very
much
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
-----
it
be
about
alternative
aftercare
service
for
all
young
adult
who
require
the
service
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gloster
.
I
thank
the
chair
for
she
guidance
on
this
and
I
respect
the
fact
it
be
previously

by
the
committee
.

just
want
the
most
up

to

this
be
a
instructive
discussion
and
I
be
lean
a
great
deal
.
I
welcome
the
Bill
.
Labour
support
it
and
note
the
observation
make
on
it
.
I
understand
that
IBEC
be
invite
to
attend
this
meeting
but
be
not
present
.
it
would
have
be
instructive
for
IBEC
to
attend
because
that
would
have
broaden
the
discussion
and
we
would
have
hear
the
employer
's
perspective
.
in
my
humble
opinion
,
that
IBEC
be
not
present
create
the
perception
that
this
be
not
a
matter
that
it
want
to
engage
on
constructively
with
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
maybe
it
be
wait
for
further
discussion
with
departmental
official
and
the
minister
on
the
government
's
Bill
.
fair
enough
if
that
be
the
case
,
but
it
be
rare
that
we
have
discussion
of
this
nature
where
we
have
the
trade
union
position
and
the
academic
position
.
this
be
good
day
in
that
respect
,
even
though
we
be
tackle
a
subject
matter
that
be
horrific
.
I
do
not
want
to
offend
Dr.
Nata
by
mispronounce
she
surname
,
so
I
will
call
she
"
Dr.
Nata
"
,
if
that
be
okay
.
I
wish
to
ask
she
about
the
key
issue
to
consider
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
the
Bill
.
she
refer
to
assess
"
the
universality
of
the
application
of
the
law
.
"
I
have
not
fully
internalise
what
she
mean
by
what
she
state
next
:
while
there
be
no
reference
to
the
size
of
the
enterprise
,
there
be
concern
about
the
extent
to
which
this
law
would
apply
to
small
entrepreneur
hire
only
one
or
two
employee
,
or
employee
without
contract
,
such
as
volunteer
or
other
informal
worker
.
when
consider
domestic
violence
,
it
be
important
to
understand
that
domestic
employment
or
employment
in
a
family
enterprise
[
she
write
submission
refer
here
to
farm
and
household
,
which
be
the
key
word
for
I
]
put
more
woman
at
risk
of
experience
domestic
violence
.
this
employee
be
outside
the
ambit
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
...
accord
to
she
,
it
be
not
clear
that
this
group
of
worker
come
under
the
remit
of
the
Bill
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
deputy
O'Reilly
will
comprehensively
address
this
point
,
but
be
there
a
potential
wording
that
could
be
offer
up
by
way
of
amendment
or
suggestion
to
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
that
would
strengthen
it
,
have
regard
to
,
ceteris
paribus
,
the
deputy
's
answer
?
if
this
provision
could
be
buttress
,
do
so
would
be
vital
.
there
be
not
only
deputy
O'Reilly
's
Bill
,
but
also
the
government
's
Bill
,
and
we
be
deal
with
both
.
in
the
intervention
that
all
of
the
witness
have
make
today
,
we
have
a
set
of
tool
to
strengthen
both
Bills
or
one
or
the
other
,
depend
on
which
be
before
we
first
.
I
welcome
this
Bill
.
if
it
could
be
strengthen
,
particularly
in
respect
of
farm
holding
and
domestic
situation
,
I
would
welcome
that
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
should
say
again
,
as
I
do
at
the
start
,
that
IBEC
have
a
schedule
issue
today
and
,
to
be
fair
to
they
,
it
be
possible
that
representative
be
not
able
to
make
it
due
to
diary
commitment
.
it
be
propose
to
publish
the
open
statement
on
the
Oireachtas
website
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
thank
the
member
and

for
attend
the

meeting

I
share
the
view
that
,
with
this
existential
crisis
in
Europe
,
the
essence
of
what
Europe
be
and
the
value
that
it
hold
be
under
threat
because
of
this
aggressive
act
by
Russia
.
we
as
Irish
people
have
a
responsibility
to
play
we
part
.
notwithstanding
all
that
,
I
feel
we
should
be
allow
to
question
policy
,
as
we
be
do
today
.
when
issue
arise
,
we
should
be
allow
to
address
they
freely
without
any
label
be
apply
.
we
all
encounter
specific
scenario
in
we
constituency
.
one
such
scenario
that
arise
very
recently
for
I
be
where
there
be
a
propose
accommodation
site
in
County
Cork
,
which
be
be
make
ready
at
present
and
be
co-locate
with
a
educational
establishment
.
I
will
not
be
specific
about
where
or
what
the
educational
establishment
be
.
concern
have
be
express
to
I
by
parent
about
have
a
co-located
facility
with
share
access
to
public
space
for
adult
and
child
.
what
issue
might
there
be
from
the
point
of
view
of
child
protection
?
could
I
guide
the
educational
establishment
to
a
identifiable
person
in
Tusla
or
another
body
who
could
liaise
with
it
?
if
people
have
information
,
a
lot
of
the
heat
will
be
take
out
of
issue
.
I
can
make
the
minister
aware
of
the
specific
site
after
this
meeting
.
if
some
work
be
do
now
,
that
would
alleviate
some
of
the
pressure
I
see
build
up
within
the
community
.
the
second
issue
I
raise
relate
to
where
building
be
be
renovate
or
repurpose
.
I
have
encounter
a
couple
of
example
of
this
.
in
one
case
,
the
building
that
be
be
make
ready
for
accommodation
purpose
would
have
have
to
go
through
the
local
authority
and
apply
for
planning
.
we
all
recognise
that
that
hurdle
have
to
be
jump
at
the
moment
.
nevertheless
,
this
be
one
tool
we
as
public
representative
can
use
on
behalf
of
adjacent
neighbour
where
concern
have
be
express
and
where
building
be
renovate
feature
clear
breach
of
planning
law
.
I
be
no
engineer
or
architect
but
clear
breach
of
planning
law
may
be
take
place
to
make
way
for
accommodation
.
there
be
no
apparent
recourse
for
the
near
neighbour
who
,
because
of
this
retrofit
or
refurbishment
,
might
be
very
negatively
impact
by
it
in
term
of
rights
of
way
,
access
and
so
on
.
can
any
mechanism
be
find
through
liais
with
the
local
authority
to
ensure
that
where
building
be
be
retrofit
,
there
will
be
a
set
of
standard
that
be
apparent
and
transparent
to
everybody
?
therefore
,
if
a
person
be
make
way
for
accommodation
that
be
need
,
he
or
she
would
know
to
adhere
to
that
guideline
and
be
cognisant
of
who
he
or
she
neighbour
be
.
on
modular
accommodation
unit
,
technically
,
this
come
under
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
but
it
would
be
useful
to
hear
from
the
minister
,
deputy
O’Gorman
,
regard
the
propose
500
modular
accommodation
unit
that
be
propose
to
house
2000
people
.
do
we
have
any
further
information
as
to
the
status
of
that
?
he
may
have
speak
to
this
early
and
I
apologise
if
he
do
.
when
we
think
of
modular
unit
historically
,
we
think
of
they
as
damp
,
dank
prefab
,
but
the
technology
relate
to
modular
unit
have
advance
a
great
deal
.
there
can
now
be
60
-
or
70
-
year
timeline
on
they
.
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
the
minister
say
tent
will
not
be
use
,
for
example
,
but
we
could
do
a
lot
if
there
be
a
serious
advance
in
respect
of
put
in
place
modular
unit
that
pass
all
the
standard
that
be
require
.
that
would
be
a
good
and
quick
way
to
provide
accommodation
.
the
minister
might
give
he
perspective
on
that
.
it
be
high
than
the
rating
for
my
house
.
not
for
the
first
time
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
it
be
propose
that
we
publish
the
open
statement
on
the
website
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
thank

agree

I
have
find
this
interaction
with
we
witness
very
informative
.
I
have
not
be
conscious
of
the
parent
in
all
of
this
.
I
have
look
matter
through
the
prism
of
people
who
come
to
we
constituency
office
,
and
very
often
it
be
about
a
social
protection
query
or
a
medical
card
query
,
but
once
one
start
to
open
the
box
one
see
that
there
be
other
issue
,
but
one
never
really
fully
engage
with
the
trauma
or
other
difficulty
that
a
parent
would
have
in
this
circumstance
.
this
meeting
have
be
very
useful
for
I
in
be
more
conscious
about
that
from
now
on
.
I
will
not
single
anybody
out
in
particular
,
and
not
to
exclude
anybody
else
,
but
the
Clarecare
model
seem
to
be
most
sympathetic
and
empathetic
model
.
be
this
the
model
that
can
be
replicate
and
transpose
throughout
the
State
?
I
be
not
a
expert
,
but
if
that
be
the
model
that
could
be
use
it
seem
to
I
to
really
to
get
down
into
the
weed
of
a
issue
.
it
really
form
the
basis
of
very
strong
relationship
and
understanding
of
people
's
issue
.
it
probably
pull
a
lot
of
information
out
of
people
that
heretofore
they
may
not
have
feel
the
capacity
to
give
.
if
that
be
to
be
the
model
,
I
believe
it
would
be
a
very
good
model
.
I
would
love
to
have
the
witness
's
perspective
on
that
.
this
be
not
to
denigrate
or
to
undermine
anybody
else
's
potential
model
.
I
would
just
like
to
get
we
guest
's
perspective
on
whether
that
could
be
the
model
.
I
believe
it
be
a
great
model
.
that
be
my
first
question
.
it
do
.
we
must
understand
and
appreciate
the
service
have
only
be
operational
for
a
matter
of
week
really
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
.
I
absolutely
acknowledge
that
.
my
second
and
final
point
be
in
relation
to
the
court
.
we
have
be
talk
about
reform
of
the
court
for
donkey
's
year
and
for
decade
.
I
believe
that
we
think
too
rigidly
in
this
country
about
how
the
Court
Service
operate
:
one
must
present
in
a
adversarial
fashion
in
a
building
that
be
very
clearly
identify
.
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
in
Youghal
I
have
see
two
instance
where
domestic
violence
issue
and
family
related
issue
have
be
consolidate
into
Cork
city
.
for
a
lot
of
people
that
might
not
seem
so
far
away
but
for
a
lot
of
family
it
be
a
gargantuan
task
to
have
to
think
about
how
they
will
engage
with
that
service
.
similarly
,
in
my
home
town
of
Mallow
the
District
Court
will
close
for
six
month
for
refurbishment
,
which
be
necessary
,
but
some
of
the
service
I
have
just
mention
will
now
be
consolidate
in
Cork
city
for
the
duration
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
a
appreciation
by
the
Court
service
of
the
effect
this
will
have
on
family
.
I
do
not
see
why
one
cannot
build
or
refurbish
building
within
town
throughout
the
country
that
could
hold
this
hearing
.
the
setting
be
vitally
important
and
the
representative
here
have
make
very
strong
reference
to
that
.
I
believe
need
to
be
a
modal
shift
in
how
we
think
about
court
,
the
architecture
around
court
,
and
the
nature
of
the
building
themselves
.
I
welcome
the
representative
's
intervention
and
they
observation
in
that
regard
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
current
minister
,
who
have
set
out
she
stall
with
regard
to
domestic
violence
in
particular
,
would
be
mindful
of
the
need
for
family
court
to
be
design
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
they
be
conducive
for
family
who
engage
with
they
.
I
thank
we
witness
for
they
submission
here
today
.
particularly
on
the
Court
Service
.
to
be
fair
,
while
one
cannot
say
there
have
be
a
sea
change
,
there
have
certainly
be
a
shift
in
term
of
the
appointment
of
judge
whose
legal
experience
be
ground
in
family
law
and
that
be
make
a
difference
.
I
thank
all
of
we
witness
for
be
here
.
it
be
a
really
good
discussion
and
engagement
,
which
be
great
.
I
need
to
get
agreement
to
publish
the
open
statement
on

Oireachtas

first
of
all
,
I
be
from
Cork
and
I
heartily
welcome
all
we
guest
here
today
.
this
testimony
be
the
most
impactful
for
we
.
when
people
tell
they
personal
story
,
it
allow
we
to
internalise
it
and
see
how
we
can
drive
on
with
solution
,
which
be
what
the
witness
be
ultimately
look
for
from
politician
.
I
listen
carefully
to
Ms
Moran
when
she
speak
about
the
recruitment
cost
.
the
figure
of
€
15
million
be
provide
on
foot
of
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
.
imagine
what
one
could
do
with
that
money
for
a
lot
of
family
.
I
know
that
sound
like
a
simplistic
thing
to
say
on
my
behalf
,
but
the
HSE
be
pay
recruitment
company
to
hire
people
and
they
be
clearly
not
hire
they
.
they
be
not
do
what
they
be
suppose
to
be
do
and
€
15
million
of
taxpayer
's
money
be
be
use
when
we
could
be
provide
the
service
for
people
.
it
seem
from
we
guest
's
experience
that
bespoke
solution
can
be
tailor
locally
,
depend
on
where
a
person
be
live
or
what
part
of
the
country
he
or
she
be
from
,
to
provide
the
service
.
I
be
always
tab
parliamentary
question
because
that
be
the
tool
of
we
trade
in
this
House
.
I
refer
to
CHO
4
-
forgive
I
for
not
include
other
part
of
the
country
-
because
Cork
and
Kerry
be
represent
at
this
meeting
.
look
at
the
top
-
line
figure
for
waiting
list
for
CHO
4
,
which
be
the
Cork
-
Kerry
region
,
the
number
of
child
wait
for
a
initial
speech
and
language
assessment
be
over
1200
and
for
initial
therapy
the
figure
be
1700
child
.
person
with
down
's
syndrome
obviously
come
into
that
category
as
well
.
similarly
,
there
be
more
than
2000
child
wait
for
further
therapy
in
the
Cork
-
Kerry
region
and
we
be
spend
€
15
million
on
recruitment
company
.
it
be
easy
for
we
to
blame
the
HSE
but
,
at
some
stage
,
there
need
to
be
a
shift
in
government
policy
to
take
ownership
of
the
recruitment
piece
.
what
be
scream
out
to
I
,
base
on
case
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
it
be
confirm
here
by
the
witness
,
be
the
number
of
people
wait
for
speech
and
language
therapy
.
it
be
absolutely
frightening
.
it
upset
I
if
a
child
cannot
communicate
to
a
parent
.
I
be
a
dad
of
three
kid
.
one
thing
we
all
as
parent
work
on
assiduously
be
get
the
child
to
communicate
with
we
because
we
want
to
know
how
the
child
be
feel
.
if
that
service
be
deny
to
a
parent
,
that
be
something
we
need
to
work
on
.
similarly
,
ophthalmology
be
another
area
come
up
on
my
radar
in
a
big
way
.
the
number
of
child
in
Cork
and
Kerry
wait
for
ophthalmology
service
be
3200
.
whatever
about
everything
else
and
the
other
ancillary
issue
and
therapy
,
the
ability
to
see
and
talk
be
two
key
for
any
parent
.
what
can
I
do
in
the
Cork
region
,
or
in
my
constituency
,
to
try
to
assist
that
process
?
the
variation
in
the
experience
of
the
parent
come
out
of
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
,
CUMH
,
with
they
child
be
phenomenal
and
actually
frightening
.
that
be
not
a
reflection
on
individual
.
it
be
that
there
be
no
system
-
wide
approach
.
I
would
have
think
there
would
be
universality
in
term
of
protocol
be
put
in
place
for
every
baby
bear
and
,
obviously
,
that
be
not
the
case
.
very
often
,
it
depend
on
the
midwife
who
pick
up
on
thing
.
we
all
know
of
very
experienced
midwive
who
know
mother
and
the
pattern
of
birth
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
who
be
very
perceptive
.
I
have
hear
of
situation
where
the
midwife
be
the
key
person
in
assist
the
parent
in
where
they
need
to
go
.
my
question
be
simple
.
be
there
something
I
should
be
do
now
,
as
a
deputy
in
the
Cork
area
,
such
as
contact
CUMH
as
a
starting
point
for
future
and
exist
parent
?
do
I
need
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
speak
to
the
chief
officer
of
the
Cork
-
Kerry
area
for
instance
,
or
wherever
?
do
I
need
to
say
that
he
or
she
need
to
sit
down
with
down
Syndrome
Ireland
and
talk
about
what
be
happen
in
Cork
,
that
we
need
to
start
look
at
this
from
birth
through
to
education
and
the
transition
that
Senator
Seery
Kearney
mention
?
be
there
something
more
that
I
as
a
public
representative
can
do
to
push
the
door
open
for
parent
and
act
as
a
intermediary
,
a
interlocutor
,
or
a
advocate
in
the
Cork
-
Kerry
region
,
and
to
say
that
little
change
here
and
additional
service
there
would
make
a
world
of
difference
?
that
be
what
I
would
like
to
hear
from
we
guest
.
I
would
demand
it
and
be
very
happy
to
do
that
.
we
guest
have
hear
all
the
politician
and
the
platitude
.
they
have
hear
it
all
before
a
million
time
.
follow
this
meeting
-
in
deference
to
we
colleague
from
Carlow
and
Kilkenny
-
I
would
have
no
qualm
from
a
Cork
-
Kerry
point
of
view
about
pick
up
the
phone
to
the
chief
officer
in
the
HSE
to
say
that
we
need
to
get
a
meeting
and
start
talk
about
access
to
service
.
I
would
be
very
happy
to
do
so
.
I
be
sorry
if
I
be
rant
on
a
little
bit
but
the
testimony
of
we
guest
be
very
compelling
.
who
in
CUMH
be
DSC
talk
to
?
be
it
with
the
clinical
director
of
CUMH
,
Professor
John
Higgins
?
if
Professor
Higgins
,
who
be
in
charge
of
CUMH
,
be
involved
in
that
meeting
,
please
let
I
know
.
I
will
contact
he
and
see
if
we
can
get
something
go
.
I
be
sorry
for
interrupt
.
be
down
Syndrome
Ireland
talk
to
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
,
NCSE
?
if
the
witness
tell
I
that
down
Syndrome
Ireland
be
,
at
a
national
policy
level
,
talk
to
the
NCSE
about
the
transition
we
be
discuss
then
I
will
be
satisfied
.
if
the
answer
be
"
no
"
then
people
like
I
could
contact
the
NCSE
.
what
I
be
find
in
school
be
a
piecemeal
,
almost
pernicious
approach
by
the
NCSE
.
school
will
get
a
allocation
of
half
a
person
here
and
a
quarter
of
a
person
there
.
this
be
how
surreal
it
have
become
in
this
country
.
if
down
Syndrome
Ireland
could
talk
to
the
NCSE
and
if
people
like
we
could
push
that
along
we
might
be
able
to
open
a
door
there
as
well
.
we
be
go
backwards
.
be
parent
get
lose
in
the
Children
Disability
Network
team
?
we
now
have
the
creation
of
the
CDNTs
and
the
primary
care
team
and
all
of
this
new
policy
.
it
seem
to
I
that
under
the
old
system
use
a
provider
like
down
Syndrome
Ireland
seem
to
reach
the
child
or
person
a
lot
quick
than
be
happen
now
.
even
if
one
factor
Covid
and
lockdown
out
of
the
equation
there
seem
to
be
a
great
reach
or
at
least
there
be
more
connection
between
parent
and
the
service
under
the
old
system
.
that
be
the
impression
I
have
.
I
now

I
,
too
,
welcome
Professor
Stott
to
the
committee
.
this
have
be
a
useful
tutorial
for
we
in
a
academic
sense
and
a
fruitful
exercise
.
one
of
the
professor
's
slide
mention
the
global
average
surface
temperature
change
from
1850
to
2000
.
be
we
talk
about
a
increase
in
temperature
of
up
to
5°
Celsius
?
what
will
be
the
permutation
for
life
on
the
planet
if
the
average
temperature
increase
by
that
amount
by
2100
?
will
we
be
in
a
existential
crisis
at
that
stage
if
we
keep
go
the
way
we
be
go
?
what
kind
of
radical
measure
do
government
need
to
take
now
in
respect
of
policy
that
will
halt
the
effect
of
human
-
induce
climate
change
?
the
key
message
that
I
have
take
from
Professor
Stott
's
intervention
be
that
human
-
induce
climate
change
be
a
major
contributory
factor
to
the
increase
in
temperature
.
if
I
understand
the
professor
correctly
,
he
be
state
that
if
we
continue
to
go
in
the
way
we
be
go
in
term
of
the
production
of
carbon
,
we
will
oversh
what
be
envisage
in
the
Paris
agreement
as
a
result
of
human
-
induce
climate
change
and
that
the
lack
of
policy
intervention
by
government
across
the
globe
mean
that
the
change
be
implement
be
not
radical
enough
to
halt
the
effect
of
temperature
increase
as
measure
on
the
Celsius
scale
.
will
the
professor
expand
on
that
a
little
?
I
ask
about
radical
policy
.
I
thank
Professor
Stott
for
travel
to
Ireland
to
appear
before
the
committee
.
we
appreciate
the
very
productive
engagement
with
the
member
.
as
there
be
no
other
business
the

the
member
have
read
the
open
statement
.
we
be
very
much
brief
on
the
open
statement
.
in
order
to
allow
for
a
concise
opening
statement
and
a
proper
question
and
answer
afterwards
,
that
be
why
the
member
come
to
that
conclusion
.
we
have
receive
it
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
the
committee
today
.
accord
to
the
Intergovernmental
panel
on
Climate
Change
,
IPCC
,
report
on
global
warming
of
1.5°
c
as
a
result
of
co2
emission
from
industry
,
pathway
limit
global
warming
to
1.5°
C
be
project
to
be
approximately
75
%
to
90
%
low
in
2050
relative
to
2010
.
that
be
compare
with
the
50
%
to
80
%
figure
for
global
warming
if
we
be
project
up
to
2°
C.
will
Dr.
Quinn
indicate
the
emission
trajectory
for
Irish
industry
from
now
to
2030
and
from
now
to
2050
?
will
I
continue
with
my
question
?
that
be
the
first
question
.
if
there
be
a
difference
in
that
respect
,
how
different
be
the
current
trajectory
in
term
of
the
requirement
for
industry
to
cut
emission
by
more
than
75
%
?
I
can
not
see
any
specific
figure
in
Dr.
Quinn
's
submission
on
cut
emission
.
I
would
like
to
see
information
from
the
Department
in
respect
of
that
figure
.
the
second
theme
also
emanate
from
the
recent
IPPC
report
.
how
will
the
Department
assess
the
specific
action
it
must
take
to
lead
Irish
industry
in
deliver
what
we
call
the
deep
cut
in
overall
emission
in
the
next
12
year
?
we
have
go
from
a
2030
to
2050
outlook
to
a
12
-
year
outlook
,
which
I
believe
will
be
the
modus
operandi
of
this
committee
.
I
refer
to
the
recent
IPCC
report
deal
with
the
12
year
from
now
.
how
will
individual
Department
move
towards
radical
policy
across
they
agency
to
target
that
deep
cut
that
be
so
necessary
?
what
specific
action
will
the
Department
of
Business
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
take
?
on
the
research
,
development
and
innovation
,
RDI
piece
,
priority
area
be
note
in
the
submission
.
I
have
some
degree
of
familiarity
with
that
priority
area
.
how
much
money
be
be
allocate
across
that
thematic
area
,
specifically
relate
to
energy
,
climate
action
and
sustainability
,
include
the
decarbonisation
of
the
energy
system
and
sustainable
living
?
what
be
the
name
of
the
research
centre
?
how
much
money
be
each
research
centre
receive
?
what
be
the
total
amount
of
money
be
receive
for
each
of
that
centre
?
be
the
issue
of
climate
change
or
radical
climate
action
in
respect
of
the
12
year
map
across
the
area
of
food
,
for
instance
,
in
term
of
smart
and
sustainable
food
production
and
processing
and
on
manufacturing
and
novel
material
,
include
advance
in
smart
manufacturing
?
I
have
only
one
minute
leave
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
they
answer
,
but
we
only
have
ten
minute
each
and
I
be
try
to
be
as
efficient
as
possible
.
could
a
breakdown
of
the
figure
be
send
to
the
committee
?
on
emission
trading
,
there
be
a
question
outstanding
about
how
the
model
work
and
the
offset
industry
can
use
.
it
would
be
useful
for
we
to
have
a
good
understanding
of
how
it
work
and
the
100
company
involve
.
perhaps
we
might
receive
a
synopsis
of
that
information
or
a
aide
-
memoire
as
it
would
help
the
work
of
the
committee
.
the
future

forgive
I
for
be
late
.
Wednesday
be
a
day
when
one
have
to
attend
other
committee
as
well
.
I
welcome
the
submission
,
which
I
have
read
.
I
merely
want
to
ask
some
key
question
.
on
the
theme
of
building
capacity
in
relation
to
the
LCDCs
and
the
PPNs
,
community
be
come
together
and
generate
idea
about
what
they
want
to
do
and
there
be
a
articulation
of
that
idea
or
project
through
the
local
authority
.
I
want
to
glean
a
good
understanding
from
the
Department
of
how
it
be
facilitate
or
help
to
build
capacity
so
that
we
can
see
a
great
throughput
of
this
localised
project
with
a
climate
change
theme
.
one
specific
project
with
which
I
be
familiar
be
the
IRD
Duhallow
project
on
warm
home
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
Mr.
McCarthy
be
familiar
with
that
project
.
it
be
a
extremely
good
project
whereby
that
who
be
dependent
on
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
payment
can
be
facilitate
with
a
grant
and
the
project
will
come
out
and
retrofit
house
for
attic
insulation
.
that
be
one
bespoke
and
valuable
project
for
the
community
I
represent
.
I
wonder
how
the
Department
can
translate
that
across
a
wide
geographical
spectrum
and
how
one
build
capacity
on
that
kind
of
project
and
other
type
of
project
.
the
LCDCs
and
the
PPNs
have
considerable
potential
to
build
capacity
and
deliver
project
for
everybody
,
and
have
a
real
impact
.
I
want
to
get
a
understanding
from
the
Department
of
that
dynamic
.
that
be
my
first
question
.
on
the
community
-
own
energy
project
,
I
want
to
get
a
understanding
of
whether
the
Department
have
clear
target
for
community
-
own
energy
project
and
how
it
plan
to
facilitate
more
of
that
type
of
project
.
such
project
have
the
potential
to
be
real
game
-
changer
locally
.
if
,
arise
from
we
deliberation
here
in
committee
we
compile
a
report
,
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
could
speak
to
that
potential
.
that
be
the
second
question
.
in
regard
to
planning
policy
,
to
follow
up
on
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
's
point
,
I
want
to
get
a
understanding
of
whether
there
be
a
need
to
ensure
that
house
in
rural
area
be
build
near
settlement
so
as
to
reduce
the
dependency
on
car
.
Mr.
McCarthy
may
say
that
be
a
department
of
housing
,
Planning
and
local
government
competence
but
I
wish
merely
to
have
the
Department
of
rural
and
Community
Development
's
perspective
on
that
as
well
.
be
climate
action
and
mitigation
map
across
that
?
there
be
no
time
for
reflection
.
I
love
when
the
Dubs
tell
we
what
be
worth
it
and
what
be
not
.
it
do
now
.
I
beg
the
indulgence
of
the
acting
chairman
.
I
must
go
to
the
Chamber
for
a
topical
Issue
.
I
understand
I
be
to
speak
next
.
may
I
speak
when
I
return
?
no
,
that
be
not
what
I
be
ask
.
I
be
just
anxious
-----
I
be
just
anxious
that
the
committee
would
facilitate
I
when
I
come
back
.
I
appreciate
that
.
I
be
ask
whether
the
meeting
will
still
be
in
progress
.
Senator
Mulherin
should
take
she
time
.
I
be
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
the
commissioner
in
the
OPW
.
in
term
of
management
of
the
State
property
portfolio
and
the
build
environment
the
citizen
's
Assembly
report
make
a
specific
recommendation
,
for
which
100
%
of
the
member
vote
,
that
the
State
should
take
a
leadership
role
in
address
climate
change
through
mitigation
measure
include
,
for
example
,
retrofit
public
building
.
the
witness
would
have
read
that
before
come
in
here
today
.
why
be
it
that
,
accord
to
the
OPW
,
79
%
of
building
be
rate
either
C
or
D
,
which
comprise
42
%
and
37
%
,
respectively
?
I
appreciate
the
point
that
most
poorly
perform
building
have
exceptional
electric
load
,
datum
centre
and
so
on
but
can
we
be
more
ambitious
about
that
target
?
be
there
language
that
can
be
use
to
say
we
be
look
at
the
12
-
year
window
and
can
the
opw
become
more
radical
in
get
that
C
and
D
-
rate
building
up
to
rating
of
b
and
a
?
accord
to
the
IPCC
report
,
the
trajectory
now
be
completely
different
and
that
must
give
rise
to
more
radical
policy
by
government
and
,
by
extension
,
the
Department
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
urgency
from
the
witness
or
a
sense
that
this
new
limit
warning
be
scary
.
I
would
love
for
we
to
be
able
to
write
a
report
that
say
we
be
satisfied
that
the
OPW
,
which
manage
the
State
property
portfolio
,
be
move
more
radically
towards
ber
rating
of
a
and
b
.
on
CFRAM
,
I
be
from
the
great
county
of
Cork
.
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
's
people
be
baptise
in
the
River
Lee
.
I
be
baptise
in
the
Blackwater
,
metaphorically
speak
.
we
do
speak
about
flood
defence
and
there
be
very
clear
evidence
of
structural
work
on
the
Munster
Blackwater
at
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
which
be
phenomenally
successful
.
for
anybody
who
have
any
doubt
about
whether
demountable
wall
work
there
be
incontrovertible
proof
that
they
do
.
notwithstanding
that
,
the
problem
for
migratory
fish
and
so
on
,
to
which
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
have
refer
,
be
a
slightly
different
issue
,
not
quite
pertinent
to
this
one
because
it
relate
to
a
fish
pass
in
disrepair
and
be
not
necessarily
in
the
witness
's
remit
.
it
be
important
to
put
that
on
the
record
.
there
be
118
flood
relief
scheme
and
flood
relief
programme
be
always
design
with
the
100
year
flood
in
mind
.
I
be
formerly
a
mayor
of
my
town
and
when
we
go
through
the
process
we
be
tell
we
be
design
for
the
100
year
flood
.
I
fail
to
understand
Mr.
Adamson
's
intervention
on
the
planning
,
maybe
I
miss
something
in
the
dialogue
.
have
we
now
surpass
the
100
year
flood
mark
or
benchmark
in
plan
for
flooding
event
?
should
we
now
be
use
agricultural
land
to
slow
down
flooding
and
should
we
be
pay
farmer
who
be
on
flood
plain
some
sort
of
compensation
and
tell
they
not
to
build
on
they
land
,
not
to
plant
or
graze
and
allow
for
natural
drainage
scheme
to
take
place
?
that
would
be
a
structural
solution
to
flooding
and
a
more
natural
solution
that
be
not
just
engineering
but
another
solution
in
term
of
land
use
.
I
have
one
last
question
.
do
I
hear
the
witness
correctly
when
he
say
that
the
cost
of
a
Thames
-
type
barrier
structure
for
Cork
would
be
€
1
billion
?
if
that
be
the
figure
I
hear
,
have
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
arrive
at
it
by
do
some
scenario
planning
or
engineering
a
solution
?
the
witness
do
not
pluck
the
figure
of
€
1
billion
out
of
the
air
.
the
OPW
must
have
have
some
internal
discussion
on
that
.
there
be
angst
in
Cork
city
,
which
I
do
not
share
at
this
juncture
.
I
differ
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
on
this
one
but
I
have
a
open
mind
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
opw
be
move
towards
a
demountable
solution
.
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
point
.
where
be
the
OPW
go
to
put
it
?
would
it
be
outside
Spike
Island
or
by
Blackrock
Castle
?
sorry
-----
it
have
a
major
impact
on
the
whole
Lee
valley
and
-----
it
be
quite
pertinent
to
-----
I
apologise
.
where
exactly
be
the
propose
location
?

it
would
be
useful
for
the
committee
to
have
a
map
of
the
various
committee
that
exist
across
the
government
and
between
Department
on
climate
change
because
it
can
be
confusing
when
we
hear
acronym
and
term
that
come
out
of
nowhere
.
I
would
welcome
any
clarity
on
that
.
I
wish
to
clarify
something
Dr.
O'Mara
mention
.
he
say
that
output
be
outpace
efficiency
gain
in
respect
of
the
national
herd
.
he
refer
specifically
to
milk
production
.
in
layman
's
term
,
I
would
like
to
gain
a
understanding
of
how
that
gap
be
be
narrow
or
close
.
a
question
arise
if
the
gap
be
narrow
and
one
have
maximum
efficiency
gain
,
and
one
be
still
plan
on
increase
output
.
if
I
understand
the
intervention
correctly
,
output
will
keep
increase
.
we
will
continue
to
produce
beef
and
more
milk
or
milk
product
or
derivative
thereof
.
if
that
be
where
we
have
put
we
egg
in
term
of
the
market
-
Dr.
O'Mara
keep
refer
to
the
market
-
then
how
do
we
close
the
gap
?
if
we
close
the
gap
between
efficiency
gain
and
increase
in
output
and
if
we
be
try
to
peg
it
out
in
year
,
at
what
stage
of
the
process
will
we
get
there
?
will
it
be
2025
,
2040
,
2050
or
2100
by
the
time
the
gap
be
close
?
the
IPCC
's
report
have
bring
what
we
be
face
into
stark
focus
.
this
morning
I
get
a
sense
of
the
work
the
Department
be
do
,
which
be
laudable
,
but
there
be
no
great
sense
of
urgency
,
particularly
in
forestry
and
make
efficiency
gain
.
I
say
this
because
tackle
climate
change
require
resource
.
in
he
budget
statement
the
minister
for
Finance
speak
about
the
environment
efficiency
pilot
scheme
for
the
beef
section
,
yet
I
do
not
know
what
be
the
overall
figure
for
the
scheme
.
when
one
examine
the
initiative
a
little
,
it
seem
that
it
will
cost
€
40
per
cow
and
that
the
weight
of
cow
will
have
to
be
record
at
mart
.
have
the
rhetoric
at
the
working
group
of
the
European
Union
change
owe
to
the
40
%
figure
in
the
CAP
negotiation
?
can
the
rhetoric
be
track
to
dialogue
within
the
Department
that
state
,
"
if
we
keep
go
the
way
we
be
,
we
be
go
to
far
surpass
the
target
set
of
32.3
%
for
Ireland
's
overall
emission
in
agriculture
"
?
I
firmly
believe
we
cannot
maintain
such
a
trajectory
.
I
be
try
to
be
evidence
-
base
in
deal
with
this
matter
.
base
on
the
intervention
make
today
,
it
seem
that
there
be
no
way
in
hell
that
we
will
be
able
reach
the
figure
of
32.3
%
at
the
current
rate
of
intervention
.
it
be
just
a
impossibility
.
I
would
prefer
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
to
tell
we
how
much
we
need
in
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
,
outline
what
policy
intervention
be
need
and
how
much
money
be
require
for
same
.
my
last
question
be
about
forestry
.
if
I
run
out
of
time
,
the
Secretary
General
can
supply
the
committee
with
he
answer
in
writing
.
be
18
%
of
the
land
area
of
the
country
under
forestry
?
we
be
talk
about
scheme
under
which
farmer
will
be
pay
x
amount
for
15
year
.
surely
we
need
to
be
tell
they
,
"
do
not
farm
that
land
any
more
because
this
be
what
we
be
go
to
pay
you
in
perpetuity
and
you
antecedent
,
"
because
otherwise
,
frankly
,
we
be
on
a
hiding
to
nothing
.
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
understand
where
we
be
in
the
negotiation
on
the
CAP
because
it
be
a
opportunity
.
I
argue
that
everybody
seat
around
this
table
want
a
just
transition
for
farmer
.
one
do
not
want
to
put
farmer
out
of
business
overnight
.
we
need
to
have
a
sense
of
how
Ireland
be
influence
the
negotiation
on
the
CAP
in
order
that
we
can
ensure
the
transfer
will
be
such
that
we
will
able
to
maximise
research
output
and
provide
for
the
remuneration
of
farmer
and
that
involve
in
agriculture
in
order
that
the
target
to
be
reach
can
be
reduce
to
manageable
level
while
maintain
output
.
it
be
land
management
Mr.
Gleeson
have
do
very
well
today
consider
that
it
be
he
first
outing
as
Secretary
General
.
on

the

I
thank
Mr.
Gleeson

it

I
be
glad
to
hear
Mr.
Donnellan
use
the
language
of
the
just
transition
and
that
there
have
be
11
town
hall
meeting
on
a
voluntary
redundancy
programme
.
what
will
be
the
cost
of
the
programme
?
I
be
sure
the
chairman
will
add
the
time
.
when
will
the
company
conclude
the
negotiation
?
if
it
do
not
have
a
answer
to
that
today
,
it
could
perhaps
provide
a
note
on
the
process
.
if
we
be
reflect
the
view
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
,
it
have
a
clear
majority
in
favour
of
look
after
worker
in
this
process
.
it
be
clear
from
the
language
that
it
be
the
company
's
intention
to
do
so
,
but
it
would
be
useful
to
add
detail
.
even
a
note
provide
more
detail
would
be
welcome
.
this
be
a
front
-
line
sector
in
which
we
face
job
loss
to
mitigate
the
effect
of
climate
change
.
as
such
,
we
be
conscious
of
the
need
to
ensure
worker
be
protect
.
I
would
like
a
note
on
how
the
process
be
be
manage
,
what
the
end
game
be
,
when
it
be
hope
to
conclude
it
and
what
the
project
outcome
be
.
how
many
hectare
will
be
deem
to
be
usable
as
carbon
sink
at
the
end
of
the
process
?
I
listen
with
interest
to
Mr.
Shier
early
on
some
of
the
challenge
in
that
regard
and
it
would
be
useful
for
the
committee
to
have
a
more
detailed
note
on
the
potential
for
carbon
sink
.
it
would
help
we
in
the
preparation
of
a
final
report
reflect
the
view
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
.
I
know
,
but
I
have
ask
a
very
specific
question
on
Bord
to
Móna
and
it
would
be
useful
.
I
do
not
expect
a
answer
today
but
I
also
ask
for
a
note
set
out
what
the
electricity
exchange
Dedicated
activity
company
,
dac
,
investment
be
about
.
while
it
seem
self
-
explanatory
on
the
face
of
it
,
a
more
detailed
note
would
be
useful
for
the
committee
.
I
thank
the
witness
and
member
for
they
engagement
today
.
it
be
a
long
session

on
Wednesday
we
flit
in
and
out
of
committee
meeting
so
I
apologise
if
I
repeat
anything
that
be
say
or
ask
previously
.
this
be
all
about
behavioural
change
and
one
of
the
citizen
'
Assembly
's
recommendation
seek
the
establishment
of
a
independent
oversight
body
.
Mr.
Watt
have
use
language
here
today
of
consider
what
structure
might
be
necessary
.
be
there
a
articulation
of
that
vision
across
government
about
what
type
of
structure
could
be
create
or
would
it
continue
to
be
house
in
a
particular
department
look
across
other
departmental
silo
?
do
we
need
a
overarching
structure
that
would
benchmark
the
action
of
individual
Department
because
I
take
some
solace
from
the
two
intervention
that
we
have
have
here
today
and
the
fact
that
there
be
a
clear
outline
of
a
vision
in
respect
of
what
need
to
be
do
and
the
urgency
of
the
problem
?
frankly
,
it
be
the
first
articulation
that
I
have
hear
from
Department
on
the
urgency
of
this
.
I
be
try
to
deconstruct
some
of
the
language
that
be
use
.
I
do
not
mean
this
in
a
pejorative
sense
but
some
of
the
language
can
be
code
such
as
:
"
more
stringent
central
mandate
"
and
"
least
cost
abatement
option
"
.
this
language
need
to
be
simplify
if
we
be
to
produce
a
report
that
be
fit
for
purpose
and
reflect
the
citizen
's
Assembly
's
report
.
the
citizen
's
Assembly
make
a
recommendation
on
the
establishment
of
a
central
,
independent
body
.
be
we
move
towards
a
similar
structure
across
government
that
would
kick
the
tyre
on
what
individual
Department
be
do
?
forgive
I
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
not
be
clear
.
I
be
try
to
tease
out
what
Mr.
Watt
be
say
about
the
structure
that
be
necessary
.
be
they
interdepartmental
or
be
there
to
be
a
outside
independent
body
?
I
appreciate
that
.
I
be
love
this
frankness
from
the
Secretary
General
.
would
that
all
Secretary
General
be
so
frank
.
how
many
minute
do
I
have
leave
?
what
be
Mr.
Watt
's
thought
on
the
mechanism
for
introduce
carbon
budget
?
we
have
speak
about
reach
target
and
we
be
already
surpass
the
5
%
reduction
in
emission
there
need
to
be
each
year
between
now
and
2050
.
we
be
just
look
for
help
in
produce
the
good
report
we
can
produce
in
order
that
the
government
might
map
onto
it
.
that
conclude
we
session
.
I
know
it
be
a
long
session
,
but
the
Department
of
finance
,

Public

be
two

Department
.

I

for
miss
the
first
part
of
the
witness
's
engagement
with
the
committee
.
we
have
other
committee
to
attend
also
,
but
I
apologise
.
I
thank
the
representative
for
be
here
today
because
it
be
so
important
that
we
have
the
weight
of
academic
opinion
in
respect
of
what
need
to
be
do
.
it
will
greatly
assist
we
in
try
to
form
a
report
that
respond
to
this
crisis
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
witness
's
attendance
today
.
what
be
the
representative
's
view
on
carbon
budget
whereby
government
or
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
the
Department
of
Finance
,
and
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
be
allocate
a
carbon
budget
and
there
be
also
a
universal
view
on
what
each
Department
be
emit
through
its
agency
or
activity
?
so
there
be
a
precedent
whereby
-----
that
be
very
useful
.
if
there
be
some
paper
that
would
help
this
committee
,
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
to
see
if
there
be
a
translational
effect
into
a
Irish
context
.
do
Dr.
Aubert
believe
that
it
be
a
good
model
that
should
be
use
?
I
ask
the
other
witness
to
respond
also
.
this
be
very
interesting
because
again
there
be
a
clear
example
of
a
city
,
perhaps
we
could
call
it
a
city
state
,
with
autonomy
in
respect
of
its
own
governance
.
it
be
clearly
work
on
this
topic
.
Professor
Masson
-
Delmotte
state
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
clear
disaggregation
between
co2
and
other
emission
.
for
people
who
may
be
watch
this
proceedings
,
what
be
the
reason
for
that
?
I
see
.
do
that
mean
that
policy
intervention
can
be
design
once
a
weighting
have
be
give
?
would
it
be
possible
to
say
that
this
be
what
we
need
to
do
in
transport
,
this
be
what
we
need
to
do
in
agriculture
or
building
and
whatever
it
may
be
?
yes
,
that
be
fine
.
be
that
not
the
point
?
we
have
line
Department
report
to
this
committee
.
I
do
not
get
a
sense
of
that
type
of
urgency
,
give
the
timescale
involve
,
in
Ireland
move
towards
carbon
budgeting
.
perhaps
that
be
something
this
committee
could
include
in
its
recommendation
.
I
be
also
interested
to
hear
the
view
of
Professor
Seneviratne
on
carbon
budgeting
.
on
that
,
if
we
establish
the
principle
in
the
first
instance
,
then
we
can
roll
it
out
.
it
be
important
that
there
be
example
in
Zurich
and
France
that
we
can
look
towards
.
my
next
question
be
on
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
.
that
be
the
big
beast
.
in
respect
of
the
witness
's
interaction
with
other
government
,
academic
and
entity
such
as
the
European
Commission
,
be
there
a
sense
that
the
next
CAP
will
deal
with
agricultural
production
in
a
way
that
will
allow
farmer
to
reshape
food
chain
,
to
use
witness
's
term
?
will
it
also
be
deal
with
in
a
way
that
will
allow
we
,
in
any
Irish
context
,
lessen
we
dependency
on
intensive
farming
and
move
towards
policy
such
as
afforestation
or
horticulture
?
do
the
witness
have
a
sense
from
the
early
working
on
CAP
that
the
European
Commission
be
move
in
a
particular
direction
with
climate
change
and
agriculture
?
I
thank
Dr.
Aubert
.
be
Dr.
Aubert
hopeful
about
the
scheme
be
devise
by
the
European
Commission
?
I
understand
what
he
be
say
about
the
member
states
's
application
or
implementation
of
that
scheme
.
I
would
have
think
,
however
,
perhaps
naively
,
that
the
European
Commission
be
realistic
now
about
the
challenge
member
state
be
face
in
respect
of
climate
change
.
the
European
Commission
,
as
a
entity
in
and
of
itself
,
notwithstand
any
critique
I
might
have
of
it
on
other
issue
,
have
no
other
choice
now
but
to
make
sure
there
be
a
proofing
mechanism
to
ensure
there
be
not
,

one
hundred

.
I
thank
the
speaker
for
appear
before
we
today
.
I
want
to
extrapolate
a
little
from
the
Bord
to
Móna
scenario
.
for
we
,
it
be
to
be
the
exemplar
for
the
just
transition
.
it
be
to
be
the
example
to
which
we
could
all
refer
as
the
big
glorious
project
in
which
the
worker
transition
and
be
treat
fairly
.
we
be
get
a
very
strong
sense
today
,
however
,
that
the
worker
be
not
get
package
that
be
commensurate
with
they
year
of
service
.
this
committee
have
to
take
that
very
seriously
.
when
the
Bord
to
Móna
representative
be
before
we
,
they
speak
about
the
11
town
hall
meeting
they
have
.
I
hope
no
gloss
or
spin
be
put
on
that
.
they
speak
about
renewable
energy
project
at
a
number
of
wind
farm
and
anaerobic
digestion
facility
.
they
speak
about
aquaculture
and
afforestation
of
20000
to
30000
acre
to
develop
the
biomass
biochain
.
Mr.
Noone
have
express
some
view
on
that
.
they
speak
about
recycling
and
tourism
.
my
question
be
simple
.
there
be
mention
of
town
hall
engagement
with
worker
but
do
worker
who
be
not
seek
to
subscribe
to
the
voluntary
redundancy
scheme
have
a
legitimate
expectation
within
Bord
to
Móna
currently
to
transition
to
other
area
in
the
company
?
from
the
perspective
of
the
congress
or
SIPTU
,
be
there
a
expectation
among
worker
that
they
will
be
redeploy
into
one
of
this
area
of
activity
and
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
to
retain
a
job
or
employment
?
be
the
goalpost
be
shif
on
a
constant
basis
by
the
management
?
I
outline
the
six
activity
that
be
articulate
to
we
.
from
Mr.
Noone
's
perspective
,
there
be
no
understanding
that
worker
will
transition
to
this
area
of
activity
.
there
be
the
language
of
the
just
transition
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
acknowledge
as
a
committee
that
recommendation
no.
7
speak
of
make
proper
provision
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
worker
impact
.
there
be
a
overwhelming
mandate
.
today
's
interaction
have
be
very
useful
and
we
be
now
begin
to
develop
the
language
of
the
just
transition
and
tease
it
out
.
do
the
witness
agree
with
the
language
of
the
just
transition
,
what
it
mean
and
how
it
would
be
populate
in
term
of
funding
,
specifically
the
type
of
structure
set
up
?
it
be
very
much
a
iterative
process
but
there
must
be
some
formal
process
and
the
government
must
be
a
key
stakeholder
in
that
.
it
will
take
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
social
protection
element
of
the
just
transition
,
the
State
and
the
government
will
have
to
fund
that
activity
.
take
the
Spanish
example
of
transition
,
€
250
million
be
spend
,
which
be
not
a
insignificant
amount
of
money
.
we
be
talk
about
a
serious
funding
pot
that
will
have
to
be
make
available
by
the
government
if
we
be
talk
about
decarbonise
the
economy
.
do
the
witness
agree
with
the
proposition
?
the
midland
have
a
particular
geography
.
Mr.
Healy
have
mention
deep
retrofit
scheme
and
the
housing
stock
in
a
area
that
might
have
potential
.
have
Congress
engage
with
the
company
on
the
retraining
and
upskilling
potential
?
be
it
something
that
must
be
elevate
beyond
current
talk
or
dialogue
with
the
company
on
term
and
condition
,
voluntary
redundancy
and
so
on
?
how
do
we
as
a
committee
take
the
language
of
the
just
transition
and
deal
with
a
very
bespoke
example
like
the
peat
industry
?
rather
than
speak
rhetorically
about
what
we
need
to
do
,
what
action
be
require
?
be
there
any
activity
from
agency
in
the
engagement
,
or
even
from
academic
institution
like
Athlone
Institute
of
Technology
that
could
help
in
figure
out
how
to
transition
worker
?
be
there
any
experience
of
that
?
be
the
skill
audit
live
?
I
would
say
that

Ryan

ask

question

I

I
welcome
the
minister
.
he
have
be
very
open
and
engage
.
I
perceive
from
he
a
sense
of
energy
regard
what
need
to
be
do
here
.
with
that
in
mind
,
be
the
all
-
of
-
government
approach
model
on
a
cabinet
sub
-
committee
whereby
all
the
line
Department
will
report
directly
to
the
Taoiseach
via
the
Minister
's
Department
?
my
view
,
bear
in
mind
that
I
be
involved
in
the
action
plan
for
job
with
the
minister
,
be
that
have
clear
metric
to
be
measure
and
clear
target
be
the
only
way
to
reach
milestone
.
we
now
need
to
start
reach
serious
milestone
.
if
it
be
perceive
that
the
mechanism
in
question
be
one
by
which
people
turn
up
without
identifiable
action
,
right
down
to
the
micro
level
,
it
might
fail
.
may
I
ask
about
carbon
budgeting
as
a
tool
?
the
minister
speak
highly
of
the
intervention
of
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
Mr.
Watt
.
be
be
envisage
that
carbon
budgeting
will
be
use
as
a
tool
by
line
Department
to
ensure
a
decarbonisation
agenda
?
Representative
of
the
IPCC
who
be
before
the
committee
speak
about
the
successful
application
of
carbon
budget
.
they
give
the
example
from
France
.
be
it
be
consider
here
as
a
tool
?
do
we
have
a
timeline
for
that
?
perhaps
the
minister
could
report
back
even
if
he
do
not
have
one
now
.
if
we
be
to
reflect
accurately
the
recommendation
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
in
produce
we
own
report
,
carbon
budgeting
will
be
one
of
the
area
-----
indeed
.
we
would
welcome
any
move
towards
that
.
the
minister
give
very
specific
example
,
include
on
market
failure
and
regulatory
framework
.
I
be
sure
he
be
interested
in
ensure
the
deep
retrofit
of
building
,
include
public
building
,
private
dwelling
and
school
.
we
have
very
positive
engagement
with
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
.
I
believe
strongly
that
if
the
minister
be
to
visit
Nenagh
and
speak
to
staff
in
the
agency
,
he
would
note
three
bespoke
example
.
one
be
a
primary
school
,
one
be
a
municipal
health
centre
and
the
third
be
a
house
.
the
Tipperary
model
be
a
very
good
stakeholder
model
base
on
a
social
enterprise
model
.
if
the
minister
could
engage
on
replicate
it
regionally
or
right
across
the
country
,
it
would
be
possible
to
use
the
carbon
fund
,
and
also
possibly
the
green
fund
,
in
a
way
that
would
allow
a
financing
instrument
to
bring
the
model
to
fruition
.
the
SEAI
be
a
agency
of
the
minister
's
Department
.
I
respectfully
ask
he
to
examine
the
Tipperary
model
and
kick
the
tyre
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
excellent
model
.
the
other
point
relate
to
the
just
transition
.
if
the
minister
can
not
respond
now
,
he
can
come
back
to
I
.
the
language
of
the
just
transition
have
gain
serious
traction
.
it
refer
to
fairness
for
worker
who
be
move
into
a
decarbonised
society
to
ensure
that
there
be
support
and
social
protection
-
type
structure
put
in
place
so
that
the
transition
be
just
.
this
matter
have
be
discuss
with
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
,
ICTU
.
will
the
minister
consider
engage
with
ICTU
to
see
if
funding
similar
to
that
available
in
Spain
and
other
country
could
be
put
in
place
?
in
the
mining
industry
in
Spain
,
for
example
,
a
€
250
million
fund
be
put
in
place
to
assist
worker
who
be
get
out
of
the
sector
.
I
be
merely
put
this
on
the
agenda
for
further
discussion
,
perhaps
offline
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
come

we
this
afternoon
.
we
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to

the

and

look
forward

to
work
with
the
minister
on
that
.
as
there
be
no
other
business
,
we
will
adjourn
.
I
want
to
talk
about
community
-
own
energy
project
and
community
initiative
.
why
be
it
take
so
long
for
community
energy
project
and
community
energy
initiative
to
get
connection
to
the
grid
?
I
be
hear
story
of
project
which
have
be
wait
for
seven
to
ten
year
.
why
have
this
not
be
sort
out
?
if
a
community
energy
project
come
into
being
within
the
next
six
month
,
how
long
will
it
reasonably
take
to
get
it
onto
the
grid
,
in
light
of
what
have
just
be
say
?
Mr.
Melvin
could
provide
a
real
-
time
analysis
of
what
be
happen
but
it
be
arguable
that
what
he
describe
be
theoretical
.
be
the
RESS
live
now
and
what
be
the
expectation
for
a
community
energy
project
in
rural
Cork
,
for
example
,
if
it
start
tomorrow
?
there
be
different
piece
to
the
jigsaw
.
assume
they
do
under
the
RESS
,
the
commission
will
regulate
they
.
okay
.
there
be
much
talk
of
the
front
end
of
what
consumer
will
see
and
the
choice
they
might
have
relate
to
energy
supply
into
they
home
.
that
be
fine
and
wonderful
.
I
have
have
some
briefing
from
the
esb
about
smart
metering
.
I
want
to
get
to
the
back
end
.
if
we
be
go
to
encourage
a
move
towards
renewable
,
we
need
to
hear
from
the
CRU
about
how
it
will
unlock
the
regulatory
burden
for
community
energy
project
to
get
on
the
smart
grid
,
as
it
have
be
call
,
and
incentivise
people
to
start
produce
electricity
.
if
everything
fit
into
place
,
could
the
timeline
be
reduce
from
seven
to
ten
year
,
to
a
short
but
still
reasonable
expectation
?
what
be
that
reasonable
expectation
?
could
I
have
a
range
?
the
logic
of
my
intervention
be
base
on
the
Scottish
model
.
there
be
500
mw
now
be
generate
and
it
be
approximately
5
%
of
renewable
capacity
in
Scotland
.
it
have
hit
that
specific
target
.
if
we
can
translate
a
Scottish
model
into
a
Irish
context
,
we
would
be
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
thank
Lord
Deben
and
Mr.
Stark
for
take
the
time
to
attend
today
.
we
be
grateful
for
they
insight
thus
far
.
my
question
be
simple
.
I
will
have
a
interactive
session
with
the
deputation
,
if
I
may
,
in
the
time
I
have
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
Lord
Deben
about
Brexit
and
to
what
extent
Brexit
be
inform
he
thinking
as
chairperson
in
term
of
the
challenge
face
throughout
the
Unite
Kingdom
in
the
foreseeable
future
.
that
dovetail
nicely
with
my
next
question
,
which
relate
to
carbon
budgeting
.
this
be
a
feature
of
the
landscape
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
we
do
not
have
that
system
here
but
we
be
talk
about
that
system
at
the
moment
.
it
be
develop
as
a
concept
.
there
be
some
signal
come
from
government
that
it
might
be
a
way
for
government
to
proceed
.
I
be
keen
to
get
a
sense
or
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
exist
between
the
UK
Prime
Minister
's
office
relate
to
setting
target
and
how
individual
UK
line
Department
measure
up
to
that
individual
target
.
if
a
Department
do
not
reach
a
give
target
or
hit
a
milestone
,
be
there
a
punitive
effect
thereafter
for
individual
Department
?
it
would
be
useful
for
that
of
we
on
this
committee
to
have
a
sense
or
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
exist
between
the
UK
Prime
Minister
's
office
and
the
actual
principle
of
carbon
budgeting
in
the
first
instance
.
that
lead
I
to
one
of
the
recommendation
of
we
citizen
's
Assembly
.
it
speak
about
create
a
independent
body
above
government
with
legislative
tooth
that
could
put
manners
,
as
it
be
,
on
individual
Department
.
the
idea
be
that
it
would
take
the
matter
out
of
the
silo
-
base
system
that
we
all
understand
so
well
.
be
there
merit
in
that
argument
?
I
apologise
because
I
must
leave
now
but
I
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
to
Lord
Deben
and
Mr.
Stark
for
they
attendance
.
be
there
any
other
question
?
I
thank
Lord
Deben
and
Mr.
Chris
Stark

come
before
the
committee
this
afternoon

it
have
be

worthwhile

take
the
time
to
travel
here

share
they
view

experience
with

we
should
get
that
on
the
BBC
.
that
be
a
"
yes
"
.
somebody
once
say
we
should
not
knock
the
weather
because
if
it
be
not
for
the
weather
,
nine
out
of
ten
conversation
would
never
start
.
the
hearing
we
be
have
today
show
a
clear
obsession
with
the
weather
.
if
one
follow
that
logically
,
the
weather
seem
to
be
the
mechanism
by
which
one
can
communicate
so
much
because
Irish
people
be
obsessed
with
it
and
one
can
use
it
as
a
tool
with
which
to
disseminate
information
to
that
who
may
not
have
a
conceptional
understanding
of
what
climate
change
might
be
.
therein
lie
a
opportunity
.
I
be
conscious
that
we
can
not
put
too
much
of
a
onus
on
RTÉ
.
the
organisation
have
such
a
wide
remit
and
only
collect
so
much
from
the
broadcasting
fee
.
it
would
be
easy
for
we
to
say
RTÉ
need
to
do
more
.
I
note
there
be
a
audience
council
report
from
2014
-
I
do
not
know
whether
there
have
be
one
subsequently
-
which
show
clearly
the
need
for
great
messaging
around
climate
change
.
we
must
take
in
good
faith
what
have
be
state
here
today
in
respect
of
the
various
initiative
in
which
RTÉ
be
involve
through
programming
,
through
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
in
inculcate
more
story
through
current
affair
programme
such
as
"
Morning
Ireland
"
.
the
witness
will
correct
I
if
I
be
misinterpret
the
late
Professor
Marshall
McLuhan
's
assertion
that
"
the
medium
be
the
message
"
.
I
accept
that
the
medium
of
television
and
the
television
schedule
be
limit
.
I
also
accept
the
point
make
in
respect
of
the
weather
slot
and
whether
they
present
a
opportunity
to
communicate
a
message
.
I
would
contend
that
be
probably
not
the
case
.
however
,
if
Met
Éireann
and
RTÉ
be
partner
through
the
RTÉ
player
,
they
have
a
infinite
opportunity
to
message
to
countless
number
of
people
and
therein
lie
the
opportunity
.
we
be
all
now
dependent
on
the
player
.
I
can
not
be
at
home
at
9
p.m.
or
10
a.m.
but
I
can
watch
programme
afterwards
.
the
player
be
a
major
resource
.
if
we
have
meteorologist
who
be
talk
about
the
attributional
effect
-
in
that
regard
,
we
need
to
do
more
to
use
language
that
ordinary
people
can
understand
-
and
if
we
have
met
Éireann
partner
with
RTÉ
on
the
player
to
disseminate
bespoke
simple
message
around
the
effect
of
weather
pattern
in
three
,
four
or
five
minute
segment
,
it
would
become
as
popular
as
a
YouTube
clip
.
there
be
no
reason
Met
Éireann
could
not
use
YouTube
as
a
medium
as
well
to
get
that
message
out
.
we
have
a
opportunity
here
.
this
meeting
have
be
informative
.
my
question
arise
from
my
lack
of
understanding
of
how
Met
Éireann
see
its
remit
.
while
I
understand
the
partnership
with
RTÉ
and
the
element
of
disseminate
information
,
do
Met
Éireann
see
its
role
as
be
a
advocate
for
messaging
around
the
dire
impact
of
climate
change
?
in
its
statement
,
Met
Éireann
use
the
word
"
unequivocal
"
in
relation
to
the
evidence
base
that
exist
around
climate
change
.
to
take
that
one
step
further
,
do
Met
Éireann
see
its
role
as
be
a
interpreter
of
the
science
and
a
disseminator
of
a
message
in
respect
of
that
?
I
sense
some
reticence
-
the
witness
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
-
from
Met
Éireann
about
its
role
.
I
understand
the
partnership
and
the
dynamic
between
Met
Éireann
and
RTÉ
.
we
have
all
come
to
depend
on
the
weather
report
,
which
be
part
and
parcel
of
we
life
,
but
I
sense
some
reticence
on
the
part
of
Met
Éireann
about
where
it
see
itself
in
term
of
the
dissemination
of
the
message
to
the
wide
populace
.
I
ask
Mr.
Moran
to
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
the
key
point
on
the
attribution
be
that
we
be
all
policy
-
maker
around
this
table
and
we
be
of
a
certain
age
range
.
there
be
that
who
be
much
young
than
we
who
be
ahead
of
we
.
there
be
also
that
who
be
in
we
age
range
and
maybe
old
,
who
be
voter
.
they
be
consumer
.
there
be
the
causal
link
between
weather
pattern
,
the
effect
of
climate
change
and
the
heating
of
the
planet
which
be
attributable
to
human
behaviour
.
if
such
link
be
more
widely
understand
it
could
influence
how
they
make
decision
about
such
matter
as
how
they
consume
energy
and
the
type
of
car
they
drive
.
somewhere
there
be
a
role
for
Met
Éireann
to
link
the
two
,
for
example
,
where
the
weather
be
change
as
a
result
of
planet
heating
that
be
we
to
do
x
it
would
have
a
bear
.
deputy
Heydon
make
the
point
about
the
daffodil
in
bloom
in
January
.
we
be
go
into
the
Christmas
period
at
12°
.
I
ask
people
old
than
myself
if
they
ever
remember
christmass
of
12°
in
they
living
memory
.
the
answer
be
"
no
"
.
this
be
people
in
they
70
.
that
be
not
to
say
it
have
not
happen
in
the
past
.
that
be
as
a
result
of
the
heating
of
the
planet
.
it
have
to
be
,
if
the
science
be
to
be
believe
.
how
one
link
behavioural
change
with
that
fact
be
where
Met
Éireann
have
a
role
to
play
.
the
chairman
will
forgive
I
,
if
I
have
go
on
too
long
.
I
appreciate
that
I
have
exceed
my
time
.
for
Ms
Forbes
there
be
the
question
of
the
audience
council
.
I
do
not
understand
how
it
work
and
do
not
expect
she
to
answer
that
question
.
be
2014
the
last
year
in
which
there
be
a
audience
council
or
be
there
another
in
the
intervene
period
?
if
there
have
be
another
report
in
the
intervene
period
,
be
she
get
the
same
feedback
on
the
need
for
messaging
on
climate
change
?
she
can
revert
to
I
at
some
other
stage
on
the
issue
,
if
she
so
wish
.
I
think
if
Met
Éireann
do
something
such
as
set
up
a
focus
group
on
the
dissemination
of
the
message
of
climate
change
,
it
would
yield
some
wonderful
information
.
to
end
on
a
positive
note
,
there
be
a
inherent
trust
in
Met
Éireann
,
which
be
a
key
point
and
that
public
trust
in
Met
Éireann
be
its
great
asset
-
even
though
we
do
not
always
like
the
weather
report

all
committee
member
be
very
conscious
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
there
be
mechanism
put
in
place
which
reflect
the
view
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
in
respect
of
fuel
poverty
.
while
,
by
and
large
,
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
€
80
per
tonne
by
2030
,
which
be
set
out
by
Professor
FitzGerald
and
other
,
there
be
also
a
need
for
action
build
into
the
recommendation
of
this
committee
to
ensure
there
be
plan
to
ensure
that
funding
be
put
in
place
to
protect
that
people
who
be
in
fuel
impoverish
household
and
,
in
particular
,
that
who
be
on
low
income
.
we
be
all
very
mindful
of
that
.
I
seek
clarification
from
the
chairman
on
what
be
actually
before
we
as
a
amendment
.
as
I
understand
it
,
we
be
to
divide
on
one
element
of
the
recommendation
,
namely
,
the
word
"
accept
"
versus
"
agree
.
"
in
other
word
,
we
either
accept
the
expert
advice
in
favour
of
this
measure
from
the
CCAC
for
a
carbon
price
trajectory
that
rise
to
€
80
per
tonne
by
2030
and
that
this
should
be
support
in
legislation
by
2019
.
the
rest
of
the
wording
of
that
paragraph
speak
to
the
issue
here
in
support
citizen
'
assembly
,
recognise
the
negative
impact
for
people
who
be
on
low
income
and
so
on
,
accept
the
international
consensus
around
the
need
for
behavioural
change
and
increase
investment
towards
mitigation
and
away
from
fossil
fuel
and
agree
that
carbon
pricing
should
be
ring
-
fence
.
the
clarification
I
be
seek
be
on
whether
we
be
divide
on
the
issue
of
whether
we
accept
the
2030
target
,
as
set
out
by
a
independent
body
outside
of
this
House
,
or
whether
we
can
find
a
mechanism
to
recognise
that
target
and
not
divide
the
committee
.
there
may
be
a
compromise
.
instead
of
use
the
word
"
accept
"
for
the
expert
advice
,
perhaps
we
could
say
that
we
"
recognise
"
the
expert
advice
of
the
CCAC
for
a
carbon
price
trajectory
.
therefore
,
we
would
be
acknowledge
the
outside
expertise
on
this
issue
and
we
would
be
obviate
the
need
to
divide
the
committee
on
the
issue
.
I
seek
a
explanation
as
to
whether
the
use
of
the
word
"
least
cost
pathway
"
be
a
industry
standard
term
.
do
it
denote
a
certain
connotation
?
be
it
a
technical
term
?
I
seek
clarification
from
deputy
Corcoran
Kennedy
.
she
do
give
the
clarification
but
-----
that
be
great
,
if
she
do
.
we
have
extensive
deliberation
with
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
in
regard
to
the
just
transition
task
force
and
I
think
we
all
arrive
at
a
destination
in
respect
of
recognise
the
need
for
a
just
transition
task
force
.
I
appreciate
the
point
deputy
Bríd
Smith
be
make
in
respect
of
the
critique
of
the
State
's
JobPath
programme
.
my
worry
be
that
by
make
that
amendment
we
could
dilute
recommendation
4
(
iv
)
which
relate
to
transition
people
away
from
carbon
production
into
local
economic
diversification
,
where
worker
themselves
become
partner
in
that
transition
.
if
they
be
active
stakeholder
in
that
transition
,
the
risk
of
exploitation
,
as
deputy
Bríd
Smith
be
probably
argue
here
,
be
diminish
because
they
be
partner
in
they
own
transition
.
that
be
the
point
or
philosophy
behind
the
ICTU
's
submission
to
the
committee
.
I
accept
the
amendment
that
deputy
Smith
be
make
but
I
would
not
want
to
introduce
issue
-
I
will
not
call
they
extraneous
issue
-
into
the
purity
of
the
just
transition
task
force
.
however
,
if
there
be
a
critique
to
be
have
of
social
protection
policy
this
might
not
be
the
chapter
or
the
forum
in
which
to
do
that
.
I
accept
the
deputy
's
right
to
bring
forward
the
amendment
,
but
I
ask
that
we
do
not
diminish
in
any
way
the
success
that
we
have
manage
to
secure
in
this
report
through
the
mere
existence
of
a
just
transition
task
force
.
that
be
a
success
in
itself
.
social
protection
policy
should
be
critique
,
attack
or
change
elsewhere
but
not
necessarily
in
the
forum
of
this
report
.
I
think
a
broad
view
have
emerge
in
favour
of
deputy
Bríd
Smith
's
amendment
.
the
wording
before
be
:
"
the
implementation
of
agree
intervention
for
transition
as
develop
in
the
framework
should
involve
a
partnership
approach
involve
government
,
employer
,
farmer
,
trade
union
and
civil
society
"
.
trade
union
be
the
backbone
,
specifically
as
it
relate
to
the
midland
.
it
will
move
into
the
farming
sector
and
other
.
I
would
have
think
the
wording
,
as
it
stand
,
would
have
absolutely
negate
the
opportunity
for
exploitation
because
civil
society
and
trade
union
be
include
.
notwithstanding
that
,
if
member
be
land
on
a
particular
view
,
I
will
absolutely
and
utterly
support
whatever
compromise
they
want
to
reach
.
to
be
helpful
,
we
would
not
be
specific
about
JobPath
.
we
would
be
say
no
worker
should
be
force
into
a
labour
activation
measure
prescribe
by
the
government
against
they
will
or
something
like
it
.
we
have
spend
hour
discuss
this
issue
and
I
have
make
it
a
red
line
issue
from
my
party
's
perspective
.
the
idea
behind
a
just
transition
be
that
a
decision
would
not
be
make
against
a
worker
without
bring
he
or
she
on
board
,
whether
he
or
she
be
a
peat
worker
in
the
midland
or
work
in
a
carbon
intensive
industry
.
no
decision
would
be
make
over
he
or
she
head
and
he
or
she
would
be
bring
along
or
part
of
the
movement
towards
a
just
transition
.
I
be
not
against
what
deputy
Smith
be
say
.
the
philosophy
be
absolutely
right
,
but
she
be
try
to
prescribe
something
very
specific
.
I
do
not
think
we
should
be
so
prescriptive
about
JobPath
.
we
can
talk
about
ensure
there
would
be
no
exploitation
of
worker
or
that
no
worker
would
be
shoehorn
into
a
scheme
that
would
work
against
he
or
she
transition
or
good
or
personal
interest
,
but
I
want
to
ensure
we
will
not
lose
anything
in
pursue
the
concept
of
a
just
transition
.
I
want
to
try
to
work
with
deputy
Bríd
Smith
and
other
member
to
come
up
with
a
wording
.
if
we
talk
about
ensure
there
would
be
no
exploitation
of
worker
and
find
such
a
wording
,
we
can
find
a
compromise
.
we
be
obviously
not
in
agreement
.
be
deputy
Bríd
Smith
say
she
be
oppose
to
any
kind
of
labour
activation
programme
?
be
she
say
that
by
they
nature
labour
activation
programme
,
regardless
of
what
they
be
call
,
be
exploitative
because
if
that
be
the
case
,
we
will
have
to
divide
on
the
issue
?
I
have
be
here
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
understand
that
people
be
here
to
deputise
today
.
I
absolutely
respect
they
wish
to
compromise
.
deputy
Bríd
Smith
have
suggest
that
we
divide
on
this
issue
.
I
be
happy
to
discuss
this
matter
further
.
it
will
have
to
be
deal
with
anyway
,
and
take
it
offline
be
not
necessarily
go
to
rectify
the
matter
.
I
want
to
say
very
clear
that
I
accept
deputy
Bríd
Smith
's
point
about
ensure
there
be
no
exploitation
of
worker
in
a
just
transition
to
a
decarbonised
economy
.
we
must
find
a
wording
that
respects
the
premise
but
be
not
so
prescriptive
about
one
particular
programme
,
which
might
cease
to
exist
.
I
have
no
problem
in
principle
with
that
proposal
but
I
seek
clarification
in
respect
of
the
previous
vote
that
have
take
place
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
wording
in
respect
of
recommendation
no.
16
,
arise
from
the
two
vote
that
we
have
have
?
as
I
understand
it
now
,
we
have
revert
back
to
the
original
draft
text
-----
if
we
be
go
to
consider
this
overnight
,
the
question
arise
as
to
what
can
conceivably
be
do
overnight
that
will
amend
this
or
not
amend
it
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
Clear
political
fault
line
be
now
emerge
in
respect
of
recommendation
no.
16
.
I
be
of
the
view
that
we
should
keep
go
tonight
,
to
be
honest
but
I
will
listen
to
what
other
member
have
to
say
on
that
.
I
have
specific
amendment
in
respect
of
the
contentious
wording
and
would
like
a
opportunity
to
discuss
that
further
.
unless
people
be
go
to
come
back
in
here
tomorrow
with
something
new
or
innovative
,
we
be
just
go
to
be
rehash
the
same
old
argument
again
and
I
be
not
sure
that
be
the
good
use
of
we
time
.
it
be
only
6.45
p.m
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
let
I
back
in
again
.
I
be
not
go
to
speak
for
too
long
on
the
Labour
Party
amendment
except
to
say
that
it
seek
to
give
some
power
to
the
standing
committee
in
respect
of
explore
issue
like
fuel
poverty
and
the
effect
of
a
carbon
tax
on
household
.
it
give
a
voice
to
the
committee
itself
.
my
concern
be
around
the
fact
that
we
already
have
have
a
iterative
process
here
in
respect
of
the
issue
of
fuel
poverty
and
so
on
.
there
be
scope
within
the
wording
of
recommendation
no.
16
,
even
if
we
do
not
take
my
wording
to
the
letter
of
the
law
,
to
allow
for
the
standing
committee
,
in
its
ongoing
work
after
the
publication
of
the
report
,
to
deal
substantively
with
the
issue
that
we
all
have
in
respect
of
fuel
poverty
.
again
,
nobody
have
be
able
to
clarify
for
I
what
it
be
that
will
happen
overnight
.
it
be
only
6.50
p.m.
now
.
I
suggest
as
a
compromise
that
if
we
be
go
to
meet
tomorrow
,
that
we
park
chapter
6
and
try
to
get
the
other
chapter
out
of
the
way
this
evening
.
that
might
be
a
good
way
of
do
it
so
that
we
be
not
reconvenen
-----
if
I
be
work
in
Moneypoint
and
I
be
give
a
redundancy
package
,
and
if
I
go
out
and
start
what
become
a
multi-million
euro
business
where
I
become
a
employer
,
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
be
the
amendment
say
that
all
the
rights
and
entitlement
I
have
as
a
employee
in
Moneypoint
would
transfer
automatically
to
I
in
my
new
lifestyle
or
profession
?
for
example
,
if
I
be
a
general
operative
in
Moneypoint
and
I
go
away
and
retrain
as
a
lawyer
or
the
like
,
be
the
amendment
say
that
everything
that
apply
in
the
old
job
should
now
apply
in
the
new
job
?
I
be
try
to
understand
it
.
they
be
enshrine
in
legislation
on
labour
rights
.
can
I
respond
to
that
?
a
pertinent
point
be
be
make
here
.
let
we
look
at
all
the
amendment
that
be
cross
out
here
.
I
have
a
number
of
amendment
,
as
have
other
member
,
that
be
,
for
want
of
a
good
expression
,
triage
by
the
adviser
and
deal
with
at
adviser
level
with
political
input
.
my
understanding
be
that
this
issue
may
not
have
come
up
for
discussion
.
member
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
within
the
State
sector
.
the
deputy
be
amend
she
own
amendment
.
I
think
that
be
agree
,
include
the
revolution
bit
.
paragraph
16
in
respect
of
carbon
tax
,
in
which
we
have
revert
to
the
original
draft
,
speak
to
the
public
consultation
with
citizen
,
ngo
,
small
business
and
other
relevant
organisation
on
how
to
fairly
allocate
whatever
hypothecated
or
ring
-
fence
revenue
be
propose
to
be
collect
.
the
worry
I
have
about
the
amendment
be
that
industrial
job
will
be
lose
.
there
be
a
potential
negative
impact
on
price
at
the
farm
gate
and
,
in
the
co-operative
model
,
there
be
a
risk
that
employee
who
be
not
shareholder
,
such
as
accountant
,
technical
adviser
,
marketing
and
sale
staff
,
will
get
the
chop
if
there
be
a
profit
warning
.
this
people
be
live
mainly
in
rural
community
and
in
small
and
medium
-
sized
town
that
be
ally
to
co-op
.
by
seek
to
put
in
place
a
inquiry
,
I
would
fear
that
industrial
worker
in
the
area
I
represent
would
be
the
first
to
be
put
out
of
the
door
.
in
any
case
,
the
wording
in
the
body
of
the
report
could
facilitate
the
process
of
a
inquiry
where
there
be
specific
recommendation
by
the
Department
of
Finance
for
public
consultation
.
I
want
to
ensure
we
will
stick
to
the
spirit
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
report
.
we
have
a
specific
amendment
with
a
target
of
approximately
100000
house
per
annum
,
but
as
a
committee
we
have
settle
on
a
figure
of
75000
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
on
ensure
there
would
be
a
social
element
also
such
that
we
would
not
make
it
too
technocratic
.
that
may
not
be
the
specific
intention
,
but
it
could
be
interpret
in
a
way
that
would
be
too
technocratic
.
we
want
to
ensure
we
will
develop
infrastructure
that
will
have
the
requisite
skill
set
and
the
pot
of
money
require
to
do
this
and
set
clear
target
for
retrofit
.
the
45,000
target
be
too
low
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
in
reality
far
few
than
that
number
be
achieve
on
a
annual
basis
.
there
be
scope
to
beef
up
the
Sustainable
Energy
Authority
of
Ireland
,
SEAI
,
and
work
with
stakeholder
such
as
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
and
academic
institution
to
develop
short
course
,
for
instance
,
to
try
to
get
more
highly
skilled
graduate
into
the
space
to
create
a
demand
for
retrofit
.
we
need
to
create
a
infrastructure
that
will
ensure
the
primary
user
will
not
face
a
arcane
or
overly
bureaucratic
set
of
guideline
when
he
or
she
apply
for
a
grant
.
that
process
should
be
make
as
seamless
as
possible
.
we
interaction
with
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
be
very
effective
because
it
ensure
it
act
as
a
interlocutor
with
the
service
provider
,
the
engineer
and
so
on
.
I
appreciate
that
.
to
conclude
,
we
should
keep
the
wording
in
recommendation
no.
35
as
simple
as
possible
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
I
ask
deputy
Corcoran
Kennedy
to
consider
keep
it
as
it
be
.
if
I
be
earn
€
200000
a
year
and
rent
in
south
County
Dublin
,
would
this
apply
to
I
?
would
I
get
a
tax
allowance
?
we
have
to
be
careful
about
the
wording
of
the
amendment
we
put
forward
.
I
understand
from
where
deputy
Bríd
Smith
be
come
,
but
we
have
to
be
careful
in
the
way
we
word
amendment
.
to
clarify
,
how
stand
the
amendment
?
I
would
like
belt
and
brace
on
this
.
can
I
have
include
a
line
or
sentence
,
state
the
issue
that
have
be
outline
by
deputy
Bríd
Smith
will
be
discuss
,
and
that
there
be
a
specific
-----
add
the
word
"
and
modest
"
.
I
support
the
principle
of
the
amendment
.
they
be
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
recommendation
.
there
be
a
"
but
"
,
unfortunately
.
I
wonder
if
the
two
can
be
separate
and
whether
there
can
be
compromise
regard
the
amendment
.
if
we
have
to
recommend
that
all
current
transport
infrastructure
programme
be
revise
,
I
imagine
the
assumption
be
a
revision
downwards
or
away
from
investment
in
some
of
the
project
deputy
Neville
,
for
example
,
outline
.
the
people
I
represent
rely
heavily
on
car
.
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
hope
there
will
be
a
transition
from
diesel
and
petrol
car
to
hybrid
and
electric
vehicle
,
evs
.
he
be
hope
that
will
happen
as
soon
as
possible
and
transport
will
be
decarbonise
in
that
way
.
my
fear
be
that
large
infrastructural
project
will
be
take
off
of
the
table
.
I
refer
to
that
necessary
to
move
people
and
sustain
they
livelihood
.
this
project
be
require
to
allow
people
get
to
they
place
of
work
,
to
college
and
to
hospital
to
access
medical
appointment
and
service
.
the
transition
from
car
to
bus
or
train
will
not
happen
quickly
enough
if
we
start
question
or
recommend
another
mechanism
.
I
would
like
to
see
the
standing
committee
take
part
of
this
amendment
and
have
robust
engagement
on
what
a
2:1
ratio
actually
mean
.
I
refer
to
have
real
analysis
of
that
suggestion
and
bring
in
witness
regard
what
that
mean
.
I
be
broadly
in
favour
of
what
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
be
try
to
achieve
.
it
would
mean
have
to
axe
current
infrastructure
project
in
the
short
term
,
however
.
that
could
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
livelihood
.
what
the
deputy
be
propose
can
be
do
in
Dublin
,
Limerick
or
Galway
.
I
be
not
sure
it
can
be
do
in
the
town
and
village
in
between
that
city
.
I
would
like
to
keep
a
open
mind
,
however
.
I
would
also
like
the
standing
committee
to
engage
further
on
this
matter
,
if
we
be
keep
in
line
with
the
recommendation
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
.
no
,
I
have
not
.
we
be
all
on
a
journey
on
this
one
.
as
I
believe
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
be
press
he
amendment
,
it
be
moot
.

agriculture

as
be
the
case
in
this
matter
,
one
be
try
to
arrive
at
a
common
position
to
seek
to
find
some
sort
of
compromise
,
for
which
one
seek
to
find
a
majority
or
a
consensus
.
while
we
be
talk
technically
about
amendment
that
be
on
the
table
to
be
agree
or
vote
upon
,
the
Labour
Party
have
two
very
specific
amendment
Nosemcue
26
and
27
.
on
the
basis
of
the
agree
text
that
have
now
come
forward
-
agree
by
the
Labour
Party
,
Fianna
Fáil
,
Fine
Gael
and
the
Green
Party
,
we
be
now
happy
to
withdraw
we
amendment
.
we
feel
that
the
proposal
of
the
compromise
for
mechanism
to
be
put
in
place
to
look
at
how
carbon
tax
would
affect
that
people
in
fuel
impoverished
house
-
and
that
a
mechanism
be
put
in
place
so
the
most
vulnerable
people
be
protect
-
mean
we
can
sign
up
to
this
.
at
this
stage
,
I
be
quite
happy
to
withdraw
amendment
no.
26
and
27
.
the
wording
be
clear
that
the
government
should
,
prior
to
the
introduction
of
any
increase
in
carbon
taxation
,
examine
the
impact
on
low
-
income
family
and
,
on
the
basis
of
this
finding
,
introduce
specific
policy
measure
to
assist
that
who
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
immediately
transition
from
fossil
fuel
,
include
the
potential
use
of
social
protection
mechanism
such
as
tax
credit
and
welfare
payment
.
carbon
tax
be
in
existence
and
yield
approximately
€400
million
but
that
€400
million
go
to
the
Exchequer
.
this
committee
be
seek
to
ring
-
fence
money
collect
from
the
tax
so
that
retrofit
can
be
do
and
we
can
transition
from
carbon
to
meet
we
target
.
if
we
agree
to
this
amendment
the
government
would
conduct
a
review
,
to
be
complete
by
June
2019
,
of
what
may
be
the
most
appropriate
measure
and
what
be
the
nature
and
extent
of
fuel
poverty
across
all
cohort
.
we
be
build
into
the
amendment
a
set
of
measure
that
seek
to
protect
the
most
vulnerable
but
ensure
that
we
do
not
move
until
the
review
have
be
do
.
June
2019
may
be
too
short
a
timeframe
and
it
may
need
to
be
push
out
to
July
.
it
be
important
that
we
study
what
be
in
the
amendment
first
,
before
we
draw
any
conclusion
.
I
would
like
to
be
helpful
to
deputy
Smith
.
how
will
the
chairman
proceed
technically
with
that
amendment
?
on
a
technical
point
,
if
deputy
Smith
's
amendment
be
as
she
put
to
the
committee
,
be
she
now
amend
she
own
amendment
that
she
have
tab
?
my
understanding
from
deputy
Bríd
Smith
's
early
intervention
be
that
she
want
this
to
be
a
stand
-
alone
recommendation
,
and
it
will
presumably
be
press
as
such
.
the
issue
now
before
we
be
that
the
text
of
the
stand
-
alone
amendment
that
deputy
Bríd
Smith
have
put
forward
seem
to
have
change
,
and
subsequently
additional
wording
must
be
bring
forward
to
reflect
the
amendment
she
seek
to
have
as
a
standing
order
.
I
do
not
want
to
say
anything
in
the
absence
of
the
proposer
of
the
amendment
except
that
I
have
no
problem
with
she
put
forward
she
amendment
because
she
be
amend
it
herself
.
I
make
a
point
about
June
2019
.
we
vote
on
the
amendment
.
have
that
be
change
to
July
?
I
think
that
be
agree
.
who
be
to
say
we
will
vote
against
the
amendment
?
I
say
put
it
.
the
deputy
have
make
the
case
for
she
amendment
and
it
be
now
6
p.m.
on
Thursday
.
I
do
not
want
anybody
to
mischaracterise
the
role
of
the
adviser
in
this
process
.
I
want
to
be
very
clear
that
they
have
play
a
extremely
beneficial
role
.
have
it
not
be
for
my
own
,
Anja
Murray
,
I
would
have
be
at
a
serious
loss
in
the
work
the
committee
have
do
.
I
do
not
want
people
to
have
the
impression
that
the
adviser
be
anything
less
than
courteous
and
professional
and
that
they
seek
to
work
together
even
when
there
be
significant
difference
of
opinion
in
respect
of
policy
issue
.
I
appreciate
that
comment
.
I
could
not
have
do
it
without
the
committee
member
.
let
we
go
forward
for
climate
change
and
climate
action
.
we
need
to
go
into
private
session
briefly
to
agree
the
term
of
we
standing
committee
.

I
apologise
for
be
late
.
I
be
chair
a
meeting
of
another
committee
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
attend
.
I
hope
we
can
have
a
further
engagement
with
he
on
a
line
-
by
-
line
basis
,
if
time
allow
,
at
some
future
date
.
we
committee
have
42
recommendation
,
whereas
183
action
be
outline
in
the
government
's
report
.
I
perceive
a
gap
between
the
all
-
party
committee
's
recommendation
and
the
government
's
position
.
notwithstanding
the
positive
aspiration
in
its
approach
,
I
hope
the
entire
government
can
work
with
the
joint
committee
to
iron
out
some
of
the
gap
.
one
such
gap
relate
,
as
deputy
Pringle
indicate
,
to
the
relevant
legislation
.
there
be
a
sense
of
urgency
on
the
part
of
the
joint
committee
in
respect
of
the
need
to
put
in
place
,
soon
rather
than
late
,
a
legislative
base
for
the
legally
-
binding
target
lead
to
2030
and
,
thereafter
,
the
net
zero
target
for
2050
,
which
be
one
of
the
recommendation
.
I
be
a
little
concerned
that
the
government
's
approach
mean
that
a
Bill
might
not
be
publish
until
next
March
and
that
it
would
not
be
enact
until
the
end
of
2020
.
another
year
could
conceivably
pass
before
we
address
the
binding
target
.
the
minister
might
comment
on
that
point
.
the
second
and
probably
more
important
aspect
relate
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
from
60
million
tonne
to
33
million
by
2030
.
in
the
government
's
plan
,
I
do
not
see
clear
metric
on
how
we
will
do
this
and
adhere
to
the
2030
target
.
respectfully
,
have
work
with
the
minister
in
other
Department
and
know
what
he
have
deliver
,
I
be
worried
that
there
might
be
slippage
and
that
we
might
oversh
the
2030
target
in
favour
of
a
aspiration
to
net
zero
by
2050
.
by
2030
,
however
,
we
may
still
be
far
off
target
for
we
commitment
under
the
Paris
agreement
of
2015
.
I
wonder
whether
there
should
be
a
great
sense
of
urgency
for
clear
,
bespoke
action
.
for
community
energy
,
rural
transport
,
active
travel
and
the
rewetting
of
peatland
,
for
example
,
my
fear
be
that
within
the
government
,
there
will
be
a
siloed
approach
,
without
a
proper
reporting
mechanism
or
smacht
for
individual
Department
to
deliver
on
that
action
.
if
there
be
not
a
properly
overarching
cabinet
sub
-
committee
or
a
robust
climate
action
delivery
board
,
I
worry
that
Department
will
slip
in
they
obligation
to
deliver
on
climate
action
.
respectfully
,
it
be
not
enough
for
the
government
to
appear
before
the
committee
and
say
it
be
for
,
say
,
the
Minister
for
Culture
,
Heritage
and
the
Gaeltacht
,
deputy
Madigan
,
to
examine
the
rewetting
of
peatland
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
already
have
evidence
,
through
we
deliberation
in
the
committee
,
that
only
1
%
of
peatland
in
Ireland
be
under
rehabilitation
or
restoration
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
to
that
rather
than
have
to
wait
from
the
Minister
for
Culture
,
Heritage
and
the
Gaeltacht
.
I
,
too
,
be
conscious
of
that
but
I
do
not
believe
I
have
take
up
as
much
time
as
other
.
in
summary
,
will
the
minister
comment
on
the
delay
in
legislation
,
primarily
due
to
a
lack
of
urgency
,
and
the
fact
that
the
target
for
2030
have
be
overseet
,
which
be
a
deep
worry
?
will
there
be
a
proper
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
to
carbon
budgeting
and
clear
repercussion
if
individual
Department
do
not
deliver
?
what
be
the
legislative
basis
to
enforce
the
legally
-
bind
target
?
on
carbon
budgeting
,
do
the
minister
envisage
provide
a
figure
for
the
amount
save
in
net
tonnage
?
if
we
disseminate
information
for
public
discourse
,
Opposition
member
like
I
will
ask
how
the
60
million
tonne
of
emission
will
be
reduce
to
33
million
,
which
be
the
most
important
metric
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
come
before
the
committee
.
I
also
thank
committee
member
for
they
contribution
.

I
also
thank

member
for
they
contribution
.
this
have
be
very
interesting
so
far
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
contribution
because
they
have
certainly
broaden
my
perspective
regard
the
issue
of
cycling
and
what
can
be
deliver
.
from
listen
to
the
witness
,
one
thing
strike
I
.
there
seem
to
be
a
common
denominator
base
on
my
interpretation
of
what
they
say
.
if
we
look
at
Cambridge
,
Brussels
or
Manchester
,
we
can
see
there
be
a
cultural
shift
in
the
mindset
of
policymaker
at
ground
,
local
authority
and
government
level
towards
want
to
make
this
happen
.
they
be
now
embrace
this
as
a
concept
and
clear
policy
provision
.
the
challenge
we
face
in
this
country
involve
shift
the
psychology
towards
create
the
infrastructure
.
what
be
it
that
Brussels
can
do
?
I
live
in
Brussels
and
use
to
cycle
everywhere
.
I
could
move
from
the
city
centre
to
the
countryside
in
Flanders
.
it
be
effectively
cycle
heaven
because
the
cyclist
be
king
or
queen
.
it
be
a
mindset
that
favour
the
cyclist
whereas
in
this
country
,
the
car
be
king
or
queen
.
if
I
have
a
car
,
I
have
the
God
-
give
right
to
go
anywhere
and
own
the
public
thoroughfare
,
and
everybody
else
be
incidental
to
my
enjoyment
of
my
vehicle
.
how
do
we
get
policymaker
at
local
authority
level
to
shift
they
thinking
away
from
design
infrastructure
?
base
on
my
experience
as
a
former
member
of
a
local
authority
and
a
member
of
this
House
,
I
can
say
that
everything
be
design
by
engineer
.
I
do
not
want
to
criticise
engineer
in
any
way
but
they
think
in
straight
line
from
a
to
B
and
there
be
no
input
from
architect
or
town
planner
.
what
advice
can
the
witness
give
we
in
respect
of
seek
to
shift
that
mindset
within
the
local
authority
paradigm
?
where
do
we
get
the
paradigm
shift
?
Mr.
Deegan
pull
in
advocate
and
the
Chris
Boardman
of
this
world
because
they
be
influencer
-
star
,
so
to
speak
,
to
borrow
that
awful
phrase
that
have
be
use
by
Mr.
Johnson
and
he
like
-
to
begin
to
change
the
mindset
and
to
begin
to
influence
politician
,
and
then
we
see
it
flow
within
the
system
,
as
it
be
.
I
would
love
to
talk
forever
but
I
have
only
five
minute
.
could
I
hear
about
the
Brussels
and
Cambridge
experience
because
Cambridge
be
a
university
town
while
Brussels
be
,
arguably
,
a
cosmopolitan
university
city
that
be
very
international
?
I
imagine
that
it
be
easy
to
roll
out
cycling
infrastructure
in
a
place
with
a
lot
of
student
.
the
witness
talk
about
the
Cambridge
busway
and
cycleway
project
,
which
involve
move
out
into
rural
area
.
it
be
a
bit
like
Galway
where
the
car
be
still
king
but
many
student
use
they
bike
and
one
can
plan
accordingly
because
there
be
a
population
base
for
cycling
that
demand
facilitation
.
the
demand
be
there
.
how
do
the
federation
get
the
local
authority
in
Cambridge
to
buy
into
what
it
be
do
?
I
imagine
that
it
be
easy
there
than
in
a
city
such
as
Manchester
or
London
.
can
that
tool
be
plug
into
any
scenario
?
the
Netherlands
have
reach
7
%
.
be
the
local
authority
drive
that
or
be
it
the
government
?
on
that
note
,
the
joint
committee
be
adjourn
until
Wednesday
,
10
July
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
come

no
,
thank
you
.
I
wish
to
come
back
to
financing
and
scalability
,
which
be
the
two
element
to
this
that
I
can
discern
.
if
question
about
finance
have
already
be
ask
and
answer
-----
how
can
we
get
bank
and
credit
union
to
finance
this
opportunity
for
people
live
in
typical
1970
bungalow
?
such
people
might
have
some
savings
and
can
benefit
from
the
SEAI
grant
.
however
,
they
still
fall
short
of
the
a
cost
of
a
deep
retrofit
or
a
good
energy
solution
.
how
do
we
fill
that
final
piece
of
the
pie
?
I
have
not
be
able
to
figure
that
out
.
the
credit
union
movement
and
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
have
talk
about
get
into
this
space
.
I
imagine
the
bank
could
not
care
less
about
this
space
.
however
,
relatively
small
loan
could
be
scale
up
to
achieve
a
lot
.
that
be
the
first
question
.
yes
,
please
.
I
appreciate
that
.
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
around
financing
but
at
least
we
can
take
some
empirical
model
from
the
SEAI
research
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Tom
Parlon
back
to
the
House
,
if
that
have
not
be
do
already
.
I
be
sure
it
have
.
I
refer
to
part
L
of
the
building
regulation
and
the
skill
set
need
for
retrofit
.
a
finite
pool
of
labour
be
available
for
construction
in
Ireland
at
present
but
that
be
go
to
ramp
up
.
I
have
a
two
-
part
question
.
first
,
how
will
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
,
CIF
,
and
other
train
the
type
of
people
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
be
supply
in
order
to
meet
the
demand
?
as
I
say
at
the
outset
,
for
efficiency
's
sake
if
my
question
have
be
answer
already
the
witness
need
not
answer
they
.
the
second
question
concern
part
L
of
the
building
regulation
.
we
have
discuss
nearly
zero
energy
building
.
what
be
the
energy
fit
in
this
building
?
be
it
boiler
,
advanced
boiler
or
heat
exchanger
?
what
be
the
CIF
's
interpretation
of
part
L
for
new
build
?
my
fear
be
that
solar
and
heat
exchanger
might
not
be
part
of
it
.
be
there
any
thinking
within
CIF
on
that
?
that
be
the
challenge
.
we
be
now
go
to
load
the
grid
.
we
will
effectively
use
fossil
fuel
to
add
more
power
to
the
grid
to
meet
the
target
from
a
building
perspective
.
at
the
same
time
,
there
will
be
a
exponential
increase
in
the
amount
of
fossil
fuel
we
use
to
keep
the
grid
go
.
I
be
play
devil
's
advocate
now
-----

I
be
delighted
to
be
in
the
presence
of
the
gentleman
from
Tipperary
again
.
one
of
the
committee
's
first
action
be
to
visit
Tipperary
and
it
be
a
very
useful
tutorial
for
we
.
speak
for
myself
,
I
be
largely
ignorant
of
the
work
that
be
be
do
by
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
and
we
certainly
learn
a
great
deal
from
that
visit
.
I
be
not
sure
how
long
ago
that
be
,
but
if
we
be
to
be
honest
it
would
appear
that
little
or
no
progress
in
further
the
agenda
have
be
make
in
that
time
.
have
say
that
,
we
have
a
opportunity
,
through
this
interaction
with
the
Commission
for
Regulation
of
utility
,
to
ensure
that
when
it
develop
proposal
for
the
next
round
of
connection
policy
on
its
electricity
connection
policy

ECP
-

,
to
quote
the
witness
,
it
engage
formally
or
informally
with
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
to
benefit
from
the
insight
of
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
and
its
constituent
part
.
one
cannot
design
community
-
lead
energy
project
without
talk
to
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
.
that
be
self
-
evident
and
quite
obvious
from
we
interaction
so
far
.
I
be
very
much
take
with
the
approach
of
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
.
I
would
describe
it
as
democratise
energy
supply
.
it
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
community
,
particularly
rural
dweller
,
can
feel
they
have
a

instance
,
a
opaque
community
dividend
that
the
big
player
mete
out
to
individual
community
can
be
intangible
for
many
individual
household
.
they
do
not
necessarily
see
the
benefit
of
it
.
instead
of
that
,
this
model
mean
that
people
be
part
-
owner
of
the
turbine
they
see
go
up
.
that
be
something
they
have
a
stake
in
.
starting
from
that
premise
,
we
have
to
work
back
and
devise
a
model
that
ensure
democratisation
of
energy
supply
.
that
be
a
open
remark
.
the
climate
action
plan
be
now
very
clear
on
microgeneration
policy
.
if
I
can
walk
away
from
today
's
meeting
with
a
commitment
from
the
stakeholder
to
engage
with
each
other
,
the
committee
will
have
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
other
speaker
have
already
make
that
point
.
we
committee
recommendation
be
very
clear
on
the
solar
and
photovoltaic
element
.
if
I
recall
correctly
,
we
want
to
see
progress
on
ensure
that
farm
or
individual
could
use
solar
power
by
March
2020
,
with
the
relevant
statutory
instrument
amend
to
overcome
that
hurdle
.
I
be
surprised
to
hear
that
this
process
have
not
be
expedite
.
that
be
something
that
we
as
a
committee
could
take
up
directly
with
the
minister
,
perhaps
through
the
chair
.
the
chairman
may
already
be
engage
with
the
minister
on
that
issue
.
achieve
that
could
provide
the
Trojan
horse
that
be
necessary
for
farm
in
particular
,
which
can
accommodate
big
solar
array
because
of
barn
,
outbuilding
and
so
forth
,
to
realise
this
potential
.
I
suggest
the
committee
write
to
the
relevant
line
minister
to
see
where
that
stand
.
the
chair
may
have
a
view
on
it
.
if
that
be
possible
.
we
could
then
respond
and
it
would
be
a
matter
of
public
record
.
how
many
minute
be
leave
?
that
be
fine
.
I
do
not
have
too
many
question
to
ask
.
regard
smart
metering
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
give
I
my
very
first
smart
meter
in
2008
,
when
he
roll
out
the
pilot
scheme
as
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
.
the
smart
meter
be
now
in
a
box
somewhere
in
my
attic
.
we
have
be
talk
about
smart
metering
in
this
country
for
well
over
ten
year
.
I
welcome
the
move
by
ESB
Network
,
but
I
wonder
if
we
could
learn
a
little
more
about
where
the
pilot
scheme
stand
.
I
do
not
mean
that
the
witness
must
report
back
now
.
it
would
be
useful
if
we
could
have
a
further
engagement
with
ESB
Network
.
Bandon
and
Portlaoise
be
the
two
town
involve
.
if
we
be
talk
about
behavioural
change
,
which
be
ultimately
what
this
committee
be
all
about
,
I
would
hope
for
ambition
for
a
great
roll
-
out
on
the
part
of
ESB
Network
and
the
regulator
.
the
climate
action
plan
talk
about
set
up
a
working
group
on
microgeneration
.
where
do
that
stand
as
we
speak
?
I
suggest
the
committee
write
to
whomever
be
chair
that
group
.
I
do
not
know
who
act
as
the
secretariat
for
it
.
I
suggest
the
committee
formally
write
to
that
department
to
ask
it
to
engage
with
the
stakeholder
to
my
right
,
from
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
,
for
formal
discussion
around
what
microgeneration
would
look
like
.

I
will
do
some
rapid
fire
question
,
if
the
chairman
do
not
mind
.
Professor
FitzGerald
be
look
hale
and
hearty
before
he
impending
birthday
.
I
congratulate
he
as
he
have
be
a
great
figure
on
the
public
landscape
and
he
have
always
speak
with
a
great
degree
of
common
sense
.
it
be
very
easy
to
listen
to
what
he
have
to
say
as
it
be
always
base
on
common
sense
.
I
want
to
speak
to
the
binary
argument
of
beef
versus
forestry
.
give
the
year
of
experience
,
what
be
the
perspective
of
Professor
FitzGerald
?
that
be
either
wear
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
hat
or
the
professor
hat
.
can
horticulture
drive
a
wedge
into
that
binary
argument
and
force
we
to
think
more
laterally
about
what
food
we
be
produce
and
land
use
?
can
we
get
a
short
perspective
on
that
from
Professor
FitzGerald
to
begin
with
?
do
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
have
a
mandate
to
look
at
that
?
that
be
at
a
micro
level
.
my
second
question
relate
to
Professor
FitzGerald
's
early
intervention
when
he
speak
about
the
need
to
legislate
for
the
carbon
price
or
tax
trajectory
.
what
would
such
legislation
look
like
?
if
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
be
to
legislate
for
this
tomorrow
morning
,
what
would
it
advise
the
government
to
do
?
what
would
that
legislation
look
like
?
would
it
be
highly
prescriptive
on
the
trajectory
?
would
it
set
out
a
certain
price
for
every
year
lead
up
to
a
give
target
?
my
next
question
relate
to
the
financing
of
climate
action
.
it
be
difficult
for
we
as
member
to
draw
a
line
under
what
be
currently
allocate
for
climate
action
.
the
whole
philosophy
be
base
on
behavioural
change
.
the
people
I
represent
be
not
in
a
position
to
switch
from
a
diesel
engine
to
a
fully
electric
engine
.
they
be
not
in
a
position
to
spend
between
€
50000
and
€
80000
retrofit
a
1970
bungalow
.
if
we
be
talk
about
financing
,
incentive
have
to
be
provide
.
local
authority
housing
have
extraordinary
potential
to
take
carbon
out
of
the
atmosphere
.
what
would
a
scheme
look
like
?
have
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
give
consideration
to
the
cost
of
such
a
scheme
?
have
it
look
at
the
entirety
of
the
local
authority
housing
stock
in
the
country
?
we
be
start
with
a
project
in
the
midland
,
for
which
€
20
million
have
be
provide
.
we
all
absolutely
welcome
that
,
but
I
represent
the
people
of
Cork
East
.
there
be
many
people
in
Cork
East
live
in
local
authority
house
who
do
not
believe
they
be
eligible
for
such
scheme
.
it
be
a
question
of
how
we
incentivise
private
homeowner
and
that
in
local
authority
house
.
I
put
it
to
Professor
FitzGerald
that
if
we
do
not
have
a
entire
figure
for
what
have
be
allocate
to
retrofit
house
,
it
be
difficult
to
do
a
assessment
of
what
we
could
allocate
per
house
.
do
the
advisory
council
have
a
perspective
on
how
we
would
finance
that
?
I
suggest
that
it
must
be
part
grant
and
possibly
part
savings
.
it
be
conceivable
that
when
people
reach
a
certain
age
,
for
example
,
when
they
child
have
fly
the
nest
,
there
may
be
a
few
bob
in
the
credit
union
.
maybe
we
could
combine
a
grant
,
part
savings
and
part
loan
.
have
the
advisory
council
give
some
thought
to
this
?
so
do
I
.
that
be
a
big
range
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
attend
.
I
thank
the
witness

I
thank
the

I

I

I
thank
deputy
Jack
Chambers
for
share
time
with
I
.
I
will
set
out
a
preamble
before
ask
some
very
specific
question
.
very
few
of
we
think
about
climate
action
in
the
context
of
the
global
north
and
the
global
south
.
my
experience
as
a
former
minister
of
State
in
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
make
I
conscious
that
the
action
in
the
global
north
have
a
massive
effect
on
the
global
south
.
I
be
take
by
what
Professor
Sweeney
say
about
Ireland
's
contribution
to
the
Green
Climate
Fund
.
I
contend
,
however
,
that
Irish
Aid
,
through
its
partnership
with
the
key
partner
country
,
particularly
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
have
be
instrumental
and
a
key
driver
in
negotiate
the
financing
round
in
Addis
Ababa
,
lead
to
New
York
.
Ethiopia
have
be
a
key
international
player
in
driving
programme
such
as
the
productive
Safety
Net
Programme
,
which
offset
against
the
bad
ravage
of
climate
change
.
my
point
be
that
while
we
may
be
deem
to
be
climate
laggard
on
the
one
hand
,
we
seem
to
be
leader
on
the
other
in
ensure
there
be
protective
programme
for
the
global
south
,
with
which
we
have
key
relationship
.
I
would
like
Professor
Sweeney
's
perspective
on
this
.
perhaps
there
be
in
the
Irish
position
a
dichotomy
between
be
very
proactive
in
ensure
the
global
south
have
some
protection
and
be
way
behind
when
it
come
to
we
own
action
.
I
wish
to
defend
Ireland
's
position
on
the
global
south
and
seek
Professor
Sweeney
's
perspective
on
that
.
I
seek
that
perspective
before
ask
further
specific
question
.
I
seek
to
be
educate
on
the
article
6
rule
,
which
be
the
focus
of
the
suspend
cop
in
Chile
.
I
do
not
understand
the
so
-
call
accounting
mechanism
and
modality
for
a
new
form
of
international
integration
of
carbon
market
and
offset
to
ensure
carbon
market
can
support
country
in
enhance
the
ambition
of
they
state
climate
action
.
could
somebody
please
distil
that
for
I
and
the
people
I
represent
?
instinctively
,
I
believe
it
be
a
key
driver
but
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
witness
what
it
mean
in
layman
's
term
.
what
do
it
mean
for
Ireland
in
term
of
its
obligation
to
adhere
to
the
article
6
rule
?
have
anybody
write
a
paper
in
layman
's
term
,
for
digestion
by
that
who
be
not
well
verse
in
article
6
,
on
the
very
dynamic
Professor
Sweeney
be
talk
about
?
it
would
be
useful
for
this
committee
to
have
sight
of
view
and
interpretation
such
as
that
of
Professor
Sweeney
.
I
acknowledge
what
Ms
Higgins
,
Ms
Sharkey
and
Mr.
Coghlan
,
but
particularly
Mr.
Coghlan
,
be
say
about
engage
with
the
minister
on
the
point
raise
here
.
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
do
that
in
December
.
could
Professor
Sweeney
write
one
himself
?
we
be
now
in
private
session
.
we
be
now
in
private
session
.
we
be
now
in
private
session
.
we
be
now
in
private
session
.
we
have
have
much
to
contemplate
today
because
the
submission
from
each
of
the
constituent
party
here
have
be
very
think
-
provoke
.
I
will
start
with
Forest
industry
Ireland
.
I
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
submission
we
receive
because
if
I
interpret
it
correctly
,
there
be
a
very
clear
message
from
Forest
industry
Ireland
involve
a
reach
out
to
all
other
stakeholder
in
respect
of
a
vision
for
forestry
for
the
future
.
I
perceive
-
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
-
that
there
be
a
tension
between
the
forestry
industry
and
people
in
ngo
who
be
advocate
for
mix
use
,
great
use
of
broadleaf
species
and
mix
forest
,
and
there
be
a
ongoing
battle
involve
the
dread
conifer
and
so
on
.
be
I
interpret
Forest
industry
Ireland
's
statement
correctly
when
I
state
that
there
be
a
mood
within
Forest
industry
Ireland
that
wish
to
reach
out
to
that
ngo
and
a
broad
set
of
stakeholder
to
have
that
engagement
to
see
if
there
can
be
some
meeting
of
mind
regard
what
the
future
look
like
?
we
need
action
to
follow
the
statement
that
be
make
here
.
if
there
be
a
clear
offer
on
the
part
of
IBEC
,
Forest
industry
Ireland
,
FII
,
or
the
relevant
ngo
to
start
this
process
with
some
sort
of
summit
on
the
future
,
that
would
be
a
very
good
result
.
I
would
welcome
that
.
the
second
issue
concern
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
,
and
the
multi-annual
financial
framework
.
I
do
not
know
what
stage
it
have
reach
or
where
forestry
sit
in
that
.
farmer
be
arguably
farming
to
scheme
.
we
recognise
that
from
a
social
and
cultural
point
of
view
it
be
very
difficult
for
farmer
to
give
up
farming
livestock
if
they
have
be
do
so
for
three
or
four
generation
and
switch
to
afforestation
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
two
doctor
about
the
proportion
of
a
give
hold
that
be
give
over
to
forestry
.
be
there
scope
within
the
next
round
of
CAP
and
the
next
multi-annual
financial
framework
to
have
clear
scheme
and
financial
package
to
incentivise
climate
action
among
farmer
on
this
island
?
that
could
include
afforestation
or
biodiversity
measure
.
be
it
the
understanding
of
Mr.
Moore
or
Mr.
Hayes
that
the
CAP
be
move
in
the
direction
of
incentivise
climate
action
on
the
part
of
farmer
and
landowner
?
we
will
keep
we
answer
brief
.
where
be
CAP
at
the
moment
?
what
be
the
current
position
of
the
negotiation
?
I
refer
to
the
COFORD
Council
.
can
the
witness
disabuse
I
of
my
perception
that
the
COFORD
Council
be
nothing
but
a
talking
shop
and
that
no
real
policy
intervention
arise
from
it
?
can
they
disabuse
I
of
the
perception
that
if
the
COFORD
Council
be
work
properly
we
would
have
increase
forestry
cover
and
stakeholder
,
include
the
very
ngo
that
I
speak
about
previously
,
would
be
triage
the
issue
we
be
talk
about
today
to
a
much
great
degree
?
there
would
be
real
policy
outcome
,
real
delivery
of
climate
measure
and
the
potential
of
the
forestry
sector
would
be
realise
.
I
will
start
with
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
but
I
will
go
around
the
house
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
Coillte
after
that
.
could
I
hear
from
Coillte
on
that
?
I
know
that
organisation
be
a
stakeholder
.
in
my
remain
ten
second
I
would
like
to
ask
about
Coillte
's
six
regional
strategic
plan
.
my
understanding
be
that
under
the
climate
action
plan
Coillte
be
commit
to
replant
or
restock
a
total
of
34770
ha
between
2016
and
2020
.
be
that
effort
on
target
?
moreover
,
the
witness
mention
that
20
%
of
the
estate
be
manage
for
biodiversity
.
will
that
be
extend
across
that
34770
ha
?
I
thank
all
the
witness
for
come
before
we
this
afternoon
.

I
thank
all
the
witness
for
come
before
we
this
afternoon
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
afford
I
the
opportunity
to
join
the
committee
today
.
this
debate
have
be
really
useful
and
prove
to
be
a
very
useful
tutorial
for
somebody
such
as
myself
.
on
the
role
of
local
authority
,
in
the
wording
of
the
legislation
be
there
insufficient
direction
give
to
local
authority
on
the
interpretation
of
national
climate
action
plan
and
how
they
translate
at
the
most
local
level
into
adaptation
and
mitigation
measure
?
do
either
witness
have
a
view
on
the
role
of
local
authority
?
do
the
wording
need
to
be
buttress
or
tighten
up
?
I
see
a
role
for
local
authority
.
Transport
and
housing
be
two
key
element
of
take
carbon
out
of
the
equation
so
the
role
of
local
authority
would
be
important
.
slightly
tangential
to
that
be
the
role
of
public
participation
.
if
there
be
a
facility
for
local
authority
to
invite
member
of
the
public
to
make
submission
then
that
could
be
a
opportunity
for
the
citizen
to
engage
at
the
most
local
level
.
can
consideration
be
give
to
tighten
up
the
wording
?
do
the
witness
have
a
perspective
on
the
wording
?
we
have
a
climate
change
advisory
committee
and
there
be
the
committee
on
Climate
Change
in
the
UK
.
let
I
explain
the
way
I
look
at
the
Irish
committee
.
the
Professor
John
FitzGeralds
of
this
world
keep
we
honest
.
by
that
I
mean
,
when
they
talk
people
listen
because
they
do
not
have
a
"
political
"
agenda
.
to
what
extent
do
the
UK
House
of
Parliament
view
the
UK
Committee
on
Climate
Change
?
do
it
have
a
real
beneficial
impact
in
term
of
influence
policymaker
and
government
?
can
we
learn
form
the
UK
experience
?
can
we
translate
the
lesson
learn
into
a
legislative
text
here
that
give
great
weight
to
the
Irish
climate
change
advisory
committee
such
that
it
have
more
power
,
good
power
of
intervention
and
the
power
of
persuasion
?
my
question
be
more
philosophical
but
the
witness
might
have
perspective
on
they
.
finally
,
I
thank
both
of
the
witness
for
they
submission
to
the
committee
.
if
the
witness
can
send
in
they
observation
in
writing
regard
the
question
of
offset
,
we
would
welcome
that
.
we
will
resume
we
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
climate
Bill
tomorrow
morning
.
while
I
be
not
a
member
of
the
committee
,
I
appreciate
the
chairman
give
I
some
time
to
make
a
contribution
.
I
also
appreciate
the
attendance
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
will
start
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
last
comment
to
the
effect
that
the
government
of
the
day
have
accept
the
anti-fracking
legislation
.
it
be
pass
with
the
goodwill
of
the
Member
of
the
House
on
a
unanimous
basis
.
there
be
no
dissent
voice
.
if
one
take
the
view
that
fracking
,
by
its
very
nature
,
be
subject
to
licence
and
exploration
,
a
term
I
use
loosely
,
it
be
surely
the
case
that
the
same
concept
and
understanding
could
be
apply
to
exploration
offshore
.
be
that
not
the
case
?
that
be
my
first
question
.
the
principle
the
government
apply
in
deal
with
the
issue
of
fracking
and
its
support
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
state
,
for
anti-fracking
legislation
include
issue
related
to
climate
action
,
the
injurious
effect
on
the
environment
and
the
disturbance
cause
for
community
.
at
least
two
of
this
three
principle
can
be
apply
to
the
Bill
under
discussion
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
Minister
of
State
.
however
,
if
revenue
forgo
from
the
issue
of
licence
be
the
justification
for
require
a
money
message
to
prevent
the
Bill
from
proceed
to
the
next
stage
,
why
be
the
same
principle
not
apply
to
the
fracking
legislation
?
there
be
licence
.
why
be
the
same
principle
that
be
apply
to
the
anti-fracking
legislation
not
be
apply
to
this
Bill
if
the
government
of
the
day
have
,
in
fact
,
issue
the
licence
in
the
first
instance
?
I
be
not
sure
I
accept
that
answer
which
warrant
further
exploration
.
however
,
I
realise
we
do
not
have
a
great
deal
of
time
.
my
second
question
be
related
to
the
process
of
examine
what
define
a
money
message
for
the
purpose
of
allow
a
Bill
to
proceed
to
the
next
stage
.
I
do
not
intend
to
get
into
a
interpretation
of
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
ruling
,
except
to
say
there
be
a
memorandum
of
understanding
between
all
Member
of
the
House
and
the
government
of
the
day
on
private
Member
's
bill
.
it
be
arguable
that
the
government
have
contraven
the
spirit
of
that
memorandum
of
understanding
and
it
be
arguable
that
it
have
be
disrespectful
to
the
individual
Member
of
this
House
who
have
bring
forward
legislation
.
what
be
the
process
,
in
the
simple
term
?
I
do
not
understand
what
the
Minister
of
State
need
to
do
to
define
this
for
the
purpose
of
justify
the
government
's
argument
on
what
need
to
be
do
to
deliver
or
not
on
the
money
message
.
what
do
the
minister
of
State
need
to
do
to
justify
he
position
with
regard
to
the
requirement
for
a
money
message
?
the
Ceann
Comhairle
have
determine
that
a
money
message
be
require
.
that
be
my
understanding
.
for
a
money
message
to
be
deliver
on
,
it
be
not
the
Ceann
Comhairle
who
will
go
and
do
that
business
but
the
government
.
what
need
to
be
do
to
deliver
the
money
message
or
not
deliver
it
,
depend
on
the
Minister
of
State
's
justification
?
I
suspect
the
government
have
already
make
its
decision
and
be
seek
now
to
quash
this
legislation
.
what
do
that
mean
?
I
appreciate
that
but
the
question
be
how
the
government
make
that
determination
.
what
criterion
do
the
government
use
in
make
that
decision
?
do
it
look
at
the
opportunity
cost
forgo
in
respect
of
licence
?
what
be
the
process
?
if
I
introduce
legislation
about
health
or
education
and
I
be
tell
that
it
require
a
money
message
because
there
be
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
,
whether
a
first
order
charge
or
a
incidental
charge
,
if
I
be
the
proposer
of
the
legislation
,
surely
I
be
entitled
to
know
exactly
what
the
government
intend
to
do
with
the
legislation
that
I
have
draft
,
as
per
deputy
Smith
's
contention
,
and
how
the
government
intend
to
deliver
the
money
message
?
what
be
the
process
and
mechanism
that
the
government
must
now
follow
to
decide
on
a
money
message
?
if
that
question
cannot
be
answer
,
then
I
would
contend
that
there
have
be
a
subversion
of
the
democratic
process
here
.
I
ask
for
a
further
articulation
of
that
to
be
give
to
this
committee
with
regard
to
what
exactly
that
mean
.
it
would
be
useful
for
I
as
a
member
of
this
House
to
understand
that
process
,
which
I
do
not
understand
.
that
be
fair
enough
.
I
understand
that
a
reasoned
opinion
and
justification
would
be
give
.
I
be
seek
to
understand
,
within
the
Minister
of
State
's
line
Department
,
the
criterion
when
the
Secretary
General
or
assistant
secretary
general
and
principal
officer
sit
down
to
go
through
this
process
.
we
must
now
report
to
the
dáil
on
we
decision
about
the
delivery
of
a
money
message
.
what
be
the
criterion
about
the
decision
on
the
delivery
of
a
money
message
?
what
criterion
be
we
set
out
internally
for
the
justification
of
we
position
,
regardless
of
what
that
be
?
I
do
not
expect
the
Minister
of
State
to
answer
that
now
.
that
be
not
what
I
be
say
.
this
be
my
final
intervention
.
I
thank
the
chair
and
deputy
Bríd
Smith
.
it
be
worthwhile
,
because
we
have
a
minister
of
State
in
front
of
we
,
to
question
the
Minister
of
State
in
respect
of
the
internal
dynamic
of
the
process
of
examine
the
money
message
procedure
from
he
Department
's
point
of
view
.
the
Ceann
Comhairle
have
write
on
this
.
the
Department
must
now
respond
.
the
Department
.
may
I
make
a
final
intervention
?
the
point
be
make
early
that
this
should
not
be
catch
up
as
a
geopolitical
issue
.
I
contend
that
it
be
a
geopolitical
issue
.
organisation
such
as
Trócaire
be
advocate
on
behalf
of
this
legislation
.
it
be
a
organisation
that
be
fund
from
the
public
purse
,
which
seek
to
bridge
the
divide
between
the
global
north
and
the
global
south
.
it
seek
to
advocate
on
issue
such
as
the
Paris
agreement
and
the
sustainable
development
goal
and
in
respect
of
how
the
global
north
do
its
business
and
how
that
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
poor
people
live
on
the
planet
.
I
suggest
that
this
legislation
be
germane
to
this
very
issue
and
that
be
a
point
I
want
to
address
with
regard
to
Senator
O'Reilly
's
early
point
.
it
be
very
germane
to
a
geopolitical
context
.

I
be
the
last
person
stand
and
many
of
my
question
have
be
answer
so
I
will
not
detain
the
witness
or
the
chairman
.
I
thank
the
delegation
as
this
have
be
a
very
clear
-
head
and
lucid
presentation
that
have
go
a
long
way
towards
help
my
understanding
of
the
matter
,
and
particularly
the
timeline
.
it
be
a
very
good
idea
to
give
we
the
timeline
in
respect
of
the
company
's
involvement
with
the
national
broadband
plan
.
there
be
a
very
clear
message
from
the
witness
that
it
be
two
year
ago
and
they
be
talk
about
the
future
.
it
be
a
very
unambiguous
message
.
have
say
that
,
I
might
detain
the
witness
a
while
long
to
help
my
understanding
of
the
engagement
with
the
Department
up
to
the
point
in
September
2017
when
SIRO
withdraw
from
the
process
.
I
be
try
to
imagine
myself
in
the
room
where
SIRO
be
engage
with
the
Department
after
the
mapping
exercise
have
be
do
and
there
be
a
revise
intervention
area
.
how
do
it
come
about
that
the
company
decide
it
be
out
and
finish
with
the
process
?
be
it
because
,
as
the
witness
state
early
,
the
revenue
reduction
be
such
that
it
would
just
make
it
untenable
?
be
there
any
profit
or
return
on
investment
where
it
could
be
say
that
even
with
the
542000
premise
in
the
amber
area
,
the
company
could
still
persevere
with
the
process
?
I
may
not
be
put
it
across
very
clearly
but
what
would
it
have
take
for
SIRO
to
have
stay
in
the
game
?
that
be
the
kernel
of
my
question
.
Mr.
O'Leary
have
state
"
it
would
also
have
lead
to
a
much
big
reduction
in
revenue
and
thus
we
overall
potential
target
revenue
be
significantly
reduce
also
"
.
he
also
outline
the
Mitchelstown
example
,
which
be
fairly
close
to
home
for
I
,
and
the
doughnut
effect
.
at
what
point
do
the
company
say
"
that
be
it
,
we
be
gone
"
.
there
be
engagement
and
the
witness
have
say
it
be
a
positive
engagement
with
the
Department
.
the
company
have
just
see
300000
connection
be
take
up
by
another
entity
so
what
would
it
have
make
this
commercially
viable
for
the
company
?
I
still
cannot
fully
grapple
that
.
personally
,
I
find
it
a
pity
that
SIRO
pull
out
because
of
its
international
reputation
,
which
be
mention
early
,
and
the
ability
to
get
project
do
in
a
very
seamless
and
quick
fashion
.
that
be
why
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
disappointment
.
that
be
what
I
cannot
understand
.
what
I
cannot
reconcile
be
that
there
be
a
de
facto
change
in
the
process
.
the
tender
process
be
design
to
deliver
x
number
but
the
number
change
.
they
be
reduce
because
of
the
action
of
another
entity
.
I
would
have
think
there
be
a
clear
justification
for
all
bidder
to
sit
down
at
that
juncture
with
the
Department
and
say
that
the
process
have
change
.
the
term
of
the
other
party
may
have
be
reasonable
because
of
that
material
change
.
I
cannot
reconcile
the
justification
of
the
Department
in
say
that
party
be
in
the
middle
of
a
tender
process
and
there
be
restriction
in
what
can
be
say
,
etc
.
I
will
refer
to
the
current
roll
-
out
of
service
from
SIRO
.
there
be
242000
home
pass
and
by
virtue
of
this
,
there
be
potential
for
they
to
be
enable
.
the
company
have
make
42000
connection
to
customer
.
be
there
a
metric
of
cost
per
house
?
that
be
fine
.
I
can
appreciate
that
it
might
be
commercially
sensitive
.
the
company
's
aim
be
450000
connection
.
I
have
absolutely
internalise
that
as
Mr.
O'Leary
say
it
in
early
intervention
.
if
my
constituent
be
supposedly
encapsulate
within
the
300000
connection
to
be
provide
by
Eir
but
be
in
the
last
house
on
the
link
and
be
wait
for
month
on
end
or
put
on
the
never
-
never
,
be
there
potential
for
he
or
she
to
be
include
in
the
450000
connection
that
SIRO
envisage
?
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
O'Leary
and
Mr.
Mahon
for
come
before
we
and
be
so
open
in
they
answer
of
question

we
appreciate
the
fact
that
they

now

I
welcome
this
meeting
and
the
witness
come
before
we
.
starting
with
the
individual
family
support
plan
,
I
have
a
parliamentary
question
on
this
issue
answer
by
Mr.
O'Regan
.
it
be
date
24
May
2022
.
in
that
question
,
I
ask
the
Minister
of
Health
the
number
of
individualised
family
service
plan
issue
and
accept
by
each
cdnt
,
break
down
by
CHO
area
.
the
response
I
get
be
that
the
individual
family
support
plan
process
be
a
live
one
,
in
that
the
team
and
family
keep
it
under
review
while
service
support
and
strategy
be
be
implement
and
as
the
need
and
achievement
of
the
child
and
family
change
.
be
the
output
of
the
individual
family
support
plan
be
measure
as
this
process
be
be
roll
out
?
where
I
be
go
with
this
question
be
towards
try
to
get
at
the
experience
of
the
family
that
interface
with
the
service
.
on
this
same
issue
,
we
have
now
create
another
bolt
-
on
aspect
to
the
experience
of
the
family
and
the
child
.
the
experience
of
family
of
which
I
be
aware
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
reflect
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
service
.
family
be
afraid
that
they
be
be
send
down
yet
another
road
and
to
another
service
that
they
must
sign
up
to
get
access
to
service
.
I
be
not
go
to
be
rhetorical
.
I
just
ask
the
HSE
to
be
mindful
of
this
point
and
if
it
can
do
that
,
it
would
be
good
.
we
know
what
the
experience
of
family
be
.
we
all
know
they
be
jaded
now
.
let
we
take
that
as
a
give
.
we
all
accept
that
.
if
I
dovetail
the
individual
family
support
plan
process
now
with
the
creation
of
the
cDNT
,
then
this
be
again
about
measurement
.
turn
to
Ms
O'Neill
,
another
parliamentary
question
I
submit
ask
"
the
number
of
child
that
have
be
transfer
from
Children
's
Disability
Network
Team
back
to
primary
care
on
foot
of
assessment
since
April
2021
,
by
age
,
CHO
and
LHO
in
tabular
form
and
general
categorisation
for
such
a
transfer
back
to
primary
care
operation
"
.
Ms
O'Neill
's
response
to
I
state
,
"
though
there
be
no
specific
timeline
on
when
the
system
will
be
available
,
I
can
confirm
that
there
have
be
a
procurement
process
and
the
system
be
now
at
the
development
stage
.
"
again
,
we
do
not
have
a
live
measurement
of
the
family
's
experience
as
they
be
go
through
the
system
.
they
be
again
be
ask
to
sign
up
to
a
cdnt
process
and
they
be
wonder
how
many
more
arguably
bureaucratic
process
they
will
have
to
go
through
before
they
can
get
access
to
the
speech
and
language
therapist
,
SLT
,
the
occupational
therapist
,
OT
,
the
psychologist
and
all
the
therapy
service
.
do
the
witness
appreciate
where
I
be
come
from
in
this
regard
?
we
must
ensure
that
parent
and
child
be
minded
in
this
context
.
the
bottom
line
in
all
of
this
be
still
access
to
the
service
,
notwithstand
all
the
issue
we
be
talk
about
here
concern
recruitment
,
which
be
,
effectively
,
the
big
elephant
in
the
room
.
I
just
want
to
hear
from
witness
from
the
HSE
that
they
be
go
to
be
careful
and
mindful
of
family
in
this
process
.
I
be
happy
for
Ms
O'Neill
to
answer
because
she
reply
with
the
letter
respond
to
my
parliamentary
question
.
I
will
keep
move
on
because
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
do
we
know
how
many
therapist
,
by
they
designation
as
SLT
and
ot
,
have
leave
the
cDNT
since
January
2022
?
if
we
know
the
answer
to
that
question
,
do
we
know
if
that
people
have
be
replace
?
what
be
the
status
of
the
individual
file
?
I
ask
this
because
,
again
,
we
have
the
child
interface
with
a
service
,
and
he
or
she
have
already
start
to
do
so
in
this
case
.
one
person
who
be
a
part
of
deliver
that
service
then
leave
,
for
all
sort
of
appropriate
reason
,
and
,
suddenly
,
that
child
and
the
family
be
leave
in
limbo
.
they
do
not
know
where
they
stand
.
I
will
ask
my
fourth
question
and
then
I
will
be
do
.
can
I
ask
my
final
question
?
my
last
question
concern
the
section
39
organisation
.
if
I
be
read
Mr.
Reid
and
the
Minister
of
State
correctly
concern
the
need
to
address
the
imbalance
here
on
the
pay
parity
side
,
there
be
a
responsibility
,
and
I
say
this
respectfully
,
on
the
government
to
engage
with
the
trade
union
and
the
representative
of
employee
to
address
this
subject
.
I
say
this
because
,
and
the
Co-Chair
will
attest
to
this
,
we
have
a
facility
in
north
County
Cork
,
namely
,
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
locate
at
Cooleens
House
,
and
every
time
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
-
and
there
be
a
plethora
of
they
now
-
the
response
I
get
back
refer
to
the
problem
of
recruitment
and
be
unable
to
recruit
.
my
fear
be
that
what
have
happen
be
that
people
have
move
over
from
one
service
to
another
,
because
,
whether
people
like
it
or
not
,
there
be
this
perception
that
there
be
this
type
of
Darwinian
system
where
the
HSE
have
recruit
and
take
on
people
from
section
38
and
39
organisation
because
of
good
term
and
condition
.
if
we
do
not
address
this
aspect
,
we
will
be
at
nothing
.
chairman
,
my
question
be
not
answer
.
I
refer
to
the
specific
question
I
have
about
what
happen
in
a
cdnt
when
somebody
leave
and
there
be
a
live
file
.
what
happen
to
the
file
?
what
be
the
legitimate
expectation
of
the
child
and
he
or
she
family
in
respect
of
that
file
?
I
need
a
answer
to
that
question
because
I
have
case
where
that
have
happen
.
the
second
point
I
make
that
be
not
address
be
pay
inequality
.
Mr.
Reid
say
he
meet
with
the
section
39
organisation
,
I
think
he
say
specifically
.
I
would
like
to
know
what
the
nature
of
that
discussion
be
and
whether
the
issue
of
pay
parity
and
equality
of
pay
come
up
.
there
be
a
elephant
in
the
room
here
.
I
reference
St.
Joseph's
Foundation
but
it
be
one
of
many
service
provider
where
the
same
thing
be
happen
,
namely
,
they
cannot
open
service
and
they
remain
close
because
the
provider
cannot
recruit
.
I
be
be
tell
they
cannot
because
they
be
compete
with
the
HSE
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
Mr.
Reid
about
how
the
HSE
intend
to
grasp
the
nettle
on
that
one
and
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
then
as
far
as
ensure
we
have
parity
be
concerned
.
deputy
Tully
be
here
early
and
open
up
with
that
very
point
.
we
need
to
address
that
point
.
I
would
like
some
response
from
-----
what
about
my
question
on
the
file
?
I
be
not
go
to
let
that
one
go
.
we
be
way
over
time
,
but
the
importance
of
this
meeting
justify
that
.
I
thank
the
delegation
from
the
HSE
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
official
from
the
Department
for
be
here
.
this
have
be
a
joint
meeting
aim
at
try
to
address
the
issue
under
discussion
.
it
be
important
that
it
have
be
accept
here
this
morning
there
be
failure
in
respect
of
child
right
across
the
spectrum
.
when
I
take
the
job
of
chair
of
my
committee
,
I
state
that
the
Taoiseach
would
go
before
the
House
to
apologise
for
the
way
the
State
have
treat
child
with
disability
.
that
be
evident
from
the
meeting
.
a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what
need
to
be
do
.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
question
I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE
versus
the
Department
of
Health
discussion
as
to
what
legislation
need
to
be
change
and
what
need
to
be
do
.
from
the
way
the
meeting
have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as
regards
the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent
day
where
,
in
the
past
two
or
three
week
,
people
who
have
be
on
temporary
contract
with
the
HSE
or
with
one
of
the
service
provider
have
not
have
they
contract
renew
.
they
have
have
to
proceed
somewhere
else
to
get
a
permanent
contract
because
they
be
look
to
purchase
house
or
to
do
the
normal
day
-
to
-
day
living
thing
.
that
have
leave
vacancy
within
the
service
for
people
with
disability
,
whether
that
be
in
respite
,
in
the
HSE
or
in
section
38
or
39
organisation
.
as
everybody
here
have
accept
,
there
be
a
shortage
of
staff
within
all
of
the
service
.
we
have
see
in
the
past
week
or
two
that
people
have
have
to
leave
the
service
because
the
State
have
not
do
its
business
in
ensure
that
staff
member
be
retain
.
we
have
hear
it
from
different
area
that
there
have
be
a
brain
drain
.
we
have
people
here
who
have
give
they
time
to
care
,
who
understand
people
with
disability
,
who
care
passionately
about
they
and
about
improve
they
life
,
and
we
need
to
ensure
we
be
keep
that
people
within
the
service
.
the
section
38
and
39
organisation
and
the
parity
of
esteem
in
pay
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
deal
with
because
every
logjam
must
be
remove
to
ensure
we
keep
all
the
good
people
in
the
service
.
I
make
the
point
in
the
dáil
yesterday
in
another
debate
that
the
recruitment
drive
have
to
involve
a
overseas
element
as
well
.
on
the
point
that
be
make
in
respect
of
the
high
education
minister
,
we
need
to
have
everybody
work
on
board
here
.
the
State
,
the
HSE
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
we
committee
here
need
to
accept
that
,
while
this
morning
's
meeting
be
a
very
thorough
meeting
,
from
here
on
we
have
to
try
to
ensure
we
be
do
something
meaningful
to
change
this
.
we
would
hope
,
if
they
schedule
allow
it
,
to
have
both
the
Department
and
the
HSE
back
here
in
the
autumn
to
review
this
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
the
member
today
be
be
address
and
that
the
family
,
the
child
,
the
life
and
the
live
experience
of
people
with
disability
who
have
be
fail
by
the
State
improve
from
here
on
in
.
that
be
what
we
committee
and
everybody
here
be
charge
with
,
and
we
hope
to
do
that
.
I
thank
sincerely
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
for
she
dedication
to
the
job
,
the
HSE
and
the
official
present

we
own
team
here
,
all
the
member
of
the
two
joint
committee
,
and
deputy
Funchion
for

I
to

the
meeting
with
they

I
state
that

.
that
be
evident
from

.
a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what
need
to
be
do
.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
question
I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE
versus
the
Department
of
Health
discussion
as
to
what
legislation
need
to
be
change
and
what

do
.
from
the
way
the

have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as
regards
the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent

where
,
in
the

two

three
week
,
people
who

or
with
one
of
the

provider
have
not
have
they

they
have
have
to
proceed
somewhere
else
to
get
a
permanent

because
they
be
look
to

or
to
do
the

.
that
have
leave

whether

,
in

or

.
as
everybody
here
have

,
there
be
a

we
have
hear

own

joint

,
and
deputy
Funchion
for
allow
I
to
chair
the
meeting
with
they
.
we
be
way
over
time
,
but
the
importance
of
this
meeting
justify
that
.
I
thank
the
delegation
from
the
HSE
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
official
from
the
Department
for
be
here
.
this
have
be
a
joint
meeting
aim
at
try
to
address
the
issue
under
discussion
.
it
be
important
that
it
have
be
accept
here
this
morning
there
be
failure
in
respect
of
child
right
across
the
spectrum
.
when
I
take
the
job
of
chair
of
my
committee
,
I
state
that
the
Taoiseach
would
go
before
the
House
to
apologise
for
the
way
the
State
have
treat
child
with
disability
.
that
be
evident
from
the
meeting
.
a
number
of
theme
have
arise
on
what
need
to
be
do
.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
question
I
think
there
might
have
be
a
HSE
versus
the
Department
of
Health
discussion
as
to
what
legislation
need
to
be
change
and
what
need
to
be
do
.
from
the
way
the
meeting
have
go
,
however
,
it
be
clear
the
recruitment
drive
need
to
be
make
to
ensure
,
as
regards
the
team
that
be
be
propose
,
that
we
have
the
recruitment
of
full
team
and
the
retention
of
staff
.
I
look
at
anecdotal
evidence
that
we
have
receive
over
recent
day
where
,
in
the
past
two
or
three
week
,
people
who
have
be
on
temporary
contract
with
the
HSE
or
with
one
of
the
service
provider
have
not
have
they
contract
renew
.
they
have
have
to
proceed
somewhere
else
to
get
a
permanent
contract
because
they
be
look
to
purchase
house
or
to
do
the
normal
day
-
to
-
day
living
thing
.
that
have
leave
vacancy
within
the
service
for
people
with
disability
,
whether
that
be
in
respite
,
in
the
HSE
or
in
section
38
or
39
organisation
.
as
everybody
here
have
accept
,
there
be
a
shortage
of
staff
within
all
of
the
service
.
we
have
see
in
the
past
week
or
two
that
people
have
have
to
leave
the
service
because
the
State
have
not
do
its
business
in
ensure
that
staff
member
be
retain
.
we
have
hear
it
from
different
area
that
there
have
be
a
brain
drain
.
we
have
people
here
who
have
give
they
time
to
care
,
who
understand
people
with
disability
,
who
care
passionately
about
they
and
about
improve
they
life
,
and
we
need
to
ensure
we
be
keep
that
people
within
the
service
.
the
section
38
and
39
organisation
and
the
parity
of
esteem
in
pay
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
deal
with
because
every
logjam
must
be
remove
to
ensure
we
keep
all
the
good
people
in
the
service
.
I
make
the
point
in
the
dáil
yesterday
in
another
debate
that
the
recruitment
drive
have
to
involve
a
overseas
element
as
well
.
on
the
point
that
be
make
in
respect
of
the
high
education
minister
,
we
need
to
have
everybody
work
on

here
.
the
State
,
the
HSE
,
the
Department
of

and
we
committee
here
need
to
accept
that
,

Rabbitte

for

the

the
official
present

we
own
team
here
,
all
the
member
of
the
two
joint
committee
,
and
deputy
Funchion
for
allow
I
to
chair
the
meeting
with
they
.
I
have
to
leave
a
meeting
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
to
get
here
so
I
do
not
know
if
that
will
clash
.
I
be
not
sure
if
I
be
in
order
propose
that
which
I
be
about
to
propose
.
the
role
of
ComReg
in
broadband
could
be
examine
.
when
I
table
a
question
to
the
minister
with
regard
to
a
specific
location
I
be
tell
that
it
be
a
operational
matter
for
the
various
service
provider
.
give
that
it
be
government
policy
to
roll
out
broadband
and
achieve
maximum
penetration
,
do
ComReg
have
a
role
and
where
do
it
lie
in
respect
of
this
committee
?
we
will
go
through
each
of
the
regulator
to
regulate
the
way
in
which
the
regulator
regulate
.
we
can
examine
how
the
regulator
do
they
job
and
the
regulator
can
make
recommendation
for
change
.
we
be
in
a
new
era
of
regulation
and
several
regulator
have
not
be
in
the
job
for
long
.
this
be
a
opportune
juncture
to
examine
how
they
perform
.
I
be
mindful
of
the
plethora
of
quango
which
have
spring
up
in
recent
year
.
a
key
role
of
this
committee
will
be
to
pull
it
all
back
and
ensure
body
be

do

I
be
happy
,
if
the
chairman
so
wish
,
to
allow
Mr.
Doherty
to
field
this
wide
range
question
at
this
stage
.
I
would
come
in
late
if
that
be
all
right
?
I
will
be
brief
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
for
they
presentation
.
I
be
probably
typical
of
most
people
in
not
be
a
technophile
,
although
neither
be
I
a
technophobe
.
I
have
a
BlackBerry
and
access
to
all
the
communication
I
need
,
which
I
be
fortunate
that
my
position
in
this
House
allow
but
which
be
not
typical
of
everybody
.
there
be
a
glaring
disparity
between
that
who
will
eventually
be
able
to
avail
of
the
next
generation
network
and
other
,
many
of
whom
I
represent
in
a
mix
urban
and
rural
constituency
,
who
must
still
dial
up
to
gain
access
to
broadband
.
if
ComReg
's
modus
operandi
be
one
which
seek
to
protect
the
consumer
,
it
be
incumbent
on
I
to
ask
why
there
be
people
in
rural
area
who
do
not
have
access
to
broadband
.
how
soon
can
they
expect
access
to
it
?
give
the
glaring
disparity
between
that
who
can
avail
of
next
generation
network
and
that
who
be
still
diall
up
,
question
have
to
be
ask
of
somebody
.
be
this
a
result
of
government
policy
?
if
I
ask
the
minister
a
question
on
the
rate
of
penetration
in
respect
of
broadband
roll
-
out
,
I
be
tell
it
be
a
matter
for
the
individual
company
involve
and
a
commercial
consideration
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
do
ComReg
have
any
competence
in
that
regard
?
can
it
put
its
boot
up
a
company
's
proverbial
backside
to
force
it
to
roll
out
broadband
?
my
other
question
relate
to
the
situation
involve
a
typical
person
live
in
a
rural
area
of
County
Cork
when
a
application
for
the
erection
of
a
mast
be
suddenly
make
to
the
county
council
,
whose
policy
of
co-location
mean
that
three
mast
can
be
erect
in
one
area
.
that
be
of
great
concern
to
people
in
the
community
who
be
powerless
to
do
anything
about
the
matter
.
can
ComReg
assess
the
level
of
radiation
in
the
area
to
allay
they
fear
?
do
it
have
the
power
to
ensure
the
policy
of
co-location
espouse
by
the
county
development
plan
of
a
local
authority
can
be
override
?
what
redress
do
a
individual
have
if
he
or
she
have
legitimate
concern
about
that
policy
?
my
next
question
relate
to
the
postal
sector
.
we
be
all
familiar
with
the
Bolkestein
directive
on
the
liberalisation
of
postal
service
and
the
stormy
passage
it
enjoy
.
liberalisation
of
postal
service
have
be
on
the
card
for
a
considerable
time
.
concern
have
be
express
to
I
on
the
question
of
whether
it
can
be
guarantee
that
there
will
be
a
universal
service
obligation
.
if
somebody
live
in
a
remote
rural
area
,
do
he
or
she
have
the
same
rights
to
a
postal
service
as
somebody
live
in
a
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
or
Mitchelstown
?
will
ComReg
have
a
substantive
role
in
ensure
this
?
I
understand
there
be
provision
for
a
certain
amount
of
radio
spectrum
or
bandwidth
to
be
give
over
to
religious
or
community
organisation
.
I
refer
to
WPAs
but
as
I
do
not
even
know
what
they
be
,
the
commissioner
must
forgive
I
.
I
be
not
,
as
I
say
,
the
most
technically
minded
.
what
have
be
the
take
-
up
of
that
facility
?
what
be
the
percentage
of
broadband
penetration
in
the
country
as
a
whole
?
effectively
,
the
group
broadband
scheme
be
do
away
with
.
the
swra
which
operate
the
scheme
in
my
constituency
be
make
great
progress
in
this
regard
.
however
,
it
be
to
be
replace
by
the
national
broadband
scheme
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
criterion
govern
eligibility
for
the
provision
of
broadband
have
change
.
where
it
be
deem
there
be
a
service
provider
in
a
particular
area
,
no
other
person
may
apply
to
provide
a
service
.
while
part
of
north
Cork
be
service
by
a
service
provider
,
more
rural
part
of
the
county
do
not
fall
within
its
remit
.
arguably
,
people
will
be
leave
behind
,
despite
the
introduction
of
the
new
scheme
.
I
wonder
if
ComReg
have
a
role
in
this
regard
and
hope
my
point
be
clear
.
how
do
the
problem
arise
?
be
a
broadcast
of
mass
interfere
with
aviation
signal
?
be
it
be
broadcast
on
local
channel
?

I
welcome
Mr.
Guiomard
's
informative
contribution
.
the
aviation
industry
face
major
challenge
.
the
commissioner
refer
to
a
reassessment
of
current
regulatory
structure
.
will
he
flesh
out
this
comment
?
I
have
a
particular
interest
in
the
regional
imbalance
.
Dublin
Airport
be
increasingly
become
a
bottleneck
and
one
have
little
joy
in
use
the
facility
.
there
appear
to
be
a
perceptible
diminution
in
the
role
of
Cork
and
Shannon
airport
which
have
lose
slot
or
have
certain
slot
change
.
do
the
commission
for
Aviation
Regulation
have
a
role
to
play
in
address
this
imbalance
or
at
least
in
seek
to
encourage
the
use
of
slot
beyond
Dublin
Airport
and
in
the
region
?
I
be
surprised
,
give
the
number
of
passenger
who
use
Irish
airport
annually
,
that
only
two
people
deal
with
the
rights
of
passenger
,
although
I
be
open
to
correction
on
this
.
we
have
all
subscribe
in
we
habit
to
the
low
cost
airline
culture
in
that
we
engage
in
a
contract
with
a
low
cost
airline
and
be
at
its
mercy
and
whim
.
one
pay
one
fee
,
board
the
flight
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
.
be
there
a
case
for
increase
the
rights
of
passenger
?
do
the
current
regime
give
proper
and
due
recognition
to
the
rights
of
passenger
when
delay
occur
or
in
term
of
baggage
charge
and
the
application
of
more
stringent
rule
by
all
airline
?
do
the
commission
have
a
role
in
this
regard
?
should
the
joint
committee
make
a
case
to
the
power
that
be
,
namely
,
the
minister
,
that
increase
funding
should
be
make
available
to
employ
more
personnel
to
deal
with
the
rights
of
passenger
?
on
slot
,
while
it
be
important
to
protect
the
national
interest
,
if
we
all
subscribe
to
a
market
philosophy
,
airline
will
find
they
own
market
.
as
a
island
nation
,
however
,
can
a
case
be
make
for
protect
certain
slot
?
the
loss
of
the
Aer
Lingus
slot
at
Shannon
Airport
recently
be
a
debacle
.
give
that
London
be
a
major
hub
and
the
Shannon
region
be
a
major
economic
hub
,
one
could
argue
that
the
change
of
the
slot
result
in
a
serious
loss
of
comparative
advantage
for
the
region
.
do
the
commission
have
a
role
in
the
context
of
we
pursuit
of
a
balance
regional
economic
policy
aim
at
prevent
all
investment
go
to
the
Pale
?
the
Jacob
's
report
publish
in
2006
analyse
the
capacity
.
be
a
different
picture
emerge
for
Dublin
?
be
the
commissioner
satisfied
that
project
capacity
be
adequate
for
five
or
ten
year
hence
?
I
do
not
have
a
economic
analysis
to
hand
but
common
sense
suggest
that
airline
traffic
will
grow
unbelievably
.
will
the
commissioner
seek
a
further
expansion
?
I
appreciate
the
commissioner
's
remark
about
he
responsibility
in
respect
of
regional
policy
,
but
people
will
ask
this
question
.
the
commissioner
's
staff
of
21
,
with
four
economist
and
two
legal
people
,
seem
minuscule
give
the
size
and
volume
of
the
industry
and
that
we
live
in
a
litigious
environment
.
will
the
commissioner
elaborate
a
little
on
the
nature
of
the
litigation
?
could
it
be
argue
that
the
aviation
regulator
will
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
and
resource
,
unfairly
perhaps
,
stave
off
challenge
from
various
airline
and
that
the
government
must
consider
this
in
respect
of
funding
?
I
thank
the
chairman
for
allow
I
to
speak
again
.
I
be
learn
as
I
go
.
when
company
be
litigious
the
regulator
have
to
use
resource
on
go
into
court
every
other
day
,
which
be
a
cost
burden
.
it
affect
how
one
defend
the
rights
of
passenger
.
it
diminish
the
commission
's
role
in
defend
passenger
because
it
cannot
expend
resource
in
that
regard
.
in
its
submission
the
commission
refer
to
alternative
arrangement
which
would
have
the
impact
of
a
judicial
judgment
but
in
a
non-judicial
setting
.
what
role
be
envisage
for
legislator
in
that
regard
?
I
be
tired
of
read
newspaper
headline
of
airline
take
challenge
every
other
day
of
the
week
.
I
wonder
if
it
really
be
for
the
common
good
.
I
can
understand
a
company
try
to
protect
a
competitive
advantage
which
be
sound
economics
,
but
we
must
be
cognisant
of
the
rights
of
passenger
.
I
thank
the
Commissioner
for
Aviation
Regulation
,
Mr.
Spicer
and
Mr.
Baker
for
come
and
compliment
they
on
the
work
they
be

often
we
hear
complaint
as
regards
different
group
be
involve
in
the
regulation
of
certain
sector
and
the
fact
that
such
body
be
nearly
out
of

.
however
,
the
Office
of
the
Commissioner
for
Aviation
Regulation
appear
to
be
run
a
tight

and
be

committee
.
I
welcome
the
taxi
regulator
and
she
colleague
.
most
of
the
point
I
wish
to
make
have
be
cover
.
there
have
be
a
tangible
improvement
in
the
level
of
service
,
particularly
in
large
urban
area
such
as
Cork
city
and
Dublin
.
it
be
easy
to
get
a
taxi
,
day
or
night
,
than
it
be
heretofore
.
the
regulator
have
be
instrumental
in
bring
that
about
.
I
come
from
Mallow
,
north
Cork
and
licence
there
use
to
be
issue
by
the
local
authority
,
which
give
a
element
of
control
.
now
,
we
see
the
local
authority
no
long
have
that
power
,
which
be
vested
in
the
regulator
,
and
there
be
no
interaction
between
the
local
authority
and
the
regulator
in
term
of
provision
of
space
.
in
Mallow
,
which
be
typical
of
many
town
,
more
and
more
licence
be
be
issue
but
the
main
street
or
the
taxi
rank
cannot
cope
.
have
there
be
consultation
?
the
regulator
's
submission
refer
to
consultation
with
the
local
authority
but
have
there
be
consultation
specifically
with
regard
to
the
provision
of
taxi
space
?
there
be
currently
47
taxi
licence
in
Mallow
and
the
town
do
not
have
the
space
to
cope
with
this
.
I
differ
from
my
colleague
from
the
Green
Party
regard
the
nine
-
year
vehicle
standard
rule
.
the
German
case
be
different
in
that
there
be
a
German
brand
,
the
Mercedes
-
Benz
,
in
which
there
be
national
pride
.
it
be
much
easy
to
impose
a
certain
type
of
car
or
colour
in
that
scenario
.
I
would
argue
that
as
long
as
a
vehicle
be
up
to
certain
standard
in
respect
of
cleanliness
and
its
operation
,
I
do
not
see
why
it
cannot
be
use
as
a
public
service
vehicle
.
I
differ
in
this
regard
.
give
that
it
be
he
or
she
business
,
a
taxi
driver
who
have
the
wherewithal
to
invest
money
in
a
licence
should
have
a
certain
degree
of
autonomy
as
to
the
vehicle
that
he
or
she
could
choose
to
use
.
I
seek
clarification
as
to
whether
it
be
envisage
that
a
standard
would
be
impose
whereby
any
vehicle
that
be
more
than
nine
year
old
could
not
be
use
.
while
I
may
be
wrong
in
this
regard
,
I
would
be
vehemently
oppose
to
such
a
proposal
.
many
vehicle
,
such
as
the
aforementioned
famous
German
marque
,
will
go
on
for
ten
,
15
or
20
year
and
can
be
operate
as
effectively
as
any
two
or
three
year
old
car
as
long
as
they
receive
proper
maintenance
.
at
present
,
people
operate
with
old
marque
,
many
of
which
be
more
than
ten
year
old
,
which
be
in
perfectly
good
condition
and
I
do
not
see
why
such
vehicle
cannot
continue
to
be
use
.
while
that
be
the
basic
point
,
I
also
seek
clarification
on
the
ownership
of
taxi
licence
.
my
understanding
be
that
plate
will
no
long
be
transferable
.
if
that
assumption
be
correct
,
will
it
be
the
case
that
if
someone
invest
in
a
taxi
business
,
this
plate
,
which
cost
approximately
€
6000
,
will
be
non-transferable
and
cannot
be
use
as
a
asset
should
the
person
in
question
decide
to
dispose
of
it
to
a
family
member
or
otherwise
?
be
this
to
be
the
case
,
I
would
have
a
issue
with
it
.
someone
who
build
up
a
business
and
invest
approximately
€
6000
,
should
be
able
to
transfer
that
licence
as
he
or
she
see
fit
,
subject
to
certain
provision
be
put
in
place
.
it
should
be
subject
to
certain
rule
and
regulation
and
the
person
take
over
the
licence
should
adhere
to
certain
regulation
and
training
.
if
the
plate
be
non-transferable
,
perhaps
the
regulator
will
clarify
the
reason
and
expand
on
this
subject
.
I
thank
the
regulator
for
she
submission
.
or
a
silent
Kerryman
?
I
ask
about
uniformity
but
I
think
Ms
Doyle
address
my
question
.
she
do
not
propose
uniformity
of
vehicle
make
or
colour
.
I

commissioner
and

head
of

Gilna

I
apologise
for
miss
the
initial
contribution
.
I
join
member
in
welcoming
the
delegation
before
the
committee
.
I
,
too
,
be
on
a
steep
learning
curve
.
generally
speak
,
there
be
confidence
in
the
system
of
regulation
while
there
be
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
market
mechanism
.
it
be
important
to
make
that
distinction
.
my
question
be
predicate
on
practical
matter
,
for
instance
,
the
high
degree
to
which
the
banking
sector
have
issue
loan
on
foot
of
what
be
effectively
property
speculation
.
I
do
not
know
the
percentage
but
I
wonder
if
the
downturn
in
that
sector
have
leave
the
banking
sector
vulnerable
to
a
situation
similar
to
that
of
Northern
Rock
and
other
institution
.
I
realise
we
make
the
distinction
between
the
sub
-
prime
market
and
the
position
as
it
relate
to
Ireland
in
that
Ireland
would
not
have
be
a
victim
of
the
sub
-
prime
lending
scenario
,
so
to
speak
,
but
it
appear
a
great
deal
of
money
be
tie
up
in
property
.
if
a
downturn
occur
in
the
construction
sector
and
there
be
potential
for
default
on
loan
,
do
that
leave
the
banking
sector
vulnerable
?
be
there
a
role
for
the
regulator
in
that
regard
in
seek
to
modify
the
behaviour
of
bank
in
term
of
the
way
they
loan
to
they
customer
in
the
future
?
I
be
sure
there
have
not
be
much
lending
to
other
sector
with
growth
potential
within
the
economy
,
and
perhaps
that
be
something
that
should
be
examine
.
in
agriculture
,
for
example
,
only
2
%
of
all
lending
relate
to
agricultural
output
but
I
would
like
to
hear
the
representative
's
view
on
that
.
in
term
of
the
potential
for
a
banking
crisis
,
I
imagine
the
risk
to
be
low
but
it
always
exist
.
in
regard
to
the
amount
of
money
on
deposit
by
individual
citizen
,
do
the
representative
believe
there
be
enough
protection
in
place
to
ensure
that
if
one
or
two
bank
go
bust
,
the
money
they
have
on
deposit
be
adequately
protect
?
I
understand
there
be
a
mechanism
in
place
and
a
fund
with
the
Central
Bank
for
depositor
but
in
the
current
climate
,
and
give
what
have
happen
abroad
,
be
there
grounds
for
enhance
that
provision
?
with
regard
to
the
European
Union
financial
service
action
plan
,
the
first
question
be
a
practical
one
.
be
it
a
bind
action
plan
on
all
member
states
and
,
if
so
,
what
percentage
of
that
action
plan
have
be
transpose
into
law
?
how
be
the
representative
monitor
the
transposition
of
that
law
and
regulation
?
be
there
scope
for
good
legislation
,
give
that
the
Lamfalussy
report
in
2001
instigate
the
financial
service
action
plan
?
be
there
scope
for
a
review
of
that
or
could
we
have
good
regulation
to
achieve
the
maximum
amount
of
output
in
the
economy
,
which
be
what
we
be
talk
about
?
I
be
heartened
that
the
organisation
have
put
themselves
up
for
external
review
.
that
be
always
a
good
benchmark
because
self
-
regulation
be
not
always
the
most
effective
.
the
fact
that
they
constantly
review
they
operation
would
give
some
grounds
for
confidence
also
.
the
financial
service
action
plan
allow
for
,
say
,
Bank
of
Ireland
or
AIB
to
set
up
operation
in
other
country
.
in
do
so
,
would
they
be
subject
to
they
host
nation
's
regulatory
regime
?
be
bank
which
set
up
operation
in
this
country
subject
to
we
regulatory
regime
govern
,
for
example
,
issue
relate
to
liquidity
,
or
be
they
only
subject
to
the
regulatory
regime
of
they
home
country
?
it
be
important
to
maintain
confidence
in
the
system
because
if
confidence
fail
,
it
have
implication
down
the
line
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Neary
,
Ms
Sheehy
and
Ms
O'Dea
for
they
attendance
and
the
information
they
have
supply
.
I
look
forward
to
meet
they
again
in
the
not
too
distant
future
.

in

.
I
welcome
the
submission
as
a
fellow
citizen
who
have
a
bank
account
.
it
appear
that
who
have
genuine
complaint
against
banking
organisation
have
no
recourse
to
mechanism
that
would
provide
a
remedy
.
I
be
amazed
that
in
response
to
the
question
of
whether
it
keep
a
record
or
report
on
a
case
for
which
it
claim
it
be
not
responsible
,
the
Financial
Regulator
state
:
"
this
be
not
possible
in
you
case
because
you
complaint
fall
outside
the
definition
of
a
consumer
"
.
that
be
a
extraordinary
scenario
.
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
committee
to
ask
the
Financial
Service
Ombudsman
and
the
Financial
Regulator
the
question
Mr.
Beades
pose
in
he
conclusion
.
we
should
at
least
write
to
they
to
seek
answer
to
some
of
this
question
.
if
we
be
now
in
a
situation
whereby
complaint
make
by
individual
be
define
as
"
non-consumer
complaint
"
,
what
recourse
be
open
to
anybody
who
hold
a
bank
account
in
this
State
?
if
the
role
of
the
Financial
Regulator
and
the
ombudsman
be
protect
consumer
,
it
be
clear
that
a
flaw
exist
in
the
system
.
question
must
be
answer
by
this
taxpayer
fund
body
in
regard
to
the
practice
of
the
banking
sector
.
I
thank
the
delegate
very
much
for
they
presentation
and
they
frankness
on
this
matter
.
as
member
say
,
serious
issue
have
be
raise
and
we
must
deal
with
they
either
by
bring
in
the
regulator
or
expand
the
role
of
the
financial
ombudsman
.
we
will
take
up
the
issue
raise
and
follow
through
on
they
.
the
committee
will
communicate
with
the
delegate
again
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Callaghan
's
presentation
on
behalf
of
Ryanair
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
read
on
the
issue
from
the
point
of
view
of
how
it
impact
on
the
end
user
,
the
customer
at
the
airport
.
we
be
hear
numerous
costing
for
Terminal
2
.
the
question
be
whether
the
charge
be
impose
by
the
regulator
be
be
impose
in
a
manner
that
seek
to
meet
the
cost
of
the
new
terminal
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
what
be
the
true
cost
of
t2
?
when
Mr.
Guiomard
appear
before
the
committee
he
mention
a
figure
of
€
1.2
billion
.
the
Dublin
Airport
Authority
state
the
cost
will
be
in
the
region
of
€395
million
at
current
price
and
Ryanair
have
its
own
figure
on
this
.
what
be
the
true
picture
as
regards
the
pricing
mechanism
of
the
cost
of
the
terminal
?
with
regard
to
RAB
,
the
regulate
asset
base
,
what
be
the
alternative
model
of
cost
in
that
sense
?
I
be
a
layman
and
I
be
seek
to
broaden
my
understanding
of
the
issue
.
if
we
have
a
different
model
would
it
be
more
efficient
?
what
do
Ryanair
think
be
the
more
efficient
model
?
what
be
the
power
of
this
committee
to
question
until
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
be
quite
a
confusing
issue
?
I
be
not
completely
convinced
the
regulator
be
act
in
the
good
interest
of
the
consumer
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
it
be
a
openly
competitive
model
,
but
I
cannot
explain
the
reason
for
not
be
convince
.
I
need
further
information
.
perhaps
it
be
naivety
and
lack
of
understanding
on
my
part
,
but
when
the
Commission
for
Aviation
Regulation
be
here
it
give
we
a
rose
-
tint
view
of
matter
.
I
call
specifically
for
Ryanair
to
attend
today
to
obtain
another
point
of
view
and
then
we
could
recall
the
regulator
so
that
we
can
see
the
true
picture
.
I
be
not
convinced
the
cost
model
that
pertain
to
Terminal
2
be
necessarily
the
correct
one
.
as
a
Corkman
who
find
it
necessary
to
use
Dublin
Airport
every
time
I
go
to
Dublin
,
I
do
so
reluctantly
because
of
the
sheer
hassle
one
must
go
through
and
the
charging
structure
that
apply
to
everything
one
do
from
the
time
one
park
one
's
car
to
when
one
board
the
plane
.
perhaps
the
aviation
regulator
should
be
bring
to
book
in
regard
to
some
of
this
charge
that
be
apply
to
consumer
,
to
whom
we
have
ultimate
responsibility
.
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
appropriate
to
ask
,
but
would
it
be
possible
for
Mr.
Callaghan
to
expand
on
he
view
in
regard
to
the
servicing
of
debt
vis-à
-
vis
Cork
Airport
and
the
future
of
that
airport
.
be
Ryanair
's
potential
involvement
in
Cork
Airport
hinder
by
virtue
of
the
debt
the
airport
be
saddle
with
and
the
cost
structure
that
arise
as
a
result
of
that
debt
?
I
will
come
in
on
the
second
round
.
I
thank
Mr.
Callaghan
for
that
answer
.
we
need
to
distinguish
between
discretionary
and
airport
charge
.
I
have
fly
to
far
flung
place
with
Ryanair
.
I
sleep
on
the
floor
of
Frankfurt
-
Hahn
Airport
,
not
a
very
comfortable
place
to
sleep
,
while
await
a
transfer
to
Ciampino
to
watch
Ireland
play
Italy
in
the
six
Nation
Championship
.
however
,
have
I
travel
with
Alitalia
or
Aer
Lingus
,
I
would
have
pay
through
the
nose
for
the
privilege
.
there
be
many
customer
who
will
take
whatever
step
be
necessary
to
reach
they
final
destination
,
include
,
if
they
must
,
sleep
on
a
uncomfortable
airport
floor
.
the
argument
be
not
about
the
extra
charge
Ryanair
impose
.
the
bottom
line
be
to
pack
a
small
bag
.
most
people
I
know
travel
at
weekend
and
can
simply
put
they
bag
in
the
overhead
locker
.
we
must
distinguish
between
that
charge
and
that
levy
by
airport
on
consumer
.
that
be
the
point
.
I
do
not
wish
to
harp
on
about
the
cost
of
Terminal
2
but
who
will
its
end
user
be
?
who
will
pay
for
it
?
if
Ryanair
or
any
other
airline
will
not
use
it
,
will
they
have
to
pay
for
it
?
will
it
be
the
taxpayer
who
will
ultimately
pay
for
it
?
who
will
be
the
net
beneficiary
when
it
be
complete
?
this
issue
must
be
hammer
out
.
if
I
have
learn
anything
today
,
it
be
that
more
question
must
be
ask
of
the
regulator
who
must
be
bring
back
to
address
the
point
outline
in
the
submission
.
I
thank
Mr.
Callaghan
for
he
presentation
which
probably
raise
more
question
than
it
answer
.
the
committee
may
revisit
the
issue
and
perhaps
look
at
other
company
and
talk
to
the
head
of
regulatory
affair
before
it
come
back
to
the
regulator
.
I
also
thank

I

presentation

I
shall
be
brief
and
to
the
point
.
arise
from
this
document
,
which
be
fairly
self
-
evident
,
from
what
he
say
,
be
there
scope
for
look
at
the
role
of
the
consumer
panel
to
intervene
with
the
Financial
Regulator
or
to
intervene
publicly
in
forum
other
than
this
one
to
highlight
some
of
the
issue
Mr.
Burgess
talk
about
?
it
seem
that
there
be
a
culture
within
banking
,
which
have
always
be
secretive
,
for
commercial
and
other
cultural
reason
.
that
type
of
culture
seem
to
pervade
the
remit
of
the
Financial
Regulator
.
be
there
scope
for
increase
the
power
of
the
consumer
panel
to
bring
the
Financial
Regulator
to
book
on
some
of
the
issue
Mr.
Burgess
have
outline
?
the
role
of
the
consumer
panel
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
,
while
it
have
a
remit
on
committee
such
as
this
,
be
perhaps
very
limited
in
its
scope
and
may
need
to
be
expand
somewhat
.
in
term
of
Mr.
Burgess
's
presentation
vis-à
-
vo
the
credit
union
movement
,
notwithstand
the
regulator
's
intervention
on
the
loss
of
€
40
million
,
I
have
often
think
that
this
sector
be
underperfor
in
term
of
its
potential
.
give
the
amount
of
money
on
deposit
within
the
credit
union
movement
—
I
do
not
know
the
exact
sum
—
and
its
purchase
power
,
be
there
scope
to
expand
its
operation
in
term
of
credit
facility
and
increase
banking
facility
?
the
credit
union
as
it
be
constitute
be
own
by
its
membership
.
be
there
a
role
for
the
consumer
panel
?
while
that
question
may
be
a
little
off
the
point
,
Mr.
Burgess
refer
to
the
credit
union
movement
.
from
a
consumer
perspective
,
be
there
increase
scope
for
the
credit
union
movement
to
perhaps
increase
or
wide
its
remit
from
a
credit
or
financial
institution
perspective
?
I
will
return
to
this
point
after
Mr.
Burgess
have
respond
to
deputy
Kirk
's
question
.
Mr.
Burgess
mention
the
paragraph
on
sell
investment
product
to
the
elderly
.
there
seem
to
be
a
glaring
deficiency
.
accord
to
the
2006
report
,
the
ombudsman
refer
the
issue
of
missel
to
the
elderly
to
the
regulator
who
,
follow
a
relevant
"
Prime
Time
"
programme
in
2008
,
report
that
there
be
no
information
to
verify
a
widespread
problem
.
besides
the
ombudsman
's
report
,
the
"
Prime
Time
"
programme
show
clear
evidence
.
be
it
a
question
of
resource
?
be
the
Financial
regulator
so
consume
by
the
prudential
rule
govern
banking
and
financial
institution
that
the
consumer
element
of
its
operation
be
not
as
prioritise
as
it
should
be
?
I
want
Mr.
Burgess
's
opinion
,
not
to
put
word
in
he
mouth
.
the
majority
of
people
have
faith
in
financial
institution
,
give
that
they
have
bank
account
,
mortgage
and
so
on
.
due
to
a
inherent
faith
in
the
system
,
the
bulk
of
transaction
be
carry
out
without
question
.
however
,
people
do
not
visit
they
bank
branch
and
ask
difficult
question
about
bank
's
function
.
speak
for
myself
,
there
be
a
certain
degree
of
ignorance
bear
of
a
inherent
trust
.
be
more
consumer
to
begin
question
at
ground
level
the
nature
of
the
transaction
,
charging
mechanism
,
etc.
,
there
would
be
a
different
culture
that
would
not
give
rise
to
the
point
be
address
by
Mr.
Burgess
or
programme
such
as
"
Prime
Time
"
.
I
thank
Mr.
Burgess
for
participate
in
this
frank
exchange
.

I
thank
Mr.
Burgess
for
participate
in
this
frank
exchange
.
I
have
listen
to
what
the
Financial
Regulator
have
to
say
.
when
he
address
this
committee
on
29
April
I
ask
the
follow
:
if
a
downturn
occur
in
the
construction
sector
and
there
be
potential
for
default
on
loan
,
do
that
leave
the
banking
sector
vulnerable
?
be
there
a
role
for
the
regulator
in
that
regard
in
seek
to
modify
the
behaviour
of
bank
in
term
of
the
way
they
loan
to
they
customer
in
the
future
?
aside
from
other
question
I
ask
on
the
day
,
the
response
I
get
to
that
particular
question
from
Mr.
Neary
be
as
follow
:
there
be
no
evidence
that
lending
for
speculative
property
development
starve
other
sector
of
resource
.
I
have
no
sense
of
that
happen
but
will
reflect
on
the
question
and
,
if
there
be
any
evidence
that
it
have
take
place
,
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
with
a
reply
.
the
Financial
Regulator
's
submission
to
the
joint
committee
on
29
April
when
we
deal
with
the
exposure
of
Northern
Rock
be
remarkably
different
from
its
submission
today
.
I
put
it
to
Mr.
Neary
that
he
have
fail
in
he
task
,
that
at
good
the
regulatory
regime
be
very
weak
and
that
ultimately
the
cost
for
that
seriously
expose
will
fall
to
the
taxpayer
.
at
what
point
do
he
telephone
the
Minister
for
Finance
to
set
alarm
bell
ring
about
the
banking
crisis
bind
to
unfold
,
in
the
light
of
the
information
now
available
,
in
term
of
the
exposure
of
Irish
bank
?
he
must
have
know
about
this
,
as
he
must
have
have
he
ear
to
the
ground
and
,
if
not
,
why
not
?
follow
on
from
deputy
Ardagh
's
question
,
I
would
be
more
blunt
.
be
Mr.
Neary
's
position
untenable
?
if
not
,
do
he
think
the
measure
he
be
propose
will
give
solace
to
that
with
35
year
100
%
mortgage
who
be
seriously
expose
in
the
current
climate
?
do
he
believe
the
European
regulatory
framework
be
a
proper
regulatory
framework
?
do
he
believe
one
regulator
per
country
act
unilaterally
be
not
the
way
to
go
?
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
crisis
—
we
do
not
know
what
will
happen
tomorrow
—
be
through
a
cross-compliance
structure
,
a
inter-European
regulatory
framework
,
whereby
all
member
state
would
subscribe
to
the
same
set
of
rule
.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
structure
,
the
euro
be
under
threat
.
on
30
September
the
government
act
in
what
it
term
as
the
country
's
good
interest
but
it
could
be
argue
that
it
act
unilaterally
.
other
follow
suit
but
now
the
game
have
change
in
the
light
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
's
intervention
.
I
do
not
understand
how
such
a
level
of
borrowing
be
allow
to
continue
.
Mr.
Neary
will
have
to
explain
to
the
joint
committee
why
the
bank
be
able
to
lend
money
hand
over
fist
without
anybody
put
a
halt
to
it
or
without
political
responsibility
.
perhaps
it
be
a
fact
that
he
do
not
communicate
with
the
Minister
for
Finance
.
if
he
do
to
set
alarm
bell
ring
,
we
would
like
to
hear
how
and
when
it
be
done
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
Mr.
Neary
say
in
he
statement
to
the
committee
that
speculative
lending
to
the
construction
and
property
sector
amount
to
€39.1
billion
,
of
which
€
24
billion
be
support
by
additional
collateral
or
alternative
source
of
cashflow
.
this
leave
a
balance
of
€
15
billion
secure
directly
on
the
underlying
property
.
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
this
potentially
leave
the
taxpayer
expose
to
a
guarantee
of
€
15
billion
if
the
loan
be
default
on
.
at
what
point
be
this
information
know
to
Mr.
Neary
?
have
it
only
come
to
light
in
the
past
week
or
so
or
be
it
know
some
month
ago
?
my
main
question
for
the
Financial
Regulator
be
what
relationship
do
it
share
with
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Minister
for
Finance
?
it
must
have
know
much
early
that
thing
be
not
go
accord
to
plan
and
that
they
be
not
right
in
the
banking
sector
.
what
mechanism
have
be
use
by
the
regulator
?
Mr.
Neary
be
use
certain
language
and
it
be
hard
to
argue
vociferously
against
he
.
he
seem
to
be
genuine
regard
what
he
be
try
to
achieve
.
I
be
worried
that
the
Financial
Regulator
do
not
bang
the
table
enough
,
if
I
may
put
it
that
way
,
in
its
interaction
with
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Department
of
Finance
and
that
this
be
part
of
the
crisis
.
that
be
what
we
be
here
to
do
.
if
the
taxpayer
be
to
underwrite
a
guarantee
for
the
banking
sector
,
it
be
fair
that
we
should
ask
pertinent
question
and
have
a
open
dialogue
on
the
issue
.
if
€69.3
billion
have
be
loan
,
a
question
arise
in
respect
of
the
insurance
cover
that
debt
.
in
addition
,
the
issue
of
speculation
on
credit
default
swap
have
emerge
of
late
.
to
what
extent
,
ultimately
,
be
the
Irish
taxpayer
,
government
and
bank
expose
in
this
regard
?
do
the
regulator
take
a
view
on
the
issue
of
credit
default
swap
?
moreover
,
the
point
that
be
make
about
securitisation
and
its
relevance
to
the
position
in
which
we
find
ourselves
at
present
should
be
repeat
because
I
do
not
quite
follow
it
.
we
will
communicate
with
it
in
the
matter
.
we
will
communicate
with
it
in
the
matter
.
we
will
communicate
with
it
in
the
matter
.
we
will
communicate
with
it
in
the
matter
.
I
welcome
the
delegation
.
the
purpose
of
the
visit
and
the
establishment
of
a
ombudsman
be
a
reasonable
request
.
we
support
this
and
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
within
the
remit
of
this
committee
to
create
such
a
post
but
it
be
certainly
within
we
remit
to
lobby
for
such
a
post
.
I
will
be
bring
the
suggestion
to
the
Labour
Party
spokesperson
on
enterprise
and
employment
.
it
should
be
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
represent
a
constituency
that
have
a
mix
of
urban
and
rural
area
.
there
be
many
business
like
that
represent
by
the
CSNA
in
rural
setting
and
they
find
it
difficult
to
survive
.
not
only
be
they
face
with
the
cost
and
bureaucratic
nature
of
do
business
but
local
authority
charge
be
increase
year
on
year
.
if
there
be
a
move
towards
expansion
,
the
development
levy
and
contribution
that
small
business
must
pay
to
the
county
council
be
regressive
.
business
be
be
use
as
a
means
to
fund
local
government
,
something
that
must
be
review
.
if
we
continue
to
punish
small
business
that
operate
in
a
rural
environment
,
it
will
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
presence
of
that
business
in
the
future
.
something
must
be
do
and
the
establishment
of
a
ombudsman
would
be
beneficial
to
take
a
overview
of
the
regulatory
framework
and
the
punitive
cost
place
on
business
in
that
setting
.
I
be
interested
in
the
comment
on
the
National
consumer
Agency
and
Repak
.
I
have
not
figure
out
what
Repak
do
.
I
see
the
wonderful
advertisement
it
put
out
and
the
impression
be
create
that
the
recycling
regime
in
this
country
be
wonderful
.
however
,
it
raise
question
about
the
nature
of
the
recycling
regime
.
through
they
membership
of
Repak
,
the
large
multiple
be
let
off
the
hook
with
regard
to
the
packaging
directive
because
there
be
no
requirement
to
recycle
at
the
point
of
purchase
.
I
would
like
to
hear
more
about
this
.
if
there
be
a
position
paper
outline
the
delegate
's
view
on
that
relationship
perhaps
that
might
be
send
to
I
.
we
must
look
at
that
issue
.
I
do
not
realise
that
such
a
high
percentage
of
turnover
related
to
communication
,
if
I
might
broadly
describe
it
that
way
.
perhaps
this
committee
might
bring
in
the
National
consumer
Agency
and
put
more
stringent
question
to
it
.
in
essence
,
I
disagree
with
nothing
that
have
be
say
by
the
witness
.
it
be
common
sense
and
highlight
the
situation
of
independent
retailer
who
be
sustain
business
in
difficult
time
against
competition
from
large
multiple
.
there
must
be
a
regulatory
framework
in
order
to
make
it
a
bit
easy
for
the
representative
and
they
member
.
rather
than
hinder
they
,
it
should
facilitate
do
business
because
of
the
people
and
the
community
they
serve
.
this
be
a
basic
commonsensical
argument
and
it
should
be
support
.
there
be
a
time
constraint
,
as
another
committee
be
due
to
meet
in
this
room
at
11
a
.m.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
attend
.
they
have
make
they
point
well
.
they
have
raise
many
issue
concern
the
retail
sector
which
we
will
examine
and
on
which
we
will
possibly
have
further
discussion
with
they
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
's
clarification
of
the
position
vis-à
-
vis
credit
rating
versus
credit
reference
.
the
objective
set
out
by
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
be
clear
and
a
distinction
have
be
make
in
that
sense
.
a
issue
arise
regard
the
objective
of
aid
avoidance
of
over
-
indebtedness
.
if
my
mode
of
put
question
be
wrong
,
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
may
correct
I
.
if
somebody
who
be
not
part
of
the
group
of
80
member
seek
information
on
a
particular
person
,
be
a
facility
available
whereby
the
ICB
will
provide
information
on
a
particular
individual
to
third
party
?
be
information
on
the
credit
history
of
individual
freely
available
to
the
80
member
of
the
ICB
?
to
clarify
,
be
it
correct
that
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
do
not
make
lending
decision
,
as
such
,
and
be
,
as
have
be
state
,
a
librarian
or
facility
for
store
datum
?
there
be
,
in
effect
,
a
element
of
rating
involve
in
the
activity
of
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
.
I
beg
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
's
indulgence
on
this
issue
.
I
be
try
to
enhance
my
understanding
of
the
issue
and
ask
he
to
forgive
I
if
my
question
appear
persistent
.
be
there
scope
for
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
to
develop
as
a
credit
rating
agency
?
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
for
attend
the
meeting
.

on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
for
attend
the
meeting
.
I
will
couch
my
question
with
a
reference
to
the
role
and
remit
of
the
committee
in
look
at
the
regulatory
framework
and
,
more
generally
,
where
the
banking
sector
stand
today
.
we
have
see
the
downgrade
by
Standard
&
poor
's
and
Moody
's
which
speak
volume
about
the
current
banking
culture
in
the
State
.
on
contract
for
difference
,
what
be
the
internal
audit
unit
's
regulatory
role
,
as
the
delegate
understand
it
,
in
term
of
they
internal
procedure
?
what
be
the
regulatory
framework
for
report
contract
for
difference
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
's
operation
?
what
involvement
have
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
Financial
Regulator
have
with
the
bank
in
this
transaction
?
be
there
a
internal
auditing
procedure
to
govern
they
?
if
,
for
instance
,
a
number
of
shareholder
be
loan
money
to
buy
share
use
the
share
as
collateral
,
would
Mr.
Tyrell
have
a
role
in
that
regard
?
there
be
a
loan
issue
and
there
be
a
shareholder
issue
.
I
understand
the
distinction
Mr.
Tyrell
make
in
term
of
he
role
vis
-à
-
vis
a
shareholder
issue
.
if
there
be
loan
which
be
acquire
by
people
who
be
shareholder
for
the
purpose
of
purchase
stock
or
share
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
,
would
Mr.
Tyrell
have
a
role
?
if
I
ask
this
question
I
be
do
so
as
a
layman
who
seek
a
understanding
,
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
be
look
at
Anglo
Irish
Bank
and
wonder
what
in
God
's
name
be
go
on
.
we
be
try
to
get
a
understanding
of
how
the
financial
regulatory
system
work
in
term
of
banking
operation
and
how
risk
management
and
internal
auditing
function
be
carry
out
.
I
would
like
that
information
dissect
and
disseminate
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
ordinary
man
and
woman
in
the
street
some
degree
of
understanding
of
how
this
thing
work
,
mindful
of
the
fact
that
this
bank
be
nationalise
.
if
Mr.
Tyrell
be
look
at
the
lending
control
,
be
he
mindful
,
in
term
of
he
operation
,
as
to
what
be
happen
within
the
market
or
be
it
merely
a
internal
compliance
risk
management
issue
?
be
Mr.
Tyrell
mindful
of
the
fact
that
if
a
person
,
who
be
a
shareholder
for
the
purpose
of
purchase
share
,
be
to
seek
a
loan
,
the
internal
auditor
in
that
instance
have
no
role
whatsoever
in
term
of
the
lending
policy
?
if
the
internal
auditor
have
a
role
be
it
flag
up
or
do
one
call
time
on
it
?
what
be
the
exact
procedure
by
which
internal
auditor
act
in
such
instance
if
it
be
to
happen
?
therefore
,
the
final
decision
be
not
that
of
the
internal
auditor
.
I
thank
Mr.
Tyrell
.
if
the
process
be
work
so
well
,
why
do
Mr.
Tyrell
think
we
be
where
we
be
today
in
term
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
?
can
he
give
a
overview
,
give
he
12
year
experience
with
Anglo
Irish
Bank
and
the
fact
that
he
be
appoint
head
of
internal
audit
in
2005
and
be
the
former
head
of
Anglo
Irish
Assurance
Company
?
will
Mr.
Tyrell
please
elaborate
on
that
?
in
deputy
Kelly
's
world
,
Fianna
Fáil
be
never
in
power
during
the
last
ten
year
.
that
be
just
a
dream
also
.
I
be
seek
a
good
understanding
of
the
submission
be
make
to
the
committee
.
no
human
being
with
any
sense
of
reason
could
believe
that
if
a
chairman
of
one
of
the
bank
in
Ireland
approach
that
bank
for
a
loan
,
he
or
she
would
be
subject
to
the
same
stringent
internal
audit
procedure
as
,
for
example
,
I
,
if
I
seek
a
loan
from
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
the
delegate
cannot
realistically
expect
we
or
the
people
to
believe
what
have
be
say
about
the
internal
auditing
procedure
as
they
apply
to
the
loan
of
various
director
.
I
be
try
to
look
at
this
from
the
perspective
of
a
ordinary
shareholder
such
as
a
pensioner
who
have
ordinary
share
in
the
bank
as
a
investment
and
be
hope
for
a
return
on
that
investment
in
they
autumn
or
winter
year
.
there
appear
to
be
a
sense
of
duplicity
in
how
internal
auditing
procedure
be
effect
with
regard
to
director
's
loan
and
how
they
be
effect
in
the
case
of
other
loan
such
as
to
business
.
I
speak
about
the
contract
for
difference
.
I
be
anxious
to
understand
before
I
leave
this
committee
whether
there
be
a
procedure
whereby
loan
be
make
to
individual
who
be
shareholder
for
the
purpose
of
purchase
share
,
where
contract
for
difference
be
transfer
into
ordinary
share
,
if
I
understand
the
process
correctly
.
I
have
not
receive
a
satisfactory
answer
to
assist
my
understanding
of
how
the
internal
auditing
procedure
operate
in
such
instance
.
it
have
be
state
publicly
or
in
the
press
that
there
be
a
number
of
what
I
call
"
angel
investor
"
who
assist
shareholder
for
the
purpose
of
buy
what
be
report
to
be
a
10
%
shareholding
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
it
be
also
state
some
of
that
be
exist
shareholder
.
we
be
try
to
find
out
the
extent
of
the
borrowing
,
what
be
use
as
collateral
for
this
borrowing
and
whether
there
be
a
reporting
procedure
to
the
Department
of
Finance
.
the
delegate
have
state
they
cannot
talk
about
individual
shareholder
;
therefore
,
I
will
put
my
question
in
another
way
.
if
somebody
who
be
a
shareholder
purchase
share
and
take
out
a
loan
from
Anglo
Irish
Bank
for
the
purpose
of
purchase
this
share
,
be
there
a
internal
auditing
procedure
in
that
regard
and
be
there
a
reporting
procedure
that
must
be
undertake
to
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
Financial
Regulator
?
I
appreciate
the
position
—
—
that
be
not
exactly
what
I
be
state
.
my
point
concern
whether
people
take
out
loan
use
a
particular
form
of
collateral
,
namely
,
share
in
the
bank
,
to
purchase
share
in
the
bank
.
I
appreciate
that
,
but
it
go
to
the
heart
of
what
the
committee
be
examine
for
whatever
input
we
have
into
a
legislative
framework
to
shore
up
some
of
this
matter
in
the
future
.
it
assist
we
understanding
of
how
we
might
proceed
in
that
regard
.
what
would
lending
of
this
nature
typically
be
give
for
?
I
be
try
to
increase
my
understanding
of
the
internal
audit
process
,
the
risk
management
function
in
respect
of
lending
and
the
credit
control
function
.
we
be
just
try
to
find
out
what
the
nature
of
the
loan
might
be
.
I
thank
Mr.
Daly

Mr.
Tyrell
,
Ms
Whiston
and
the
other

of
the
delegation

I
welcome
Mr.
Moynihan
to
the
joint
committee
.
I
will
first
make
a
number
of
basic
,
broad
point
.
we
be
witness
how
capitalism
be
be
redesign
.
I
do
not
say
this
in
a
ideological
manner
.
the
Anglo
-
Saxon
model
to
which
Mr.
Moynihan
refer
have
be
effectively
turn
on
its
head
.
we
be
still
in
a
state
of
flux
and
no
one
know
what
new
model
will
emerge
from
the
current
system
.
we
have
the
Japanese
and
Korean
model
of
capitalism
,
the
Anglo
-
Saxon
model
and
the
German
model
.
while
Germany
have
be
affect
by
the
financial
crisis
,
it
have
not
be
to
the
same
extent
as
other
model
.
the
German
federal
structure
allow
for
a
system
of
banking
which
ensure
regulation
be
tight
.
I
ask
Mr.
Moynihan
for
he
opinion
.
could
Ireland
use
the
German
model
?
will
he
also
,
in
broad
stroke
,
give
a
view
on
how
we
should
develop
a
regulation
model
which
would
insure
we
against
shock
such
as
that
we
have
see
in
the
recent
past
?
I
accept
,
however
,
that
no
model
will
be
perfect
.
when
the
internal
auditor
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
appear
before
the
joint
committee
recently
,
member
seek
to
question
they
on
loan
to
director
and
the
fact
that
loan
could
be
make
to
director
with
impunity
.
how
do
we
change
relationship
between
internal
audit
committee
,
credit
control
committee
and
board
of
director
who
pass
loan
of
a
certain
nature
?
how
do
we
tighten
such
practice
?
regulation
be
need
to
grapple
with
this
issue
.
the
European
Union
,
in
the
Jacques
de
la
Rosières
report
,
have
produce
a
set
of
recommendation
.
Heretofore
,
the
British
be
outside
the
tent
in
reach
political
agreement
at
EU
level
on
European
regulation
.
this
be
mainly
due
to
the
city
of
London
.
it
appear
,
however
,
that
it
will
,
through
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
Mr.
Alastair
Darling
,
get
on
board
and
accept
a
European
model
of
regulation
.
can
the
Oireachtas
introduce
legislative
measure
to
ensure
Ireland
stay
on
the
curve
or
will
the
European
Union
be
ahead
of
the
curve
?
should
we
accept
the
EU
model
in
its
entirety
?
what
can
we
do
to
ensure
we
regulatory
framework
be
at
least
compliant
with
the
European
Union
model
?
I
would
like
also
to
get
a
sense
of
what
be
happen
in
Europe
,
if
Mr.
Moynihan
have
a
opinion
on
that
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
for
now
because
there
will
be
many
question
.
the
investment
of
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
and
Miscellaneous
provision
Bill
2009
,
currently
make
its
way
through
the
House
,
give
the
government
,
through
the
reserve
fund
,
the
power
to
take
a
stake
in
the
specify
institution
through
preference
share
.
do
Mr.
Moynihan
expect
there
will
be
a
return
for
the
State
on
this
investment
in
the
come
year
?
the
result
post
by
AIB
this
week
include
a
reference
to
potential
loan
write
-
downs
of
more
than
€
8
billion
.
it
seem
likely
,
therefore
,
notwithstand
the
government
's
undertaking
to
recapitalise
each
bank
to
the
tune
of
€
3.5
billion
,
that
the
bank
in
question
may
be
catch
short
.
the
view
of
the
global
financial
market
be
that
Irish
banking
stock
be
untouchable
.
in
this
context
,
the
measure
the
government
be
take
be
not
necessarily
be
recognise
as
positive
.
it
seem
more
must
be
do
if
confidence
in
we
bank
be
to
be
restore
.
aside
from
the
regulatory
issue
,
therefore
,
there
be
the
question
of
why
the
market
do
not
necessarily
view
the
recapitalisation
measure
as
a
positive
development
.
if
they
do
,
there
would
have
be
some
increase
in
the
share
price
in
recent
day
.
I
be
interested
in
Mr.
Moynihan
's
view
on
nationalisation
.
what
would
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
such
a
process
?
if
,
for
example
,
AIB
be
to
be
nationalise
,
what
signal
would
that
send
to
the
market
in
term
of
how
Ireland
be
conduct
its
business
?
give
that
nationalisation
require
the
suspension
of
share
,
what
impact
would
that
have
on
a
bank
's
ability
to
fund
debt
into
the
future
?
if
the
taxpayer
be
to
own
100
%
of
the
bank
,
can
that
bank
continue
to
operate
within
the
market
in
the
same
manner
as
they
have
do
heretofore
?
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Moynihan
for
he
attendance
and
for
he
excellent
presentation
,
which
have
give
member
plenty
of
food
for
thought
.
the
joint
committee
will
adjourn
until
10.30
a.m.
next
Tuesday
,
when
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
will
appear
before
it
.

on
a
point
of
order
,
it
be
midday
and
government
member
have
spend
the
past
hour
question
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
.
I
ask
for
equity
.
will
the
chairman
allow
for
the
fact
that
the
committee
have
other
member
?
I
too
welcome
Mr.
Hurley
and
he
colleague
to
the
committee
,
especially
as
he
be
a
fellow
Mallow
man
to
boot
.
on
what
I
have
hear
so
far
,
it
seem
that
the
Central
Bank
have
be
a
largely
irrelevant
institution
in
recent
year
.
if
the
regulatory
authority
would
have
be
largely
feed
into
the
financial
stability
assessment
report
,
if
that
report
be
be
ignore
,
and
if
monetary
and
fiscal
policy
be
be
determine
by
the
European
Central
Bank
,
then
why
do
we
have
a
Central
Bank
in
the
first
instance
?
couple
with
that
be
the
question
on
the
de
Larosière
report
.
De
Larosière
be
be
roll
out
as
the
new
John
Wayne
to
whose
train
we
all
will
hitch
we
wagon
and
somehow
he
will
save
the
day
.
it
be
a
little
incongruous
.
my
analysis
of
the
situation
—
Mr.
Hurley
may
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
—
be
that
where
any
prudential
rule
be
seek
to
be
put
in
place
over
the
past
ten
year
,
they
be
fiercely
resist
and
we
and
the
UK
be
probably
the
fiercest
opponent
of
any
change
in
the
rule
in
favour
of
a
more
prudential
system
of
governance
vis
-à
-
vis
the
bank
.
if
a
European
systemic
risk
council
—
a
funny
-
sound
name
—
will
be
set
up
and
it
will
run
through
the
individual
regulatory
supervisor
,
I
question
the
role
of
any
individual
nation
state
's
central
bank
if
it
will
be
the
regulator
that
will
govern
the
behaviour
of
bank
in
such
a
scenario
.
perhaps
Mr.
Hurley
will
comment
on
that
.
will
€
7
billion
be
sufficient
to
recapitalise
AIB
and
the
Bank
of
Ireland
?
legislation
be
pass
by
the
Oireachtas
two
week
ago
.
what
role
have
the
Central
Bank
in
advise
the
Department
of
Finance
on
the
amount
that
would
be
require
?
in
light
of
JP
Morgan
's
assessment
that
bank
liability
in
Ireland
total
€
26.9
billion
,
be
sufficient
money
put
into
the
bank
in
the
first
instance
?
with
regard
to
credit
risk
,
my
understanding
of
economics
be
that
,
traditionally
,
bank
could
loan
on
the
basis
of
deposit
and
they
could
loan
a
multiple
of
that
amount
.
historically
,
the
cash
ratio
be
10
%
but
that
go
out
the
window
and
new
rule
be
introduce
at
Basel
and
so
on
.
the
Central
Bank
become
the
so
-
call
lender
of
last
resort
.
when
do
that
model
dissipate
?
where
do
that
all
go
wrong
?
the
perception
of
ordinary
people
be
the
central
bank
of
any
country
be
the
institution
that
regulate
bank
and
they
haul
they
over
the
coal
if
they
misbehave
.
credit
risk
have
define
the
crisis
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
no
analysis
be
conduct
on
the
level
of
credit
risk
and
bank
could
lend
great
multiple
base
on
the
fact
they
be
parcel
off
credit
risk
as
a
financial
instrument
in
itself
.
do
the
Central
Bank
even
have
the
expertise
to
analyse
what
be
happen
with
regard
to
credit
risk
?
do
it
have
a
role
?
should
it
have
a
role
in
future
?
if
not
,
do
the
Central
Bank
have
a
future
?
essentially
we
be
talk
about
regulation
.
the
fundamental
issue
be
how
the
market
will
be
regulate
into
the
future
.
one
analysis
be
that
we
do
not
know
where
we
be
at
the
moment
,
that
we
be
in
the
morass
and
nobody
have
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
get
out
of
it
and
start
go
again
.
even
if
we
start
go
again
we
do
not
know
what
the
nature
of
that
will
be
.
there
have
be
a
fundamental
rethink
regard
how
thing
will
be
do
from
now
on
.
it
be
fair
comment
to
say
that
the
system
of
regulation
here
be
weak
.
it
be
weak
because
there
may
not
have
be
a
understanding
of
the
financial
instrument
be
use
by
the
market
.
there
may
not
have
be
a
expert
analysis
of
what
be
happen
internally
within
the
bank
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
system
of
regulation
,
what
should
be
the
characteristic
of
a
regulator
in
term
of
its
interrelationship
with
the
Irish
Central
Bank
?
it
seem
,
if
I
be
to
be
honest
about
it
,
that
the
Central
Bank
be
blame
the
Financial
Regulator
or
the
failure
of
regulation
,
and
that
it
be
say
there
be
no
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
Central
Bank
.
what
it
be
say
be
that
it
warn
everybody
through
its
stability
report
but
be
effectively
powerless
to
act
or
to
intervene
because
that
be
the
role
of
the
Financial
Regulator
or
the
Department
of
Finance
.
I
wonder
about
that
interaction
and
whether
or
not
—
—
we
be
now
see
a
admission
by
key
personnel
in
the
country
's
finances
that
there
be
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
financial
instrument
which
cause
the
explosion
in
global
economy
.
I
thank
the
Governor
for
that
.
we
must
learn
from
the
mistake
make
and
go
into
the
future
with
a
new
model
of
governance
.
the
United
State
advocate
a
zero
interest
rate
policy
.
do
Mr.
Hurley
have
a
view
on
that
?
should
we
move
towards
zero
interest
rate
within
the
eurozone
?

I
welcome
the
delegation
.
I
be
a
layman
.
I
be
not
a
accountant
and
do
not
have
any
qualification
in
that
regard
.
if
I
be
read
the
statement
which
the
authority
have
make
about
issue
request
for
information
,
explanation
and
clarification
in
respect
of
84
of
the
report
review
and
that
there
be
amend
financial
information
in
respect
of
50
%
of
report
,
I
would
be
think
that
the
culture
of
compliance
in
this
country
be
still
a
long
way
off
target
in
respect
of
certain
financial
institution
.
I
seek
clarification
because
perhaps
I
misunderste
this
statement
.
if
I
understand
correctly
what
Mr.
Drennan
be
say
,
that
it
be
because
certain
isa
standard
be
not
meet
to
the
full
letter
of
the
law
,
my
view
as
a
layman
be
that
I
think
there
be
still
something
rotten
in
the
state
of
Denmark
,
so
to
speak
,
in
term
of
the
culture
of
compliance
and
that
people
be
still
not
provide
or
fully
disclose
proper
financial
information
or
meet
the
require
standard
.
I
refer
to
the
European
Commission
's
recommendation
on
quality
assurance
of
auditor
.
if
this
be
a
commission
recommendation
,
to
what
extent
should
it
have
be
transpose
into
Irish
law
?
to
what
extent
be
the
government
responsible
for
that
transposition
?
I
ask
for
a
opinion
from
the
delegation
as
to
what
constitute
a
recommendation
in
term
of
transposition
into
Irish
law
and
what
constitute
a
regulation
as
lay
down
by
the
European
Community
in
term
of
the
quality
assurance
of
auditor
of
public
interest
entity
as
that
speak
volume
about
the
culture
in
this
country
where
quite
often
law
,
recommendation
or
regulation
that
be
suppose
to
be
transpose
to
assist
the
culture
of
compliance
be
not
transpose
in
the
manner
in
which
they
should
be
.
this
may
be
something
on
which
the
chief
executive
be
not
in
a
position
to
make
a
comment
but
I
be
sure
the
Senator
may
be
in
such
a
position
.
it
be
fair
to
say
a
large
proportion
of
the
mess
in
term
of
compliance
be
partly
due
to
a
lack
of
political
action
in
enforce
EU
recommendation
and
regulation
.
it
be
very
easy
to
blame
the
culture
of
regulation
,
but
the
government
must
also
take
responsibility
for
its
action
or
inaction
.
it
would
be
.
to
go
off
on
a
slight
but
nonetheless
relevant
tangent
,
be
the
authority
willing
to
make
the
legal
advice
it
have
receive
available
to
the
committee
?
that
be
correct
.
the
reason
I
ask
be
that
the
committee
,
as
a
body
,
could
seek
certain
power
,
theoretically
,
in
relation
to
compellability
.
a
number
of
thing
would
need
to
happen
for
that
to
come
about
,
but
it
could
be
helpful
in
order
to
assist
the
committee
in
term
of
the
question
we
pose
to
people
who
come
before
it
.
in
the
event
of
such
people
assert
that
what
they
say
be
confirm
by
legal
advice
,
if
that
be
make
available
to
we
,
it
might
be
of
assistance
to
we
in
some
instance
.
that
be
understandable
.
that
clarify
that
point
.

I
welcome
the
submission
but
the
only
conclusion
I
can
draw
from
it
be
that
there
be
now
a
change
in
culture
in
the
regulatory
regime
here
.
since
the
appointment
of
Sir
Andrew
large
,
what
potential
for
sanction
now
exist
other
than
for
administrative
sanction
?
if
there
be
a
culture
of
overcharge
,
which
be
the
same
as
theft
,
the
only
recourse
in
law
be
a
administrative
sanction
or
a
fine
.
the
bank
know
that
be
the
case
and
carry
on
with
the
practice
.
we
must
change
from
administrative
to
other
sanction
and
change
the
law
so
that
where
overcharging
occur
on
a
systematic
basis
,
that
responsible
do
time
.
if
we
be
to
effect
change
in
the
regulatory
regime
,
that
be
necessary
.
I
would
like
to
hear
more
about
the
minister
's
announcement
that
Sir
Andrew
large
have
be
appoint
to
look
at
the
prudential
supervision
regime
and
the
regulatory
regime
.
it
be
one
thing
to
assist
in
the
appointment
of
a
chief
but
give
he
experience
,
be
there
not
a
great
role
for
he
?
this
be
matter
we
will
continue
to
probe
.
it
be
vitally
important
that
the
Oireachtas
committee
continue
to
have
the
Financial
regulator
appear
before
they
.
if
this
have
be
do
over
the
past
seven
or
eight
year
,
with
regard
to
a
range
of
issue
in
banking
,
there
would
have
be
more
accountability
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
appear
.

.
I
thank
the
witness
for
appear
.
I
welcome
the
commissioner
from
the
Commission
for
Communication
Regulation
.
the
language
that
have
grow
up
around
communication
be
one
I
do
not
really
understand
.
I
hear
phrase
such
as
"
ensure
seamless
transition
of
the
new
responsibility
"
but
to
speak
in
real
term
,
broadband
provision
be
woefully
inadequate
in
large
tract
of
rural
area
.
we
must
ask
why
be
that
still
the
case
.
Mr.
Doherty
mention
Japan
,
where
if
I
be
not
mistaken
there
be
almost
full
broadband
penetration
and
at
speed
in
excess
of
the
Irish
average
.
why
be
that
still
the
situation
in
2009
?
will
there
be
another
takeover
of
Eircom
,
because
the
"
Australians
"
leave
it
in
a
dire
mess
and
with
a
severe
lack
of
investment
.
will
it
be
in
a
position
to
carry
out
its
public
service
remit
in
the
future
?
have
the
commission
have
any
contact
with
Eircom
to
discuss
its
future
in
recent
month
?
would
the
people
not
be
well
serve
if
Eircom
be
re-nationalise
so
that
one
could
achieve
the
aspiration
and
aim
that
be
set
out
in
the
presentation
?
as
long
as
Eircom
remain
as
it
be
,
the
country
will
be
at
a
severe
disadvantage
in
grow
the
economy
,
achieve
broadband
penetration
and
maximise
we
potential
in
term
of
new
platform
.
it
have
be
estimate
and
I
think
report
that
RTE
will
require
€
70
million
to
roll
out
digital
television
.
if
we
believe
the
report
of
the
cutback
,
it
would
appear
that
RTE
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
do
that
.
will
RTE
be
in
a
position
to
meet
its
obligation
to
roll
out
digital
television
,
and
if
not
will
it
incur
penalty
?
my
final
point
concern
postal
service
liberalisation
.
the
last
time
the
delegate
be
before
thie
committee
,
we
speak
about
the
Bolkestein
directive
.
what
be
its
current
position
?
will
we
see
complete
liberalisation
of
postal
service
?
will
a
Post
continue
to
be
the
sole
provider
of
postal
service
or
will
there
be
a
multiplicity
of
postal
service
provider
?
what
be
the
permutation
for
the
public
service
obligation
,
PSO
,
give
that
there
might
be
a
multiplicity
of
provider
in
the
postal
service
sector
?
the
concern
I
have
in
this
regard
be
base
on
whether
one
can
guarantee
that
the
service
for
people
live
in
rural
area
will
continue
into
the
future
if
there
be
a
multiplicity
of
player
in
the
market
.
if
there
be
further
deregulation
,
will
the
PSO
continue
to
be
maintain
and
protect
?
with
all
due
respect
,
the
country
go
to
the
market
in
regard
to
privatisation
.
Mr.
Doherty
be
tell
we
the
penetration
rate
be
62
%
.
there
be
exchange
which
have
not
be
upgrade
because
of
a
lack
of
investment
.
it
be
not
a
ideological
argument
at
this
stage
but
a
pragmatic
one
that
suggest
if
the
infrastructure
be
bring
back
within
its
control
,
the
State
can
invest
the
necessary
resource
to
allow
we
to
reach
the
rate
of
penetration
we
need
to
reach
in
order
to
compete
in
the
manner
we
all
want
to
compete
,
both
economically
and
globally
.
the
bottom
line
as
far
as
the
people
be
concerned
be
that
Eircom
have
fail
in
its
purpose
.
the
unbundling
of
the
local
loop
in
accordance
with
European
Union
legislation
have
not
be
a
success
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
the
market
would
not
go
near
Eircom
with
a
bargepole
such
be
the
state
it
be
in
.
I
do
not
understand
how
Mr.
Doherty
can
suggest
it
should
be
keep
within
the
market
structure
.
be
anybody
interested
in
Eircom
?
have
anybody
be
in
consultation
with
the
commission
in
that
regard
?
nobody
would
argue
against
that
but
be
Mr.
Doherty
say
the
national
broadband
scheme
will
deliver
the
rate
of
penetration
necessary
to
turn
the
white
area
of
the
map
into
red
area
?
do
Mr.
Doherty
think
that
,
in
this
day
and
age
,
one
meg
be
adequate
?
the
benchmark
be
much
too
low
here
and
the
policy
framework
for
broadband
,
on
whatever
platform
,
be
not
ambitious
enough
to
enable
we
to
compete
with
country
such
as
Japan
.
that
be
not
the
reality
for
people
live
in
rural
society
.
Mr.
Doherty
be
refer
to
conurbation
or
area
in
which
there
be
other
platform
but
the
capacity
be
not
available
in
certain
area
of
my
constituency
.
in
the
context
of
drive
the
rural
economy
certain
area
,
because
of
topography
or
geography
,
will
not
be
serve
by
that
speed
.
the
delegate
mention
WiMax
and
other
platform
that
will
evolve
over
time
and
I
welcome
they
but
when
will
we
sort
out
the
Eircom
mess
?
be
it
a
political
decision
?
do
ComReg
have
a
role
to
play
or
will
it
be
leave
to
the
vagary
of
the
market
?
if
it
be
the
latter
we
will
have
another
conversation
in
12
month
'
time
on
the
capacity
of
Eircom
to
meet
its
public
service
obligation
.

Doherty

I
join
other
member
in
welcoming
the
regulator
.
will
she
clarify
the
extent
of
she
power
and
competence
?
be
she
say
she
do
not
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
moratorium
on
the
issuance
of
licence
and
that
it
be
a
matter
for
the
government
or
the
minister
?
be
she
say
she
have
no
power
even
to
make
recommendation
in
that
regard
?
Ms
Doyle
refer
to
the
new
cd
and
manual
.
will
she
clarify
that
from
1
July
,
new
entrant
to
the
market
will
have
to
undergo
a
more
rigorous
examination
than
be
currently
the
case
?
will
exist
licence
holder
have
to
take
a
revise
examination
?
Driver
knowledge
be
still
severely
lack
,
particularly
in
Dublin
.
for
a
culchie
such
as
myself
who
use
the
city
taxi
service
intermittently
,
to
have
to
explain
how
to
get
to
Coolock
or
another
suburb
indicate
a
serious
lack
of
knowledge
among
some
driver
.
what
be
the
regulator
's
view
of
the
situation
in
London
,
where
there
be
a
rigorous
examination
process
for
driver
,
with
applicant
have
to
undergo
several
examination
stage
before
a
licence
be
grant
?
knowledge
of
the
city
be
of
paramount
importance
for
London
taxi
driver
.
do
the
regulator
envisage
similar
requirement
be
put
in
place
in
the
future
for
Dublin
taxi
driver
?
I
understand
the
cd
and
manual
include
a
skill
development
programme
.
I
admit
to
some
scepticism
in
this
regard
.
if
I
be
a
new
entrant
to
the
taxi
industry
drive
around
Mallow
town
,
for
example
,
the
likelihood
of
I
take
three
or
four
hour
to
read
a
manual
and
listen
to
a
cd
would
be
slim
.
what
information
do
this
tool
contain
that
will
add
qualitatively
to
one
's
experience
as
a
taxi
driver
?
what
be
the
cost
of
produce
they
?
I
represent
a
constituency
that
have
a
rural
and
urban
mix
.
it
be
characterise
by
provincial
town
,
some
of
which
be
almost
satellite
of
Cork
city
.
while
some
of
this
town
do
not
have
town
council
,
that
which
do
,
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
,
Cobh
,
Midleton
and
Youghal
,
be
encounter
problem
because
of
the
increase
in
the
number
of
licence
.
it
be
simply
impossible
to
provide
additional
space
in
taxi
rank
in
certain
town
centre
and
a
increase
of
two
or
three
licence
per
annum
in
a
town
such
as
Mallow
be
significant
in
term
of
the
number
of
people
who
be
ply
for
trade
in
off
-
peak
hour
.
the
issue
be
cause
tension
among
traffic
warden
and
taxi
licence
holder
.
incumbent
driver
who
work
on
a
full
-
time
basis
see
new
entrant
who
be
drive
part
time
or
not
park
correctly
.
be
the
regulator
liais
with
local
authority
in
regard
to
rectify
problem
of
this
nature
?
no
mention
be
make
in
the
presentation
of
the
number
of
plate
issue
to
cater
for
people
with
disability
.
the
Labour
Party
publish
a
document
which
recommend
a
initial
target
of
make
20
%
of
the
fleet
wheelchair
accessible
by
2012
and
a
long
term
objective
of
100
%
accessibility
.
how
near
be
the
current
fleet
to
meet
this
target
?
I
want
to
challenge
the
language
use
by
Ms
Doyle
.
she
state
that
there
be
a
decline
in
the
rate
of
new
entrant
relative
to
last
year
but
the
number
of
licence
be
issue
be
increase
.
in
County
Cork
,
the
number
of
license
vehicle
have
increase
from
2238
to
2382
and
driver
licence
have
increase
from
4,285
to
4,555
.
she
assert
that
light
touch
regulation
be
the
way
to
go
and
that
the
market
should
be
allow
to
settle
into
its
own
equilibrium
.
if
I
follow
through
on
the
logic
of
she
argument
,
the
rate
of
increase
will
probably
drop
to
zero
or
0.1
%
.
then
the
market
will
find
its
equilibrium
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
it
will
have
major
consequence
for
the
livelihood
of
people
in
full
-
time
employment
.
it
will
have
major
consequence
for
small
town
throughout
the
country
which
be
not
able
to
deal
with
the
extra
capacity
.
in
town
such
as
Mallow
,
where
more
than
50
licence
have
be
issue
,
the
number
of
taxi
be
have
a
major
impact
on
traffic
movement
in
the
town
and
be
cause
major
tension
for
the
exist
licence
holder
.
the
regulator
may
say
that
the
market
will
find
its
own
level
but
the
market
be
imperfect
because
one
cannot
apply
the
permutation
of
the
market
evenly
across
the
country
because
of
topography
and
geography
.
the
regulator
may
talk
about
Washington
DC
,
which
be
a
major
metropolitan
area
,
but
when
consider
the
issuance
of
licence
in
Ireland
,
one
must
take
account
of
have
too
many
licence
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
that
be
my
central
point
.
one
have
to
factor
that
into
the
model
when
issue
licence
.
one
cannot
take
a
global
figure
and
apply
it
globally
because
of
the
other
factor
that
be
not
be
take
into
account
.
have
the
regulator
refuse
a
licence
on
the
basis
of
the
negative
permutation
of
add
one
extra
licence
in
a
small
town
?
how
do
the
regulator
propose
to
tackle
the
issue
as
part
of
she
review
if
one
do
not
propose
the
number
of
licence
that
will
be
issue
?

Dáil
Chamber

have
read
the
submission
in
the
meantime
,
I
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Kelly
.
I
represent
part
of
County
Cork
and
the
strong
message
I
receive
from
local
authority
worker
,
particularly
in
the
north
of
the
county
,
be
that
the
burden
of
health
and
safety
legislation
and
regulation
be
imped
essential
maintenance
work
.
will
Mr.
O'Halloran
clarify
the
role
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
in
the
area
of
road
maintenance
as
oppose
to
construction
?
without
wish
to
raise
spurious
example
,
many
road
in
north
Cork
be
in
poor
state
and
require
work
to
be
do
to
fill
pothole
.
perhaps
I
be
lack
knowledge
in
this
respect
but
I
understand
a
crew
comprise
of
four
or
five
local
authority
personnel
which
wish
to
fill
a
pothole
must
first
erect
signage
on
both
approach
,
install
a
signalling
system
and
erect
bollard
.
this
be
ludicrous
.
I
be
not
aware
of
legislative
provision
require
such
measure
to
be
take
to
comply
with
health
and
safety
regulation
when
fill
a
pothole
.
health
and
safety
regulation
have
become
excessive
and
the
health
and
safety
industry
have
mushroom
in
the
past
decade
.
member
of
the
Oireachtas
be
legitimately
the
subject
of
remarkable
level
of
scrutiny
.
similar
scrutiny
should
apply
to
the
€
22.6
million
annual
budget
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
.
with
the
virtual
demise
of
the
construction
industry
in
recent
year
,
I
presume
the
agency
's
126
inspector
have
less
work
to
do
.
where
be
they
skill
be
employ
?
some
€
13.5
million
of
the
hsa
budget
be
expend
on
wage
,
while
€
2.2
million
be
spend
on
accommodation
and
€
1
million
alone
be
spend
on
travel
and
subsistence
.
this
figure
add
up
to
€
16.7
million
.
as
a
layman
in
this
matter
,
I
take
the
forthright
view
that
health
and
safety
legislation
place
a
undue
burden
on
the
ability
of
company
to
carry
out
work
.
we
have
lose
the
ability
to
employ
a
degree
of
common
sense
,
as
be
borne
out
by
my
point
that
a
whole
industry
have
grow
up
around
health
and
safety
legislation
.
perhaps
we
should
withdraw
some
of
the
burden
in
the
light
of
the
downturn
in
the
economy
.
the
issue
of
generic
accident
at
work
be
raise
,
particularly
in
agriculture
,
a
sector
in
which
I
have
a
particular
interest
.
many
of
this
accident
can
be
ascribe
to
human
error
.
I
do
not
agree
that
the
HSA
should
send
a
inspector
to
every
farm
.
adult
who
operate
a
business
must
assume
a
degree
of
responsibility
for
they
day
-
to
-
day
activity
.
while
I
sympathise
with
anyone
who
have
a
workplace
accident
-
God
know
,
I
be
aware
of
many
who
have
have
this
misfortune
-
there
be
a
degree
of
human
error
for
which
one
cannot
legislate
and
upon
which
one
should
not
impose
a
regulatory
regime
,
especially
one
which
cost
€
22.6
million
to
the
Exchequer
every
year
in
a
period
of
major
economic
contraction
.
I
be
raise
this
matter
to
elicit
a
opinion
from
Mr.
O'Halloran
.
there
may
be
a
valid
justification
for
the
authority
's
budget
in
the
current
climate
.
what
be
the
average
salary
of
a
field
inspector
?
a
distinction
be
make
between
policy
and
field
inspector
.
if
there
be
197
staff
,
of
whom
126
be
inspector
,
what
be
the
role
and
function
of
the
remain
71
employee
in
the
organisation
?
reference
be
make
to
a
judicial
review
in
connection
with
local
authority
.
I
do
not
understand
the
point
that
be
be
make
,
although
I
may
have
misheard
it
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
process
of
judicial
review
and
the
demarcation
between
the
role
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
and
that
of
local
authority
.
I
thank
the
delegate
.
in
the
value
for

report
,
the
economic
regulatory
unit
find
the
HSA
have
relatively
low
cost
compare
with
other
national
and
international
regulator
.
perhaps
the
hsa
would
be
kind
enough
to
forward
the
report
to
the
committee
.
we
would
appreciate
it
.
I
welcome
the
delegation

Ms
Smith
's
contribution
suggest
that
there
be
a
difference
in
approach
to
the
regulation
of
broker
compare
with
the
banking
sector
,
which
be
subject
to
a
light
touch
.
what
be
the
solution
?
PIBA
be
seek
one
primary
codify
set
of
regulation
embody
in
legislation
.
Ms
Smith
state
,
"
a
primary
objective
be
to
collate
all
applicable
legislative
requirement
and
then
provide
broker
with
guideline
to
assist
they
in
how
good
to
ensure
that
they
comply
with
all
legislative
obligation
in
they
day
-
to
-
day
business
"
.
be
current
regulation
weak
in
general
?
do
legislation
need
to
be
change
?
that
be
reasonable
.
the
committee
will
meet
the
regulator
shortly
and
we
should
address
this
issue
with
he
.
I
thank
PIBA
for
the
presentation

almost
every

take

I
welcome
the
delegation
to
the
committee
.
it
be
extraordinary
that
there
have
be
such
a
shift
in
the
language
from
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
.
we
be
now
into
the
language
of
corporate
governance
and
corporate
social
responsibility
,
trust
,
regulation
and
regain
of
trust
.
it
be
as
if
there
have
be
a
sea
change
in
term
of
attitude
within
the
banking
sector
.
if
the
story
on
the
ground
be
to
be
believe
,
it
would
appear
that
for
real
people
who
bank
in
this
country
there
have
be
absolutely
no
change
whatsoever
in
the
culture
and
that
the
small
business
and
the
like
continue
to
be
squeeze
.
why
be
it
that
the
bank
be
cut
off
credit
to
small
business
?
it
be
impossible
to
get
figure
.
if
I
line
up
100
people
,
small
business
,
I
can
guarantee
that
at
least
60
%
to
70
%
will
say
there
have
be
a
surreptitious
squeezing
of
they
credit
line
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
and
one
cannot
deny
it
.
I
ask
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
to
come
clean
about
it
and
state
why
it
be
do
it
,
how
long
it
will
continue
and
give
some
degree
of
transparency
to
that
notion
.
I
listen
carefully
to
what
the
witness
say
about
the
difference
between
the
consumer
mandate
and
the
prudential
mandate
in
term
of
supervision
.
they
say
that
the
consumer
mandate
be
prioritise
over
prudential
supervision
.
to
my
mind
,
that
be
another
way
of
hang
the
pre-exist
regulator
out
to
dry
.
I
do
not
believe
for
one
moment
that
the
witness
care
one
jot
about
the
whole
regulatory
regime
in
this
country
in
recent
year
because
,
metaphorically
speak
,
you
be
all
like
pig
at
a
trough
make
potload
of
money
and
the
whole
regulatory
regime
do
not
exist
.
I
remain
to
be
convince
as
to
whether
the
witness
be
genuine
when
they
say
they
will
buy
into
the
new
European
regulatory
framework
.
we
will
all
watch
Brussels
and
the
position
of
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
and
its
lobbying
arm
at
the
European
table
on
whether
it
will
buy
into
new
supervisory
EU
rule
.
it
remain
to
be
see
whether
it
be
genuine
in
that
regard
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
spv
again
because
I
do
not
quite
understand
the
answer
give
by
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
.
be
it
that
the
witness
do
not
fully
understand
the
nature
of
the
spv
as
it
relate
to
NAMA
or
that
they
have
not
be
give
any
direction
from
the
government
as
to
whether
the
bank
could
be
investor
in
the
private
segment
of
that
particular
vehicle
?
will
they
clarify
they
understanding
of
the
spv
at
present
?
if
they
say
they
be
not
sure
how
it
will
pan
out
,
then
it
beggar
belief
to
a
layman
like
I
that
a
chief
executive
of
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
would
come
before
a
Oireachtas
committee
and
state
that
.
in
regard
to
the
mutually
acceptable
arrangement
or
the
formal
agreement
with
MABS
,
will
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
and
the
bank
in
this
country
take
a
active
,
fiduciary
stake
to
ensure
that
MABS
will
be
able
to
operate
at
a
efficient
level
?
the
reason
I
ask
that
question
be
that
the
people
who
approach
I
with
mortgage
difficulty
,
whom
I
refer
to
MABS
,
have
to
wait
three
,
four
or
five
week
to
get
a
appointment
.
MABS
be
currently
at
the
pin
of
its
collar
.
I
be
sceptical
when
I
hear
banker
say
they
be
now
work
with
MABS
as
active
stakeholder
in
seek
to
ease
the
burden
for
people
who
find
themselves
in
financial
difficulty
.
if
the
witness
tell
I
there
be
formal
agreement
there
I
will
take
that
in
good
faith
.
if
the
bank
be
about
to
become
active
stakeholder
in
the
MABS
process
—
I
realise
we
be
talk
about
a
state
body
—
by
lend
personnel
or
make
a
financial
contribution
,
I
welcome
that
.
however
,
I
would
like
a
expansion
of
the
explanation
to
determine
the
qualitative
nature
of
the
relationship
.
Mr.
Farrell
state
that
there
have
be
21
repossession
,
but
how
many
application
for
repossession
have
the
bank
make
?
there
be
a
difference
between
the
number
of
repossession
in
a
particular
year
and
the
number
of
application
make
.
for
example
,
if
the
bank
be
about
to
repossess
my
house
tomorrow
morning
,
the
chance
be
that
I
would
go
to
see
my
bank
manager
on
a
informal
basis
and
we
would
seek
to
work
thing
out
.
the
distinction
between
application
and
actual
repossession
must
be
make
.
this
be
related
to
the
announcement
today
about
the
six
-
month
grace
period
for
mortgage
holder
who
cannot
meet
they
payment
.
I
give
credit
to
the
federation
for
state
it
would
extend
that
period
beyond
six
month
if
necessary
.
however
,
unless
it
be
put
on
a
statutory
basis
,
the
level
of
trust
in
the
bank
may
be
a
bit
sketchy
.
we
remain
doubtful
.
I
would
like
to
see
a
shift
in
corporate
social
responsibility
.
I
be
a
customer
of
a
bank
and
my
relationship
with
the
bank
on
a
local
level
be
quite
a
good
one
which
,
like
all
customer
,
I
have
build
over
time
.
however
,
for
many
people
at
the
moment
it
seem
to
be
a
one
-
way
street
.
I
do
not
think
customer
feel
,
necessarily
,
that
the
banking
regime
be
work
in
they
favour
in
assist
they
,
they
own
customer
,
in
get
out
of
the
difficulty
they
be
in
.
what
be
the
percentage
in
that
regard
?
Mr.
Farrell
be
say
he
be
sure
some
application
be
be
treat
in
certain
way
.
be
he
say
there
be
line
of
credit
extend
to
people
who
should
not
have
they
?
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
.
be
Mr.
Farrell
state
that
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
support
the
current
European
Commission
proposal
without
qualification
?
if
Mr.
Farrell
answer
the
question
about
the
number
of
application
for
repossession
I
be
sure
Mr.
O'Regan
can
tell
I
how
many
of
that
people
be
refer
to
MABS
in
the
first
instance
before
IBF
member
make
that
application
.
I
be
not
be
disingenuous
about
this
.
perhaps
Mr.
O'Regan
might
answer
my
question
on
the
number
of
application
for
repossession
.
if
Mr.
O'Regan
can
say
that
definitively
then
he
can
give
I
the
number
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
,
will
speak
in
great
detail
on
this
.
we
be
try
to
establish
how
it
might
be
possible
to
ease
the
burden
for
mortgage
holder
who
find
themselves
suddenly
unemployed
.
give
what
we
have
read
about
the
banking
sector
and
the
going
on
in
recent
year
I
must
have
a
sense
that
I
can
go
back
to
my
constituent
in
Cork
East
and
tell
they
with
some
degree
of
confidence
that
if
they
find
themselves
in
trouble
with
they
mortgage
there
be
a
good
chance
the
new
six
-
month
regime
will
work
.
because
of
the
level
of
mistrust
of
the
banking
sector
at
present
there
be
still
question
about
that
process
and
whether
it
will
work
if
it
be
not
put
on
a
statutory
footing
.
that
be
all
back
office
work
.
it
do
not
have
a
trading
floor
in
Dublin
.
with
all
due
respect
,
you
work
for
that
company
.
I
would
like
to
respond
to
that
for
fear
my
remark
be
misinterpret
.
I
be
very
mindful
of
the
fact
that
we
need
to
protect
job
in
the
financial
service
sector
,
I
work
in
that
sector
.
I
be
concerned
about
the
damage
that
have
be
do
to
we
international
reputation
by
practice
in
the
banking
sector
.
that
be
where
I
be
come
from
.

I
apologise
for
cut
across
deputy
O'Donnell
but
how
do
Professor
Honohan
see
this
fund
be
recover
?
I
welcome
Professor
Honohan
to
the
committee
and
congratulate
he
on
he
appointment
.
I
have
witness
a
perceptible
shift
today
in
the
language
to
which
we
have
become
accustomed
from
official
when
deal
with
the
financial
crisis
,
something
which
must
be
acknowledge
.
I
do
not
wish
to
denigrate
other
official
in
any
way
for
the
language
they
use
,
but
we
be
now
in
a
era
where
we
want
thing
to
be
explain
to
we
by
official
such
as
Professor
Honohan
in
a
manner
which
everybody
can
understand
and
which
be
frank
.
that
be
important
for
the
future
.
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
Professor
Honohan
be
answer
this
question
honestly
and
openly
.
it
be
refresh
.
I
hope
,
when
we
look
forward
to
the
quarterly
Central
Bank
report
,
that
if
there
be
whisperings
of
bad
omen
on
the
wind
they
be
not
bury
imperceptibly
in
language
in
the
report
and
be
back
up
by
strong
language
from
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
,
if
that
be
a
necessary
course
of
action
.
I
wish
to
return
to
the
issue
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
I
have
to
ask
a
question
on
behalf
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
who
I
represent
.
like
many
people
throughout
the
country
,
they
be
ask
why
,
in
the
name
of
God
,
be
we
bail
out
Anglo
Irish
Bank
and
nationalise
it
?
I
do
not
think
that
question
be
answer
sufficiently
.
I
appreciate
that
the
decision
be
make
and
that
Professor
Honohan
be
come
from
a
academic
background
—
he
have
state
that
—
but
be
now
a
banker
.
as
he
be
a
banker
I
would
like
a
honest
view
on
whether
we
should
cast
it
adrift
.
if
the
capitalist
model
into
which
we
have
buy
in
this
country
be
to
be
follow
logically
,
whatever
about
AIB
and
Bank
of
Ireland
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
which
suggest
Anglo
Irish
Bank
should
be
let
off
.
the
€
4
billion
and
the
€
4
billion
eile
it
be
look
for
will
cast
a
noose
around
the
neck
of
Irish
people
which
we
will
have
to
wear
for
a
long
time
.
my
second
question
relate
to
the
issue
of
prudential
rule
.
in
he
open
statement
,
Professor
Honohan
say
,
"
there
have
be
greatly
intensify
and
what
have
be
term
"
intrusive
"
supervision
of
the
operation
of
the
main
bank
cover
by
the
guarantee
"
.
if
I
read
this
sentence
one
way
,
it
could
suggest
"
intrusive
"
be
negative
,
but
if
read
another
way
it
could
be
positive
.
it
be
negative
in
that
the
exist
staff
in
the
bank
which
be
cover
by
the
guarantee
be
not
too
happy
about
the
intrusive
nature
of
the
new
staffing
arrangement
with
Professor
Honohan
's
people
.
be
that
cause
friction
?
if
so
,
why
be
it
cause
friction
?
will
it
need
to
continue
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
until
this
issue
be
work
out
?
how
long
will
the
situation
continue
for
?
the
new
prudential
rule
which
will
come
into
force
will
be
largely
determine
by
Brussels
and
the
European
Union
.
the
fear
I
have
be
that
the
Irish
government
,
as
be
often
the
case
,
will
follow
the
City
of
London
or
the
Government
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
in
term
of
prudential
rule
regard
financial
service
.
if
we
be
to
be
realistic
about
overhaul
prudential
rule
in
the
future
,
and
if
there
be
a
majority
view
which
be
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
United
Kingdom
,
we
should
take
a
very
responsible
position
.
I
would
like
to
hear
Professor
Honohan
's
view
on
the
matter
.
on
the
macro
situation
,
last
night
a
minister
say
on
television
that
at
least
we
be
not
Greece
and
that
we
should
look
at
how
bad
thing
be
there
,
which
be
a
extraordinary
statement
.
if
we
be
now
be
compare
with
Greece
,
we
know
thing
be
really
bad
.
be
there
a
role
for
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
vis
-à
-
vis
the
European
Central
Bank
,
in
term
of
influence
monetary
policy
in
particular
,
and
fiscal
policy
?
I
be
not
necessarily
espouse
that
but
I
want
to
get
a
view
on
the
theory
that
a
devaluation
of
the
currency
would
sort
out
some
of
we
problem
.
I
be
look
for
a
macro
view
but
I
would
also
like
to
hear
Professor
Honohan
's
personal
opinion
on
that
.
on
the
issue
of
remuneration
,
will
the
staff
of
the
Central
Bank
and
Financial
Service
Authority
be
take
a
pay
cut
?
I
refer
Mr.
Honohan
to
the
Financial
emergency
Measures
in
the
Public
Interest
(
no.
2
)
Bill
2009
be
debate
in
the
House
as
we
speak
.
the
schedule
to
that
Bill
clearly
show
that
the
Central
Bank
and
Financial
Service
Authority
of
Ireland
be
body
to
which
the
definition
of
"
public
service
body
"
do
not
apply
.
that
body
be
exclude
from
the
schedule
to
the
Financial
emergency
Measures
in
the
Public
Interest
Act
and
presumably
they
be
subject
to
the
levy
impose
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
that
legislation
.
my
question
be
whether
Mr.
Honohan
will
be
take
a
hair
cut
—
that
term
have
be
use
—
and
,
if
not
,
why
not
?
in
Mr.
Honohan
's
opinion
,
why
have
the
Central
Bank
and
Financial
Service
Authority
of
Ireland
be
include
in
the
schedule
to
the
no.
2
Bill
when
it
be
not
previously
?
be
the
minister
for
Finance
lobby
in
regard
to
that
issue
?
I
raise
this
issue
because
the
previous
regulator
,
and
this
must
be
restate
,
get
out
of
Dodge
with
approximately
€
600,000
in
he
back
pocket
.
a
constituent
of
mine
would
ask
I
this
question
and
how
he
manage
to
do
that
.
if
public
sector
worker
,
for
instance
,
who
be
on
€30000
a
year
be
take
a
haircut
of
€
1500
as
per
the
legislation
propose
today
,
why
be
body
like
the
regulatory
body
not
do
the
same
?
I
have
a
number
of
question
and
I
ask
for
some
leeway
from
the
chair
.
be
any
man
or
woman
worth
that
amount
of
money
?
Professor
Honohan
will
talk
about
the
relativity
of
take
the
pay
cut
vis
-à-
vis
—
—
he
would
not
have
come
for
less
.
how
be
this
country
still
in
a
scenario
where
we
be
pay
that
kind
of
money
to
people
to
overhaul
a
regulatory
framework
give
that
the
European
Union
regulatory
framework
will
be
overhaul
and
there
will
be
a
large
buy
-
in
by
the
Irish
State
into
that
process
anyway
?
it
could
be
do
for
a
considerably
reduce
cost
than
the
princely
sum
of
€
400000
plus
the
bonus
if
he
reach
a
target
.
we
need
to
move
away
from
the
culture
of
spend
that
kind
of
money
on
public
official
when
there
be
other
people
in
the
State
who
be
take
savage
cut
.
it
do
not
make
sense
to
ordinary
people
.
ordinary
people
will
look
at
that
and
say
it
be
obscene
.
I
will
park
that
issue
and
respectfully
agree
to
disagree
with
Mr.
Honohan
.
in
a
pre-guarantee
scenario---
in
a
pre-guarantee
scenario
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
that
Anglo
Irish
Bank
be
a
fail
entity
and
that
one
should
have
cast
it
adrift
.
while
there
would
have
be
a
tremor
,
the
systemic
effect
for
the
economy
as
a
whole
would
arguably
not
have
be
too
high
on
the
Richter
scale
.
I
appreciate
that
and
I
suppose
we
be
try
to
look
to
the
future
.
with
that
in
mind
,
do
Professor
Honohan
feel
he
have
perfect
knowledge
as
to
what
be
go
on
within
Anglo
Irish
Bank
?
my
other
question
be
about
Greece
.
if
we
buy
into
that
scenario
—
and
arguably
the
main
political
party
have
buy
into
that
agenda
—
the
question
that
be
still
outstanding
for
people
of
my
generation
,
who
have
take
on
massive
amount
of
debt
,
be
that
the
debt
be
not
be
restructure
in
any
great
shape
or
fashion
,
but
wage
be
come
down
significantly
.
there
be
a
real
problem
there
.
we
be
try
to
get
to
the
nub
of
the
situation
.
if
one
have
a
statutory
pension
scheme
then
arguably
one
will
provide
a
great
degree
of
security
for
people
.
if
there
be
a
code
of
conduct
,
however
,
there
be
nothing
to
suggest
at
this
stage
that
the
bank
will
adhere
to
any
kind
of
code
.
it
concern
the
operation
of
the
mortgage
moratorium
where
somebody
find
himself
or
herself
in
trouble
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
mortgage
interest
relief
be
necessarily
the
only
way
to
go
.
that
will
provide
some
relief
,
but
there
will
be
a
certain
number
of
people
who
cannot
repay
mortgage
.
for
instance
,
when
this
Bill
be
enact
,
which
it
invariably
will
be
,
a
certain
percentage
of
the
population
earn
€
40000
or
less
,
will
no
long
be
able
to
pay
they
mortgage
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
price
be
fall
in
the
economy
.
that
will
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
.
they
remain
to
be
convince
that
the
banking
structure
,
as
it
currently
exist
,
will
adequately
give
they
a
break
if
they
find
themselves
in
difficulty
and
start
miss
payment
,
which
they
invariably
will
after
this
on
Thursday
.
I
appreciate
that
Professor
Honohan
be
not
necessarily
in
a
position
to
comment
on
the
legislation
that
be
go
ahead
,
but
from
a
layman
's
point
of
view
,
and
anecdotal
evidence
of
that
who
be
now
in
real
financial
difficulty
,
there
be
a
perception
that
the
bank
be
get
off
lightly
in
term
of
put
together
something
that
would
give
people
a
break
on
they
mortgage
.
if
we
increase
capitalisation
,
that
scenario
will
prove
to
be
the
case
.

on
page
7
,
the
submission
state
:
"
we
concern
in
this
regard
have
already
be
heighten
by
the
recent
news
that
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
,
when
recruit
,
will
report
to
the
newly
appoint
assistant
director
general
for
financial
supervision
in
general
,
rather
than
the
Director
General
or
ceo
,
as
be
currently
the
case
.
"
on
page
9
it
state
:
"
in
light
of
this
,
the
ILCU
board
be
propose
that
a
new
independent
credit
union
regulator
be
establish
under
the
auspices
of
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
.
"
even
if
the
regulatory
regime
be
such
that
the
ILCU
report
directly
to
a
director
general
under
the
auspices
of
the
Central
Bank
,
what
be
the
difference
between
that
and
a
new
regulatory
regime
under
the
auspices
of
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
?
we
all
recognise
the
role
of
credit
union
and
the
amazing
work
they
do
.
as
deputy
Ardagh
say
,
they
have
provide
a
backbone
for
many
community
because
they
etho
be
very
different
from
that
of
bank
and
other
financial
institution
.
we
want
to
find
a
compromise
that
will
ensure
the
future
growth
of
the
credit
union
movement
and
put
in
place
a
regulatory
regime
that
ensure
there
be
confidence
.
if
the
new
regulatory
regime
be
under
the
Central
Bank
would
it
not
be
a
safe
house
,
give
that
the
regulatory
regime
should
change
for
the
good
once
the
de
Larosière
and
European
Commission
proposal
be
introduce
?
with
regard
to
the
availability
of
credit
,
the
credit
union
movement
have
a
particular
view
on
section
35
of
the
act
.
I
understand
section
35
provide
that
not
more
than
20
%
of
credit
union
's
loan
book
may
be
out
on
loan
for
long
than
five
year
.
in
this
constrain
time
when
vast
number
of
people
seek
to
reschedule
they
loan
,
do
this
have
a
negative
impact
on
credit
union
's
ability
to
deliver
a
surplus
,
operate
properly
or
allow
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
for
ordinary
member
throughout
the
country
who
might
want
to
reschedule
?
have
the
minister
give
any
consideration
to
amend
section
35
to
allow
for
that
so
that
the
people
who
take
out
the
car
loan
and
who
cannot
make
payment
can
extend
the
life
of
the
loan
?
currently
they
be
hamper
from
do
so
because
section
35
have
not
be
amend
.
what
be
the
view
of
the
delegate
on
that
?
I
understand
a
submission
have
be
make
in
this
regard
,
but
we
be
unaware
of
the
position
on
that
currently
.
have
the
minister
give
a
specific
date
for
that
order
?
with
respect
for
the
submission
make
,
I
have
yet
to
be
convinced
.
we
all
recognise
that
a
different
etho
exist
within
the
credit
union
movement
from
that
which
create
the
fiasco
that
be
the
banking
crisis
,
with
some
notable
exception
within
the
credit
union
movement
.
however
,
as
a
percentage
of
overall
credit
union
activity
,
the
less
than
kosher
practice
use
in
some
credit
union
seem
minuscule
.
by
and
large
we
all
agree
credit
union
be
well
marshal
because
of
the
individual
etho
of
member
and
board
at
local
level
who
do
a
great
job
in
ensure
the
etho
be
maintain
.
however
,
if
the
movement
be
to
convince
I
,
as
one
humble
member
of
this
committee
,
that
it
should
have
a
independent
regulator
,
it
would
need
to
make
a
strong
case
for
inclusion
under
the
current
central
bank
commission
than
that
it
be
separate
from
the
banking
regime
.
the
change
that
will
come
down
the
line
in
that
regard
will
be
stringent
.
if
the
credit
union
movement
,
where
the
regulatory
regime
be
already
quite
strong
,
be
within
that
framework
,
I
do
not
see
how
this
would
be
a
problem
for
they
.
I
suppose
the
dispute
be
always
on
what
side
of
the
Cork
-
Kerry
border
the
credit
union
movement
be
found
.
we
,
on

Cork
side

Ballydesmond
,

it

delegation
to

committee
meeting

at
the
last
meeting
the
credit
union
's
role
in
society
be
acknowledge
.
be
there
a
gulf
in
the
position
on
the
regulatory
framework
between
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
and
the
CUDA
?
I
remain
to
be
convince
about
the
ILCU
's
position
.
the
only
way
one
can
guarantee
that
individual
member
have
maximum
security
for
they
deposit
be
through
the
auspices
of
the
Central
Bank
commission
.
the
open
statement
state
:
"
CUDA
believe
the
current
structure
be
appropriate
.
the
performance
and
future
development
of
credit
union
need
to
be
underpin
by
a
properly
resource
,
separate
and
differentiate
system
of
statutory
regulation
for
the
credit
union
sector
within
the
overall
Central
Bank
and
the
Department
of
Finance
structure
.
"
will
the
delegation
clarify
exactly
what
this
mean
?
the
CUDA
obviously
recognise
the
role
of
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
but
it
be
also
seek
to
differentiate
between
its
role
and
that
of
the
bank
while
keep
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
.
be
the
credit
union
happy
report
to
the
assistant
director
general
under
the
Financial
Regulator
's
office
?
would
it
suggest
any
modification
to
this
system
?
Mr.
Mark
Bailey
of
the
ILCU
tell
I
at
the
last
meeting
that
it
have
be
in
negotiation
with
the
Department
concern
the
provision
govern
the
percentage
and
period
for
loan
in
section
35
of
the
credit
Union
Act
1997
.
he
say
the
minister
will
shortly
sign
a
order
which
will
increase
the
percentage
provision
to
30
%
.
some
people
I
have
speak
to
informally
about
this
have
reservation
about
it
from
a
liquidity
perspective
.
it
be
important
the
committee
flesh
this
out
if
it
be
go
to
take
a
rational
long
-
term
view
on
it
.
how
would
such
a
proposal
impact
on
the
CUDA
?
it
represent
275000
credit
union
member
through
11
credit
union
.
credit
union
offer
mainstream
financial
service
include
savings
,
loan
,
various
insurance
,
foreign
exchange
,
ATM
card
,
electronic
fund
transfer
payment
,
child
benefit
and
social
welfare
payment
,
mortgage
in
limited
case
and
other
mainstream
financial
service
.
it
be
impossible
to
see
how
anyone
can
justify
a
different
regime
of
regulation
for
one
set
of
industry
operative
such
as
bank
and
building
society
and
argue
for
a
less
form
of
protection
to
apply
to
credit
union
when
they
be
deal
in
the
exact
same
product
.
ultimately
,
the
committee
be
leave
with
the
ILCU
,
representative
of
the
majority
of
credit
union
,
and
the
CUDA
.
the
committee
want
a
system
that
both
body
will
buy
into
and
that
will
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
increase
the
loan
percentage
allow
from
20
%
to
30
%
would
allow
a
credit
union
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
in
individual
loan
.
for
instance
,
if
I
have
a
car
loan
with
my
credit
union
but
be
put
to
the
pin
of
my
collar
financially
,
I
could
extend
the
loan
's
lifetime
.
what
be
the
permutation
for
individual
credit
union
?
if
there
be
still
difficulty
with
extend
it
by
10
%
,
what
be
the
optimal
solution
?
section
35
need
to
be
clarify
then
.
the
extension
from
20
%
to
30
%
be
not
provide
the
panacea
.
the
committee
may
need
further
clarification
on
this
matter
from
departmental
official
or
the
minister
about
this
proposal
.
I

the

be
CUNA
Mutual
Europe
a
commercial
company
?
what
do
CUNA
stand
for
?
I
will
be
blunt
.
when
I
read
sentence
such
as
,
"
it
do
not
permit
stakeholder
a
opportunity
to
show
flexibility
in
the
application
of
regulatory
instruction
or
a
measurement
of
appropriateness
in
its
interpretation
"
,
I
can
understand
it
but
will
the
delegate
give
a
layman
's
view
?
we
have
have
representative
of
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
before
we
and
will
receive
representation
from
manager
shortly
.
we
be
try
to
listen
to
as
many
stakeholder
as
possible
.
we
be
try
to
get
a
view
on
section
35
,
for
example
,
and
the
current
regulatory
regime
.
the
delegate
have
speak
about
opportunity
to
show
flexibility
.
in
the
context
of
Irish
legislation
,
do
this
mean
amend
section
35
of
the
credit
Union
Act
?
when
speak
about
the
appropriateness
of
interpretation
,
do
this
refer
to
section
35
or
something
completely
different
?
the
two
issue
in
which
I
have
a
particular
interest
concern
section
35
of
the
act
and
the
current
regulatory
regime
.
there
be
one
school
of
thought
which
suggest
it
must
be
under
the
auspices
of
the
regulator
's
office
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
.
however
,
there
be
another
school
of
thought
which
suggest
it
should
be
a
function
of
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
or
other
such
Department
.
I
be
try
to
get
the
delegate
's
view
and
ascertain
whether
we
should
be
move
towards
the
Australian
model
.
be
we
okay
where
we
be
?
if
CUNA
be
the
body
for
credit
union
in
North
America
,
I
presume
the
model
in
place
there
be
not
dissimilar
to
the
one
in
place
here
.
will
the
delegate
explain
the
difference
from
the
punter
's
perspective
?
in
the
Irish
context
the
guy
on
the
street
will
use
a
credit
union
to
take
out
a
car
loan
.
do
the
credit
union
in
North
America
serve
a
similar
function
,
or
be
it
a
more
extensive
function
more
like
a
banking
facility
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
be
CUNA
Mutual
Europe
's
aim
for
we
to
move
in
that
direction
?
where
do
it
see
itself
relative
to
the
ILCU
and
other
representative
credit
union
organisation
?
on

the

I
wish
thank
the
official
for
appear
before
the
committee
.
on
a
first
reading
of
the
submission
,
it
appear
that
Mr.
Kearns
be
talk
common
sense
in
term
of
the
approach
to
prudential
supervision
,
the
stabilisation
fund
and
the
need
for
some
degree
of
flexibility
in
section
35
.
while
the
minister
seem
to
be
sympathetic
to
people
who
find
themselves
constrain
by
the
fact
that
they
loan
have
finite
term
limit
,
and
one
need
to
reflect
the
reality
of
people
's
life
by
extend
the
lifetime
of
a
loan
,
the
question
now
arise
as
to
the
effect
that
will
have
on
liquidity
ratio
and
so
forth
.
I
would
like
to
hear
a
view
from
the
official
to
flesh
that
out
and
explain
in
practical
term
what
the
minister
or
the
Department
might
propose
on
section
35
for
allow
people
to
have
more
flexibility
,
but
without
affect
a
credit
union
's
own
liquidity
ratio
.
how
will
they
get
around
that
particular
issue
?
I
acknowledge
that
thing
have
move
on
significantly
since
the
McDowell
report
.
in
he
statement
,
Mr.
Kearns
say
that
"
recognise
this
factor
,
the
government
decision
of
June
2009
on
the
reform
of
financial
regulatory
structure
determine
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
positioning
of
the
Registrar
of
credit
union
within
the
framework
of
the
new
,
integrate
structure
for
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Financial
Regulator
"
.
to
be
clear
,
do
that
mean
that
the
regulation
of
credit
union
will
remain
within
the
ambit
or
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
will
the
reporting
procedure
be
change
in
any
way
?
for
instance
,
will
the
registrar
report
directly
to
the
head
of
financial
regulation
,
or
be
it
propose
that
the
registrar
will
report
directly
to
the
assistant
director
general
?
give
the
nature
of
credit
union
,
and
the
differentiation
that
we
make
between
bank
and
not
-
for
-
profit
friendly
society
whose
surplus
be
redistribute
,
could
we
make
a
case
that
the
reporting
procedure
would
be
such
that
they
would
report
directly
to
the
Financial
Regulator
?
that
cover
section
35
and
the
reporting
mechanism
.
be
it
now
propose
that
the
review
will
examine
the
stabilisation
fund
with
a
view
to
bring
all
credit
union
,
no
matter
what
they
size
,
into
that
remit
?
how
will
that
play
out
in
practical
term
?
Mr.
Kearns
say
the
Minister
for
Finance
have
state
that
he
prefer
option
be
to
have
a
proof
stabilisation
arrangement
in
place
for
all
credit
union
in
addition
to
have
the
deposit
guarantee
scheme
in
place
.
there
be
a
double
effect
then
with
the
stabilisation
fund
,
so
how
be
it
envisage
that
the
stabilisation
fund
will
work
for
small
credit
union
which
would
not
be
operate
on
the
same
economy
of
scale
as
large
one
?
I
would
be
glad
if
Mr.
Kearns
could
tease
out
that
point
.
Mr.
Kearns
state
they
will
look
for
specific
recommendation
.
will
they
come
from
the
sector
itself
or
will
he
make
recommendation
?
what
about
the
reporting
mechanism
and
section
35
?
the
reporting
procedure
could
be
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
commission
itself
.
I
take
it
there
be
ongoing
engagement
in
regard
to
this
stabilisation
fund
and
the
section
35
provision
.
be
it
a
open
-
end
process
?
I
presume
a
sunset
have
be
put
on
it
.
when
be
it
propose
to
wrap
up
that
process
?
be
Mr.
MacDonncha
refer
to
the
case
in
which
somebody
default
on
a
credit
union
loan
?
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
lead
the
joint
committee
to
believe
that
this
measure
could
be
introduce
by
way
of
ministerial
order
.
that
,
at
least
,
be
my
interpretation
of
the
league
's
submission
.
my
question
be
subjective
and
,
as
such
,
I
understand
if
the

answer
it

could
the
league

be

advertently

interpretation

its
consultation

I
welcome
the
representative
of
the
Irish
stock
Exchange
.
I
want
to
continue
in
the
same
vein
as
deputy
O'Donnell
.
I
be
try
to
gain
a
good
understanding
of
we
regulatory
position
,
particularly
regard
the
activity
of
stockbroker
.
if
I
understand
the
matter
correctly
,
the
market
in
financial
instrument
directive
have
actually
leave
a
gap
in
the
regulatory
framework
as
it
relate
to
non-consumer
activity
.
in
other
word
,
stockbroker
may
not
be
investigate
by
the
Irish
stock
Exchange
in
regard
to
certain
type
of
activity
.
if
I
be
wrong
,
I
stand
correct
.
will
the
delegate
flesh
out
the
matter
in
layman
's
term
?
I
make
this
point
because
the
delegate
's
submission
state
:
it
be
important
to
note
that
MiFID
do
not
provide
a
explicit
mechanism
for
investigate
non-consumer
complaint
against
provider
of
financial
service
,
include
stockbroker
.
as
the
definition
of
"
consumer
"
in
Irish
legislation
be
relatively
narrow
,
the
exchange
be
concerned
that
this
previously
available
mechanism
be
to
be
remove
.
I
presume
it
be
still
remove
but
house
under
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Financial
Regulator
.
be
it
non-existent
?
that
clarify
the
issue
.
I
appreciate
the
clarification
.
with
regard
to
report
mechanism
or
the
ongoing
communication
between
the
Financial
Regulator
and
the
Irish
stock
Exchange
,
it
appear
there
be
a
weakness
in
the
communication
strategy
.
be
it
the
case
that
there
be
potential
for
a
positive
role
for
the
Irish
stock
Exchange
in
strengthen
the
regulatory
framework
but
that
it
be
leave
it
to
the
Financial
Regulator
to
effect
change
?
there
seem
to
be
no
formal
communication
network
or
strategy
.
will
the
delegation
give
I
a
sense
of
whether
this
be
correct
?
that
have
clarify
the
matter
.
I
ask
for
short
sell
to
be
put
on
the
agenda
precisely
because
the
ban
have
be
lift
in
other
jurisdiction
.
I
accept
the
explanation
of
the
Irish
stock
Exchange
in
this
regard
.
we
all
accept
,
on
some
level
,
that
it
be
a
necessary
function
in
term
of
liquidity
provision
.
that
be
a
give
but
it
be
a
matter
of
how
the
instrument
be
use
in
particular
jurisdiction
.
in
we
jurisdiction
,
it
give
rise
to
certain
question
.
with
regard
to
the
disclosure
regime
,
Ms
Somer
state
:
a
degree
of
stability
have
return
to
the
market
and
many
regulator
have
withdraw
the
ban
that
be
impose
,
replace
they
for
the
most
part
with
disclosure
regime
.
however
,
the
Irish
market
be
unique
[...
]
.
for
this
reason
,
withdraw
the
ban
in
a
similar
manner
to
other
jurisdiction
be
not
necessarily
the
correct
decision
for
Ireland
at
this
time
.
however
,
in
Ms
Somer
's
conclusion
,
she
state
the
replacement
of
the
short
-
sell
ban
with
a
move
to
a
Irish
approach
consistent
with
a
harmonise
European
disclosure
regime
may
be
the
correct
approach
.
could
a
disclosure
regime
operate
accord
to
a
pan-European
rule
-
base
approach
be
introduce
to
the
Irish
market
?
while
no
one
have
a
crystal
ball
when
it
come
to
share
performance
,
do
the
stock
Exchange
see
any
semblance
of
a
recovery
in
the
market
?
how
many
company
will
ride
the
storm
,
be
consolidate
or
go
to
the
wall
?
I

O'Connor

I
welcome
Ms
Gilleece
and
Mr.
Molan
to
the
committee
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
cabinet
reshuffle
be
take
precedence
today
.
I
welcome
the
presentation
which
be
direct
and
unequivocal
.
the
language
be
not
code
in
any
way
and
clearly
set
out
the
intention
and
aspiration
of
CUMA
.
that
be
what
we
need
to
hear
in
the
committee
.
a
number
of
disparate
view
have
be
express
on
the
application
of
section
35
and
on
the
regulatory
regime
.
there
be
a
clear
divide
between
the
credit
Union
manager
Association
,
CUMA
,
and
the
ILCU
with
regard
to
the
regulatory
framework
.
have
CUMA
a
criticism
to
make
with
regard
to
the
ILCU
proposal
to
have
the
regulatory
framework
house
under
a
Department
?
if
I
remember
correctly
,
the
ILCU
attest
that
the
regulatory
framework
for
credit
union
should
be
outside
of
the
Central
Bank
commission
.
the
only
route
to
take
be
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
commission
,
but
how
that
be
finess
be
a
matter
for
discussion
.
I
take
the
same
view
as
CUMA
with
regard
to
a
direct
reporting
system
to
the
head
of
financial
regulation
rather
than
to
a
sub
-
head
or
assistant
director
.
if
we
be
to
recognise
the
importance
of
the
credit
union
and
the
primacy
of
its
role
within
society
,
it
must
be
give
due
recognition
with
regard
to
the
reporting
role
.
that
be
common
sense
.
what
be
the
CUMA
position
with
regard
to
the
ILCU
position
?
I
be
amazed
that
CUMA
be
not
part
of
the
working
group
on
section
35
,
as
I
be
give
to
understand
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
would
be
actively
involved
in
the
process
.
bear
that
in
mind
and
base
on
what
CUMA
have
say
about
the
section
35
working
group
and
the
indebtedness
work
group
,
the
committee
should
take
a
strong
stance
with
regard
to
CUMA
membership
of
both
of
that
working
group
.
if
we
be
to
achieve
anything
from
this
meeting
,
the
committee
should
request
the
minister
,
or
demand
of
he
if
that
be
within
we
remit
,
to
involve
CUMA
in
that
two
working
group
.
this
make
sense
.
CUMA
be
make
up
of
credit
union
manager
and
it
would
be
remiss
not
to
involve
it
as
part
of
the
working
group
.
section
35
be
the
big
issue
.
CUMA
have
set
out
clearly
the
permutation
for
the
ordinary
credit
union
member
.
while
CUMA
be
not
part
of
the
section
35
working
group
,
it
appear
from
its
submission
that
it
have
a
insight
into
the
proposal
.
what
be
the
optimum
solution
with
regard
to
section
35
?
CUMA
have
outline
its
critique
of
the
section
,
in
term
of
the
20
%
of
the
loan
book
over
five
year
provision
and
whether
this
be
effective
in
term
of
the
liquidity
scenario
for
a
give
credit
union
.
what
direction
should
the
minister
take
on
section
35
?
if
CUMA
be
to
write
or
amend
the
legislation
or
the
particular
section
,
how
would
it
do
that
?
CUMA
's
submission
make
sense
.
we
need
common
sense
in
term
of
the
approach
the
regulatory
framework
should
take
and
in
term
of
section
35
.
CUMA
be
speak
my
language
on
this
matter
.
however
,
if
I
be
to
push
a
position
along
the
line
of
a
unequivocal
analysis
of
section
35
with
regard
to
what
CUMA
would
like
to
see
occur
,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
I
and
member
of
the
committee
to
have
CUMA
's
view
on
what
should
be
do
.
Ms
Gilleece
mention
the
withdrawal
of
banking
service
.
do
CUMA
aspire
to
fill
a
gap
and
expand
its
service
even
further
?
the
ordinary
layman
be
concerned
that
credit
union
will
become
de
facto
bank
and
,
therefore
,
lose
some
of
they
etho
.
I
do
not
have
particular
concern
about
that
,
but
it
be
something
that
may
be
say
.
if
that
be
its
aspiration
,
how
far
do
CUMA
want
to
take
it
?
at
what
point
might
it
stop
be
a
organisation
with
a
duty
of
care
?
it
be
state
that
every
financial
institution
have
a
duty
of
care
to
its
stakeholder
,
depositor
or
whatever
,
but
that
be
not
always
the
case
in
reality
.
I
would
like
to
understand
the
aspiration
and
whether
we
be
talk
about
a
potential
reshaping
of
the
credit
union
movement
or
whether
the
original
etho
will
be
protect
.
be
there
a
danger
the
etho
could
falter
?
I
would
like
to
understand
and
get
some
sense
of
CUMA
's
aspiration
.
I
presume
the
period
of
26
week
be
not
arbitrary
but
be
base
on
calculation
of
a
person
's
ability
to
meet
he
or
she
obligation
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
appear
before
the
committee
.
we
look
forward
to
further
discuss
the
issue
of
credit
union
.

I
welcome
the
former
Registrar
of
credit
Union
.
he
be
certainly
not
pull
any
punch
,
which
we
welcome
.
sometimes
what
be
need
be
plain
language
.
be
Mr.
Logue
aware
that
the
Central
Bank
Reform
Bill
have
be
publish
?
what
be
he
view
on
the
section
35
issue
we
have
be
address
here
in
recent
week
?
Mr.
Logue
's
submission
refer
to
the
appointment
of
officer
through
the
AGM
.
be
he
suggest
that
there
should
be
change
to
that
mechanism
?
while
he
will
forgive
I
if
I
be
misinterpret
what
he
say
,
perhaps
he
view
be
that
the
person
appoint
be
the
low
common
denominator
,
but
he
or
she
might
not
always
be
the
right
person
for
a
job
on
a
board
.
any
credit
union
board
member
I
have
ever
meet
be
appoint
because
he
or
she
have
a
significant
body
of
experience
and
know
he
or
she
individual
credit
union
intimately
.
be
he
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
regulatory
framework
for
the
appointment
of
particular
officer
to
board
and
that
there
should
be
rule
govern
that
?
I
know
there
will
be
in
-
house
rule
.
stem
from
that
,
the
voluntary
nature
of
credit
union
be
such
that
I
would
have
certain
concern
if
we
be
to
apply
barrier
to
entry
for
certain
person
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
do
not
hold
certain
financial
qualification
.
at
the
same
time
I
have
a
open
mind
on
it
.
the
committee
have
be
offer
differ
view
on
the
reporting
mechanism
for
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
.
one
view
be
that
the
regulatory
framework
for
credit
union
should
be
house
under
a
department
.
another
view
be
that
it
should
be
house
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
,
but
that
the
reporting
mechanism
should
be
either
directly
to
the
director
or
to
a
assistant
director
.
there
might
be
sense
in
have
a
reporting
procedure
that
ensure
that
within
the
regulatory
office
under
the
umbrella
of
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
there
would
be
a
board
that
contain
expert
in
the
credit
union
field
to
which
each
of
the
credit
union
or
each
of
the
body
would
then
report
.
it
seem
that
within
the
Financial
Regulator
's
office
there
might
have
be
a
dearth
of
intimate
knowledge
on
the
working
of
the
credit
union
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
Mr.
Logue
's
role
as
registrar
be
one
which
be
quite
effectual
—
I
do
not
mean
to
plámás
in
say
that
—
in
that
he
have
a
very
firm
hand
in
term
of
the
rule
and
regulation
.
however
,
if
a
new
regulatory
regime
come
in
,
we
need
to
find
how
the
credit
union
movement
would
well
fit
into
that
new
regulatory
regime
,
where
it
would
be
house
,
where
the
reporting
should
be
and
whether
there
should
be
a
separate
board
or
body
of
people
with
specific
expertise
within
the
regulatory
house
under
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
to
deal
with
credit
union
.
a
credit
union
customer
of
long
standing
,
for
example
20
year
,
who
have
a
car
loan
,
might
lose
he
job
and
he
financial
circumstance
would
change
literally
overnight
.
he
may
be
pay
a
set
amount
per
week
over
a
fix
period
of
time
.
while
he
might
default
on
one
or
two
of
that
payment
he
might
take
responsibility
and
go
in
to
visit
he
credit
union
manager
.
if
that
loan
can
be
stretch
out
for
a
long
period
of
time
on
a
reduce
payment
on
the
proviso
that
he
will
honour
he
commitment
,
be
that
not
part
of
the
credit
union
etho
?
it
allow
for
a
degree
of
flexibility
and
there
be
a
element
of
trust
.
by
and
large
the
ratio
of
impairment
for
credit
union
customer
be
probably
negligible
—
I
do
not
have
exact
figure
.
however
,
where
a
degree
of
flexibility
be
show
,
the
likelihood
be
that
the
loan
will
be
repaid
albeit
over
a
period
of
time
,
by
relax
the
section
35
provision
the
credit
union
would
take
cognisance
of
the
reality
of
the
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
at
the
moment
.
if
Mr.
Logue
agree
with
the
change
to
section
35
and
take
flexibility
into
account
how
can
he
address
that
in
the
accounting
procedure
to
ensure
there
be
no
profligacy
and
that
he
keep
a
tight
stricture
on
that
same
procedure
?
God
forbid
.
be
Mr.
Logue
refer
specifically
to
the
amendment
to
the
trustee
(
authorise
investment
)
order
that
allow
credit
union
to
invest
in
such
investment
?
there
be
a
relax
of
the
order
in
,
I
believe
,
2006
which
if
I
be
not
mistaken
allow
credit
union
to
undertake
such
investment
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
change
to
the
regulation
,
although
it
do
not
exactly
force
credit
union
to
invest
outside
they
normal
investment
vehicle
,
mean
that
if
they
want
to
do
so
this
be
perhaps
the
only
way
for
they
to
go
.
it
be
one
school
of
thought
.
I
do
not
necessarily
say
I
subscribe
to
it
myself
.
I

I
welcome
Mr.
Elderfield
to
the
committee
in
he
role
as
Financial
regulator
.
he
will
be
aware
that
he
have
be
dub
the
"
sheriff
of
Dodge
city
"
.
I
be
expect
he
to
come
wear
a
Stetson
and
star
.
I
be
delighted
to
see
that
clear
,
unequivocal
language
be
develop
in
the
regulatory
regime
between
the
regulator
and
Professor
Honohan
.
there
be
no
room
for
ambiguity
.
we
be
get
a
clear
message
that
the
so
-
call
Dodge
city
need
to
be
clean
up
.
there
be
a
acceptance
among
the
general
public
in
that
regard
.
this
be
a
broad
range
discussion
in
which
I
wish
to
raise
a
number
of
issue
.
I
would
like
to
focus
directly
on
Mr.
Elderfield
's
submission
on
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
it
should
be
wind
down
.
Mr.
Elderfield
's
view
be
that
the
cost
of
wind
down
the
bank
would
be
prohibitive
.
how
do
he
come
to
that
conclusion
and
what
be
the
basis
of
he
logic
in
that
regard
?
Mr.
Elderfield
state
a
small
new
bank
be
likely
to
be
carve
out
and
that
he
would
apply
he
process
on
that
entity
.
will
he
elaborate
on
what
he
mean
by
the
process
?
I
presume
that
once
all
of
the
bad
asset
be
transfer
to
NAMA
he
will
be
leave
with
a
entity
.
do
he
believe
a
new
entity
will
be
create
from
this
?
what
be
the
vision
from
he
perspective
?
I
appreciate
that
Mr.
Elderfield
would
prefer
to
deal
with
the
Quinn
issue
on
a
separate
occasion
and
realise
that
matter
be
before
the
court
.
however
,
this
be
the
first
opportunity
for
the
tribune
of
the
people
to
ask
question
of
the
regulator
about
Quinn
Insurance
.
will
Mr.
Elderfield
give
we
a
insight
into
the
motivation
for
he
action
up
to
the
point
at
which
a
legal
process
start
?
for
instance
,
do
he
have
a
mandate
to
tackle
the
solvency
issue
?
the
reason
I
ask
that
question
be
that
5000
worker
feel
the
regulator
's
approach
be
perhaps
heavy
-
handed
.
perhaps
there
be
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
he
motivation
be
and
the
mandate
for
the
action
he
take
.
will
the
regulator
give
we
some
insight
into
the
process
and
the
reason
behind
the
action
he
adopt
?
be
it
technically
possible
for
Anglo
Irish
Bank
to
take
a
stake
in
Quinn
Insurance
?
some
claim
it
be
not
and
that
this
be
all
just
optic
so
Anglo
Irish
Bank
can
start
a
bid
war
among
other
insurance
company
for
Quinn
Insurance
.
what
be
the
regulator
's
view
on
this
,
if
it
be
possible
for
he
to
give
they
to
the
committee
at
this
stage
?
the
committee
be
examine
the
regulatory
regime
for
credit
union
.
there
be
broad
consensus
on
section
35
of
the
credit
Union
Act
1997
which
will
be
address
in
the
new
Central
Bank
Reform
Bill
.
however
,
there
be
no
consensus
among
the
representative
body
on
the
regulatory
framework
.
some
credit
union
representative
organisation
argue
regulation
in
the
past
be
overly
stringent
due
to
a
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
how
the
credit
union
model
work
.
it
be
argue
that
to
achieve
more
efficiency
in
this
regard
a
separate
regulatory
board
for
credit
union
compromise
credit
union
manager
and
member
should
be
establish
under
the
Financial
Regulator
's
framework
.
what
be
the
regulator
's
view
on
this
?
Financial
market
be
what
they
be
,
there
will
always
be
some
financial
wizard
to
design
a
elaborate
mechanism
for
make
money
.
accordingly
,
that
who
regulate
the
market
must
be
almost
ahead
of
they
.
will
the
cream
of
the
financial
service
workforce
need
to
be
work
in
the
Financial
Regulator
's
office
to
ensure
the
bank
do
not
sidestep
any
regulatory
regime
by
create
elaborate
mechanism
?
do
a
recruitment
embargo
apply
to
Mr.
Elderfield
's
office
?
do
he
office
need
more
staff
?
on
that
,
there
be
the
process
that
lead
up
to
the
instigation
of
judicial
proceedings
,
and
the
idea
of
a
State
own
bank
take
a
stake
in
a
insurance
company
be
moot
in
the
public
domain
.
we
have
the
regulator
before
we
.
it
be
completely
legitimate
for
we
to
ask
question
about
the
process
by
which
that
could
come
about
and
whether
that
be
a
legal
process
,
whether
it
be
in
compliance
with
any
rule
of
the
European
Union
and
whether
we
be
not
set
up
a
potentially
monopolistic
position
because
the
VHI
be
already
in
existence
.
this
be
completely
legitimate
question
which
be
be
ask
by
people
outside
this
wall
in
any
case
.
I
do
not
understand
why
they
can
not
be
answer
.
be
the
solvency
ratio
for
all
insurance
company
adequate
?
I
may
have
misheard
Mr.
Elderfield
early
but
I
think
he
say
two
insurance
company
be
under
investigation
.
will
he
clarify
whether
he
have
investigate
or
begin
proceedings
against
other
company
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
will
he
elaborate
on
which
company
be
involved
,
if
possible
?
I
thank
Mr.
Elderfield
very
much
for
this
afternoon
's
deliberation
.
it
be
a
extremely
beneficial
meeting
and
we
look
forward
to
further
meeting
with
the
regulator
in
the
not
too
distant
future
.

I
join
in
welcoming
Mr.
Delaney
to
the
committee
.
I
return
to
the
regulatory
burden
and
the
€300
million
to
€400
million
estimate
cost
of
regulation
to
small
business
.
he
state
that
the
process
ongoing
be
positive
.
it
sound
as
if
he
hope
there
will
be
a
positive
outcome
.
in
practical
term
I
wonder
whether
,
for
instance
,
the
taxation
burden
to
small
business
be
see
as
one
of
that
input
into
reduce
the
cost
burden
,
and
whether
,
for
instance
,
matter
such
as
health
and
safety
rule
and
regulation
be
part
of
that
cost
burden
,
and
also
the
sub
-
contract
element
.
I
suppose
I
be
tack
slightly
differently
on
the
sub
-
contracting
issue
.
one
of
the
issue
arise
be
the
inability
of
sub-contractor
to
collect
on
invoice
.
it
appear
that
there
do
not
seem
to
be
a
set
of
rule
on
obligation
in
that
sense
and
many
small
business
have
be
leave
high
and
dry
by
big
contractor
.
would
a
regulatory
framework
cover
that
relationship
also
?
when
the
small
guy
,
particularly
that
in
the
construction
industry
who
sub-contract
for
the
big
construction
firm
be
leave
swing
in
the
wind
when
they
come
to
collect
they
money
,
they
be
tell
in
no
uncertain
term
where
to
go
and
where
they
be
in
the
peck
order
.
be
that
cover
in
the
regulatory
burden
as
well
in
term
of
rule
and
regulation
that
could
be
put
in
place
?
I
mention
health
and
safety
as
a
regulatory
burden
because
the
regulatory
burden
on
small
business
,
especially
in
the
food
industry
be
particularly
onerous
.
under
haccp
legislation
the
HSE
be
bear
down
on
they
like
a
ton
of
brick
in
pursuit
of
small
menial
type
job
and
it
place
a
cost
burden
on
that
business
that
one
do
not
see
in
other
country
.
have
that
be
explore
?
I
mention
the
tax
burden
because
two
small
business
with
which
I
have
deal
,
which
have
meet
they
vat
obligation
,
for
instance
,
for
the
12
month
period
,
because
the
preliminary
payment
be
underpaid
find
that
they
have
to
pay
the
interest
on
that
thereafter
.
that
too
be
something
that
need
to
be
overhaul
.
all
of
this
be
cost
input
for
the
business
into
the
future
,
regardless
of
what
type
of
business
one
run
.
we
cannot
look
at
the
regulatory
framework
without
look
at
that
cost
burden
that
business
must
bear
.
perhaps
I
be
tack
slightly
away
from
the
substantive
issue
before
we
but
the
small
business
sector
have
become
a
soft
target
for
revenue
collection
in
the
absence
of
be
able
to
collect
it
from
the
traditional
source
.
I
would
welcome
IBEC
's
view
on
it
.
the
burden
have
be
shif
considerably
towards
this
system
.
when
I
look
at
small
business
,
particularly
family
-
run
business
which
be
operate
today
,
which
have
operate
intergenerationally
,
and
which
have
also
cut
they
cloth
to
measure
,
I
see
that
the
burden
be
place
on
they
through
increase
regulation
be
stifling
they
.
perhaps
Mr.
Delaney
would
give
a
view
on
that
.
on
the
country
that
we
should
emulate
,
be
there
a
suggestion
that
the
UK
be
the
benchmark
by
which
we
should
operate
?
be
there
something
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
this
committee
should
take
on
board
which
would
affect
regulation
and
which
would
reduce
that
burden
if
necessary
?
I
presume
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
come
under
the
IBEC
umbrella
.
I
presume
there
be
large
contractor
,
construction
interest
or
supplier
to
the
trade
who
come
under
that
umbrella
.
I
raise
this
matter
as
I
be
of
the
view
that
the
late
payment
legislation
be
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
be
write
.
if
one
be
a
small
contractor
in
north
Cork
,
do
work
for
a
major
construction
company
and
try
to
use
that
legislation
in
order
to
pursue
it
for
payment
,
it
be
the
case
that
one
will
never
work
in
that
part
of
the
country
again
.
in
the
context
of
relationship
among
business
which
be
represent
by
group
such
as
IBEC
and
the
CIF
,
surely
a
voluntary
mechanism
could
be
put
in
place
in
order
to
ensure
small
interest
would
be
pay
.
that
be
not
happen
and
such
interest
be
be
squeeze
out
.
when
we
refer
to
the
lifeblood
of
the
economy
,
we
must
remember
that
small
contractor
have
keep
thing
go
on
a
local
level
and
provide
much
employment
.
I
sense
that
the
legislation
be
not
really
effective
and
that
the
group
which
represent
the
people
concerned
such
as
IBEC
must
come
forward
with
proposal
to
progress
the
matter
.
I
appreciate
that
.
I
take
Mr.
Delaney
's
point
.
person
operate
they
business
and
enter
into
contract
primarily
on
the
basis
of
good
faith
.
that
be
particularly
the
case
for
small
contractor
enter
into
arrangement
with
reputable
firm
.
for
example
,
if
one
be
go
into
business
with
a
so
-
call
blue
chip
construction
firm
,
one
can
take
it
on
good
faith
that
,
base
on
the
law
of
average
,
one
should
receive
payment
for
one
's
endeavour
.
no
one
be
suggest
representative
of
such
small
business
should
act
as
if
they
be
above
the
law
.
however
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
that
they
would
well
represent
the
various
interest
by
seek
to
put
pressure
on
people
they
work
for
or
subcontract
to
and
there
be
a
sense
the
small
guy
be
not
get
the
representation
he
should
.
Mr.
Delaney
might
not
accept
that
but
sometimes
the
small
guy
cannot
put
he
head
above
the
parapet
because
if
he
do
,
he
be
gone
.
Mr.
Delaney
mention
133000
job
loss
in
the
construction
industry
and
145000
in
the
retail
sector
.
there
be
a
great
deal
of
debate
currently
about
the
smart
economy
and
the
concept
of
upskilling
but
vague
language
be
be
use
.
how
can
we
get
this
people
back
to
work
,
particularly
that
who
work
in
the
construction
industry
and
who
have
a
skill
set
because
nothing
will
be
build
in
the
near
future
?
one
school
of
thought
be
that
a
massive
stock
of
old
house
need
upgrade
and
that
process
could
be
incentivise
through
retrofit
and
so
on
.
be
it
realistic
in
IBEC
's
view
that
many
of
this
guy
can
be
pool
and
put
back
to
work
in
that
sector
?
this
be
dramatic
figure
.
not
all
of
the
former
retail
worker
will
return
to
the
retail
sector
because
that
be
demand
-
lead
and
so
on

reference
be
repeatedly
make
to
high
-
end
service
,
upskilling
,
fourth

,
start

up

and
so
on
but
that
will
only
take
up
some
of
the
slack
.
from
a
businessman
's
perspective
,
where
do
Mr.
Delaney
see
potential
for

I
want
to
look
at
the
recommendation
,
set
out
in
the
presentation
which
state
:
there
need
to
be
a
review
of
the
objective
of
regulation
as
,
in
we
opinion
,
neither
the
objective
nor
reason
for
regulation
be
fully
understand
by
the
public
service
or
the
wide
political
stakeholder
.
be
it
Mr.
Fielding
's
view
,
give
that
he
have
quote
the
CSO
example
in
that
firm
,
that
the
CSO
impose
a
obligation
through
the
Statistics
Act
,
on
business
to
supply
the
figure
but
that
the
CSO
have
no
clear
understanding
of
the
administrative
or
cost
burden
that
place
on
the
business
and
it
be
act
as
just
one
arm
of
government
to
do
that
?
in
effect
,
government
need
to
ensure
that
business
be
not
over
regulate
in
a
way
that
increase
they
administrative
function
for
no
state
aim
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
except
that
it
gather
figure
which
may
or
may
not
be
use
productively
.
be
the
high
level
group
on
business
regulation
look
at
that
specific
topic
and
get
into
the
nitty
gritty
to
ensure
that
business
function
be
take
away
from
that
business
person
so
that
he
or
she
do
not
have
to
waste
a
number
of
labour
hour
over
the
course
of
a
week
prepare
material
for
which
there
be
no
gain
to
the
business
person
and
only
add
to
he
burden
of
work
?
in
term
of
the
regulatory
process
as
a
whole
,
Mr.
Fielding
make
the
distinction
between
the
light
touch
regulation
of
the
bank
and
the
heavy
regulation
for
sme
.
I
be
sympathetic
to
everything
that
have
be
state
here
because
we
deal
with
they
at
the
front
end
.
for
example
,
in
regard
to
Revenue
,
there
be
scenario
where
agreement
be
strike
between
business
and
Revenue
in
regard
to
outstanding
obligation
for
taxation
and
so
on
but
what
be
happen
in
the
SME
sector
be
that
guy
be
not
able
to
collect
the
money
outstanding
and
due
to
they
.
while
one
get
a
sense
that
Revenue
be
flexible
in
stretch
out
the
time
line
and
be
come
up
with
agree
repayment
schedule
,
the
agreement
on
a
repayment
schedule
be
make
in
good
faith
by
the
sme
but
what
happen
be
that
the
goalpost
shift
further
in
that
the
person
who
owe
the
money
outstanding
be
not
in
a
position
to
pay
and
then
the
heavy
hand
come
back
down
on
the
business
.
I
be
deal
with
one
such
engineering
firm
in
north
Cork
which
be
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
to
talk
to
Revenue
.
the
reason
he
be
find
it
difficult
be
that
have
already
be
in
to
Revenue
and
draw
up
a
schedule
,
the
payment
due
on
invoice
have
not
come
in
and
Revenue
be
now
put
the
heavy
hand
on
he
.
to
see
that
business
thrive
,
I
want
to
see
he
be
give
some
sort
of
a
break
.
his
impression
,
as
a
business
owner
,
be
that
Revenue
will
come
down
heavy
on
he
and
shut
he
down
,
rather
than
cut
he
more
slack
.
how
as
politician
do
we
legislate
to
cut
that
business
a
bit
of
slack
in
current
time
?
be
it
impertinent
of
I
to
ask
that
copy
of
the
correspondence
,
without
refer
to
the
individual
in
question
,
could
be
furnish
to
the
joint
committee
?
that
would
assist
we
in
seek
to
effect
change
to
the
legislation
,
if
necessary
.
we
must
grapple
with
this
issue
because
it
affect
sub
-contractor
who
be
operate
on
a
more
informal
basis
.
we
raise
this
issue
at
the
previous
meeting
.
if
we
have
substantive
evidence
and
bear
in
mind
that
we
can
conceal
people
's
identity
,
that
would
assist
in
highlight
this
issue
.
be
this
happen
100
%
of
the
time
on
all
contract
,
or
be
it
a
intermittent
practice
?
in
essence
,
they
have
the
owner
of
small
business
effectively
over
a
barrel
and
there
be
no
legislative
provision
that
protect
the
small
guy
because
of
the
contracting
out
process
.
I
have
a
particular
interest
in
the
food
industry
and
one
of
the
issue
that
be
come
up
in
term
of
the
regulatory
regime
be
the
Hassop
regulation
.
have
food
business
contact
ISME
about
the
overly
stringent
Hassop
regulation
,
give
the
way
the
system
work
in
France
,
where
a
artisan
producer
can
continue
to
produce
,
and
there
be
no
hassle
.
be
it
Mr.
Fielding
's
sense
that
it
speak
to
the
culture
of
the
country
that
when
legislation
be
devise
in
Brussels
,
we
seem
to
go
hell
for
leather
to
try
to
implement
it
.
I
apologise
for
take
so
much
time
.
I
thank
Mr.
Fielding
for
he
attendance
.
we
will
meet
tomorrow

I
welcome
the
delegation
.
it
be
the
first
time
we
have
talk
to
individual
business
and
see
first
hand
the
effect
on
they
.
I
welcome
that
because
it
be
the
only
way
we
,
as
politician
,
can
fully
understand
how
this
be
have
a
effect
on
people
.
if
the
SFA
be
actively
participate
in
the
high
level
group
on
business
regulation
,
the
question
which
arise
be
why
no
progress
be
be
make
on
the
issue
which
be
before
we
today
.
do
there
need
to
be
more
of
a
political
imperative
to
push
the
process
on
to
try
to
get
result
soon
than
we
be
see
?
I
be
begin
to
question
that
process
because
if
the
SFA
be
before
we
today
one
could
surmise
that
we
be
not
see
the
progress
we
should
be
see
on
that
issue
.
I
be
fascinate
by
Mr.
Cummin
's
submission
.
if
the
cost
of
a
permit
be
€500
and
it
cost
€
40000
for
a
consultant
to
put
in
a
submission
,
which
be
base
on
30
piece
of
legislation
and
any
number
of
statutory
instrument
,
I
do
not
understand
why
,
if
there
be
a
process
through
the
high
level
group
,
the
issue
have
not
be
tackle
before
now
.
it
be
something
which
this
committee
have
to
take
up
with
the
minister
after
this
meeting
,
in
order
that
a
action
arise
from
it
and
the
delegation
be
not
just
come
in
here
,
plead
its
case
and
walk
off
,
with
nothing
else
be
do
.
perhaps
the
official
who
be
involved
with
that
high
level
group
should
be
bring
before
the
committee
in
order
that
we
can
see
what
progress
be
be
make
on
that
issue
,
if
that
be
possible
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
high
level
group
be
currently
at
,
from
the
delegation
's
perspective
.
I
would
like
a
honest
appraisal
on
where
it
see
that
go
and
whether
it
be
yield
result
.
the
SFA
state
in
its
submission
that
it
be
examine
the
employment
law
to
which
Ms
McNally
refer
,
corporate
governance
and
health
and
safety
.
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
come
before
the
committee
.
there
be
issue
,
in
term
of
the
cost
of
run
it
and
the
expense
it
have
incur
which
be
,
to
my
mind
,
questionable
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
issue
of
waste
and
waste
management
,
and
regulation
from
that
point
of
view
.
have
the
high
level
group
discuss
the
issue
which
we
be
discuss
today
?
be
it
still
stuck
on
other
pillar
?
fair
enough
.
I
wish
to
return
to
the
issue
of
waste
management
.
if
there
be
a
standard
model
and
one
be
operate
in
Cork
,
Waterford
,
Limerick
or
wherever
,
one
apply
for
one
licence
which
be
then
eligible
across
the
26
county
.
it
seem
to
speak
to
common
sense
.
however
,
I
have
a
sense
that
the
local
authority
be
gradually
,
of
they
own
accord
,
move
out
of
waste
management
and
be
transfer
it
to
private
operator
.
it
may
be
a
philosophical
issue
.
what
need
to
be
do
now
for
a
business
which
be
in
the
waste
management
sector
?
what
be
the
ideal
thing
which
need
to
happen
?
do
we
get
rid
of
the
statutory
instrument
?
do
we
amend
the
legislation
?
we
could
introduce
a
new
statutory
instrument
which
give
the
minister
the
power
to
override
the
local
authority
and
state
,
by
ministerial
decree
,
that
there
be
one
licence
for
the
whole
country
,
which
may
be
the
ideal
scenario
.
we
be
get
down
to
brass
tack
.
this
be
the
nub
of
the
issue
.
I
be
on
my
first
mandate
.
it
predate
my
membership
of
this
House
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Cummin
's
point
correctly
,
it
be
that
when
regulation
,
legislation
and
statutory
instrument
be
be
draft
,
there
be
no
consultation
with
affect
stakeholder
.
we
be
not
talk
about
reinvent
the
wheel
but
about
matter
refer
to
in
other
report
.
the
net
effect
be
that
we
need
to
allow
for
a
legislative
process
that
—
—
the
chairman
may
disagree
with
I
that
there
be
a
disparity
in
that
case
.

I
welcome
Mr.
Raleigh
and
he
colleague
and
congratulate
they
on
the
report
and
its
presentation
.
it
be
succinct
and
its
language
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
very
often
in
we
game
we
have
to
wide
through
vast
amount
of
documentation
so
it
be
good
to
see
a
report
that
be
clear
in
what
it
seek
to
do
without
any
ambiguity
.
I
believe
the
last
paragraph
of
the
submission
probably
sum
up
the
culture
that
exist
in
this
country
.
do
I
understand
there
be
plenty
of
code
—
a
vast
quantum
of
code
—
which
one
can
follow
and
buy
into
but
be
not
necessarily
back
up
by
a
legislative
framework
in
regard
to
corporate
governance
in
this
country
?
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
3
of
the
report
Mr.
Raleigh
state
:
we
believe
this
situation
give
rise
to
the
lack
of
a
clear
unified
framework
for
company
to
follow
,
potentially
overlap
line
of
responsibility
among
regulator
and
the
perception
of
potential
conflict
of
interest
.
the
stock
Exchange
,
for
example
,
be
currently
be
ask
to
market
the
exchange
,
retain
exist
company
and
attract
new
company
to
its
list
,
while
also
be
require
to
monitor
and
ensure
compliance
with
the
combine
code
.
therefore
the
combine
code
exist
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
culture
of
compliance
as
it
pertain
to
the
vast
bulk
of
company
seem
to
be
quite
strong
but
there
still
be
a
lag
.
do
we
need
a
more
august
body
of
legislation
to
ensure
100
%
compliance
,
bring
about
a
sea
change
in
the
culture
and
a
change
in
the
perception
abroad
of
Irish
company
?
that
be
very
clear
.
in
regard
to
the
public
interest
entity
—
the
first
time
I
have
hear
they
refer
to
in
that
way
be
in
the
blurb
—
we
might
look
at
page
23
of
the
report
on
audit
committee
,
in
particular
,
on
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
delegate
have
look
at
Anglo
.
I
believe
there
be
a
reference
to
it
as
be
cover
.
it
be
nationalise
at
the
time
so
I
be
not
100
%
clear
whether
it
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
report
.
we
have
a
member
of
the
audit
committee
of
Anglo
before
this
committee
at
one
stage
—
—
Internal
audit
.
I
just
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
distinction
between
competence
.
if
recommendation
for
pass
particular
loan
be
make
,
for
example
,
and
the
internal
audit
committee
declare
the
loan
represent
a
risk
to
the
overall
entity
should
there
be
clear
rule
about
legislate
for
that
or
be
some
degree
of
flexibility
need
?
the
loan
might
be
pass
up
the
line
with
the
board
subsequently
agree
to
its
be
slip
through
because
it
need
to
go
through
.
what
strike
I
when
we
be
examine
the
culture
within
Anglo
be
that
there
be
a
fluidity
across
all
competence
,
from
chief
executive
down
.
although
it
be
only
one
company
there
may
be
a
perception
that
this
culture
pervade
many
other
company
,
especially
in
the
banking
sector
.
should
there
be
clear
,
legislate
-
for
rule
or
some
code
for
case
where
there
be
a
inherent
risk
,
where
a
internal
audit
committee
say
there
be
a
risk
to
the
overall
entity
if
a
particular
loan
be
pass
or
a
certain
decision
be
make
,
even
when
official
feel
they
be
act
in
good
faith
?
I
refer
to
page
4
of
the
delegation
's
submission
which
state
,
"
the
often
-
state
assertion
that
there
be
not
enough
appropriately
qualified
director
in
the
Irish
market
should
be
challenge
,
not
least
because
the
increase
exposure
of
Irish
company
to
international
market
mean
that
Irish
company
should
seriously
consider
the
level
of
international
representation
on
they
board
"
.
what
do
the
delegation
mean
by
that
?
it
be
pertinent
to
make
that
statement
in
this
hallow
institution
.
the
culture
in
this
country
be
very
much
about
connectivity
,
inter-
relationship
,
who
one
be
and
who
one
represent
and
I
be
unsure
how
one
could
legislate
for
that
.
I
imagine
it
be
rather
difficult
to
put
in
place
a
rule
-
base
structure
because
it
be
very
subjective
.
would
grant
Thornton
have
do
that
for
Kingspan
,
for
instance
?
to
what
extent
will
European
Union
rule
have
a
bear
on
change
to
corporate
governance
structure
?
do
the
de
Larosière
report
have
a
bear
on
the
change
we
be
discuss
here
or
be
that
a
separate
process
?
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
the
delegate
for
they
attendance
and
presentation
.
we
have
a
very
worthwhile
discussion

I
welcome
we
guest
.
this
be
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
issue
of
regulation
have
be
present
to
the
committee
on
a
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
basis
.
we
have
receive
a
micro
view
of
how
regulation
have
affect
the
sector
.
I
be
particularly
intrigue
by
Mr.
Foy
's
story
in
respect
of
potato
.
from
a
layman
's
point
of
view
,
I
wish
to
discover
more
about
the
regime
which
allow
someone
to
enter
a
shop
and
rip
open
a
bag
of
potato
and
examine
the
content
.
what
power
be
bestow
on
inspector
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
which
allow
they
to
do
this
in
the
first
instance
?
surely
it
must
be
possible
for
this
people
to
take
a
step
back
from
they
own
regulatory
regime
and
visit
wholesaler
in
order
to
inspect
goods
.
I
imagine
they
be
do
this
in
a
event
in
respect
of
egg
,
tobacco
and
the
other
item
to
which
we
guest
refer
.
if
they
visit
the
premise
of
wholesaler
or
primary
producer
,
why
then
be
they
also
visit
independent
grocer
in
order
to
inspect
the
same
product
?
do
we
guest
have
a
view
on
that
matter
?
Mr.
Foy
have
be
base
in
Cootehill
for
ten
year
.
the
Department
's
inspector
have
be
check
the
potato
on
sale
at
he
premise
for
that
entire
period
and
I
presume
a
situation
have
at
some
point
arise
where
they
state
that
that
potato
be
substandard
or
that
certain
action
need
to
be
take
.
I
do
not
wish
to
sound
flippant
,
I
merely
wish
to
discover
whether
such
a
bizarre
scenario
exist
in
the
first
instance
.
I
accept
that
.
the
haccp
legislation
,
even
though
it
apply
on
a
Europe
-
wide
basis
,
arguably
would
not
allow
for
the
situation
to
which
Mr.
Foy
refer
in
respect
of
Starbucks
.
we
implement
and
accommodate
European
legislation
and
haccp
regulation
relate
to
food
in
as
robust
a
fashion
as
possible
.
I
do
not
know
if
any
of
we
guest
's
store
be
affect
by
the
haccp
legislation
.
if
it
do
affect
they
,
will
they
indicate
whether
that
affect
be
adverse
in
nature
?
it
be
well
document
that
if
one
visit
a
country
market
or
artisan
store
in
France
,
it
be
obvious
that
that
stallholder
and
store
owner
do
not
adhere
to
the
legislation
in
the
way
retailer
here
be
oblige
to
do
.
what
be
we
guest
's
view
on
that
matter
?
we
need
to
return
to
first
principle
,
exercise
a
degree
of
common
sense
and
deconstruct
the
culture
whereby
everything
need
to
be
examine
and
job
need
to
be
create
for
the
sake
of
do
so
.
a
high
-
level
group
be
examine
the
position
with
regard
to
regulation
at
present
.
be
RGDATA
provide
that
group
with
information
?
okay
.
ISME
and
the
SFA
have
come
before
the
committee
and
a
common
theme
run
through
we
deliberation
,
namely
,
that
there
be
far
too
much
regulation
and
that
it
must
be
reduce
.
I
would
argue
that
the
high
-
level
group
to
which
I
refer
be
understaffed
and
that
its
work
be
not
move
at
a
acceptable
pace
.
this
committee
should
take
a
view
to
the
effect
that
RGDATA
should
play
a
more
formal
role
in
respect
of
the
high
-
level
group
.
I
hope
other
member
agree
with
I
in
that
regard
.
what
be
we
guest
advocate
in
respect
of
request
for
statistic
from
the
CSO
?
everyone
agree
that
the
CSO
be
necessary
,
particularly
as
there
be
a
need
for
statistic
.
however
,
perhaps
there
be
a
need
to
consider
what
it
be
do
in
seek
statistic
from
the
grocery
sector
at
the
level
to
which
we
guest
refer
.
we
could
take
a
representative
sample
.
it
seem
to
be
more
of
a
quantitative
exercise
than
a
qualitative
exercise
.
what
be
come
across
be
that
we
need
to
apply
some
common
sense
.
the
witness
be
argue
for
something
quite
logical
.
my
last
question
do
not
relate
to
what
the
witness
present
.
the
regional
planning
guideline
be
under
review
.
I
have
a
strong
view
on
what
I
call
the
"
Tescofication
"
of
the
grocery
sector
.
pressure
be
come
from
the
large
multiple
for
a
change
to
regional
planning
guideline
.
do
RGDATA
have
a
formal
view
on
this
?
I
would
like
to
take
Mr.
Nolan
up
on
the
offer
.

will
be
a
waste
of
time
after
the
fact
.
credit
union
hope
for
proper
consultation
in
advance
of
the
legislation
be
pass
or
perhaps
a
parking
of
the
legislation
until
such
time
as
they
can
get
down
to
the
nitty
gritty
of
the
detail
of
how
it
will
impact
on
they
in
the
long
term
.
a
strategic
review
after
the
legislation
be
pass
seem
to
the
credit
union
to
be
quite
a
waste
of
time
and
they
perception
be
that
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
be
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
any
initiative
or
view
they
have
on
how
the
new
section
35a
and
35b
will
affect
they
.
they
also
have
a
perception
that
they
have
already
make
adequate
provisioning
arrangement
.
they
believe
there
be
a
relatively
decent
reserve
in
position
and
they
be
well
place
to
withstand
any
economic
downturn
or
anything
that
may
change
within
the
12
to
18
month
period
.
what
be
Mr.
O'Brien
's
view
on
this
?
if
he
be
to
communicate
a
message
to
the
credit
union
through
this
forum
what
would
he
state
on
this
?
do
Mr.
O'Brien
have
regard
for
the
fact
that
because
of
the
new
provisioning
arrangement
and
the
reserve
requirement
many
credit
union
will
find
it
more
difficult
to
pay
dividend
and
surplus
?
this
could
in
the
long
term
undermine
the
credit
union
movement
.
if
one
do
not
get
a
return
why
should
one
invest
in
a
individual
credit
union
?
credit
union
take
a
view
that
they
have
voluntarily
introduce
new
parameter
on
provision
requirement
.
some
will
argue
that
there
have
be
increase
of
anything
up
to
40
%
in
the
reserve
of
individual
credit
union
to
meet
any
onslaught
or
potential
problem
that
might
arise
.
at
present
,
credit
union
have
a
sense
that
Mr.
O'Brien
be
not
in
a
position
to
bargain
,
negotiate
or
even
consult
.
they
perception
be
that
Mr.
O'Brien
will
drive
on
and
adopt
a
"
one
size
fit
all
"
approach
.
he
may
extrapolate
from
the
result
he
elucidate
to
deputy
O'Donnell
on
reserve
and
the
increase
pressure
that
exist
for
100
loan
book
.
be
they
representative
of
the
overall
credit
union
sector
?
do
we
need
to
look
more
closely
at
that
100
loan
book
?
what
be
the
product
mix
and
what
be
the
mix
of
credit
union
examine
?
if
Mr.
O'Brien
take
a
unilateral
approach
he
will
potentially
impact
on
the
ability
of
credit
union
to
draw
in
new
customer
if
the
reserve
and
provisioning
requirement
be
so
stringent
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
pay
out
dividend
even
though
they
loan
book
might
be
perform
quite
well
.
what
I
be
try
to
get
across
be
the
idea
that
there
may
be
a
sense
in
which
the
minister
have
buy
into
a
view
on
section
35a
and
35b
.
in
he
second
stage
speech
,
he
state
:
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
will
adopt
a
balance
and
proportionate
approach
in
the
application
of
the
loan
provisioning
requirement
which
be
propose
to
be
introduce
.
depend
on
the
circumstance
,
a
miss
repayment
on
a
reschedule
loan
may
not
always
trigger
a
full
provision
against
the
loan
provide
that
the
credit
union
be
satisfied
that
the
loan
continue
to
perform
in
accordance
with
its
new
term
.
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
give
they
a
carte
blanche
,
but
that
the
ability
of
the
individual
credit
union
to
know
its
customer
and
have
a
personal
relationship
with
he
or
she
be
be
override
by
the
new
provision
which
it
will
impose
.
that
be
something
which
need
to
be
tease
out
because
in
the
future
one
do
not
want
tension
to
exist
between
the
registrar
and
individual
credit
union
,
thereby
have
a
negative
impact
on
they
ability
to
pay
dividend
.
what
be
the
representative
body
?
what
be
its
position
regard
section
35
(
a
)
when
it
be
sit
in
the
room
with
the
delegation
?
a
position
be
articulate
to
we
in
the
committee
and
I
be
sure
the
delegate
have
read
the
transcript
.
the
minister
have
a
very
clear
position
on
section
35
(
a
)
,
as
do
Mr.
O’Brien
.
where
be
the
breakdown
,
if
this
be
a
consultative
process
?
I
appreciate
that
.
I
have
one
final
question
regard
the
appropriate
process
,
procedure
and
system
that
will
have
to
be
put
in
place
to
meet
the
requirement
of
section
35
(
b
)
.
what
do
the
delegation
envisage
in
that
provision
?
it
could
arguably
place
a
massive
cost
burden
on
individual
credit
union
as
a
result
of
update
information
technology
system
and
other
such
process
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
current
position
of
the
delegation
.
it
be
how
one
determine
the
power
.
be
it
a
soft
power
or
a
hard
power
?
will
Mr.
O'Brien
beat
they
with
a
stick
or
coax
they
along
gently
in
a
consultative
fashion
?
if
I
be
a
member
of
a
credit
union
representative
body
,
I
would
be
distrustful
of
the
process
outline
by
the
delegate
.
the
legislation
be
be
amend
to
provide
certain
power
.
Mr.
O'Brien
may
say
he
intend
to
consult
widely
on
individual
scenario
,
but
that
be
a
easy
commitment
to
give
.
a
credit
union
representative
would
ask
why
the
legislation
be
be
change
before
the
strategic
review
be
complete
.
surely
it
would
be
preferable
to
park
the
legislation
until
the
review
and
consultation
have
be
carry
out
.
it
could
be
wrap
up
by
the
autumn
or
winter
and
there
would
be
a
clearly
define
set
of
goal
for
each
of
the
legislative
,
regulatory
and
representative
side
.
what
be
Mr.
O'Brien
's
view
of
this
proposal
?
do
that
not
make
a
mockery
of
a
subsequent
strategic
review
?
we
be
look
at
the
legislation
,
yet
Mr.
O'Brien
be
call
for
another
review
late
.
why
not
include
this
aspect
in
the
strategic
review
?
Mr.
McMahon
be
describe
apple
and
orange
.
what
be
the
mix
of
that
credit
union
if
they
form
a
representative
sample
?
be
they
large
-
scale
credit
union
,
small
credit
union
or
a
mix
?
do
Mr.
O'Brien
envisage
a
time
when
every
credit
union
,
before
pay
out
a
dividend
,
nominal
or
otherwise
,
would
have
to
notify
the
registrar
regardless
of
whether
they
be
in
deficit
or
otherwise
?

I
wish
to
address
the

quotient

to
the
high

from
the

Department
and
ask
if
enough
staff

task

if
the
target
be
a
reduction
of
25
%
by

,
it
would
appear
there
be
not
enough
staff
to
deal
with
it
adequately
to
move
the
agenda
forward
.
I
be
concerned
that
it

not

give
that

in

and
have
be

that
we

in

,
there
be
a
serious
urgency
about
this

of

for
business
.
there
may
not

about

to

a
major
cost
burden

.
obviously
the
CSO
have
certain
obligation
by
dint
of
EU
legislation
and
that
,
I
presume
,
be
what
be
mean
by
a
intractable
issue
,
as
mention
.
I
be
sure
that
the
business
group
,
the
SFA
and
ISME
have
refer
to
this
specifically
in
this
committee
.
if
that
be
a
intractable
issue
and
there
a
pre-exist
regulatory
burden
,
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
the
CSO
be
a
active
partner
on
a
weekly
,
monthly
,
quarterly
basis
with
the
high

group
to
ensure

there

there

on

what
be

?
that
be
fair
enough
.
the

representative
might
have
a
view
on
that
which
I
be
sure
we
will
get
to
as
we
progress
.
in
try
to
achieve
a
25
%
reduction
,
be
it
possible
to
quantify
at

stage
the
percentage
achieve
on

?
have
50
%
,
70

%
of

will
the

hit
its
target
in

of
reduce

?
could
the

potentially
move

?
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
of
where
it
be
at
and
whether
the
target
be
be
achieve
.
I
have
the
work
programme
here
.
I
have
a
specific
question
on
the
Health

Safety
Authority
.
from
a
hsa
perspective
,
how
be
the
regulatory
burden
be
reduce
in

of
the

legislation

on

?
what
action
be
be
take
to
reduce
that
burden
on

?
I
can
speak
with
more
authority
from
a
local
authority
perspective
whereby
the
simple
issue
of
fill
a
pothole
now
require
a
myriad
of
man
hour
.
I
assume
the
same
be
applicable
in
a
business
sense
in
that
if
one
want
to
carry
out
work
to
one
's
premise
or
whatever
there
be
a
regulatory

on

be
the

tease
out
that
issue
also
with
the

?
do
Mr.
Gorman
have
a
timeline
for
the
completion
of
that
process
?
Mr.

will
have
to

I
if
my

as
a

of

this
amount
to

,

.
how
,
in

,
be
it

to
reduce

of

%
by

I
be
sceptical
about
the
possibility
that
the
Health
and

will
be
haul
over

and
legislation
amend
by
the
end
of

I
do
not
get
a
sense
of
urgency
,
which
be
the
reason
I
question
the
staffing
quotient
apply
to
this
mechanism
in
the
first
instance
.
Mr.
Gorman
allude
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
recently
.
the
secretariat
for
the
high

group
be
provide
by
the
company
law
review
group
and
business

section
,
which
currently
have
a
staff
of
eight
.
the
high
level
group
cannot
achieve
what
it
hope
to
deliver
with
this
staffing
quotient
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
other
Department
feed
into
the
process
.
I
will
now
address
Mr.
MacFeely
,
the
representative
of
the
Central
Statistics
Office
.
business
interest
be
make
a
case
that
one
could
take
representative
sample
as
oppose
to
complete
figure
to
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
.
the
Legislature
require
a
great
sense
of
urgency
in
this
regard
give
the
current
economic
circumstance
.
we
need
a
substantive
means
of

,
at

,
whether

in
the
work

some
of
the
target
be
characterise
by
the
colour
red

orange
and
green
.
I
will
choose
a
random
example
.
the
description
give
on
the

that
the

how
do
a
company
alter
its
ARD
?
presumably
,
that
be
real
and
that
have
happen
.
however
,
there
be
so
much
more
within
that
work
programme
document
which
be
totally
aspirational
.
I
be
the
type
of
person
who
like
to
see
a
target
date
and
a
action
and
whether
or
not
it
have
be
achieve
,
and
much
of
it
have
not
be
achieve
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
it
be
not
a
apportioning
of
blame
either
;
it
be
a
apportioning
of
resource
.
how
often
do
Mr.
Gorman
chat
to
the
minister
?
we
be
discuss
reduce
a
cost

,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that

no
one
be
oppose
to
the
idea
of
reduce
the
legislative
burden
or
the
need
to
ensure
that
workplace
be
safe
.
no
one
in
he
or
she
right
mind
would
seek
to
compromise
on
that
.
however
,
a
entire
industry
have
grow
up
around
health
and

the
implementation
of
legislation

thereto

the
regulatory

Representative
from

invite
we
guest
to
consider
the
figure
they
provide
in

alone
.
we
be
try
to
examine
matter
such
as
that
to
which
I
refer
.
I
do
not
believe
what
we
be
do
in
this
regard
be
wrong
.
nor
be
it
wrong
for
we
to
try
to
change
or
streamline
the
position
in
any
way
.
no
member
be
try
to
reduce
the
need
for
proper
assessment
but
a
common
-
sense
approach
should
be
take
.
the
group
will
hopefully
will
appear
before
we
again
in
the
not
too
distant
future
with
a
update
on
how
everything
be
progress
.
we
will
keep
that
issue
at
the
top
of
we
agenda
because
we
can
sense
the
frustration
at
all
level
in
this

I
welcome
Mrs.
Justice
Catherine
McGuinness
and
she
colleague
to
the
committee
.
I
thank
she
on
behalf
of
my
party
for
she
comprehensive
presentation
.
I
have
one
critique
of
it
which
I
might
respectfully
put
to
she
.
the
composition
of
the
working
group
,
which
be
set
out
in
the
acknowledgement
,
seem
to
exclude
the
credit
union
movement
.
the
credit
union
representative
body
seem
to
have
be
omit
.
they
represent
more
than
400
credit
union
and
provide
personal
credit
to
almost
3
million
member
.
we
all
subscribe
to
the
efficacy
of
report
from
the
Law
Reform
Commission
.
on
read
the
report
,
it
be
my
view
that
one
cannot
have
such
a
report
without
they
input
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
do
by
the
Law
Reform
Commission
on
behalf
of
the
State
but
no
report
on
personal
debt
management
and
debt
enforcement
could
stand
up
to
scrutiny
without
the
inclusion
of
the
representative
of
the
credit
union
movement
.
that
be
a
layman
's
view
.
that
who
participate
in
the
report
seem
to
be
more
weight
in
favour
of
the
banking
federation
which
would
not
be
friendly
towards
the
credit
union
movement
.
perhaps
the
latter
group
could
be
bring
on
board
as
part
of
the
consultative
process
.

indicate
that
the
consultation
paper
also
note
that
no
arrears
management
code
exist
in
respect
of
non-mortgage
debt
and
so
suggest
that
consideration
should
be
give
to
introduce
such
a
code
.
Mrs.
Justice
McGuinness
indicate
:
"
the
final
topic
consider
in
the
area
of
responsible
arrears
management
be
the
provisional
recommendation
of
the
commission
that
a
system
for
the
regulation
of
the
debt
collection
industry
should
be
establish
.
I
note
the
word
"
provisional
"
.
I
do
not
understand
why
that
would
be
a
provisional
arrangement
.
be
the
Law
Reform
Commission
not
aware
that
there
be
private
,
unregulated
firm
charge
astronomical
commission
to
person
in
severe
debt
for
manage
they
account
?
I
recently
come
across
a
case
where
a
couple
be
be
charge
approximately
€
100
per
month
,
€
1200
per
annum
,
by
one
such
company
.
I
do
not
believe
one
can
consider
personal
indebtedness
without
examine
that
company
as
well
.
in
the
new
regulatory
regime
there
be
a
sense
that
many
of
that
type
of
company
be
go
to
slip
under
the
radar
and
that
the
credit
union
and
bank
will
receive
much
of
the
focus
,
perhaps
rightly
so
,
but
that
the
other
company
would
slip
away
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
delegation
's
view
in
this
regard
.
the
commission
's
report
on
personal
debt
state
:
in
December
2009
,
the
Financial
Regulator
publish
datum
on
mortgage
arrears
and
repossession
base
on
the
quarter
to
the
end
of
September
2009
.
this
statistic
provide
a
insight
into
the
difficulty
be
experience
by
Irish
household
in
meet
mortgage
loan
repayment
.
the
statistic
illustrate
that
of
a
total
of
791634
private
residential
mortgage
loan
,
8504
be
in
arrears
for
a
period
of
between
91
and
180
day
.
be
mortgage
with
interest
-
only
or
reduce
repayment
arrangement
include
in
this
arrears
figure
?
the
report
also
state
:
"
the
number
of
possession
claim
bring
in
the
high
Court
rise
by
22
%
in
2009
,
with
974
such
claim
bring
in
2009
,
compare
to
759
in
2008
.
"
I
assume
this
figure
have
change
.
be
there
projection
for
repossession
in
2010
and
2011
?
to
what
extent
be
parent
who
act
as
guarantor
to
they
child
's
mortgage
or
that
who
release
equity
from
they
home
include
in
this
statistic
?
if
the
Oireachtas
be
to
introduce
effective
legislation
in
this
area
,
it
must
address
the
collation
of
accurate
statistic
on
who
be
affect
,
a
area
this
committee
should
examine
.
would
the
creation
of
a
standard
financial
statement
go
a
long
way
to
offset
that
type
of
problem
?
what
be
the
status
of
statutory
code
?
in
layman
's
term
,
if
a
financial
body
subscribe
to
a
voluntary
code
,
could
it
be
pertinent
to
any
evidence
to
a
court
?
I
thank
the
witness
for
the
excellent
report
.
I
be
sure
that
it
will
be
use
in
many
other
circle
in
relation
to
this
whole
issue
of
indebtedness
and
so
forth
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
we
and
we
shall
certainly
be
come
back
to
they
again
to
discuss
this
matter
further
.
