the
target
be
85
per
annum
reach
approximately
100
per
annum
up
to
2016
and
beyond
.
one
cannot
give
a
definitive
figure
because
many
variable
enter
into
the
fray
,
include
intellectual
property
and
commercialisation
of
research
,
but
the
most
important
point
be
that
we
be
in
a
space
where
we
be
seek
to
spin
out
as
many
company
as
possible
on
a
indigenous
basis
.
I
believe
the
number
for
last
year
be
31
.
one
would
hope
to
see
that
increase
but
on
the
high
potential
start
-
up
,
the
target
be
85
reach
a
final
target
of
approximately
100
per
year
from
2016
.
I
have
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Cunningham
yesterday
.
the
budget
line
be
important
because
the
event
,
which
will
take
place
in
mid-July
next
year
,
will
attract
researcher
and
person
within
the
scientific
community
at
the
high
level
to
we
shore
.
this
be
a
pan-European
win
,
so
to
speak
.
the
fact
that
we
be
able
to
win
that
competition
against
stiff
competition
from
place
like
Vienna
be
a
good
testament
to
where
we
stand
within
that
global
scientific
community
.
that
win
and
this
investment
be
vital
in
term
of
we
reputation
because
in
enable
we
to
attract
top
level
researcher
we
be
send
out
further
signal
into
the
research
and
science
field
.
that
will
result
in
add
win
for
we
in
the
future
.
we
will
gain
from
it
by
virtue
of
its
profiling
in
the
first
instance
.
the
programme
be
comprehensive
and
intensive
.
it
will
roll
out
across
the
State
over
the
12
month
but
will
be
focus
primarily
within
that
four
or
five
day
.
the
fact
that
there
will
be
industry
involvement
and
all
of
the
stakeholder
involve
over
that
four
or
five
day
will
ensure
we
will
be
able
to
lay
a
further
foundation
or
ramp
it
up
,
so
to
speak
,
to
ensure
we
can
make
further
gain
in
this
field
ultimately
in
term
of
foreign
direct
investment
.
one
way
of
look
at
the
overall
picture
it
be
to
consider
the
level
of
FDI
in
2003
,
for
example
.
in
that
year
,
the
proportion
of
IDA
client
win
with
a
research
and
development
component
be
approximately
10
%
,
value
at
€
120
million
.
in
2009
-
10
,
some
50
%
of
FDI
be
research
and
development
investment
and
it
be
value
at
€500
million
.
that
be
one
important
metric
upon
which
we
can
work
.
if
one
consider
the
budget
for
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
€
15.3
million
,
and
the
collaboration
involve
over
500
company
on
joint
research
initiative
,
one
will
note
the
arrangement
support
€
73
billion
in
export
.
it
be
a
valuable
component
but
we
need
to
consider
further
how
many
indigenous
company
we
can
spin
out
.
we
must
consider
whether
there
be
a
value
to
continue
with
the
investment
in
the
centre
of
excellence
and
research
cluster
.
I
believe
there
be
because
it
maintain
a
vital
FDI
component
because
of
the
collaboration
with
industry
.
one
must
take
cognisance
of
the
investment
in
basic
research
because
,
if
we
do
not
continue
to
invest
in
basic
and
apply
research
,
we
will
not
be
able
to
achieve
the
spin-out
in
the
medium
to
long
term
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
get
the
balance
right
between
the
investment
in
basic
and
apply
research
,
maintain
Science
Foundation
Ireland
investment
through
the
cluster
and
centre
of
excellence
and
try
to
set
metric
or
target
.
progress
from
basic
research
into
the
commercialisation
field
remain
a
challenge
.
we
must
ask
where
it
be
good
for
the
State
to
invest
.
this
conversation
be
take
place
and
will
continue
.
the
hosting
of
the
event
will
cost
€
6
million
.
the
Exchequer
contribution
over
the
period
2009
to
2012
be
to
be
€
2.973
million
.
the
funding
provide
for
2011
be
base
on
the
2009
decision
by
the
previous
government
.
one
will
not
know
the
win
until
the
event
take
place
;
they
can
not
be
project
.
we
want
to
use
the
event
as
a
showcase
for
Irish
science
and
research
across
all
the
discipline
.
let
we
consider
the
next
EU
framework
programme
,
which
I
be
tell
should
be
call
Horizon
2020
rather
than
Framework
8
.
if
we
be
involved
in
this
programme
in
its
early
stage
,
we
will
be
able
to
influence
funding
line
by
virtue
of
the
enhance
reputation
we
hope
to
gain
as
a
result
of
the
host
the
event
,
which
will
attract
top
researcher
and
scientist
from
across
the
world
.
there
will
be
a
win
for
tourism
in
that
5000
delegate
will
be
bring
to
the
Convention
Centre
Dublin
.
there
be
potential
for
delegate
to
spend
up
to
€
4.8
million
,
accord
to
one
estimate
,
and
to
raise
€
1.1
million
in
taxation
.
there
be
a
win
by
virtue
of
hold
the
event
itself
but
there
will
be
a
further
medium
-
term
gain
because
of
the
reputation
enhancement
.
to
what
be
the
deputy
refer
?
I
might
have
to
revert
to
the
deputy
on
that
.
I
have
no
explanation
for
that
at
present
.
forgive
I
for
not
be
able
to
answer
in
the
first
instance
.
the
figure
of
€
8.5
million
include
a
new
programme
of
€
2.5
million
bear
from
the
enterprise
platform
programme
which
be
transfer
from
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
it
be
fund
from
current
fund
.
I
can
get
deputy
O'Dea
a
more
comprehensive
explanation
in
writing
.
a
total
of
20
company
and
eight
research
group
win
new
contract
for
2010
amount
to
€
10
million
.
there
be
a
return
on
the
investment
.
I
visit
a
company
,
SensL
,
in
Cork
recently
,
which
be
do
work
in
this
space
.
the
subhead
support
indigenous
industry
and
start
-
up
.
one
would
have
have
a
healthy
scepticism
about
this
.
I
believe
we
be
get
the
return
on
the
investment
.

75

how
much
do

the
amount
over
and
above
the
increase
of
€
10.5
million
which
the

seek
for
cost

there
be
major
problem
for

I
understand
the

drag
its

on

it

for

now
that

will
any
of

my
second
question
relate
to
the
strategic

be
the

say
there
have
be
a

the
strategic

fund
?
he
say
a
amount
of
€
27
million
be
not

in

,
mainly
due
to
the
slow

progress
on

I
do
not
know
what
that
phrase
mean
in

I
would
guess
the
amount
allocate
be
not
take
up
or
be
be
stretch
from
2008
into
2009
.
the
minister
might
clarify
that
.
to
what
do
the
minister
attribute
the
significant

reduction
in
the

?
be
that
more
aspirational
than
factual
?
there
have
to

I
do
not

appear
to
be

receive

benefit
from
the

in
so
far
as
it
relate

I
should
point
out
that
the
receipt

assistance
for

service
from
the
education

board
be
not

to

any

he
or
she
relative

could
benefit

widen
eligibility
to
include

result

we
will

also

with

I
wish
to
say
at
this
point
that
it
remain
the
government
's
position
that
eligibility
for
the
new
fund
should
be
confine
to
former

.
the

this
support
.
it
be
always
clear
that
particular
fund
would
run
out

we
be
now
almost
at
that
point
.
I
appreciate
the
sentiment
express
by
the
deputy
regard
the
range
of
eligibility
issue
but
I
urge
they
to
see
the
sense
of
the
government
's
position
or
the
manner
in
which
we
be
try
to
operate
on
this
matter

in
speak
of
the
grouping
of
amendment
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
address
the
specific
point
make
.
on
second
stage
,
he
state
:
[
N
]
to
to
have
a
open
-
end
,
long
,
tortuous
,
bureaucratic
quango
come
into
existence
,
we
have
decide
pragmatically
,
in
the
full
knowledge
of
the
decision
we
be
make
,
that
we
would
use
the
database
of
the
15000
people
who
have
already
be
give
award
.
that
be
the
database
that
be
already
there
-
we
know
what
it
be
.
to
start
again
,
give
they
age
and
give
the
period
when
the
abuse
take
place
,
would
have
take
a
enormous
amount
of
time
in
term
of
process
and
verify
that
information
.
the
minister
have
be
clear
on
this
.
we
must
go
back
to
the
fact
that
if
it
be
open
up
again
,
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
the
number
of
person
who
would
come
forward
again
.
there
be
no
definitive
number
in
that
sense
.
in
term
of
expectation
,
if
the
eligibility
criterion
be
open
up
,
one
could
take
as
a
fair
barometer
the
940
application
which
be
not
deem
eligible
under
the
redress
board
application
.
the
good
approach
be
that
outline
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
on
second
Stage
,
which
be
to
proceed
on
the
basis
propose
in
the
Bill
.
the
question
of
review
eligibility
can
be
consider
after
the
fund
be
establish
in
the
event
of
there
not
be
a
significant
expenditure
of
the
fund
.
there
be
some
scope
.
I
must
,
therefore
,
oppose
the
amendment
.
I
will
respond
to
deputy
Ryan
's
point
first
.
when
I
mention
advertising
and
so
forth
,
I
do
so
to
show
that
the
State
seek
in
good
faith
to
reach
out
and
advertise
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
,
which
he
also
make
in
good
faith
.
a
amendment
require
a
review
within
a
certain
timeframe
could
be
consider
on
report
stage
,
but
only
follow
the
fund
's
establishment
.
at
that
time
,
the
committee
could
deliberate
with
the
minister
on
how
to
proceed
.
some
consideration
should
be
give
to
a
amendment
along
the
line
propose
.
I
will
reflect
this
point
of
view
to
the
minister
.
member
should
examine
the
amendment
's
wording
.
deputy
Crowe
's
state
"
eligible
to
apply
"
and
deputy
Smith
's
state
"
eligible
to
receive
"
,
but
eligibility
need
to
be
establish
.
if
person
do
not
come
forward
during
the
first
process
,
one
would
need
to
set
up
a
bureaucratic
mechanism
to
establish
eligibility
.
we
be
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
in
the
minister
's
opinion
,
a
estimate
of
15000
people
be
the
fair
way
to
deal
with
the
matter
.
he
have
be
clear
in
this
regard
.
we
do
not
know
what
the
number
be
,
as
they
range
from
a
few
people
to
a
couple
of
hundred
to
a
significant
cohort
,
depend
on
whom
one
ask
.
there
come
a
point
when
a
line
must
be
draw
.
I
do
not
want
to
use
emotive
language
and
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
sensitivity
involve
,
but
the
minister
state
he
intention
on
second
stage
clearly
.
we
will
oppose
the
amendment
.
with
all
due
respect
,
I
wish
to
establish
a
barometer
in
term
of
how
we
proceed
.
I
will
not
be
patronise
and
I
want
to
deal
with
the
deputy
respectfully
,
but
we
have
a
understanding
of
the
issue
at
hand
and
we
want
to
address
they
with
a
degree
of
sensitivity
and
respect
.
I
may
have
use
the
word
"
bureaucracy
"
but
I
be
not
sure
I
use
the
word
"
massive
bureaucracy
"
.
if
I
do
,
it
be
not
to
imply
that
a
whole
machine
would
have
to
be
create
around
this
.
the
central
point
be
that
the
fund
be
€
110
million
in
respect
of
which
15000
have
already
make
a
application
.
some
940
people
be
deem
ineligible
under
the
redress
process
because
they
be
not
resident
of
the
schedule
institution
.
on
the
legal
advice
issue
,
legal
advice
be
take
up
by
97
%
of
that
who
apply
under
the
original
scheme
.
that
advice
be
independent
legal
advice
which
the
people
seek
.
I
be
not
suggest
that
that
people
do
not
have
a
entitlement
to
that
legal
advice
,
I
be
merely
stress
it
be
independent
legal
advice
seek
by
they
.
person
have
a
degree
of
autonomy
and
discretion
in
term
of
whom
they
choose
as
they
legal
adviser
.
it
be
important
that
be
inherent
in
the
original
scheme
.
on
eligibility
to
apply
,
the
bureaucratic
aspect
arise
from
the
fact
that
we
would
again
now
have
to
establish
where
the
injury
take
place
,
which
re-open
the
whole
process
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
make
clear
he
position
in
regard
to
the
propose
amendment
.
clearly
a
annual
reporting
and
review
mechanism
could
be
establish
once
the
fund
be
establish
.
it
be
reasonable
to
ask
for
the
committee
to
have
due
regard
to
the
working
of
the
fund
or
review
the
process
.
we
should
all
adopt
a
open
mind
on
how
it
be
structure
.
when
the
minister
address
report
and
final
stage
there
should
be
some
response
to
the
suggestion
make
on
the
fund
,
its
use
,
and
where
spare
,
if
any
,
resource
be
deploy
.
at
this
stage
of
the
process
,
and
not
to
be
too
specific
,
I
acknowledge
that
the
issue
be
raise
,
that
the
minister
will
attend
for
the
next
stage
and
that
member
have
ask
that
he
have
regard
to
the
concern
that
they
raise
.
yes
,
there
be
potential
for
a
oversight
role
.
I
feel
strongly
that
I
should
not
make
a
definitive
statement
on
it
at
this
stage
.
the
minister
will
have
regard
to
the
process
and
,
effectively
,
with
due
deference
to
he
role
as
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
who
sit
at
cabinet
,
then
we
should
give
consideration
to
the
role
,
and
there
should
be
a
response
to
the
suggestion
.
the
fund
's
modus
operandi
should
be
determine
by
the
minister
.
there
will
be
a
annual
report
that
should
give
rise
to
a
process
in
term
of
how
it
be

,
examine
or
interpret

service
be
specifically
provide
for
in
section
8
of
the
Bill
as
a
class
of
approve
service
.
I
be
uncertain
as
to
the
intent
behind
some
of
the
propose
amendment
.
while
I
appreciate
the
concern
that
a
former
resident
's
exist
counsellor
be
retain
once
the
fund
be
establish
,
I
do
not
see
how
that
position
would
be
threaten
simply
because
the
fund
be
establish
.
person
can
continue
to
attend
they
exist
counsellor
,
which
may
be
fund
under
the
National
Counselling
Service
,
without
recourse
to
the
fund
.
if
individual
be
privately
attend
counsellor
and
wish
to
apply
to
the
fund
to
have
this
service
fund
,
the
person
could
advise
the
fund
of
this
preference
in
they
application
.
once
the
counsellor
meet
the
criterion
for
service
provider
specify
by
the
fund
,
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
why
the
fund
would
not
agree
to
such
a
arrangement
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
issue
such
as
this
be
a
concern
to
individual
former
resident
,
but
they
be
matter
of
detail
that
should
be
leave
to
the
fund
,
which
be
require
to
act
in
the
interest
of
the
former
resident
.
in
other
word
,
what
be
inherent
in
the
legislation
be
the
interest
of
former
resident
and
the
fund
,
by
its
nature
and
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
set
up
,
be
to
look
after
the
need
of
people
in
term
of
counselling
service
.
the
proposal
in
amendment
no.
10
that
a
one
-
off
payment
be
make
from
the
fund
be
not
acceptable
give
that
there
be
no
apparent
linkage
with
the
need
of
a
former
resident
.
the
purpose
of
the
fund
be
not
,
and
never
be
,
a
form
of
additional
compensation
.
that
issue
have
be
deal
with
by
the
redress
board
.
it
be
,
as
advocate
in
the
original
motion
pass
by
the
House
,
intend
for
the
support
of
victim
.
eligible
former
resident
will
have
a
range
of
need
,
with
some
likely
to
require
more
significant
intervention
than
other
,
and
the
approach
set
out
in
the
Bill
be
intend
to
support
this
need
.
on
that
basis
,
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
I
would
like
to
open
this
up
a
little
because
it
be
worthy
of
discussion
.
we
agree
counselling
be
a
statutory
entitlement
provide
by
the
National
Counselling
Service
.
if
it
be
a
statutory
entitlement
,
I
do
not
see
the
need
for
this
amendment
,
and
I
say
that
respectfully
because
there
be
a
class
of
approve
service
in
section
8
.
I
do
not
dispute
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
and
I
understand
the
spirit
in
which
the
amendment
be
tab
.
my
instinct
be
perhaps
to
look
at
this
on
report
stage
but
clarity
around
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
need
.
I
understand
the
point
make
in
regard
to
fear
people
have
about
autonomy
and
so
on
.
be
there
a
inherent
fear
that
somehow
the
service
will
be
reduce
or
withdraw
at
some
future
date
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
perhaps
this
can
be
revisit
at
a
late
stage
and
further
clarification
can
be
provide
by
the
minister
.
I
would
like
to
ensure
deputy
Crowe
,
or
any
deputy
,
have
access
at
all
time
to
the
official
in
the
Department
.
if
deputy
Crowe
wish
to
discuss
that
specific
issue
with
the
official
,
there
be
no
problem
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
require
the
board
to
make
information
available
in
regard
to
its
function
to
all
applicant
to
the
redress
board
.
as
the
deputy
will
be
aware
,
more
than
900
application
to
the
redress
board
be
withdraw
,
refuse
or
result
in
no
award
generally
on
the
grounds
that
they
be
not
resident
in
schedule
institution
as
define
in
the
act
.
I
do
not
believe
the
amendment
be
require
.
there
be
no
need
to
contact
the
900
plus
person
to
whom
I
refer
as
they
will
not
be
eligible
to
benefit
from
the
fund
.
furthermore
,
there
be
no
mechanism
for
do
so
due
to
the
confidentiality
restriction
of
the
redress
process
.
the
intention
of
the
scheme
be
to
oblige
the
board
to
make
information
available
on
its
function
to
former
resident
.
I
respectfully
argue
that
the
amendment
be
not
necessary
and
,
therefore
,
I
can
not
accept
it
.
I
will
respond
to
the
amendment
first
and
will
then
maybe
engage
further
with
deputy
Crowe
on
it
.
the
amendment
propose
would
require
the
board
to
correspond
with
all
applicant
who
apply
to
the
redress
board
,
even
that
who
do
not
receive
a
award
.
as
I
say
in
regard
to
the
previous
amendment
,
it
be
not
permissible
to
contact
individual
recipient
of
redress
board
award
due
to
the
confidentiality
provision
of
the
2002
Act
.
the
Bill
empower
the
redress
board
to
provide
awardee
's
name
,
address
and
date
of
birth
to
the
statutory
fund
which
will
enable
the
fund
to
verify
applicant
's
entitlement
to
apply
.
that
be
the
only
purpose
for
which
the
information
can
be
use
.
the
Attorney
General
's
office
have
advise
that
any
direct
unsolicited
communication
with
survivor
could
be
open
to
a
challenge
as
it
might
encroach
on
they
right
to
privacy
under
the
Constitution
and
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
the
redress
board
process
be
strictly
confidential
with
the
unauthorised
disclosure
of
information
be
a
criminal
offence
under
the
2002
residential
Institution
Redress
Act
.
apart
from
the
strict
legal
issue
,
the
deputy
will
also
be
aware
that
issue
relate
to
abuse
be
extremely
sensitive
and
the
send
of
unsolicited
letter
to
person
's
private
address
could
pose
difficulty
.
as
be
note
on
second
Stage
,
some
survivor
have
still
not
tell
they
partner
what
they
experience
in
childhood
.
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
deputy
Crowe
make
and
the
spirit
in
which
the
amendment
be
tab
.
I
utterly
agree
with
the
sincerity
of
the
amendment
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
deputy
Crowe
and
he
desire
to
ensure
we
learn
from
the
mistake
of
the
past
and
provide
for
a
degree
of
probity
in
this
matter
.
the
amendment
appear
to
require
the
board
to
engage
consultant
only
by
way
of
fix
-
term
contract
and
provide
for
a
annual
review
mechanism
involve
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
while
I
appreciate
that
the
objective
behind
the
amendment
may
be
to
restrict
in
some
way
the
use
of
consultant
,
a
legislative
approach
be
not
appropriate
for
such
a
matter
.
the
amendment
appear
to
assume
that
consultant
and
legal
adviser
will
be
appoint
on
a
regular
basis
.
it
be
not
clear
on
what
basis
this
assumption
be
make
.
it
be
the
government
's
intention
that
the
use
of
such
external
adviser
be
keep
to
a
minimum
,
while
enable
the
board
to
fulfil
its
mandate
.
the
use
of
fix
-
term
contract
may
not
be
the
most
appropriate
or
cost
-
effective
way
to
bring
in
such
expertise
.
the
board
should
be
give
flexibility
to
choose
the
most
appropriate
way
of
deal
with
the
issue
,
subject
to
overall
public
service
guideline
in
this
matter
.
the
board
will
require
ministerial
approval
to
enter
into
contract
or
engage
consultant
.
I
believe
this
be
sufficient
oversight
of
the
arrangement
.
section
7(
3
)
state
:
in
perform
any
function
confer
on
it
by
or
under
this
act
,
the
board
shall
have
regard
to
the
existence
of
publicly
available
service
and
the
need
to
secure
the
most
beneficial
,
effective
and
efficient
use
of
the
resource
available
in
the
investment
account
.
we
would
argue
that
the
subsection
would
sufficiently
cover
the
spirit
of
the
point
raise
by
deputy
Crowe
.
I
see
where
the
deputy
be
come
from
.
perhaps
there
could
be
further
consultation
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
if
the
amendment
be
withdraw
,
on
how
the
matter
could
be
clarify
to
ensure
the
deputy
's
concern
be
address
.
I
refer
member
to
section
10
(
1
)
in
respect
of
direction
of
the
minister
,
which
state
:
the
minister
may
,
in
relation
to
the
performance
by
the
board
of
its
function
,
give
a
direction
in
writing
to
the
board
require
it
to
comply
with
such
policy
of
the
government
as
be
specify
in
the
direction
.
the
power
of
the
minister
be
clear
in
term
of
give
the
direction
but
in
keep
with
the
concern
raise
by
the
Deputy
,
this
be
a
matter
that
could
be
discuss
at
a
late
stage
.
we
discuss
this
issue
during
the
debate
on
amendment
no.
7
.
the
effect
of
this
amendment
would
be
to
extend
eligibility
for
the
fund
to
the
child
and
grandchild
of
former
resident
in
so
far
as
educational
service
be
concerned
.
they
would
also
include
employment
opportunity
.
I
be
aware
that
the
Education
Finance
Board
provide
significant
support
both
to
former
resident
and
they
relative
and
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
€
12.7
million
fund
set
aside
for
educational
purpose
under
the
2002
indemnity
agreement
be
now
virtually
exhaust
.
through
this
Bill
,
the
government
be
now
focus
on
meet
the
need
of
former
resident
across
a
range
of
service
area
,
have
regard
to
the
available
money
and
the
potential
number
eligible
to
apply
.
I
believe
that
to
do
this
effectively
,
it
must
confine
itself
to
the
eligible
former
resident
.
on
that
basis
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
there
be
not
unanimity
across
group
represent
survivor
on
this
particular
issue
.
the
fund
be
€
110
million
and
there
be
15000
potential
beneficiary
,
but
there
be
also
the
student
grant
scheme
which
have
income
threshold
,
and
41
%
of
full
-
time
undergraduate
high
education
student
be
in
receipt
of
such
grant
.
therefore
,
there
be
statutory
scheme
in
place
already
with
clear
income
threshold
for
which
the
child
and
grandchild
of
the
former
resident
be
eligible
.
I
would
again
like
to
restate
that
a
review
of
eligibility
under
the
fund
be
possible
if
the
demand
be
not
significant
.
that
be
where
the
review
element
of
this
come
in
and
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
will
respond
to
it
at
a
further
stage
.
we
be
say
that
we
cannot
accept
the
amendment
,
but
there
could
be
further
discussion
of
this
at
a
late
stage
.
however
,
I
think
the
minister
be
clear
about
this
on
second
Stage
.
can
the
deputy
clarify
the
2.8
%
figure
?
how
do
we
know
that
?
the
confidentiality
arrangement
inherent
within
the
initial
redress
scheme
-----
be
it
the-----
I
be
not
dispute
it
,
but
I
would
like
to
seek
clarification
on
that
.
if
there
be
a
withdrawal
of
the
amendment
at
this
juncture
-----
there
could
be
further
discussion
without
prejudice
to
see
if
the
minister
could
take
it
on
board
at
a
late
stage
.
it
be
important
to
remember
that
the
€
12.7
million
fund
set
aside
for
educational
purpose
be
virtually
exhaust
,
and
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
for
this
process
.
we
have
speak
about
the
issue
.
we
have
be
very
specific
about
the
€
12.7
million
fund
and
the
fact
that
there
be
a
significant
fund
available
for
educational
attainment
through
the
Education
Finance
Board
.
in
fairness
,
the
State
have
give
a
clear
commitment
on
that
so
the
State
's
response
be
measure
in
that
sense
.
however
,
there
be
scope
to
have
further
discussion
on
the
issue
raise
in
amendment
Nosemcue
7
,
15
and
16
and
the
minister
will
give
a
clear
direction
on
they
at
a
late
stage
.
I
speak
to
the
spirit
of
everything
that
have
be
say
today
.
no
one
with
a
shred
of
humanity
in
he
heart
would
disagree
or
fail
to
empathise
with
what
be
be
say
but
I
must
be
clear
about
the
scope
of
the
Bill
.
it
go
beyond
its
scope
to
introduce
a
statutory
entitlement
.
nevertheless
I
take
in
good
faith
the
argument
make
.
this
amendment
have
be
disallow
.
however
,
on
report
stage
there
should
be
a
conversation
on
meet
the
physical
need
,
include
housing
and
shelter
of
person
who
find
themselves
in
this
morass
.
liais
mechanism
have
be
set
up
and
be
available
try
to
assist
people
with
this
physical
need
.
this
be
already
inherent
and
available
under
various
other
pillar
.
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
there
be
no
plan
to
introduce
a
statutory
entitlement
.
the
amendment
have
be
disallow
but
give
the
progress
of
the
legislation
it
should
give
rise
to
a
further
discussion
on
report
stage
.
that
be
the
good
we
can
do
at
this
stage
.
deputy
Daly
propose
the
deletion
of
section
8
(
4
)
in
its
entirety
.
the
subsection
be
a
important
provision
,
however
,
in
that
it
give
the
board
the
flexibility
to
determine
different
class
.
this
be
class
not
in
a
class
sense
as
we
understand
it
but
in
term
of
try
to
define
a
range
of
subject
,
service
,
people
or
former
resident
.
it
provide
the
board
with
flexibility
,
therefore
,
in
term
of
the
determination
of
service
.
for
example
,
it
could
set
different
entitlement
depend
on
the
age
of
former
resident
.
it
be
not
intend
to
be
restrictive
or
exclusive
;
the
opposite
be
the
case
.
it
be
design
to
give
the
board
the
flexibility
it
need
to
meet
the
wide
range
of
need
of
former
resident
.
I
be
rather
concerned
at
the
proposal
to
delete
the
wording
set
out
in
the
Bill
and
I
oppose
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
language
be
all
important
in
this
process
.
ultimately
,
this
section
serve
to
ensure
that
a
flexibility
be
available
.
it
be
like
refer
to
a
class
of
car
.
it
speak
to
the
range
of
service
and
there
should
be
some
flexibility
inherent
in
it
.
the
word
be
use
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
.
with
respect
to
the
deputy
,
I
suggest
the
word
"
type
"
be
bad
because
a
"
type
"
of
former
resident
could
be
deem
in
certain
circumstance
to
be
interpret
as
pejorative
as
well
.
let
we
normalise
the
word
"
class
"
here
and
now
:
it
be
a
normal
word
.
there
be
no
subjective
nature
to
it
.
the
spirit
of
the
word
"
class
"
in
this
sense
be
to
ensure
there
be
flexibility
around
the
range
of
service
that
can
be
provide
.
I
be
unsure
whether
another
word
could
be
use
.
"
Class
"
be
a
rather
innocuous
word
and
no
offence
be
intend
by
it
.
for
the
purpose
of
design
the
legislation
it
give
flexibility
in
term
of
the
determination
of
service
.
it
be
important
to
nail
this
down
so
that
there
be
no
misinterpretation
.
let
we
suppose
we
be
discuss
social
protection
legislation
for
the
over
70
.
that
segment
of
the
population
would
be
class
as
the
over
70
.
it
be
a
class
of
the
population
.
with
all
due
respect
,
one
must
class
subsection
when
deal
with
legislation
.
the
aim
in
this
instance
be
to
ensure
flexibility
in
the
determination
of
service
.
if
the
service
be
be
define
,
there
have
to
be
a
class
of
service
or
category
.
there
be
nothing
pejorative
or
demeaning
in
the
use
of
the
word
"
class
"
in
this
instance
.
it
do
not
seek
to
stigmatise
anyone
in
any
way
;
that
be
not
the
intent
in
the
use
of
the
word
.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
preclude
the
board
from
include
in
its
criterion
a
provision
that
would
require
it
to
take
into
consideration
the
financial
circumstance
of
a
applicant
.
the
purpose
of
the
fund
be
to
allow
it
to
target
the
need
of
former
resident
.
by
remove
the
power
of
the
board
to
include
financial
circumstance
in
its
criterion
potentially
it
would
allow
a
former
resident
with
extensive
means
to
apply
to
the
board
and
receive
support
and
service
on
the
same
basis
as
a
less
wealthy
individual
,
whereas
the
objective
be
to
meet
the
need
of
that
most
in
need
.
I
emphasise
that
this
provision
be
not
intend
to
introduce
a
general
means
test
application
to
the
fund
.
it
will
be
a
matter
for
the
fund
to
have
regard
to
the
need
to
take
account
of
a
individual
's
financial
circumstance
when
determine
its
criterion
for
its
decision
.
this
provision
be
most
assuredly
not
intend
as
a
way
of
prevent
vulnerable
person
in
need
from
benefit
from
the
support
that
will
be
available
under
the
fund
.
therefore
,
I
cannot
support
the
amendment
.
section
14
(

)
allow
the
board
to
designate
a
staff
member
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
event
of
that
officer
be
absence
or
the
position
be
vacant
.
this
be
a
reasonable
provision
and
while
such
situation
may
be
rare
,
they
may
occur
from
time
to
time
.
the
amendment
would
have
the
effect
of
prevent
any
member
of
staff
,
include
one
designate
by
the
board
under
section
14
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
,
from
give
evidence
before
a
committee
of
Dáil
Éireann
.
I
find
the
proposal
a
little
strange
and
I
be
unclear
why
a
acting
chief
executive
officer
could
not
come
before
a
Oireachtas
committee
to
answer
question
on
various
issue
.
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
if
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
wish
to
examine
issue
relate
to
the
book
and
account
of
the
fund
,
it
should
be
preclude
from
call
the
senior
staff
member
of
the
fund
to
appear
before
it
.
I
be
unclear
why
the
fund
should
be
treat
differently
from
other
public
body
.
we
be
all
commit
to
ensure
full
accountability
and
I
be
not
sure
the
amendment
would
sustain
that
level
of
accountability
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
that
have
be
make
.
one
might
interpret
the
amendment
as
make
a
certain
point
about
the
power
of
the
Oireachtas
in
term
of
summon
witness
before
it
.
I
refer
here
to
the
spirit
as
oppose
to
the
letter
of
the
law
.
the
reality
,
however
,
be
that
there
be
no
precedent
,
in
so
far
as
I
be
aware
,
where
a
chief
executive
officer
of
a
statutory
body
or
fund
have
fail
to
appear
before
the
Oireachtas
on
be
summon
.
it
be
pertinent
and
proper
to
ensure
that
the
board
can
designate
its
staff
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
event
of
the
latter
's
absence
or
the
position
be
vacant
.
that
be
common
sense
.
the
board
could
likewise
decide
to
take
that
action
.
the
key
point
here
be
that
we
should
not
undermine
we
own
role
as
legislator
in
term
of
the
ability
to
summon
people
before
we
,
as
per
deputy
Smith
's
point
.
I
acknowledge
the
argument
he
have
make
in
that
sense
.
I
cannot
accept
the
deputy
's
amendment
.
despite
the
difficult
economic
circumstance
,
a
cap
of
€
5000
per
annum
on
the
remuneration
,
allowance
and
expense
of
the
staff
of
the
board
would
be
punitive
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
deputy
have
include
the
amendment
under
this
section
in
error
.
subsection
(

)
state
:
the
member
of
the
board
shall
,
subject
to
the
provision
of
this
act
,
hold
office
on
such

and
condition
(
include

)
as
may
be
determine
by
the
minister
,
with
the
approval
of
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
there
be
no
provision
in
the
Bill
for
remuneration
of
board
member
.
to
clarify
,
they
will
be
entitle
only
to

.
it
be
a
non-remunerated
board
.
deputy
Crowe
's
amendment
relate
to
section
17
,
the
provision
of
which
relate
to
the
staff
of
the
board
.
there
be
a
distinction
between
person
employ
as
administrator
and
that
who
be
member
of
the
board
.
what
be
propose
here
might
not
be
deem
to
be
a
charge
on
the
exchequer
for
the
purpose
of
consider
the
amendment
but
it
would
be
hugely
costly
to
undertake
large
print
run
of
the
report
in
order
to
furnish
copy
to
every
public
library
across
the
State
.
it
be
the
norm
in
this
day
and
age
that
annual
report
and
other
public
document
be
publish
electronically
and
access
online
.
the
amendment
also
place
a
requirement
on
the
board
that
the
placement
of
the
report
in
public
library
be
advertise
in
local
and
national
newspaper
.
that
potential
cost
alone
oblige
I
to
reject
the
amendment
.
there
be
sufficient
way
of
bring
report
of
this
nature
into
the
public
domain
.
the
cost
of
disseminate
they
to
local
library
and
advertising
same
would
be
utterly
prohibitive
.
the
question
arise
as
to
who
would
fund
that
cost
and
how
it
would
be
determine
.
I
assure
member
that
I
acknowledge
the
spirit
of
the
proposal
they
have
bring
forward
.
I
appreciate
that
deputy
Crowe
be
endeavour
to
ensure
that
any
payment
make
to
former
resident
will
not
affect
they
social
welfare
entitlement
in
this
jurisdiction
or
outside
the
State
.
I
be
sympathetic
to
the
general
principle
involve
.
however
,
I
do
not
believe
that
this
legislation
be
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
address
the
concern
raise
.
the
board
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
ensure
a
outcome
such
as
that
intend
.
a
amendment
to
the
social
welfare
regulation
would
,
if
deem
necessary
,
be
more
appropriate
.
this
issue
could
certainly
be
pursue
in
the
event
that
difficulty
emerge
down
the
line
.
the
deputy
will
also
appreciate
that
the
Oireachtas
cannot
legislate
in
respect
of
the
affair
of
other
jurisdiction
.
a
provision
such
as
that
be
propose
be
unenforceable
.
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
let
we
keep
in
mind
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
,
namely
,
to
provide
service
in
the
first
instance
.
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
Department
of
social
Protection
should
liaise
further
in
respect
of
the
issue
he
have
outline
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
this
should
be
do
prior
to
report
stage
.
if
the
deputy
so
wish
,
we
can
engage
in
such
a
exercise
.
if
it
relate
to
matter
outside
the
jurisdiction
,
then
it
would
be
unenforceable
.
again
,
let
we
keep
in
mind
that
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
and
be
proactive
in
term
of
meet
people
's
need
.
it
be
not
mean
to
place
a
block
in
the
way
of
application
.
the
amendment
seek
to
delete
section
20
(
4
)
(
b
)
,
the
provision
contain
in
which
be
reasonable
in
the
context
of
assist
the
board
in
consider
application
.
it
be
not
unreasonable
for
the
board
to
seek
certain
basic
information
or
consent
from
applicant
.
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
information
will
be
seek
for
the
purpose
of
assist
in
the
consideration
of
application
.
if
a
applicant
fail
to
provide
information
,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
board
to
refuse
to
consider
the
matter
further
until
such
information
be
provide
.
it
be
on
this
basis
that
we
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
if
the
deputy
be
seek
to
soften
the
language
use
or
the
approach
be
take
,
I
can
appreciate
what
she
be
try
to
do
.
again
,
however
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
people
in
a
positive
fashion
.
one
cannot
then
be
prescriptive
or
set
out
schedule
as
to
how
people
in
vary
circumstance
should
be
deal
with
.
that
may
not
be
what
the
deputy
be
drive
at
but
she
can
clarify
the
position
when
she
respond
.
I
accept
that
there
be
sensitivity
involve
but
we
must
create
a
scenario
whereby
employee
of
the
fund
who
be
deal
with
request
for
funding
or
a
service
will
be
allow
to
gather
any
information
which
may
be
require
.
it
be
also
necessary
to
put
in
place
structure
to
deal
with
instance
where
request
for
such
information
be
refuse
,
namely
,
a
application
will
not
proceed
unless
the
require
information
be
furnish
.
I
be
of
the
opinion
that
this
be
reasonable
because
,
by
its
very
nature
,
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
people
.
I
be
go
to
stick
to
my
gun
on
this
one
on
the
basis
that
this
be
enable
legislation
.
to
use
the
example
of
medical
circumstance
where
assistance
be
be
provide
in
that
respect
,
one
must
have
regard
to
a
individual
's
medical
circumstance
.
if
one
do
not
have
the
information
,
one
cannot
make
a
determination
and
proceed
any
further
with
a
application
.
once
the
fund
be
set
up
,
one
must
have
a
mechanism
to
provide
structure
to
allow
the
board
to
refuse
to
consider
a
applicant
if
the
person
be
remiss
in
not
yield
certain
information
.
there
must
be
a
degree
of
co-operation
,
otherwise
the
process
become
intractable
.
one
could
have
a
body
of
case
await
a
determination
that
could
drag
on
for
year
.
we
need
to
be
able
to
expedite
every
case
efficiently
to
ensure
that
that
who
will
become
client
of
the
service
want
to
ensure
there
be
a
efficiency
build
into
the
service
in
order
that
it
run
smoothly
and
in
they
favour
.
I
do
not
believe
there
be
anything
wrong
with
what
be
be
suggest
in
subsection
4
(
b
)
.
it
state
,
''
enable
the
board
to
refuse
to
further
consider
the
application
if
the
request
under
paragraph
(
a
)
be
not

with
and
the
board
may
so
request
or
refuse
to
further
consider
the
application
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
''
.
any
public

I
know
of
who
deal
on
a
front
-
of
-
house
basis
with
individual
or
fellow
citizen

seek
to
assist
a
person
along
but
if
the
person
do
not
co-operate
or
stonewall
in
term
of
provide
particular
information
,
there
come
a
time
when
one
must
make
a
call
on
it
,
and
this
provision
allow
for
that
.
one
must
reflect
on
the
spirit
of

,
not

I
would
point
out
that

the
unauthorised

provide
for
it
to
be
a
criminal
offence

I
fail
to
see
that
either
of

necessary
or
that
they
add
to

I
do
not

that
there

perhaps
there

much

give
that
the

unnecessary

I
do
not

I
will
get
a
explanation

the

can

to

it
.
the

to

propose
that
no

shall
be
make

I
suggest
that

must
think
carefully
about
how
one
would
communicate
that
,
to
whom
and
to
which
house
it
would
go

must

nobody

there
be
no

I
appreciate
the
motivation
behind

I
cannot

if

it

state
that

the

in
the
idea
that
we

the
right

we

by
pass
this
amendment
,
we
will
fight

against
the
idea
that
we
should

the

well
that

have
build
in
that
obsolescence
,
we
as
consumer
should
have
the
right
to
repair
the
same
product
.
I
be
speak
specifically
about
smartphone
and
tablet
,
but
we
be
also
see
it
now
in
kindle
,
coffee
machine
,
large
household
appliance
and
the
whole
panoply
of
product
that
be
sell
to
consumer
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
we
that
we
should
not
be
move
ahead
of
prospective
EU
legislation
but
,
by
accept
the
amendment
,
there
be
a
opportunity
for
he
to
be
radical
and
for
Ireland
to
become
a
leader
in
ensure
that
we
as

in
the
right
to

the
product
sell

we
as
we

fit
,
that
consumer
be
not
penalise
and
that
the
same
conglomerate
do
not
go
after
entity
that
repurpose
or
refurbish
iPhones
or
,
to
keep
this
generic
,
smartphone
.
my
amendment
will
not
be
accept
,
so
I
be
anticipate
that
I
will
be
revisit
this
matter
on
report
stage
.
in
anticipation
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
,
I
will
not
be
press
the
amendment
,
but
I
wish
to
keep
it
on
the
agenda
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
fight
back
.
I
be
sick
of
the
fact
that
if
I
purchase
a
iPhone
,
the
software
architecture
of
which
allow
the
hardware
to
work
with
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
email
,
WhatsApp
and
all
of
the
other
software
that
we
need
to
survive
in
the
modern
world

process
and
the
software
start
slowing
down
after
two
year
and
the

cannot

replace
.
there
be
no
means
by
which
someone
can
continue
use
the
product
for
which
he
or
she
have
shell
out
considerable
amount

money
.
person
be
sick
of
the
fact
that
they
be
sit
on
a
mountain
of
this
electronic
detritus
.
they
be
sick
of
the
fact
that
phone
be
lock
or
brick
,
to
use
that
term
.
they
want
to
buy
product
that
be
recyclable
,
repairable
and
design
to
last
long
,
and
that
be
essentially
what
this
amendment
,
as
long
winded
and
all
as
it
be
,
be
about
.
I
see
no
reason
to
say
anything
else
.
I
wish
to
hear
what
the
Minister
of
State
have
to
say
on
my
amendment
.
I
sometimes
feel
-
I
would
have
be
accuse
of
this
in
the
past
as
a
minister
of
State
-
that
we
be
perhaps
hide
behind
EU
rule
.
however
,
I
think
there
be
a
opportunity
within
the
amendment
not
to
fall
foul
of
EU
rule
,
because
we
be
merely
give
a
additional
right
to
the
consumer
to
have
that
which
they
have
purchase
in
good
faith
to
be
repair
.
the
amendment
describe
a
particular
element
.
it
read
:
"
in
relation
to
equipment
with
a
electronic
security
lock
or
other
security
-
related
function
,
the
manufacturer
shall
make
available
to
the
owner
and
to
independent
repair
provider
,
on
fair
and
reasonable
term
and
through
secure
datum
release
system
where
appropriate
,
any
special
document
,
tool
or
part
need
to
disable
the
lock
or
function
,
and
to
reset
it
,
for
the
purpose
of
diagnosis
,
maintenance
or
repair
of
the
equipment
.
"
I
do
not
see
how
that
be
injurious
to
the
rights
of
the
manufacturer
in
term
of
fair
competition
rule
from
a
EU
point
of
view
or
maximum
harmonisation
rule
.
again
,
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
be
frankly
not
of
a
mind
to
accept
the
amendment
.
if
I
understand
the
Minister
of
State
correctly
,
he
be
sympathetic
to
what
the
amendment
seek
to
do
.
however
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
talk
about
the
circular
economy
-
there
be
legislation
before
we
on
that
very
issue
-
I
think
people
be
just
absolutely
feed
up
with
the
idea
of
build
-
in
obsolescence
.
I
think
we
have
cross
the
Rubicon
of
people
's
patience
around
it
.
this
amendment
,
in
its
own
small
way
,
seek
to
push
back
against
this
rampant
consumerism
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
he
will
repair
and
fix
shoe
leather
and
I
be
of
a
similar
mind
.
there
be
a
strong
movement
around
people
not
necessarily
want
the
good
,
new
or
shiny
,
but
want
to
repair
,
reuse
and
recycle
.
longevity
be
a
key
thing
now
in
term
of
product
that
we
purchase
.
I
will
withdraw
the
amendment
.
however
,
I
seek
to
submit
it
again
or
have
it
revisit
on
report
stage
.
I
move
amendment
no.

without

I
would
like
to
hear
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
before
I
speak
to
the
amendment
.
the
justification
for
the
amendment
be
the
live
experience
of
consumer
who
take
out
contract
,
with
broadband
provider
in
particular
.
often
,
the
consumer
purchase
a
broadband
product
,
such
as
fibre
to
the
home
or
a
copper
line
,
that
be
advertise
as
provide
1
gb
but
it
provide
less
than
that
and
there
be
dropout
and
blackout
in
the
service
provision
.
the
consumer
might
pay
€
80
for
that
.
I
raise
this
on
second
stage
.
I
know
there
be
a
withholding
arrangement
build
into
the
legislation
in
relation
to
money
.
I
fully
accept
that
I
may
not
be
on
the
right
track
here
so
I
have
a
open
mind
on
this
matter
.
I
be
try
to
ensure
that
,
where
the
consumer
go
through
all
the
step
with
the
provider
and
where
it
be
find
that
the
trader
do
not
adhere
fully
to
the
legislation
,
there
be
a
stick
build
in
whereby
the
provider
will
become
guilty
of
a
offence
.
we
have
enough
anecdotal
evidence
base
on
we
own
experience
as
public
representative
of
service
have
fail
people
where
there
be
a
contract
to
supply
.
I
be
open
to
correction
on
this
but
there
do
not
appear
to
be
sufficient
penalty
build
in
to
ensure
manners
be
put
on
the
provider
.
this
amendment
seek
to
provide
some
remedy
for
the
consumer
,
as
well
as
some
penalty
for
the
provider
.
most
people
's
experience
be
positive

that

a
scheme
that

unambiguous
in
its
nature
will
provide
a
clear
charter
,
for
want
of
a

,
to
the
consumer
and
the
provider
where
there
be
a

understanding

thank

I
be
grateful
to
you
for
you
forbearance
in
allow
I
to
speak
to
the
amendment
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Duncan
Smith
,
receive
correspondence
from
you
on
2
June
where
you
express
regret
at
the
fact
that
amendment
no.
97
be
not
relevant
to
the
provision
of
the
Bill
,
could
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
and
must
be
rule
out
of
order
in
accordance
with
standing
order
187
(
1
)
and
212(
3
)
.
we
put
forward
this
amendment
on
the
basis
that
we
wish
to
support
the
government
's
attempt
to
ensure
there
be
a
meaningful
piece
of
legislation
on
climate
action
and
low
carbon
development
.
I
merely
wish
,
from
a
procedural
point
of
view
,
to
understand
the
logic
of
disallow
the
amendment
,
which
seek
a
sectoral
adaptation
plan
in
respect
of
afforestation
and
target
therein
,
and
similarly
in
respect
of
the
remediation
of
bog
without
imping
whatsoever
on
individual
's
turbary
rights
,
in
the
first
instance
.
I
would
hope
that
the
chairman
or
perhaps
the
minister
of
State
could
help
my
understanding
of
the
logic
behind
the
decision
to
disallow
the
amendment
in
the
first
place
.
that
be
merely
what
I
wish
to
ascertain
.
second
,
and
depend
on
the
answer
to
that
,
I
do
not
see
how
a
sectoral
adaptation
plan
in
relation
to
afforestation
which
I
would
consider
to
be
germane
to
the
issue
of
climate
action
could
be
injurious
to
a
Bill
of
this
nature
unless
,
of
course
,
it
be
a
matter
of
interpret
the
Minister
of
State
's
position
thus
far
,
which
be
that
"
not
...
everything
...
need
to
be
stuff
into
this
Bill
"
.
I
would
have
think
that
afforestation
target
be
absolutely
germane
to
this
legislation
.
while
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
Senator
Hackett
,
in
relation
to
she
current
afforestation
travail
,
notwithstand
the
challenge
in
relation
to
licensing
,
the
Labour
Party
strongly
feel
there
be
a
issue
here
that
be
absolutely
germane
to
the
issue
of
climate
action
.
I
wish
to
seek
a
justification
for
rule
that
amendment
out
of
order
.
thank
you
,
chair
,
for
allow
I
to
intercede
.
I
appreciate
it
.
thank
you
,
Chairman
.
may
I
make
just
one
very
brief
intervention
in
ten
second
or
less
?
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
respond
to
I
,
I
would
be
ever
so
grateful
.
the
Bill
,
by
its
nature
,
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
do
,
could
be
argue
to
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
if
you
take
some
of
that
amendment
that
have
be
accept
.
I
refer
to
the
interpretation
here
.
I
would
love
to
have
see
the
advice
of
the
Oireachtas
official
in
respect
of
this
one
.
I
wish
merely
to
argue
that
every
action
in
here
and
within
this
legislation
where
amendment
be
accept
could
arguably
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
.
we
find
the
decoupling
of
afforestation
target
from
this
legislation
to
be
extremely
incongruous
to
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
give
I
some
response
or
some
word
of
comfort
regard
the
effect
of
afforestation
target
-
this
be
a
major
issue
now
-
I
would
gladly
accept
that
comment
.
indeed
,
I
would
gladly
accept
any
offer
that
the
Minister
of
State
might
make
for
further
engagement
on
the
issue
.
chair
,
I
thank
you
again
for
you
patience
.
that
be
a
pity
.
thank
you
,
chair
.
one
would
always
accept
the
ruling
of
the
chair
and
one
would
always
be
deferential
to
the
chair
.
I
implore
you
to
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
the
issue
of
afforestation
target
in
particular
.
that
would
give
we
a
sense
,
while
promulgate
this
legislation
,
of
where
the
Minister
of
State
stand
in
respect
of
afforestation
target
in
particular
.
I
think
that
would
be
really
useful
.

on

the

be
that
the

introduce

we
opportunity

debate
this
,
if
I
may
finish
the
point
briefly
—
—
if
the

be
be
a
little

,
I
ask

to
consider
that
the
Opposition
be

to
ask
any
question
,
no
matter
how
spurious
the
minister
think
they
be
.
the

of

suggest
otherwise
,
with

I
ask
the
chairman
for
he
forbearance
at
the
outset
,
because
we
will
operate
a
question
-
and
-
answer
format
while
I
have
the
floor
.
yes
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
and
wish
he
well
in
he
new
role
.
I
have
a
few
policy
-
related
question
.
he
say
in
he
speech
that
he
would
fulfil
the
exist
level
of
service
and
there
would
be
no
policy
change
.
I
want
to
flesh
this
out
.
do
he
mean
the
status
quo
will
obtain
from
2015
to
2016
and
there
will
be
no
new
departure
in
term
of
policy
implementation
,
particularly
for
the
management
of
heritage
?
I
note
that
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
heritage
service
.
he
mention
very
specific
site
and
talk
about
co-operate
with
Fáilte
Ireland
on
initiative
such
as
Ireland
's
ancient
East
and
the
wild
Atlantic
Way
.
a
pot
of
approximately
€
65
million
have
be
make
available
for
capital
project
by
Fáilte
Ireland
.
how
will
that
money
be
disburse
?
will
it
be
disburse
outside
the
keynote
site
that
be
normally
refer
to
in
term
of
tourist
attraction
?
he
refer
specifically
to
Kilmainham
Gaol
,
Glendalough
,
Clonmacnoise
and
Killarney
National
Park
.
there
be
other
site
that
I
would
advocate
,
such
as
Doneraile
Wildlife
Park
in
Cork
,
which
have
approximately
450000
visitor
per
annum
.
will
there
be
a
change
in
policy
that
would
allow
such
site
to
be
market
along
with
either
the
wild
Atlantic
Way
or
Ireland
's
ancient
East
?
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
he
of
how
he
view
heritage
site
,
tourism
potential
and
job
creation
in
rural
area
.
there
be
site
that
be
a
little
off
the
beat
track
but
they
be
no
less
important
than
the
big
keynote
site
.
with
regard
to
CFRAM
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
mention
the
Cork
project
and
insurance
issue
.
the
Munster
Blackwater
,
and
specifically
the
flood
alleviation
work
that
be
carry
out
in
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
be
keynote
opw
project
that
have
deliver
significant
benefit
.
my
next
issue
be
demountable
wall
.
have
a
actuarial
analysis
be
do
to
assess
the
cost
of
insurance
in
case
in
which
demountable
wall
have
be
put
in
place
?
there
be
clear
evidence
that
the
presence
of
demountable
wall
alleviate
flooding
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
too
parochial
but
I
be
refer
to
the
Munster
Blackwater
,
where
the
OPW
do
a
stellar
job
in
two
specific
town
.
there
be
proof
that
demountable
wall
work
because
they
have
stop
town
from
be
flood
.
that
should
,
from
a
actuarial
point
of
view
,
have
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
drive
down
insurance
premium
.
we
need
to
be
more
vociferous
and
strong
when
send
a
message
to
the
insurance
company
about
such
issue
.
in
my
opinion
,
insurance
company
be
use
the
excuse
that
there
be
a
lack
of
evidence
to
support
demountable
work
or
that
there
be
some
actuarial
analysis
or
mitigating
risk
factor
associate
with
demountable
wall
.
perhaps
this
be
a
issue
that
the
Minister
of
State
could
take
up
.
can
I
have
a
specific
start
date
for
the
Bandon
and
Skibbereen
project
?
my
next
point
also
concern
cfram
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
OPW
map
trawl
well
beyond
certain
curtilage
,
especially
in
village
with
arterial
drain
,
minor
river
or
stream
.
even
if
one
be
to
assess
the
100
-
year
flood
risk
in
certain
place
,
the
analysis
would
drive
up
the
cost
of
insurance
for
the
people
who
live
there
.
have
CFRAM
look
at
town
and
village
that
have
tributary
?
have
CFRAM
adopt
a
belt
-
and
-
brace
approach
to
alleviate
flood
risk
in
such
place
?
the
area
for
further
assessment
identify
the
risk
.
how
do
CFRAM
measure
the
risk
?
do
it
use
the
usual
formula
of
the
100
-
year
flood
?
be
it
less
than
that
?
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
statement
.
notwithstanding
he
statement
that
there
will
be
no
policy
change
,
be
there
specific
issue
related
to
the
timeframe
in
which
to
deliver
project
?
what
do
he
wish
to
achieve
,
on
he
watch
as
Minister
of
State
responsible
for
the
opw
,
in
term
of
heritage
,
the
management
of
natural
resource
and
flood
alleviation
?
I
would
like
he
to
outline
,
in
he
own
word
,
he
vision
for
the
Department
.
have
function
be
clearly
delineat
and
delegate
to
he
in
term
of
the
management
of
he
budget
?
be
the
minister
of
State
chair
the
interdepartmental
group
?
yes
.
my
point
about
flood
mapping
be
that
if
one
take
CFRAM
and
a
small
village
with
a
stream
go
through
it
where
there
have
not
be
a
flood
within
living
memory
,
the
insurance
map
will
show
clearly
at
present
that
the
curtilage
of
the
stream
be
very
wide
and
the
area
be
deem
to
be
a
flood
plain
.
I
might
not
have
explain
myself
clearly
.
when
the
CFRAM
study
on
the
village
and
town
we
be
talk
about
see
the
light
of
day
there
must
be
a
realistic
mechanism
build
in
such
that
one
look
at
the
100
-
year
risk
.
if
a
village
have
not
flood
,
or
the
stream
have
not
burst
its
bank
,
in
living
memory
,
and
people
be
pay
a
extra
premium
for
they
insurance
because
the
mapping
be
such
that
the
curtilage
be
very
wide
either
side
of
the
bank
,
then
I
contend
that
the
OPW
or
the
Minister
of
State
must
look
at
the
issue
because
it
be
drive
up
the
cost
of
insurance
and
some
place
be
uninsurable
as
a
result
.
Barryscourt
Castle
in
Cork
be
another
prime
OPW
site
.
we
all
acknowledge
the
excellence
with
which
the
OPW
carry
out
its
work
in
term
of
care
,
maintenance
and
enhancement
,
because
it
have
spend
considerable
resource
recently
enhance
such
site
off
the
beat
track
.
Barryscourt
Castle
in
Carrigtwohill
be
on
a
main
thoroughfare
and
it
be
a
example
of
wonderful
work
conduct
by
the
OPW
but
it
have
be
close
for
some
time
and
it
be
still
close
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
can
not
respond
to
I
on
the
issue
today
perhaps
he
could
revert
to
I
.
it
be
be
rewire
.
do
we
know
when
it
be
open
?
I
appreciate
that
because
it
be
another
key
site
for
the
south
and
it
would
be
fantastic
if
it
could
be
open
this
summer
but
I
think
we
be
too
late
.
I
thank
Mr.
McMahon
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
comment
on
he
delegate
function
?
have
they
be
clearly
define
and
be
there
a
very
clear
budget
?
will
the
minister
of
State
have
absolute
autonomy
and
policy
control
over
he
budget
?
have
it
be
notify
to
the
dáil
at
this
stage
?
I
be
not
aware
that
it
have
be
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
not
be
facetious
.
there
be
a
further
point
.
in
term
of
learn
about
how
the
OPW
operate
as
a
organisation
,
it
might
be
helpful
as
well
to
distinguish
between
the
role
of
the
minister
of
State
and
the
commissioner
in
term
of
how
the
law
operate
regard
the
autonomy
of
the
commissioner
in
respect
of
make
decision
.
perhaps
that
should
be
deal
with
in
this
forum
,
even
today
,
to
give
we
a
insight
into
the
role
of
commissioner
because
it
arguably
differ
from
other
Department
because
commissioner
be
appoint
.
it
would
be
helpful
for
people
who
be
watch
this
committee
proceedings
to
get
a
two
or
three
-
minute
insight
into
the
role
of
the
commissioner
in
respect
of
how
the
policy
of
the
opw
play
out
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
and
the
Minister
of
State
to
the
committee
.
my
question
concern
the
vote
before
we
,
but
before
I
put
they
I
will
make
a
broad
point
about
the
need
for
this
committee
to
make
time
for
a
discussion
on
the
summer
economic
statement
and
the
recent
report
of
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
.
notwithstanding
the
time
constraint
we
face
today
,
I
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
a
broad
discussion
on
the
very
macroeconomic
issue
that
affect
we
all
,
particularly
how
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
fit
into
that
firmament
,
because
there
be
legitimate
question
relate
to
the
summer
economic
statement
concern
the
costing
for
2017
of
recent
announcement
such
as
the
revise
estimate
for
health
and
the
€200
million
local
investment
fund
for
local
authority
.
on
the
latter
,
we
need
a
opportunity
to
interrogate
the
modality
of
that
scheme
and
its
cost
in
term
of
public
expenditure
but
also
in
respect
of
-----
I
appreciate
that
.
other
issue
include
medium
-
term
objective
and
the
stability
programme
update
.
this
be
all
issue
that
this
committee
need
to
have
time
to
discuss
with
the
minister
,
so
I
appreciate
that
and
I
thank
the
minister
.
the
EU
referendum
in
great
Britain
be
on
the
horizon
.
in
respect
of
subhead
A6
and
A8
and
the
special
EU
Programmes
Body
,
SEUPB
,
which
be
within
the
Minister
's
Department
,
we
have
give
a
lot
of
resource
and
time
to
ensure
that
this
North
-
South
body
be
adequately
fund
and
that
the
peace
programme
be
fund
adequately
from
a
EU
perspective
.
have
the
minister
a
view
on
the
effect
on
that
programme
if
the
UK
exit
the
EU
?
Subhead
A8
concern
the
Ireland
Wales
territorial
Co-operation
Programme
.
I
be
very
worried
that
if
the
UK
exit
the
EU
it
will
have
a
profound
effect
on
programme
operate
on
a
North
-
South
basis
from
both
a
social
and
a
economic
point
of
view
.
I
would
welcome
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
.
in
respect
of
procurement
,
I
note
that
reference
be
make
to
savings
of
€
80
million
to
€
100
million
and
previous
savings
.
I
have
a
worry
about
Irish
sme
.
I
note
that
there
have
be
a
lot
of
work
do
with
regard
to
the
local
enterprise
office
and
"
meet
the
buyer
"
event
and
so
on
,
and
savings
have
be
make
.
have
the
Department
calculate
whether
more
Irish
sme
have
take
up
this
opportunity
and
whether
pre-exist
Irish
company
and
sme
have
be
crowd
out
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
lack
the
economy
of
scale
require
to
compete
for
business
?
I
make
specific
reference
to
the
education
sector
,
where
there
be
anecdotal
evidence
that
company
that
supply
art
and
craft
supplies
,
book
and
other
product
in
the
education
sphere
feel
they
will
not
be
able
to
retain
the
market
share
they
have
and
be
be
crowd
out
by
the
new
regime
for
procure
savings
.
I
do
not
necessarily
need
a
answer
to
that
today
.
I
be
just
put
down
a
marker
,
and
we
might
have
a
further
discussion
on
it
because
there
be
company
that
be
feel
a
bit
of
pressure
in
that
space
.
be
PeoplePoint
operate
at
full
capacity
?
have
the
individual
line
Department
's
hr
and
payment
function
migrate
to
PeoplePoint
in
a
seamless
fashion
?
we
all
acknowledge
that
there
will
be
a
lag
on
that
and
that
there
will
be
issue
that
must
be
deal
with
,
but
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
perspective
on
whether
PeoplePoint
be
up
and
run
and
whether
it
be
respond
to
individual
worker
's
query
in
a
timely
fashion
.
in
respect
of
vote
19
,
provision
be
make
for
issue
such
as
prisoner
complaint
,
clinical
judgment
and
direct
provision
to
be
deal
with
by
the
Office
of
the
Ombudsman
.
I
understand
it
have
a
budget
of
€
9.7
million
.
will
the
Office
of
the
Ombudsman
have
a
expand
role
?
be
the
cost
of
this
be
meet
in
respect
of
the
potential
need
for
increase
personnel
to
deal
with
a
expand
service
?
I
have
a
bugbear
concern
we
own
service
here
.
we
own
it
infrastructure
have
not
migrate
to
the
cloud
.
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
be
do
a
very
good
job
of
ensure
that
build
-
to
-
share
and
cloud
service
platform
be
build
through
the
Office
of
the
government
Chief
information
officer
.
I
note
the
statement
relate
to
datum
mining
and
so
on
.
be
this
be
a
matter
for
further
discussion
somewhere
down
the
line
?
we
could
discuss
how
the
Oireachtas
operate
in
respect
of
we
own
ICT
infrastructure
and
make
loose
system
available
,
because
the
system
we
be
operate
at
the
moment
be
a
bit
anachronistic
and
arcane
and
might
need
to
be
look
at
.
that
be
a
very
minor
issue
,
but
I
say
I
would
take
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
with
the
minister
while
he
be
here
.
I
welcome
the
comment
on
the
opening
up
of
a
dialogue
with
the
public
sector
union
on
the
commission
.
the
minister
make
a
very
clear
statement
about
how
any
sudden
elimination
of
the
FEMPI
measure
be
not
feasible
.
I
be
hope
for
more
time
today
to
discuss
the
summer
economic
statement
,
the
fiscal
space
and
the
new
money
that
appear
to
have
be
make
available
,
because
I
wonder
whether
there
be
scope
to
accelerate
the
unwinding
of
FEMPI
,
give
the
increase
resource
that
would
appear
to
be
available
as
a
outcome
of
the
summer
economic
statement
.
do
that
include
Department
?
have
all
Department
migrate
to
this
?
I
be
not
like
what
I
be
hear
.
I
be
not
criticise
anybody
work
within
we
it
system
here
.
the
system
be
what
it
be
.
if
government
be
talk
about
open
datum
,
open
government
and
the
system
we
operate
as
a
parliament
,
compare
with
other
such
as
the
Estonian
parliament
,
which
have
move
lock
,
stock
and
barrel
into
the
cloud
,
then
-
while
I
note
there
may
be
security
issue
,
with
firewalling
and
whatnot
-
we
need
to
bring
we
system
kick
and
scream
into
this
century
,
because
I
contend
that
it
use
last
-
century
technology
.
if
the
minister
can
have
a
open
mind
about
that
and
,
in
he
responsibility
for
public
expenditure
and
reform
,
ensure
that
we
make
we
system
fit
for
purpose
,
that
will
send
a
signal
.
be
there
a
clear
set
of
metric
?
which
one
be
leave

I
,
too
,
welcome
the
minister
.
my
question
also
relate
to
Brexit
.
from
he
wisdom
and
experience
,
what
do
the
minister
see
as
the
potential
impact
of
Brexit
on
foreign
direct
investment
in
this
country
?
the
programme
for
government
have
clear
target
for
job
creation
over
the
lifetime
of
the
government
's
mandate
.
if
the
UK
tax
position
become
more
competitive
,
particularly
regard
financial
service
and
the
lower
of
vat
rate
or
even
corporation
tax
rate
,
do
the
minister
have
a
sense
of
the
potential
impact
that
will
have
on
job
creation
in
this
country
,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
?
while
there
might
be
a
early
boost
of
foreign
direct
investment
into
Ireland
,
the
UK
still
remain
the
large
attractor
of
foreign
direct
investment
in
Europe
.
in
the
context
of
the
financial
service
sector
,
there
be
a
concern
that
Ireland
may
not
be
sufficiently
diversify
in
access
to
market
and
export
of
financial
service
.
be
there
a
over
-
reliance
on
export
of
financial
service
to
the
UK
?
have
there
be
a
significant
diversification
of
export
to
the
Asian
and
North
American
market
?
the
minister
state
that
there
be
still
85998
mortgage
account
in
arrears
.
while
this
represent
a
18
%
decline
,
there
be
a
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
to
examine
further
measure
to
support
borrower
.
have
any
of
that
measure
be
advance
at
this
juncture
?
my
question
be
in
respect
of
financial
service
and
the
IFSC
.
let
we
suppose
the
UK
depart
from
EU
taxation
legislation
or
case
law
in
respect
of
vat
.
be
the
financial
service
sector
in
this
country
sufficiently
diversify
such
that
there
be
no
over
-
reliance
on
the
UK
market
?
I
have
in
mind
export
of
financial
goods
and
service
,
the
financial
technology
industry
and
everything
that
sail
in
that
ship
.
this
include
export
of
service
from
Ireland
to
the
UK
.
have
we
diversify
sufficiently
into
Asian
market
,
EU
market
and
North
American
market
?
that
be
really
the
question
.
be
there
contingency
planning
in
place
?
I
be
ask
the
question
insofar
as
it
be
possible
because
we
be
in
a
state
of
flux
politically
and
economically
and
it
be
impossible
to
predict
what
be
go
to
happen
in
term
of
the
effect
on
the
Irish
economy
,
the
UK
economy
and
the
European
economy
no
matter
how
much
contingency
planning
we
put
in
place
.
all
we
can
do
be
go
by
the
ESRI
and
the
Department
of
Finance
predictor
in
so
far
as
that
be
possible
.
can
I
get
a
sense
from
the
Department
of
Finance
or
the
government
of
whether
there
be
contingency
planning
under
way
?
be
the
department
seek
to
ensure
that
the
gain
make
by
the
financial
service
sector
will
not
be
lose
and
that
we
will
continue
to
grow
?
that
be
a
important
message
and
signal
.
I
welcome
the
Taoiseach
to
the
committee
.
I
will
start
with
the
vote
.
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
everybody
involve
in
the
1916
commemoration
.
I
know
this
be
a
cross-party
initiative
lead
by
the
Taoiseach
's
Department
.
we
must
acknowledge
the
inclusivity
of
the
programme
and
the
fact
that
the
occasion
be
participate
in
by
community
right
across
the
country
.
it
be
a
programme
of
which
everybody
can
be
very
proud
.
when
will
the
citizen
's
assembly
be
establish
?
there
be
provision
for
it
in
the
estimate
,
but
will
it
still
meet
the
October
timeline
?
the
cabinet
committee
on
rural
and
regional
affair
deal
with
rural
development
,
broadband
and
flooding
.
I
know
it
have
a
particular
eye
on
the
catchment
flood
risk
assessment
and
management
programme
,
CFRAM
.
I
hope
to
get
a
signal
from
the
Taoiseach
that
this
be
not
just
a
talking
shop
and
that
the
cabinet
committee
have
a
budget
line
with
real
action
around
it
.
will
the
Taoiseach
provide
a
insight
on
that
?
will
I
start
with
that
opening
gambit
and
come
back
with
a
few
more
?
I
will
make
a
political
point
about
the
citizen
's
assembly
.
we
be
in
a
citizen
's
assembly
.
notwithstanding
the
government
's
decision
,
we
have
receive
a
mandate
from
the
people
regard
governance
and
decision
,
so
we
be
well
equip
by
virtue
of
that
mandate
-
and
its
diversity
-
to
deal
with
the
issue
.
I
be
worried
about
the
number
of
Irish
personnel
serve
in
EU
and
international
institution
.
I
know
there
be
a
specific
job
to
be
do
and
the
Department
be
work
on
that
.
when
the
United
Kingdom
exit
the
European
Union
,
the
number
of
staff
with
English
as
a
first
language
will
decrease
significantly
,
so
there
be
scope
for
Irish
people
to
take
up
the
slack
.
I
hope
we
will
be
strategic
in
that
respect
.
be
all
the
case
file
in
the
Chief
State
Solicitor
's
Office
be
manage
and
be
it
be
do
in
a
timely
fashion
?
be
there
much
of
a
backlog
in
the
office
and
be
enough
resource
be
allocate
there
?
I
be
very
conscious
of
the
time
but
I
will
speak
about
Brexit
.
I
do
not
know
why
Mr.
Tusk
refuse
to
meet
the
Scottish
first
Minister
.
I
recognise
some
concern
be
raise
by
the
Spanish
Prime
Minister
,
who
be
a
member
of
the
European
People
's
Party
,
of
which
the
Taoiseach
's
party
be
also
a
member
.
there
may
have
be
some
issue
relate
to
how
Scotland
be
not
recognise
as
a
state
but
rather
as
a
region
.
one
can
consider
the
political
issue
of
Brexit
and
that
Northern
Ireland
vote
overwhelmingly
to
stay
within
the
European
Union
,
as
do
Scotland
.
the
question
do
not
arise
for
Ireland
.
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Northern
Ireland
be
a
avowed
Brexiteer
and
the
first
Minister
of
Northern
Ireland
have
a
very
explicit
position
on
the
UK
's
membership
of
the
European
Union
.
that
present
a
serious
challenge
for
we
,
particularly
in
ensure
there
be
a
negotiate
position
that
do
not
leave
we
weaken
economically
as
a
result
of
the
decision
by
the
Unite
Kingdom
to
leave
the
European
Union
.
I
wish
the
Taoiseach
well
in
the
come
month
with
the
economic
diplomacy
that
will
have
to
be
go
through
,
as
well
as
the
political
diplomacy
.
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
have
never
be
as
good
as
they
be
now
,
arguably
,
and
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
from
the
Taoiseach
now
or
in
future
as
to
how
we
will
address
the
political
conundrum
of
ensure
that
once
there
be
a
new
British
Prime
Minister
we
can
up
the
ante
in
that
diplomatic
onslaught
.
at
this
stage
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
we
ambassador
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
Mr.
Dan
Mulhall
,
as
well
as
the
role
of
the
consulate
in
Edinburgh
in
ensure
we
do
everything
we
could
to
encourage
Irish
people
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
to
vote
on
the
referendum
.
in
future
there
should
be
a
mechanism
to
ensure
the
term
of
trade
be
enhance
and
we
do
not
become
disadvantage
due
to
the
potential
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
to
lower
its
corporation
tax
and
vat
rate
,
for
example
,
make
we
even
less
competitive
for
inward
investment
.
it
be
a
political
point
but
I
want
to
put
it
on
record
.
if
I
could
get
a
note
on
that
,
I
would
be
happy
.
I
thank
the
Taoiseach
.
we
have
to
ensure
for
the
future
that
this
arrangement
be
in
place
.
we
have

we
have
to
ensure
for
the
future
that
this
arrangement
be
in
place
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
divide
my
question
between
estate
management
and
flooding
.
I
will
start
with
estate
management
.
I
also
join
with
the
chairman
in
welcoming
the
new
chairman
of
the
OPW
.
I
too
work
in
a
previous
guise
with
he
through
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
I
be
delighted
to
see
he
appoint
to
this
role
.
it
may
not
be
possible
for
the
minister
of
State
to
answer
my
question
directly
at
this
session
.
if
he
cannot
,
I
would
be
grateful
if
somebody
would
revert
to
I
.
I
want
to
raise
site
like
Barryscourt
Castle
,
County
Cork
,
Annes
Grove
Garden
in
Castletownroche
,
County
Cork
,
and
Doneraile
Court
.
they
be
three
key
reference
site
that
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
OPW
's
sphere
of
responsibility
.
I
know
that
work
be
ongoing
in
Barryscourt
Castle
,
for
instance
.
the
people
who
use
this
facility
be
anxious
to
ensure
there
be
continue
maintenance
and
development
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
remark
with
regard
to
Ireland
's
ancient
East
and
the
reference
to
develop
the
heritage
element
of
the
OPW
offering
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
revert
to
I
with
regard
to
what
the
plan
be
for
that
three
particular
site
.
the
Annes
Grove
Garden
site
,
in
particular
,
be
a
recent
acquisition
and
a
very
valuable
one
in
term
of
its
history
and
place
in
north
Cork
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
ensure
that
the
resource
be
deploy
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
its
future
development
.
I
note
that
there
have
be
a
12.8
%
increase
in
revenue
stream
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
delve
further
into
how
that
12.8
%
be
arrive
at
in
term
of
attendance
figure
across
the
site
throughout
the
country
.
it
be
a
cumulative
increase
.
person
like
I
,
who
represent
the
people
of
north
and
east
Cork
,
would
like
to
see
how
that
translate
to
site
like
Doneraile
Court
,
Annes
Grove
Garden
and
Barryscourt
Castle
,
which
be
obviously
close
at
the
moment
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
we
could
get
some
solid
information
from
the
Minister
of
State
on
the
figure
as
they
relate
to
that
three
reference
site
.
my
next
question
be
about
the
child
's
science
centre
.
what
be
the
actual
state
of
progress
on
that
?
that
be
the
first
half
of
my
intervention
.
the
second
half
of
my
intervention
relate
to
Cork
in
particular
and
the
propose
flood
work
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
say
that
the
deadline
for
submission
have
move
out
to
a
date
in
March
.
there
have
be
some
concern
raise
,
of
which
the
minister
will
be
aware
,
regard
the
aesthetics
that
this
project
will
bring
and
how
that
will
impact
on
the
visual
amenity
that
people
enjoy
on
the
River
Lee
.
historically
,
on
scheme
like
the
Munster
Blackwater
in
Fermoy
as
well
as
in
Mallow
,
similar
concern
be
raise
by
people
live
within
that
region
.
I
can
understand
the
concern
of
the
people
of
Cork
city
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
be
mindful
of
that
concern
.
I
understand
a
process
be
under
way
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
keep
in
mind
the
aesthetic
value
of
the
River
Lee
and
to
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
ensure
the
visual
amenity
that
be
there
.
there
be
other
concern
that
will
come
into
the
public
forum
as
time
go
on
.
the
Minister
of
State
mention
small
scheme
.
there
be
still
a
situation
arise
from
Storm
Frank
in
2015
where
work
be
ongoing
on
the
N25
,
east
of
Castlemartyr
.
I
travel
on
that
road
the
other
day
and
work
have
be
carry
out
opposite
a
particular
property
.
I
do
not
want
to
name
the
person
in
question
but
he
and
he
family
have
be
very
much
affect
by
Storm
Frank
.
there
be
turlough
present
in
the
area
.
there
have
be
no
communication
between
the
opw
and
this
person
.
to
be
fair
to
the
person
in
question
,
aesthetically
,
opposite
he
house
look
a
bit
like
a
bomb
site
at
the
moment
.
I
do
not
want
to
inflame
the
situation
in
any
way
.
however
,
if
the
opw
or
its
agent
could
communicate
more
with
the
people
affect
in
that
particular
region
,
I
believe
it
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
also
want
to
ask
about
the
voluntary
home
relocation
scheme
.
I
would
like
to
know
what
criterion
apply
.
do
they
include
a
person
move
to
a
elevate
site
on
they
own
property
and
building
from
scratch
?
be
that
one
of
the
area
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
examine
?
I
would
like
to
hear
more
about
the
modality
of
the
scheme
,
maybe
not
today
,
but
perhaps
at
some
future
session
.
in
fairness
to
the
Minister
of
State
with
regard
to
he
engagement
on
the
insurance
issue
,
he
have
be
quite
proactive
to
my
mind
.
I
have
a
meeting
with
the
Minister
of
State
prior
to
the
Christmas
recess
.
we
be
perhaps
still
sceptical
about
whether
Insurance
Ireland
will
actually
take
on
board
the
CFRAM
process
and
,
have
do
that
,
whether
it
will
reflect
in
low
cost
in
the
premium
of
people
live
in
area
affect
by
CFRAM
.
that
remain
to
be
see
and
I
would
like
to
hear
the
view
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
many
people
have
carry
out
work
in
small
area
,
such
as
Castlemartyr
in
County
Cork
,
which
be
badly
affect
,
and
place
like
Midleton
.
some
of
that
people
have
insurance
,
but
other
do
not
and
have
to
pay
out
quite
a
amount
of
money
to
repair
damage
property
.
they
be
look
for
a
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
Insurance
Ireland
will
realistically
engage
and
whether
a
real
protocol
will
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
that
,
once
the
OPW
have
future
-
proof
a
particular
area
that
be
within
a
certain
flood
plain
,
the
cost
of
insurance
will
be
reduce
for
people
in
the
future
.
I
acknowledge
it
be
a
ongoing
process
and
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
engagement
on
it
.
that
be
my
open
remark
.
Doneraile
Court
.
it
be
a
hardy
perennial
in
my
book
.
I
want
to
know
what
be
the
number
as
it
be
a
site
that
I
want
to
see
develop
.
the
minister
be
consider
the
idea
that
somebody
could
build
on
they
own
land
,
subject
to
planning
,
if
it
be
at
a
high
level
.
what
be
the
position
on
Insurance
Ireland
?
I
have
a
final
question
on
flood
insurance
and
the
Minister
of
State
's
engagement
with
Insurance
Ireland
.
the
demountable
wall
meet
good
international
practice
.
the
Munster
Blackwater
scheme
,
at
Fermoy
in
particular
,
be
carry
out
by
a
internationally
recognise
consulting
engineering
firm
,
one
of
the
good
in
the
business
globally
.
I
cannot
tally
why
that
would
not
be
accept
by
Insurance
Ireland
or
any
insurance
provider
,
if
it
be
good
international
practice
and
this
insurance
house
be
international
insurance
house
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
company
be
refuse
point
blank
to
insure
.
that
seem
to
be
close
to
the
truth
.
the
ultimate
question
for
people
who
live
in
area
where
work
have
be
carry
out
and
demountable
wall
be
in
place
be
whether
there
be
a
power
to
compel
the
company
to
provide
insurance
.
I
would
like
to
move
the
conversation
onto
macroeconomic
policy
,
specifically
the
stability
and
growth
pact
.
we
be
look
at
the
eurozone
growth
figure
for
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
and
they
be
be
revise
downwards
to
something
like
0.4
%
from
0.5
%
.
I
understand
that
letter
have
be
issue
to
something
like
seven
country
,
although
not
to
Ireland
thankfully
.
increasingly
what
we
be
see
in
respect
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
be
that
there
be
a
lot
of
focus
on
the
stability
but
very
little
on
the
growth
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
perspective
from
the
minister
as
to
where
Ireland
stand
on
,
for
instance
,
recent
comment
by
the
German
finance
minister
that
there
may
need
to
be
a
review
of
the
stability
and
Growth
pact
and
where
the
politics
of
that
rest
at
present
within
the
EU
.
if
we
be
look
at
growth
in
we
own
economy
and
capital
spending
,
obviously
there
be
go
to
be
a
turf
war
on
the
capital
spend
.
the
minister
and
I
both
inhabit
the
great
province
of
Munster
.
we
would
be
look
at
regional
economic
development
between
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
and
that
Atlantic
corridor
.
person
represent
the
eastern
side
of
the
country
would
be
look
at
metro
north
,
the
M50
and
other
such
project
.
if
we
be
to
be
realistic
about
proper
investment
in
project
of
this
nature
,
there
need
to
be
some
degree
of
flexibility
build
in
to
,
or
a
revision
of
,
the
stability
and
growth
pact
because
I
think
it
be
actually
imped
the
potential
for
growth
.
there
can
not
be
growth
without
proper
regional
infrastructure
.
I
would
welcome
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
and
on
whether
that
conversation
be
be
have
by
ECOFIN
minister
.
it
be
modest
growth
.
be
the
minister
speak
about
specific
project
?
do
that
include
project
in
Galway
such
as
the
Atlantic
corridor
connectivity
?

I
thank
the
Minster
and
he
official
for
attend
today
's
meeting
.
we
be
currently
go
through
a
process
to
establish
various
commission
of
inquiry
and
tribunal
.
take
the
last
two
or
three
year
,
to
date
,
how
much
have
we
spend
on
tribunal
of
inquiry
,
commission
of
investigation
and
Oireachtas
inquiry
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
.
the
sum
of
€420
million
be
a
extraordinary
figure
over
such
a
relatively
short
period
.
I
agree
with
the
minister
that
every
party
need
to
have
natural
justice
and
the
truth
need
to
be
seek
.
however
,
I
wonder
whether
such
a
cost
should
be
borne
,
ultimately
by
the
taxpayer
,
in
seek
truth
and
justice
,
regardless
of
the
subject
matter
.
I
think
we
all
agree
that
this
be
important
issue
that
should
be
the
subject
of
tribunal
of
inquiry
and
commission
of
investigation
.
however
,
do
deputy
Donohoe
,
in
he
role
as
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
believe
there
be
now
a
case
to
be
make
for
this
cost
to
be
consider
?
I
imagine
the
vast
bulk
of
they
be
legal
cost
which
accrue
to
legal
practice
.
have
the
minister
give
any
thought
to
the
idea
that
we
need
to
find
some
mechanism
whereby
truth
and
justice
be
seek
and
report
on
in
a
way
that
do
not
put
such
a
burden
on
the
taxpayer
?
I
take
the
point
the
minister
may
make
about
the
relatively
recent
referendum
and
so
on
but
I
do
not
believe
that
the
Irish
taxpayer
want
to
continue
to
bear
this
cost
,
particularly
if
they
be
,
in
the
main
,
legal
cost
.
there
may
now
be
some
need
for
reform
of
this
process
because
it
be
arguable
that
it
be
unsustainable
.
I
take
the
point
the
minister
make
.
ultimately
,
it
be
the
minister
's
Department
that
will
sign
the
cheque
,
or
through
which
the
cheque
will
come
,
regard
the
fee
structure
and
the
entirety
of
the
cost
.
le
there
be
any
ambiguity
about
my
position
on
this
,
let
I
state
that
the
right
to
have
one
's
rights
vindicate
and
be
represent
legally
be
absolutely
sacrosanct
,
and
I
think
we
would
all
agree
with
that
.
however
,
be
there
a
process
by
which
cost
can
be
cap
while
recognise
the
rights
of
all
party
before
a
commission
of
investigation
or
a
tribunal
of
inquiry
?
go
back
to
the
2008
report
,
it
seem
that
if
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
be
acknowledge
the
spiral
cost
-
at
the
risk
of
put
word
into
he
mouth
-
then
that
cost
be
out
of
control
.
they
be
astronomical
and
ridiculous
as
regards
the
pursuit
of
justice
or
truth
,
depend
on
the
content
of
the
inquiry
.
the
Irish
taxpayer
have
the
right
to
ensure
that
the
most
cost
-
effective
mechanism
be
use
,
even
if
this
mean
legislate
for
a
upper
cap
on
cost
per
hour
or
whatever
formula
be
use
to
determine
cost
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
it
be
not
possible
for
the
Irish
taxpayer
to
sustain
over
ten
year
a
cost
of
€
420.593
million
.
there
need
to
be
a
policy
shift
somewhere
.
I
be
not
try
to
be
partisan
in
my
approach
here
,
and
I
do
take
the
point
-----
-----
about
the
cost
of
tribunal
.
the
mechanism
be
one
thing
.
whether
it
be
a
tribunal
of
inquiry
or
a
commission
of
investigation
,
the
appropriate
mechanism
be
find
.
there
be
still
the
issue
of
the
cost
.
I
will
close
the
matter
off
now
because
I
take
the
point
the
minister
be
make
.
move
on
,
I
think
we
all
support
the
work
of
the
Public
Service
pay
Commission
.
we
support
the
minister
's
endeavour
in
this
regard
because
I
think
we
want
to
ensure
there
be
a
formula
that
allow
for
a
transition
that
be
as
seamless
as
possible
after
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
sunset
.
how
do
the
minister
envisage
the
outworking
of
the
Public
Service
pay
Commission
and
how
it
will
transition
into
the
potential
for
a
further
negotiation
downstream
on
public
sector
pay
?
I
ask
for
he
personal
perspective
on
this
.
the
emergency
framework
be
still
in
place
but
be
the
issue
of
that
who
be
above
the
current
threshold
in
respect
of
pension
restoration
work
its
way
into
discussion
?
be
the
minister
satisfied
that
the
Regulation
of
Lobbying
Act
2015
be
work
?
the
move
towards
transparency
have
be
welcome
by
everybody
and
I
hope
vested
interest
will
not
seek
to
undo
that
or
try
to
restrict
the
legislation
in
any
way
in
the
review
.
it
be
important
that
everybody
have
sight
of
who
be
register
as
a
lobbyist
,
for
obvious
reason
.
have
the
minister
have
regard
to
the
post
-
programme
surveillance
report
?
have
the
minister
a
perspective
on
that
in
respect
of
the
need
to
ensure
ongoing
capital
investment
for
infrastructural
purpose
from
a
stability
and
growth
perspective
?
the
report
be
anaemic
.
it
be
a
little
like
the
teacher
use
the
red
pen
to
mark
the
copybook
.
that
do
not
necessarily
educate
or
offer
solution
to
the
student
as
to
where
he
or
she
have
go
wrong
or
outline
whether
the
teacher
's
own
practice
could
be
good
.
the
report
seem
to
be
very
much
a
desktop
exercise
.
I
do
not
criticise
the
originator
of
the
report
but
the
limit
factor
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
in
term
of
we
ability
to
invest
more
in
capital
expenditure
for
infrastructural
purpose
to
boost
the
domestic
economy
be
a
bugbear
of
mine
.
how
be
the
politics
of
that
be
play
out
at
European
Council
level
?
we
be
face
uncertain
time
and
there
be
turbulence
ahead
.
it
be
not
enough
for
the
author
to
describe
the
scenario
here
;
there
must
be
more
about
where
the
European
Commission
or
the
Council
intervene
to
assist
we
to
meet
the
stability
and
Growth
pact
and
other
target
in
order
that
we
can
meet
the
challenge
of
the
so
-
call
"
cloud
on
the
horizon
"
,
to
use
they
phrase
.
the
pact
be
too
restrictive
.
it
do
not
allow
the
government
to
operate
within
a
wide
envelope
to
boost
the
European
economy
further
and
to
boost
the
domestic
economy
,
in
particular
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
?
this
be
the
point
,
be
it
not
?
whether
it
be
articulate
through
some
flexibility
in
term
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
or
European
Council
agreement
on
the
point
just
make
by
the
minister
,
there
must
be
some
political
formula
that
allow
that
to
happen
.
it
be
arguable
that
we
be
overly
constrain
by
the
rule
that
exist
at
the
moment
.
there
must
be
,
at
a
EU
level
,
some
mechanism
to
allow
Ireland
,
from
a
macro-
economic
point
of
view
,
to
invest
without
fall
foul
of
the
very
strict
rule
that
exist
at
present
.
the
liability
can
be
finance
out
over
a
relatively
long
period
of
time
.
if
one
be
talk
about
road
or
transport
,
for
instance
,
there
be
way
of
factor
that
in
.
financing
over
a
long
period
of
time
allow
one
to
meet
the
repayment
cost
in
a
relatively
easy
fashion
.
we
need
to
move
away
from
the
current
situation
where
,
for
example
,
I
would
make
a
pitch
for
the
Atlantic
corridor
and
connectivity
between
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
and
on
up
the
western
seaboard
.
often
it
be
a
case
of
whoever
shout
the
loud
,
from
a
political
point
of
view
,
get
the
spoil
in
term
of
capital
investment
.
we
must
find
some
other
model
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
there
be
a
suggestion
that
ppp
and
engagement
with
the
EIB
on
project
of
the
type
to
which
I
have
just
refer
could
be
viable
as
option
in
term
of
build
out
funding
for
transport
-
related
capital
infrastructure
.
Mallow
and
Charleville
but
there
be
a
constituency
boundary
-----
there
be
a
irony
in
the
fact
that
I
be
talk
about
ppp
and
the
minister
be
talk
about
State
investment
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
response
.
I
will
direct
my
last
question
,
which
be
on
the
post
-
programme
surveillance
report
,
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
.
that
report
make
reference
to
the
potential
for
volatility
in
global
financial
market
to
spill
over
into
the
Irish
financial
sector
.
perhaps
the
Minister
of
State
have
not
study
the
report
yet
in
detail
but
I
would
welcome
he
view
on
it
.
there
be
a
suggestion
that
Brexit
-
related
volatility
could
spill
over
into
the
Irish
financial
sector
and
could
have
a
downstream
effect
on
job
.
that
seem
like
a
strange
thing
to
say
,
give
that
there
be
apparently
a
lot
of
interest
in
the
Irish
financial
service
sector
at
the
moment
from
party
across
the
pond
.
do
the
minister
of
State
have
a
view
on
that
?
quality
of
life
.
this
be
all
important
factor
.
I
be
sorry
to
cut
across
the
Minister
of
State
,
but
Dublin
will
not
be
able
to
meet
its
housing
need
any
time
soon
,
so
Cork
be
well
place
.
will
the
minister
deconstruct
the
jargon
for
that
who
be
outside
of
this
wall
?
the
minister
mention
Mallow
,
Buttevant
and
Limerick
.
as
he
colleague
have
a
fondness
for
Cork
,
we
can
join
the
dot
.
there
be
competition
within
Cork
also
.

I
have
two
list
of
amendment
,
one
date
5
April
and
the
other
date
31
March
.
to
ensure
that
I
be
sing
off
the
same
hymn
sheet
as
everyone
else
,
be
the
5
April
list
the
update
one
?
I
thank
the
chairman
.
I
be
sorry
for
intervene
at
this
stage
but
there
be
more
than
80
amendment
and
I
be
conscious
of
the
time
.
my
understanding
of
the
Chairman
's
early
intervention
be
that
section
26
and
27
may
be
pertinent
with
regard
to
member
of
the
Oireachtas
.
rather
than
explain
all
of
the
section
at
this
stage
,
could
we
move
to
deal
with
the
amendment
,
extrapolate
they
meaning
and
dispense
with
they
as
we
go
along
?
obviously
,
I
will
be
guide
by
the
chairman
.
the
standard
commissioner
,
as
I
understand
it
,
will
be
able
to
appoint
-
a
board
will
be
appoint
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
may
I
seek
a
clarification
on
that
?
it
would
be
necessary
in
my
view
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
representative
on
that
board
who
be
either
a
former
Oireachtas
Member
or
former
councillor
,
somebody
within
that
new
arrangement
who
would
speak
to
the
dynamic
that
exist
for
public
representative
.
if
I
understand
section
2
correctly
,
the
change
be
mainly
semantic
,
or
technical
amendment
in
the
main
.
however
,
section
7
pose
question
in
relation
to
-----
okay
,
but
I
be
try
to
assist
the
chairman
,
because
the
substantive
issue
contain
within
the
Bill
in
regard
to
declarable
interest
be
in
section
7
.
if
a
further
process
be
necessary
to
examine
the
content
of
section
7
,
one
must
be
mindful
of
what
the
Chairman
say
if
section
7
be
pass
today
.
to
be
frank
about
it
,
I
be
quite
happy
with
the
amendment
to
section
7
.
however
,
that
still
do
not
deal
with
the
question
that
have
be
pose
by
deputy
Dara
Calleary
and
the
chairman
on
section
7
.
I
be
happy
to
agree
to
the
amendment
to
section
7
,
but
if
there
be
content
issue
in
section
7
,
the
question
be
,
do
we
pass
section
7
?
if
section
7
be
pass
,
can
one
still
submit
amendment
on
report
stage
?
I
have
a
question
about
chief
executive
of
local
authority
.
I
be
glad
to
see
they
be
include
in
this
Bill
.
will
chief
executive
of
local
authority
have
to
make
a
declaration
for
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
?
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
do
not
know
if
my
question
be
ridiculous
,
but
I
will
pose
it
anyway
.
I
be
think
of
the
county
councillor
,
for
example
,
who
may
be
a
solicitor
,
a
commissioner
for
oath
or
a
auctioneer
.
where
a
local
development
plan
be
be
make
,
and
if
that
person
have
a
declarable
interest
in
sell
or
ownership
of
that
land
,
be
there
anything
in
this
new
section
that
strengthen
the
declaration
or
the
necessity
to
declare
a
interest
?
be
it
as
be
?
I
be
try
to
understand
the
ad
hoc
declaration
which
the
minister
have
describe
.
I
be
not
fully
au
fait
with
it
yet
.
I
think
it
be
pertinent
to
section
7
.
if
it
be
not
,
the
minister
can
inform
I
.
if
I
be
a
teacher
and
also
a
county
councillor
,
for
example
.
if
I
be
a
teacher
and
a
county
councillor
,
would
I
have
to
declare
my
teaching
salary
?
it
be
arguable
that
the
wording
be
unclear
.
the
Bill
state
:
"
each
of
the
interest
specify
in
this
section
be
a
declarable
interest
for
the
purpose
of
this
act
,
and
the
follow
form
of
interest
be
deal
with
by
the
follow
subsection
-----"
.
I
seek
guidance
on
this
issue
.
do
any
part
of
the
Bill
explicitly
say
that
one
have
to
declare
the
source
of
the
income
as
oppose
to
"
the
income
"
?
I
seek
clarification
on
periodic
and
ad
hoc
disclosure
.
under
section
7
and
its
attendant
subsection
,
the
ad
hoc
disclosure
apply
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
ad
hoc
disclosure
be
make
if
and
when
a
conflict
of
interest
arise
.
it
be
generally
more
effective
than
periodic
disclosure
in
identify
interest
likely
to
give
rise
to
a
conflict
as
the
nature
of
the
private
interest
to
be
disclose
can
be
define
in
more
general
term
.
consequently
,
it
be
also
good
at
bring
such
interest
into
the
public
arena
.
there
be
a
obligation
on
any
person
or
entity
subject
to
section
7
to
make
the
declaration
.
where
be
the
composite
investigative
function
?
be
there
a
composite
or
oppose
investigative
function
on
the
part
of
the
Standard
in
Public
Office
Commission
?
how
do
this
change
the
exist
legislation
?
will
the
minister
explain
that
in
simple
term
?
there
may
be
time
when
a
person
need
to
discreetly
deal
with
the
Revenue
commissioner
to
put
he
or
she
house
in
order
and
to
ensure
that
he
or
she
be
tax
compliant
,
so
that
he
or
she
can
then
furnish
a
tax
clearance
certificate
.
I
would
have
a
problem
with
sipo
or
the
commissioner
go
direct
to
Revenue
because
a
person
may
not
be
compliant
at
a
give
time
,
but
not
for
nefarious
reason
.
what
be
the
norm
?
be
there
a
rationale
for
the
time
to
be
18
month
?
how
would
psychological
or
psychiatric
service
apply
here
?
I
would
say
that
the
rights
of
the
person
be
paramount
in
this
area
and
I
welcome
the
minister
's
statement
that
he
will
look
at
this
again
.
I
be
glad
this
provision
be
in
place
and
that
it
be
unambiguous
.
the
exist
culture
in
respect
of
the
Standard
in
Public
Office
Commission
be
such
that
one
can
go
and
speak
to
people
in
that
office
and
get
guidance
.
to
see
it
clearly
write
into
legislation
be
to
be
welcome
.
to
support
that
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
might
make
the
requisite
resource
available
to
meet
the
potential
increase
for
such
query
in
term
of
staffing
requirement
.
the
value
in
question
be
€600
.
most
of
we
would
have
a
fair
sense
of
the
value
of
a
gift
and
I
be
sure
that
a
couple
of
phone
call
would
let
a
person
know
what
the
value
of
the
gift
be
,
depend
on
its
nature
.
when
I
serve
as
a
minister
of
State
,
a
lot
of
the
gift
I
receive
and
graciously
accept
would
have
end
up
on
the
mantlepiece
of
the
relevant
Department
and
be
probably
still
there
gather
dust
.
in
practice
,
they
value
be
more
nominal
than
monetary
in
nature
.
three
week
make
sense
.
that
be
plenty
of
time
to
assess
it
.
the
minister
be
uphold
a
long
-
hold
principle
in
law
.
that
be
fair
enough
.
I
have
a
difficulty
sometimes
in
understand
parliamentary
legal
language
.
the
provision
to
the
effect
that
the
identity
of
the
person
make
the
complaint
be
not
disclose
be
fine
,
as
be
the
provision
that
it
relate
to
a
private
matter
and
be
unrelated
to
the
function
of
the
respondent
.
however
,
will
the
minister
explain
the
provision
that
"
it
relate
in
substance
to
a
period
when
the
respondent
be
not
a
public
official
"
?
that
be
fine
.
be
everything
on
foot
of
a
complaint
?
what
I
be
confused
about
be
the
use
of
invert
comma
in
section
36
(
2
)
(
a
)
,
which
refer
to
the
commissioner
,
"
where
he
or
she
be
of
the
opinion
that
there
may
have
be
a
contravention
of
this
act
(
a
"
suspect
contravention
"
)
"
.
why
be
the
word
"
suspect
contravention
"
in
invert
comma
?
as
a
suspect
contravention
?
deputy
D'Arcy
be
ad
idem
with
the
minister
?
I
think
that
the
deputy
say
he
oppose
the
minister
.
I
have
a
comment
also
.
presumably
we
must
follow
the
paper
trail
,
go
back
to
first
principle
again
on
section
36
(
2
)
(
a
)
,
which
state
,
"
the
matter
concerned
be
one
in
respect
of
which
no
complaint
have
be
make
to
the
commissioner
"
.
the
commissioner
act
on
the
basis
of
a
suspect
contravention
-----
-----
but
that
be
on
the
basis
of
submission
that
have
be
make
where
the
public
official
have
be
through
a
informal
process
in
engage
with
the
official
within
the
Standard
in
Public
Office
Commission
,
SIPO
.
it
be
only
after
a
long
period
and
informal
engagement
,
and
a
lack
of
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
commissioner
,
that
the
commissioner
can
suggest
-
not
make
a
finding
-
that
a
investigation
be
open
up
.
the
commissioner
's
reason
would
be
that
he
or
she
believe
that
the
engagement
with
the
public
official
have
be
insufficient
and
that
the
official
have
not
furnish
the
commissioner
with
all
the
detail
require
.
the
commissioner
would
believe
that
there
be
potential
for
material
contravention
and
could
then
trigger
a
investigation
.
as
deputy
Calleary
have
say
,
there
be
sufficient
check
and
balance
build
in
to
the
process
.
be
the
preliminary
inquiry
hold
before
it
hit
the
fan
,
so
to
speak
?
the
one
point
here
be
that
the
minister
be
empowering
the
deputy
commissioner
to
appoint
a
investigation
officer
that
shall
be
appoint
for
such
period
as
the
deputy
commissioner
may
determine
,
shall
be
pay
such
fee
and
expense
as
the
deputy
commissioner
may
,
with
the
consent
of
the
minister
,
from
time
to
time
determine
,
may
resign
at
any
time
,
shall
hold
office
on
such
other
term
and
condition
as
the
deputy
commissioner
may
from
time
to
time
determine
,
include
such
term
and
condition
as
be
likely
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
deputy
commissioner
,
to
secure
the
officer
's
independence
and
impartiality
.
the
minister
be
potentially
go
outside
the
fold
of
the
Standard
in
Public
Office
Commissioner
.
if
I
be
to
be
subjective
,
I
would
say
he
be
conferr
on
the
deputy
commissioner
power
to
appoint
,
hire
,
fire
and
pay
at
will
.
it
would
be
good
-
the
minister
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
-
to
have
a
in
-
house
investigation
staff
and
properly
resource
rather
than
put
it
out
to
tender
.
I
assume
there
would
have
to
be
a
tender
process
.
if
it
be
not
open
to
a
tender
process
,
what
other
process
would
it
be
open
to
?
I
fear
that
the
person
who
could
be
appoint
,
although
appoint
by
the
sheriff
,
so
to
speak
,
could
be
a
bit
of
a
lone
wolf
.
we
cannot
speak
to
the
bona
fide
of
that
person
and
,
without
prescribe
this
in
legislation
,
we
be
rely
on
the
discretion
of
the
deputy
commissioner
.
that
be
a
little
worry
that
I
have
.
I
apologise
.
the
wording
be
clear
.
I
apologise
to
the
minister
.

I

at
all
and

I
do
not
want
to
be
associate
with
that
comment
because
I
be
not
say
that
.
I
just
want
a
deep
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
be
at
play
here
in
relation
to
the
power
of
the
deputy
commissioner
and
he
or
she
staff
.
yes
,
but
what
be
inherent
in
the
legislation
be
that
the
commissioner
have
the
power
to
appoint
a
deputy
commissioner
.
whether
or
not
the
investigation
officer
proceed
by
virtue
of
a
appointment
internally
by
the
deputy
commissioner
or
the
commissioner
,
the
commissioner
can
still
do
what
be
outline
anyway
.
what
be
pertinent
here
be
that
the
legislation
provide
for
enter
and
search
a
premise
.
for
the
purpose
of
the
current
legislation
,
we
have
go
from
a
position
where
I
,
as
a
public
official
,
will
interact
with
a
professional
person
to
ensure
that
my
house
be
in
order
and
I
be
compliant
with
the
legislation
to
one
where
,
if
there
be
sufficient
grounds
,
subject
to
all
the
criterion
propose
and
if
all
else
fail
,
this
power
be
confer
on
they
.
I
be
not
against
that
power
be
give
.
I
be
just
try
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
minister
be
come
from
on
that
.
deputy
Calleary
ask
if
this
be
new
sweeping
power
and
the
motivation
for
they
.
be
it
to
say
that
we
be
take
a
belt
and
brace
approach
to
this
standard
in
public
office
legislation
and
to
have
power
that
be
so
sweeping
,
someone
will
have
no
other
choice
but
to
be
absolutely
compliant
because
failure
to
be
compliant
mean
they
will
literally
have
people
knock
on
they
door
,
which
be
not
necessarily
the
case
at
the
moment
?
I
be
try
to
get
a
understanding
of
the
motivation
.
I
accept
the
change
and
the
motivation
.
would
it
be
possible
for
a
report
to
be
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
perhaps
annually
?
I
do
not
want
to
anonymise
the
effort
but
I
be
refer
to
a
report
state
publicly
the
number
of
case
that
have
be
investigate
or
where
this
power
have
be
use
.
in
that
way
we
would
have
a
sense
of
how
this
new
legislation
will
take
shape
.
be
that
a
reasonable
request
?
okay
.
I
say
"
anonymise
"
.
I
do
not
say
we
should
publicly
name
people
.
the
presumption
be
innocence
.
we
have
to
vindicate
a
person
's
good
name
as
well
.
I
do
not
believe
any
of
we
be
against
this
legislation
but
we
want
to
make
sure
that
sufficient
check
and
balance
be
build
into
the
investigatory
power
provision
to
ensure
that
nobody
act
in
a
nefarious
fashion
to
bring
somebody
down
,
so
to
speak
,
in
a
malevolent
way
.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
person
who
put
he
or
she
name
on
the
ballot
paper
or
the
person
who
be
deem
to
be
a
public
official
have
a
fair
crack
of
the
whip
in
term
of
the
way
the
legislation
be
craft
.
that
be
my
concern
and
,
to
be
frank
,
I
think
the
minister
have
address
they
.
I
have
a
semantic
question
.

-----
I
thank
the
chairman
for
he
kind
remark
.
with
he
permission
,
I
will
deal
with
the
question
that
be
ask
before
I
make
my
statement
,
as
I
be
conscious
that
some
people
need
to
move
on
to
deal
with
other
issue
.
on
the
Palestinian
question
,
the
minister
mention
monetary
commitment
of
€
10
million
,
but
there
be
a
further
funding
commitment
in
2015
to
the
bilateral
co-operation
unit
,
for
which
€
4.2
million
will
be
provide
by
Irish
Aid
.
this
will
support
the
Palestinian
Authority
's
education
development
strategic
plan
and
civil
society
organisation
.
effectively
,
this
be
about
promote
human
rights
and
ensure
funding
be
focus
on
educational
need
.
we
be
confident
that
there
be
no
corruption
in
regard
to
that
fund
because
,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
bilateral
arrangement
be
in
place
,
we
have
people
on
the
ground
in
Ramallah
and
we
closely
monitor
the
situation
there
.
in
regard
to
Uganda
,
when
the
issue
there
arise
in
2012
at
the
office
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
Ireland
act
expeditiously
to
suspend
funding
of
over
€
16
million
in
development
assistance
.
we
compile
a
full
report
,
complete
in
2014
,
through
we
department
's
evaluation
and
audit
unit
.
we
be
satisfied
that
the
fund
have
be
recover
and
step
have
be
take
to
ensure
proper
management
system
be
put
in
place
for
the
future
.
yes
-
no
doubt
about
it
.
since
that
time
,
the
budget
for
Uganda
have
decrease
,
from
€
21
million
in
2014
to
€
16.2
million
in
2015
.
a
interim
programme
be
in
place
for
Uganda
and
we
be
consider
develop
a
new
five
-
year
country
programme
.
that
process
be
ongoing
as
we
speak
.
we
be
take
a
vigilant
line
in
Uganda
.
a
positive
result
of
what
happen
be
that
there
have
be
a
strengthening
of
the
system
for
the
key
partner
country
.
on
the
point
make
by
deputy
O'Sullivan
,
have
visit
some
of
we
key
partner
country
and
consider
how
much
funding
we
divest
,
I
fully
agree
with
she
that
it
would
be
good
to
meet
more
parliamentarian
and
build
link
with
they
at
bilateral
level
,
rather
than
just
meet
people
at
ministerial
or
presidential
level
.
through
that
engagement
,
we
would
well
see
where
the
rubber
hit
the
road
in
term
of
the
impact
of
the
programme
within
that
key
partner
country
.
I
will
give
some
energy
to
encourage
that
.
perhaps
we
should
take
up
that
theme
during
future
visit
to
this
country
,
and
I
hope
to
visit
some
of
they
in
the
not
too
distant
future
.
the
deputy
's
point
be
valid
.
vote

-
international
co-operation
-
cover
the
main
element
of
the
government
's
international
development
assistance
programme
,
Irish
Aid
.
the

provide
the
funding
necessary
to
deliver
the
Department
's
high

level
goal
to
contribute
to
the
reduction
of
global
poverty
and
hunger
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
sub-Saharan
Africa
.
we
can
be
proud
that
against
a
background
of
great
economic
and
budgetary
challenge
,
the
government
have
largely
manage
to
protect
and
stabilise
the
oda
budget
over
the
past
three
year
.
this
be
recognise
as
a
significant
achievement
internationally
.
this
year
,
the
government
have
provide
slightly
in
excess
of
€600
million
for
official
development
assistance
,
a
modest

the
2015
ODA
allocation
represent
a
significant
contribution
by
Ireland
to
international
development
and
be
a
clear
demonstration
of
we

the

to

however

we
can
only
make
progress
towards
the
target
when
economic

allow

now
that
the
economy
have
resume
a
path
to

growth
,
I
will
set
out
the
case
for
build
further
on
we
commitment
during
2015
.
base
on
project
GNP
figure
for
2015
,
the
expect
ODA
GNP
percentage
this
year
be
likely
to
be
approximately
0.4
%
.
this
will
ensure
that
Ireland
remain
one
of
the
most
significant
donor
internationally
on
a
per

basis
.
on
the

which
be
guide
by
we
policy
on
international

,
be
approve
and
launch
by
the
government
in
2013
.
this
policy
clearly
set
out
we
vision
for
a

just
world
and
provide
a
solid
basis
for

the

's

recently
,
we
publish
a
framework
for
action
to
guide
the
implementation
of
we
policy
,
a
copy
of
which
I
have
here
.
this

as
deputy
be
aware
,
the
OECD
development
assistance
committee
,
DAC
,
publish
its
positive
peer
review
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
last
month
.
the
review
praise
we
aid
programme
,
particularly
its
contribution
to
tackle
hunger
and
poverty
.
it
highly
commend
Ireland
on
have
a
clear
overall
vision
for
development
co-operation
and
on
grounding
policy
in
the
need
and
priority
of
we

note
that

Ireland
as

commitment
to

programme
accord
to
international
good
practice
and
principle
for

aid
more

.
in
particular
,
the
review
note
that
Ireland
consistently
continue
to
punch
above
its
weight
-
the
committee
will
forgive
I
if
the
cliché
be
overuse
today
-
on
humanitarian
and
resilience
issue
.
we
be
carefully
review
the
recommendation
in
the
peer
review
report
,
which
will
assist
we
in
continue
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
we
development
during
2015
and
beyond
.
this
year
will
be
a
critical
year
in
the
fight
to
end
extreme
poverty
and
hunger
as
we
maximise
progress
under
the
millennium
development
goal
and
negotiate
a
new
framework
for
international
development
post
-2015
.
the
new
framework
will
mark
a
important
shift
to
sustainable
development
with
clear
and
ambitious
goal
and
target
universally
applicable
to
all
country
to
end
extreme
poverty
,
hunger
and
malnutrition
in
a
single

.
Ireland
be

at

recently
,
the

other

for

include

we
will
also
continue
to

Ireland
's
aid
programme
have
often
be
praise
internationally
for
its
effectiveness
,
its
sharp
focus
on
poverty
reduction
and
its
commitment
to
tackle
hunger
.
development
co-operation
be
at
the
heart
of
we
foreign
policy
.
we
key
objective
for

be
to
continue

aim
at
some
of
the

's
most
vulnerable
and
marginalise

,
help
to
save

and
build

.
we
appreciate
the
continue
strong
support
and
engagement
of
the
committee
,
and
I
welcome
any
question
.
deputy
Smith
be
a
former
minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
as
some
of
the
question
be
quite
technical
member
might
intervene
if
I
miss
any
of
the
point
make
.
in
regard
to
the
question
pose
by
deputy
Smith
,
as
I
understand
it
DAC
praise
Ireland
for
its
work
on
policy
coherence
across
Department
.
a
wide
range
of
Department
participate
in
the
review
.
perhaps
I
miss
something
in
the
question
articulate
by
the
deputy
.
a
interdepartmental
committee
on
development
,
which
I
will
chair
,
be
to
be
establish
.
the
task
of
that
committee
will
be
to
build
on
the
progress
of
the
dac
review
and
to
examine
the
new
sustainable
development
goal
.
we
should
examine
the
possibility
for
further
engagement
between
ngo
and
the
committee
.
I
have
be
at
the
Department
for
a
relatively
short
time
,
and
my
experience
so
far
have
be
that
the
relationship
between
Irish
Aid
,
the
minister
,
Department
official
and
the
NGO
community
be
flexible
and
open
.
there
be
very
much
a
open
door
policy
.
a
question
be
ask
about
the
response
to
Ebola
.
the
Department
of
Health
be
the
main
funding
department
to
the
who
.
with
regard
to
the
Irish
response
to
Ebola
,
give
that
Sierra
Leone
be
one
of
we
partner
country
in
which
we
have
a
embassy
and
embassy
staff
,
we
be
able
to
influence
,
cajole
,
nudge
and
ensure
the
international
response
be
robust
.
there
be
a
critique
of
whether
the
international
response
,
through
all
of
the
international
multilateral
organisation
,
be
quick
enough
,
and
the
answer
be
patently
"
no
"
,
but
if
one
kick
the
tyre
on
the
Irish
response
one
would
see
it
be
robust
and
immediate
.
the
very
weekend
I
be
in
Sierra
Leone
,
after
we
have
begin
meeting
with
the
President
and
various
minister
in
key
department
,
the
UN
mission
be
arrive
,
but
we
be
already
there
on
the
ground
.
this
allow
we
to
state
what
need
to
happen
in
the
response
by
virtue
of
we
experience
of
work
with
key
partner
organisation
such
as
GOAL
,
concern
and
Plan
.
we
know
exactly
what
need
to
happen
with
regard
to
contact
tracing
and
establish
phone
bank
so
people
could
report
in
.
I
would
argue
we
ability
on
the
ground
be
without
par
.
I
know
that
.
I
take
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
and
I
assure
he
that
absolutely
and
utterly
there
have
be
a
response
from
the
Irish
government
at
Geneva
on
this
issue
.
the
danger
of
situation
such
as
this
be
the
mistake
be
repeat
.
I
reassure
the
committee
that
not
only
be
we
very
responsive
and
we
influence
the
international
response
,
and
great
credit
be
due
to
we
embassy
staff
,
but
we
be
also
able
to
feed
back
into
multilateral
organisation
,
such
as
the
EU
,
which
be
represent
in
Sierra
Leone
,
the
UN
,
who
and
other
UN
-
affiliate
organisation
.
when
I
say
Sierra
Leone
,
I
mean
the
three
most
affect
country
in
west
Africa
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
will
use
we
experience
to
be
able
to
influence
future
response
on
issue
such
as
Ebola
should
it
arise
again
.
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
the
point
make
by
deputy
Smith
on
tie
aid
,
and
I
be
in
agreement
with
the
deputy
on
the
idea
of
look
at
potential
procurement
opportunity
for
Irish
company
in
order
that
they
can
build
capacity
,
or
at
least
they
can
be
assist
.
the
Department
title
include
the
word
"
trade
"
and
there
be
no
contradiction
in
assist
Irish
sme
with
they
relationship
to
build
capacity
for
procurement
opportunity
through
multilateral
organisation
such
as
the
UN
World
food
Programme
,
or
seek
to
open
door
in
order
that
they
can
bid
competitively
for
service
which
might
be
provide
internationally
.
I
hope
this
answer
the
question
which
have
be
pose
.
the
0.7
%
target
be
set
in
1973
-
I
be
go
to
say
as
I
recall
but
I
be
only
a
year
old
-
and
we
should
consider
where
Ireland
be
then
.
we
be
talk
about
Ireland
now
and
this
programme
.
the
world
have
change
.
in
monetary
term
,
we
provide
€
667
million
in
2011
,
€629
million
in
2012
,
and
€637
million
in
2013
.
there
have
be
a
slight
increase
on
the
2012
figure
.
I
take
the
point
that
one
could
contend
that
change
in
GNP
figure
,
which
be
the
national
accounting
statistic
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
EU
or
EUROSTAT
,
have
probably
make
it
look
a
little
good
than
it
be
.
the
government
be
focus
on
stabilise
it
,
which
be
what
we
do
in
the
budget
,
and
begin
to
increase
it
,
and
stay
focus
on
the
0.7
%
target
.
obviously
this
target
be
predicate
on
future
economic
growth
and
the
economy
grow
sustainably
.
we
be
still
very
mindful
of
this
and
we
should
not
take
we
mind
off
the
target
.
we
should
very
much
keep
the
focus
on
it
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
upcoming
negotiation
vis-à
-
vo
the
sustainable
development
goal
,
in
which
Ireland
will
have
a
key
part
through
the
co-facilitation
of
talk
.
I
absolutely
and
utterly
understand
the
point
make
,
but
we
will
try
to
increase
the
monetary
value
and
create
a
impact
.
on
deputy
Crowe
's
point
on
bilateral
and
multilateral
engagement
,
we
have
have
to
keep
faith
with
we
commitment
to
multilateral
organisation
,
particularly
the
European
Development
Fund
.
we
have
see
a
monetary
increase
in
total
term
on
the
overall
vote
and
package
but
with
a
slight
decrease
in
vote
27
.
overall
the
monetary
term
have
increase
.
it
speak
to
the
fact
that
while
in
percentage
term
there
have
be
a
positive
change
of
0.3
%
between
2014
and
2015
and
overall
overseas
development
aid
be
increase
,
vote
27
have
decrease
slightly
and
we
acknowledge
this
.
we
still
retain
the
commitment
and
we
be
increase
it
in
monetary
term
.
there
be
no
shift
in
policy
.
I
feel
strongly
that
we
be
as
good
as
the
Irish
Aid
team
we
have
,
which
I
feel
be
excellent
.
the
Department
have
many
expert
in
humanitarian
development
and
development
related
specialist
.
there
be
a
strong
sense
of
ensure
the
relationship
with
the
ngo
be
strengthen
.
if
I
have
one
thing
to
say
,
which
be
a
personal
viewpoint
subject
to
a
tyre
-
kick
exercise
,
we
could
foresee
further
collaboration
between
organisation
and
ngo
on
key
thematic
area
in
certain
geography
.
it
be
a
area
I
would
like
to
examine
further
.
concern
,
GOAL
,
Plan
and
Trócaire
be
all
excellent
organisation
,
and
there
be
no
organisation
which
do
not
have
excellence
as
part
of
its
brief
,
but
in
certain
geographical
area
in
which
we
be
work
,
such
as
South
Sudan
or
Ethiopia
,
with
which
we
have
a
key
partner
country
relationship
,
we
could
consider
bedding
down
a
great
degree
of
collaboration
between
organisation
such
as
GOAL
and
concern
,
which
be
already
there
give
humanitarian
assistance
and
provide
other
programme
,
to
build
a
brand
Ireland
platform
.
the
Development
Assistance
Committee
's
report
state
the
impact
be
very
strong
with
regard
to
taxpayer
funding
and
how
the
agency
work
and
deliver
.
there
be
no
shift
in
policy
.
we
need
to
have
a
good
mix
of
multilateral
and
bilateral
engagement
.
we
bilateral
engagement
have
become
more
successful
because
we
have
very
strong
ambassadorial
team
in
the
key
partner
country
.
we
also
have
very
strong
ngo
,
and
there
be
a
seamless
relationship
between
the
two
.
all
of
the
member
of
the
committee
and
I
have
see
this
at
first
hand
through
various
visit
to
the
key
partner
country
.
I
be
not
concerned
about
transparency
.
the
Ugandan
example
and
the
system
that
have
be
put
in
place
since
then
allow
we
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
effective
approach
and
a
clear
managerial
line
in
relation
to
how
we
look
at
the
programme
and
the
impact
that
they
be
deliver
.
if
one
look
at
the
key
partner
country
,
because
we
have
embassy
there
,
we
have
embassy
team
.
the
team
interact
with
government
official
if
the
programme
be
be
deliver
at
a
governmental
level
,
and
they
interact
with
ngo
if
the
programme
be
be
deliver
at
ngo
level
.
I
be
confident
that
there
be
a
robust
mechanism
to
ensure
transparency
in
how
the
funding
be
deliver
,
but
sometimes
it
be
very
hard
to
put
a
metric
on
it
.
when
I
be
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
I
see
how
metric
could
be
use
.
one
could
put
a
euro
in
at
one
end
and
one
would
know
the
impact
in
term
of
intellectual
property
or
if
a
job
be
create
.
however
,
it
be
very
difficult
to
measure
the
number
of
life
one
assist
in
a
process
such
as
we
be
discuss
because
aid
be
more
nebulous
,
but
one
can
see
the
effect
when
on
be
on
the
ground
.
when
one
meet
worker
from
GOAL
or
concern
,
one
can
see
the
number
of
people
they
feed
every
day
.
that
be
sustain
life
,
but
with
development
programme
,
for
example
,
sustainable
agriculture
programme
in
place
such
as
Tigray
,
one
can
see
farmer
and
know
that
because
of
programme
support
by
Irish
Aid
through
the
ngo
,
not
alone
be
they
sustain
life
and
limb
but
they
be
also
layer
education
and
other
benefit
.
deputy
Crowe
refer
to
the
example
of
fistula
and
the
work
we
be
do
through
the
fistula
hospital
.
there
be
further
opportunity
in
term
of
use
the
research
infrastructure
or
knowledge
we
have
to
assist
in
garner
great
information
in
geography
such
as
Tigray
which
be
part
of
a
country
with
in
excess
of
90
million
people
.
we
must
examine
how
we
can
work
with
people
on
the
ground
to
get
good
statistic
or
to
provide
good
maternal
health
programme
for
woman
and
to
encourage
they
to
go
to
community
centre
to
deliver
baby
in
a
healthy
space
.
such
a
approach
will
ensure
that
we
help
Ethiopia
to
wipe
out
this
problem
once
and
for
all
.
that
be
a
key
area
on
which
we
support
action
.
in
response
to
deputy
Eric
Byrne
's
question
,
one
have
international
agreement
through
multilateral
organisation
such
as
the
UN
.
he
should
forgive
I
if
I
have
miss
the
point
he
make
or
the
question
he
ask
.
the
government
,
through
we
ambassadorial
team
in
Geneva
and
New
York
,
have
a
monitoring
system
of
the
human
rights
element
and
the
labour
clause
and
we
be
a
constituent
part
of
the
UN
organisation
themselves
.
I
refer
to
the
UN
high
Commission
for
Refugee
,
for
example
.
there
be
a
monitoring
element
in
that
regard
.
I
will
speak
from
my
experience
of
deal
with
the
key
partner
country
we
fund
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
Vietnam
.
the
framework
for
action
be
a
excellent
document
,
if
I
do
say
so
myself
,
in
term
of
the
work
the
people
within
the
Department
have
do
.
there
be
high
level
outcome
.
three
goal
have
be
set
out
.
the
first
be
reduce
hunger
and
strong
resilience
.
the
second
be
sustainable
development
and
inclusive
economic
growth
and
then
one
have
good
government
,
human
rights
and
accountability
.
ten
outcome
be
list
which
I
will
not
go
into
now
.
underpin
that
be
key
result
area
that
one
expect
.
everything
we
do
have
a
monitoring
effect
.
we
staff
and
people
in
the
key
partner
country
be
clue
into
the
policy
.
if
I
be
represent
the
government
in
a
engagement
with
the
president
of
the
Tigrayan
region
and
,
for
example
,
we
be
support
a
programme
in
Tigray
,
it
mean
that
we
must
ensure
that
any
programme
we
support
measure
up
to
the
goal
we
have
set
ourselves
on
issue
such
as
human
rights
.
there
be
a
mechanism
in
place
.
one
could
take
a
approach
to
human
rights
to
the
effect
that
we
be
pull
the
plug
on
the
money
if
a
country
do
not
do
x
.
we
foreign
policy
must
be
predicate
on
the
idea
that
one
deepen
relationship
and
build
capacity
,
for
example
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
education
in
order
that
a
educate
population
grow
up
and
have
a
good
chance
.
we
take
a
long
-
term
view
of
what
we
do
.
there
be
no
good
example
of
engagement
at
bilateral
level
than
when
on
a
recent
visit
to
China
the
President
have
to
deliver
a
very
nuanced
message
about
what
need
to
be
do
from
a
human
rights
point
of
view
.
one
take
opportunity
like
that
while
build
up
and
deepening
the
relationship
.
there
be
a
diplomacy
to
it
,
if
one
like
.
I
hope
I
have
answer
the
question
adequately
.
please
let
I
know
if
I
have
not
.

require

I
thank
the
committee
for
its
time
.
I
be
happy
to
recommend
this
two
agreement
for
approval
.
they
present
a
strategy
to
assist
we
caribbean
and
west
African
partner
to
build
large
market
and
foster
trade
in
goods
and
service
as
well
as
stimulate
investment
.
they
reaffirm
the
EU
's
commitment
to
a
close
trade
and
development
partnership
with
the
two
region
.
I
encourage
the
committee
to
recommend
to
Dáil
Éireann
that
the
two
propose
motion
be
approve
so
that
Ireland
be
in
a
position
to
notify
the
Council
of
the
completion
of
its
ratification
procedure
.
I
be
happy
to
take
question
,
and
if
there
be
any
very
difficult
question
that
I
cannot
answer
,
I
have
a
very
competent
team
of
expert
with
I
.
I
will
address
that
question
but
there
be
technical
aspect
to
they
with
respect
to
poultry
,
sugar
and
so
on
.
in
term
of
how
we
trade
with
develop
country
,
I
be
satisfied
that
this
country
's
foreign
policy
with
respect
to
Irish
Aid
policy
be
clearly
structure
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
trade
on
the
basis
of
such
trade
be
a
sustainable
relationship
.
that
feed
into
we
position
in
term
of
a
EU
position
on
this
negotiation
.
Specific
reference
be
make
to
sugar
and
I
want
to
make
a
broad
point
in
response
to
that
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
and
if
people
check
the
historical
debate
of
this
House
,
they
will
note
my
surname
be
possibly
synonymous
with
some
of
that
historical
debate
.
a
political
decision
be
take
at
Council
of
Minister
level
on
the
future
of
that
industry
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Durkan
regard
the
acp
Cotonou
agreement
with
respect
to
the
broad
sugar
industry
,
globally
speak
.
the
global
market
for
sugar
have
transpire
in
a
way
in
which
it
be
not
sell
to
we
at
the
time
.
I
would
make
that
objective
point
.
I
want
to
defer
to
Ms
Mary
Barrett
.
dire
I
say
it
,
the
people
accompany
I
be
global
expert
on
this
agreement
and
we
be
lucky
to
have
the
benefit
of
they
expertise
here
.
if
there
be
further
political
response
need
,
Ms
Barrett
can
defer
to
I
.
with
you
permission
,
Chairman
,
we
will
reply
as
a
team
.
I
wish
to
make
a
broad
point
about
EU
trade
policy
,
to
which
we
subscribe
.
I
refer
member
to
"
trade
for
all
:
towards
a
more
responsible
trade
and
investment
policy
"
,
a
document
publish
last
month
by
the
European
Commission
.
it
contain
a
foreword
by
Cecilia
Malmström
,
the
EU
Trade
Commissioner
.
the
new
approach
"
also
involve
use
trade
agreement
and
trade
preference
programme
as
lever
to
promote
,
around
the
world
,
value
like
sustainable
development
,
human
rights
,
fair
and
ethical
trade
and
the
fight
against
corruption
.
we
will
use
future
EU
agreement
to
improve
the
responsibility
of
supply
chain
.
"
in
term
of
seek
to
have
a
debate
on
the
issue
,
and
refer
to
deputy
Maureen
O'Sullivan
's
point
,
I
agree
that
there
be
a
need
to
discuss
the
wide
EU
policy
implication
of
trade
agreement
of
this
nature
in
the
House
and
in
this
committee
.
I
will
do
anything
I
can
to
facilitate
such
discussion
.
if
one
be
to
interpret
this
forward
,
there
be
definitely
a
shift
in
the
thinking
by
the
commission
on
trade
policy
and
I
encourage
member
to
engage
with
that
document
.
I
be
aware
of
the
position
of
CONCORD
in
respect
of
the
west
African
farmer
's
organisation
.
I
note
that
Germany
,
one
of
the
country
that
be
mention
,
have
sign
up
to
this
agreement
.
the
focus
of
CONCORD
with
regard
to
the
west
African
farmer
be
on
unfair
competition
from
EU
agricultural
product
,
fiscal
loss
,
trade
diversion
towards
the
EU
and
the
undermine
of
regional
integration
.
on
unfair
competition
from
EU
agricultural
product
,
west
Africa
decide
internally
to
exclude
almost
all
agricultural
product
from
liberalisation
.
we
be
confident
that
if
difficulty
arise
,
the
agreement
also
contain
robust
safeguard
which
west
African
country
can
use
.
Mary
Barrett
refer
previously
to
the
Irish
Aid
report
which
kick
the
tyre
,
as
it
be
,
on
this
.
that
be
in
2012
.
on
the
issue
of
fiscal
loss
,
there
be
a
general
tendency
to
over
-
estimate
the
direct
fiscal
loss
result
from
a
EPA
,
but
it
be
find
that
the
great
fiscal
impact
be
to
be
expect
in
west
and
central
Africa
.
the
report
suggest
possible
strategy
to
address
this
.
one
be
play
with
liberalisation
schedule
in
the
EPA
,
second
be
direct
compensation
,
third
be
accompanying
assistance
lead
to
high
tax
collection
through
economic
growth
and
fourth
be
use
epa
as
a
catalyst
for
wide
tax
reform
to
broaden
the
tax
base
and
increase
compliance
.
all
of
this
strategy
have
be
accommodate
with
the
agreement
with
the
west
African
country
,
take
sensitivity
for
revenue
purpose
into
account
in
they
exclude
product
list
,
and
the
EPA
development
programme
,
or
Paped
,
to
deliver
assistance
in
this
regard
and
provision
for
dialogue
on
tax
reform
and
associate
support
from
the
European
Union
.
it
be
the
recognition
of
potential
for
fiscal
loss
to
be
a
big
issue
in
west
Africa
that
lead
to
the
detailed
discussion
on
the
Paped
and
the
associate
commitment
outline
in
the
Council
conclusion
in
2010
and
2014
.
the
European
Commission
have
clearly
state
in
its
late
fact
sheet
on
the
EPA
that
the
amount
allocate
under
the
Paped
correspond
to
the
exist
need
as
estimate
by
the
west
African
authority
and
that
the
EU
will
continue
help
west
Africa
throughout
the
implementation
process
.
the
EU
support
will
continue
beyond
2019
.
on
trade
diversion
,
which
be
another
point
raise
by
CONCORD
,
under
the
agreement
west
African
state
have
agree
to
grant
each
other
at
least
the
same
treatment
as
they
be
grant
the
European
Union
,
which
speak
to
a
point
make
by
deputy
Eric
Byrne
.
this
be
design
to
encourage
regional
integration
and
prevent
trade
diversion
by
EU
product
.
on
the
issue
of
undermine
regional
integration
,
the
negotiation
of
the
EPA
actively
support
integration
in
west
Africa
as
the
16
country
and
two
regional
organisation
define
common
position
and
policy
on
the
issue
at
stake
.
the
west
African
market
access
offer
to
the
EU
be
fully
align
with
the
ECOWAS
common
external
tariff
adopt
in
October
2013
which
lay
the
basis
for
the
ECOWAS
custom
union
.
the
implementation
of
the
EPA
and
the
ECOWAS
-
CET
be
go
hand
-
in
-
hand
and
they
will
mutually
reinforce
each
other
.
Regional
integration
will
be
enhance
as
the
agreement
's
provision
make
custom
procedure
easy
and
more
efficient
.
issue
be
raise
regard
the
Irish
dairy
sector
,
export
certain
type
of
product
and
whether
that
product
have
be
lessen
in
quality
in
any
way
.
that
be
something
on
which
we
need
further
engagement
.
if
there
be
specific
and
concrete
example
of
that
,
we
would
wish
to
hear
about
they
.
I
be
confident
,
and
I
speak
objectively
on
this
,
that
there
be
transparent
production
from
farm
to
fork
with
anything
we
export
.
we
adhere
to
the
high
standard
in
that
regard
and
we
be
bind
by
EU
rule
regard
the
standard
of
that
product
,
whether
they
be
export
within
the
European
Union
or
externally
.
the
use
of
the
farm
to
fork
motto
be
something
deputy
Smith
might
have
fashioned
when
he
be
minister
with
responsibility
for
agriculture
.
my
central
point
be
that
we
must
be
careful
about
assertion
be
make
about
Irish
product
go
to
third
country
.
if
there
be
a
contention
that
some
of
that
product
be
be
undermine
or
devalue
in
any
way
to
meet
export
goal
and
bottom
line
and
profit
margin
,
we
must
engage
further
on
that
.
however
,
we
be
absolutely
clear
in
term
of
Irish
Aid
policy
and
Irish
foreign
policy
.
Irish
Aid
policy
have
always
be
about
ensure
that
whatever
we
bring
to
internal
trade
negotiation
,
in
term
of
a
Irish
position
vis
-à
-
vis
a
final
EU
position
,
it
have
be
on
the
basis
that
the
good
rule
of
probity
apply
and
that
it
be
not
a
paternalistic
trade
relationship
but
a
relationship
of
equal
.
that
be
inherent
in
Irish
Aid
and
in
Irish
foreign
policy
.
integrate
value
into
EU
trade
policy
also
mean
use
trade
policy
as
a
lever
to
promote
European
value
with
all
party
around
the
world
.
trade
agreement
and
trade
preference
programme
can
be
vehicle
to
enhance
respect
for
sustainable
development
,
human
rights
,
fair
and
ethical
trade
and
the
fight
against
corruption
.
the
commission
be
say

as
the
Chairman
be
aware
,
Irish
milk
product
have
be
in
the
Vietnamese
market
since
August
2015
and
it
be
expect
that
dairy
product
on
offer
within
the
Vietnamese
market
will
increase
significantly
in
2016
.
this
outline
will
give
member
a
insight
regard
the
potential
there
.
on
the
aid
programme
,
Vietnam
be
a
key
partner
country
I
have
not
visit
but
the
government
remain
firmly
commit
to
the
aid
programme
.
I
understand
the
Chairman
have
visit
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
Vietnam
be
Irish
Aid's
only
key
partner
country
locate
outside
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
the
government
remain
commit
there
.
I
be
aware
the
committee
of
Public
Account
have
be
there
and
that
a
delegation
from
that
committee
,
lead
by
its
Vice
Chairman
,
travel
in
early
March
to
Vietnam
where
they
visit
Irish
Aid
programme
in
Quang
Triday
and
Ho
Chi
Minh
City
.
Ireland
's
commitment
to
the
Irish
Aid
programme
be
consistent
.
if
the
Chairman
wish
,
I
can
ask
Ms
Maeve
Collins
,
or
Mr.
Kevin
Dowling
,
rather
,
to
give
the
committee
further
insight
on
the
status
of
the
programme
in
real
and
financial
term
.
I
will
endeavour
to
answer
all
of
the
question
.
if
I
do
not
answer
they
comprehensively
,
I
might
defer
.
there
be
some
specific
question
on
certain
area
of
Vietnam
of
which
I
would
not
necessarily
have
knowledge
and
on
which
I
will
defer
to
other
.
on
the
issue
of
human
rights
,
for
the
information
of
the
committee
,
only
yesterday
the
EU
-
Vietnam
human
rights
dialogue
take
place
.
it
be
a
important
mechanism
for
we
at
both
bilateral
and
multilateral
level
,
but
through
the
prism
of
the
European
Union
,
to
have
a
very
frank
,
open
discussion
with
the
Vietnamese
government
on
human
rights
issue
.
as
member
know
,
this
be
lead
by
the
European
Union
,
but
we
embassy
in
Hanoi
be
represent
.
let
I
provide
a
insight
into
some
of
the
issue
discuss
yesterday
.
the
dialogue
be
broadly
constructive
but
with
a
emphasis
on
concrete
co-operation
in
the
protection
and
promotion
of
human
rights
.
some
of
the
key
area
we
have
flag
be
judicial
and
legal
reform
,
freedom
of
expression
,
the
rights
of
person
of
concern
,
and
space
for
stakeholder
promote
human
rights
in
the
civil
society
space
.
also
include
be
multilateral
issue
,
include
UN
mechanism
,
and
HRC
membership
and
co-operation
.
Vietnam
have
now
ratify
the
UN
Convention
against
Torture
.
this
happen
early
in
the
year
.
the
European
Union
offer
some
technical
assistance
on
this
and
on
implementation
.
the
European
Union
welcome
the
reduction
in
the
number
of
crime
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
.
seven
offence
be
remove
from
the
list
.
the
Union
recall
its
support
for
a
moratorium
on
Vietnam
.
Vietnam
indicate
it
have
focus
its
judicial
and
legal
reform
on
protect
and
enhance
rights
link
to
the
millennium
development
goal
and
vulnerable
social
group
.
also
in
the
area
of
human
rights
,
there
be
a
opportunity
to
raise
a
number
of
individual
case
,
particularly
that
of
prisoner
and
other
person
of
concern
.
the
European
Union
also
raise
the
matter
of
police
brutality
and
the
grow
number
of
attack
on
human
rights
and
civil
society
activist
.
Ireland
,
through
we
embassy
and
in
co-operation
with
other
EU
embassy
,
consulate
and
mission
,
be
vigilant
in
the
area
of
human
rights
.
on
the
broad
question
on
the
scrutiny
of
trade
agreement
,
free
trade
agreement
,
or
in
this
case
a
partnership
and
co-operation
agreement
,
time
should
always
be
find
for
great
exploration
of
agreement
.
this
committee
be
the
obvious
place
for
that
,
but
I
take
the
broad
view
that
Ireland
,
through
its
economic
diplomacy
in
term
of
increase
its
trade
potential
across
a
broad
range
of
sector
,
should
not
jettison
the
need
to
ensure
that
we
remain
vigilant
with
we
EU
partner
regard
the
very
issue
discuss
here
,
such
as
human
rights
.
by
continue
to
co-operate
economically
,
there
be
no
variance
between
the
need
of
we
development
co-operation
programme
and
the
need
to
ensure
we
trade
substantially
on
a
bilateral
level
,
or
through
the
European
Union
,
with
country
such
as
Vietnam
.
we
all
see
the
potential
in
Vietnam
.
the
Irish
taxpayer
's
commitment
to
the
Irish
Aid
budget
for
2015
amount
to
€
12
million
,
which
be
substantial
by
any
standard
in
term
of
map
a
single
bilateral
relationship
from
a
Irish
Aid
perspective
.
that
allow
we
to
work
with
the
Vietnamese
government
,
for
instance
,
on
its
own
socioeconomic
development
strategy
in
provide
general
budget
support
.
that
account
for
resilience
in
economic
activity
and
also
for
sustainable
economic
growth
,
which
be
one
of
the
key
pillar
of
we
own
foreign
policy
and
Irish
Aid
policy
.
that
allow
we
some
degree
of
traction
at
bilateral
level
regard
worker
's
rights
or
exploitation
.
it
allow
we
to
ensure
that
we
fund
programme
that
be
act
with
probity
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
Vietnamese
worker
.
however
,
there
be
obviously
a
long
way
to
go
in
the
realisation
of
full
rights
,
and
we
must
remain
vigilant
in
this
respect
.
I
would
argue
that
we
do
so
.
on
the
question
of
why
the
agreement
be
sign
in
2012
,
there
be
no
particular
reason
.
I
would
not
necessarily
regard
it
as
a
delay
because
we
have
excellent
bilateral
relationship
.
that
we
be
deal
with
this
now
be
not
a
reflection
on
we
support
for
Vietnam
.
we
continue
to
ensure
we
maintain
the
investment
in
strengthen
political
and
trade
link
with
Vietnam
for
the
future
.
we
be
also
await
the
consent
of
the
European
Parliament
.
the
matter
be
be
discuss
in
the
European
Parliament
today
.
therefore
,
there
be
no
question
of
Ireland
hold
up
any
progress
.
there
be
some
very
specific
question
on
the
church
,
particular
geographical
area
and
the
protection
of
the
environment
.
there
be
a
question
on
anti-dumping
measure
.
before
I
defer
to
Mr.
Kevin
Dowling
and
,
perhaps
,
Ms
Collins
,
who
can
give
some
insight
base
on
she
in
-
country
experience
,
and
note
what
be
say
by
deputy
Crowe
about
the
AWEPA
meeting
,
it
must
be
note
that
I
approve
yesterday
funding
for
we
commitment
to
AWEPA
in
Ireland
.
there
be
anti-dumping
measure
within
the
free
trade
agreement
.
perhaps
Mr.
Dowling
could
elaborate
on
this
.
I
will
defer
to
Ms
Collins
on
some
of
the
very
specific
issue
deputy
Eric
Byrne
raise
.
there
be
some
question
on
article
5
,
so
we
will
address
the
technical
aspect
of
that
.
can
I
get
clarification
from
deputy
Crowe
on
dump
?
have
specific
example
of
dumping
be
reference
by
ngo
or
civil
society
?
okay
.
I
think
so
,
too
.
I
will
ask
Ms
Collins
to
discuss
the
trigger
mechanism
further
.
deputy
Durkan
seek
clarification
on
aid
for
trade
.
it
be
widely
know
that
Ireland
do
not
tie
its
aid
to
trade
.
we
see
we
bilateral
partnership
with
Vietnam
as
one
whereby
one
work
through
general
government
support
for
programme
to
ensure
economic
sustainability
and
raise
standard
within
the
local
country
.
at
the
same
time
,
through
diplomacy
and
trade
mission
,
we
continue
to
examine
trade
opportunity
that
exist
between
both
country
.
we
do
that
in
a
mutually
respectful
way
.
in
the
relatively
short
time
that
I
have
be
in
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
my
experience
be
that
from
a
trade
promotion
viewpoint
the
relationship
be
not
paternalistic
.
it
be
one
where
there
be
mutual
respect
.
we
continue
to
work
on
the
aid
programme
and
the
development
agenda
,
while
at
the
same
time
try
to
enhance
economic
and
social
co-operation
.
it
must
be
recognise
that
the
social
and
cultural
element
of
this
agreement
be
also
important
.
base
on
despatch
from
Hanoi
,
there
be
a
strong
recognition
of
the
need
to
develop
that
relationship
as
much
as
the
economic
one
.
I
cannot
speak
for
other
country
's
specific
aid
arrangement
,
but
I
can
say
that
Ireland
do
not
tie
aid
to
trade
.
it
be
a
fundamental
pillar
of
we
Irish
Aid
policy
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
it
be
well
telegrap
that
there
be
a
certain
dynamic
between
certain
large
country
and
they
relationship
with
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
other
region
globally
.
in
term
of
long
-
term
sustainable
relationship
building
,
I
have
emphasise
sub
-Saharan
Africa
in
the
past
12
month
or
so
to
enhance
trade
co-operation
and
to
consider
the
opportunity
and
challenge
that
exist
.
sometimes
there
be
a
tendency
to
regard
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
or
Africa
as
a
whole
,
as
a
homogenous
block
,
but
it
be
as
varied
as
the
European
Union
if
one
take
that
as
a
comparable
block
.
we
historical
relationship
with
Africa
be
different
from
the
relationship
with
Vietnam
and
that
be
for
historical
reason
in
the
main
.
I
be
not
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
that
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
there
be
certain
issue
in
relation
to
human
rights
,
enhance
trade
,
cultural
,
multilateral
and
bilateral
link
provide
the
leverage
to
continue
to
have
frank
dialogue
such
as
the
one
which
take
place
yesterday
on
human
rights
.
that
can
only
benefit
the
bilateral
relationship
in
the
long
term
.
I
have
find
that
relationship
be
often
sustain
by
visit
by
Oireachtas
Member
and
minister
.
there
have
be
quite
a
few
ministerial
visit
and
visit
by
committee
member
.
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
be
out
there
recently
.
it
be
true
that
person
-
to
-
person
,
parliamentarian
-
to
-
parliamentarian
and
business
-
to
-
business
contact
be
where
one
gain
on
the
relationship
.
that
be
where
the
term
of
trade
become
more
beneficial
.
I
do
not
see
we
tie
we
aid
at
all
.
we
philosophy
,
base
on
the
fundamental
principle
of
not
tie
aid
,
have
allow
we
to
send
difficult
message
which
need
to
be
impart
,
albeit
respectfully
,
to
various
bilateral
partner
.

the
six
country
which

El

,
Guatemala
,
Honduras
,
Nicaragua
and
Panama
.
diplomatic
relation
between
the
European
Union
and
Central
America
be
formally
establish
with
the
San
José
dialogue
in
1984
and
be
drive
partly
by
the
desire
of
Europe
to
help
bring
to
a
end
the
political
violence
and
instability
that
afflict
the
region
at
that
time
.
Europe
and
Central
America
conclude
a
framework
co-operation
agreement
in
1993
and
a
political
dialogue
and
co-operation
agreement
in
2003
.
in
2007
,
the
European
Council
authorise
the
commission
to
begin
negotiation
on
a
association
agreement
.
talk
on
the
agreement
conclude
in
2010
follow
the
EU
-

party
in
Honduras
in

2012
and
receive
the
approval
of
the
European
Parliament
in
December
of
that
year
.
each
member
state
of
the
European
Union
,
together
with
the
EU
and
the
republic
of
Central
America
,
will
become
a
party
to
this
mix
competence
agreement
.
it
be
call
a
mix
competence
agreement
because
some
of
the
area
cover
by
the
agreement
be
matter
of
EU
competence
while
other
remain
within
the
competence
of
member
state
.
the
agreement
contain
three
pillar
:
political
dialogue
,
co-operation
and
trade
.
it
be
agree
that
the
trade
pillar
of
the
agreement
,
which
involve
European
Union
rather
than
member
state
competence
,
would
be
provisionally
apply
pend
the
ratification
by
all
EU
member
state
of
the
agreement
.
the
trade
element
of
this
agreement
therefore
come
into
effect
during
2013
.
to
date
,
all
six
Central
American
republic
have
ratify
the
agreement
,
while
on
the
EU
side
,
12
member
state
,
include
Ireland
,
have
yet
to
notify
the
European
Commission
that
they
have
complete
all
internal
procedure
necessary
for
the
ratification
of
the
agreement
.
for
Ireland
,
receive
the
approval
of
the
Dáil
be
the
last
step
of
we
domestic
procedure
necessary
for
its
entry
into
force
.
I
will
turn
now
to
the
substance
of
the
agreement
.
this
agreement
have
real
value
for
the
European
Union
and
its
people
and
for
the
people
of
Central
America
.
there
be
significant
economic
advantage
for
both
side
.
the
trade
pillar
of
the
agreement
will
eliminate
high
tariff
,
tackle
technical
barrier
to
trade
,
open
up
service
market
and
public
procurement
market
and
protect
EU
geographical
indication
.
for
Europe
,
this
mean
new
business
opportunity
for
European
exporter
and
investor
.
for
Central
America
,
it
mean
access
to
the
European
market
of
500
million
consumer
and
a
chance
to
move
up
the
industrial
value
chain
and
create
good
quality
job
for
worker
.
over
time
,
under
the
agreement
import
duty
on
industrial
goods
and
fish
will
be
eliminate
.
it
be
estimate
that
the
overall
value
of
tariff
elimination
on
European
export
will
be
in
the
region
of
€
90
million
.
agricultural
trade
will
also
open
up
,
while
protect
sensitive
product
in
both
region
.
Central
American
exporter
of
fruit
and
vegetable
stand
to
gain
significantly
from
the
agreement
.
conversely
,
key
European
export
such
as
whiskey
and
wine
will
enjoy
zero
tariff
.
this
be
good
news
for
the
producer
of
Irish
whiskey
which
we
already
export
in
significant
quantity
to
Panama
.
the
agreement
also
simplify
custom
procedure
.
all
Central
American
country
will
,
within
three
year
,
use
a
single
custom
document
,
thereby
reduce
the
administrative
burden
for
European
exporter
and
trader
within
the
region
.
in
addition
,
we
partner
in
Central
America
have
commit
to
remove
barrier
to
service
,
trade
and
investment
,
which
will
make
the
region
more
attractive
for
European
investor
.
when
fully
enact
,
the
reduce
cost
of
trade
should
have
a
beneficial
impact
on
growth
and
job
creation
in
all
Central
American
country
and
it
be
expect
that
the
agreement
will
have
a
poverty
-
reduce
effect
overall
in
the
region
.
EU
datum
suggest
Central
America
's
gdp
could
grow
by
over
€
2.5
billion
as
a
result
of
the
agreement
.
economic
resilience
will
also
be
improve
by
reduce
reliance
on
the
Unite
State
as
a
destination
for
Central
American
export
.
in
2014
,
the
first
full
year
in
which
the
trade
pillar
of
the
association
agreement
be
in
effect
,
goods
trade
between
the
European
Union
and
Central
America
be
worth
€
10.5
billion
,
a
increase
of
1.2
%
on
the
figure
for
the
previous
year
.
the
European
Union
be
Central
America
's
second
large
trading
partner
after
the
Unite
State
,
exclude
intra-regional
trade
.
in
2014
there
be
a
trade
surplus
of
€
1.7
billion
in
favour
of
Central
America
.
the
chief
import
to
the
European
Union
from
Central
America
be
datum
processing
machine
,
coffee
,
banana
and
pineapple
.
the
main
EU
export
to
Central
America
be
machinery
,
electrical
appliance
,
pharmaceutical
,
motor
vehicle
and
steel
product
.
I
reassure
the
committee
that
the
agreement
contain
very
strong
safeguard
for
human
rights
,
the
rule
of
law
,
democratic
principle
,
respect
for
the
environment
and
worker
's
rights
.
the
very
first
article
state
human
rights
,
the
rule
of
law
and
democratic
principle
constitute
a
''
essential
element
''
of
the
agreement
.
this
mean
that
,
in
a
situation
where
a
government
violate
this
essential
element
,
any
of
the
party
would
be
able
to
react
unilaterally
by
take
proportional
measure
that
could
go
as
far
as
the
suspension
of
the
whole
agreement
.
this
provision
be
a
powerful
statement
of
we
commitment
to
uphold
we
value
.
the
co-operation
pillar
of
the
agreement
commit
the
two
side
to
co-operate
to
achieve
full
compliance
with
all
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedom
,
as
well
as
the
building
and
strengthening
of
democracy
.
it
commit
the
party
to
work
together
in
promote
good
governance
,
fight
against
corruption
and
support
the
participation
of
civil
society
in
decision
-
making
.
the
agreement
have
sustainable
development
at
its
heart
and
commit
both
side
to
respect
,
implement
and
enforce
a
series
of
universal
standard
for
labour
rights
and
the
environment
,
include
the
eight
core
convention
of
the
International
Labour
Organization
.
the
agreement
contain
a
bind
arbitration
mechanism
to
ensure
this
commitment
be
respect
,
which
can
be
trigger
unilaterally
by
the
European
Union
or
any
of
the
Central
American
country
,
even
against
the
will
of
the
country
concerned
.
in
regard
to
oversight
,
the
agreement
forese
the
creation
of
a
committee
of
parliamentarian
,
compose
of
mep
and
Deputy
from
the
Central
American
parliament
.
the
committee
will
have
the
right
to
demand
information
and
make
recommendation
to
the
European
Commission
and
Central
American
government
.
the
agreement
will
also
establish
a
civil
society
dialogue
forum
and
a
consultative
committee
,
design
to
allow
civil
society
to
hold
government
party
accountable
.
I
now
turn
to
what
the
agreement
mean
for
Ireland
.
many
Irish
people
feel
a
affinity
with
Central
America
.
from
the
late
1970
up
to
the
1990
,
a
solidarity
movement
grow
up
in
Ireland
in
reaction
to
the
political
upheaval
and
civil
war
affect
El
Salvador
,
Nicaragua
,
Guatemala
and
Honduras
and
many
Irish
people
travel
to
the
region
in
that
period
as
volunteer
.
there
be
also
a
tradition
of
Irish
missionary
in
Central
America
,
particularly
from
the
1970
onwards
.
we
relation
with
Central
America
receive
a
significant
boost
with
the
visit
of
President
Higgins
to
El
Salvador
and
Costa
Rica
in
2013
,
where
he
receive
a
very
warm
reception
.
we
do
not
have
a
embassy
in
Central
America
and
most
Central
American
republic
be
accredit
to
Ireland
from
they
embassy
in
London
.
there
be
,
therefore
,
significant
potential
to
develop
we
relation
,
which
can
only
be
assist
by
a
agreement
such
as
this
.
Ireland
's
trade
with
the
region
be
small
but
grow
.
Ireland
's
chief
export
to
the
region
include
medicine
,
infant
food
,
medical
equipment
,
industrial
machinery
,
computer
and
alcoholic
beverage
.
we
chief
import
from
Central
America
include
vegetable
and
fruit
,
coffee
,
sugar
and
honey
.
in
2013
,
total
trade
in
goods
between
Ireland
and
the
region
be
worth
€
106
million
.
in
2014
,
the
first
full
year
of
operation
of
the
free
trade
agreement
,
total
trade
grow
to
€
126
million
,
represent
growth
of
almost
20
%
in
we
trade
.
figure
from
January
to
November
2015
show
continue
strong
growth
in
Irish
export
,
particularly
in
trade
with
Panama
,
Guatemala
and
Costa
Rica
.
while
it
be
not
possible
to
prove
causation
,
trade
datum
seem
to
indicate
that
there
be
at
least
a
correlation
between
the
entry
into
force
of
the
trade
element
of
the
association
agreement
in
2013
and
recent
growth
in
Ireland
's
trade
with
the
region
.
this
agreement
will
provide
a
framework
for
strengthen
the
relationship
between
the
European
Union
and
Central
America
in
trade
,
policy
dialogue
and
co-operation
.
it
provide
a
platform
for
bi-regional
engagement
on
issue
concern
health
,
the
environment
,
climate
change
,
energy
,
education
,
employment
and
science
and
technology
and
will
allow
we
to
work
together
to
tackle
global
challenge
,
such
as
migration
,
terrorism
,
money
laundering
,
organised
crime
and
corruption
.
it
contain
important
safeguard
for
human
rights
,
worker
's
rights
and
the
environment
.
the
ratification
of
the
EU
-
Central
America
Association
agreement
not
only
strengthen
the
foundation
of
the
relationship
between
the
EU
,
its
member
states
and
Central
America
but
also
chart
a
course
for
political
and
economic
reform
.
through
Ireland
's
ratification
of
this
agreement
,
we
will
show
we
support
for
the
people
of
Central
America
.
I
thank
the
committee
again
.
I
hope
this
motion
will
meet
with
the
committee
's
approval
and
that
Dáil
Éireann
will
approve
the
term
of
the
agreement
so
that
Ireland
can
proceed
to
ratify
in
the
near
future
.
I
be
happy
to
take
question
at
this
point
.
I
wish
to
thank
deputy
in
general
term
for
they
comment
.
I
will
endeavour
to
reply
to
some
of
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
.
as
regards
labour
rights
and
the
universal
standard
that
apply
to
they
,
the
eight
core
principle
of
the
ILO
be
part
of
that
agreement
.
as
regards
the
main
provision
of
the
agreement
concern
human
rights
,
if
one
examine
the
various
article
inherent
in
the
agreement
,
for
instance
,
article
1
deal
specifically
with
protection
around
human
rights
,
the
rule
of
law
and
democratic
principle
.
climate
change
be
inherent
in
article
50
and
51
,
so
there
be
specific
reference
to
responsibility
in
respect
of
that
issue
.
it
be
evident
through
Irish
Aid
support
that
we
have
commit
more
than
€
17
million
since
2012
to
this
region
.
we
do
much
work
through
we
partner
,
include
Trócaire
,
which
be
a
key
example
in
term
of
capacity
-
building
to
assist
the
people
who
be
most
directly
affect
,
namely
,
the
primary
producer
.
we
do
much
work
at
ground
level
in
that
respect
.
article
41
to
46
specifically
refer
to
address
poverty
,
inequality
and
exclusion
.
provision
be
make
through
specific
programme
in
that
regard
.
there
be
a
programmatic
element
which
ensure
decent
work
for
all
,
respect
for
worker
's
rights
,
equal
access
to
education
and
public
health
and
special
initiative
aim
at
vulnerable
group
such
as
indigenous
community
,
something
on
which
we
be
very
strong
from
a
Irish
perspective
.
let
we
look
at
the
trade
term
.
as
I
say
,
they
favour
Central
America
in
trading
with
the
European
Union
.
in
that
sense
,
we
be
on
a
good
footing
.
it
mean
that
primary
producer
trade
in
coffee
and
fruit
,
in
particular
.
as
deputy
Eric
Byrne
say
,
in
Ireland
we
be
good
consumer
of
coffee
.
in
the
case
of
Fairtrade
Ireland
,
Java
Republic
,
Bewleys
and
other
brand
,
not
to
be
too
brand
specific
at
this
committee
meeting
,
there
be
a
very
strong
impetus
towards
purchase
unroasted
bean
directly
from
producer
through
intermediary
but
give
a
fair
price
to
the
primary
producer
.
this
be
now
inherent
within
the
Irish
consciousness
when
we
consume
coffee
.
we
have
move
a
long
way
from
buy
jar
of
instant
coffee
.
as
a
nation
,
we
be
now
very
discerning
when
it
come
to
ensure
a
proper
dividend
be
pay
to
the
worker
who
operate
in
the
field
.
we
be
satisfied
that
the
agreement
contain
protection
in
that
regard
.
I
will
restate
the
follow
for
the
benefit
of
the
committee
.
in
2014
there
be
a
trade
surplus
of
€
1.7
billion
in
favour
of
Central
America
.
that
show
that
the
trade
term
favour
Central
America
.
Ireland
be
grow
its
level
of
trade
on
a
bilateral
basis
.
on
climate
change
,
Ms
Cavacece
might
want
to
reiterate
what
the
nature
of
the
relationship
be
with
ngo
from
a
Irish
Aid
perspective
.
we
be
confident
that
everything
we
be
do
in
respect
of
the
agreement
correspond
with
we
foreign
affair
policy
on
inclusive
economic
growth
.
I
will
come
back
to
deputy
Maureen
O'Sullivan
on
she
question
on
Belize
.
I
be
pretty
sure
Ms
Ní
Chonchúir
have
the
answer
.
on
Cuba
,
I
meet
Dr.
Herrera
in
the
past
few
week
and
we
have
a
very
positive
discussion
on
how
we
could
enhance
and
improve
the
relationship
between
Ireland
and
Cuba
across
a
range
of
sector
,
include
medicine
,
pharmaceutical
and
education
.
work
be
ongoing
between
he
and
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
in
that
regard
.
if
there
be
specific
area
about
which
the
committee
have
idea
,
I
can
assure
member
that
the
Department
operate
a
open
door
policy
when
it
come
to
area
in
which
we
can
enhance
co-operation
.
when
we
talk
about
equivalence
,
there
be
very
specific
measure
in
the
area
of
food
safety
,
sanitary
and
phytosanitary
requirement
,
energy
,
mining
,
tourism
,
science
and
technology
,
as
well
as
governance
in
term
of
taxation
and
small
to
medium
-
size
enterprise
.
we
be
try
to
reduce
technical
barrier
to
trade
.
sometimes
there
be
a
certain
connotation
surround
the
liberalisation
of
market
,
but
we
be
satisfied
that
the
manner
in
which
the
agreement
have
be
negotiate
be
such
that
there
will
be
very
stringent
check
and
balance
explicit
within
it
.
also
,
there
will
be
a
parliamentary
oversight
function
through
the
European
Parliament
.
if
one
also
have
directly
elect
Member
of
the
European
Parliament
oversee
this
agreement
,
it
mean
that
when
issue
arise
,
they
will
come
to
the
fore
through
the
European
Parliament
.
I
would
not
disagree
with
anything
deputy
Smith
have
say
.
I
share
some
of
he
concern
,
as
do
certain
European
member
state
,
on
the
dispute
mechanism
.
however
,
we
must
remember
that
this
agreement
be
far
from
be
conclude
.
we
be
currently
engage
in
the
12th
round
of
talk
and
a
mechanism
have
be
propose
by
the
European
Union
on
the
investment
court
but
we
be
a
long
way
off
a
agreement
.
I
absolutely
concur
with
deputy
Smith
on
the
protection
of
agriculture
standard
in
particular
.
we
have
exact
food
health
,
food
provision
and
food
production
standard
.
there
be
no
way
we
would
want
that
in
any
way
diminish
.
Agriculture
be
a
key
component
of
we
export
strategy
.
I
totally
agree
with
the
point
make
by
deputy
Smith
,
which
have
now
be
put
on
the
record
.
however
,
a
agreement
be
still
a
long
way
off
.
on
the
procedure
around
the
negotiation
of
TTIP
,
for
a
association
agreement
,
it
be
not
just
about
trade
as
we
be
talk
about
it
today
.
there
be
also
political
dialogue
and
co-operation
give
TTIP
be
a
trade
agreement
.
Mr.
Karl
Finnegan
,
who
represent
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
be
with
we
here
today
and
if
the
committee
would
like
a
little
insight
-
after
the
meeting
-
on
where
negotiation
be
from
a
technical
point
of
view
,
we
would
be
happy
to
facilitate
that
.
in
political
term
,
we
be
a
long
way
from
a
agreement
and
we
all
,
as
parliamentarian
,
have
concern
about
the
dispute
mechanism
and
the
power
of
corporation
relative
to
member
state
.
I
thank
the
Vice
Chairman

this

on

the

should

,
the
parliamentary
counsel
's
advice
in

the
provision
in
section

and
12
be
that
the
specific
concern
raise
in
this
regard
could
well
be
address
by
specify
instead
,
first
,
the
cost
of

and
,
second
,
a
restriction
of

field
of

member

with
which
firm
cover
by

and
register

agreement
,
rea
,
can
be
find
to
be
in

,
and
that
they
should
be
include
as
factor
to
be
assess
in
set
wage
.
a
similar
provision
as
regards
wage
comparison
have
be
address
already
in
subsection
3B
(
k
)
insert
by
amendment
no.
3
,
which
I
understand
have
be
agree
.
accordingly
,
comparison
be
only
applicable
where
firm
cover
by
JLCs
can
be
find
to
be
in
competition
with
enterprise
in
other
EU
member
state
.
the
European
Union
have
develop
a
model
of
economic
and
social
development
which
extend
beyond
the
diversity
of
national
situation
and
be
base
on
common
value
and
principle
,
in
particular
,
the
objective
affirm
in
the
treaty
of
promote
hand
in
hand
economic
and
social
progress
.
EU
member
state
have
already
ratify
a
large
number
of
ILO
convention
relate
in
particular
to
core
labour
standard
,
labour
inspection
,
labour
administration
,
employment
,
social
security
and
wage
.
most
EU
member
state
currently
have
statutory
or
otherwise
legally
bind
or
generally
applicable
minimum
wage
in
place
.
the
impact
of
a
national
minimum
wage
on
both
demand
and
supply
can
differ
markedly
across
member
state
depend
on
the
level
set
as
well
as
other
labour
market
policy
and
institution
.
the
thrust
of
EU
employment
policy
be
that
wage
floor
need
to
be
sufficiently
adjustable
with
the
social
partner
actively
engage
in
ensure
wage
settlement
reflect
overall
economic
development
.
I
believe
the
issue
be
also
raise
with
regard
to
a
early
amendment
as
we
debate
this
particular
issue
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
give
a
undertaking
to
examine
it
.
we
feel
take
the
cost
of
live
into
account
and
restrict
the
field
of
comparison
to
only
that
EU
member
state
with
firm
cover
by
jlc
and
rea
be
a
equitable
way
forward
.
I
be
try
to
understand
the
deputy
's
point
in
respect
of
employer
but
,
respectfully
,
I
do
not
quite
understand
the
point
make
on
how
they
be
give
a
great
role
.
the
deputy
propose
to
apply
more
qualitative
criterion
to
the
process
.
the
government
feel
the
criterion
be
well
meet
and
that
the
jlc
sit
above
the
national
minimum
wage
in
any
sense
.
I
do
not
think
we
should
look
for
increase
criterion
above
the
level
of
wage
.
this
be
the
government
's
view
on
the
matter
.
the
stark
political
reality
in
regard
to
the
national
minimum
wage
be
that
this
government
restore
it
.
we
bring
many
people
back
into
a
wage
that
,
arguably
,
be
more
of
a
living
wage
than
that
who
serve
in
previous
mandate
seek
to
have
available
give
that
it
reduce
they
rights
and
entitlement
.
we
must
take
that
into
account
as
well
.
I
refer
to
the
amendment
and
to
section
42
a
(
7
)
.
this
amendment
provide
for
a
new
commonsense
or
straightforward
definition
of
remuneration
for
the
purpose
of
formulate
proposal
for
ero
so
that
such
proposal
may
no
long
include
pay
or
time
off
from
work
in
lieu
of
public
holiday
;
compensation
pursuant
to
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
,
result
for
require
work
on
a
Sunday
,
a
section
that
will
continue
to
apply
separately
and
should
not
be
duplicate
in
any
ero
;
payment
in
lieu
of
notice
;
or
payment
referrable
to
a
worker
's
redundancy
.
this
amendment
would
include
this
provision
in
the
definition
of
remuneration
.
this
definition
be
provide
in
order
to
comply
with
the
government
's
decision
that
in
future
jlc
will
no
long
set
Sunday
premium
rate
or
any
other
condition
of
employment
already
cover
by
universal
standard
provide
for
in
exist
legislation
.
in
particular
,
provision
for
a
Sunday
premium
will
be
remove
from
the
scope
of
ero
while
preserve
worker
's
entitlement
under
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
.
in
this
context
,
it
be
propose
to
complement
the
removal
of
the
Sunday
premium
from
the
purview
of
jlc
with
a
direction
to
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
to
devise
a
code
of
practice
for
Sunday
work
.
the
propose
code
would
provide
guidance
to
employer
,
employee
and
they
representative
,
in
section
cover
by
EROs
,
on
arrangement
that
may
be
put
in
place
to
comply
with
the
option
as
specify
at
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
.
the
code
of
practice
will
subsequently
be
give
formal
status
by
means
of
a
ministerial
order
.
to
reiterate
,
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
provide
protection
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
status
of
the
EROs
,
what
be
they
status
post
July
and
post
the
high
Court
?
one
must
ask
oneself
that
question
.
what
we
be
seek
to
do
through
this
legislation
be
to
give
a
protection
through
the
propose
code
which
at
least
provide
guidance
in
respect
of
sector
cover
by
the
ero
on
arrangement
that
could
be
put
in
place
to
comply
with
section
14
of
that
very
same
act
.
I
refer
to
that
worker
who
would
have
have
certain
premia
prior
to
July
.
the
question
we
must
ask
ourselves
be
where
the
evidence
be
of
people
bring
case
to
rights
commissioner
post
July
,
where
they
would
have
recourse
to
do
so
?
we
have
to
find
a
mechanism
here
and
we
believe
strongly
that
the
LRC
approach
,
with
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
,
provide
the
good
way
forward
in
term
of
the
protection
of
that
worker
.
I
move
amendment
no.

especially
if
they
be
Kildare
bear
.
to
continue
the
canine
theme
,
perhaps
we
would
not
be
in
the
situation
we
be
in
now
if
we
have
put
a
few
more
dog
in
the
manger
.
I
agree
with
the
point
that
have
be
make
by
Deputy
Lawlor
and
O'Dea
.
it
be
imperative
to
ensure
the
concern
they
have
espouse
be
take
on
board
when
regulation
come
to
the
fore
on
foot
of
the
European
Commission
's
auditing
proposal
that
be
before
we
at
present
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
it
be
sensible
to
provide
for
a
strong
and
robust
auditing
regime
that
be
regulate
by
way
of
legislation
.
if
it
can
be
do
at
EU
level
,
that
be
the
way
to
go
.
I
anticipate
that
this
matter
will
be
consider
during
the
Irish
Presidency
.
it
be
vital
for
we
to
ensure
that
concern
of
this
nature
be
articulate
and
can
work
they
way
into
the
final
legislative
outcome
.
there
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
we
take
this
issue
seriously
.
as
public
representative
,
we
all
have
experience
of
deal
with
community
group
.
I
be
familiar
with
the
credit
union
movement
,
which
have
be
audite
by
particular
firm
and
have
to
go
back
to
that
firm
again
follow
change
in
the
regulatory
regime
at
Central
Bank
level
.
credit
union
have
have
to
pay
considerable
sum
to
that
company
.
certain
issue
arise
in
that
regard
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
voluntary
pillar
,
include
the
various
community
group
,
be
completely
and
utterly
robust
in
how
it
conduct
its
business
.
the
group
in
question
often
have
to
pay
for
audit
report
on
two
or
three
occasion
to
demonstrate
that
.
that
aspect
of
the
system
have
to
be
examine
and
clean
up
.
I
take
the
point
the
Deputy
have
make
.
there
be
no
question
about
the
need
for
a
robust
auditing
regime
.
deputy
O'Dea
mention
that
he
and
other
have
receive
a
submission
from
the
professional
Insurance
Brokers
Association
.
I
understand
that
deputy
Lawlor
have
contact
the
office
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
to
highlight
the
issue
.
I
anticipate
that
a
significant
response
will
be
give
on
report
stage
and
the
matter
will
be
deal
with
.
if
amendment
be
propose
,
or
if
further
discussion
can
be
facilitate
,
we
will
be
very
open
to
that
.
I
thank
deputy
for
they
contribution
.
I
apologise
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
who
be
out
of
the
country
at
present
.
he
have
ask
I
to
convey

gratitude
to
the

contribution
to
the

the

ticket
item
at

be
negotiate
Horizon
2020
,
which
be
the
next
framework
for
research
expenditure
in
the
European

the

be
chair
that
negotiation
,
which
will
be
subject
to

procedure
with

with
a
specific
target
of
20
%
for
sme
engagement
compare
to
15
%
in
the
current
framework

we
believe
this
will
have
a
major
stimulus
effect
in
term
of
sme
engagement
and
job
creation
throughout
the
European
Union
and
in
Ireland
in
particular
.
we
overarching
philosophy
be
to
accelerate
the
economic
and
societal
return
from
the
public
investment
in
research
in
order
to
deliver
high
quality
job
.
in
addition
to
Horizon
2020
,
we
be
also
implement
we
own
research
prioritisation
exercise
which
bring
together
the
State

we
have
prioritise
14
key

,
involve
all
the
State

and
the
hea
to
ensure
maximum

.
we
be
also
pursue
smart
investment
in
research
centre
at
scale
and
with
critical
mass
.
in
2013
,
we
announce
seven
new
large

support
more
than
800

.
this

will
enhance
IDA

the

through

late
this
afternoon
we
will
be
discuss
the
extension
of
SFI
's
mandate
to
include
apply
research
and
to
allow
it
to
fund
research
proposal
close
to
the
apply
research
arena
in
order
to
accelerate
the
exploitation
of
research
for

.
we
be
set

in
a
number
of
other
area
,
include
high

up
unit
,
technology
centre
through
the
institute

and
the
SFI
fund
strategic
research
cluster
.
I
would
be
happy
to
speak
further
on
this
activity
if
member
so
wish
.
a
wide
range
of
question
have
be
ask
.
Horizon
2020
involve
a
co-decision
procedure
and
will
require
the
agreement
of
the
European
Parliament
,
the
commission
and
the
member
state
.
I
be
preside
over
the
negotiation
with
we
team
in
Brussels
,
through
the
permanent
representation
.
ours
be
a
partial
general
approach
,
whereby
the
Council
of
Minister
have
agree
a
negotiating
position
relative
to
the
European
Parliament
.
there
be
certain
area
of
inflection
,
or
certain
challenge
regard
the
full
cost
model
.
we
be
try
to
move
towards
a
simplify
procedure
under
which
call
can
be
issue
.
the
simple
the
mechanism
,
the
great
the
access
for
individual
researcher
and
research
entity
.
there
be
other
difference
between
the
Council
and
the
Parliament
,
for
example
,
on
the
rule
of
participation
.
we
have
go
through
six
trilogue
,
under
which
the
three
entity
have
try
to
move
on
to
the
next
stage
.
we
be
on
trilogue
no.
7
and
will
move
towards
trilogue
no.
8
in
the
latter
half
of
this
week
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
we
hope
to
reach
a
final
conclusion
by
the
end
of
the
Irish
Presidency
because
we
want
to
ensure
a
smooth
transition
between
the
seventh
framework
programme
,
FP7
,
and
Horizon
2020
so
that
there
can
be
clarity
regard
the
latter
throughout
the
EU
's
research
infrastructure
,
particularly
in
Ireland
,
and
it
can
start
seamlessly
on
1
January
2014
.
we
be
still
in
the
midst
of
the
political
negotiation
with
the
other
two
institution
.
a
additional
€
5
million
be
provide
to
the
Programme
for
Research
in
third
Level
Institution
,
PRTLI
,
to
allow
for
payment
that
would
otherwise
have
be
make
in
2013
.
this
allow
for
a
low
allocation
in
the
overall
budget
cut
.
some
18
capital
project
be
still
progress
,
as
be
15

.
Eighteen

be
originally
target
,
but
the
15
be
deliver
approximately
the
same
output
,
namely
,

to

on

,
marine

,
food
for
health
and
perinatal
research
,
which
be
base
out
of

and
the
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
.
the
overarching
philosophy
be
to
ramp
up
into
world
class
research
centre
and
to
increase
industry
engagement
but
this
do
not
preclude
we
from
continue
we
funding
of
regional
technology
centre
,
which
be
not
necessarily
map
onto
the
14
research
prioritisation
area
.
Industry
engage
with
the
technology
centre
through
the

.
we
should
have
distribute
a
note
on
the
distribution
of
the
centre
as
well
as
the
activity
ongoing
in
same
.
I
can
discuss
this
matter
now
,
if
the
deputy
wish
.
on
technology
gateway
,
we
have
-----
technology
gateway
be
house
within
institute
of
technology
in
Letterkenny
,
Athlone
,
Limerick
,
Cork
,
etc
.
they
have
various
theme
.
for
example
,
Waterford
's
theme
be
software
solution
and
mobile
device
and
the
theme
of
CIT
's
Technology
for
Embedding

,
TEC
,
centre
be
embed

for

,
water
and

-
base
application
.
where
specific
thematic
area
exist
,
industry
have
go
-
to
point
to
optimise
its
opportunity
.
I
be
try
to
get
through
all
of
the
committee
's
question
.
the
€100
million
from
industry
to
the
SFI
research
centre
be
cash
or
in
kind
.
the
intellectual
property
protocol
allow
for
arrangement
to
be
agree
between
industry
and
publicly
fund
research
organisation
as
regards
individual
entity
.
the
2013
target
for
tech
centre
-----
there
be
a
set
of
guideline
as
well
as
a
agree
ip
protocol
,
a
document
on
which
be
publish
.
regard
the
research
centre
,
one
must
allow
for
a
certain
degree
of
flexibility
if
one
want
a
great
degree
of
industrial
engagement
in
the
funding
of
research
.
a
designate
technology
transfer
officer
within
each
institution
manage
the
relationship
between
principal
investigator
and
industry
.
if
one
be
too
restrictive
,
one
might
curtail
the
level
of
economic
activity
or
the
opportunity
arise
from
the
engagement
between
publicly
fund
research
and
industry
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
on
this
matter
,
as
I
must
on
the
other
figure
to
which
he
refer
,
namely
,
the
value
of
the
equity
hold
in
Enterprise
Ireland
.
we
will
establish
tech
centre
for
medical
device
,
connect
health
and
pharma
-
manufacturing
.
this
will
map
onto
the
14
priority
research
area
.
dairy
technology
and
analytic
be
two
of
that
area
.
I
will
revert
if
further
question
must
be
answer
.
turn
to
deputy
Conaghan
,
the
fundamental
question
be
not
of
whether
it
be
basic
versus
apply
research
.
they
be
on
the
same
continuum
.
however
,
we
borrow
approximately
€300
million
per
week
.
in
this
light
,
it
be
pertinent
that
the
State
and
its
funder
of
research
would
outline
a
set
of
priority
to
maximise
the
impact
of
that
research
in
term
of
create
new
economic
opportunity
,
namely
,
create
job
and
high
-
potential
start
-
up
as
well
as
resource
the
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
sme
,
that
will
sustain
the
economy
.
we
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
that
perhaps
250000
job
be
lose
between
2008
and
2011
.
through
this
prioritisation
programme
,
and
the
technology
sector
centre
and
prioritisation
area
I
mention
,
we
can
begin
to
leverage
more
from
industry
to
create
that
new
opportunity
.
we
have
state
funding
and
taxpayer
's
money
come
together
with
industry
cash
or
in
-
kind
contribution
to
try
to
ensure
we
can
retain
the
number
of
job
we
have
within
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
and
also
that
we
can
grow
new
opportunity
within
the
domestic
or
indigenous
sector
.
there
be
a
strong
belief
that
by
leverage
that
intellectual
property
and
create
more
opportunity
for
scientist
to
move
into
the
entrepreneurial
sphere
,
the
economy
can
be
sustain
over
a
long
period
.
one
do
not
come
at
the
expense
of
the
other
,
however
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
be
part
of
the
funding
puzzle
,
if
one
wish
.
as
well
as
the
HEA
bloc
grant
there
be
other
area
such
as
the
Irish
Research
Council
and
other
funding
agency
that
can
still
fund
area
of
blue
-
sky
or
basic
research
.
there
be
reasonable
amount
of
money
to
sustain
the
relatively
small
pocket
within
the
humanity
and
social
science
,
area
,
for
example
,
that
may
feel
they
be
outlier
in
any
new
process
of
prioritisation
.
the
two
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
even
within
the
humanity
and
social
science
,
specifically
the
latter
,
there
be
potential
opportunity
within
the
prioritisation
area
which
can
be
map
onto
health
or
datum
analytic
to
provide
new
opportunity
.
it
be
about
take
a
more
lateral
view
about
how
we
fund
into
the
research
space
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
adequately
.
we
be
do
a
metric
paper
at
present
and
will
bring
it
to
cabinet
.
this
will
give
the
deputy
the
context
of
metric
and
how
patent
map
onto
it
-
or
not
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
the
question
one
must
ask
oneself
be
whether
patent
be
a
accurate
measure
of
economic
activity
.
what
long
-
term
effect
do
they
have
in
term
of
create
job
,
etc
.
?
of
themselves
,
as
intellectual
property
,
patent
be
important
in
term
of
protect
the
good
idea
and
the
new
innovation
people
develop
.
what
we
have
seek
to
do
from
the
research
perspective
,
and
be
do
,
be
to
bring
a
paper
to
cabinet
.
the
minister
have
a
strong
input
in
this
regard
.
its
purpose
be
to
ensure
that
wherever
the
State
invest
,
through
all
the
funder
of
research
,
for
example
,
the
HEA
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
the
Health
Research
Board
and
all
the
other
State
funder
,
it
will
map
out
or
measure
the
impact
of
that
research
funding
.
that
be
measure
in
term
of
publication
and
in
the
number
of
job
create
.
one
try
to
measure
the
societal
impact
by
look
at
indicator
such
as
the
European
Union
innovation
index
,
and
so
on
.
there
be
metric
around
publication
of
paper
,
etc
.
the
key
point
be
that
we
be
ensure
that
where
we
be
invest
we
have
a
set
of
criterion
lay
down
such
that
the
metric
have
to
be
measure
in
term
of
the
impact
and
the
number
of
job
create
.
as
that
be
do
it
inform
we
approach
.
I
refer
to
the
SFI
centre
.
this
work
cannot
be
measure
geographically
-
the
geographical
spread
be
incidental
.
it
be
base
on
excellence
,
as
it
must
be
.
if
one
be
to
skew
it
,
base
on
geography
----
the
criterion
be
excellent
science
.
a
criterion
of
excellence
exist
in
term
of
how
one
fund
research
;
it
be
the
fundamental
pillar
for
any
funding
call
or
new
opportunity
.
one
cannot
discriminate
between
various
geographical
area
.
if
,
for
example
,
one
want
to
fund
into
south
Kerry
it
have
to
be
base
on
the
pillar
of
excellence
;
it
can
not
be
because
the
funding
call
be
from
south
Kerry
.
if
one
examine
the
call
and
look
at
where
the
money
have
be
disburse
,
what
have
be
force
be
a
major
collaboration
between
institution
that
might
not
,
historically
,
have
collaborate
with
each
other
.
I
refer
to
the
CLARITY
and
INSIGHT
centre
,
for
example
,
where
DCU
,
UCD
and
NUIG
be
come
together
,
which
be
a
significant
investment
in
the
area
of
datum
analytic
.
one
also
map
the
industry
engagement
,
which
involve
industry
from
all
across
the
country
,
geographically
speak
.
the
geographical
indicator
take
second
place
to
the
pillar
of
excellence
.
one
have
to
fund
excellent
research
regardless
of
where
it
come
from
,
geographically
.
I
hope
that
make
sense
.
there
be
a
headline
target
under
the
Europe
2020
strategy
to
raise
dard
to
2.5
%
of
GNP
.
yes
,
but
in
Ireland
's
case
there
be
a
amount
relate
to
person
abroad
.
as
a
result
,
it
be
argue
that
GNP
be
a
good
measure
of
the
value
than
gdp
.
the
difference
between
GNP
and
gdp
be
that
in
the
latter
one
factor
out
earnings
that
go
back
to
the
mothership
.
the
GNP
target
be
probably
a
good
-----
there
be
no
massaging
of
figure
.
what
we
be
talk
about
here
be
a
true
indicator
,
which
be
good
.
on
a
practical
note
,
we
will
distribute
the
information
on
the
technology
centre
's
status
so
that
member
can
trace
they
lineage
from
the
establishment
of
two
in
March
2010
to
the
propose
three
centre
in
2013
.
we
can
provide
a
further
briefing
note
on
Enterprise
Ireland
's
research
and
development
programme
.
the
committee
have
receive
a
good
note
detail
the
practical
overview
of
the
innovation
voucher
,
the
research
and
development
fund
,
technology
centre
and
high
-
potential
start
-
up
,
hpsuus
.
be
the
committee
to
facilitate
I
,
I
would
welcome
a
opportunity
to
return
and
delve
deep
into
the
issue
of
research
and
innovation
.
since
the
estimate
process
be
condense
,
lead
to
a
concertina
effect
,
one
would
appreciate
a
opportunity
to
return
,
interrogate
the
landscape
further
and
encourage
member
to
visit
some
of
the
research
centre
in
a
co-ordinate
fashion
.
before
I
become
a
minister
of
State
,
this
matter
could
be
nebulous
and
theoretical
.
if
one
get
one
's
finger
dirty
by
see
what
the
researcher
be
do
in
the
centre
and
how
they
engage
with
industry
,
one
have
a
chance
to
understand
the
situation
fully
.
I
be
not
say
that
member
do
not
understand
it
,
but
my
experience
of
visit
the
centre
and
see
they
work
for
myself
help
I
to
capture
what
they
be
do
.
I
wish
to
address
the
issue
of
silo
.
the
minister
hit
on
it
in
term
of
the
health
innovation
hub
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
innovation
,
my
role
be
to
try
to
break
down
that
silo
.
the
recent
announcement
represent
the
large
investment
ever
,
with
€300
million
from
the
industry
as
well
as
state
funding
for
research
organisation
,
institute
of
technology
and
university
.
this
will
break
down
the
traditional
silo
,
element
of
the
industry
will
collaborate
with
one
another
along
thematic
line
,
and
the
silo
within
academic
circle
will
also
be
break
down
.
we
be
in
a
new
disposition
,
in
that
people
must
collaborate
if
they
be
to
flourish
and
survive
.
this
be
the
underlying
principle
.
I
thank
the
chairman
and
will
leave
matter
there
.
I
acknowledge
the
sentiment
express
by
deputy
Calleary
on
the
role
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
I
thank
Deputy
Calleary
and
Tóibín
for
submit
the
various
amendment
and
the
first
propose
amendment
be
essentially
already
capture
when
one
consider
section
7
(
1
)
in
conjunction
with
section
7
(
6
)
,
specifically
line
13
to
18
,
inclusive
.
the
wording
of
the
Bill
as
present
have
be
undertake
in
consultation
with
the
advisory
council
on
science
,
technology
and
innovation
,
and
I
be
satisfied
that
the
wording
of
the
Bill
as
it
stand
be
appropriate
.
it
will
enable
we
to
leverage
more
from
the
ever
-
increase
SFI
investment
and
it
also
grant
SFI
some
flexibility
with
regard
to
future
funding
call
for
the
development
of
Ireland
's
enterprise
development
and
without
diminution
in
standard
of
research
excellence
.
therefore
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
this
amendment
.
with
regard
to
amendment
no.
5
,
it
be
the
government
's
intention
to
inform
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
of
the
strategic
area
of
opportunity
for
Ireland
.
this
will
largely
be
cent
on
priority
area
as
set
out
in
the
recommendation
arise
from
the
national
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
through
the
prioritisation
action
group
,
whose
work
continue
.
I
be
currently
chair
that
process
.
I
be
satisfied
that
we
could
consider
this
for
further
discussion
on
report
stage
,
take
into
account
the
submission
make
by
the
deputy
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
accept
the
amendment
,
although
I
appreciate
the
concern
and
subtlety
of
the
point
make
by
deputy
Calleary
.
I
be
concerned
that
by
include
"
by
another
review
process
equivalent
to
relevant
international
good
practice
"
we
might
somehow
lessen
the
rigour
of
SFI
's
renown
review
process
of
excellence
.
there
be
a
danger
inherent
in
that
if
it
be
dissipate
in
any
way
,
the
core
of
SFI
would
be
diminish
.
I
assure
the
deputy
that
nobody
be
seek
to
diminish
that
in
any
way
and
the
inclusion
of
the
word
"
review
process
equivalent
to
relevant
international
good
practice
"
be
absolutely
necessary
.
such
a
requirement
be
primarily
due
to
the
small
grant
-
fund
programme
that
SFI
be
now
support
in
the
promotion
of
the
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
stem
,
subject
,
where
SFI
's
rigorous
international
scientific
peer
review
process
be
not
a
appropriate
mechanism
to
use
.
deputy
should
be
aware
that
in
March
2012
,
as
part
of
we
reform
programme
,
we
transfer
responsibility
for
the
Discover
Science
&
Engineering
,
DSE
,
programme
from
Forfás
to
SFI
,
give
the
synergy
that
exist
between
the
dse
-
support
action
and
certain
SFI
science
awareness
support
.
in
addition
,
some
of
the
small
grant
that
SFI
administer
,
such
as
the
conference
and
workshop
programme
that
work
to
attract
top
-
class
conference
and
lead
scientist
to
Ireland
,
be
not
internationally
peer
review
and
nor
should
they
be
.
as
be
increasingly
the
case
,
where
opportunity
arise
for
SFI
to
co-fund
with
another
agency
,
Department
or
research
entity
-
in
Ireland
or
in
collaboration
across
international
border
-
it
may
not
always
be
appropriate
or
possible
to
utilise
a
international
scientific
peer
review
process
.
it
be
critical
that
we
ensure
in
such
instance
that
whatever
review
mechanism
be
use
by
SFI
or
it
be
party
to
,
such
a
process
should
be
of
a
appropriately
high
standard
and
of
international
good
practice
.
for
this
reason
,
the
inclusion
of
the
word
"
or
by
any
other
review
process
equivalent
to
relevant
international
good
practice
"
be
absolutely
necessary
in
the
section
.
I
assure
deputy
that
SFI
will
continue
to
operate
its
rigorous
multi-stage
scientific
peer
review
for
the
main
cohort
of
funding
instrument
,
such
as
research
centre
,
the
investigator
's
programme
,
professorship
and
other
principal
investigator
programme
.
the
peer
review
process
have
be
the
bedrock
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
since
its
establishment
in
order
to
ensure
continue
scientific
excellence
and
relevance
to
the
enterprise
base
.
we
do
not
want
to
dilute
that
in
any
way
,
shape
or
form
and
we
want
to
continue
that
strong
pillar
while
allow
flexibility
in
other
area
of
opportunity
,
as
I
refer
to
early
.
we
can
accept
amendment
Nosemcue
3
and
4
without
any
problem
.
just
to
be
sure
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
it
,
we
will
come
back
to
this
on
report
stage
.
SFI
provide
research
grant
funding
to
high
education
institution
and
research
-
perform
entity
and
as
such
a
entity
must
satisfy
a
number
of
criterion
to
be
deem
a
eligible
body
to
compete
for
SFI
funding
call
.
on
page
5
,
line
20
onwards
,
particularly
line
32
to
39
,
inclusive
,
the
Bill
clearly
set
out
how
the
extension
of
the
remit
of
SFI
will
be
provide
for
on
a
all
-
Ireland
basis
.
this
section
therefore
already
provide
for
the
inclusion
of
any
relevant
institution
in
Northern
Ireland
,
include
that
establish
under
the
good
Friday
agreement
,
and
the
important
operational
matter
will
be
whether
any
such
institution
,
be
it
base
in
the
North
or
the
South
,
meet
with
SFI
criterion
to
be
deem
a
eligible
body
to
compete
for
SFI
funding
call
.
it
be
not
necessary
to
accept
the
propose
amendment
.
we
all
adhere
to
the
belief
that
the
underlying
principle
of
create
that
opportunity
subject
to
the
right
criterion
be
the
overarching
principle
in
the
legislation
.
it
be
on
page

,
line
20
onwards
,
particularly
line
32
to
39

inclusive
.
the
Bill
clearly
set
out
how
the
extension
of
SFI
's
remit
will
be
provide
for
on
a
all
-
Ireland
basis
.
I
can
see
where
deputy
Calleary
be
come
from
in
term
of
the
spirit
of
this
amendment
.
appointment
to
the
board
of
SFI
be
make
by
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
in
consultation
with
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
and
with
the
consent
of
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
in
reality
,
this
propose
amendment
capture
what
be
already
establish
practice
when
,
annually
,
the
two
long
serve
SFI
board
member
must
retire
from
the
board
each
July
.
as
part
of
the
board
appointment
process
,
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
actively
consider
the
exist
competency
of
the
SFI
board
membership
and
examine
the
gap
arise
from
board
retirement
or
other
vacancy
that
might
arise
separately
to
the
annual
retirement
process
.
the
minister
also
examine
the
emerge
scientific
or
industrial
expertise
need
and
trend
from
which
the
board
would
benefit
,
the
gender
representation
on
the
board
at
all
time
,
the
ongoing
evolution
of
Ireland
's
research
system
and
in
particular
the
maturing
and
increase
relevance
of
SFI
investment
,
foreign
direct
investment
,
linkage
and
we
indigenous
base
.
the
government
have
also
establish
a
practice
whereby
appointment
to
State
board
be
advertise
publicly
via
the
Public
Appointments
Service
,
pas
,
and
application
invite
.
such
a
advertisement
regard
the
forthcoming
July
2013
SFI
board
vacancy
be
live
on
the
pas
website
,
publicjobs.ie
.
as
part
of
this
process
there
be
a
detailed
list
of
competency
which
potential
SFI
board
member
would
need
to
meet
and
if
we
be
to
accept
the
deputy
's
propose
amendment
in
this
regard
,
we
would
also
need
to
significantly
broaden
the
propose
wording
of
the
Bill
further
.
in
this
case
on
page
6
between
line
6
and
7
we
would
include
text
along
the
follow
line
:
"
in
appoint
member
of
the
board
the
minister
shall
seek
to
ensure
it
contain
a
balance
of
expertise
in
such
area
as
academic
research
,
commercial
research
and
development
,
corporate
governance
,
entrepreneurship
,
research
funding
,
development
and
venture
funding
,
public
engagement
-
outreach
education
,
research
and
development
,
industrial
policy
development
implementation
and
assessment
both
internationally
and
nationally
,
awareness
and
detailed
knowledge
of
Ireland
's
research
landscape
,
public
sector
experience
and
high
education
system
,
"
among
many
other
thing
.
however
,
give
the
establish
practice
undertake
by
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
regard
board
appointment
and
the
openness
of
the
pas
process
which
the
government
have
establish
regard
appointment
to
State
board
,
and
the
lengthy
list
of
competency
I
have
just
mention
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
the
deputy
's
propose
amendment
be
unnecessary
,
therefore
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
accept
it
.
the
question
here
be
whether
one
adhere
to
that
by
way
of
primary
legislation
or
do
it
require
a
cultural
or
systemic
change
in
we
thinking
.
the
view
regard
the
specific
amendment
be
that
while
one
would
absolutely
and
utterly
accept
the
sentiment
express
and
the
spirit
of
the
amendment
,
put
forward
a
specific
quota
target
for
this
piece
of
legislation
would
not
be
appropriate
.
culturally
,
within
SFI
three
of
the
past
five
appointment
have
be
female
.
I
take
the
point
about
drive
a
cultural
and
behavioural
change
across
the
State
board
and
agency
infrastructure
but
in
SFI
there
have
be
a
significant
redistribution
in
gender
balance
.
while
I
be
not
accept
the
amendment
,
I
agree
with
the
sentiment
and
spirit
of
the
amendment
.
if
one
be
to
look
at
the
scientific
or
the
research
landscape
,
there
be
clear
evidence
that
female
researcher
can
reach
a
certain
stage
but
very
few
break
through
that
glass
ceiling
.
that
apply
to
other
sector
of
the
economy
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
accept
a
amendment
to
enforce
a
gender
quota
at
this
stage
.
I
be
willing
to
look
again
at
the
issue
on
report
stage
but
we
must
distinguish
between
the
role
of
the
chief
scientific
adviser
and
the
director
general
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
the
question
be
whether
the
chief
scientific
adviser
have
a
role
in
interrogate
or
advise
on
government
policy
because
government
policy
be
determine
by
that
who
be
give
the
mandate
by
the
people
to
direct
how
policy
be
implement
,
subject
to
advice
,
but
not
necessarily
through
the
chief
scientific
adviser
role
.
we
be
lucky
that
we
have
a
chief
scientific
adviser
and
we
have
continue
to
keep
that
position
in
Ireland
.
as
there
be
only
about
seven
country
worldwide
that
have
a
chief
scientific
adviser
,
we
be
in
a
unique
position
give
that
we
have
be
able
to
keep
that
role
in
spite
of
the
economic
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
I
understand
the
amendment
and
perhaps
we
need
to
examine
it
further
.
the
appointment
of
the
chief
scientific
adviser
be
co-terminous
with
he
appointment
as
director
general
.
the
current
arrangement
will
not
always
necessarily
be
the
case
.
we
can
have
a
further
discussion
on
the
issue
on
report
stage
.
there
be
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
suggest
that
we
be
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
basic
research
and
move
into
apply
research
.
we
be
extend
the
remit
but
,
as
I
say
at
the
early
committee
meeting
,
one
be
the
logical
extension
of
the
other
.
it
be
a
almost
impossible
task
and
would
require
significant
additional
resource
to
be
deploy
within
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
also
across
the
high
education
sector
and
would
be
burdensome
for
the
scientific
community
.
in
reality
,
such
a
proposal
would
add
little
value
over
and
above
the
system
that
Science
Foundation
Ireland
have
in
place
.
perhaps
I
can
explain
it
briefly
.
one
need
to
appreciate
fully
the
nature
and
increase
complexity
of
the
research
continuum
which
be
not
just
at
the
national
level
but
be
global
.
one
need
to
realise
how
it
span
from
the
blue
sky
fundamental
research
through
orient
basic
research
and
on
towards
the
apply
research
arena
.
internationally
,
there
be
the
ever
-
increase
convergence
across
different
scientific
discipline
as
well
as
significantly
different
timeline
in
certain
sector
.
for
example
,
ICT
related
research
evolve
far
more
rapidly
than
the
life
science
and
bioscience
research
area
,
and
the
line
between
pure
fundamental
research
and
truly
apply
research
can
be
very
difficult
to
distinguish
.
research
can
often
span
different
area
and
across
different
type
.
for
instance
,
ICT
related
research
will
cross
over
into
the
life
science
,
energy
and
many
other
research
area
and
will
typically
encompass
basic
clinical
translational
and
apply
research
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
administer
more
than
450
live
research
grant
with
a
award
commitment
value
of
€400
million
span
out
to
2019
.
on
top
of
this
SFI
commitment
level
there
be
also
industry
contribution
in
excess
of
€
100
million
from
a
significant
cohort
of
the
700
plus
industry
partner
directly
connect
to
SFI
fund
researcher
.
the
SFI
grant
award
will
have
differ
duration
and
review
process
which
mean
that
the
SFI
funding
model
and
grant
commitment
and
expenditure
process
be
constantly
evolve
.
invariably
,
there
will
also
be
a
range
of
other
funding
stream
in
research
team
that
involve
certain
SFI
support
scientist
whereby
the
SFI
element
may
be
only
one
aspect
,
along
with
private
industry
funding
,
EU
funding
,
contribution
from
other
private
source
or
other
national
funder
.
committee
member
will
appreciate
that
in
recent
year
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
-
fund
team
leverage
in
excess
of
€
150
million
per
annum
from
source
other
than
its
SFI
grant
,
and
usually
close
to
60
%
come
from
non-Exchequer
source
.
in
2012
,
the
amount
leverage
from
other
source
be
approximately
€
171
million
.
there
be
a
complexity
involve
when
try
to
analyse
and
breakdown
the
funding
between
the
various
point
on
the
research
continuum
.
there
be
the
SFI
provide
element
and
we
must
also
distinguish
between
the
other
funding
source
within
a
year
and
in
each
year
.
funding
be
a
constantly
evolve
and
highly
complex
process
.
SFI
already
manage
the
process
very
tightly
and
effectively
with
its
small
staffing
cohort
of
about
45
person
.
furthermore
,
one
must
remember
that
SFI
be
one
of
we
research
funding
agency
.
even
if
one
be
keen
to
undertake
the
very
resource
intensive
ask
arise
from
the
amendment
,
one
would
still
not
have
a
full
picture
of
Ireland
's
overall
research
landscape
.
typically
,
SFI
research
investment
account
for
just
over
25
%
of
Ireland
's
overall
public
research
investment
.
the
proposal
would
also
place
a
add
burden
on
that
in
the
scientific
community
if
we
be
to
constantly
press
they
to
categorise
they
various
project
and
associate
funding
between
orient
,
basic
and
apply
research
.
such
a
exercise
would
,
most
likely
,
also
eat
further
into
the
Exchequer
's
research
provision
to
the
high
education
institution
.
it
would
mean
that
college
would
have
to
deploy
additional
administrative
support
.
we
need
to
ease
the
administrative
burden
on
the
scientific
community
in
order
for
they
to
do
what
they
do
good
which
be
to
undertake
excellent
research
with
impact
and
relevance
.
on
that
basis
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
.
the
first
thing
to
remember
be
that
research
prioritisation
do
not
account
for
the
entire
SFI
budget
.
we
seek
to
move
or
evolve
the
research
landscape
in
a
way
that
will
ensure
that
all
of
the
State
funder
of
research
be
,
pretty
much
,
on
the
same
trajectory
.
one
then
seek
to
identify
new
area
of
opportunity
where
co-funding
arise
.
for
instance
,
a
memorandum
of
understanding
be
sign
between
Teagasc
and
the
SFI
recently
.
it
identify
new
area
of
opportunity
in
a
food
related
space
.
even
though
food
for
health
be
within
the
priority
area
,
there
be
other
area
of
basic
research
opportunity
that
can
be
mine
from
that
type
of
memorandum
of
understanding
.
similarly
,
the
Irish
Research
Council
fund
a
industry
-
base
PhD
.
one
of
the
area
in
which
I
be
try
to
drive
a
great
coherence
in
education
be
the
area
of
stem
science
technology
,
engineering
and
math
.
we
have
a
National
Centre
of
Excellence
in
Science
and
Mathematics
Teaching
and
learning
.
perhaps
we
could
drive
new
area
of
funding
opportunity
into
stem
science
through
entity
like
the
national
centre
of
excellence
,
DCU
,
ucc
and
other
area
.
I
do
not
just
mean
on
the
pedagogue
side
but
also
funding
to
ensure
that
teacher
at
primary
and
post
-
primary
have
the
ability
and
the
benefit
of
excellent
research
that
would
inform
continual
and
professional
development
.
that
initiative
would
build
up
new
knowledge
area
that
would
provide
for
a
throughput
of
student
into
tertiary
education
and
help
they
to
become
the
good
engineer
,
technologist
,
mathematician
and
scientist
that
the
country
have
to
offer
.
the
point
that
I
be
make
be
that
the
SFI
have
other
area
of
opportunity
outside
of
the
prioritisation
exercise
.
we
have
just
announce
funding
of
€
6.9
million
for
basic
research
with
the
potential
for
entrepreneurial
activity
to
support
basic
scientific
researcher
in
area
such
as
health
.
in
that
sector
it
will
enable
we
to
research
whether
there
be
economical
or
societal
impact
.
SFI
core
funding
will
be
invest
into
that
type
of
a
endeavour
.
SFI
be
not
just
concerned
with
prioritisation
in
the
14
area
.
it
be
involved
in
a
raft
of
other
activity
and
one
shall
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
other
.
in
other
word
,
prioritisation
be
not
apply
at
the
expense
of
basic
research
and
both
aspect
will
continue
together
.
I
shall
respond
in
general
term
.
I
have
always
contend
that
science
research
and
innovation
be
a
apolitical
space
.
with
regard
to
the
amendment
,
I
ask
that
we
debate
the
matter
on
report
stage
.
I
be
openly
dispose
to
accept
it
as
it
would
give
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
a
good
opportunity
to
interrogate
relevant
issue
,
and
I
do
not
mean
that
in
a
load
fashion
.
it
would
derogate
how
the
role
of
SFI
translate
in
term
of
its
operational
structure
and
programme
and
its
impact
from
a
societal
and
economic
point
of
view
.
even
SFI
,
as
a
entity
,
would
welcome
that
opportunity
.
consequently
,
I
be
favourably
dispose
and
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
I
to
return
to
the
matter
on
report
stage
.
I
will
try
to
deal
with
it
then
.
for
the
same
reason
I
outline
in
respect
of
amendment
Nosemcue
10
and
11
,
there
be
a
danger
inherent
within
the
amendment
that
too
short
a
view
might
be
take
.
at
the
time
of
SFI
's
establishment
,
it
be
generally
recognise
that
the
research
it
begin
to
fund
in
2000
would
not
generate
the
desire
outcome
or
impact
for
a
horizon
span
perhaps
ten
to
15
year
and
we
have
not
yet
even
reach
that
stage
.
it
be
important
to
have
perspective
and
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
point
regard
the
opportunity
it
present
to
highlight
the
value
of
research
and
so
on
.
however
,
if
one
be
to
account
for
every
single
cent
or
euro
that
be
spend
and
if
one
seek
to
put
in
place
a
appraisal
mechanism
around
that
,
be
one
then
in
danger
of
create
huge
bureaucracy
or
administrative
function
that
be
unserviceable
precisely
for
the
reason
I
outline
previously
?
for
instance
,
under
the
new
opportunity
that
will
arise
under
Horizon
2020
,
the
foreign
direct
investment
landscape
mention
by
the
deputy
will
,
while
work
with
the
research
landscape
in
Ireland
,
retain
job
.
however
,
we
can
now
use
the
investment
make
of
€300
million
as
leverage
to
create
further
opportunity
during
the
lifetime
of
the
next
framework
programme
,
because
we
believe
we
can
ramp
up
that
activity
and
surpass
the
€600
million
target
under
the
current
framework
.
if
one
be
oblige
to
create
a
administrative
function
to
drill
down
into
that
to
the
last
cent
,
I
do
not
know
whether
one
would
be
able
to
achieve
that
goal
.
I
do
not
know
of
any
research
landscape
in
the
world
,
even
the
most
highly
evolve
,
that
would
be
able
to
achieve
it
.
for
instance
,
if
one
take
the
Fraunhofer
model
,
that
be
,
the
funding
cost
model
that
exist
at
present
under
FP7
,
there
be
a
certain
resistance
by
some
large
research
institution
against
the
simplification
model
the
member
state
be
try
to
establish
.
this
be
because
it
suit
they
as
they
can
fund
administrative
model
that
allow
they
to
get
great
leverage
from
European
Union
funding
call
.
consequently
,
while
I
understand
the
sentiment
behind
the
amendment
,
I
believe
it
be
far
too
prescriptive
.
its
timeline
be
too
short
and
be
member
able
to
develop
a
mechanism
here
whereby
this
matter
be
be
debate
by
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
or
be
at
least
discuss
in
a
formalise
and
structure
way
,
they
could
drill
down
into
such
debate
and
argument
.
in
that
sense
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
accept
the
amendment
.

I
propose
this
amendment
to
give
further
clarification
to
the
exist
law
.
this
series
of
amendment
insert
the
word
"
manage
and
control
"
into
section
of
the
Bill
.
the
objective
appear
to
be
to
cause
all
company
register
in
Ireland
to
be
tax
resident
in
Ireland
.
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
job
,
enterprise
and
innovation
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
consider
the
full
impact
or
consequence
of
any
change
to
tax
law
.
such
a
exercise
be
within
the
function
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
the
propose
amendment
be
illegal
under
EU
law
and
international
law
.
the
provision
would
fall
foul
of
the
EU
law
of
freedom
of
establishment
,
a
core
aspect
of
EU
law
.
the
European
Commission
closely
monitor
compliance
with
this
law
.
the
commission
have
recently
require
Ireland
to
change
a
provision
of
Irish
law
which
require
that
at
least
one
director
of
a
Irish
company
be
resident
in
Ireland
.
this
provision
would
go
much
further
,
effectively
require
all
management
activity
to
occur
within
the
State
.
this
be
clearly
a
hindrance
to
cross
-
border
trade
within
the
European
Union
and
significantly
trammel
the
ability
of
a
company
from
another
EU
member
state
to
establish
in
Ireland
.
this
proposal
would
put
Ireland
in
breach
of
obligation
under
double
taxation
agreement
with
other
country
.
this
be
unprecedented
and
would
be
highly
prejudicial
to
Irish
commerce
and
to
Ireland
's
reputation
internationally
.
therefore
,
I
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
this
amendment
.
the
company
Registration
Office
,
CRO
,
do
not
record
that
.
I
can
try
to
ascertain
some
figure
and
respond
to
the
deputy
at
a
late
stage
.
I
do
not
have
that
information
to
hand
and
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
answer
that
question
but
I
be
happy
to
try
to
facilitate
the
deputy
.
if
he
table
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
I
be
sure
that
information
would
be
forthcoming
.
I
move
amendment
no.

therefore
,
the

be

the
court
effectively
agree

view
proffer
by
the
deputy
.
the

stand

under

law
,
director
be
require
to
have
regard
to
the
interest
of
employee
.
this
amendment
would
change
it
to
a
duty
to
employee
.
this
may
mean
that
member
and
employee
would
have
a
directly
enforceable
right
against
director
where
they
act
contrary
to
they
respective
interest
.
this
would
compromise
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
director
's
relationship
with
the
company
,
which
be
describe
to
be
fiduciary
,
that
be
to
say
it
require
director
to
prefer
the
interest
of
the
company
over
they
interest
or
that
of
other
,
even
where
that
other
include
some
member
of

company
.
the
amendment
put
into
question
the
status
of
the
law
of
oppression
,
which
be
the
principal
protection
of
minority
shareholder
under
the
current
law
and
much
of
the
employment
law
.
such
a
vague
and
general
declaration
of
a
duty
without
any
explanation
as
to
how
it
interact
with
exist
law
would
serve
to
create
great
uncertainty
in
company
law

this
be
directly
contrary
to
one
of
the
key
objective
of
the
Bill
,
which
be
to
clarify
director
's
duty
.
the
amendment
may
also
breach
constitutional
property
rights
.
ultimately
,
bolster
protection
for

do
use

this
provision
only
serve
to
complicate
company
law
and
do
nothing
to
protect
employee
of
partnership
and
sole
trader
and
public
employee
.
therefore
,
I
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
this
amendment
.
no
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
deputy
have
be
brush
up
on
he
neo
-Marxist
economic
theory
-
it
sound
vaguely
familiar
from
my
college
day
-
this
question
be
deal
with
comprehensively
by
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
,
CLRG
,
in
its
2005
report
on
director
's
compliance
statement
.
if
member
will
pardon
my
use
of
acronym
,
the
CLRG
decide
that
such
extra
duty
would
do
little
to
increase
compliance
and
would
merely
result
in
a
increase
in
red
tape
at
significant
cost
to
business
.
the
set
-
up
cost
for
a
business
be
a
estimate
€
90000
and
its
ongoing
annual
cost
be
estimate
at
€
40000
.
a
streamlined
version
of
the
director
's
compliance
statement
propose
by
the
CLRG
,
which
be
a
statutory
body
,
remove
the
requirement
that
the
statement
should
include
a
declaration
that
the
company
have
comply
with
all
other
enactment
that
could
affect
its
financial
performance
.
this
be
find
to
be
the
most
burdensome
aspect
of
the
statement
and
also
the
least
relevant
,
as
company
be
already
legally
oblige
to
comply
with
all
Act
of
the
Oireachtas
.
they
inclusion
in
the
compliance
statement
do
not
add
substantive
duty
.

80
%
of
the
CLRG
's
member
,

member

the
Financial
Regulator
and
other
public
body
,
agree
to
a
more
balance
version
of
the
director
's
compliance
statement
.
there
be
a
strong
EU
impetus
towards
less
unnecessary
regulation
to
make
EU
business
more
competitive
.
this
amendment
would
create
unjustifiable
and
disproportionate
cost
on
Irish
business
and
disadvantage
Ireland
competitively
,
as
we
would
have
go
beyond
other
country
.
the
current
compliance
statement
have
receive
support
from
industry
and
regulator
alike
.
for
this
reason
,
it
be
intend
to
preserve
it

Bill

therefore
,
I
be
not

amendment
.
I
beg
the
Chairman
's
indulgence
.
to
a
certain
extent
,
I
understand
the
motive
behind
the
amendment
,
but
one
must
factor
into
the
equation
a
corpus
of
environmental
,
health
and
safety
and
employment
law
.
the
issue
of
negative
or
positive
externality
do
not
arise
.
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
robust
legislation
.
every
citizen
be
subject
to
the
exist
corpus
of
law
and
company
be
legally
oblige
to
comply
with
all
Act
of
the
Oireachtas
.
that
be
already
inherent
,
thereby
rendering
the
amendment
unsupportable
in
that

however
,
section

not
impose
such
a

on

provide
that
the

to

the

be
to
have
regard
in
the
performance
of

function
shall
include
the
interest
of
the
company
's
employee
in

.
I
hope
that
clarify
the
matter
further
for
the
deputy
.
I
beg
the
chair
's
indulgence
,
but
can
the
deputy
please
explain
that
again
?
we
can
look
at
that
again
on
report
stage
for
deputy
Calleary
.
such
document
be
already
in
circulation
and
be
available
free
from
the
Office
of
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
's
website
.
the
company
Registration
Office
already
send
this
document
to
director
of
newly
form
company
.
however
,
because
most
company
be
form
by
company
formation
's
business
,
the
document
generally
do
not
get
to
the
director
at
all
.
more
important
in
this
respect
be
that
people
apply
to
be
register
as
director
must
acknowledge
that
they
understand
and
accept
they
responsibility
as
director
when
complete
form
A1
or
form
b10
,
that
be
to
say
,
before
they
receive
the
paper
copy
.
therefore
,
I
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
this
amendment
.
however
,
even
though
this
be
not
a
matter
for
primary
legislation
,
I
acknowledge
that
the
idea
be
a
good
one
.
for
this
reason
,
I
will
consider
introduce
a
live
link
to
the
relevant
odce
document
so
that
director
can
read
and
understand
they
duty
online
before
complete
the
electronic
form
when
it
become
available
.
when
people
sign
up
as
director
they
have
obligation
.
as
I
say
early
,
more
important
in
this
respect
,
be
that
people
apply
to
be
register
as
director
must
acknowledge
that
they
understand
and
accept
they
responsibility
as
director
when
complete
form
A1
or
form
b10
.
therefore
,
that
obligation
be
already
there
.
I
do
not
think
anybody
would
disagree
with
the
sentiment
express
.
this
be
not
a
matter
for
primary
legislation
.
it
could
be
deal
with
through
the
odce
and
CRO
simplify
the
language
or
ensure
that
people
be
make
aware
in
the
stark
term
of
they
obligation
in
relation
to
any
legal
entity
of
which
they
become
part
.
that
be
perhaps
all
one
can
do
.
if
somebody
decide
to
become
part
of
a
community
-
voluntary
body
or
legal
entity
,
there
be
only
so
much
that
the
State
or
Government
can
do
to
legislate
in
respect
of
that
decision
.
one
would
expect
that
people
when
sign
up
to
such
body
be
fully
aware
of
they
obligation
.
person
have
a
personal
responsibility
to
find
out
they
obligation
.
if
it
be
possible
to
simplify
the
language
around
that
obligation
the
matter
should
be
take
up
by
the
ODCE
and
CRO
.

since

relate

,
the
group
financial

of
a

,
which
be
also
a

,
would
not
give
any
more
information
than
the
group
account
of
the

at
the

.
therefore
deletion
of

exemption
would
benefit
no
one
other
than
the
lawyer
and
accountant
who
would
have
to
prepare
and
file
thousand
more
group

than
they
do
at
present
.
many
foreign
direct

company
rely
on
this
exemption
to
avoid
have
to
prepare

that
simply
replicate
a

the

of

would
be
substantially

this
would
also
be
a
departure

most

this

exist

this

might
constitute
a
breach

for

I
be

I
be
not

I
understand

this

it

so

I

it

the

he
have
ask

the

I
gather
that
what
deputy
O'Brien
be
get
at-----
every
company
operate
in
Ireland
have
to
be
tax
complaint
in
Ireland
;
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
.
they
have
to
provide
a
report

we
can
delve
a
little
deep
into
it

that
be
no
problem

raise

Law
Review
Group

truthfully
,
I
do
not
anticipate
that
we
will
have
it
by

.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
section
321
on
report
stage
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
limit
its
application
to
accounting
standard
.
the
2006
directive
be
not
a
maximum
harmonisation
directive
and
therefore
there
be
no
obligation
under
European
Union
law
not
to
gold
plate
its
provision
.
the
suggestion
be
,
therefore
,
inessential
give
that
the

's
provision
be
draw
from

that

question
?
okay
.
it
be
propose
to
strengthen
that
aspect
and
to
change
it
to
reflect
the
concern
.
I
can
take
a
look
at
that
before
report
stage
.
be
there
particular
language
that
must
be
build
into
it
?
while
this
matter
have
be
refer
to
the
company
law
review
group
,
I
will
give
the
deputy
some
thought
on
it
here
.
the
question
effectively
pertain
to
the
requirement
that
a
audit
give
a
true
and
fair
view
sufficiently
robust
to
ensure
accurate
accounting
.
that
be
the
aspect
.
fair
enough
.
as
EU
law
require
that
statutory
audit
give
a
true
and
fair
view
,
this
already
be
inherent
within
EU
law
.
while
I
will
not
go
into
the
particular
of
the
directive
,
article
35
state
"
a
audit
opinion
,
which
shall
be
either
unqualified
,
qualified
or
a
adverse
opinion
and
shall
state
clearly
the
opinion
of
the
statutory
auditor
...
as
to
whether
the
annual
financial
statement
give
a
true
and
fair
view
in
accordance
with
the
relevant
financial
reporting
framework
"
.
thus
,
any
change
to
the
current
phrasing
in
section
337
could
contravene
EU
law
.
on
the
question
of
the
revise
audit
and
beg
the
committee
's
indulgence
,
I
propose
to
revert
to
it
on
report
stage
with
a
full
response
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I
cannot
give
deputy

a
definitive
answer

it
be
normally
between
three

if

articulate

we
we
will
be
happy
to

it
again
at

we
will
revert

we
can
give

if
he
be
concerned
about

the
maximum
period
be
18

it
can
be
do
straight
away

let
we
remember
that

address

"
that
last
for
up
to
18
month
or
so
but
a
company
could
move
more
quickly
.
I
understand
that
the
committee
hearing
may
have
deal
with
the
matter
but
perhaps
they
have
not
.
I
ask
the

to

the

I
be

the
Revenue
Commissioner
's

the
current

limit
be
six

it
have
increase
from
six

now

it
be
30

the
amendment
will
push
it

it
have
increase
from

the

state
30

one
could
argue
that
it
will
split
the
difference
with
Revenue
.
I
know
that
the
deputy
be
not
be
pedantic
by
pose
he
question
.
as
he
will
know
,
in
the
case
of
any
Bill
consultation
take
place
with
a
number
of
stakeholder
.
there
may
be
a
departmental
view
,
there
will
be
a
cro
view
and
there
may
even
be
a
Revenue
view
on
the
matter
.
the
original
figure
be
six
month
but
,
follow
consultation
with
various
stakeholder
,
it
be
feel
that
a
figure
of
three
month
would
be
the
most
expeditious
period
,
rather
than
30
day
.
at
the
moment
it
be
six

.
the
Bill
suggest
30

.
it
be
deem
that
the
District
Court
be
unsuitable
for
this
type
of
legislation
.
may
I
beg
the
committee
's
indulgence
to
give
a
further
explanation
?
we
propose
to
introduce
a
amendment
to
section

seek
to

therefore
,
the

change
be
the

,
facilitate

one
of
the
Bill
's
most
far
-
reach
reform
involve
the
introduction
of
a
new
four
-
tier
categorisation
of
offence
.
this
follow
on
from
a
recommendation
of
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
,
CLRG
.
it
be
propose
that
,
except
for
the
most
serious
offence
,
namely
,
fraudulent
trading
and
market
abuse
,
all
offence
under
the
company
act
should
be
categorise
accord
to
this
four
-
tier
scheme
.
at
the
high
end
of
the
scale
,
category
1
offence
carry
,
follow
conviction
on
indictment
,
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
up
to
ten
year
and
-
or
a
€
500000
fine
.
a
further
new
provision
allow
a
trial
court
to
order
a
person
convict
under
the
Bill
to
remedy
any
breach
thereof
in
respect
of
which
he
or
she
be
convict
.
one
of
the
question
that
have
arise
in
relation
to
this
section
be
around
prosecution
of
breach
of
company
law
and
whether
the
Bill
will
rectify
this
issue
.
the
answer
to
that
be
that
corporate
offence
be
by
they
nature
difficult
to
investigate
.
the
fact
that
white
collar
criminal
have
get
off
lightly
in
the
wake
of
the
economic
crisis
should
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
law
be
flawed
.
corporate
criminal
investigation
often
require
the
gathering
and
examination
of
large
volume
of
complex
documentation
,
which
can
be
painstaking
and
time
consume
and
necessitate
wide
consultation
with
expert
,
include
forensic
accountant
and
lawyer
.
equally
,
people
may
be
unwilling
to
give
evidence
voluntarily
in
circumstance
where
they
have
work
with
or
have
close
business
tie
to
a
allege
offender
.
as
a
criminal
must
be
prove
guilty
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
,
many
plausible
case
of
wrongdoing
will
never
be
successfully
prosecute
.
this
must
be
take
into
account
in
term
of
the
context
of
this
section
.
section
798
as
draft
under
exist
law
be
unchanged
.
this
section
be
also
substantially
unchanged
from
that
provide
in
exist
law
.
however
,
the
court
may
make
a
order
restrain
a
company
or
a
officer
of
the
company
from
remove
he
or
she
asset
from
the
State
or
reduce
that
asset
below
a
specify
amount
.
this
extend
to
the
current
law
in
that
it
also
apply
to
the
company
and
not
,
as
provide
under

the

propose

this
be

the

again
,
this
be
a
new

,
the
purpose
of
which
be
to
give
the

a
supplemental
power
in

agreement
where
it
have
grounds
to
believe
that
all
the

against

the

make
and
who
be
a
party
or

.
in
such
circumstance
,
the
court
may
make
a
order
require
any
other
party
or
former
party
to
the
share
acquisition
agreement
to
give
information
to
the
court
in
relation
to
matter
affect
the
application
of
section
807
as
it
apply
to
the

the
court
may
exercise
this
power
on
the
making
of
a
application
for
a

at
any
time
subsequent
to
this
a

recommendation
of

Company
Law
Review
Group
.
with
the
Chairman
's
permission
,
I
will
explain
the
section
now
.
the
section
have
some
change
when
compare
with
the
exist
legislation
.
it
deal
with
the
declaration
by
the
court
restrict
a
director
of
a
insolvent
company
in
be
appoint
or
act
as
a
director
.
the
court
will
make
the
declaration
restrict
the
director
upon
application
from
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
,
the
liquidator
of
a
insolvent
company
or
a
receiver
of
any
property
of
the
company
.
the
restriction
be
for
a
period
of
five
year
and
the
restricted
person
may
not
be
appoint
to
act
in
any
way
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
as
a
director
or
secretary
or
to
be
involved
in
the
formation
or
promotion
of
a
company
,
unless
that
company
meet
the
require
capitalisation
level
.
it
provide
a
defence
for
director
where
they
can
show
that
they
have
act
honestly
and
responsibly
in
respect
of
the
conduct
of
the
affair
of
the
company
,
whether
before
or
after
it
become
insolvent
,
and
where
the
court
can
see
no
other
reason
that
it
would
be
just
and
equitable
that
the
director
be
restrict
.
the
subsection
have
be
amend
,
and

reasonably
be
expect

.
the
reason
for
the
insertion
of
this
provision
be
to
promote
great
co-operation
by
the
director
and
other
officer
with
the
liquidator

this

)
in

"
in

of
which

.
this

be
new
and
provide
that
"
the
Summary

"
may
not

utilise
by
"

,
relate
to

of
the
Bill
do
not
apply
to
a
company
that
have
a
restricted
person
.
we
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
section
829
(
2
)
on
report
stage
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
will
be
to
make
reference
to
"
member
"
rather
than
a
"
subscriber
of
the
constitution
"
.
the
rationale
for
this
be
to
ensure
that
the
provision
apply
to
a
person
who
become
a
member
some
time
after
its
incorporation
.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
section
841
on
report
stage
to
provide
that
foreign
disqualification
order
make
before
the
commencement
of
the
Bill
be
declare
.
this
be
a
new
section
to
deal
with
a
situation
in
which
a
director
become
disqualify
under
the
law
of
another
state
.
in
such
a
case
,
where
the
company
fail
to
notify
the
registrar
of
such
a
situation
,
as
require
by
section
150
(
8
)
of
this
Bill
,
the
relevant
director
will
be
deem
to
be
subject
to
a
disqualification
order
for
a
period
not
exceed
the
remain
period
of
the
foreign
disqualification
.
this
section
be
new
and
tighten
up
the
position
under
the
current
law
whereby
a
person
be
only
require
to
notify
the
registrar
of
they
disqualification
under
the
law
of
another
state
upon
become
a
director
of
a
company
and
not
where
the
foreign
disqualification
occur
subsequent
to
they
become
a
director
of
a
Irish
company
.
question
put
and
agree
to
.
this
be
a
new
section
.
it
be
propose
that
,
subject
to
a
small
number
of
exception
,
such
as
fraudulent
trading
and
market
abuse
,
the
majority
of
offence
under
the
company
act
should
be
classify
accord
to
a
four
-
tier
system
.
as
I
outline
early
,
category
4
offence
will
be
prosecutable
only
on
a
summary
basis
and
on
conviction
will
give
rise
to
no
more
than
a
class
a
fine
,
currently
set
at
€
6394
by
the
Fines
Act
2010
,
previously
£
5000
.
that
be
a
amount
no
great
than
the
District
Court
can
impose
for
any
other
criminal
offence
.
category
3
offence
will
likewise
be
prosecutable
only
summarily
but
on
conviction
may
give
rise
to
a
prison
sentence
of
up
to
six
month
or
a
class
a
fine
or
both
.
both
category
2
and
category
1
offence
attract
the
same
consequence
when
prosecute
summarily
,
namely
,
a
class
a
fine
or
imprisonment
of
up
to
12
month
or
both
.
both
this
category
may
also
be
prosecute
on
indictment
.
in
such
a
case
,
a
category
2
offence
will
attract
a
fine
of
not
more
than
€
50000
or
a
prison
term
not
exceed
five
year
or
both
.
a
category
1
offence
will
have
a
penalty
of
a
fine
of
not
more
than
€
500000
or
up
to
ten
year
in
prison
or
both
.
"
no
"
be
the
answer
.
I
do
not
know
if
I
be
answer
the
question
correctly
,
but
we
cannot
go
beyond
the
level
that
be
set
for
District
Court
fine
.
there
be
quite
a
lot
of
number
in
that
section
.
category
4
offence
will
be
prosecutable
only
on
a
summary
basis
and
on
conviction
will
give
rise
to
no
more
than
a
class
a
fine
.
exactly
,
but
we
be
not
in
a
position
to
determine
what
a
class
a
fine
be
as
per
this
legislation
.
it
be
already
set
out
under
the
term
of
the
Fines
Act
2010
.
I
have
not
see
a
amendment
to
that
effect
.
it
will
reflect
that
.
exactly
.
I
be
clear
in
my
own
mind
and
the
Deputy
have
articulate
they
view
.
for
purpose
of
clarification
,
it
be
important
to
state
that
there
be
fine
up
to
what
be
the
equivalent
of
£
5000
.
we
be
prescribe
a
maximum
but
it
involve
fine
up
to
that
amount
.
therefore
there
be
a
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
court
.
I
move
amendment
no.
