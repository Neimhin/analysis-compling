on
the
issue
of
the
contingency
arrangement
,
we
all
appreciate
there
be
only
so
much
information
the
Taoiseach
can
put
into
the
public
domain
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
information
the
Taoiseach
be
provide
we
with
today
be
not
enough
to
allay
the
fear
of
people
in
community
throughout
Ireland
.
person
need
to
know
if
the
phone
will
be
answer
on
Friday
and
by
whom
.
person
need
to
know
who
will
respond
if
someone
's
house
be
break
into
or
if
a
neighbourhood
watch
programme
report
a
local
crime
.
this
be
all
simple
question
be
ask
by
people
in
community
today
.
I
be
ask
the
Taoiseach
if
he
could
give
we
more
detailed
information
while
take
into
account
there
be
certain
security
issue
involve
,
if
he
could
make
available
to
the
House
the
range
of
contingency
arrangement
,
and
if
he
could
be
a
bit
more
generous
in
term
of
what
it
be
that
be
be
propose
in
this
regard
.
what
border
?
there
be
two
very
important
documentary
on
RTE
television
last
night
.
I
want
to
refer
to
the
more
important
one
.
I
refer
to
Louise
O'Neill
's
exploration
of
the
issue
of
consent
and
rape
culture
in
Ireland
.
it
be
extremely
harrowing
viewing
.
one
of
the
statistic
mention
be
that
80
%
of
rape
victim
know
they
attacker
.
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
,
in
the
context
of
the
publication
of
the
woman
's
Aid
2015
report
,
to
provide
a
update
on
when
the
criminal
justice
(
victim
of
crime
)
Bill
will
reach
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
understand
the
head
of
the
Bill
be
agree
well
over
a
year
ago
.

,

be
the
Tánaiste
aware
that
today
SIPTU
announce
it
be
set
a
deadline
for
next
Thursday
to
ballot
its
member
on
the
reconvening
of
talk
on
a
successor
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
?
be
the
government
agreeable
to
commence
that
talk
on
the
date
announce
?
I
again
pay
tribute
to
Senator
Mark
Daly
and
that
who
have
work
on
the
draft
of
this
legislation
.
I
have
no
doubt
many
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
have
work
closely
with
other
in
the
preparation
and
draft
of
the
proposal
before
we
.
we
be
12
year
on
from
the
recognition
of
Irish
sign
Language
in
the
six
County
and
I
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
would
be
of
exactly
the
same
view
as
myself
on
this
issue
.
it
be
to
we
shame
that
12
year
on
we
have
yet
to
officially
recognise
one
of
we
two
indigenous
language
on
this
island
,
while
north
of
the
Border
this
have
be
do
.
with
all
of
the
requirement
entail
in
the
good
Friday
agreement
,
this
failure
to
reach
a
point
of
equality
of
recognition
of
the
need
and
rights
of
section
of
we
society
be
a
indictment
of
we
political
system
and
of
successive
government
.
this
be
a
motion
on
a
report
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
and
all
expression
of
appreciation
be
due
to
all
the
member
of
that
committee
.
we
be
a
cohesive
and
hard
-
work
body
of
Member
of
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
.
we
be
industrious
and
intend
to
continue
to
so
be
.
it
be
important
to
reflect
on
the
Irish
deaf
Society
's
key
and
critical
point
.
I
want
to
pay
tribute
to
Eddie
Redmond
and
all
the
team
at
the
Irish
deaf
Society
.
in
its
small
publication
,
ten
main
reason
Irish
sign
language
must
be
recognise
by
the
State
as
a
language
of
this
country
,
it
cite
the
number
of
people
who
use
ISL
on
a
daily
basis
.
for
this
regular
ISL
user
,
it
be
a
innate
and
a
integral
part
of
they
personality
.
ISL
be
the
only
natural
and
fully
accessible
language
for
deaf
child
.
there
be
no
national
registry
of
ISL
interpreter
and
ISL
teacher
and
,
furthermore
,
there
be
no
accreditation
or
monitoring
system
.
ISL
have
be
in
use
for
century
,
as
we
have
already
report
.
service
provider
,
such
as
government
body
,
be
not
legally
oblige
as
matter
stand
to
respect
Irish
sign
language
.
the
motion
call
on
the
government
to
recognise
ISL
have
be
pass
by
more
than
40
local
authority
across
this
jurisdiction
,
which
be
a
important
point
that
have
not
yet
be
make
.
there
be
no
automatic
right
for
deaf
people
to
have
a
isl
interpreter
in
the
justice
system
.
no
deaf
child
can
fully
learn
Irish
sign
language
as
not
all
allocate

fluent
or
even
qualified
in
ISL
.
there
be
no
access
for
deaf
people
to
emergency
or
help
line
service
in
ISL
,
something
that
be
hugely
important
.
I
thank
the
Member
who
speak
,
attend
and
we
special
visitor
,
the
member
of
the
deaf
community
and
friend
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
.
I
thank
especially
the
interpreter
who
have
be
wonderful
on
this
very
exceptional
and
special
occasion
.
I
wish
every
success
to
we
purpose
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
lack
of
access
to
woman
's
gynaecology
service
in
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
,
CUMH
.
woman
in
the
Cork
region
have
drastically
long
waiting
time
for
this
service
than
woman
elsewhere
in
the
country
.
it
be
cause
devastating
consequence
for
the
woman
and
they
family
in
the
region
serve
by
the
Cork
University
Hospital
and
CUMH
.
I
will
outline
some
fact
that
have
be
communicate
to
I
.
I
admit
to
be
quite
new
to
this
issue
.
the
matter
be
refer
to
I
by
a
consultant
gynaecologist
and
the
director
of
the
gynaecology
unit
at
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
.
she
tell
I
the
gynaecology
service
for
woman
in
Cork
have
be
neglect
in
the
past
decade
.
there
be
currently
4058
woman
wait
for
a
outpatient
appointment
.
it
be
the
long
wait
list
of
all
gynaecology
unit
nationwide
and
be
increase
by
approximately
1000
per
year
.
it
be
also
three
time
the
size
of
the
Cork
University
Hospital
general
surgery
outpatient
waiting
list
,
with
35
%
of
woman
wait
over
a
year
for
a
outpatient
appointment
and
many
wait
two
to
three
year
.
many
woman
arrive
in
emergency
room
in
crisis
due
to
long
waiting
time
.
I
have
be
tell
there
be
a
risk
of
delay
diagnosis
of
cancer
in
woman
who
be
force
to
wait
for
year
for
they
outpatient
assessment
,
and
this
be
a
clinical
assessment
of
that
.
there
be
518
woman
on
a
waiting
list
for
surgery
,
38
%
of
whom
have
be
wait
at
least
one
year
.
Cork
have
the
long
waiting
list
for
gynaecological
surgery
,
be
twice
that
of
the
Rotunda
Hospital
,
which
rank
second
.
in
the
past
decade
,
no
new
consultant
gynaecologist
post
have
be
create
in
Cork
,
despite
the
fact
that
26
such
post
have
be
advertise
nationwide
in
a
one
-
year
period
during
2015
and
2016
.
gynaecology
theatre
in
CUMH
be
function
at
only
40
%
of
they
originally
intend
capacity
.
CUMH
have
two
fully
commission
,
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
gynaecology
theatre
,
only
one
of
which
be
use
for
surgery
and
for
just
four
day
per
week
.
I
want
to
distinguish
between
gynaecology
and
maternity
service
.
I
anticipate
that
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
may
refer
specifically
to
maternity
service
.
I
hope
it
will
not
.
I
refer
specifically
to
gynaecology
service
and
the
lack
of
service
for
woman
's
health
.
this
be
not
a
call
for
additional
funding
.
the
issue
be
one
of
governance
and
ensure
the
HSE
make
a
great
effort
to
allow
the
service
to
be
put
in
place
.
I
do
not
believe
for
a
minute
that
it
be
due
to
a
lack
of
funding
.
it
be
due
to
a
lack
of
will
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
she
reply
.
she
speak
of
some
progress
in
the
appointment
of
a
sonographer
and
a
clear
schedule
to
clear
the
ultrasound
waiting
list
by
2016
.
in
that
sense
,
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
.
in
raise
the
issue
,
I
be
try
to
examine
the
governance
issue
regard
the
relationship
between
CUMH
and
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
.
although
the
HSE
will
examine
it
as
come
under
the
umbrella
of
CUH
,
it
must
be
recognise
as
a
separate
governance
procedure
similar
to
other
hospital
in
the
South
-
South
West
hospital
group
.
we
need
to
examine
how
we
provide
for
the
reduction
in
waiting
time
for
woman
who
have
be
wait
too
long
for
access
to
service
.
we
also
need
to
examine
the
risk
that
be
build
in
regard
the
potential
for
the
development
of
cancer
as
a
result
of
overly
long
waiting
time
.
I
acknowledge
the
response
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
deputy
Simon
Harris
,
he
colleague
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Marcella
Corcoran
Kennedy
to
interrogate
the
dynamic
between
that
who
manage
CUMH
from
a
HSE
perspective
and
that
who
be
clinical
lead
.
at
one
stage
,
when
we
be
go
through
a
reconfiguration
of
hospital
in
the
Cork
region
,
clinician
be
take
the
lead
and
decision
be
be
base
on
clinically
lead
practice
.
now
,
it
have
shif
back
to
the
HSE
.
while
I
will
speak
to
the
Minister
of
Health
myself
about
it
,
will
the
Minister
of
State
convey
to
the
minister
that
we
need
to
improve
the
gynaecological
service
in
CUMH
?
we
support
this
motion
.
there
be
aspect
of
it
worthy
of
further
interrogation
,
particularly
the
publication
by
grant
Thornton
of
its
report
predict
that
450
to
500
post
office
will
cease
to
exist
by
2017
.
I
question
that
figure
because
the
evidence
during
the
past
five
year
would
not
bear
it
out
.
it
would
take
a
major
diminution
in
service
for
that
figure
to
be
borne
out
in
real
term
.
notwithstanding
that
,
there
be
a
problem
.
be
people
in
rural
area
go
into
they
local
post
office
to
use
they
service
or
do
they
drive
past
they
and
go
to
the
near
town
,
urban
conurbation
or
city
?
when
I
be
a
county
councillor
,
I
advocate
strongly
for
young
couple
who
want
to
build
house
in
rural
area
.
between
2004
and
2007
,
I
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
help
young
people
to
obtain
planning
permission
in
rural
area
where
there
be
post
office
.
it
be
arguable
,
however
,
that
most
of
that
people
do
not
use
they
local
post
office
but
drive
to
the
near
town
to
avail
of
all
the
service
available
there
.
how
do
we
disrupt
that
behaviour
and
incentivise
people
to
develop
a
loyalty
to
they
own
local
office
?
that
will
be
challenging
.
it
will
require
behavioural
change
.
a
Post
make
a
submission
recently
to
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Art
,
Heritage
,
Regional
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
set
out
metric
.
it
have
introduce
the
court
fine
payment
system
.
it
will
extend
the
National
lottery
service
to
all
post
office
nationwide
.
the
State
savings
business
be
grow
and
be
worth
over
€
20
billion
.
it
be
talk
about
plan
to
enhance
that
service
but
will
that
translate
into
more
people
go
into
post
office
to
transact
that
business
or
will
people
prefer
to
do
it
online
?
since
March
2014
,
a
Post
have
experience
a
decline
of
over
11
%
in
core
mail
usage
.
since
the
peak
of
mail
reach
in
2007
,
it
have
experience
a
38
%
decline
.
there
be
behavioural
change
from
post
letter
to
online
transaction
,
particularly
for
government
service
.
I
do
not
see
the
State
directly
subsidise
individual
post
office
but
a
co-operative
model
for
community
where
the
local
post
office
be
under
threat
have
be
mention
.
we
have
and
still
have
a
strong
co-operative
etho
in
this
State
and
I
do
not
see
why
,
with
soft
or
hard
support
,
community
where
there
be
office
at
risk
of
closure
,
not
be
pass
on
to
the
next
generation
or
with
no
uptake
if
somebody
decide
to
retire
,
could
not
develop
a
social
enterprise
model
.
I
do
not
know
how
many
motion
about
rural
post
office
I
have
witness
in
the
past
ten
year
.
if
we
can
be
progressive
and
expansive
in
we
thinking
and
work
with
community
,
we
can
see
whether
,
short
of
direct
subsidisation
,
we
can
build
out
a
co-operative
model
.
it
be
only
one
suggestion
but
it
could
be
do
on
a
trial
basis
in
one
or
two
community
.
if
they
feel
strongly
enough
about
they
local
post
office
,
and
the
survey
tell
we
that
they
do
,
then
let
we
put
that
to
the
test
and
see
if
there
be
other
way
of
deal
with
this
issue
.
it
it
worth
read
into
the
record
again
that
which
be
state
by
a
Post
.
in
March
2014
,
a
Post
say
that
it
have
more
than
750000
weekly
Department
of
social
Protection
customer
.
I
know
this
have
be
mention
already
.
this
have
now
fall
to
625000
customer
,
a
decline
of
17
%
.
a
Post
have
say
that
it
be
cause
primarily
by
a
decline
of
30
%
in
the
number
of
jobseeker
payment
as
people
gain
employment
or
move
onto
scheme
.
a
post
then
experience
a
reduction
of
5
%
in
pension
payment
due
to
the
very
low
number
of
new
pensioner
choose
the
post
office
option
for
they
payment
.
I
know
that
there
be
some
tension
around
that
but
we
have
to
be
honest
:
if
people
decide
that
they
want
they
payment
pay
in
a
particular
way
,
that
be
the
choice
of
citizen
.
while
we
in
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
,
I
do
not
take
the
dystopian
view
that
post
office
will
be
wipe
out
.
we
have
see
a
growth
in
the
number
of
one
-
off
rural
house
and
we
have
see
investment
in
school
in
rural
area
.
what
we
need
to
do
now
be
see
how
we
can
help
community
,
particularly
that
in
sensitive
area
,
such
as
the
one
that
deputy
Pearse
Doherty
speak
about
in
he
own
native
Gweedore
.
if
we
take
that
as
a
example
,
and
there
have
be
public
meeting
around
this
,
perhaps
it
be
one
area
that
we
could
look
at
as
a
model
in
which
stakeholder
can
come
together
to
sustain
the
post
office
and
roll
in
other
service
,
not
just
post
office
-
related
service
but
other
social
service
,
to
create
the
kind
of
hub
that
be
so
vital
to
the
rural
community
to
which
we
refer
in
the
context
of
the
motion
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Bill
.
I
have
to
say
that
in
general
term
,
it
have
to
be
welcome
in
as
far
as
it
go
.
obviously
,
it
be
welcome
that
more
specific
provision
be
be
make
regard
the
admission
of
people
with
special
need
to
school
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
a
great
level
of
transparency
be
be
provide
in
relation
to
admission
policy
.
in
the
past
,
it
be
often
a
very
secretive
process
.
Parent
have
to
be
in
the
know
in
order
to
get
they
child
into
school
.
it
be
good
that
everything
will
be
deal
with
in
a
upfront
and
open
manner
from
now
on
.
I
refer
to
the
requirement
on
school
to
publish
they
admission
policy
.
it
be
deeply
ironic
and
incredible
that
the
minister
be
not
address
the
baptism
barrier
in
this
legislation
because
it
be
the
great
barrier
to
admission
to
school
and
it
be
the
cause
of
the
most
concern
with
regard
to
school
admission
.
give
the
stage
we
be
at
in
term
of
we
republic
and
we
democracy
,
it
be
utterly
unacceptable
that
parent
feel
they
have
no
choice
other
than
to
baptise
they
child
in
order
that
they
can
get
into
the
local
State
-
fund
school
.
by
any
yardstick
,
the
minister
be
preside
over
deep
discrimination
on
the
part
of
State
-
fund
school
towards
child
who
do
not
share
the
majority
faith
of
the
majority
of
school
in
the
State
.
he
cannot
stand
over
the
continuation
of
that
situation
.
the
minister
suggest
that
the
issue
of
the
baptism
barrier
will
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
a
Labour
Party
Bill
that
be
consider
in
this
House
some
time
ago
.
that
will
not
happen
.
it
be
not
possible
to
deal
with
this
issue
in
the
context
of
the
flawed
legislation
in
question
,
which
would
emb
a
discriminatory
regime
if
it
be
agree
in
this
House
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
stop
put
this
live
real
issue
,
which
be
affect
many
family
in
this
country
,
on
the
long
finger
and
to
stop
make
excuse
to
put
it
off
.
it
be
wrong
and
can
not
be
defend
.
how
can
four
year
old
be
deny
access
to
they
local
school
solely
on
the
grounds
of
religion
because
they
be
not
baptise
?
the
government
should
not
allow
this
discriminatory
situation
to
continue
.
one
of
the
excuse
we
have
hear
have
involve
question
whether
it
be
possible
to
amend
the
equal
Status
Act
2000
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
we
should
deal
with
this
area
of
discrimination
by
abolish
section
7
(
3
)
(
c
)
of
that
act
.
as
I
argue
in
this
House
last
year
,
I
strongly
believe
it
would
be
quite
constitutional
to
take
such
action
.
the
constitution
be
balance
.
we
have
to
balance
the
public
good
against
any
particular
protection
there
be
for
religion
.
I
be
not
go
to
go
into
all
the
detail
of
the
various
section
of
the
constitution
.
I
do
that
when
I
speak
on
this
issue
last
year
.
I
would
like
to
mention
some
of
the
various
organisation
work
in
this
area
.
equate
Ireland
have
produce
a
compelling
legal
opinion
from
three
senior
counsel
advise
that
it
be
possible
to
address
this
issue
without
amend
the
constitution
.
equally
,
the
Education
Equality
group
have
come
forward
with
suggest
amendment
that
it
believe
to
be
entirely
constitutional
.
while
I
do
not
intend
to
oppose
this
legislation
on
second
stage
,
I
appeal
strongly
to
the
Minister
and
Fianna
Fáil
to
give
a
commitment
to
take
a
serious
look
at
this
issue
when
this
legislation
be
consider
on
committee
stage
.
the
social
Democrat
will
be
tab
amendment
to
the
Bill
.
I
be
sure
other
party
will
do
likewise
.
in
the
interest
of
fairness
and
openness
,
and
for
the
sake
of
respect
many
family
in
this
country
who
feel
they
be
be
seriously
discriminate
against
in
term
of
the
option
that
be
open
to
they
for
they
child
's
schooling
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
rethink
he
position
on
this
matter
and
to
consider
the
argument
that
will
be
make
on
committee
stage
.
this
argument
be
not
just
be
make
by
member
of
this
House
or
by
parent
who
be
affect
by
this
problem
.
I
will
return
to
this
point
when
I
complete
my
contribution
tomorrow
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Bill
.
I
have
to
say
that
in
general
term
,
it
have
to
be
welcome
in
as
far
as
it
go
.
obviously
,
it
be
welcome
that
more
specific
provision
be
be
make
regard
the
admission
of
people
with
special
need
to
school
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
a
great
level
of
transparency
be
be
provide
in
relation
to
admission
policy
.
in
the
past
,
it
be
often
a
very
secretive
process
.
Parent

agus
go
háirithe
díobh
siúd
a
bhí
páirteach
sa
díospóireacht
.
I
move
:
that
leave
be
grant
to
introduce
a
Bill
entitle
Bill
a
act
to
prohibit
the
manufacture
,
sale
and
import
of
any
cosmetic
product
contain
micro-plastic
as
a
raw
material
,
and
to
provide
for
related
matter
.
I
will
put
the
House
back
on
track
timewise
.
I
will
finish
well
within
five
minute
.
I
seek
leave
to
introduce
the
Bill
.
it
be
introduce
by
the
Green
Party
and
roundly
reject
by
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
in
the
Seanad
last
week
.
the
argument
relate
to
the
transparency
directive
and
,
in
particular
,
in
respect
of
the
article
relate
to
the
free
movement
of
goods
and
service
on
which
the
Bill
be
reject
be
spurious
.
however
,
article
36
provide
the
protection
of
human
health
and
flora
and
fauna
and
protection
of
marine
life
.
we
believe
strongly
that
there
be
a
precedent
in
respect
of
this
type
of
legislation
.
when
the
smoking
ban
be
introduce
by
former
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
there
be
a
notification
period
of
three
month
but
it
do
not
prevent
the
legislation
from
go
through
the
House
.
it
get
fair
wind
and
a
fair
passage
.
this
legislation
be
similar
in
so
far
as
everybody
in
the
House
have
state
that
they
support
it
.
Fianna
Fáil
,
as
I
understand
it
,
be
on
record
as
say
that
it
would
introduce
its
own
Bill
because
it
feel
the
Green
Party
Bill
be
not
strident
enough
in
respect
of
the
penalty
it
propose
.
we
be
happy
to
have
this
Bill
amend
in
any
way
if
Fianna
Fáil
feel
strongly
enough
that
the
measure
we
propose
be
not
strident
enough
in
respect
of
the
banning
of
micro-plastic
.
we
also
feel
strongly
that
there
be
not
a
sufficient
momentum
on
the
part
of
the
European
Commission
to
legislate
in
this
area
.
give
the
important
role
of
member
state
,
it
be
appropriate
that
they
should
in
they
own
right
introduce
public
health
measure
that
they
deem
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
.
I
hope
there
will
be
cross
-party
support
for
this
.
this
be
a
opportune
Bill
because
it
seek
to
address
the
issue
raise
by
the
minister
for
Housing
,
Planning
,
Community
and
local
government
in
response
to
the
Green
Party
and
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
in
the
Seanad
last
week
.
it
be
opportune
without
be
opportunistic
.
I
move
:
"
that
the
Bill
be
take
in
private
Member
's
time
.
"
I
will
shortly
quote
a
article
write
by
Michael
Clifford
some
month
ago
when
he
describe
Mr.
Barry
.
I
can
relate
to
deputy
Martin
when
he
speak
about
the
use
of
"
mister
"
in
Mr.
Barry
.
I
do
not
know
he
personally
but
to
all
of
we
who
know
of
Mr.
Barry
,
he
be
hold
in
such
high
respect
.
Mr.
Clifford
use
the
follow
apposite
word
:
"
for
many
who
encounter
he
,
he
be
just
a
decent
man
who
do
he
good
to
make
a

and

I
wish
to
share

with
deputy
Moran
.
I
be
happy
to
code
to
the
great
man
,
Moses
himself
,
who
hold
back
the
River

this
time
last

thankfully
,
the

on

this

because
I
be
not

could
have

in

.
I
be
happy
to
code
time
to
Moses
Moran
.
I
wish
to
refer
specifically
to
the
issue
of
flood
insurance
and
the
memorandum
of
understanding
sign
in
March
2014
between
the
chief
executive
officer
of
Insurance
Ireland
and
the
then
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
Mr.
Brian
Hayes
,
mep
.
I
hail
from
Mallow
in
north
Cork
and
,
to
be
fair
to
the
OPW
,
the
programme
of
work
commence
some
year
ago
in
the
town
of
Mallow
and
Fermoy
have
yield
benefit
and
success
through
the
intervention
of
a
number
of
minister
of
State
.
I
do
not
seek
to
be
overtly
partisan
on
this
because
good
work
have
be
carry
out
down
through
the
year
,
which
have
alleviate
the
flooding
problem
.
however
,
it
have
not
alleviate
the
issue
face
by
people
who
live
on
the
flood
plain
and
they
ability
to
obtain
flood
insurance
.
the
press
release
issue
in
2014
regard
the
memorandum
of
understanding
state
:
the
Memorandum
of
Understanding
outline
the
principle
of
agreement
between
the
OPW
and
Insurance
Ireland
on
the
information
be
provide
and
how
it
will
be
use
by
the
insurance
industry
.
the
Office
of
Public
Works
will
provide
Insurance
Ireland
with
datum
on
all
complete
OPW
flood
defence
scheme
which
will
show
the
design
,
extent
and
nature
of
the
protection
offer
by
this
work
.
insurance
Ireland
member
will
then
take
into
account
all
information
provide
by
the
OPW
when
assess
exposure
to
flood
risk
within
this
area
from
1
June
2014
.
we
be
into
December
2016
and
somewhere
along
the
line
a
election
happen
and
since
the
election
,
that
memorandum
of
understanding
seem
to
carry
no
weight
at
all
.
I
see
my
constituency
colleague
deputy
O'Keeffe
be
here
and
he
will
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
there
be
people
within
the
curtilage
of
the
Munster
Blackwater
in
town
and
hamlet
along
that
river
who
be
be
refuse
flood
insurance
,
whether
business
or
domestic
.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
be
world
-
class
engineering
work
sign
off
,
the
insurance
company
be
point
-
blank
refuse
to
provide
the
risk
cover
for
business
and
resident
along
that
river
.
the
memorandum
of
understanding
seem
to
have
fall
by
the
wayside
and
do
not
have
the
weight
that
be
give
to
it
prior
to
this
election
or
as
far
back
as
2014
.
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
be
commit
to
this
issue
and
I
hope
he
will
revisit
that
memorandum
of
understanding
and
re-engage
with
Insurance
Ireland
with
a
view
to
ensure
we
find
solution
.
deputy
Rabbitte
say
it
be
a
question
of
find
solution
to
this
problem
in
a
apolitical
non-partisan
way
.
in
that
press
release
the
chief
executive
of
Insurance
Ireland
say
:
"
insurance
Ireland
be
pleased
to
announce
the
signing
of
a
memorandum
of
Understanding
(
MoU
)
with
the
Office
of
Public
Works
(
OPW
)
which
will
see
the
OPW
share
flood
defence
datum
with
Insurance
Ireland
so
that
insurance
company
can
take
this
datum
into
account
when
assess
flood
risk
.
"
the
sector
clearly
have
not
take
the
two
significant
project
in
Fermoy
and
Mallow
into
account
when
assess
flood
risk
.
the
big
international
insurance
company
in
place
such
as
Geneva
,
Bonn
or
Berlin
that
speak
through
Insurance
Ireland
have
decide
they
do
not
want
to
do
it
.
they
have
make
a
simple
corporate
decision
.
it
be
for
we
in
this
house
work
together
to
ensure
that
memorandum
of
understanding
get
the
status
it
deserve
and
that
we
try
to
work
with
Insurance
Ireland
.
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
that
will
come
before
the
finance
committee
,
we
should
bring
Insurance
Ireland
back
into
the
Oireachtas
to
find
some
resolution
of
this
issue
.
the
press
release
also
state
"
this
mou
be
the
start
of
a
process
which
will
help
we
member
[
this
be
Insurance
Ireland
]
make
flood
insurance
more
widely
available
in
area
benefit
from
flood
defence
build
to
the
desire
standard
of
1:100
year
.
"
it
have
throw
that
out
the
window
and
renege
on
its
own
public
utterance
about
provide
cover
.
it
be
a
absolute
disgrace
and
it
need
to
be
take
to
task
collectively
by
this
House
for
dereliction
of
duty
.
there
be
genuine
broker
and
insurance
house
which
will
provide
cover
in
bespoke
circumstance
but
it
be
unfair
of
anybody
in
the
industry
to
expect
a
few
player
to
cover
the
entire
risk
.
that
be
why
we
have
more
work
to
do
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Canney
,
will
do
everything
he
can
on
this
but
this
Bill
be
a
prism
through
which
we
can
work
together
to
provide
a
resolution
.

distribute
copy
of

speech
?
thank
you
very
much
.
the
Labour
Party
's
support
for
this
legislation
be
conditional
on
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
be
take
seriously
and
the
role
of
ComReg
not
be
excise
into
the
future
to
that
of
a
regulatory
body
oversee
its
obligation
under
section
12
of
the
2002
Act
.
I
take
some
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
in
regard
to
the
recommendation
inherent
in
the
Kerr
report
.
if
one
have
regard
to
ComReg
's
postal
strategy
statement
2015
-
2017
,
there
be
a
statutory
remit
to
ensure
the
provision
of
a
affordable
universal
postal
service
that
meet
the
need
of
all
postal
service
user
.
there
be
legitimate
doubt
as
to
whether
this
legislation
,
as
propose
,
will
compromise
affordability
for
consumer
.
it
be
clear
to
anybody
that
the
proposal
in
this
legislation
in
term
of
the
increase
in
postage
charge
will
compromise
the
affordability
element
inherent
within
ComReg
's
remit
.
ComReg
have
limit
statutory
power
to
regulate
a
post
postal
service
that
be
not
universal
postal
service
.
we
know
from
ComReg
that
letter
volume
have
fall
by
32
%
since
2007
and
that
a
Post
be
forecasting
a
further
decline
of
approximately
4
%
per
annum
in
this
regard
.
as
the
universal
postal
service
provider
,
a
Post
be
the
market
leader
in
the
delivery
of
letter
and
it
must
take
the
necessary
step
to
address
this
decline
and
ensure
the
continuation
of
the
universal
postal
service
.
I
welcome
the
review
commence
by
the
company
.
we
be
all
agree
that
strategic
change
and
restructuring
must
be
real
and
that
there
must
be
definitive
timeline
on
that
action
.
if
a
Post
have
full
commercial
freedom
to
ensure
that
its
other
postal
service
be
viable
financially
then
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
it
have
achieve
this
historically
.
the
answer
be
that
clearly
it
have
not
do
so
.
if
it
have
,
we
would
not
be
here
now
.
that
place
a
significant
burden
on
the
Member
of
this
House
who
be
genuinely
try
to
ensure
a
future
for
a
Post
but
who
be
also
try
to
protect
consumer
against
undue
and
unfair
price
increase
.
there
be
something
of
a
Hobson
's
choice
.
the
2011
act
be
clear
in
respect
of
a
Post
's
obligation
to
the
universal
postal
service
and
compliance
with
price
affordability
,
as
I
have
say
.
a
post
must
comply
with
the
price
cap
.
it
be
very
tempting
to
ensure
such
a
regime
be
not
undermine
or
change
so
as
to
protect
consumer
and
speak
to
the
public
interest
.
price
increase
lead
to
flow
towards
electronic
means
of
communication
.
this
be
well
document
.
the
price
elasticity
affect
the
cost
of
postage
be
negative
,
as
we
know
.
where
one
keep
increase
the
price
,
one
reduce
the
demand
,
and
the
consequent
revenue
loss
put
a
post
in
a
even
more
precarious
position
.
the
price
cap
mechanism
employ
by
ComReg
be
arguably
a
protection
in
more
way
than
one
.
it
regulate
price
and
,
in
do
so
,
ensure
volume
be
theoretically
maintain
to
keep
a
post
viable
.
the
technical
challenge
face
by
a
Post
in
this
electronic
age
be
well
document
.
the
availability
of
electronic
substitute
have
result
in
diminish
mail
volume
,
thereby
affect
revenue
stream
.
corporate
behaviour
be
change
and
entity
such
as
bank
of
Ireland
be
increasingly
move
they
communication
with
client
to
a
online
format
.
social
welfare
contract
constitute
another
case
in
point
.
Public
finance
pressure
be
also
influence
behaviour
in
respect
of
funding
deficit
in
the
postal
sector
right
across
the
European
Union
.
the
recent
Kerr
report
and
post
office
network
business
development
group
recognise
the
worth
of
the
post
office
network
.
the
report
make
23
recommendation
.
one
must
ask
again
why
they
have
yet
to
be
implement
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
group
be
establish
on
foot
of
the
recommendation
of
a
cabinet
committee
on
social
policy
.
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
also
form
part
of
the
2016
programme
for
government
.
the
chairman
of
a
Post
address
the
Dáil
committee
last
July
.
he
speak
about
the
very
precarious
financial
position
of
a
Post
.
he
reiterate
that
in
the
past
24
hour
in
regard
to
the
universal
service
obligation
.
let
I
refer
to
the
2015
annual
report
of
a
Post
.
the
opinion
be
articulate
through
we
own
research
entity
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
report
state
mail
account
for
63.7
%
of
revenue
and
that
the
extent
of
the
decline
be
articulate
through
loss
of
over
€
340
million
.
it
be
state
that
,
of
the
580
million
item
handle
by
a
Post
in
2015
,
60
%
related
to
USO
product
while
letter
account
for
90
%
of
domestic
uso
volume
and
74
%
of
international
outbound
uso
volume
.
therefore
,
bear
in
mind
the
ComReg
report
,
to
which
I
have
refer
,
we
know
that
the
deteriorate
liquidity
of
a
Post
be
a
matter
of
grave
concern
.
the
amount
of
cash
in
hand
and
in
the
bank
fall
from
€350
million
to
€
50
million
between
2008
and
2015
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
be
sure
the
figure
have
diminish
even
further
.
ComReg
tell
we
that
80
%
of
postal
transaction
be
business
-
related
and
that
30
large
postal
service
user
,
include
bank
,
utility
and
government
,
account
for
the
vast
majority
of
mail
send
.
I
refer
to
Bank
of
Ireland
as
a
example
of
just
how
much
mail
have
reduce
in
such
a
short
period
.
if
volume
have
reduce
and
if
the
current
cap
be
change
or
go
,
there
will
be
a
serious
danger
of
rise
cost
for
customer
and
sme
,
in
particular
.
in
this
scenario
,
price
increase
will
result
in
a
further
decline
in
revenue
,
precipitate
the
demise
of
a
Post
over
a
long
period
.
if
we
do
not
arrest
this
decline
now
,
we
will
do
a
disservice
to
present
and
future
postal
service
user
because
the
service
will
not
exist
in
large
swathe
of
the
country
.
throughout
the
European
Union
,
there
be
example
of
where
the
universal
service
obligation
have
diminish
to
a
unsustainable
level
.
Monday
to

letter
be
deliver
but
package
and
parcel
have
to
be
collect
.
it
do
not
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
that
if
a
Post
's
cash
reserve
be
in
such
a
perilous
state
,
something
will
have
to
give
.
it
be
not
beyond
the
bound
of
possibility
to
envisage
a
time
when
the
Monday
-
to
-
Friday
delivery
as
we
know
it
may
become
a
thing
of
the
past
.
there
be
a
provision
in
EU
legislation
that
could
be
helpful
to
a
Post
.
it
refer
to
service
of
general
economic
interest
-
I
be
state
this
specifically
because
I
hope
the
minister
and
he
official
will
take
on
board
this
concept
,
which
be
real
-
or
economic
activity
that
allow
public
authority
,
namely
,
the
Irish
government
,
to
identify
as
be
of
particular
interest
or
importance
to
citizen
and
that
would
not
be
supply
if
there
be
no
public
intervention
.
example
be
transport
network
,
postal
service
and
social
service
.
in
practice
,
this
could
mean
that
the
government
could
specify
that
a
particular
service
be
provide
through
the
post
office
in
a
manner
that
be
require
by
citizen
and
argue
that
no
private
supplier
could
do
the
same
.
in
other
word
,
the
government
could
utilise
the
EU
provision
in
regard
to
service
of
general
economic
interest
to
channel
certain
government
service
through
the
post
office
,
thus
increase
footfall
and
revenue
to
the
post
office
.
opportunity
to
do
this
in
the
past
have
not
be
take
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
post
office
network
.
the
government
,
if
it
be
genuine
in
its
commitment
to
the
future
of
the
post
office
network
,
must
utilise
all
such
future
opportunity
to
use
the
service
of
general
economic
interest
.
if
one
marry
this
element
to
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
,
one
note
that
there
be
complementarity
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
mechanism
of
service
of
general
economic
interest
cannot
be
utilise
or
mobilise
in
this
instance
,
perhaps
the
minister
could
make
it
clear
in
he
response
,
or
at
some
other
stage
.
we
firmly
believe
,
however
,
it
be
a
mechanism
that
can
be
use
.
it
have
be
use
by
other
country
,
specifically
with
regard
to
postal
service
to
ensure
they
protection
.
there
be
a
stark
choice
for
this
House
to
make
.
we
note
the
concern
of
postmaster
and
Age
action
.
the
cash
reserve
of
a
Post
be
so
precarious
at
this
point
that
this
action
be
necessary
.
it
be
the
less
of
two
evil
.
I
do
not
believe
we
can
wait
for
a
review
of
a
Post
's
own
financial
position
to
take
place
and
for
a
report
to
be
issue
thereon
with
a
set
of
recommendation
.
we
be
up
against
the
clock
on
this
one
.
I
fear
that
if
we
do
not
support
this
legislation
,
the
cash
reserve
be
such
that
wage
will
not
be
pay
and
post
office
will
have
to
be
close
.
I
do
not
want
to
exaggerate
or
sound
alarmist
base
on
the
briefing
I
have
receive
on
this
issue
.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
I
to
state
that
we
have
to
protect
consumer
and
ensure
that
there
be
no
further
increase
in
the
cost
of
postage
stamp
.
however
,
most
deputy
be
of
the
view
that
,
if
it
be
a
choice
between
that
and
protect
worker
,
the
network
and
the
universal
service
obligation
,
USO
,
as
well
as
ensure
the
hundred
of
post
office
around
the
country
stay
open
,
and
notwithstand
the
attitudinal
issue
in
respect
of
rural
area
,
it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
maintain
the
infrastructure
and
not
risk
the
demise
of
the
service
as
we
know
it
.
if
that
mean
support
this
legislation
,
then
we
will
support
it
.
we
also
support
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
minister
will
be
proactive
in
term
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Kerr
report
,
will
explore
genuinely
further
cost
reduction
and
will
make
a
genuine
attempt
to
engage
on
the
matter
of
service
of
general
economic
interest
.
we
should
ensure
cash
reserve
be
bolster
in
order
that
everyone
can
continue
to
enjoy
,
if
I
may
use
that
word
,
or
use
the
service
and
there
be
no
risk
of
a
immediate
closure
of
certain
of
its
element
.
I
take
the
opportunity
to
wish
the
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
well
in
he
recovery
.
we
wish
he
a
speedy
return
to
the
workplace
.

do

how

the

when

the

evaluate

nothing
in
what
be
be
ask

be

to
we
mind
.
there
be
a
decision
of
a
Bord
Pleanála
but
there
be
precedent
for
take
on

independent
advice
,
specifically
the
Grid
Link
project
which
be
a
report
for
the
independent
expert
panel
of
September
2015
.
this
look
at
the
Grid
Link
project
,
a
dogleg
project
link
Cork
,
Wexford
and
Kildare
,
and
make
a
recommendation
to
use
the
regional
option
.
with
series
compensation
,
a
process
of
use
smartgrid
technology
to
allow
more
power
to
flow
through
exist
line
,
it
eliminate
the
need
for
significant
new
transmission
circuit
,
mean
no
new
infrastructure
be
need
.
this
be
a
different
project
and
there
be
pre-exist
infrastructure
but
there
be
a
report
of
a
independent
expert
panel
which
look
at
the
option
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
no
new
infrastructure
be
need
on
Grid
Link
to
manage
the
400
kV
potential
that
be
come
down
the
line
.
if
new
information
come
before
we
and
new
technology
,
as
well
as
precedent
in
other
part
of
the
European
Union
,
we
should
take
they
on
board
if
we
can
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
Fianna
Fáil
motion
that
would
damage
the
long
-
term
potential
of
a
North
-
South
interconnector
.
I
note
the
correspondence
from
a
number
of
business
organisation
in
the
North
of
Ireland
such
as
the
Institute
of
director
,
Manufacturing
Northern
Ireland
,
the
Derry
Chamber
of
Commerce
and
other
who
be
seek
to
remove
the
constraint
in
the
current
market
and
be
seek
the
delivery
of
the
interconnector
because
it
will
place
downward
pressure
on
consumer
bill
.
I
be
quote
directly
from
they
correspondence
.
we
all
agree
on
the
need
for
a
great
degree
of
interoperability
between
North
and
South
across
so
many
different
sector
,
include
electricity
.
there
be
time
,
however
,
when
there
may
be
a
need
to
revise
one
's
opinion
on
issue
when
they
arise
.
if
it
be
have
such
a
impact
,
then
the
community
's
concern
,
as
articulate
by
the
vast
bulk
of
its
representative
,
should
be
hear
.
that
be
why
we
be
support
the
motion
.
I
want
to
refer
specifically
to
the
what
the
minister
say
.
he
indicate
that
there
be
a
report
from
he
chief
technical
adviser
.
it
would
be
appropriate
if
that
advice
be
publish
.
if
he
be
willing
to
place
the
chief
technical
adviser
's
advice
on
the
record
,
it
would
be
pertinent
for
this
House
to
have
sight
of
it
.
this
would
not
do
any
harm
and
it
would
inform
the
House
as
to
the
type
of
advice
the
minister
be
receive
.
I
respectfully
take
issue
with
the
use
of
Brexit
as
a
argument
against
support
the
motion
.
we
all
understand
the
complexity
of
Brexit
as
they
relate
to
the
UK
White
Paper
and
the
letter
issue
by
the
British
Prime
Minister
,
Theresa
May
,
assert
continue
support
for
the
single
electricity
market
.
we
all
understand
that
dynamic
,
but
if
one
of
the
signatory
to
that
market
be
no
long
a
member
of
the
European
Union
,
it
put
a
hole
in
the
minister
's
argument
.
we
must
now
question
the
status
of
the
project
of
common
interest
.
even
though
this
plan
clearly
state
that
energy
project
be
deem
by
the
European
Commission
to
be
of
strategic
cross-border
importance
,
we
must
question
what
the
status
of
that
project
of
common
interest
be
in
the
light
of
the
departure
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
from
the
European
Union
,
notwithstand
we
own
position
of
ensure
that
North
-
South
interconnectedness
should
continue
to
be
embed
in
every
way
,
both
societally
and
economically
.
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
minister
that
use
the
Brexit
argument
as
a
mechanism
to
support
he
position
will
not
cut
the
mustard
for
people
live
in
this
region
.
I
ask
he
to
consider
the
Fianna
Fáil
motion
which
we
be
support
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
16
February
2017
.
we
support
the
Bill
.
I
be
take
the
middle
ground
on
this
one
because
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
have
be
quite
generous
in
that
he
seek
to
consult
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
,
particularly
around
the
area
of
the
social
clause
.
when
one
look
at
section
4
of
the
Bill
,
there
be
legitimate
question
as
to
how
one
would
define
a
social
clause
and
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
's
critique
of
section
4
in
regard
to
the
community
benefit
.
I
have
a
question
as
to
whether
one
can
define
a
social
clause
in
a
legally
definitive
way
.
I
look
at
community
benefit
from
the
point
of
view
of
small
local
contract
.
take
the
Scottish
example
,
a
route
1
example
be
of
relatively
low
value
,
low
risk
and
non-repetitive
while
a
route
2
example
be
between
£
50000
and
the
EU
upper
tier
.
it
be
important
that
if
one
can
define
or
create
a
atmosphere
that
ensure
that
where
a
entity
be
go
to
tender
for
a
project
,
where
possible
,
it
would
seek
to
meet
the
need
of
the
community
benefit
requirement
around
training
and
recruitment
,
the
availability
of
subcontracting
opportunity
,
the
facilitation
of
involvement
of
sme
and
the
promotion
of
innovation
and
youth
unemployment
.
I
understand
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
when
he
ask
how
prescriptive
we
be
go
to
be
and
if
we
be
to
bring
it
down
to
a
geographical
area
,
use
the
example
of
Dublin
3
.
be
there
a
compromise
somewhere
in
between
that
allow
we
to
have
robust
legislation
that
stand
up
to
scrutiny
down
the
line
,
speak
to
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
I
speak
of
and
ensure
that
as
many
local
people
as
possible
can
bid
for
local
contract
,
thereby
maintain
regional
,
local
economic
growth
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
specifically
to
the
devolve
grant
scheme
.
I
contend
that
the
devolve
grant
scheme
as
it
relate
to
the
school
building
programme
be
largely
a
good
scheme
,
and
we
oversee
that
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
government
,
where
we
give
either
educational
and
training
board
,
etb
,
or
individual
school
a
degree
of
autonomy
over
building
project
.
however
,
in
one
instance
,
I
witness
a
scenario
where
small
subcontractor
under
that
scheme
be
leave
high
and
dry
have
complete
work
,
and
they
have
no
recourse
to
law
or
to
the
originator
of
the
scheme
,
that
be
,
the
school
board
,
and
this
represent
a
serious
flaw
in
that
scheme
.
I
can
see
the
merit
of
use
the
devolve
school
programme
as
a
pilot
project
administer
by
the
National
Development
Finance
Agency
.
the
project
be
worth
approximately
€
70
million
in
total
,
but
throw
up
some
exception
around
subcontractor
which
be
stiff
when
it
come
to
get
pay
for
work
that
they
have
carry
out
and
very
good
legitimate
company
in
that
context
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
offer
a
degree
of
consultation
and
he
have
say
that
a
copy
of
the
Bill
have
be
forward
to
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
with
a
request
for
view
on
the
text
to
see
if
it
comply
with
EU
directive
and
treaty
principle
.
that
be
worthwhile
and
we
would
agree
with
it
.
I
hope
that
consultation
could
be
widen
if
possible
.
I
commend
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
public
engagement
on
the
issue
of
public
procurement
.
he
have
travel
throughout
the
county
to
engage
with
business
and
the
SME
sector
.
I
believe
he
to
be
genuine
in
that
endeavour
.
I
hope
the
feedback
from
that
community
will
find
its
way
into
a
framework
that
ensure
the
local
business
that
sustain
we
community
,
include
intergenerational
family
-
own
business
which
be
compete
on
this
tender
,
will
feel
they
have
a
shot
at
tender
for
public
service
and
do
not
feel
sideline
because
they
be
not
operate
at
the
right
type
of
economy
of
scale
or
they
do
not
have
the
right
kind
of
in
-
house
tendering
capacity
.
we
need
to
ensure
they
do
not
have
to
expend
too
much
of
they
resource
when
it
come
to
tender
particularly
for
small
project
within
the
overall
procurement
offering
.
perhaps
when
the
Bill
go
to
its
next
stage
the
Minister
of
State
will
provide
a
critique
or
give
we
he
opinion
on
the
Scottish
model
of
procurement
,
which
be
reference
by
deputy
Dara
Calleary
.
it
have
three
particular
route
.
it
have
gain
momentum
and
be
use
as
a
example
.
obviously
,
Ireland
be
a
similar
country
and
perhaps
it
could
be
use
as
a
potential
model
.
I
will
leave
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
in
due
course
.
I
be
hopeful
the
Minister
of
State
might
come
back
to
we
on
whether
it
be
possible
to
provide
a
robust
legal
definition
of
social
clause
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
already
critique
section
4
of
the
Bill
.
there
be
nothing
in
section
4
that
be
objectionable
in
try
to
get
the
good
of
the
procurement
process
back
into
the
community
that
we
serve
.
if
the
Bill
intend
to
improve
the
economic
,
social
and
environmental
well
-
being
of
community
,
it
be
not
bad
.
I
be
sure
there
can
be
a
meeting
of
mind
and
compromise
on
the
legislation
.
we
support
the
legislation
and
look
forward
to
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
finance
,
Public
expenditure
and
Reform
,
pursuant
to
standing
order

we
should
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
official
in
consolidate
this
legislation
.
it
be
legislation
that
go
back
to
the
1940s
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
it
be
no
easy
task
to
do
such
a
thing
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
work
the
official
have
do
on
this
.
I
will
be
very
brief
.
we
be
support
the
Bill
.
I
will
add
my
name
to
the
list
of
people
who
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
dolomite
and
dolomitic
limestone
.
I
have
a
submission
and
I
be
sure
other
member
have
the
same
submission
on
the
interpretation
of
mineral
.
the
Minister
of
State
deal
with
this
in
the
Seanad
.
there
be
a
definition
of
mineral
which
attempt
to
provide
clarity
on
where
limestone
end
and
where
dolomitic
limestone
start
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
give
some
indication
that
he
will
deal
with
this
on
Committee
stage
.
I
will
read
a
extract
from
correspondence
I
receive
:
section
2
Interpretation
"
Minerals
"
attempt
to
provide
clarity
on
the
definition
of
where
limestone
end
and
dolomitic
limestone
start

(

)
dolomitic
limestone
that
occur
in
association
with
dolomite
in
a
deposit
where
dolomite
be
less
than
85
per
cent
of
the
deposit
;
''
my
correspondent
state
there
be
a
difficulty
with
this
implementation
:
the
implementation
of
what
be
dolomitic
Limestone
and
what
be
limestone
be
subjective
.
inconsistent
implementation
under
the
current
mineral
act
have
be
very
subjective
where
large
scale
multi
National
company
have
exploit
deposit
of
dolomitic
limestone
...
this
section
have
the
potential
for
distortion
of
the
market
where
one
deposit
be
consider
limestone
and
another
dolomitic
Limestone
.
he
go
on
to
say
:
example
of
where
dolomite
product
compete
with
limestone
product
in
the
same
market
place
be
in
refractory
production
,
(
one
company
use
limestone
and
salt
water
in
the
production
of
high
end
refractory
for
furnace
without
contribute
any
royalty
,
yet
to
produce
similar
refractory
with
a
dolomitic
limestone
a
royalty
payment
would
be
compulsory
)
.
this
be
issue
that
be
familiar
to
the
official
.
they
be
familiar
to
the
minister
.
I
want
to
state
they
for
the
public
record
.
if
there
be
a
mechanism
to
deal
with
this
by
way
of
government
amendment
on
committee
stage
,
we
would
welcome
such
a
clarification
.
I
see
no
need
to
delay
proceedings
tonight
.
we
be
in
favour
of
the
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
official
and
if
the
issue
of
dolomite
and
dolomitic
extraction
be
deal
with
,
we
will
be
very
satisfied
.
or
at
some
further
date
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
he
latitude
.
the
question
that
arise
be
whether
a
pathway
can
be
provide
within
exist
legislation
.
we
need
a
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
be
the
case
that
a
medical
practitioner
can
apply
for
a
licence
to
administer
the
specific
medication
that
be
deem
to
be
require
in
this
case
.
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
the
family
in
question
-
the
Twomey
family
-
if
the
Taoiseach
could
clarify
the
position
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
innovation
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
141
.
the
issue
I
be
raise
concern
the
pend
case
against
Ireland
by
the
European
Commission
at
the
European
Court
of
Justice
in
regard
to
the
failure
by
the
State
,
between
2000
and
2005
,
to
meet
deadline
set
for
the
upgrading
of
exist
sewage
treatment
plant
and
completion
of
new
plant
.
that
failure
be
affect
38
town
throughout
the
country
,
include
Cork
city
,
Fermoy
,
Mallow
,
Midleton
,
Ballincollig
,

,
Youghal

and
Ballybofey

in
County
Tipperary
;
as
well
as
,
among
other
,
Kilkenny
,
Dundalk
,
Enniscorthy
and
Killarney
.
Ireland
have
until
the
end
of
2005
to
ensure
any
urban
area
with
a
population
base
of
more
than
15000
have
adequate
sewage
treatment
facility
to
prevent
discharge
from
that
medium
-
size
town
into
river
,
lake
and
estuary
.
it
be
a
public
health
issue
.
we
be
experience
some
turmoil
in
this
house
at
the
moment
on
the
issue
of
water
charge
.
in
that
context
,
I
be
concerned
there
may
not
be
enough
capital
funding
available
to
complete
sewage
and
wastewater
treatment
plant
upgrade
.
Irish
Water
have
estimate
that
all
sewage
treatment
plant
will
be
upgrade
by
2021
,
at
a
slate
cost
of
€
1.2
billion
.
in
the
current
climate
,
however
,
with
the
ongoing
debate
on
water
charge
,
it
seem
likely
there
may
be
slippage
on
that
target
.
will
the
minister
give
a
assurance
to
the
affect
town
that
they
will
have
access
to
reliable
,
adequate
and
safe
wastewater
and
sewage
treatment
plant
?
will
he
further
guarantee
there
will
be
no
slippage
in
the
budget
line
and
that
the
target
which
need
to
be
meet
by
2021
will
continue
to
be
meet
?
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
engage
with
I
on
this
issue
and
I
recognise
that
blame
be
lay
at
successive
government
's
door
.
we
have
not
tackle
this
issue
as
a
country
in
as
proactive
a
way
as
we
should
have
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
debate
on
the
future
of
water
and
wastewater
treatment
service
,
I
be
not
convinced
that
the
current
investment
plan
will
be
follow
through
and
that
the
government
can
guarantee
that
capital
expenditure
will
be
make
available
to
meet
the
need
of
the
remain
38
town
and
agglomeration
identify
by
the
European
Commission
.
we
must
ensure
that
the
capital
expenditure
be
lock
down
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
committee
's
deliberation
when
it
report
to
the
House
.
this
be
a
public
safety
issue
,
one
in
which
the
health
of
we
citizen
come
into
play
,
and
we
need
to
maintain
a
investment
plan
.
there
have
never
be
a
more
opportune
time
to
do
so
.
I
worry
that
water
and
wastewater
investment
will
slip
down
the
agenda
.
if
it
compete
with
,
for
example
,
capital
expenditure
on
road
,
school
or
hospital
,
all
of
which
be
necessary
,
it
will
become
the
poor
relation
even
though
it
be
most
vital
to
we
need
.
I
hope
that
we
can
continue
to
ensure
that
the
budget
of
€
1
billion
plus
for
the
investment
plan
be
lock
down
so
that
the
2021
target
can
be
achieve
and
the
need
of
the
38
town
and
agglomeration
will
be
cater
for
.
be
the
€
1
billion
secure
?
regardless
of
the
charging
regime
?
we
support
the
motion
.

the

because
,
although
it
announce
the
extension
of
the
insurance
compensation
fund

it
seem
the

be
now
say
a
legislative
proposal
to
implement

report
will
be
bring
to
government
for
approval
in

month
.
he
do
not
use
the
word
"
head
of

Bill
"
and
there
seem
to
be
some
slippage
already
in
the
timeline
for
legislation
to
provide
certainty
in
this
matter
.
the
finance
committee
have
do
much
work
to
tackle

issue
articulate
by

Neville

Ó
Laoghaire
on
the
particular
circumstance
in
which

find
themselves

particularly
that
who
have

out

by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
have
to
emigrate
and
be
now
return
home
.
we
require
certainty
to
plug
the
glaring
lacuna
in
the
legislation
around
this
matter
.
if
it
be
not
address
,
there
be
the
prospect
of
motorist
have
loading
cost
on
they
premium
of
up
to
€
80
.
the
MIBI
documentation
contain
estimate
that
the
cost
of
claim
for
they
member
,
against
uninsured
and
untraced
driver
,
be
north
of
€
58.4
million
.
the
MIBI
state
that
Setanta
pose
a
liability
of
€
90
million
,
the
impact
of
which
be
a
additional
€
52
.
the
Supreme
Court
have
to
iron
out
how
Irish
law
understand
the
responsibility
of
MIBI
.
other
member
have
refer
to
timeline
but
this
go
back
to
September
2015
and
the
first
high
court
judgment
.
the
late
instalment
be
the
October
2016
reserve
judgment
.
I
be
delighted
that
the
government
be
abstain
on
the
motion
because
there
be
agreement
on
the
broad
principle
of
the
motion
.
the
consumer
demand
be
very
clear
.
they
want
transparency
and
easily
accessible
information
on
the
product
they
be
purchase
.
they
also
want
to
know
,
in
a
simple
format
,
if
the
liquidity
and
provisioning
arrangement
for
that
insurance
house
,
from
which
they
be
purchase
product
,
be
robust
so
as
to
offset
the
risk
of
non-payment
of
claim
in
the
future
.
Consumer
quite
simply
demand
transparency
and
easily
accessible
information
,
which
be
something
that
will
have
to
be
deal
with
.
I
acknowledge
what
the

say
about
the
Central
Bank
conduct
a
thematic
review
and
inspection
of
manage
general
agent
or
mga
.
however
,
we
need
further
information
and
clarity
on
what
that
mean
.
while
we
support
the
motion
,
it
be
important
to
have
legal
certainty
on
the
Setanta
issue
and
other
insurance
house
.
motorist
with
legitimate
expectation
have
be
wait
too
long
for
justice
,
despite
have
judgment
in
they
favour
for
recognise
claim
.
with

Jim
O'Callaghan
and
the

,
I
fully
support
and
welcome
the
publication
and

of
the

when

to
note
that
it

what

the

the

this
be

we
only
get

as
it
be
unlikely
that

we
,
therefore
,
need
to
get

not

I

this
morning
at
a
meeting
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and

Ms
Maria
McDonald
speak
on
behalf
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
.
she
make
a
excellent
presentation
on
penal
reform
in
which
she
highlight
a
number
of
important
point
.
they
be
worth
note
.
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
be
very
positive
about
the
Bill
and
welcome
the
minister
's
work
in
that
regard
,
but
,
as
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
mention
,
there
be
question
about
restorative
justice
and
why
there
be
no
statutory
restorative
justice
scheme
in
place
.
the
strategic
review
of
penal
policy
acknowledge
that
the
directive
promote
the
appropriate
use
of
restorative
justice
service
.
this
be
in
line
with
the
delivery
of
such
service
in
the
State
.
the
directive
state
"
restorative
justice
"
mean
"
any
process
whereby
the
victim
and
the
offender
be
enable
,
if
they
freely
consent
,
to
participate
actively
in
the
resolution
of
matter
arise
from
the
criminal
offence
through
the
help
of
a
impartial
third
party
"
.
it
be
important
to
address
some
of
the
concern
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
.
while
it
welcome
the
centralising
of
the
victim
in
statutory
rights
,
it
be
concerned
that
restorative
justice
have
not
be
include
and
formalise
as
part
of
the
process
.
as
we
all
know
,
we
only
get
one
chance
in
the
short
to
medium
term
to
deal
with
legislation
to
transpose
a
directive
.
as
it
be
unlikely
that
we
will
revisit
this
option
properly
and
positively
in
the
year
to
come
,
we
,
therefore
,
need
to
get
this
right
and
ensure
we
do
not
dilute
the
potential
rights
of
victim
as
part
of
the
legislation
.
the
report
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
state
72
%
of
victim
feel
they
have
be
revictimise
by
the
criminal
justice
system
,
while
more
than
40
%
feel
they
have
be
revictimise
by
the
accuse
.
I
hope
the
legislation
and
the
work
that
will
flow
from
it
will
reduce
this
alarming
rate
to
ensure
the
victim
will
be
put
at
the
centre
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
context
of
other
balancing
rights
.
this
be
important
legislation
which
I
hope
we
and
the
minister
will
get
right
.
with
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
and
the
minister
,
I
fully
support
and
welcome
the
publication
and
transposition
of
the
directive
.
it
be
interesting
,
when
we
read
the
background
information
,
to
note
that
it
begin
in
the
early
noughty
in
the
European
Union
with
a
Council
framework
decision
and
that
it
have
take
a
lengthy
period
for
it
to
be
properly
transpose
,
formalise
and
put
on
a
statutory
footing
in
Irish
law
.
what
be
unfortunate
-
this
be
something
we
see
too
often
-
be
how
long
it
take
to
have
positive
idea
at
EU
level
properly
transpose
or
agree
to
at
member
state
level
.
it
be
welcome
that
Directive
2012
/
29
/
EU
be
be
transpose
.
to
make
a
broad
point
,
it
be
important
that
we
have
a
framework
place
on
a
statutory
basis
to
put
the
victim
of
a
crime
at
the
centre
of
Irish
law
.
we
all
know
and
have
meet
victim
of
crime
.
we
have
all
be
victim
of
various
criminal
offence
at
various
time
in
we
life
.
it
be
important
that
victim
of
crime
have
rights
and
be
able
to
contact
,
and
have
positive
interaction
with
,
the
various
statutory
agency
.
as
outline
,
the
fundamental
tenet
be
communication
and
that
review
of
decision
can
be
make
at
the
various
stage
of
the
process
.
the
recent
O'Higgin
report
detailed
serious
deficiency
in
how
victim
be
provide
with
information
.
this
uncertainty
for
victim
be
worry
and
have
a
significant
effect
on
they
and
they
family
.
it
be
important
,
as
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
state
,
that
the
agency
of
the
State
be
accountable
to
victim
and
that
they
provide
a
proper
mechanism
and
review
process
as
a
crime
investigation
be
progress
.

this
be
important
legislation
which
I
hope
we
and
the
minister
will
get

.
I
wish
to
speak
to
section
5
,
le
do
thoil
.
I
receive
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
I
have
propose
a
amendment
to
section
70
of
the
Health
Act
1970
and
I
will
refer
specifically
to
that
section
.
my
propose
amendment
related
to
screen
test
for
foetal
anomaly
.
the
original
wording
go
back
to
1970
be
that
"
a
health
board
shall
make
arrangement
for
carry
out
test
on
person
without
charge
,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertain
the
presence
of
a
particular
disease
,
defect
or
condition
that
may
be
prescribe
"
.
I
have
propose
a
amendment
to
that
which
state
that
"
without
prejudice
to
the
generality
of
section
70
,
arrangement
make
under
that
section
shall
include
arrangement
for
carry
out
without
charge
ultrasound
and
other
standardise
prenatal
foetal
diagnostic
test
,
to
accurately
date
the
pregnancy
and
to
assess
the
foetus
for
diagnosable
anomaly
or
defect
,
during
the
antenatal
period
"
.
I
be
very
surprised
to
receive
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
which
state
that
he
regret
to
inform
I
that
my
amendment
tab
at
this
stage
have
be
rule
out
of
order
as
it
involve
a
potential
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
all
I
seek
to
do
be
to
make
a
amendment
to
ensure
that
the
language
of
the
1970
Act
be
update
to
ensure
that
,
as
of
right
,
every
woman
will
have
access
to
the
foetal
anomaly
scan
in
pregnancy
and
to
make
sure
there
be
some
degree
of
universality
around
that
.
I
do
not
understand
why
that
be
deem
to
be
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
I
speak
very
briefly
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
about
this
today
and
I
be
hopeful
this
can
be
address
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
HSE
's
national
woman
and
infant
health
programme
and
the
issue
around
the
recruitment
of
ultrasonographer
in
the
State
.
I
refer
specifically
to
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
where
not
every
woman
have
access
to
that
vital
scan
.
if
we
be
talk
about
positive
outcome
for
baby
and
mother
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
have
this
scan
so
we
can
ensure
the
good
outcome
for
both
mother
and
child
.
I
fail
to
understand
how
my
amendment
could
be
deem
to
potentially
put
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
when
the
1970
Act
already
state
that
the
health
board
"
shall
make
arrangement
for
carry
out
test
on
person
without
charge
,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertain
the
presence
of
a
particular
disease
,
defect
or
condition
that
may
be
prescribe
"
.
I
be
hopeful
at
this
late
hour
,
even
though
the
amendment
be
tab
in
good
time
,
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
address
the
issue
and
,
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
,
ensure
that
woman
who
do
not
have
access
to
this
scan
at
present
will
have
access
to
they
and
that
there
will
be
adequate
resource
deploy
through
the
national
maternity
strategy
.
it
be
the
language
of
the
national
maternity
strategy
I
be
use
here
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
access
be
not
deny
to
woman
and
that
the
resource
be
deploy
.
I
take
some
solace
from
the
fact
that
,
with
the
restructuring
of
hospital
group
,
a
new
clinical
director
of
the
woman
and
child
service
directorate
for
the
South
/
South
West
hospital
group
be
appoint
on
27
February
2017
.
I
understand
a
order
have
be
make
under
section
16
of
the
Health
Act
subdelegate
certain
function
in
maternity
service
to
a
person
.
I
understand
that
that
function
have
be
delegate
be
a
positive
move
.
the
question
be
whether
that
delegate
function
will
result
in
a
budget
line
that
will
ensure
every
woman
in
the
region
I
serve
will
have
access
to
the
scan
.
we
cannot
have
a
situation
in
this
country
where
some
woman
be
deny
access
to
scan
by
dint
of
geography
.
we
know
what
the
import
of
this
scan
be
in
term
of
the
good
outcome
for
mother
and
baby
.
it
be
a
public
health
issue
and
I
be
hopeful
the
Minister
of
State
will
address
the
point
I
make
in
a
non-partisan
way
.
it
be
something
that
affect
all
of
we
.
it
be
a
positive
move
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
inclined
to
accept
my
amendment
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
inclined
to
address
the
issue
before
we
it
would
be
very
beneficial
to
the
woman
and
child
of
the
Munster
region
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
position
be
contradictory
.
I
tab
Parliamentary
question

254
on
2
February
.
effectively
,
I
ask
whether
all
pregnant
woman
in
Ireland
have
access
to
a
foetal
anomaly
scan
and
for
the
number
of
foetal
anomaly
scan
relative
to
actual
birth
for
every
individual
maternity
unit
in
the
State
for
the
year
2015
and
2016
in
tabular
form
.
I
will
cite
the
HSE
's
response
for
the
record
,
so
I
hope
the
departmental
official
and
the
minister
of
State
be
take
note
.
accord
to
the
response
,
foetal
anomaly
scanning
be
not
available
to
all
pregnant
woman
in
the
public
health
system
.
the
three
maternity
hospital
in
Dublin
and
the
unit
in
Galway
and
Waterford
provide
100
%
access
,
but
most
of
the
remain
unit
only
provide
some
access
to
scanning
,
usually
where
it
be
clinically
indicate
or
base
on
other
agree
criterion
.
in
the
context
of
the
1970
Act
,
every
woman
as
of
right
should
have
the
scan
available
to
she
regardless
of
whether
it
be
clinically
indicate
.
also
accord
to
the
response
,
the
NWIHP
do
not
currently
collect
the
information
that
I
have
request
.
we
do
not
even
have
proper
datum
on
the
number
of
scan
perform
in
Ireland
.
find
out
take
some
work
by
obgyn
and
consultant
across
the
State
.
figure
show
that
approximately
23000
woman
,
accounting
for
36
%
of
all
birth
each
year
,
be
not
able
to
access
publicly
fund
anomaly
scan
.
the
consultant
be
happy
to
share
this
datum
.
this
be
a
matter
of
record
within
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
through
the
health
committee
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
contradict
what
the
HSE
and
,
base
on
they
datum
analysis
,
the
consultant
be
tell
I
.
as
a
matter
of
urgency
,
we
must
reach
the
point
whereby
woman
in
the
region
in
question
-
particularly
in
Cork
,
but
not
just
there
-
have
access
to
this
scan
,
not
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
nwihp
,
but
now
.
I
would
like
the
Minister
of
State
to
reply
to
the
effect
that
the
government
,
of
which
he
be
a
part
,
will
do
its
utmost
to
ensure
that
a
process
be
put
in
place
to
recruit
sonographer
within
the
first
or
,
at
the
late
,
second
quarter
of
this
year
.
we
be
discuss
public
health
.
be
I
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
would
not
rely
on
the
Fine
Gael
Minister
for
a
answer
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
point
about
take
this
debate
,
but
I
be
sure
that
he
have
a
position
on
the
matter
as
a
member
of
the
government
through
the
independent
Alliance
.
he
have
a
responsibility
for
this
issue
as
well
,
if
I
may
put
it
so
bluntly
.
it
be
not
just
a
Fine
Gael
responsibility
.
I
feel
strongly
about
this
matter
.
if
we
be
to
be
equal
in
we
treatment
of
patient
,
every
woman
and
child
must
,
as
a
right
and
a
public
health
issue
,
have
access
to
this
scan
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be

to
the

on

it
be

.
if

a
clear
sense
of
how
this
matter
have
be
handle
to
date
within
the
Garda
Síochána
or
the
status
and
content
of
the
audit
which
have
be
undertake
.
the
Authority
consider
the
correspondence
receive
from
the
Garda
Commissioner
on
Friday
24
March
last
in
which
the
Commissioner
request
that
the
Authority
refer
a
number
of
matter
to
the
Garda
Inspectorate
.
what
I
be
try
to
get
at
be
the
reason
the
Policing
Authority
would
issue
a
statement
of
this
nature
.
one
can
only
surmise
,
and
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
to
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
that
the
government
do
not
have
enough
faith
in
the
Policing
Authority
due
to
its
not
engage
in
a
more
timely
fashion
with
the
Department
regard
the
modality
of
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
to
correct
I
then
.
whose
obligation
be
that
?
I
have
limited
time
.
this
speak
to
the
heart
of
the
culture
of
management
in
a
Garda
Síochána
.
again
,
there
be
a
inherent
weakness
in
this
regard
.
there
should
have
be
a
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
Garda
Síochána
,
surely
,
to
inform
the
Policing
Authority
in
a
timely
fashion
.
do
the
Tánaiste
agree
with
that
statement
?
this
be
very
serious
.
yes
,
but
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
-----
I
appreciate
that
.
we
can
no
long
keep
give
a
Garda
Síochána
mismanagement
political
cover
.
decision
must
be
take
as
to
how
the
force
be
manage
.
I
understand
the
predicament
in
which
the
Tánaiste
find
herself
,
but
we
need
to
hear
about
concrete
action
from
she
.
give
that
we
have
a
Garda
Inspectorate
,
a
Policing
Authority
and
a
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
when
can
we
expect
to
see
a
root
-
and
-
branch
change
,
and
why
do
a
external
service
need
to
do
this
when
we
have
two
state
entity
already
?
there
be
quite
a
number
of
quite
sensible
recommendation
in
the
Garda
inspectorate
report
.
we
should
now
see
the
implementation
of
this
and
a
political
willingness
to
do
so
.
that
be
the
message
we
need
to
hear
in
this
house
because
the
people
outside
this
wall
,
with
every
new
scandal
that
emerge
,
be
lose
faith
in
policing
in
this
country
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
I
refer
again
to
the
Tánaiste
's
statement
that
there
will
be
some
remedy
for
that
who
be
incorrectly
convict
.
I
wish
to
quote
directly
from
she
full
write
speech
again
.
it
state
,
"
letter
will
begin
issue
to
this
individual
on
3
April
.
"
it
also
state
,
"
all
of
this
case
will
be
appeal
by
a
Garda
Síochána
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
court
set
aside
this
conviction
,
all
fine
will
be
reimburse
and
penalty
remove
,
and
all
of
that
affect
will
be
contact
directly
by
a
Garda
Síochána
.
"
she
state
definitively
that
this
conviction
will
be
overturn
.
what
further
remedy
,
if
any
,
be
open
to
this
people
who
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
may
feel
as
if
they
good
name
be
tarnish
in
have
to
appear
before
judge
in
district
court
,
potentially
on
unsound
conviction
?
will
there
be
further
remedy
besides
the
issuing
of
the
letter
and
the
revocation
of
the
fine
so
that
that
affect
might
have
they
good
name
restore
?

today
mark
a
frustrating
day
for
Northern
Ireland
.
the
majority
of
people
there
vote
against
Brexit
,
and
at
lunchtime
today
a
letter
from
Theresa
May
will
be
present
to
Donald
Tusk
as
the
UK
activate
article
50
to
begin
the
process
of
leave
the
EU
.
we
face
the
prospect
of
a
hard
border
with
at
least
some
,
possibly
major
,
change
to
trade
on
we
island
,
and
even
large
disruption
to
we
all
-
island
link
but
Northern
Ireland
have
no
power
share
executive
to
advocate
on
its
own
behalf
.
a
week
ago
Martin
McGuinness
be
lay
to
rest
and
I
pass
my
condolence
to
the
family
of
Martin
.
I
sit
across
the
table
from
he
when
I
accompany
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
during
the
Fresh
start
negotiation
and
I
develop
a
great
respect
for
he
on
a
personal
level
.
I
be
always
strike
by
the
fact
that
he
be
as
comfortable
travel
the
world
,
market
Northern
Ireland
as
a
place
to
invest
,
as
he
be
back
home
in
he
native
Derry
.
I
offer
my
personal
condolence
to
the
Sinn
Féin
Party
and
to
Mrs.
McGuinness
and
they
family
,
as
well
as
the
people
of
Derry
because
he
be
of
Derry
and
that
give
he
a
humility
.
he
always
have
a
sense
of
where
he
come
from
and
whether
he
be
in
Washington
or
elsewhere
he
always
feel
the
draw
of
he
native
Derry
.
he
will
be
sadly
miss
by
people
across
this
island
.
many
of
the
principal
actor
from
the
peace
process
gather
in
Derry
-
people
who
put
year
into
secure
a
lasting
legacy
of
peace
for
Northern
Ireland
.
it
be
nearly
two
decade
on
since
the
good
Friday
agreement
but
,
once
again
,
the
formation
of
a
power
-
share
executive
be
hold
the
future
of
Northern
Ireland
back
.
there
be
no
desire
for
another
election
nor
do
we
want
to
see
direct
rule
impose
.
a
London
Administration
distract
by
Brexit
be
not
in
a
position
to
secure
fully
the
future
of
Northern
Ireland
.
some
of
the
same
issue
that
arise
during
the
previous
negotiation
on
the
Fresh
start
agreement
and
at
Stormont
be
still
on
the
table
now
.
I
refer
to
the
Irish
language
Act
,
fiscal
matter
,
the
bill
of
rights
and
legacy
issue
include
equality
generally
and
marriage
equality
in
particular
.
New
election
will
not
achieve
anything
.
there
be
now
a
window
up
to
Easter
to
reach
agreement
and
I
hope
that
opportunity
can
be
seize
.
on
Brexit
and
the
North
-
South
relationship
,
the
Labour
Party
support
the
call
for
a
bespoke
deal
for
Northern
Ireland
to
address
the
follow
issue
post
-
Brexit
:
the
strengthening
of
exist
all
-
island
institution
,
continue
cross-border
co-operation
,
guarantee
of
funding
for
Northern
Ireland
beyond
2020
,
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
200000
person
resident
on
the
island
who
be
neither
Irish
nor
British
citizen
and
the
need
for
parity
of
esteem
in
human
rights
protection
across
the
island
.
this
week
we
publish
a
comprehensive
paper
on
Brexit
with
20
key
action
we
call
on
the
government
to
take
.
four
of
that
action
relate
directly
to
Northern
Ireland
and
another
three
relate
to
the
common
travel
area
.
there
be
no
simple
solution
to
resolve
the
problem
the
island
will
face
when
the
UK
exit
the
European
Union
and
the
potentially
devastating
impact
it
will
have
on
Northern
Ireland
and
the
peace
process
.
we
support
the
call
for
special
status
for
Northern
Ireland
within
the
European
Union
.
however
,
with
no
settle
position
among
the
Northern
Ireland
party
and
the
absence
of
a
power
-
share
executive
,
combine
with
the
state
intention
of
Prime
Minister
May
for
the
UK
to
exit
the
single
Market
,
a
possible
path
forward
have
be
outline
but
with
no
leader
from
the
region
in
a
position
to
advocate
within
the
European
Union
for
it
.
we
believe
there
should
be
a
separate
strand
to
the
article
50
negotiation
to
deal
specifically
with
Ireland
-
UK
issue
and
Northern
Ireland
.
fail
that
,
European
Union
consent
should
be
grant
for
a
bilateral
agreement
to
be
negotiate
between
the
two
jurisdiction
to
address
border
issue
.
that
must
be
address
when
Donald
Tusk
and
the
European
Council
provide
they
negotiating
priority
to
the
European
Commission
.
it
be
we
belief
that
a
new
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
must
be
include
follow
Brexit
.
such
a
protocol
would
acknowledge
and
recognise
the
special
circumstance
that
apply
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
we
support
special
status
for
Northern
Ireland
.
however
,
no
unite
position
have
emerge
in
Northern
Ireland
or
in
the
UK
that
could
or
would
negotiate
for
such
a
arrangement
.
a
Irish
protocol
must
also
provide
for
any
future
unite
Ireland
or
other
transitional
status
.
I
welcome
the
clarity
on
this
issue
secure
by
the
SDLP
yesterday
that
Northern
Ireland
,
if
unite
with
Ireland
,
would
not
be
oblige
to
reapply
to
join
the
European
Union
.
the
Labour
Party
have
also
call
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
in
future
negotiation
,
uphold
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
in
human
rights
protection
across
the
island
,
as
guarantee
under
the
good
Friday
agreement
.
of
particular
concern
to
we
be
how
the
rights
of
more
than
30000
cross-border
worker
will
be
accommodate
and
protect
in
the
future
.
employment
rights
should
be
protect
,
either
in
the
final
EU
-
UK
exit
agreement
,
in
a
new
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
or
in
a
separate
bilateral
agreement
between
Ireland
and
the
UK
.
again
,
that
overlap
with
the
common
travel
area
and
the
rights
provide
through
it
.
there
have
be
too
little
discussion
about
the
future
of
the
North
-
South
cross-Border
implementation
body
.
clarification
be
need
on
how
the
six
body
will
continue
to
operate
and
how
they
will
be
fund
into
the
future
.
there
will
be
specific
European
Union
fronty
border
issue
that
will
affect
the
operation
of
Waterways
Ireland
and
the
Loughs
Agency
.
New
cross-border
body
could
resolve
Brexit
issue
in
energy
and
the
agriculture
sector
.
there
be
a
number
of
policy
area
in
which
all
island
co-operation
have
intensify
and
strengthen
in
recent
year
through
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
.
co-operation
have
be
focus
in
six
area
,
namely
,
agriculture
,
education
,
environment
,
health
,
tourism
and
transport
.
integration
have
also
be
strong
in
many
specific
sector
and
area
,
for
example
in
animal
welfare
,
cross-border
trade
in
livestock
and
agricultural
product
such
as
milk
,
the
energy
sector
,
promotion
of
the
island
of
Ireland
and
accident
and
emergency
service
planning
for
hospital
catchment
area
.
there
be
also
now
the
potential
for
the
creation
of
new
North
-
South
body
to
address
the
problem
that
Brexit
and
a
hard
Border
could
create
.
the
SDLP
have
propose
a
number
of
new
structure
which
we
believe
deserve
strong
consideration
.
we
also
believe
a
new
body
to
oversee
the
all
-
island
energy
market
be
require
.
the
creation
of
that
would
require
extensive
consultation
and
detailed
technical
work
.
at
a
minimum
,
the
North
-
South
body
should
be
specifically
recognise
in
the
propose
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
along
with
provision
for
the
creation
of
new
body
.
the
Labour
Party
also
believe
that
future
funding
should
be
guarantee
by
the
UK
government
beyond
2020
for
a
new
peace
V
programme
,
and
that
a
European
Union
contribution
could
be
channel
to
the
special
European
Union
Programmes
Body
,
SEUPB
,
through
the
Irish
government
.
we
view
be
that
the
UK
exite
the
EU
be
harmful
to
future
UK
and
Irish
joint
co-operation
regard
Northern
Ireland
and
the
peace
process
.
we
believe
we
must
now
redirect
we
effort
to
ensure
that
the
advance
for
Northern
Ireland
,
as
secure
through
and
within
European
Union
structure
,
be
maintain
and
to
ensure
that
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
not
undermine
by
the
UK
exite
the
European
Union
.
British
representative
must
take
the
unique
circumstance
of
Northern
Ireland
and
the
good
Friday
agreement
into
account
in
they
negotiation
with
European
Union
official
.
the
Labour
Party
consider
the
return
of
a
land
border
between
Ireland
and
Northern
Ireland
to
be
unacceptable
.
I
will
conclude
by
refer
to
the
RHI
scandal
,
which
I
have
not
intend
mention
.
it
have
cost
the
British
Exchequer
approximately
£
500
million
at
this
juncture
.
it
speak
to
the
need
to
ensure
the
budgetary
control
element
that
be
stitch
into
a
Fresh
start
,
the
Stormont
agreement
and
implementation
plan
.
I
refer
specifically
to
4.1
under
the
budget
control
head
.
the
UK
government
welcome
the
executive
's
plan
to
establish
a
independent
fiscal
Council
for
Northern
Ireland
.
the
Council
will
:
prepare
a
annual
assessment
of
the
executive
's
revenue
stream
and
spending
proposal
and
how
this
allow
the
executive
to
balance
they
budget
.
the
RHI
scandal
speak
volume
to
the
culture
of
governance
within
the
executive
.
in
my
short
time
there
I
observe
that
oversight
of
spending
be
perhaps
lack
due
to
it
be
a
political
system
where
people
operate
within
very
distinct
and
bespoke

Department
.
far
be
it
from
I
to
comment
on
the
internal
affair
there
,
except
to
say
that
£
500
million
could
have
buy
a
lot
of
new
infrastructure
.
I
think
in
particular
of
the
A5
road
from
Derry
to
Dublin
,
in
respect
of
which
the
Irish
government
have
already
commit
money
.
if
we
be
to
move
forward
to
a
good
executive
,
which
be
something
I
be
hopeful
will
transpire
,
we
must
have
great
tyre
-
kick
on
the
way
money
be
expend
,
particularly
from
a
fiscal
point
of
view
.
there
be
a
piece
within
the
Stormont
House
agreement
and
the
Fresh
start
programme
on
the
creation
of
a
fiscal
council
.
I
be
not
sure
what
progress
have
be
make
on
a
council
,
but
if
it
be
establish
,
all
party
in
a
new
executive
could
buy
into
it
in
relation
to
budgetary
oversight
.
it
would
help
to
ensure
that
whatever
political
silo
operate
from
a
ministerial
point
of
view
and
which
party
be
run
what
,
matter
be
not
leave
to
special
adviser
and
minister
.
as
such
,
the
civil
service
framework
would
ensure
that
there
be
proper
tyre
-
kick
and
we
would
not
have
this
scandal
emerge
such
that
that
who
live
within
the
six
County
might
not
take
the
present
cynical
view
,
as
I
perceive
it
from
my
conversation
on
the
ground
,
of
how
the
executive
operate
at
time
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
make
the
provision
in
Irish
law
to
enable
the
State
to
ratify
the
1954
Hague
Convention
on
the
protection
of
cultural
property
in
the
event
of
a
armed
conflict
,
and
the
1999
protocol
to
the
convention
.
we
support
and
welcome
this
Bill
as
other
have
do
.
specifically
,
the
Bill
will
prohibit
the
destruction
,
damage
and
theft
of
cultural
property
in
specify
circumstance
during
the
course
of
a
armed
conflict
,
in
accordance
with
the
1999
protocol
,
and
will
provide
for
the
appropriate
penalty
upon
conviction
and
related
matter
.
the
1954
Hague
Convention
require
the
contracting
party
to
safeguard
and
respect
cultural
property
in
the
event
of
armed
conflict
.
the
1999
protocol
provide
for
a
high
level
of
enhance
protection
for
cultural
property
which
be
of
the
great
importance
to
humanity
and
have
exceptional
cultural
and
historical
value
.
the
1999
protocol
require
the
contracting
party
to
provide
penalty
in
domestic
law
,
which
be
what
we
be
do
through
this
Bill
,
for
person
who
intentionally
commit
serious
violation
of
the
convention
and
the
protocol
.
the
convention
require
contracting
party
further
to
safeguard
and
respect
cultural
property
.
party
to
the
convention
must
,
in
the
time
of
peace
,
take
such
measure
as
be
consider
appropriate
to
safeguard
cultural
property
within
they
territory
.
I
understand
that
the
Bill
also
confer
legal
protection
on
the
blue
shield
emblem
and
empower
the
Minister
for
Art
,
Heritage
,
Regional
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
to
authorise
its
use
in
this
State
,
which
I
welcome
.
we
welcome
that
property
of
important
cultural
heritage
will
be
protect
at
time
of
war
.
while
the
horror
of
war
be
first
and
foremost
about
human
suffering
,
we
know
how
destructive
it
can
be
in
term
of
cultural
property
,
most
of
which
can
never
be
replace
.
we
know
from
we
own
history
how
war
have
damage
we
cultural
heritage
,
sometimes
with
the
aim
of
destroy
we
identity
.
that
have
happen
throughout
the
world
.
in
recent
time
in
particular
,
some
of
that
party
at
war
have
specifically
target
the
cultural
heritage
of
a
area
,
country
or
people
to
try
to
obliterate
they
identity
.
I
be
aware
that
126
state
be
party
to
the
1954
Hague
Convention
,
and
that
just
four
state
,
namely
,
Andorra
,
Britain
,
Ireland
and
the
Philippines
,
have
sign
the
treaty
but
have
yet
to
ratify
it
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
we
be
give
effect
to
that
ratification
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
my
colleague
,
former
minister
Carál
Ní
Chuilín
,
MLA
,
in
this
regard
.
when
she
serve
as
Minister
of
Culture
,
Art
and
Leisure
in
the
six
County
,
she
support
the
passage
of
similar
legislation
through
the
Assembly
in
Stormont
.
as
regards
the
technical
aspect
of
the
Bill
,
I
broadly
welcome
the
definition
of
"
cultural
property
"
set
out
in
section
1
.
while
I
accept
that
the
Bill
involve
give
effect
to
the
term
of
the
Hague
convention
,
I
must
mention
the
appalling
treatment
of
we
cultural
heritage
at
different
stage
of
we
history
and
,
in
some
regards
,
by
the
current
government
,
specifically
in
respect
of
the
likes
of
Moore
Street
,
although
there
be
a
announcement
today
of
some
possible
progress
on
that
issue
.
it
be
not
fiction
.
no
.
the
Deputy
might
have
a
opportunity
to
move

I
move
:
"
that
the
Bill
be
now

"
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
prohibit
the
use
of
micro-plastic
,
particularly
for
particle
that
be
less
than
5
mm
in
diameter
.
micro-plastic
be
use
in
a
variety
of
cosmetic
and
personal
care
product
such
as
scrub
,
soap
,
lotion
and
toothpaste
.
they
be
add
to
this
product
to
make
the
product
more
abrasive
or
for
decoration
.
this
particle
of
plastic
enter
the
environment
when
consumer
rinse
they
down
the
drain
.
the
plastic
be
not
catch
in
water
treatment
system
and
,
instead
,
be
subsequently
release
into
river
and
the
sea
with
wastewater
outflow
.
micro-plastic
be
a
entirely
unnecessary
source
of
micro-plastic
pollution
and
be
likely
to
have
environmental
impact
.
Study
have
show
they
can
be
ingest
by
marine
animal
,
lead
to
physical
harm
and
reproductive
or
toxic
effect
.
there
be
evidence
to
suggest
that
they
be
enter
the
human
food
chain
,
although
micro-plastic
in
seafood
be
not
currently
think
to
represent
a
human
health
risk
.
Micro-plastic
debris
in
marine
environment
be
grow
in
volume
.
it
come
from
a
number
of
source
apart
from
cosmetic
source
,
such
as
the
breakdown
of
large
piece
of
plastic
over
time
and
industrial
scrubber
use
to
blast
-
clean
surface
.
a
number
of
company
be
voluntarily
phase
out
some
type
of
micro-plastic
in
cosmetic
product
in
the
EU
.
in
the
USA
,
a
ban
on
micro-bead
in
cosmetic
and
personal
care
product
will
be
phase
in
over
the
next
few
year
.
a
call
for
a
similar
ban
in
the
UK
have
be
accept
by
the
UK
government
.
in
December
2014
,
the
Netherlands
,

,
Luxembourg
,

issue
a
joint
statement
to
EU

for

however
,
a

,
look
at
what

mechanism
be
available
to
reduce

bead

from

it
conclude
that
introduce
a
ban
on

would
be
more
complicated
than
the

to
turn
to

do

the

be

I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Green
Party
in
first
raise
this
matter
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
and
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
,
who
have
lead
the
way
on
this
issue
.
I
note
that
the
minister
respond
to
Senator
O'Sullivan
in
the
Seanad
while
not
accept
she
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
government
have
say
it
will
put
forward
its
own
legislative
proposal
in
this
regard
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
when
he
say
the
government
be
commit
to
legislate
on
this
issue
.
the
minister
say
in
he
speech
to
the
Seanad
:
I
see
advantage
in
Ireland
lead
by
example
on
microbead
.
with
this
in
mind
,
the
government
will
develop
proposal
to
ban
microbead
nationally
in
the
context
of
a
wide
marine
environmental
Bill
to
be
publish
[
this
]
year
[
that
be
,
2017
]
,
which
will
also
provide
the
legislative
basis
for
a
network
of
marine
protect
area
[
and
so
on
]
.
I
suppose
the
minister
will
provide
some
rebuttal
to
the
Labour
Party
Bill
.
the
Labour
Party
Bill
seek
to
build
on
the
aim
of
the
Green
Party
Bill
.
we
do
not
seek
to
be
partisan
in
any
way
.
we
believe
this
be
a
issue
that
affect
we
all
and
we
hope
there
be
a
non-partisan
solution
.
I
be
hopeful
today
that
we
will
move
to
a
position
whereby
we
Bill
,
at
least
,
be
accept
and
will
stay
on
the
Order
Paper
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
accept
we
Bill
.
I
doubt
that
will
be
the
case
but
I
hope
we
will
be
able
to
leave
it
on
the
Order
Paper
at
least
until
such
time
as
the
government
come
up
with
a
set
of
proposal
.
the
minister
will
tell
we
there
be
a
issue
of
EU
law
at
play
here
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
single
Market
.
the
minister
will
tell
we
that
Article
34
and
35
of
the
Treaty
have
a
bear
on
whether
or
not
this
legislative
proposal
can
bear
fruit
.
we
have
carefully
consider
the
question
on
EU
law
and
whether
or
not
that
would
prevent
member
state
from
take
action
on
the
issue
.
article
34
and
35
of
the
Treaty
on
the
Functioning
of
the
European
Union
set
out
the
principle
that
,
as
the
single
Market
be
a
area
without
internal
border
,
restriction
on
the
movement
of
goods
be
not
allow
and
that
the
free
movement
of
goods
should
be
guarantee
.
we
accept
this
.
undoubtedly
,
a
Irish
ban
on
the
sale
of
product
contain
microbead
would
have
the
effect
of
restrict
certain
import
.
however
,
article
36
of
the
treaty
go
on
to
state
that
article
34
and
35
do
not
preclude
prohibition
or
restriction
on
import
that
be
justify
on
grounds
of
the
protection
of
health
and
life
of
human
,
animal
or
plant
.
in
other
word
,
the
EU
treaty
directly
acknowledge
that
national
measure
can
be
take
to
protect
the
environment
.
microbead
,
as
we
know
,
enter
the
environment
,
be
not
catch
in
water
treatment
system
and
instead
be
release
into
river
and
the

.
micro-plastic

a
entirely
unnecessary
source
of

and
be
likely
to
have
environmental

.
Study
have
show
they
be

,
lead
to

harm
and
toxic

and
there
be
evidence
to
suggest
they

the
human

.
in
December
2014
,
the
Netherlands
,
Austria
,
Luxembourg
,
Belgium
and
Sweden
issue
a
joint
statement
call
for
a
EU
ban
on
micro-plastic
in
cosmetic
and
detergent
to
EU
minister
with
responsibility
for
environmental
matter
.
in
January
2016
-
I
have
already
refer
to
this
research
report
-
they
examine
what
EU
mechanism
be
available
to
reduce
microbead
pollutant
from
cosmetic
.
in
light
of
the
hesitancy
at
EU
level
,
we
believe
domestic
action
-
that
be
,
action
within
we
own
parliament
-
be
both
necessary
and
appropriate
.
it
be
true
that
we
propose
legislation
amount
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
to
a
trade
barrier
,
but
there
be
a
well
-
establish
procedure
for
deal
with
this
.
the
EU
transparency
directive
set
up
a
procedure
oblige
the
member
state
to
notify
the
commission
of
all
draft
regulation
on
product
before
they
be
adopt
into
national
law
.
the
notification
trigger
a
standstill
period
of
three
month
.
the
commission
and
other
member
state
can
use
this
time
to
examine
the
notify
draft
regulation
to
determine
whether
it
comply
with
the
EU
treaty
and
the
principle
of
free
movement
of
goods
and
service
.
if
there
be
no
reaction
,
the
draft
can
be
adopt
after
the
three
-
month
standstill
period
have
expire
.
this
be
exactly
the
procedure
that
the
then
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
have
to
follow
when
he
introduce
the
ban
on
smoking
in
the
workplace
.
there
be
a
standstill
period
for
the
new
rule
and
then
they
come
into
full
force
and
effect
.
the
European
Commission
can
block
the
proposal
if
the
draft
legislation
concern
a
matter
on
which
the
EU
itself
propose
to
act
,
but
this
be
clearly
not
the
case
at
this
time
regard
micro-plastic
.
we
therefore
firmly
believe
that
the
option
of
unilateral
action
by
Ireland
on
this
issue
be
a
valid
one
under
the
European
Union
treaty
.
it
be
timely
that
we
would
legislate
for
this
very
important
public
health
and
environmental
issue
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
accept
the
legislative
proposal
before
the
House
.
I
anticipate
that
he
will
tell
we
there
will
be
a
government
legislative
proposal
on
this
very
issue
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
.
I
be
conscious
that
we
have
a
opportunity
here
to
collaborate
now
on
a
non-partisan
issue
,
a
issue
of
what
I
would
call
grave
concern
regard
public
health
.
as
I
say
,
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
accept
we
bona
fide
on
this
and
that
we
can
get
cross-party
support
on
the
issue
and
I
look
forward
to
hear
from
the
minister
on
this
matter
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
minister
propose
to
bring
forward
he
own
legislative
proposal
,
I
be
hopeful
that
will
not
be
tack
onto
or
attach
to
another
piece
of
legislation
.
I
be
hopeful
it
would
be
a
bespoke
,
stand
-
alone
legislation
because
I
believe
Ireland
should
take
leadership
on
this
issue
.
it
be
something
that
affect
we
all
.
again
,
I
note
that
the
minister
have
state
he
be
intent
on
legislate
for
this
issue
.
I
will
quote
again
from
the
minister
's
speech
to
the
Seanad
:
there
be
approximately
6.2
trillion
particle
of
litter
in
we
ocean
.
that
be
1000
particle
for
every
person
on
the
planet
.
the
Bill
be
therefore
tie
in
and
ally
to
many
other
issue
related
to
the
marine
environment
.
I
stand
before
the
House
as
a
former
minister
of
State
for
research
and
innovation
and
someone
who
be
commit
during
the
lifetime
of
the
previous
government
,
along
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
,
and
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Howlin
,
to
ensure
taxpayer
's
money
be
use
in
a
way
that
recognise
the
value
of
we
maritime
environment
and
the
potential
of
that
environment
to
deliver
marine
renewable
energy
.
we
want
to
see
clean
ocean
and
clean
sea
and
,
as
a
island
nation
,
we
need
to
take
a
global
leadership
position
on
this
.
would
it
be
possible
to
have
a
copy
of
the
minister
's
speech
circulate
?
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
I
thank
colleague
who
have
welcome
the
principle
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
very
clear
there
be
a
intention
on
the
part
of
the
House
,
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
,
to
legislate
for
the
issue
and
to
ensure
that
we
can
put
in
place
a
robust
mechanism
that
will
offset
the
dire
economic
cost
of
the
presence
of
microbead
and
micro-plastic
in
we
environment
.
I
thank
member
for
they
support
in
the
first
instance
when
the
legislation
be
introduce
.
the
Green
Party
Deputy
be
the
originator
of
the
Bill
and
I
acknowledge
they
role
.
we
hope
to
bring
this
legislation
a
step
further
in
seek
to
deal
with
the
legal
issue
pertain
to
the
European
Union
and
the
specific
treaty
provision
.
I
reiterate
that
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
and
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
on
the
government
's
intention
to
legislate
on
this
issue
.
since
proposal
will
come
before
the
government
in
June
,
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
I
would
hope
that
we
could
be
in
some
space
to
have
this
before
we
again
by
autumn
of
this
year
.
be
I
correct
in
understanding
that
there
may
be
a
proposal
to
bring
it
before
the
government
in
June
?
the
official
be
not
say
that
.
the
foreshore
Bill
will
be
bring
before
government
in
June
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
this
matter
could
be
attach
to
it
.
that
be
the
intention
.
I
raise
the
issue
of
have
a
bespoke
Bill
.
the
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
also
seek
to
have
one
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
could
deal
with
this
in
a
bespoke
fashion
.
that
would
be
the
good
way
.
indeed
.
I
want
absolute
clarity
about
this
.
if
the
foreshore
Bill
be
to
come
before
we
,
which
I
imagine
will
be
robust
and
detailed
legislation
,
I
be
fearful
that
legislation
deal
with
micro-plastic
or
microbead
could
get
lose
in
the
large
piece
.
that
be
fair
enough
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
about
the
June
deadline
.
in
any
event
,
I
be
hopeful
that
by
autumn
2017
when
we
come
back
from
the
summer
recess
we
will
at
least
be
in
a
position
to
have
a
Bill
or
the
head
of
a
Bill
before
we
.
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
at
he
word
when
he
say
there
will
be
a
consultation
period
with
all
interested
party
in
the
House
,
as
per
the
acting
Chairman
's
suggestion
,
so
that
we
can
proceed
in
a
non-partisan
way
to
give
effect
to
a
good
and
robust
piece
of
legislation
.
I
be
open
to
any
mechanism
that
can
be
use
to
-----
I
will
conclude
by
say
that
there
be
3000
submission
.
there
be
a
huge
demand
outside
of
this
house
for
this
issue
to
be
deal
with
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
Minister
of
State
for
they
openness
.
I
be
appreciative
of
the
fact
that
they
be
not
oppose
the
Bill
in
typical
partisan
fashion
.
we
Bill
will
remain
on
the
agenda
.
I
will
be
happy
to
take
it
off
the
agenda
as
soon
as
we
see
a
set
of
proposal
come
from
the
government
side
.
Fianna
Fáil
have
also
say
it
intend
to
bring
forward
a
set
of
proposal
.
we
will
keep
a
open
mind
.

there
be
no
attempt
by
the
Labour
Party
to
prevent
the
normalisation
of
the
banking
sector
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
allege
.
there
be
certainly
no
attempt
to
conflate
two
separate
and
discrete
policy
area
,
namely
,
banking
policy
and
capital
investment
constraint
.
the
debt
to
gdp
ratio
be
at
a
sustainable
level
and
the
general
government
debt
have
fall
by
€
18
billion
in
the
past
three
year
.
debt
stock
be
now
€
1
billion
low
than
it
be
at
the
end
of
2015
and
this
be
the
third
successive
year
of
decline
.
Gross
government
debt
decline
from
a
peak
of
approximately
€
218
billion
in
the
third
quarter
of
2013
to
€200
billion
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2016
.
the
debt
to
gdp
ratio
,
which
peak
in
2012
at
almost
120
%
,
be
forecast
to
fall
below
73
%
by
the
end
of
this
year
and
to
reach
62.8
%
by
2021
.
we
may
even
reach
a
ratio
of
60
%
by
2021
.
from
a
macroeconomic
point
of
view
,
the
minister
seek
to
sell
25
%
of
a
asset
ultimately
to
achieve
a
debt
to
gdp
target
of
45
%
by
the
mid-2020
when
the
current
target
under
the
stability
and
growth
pact
be
60
%
.
what
be
flawed
be
the
idea
of
accelerate
unnecessarily
the
repayment
of
debt
when
the
country
be
cry
out
for
infrastructural
investment
.
use
the
proceed
of
the
sale
of
any
portion
of
AIB
for
capital
spending
could
boost
the
amount
available
for
investment
by
approximately
€
3
billion
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
Keynes
.
Keynes
would
have
something
to
say
about
the
establishment
of
a
rainy
day
fund
.
he
might
say
that
,
instead
of
have
just
€
2.5
billion
to
invest
in
school
,
transport
and
home
,
the
government
would
have
more
than
€
8.5
billion
in
the
come
year
without
any
negative
risk
to
we
economy
.
there
be
infrastructural
bottleneck
.
we
do
not
have
a
proper
motorway
link
Cork
to
Limerick
to
Galway
to
Sligo
to
Donegal
,
or
the
Atlantic
corridor
as
we
call
it
.
if
the
action

,
which
be
a
government
policy
,
be
to
mean
anything
in
term
of
create
the
target
of
350000

,
we
will
need
that

in

-

we
believe
that

and
could
become
a
reality

the
necessary

in

I
reach
to

the
copy

that
I
have
in

I
no

negotiate
for

be
the
time
for

leader
,
include
this
Taoiseach
and
the
incoming
one
,
whoever
that
may
be
,
to
make
the
political
case
for
a
relaxation
of
the
rule
so
as
to
ensure
that
whatever
dividend
be
ultimately
yield
be
use
for
productive
purpose
and
investment
in
infrastructure
.
even
if
we
accept
the
premise
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
argument
and
ceteris
paribus
,
or
all
thing
be
equal
,
he
have
still
not
make
a
compelling
argument
for
the
sale
from
a
macroeconomic
point
of
view
except
that
,
if
I
understand
he
correctly
,
the
State
should
not
be
vested
in
the
banking
system
and
it
should
be
a
function
purely
of
the
market
.
however
,
the
State
have
always
be
a
major
investor
-
in
fact
,
the
large
investor
-
in
job
creation
,
be
that
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
the
IDA
or
direct
subvention
of
the
very
business
that
depend
on
the
banking
sector
to
thrive
.
the
motion
before
the
House
be
to
ensure
that
we
can
relax
the
rule
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
and
use
dividend
from
the
banking
sector
productively

in

Extraction

Petroleum
Bill
2016
and
have
make
amendment
thereto
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
we
will
be
support
it
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
to
be
genuine
in
he
attempt
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
if
we
have
one
criticism
,
it
would
be
that
some
of
the
deadline
should
be
soon
rather
than
in

three
and
four

this

I
wish
to
speak
briefly

he
could
let

,
perhaps
by
the
end

two

three
,
because
it
be
such
a
vital
issue
.
I
do
not
need
to
rehearse
in
the
House
the
issue
that
affect
return

but
if
the
protocol
could
be
design

a
way

I
be

for
policyholder
to
be
notify
of
claim
make
against
they
before
settlement
date
.
I
seek
a
real
-
time
clarification
from
the
minister
of
State
on
that
.
that
be
a
matter
of
some
discussion
today
in
the
media
.
the
Minister
of
State
and
deputy
Michael
McGrath
refer
specifically
to
it
.
I
be
listen
to
the
discussion
in
passing
.
what
be
the
position
on
that
?
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
such
a
recommendation
should
be
much
strong
and
that
defendant
should
be
give
a
opportunity
to
mount
a
defence
instead
of
a
insurer
decide
that
it
be
uneconomic
to
defend
and
go
to
a
default
payment
mechanism
.
I
acknowledge
deputy
Michael
McGrath
on
that
point
because
he
raise
it
on
the
Sean
O'Rourke
show
early
today
.
we
all
want
to
ensure
the
cost
of
motoring
will
be
reduce
for
every
motorist
,
regardless
of
he
or
she
demographic
and
the
age
of
the
vehicle
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
that
report
on
this
issue
and
one
of
the
major
issue
be
related
to
old
vehicle
.
if
a
old
vehicle
pass
the
nct
,
the
owner
should
not
be
discriminate
against
because
of
its
age
.
that
do
not
make
a
ounce
of
sense
as
the
NCT
be
subject
to
the
law
of
the
land
.
I
have
serious
difficulty
with
the
issue
of
transparency
because
we
be
tell
all
along
that
the
reason
for
the
stark
increase
in
the
cost
of
premia
be
the
provisioning
that
be
necessary
on
the
part
of
insurance
company
to
cover
loss
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
report
about
this
,
but
I
have
a
great
difficulty
with
the
amount
provide
for
.
person
will
accept
a
increase
in
they
premia
,
but
they
cannot
sustain
the
increase
they
have
have
to
sustain
in
the
past
12
month
.
the
insurance
industry
be
tell
we
a
corrective
mechanism
be
in
place
whereby
premia
have
be
reduce
by
40
%
in
some
instance
.
a
component
have
to
be
pure
and
utter
profit
.
there
be
no
transparency
on
that
profit
making
.
another
issue
I
have
be
that
Insurance
Ireland
seem
to
speak
for
the
industry
at
the
committee
hearing
.
it
be
not
about
personality
,
but
I
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
one
person
with
one
voice
seem
to
represent
the
entire
industry
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
outline
whether
the
working
group
have
hear
from
voice
other
than
Insurance
Ireland
?
in
other
word
,
have
the
chief
executive
officer
of
insurance
company
deal
directly
with
he
?
what
have
be
the
nature
of
the
engagement
between
they
?
Consumer
would
not
necessarily
recognise
insurance
Ireland
as
the
sole
voice
of
the
sector
.
it
would
be
useful
for
we
to
have
some
insight
from
the
Minister
of
State
into
what
he
engagement
be
with
they
.
it
would
be
even
good
if
he
name
the
individual
company
.
I
doubt
that
he
will
,
but
I
make
the
request
respectfully
.
we
support
the
motion
.
I
recognise
the
work
the
minister
of
State
be
do
,
but
I
would
like
he
to
ensure
the
goal
to
be
attain
within
certain
quarter
be
fast
-
track
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
return
emigrant
.
perhaps
he
might
have
something
to
say
about
that
.
it
would
be
useful
and
send
a
signal
.
I
would
also
like
he
to
comment
on
the
issue
affect
old
driver
,
driver
of
old
vehicle
and
public
service
vehicle
and
the
distinction
between
taxi
and
so
on
and
sme
that
have
fleet
but
which
find
they
insurance
cost
have
go
through
the
roof
.
he
should
ensure
a
level
playing
field
in
respect
of
transparency
on
the
difference
between
the
provisioning
and
the
corrective
measure
he
have
say
be
be
introduce
and
the
profit
generate
.
person
want
to
feel
that
they
be
not
be
screw
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
word
"
screw
"
be
unparliamentary
language
,
but
I
be
speak
in
the
vernacular
.
it
be
unfair
that
consumer
find
themselves
in
this
position
at
this
time
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
will
receive
a
letter
if
the
word
be
deem
to
be
unparliamentary
.
I
read
the
list
of
prohibit
word
lately
and
the
term
"
corner
-
boy
"
be
proscribe
.
perhaps
that
be
now
anachronistic
,
but
it
be
appropriate
at
a
certain
time
.
we
do
not
want
the
insurance
industry
to
act
like
a
corner
-
boy
in
this
regard
.
we
be
prepared
to
withdraw
the
amendment
on
the
basis
that
we
all
agree
that
this
be
need
in
term
of
have
some
oversight
of
transport
and
land
use

.

on
behalf
of
the
Irish
Labour
Party
,
I
wish
to
express
we
deep
sympathy
to
that
affect
by
the
Manchester
attack
,
which
be
appalling
.
it
be
probably
no
accident
that
the
attack
plan
for
maximum
carnage
,
target
young
woman
and
girl
mostly
and
occur
in
the
midst
of
a
general
election
.
it
be
a
attack
on
we
democratic
value
and
,
in
particular
,
on
the
innocence
of
youth
.
I
wish
to
echo
the
word
of
the
Manchester
Mayor
,
Andy
Burnham
,
who
say
today
:
this
be
child
,
young
people
and
they
family
that
that
responsible
choose
to
terrorise
and
kill
.
this
be
a
evil
act
.
I
offer
we
deep
sympathy
to
the
victim
,
they
family
and
the
people
of
Manchester
.
Ireland
have
always
have
strong
link
with
Manchester
.
today
,
more
than
ever
,
we
stand
alongside
the
community
there
as
they
mourn
the
needless
loss
of
so
many
young
life
.
it
be
in
this
spirit
that
the
lord
Mayor
of
Dublin
,
Brendan
Carr
,
have
open
a
book
of
condolence
,
as
have
he
counterpart
in
many
municipal
authority
throughout
the
country
.
I
wish
to
pay
tribute
to
the
emergency
worker
and
all
the
local
people
in
Manchester
who
have
be
do
all
they
can
to
help
in
the
aftermath
of
this
atrocity
.
the
strength
and
spirit
show
by
the
community
there
be
the
good
response
to
despicable
act
of
terror
.
it
be
great
to
see
collegiality
at
work
.
the
deputy
should
speak
to
a
representative
of
the
Business
Committee
.
this
be
childish
.
that
be
not
exactly
what
happen
.
I
welcome
the
contribution
of
all
the
Deputy
who
contribute
but
I
be
very
disappointed
not
more
group
take
time
to
speak
on
this
important
issue
.
not
only
in
the
context
of
my
motion
but
in
health
debate
in
general
,
there
have
always
be
a
strong
element
of
robust
debate
and
analysis
in
this
chamber
.
however
,
it
be
quite
incredible
that
we
could
not
fill
the
full
allocation
of
two
hour
this
evening
.
the
motion
be
tab
because
we
must
consistently
highlight
the
deficiency
and
inadequacy
in
we
health
service
.
deputy
Eamon
Scanlon
,
for
example
,
highlight
a
genuine
,
real
case
,
one
of
the
660000
people
out
there
on
waiting
list
.
the
motion
be
tab
with
that
purpose
in
mind
and
also
to
come
up
with
some
observation
and
solution
in
the
area
of
health
care
.
we
need
to
increase
the
time
during
which
diagnostic
test
be
available
across
hospital
.
we
must
move
to
a
system
of
provision
from
8
a.m.
to
8
p.m.
,
seven
day
a
week
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
ward
that
be
close
be
open
up
.
we
talk
about
a
lack
of
bed
and
bed
capacity
review
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
ward
close
simply
because
we
cannot
retain
or
recruit
enough
nursing
staff
to
populate
they
.
even
within
the
current
crisis
,
there
be
solution
that
may
resolve
some
of
the
problem
to
which
the
Deputy
refer
in
the
context
of
individual
wait
inordinate
period
for
diagnostics
,
operation
or
procedure
.
it
be
within
the
government
's
gift
to
do
this
thing
;
it
just
need
a
little
honest
commitment
,
a
bit
of
backbone
and
a
government
willing
to
consider
the
challenge
out
there
and
try
to
resolve
they
step
by
step
.
we
have
listen
to
lecture
from
that
who
oppose
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
.
I
have
no
ideological
view
as
to
whether
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
right
or

.
my
only
view
be
that
it
do
benefit
that
who
be
wait
inordinate
period
on
the
public
waiting
list
.
it
drive
down
waiting
list
over
a
protracted
period
and
it
be
a
positive
initiative
.
that
who
support
Maduro
and
Stalinist
party
can
have
they
view
but
I
simply
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
while
we
public
hospital
system
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deal
with
what
be
present
to
it
daily
,
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
a
solution
in
the
short
and
medium
term
while
we
wrap
up
capacity
in
we
public
health
system
.
in
the
motion
,
we
highlight
the
deficiency
and
come
up
with
sensible
suggestion
which
,
I
believe
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
she
colleague
can
,
with
a
small
bit
of
imagination
and
grit
,
resolve
.
I
ask

to

,
the

that
be
what
be

out
there

I
do
not

to

but
we
have
a
obligation

a
duty
to
come
up
with
solution

if
we
do
not
accept
first
of
all
that
we
have
massive
problem
,
as
identify
by
my

this

we
will
consistently
go
on

people
languish
on

and
350

360
people
a

languish

indictment
on

,
in
the
context
of
the
issue
I
have
highlight
,
would
make
a
impact
on
some
people
's
life
if
the
government
act
upon
it
.
I
commend
the
motion
to
the
House
.
I
welcome
the
contribution
of
all
the
Deputy
who
contribute
but
I
be
very
disappointed
not
more
group
take
time
to
speak
on
this
important
issue
.
not
only
in
the
context
of
my
motion
but
in
health
debate
in
general
,
there
have
always
be
a
strong
element
of
robust
debate
and
analysis
in
this
chamber
.
however
,
it
be
quite
incredible
that
we
could
not
fill
the
full
allocation
of
two
hour
this
evening
.
the
motion
be
tab
because
we
must
consistently
highlight
the
deficiency
and
inadequacy
in
we
health
service
.
deputy
Eamon
Scanlon
,
for
example
,
highlight
a
genuine
,
real
case
,
one
of
the
660000
people
out
there
on
waiting
list
.
the
motion
be
tab
with
that
purpose
in
mind
and
also
to
come
up
with
some
observation
and
solution
in
the
area
of
health
care
.
we
need
to
increase
the
time
during
which
diagnostic
test
be
available
across
hospital
.
we
must
move
to
a
system
of
provision
from
8
a.m.
to
8
p.m.
,
seven
day
a
week
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
ward
that
be
close
be
open
up
.
we
talk
about
a
lack
of
bed
and
bed
capacity
review
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
ward
close
simply
because
we
cannot
retain
or
recruit
enough
nursing
staff
to
populate
they
.
even
within
the
current
crisis
,
there
be
solution
that
may
resolve
some
of
the
problem
to
which
the
Deputy
refer
in
the
context
of
individual
wait
inordinate
period
for
diagnostics
,
operation
or
procedure
.
it
be
within
the
government
's
gift
to
do
this
thing
;
it
just
need
a
little
honest
commitment
,
a
bit
of
backbone
and
a
government
willing
to
consider
the
challenge
out
there
and
try
to
resolve
they
step
by
step
.
we
have
listen
to
lecture
from
that
who
oppose
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
.
I
have
no
ideological
view
as
to
whether
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
right
or
wrong
.
my
only
view
be
that
it
do
benefit
that
who
be
wait
inordinate
period
on
the
public
waiting
list
.
it
drive
down
waiting
list
over
a
protracted
period
and
it
be
a
positive
initiative
.
that
who
support
Maduro
and
Stalinist
party
can
have
they
view
but
I
simply
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
while
we
public
hospital
system
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deal
with
what
be
present
to
it
daily
,
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
a
solution
in
the
short
and
medium
term
while
we
wrap
up
capacity
in
we
public
health
system
.
in
the
motion
,
we
highlight
the
deficiency
and
come
up
with
sensible
suggestion
which
,
I
believe
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
she
colleague
can
,
with
a
small
bit
of
imagination
and
grit
,
resolve
.
I
ask
she
to
consider
,
for
example
,
the
area
of
diagnostics
.
day
in
,
day
out
,
there
be
not
a
deputy
in
this
house
who
do
not
table
a
dáil
question
about
someone
attend
he
or
she
clinic
or
advice
centre
who
simply
cannot
get
a
diagnosis
.
this
people
be
wait
year
to
get
diagnosis
.
they
do
not
know
what
be
wrong
with
they
.
the
doctor
or
general
practitioner
will
write
a
referral
state
the
matter
be
urgent
;
six
month
or
a
year
will
pass
;
there
will
be
delay
,
prevarication
and
cancellation
.
last
year
alone
,
36000
operation
be
cancel
in
the
public
health
system
-
36000
people
who
have
in
they
own
mind
be
prepare
for
a
operation
and
it
be
cancel
.
I
have
deal
with
case
of
woman
who
be
schedule
for
double
mastectomy
and
gown
up
in
a
hospital
but
whose
procedure
be
cancel
at
the
last
minute
.
that
be
what
be
happen
out
there
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
alarmist
,
but
we
have
a
obligation
and
a
duty
to
come
up
with
solution
.
if
we
do
not
accept
first
of
all
that
we
have
massive
problem
,
as
identify
by
my
colleague
this
evening
,
we
will
consistently
go
on
the
merry
-
go
-
round
of
pretence
and
spin
while
660000
people
languish
on
waiting
list
and
350
or
360
people
a
day
languish
on
trolley
.
it
be
a
sad
indictment
on
everyone
but
it
be
the
government
's
turn
now
to
come
up
with
some
of
the
solution
and
to
address
some
of
the
inadequacy
.
tonight
's
motion
,
in
the
context
of
the
issue
I
have
highlight
,
would
make
a
impact
on
some
people
's
life
if
the
government
act
upon
it
.
I
commend
the
motion
to
the
House
.
we
do
not
.
that
be
not
a
factual
statement
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
wish
to
assist
the
deputy
.
there
be
no
minister
with
responsibility
for
labour
affair
in
the
last
government
until
quite
late
in
its
term
.
the
Bill
be
introduce
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
government
.
I
hope
that
be
of
assistance
to
the
Member
.
this
be
a
non-partisan
debate
.
do
Fianna
Fáil
oppose
it
?

I
join
in
wish
the
Taoiseach
and
the
new
cabinet
well
in
they
endeavour
.
I
particularly
wish
the
new
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
well
in
he
new
role
.
I
acknowledge
he
commitment
to
and
role
in
the
negotiation
in
Northern
Ireland
.
he
have
make
a
impact
and
the
party
in
Northern
Ireland
will
miss
he
solid
engagement
there
.
there
be
a
so
-
call
public
sector
pay
agreement
that
have
yet
to
be
ballote
upon
but
there
be
nothing
in
the
Taoiseach
's
speech
tonight
to
give
comfort
to
that
public
sector
worker
and
trade
union
about
who
now
have
political
responsibility
for
continue
the
work
.
I
wish
the
new
Minister
for
Finance
and
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
well
in
he
endeavour
.
if
he
be
to
continue
to
lead
in
this
it
will
be
a
onerous
task
in
addition
to
responsibility
for
finance
,
public
expenditure
and
reform
.
I
worry
that
the
government
will
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
that
important
talk
with
the
public
sector
union
.
in
respect
of
Innovation
2020
,
I
have
notice
in
the
past
year
that
the
foot
have
be
take
off
the
pedal
of
Ireland
's
research
,
development
and
innovation
agenda
.
the
innovation
agenda
be
a
key
pillar
of
the
last
government
and
continue
to
be
,
under
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
when
in
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Innovation
and
Enterprise
and
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
until
he
become
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
.
it
have
now
slip
off
the
agenda
.
Ireland
be
now
far
below
average
in
its
spending
on
research
and
development
and
the
number
of
phd
in
real
term
be
decrease
.
if
we
be
talk
about
become
a
innovative
island
on
the
western
periphery
of
Europe
,
Brexit
have
permutation
too
in
respect
of
we
ability
to
attract
world
class
researcher
to
we
shore
.
the
government
need
to
give
priority
to
that
and
we
must
ensure
that
we
spending
on
research
,
development
and
innovation
do
not
become
a
low
priority
.
it
need
to
be
give
great
weight
by
government
.
while
I
congratulate
the
new
minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Coveney
,
I
fear
that
we
be
go
to
lose
he
because
the
foreign
affair
agenda
will
perhaps
take
he
away
from
the
Cork
agenda
and
the
Munster
agenda
and
the
regional
economic
development
-----
-----
of
Cork
,
Limerick
,
Galway
and
Donegal
,
the
western
seaboard
of
this
island
,
and
the
investment
in
the
Cork
-
Limerick
bypass
.
Kerry
as
well
.
we
should
not
forget
Kerry
.
it
be
important
to
speak
to
the
action
plan
for
job
which
have
specific
target
in
respect
of
job
creation
beyond
the
pale
and
that
include
that
county
I
have
just
refer
to
.
that
need
proper
infrastructure
.
this
be
a
cabinet
and
a
Taoiseach
that
will
be
work
night
and
day
,
conscious
of
what
need
to
be
do
and
what
we
need
to
achieve
but
also
conscious
of
the
journey
that
we
country
have
make

I
be
hope
for
some
positive
message
on
the
regulation
of
the
sector
in
the
minister
's
speech
and
I
have
to
say
in
all
sincerity
that
I
be
not
see
anything
that
be
worthwhile
.
the
minister
state
that
he
be
acknowledge
the
concern
of
some
household
and
in
that
regard
he
will
introduce
a
pricing
watchdog
monitoring
unit
.
I
have
never
hear
of
a
"
pricing
watchdog
monitoring
unit
"
that
will
have
tooth
.
this
be
without
tooth
.
it
be
,
in
all
honesty
,
a
attempt
to
placate
the
Member
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
House
in
order
to
ensure
that
this
new
regime
will
get
as
smooth
a
political
passage
as
possible
.
the
monthly
report
on
pricing
development
involve
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
to
report
on
the
household
waste
collection
market
be
wholly
inadequate
.
in
fairness
,
the
minister
have
be
in
situ
for
a
year
.
this
be
announce
well
over
a
year
ago
.
what
be
the
minister
do
for
the
last
year
on
objectively
examine
how
the
market
for
waste
operate
in
Ireland
?
the
idea
that
the
minister
will
set
up
or
establish
a
regulator
on
the
basis
of
a
evidence
base
or
information
that
be
go
to
come
in
do
not
stand
up
.
we
be
now
into
July
2017
.
this
be
a
attempt
to
kick
the
can
further
down
the
line
.
I
be
make
the
argument
,
notwithstand
the
minister
's
rejection
of
we
proposal
,
to
give
more
power
to
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
to
set
up
a
pricing
division
in
the
agency
as
such
measure
would
ensure
the
State
have
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
market
.
there
would
be
no
major
cost
impediment
to
do
that
.
the
minister
would
have
goodwill
towards
the
idea
if
the
EPA
be
already
regulate
the
market
,
that
be
,
if
legislation
be
in
place
to
back
that
up
and
if
the
EPA
be
already
research
and
analyse
the
market
.
the
very
act
of
set
up
some
sort
of
watchdog
or
monitoring
unit
be
pointless
.
there
be
a
opportunity
in
the
past
year
to
set
up
something
that
have
real
tooth
and
that
could
have
really
look
at
the
market
.
I
do
not
accept
that
it
be
adequate
for
the
minister
to
say
we
be
provide
choice
in
the
market
in
respect
of
the
pricing
mechanism
,
that
be
,
the
per
kilo
charge
,
the
lift
and
per
kilo
charge
,
the
weight
band
charge
or
the
weight
allowance
plus
per
kilo
surcharge
for
excess
weight
.
all
this
different
product
be
already
in
existence
in
the
market
.
if
we
be
make
the
argument
on
the
basis
of
increase
competition
,
then
we
have
to
analyse
properly
the
exact
nature
of
the
market
at
the
moment
.
it
be
not
a
perfectly
competitive
market
in
spite
of
the
minister
's
contention
.
in
fact
,
the
minister
have
potentially
create
a
vacuum
within
a
short
space
of
time
whereby
the
waste
management
company
can
come
together
,
act
like
a
cartel
and
start
fix
price
in
a
manner
that
they
so
choose
,
thereby
adversely
affect
consumer
,
in
the
absence
of
any
proper
regulatory
regime
.
person
want
honesty
in
the
debate
.
if
one
consider
the
polluter
pay
principle
,
one
cannot
have
a
situation
whereby
that
who
recycle
every
week
to
the
tune
of
30
%
,
40
%
,
50
%
or
high
of
they
waste
be
subsidise
that
who
do
not
.
we
need
proper
analysis
of
how
the
market
actually
work
before
we
introduce
any
move
away
from
the
flat
charge
structure
.
there
be
still
a
lack
of
information
and
of
consumer
information
in
particular
with
regard
to
what
product
be
available
.
most
people
be
price
taker
because
depend
on
geography
,
they
have
no
choice
but
to
be
price
taker
.
if
they
live
in
large
conurbation
,
they
may
have
competition
.
however
,
if
a
person
live
in
rural
west
Cork
and
there
be
only
one
operator
there
,
that
person
be
subject
to
the
pricing
mechanism
.
let
we
not
call
that
competition
,
because
it
be
not
.
we
believe
there
could
be
a
role
for
the
local
authority
in
future
.
in
the
past
,
local
authority
guarantee
universal
service
but
that
universal
service
be
no
long
in
existence
.
as
some
people
do
not
have
access
to
waste
collection
,
there
be
apartheid
in
that
sense
.
the
new
structure
the
minister
propose
to
introduce
will
encourage
more
people
to
dispose
of
they
waste
illegally
.
it
be
not
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
come
back
to
the
House
after
a
year
with
this
temporary
quick
-
fix
solution
.
there
should
have
be
proper
analysis
during
the
past
year
.
we
will
stand
with
we
hand
up
if
the
minister
want
to
critique
we
position
-
that
be
fair
enough
.
however
,
in
politics
one
be
also
allow
to
evolve
and
advance
one
's
position
and
the
minister
have
be
in
situ
for
over
a
year
.
we
have
to
look
at
the
green
school
programme
.
we
all
agree
with
the
Repak
recycle
and
change
for
the
good
educational
programme
.
all
such
programme
be
have
a
positive
effect
on
behaviour
.
however
,
it
be
no
good
teaching
a
child
of
seven
,
eight
or
ten
year
of
age
about
the
need
to
recycle
if
the
family
of
the
child
do
not
have
the
bin
at
home
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
that
be
the
current
position
in
large
swathe
of
the
country
.
there
should
be
a
postponement
in
this
regard
.
there
be
a
role
for
the
EPA
and
we
need
to
look
at
Repak
because
while
there
may
be
a
industry
view
on
what
Repak
do
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
consumer
-
face
view
on
what
Repak
do
.
we
be
reach
dangerous
level
of
plastic
production
globally
.
the
amount
of
plastic
go
into
refuse
and
not
be
recycle
be
dangerous
at
this
stage
and
be
result
in
major
environmental
cost
.
there
be
no
need
to
rehash
the
evidence
on
what
be
happen
in
the
environment
vis
-à
-
vo
the
production
of
plastic
.
we
need
a
overview
and
proper
analysis
of
what
exactly
be
go
on
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
a
watchdog
monitoring
unit
be
not
a
sufficient
response
.
we
have
be
in
government
.
I
understand
that
the
government
have
to
respond
politically
and
try
to
get
the
motion
over
the
line
and
so
on
.
there
be
a
confidence
and
supply
arrangement
and
one
should
be
realistic
about
that
.
however
,
this
should
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
consumer
,
who
be
not
fool
.
as
for
part
of
the
minister
's
speech
,
for
he
to
stand
up
in
the
Dáil
and
state
no
one
leave
light
or
the
immersion
on
any
more
when
there
be
a
incentive
to
turn
they
off
be
schoolboy
stuff
.
it
be
unbecoming
of
the
minister
to
come
in
and
make
statement
like
that
.
the
people
be
educate
and
be
not
to
be
treat
like
fool
.
the
people
want
a
market
and
want
to
be
able
to
recycle
.
they
want
access
to
proper
service
.
however
,
the
regime
the
minister
be
propose
be
not
go
to
provide
this
because
it
be
not
a
perfectly
competitive
market
.
it
be
actually
go
to
be
more
of
the
same
.
the
people
who
have
the
flat
charge
at
the
moment
be
concerned
about
how
much
they
charge
be
go
to
increase
as
a
result
of
this
.
they
need
certainty
.
person
need
certainty
in
they
household
budget
.
the
minister
's
willingness
to
compromise
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
proposal
to
establish
a
regulator
be
welcome
and
,
as
such
,
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
however
,
there
obviously
be
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
regulator
must
be
establish
.
I
hope
that
in
tandem
with
he
work
with
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
which
will
provide
the
monthly
report
,
the
minister
will
begin
the
procedure
associate
with
the
establishment
of
the
regulator
.
he
may
rest
assure
that
if
this
do
not
happen
,
Fianna
Fáil
will
bring
its
own
Bill
to
the
House
.
notwithstanding
the
government
's
commitment
last
year
to
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
over
a
protracted
period
,
nothing
happen
.
I
accept
that
responsibility
transfer
from
one
minister
to
another
,
so
it
be
not
entirely
on
the
minister
's
shoulder
.
if
,
however
,
the
same
lethargy
be
hold
sway
again
,
we
will
proceed
and
move
to
bring
we
own
Bill
forward
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
use
he
contact
in
the
waste
collection
sector
to
seek
to
continue
the
moratorium
on
price
increase
for
that
period
of
time
.
the
Taoiseach
indicate
early
today
that
he
do
not
expect
to
see
any
change
in
the
charging
structure
for
the
next
15
to
18
month
.
this
give
adequate
time
for
the
report
the
minister
will
seek
to
be
compile
and
for
the
regulator
to
be
establish
.
unfortunately
,
Sinn
Féin
have
fail
to
understand
the
marketplace
that
exist
at
present
.
it
seem
to
think
the
decision
that
be
take
effectively
remove
the
capacity
of
waste
operator
to
increase
charge
.
a
number
of
the
68
waste
collection
operator
increase
they
price
over
the
past
12
month
.
Sinn
Féin
would
like
to
present
this
as
be
some
kind
of
cataclysmic
event
but
it
be
not
.
the
free
market
have
dictate
that
some
have
raise
they
price
.
if
Sinn
Féin
be
as
serious
about
protect
consumer
as
it
say
it
be
,
it
would
support
the
introduction
of
the
regulator
,
as
set
out
by
the
minister
,
because
it
be
in
the
long
-
term
interest
to
ensure
that
price
gouging
do
not
take
place
.
deputy
Danny
Healy
-
Rae
would
be
wise
to
look
at
the
record
of
what
be
say
.
no
one
refer
to
any
of
that
involved
in
the
waste
collection
sector
as
be
gouger
.
price
gouging
be
different
in
meaning
to
the
colloquial
term
"
gouger
"
.
what
be
say
be
that
there
be
some
unscrupulous
waste
collector
in
the
sector
.
nobody
ever
mention
the
deputy
's
local
operator
.
if
I
be
to
speak
about
promote
the
interest
of
party
in
this
regard
,
clean
Ireland
,
which
be
base
in
Clare
,
be
one
of
the
fine
in
term
of
embrace
modern
technology
,
collect
on
the
basis
of
pay
-
by
-
weight
and
spearhead
the
introduction
of
new
technology
.
it
be
outstanding
.
if
the
rest
of
the
sector
be
half
as
well
verse
in
the
development
of
technology
as
the
O'Donoghue
brother
be
in
develop
clean
Ireland
,
there
would
be
no
need
for
we
to
be
here
today
.
sadly
,
there
be
some
who
reside
outside
the
group
that
advocate
for
the
industry
and
do
not
participate
in
it
.
we
must
put
that
kind
of
a
structure
in
place
.
Sinn
Féin
would
also
be
wise
to
recognise
there
be
a
compromise
and
the
minister
propose
to
ensure
consideration
be
give
to
family
experience
financial
hardship
.
this
should
be
address
as
part
of
a
social
welfare
Bill
rather
than
attempt
to
do
it
through
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
action
and
environment
.
however
,
since
the
minister
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
this
be
a
government
amendment
,
I
be
pleased
we
achieve
this
level
of
success
.
in
so
far
as
be
possible
,
the
price
freeze
must
,
with
the
support
of
the
mainstream
industry
,
remain
in
place
.
we
must
ensure
that
,
in
tandem
with
the
work
the
minister
have
undertake
with
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
we
begin
the
process
to
establish
a
regulator
and
that
we
all
work
towards
the
main
objective
,
which
be
to
change
the
behaviour
of
how
we
dispose
of
we
waste
in
a
manner
that
give
certainty
to
consumer
so
that
if
they
make
this
shift
and
decide
to
participate
in
the
good
management
of
waste
,
they
will
not
be
penalise
and
goug
by
unscrupulous
operator
.
I
congratulate
the
Green
Party
on
bring
forward
this
proposal
.
the
Green
Party
itself
would
argue
that
this
be
a
iterative
process
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
,
in
particular
,
for
he
speech
.
while
there
may
be
a
healthy
degree
of
scepticism
,
concern
or
question
about
the
legislation
,
the
Minister
of
State
also
pose
a
particular
set
of
practical
and
reasonable
question
that
we
all
would
want
to
address
to
ensure
that
if
it
be
to
happen
,
such
a
scheme
would
be
devise
in
the
most
cost
-
effective
way
and
in
a
way
that
can
be
future
-
proof
.
to
go
back
to
some
basic
point
,
it
be
important
to
reiterate
what
we
be
try
to
do
on
this
little
island
be
respond
in
we
own
way
to
a
what
be
a
global
crisis
,
in
particular
in
term
of
the
production
of
plastic
.
a
article
by
journalist
Sandra
Laville
and
Matthew
Taylor
appear
on
the
online
version
of
the
Guardian
on
Wednesday
,
28
June
.
I
be
reiterate
some
of
what
deputy
Ryan
say
here
.
the
article
state
that
a
million
plastic
bottle
be
buy
around
the
world
every
minute
and
that
the
figure
will
jump
by
another
20
%
by
2021
.
it
state
that
more
than
480
billion
plastic
drinking
bottle
be
sell
in
2016
and
that
this
be
up
from
300
billion
a
decade
ago
.
as
we
know
,
most
bottle
use
for
soft
drink
and
water
be
make
from
polyethylene
terephthalate
,
which
be
recyclable
,
but
,
the
article
continue
,
as
they
use
soar
across
the
globe
,
it
be
impossible
to
keep
apace
with
that
use
by
collect
and
recycle
they
in
order
to
keep
they
from
pollute
in
the
way
that
they
do
,
in
particular
the
ocean
.
deputy
Catherine
Martin
refer
to
microplastic
and
plastic
work
they
way
into
the
food
chain
through
fish
and
so
on
.
the
article
note
Plymouth
University
have
report
that
plastic
be
find
in
one
third
of
UK
-
catch
fish
,
include
cod
,
haddock
,
mackerel
and
shellfish
,
and
that
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
have
call
for
urgent
research
,
cite
increase
concern
for
human
health
and
food
safety
.
therefore
,
it
be
not
just
a
environmental
issue
;
it
be
a
human
health
issue
too
.
the
authority
call
for
this
research
"
give
the
potential
for
microplastic
pollution
in
edible
tissue
of
commercial
fish
"
.
plastic
cannot
be
assimilate
into
the
food
chain
.
that
be
self
-
evident
.
we
know
that
.
where
they
be
ingest
,
they
carry
toxin
that
work
they
way
quite
literally
onto
we
plate
.
what
we
have
here
be
a
rare
outbreak
of
co-operation
and
we
should
embrace
it
.
I
understand
the
government
have
legitimate
question
about
the
inherent
cost
but
the
legislation
can
be
work
on
.
it
be
a
legislative
process
so
it
be
a
iterative
process
.
I
would
also
welcome
any
move
to
work
with
entity
such
as
retail
Ireland
and
Repak
.
it
be
time
for
we
,
as
a
parliament
,
to
re-engage
with
Repak
,
perhaps
through
the
committee
structure
,
because
we
have
legitimate
question
.
the
minister
refer
specifically
to
Repak
when
speak
about
the
producer
responsibility
compliance
scheme
.
there
be
a
review
in
2014
,
when
we
be
in
government
,
but
,
to
quote
the
minister
:
[
a
]
wide
examination
of
issue
within
the
packaging
sphere
be
undertake
and
consideration
be
give
to
the
introduction
of
a
bring
-
back
scheme
for
waste
,
include
beverage
container
.
the
review
report
do
not
recommend
the
introduction
of
a
deposit
and
refund
scheme
,
conclude
that
to
establish
such
a
scheme
be
inappropriate
.
I
be
perplex
by
the
use
of
the
word
"
inappropriate
"
in
view
of
the
operation
of
the
exist
packaging
scheme
and
policy
concern
household
waste
collection
plus
the
high
administrative
cost
of
introduce
such
a
scheme
.
both
the
minister
and
the
Minister
of
State
have
speak
to
the
potential
cost
,
which
be
something
we
have
to
grapple
with
in
a
pragmatic
way
.
however
,
it
be
worth
we
while
to
kick
the
tyre
,
if
one
will
,
on
the
work
that
Repak
do
.
this
be
very
positive
work
to
which
we
all
subscribe
but
a
close
examination
of
it
would
be
a
worthwhile
exercise
.
we
also
need
to
engage
with
the
beverage
company
.
I
nip
out
during
the
debate
for
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
Member
's
bar
.
while
there
I
notice
that
all
the
bottle
behind
the
bar
be
glass
bottle
.
they
be
all
reuse
and
recycle
.
I
be
not
sure
what
mechanism
or
economic
model
be
use
by
the
big
drink
company
in
term
of
they
pricing
but
I
be
sure
the
cost
of
recycling
and
reuse
be
price
into
the
product
for
the
end
user
.
for
the
record
,
I
be
drink
tea
.
if
one
go
into
a
bar
or
any
good
hostelry
and
look
behind
the
bar
,
alcoholic
or
non-alcoholic
beverage
be
not
be
sell
out
of
a
plastic
container
but
a
glass
container
.
if
that
can
be
do
in
all
the
bar
in
Ireland
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
move
towards
a
glass
-
base
approach
for
the
beverage
that
be
sell
by
what
I
call
the
multiple
in
this
country
,
that
be
,
by
the
supermarket
.
if
we
be
imaginative
and
think
laterally
about
how
we
want
to
proceed
,
we
can
achieve
a
lot
.
however
,
this
go
back
to
the
fact
it
be
impossible
at
the
moment
to
keep
apace
with
the
level
of
production
of
plastic
.
there
be
more
be
produce
than
be
be
recycle
.
we
need
to
do
something
.
there
need
to
be
some
positive
disruption
to
that
dynamic
.
we
be
a
maritime
nation
and
,
as
one
,
we
may
think
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
the
Irish
Sea
,
St.
George
's
Channel
and
the
Celtic
Sea
-
however
one
might
want
to
term
that
passage
of
water
-
be
pristine
.
however
,
as
someone
who
have
a
interest
in
sea-
kayaking
,
I
see
on
the
water
first
hand
the
amount
of
plastic
that
end
up
in
we
ocean
and
,
ultimately
,
in
we
food
chain
.
we
do
not
want
to
go
there
from
a
public
health
point
of
view
.
for
all
sort
of
environmental
reason
,
we
need
to
be
smart
about
this
.
this
type
of
co-operation
across
party
political
boundary
be
important
,
especially
on
a
issue
that
unite
we
all
.
I
reiterate
we
congratulation
to
the
Green
Party
on
bring
forward
this
proposal
.
excellent
.
excellent
.
there
be
a
need
to
ensure
that
certain
capital
expenditure
project
be
give
priority
.
I
refer
the
House
to
a
report
commission
by
Cork
and
Limerick
chamber
of
commerce
on
the
need
for
investment
in
the
M20
Limerick
-
Cork
motorway
,
entitle
gear
up
for
M20
:
a
Route
to
success
.
the
report
,
compile
by
Indecon
and
Red
C
,
be
a
detailed
assessment
and
contain
some
very
pertinent
figure
.
one
need
to
recognise
the
action
plan
for
job
,
the
need
for
balance
regional
investment
and
the
need
to
ensure
the
economy
grow
in
the
region
.
there
be
major
challenge
for
young
people
look
to
buy
house
in
the
east
of
the
country
where
a
lot
of
FDI
investment
be
take
place
and
there
be
major
capacity
constraint
in
transport
,
as
well
as
quality
of
life
issue
.
we
need
to
disrupt
the
balance
in
favour
of
the
region
and
this
report
be
very
apposite
and
timely
.
the
report
state
there
be
a
significant
role
for
the
M20
in
enhance
the
environment
for
foreign
direct
investment
and
indigenous
investment
and
that
it
have
the
potential
to
support
a
estimate
4000
-
5400
direct
job
in
the
region
.
it
state
,
"
in
gross
term
exclude
displacement
impact
,
this
additional
direct
job
could
provide
a
annual
gross
exchequer
impact
of
up
to
€
128
million
,
depend
on
the
nature
of
investment
attract
.
"
one
can
parse
that
figure
in
any
way
one
want
but
common
sense
tell
we
that
a
proper
regional
investment
in
infrastructure
will
bring
with
it
a
economic
multiplier
in
the
form
of
job
.
I
ask
the
government
to
consider
open
up
Kerry
,
Cork
,
Limerick
,
Galway
,
Sligo
and
Donegal
in
the
north
-
west
region
,
what
use
to
be
know
as
the
Atlantic
corridor
,
in
the
capital
plan
.
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Shane
Ross
,
tell
I
on
16
November
2016
there
have
be
approval
of
€
1
million
for
early
work
on
the
scheme
.
I
welcome
that
,
because
there
have
be
cross-party
lobbying
for
the
initial
funding
to
get
the
project
under
way
.
he
say
,
however
,
that
the
approval
to
commence
planning
and
design
and
statutory
order
would
cost
between
€
12
million
and
€
15
million
.
Stage
3
,
the
approval
of
the
business
case
by
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
will
not
cost
anything
while
stage
4
,
the
approval
to
submit
the
propose
development
to
a
Bord
Pleanála
,
will
cost
between
€
150
million
and
€
180
million
and
the
approval
to
commence
construction
will
cost
between
€600
million
and
€650
million
.
this
figure
be
from
late
2016
but
they
give
a
fair
indication
of
the
cost
of
the
project
and
I
be
make
the
pitch
for
it
today
.
I
recognise
that
I
be
in
the
presence
of
a
minister
from
the
same
region
and
from
the
county
which
devise
this
report
.
politically
,
if
we
can
all
get
to
stage
2
,
3
or
4
in
the
current
capital
plan
to
keep
it
on
the
agenda
,
it
have
the
potential
to
deliver
a
massive
economic
return
on
investment
in
that
region
.
there
be
cross
-party
support
for
it
and
I
hope
the
government
will
bring
it
a
step
further
in
the
current
capital
plan
.
there
be
no
point
in
try
to
hold
the
tide
back
.
the
digital
economy
be
grow
,
and
either
a
Post
will
be
a
part
of
that
or
it
will
not
.
more
State
and
non-State
service
will
go
online
.
if
we
intend
to
use
the
old
a
Post
model
,
then
a
Post
will
be
in
very
serious
difficulty
.
the
digital
economy
present
significant
opportunity
.
this
be
not
just
a
question
of
provide
service
,
include
digital
one
,
to
old
people
.
what
can
we
do
to
bring
young
people
into
post
office
?
it
should
not
be
the
case
that
the
only
time
any
of
we
go
to
a
post
office
be
at
Christmas
or
during
the
summer
for
foreign
exchange
or
passport
purpose
.
what
will
bring
the
next
generation
into
post
office
?
the
parcel
service
will
be
one
aspect
of
that
,
as
will
banking
and
other
financial
service
.
there
be
significant
opportunity
for
the
company
in
that
regard
.
thanks
to
the
commitment
agreement
that
I
have
pen
with
Eir
,
97
%
of
post
office
will
have
direct
access
to
high
-
speed
broadband
within
the
next
75
week
.
this
be
a
significant
opportunity
to
be
exploit
by
the
post
office
network
.
the
digital
economy
be
grow
.
currently
,
Irish
people
be
spend
€
14000
every
minute
.
the
sad
part
about
it
be
that
€
10000
of
that
be
be
spend
on
goods
and
service
from
outside
Ireland
.
this
year
,
the
digital
market
in
Europe
be
worth
€600
million
.
there
be
considerable
opportunity
for
business
at
every
crossroad
in
Ireland
to
exploit
that
situation
.
in
order
to
do
so
,
they
must
have
access
to
a
accessible
postal
service
.
that
can
be
available
.
the
front
office
be
the
local
post
office
and
the
back
office
be
the
parcel
service
through
the
mail
centre
across
the
country
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
it
seem
to
I
that
week
on
week
,
more
and
more
deputy
be
be
exclude
from
this
process
because
of
the
time
constraint
.
be
there
any
way
that
we
can
facilitate
time
in
this
house
for
this
very
important
segment
?
we
all
have
a
number
of
issue
to
raise
.
I
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
we
to
review
the
practice
and
procedure
of
this
House
.
it
would
allow
for
more
deputy
to
be
include
in
the
process
.
in
accordance
with
stand

the
deputy
be
now
eat
into
everybody
else
's
time
.
it
be
just
selfish
.
I
have
a
technical
question
.
the
Maritime
Area
and
Foreshore
(
amendment
)
Bill
be
on
the
long
list
.
the
government
have
give
some
indication
that
it
would
legislate
for
the
prohibition
of
micro-plastic
in
that
Bill
.
I
would
like
the
government
to
clarify
when
it
will
legislate
for
that
.
I
have
a
Bill
that
be
due
before
committee
.
the
ten
-
week
window
have
long
since
pass
.
I
have
say
to
the
government
that
I
be
willing
to
wait
for
the
publication
of
its
legislation
and
that
I
will
be
happy
to
withdraw
mine
if
it
pass
muster
.
that
still
have
not
happen
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
government
's
propose
Bill
?
in

it

the
official

deputy
Stanley

can
I
just
have
some
guidance
before
the
minister
answer
?
I
think
that
this
question
be
in
a
grouping
,
a
lea
-
Cheann

.
how
will
this
now
be
handle
?
forgive
I
.
there
be
three

on

,

have

just
to
clarify
,
deputy
Stanley
will
respond
to
the
minister
's
answer
to
he
and
then
-----
I
want
to
focus
on
the
procurement
process
.
notwithstanding
what
I
believe
to
be
the
minister
's
bona
fide
in
seek
to
get
this
project
over
the
line
,
and
I
believe
he
to
be
genuine
,
we
be
get
bombard
with
metric
,
statistic
and
the
use
of
a
language
that
for
many
people
who
do
not
have
broadband
be
indecipherable
in
term
of
the
political
rhetoric
around
this
.
the
first
question
I
have
be
very
simple
.
do
EU
rule
on
procurement
allow
the
minister
to
descope
or
make
a
tender
less
attractive
to
certain
vendor
,
thus
favour
other
while
the
tender
process
be
live
?
if
SIRO
have
pull
out
of
this
process
,
what
be
to
stop
it
or
any
other
bidder
,
who
might
not
partake
in
this
tender
,
from
look
at
the
legal
position
and
say
it
sign
up
to
a
process
and
the
minister
,
the
State
or
the
government
have
now
make
that
process
less
attractive
for
it
as
a
tenderer
or
bidder
and
why
should
it
not
take
legal
action
to
protect
the
investment
and
commitment
it
have
make
?
the
public
be
confused
and
I
be
confused
because
I
do
not
believe
that
the
transparency
and
the
information
that
we
require
on
this
be
adequate
at
this
time
.
I
do
not
believe
it
be
right
for
the
minister
to
use
the
cover
of
the
fact
that
this
be
a
competitive
tendering
process
.
as
deputy
Dooley
say
,
it
be
down
to
two
entity
at
this
stage
.
the
minister
can
hardly
use
the
cover
of
the
tendering
process
in
the
language
he
be
use
to
explain
the
process
itself
.
what
be
the
original
EU
rule
on
procurement
?
what
be
the
language
that
be
use
by
the
State
in
regard
to
the
EU
so
as
to
protect
that
people
who
have
now
come
out
of
the
process
on
the
basis
that
the
original
tender
be
less
than
what
be
articulate
and
advise
to
they
in
the
first
instance
?
the
minister
do
not
answer
the
question
about
-----
the
minister
mention
the
auction
for
the
3.6
ghz
spectrum
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
justification
for
it
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
not
a
definitive
definition
of
5g
at
this
point
in
time
.
there
be
no
proper
definition
because
the
technology
be
move
at
such
a
quick
pace
and
the
innovation
cycle
be
get
a
lot
short
.
what
be
the
justification
for
the
auction
?
what
permutation
will
that
auction
have
and
how
will
it
impact
the
provision
for
communication
for
the
Garda
and
the
emergency
service
in
the
country
?
will
they
be
adversely
affect
as
a
result
of
the
auction
?
we
have
not
have
in
the
minister
's
own
word
a
explanation
or
a
understanding
from
he
perspective
as
to
why
one
of
the
bidder
pull
out
.
we
have
read
a
lot
in
the
press
but
we
,
in
this
house
,
as
I
understand
it
,
have
not
hear
directly
from
the
minister
himself
as
to
he
perspective
on
why
SIRO
pull
the
plug
.
in
he
own
word
-----
I
ask
a
question
about
the
auction
of
the
3.6
Ghz
spectrum
.
what
be
5G
?

I
support
the
resolution
without
question
.
I
wish
to
speak
briefly
on
the
issue
of
smoking
cessation
and
public
health
policy
in
that
regard
,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
cost
of
nicotine
replacement
therapy
.
in
he
annual
consideration
of
matter
relate
to
the
rate
of
tax
on
tobacco
product
,
will
the
minister
give
consideration
to
the
cost
of
nicotine
replacement
therapy
?
there
be
a
myriad
of
product
sell
in
pharmacy
at
exorbitant
price
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
pharmacy
be
price
taker
from
the
pharmaceutical
sector
in
this
regard
but
the
product
available
be
extremely
costly
.
it
have
be
argue
that
one
be
replace
one
addiction
with
another
.
I
ask
the
government
to
consider
further
examination
of
the
sheer
cost
people
incur
when
they
be
try
to
give
up
smoking
by
move
to
nicotine
replacement
therapy
.
the
cost
of
that
therapy
should
be
examine
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
inland
revenue
(
include
value
-
add
tax
and
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.
the
budget
contain
no
central
message
other
than
self
-
preservation
.
however
,
it
could
not
have
be
otherwise
because
the
government
be
afraid
to
make
choice
.
beholden
to
Fianna
Fáil
,
the
government
ensure
that
every
sector
receive
a
gesture
.
a
former
Fianna
Fáil
minister
for
Finance
be
at
the
heart
of
this
budget
.
it
be
a
tribute
to
Charlie
McCreevy
in
every
respect
,
right
down
to
reduction
in
income
tax
be
pay
for
by
tax
revenue
raise
on
property
transaction
.
however
,
a
person
who
earn
€
30000
a
year
will
now
get
a
extra
€
2
per
week
.
we
have
be
down
this
road
before
and
we
know
how
it
end
.
last
night
,
the
Taoiseach
say
he
would
not
bring
we
back
to
boom
and
bust
but
the
core
message
of
the
budget
hark
back
to
the
day
of
McCreevy
economics
.
like
a
bad
tribute
act
,
the
government
will
keep
pretend
that
everyone
can
be
give
a
tax
cut
and
spending
on
service
can
be
increase
at
the
same
time
.
the
myth
that
one
can
be
all
thing
to
all
people
have
be
resurrect
in
this
budget
.
let
we
end
the
pretence
.
when
it
come
to
the
hard
tack
of
politics
and
the
big
political
event
of
the
year
,
together
,
march
hand
in
hand
,
go
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
.
Fianna
Fáil
be
yesterday
so
desperate
to
have
something
to
say
that
it
resort
to
attack
other
in
opposition
,
as
it
have
do
again
today
.
Fianna
Fáil
be
in
coalition
with
Fine
Gael
in
all
but
name
.
it
be
claim
credit
for
nearly
every
measure
in
the
budget
and
,
as
I
say
,
the
shadow
of
McCreevy
loom
large
.
the
sum
in
the
budget
barely
add
up
.
last
night
,
the
Taoiseach
pledge
that
sustainable
step
will
be
take
but
that
be
the
spin
the
Opposition
have
come
to
expect
,
as
prove
by
the
expenditure
of
€
5
million
on
a
communication
unit
.
as
all
member
know
,
budget
measure
such
as
stamp
duty
increase
that
have
a
commercial
or
market
-
move
impact
be
introduce
on
budget
night
by
financial
resolution
.
the
government
attempt
to
imply
that
the
financial
resolution
on
stamp
duty
be
put
in
place
last
night
to
avoid
lobbying
from
the
property
sector
that
might
undermine
the
measure
.
however
,
if
it
have
not
be
bring
in
immediately
,
hundred
of
property
deal
to
the
value
of
million
of
euro
would
have
be
conduct
in
advance
of
its
implementation
.
the
more
serious
issue
be
the
leak
,
day
in
advance
of
the
budget
,
of
the
information
that
stamp
duty
would
be
increase
.
that
be
commercially
-
sensitive
information
of
the
kind
that
make
people
rush
deal
through
.
the
government
and
the
Department
of
Finance
have
serious
question
to
answer
about
that
leak
.
how
many
million
of
euro
in
potential
revenue
be
lose
?
how
many
option
for
land
be
sign
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
in
advance
of
the
financial
resolution
?
what
revenue
have
the
State
lose
out
on
?
other
serious
question
regard
stamp
duty
that
highlight
the
shadow
of
McCreevy
that
loom
over
this
budget
have
be
ask
.
will
the
€376
million
it
be
expect
to
raise
through
this
measure
actually
materialise
?
Industry
have
its
doubt
.
in
2015
and
2016
,
commercial
property
stamp
duty
receipt
be
inflate
.
there
be
serious
question
about
the
fiscal
sustainability
of
how
the
minister
for
Finance
fund
he
budget
.
if
the
Opposition
party
build
a
budget
on
the
kind
of
measure
announce
yesterday
,
it
would
be
laugh
out
of
court
.
half
of
the
extra
budget
revenue
be
build
on
a
potentially
volatile
property
transaction
.
it
be
also
base
on
a
growth
in
gdp
of
3
%
which
may
or
may
not
materialise
.
the
shadow
of
Brexit
loom
large
over
the
potential
in
that
regard
.
another
€
150
million
be
base
on
restriction
to
corporation
tax
,
which
will
impact
upon
intellectual
property
.
it
do
not
get
more
volatile
than
that
.
if
a
Opposition
party
say
it
would
raise
a
extra
€
100
million
on
tax
compliance
,
it
would
be
mock
as
have
make
up
the
number
.
yesterday
,
the
government
find
this
money
down
the
proverbial
back
of
the
sofa
,
with
€
50
million
relate
to
paye
compliance
,
€30
million
for
business
compliance
and
€
20
million
in
respect
of
tax
avoidance
.
this
beg
serious
question
as
to
how
much
revenue
be
not
be
collect
.
when
cost
tobacco
increase
,
we
be
tell
by
the
Department
of
Finance
that
this
measure
would
be
mostly
revenue
-
neutral
.
however
,
the
government
be
rely
on
€
64
million
to
come
in
from
this
year
's
tax
increase
.
we
also
seriously
question
the
amount
the
government
expect
to
raise
on
the
national
training
fund
levy
.
just
last
week
,
the
Department
of
Finance
tell
we
that
a
0.1
%
increase
in
the
national
training
fund
levy
would
yield
€
42.5
million
.
yesterday
,
the
minister
for
Finance
say
he
expect
to
get
€
58
million
in
2018
and
€
63
million
in
a
full
year
from
the
same
tax
increase
.
I
would
like
to
know
,
on
the
basis
of
what
the
Department
tell
we
week
ago
,
from
where
the
extra
€
20
million
come
.
when
one
look
at
where
the
minister
be
get
he
money
,
it
be
clear
that
the
sum
do
not
add
up
.
all
that
matter
for
now
,
however
,
be
keep
the
show
on
the
road
for
another
year
.
the
government
preach
prudence
and
no
return
to
boom
and
bust
,
but
McCreevy
economics
be
again
at
the
heart
of
this
budget
.
ten
year
on
from
the
beginning
of
the
financial
crisis
,
Fine
Gael
and
Fianna
Fáil
be
take
we
back
down
a
unsustainable
,
imprudent
and
dangerous
path
.
funding
cut
with
volatile
tax
revenue
and
pad
out
the
sum
to
ensure
they
do
not
add
up
.
have
we
learn
nothing
?
for
that
with
a
family
member
on
a
waiting
list
or
people
try
to
buy
or
rent
a
home
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
budget
to
resolve
they
problem
.
on
health
,
only
one
real
policy
have
be

by
this

-
year
fully
cost
plan
to
implement
publicly
-
fund
child
care
be
publish
in
May
with
cross
-party
support
.
there
be
no
mention
of
Sláintecare
in
the
budget
or
of
implement
the
first
year
of
the
programme
which
,
all
in
all
,
be
quite
modest
.
yesterday
,
Fine
Gael
abandon
Sláintecare
.
have
it
now
be
abandon
by
Fianna
Fáil
?
in
its
alternative
budget
,
Labour
commit
to
fund
the
first
-
year
implementation
of
Sláintecare
.
what
this
would
mean
,
in
practice
,
be
the
removal
of
inpatient
hospital
charge
and
a
reduction
in
prescription
charge
.
it
would
expand
the
provision
of
home
care
package
and
home
help
hour
,
increase
service
for
people
with
disability
and
add
a
extra
€
25
million
for
mental
health
in
the
first
year
.
instead
,
what
this
government
do
to
tackle
waiting
list
of
over
600,000
be
to
allocate
a
extra
€
30
million
for
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
,
bring
it
to
€
55
million
.
this
will
be
welcome
for
that
who
will
benefit
from
it
but
,
in
reality
,
it
mean
less
funding
for
public
health
service
and
a
drop
in
the
ocean
in
real
term
in
respect
of
the
waiting
list
figure
.
in
theory
,
it
be
a
extra
€685
million
on
top
of
the
amount
allocate
to
health
in
2017
but
,
if
one
look
at
the
number
,
it
be
really
only
a
extra
€
269
million
for
service
and
new
measure
.
the
reason
for
this
be
that
most
of
the
increase
will
be
for
staff
cost
and
the
€300
million
deficit
that
will
be
carry
over
from
this
year
.
family

about
they

or
ill
parent
will
be
able
to
buy
the
proverbial
cup
of
coffee
while
they
wait
at
the
accident
and
emergency
department
.
at
the
heart
of
this
budget
be
a
lack
of
ambition
to
resolve
the
problem
Irish
people
face
by
invest
in
public
service
.
the
sad
reality
of
budget
2018
be
that
no
real
extra
money
be
be
provide
to
build
new
social
housing
.
there
be
no
effort
to
provide
a
affordable
housing
scheme
.
we
hear
the
question
from
young
people
on
"
Prime
Time
"
last
night
:
what
use
be
a
extra
€
5
a
week
in
a
tax
cut
if
they
cannot
afford
to
pay
they
rent
or
even
get
on
the
first
step
of
the
housing
ladder
?
the
focus
should
be
on
public
service
and
address
the
real
cris
that
people
face
.
this
budget
do
nothing
to
resolve
the
central
problem
face
young
family
across
Ireland
,
but
particularly
in
we
city
,
and
that
in
work
who
be
try
to
get
by
,
who
try
to
raise
family
and
who
be
struggle
to
cope
with
rocket
rent
and
rise
home
price
.
there
have
be
no
effort
to
provide
affordable
home
for
sale
or
rent
,
no
tax
on
vacant
housing
and
no
additional
funding
for
public
housing
.
we
have
a
fail
housing
market
and
it
be
time
for
action
from
the
State
to
address
it
.
the
capital
allocation
on
which
the
Minister
for
Finance
focus
yesterday
be
already
provide
for
under
the
Action
plan
for
Housing
and
Homelessness
.
the
number
have
already
be
announce
many
time
,
include
by
the
minister
's
predecessor
.
under
Rebuilding
Ireland
,
the
plan
be
for
5,900
unit
to
be
build
or
buy
under
part
V
.
that
be
exactly
the
same
number
announce
yesterday
.
Labour
propose
a
cost
increase
of
a
additional
5000
public
housing
unit
build
on
publicly
-
own
land
.
we
have
700
site
available
to
do
this
.
this
be
the
crisis
that
the
budget
ignore
.
the
follow
be
the
breakdown
of
what
the
State
intend
to
provide
next
year
:
3800
home
will
be
build
directly
by
the
State
;
1200
will
be
part
V
build
or
rebuild
vacant
home
;
900
home
will
be
deliver
through
acquisition
;
and
a
further
2000
home
will
be
secure
through
long
-
term
leasing
arrangement
.
that
be
a
total
of
7,900
.
can
anyone
tell
I
from
where
in
the
private
rental
market
a
extra
2000
unit
for
social
housing
will
actually
come
?
this
be
why
the
government
have
try
to
massage
the
number
of
home
provide
and
hide
its
failure
on
housing
provision
by
allocate
a
extra
€
31
million
,
which
will
be
provide
for
the
sheer
purpose
of
rent
within
the
private
sphere
.
this
just
confirm
that
the
only
real
extra
money
be
for
landlord
.
there
be
a
extra
€
149
million
for
HAP
.
we
have
a
supply
-
side
crisis
and
the
government
's
response
be
to
allocate
more
money
for
rent
.
what
be
need
be
direct
state
action
.
as
well
as
there
not
be
any
plan
for
a
national
affordable
housing
scheme
,
we
have
also
see
a
miss
opportunity
to
repurpose
NAMA
to
take
the
lead
on
the
development
of
affordable
housing
for
the
State
through
approve
housing
body
.
instead
,
under
the
newly
name
Housing
Building
Finance
Ireland
,
or
HBFI
,
as
the
minister
call
it
yesterday
,
the
€750
million
be
divert
be
come
from
the
Ireland
Strategic
investment
Fund
,
another
private
finance
vehicle
for
developer
,
with
no
assurance
that
any
housing
build
will
actually
be
affordable
,
and
there
be
the
rub
.
we
welcome
the
move
to
increase
the
vacant
site
tax
,
though
we
have
call
for
it
to
be
bring
forward
by
a
year
and
we
be
disappointed
that
it
will
not
come
into
force
until
2019
.
there
be
no
mention
of
a
vacant
home
tax
,
despite
it
be
name
as
one
of
the
main
priority
of
the
new
housing
minister
on
he
appointment
by
the
Taoiseach
.
with
more
than
100000
home
lie
vacant
across
the
country
,
this
would
surely
have
be
a
easy
political
win
for
the
minister
.
for
that
who
be
homeless
,
that
struggle
to
rent
and
that
desperate
to
buy
a
home
for
they
family
,
it
be
tragic
that
the
government
have
totally
waste
the
opportunity
to
directly
fund
home
for
that
who
need
it
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
where
the
extra
money
for
the
disability
sector
be
.
there
be
no
additional
money
for
emergency
respite
accommodation
or
for
child
await
assessment
of
need
.
in
the
headline
figure
for
the
health
budget
,
I
see
only
a
additional
€
15
million
for
disability
provision
.
it
state
the
provision
of
service
and
support
for
child
and
young
people
with
a
disability
throughout
they
childhood
and
as
they
transition
to
adulthood
continue
to
be
a
priority
and
be
a
key
component
of
the
programme
for
government
.
this
€
15
million
be
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
be
write
in
term
of
the
need
that
arise
in
this
sector
and
it
will
not
facilitate
adherence
to
the
Disability
Act
or
meet
the
government
's
legal
obligation
to
ensure
people
have
a
timely
assessment
of
need
as
and
when
they
need
it
.
independent
minister
threaten
to
go
out
onto
the
plinth
and
say
they
will
retire
if
they
do
not
get
funding
and
I
see
a
lot
of
posturing
over
this
issue
but
I
see
no
evidence
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
have
deliver
anything
in
this
budget
for
the
disability
sector
.
I
be
sure
he
will
have
a
opportunity
to
come
into
the
Chamber
and
rebut
what
I
be
say
but
I
be
look
at
the
expenditure
report
for
2018
,
which
be
the
government
's
own
document
,
and
I
see
nothing
that
speak
to
the
need
of
people
wait
for
assessment
or
that
will
give
comfort
to
the
disability
sector
,
whose
demand
be
set
out
in
legislation
and
be
there
as
of
right
.
I
also
see
nothing
on
the
access
to
emergency
respite
for
people
with
intellectual
disability
.
as
people
grow
old
we
have
see
a
grow
need
for
emergency
respite
care
for
people
with
intellectual
disability
but
I
see
no
additionality
for
that
particular
budget
.
if
I
be
ask
by
the
people
I
represent
where
the
additional
money
be
for
emergency
bed
,
I
will
have
to
tell
they
there
be
no
evidence
of
they
.
that
be
a
failure
of
delivery
on
the
part
of
a
minister
who
have
say
a
lot
about
what
he
be
go
to
deliver
for
the
sector
but
have
not
deliver
anything
of
substance
or
that
will
even
make
a
small
impact
on
its
need
.
the
National
Federation
of
voluntary
Bodie
could
not
,
by
any
objective
analysis
,
state
that
there
be
anything
new
for
people
with
disability
in
this
budget
.
this
be
suppose
to
be
a
republic
of
opportunity
,
which
assist
people
who
get
up
early
,
who
have
they
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
who
do
a
hard
day
's
work
or
whatever
glib
soundbite
du
jour
one
wish
to
use
but
this
budget
have
forget
people
who
be
still
marginalise
in
society
and
who
deserve
more
.
I
stand
indict
as
a
minister
in
the
last
government
when
,
with
the
coffer
not
exactly
full
,
we
have
to
make
serious
cut
but
the
current
government
be
turn
a
corner
,
get
3
%
growth
and
give
minimal
amount
of
money
back
to
people
in
tax
cut
.
consequently
,
€50
million
or
€
100
million
could
have
make
a
serious
dent
in
meet
the
need
of
that
people
whose
voice
be
not
as
strong
as
that
of
we
in
this
House
.
this
be
a
miss
opportunity
and
the
idea
of
a
republic
of
opportunity
clearly
only
pertain
to
some
in
society
.
I
be
very
disappointed
that
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
in
this
area
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
have
not
deliver
anything
across
the
disability
sector
,
despite
he
rhetoric
.
it
be
shameful
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
deputy
Zappone
,
in
respect
of
child
care
.
it
would
be
easy
to
say
there
have
not
be
any
progress
on
this
issue
but
a
7
%
increase
in
capitation
will
have
a
positive
impact
.
there
be
also
€
20
million
for
the
early
childhood
care
and
education
,
ecce
,
scheme
and
a
extension
to
two
year
.
this
be
positive
,
incremental
change
to
child
care
,
which
I
welcome
,
but
we
cannot
disregard
the
fact
that
some
people
be
still
pay
€
1000
per
month
for
child
care
,
which
be
not
tenable
.
I
agree
that
there
be
much
to
be
do
to
build
capacity
within
the
sector
and
the
voice
of
the
sector
be
very
strong
in
the
run-up
to
the
budget
,
as
it
lobby
for
recognition
of
the
talent
at
its
disposal
to
provide
its
service
.
more
could
have
be
do
,
however
,
in
term
of
pay
the
appropriate
wage
to
the
highly
-
qualified
worker
in
the
sector
and
there
be
some
work
to
be
do
by
all
of
we
to
assist
that
process
.
we
have
to
look
at
the
possibility
of
sectoral
employment
order
in
this
regard
.
we
await
the
minister
's
justification
of
the
€
40
million
spend
allocate
to
Tusla
but
we
need
to
build
out
a
child
care
sector
throughout
the
country
,
whether
one
live
in
Dublin
,
Ballydehob
,
Sligo
or
north
Cork
.
there
need
to
be
a
equivalent
standard
across
the
sector
and
equality
in
rate
of
pay
and
capitation
.
much
have
be
make
about
the
living
wage
for
child
care
worker
and
we
advocate
a
standard
minimum
wage
,
while
that
with
additional
skill
and
qualification
should
be
pay
commensurately
.
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
how
the
€
40
million
for
Tusla
will
be
allocate
.
there
be
much
to
be
do
in
regard
to
how
Tusla
operate
and
for
many
in
this
House
,
there
remain
a
lack
of
transparency
about
what
exactly
Tusla
do
.
I
be
not
criticise
it
but
there
be
work
to
be
do
on
its
part
.
anecdotally
,
I
hear
story
of
burnout
within
the
social
work
field
.
I
hear
story
about
a
lack
of
capacity
in
certain
area
of
child
protection
and
within
the
whole
Child
and
Family
Agency
umbrella
.
we
need
to
hear
from
the
minister
exactly
what
will
be
achieve
through
the
use
of
the
extra
€
40
million
.
this
be
a
overlying
budget
of
€
754
million
,
which
be
quite
a
lot
of
money
.
we
need
to
see
more
with
regard
to
domestic
,
sexual
and
gender
-
base
violence
.
we
need
to
see
exactly
what
be
go
to
be
do
on
the
school
completion
programme
.
we
need
to
see
what
be
go
to
be
achieve
on
mandatory
reporting
and
how
the
family
resource
centre
be
go
to
be
fund
.
I
understand
there
will
be
a
expansion
of
the
family
resource
centre
but
we
need
to
see
where
that
expansion
will
take
place
and
how
they
will
be
able
to
meet
the
need
within
they
community
.
there
be
good
element
in
this
budget
but
there
be
still
a
lot
of
question
out
there
as
to
what
exactly
the
government
have
announce
.
it
be
worthy
of
further
interrogation
.
I
shall
now
turn
to
the
issue
face
old
people
.
one
of
the
big
issue
face
we
be
the
ability
of
the
State
to
have
in
place
a
nursing
home
support
scheme
that
will
reflect
the
fact
that
Ireland
have
a
ageing
population
.
family
be
increasingly
under
tremendous
strain
in
respect
of
they
love
one
when
the
time
come
to
either
live
independently
into
they
elder
year
or
be
facilitate
in
a
nursing
home
.
we
must
have
a
proper
debate
about
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
,
NTPF
.
there
have
be
a
increase
of
€
35
million
in
the
allocation
to
the
NTPF
in
this
budget
.
again
,
I
be
not
sure
what
impact
that
will
have
for
people
who
be
wait
for
a
bed
in
a
nursing
home
.
increasingly
we
be
hear
that
people
be
incur
additional
cost
,
even
when
they
be
in
the
nursing
home
,
and
I
do
not
see
anything
in
the
budget
that
speak
to
old
people
in
that
regard
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
look
after
we
old
people
.
I
do
not
understand
why
there
be
only
€
32
million
allocate
for
additional
care
bed
.
the
government
's
budget
document
say
that
45
additional
home
care
package
per
week
will
be
roll
out
during
the
winter
period
.
I
be
very
hopeful
that
this
be
a
typographical
error
.
if
it
amount
to
45
additional
home
care
package
per
week
,
it
be
a
absolutely
paltry
figure
and
a
derisory
sum
of
money
.
there
be
also
question
to
be
ask
around
this
.
perhaps
the
line
minister
's
official
be
listen
to
this
debate
but
to
be
honest
I
doubt
they
be
.
this
be
question
to
be
answer
.
as
for
the
rainy
day
fund
,
once
upon
a
time
we
have
a
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
which
be
de
facto
a
rainy
day
fund
,
and
this
become
the
Ireland
Strategic
investment
Fund
.
now
the
government
will
take
€
1.5
billion
out
of
that
to
seed
the
rainy
day
fund
.
once
again
this
be
a
exercise
in
optic
.
the
Ireland
Strategic
investment
Fund
have
more
than
€
5
billion
on
deposit
due
to
a
failure
by
the
government
to
invest
in
Ireland
.
now
,
instead
of
find
off
-
balance
sheet
measure
to
boost
housing
,
transport
or
broadband
provision
,
this
money
will
be
leave
on

.
this
be
while
a
budget
be
craft
on
unsustainable
tax
increase
.
there
be
much
that
have
be
leave
out
of
this
budget
.
I
would
describe
it
as
a
blancmange
budget
.
it
be
bland
,
boring
and
lack
in
energy
.
it
be
enough
to
keep
the
punter
reasonably
happy
and
it
be
hopeful
that
nobody
will
get
too
exercise
about
it
.
it
do
,
however
,
miss
a
opportunity
.
it
miss
a
opportunity
to
do
some
really
good
work
in
the
disability
sector
.
it
miss
the
opportunity
to
do
some
really
good
work
for
old
people
and
in
particular
for
that
who

nursing
home
.
the
budget
be
a
miss
opportunity
and
the
notion
that
Fine
Gael
be
representative
of
this
so
-
call
"
republic
of
opportunity
"
be
a
fallacy
.
it
be
a
misnomer

it
be
disappointing
that
the

the

include
a

for
the

the

,
as

yet
,
Ireland
have
not

the
optional

that

speak
specifically
to
the
issue
of

the

real

(
e.g.

or

)
and
personal
property
(
e.g.
intellectual
property
,
goods
and
chattel
,
and
income
)
,
or
the
lack
of
it
.
as
a
discrimination
ground
,
birth
be
see
as
cover
descent
and
inherit
status
(
e.g.
caste
)
as
well
as
that
bear
out
of
wedlock
...
a
person
's
social
and
economic
situation
when
live
in
poverty
or
be
homeless
may
result
in
pervasive
discrimination
,
stigmatization
and
negative
stereotyping
which
can
lead
to
the
refusal
of
,
or
unequal
access
to
,
the
same
quality
of
education
and
health
care
as
other
,
as
well
as
the
denial
of
or
unequal
access
to
public
place
.
we
could
extend
this
to
the
right
to
a
job
or
the
right
to
be
deem
eligible
to
apply
for
a
job
and
the
need
to
prevent
be
discriminate
against
on
the
basis
of
one
's
location
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
government
response
would
be
such
that
we
could
facilitate
a
further
teasing
out
of
the
difficulty
that
exist
in
respect
of
the
definition
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
we
have
adopt
and
ratify
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
and
the
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and

Right
,
then
I
be
at
pain
to
understand
why
the
provision
have
not
be
transpose
.
I
stand
open
to
correction
on
this
point
and
the
Minister
of
State
might
clarify
in
he
response
why
the
issue
at
hand
as
it
relate
to
this
legislation
have
not
be
deal
with
.
this
be
the
basis
on
which
we
will
support
the
legislation
.
the
culture
that
exist
in
the
House
now
be
such
that
individual
member
propose
legislation
and
it
then
go
through
a
process
of
legislative
scrutiny
.
in
this
way
we
can
at
least
facilitate
committee
stage
interaction
so
as
to
tease
out
the
issue
at
hand
and
any
difficulty
that
the
government
might
have

it
have
come
to
we
attention
today
that
a

by

the

then
it
be
incumbent
on

before

House
forthwith
.
it
seem
clear
to
I
that
he
be
absolutely
and
utterly
in
breach
of

law
.
the
Minister

must
now
consider
he
position
as

result

I
find
it
a
absolutely
shocking
situation
that
a
member
of
the
government
be
in
breach
of
such
fundamental
legislation
.
the
decision
and
finding
against
he
be
unambiguous
.
I
believe
it
put
he
position
as
a
minister
of
State
in
jeopardy
,
have
be
in
breach

and
have
break
the

for

reform
for
well
over
a
decade
and
we
have
not

from

we

for

in
a
understanding
of
why
the

and
who
lose

it
be
not

to

that

the
reason
we

this

be
a
welcome
contribution
to

ongoing
debate
.
we
support
the
general
thrust
of
it
,
although
naturally
we
have
some
concern
and
would
propose
some
change
.
at
its
heart
the
Bill
propose
to
grant
enhance
power
to
the
Policing
Authority
in
oversee
the
performance
of
the
Garda
Commissioner
and
the
Garda

.
that
much
be
desperately
need
.
the
Labour
Party
's
Garda
authority
policy
date
back
to
2006
.
we
freely
acknowledge
that
the
legislation
we
enact
in
government
,
which
finally
create
a
Policing
Authority
,
be
by
no
means
perfect
.
Fine
Gael
's
commitment
to
meaningful
reform
of
policing
in
Ireland
be
,
to
put
it
bluntly
,
questionable
,
as
be
the
commitment
of
the
permanent
administration
,
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
as
a
example
,
let
we
look
at
what
happen
to
the
2015
report
of
the
Garda
Inspectorate
.
it
propose
a
radical
shake
-
up
but
it
be
give
a
speedy
burial
by
the
Garda
Commissioner
,
the
Minister
and
the
Department
.
the
Department
simply
do
not
see
secure
Garda
accountability
as
a
core
role
.
sometimes
,
the
gardaí
's
good
friend
be
in
truth
they
bad
enemy
.
one
cannot
support
and
assist
the
Garda
Síochána
today
if
one
do
not
insist
on
hold
it
to
modern
standard
of
accountability
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
one
issue
that
continue
to
operate
as
a
impediment
to
serious
public
debate
about
the
design
of
the
institution
of
State
.
I
refer
to
the
legal
advice
to
the
previous
government
that
under
the
constitution
policing
belong
inherently
to
the
executive
branch
of
government
,
in
other
word
,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
remove
the
minister
and
the
Department
from
centre
stage
in
the
control
of
policing
.
we
have
hear
some
echo
of
that
advice
again
today
.
we
be
tell
that
the
power
of
the
independent
Policing
Authority
must
,
constitutionally
,
be
circumscribe
and
core
power
must
be
retain
in
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
I
be
all
in
favour
of
a
close
and
confidential
role
between
the
government
and
its
Attorney
General
but
when
it
come
to
legislate
for
the
oversight
of
policing
,
the
government
's
legal
advice
about
what
the
constitution
will
and
will
not
permit
cannot
be
keep
secret
from
the
legislator
.
one
cannot
stymie
desperately
need
legal
reform
by
rely
on
legal
advice
if
one
refuse
to
publish
it
.
I
say
that
because
other
eminent
lawyer
do
not
see
where
this
particular
argument
come
from
.
it
be
,
after
all
,
assert
in
the
context
of
a
constitution
that
make
no
reference
,
even
in
passing
,
to
policing
and
also
in
the
context
of
a
common
law
tradition
where
policing
be
more
usually
see
as
a
branch
of
administrative
or
local
government
law
.
if
we
look
at
other
country
with
we
legal
system
and
similar
write
constitution
,
we
can
see
police
force
operate
at
federal
,
state
,
county
and
municipal
level
.
none
of
that
state
have
encounter
the
argument
that
be
foist
on
we
here
,
namely
,
that
,
uniquely
of
all
we
service
,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
remove
policing
from
under
the
thumb
of
government
and
place
it
under
independent
oversight
.
in
particular
,
in
that
home
of
the
pure
version
of
the
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
power
,
the
United
State
of
America
,
there
be
more
police
force
than
one
could
shake
a
stick
at
and
no
one
would
seriously
argue
that
they
be
all
constitutionally
attach
to
the
executive
branch
of
government
.
this
perhaps
obscure
and
homegrown
legal
argument
be
the
reason
we
law
say
that
the
Garda
Commissioner
must
be
appoint
,
and
may
only
be
remove
from
office
,
by
the
government
.
we
need
to
get
to
the
root
of
this
legal
argument
,
which
the
government
rely
on
to
insist
that
it
must
continue
to
remain
central
to
the
control
and
management
of
policing
.
deputy
O'Callaghan
's
Bill
do
not
seek
to
do
this
.
to
the
extent
that
it
seem
to
accept
the
status
quo
,
the
Bill
be
a
stopgap
measure
.
more
generally
,
public
confidence
in
the
ability
and
credibility
of
Garda
management
have
be
seriously
undermine
.
in
particular
,
Garda
management
have
show
no
ability
to
respond
effectively
to
the
modernisation
agenda
champion
by
the
Garda
Síochána
Inspectorate
.
the
problem
here
be
not
simply
cultural
-
this
be
the
expression
senior
gardaí
often
use
-
but
structural
.
we
still
do
not
have
any
body
with
the
power
,
duty
or
capacity
to
bring
senior
Garda
management
into
the
modern
age
.
this
be
a
age
in
which
effectiveness
,
efficiency
,
openness
,
transparency
and
accountability
be
expect
and
deliver
.
thus
,
we
need
the
Policing
Authority
to
take
account
of
the
series
of
impressive
report
from
the
Garda
Síochána
Inspectorate
and
to
insist
that
they
be
implement
by
the
Garda
Commissioner
.
I
do
not
mean
simply
that
the
authority
should
supervise
the
commissioner
-
that
be
a
vague
concept
to
insert
into
statute
.
the
authority
should
have
power
,
have
adopt
a
inspectorate
report
,
to
direct
the
commissioner
,
by
order
,
to
implement
the
report
.
I
do
not
believe
all
structural
reform
must
await
the
report
of
the
Commission
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
.
nor
do
I
believe
that
the
report
the
inspectorate
have
already
publish
must
be
put
on
ice
pend
another
review
and
report
.
the
report
make
sense
and
they
should
be
implement
now
.
moreover
,
the
authority
should
be
give
the
power
to
insist
on
it
.
of
course
,
we
also
need
the
independent
policing
review
.
I
hope
it
will
be
both
radical
and
comprehensive
.
I
say
as
much
because
the
Labour
Party
's
reform
agenda
be
never
simply
about
senior
Garda
management
.
we
2006
policy
document
call
for
a
Garda
authority
and
a
new
model
of
community
policing
to
travel
hand
in
hand
.
this
initiative
have
be
ostensibly
adopt
but
they
be
both
still
very
much
work
in
progress
.
we
have
far
more
to
do
before
community
can
say
that
they
have
a
real
sense
of
share
ownership
of
and
input
into
the
policing
of
they
neighbourhood
.
I
hope
the
commission
will
make
proposal
for
structure
and
arrangement
to
promote
policing
that
be
effective
and
efficient
as
well
as
fair
and
impartial
.
we
need
a
policing
service
that
be
fully
accountable
to
the
law
and
the
community
.
the
reform
agenda
be
long
.
we
need
new
member
recruit
to
a
force
that
be
efficient
and
effective
,
one
that
use
modern
equipment
and
policing
method
to
ensure
the
good
possible
result
.
we
need
a
serious
look
at
Garda
formation
and
training
.
for
example
,
would
the
college
in
Templemore
serve
we
well
if
it
be
merge
into
a
multidisciplinary
third
-
level
institution
?
more
broadly
,
we
need
a
wide
range
of
educational
,
social
and
economic
measure
aim
at
end
social
deprivation
and
alienation
.
we
need
far
great
urgency
in
tackle
now
the
condition
that
will
cause
crime
in
future
.
a
serious
concerted
effort
now
can
target
young
people
most
at
risk
.
Gardaí
be
the
primary
guardian
of
the
community
.
they
must
be
,
and
be
see
to
be
,
a
part
of
the
community
.
as
the
first
Garda
Commissioner
,
Michael
Staine
,
put
it
,
"
the
Garda
Síochána
will
succeed
not
by
force
of
arm
or
number
but
on
they
moral
authority
as
servant
of
the
people
.
"
we
ambition
should
be
for
a
transform
service
that
enjoy
acceptance
and
support
throughout
the
community
.
there
must
be
no
piecemeal
reacting
on
the
hoof
and
no
more
ad
hoc
damage
limitation
.
above
all
else
,
we
need
a
change
mindset
of
the
government
and
within
Garda
management
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(

)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday

I
ask
the
Taoiseach
about
the
most
recent
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
,
HIQA
,
report
on
foster
care
service
in
Ireland
,
which
be
publish
today
.
the
report
find
a
serious
lack
of
compliance
in
foster
care
service
in
Cork
.
a
report
issue
in
February
and
a
subsequent
report
issue
today
find
a
glaring
lack
of
compliance
with
safety
requirement
and
a
lack
of
social
worker
.
HIQA
have
produce
16
report
to
date
on
foster
care
service
in
all
the
region
.
the
Department
responsible
for
this
service
have
receive
a
headline
budget
allocation
of
€
750
million
.
will
time
be
provide
for
a
proper
debate
or
statement
on
child
care
service
,
particularly
in
respect
of
foster
and
the
lack
of
resource
,
specifically
for
social
worker
,
as
well
as
the
glaring
lack
of
compliance
with
hiqa
requirement
?
we
be
speak
a
good
deal
about
broadband
today
,
but
I
want
to
move
the
agenda
on
to
the
fact
that
in
large
swathe
of
the
country
,
people
can
not
get
mobile
telephone
coverage
.
I
want
to
speak
for
that
people
.
I
have
specific
question
about
the
work
of
the
mobile
phone
task
force
.
will
the
minister
outline
when
the
task
force
meet
?
how
many
official
in
the
Department
be
work
on
the
task
force
?
when
can
people
who
do
not
have
coverage
expect
to
have
coverage
?
what
be
the
timeline
?
when
we
can
expect
delivery
of
a
100
%
rate
of
penetration
for
3g
coverage
in
the
country
?
I
conduct
a
straw
poll
today
of
people
I
know
throughout
the
country
.
Cushenstown
in
rural
Wexford
have
little
or
no
mobile
coverage
.
Maryborough
Hill
,
Douglas
in
the
heart
of
Cork
have
little
or
no
mobile
coverage
.
North
Meath
outside
of
Kells
and
Navan
have
no
coverage
.
other
place
,
include
the
area
west
of
Carrigrohane
in
Cork
,
have
no
courage
.
Wolfhill
in
Laois
,
Balgriffin
in
north
Dublin
and
Knocknacarra
in
the
heart
of
Galway
city
have
no
coverage
.
North
-
east
Kilkenny
have
no
coverage
.
we
must
get
the
basic
right
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
the
question
in
simple
term
.
will
he
ask
the
mobile
telephone
operator
specifically
to
ensure
that
they
provide
coverage
?
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
talk
about
tender
process
for
sell
bandwidth
and
so
on
.
the
minister
refer
to
the
3.6
GHz
band
spectrum
and
so
on
.
if
people
in
the
place
I
be
talk
about
cannot
use
they
mobile
telephone
,
then
we
be
on
a
hiding
to
nothing
in
respect
of
the
roll
-
out
of
broadband
.
I
be
simply
call
on
the
minister
to
give
some
impetus
to
get
ComReg
and
the
organisation
I
have
refer
to
,
include
the
mobile
telephone
operator
,
to
ensure
a
100
%
rate
of
penetration
throughout
the
country
.
if
we
can
start
at
that
basic
point
,
we
will
have
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
the
minister
can
bring
in
the
mobile
telephone
operator
.
the
minister
be
shift
it
back
onto
the
committee
.
the
committee
of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
have
discuss
this
issue
ad
infinitum
.
the
minister
acknowledge
that
mobile
telephone
coverage
in
he
experience
be
patchy
in
part
.
he
have
acknowledge
that
he
have
have
to
turn
off
he
own
datum
service
.
it
be
a
sad
indictment
on
the
House
when
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
stand
before
the
House
to
answer
question
from
people
like
I
and
say
that
it
be
simply
not
good
enough
.
will
the
minister
bring
in
the
mobile
telephone
operator
?
as
part
of
he
armoury
,
the
minister
have
the
power
of
persuasion
as
a
minister
.
he
have
the
facility
to
be
able
to
nudge
or
cajole
mobile
telephone
operator
to
provide
a
rate
of
100
%
penetration
for
3g
service
at
least
.
person
cannot
even
get
3g
,
never
mind
5G
.

there
be
124
school
completion
programme
throughout
the
State
,
which
cover
470
primary
school
and
224
post
-
primary
school
.
the
minister
announce
a
expansion
in
budget
2018
for
the
school
completion
programme
.
I
want
to
interrogate
further
what
be
the
exact
figure
behind
that
expansion
?
I
would
also
ask
she
why
I
be
receive
correspondence
from
trade
union
official
,
IMPACT
in
particular
,
whom
I
have
be
lobby
by
and
who
have
express
concern
about
they
job
and
future
employment
prospect
.
what
extra
resource
have
be
apply
to
the
school
completion
programme
in
budget
2018
?
that
be
not
clear
from
the
document
we
receive
on
budget
day
.
in
term
of
strengthen
the
structure
and
governance
,
and
the
minister
speak
about
reform
,
apart
from
the
expert
,
with
whom
else
be
she
consult
?
be
she
formally
consult
that
people
who
represent
worker
,
namely
,
trade
union
?
she
have
state
publicly
previously
that
she
have
encourage
people
who
work
within
this
sector
to
join
trade
union
.
person
represent
by
trade
union
be
come
to
we
express
concern
about
they
specific
programme
and
that
they
be
not
be
consult
.
I
need
a
reassurance
from
the
minister
that
she
will
reach
out
to
,
or
at
least
engage
with
,
the
stakeholder
grouping
,
include
the
trade
union
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
answer
and
she
have
be
frank
,
to
be
fair
.
as
soon
as
a
budget
line
emerge
around
that
expansion
of
the
school
completion
programme
,
I
ask
that
she
would
inform
the
House
of
it
.
I
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
"
suspicious
"
but
how
long
be
a
piece
of
string
with
respect
to
the
engagement
with
Tusla
?
we
be
wait
for
it
to
come
back
with
some
idea
or
principle
in
term
of
how
it
will
manage
the
school
completion
programme
and
no
figure
in
term
of
a
budget
have
be
put
behind
that
.
what
be
the
timeframe
?
will
it
be
the
end
of
2017
,
the
end
or
2018
or
the
first
or
second
quarter
of
2018
?
it
would
help
if
we
have
accurate
information
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
this
opportunity
to
speak
to
this
Bill
which
,
among
other
thing
,
will
ensure
that
one
-
parent
family
in
this
country
be
well
support
financially
into
the
future
.
it
will
ensure
that
mother
who
have
give
birth
to
they
newborn
prematurely
be
allocate
extension
to
they
entitlement
for
maternity
leave
.
it
will
ensure
that
all
social
welfare
recipient
will
receive
a
increase
in
they
weekly
payment
from
March
of
next
year
.
the
fact
that
we
be
here
today
introduce
yet
another
positive
social
Welfare
Bill
,
which
will
ensure
that
increase
funding
on
social
security
be
make
available
to
some
of
the
most
vulnerable
people
in
we
society
,
must
be
welcome
,
especially
when
one
consider
the
difficult
year
of
cut
and
austerity
,
from
which
we
have
only
recently
emerge
.
it
be
very
difficult
in
that
dark
economic
day
,
which
must
never
be
forget
by
we
as
legislator
when
introduce
this
type
of
social
welfare
legislation
,
which
,
as
I
be
sure
we
would
all
agree
,
will
introduce
positive
change
for
many
people
across
the
country
.
I
say
that
as
many
of
that
on
the
Opposition
bench
,
and
I
hear
some
of
they
contribution
,
would
believe
that
blank
cheque
should
have
be
write
by
the
government
to
introduce
increase
spending
level
at
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
that
would
simply
be
unsustainable
to
afford
and
that
would
not
be
in
keeping
with
the
policy
of
ensure
that
the
book
be
balance
and
that
we
have
control
on
we
spending
into
the
future
.
as
the
minister
and
other
member
will
be
acutely
aware
,
we
have
experience
a
lose
decade
in
this
country
due
to
a
irresponsible
and
negligent
fiscal
approach
,
which
lead
to
the
former
Department
of
social
Protection
ultimately
become
heavily
restrain
in
its
effort
to
provide
the
assistance
need
for
many
year
.
I
be
glad
we
as
party
be
not
repeat
the
say
approach
while
in
government
or
in
this
Bill
before
we
.
there
be
many
particular
positive
element
contain
in
this
Bill
which
I
want
to
welcome
briefly
.
before
I
deal
with

I
welcome
the

that
we

the

most
Oireachtas
member
from
Cork
meet
the
organisation
in
the
past
week
or
so
.
that
involve
articulate
to
we
that
they
be
in
a
position
where
they
receive
approximately
€
17
million
from
the
HSE
.
the
overall
turnover
of
the
organisation
be
€
20
million
.
the
organisation
get
additional
money
through
various
other
subscription
.
already
,
employer
's
liability
insurance
cost
€
500000
.
the
organisation
be
already
down
€
500000
on
the
€
20
million
before
it
open
its
door
on
1
January
.
I
support
the
point
make
by
deputy
Moynihan
.
we
be
hit
a
inflexion
point
where
the
very
existence
of
the
section
39
organisation
be
be
threaten
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
overall
cost
be
increase
exponentially
such
that
they
ability
to
deliver
the
essential
service
be
be
imped
and
imping
in
a
major
way
.
the
motion
before
we
seek
to
address
the
inequality
that
exist
between
worker
who
be
do
the
same
job
on
the
same
shop
floor
but
get
different
rate
of
pay
.
it
need
to
be
support
and
I
be
hope
the
minister
's
response
would
contain
a
more
thoughtful
exposition
of
how
difficult
it
be
for
section
39
worker
who
be
seek
to
have
they
rights
vindicate
.
if
there
be
a
possibility
of
industrial
action
,
it
be
not
sufficient
for
the
minister
to
say
it
have
be
the
subject
of
discussion
between
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
the
Minister
for
Health
,
or
between
they
official
,
for
some
time
.
he
say
the
Minister
for
Health
have
instruct
the
HSE
to
enter
into
a
process
of
engagement
with
section
39
agency
in
the
health
sector
to
establish
the
factual
position
regard
pay
reduction
and
restoration
.
be
I
to
interpret
the
minister
as
say
there
will
be
a
move
by
government
to
equalise
the
situation
?
the
minister
be
nod
but
be
he
say
there
will
be
a
restoration
of
pay
for
section
39
worker
?
the
minister
have
stop
nod
but
he
be
still
smile
.
I
be
hopeful
there
be
something
in
the
minister
's
language
that
give
some
comfort
to
that
worker
in
advance
of
14
February
.
I
be
hopeful
there
would
be
more
clarity
from
the
minister
because
despite
the
fact
that
,
as
he
state
,
there
be
a
extra
€
92
million
spend
on
disability
service
in
2017
,
for
which
I
give
credit
to
he
and
he
colleague
in
the
independent
Alliance
,
we
be
not
see
any
evidence
of
it
in
the
section
39
organisation
which
Oireachtas
Member
from
Cork
meet
last
week
.
we
need
the
government
to
articulate
how
that
extra
spend
be
translate
into
real
benefit
for
this
organisation
because
they
be
still
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
and
they
future
sustainability
be
still
at
risk
.
we
support
the
motion
and
I
hope
the
engagement
with
the
HSE
lead
ultimately
to
the
restoration
of
pay
.
eventually
.
eventually
.
I
lend
my
support
to
the
case
make
by
the
Chiropractic
Association
of
Ireland
.
as
deputy
will
agree
,
chiropractor
provide
a
invaluable
service
.
some
compromise
must
be
find
which
recognise
the
sector
and
what
it
deliver
in
town
and
village
nationwide
.
I
support
the
sentiment
express
by
the
two
previous
speaker
.
in
wrap
up
,
and
respond
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
I
thank
deputy
Howlin
for
draft
the
Bill
.
I
thank
all
party
for
they
support
for
the
Bill
.
I
thank
the
government
for
facilitate
the
Bill
in
its
onward
trajectory
.
I
be
disappointed
at
the
response
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
through
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kyne
,
to
the
issue
.
there
have
never
be
a
more
opportune
and
pertinent
time
for
this
legislation
to
be
pass
through
the
dáil
in
a
timely
fashion
because
of
the
gravity
of
the
issue
at
hand
.
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
come
before
the
House
and
state
there
will
be
a
open
policy
debate
on
8
March
after
which
the
minister
will
then
come
back
and
consult
with
he
colleague
suggest
that
the
minister
be
embark
on
another
consultative
process
that
will
falter
and
run
into
the
ground
.
member
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
party
along
with
I
and
other
be
member
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
we
have
have
ongoing
engagement
with
the
telecomumication
provider
on
the
need
for
safety
and
a
legislative
mechanism
to
ensure
safety
on
the
Internet
.
it
be
not
appropriate
to
engage
in
another
open
policy
debate
give
that
we
have
have
the
2013
independent
expert
Internet
content
and
governance
advisory
group
,
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
and
now
this
legislation
arise
from
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
.
there
be
no
need
for
another
consultation
when
everybody
within
the
community
know
that
legislative
action
be
need
.
the
parent
of
child
do
not
feel
confident
in
engage
with
the
technology
without
a
100
%
penetration
in
the
school
of
the
programme
available
.
person
now
want
guidance
from
this
House
to
ensure
the
space
child
inhabit
on
the
Internet
be
safe
and
that
there
be
mechanism
in
place
to
punish
that
who
transgress
.
that
be
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
.
the
offence
of
harassment
be
find
in
the
non-fatal
Offences
against
the
Person
Act
1997
.
this
new
version
provide
that
a
person
who
intentionally
or
recklessly
and
without
lawful
authority
or
reasonable
excuse
engage
in
harassment
be
subject
to
the
punishment
of
a
class
-
a
fine
.
this
allow
for
the
development
of
the
new
media
that
have
arise
in
recent
year
and
this
new
media
be
reflect
in
the
legislation
,
make
it
fit
for
purpose
.
that
be
what
we
be
do
today
.
it
be
worry
that
we
harassment
law
do
not
currently
cover
communication
that
we
use
every
day
,
include
imessage
,
WhatsApp
and
Facebook
message
.
we
law
have
not
be
update
since
the
invention
of
the
text
message
.
Young
people
,
who
be
primarily
the
victim
of
cyberbullying
and
revenge
porn
,
be
more
likely
to
use
WhatsApp
,
iMessage
and
Snapchat
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
we
need
to
ensure
that
they
be
protect
under
we
law
and
that
we
have
a
legal
basis
that
reflect
this
new
media
.
while
protect
freedom
of
expression
,
we
need
to
bring
the
law
up
to
date
to
protect
people
online
.
revenge
porn
,
threat
,
false
message
and
online
bullying
need
to
be
stop
.
there
need
to
be
punitive
action
against
it
online
.
as
a
parent
,
I
appreciate
that
child
be
become
more
tech
-
savvy
than
ever
so
it
be
imperative
that
we
educate
parent
and
teacher
on
the
danger
on
the
Internet
.
Young
people
,
we
child
,
be
often
aware
of
the
danger
of
share
image
or
video
.
however
,
they
may
not
realise
how
easy
it
be
for
another
person
to
take
image
and
share
they
online
.
we
be
clear
on
what
constitute
online
bullying
.
the
procedure
recently
publish
by
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
,
for
instance
,
say
"
place
a
once
-
off
offensive
or
hurtful
public
message
,
image
or
statement
on
a
social
network
site
or
other
public
forum
where
that
message
,
image
or
statement
can
be
view
and
/
or
repeat
by
other
people
will
be
regard
as
bullying
behaviour
.
"
it
can
happen
to
anyone
.
we
be
here
tonight
to
seek
to
ensure
that
this
House
take
a
primary
role
by
establish
a
legislative
framework
to
reflect
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
report
on
this
matter
.
I
note
the
response
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
to
the
Bill
.
we
believe
strongly
that
the
Bill
can
be
amend
as
need
in
a
fitting
way
.
there
be
a
clear
political
consensus
here
across
the
party
political
divide
that
we
should
ensure
that
punitive
measure
be
put
in
place
for
when
people
transgress
.
the
existence
of
the
media
should
be
recognise
and
the
law
update
to
recognise
it
.
I
ask
the
minister
not
to
turn
8
March
into
another
talking
shop
.
I
go
back
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
a
cross-party
committee
which
have
deliberate
on
this
issue
for
month
,
go
into
year
.
it
may
be
wonderful
for
people
to
gather
on
8
March
and
feel
like
they
be
take
action
on
the
issue
but
I
suspect
that
,
at
that
event
,
a
report
will
be
draft
arise
from
the
intervention
at
that
event
,
it
will
go
through
the
machinery
and
nothing
will
happen
.
the
minister
himself
have
say
that
he
will
appoint
a
online
digital
safety
commissioner
and
that
he
will
wait
until
the
forum
on
8
March
,
and
that
will
set
the
foundation
of
the
new
office
.
if
the
minister
be
go
to
wait
until
then
,
he
will
be
wait
until
kingdom
come
.
the
minister
have
a
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
legislation
before
this
House
which
have
cross-party
support
;
seek
to
identify
all
that
be
good
on
the
Internet
;
recognise
that
organisation
such
as
the
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
be
very
good
at
take
-
down
notice
but
that
they
cannot
be
policeman
of
the
Internet
and
be
mere
conduit
with
regard
to
the
content
that
go
across
the
Internet
;
and
that
we
cannot
expect
a
self
-
regulatory
regime
to
persist
.
we
believe
in
this
party
that
the
parent
of
Ireland
now
want
a
legislative
and
legally
sound
response
to
the
fear
that
they
have
about
the
activity
that
exist
on
the
Internet
.
they
have
be
well
-
articulate
in
the
debate
heretofore
.
we
thank
member
of
this
house
for
they
support
of
this
Bill
and
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
other
attempt
to
bring
in
legislation
of
this
nature
,
which
be
a
ongoing
process
.
I
think
that
all
of
we
in
this
House
have
a
opportunity
now
to
do
some
very
good
non-partisan
work
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
take
a
proactive
approach
to
this
legislation
.
if
we
be
to
capture
the
Zeitgeist
that
exist
throughout
the
home
of
Ireland
at
present
,
there
be
a
strong
sense
that
parent
want
clarity
on
the
legislation
to
ensure
that
there
be
punitive
measure
for
the
case
we
have
witness
in
recent
month
,
in
particular
that
of
Mr.
Horan
.
it
be
important
to
say
that
,
in
that
particular
case
,
the
US
authority
pick
up
on
that
gentleman
's
activity
and
make
contact
with
the
Garda
about
a
particular
email
account
be
use
.
it
be
important
that
,
in
the
course
of
talk
about
this
legislation
,
we
ensure
that
the
government
,
through
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
be
deploy
resource
to
the
Garda
.
there
be
not
enough
people
deploy
within
the
Garda
to
try
to
tackle
crime
of
this
nature
.
there
need
to
be
a
debate
about
the
need
to
resource
the
gardaí
to
be
able
to
tackle
this
issue
,
which
I
hope
will
happen
in
the
course
of
this
legislation
.
to
be
helpful
I
be
happy
to
code
two
or
three
minute
to
deputy
Nolan
.
not
at
all
.
it
be
my
pleasure
.
I
will
be
brief
.
I
welcome
the
Bill
.
it
be
important
that
we
have
a
codification
of
or
legislative
architecture
around
the
system
of
child
care
support
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
that
the
minister
have
do
.
we
must
likewise
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
committee
on
child
and
youth
affair
in
its
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
Bill
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
committee
's
current
and
previous
member
in
get
we
to
this
point
.
I
wish
to
highlight
a
number
of
minor
issue
.
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
discuss
they
further
and
have
a
great
interaction
with
the
minister
on
Committee
stage
.
Barnardos
have
,
through
its
policy
officer
,
raise
a
couple
of
issue
with
I
regard
section
7
,
14
and
15
.
I
believe
that
it
have
write
to
all
of
we
highlight
this
issue
and
I
would
be
surprised
if
it
have
not
be
in
touch
with
the
minister
's
office
and
staff
regard
they
as
well
,
give
that
it
be
a
effective
lobby
group
.
I
seek
clarification
from
the
minister
concern
the
it
architecture
or
infrastructure
that
will
be
set
up
.
in
September
2017
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
receive
a
report
on
the
measure
that
would
be
put
in
place
in
respect
of
the
ICT
approval
process
.
from
a
user
's
perspective
,
that
process
be
a
cornerstone
of
the
scheme
's
future
success
.
accord
to
the
note
that
we
receive
,
the
main
ICT
development
of
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
,
ACS
,
be
subject
to
the
Office
of
the
Government
Chief
Information
Officer
peer
review
group
,
PRG
.
the
PRG
have
review
the
business
case
and
approval
of
same
be
receive
on
21
September
,
subject
to
some
recommendation
that
the
minister
's
Department
be
satisfied
it
could
meet
.
the
next
stage
of
the
PRG
process
be
to
be
the
presentation
of
the
request
for
tender
for
the
procurement
of
the
ICT
development
.
the
request
for
tender
,
include
detailed
functional
requirement
,
be
submit
to
the
PRG
-
acronym
,
acronym
-
and
,
accord
to
the
note
,
a
meeting
have
be
schedule
to
discuss
it
.
that
be
September
.
this
evening
,
and
if
the
House
will
bear
with
I
while
I
find
she
speech
among
my
other
paper
,
the
minister
state
:
the
development
of
the
it
system
,
which
be
be
carry
out
in
close
co-operation
with
the
Office
of
the
Government
Chief
Information
Officer
,
be
well
under
way
and
I
have
approve
the
publication
of
a
request
for
tender
for
the
it
system
.
while
any
delay
be
regrettable
,
the
change
we
introduce
last
September
,
which
be
broadly
on
a
par
with
the
support
that
be
plan
for
the
affordable
child
care
scheme
,
mean
that
more
than
66000
child
and
they
family
be
already
benefit
from
increase
child
care
subsidy
.
I
want
to
reconcile
the
two
position
in
my
mind
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
revert
to
the
House
and
clarify
whether
she
believe
that
the
it
system
as
it
be
be
roll
out
have
the
confidence
of
end
user
and
whether
its
tyre
have
be
kick
by
they
.
the
minister
and
other
member
will
know
that
we
have
all
receive
a
considerable
number
of
representation
on
this
piece
of
architecture
.
if
there
be
to
be
public
confidence
in
the
scheme
,
the
ICT
architecture
have
to
be
spot
on
.
I
tab
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
minister
last
week
.
it
will
be
a
flagrant
use
of
a
opportunity
,
but
I
will
read
the
question
now
:
"
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
the
status
of
a
child
vis
-à
-
vis
access
to
the
ecce
scheme
that
will
reach
three
year
of
age
on
18
January
2019
.
"
I
put
this
question
because
it
be
be
ask
of
I
,
not
just
by
one
source
,
but
by
a
multitude
of
source
.
it
go
to
the
heart
of
the
new
scheme
in
the
form
of
the
age
criterion
as
we
approach
2019
.
although
change
to
the
eligibility
criterion
be
announce
in
the
budget
,
question
be
already
be
ask
of
parent
.
in
one
parent
's
case
,
the
relevant
date
will
be
18
January
2019
.
if
a
new
scheme
be
be
design
and
place
on
a
statutory
footing
,
question
will
be
ask
about
the
sustainability
of
its
funding
.
the
language
of
the
legislation
have
to
be
neutral
in
term
of
funding
,
but
will
the
minister
clarify
this
matter
?
the
committee
make
a
number
of
recommendation
at
the
pre-legislative
scrutiny
stage
.
across
a
number
of
heading
,
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
's
Bills
digest
put
green
,
amber
and
red
light
around
some
of
that
recommendation
as
well
as
the
Bill
's
content
,
for
example
,
budget
ceiling
under
head
1
,
the
need
of
vulnerable
child
under
head
3
,
approve
provider
under
head
6
,
and
the
issue
of
rent
out
the
family
home
and
family
income
supplement
,
FIS
.
a
number
of
matter
have
be
red-light
when
benchmark
against
the
committee
's
pre-legislative
process
.
the
minister
and
she
official
might
have
regard
to
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
's
report
and
revert
to
we
on
some
of
the
highlight
issue
.
I
wish
to
address
the
reconciliation
between
the
FIS
,
the
working
family
payment
and
the
acs
.
the
minister
have
refer
to
this
matter
,
but
perhaps
we
could
have
further
elaboration
on
the
result
of
the
interaction
between
she
Department
and
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
as
regards
the
share
of
datum
about
people
who
be
on
one
of
the
relevant
scheme
and
the
permutation
if
they
sign
up
to
the
acs
.
this
be
headline
issue
at
this
stage
.
we
will
have
a
chance
to
delve
deep
and
submit
amendment
on
committee
stage
.
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
role
in
get
the
legislation
to
this
point
.
broadly
speak
,
there
be
support
for
the
Bill
.
there
will
be
further
question
regard
the
scheme
's
roll
-
out
but
,
speak
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
we
support
the
Bill
's
progress
to
committee
stage
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
child

last
week
the
Irish
Times
publish
a
report
by
Conor
Lally
which
state
that
Garda
commissioner
would
have
the
same
power
as
cabinet
minister
in
appoint
staff
.
the
article
also
say
that
the
successor
to
commissioner
Nóirín
O'Sullivan
be
unlikely
to
be
appoint
before
September
.
my
question
be
simple
.
what
be
the
progress
to
date
regard
the
arrangement
for
the
selection
of
the
new
Garda
Commissioner
?
what
be
the
expect
timeframe
?
what
be
the
new
commissioner
's
salary
to
be
?
what
be
the
arrangement
in
relation
to
the
appointment
of
a
team
to
assist
the
commissioner
and
whether
change
to
legislation
be
require
?
I
be
glean
from
the
minister
that
this
be
a
ongoing
process
,
no
final
salary
have
be
determine
and
as
of
today
there
be
still
do
not
have
a
definitive
date
for
a
advertisement
for
the
post
.
in
clear
yes
-
no
term
,
I
ask
the
minister
if
that
be
the
case
.
I
also
ask
the
minister
in
relation
to
the
recruitment
of
staff
within
that
department
because
the
newspaper
article
state
that
there
be
the
possibility
that
the
new
commissioner
"
could
appoint
they
own
team
around
they
.
this
would
likely
be
hire
on
a
contract
basis
"
.
furthermore
,
promotion
and
appointment
,
as
we
know
they
within
the
Garda
network
,
be
such
that
,
"
promotion
and
appointment
have
long
be
regard
as
open
to
favouritism
and
nepotism
"
,
and
that
some
work
have
be
do
on
that
.
can
the
minister
give
we
guarantee
that
if
somebody
be
appoint
externally
and
at
the
discretion
of
the
new
Garda
Commissioner
,
it
will
not
cause
upset
within
the
force
where
one
be
now
subject
to
certain
rigor
and
a
new
process
in
relation
to
guard
against
nepotism
?
if
the
process
be
such
that
the
new
commissioner
can
appoint
external
person
at
he
or
she
discretion
,
will
that
require
change
in
legislation
?
the
Policing
Authority
report
be
very
good
.
it
be
easily
readable
and
digestible
.
there
be
the
creation
of
a
new
language
,
as
it
be
,
within
the
Policing
Authority
regard
how
it
set
out
the
challenge
it
face
.
have
there
be
any
progress
on
the
completion
of
the
workforce
plan
and
human
resource
strategy
?
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
concern
be
raise
in
the
report
of
22
December
2017
about
the
pace
of
implementation
?
the
July
report
state
that
although
the
Garda
Síochána
have
indicate
that
20
%
be
complete
,
the
authority
find
on
further
investigation
that
many
of
that
which
have
be
mark
as
complete
have
,
in
fact
,
not
meet
the
intent
of
the
relevant
recommendation
in
Changing
Policing
in
Ireland
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
the
clear
,
cohesive
language
of
the
Policing
Authority
,
which
be
report
back
to
we
and
publicly
,
be
tell
we
that
there
be
still
much
change
management
to
be
complete
within
a
Garda
Síochána
and
that
the
pace
of
the
implementation
of
change
be
not
where
it
need
to
be
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
response
.
all
member
,
along
with
the
community
who
be
observe
the
ongoing
change
management
,
want
to
see
a
policing
strategy
and
a
committee
to
examine
performance
in
that
regard
.
I
acknowledge
that
be
take
place
on
a
monthly
basis
but
we
must
ensure
that
milestone
be
be
reach
and
that
reform
,
which
be
a
slow
and
meticulous
process
,
be
achieve
.
do
the
minister
agree
that
the
role
of
the
Policing
Authority
have
be
crucial
in
ensure
the
progress
of
the
change
management
process
?
I
would
like
to
ask
,
through
the
Leas
-
Ceann
Comhairle
,
what
the
status
of
the
motion
will
be
if
the
government
be
defeat
on
its
amendment
.
if
Fianna
Fáil
win
the
day
on
this
motion
,
be
the
government
oblige
to
carry
out
Fianna
Fail
's
ask
,
so
to
speak
,
and
de
facto
conduct
a
review
?
I
ask
the
minister
that
if
,
in
the
event
the
government
be
defeat
,
it
be
oblige
to
carry
out
the
review
be
call
for
in
the
motion
?
it
be
a
technical
question
but
there
be
a
little
political
edge
to
it
also
.
tonight
all
member
receive
from
the
minister
,
and
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
by
accident
or
design
,
correspondence
relate
to
the
current
situation
that
pertain
to
what
some
have
call
a
fiasco
.
the
correspondence
be
between
Mr.
Moat
and
the
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
.
I
will
quote
from
a
letter
date
30
January
address
to
the
minister
in
which
Mr.
Moat
state
:
eir
enter
the
[
national
broadband
process
]
nbp
in
good
faith
with
the
ambition
of
win
the
entire
tender
.
we
have
spend
over
€
7
m
during
the
past
30
month
and
have
fully
engage
in
the
process
.
notwithstanding
we
well
-
communicate
'red
line
'
issue
,
eir
remain
in
the
process
and
submit
we
isds
in
September
in
the
hope
that
this
issue
would
be
address
in
the
final
month
of
the
contract
negotiation
.
"
Red
line
"
be
the
key
phrase
there
.
in
he
response
date
31
January
,
the
minister
state
:
when
we
meet
last
Tuesday
(
23rd
January
2018
)
my
official
set
out
clearly
that
the
completion
of
the
draft
contract
negotiation
phase
of
the
project
would
not
occur
for
several
week
yet
.
there
be
ample
opportunity
to
continue
to
engage
on
outstanding
"
red
line
"
issue
,
and
it
would
,
therefore
,
appear
premature
for
eir
to
take
a
decision
to
exit
the
process
.
you
indicate
a
intent
to
consult
further
with
you
board
.
we
know
what
happen
subsequently
.
what
be
perplex
everyone
in
and
out
of
the
political
realm
be
the
question
of
how
this
transpire
.
how
do
it
transpire
that
there
be
still
red
line
issue
at
this
stage
of
the
process
such
that
Eir
,
as
one
of
the
bidder
,
decide
to
pull
out
of
the
market
?
what
be
that
red
line
issue
?
everyone
here
and
outside
this
wall
want
to
know
.
if
we
have
some
articulation
from
the
minister
or
he
official
as
to
what
the
red
line
issue
be
without
invoke
the
cloak
of
commercial
sensitivity
,
it
would
be
very
helpful
for
we
to
further
understand
the
ongoing
process
.
what
be
very
confusing
for
I
and
thousand
of
other
be
that
not
too
terribly
long
ago
a
deal
,
as
I
understand
it
,
be
do
to
facilitate
Eir
to
provide
for
a
extra
300000
house
and
premise
.
in
the
intervene
period
,
approximately
100000
of
that
have
be
cover
.
the
minister
will
clarify
that
.
arguably
,
that
be
progress
.
how
be
that
deal
do
and
why
do
we
do
that
deal
but
a
few
short
month
late
,
completely
and
utterly
pull
the
plug
?
we
all
have
we
theory
on
what
be
happen
but
it
be
incumbent
on
the
minister
,
perhaps
not
during
private
Member
's
time
tonight
,
but
certainly
tomorrow
when
we
have
statement
,
to
clarify
the
correspondence
he
have
send
to
every
member
on
he
interaction
with
Eir
.
there
be
serious
question
in
that
regard
.
we
all
have
scenario
in
we
constituency
of
relevance
to
this
issue
.
there
be
one
pocket
or
enclave
of
12
house
in
my
constituency
,
for
example
,
where
Eir
come
within
12
pole
on
either
side
before
stop
the
roll
out
.
that
be
typical
of
west
Cork
and
part
of
Kilkenny
.
if
one
be
to
move
around
the
Chamber
,
member
from
every
county
would
have
a
articulation
of
the
very
scenario
I
have
just
paint
.
the
question
now
be
whether
the
last
bidder
,
in
effect
the
winner
give
the
scenario
we
be
in
,
can
come
in
and
plug
that
gap
.
there
be
some
scepticism
out
there
,
include
on
my
part
,
give
that
it
be
reasonable
to
wonder
what
price
it
will
take
for
the
last
bidder
stand
to
come
in
and
close
the
loop
in
that
black
spot
if
Eir
could
not
do
so
within
the
current
competitive
architecture
.
will
that
bidder
in
fact
be
able
to
name
its
price
and
hold
the
government
to
ransom
as
a
result
?
I
be
conscious
of
the
time
and
that
be
just
some
of
the
issue
we
have
.
we
will
support
the
motion
,
but
we
do
so
under
advisement
in
circumstance
where
there
be
a
further
opportunity
for
the
minister
to
come
to
the
House
tomorrow
for
statement
.
it
be
a
opportunity
for
he
,
without
use
any
couch
language
,
to
clarify
matter
for
everybody
here
and
outside
who
be
depend
on
the
national
broadband
plan
,
as
well
as
on
he
for
answer
,
and
to
set
out
he
stall
.
he
have
come
out
fight
tonight
,
for
which
I
give
he
credit
,
but
he
have
stand
over
the
facilitation
of
a
crucial
market
share
for
a
monopolistic
player
.
the
minister
will
answer
the
point
tomorrow
night
and
I
will
give
he
time
to
think
about
it
.
there
be
still
question
mark
over
why
it
be
done
.
I
appreciate
that
a
commitment
be
give
to
bring
in
300000
player
,
but
where
stand
SIRO
now
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
communication
with
SIRO
and
do
it
exist
as
a
entity
?
what
be
that
other
player
do
within
the
market
?
be
they
create
parallel
process
or
network
on
which
they
can
deliver
product
?
there
be
a
lot
of
question
but
time
,
unfortunately
,
be
against
I
.
I
look
forward
to
have
this
debate
with
the
minister
again
tomorrow
evening
.

the
Labour
Party
be
support
the
Bill
.
we
wish
to
see
it
proceed
to
Committee
stage
.
it
be
great
to
stand
in
the
Chamber
and
hear
the
voice
of
a
young
child
in
the
Public
Gallery
.
it
be
a
nice
reminder
of
just
exactly
why
we
be
all
here
.
it
be
lovely
to
hear
that
little
voice
from
on
high
.
I
will
offer
a
different
slant
on
this
Bill
.
in
Paris
in
December
2015
,
Ireland
agree
to
halt
climate
change
.
we
sign
up
to
very
specific
target
,
namely
,
to
hold
the
increase
in
the
global
average
temperature
to
well
below
2°
Celsius
above
pre-industrial
level
and
to
pursue
effort
to
limit
that
temperature
increase
to
1.5°
Celsius
.
the
time
have
come
for
we
to
be
very
serious
about
that
target
from
a
global
perspective
,
particularly
in
regard
to
what
we
do
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
if
one
consider
the
development
agenda
,
I
note
that
on
average
,
we
spend
approximately
€600
million
per
annum
support
poverty
reduction
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
for
instance
,
in
work
with
we
key
partner
country
through
Irish
Aid
.
through
Irish
Aid
,
we
support
subsistence
farming
project
in
the
Tigray
region
of
Ethiopia
to
allow
a
sustainable
model
of
agriculture
to
exist
there
in
order
that
people
can
feed
themselves
,
at
the
very
minimum
.
we
have
to
make
the
connection
between
the
programme
that
we
be
support
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
the
effect
of
a
global
average
temperature
increase
of
2°
Celsius
above
the
pre-industrial
level
on
the
very
people
we
be
assist
.
we
in
western
Europe
be
contribute
by
we
action
to
that
very
same
increase
in
temperature
.
there
must
be
a
understanding
of
the
causal
link
between
what
we
be
support
in
we
laudable
programme
in
Irish
Aid
on
the
one
hand
and
we
behaviour
on
this
island
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
excellent
stop
Climate
Change
briefing
document
that
be
submit
to
Member
.
it
refer
to
the
role
of
financial
analyst
and
say
that
financial
analyst
have
highlight
the
risk
of
fossil
fuel
asset
become
strand
or
worthless
,
a
warning
reiterate
publicly
by
the
Governor
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
Mark
Carney
.
it
continue
:
"
a
increase
number
of
legal
scholar
and
regulator
be
now
warning
that
fiduciary
who
fail
to
consider
climate
change
risk
in
they
investment
analysis
and
decision
could
be
liable
for
breach
they
fiduciary
duty
in
the
future
,
expose
they
to
litigation
risk
"
.
if
we
be
capture
the
Zeitgeist
,
there
must
be
ownership
of
the
agenda
from
a
political
point
of
view
to
ensure
that
we
divest
ourselves
from
that
type
of
investment
instrument
and
that
we
,
as
a
parliament
,
on
behalf
of
the
people
,
take
radical
action
on
climate
change
.
in
this
country
we
be
now
subject
to
great
weather
event
which
have
a
impact
on
the
delivery
of
food
,
how
agriculture
operate
and
on
the
build
environment
in
the
town
,
village
and
enclave
in
which
we
live
.
we
must
start
to
take
radical
action
to
ensure
we
have
both
a
investment
portfolio
and
a
set
of
policy
instrument
that
take
seriously
the
risk
inherent
in
climate
change
.
in
conclusion
,
we
will
support
the
Bill
.
it
be
time
for
we
to
get
to
grip
with
this
issue
from
a
non-partisan
point
of
view
and
this
be
a
opportunity
to
do
that
.
I
hope
the
government
will
facilitate
the
Bill
pass
to
Committee
stage
.
it
appear
there
be
a
clear
majority
in
the
House
for
the
view
that
it
should
proceed
to
that
stage
.
when
that
happen
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
put
forward
amendment
as
we
see
fit
,
contribute
to
the
debate
and
have
a
successful
outcome
on
the
Bill
,
such
that
it
lead
to
a
set
of
policy
instrument
that
ultimately
give
effect
to
real
change
.
I
will
begin
by
examine
some
of
the
minister
's
speech
to
the
House
tonight
.
this
debate
be
a
continuation
of
the
one
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
private
Member
's
motion
that
be
before
the
House
last
night
.
if
I
read
the
political
landscape
correctly
that
the
Opposition
will
support
the
motion
,
then
I
do
not
see
why
we
could
not
have
a
short
,
sharp
review
.
the
minister
's
response
to
that
be
inadequate
in
say
that
it
would
delay
the
process
inordinately
.
I
do
not
think
anyone
here
busy
that
response
as
there
be
huge
scepticism
about
the
manner
in
which
this
process
have
be
handle
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
speech
tonight
.
he
say
:
"
my
Department
have
no
involvement
in
the
selection
of
premise
for
inclusion
in
this
commercial
roll
-
out
and
that
be
entirely
a
decision
for
Eir
as
it
would
be
for
any
commercial
company
"
.
he
be
refer
to
the
300000
connection
that
be
to
be
roll
out
which
be
beyond
the
State
intervention
.
give
Eir
's
form
,
have
be
through
seven
take
-
over
and
be
asset
-
strip
,
I
do
not
know
if
I
would
believe
the
Rosary
out
of
its
mouth
,
as
someone
put
it
to
I
last
week
,
on
the
matter
.
for
the
minister
to
come
in
and
say
he
have
a
commitment
agreement
in
respect
of
the
300000
without
place
a
copy
of
that
commitment
before
the
House
beggar
belief
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
and
I
acknowledge
that
it
be
publish
-----
-----
what
be
the
legal
status
of
that
document
?
it
be
clear
that
it
have
no
real
legal
status
.
while
the
minister
may
come
in
here
and
say
that
121000
house
have
be
pass
by
,
I
can
say
that
of
that
121000
that
be
in
this
plan
for
300000
plan-----
well
,
121000
be
quote
somewhere
among
some
of
the
figure
-----
-----
which
the
minister
have
give
to
we
,
in
the
phalanx
of
information
that
we
have
receive
.
it
be
unusual
for
a
minister
to
interrupt
a
member
of
the
Opposition
when
he
or
she
be
speak
.
it
be
in
some
of
the
correspondence
that
we
receive
because
I
could
wallpaper
this
chamber
with
the
amount
of
paper
I
have
receive
on
this
issue
from
the
minister
in
the
last
48
hour
.
his
new
-
find
transparency
will
come
as
a
great
surprise
to
many
people
in
this
House
.
the
minister
raise
the
Fianna
Fáil
private
Member
's
motion
.
yesterday
,
I
ask
about
red-line
issue
.
the
minister
have
publish
documentation
exchange
between
himself
and
Mr.
Moat
on
the
red
-line
issue
.
we
have
have
no
articulation
from
the
minister
as
to
what
that
issue
be
between
Eir
and
the
government
.
the
minister
seek
to
be
non-partisan
on
this
.
as
soon
as
he
decide
he
would
set
a
90
-
week
target
,
or
whatever
it
be
,
on
this
,
it
become
a
politically
drive
target
.
it
be
a
bit
rich
for
the
minister
to
come
to
the
House
tonight
and
tell
we
that
we
should
not
play
politics
with
this
.
last
week
in
the
House
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
,
raise
the
matter
of
there
be
a
plan
b
.
the
minister
have
fail
to
tell
the
House
this
evening
what
that
plan
B
be
.
all
we
have
be
tell
be
that
he
be
support
the
Enet
bit
,
but
even
then
the
minister
have
not
tell
we
what
price
will
now
be
pay
for
the
Enet
tender
.
go
back
to
the
131000
figure
,
some
of
the
house
have
be
pass
by
.
I
speak
of
a
very
typical
scenario
which
happen
in
rural
Ireland
where
one
might
have
a
enclave
of
12
house
.
some
12
pole
to
they
left
and
to
they
right
be
cover
but
that
enclave
in
the
middle
be
not
cover
.
can
the
minister
guarantee
that
in
this
the
blackspot
,
that
the
State
-
aid
national
broadband
plan
will
cover
this
,
at
a
price
?
I
be
sorry
.
the
minister
say
"
yes
"
,
but
the
people
who
live
in
that
enclave
of
12
house
be
scratch
they
head
and
wonder
why
,
if
Eir
be
so
committed
to
this
process
,
that
it
pass
12
house
on
the
same
stretch
of
road
.
what
be
that
all
about
?
that
cause
great
confusion
for
many
family
depend
on
this
scheme
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
can
get
to
a
point
where
the
100
%
penetration
rate
of
which
the
minister
speak
can
be
achieve
.
whatever
way
the
minister
wish
to
cut
the
knife
,
he
be
politically
expose
on
this
question
.
he
set
out
clear
target
and
it
be
only
right
and
proper
that
we
interrogate
the
information
that
the
minister
be
provide
we
.
with
all
the
information
we
have
receive
in
the
last
24
hour
,
I
admit
that
it
be
take
we
some
time
to
try
to
interpret
the
correspondence
,
but
I
will
refer
once
again
to
the
minister
's
document
in
regard
to
the
300000
premise
.
the
document
state
that
the
fourth
quarter
figure
for
Eir
's
rural
deployment
have
yet
to
be
verify
by
the
Department
,
however
Eir
indicate
that
it
have
pass
almost
121000
premise
to
be
identify
,
of
the
identify
300000
premise
as
of
December
2017
.
I
be
merely
quote
,
for
the
record
,
figure
that
the
minister
have
provide
we
with
.
the
minister
have
also
provide
we
with
figure
on
SIRO
.
he
state
that
SIRO
have
commit
to
invest
€450
million
into
provide
fibre
broadband
to
0.5
million
regional
home
and
business
in
51
town
.
as
of
January
of
this
year
,
127000
fibre
-
to
-
the
-
home
connection
have
be
build
in
19
town
across
the
country
,
with
32
to
follow
.
I
welcome
this
.
what
I
want
to
ask
the
minister
-
perhaps
the
minister
or
he
official
can
clarify
this
to
I
by
email
after
this
debate
be
over
-
be
whether
there
be
a
crossing
over
.
will
we
now
face
a
situation
where
in
certain
quarter
in
certain
part
of
this
country
one
can
have
the
Eir
offering
,
the
SIRO
offering
or
any
number
of
offering
?
SIRO
,
which
be
one
of
the
bidder
and
which
include
ESB
and
which
have
give
a
commitment
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
be
part
of
the
tender
process
,
want
to
be
part
of
this
national
broadband
plan
and
be
now
get
on
with
matter
within
the
market
.
the
clarification
I
be
seek
be
,
how
be
SIRO
manage
to
provide
fibre
broadband
,
with
its
€450
million
investment
,
to
500000
regional
home
and
business
in
51
town
and
why
be
it
that
SIRO
feel
it
have
to
pull
out
of
this
process
?
be
it
not
the
case
that
SIRO
pull
out
of
this
process
because
as
soon
as
the
minister
make
the
commitment
agreement
with
Eir
for
300000
,
it
be
in
no
way
feasible
for
any
other
bidder
,
or
any
bidder
of
SIRO
's
stature
,
to
be
able
to
stay
in
the
competition
and
it
have
decide
to
go
it
alone
?
there
be
still
serious
question
to
be
ask
of
the
minister
's
handling
of
this
.
the
minister
have
invest
heavily
,
politically
,
from
a
reputational
point
of
view
,
in
deliver
this
.
we
all
want
to
give
the
minister
a
chance
to
do
that
but
I
contend
that
there
be
increase
scepticism
,
particularly
in
that
area
which
be
black
spot
,
and
because
of
the
withdrawal
of
eir
from
the
process
,
about
the
government
's
ability
to
deliver
this
plan
on
time
and
on
budget
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
issue
.
I
meet
people
from
a
English
company
in
Sligo
this
morning
who
be
prepare
to
set
up
a
business
in
my
home

the

we
have
the
premise

what
be
the
current
status
of
the
adoption
(
amendment
)
act
2017
and
have
all
section
of
the
act
be
commence
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
clarity
.
analysis
of
the
adoption
(
amendment
)
act
be
carry
out
follow
the
adoption
of
the
act
by
the
House
in
2017
.
there
have
be
call
for
the
introduction
of
semi-open
adoption
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
semi-open
adoption
,
whereby
birth
family
have
ongoing
contact
with
adoptive
family
and
there
would
be
contact
between
the
adopt
child
and
he
or
she
birth
family
?
do
the
current
act
allow
for
that
,
would
it
require
further
legislation
or
have
the
minister
give
thought
to
the
issue
in
light
of
the
analysis
that
take
place
at
a
conference
host
by
the
Adoption
Authority
of
Ireland
in
November
and
attend
by
the
chairperson
of
Tusla
,
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
,
and
other
representative
body
which
espouse
that
view
?
I
again
thank
the
minister
.
we
must
challenge
we
institutionalised
thinking
regard
how
adoption
work
and
the
relationship
that
follow
therefrom
,
which
be
quite
structure
.
I
appreciate
that
the
minister
be
give
some
thought
to
the
issue
.
I
be
unclear
as
to
whether
there
will
be
a
move
on
this
issue
on
committee
stage
of
the
adoption
(
Information
and
Tracing
)
Bill
.
do
the
minister
intend
to
legislate
for
this
issue
in
the
Adoption
(
Information
and
Tracing
)
Bill
?
I
think
that
be
for
deputy
Canney
to
do
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
Versatis
pain
patch
debacle
.
deputy
Micheál
Martin
raise
this
issue
on
Tuesday
only
to
be
tell
by
the
Taoiseach
that
a
process
of
appeal
have
be
put
in
place
.
I
have
example
of
specific
case
.
in
one
such
case
a
person
in
Mallow
name
Catherine
Carroll
have
go
through
the
appeal
process
.
as
we
speak
,
she
be
in
excruciating
pain
such
that
she
have
say
,
"
it
be
get
to
the
stage
where
I
have
ask
the
doctor
be
it
possible
to
cut
off
my
nerve
ending
,
because
,
even
though
I
have
end
up
paralyse
,
at
least
I
would
not
be
in
pain
"
.
that
be
a
real
person
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
if
the
government
will
give
time
in
this
House
to
further
discuss
this
issue
.
person
have
go
through
the
appeal
process
and
be
reject
.
they
have
nowhere
else
to
go
to
alleviate
they
pain
.
it
be
still
very
much
a
live
issue
.
my
request
be
simple
.
we
need
to
have
further
deliberation
on
this
issue
.
there
be
some
deliberation
on
it
in
the
Seanad
yesterday
but
we
need
to
have
the
minister
before
the
House
because
there
be
further
question
to
be
answer
on
behalf
of
people
such
as
Catherine
Carroll
.
she
be
not
a
outlier
or
exception
,
rather
she
be
within
the
range
of
patient
who
be
suffer
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
come
to
the
House
to
deal
with
the
issue
at
hand
.
to
be
fair
,
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
in
keep
the
northern
relief
road
on
the
agenda
,
as
he
have
with
regard
to
the
M20
.
I
be
in
receipt
of
correspondence
previously
from
the
minister
on
the
M20
Cork
-
Limerick
route
,
but
there
be
a
need
for
the
interurban
network
of
road
to
be
facilitate
also
,
which
be
why
I
be
make
the
case
here
today
for
the
N72
and
N73
bypass
.
the
minister
may
be
in
possession
of
the
economic
assessment
case
make
by
Indecon
consultant
and
issue
in
June
2015
.
it
make
a
strong
case
base
on
the
future
project
growth
of
town
such
as
Mallow
.
we
welcome
wholeheartedly
the
funding
provision
make
for
the
M20
.
there
be
a
parcel
of
funding
behind
it
of
approximately
€900
million
,
and
we
acknowledge
some
grant
aid
have
be
give
through
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
,
TII
,
to
allow
for
feasibility
study
and
further
work
on
the
northern
relief
road
.
will
the
minister
give
we
further
clarity
on
timeline
for
the
progression
of
the
project
?
be
there
a
possibility
that
further
money
might
be
make
available
for
the
project
?
the
key
finding
of
the
Indecon
international
economic
analysis
state
Mallow
be
the
large
town
in
the
north
of
County
Cork
and
be
one
of
the
fast
grow
town
in
Cork
with
regard
to
population
.
the
agrifood
sector
be
a
key
sectoral
strength
in
the
immediate
conurbation
,
and
it
support
more
than
12,000
people
in
the
agriculture
sector
alone
.
we
have
see
the
growth
of
Dairygold
as
one
of
the
key
reference
point
nationally
for
the
production
of
milk
powder
and
the
expansion
of
dairy
.
this
be
give
rise
to
major
transport
movement
through
hgv
,
and
it
be
put
a
constraint
on
the
local
infrastructure
.
be
it
possible
for
the
minister
to
engage
further
through
TII
,
with
a
view
to
see
whether
there
be
a
possibility
for
further
grant
to
be
make
available
,
from
he
finite
budget
,
to
progress
this
project
and
reflect
the
reality
of
the
fact
Mallow
be
a
grow
town
,
ensure
it
facilitate
and
dovetail
with
,
or
run
in
parallel
with
,
the
M20
Cork
to
Limerick
project
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
,
which
be
positive
.
give
he
commitment
to
ensure
the
interurban
network
get
attention
throughout
the
country
,
as
per
he
statement
on
the
national
development
plan
,
I
hope
the
minister
will
keep
Mallow
in
mind
,
and
that
when
funding
become
available
to
progress
the
scheme
beyond
the
project
appraisal
,
design
and
progress
through
the
statutory
process
,
funding
will
become
available
to
ensure
the
project
stay
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
will
state
in
the
first
instance
that
the
Labour
Party
will
be
support
the
Bill
.
I
be
glad
that
the
minister
and
the
government
be
also
support
it
to
the
next
stage
of
proceedings
.
the
minister
will
forgive
I
if
I
be
a
little
bit
cynical
about
he
response
.
we
have
a
good
engagement
at
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
yesterday
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
there
be
a
precedent
but
four
cabinet
member
appear
before
we
in
unison
to
speak
on
the
issue
of
Internet
safety
and
to
articulate
what
each
of
they
Department
be
do
to
protect
minor
and
to
get
people
to
engage
in
order
that
as
a
society
,
we
meet
the
challenge
present
by
the
vagary
of
the
online
community
.
my
cynicism
-
it
have
a
small
"
c
"
-
stem
from
the
fact
that
be
one
to
parse
through
the
speech
make
by
each
of
the
four
minister
,
one
would
find
that
not
one
of
they
be
proactive
in
put
up
he
or
she
hand
and
ask
for
responsibility
for
the
role
of
digital
safety
commissioner
within
he
or
she
Department
.
instead
,
we
be
subject
to
another
open
policy
debate
.
I
have
sit
where
the
minister
be
sit
now
,
so
I
have
some
insight
into
how
government
work
.
I
do
not
believe
we
need
another
open
policy
debate
,
to
be
frank
.
it
would
be
wonderful
to
gather
everybody
in
one
room
and
have
another
discussion
but
we
already
have
the
report-----
this
be
the
second
time
that
I
have
be
on
my
foot
in
front
of
this
minister
.
he
be
a
decent
,
progressive
man
but
I
would
be
oblige
if
he
would
let
I
get
on
with
my
speech
.
I
may
be
wrong
,
as
I
often
be
,
and
if
so
I
stand
to
be
correct
in
due
course
but
I
will
make
my
few
point
.
the
Internet
content
governance
advisory
group
,
ICGAG
,
report
be
set
up
at
the
behest
of
the
former
minister
,
Pat
Rabbitte
,
and
it
contain
a
set
of
recommendation
that
have
not
yet
be
adopt
.
I
strongly
believe
we
now
have
legislation
before
we
that
can
be
subject
to
amendment
but
that
allow
for
the
appointment
of
a
digital
safety
commissioner
.
however
,
until
the
government
clearly
tell
we
under
which
Department
it
will
sit
,
I
predict
we
will
be
here
this
time
next
year
talk
about
the
same
issue
.
a
recommendation
be
make
by
the
ICGAG
that
a
cabinet
minister
or
a
minister
of
State
would
be
appoint
.
as
it
cut
across
the
various
Department
-
I
acknowledge
the
challenge
the
government
face
on
this
issue
-
I
do
not
see
why
the
government
could
not
appoint
somebody
who
have
a
certain
skill
set
to
act
outside
of
the
silo
so
as
to
ensure
there
be
direct
political
responsibility
for
this
.
to
return
to
the
four
speech
that
be
make
yesterday
,
if
one
parse
through
the
Department
involve
,
namely
,
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
,
Justice
and
Equality
and
Education
and
Skill
,
it
be
clear
that
there
be
excellent
work
go
on
in
the
individual
Department
.
if
I
be
to
proffer
a
opinion
-
I
do
not
have
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
on
this
matter
-
I
would
say
that
matter
be
often
pass
on
to
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
if
there
be
any
sort
of
bespoke
or
eclectic
element
to
it
.
I
be
not
sure
if
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
would
be
the
most
appropriate
place
for
the
office
of
the
digital
safety
commissioner
.
I
believe
it
stand
somewhere
between
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
and
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
if
I
be
to
offer
a
opinion
I
believe
it
would
work
good
with
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
but
as
I
say
,
I
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
wisdom
in
this
area
.
there
be
no
indication
from
any
of
the
minister
yesterday
that
they
want
to
take
this
on
or
that
they
want
to
ensure
they
would
have
political
responsibility
for
this
at
cabinet
level
.
we
be
not
see
the
level
of
advocacy
at
ministerial
level
we
need
.
I
suggest
that
someone
could
sit
under
that
level
as
a
minister
of
State
who
could
cross-cut
each
department
and
collate
the
information
available
in
each
.
three
or
four
excellent
civil
servant
could
be
appoint
and
it
could
have
a
budget
,
and
we
could
get
on
with
it
.
if
that
do
not
happen
we
will
probably
be
here
this
time
next
year
discuss
this
issue
.
I
have
not
carry
out
a
proper
analysis
of
the
number
of
private
Member
's
bill
.
we
be
all
produce
they
.
the
minister
have
refer
to
the
Labour
Party
Bill
that
seek
to
tackle
online
harassment
.
we
now
have
this
Bill
,
introduce
by
deputy
Ó
Laoghaire
,
which
seek
to
establish
the
office
of
the
digital
safety
commissioner
.
I
believe
Fianna
Fáil
be
draft
legislation
on
this
issue
as
well
.
we
have
a
plethora
of
Bills
and
we
need
some
degree
of
co-ordination
at
the
political
level
.
this
be
a
non-partisan
issue
and
there
have
be
a
massive
willingness
on
the
part
of
all
politician
,
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
,
to
co-operate
on
it
.
there
be
outlying
issue
relate
to
the
digital
age
of
consent
-
some
of
we
be
conflict
as
to
whether
it
should
be
13
or
16
and
there
be
work
to
be
do
on
that
-
but
if
we
be
all
work
in
unison
and
in
tandem
with
one
another
,
we
can
achieve
something
.
I
believe
there
be
a
massive
onus
on
this
generation
of
politician
or
the
incumbent
under
this
mandate
to
try
to
achieve
something
on
this
.
there
be
massive
demand
from
parent
in
particular
to
ensure
that
somebody
in
government
will
grasp
the
nettle
on
this
issue
.
that
be
what
people
want
to
see
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
office
of
the
digital
safety
commissioner
will
sit
somewhere
between
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
or
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
give
that
this
be
a
issue
that
affect
minor
in
the
main
.
I
support
the
Bill
.
deputy
Rabbitte
speak
about
resource
.
yesterday
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
about
the
Garda
national
protective
service
.
we
have
a
interaction
with
the
assistant
commissioner
at
the
committee
before
Christmas
and
be
tell
that
few
than
100
people
be
deploy
in
the
area
of
online
child
exploitation
,
cybersecurity
and
cybercrime
.
I
believe
strongly
that
if
this
country
be
able
to
announce
a
multi-billion
euro
national
development
plan
,
somewhere
within
the
Exchequer
's
coffer
there
be
money
to
be
make
available
to
buttress
the
exist
resource
to
assist
the
Garda
in
particular
and
the
Office
for
Internet
Safety
,
which
I
understand
have
probably
few
than
five
staff
member
.
they
do
a
great
deal
of
work
.
similarly
,
in
education
,
there
be
the
professional
Development
Service
for
teacher
,
PDST
,
which
be
responsible
for
ongoing
professional
development
for
teacher
and
which
have
a
small
number
of
staff
who
be
try
to
roll
out
programme
across
the
country
.
there
be
major
challenge
in
that
respect
,
as
articulate
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
yesterday
.
if
we
can
provide
good
resource
to
exist
service
we
can
start
make
a
great
impact
but
in
support
this
legislation
,
I
would
make
the
case
that
if
it
pass
all
stage
,
and
,
hopefully
,
it
will
,
and
if
the
government
intend
to
amend
it
as
it
see
fit
,
it
would
amend
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
and
not
state
that
it
will
take
on
its
own
Bill
.
hopefully
,
the
minister
might
come
back
after
8
March
and
after
the
open
policy
forum
because
much
of
what
he
will
hear
in
the
open
policy
forum
be
message
he
have
already
hear
through
official
formal
and
informal
channel
.
we
all
know
what
we
need
to
do
.
we
need
to
pass
this
legislation
,
appoint
a
appropriate
minister
with
responsibility
for
this
area
,
and
give
that
minister
the
resource
and
the
political
responsibility
to
do
that
.
if
that
be
do
,
we
will
be
able
to
get
on
with
the
job
in
hand
.
deputy
Howlin's
.
the
Ceann
Comhairle
can
take
all
stage
if
he

we
support
the
Bill
.
I
have
a
few
question
on
the
minister
's
speech
.
the
Bill
provide
that
the
power
to
exempt
certain
vessel
carry
nuclear
material
otherwise
prohibit
from
enter
a
Irish
harbour
will
be
transfer
to
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
.
when
such
exemption
be
give
,
be
it
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
?
if
it
be
not
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
,
be
there
a
process
by
which
such
exemption
could
be
make
public
?
if
they
be
not
public
knowledge
,
there
may
be
a
legitimate
reason
for
that
,
but
I
would
like
to
know
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
historical
issue
.
I
have
information
date
back
to
2011
when
the
management
of
radioactive
waste
be
the
responsibility
of
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
in
conjunction
with
the
Radiological
Protection
Institute
of
Ireland
.
information
on
radioactive
waste
in
the
country
's
education
sector
indicate
that
2,037
source
be
hold
at
17
institution
in
dedicate
storage
facility
.
I
take
it
that
information
be
now
out
of
date
.
the
minister
or
he
official
might
correspond
with
I
on
the
matter
.
I
could
table
a
parliamentary
question
to
that
effect
.
in
reply
to
the
debate
the
minister
might
indicate
if
there
be
a
update
register
of
the
source
hold
at
the
17
institution
.
I
presume
that
the
exist
law
will
also
transfer
over
.
it
be
a
licensing
requirement
that
a
application
to
acquire
new
seal
source
be
accompany
by
a
take
-
back
agreement
whereby
the
supplier
agree
to
take
back
the
source
when
it
be
no
long
require
.
give
that
provision
in
law
,
I
imagine
the
figure
of
2,037
source
have
probably
not
increase
considerably
since
2011
.
I
seek
further
clarification
on
that
.
in
2011
there
be
material
in
storage
at
University
College
Cork
.
it
do
not
come
from
a
nuclear
reactor
,
as
be
suggest
at
the
time
.
I
understand
it
be
originally
incorporate
into
a
device
call
a
sub-critical
assembly
use
in
laboratory
-
like
condition
.
I
understand
that
become
obsolete
and
that
University
College
Cork
no
long
have
use
for
that
material
.
a
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
from
the
then
deputy
,
Senator
Humphrey
,
on
Tuesday
4
October
2011
state
:
ucc
be
hopeful
that
a
resolution
can
be
achieve
shortly
.
it
be
too
early
to
assess
the
cost
that
will
be
associate
with
disposal
at
this
time
.
the
component
of
the
SCA
be
last
inspect
by
the
European
Atomic
Energy
Community
on
6th
October
,
2010
.
the
nuclear
material
be
securely
store
at
ucc
in
a
proprietary
radioactive
waste
store
build
to
a
design
approve
by
RPII
.
what
be
the
status
of
that
waste
at
present
?
do
the
status
quo
pertain
or
will
this
material
be
dispose
of
responsibly
at
some
stage
in
the
future
?
I
know
at
the
time
the
government
make
funding
available
for
the
safe
disposal
of
material
of
that
nature
.
the
response
further
state
,
"
the
material
be
hold
at
ucc
under
licence
from
the
RPII
whose
inspector
regularly
inspect
this
store
in
addition
to
inspection
by
the
EU
and
by
the
IAEA
.
"
give
that
we
be
now
transfer
power
-
I
know
everything
transpose
as
seamlessly
as
possible
-
I
want
to
ensure
a
consistent
monitoring
of
that
material
and
that
the
minister
be
aware
of
its
existence
.
it
may
have
be
dispose
of
in
the
meantime
,
but
I
wish
to
ascertain
the
status
of
that
material
.
many
deputy
have
be
in
contact
with
the
chiropractor
.
what
be
the
status
of
they
interaction
with
government
?
perhaps
in
he
own
constituency
,
the
minister
have
have
contact
with
chiropractor
.
I
understand
they
case
be
make
via
the
Minister
for
Health
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
in
he
role
as
a
cabinet
minister
to
have
regard
to
they
position
.
they
be
reputable
and
responsible
practitioner
.
I
hope
the
government
can
devise
a
process
to
ensure
that
chiropractor
have
access
to
x
-
ray
.
on
a
second
stage
speech
we
have
a
certain
degree
of
leeway
.
technically
speak
it
do
not
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
Bill
,
but
the
material
with
which
they
be
deal
arguably
do
.
we
give
we
support
to
the
case
they
be
make
,
to
find
some
process
to
ensure
that
they
be
not
without
the
facility
of
x
-
ray
in
the
future
and
that
they
position
would
be
give
some
consideration
.
I
thank
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
for
the
Bill
digest
.
although
the
briefing
be
extremely
technical
,
a
very
comprehensive
brief
have
be
provide
for
we
.
I
,
like
my
colleague
in
this
House
,
have
a
interest
in
parliamentary
procedure
and
ask
the
minister
to
come
back
to
we
with
he
own
explanation
of
the
Mulcreevy
-
type
legal
issue
that
exist
with
the
transfer
of
responsibility
from
one
department
to
another
.
I
will
quote
from
the
report
that
we
have
be
give
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
:
''
Mulcreevy
type
''
legal
issue
arise
in
the
Supreme
Court
case
Michael
Mulcreevy
v
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
which
involve
the
construction
of
the
M50
and
its
potential
impact
on
the
archaeology
of
Carrickmines
.
this
case
involve
a
transfer
of
function
which
result
in
the
minister
effectively
have
to
consult
with
themselves
rather
than
consult
with
fellow
minister
as
be
the
aim
of
the
National
Monument
legislation
.
the
effect
be
that
the
number
of
body
that
have
to
be
consult
with
before
a
decision
be
make
be
reduce
from
three
to
two
.
the
case
hing
on
whether
primary
legislation
could
be
amend
by
secondary
legislation
.
the
Supreme
Court
find
it
could
not
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
outline
the
consultation
process
that
exist
when
the
decision
be
make
to
transfer
power
from
another
Department
to
he
Department
and
whether
that
be
a
seamless
transition
.
be
guarantee
in
place
to
ensure
that
it
do
not
become
subject
to
further
scrutiny
in
the
court
?
have
the
minister
discuss
it
with
the
Minister
for
Health
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
specifically
ask
the
minister
about
University
College
Cork
,
ucc
.
he
may
not
have
the
relevant
information
to
hand
.
I
thank
the
minister
.

I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
I
be
very
grateful
to
the
House
for
the
one
minute
and
a
little
bit
of
latitude
.
I
rise
simply
to
support
the
motion
,
recognise
the
fact
that
this
be
very
much
a
traditional
occupation
and
a
primary
source
of
income
for
harvester
.
I
simply
wish
it
to
be
a
matter
of
record
that
we
support
the
motion
before
the
House
.
we
absolutely
and
utterly
support
the
resolution
before
we
and
we
welcome
this
final
step
of
the
ratification
of
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
.
I
do
not
wish
to
sound
a
discordant
note
on
this
,
but
I
do
not
feel
there
be
a
strong
sense
of
history
about
this
moment
because
there
be
a
opportunity
here
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
outline
some
vision
for
the
legislation
that
will
be
require
to
give
force
to
this
ratification
.
like
previous
speaker
,
I
wish
to
state
the
Disability
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
Bill
,
which
we
know
pass
second
Stage
last
February
and
be
now
stuck
on
Committee
stage
,
be
long
overdue
and
need
to
be
bring
into
law
and
make
a
reality
.
already
we
have
disabled
people
speak
to
we
,
and
I
will
quote
from
a
email
I
receive
today
,
which
state
that
while
the
government
be
try
to
create
a
smokescreen
to
make
itself
look
good
,
people
with
disability
be
struggle
just
to
exist
in
a
Ireland
that
make
no
room
for
they
.
the
email
state
that
the
member
of
this
government
be
try
to
pretend
that
when
they
move
on
,
they
will
have
leave
a
legacy
of
equal
treatment
of
people
with
disability
,
that
the
latter
continue
to
be
deny
liberty
and
rights
that
everyone
else
enjoy
and
that
this
be
why
,
as
well
as
ratify
the
convention
,
the
government
need
to
legislate
against
the
deprivation
of
liberty
in
order
that
there
can
be
real
change
in
how
people
with
disability
be
treat
in
this
country
.
tonight
,
there
will
be
people
feel
that
there
be
still
a
long
way
to
go
.
I
read
carefully
the
statement
of
Senator
John
Dolan
,
somebody
who
I
think
we
all
look
towards
as
a
thought
leader
in
this
field
and
from
whom
we
have
all
seek
guidance
in
recognise
the
challenge
for
person
with
disability
.
I
do
not
wish
to
misinterpret
what
the
Senator
say
.
it
be
probably
unusual
to
quote
a
Senator
's
word
in
this
house
but
I
feel
the
need
to
do
so
.
he
state
:
I
must
also
stress
that
the
disabled
people
of
Ireland
and
they
family
will
only
experience
the
benefit
of
the
Convention
if
the
implementation
phase
of
this
Convention
be
fully
and
effectively
implement
.
and
this
implementation
be
entirely
the
responsibility
of
government
.
that
be
a
carefully
couch
statement
and
a
very
positive
way
of
say
that
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
can
feel
that
we
have
give
true
meaning
to
the
ratification
of
this
UN
convention
.
the
Senator
go
on
to
say
:
the
UN
CRPD
simply
seek
to
ensure
that
people
with
disability
experience
they
rights
.
Ireland
be
a
party
to
the
"
Universal
Declaration
of
human
Right
,
UN
,
1948
"
.
there
be
a
range
of
fundamental
rights
in
Bunreacht
to
hÉireann
.
rights
related
to
the
person
,
family
,
child
,
education
,
etc
.
the
outworking
of
this
be
simple
.
to
a
large
extent
,
it
be
a
resource
issue
.
as
member
of
this
House
,
we
all
put
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
at
the
Department
of
Health
.
I
recently
tab
a
question
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
regard
"
the
number
of
child
under
18
year
of
age
await
a
assessment
of
need
under
early
intervention
in
County
Cork
;
the
waiting
time
before
assessment
will
be
carry
out
;
and
the
number
of
staff
need
to
ensure
that
all
assessment
be
carry
out
"
.
I
have
figure
before
I
show
the
number
of
child
under
the
age
of
18
who
be
on
the
waiting
list
for
a
first
-
time
assessment
up
to
December
2017
.
I
will
highlight
one
element
of
that
.
there
be
5182
child
aged
between
five
year
and
17
year
and
11
month
who
have
be
wait
for
long
than
52
week
.
how
can
we
deal
with
the
issue
of
assessment
of
need
?
I
be
hope
for
something
in
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
about
the
vision
for
the
deployment
of
resource
to
give
true
meaning
to
the
convention
but
I
do
not
hear
it
.
perhaps
we
need
to
discuss
that
issue
further
.
in
my
constituency
,
there
be
a
three
year
old
child
who
have
be
wait
for
a
specialised
wheelchair
since
last
August
.
I
know
I
be
put
hard
case
forward
here
,
but
this
be
the
people
we
be
talk
about
.
this
concern
the
person
who
email
we
about
she
view
,
as
a
person
with
disability
,
on
the
government
's
ratification
of
the
UN
convention
and
the
absence
of
the
legislation
we
be
await
.
it
concern
the
mother
and
father
of
the
three
year
old
child
.
that
be
a
well
-
publicise
case
.
the
child
's
name
be
Adam
King
.
we
be
tell
that
the
government
will
spend
billion
on
a
new
national
plan
.
ordinary
people
who
be
wait
for
wheelchair
be
ask
I
where
be
the
money
for
they
requirement
.
they
ask
when
they
will
get
they
assessment
of
need
.
why
be
it
that
they
son
or
daughter
have
be
wait
more
than
52
week
for
a
assessment
of
need
?
we
need
to
start
join
the
dot
,
if
we
be
out
of
the
recession
and
there
be
now
money
in
the
kitty
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
indicate
that
he
have
secure
extra
funding
for
respite
care
.
he
refer
to
the
fact
that
€
1.76
billion
have
be
allocate
by
the
Department
of
Health
for
disability
service
in
2018
and
note
that
this
be
a
4.4
%
increase
on
2017
.
fair
play
to
the
Minister
of
State
.
he
be
do
he
job
in
stand
up
for
he
Department
and
he
set
of
responsibility
.
however
,
the
reality
be
that
when
we
look
at
how
that
increase
manifest
itself
,
we
do
not
see
evidence
of
delivery
of
service
.
something
be
happen
within
the
system
.
it
be
not
deliver
for
people
who
have
legitimate
expectation
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
can
have
a
great
interrogation
of
what
the
ratification
of
the
UNCRPD
will
mean
.
I
hope
that
we
can
have
a
great
interrogation
of
what
the
government
amendment
to
the
Disability
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
Bill
2016
will
actually
be
,
and
the
real
outcome
of
that
for
people
who
be
struggle
as
we
speak
.
notwithstanding
all
of
that
,
we
very
much
welcome
the
motion
.
however
,
we
need
to
see
it
buttress
through
legislation
.
we
need
to
see
it
soon
rather
than
late
.
I
thank
the
Member
present
for
they
indulgence
.
we
have
go
on
15
minute
long
but
it
be
a
important
issue
.
I
thank

I
thank
the
Member
present
for
they
indulgence
.
we
have
go
on
15
minute
long
but
it
be
a
important
issue
.
I
be
speak
on
behalf
of
a
three
year
old
boy
from
Killeagh
in
County
Cork
,
Adam
King
.
he
have
be
wait
for
a
wheelchair
since
last
July
.
I
have
be
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
about
this
for
several
month
when
Adam
can
expect
to
receive
he
wheelchair
.
it
be
a
shame
that
when
there
be
a
increase
allocation
of
resource
,
particularly
to
the
Health
Service
executive
,
HSE
,
that
facility
cannot
be
afford
to
a
three
year
old
boy
.
his
parent
,
Fiona
and
David
,
say
that
he
dignity
and
safety
be
compromise
daily
.
without
a
wheelchair
,
he
be
force
to
spend
much
of
he
time
on
the
ground
on
all
four
.
he
have
a
walking
frame
but
he
mother
,
Fiona
,
say
that
it
be
too
heavy
to
manoeuvre
comfortably
and
he
tire
quickly
.
he
can
walk
extremely
slowly
for
a
few
metre
before
need
a
break
and
,
as
I
say
,
he
be
on
a
waiting
list
for
a
replacement
walking
frame
since
July
2017
.
he
be
due
to
start
preschool
in
August
and
will
need
to
be
train
in
the
use
of
the
wheelchair
in
advance
to
do
everyday
task
.
for
example
,
he
will
need
to
learn
how
to
hoist
himself
from
it
onto
the
toilet
.
I
find
it
a
little
undignified
to
have
to
make
the
case
in
this
house
for
a
three
year
old
child
at
a
time
when
we
have
increase
resource
.
the
manner
in
which
the
waiting
list
be
operate
be
a
cause
of
major
frustration
for
Adam
's
parent
.
last
December
,
Adam
be
top
of
the
Enable
Ireland
list
but
since
then
he
have
fall
back
to
fourth
on
the
list
.
at
the
rate
at
which
wheelchair
be
allocate
he
mother
,
Fiona
,
estimate
it
could
be
May
or
June
before
he
application
be
approve
.
there
be
no
complaint
by
the
family
against
enable
Ireland
.
Adam
's
parent
say
that
he
therapist
from
a
physiotherapy
and
occupational
therapy
point
of
view
be
wonderful
.
they
critique
be
of
the
HSE
resource
allocation
group
which
meet
fortnightly
,
or
monthly
.
at
that
meeting
all
the
disability
organisation
,
include
the
COPE
Foundation
and
Enable
Ireland
,
present
they
waiting
list
,
index
in
order
of
clinical
need
and
application
for
aid
and
appliance
be
also
receive
from
community
health
care
organisation
and
acute
hospital
on
behalf
of
patient
who
be
be
discharge
.
while
Fiona
and
David
recognise
that
Adam
be
de
facto
compete
with
adult
who
be
in
the
acute
hospital
system
,
they
would
in
no
way
wish
for
anybody
else
to
be
deprive
of
they
service
if
they
have
a
more
urgent
need
but
they
,
and
I
,
fail
to
understand
,
as
I
be
sure
would
anybody
in
this
House
,
why
at
a
time
when
we
have
increase
resource
owe
to
increase
tax
intake
,
economic
growth
and
so
on
,
the
methodology
use
to
allocate
resource
cannot
be
look
at
afresh
so
that
we
do
not
have
compete
with
adult
for
what
be
a
basic
human
right
.
yesterday
,
the
Dáil
debate
a
motion
on
the
ratification
of
the
Unite
Nation
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
.
it
be
ironic
that
Adam
be
not
have
he
rights
or
entitlement
enforce
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
reply
.
to
be
fair
to
he
,
he
have
empathise
with
the
case
.
I
welcome
he
comment
in
regard
to
the
Department
have
identify
the
need
for
a
improvement
programme
in
area
in
which
there
be
a
allocation
of
source
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
this
three
year
old
child
's
social
development
be
be
affect
because
he
immobility
be
be
limit
and
he
cannot
join
in
and
play
with
other
child
.
we
need
a
speedy
resolution
of
this
case
.
I
believe
there
be
money
available
to
do
this
and
that
the
methodology
by
which
money
be
allocate
can
always
be
change
.
I
hope
that
Adam
can
receive
he
wheelchair
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
hope
that
it
will
not
be
2019
before
he
receive
what
be
effectively
a
human
right
.
article
7.2
of
the
Unite
Nation
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
,
UNCRPD
,
state
that
in
all
action
concern
a
child
with
disability
the
good
interest
of
the
child
shall
be
a
primary
concern
.
accord
to
Adam
's
father
,
as
wait
list
and
practice
be
not
common
across
jurisdiction
how
can
we
as
a
nation
genuinely
believe
that
article
7.2
of
the
UNCRPD
can
be
enact
in
what
appear
to
a
unequal
system
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
comment
.
I
hope
that
in
raise
this
case
in
the
dáil
cognisance
will
be
take
of
the
fact
there
be
a
three
year
old
boy
in
we
midst
who
need
a
wheelchair
now
.
this
be
a
timely
and
important
review
of
the
credit
union
sector
,
a
sector
which
have
serve
the
people
of
Ireland
well
and
which
continue
to
deliver
excellent
service
in
a
ethical
manner
in
community
from
which
the
banking
sector
,
one
could
argue
,
be
exist
.
credit
union
director
,
manager
and
staff
have
willingly
adopt
seismic
change
in
the
four
short
year
since
the
enactment
of
the
last
credit
Union
Act
.
they
have
survive
unrelenting
regulation
and
universal
restriction
at
a
time
when
the
bank
be
still
be
allow
to
get
away
with
murder
by
they
share
regulator
,
the
Central
Bank
.
it
be
evident
that
the
Central
Bank
be
well
advance
on
its
road
to
eliminate
small
credit
union
while
handicap
the
medium
and
large
one
.
the
report
call
for
constructive
engagement
between
the
regulator
and
the
regulate
.
it
be
evident
during
the
hearing
and
have
be
evident
since
they
conclude
that
this
be
not
happen
and
will
not
happen
.
shortly
after
the
hearing
wind
up
,
the
Central
Bank
issue
a
series
of
further
restriction
on
credit
union
deposit
investment
despite
widespread
opposition
.
put
simply
,
the
Central
Bank
be
actively
limit
credit
union
investment
option
.
this
be
the
most
powerful
Central
bank
in
Europe
when
it
come
to
credit
union
and
it
do
not
manage
its
power
well
.
the
joint
committee
recommend
that
a
new
appeal
mechanism
should
be
introduce
to
facilitate
appeal
of
regulatory
decision
to
a
independent
body
.
this
be
long
overdue
and
should
now
be
pursue
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
the
credit
union
director
and
staff
we
all
know
be
decent
people
.
they
have
show
a
great
capacity
for
change
yet
we
now
witness
a
breakdown
in
the
relationship
between
the
all
-
powerful
Central
Bank
and
this
decent
people
.
I
be
very
pleased
,
therefore
,
that
the
report
suggest
a
alternative
dispute
resolution
method
.
I
be
also
pleased
to
see
the
recommendation
in
the
report
to
make
regulatory
impact
analysis
a
feature
in
the
future
.
this
be
standard
in
developed
regulatory
jurisdiction
and
be
a
very
firm
requirement
of
the
commission
on
credit
union
.
unfortunately
,
it
have
be
ignore
by
the
Central
Bank
.
it
be
disturbing
to
read
in
the
report
that
the
representative
body
raise
serious
concern
about
the
exist
regulatory
environment
.
they
view
be
that
the
current
framework
be
disproportionate
,
too
costly
and
burdensome
,
stymy
innovation
,
restrict
opportunity
for
credit
union
to
lend
to
and
support
member
and
community
and
prevent
the
sector
from
receive
a
fair
return
on
investment
.
the
Central
Bank
have
stubbornly
refuse
to
introduce
tiered
regulation
to
make
it
proportionate
to
scale
and
complexity
.
I
be
perplex
by
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
that
tiered
regulation
be
the
subject
of
consultation
in
2013
by
the
Central
Bank
which
propose
a
two
-
tier
regulatory
model
to
which
the
sector
be
not
amenable
at
the
time
.
he
say
it
be
unclear
what
form
of
tiered
regulation
the
sector
want
.
I
be
confused
by
that
statement
.
the
minister
go
on
to
say
that
,
in
light
of
the
feedback
receive
,
the
Central
Bank
do
not
propose
to
introduce
a
tier
regulatory
framework
at
that
time
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
D'Arcy
,
who
be
formerly
a
member
of
the
committee
.
however
,
I
be
confused
by
he
statement
which
warrant
further
interrogation
.
the
Central
Bank
's
one
-
size
-
fit
-
all
approach
be
a
blunt
and
ineffective
instrument
.
volunteer
director
and
pay
staff
live
in
terror
of
the
heavy
hand
of
the
regulator
which
know
it
can
push
small
organisation
around
,
unlike
we
serial
mortgage
offender
in
the
banking
sector
.
the
cost
of
regulation
be
crush
and
it
be
erod
credit
union
surplus
.
the
only
people
win
out
in
all
of
this
be
the
so
-
call
"
expert
consultant
"
who
charge
inflate
fee
to
credit
union
.
Recent
Central
bank
speech
have
focus
on
diminish
return
on
asset
,
which
be
a
small
wonder
give
the
range
of
penal
regulatory
charge
,
direct
and
indirect
,
the
same
bank
impose
on
credit
union
.
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
have
be
place
on
the
relatively
low
loan
-
to
-
savings
ratio
in
credit
union
.
the
main
problem
here
be
the
cost
of
regulatory
reserve
.
every
€
10
lodge
in
a
credit
union
cost
it
€
1
in
reserve
cost
.
here
again
,
the
Central
Bank
have
refuse
to
move
to
a
risk
-
base
reserving
model
which
be
10
%
of
loan
rather
than
10
%
of
asset
.
credit
union
be
saddle
with
a
huge
bill
as
a
result
.
it
should
be
remember
that
member
of
the
public
decide
voluntarily
in
the
credit
union
which
be
,
in
a
increase
number
of
case
,
the
only
financial
institution
leave
in
they
community
.
I
be
aware
of
credit
union
which
be
refuse
savings
from
member
because
they
cannot
afford
the
regulatory
reserve
cost
.
it
be
unacceptable
that
the
Central
Bank
be
so
obdurate
as
to
penalise
member
of
the
public
in
this
manner
.
it
be
very
poor
regulation
indeed
which
force
money
to
be
hide
in
mattress
and
press
.
it
be
very
disturbing
to
learn
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
at
the
committee
how
many
of
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
on
credit
Union
have
be
ignore
by
the
Central
Bank
.
it
be
seven
in
all
.
this
be
indicative
of
a
culture
of
intolerance
towards
credit
union
in
the
Central
Bank
.
I
highlight
the
support
in
the
report
for
the
retention
of
the
common
bond
structure
which
be
essential
to
underpin
the
community
and
democratic
base
of
credit
union
.
the
action
which
the
government
most
immediately
need
to
take
on
foot
of
the
report
be
to
establish
a
financial
vehicle
to
allow
credit
union
to
,
at
last
,
invest
in
tier
3
approve
housing
body
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
make
some
reference
to
this
and
we
await
progress
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
status
of
the
public
banking
investigation
.
we
have
be
tell
since
before
Christmas
that
the
report
be
complete
.
we
be
await
its
publication
.
this
will
also
have
a
impact
on
the
future
of
the
credit
union
's
business
model
.
be
we
content
to
have
Ireland
go
back
to
a
banking
duopoly
involve
allied
Irish
Banks
and
Bank
of
Ireland
?
be
we
prepare
to
risk
we
entire
society
again
by
be
hold
to
ransom
by
this
two
institution
in
any
future
global
financial
crisis
?
we
need
to
defend
and
protect
we
society
against
such
threat
.
we
need
to
strengthen
and
expand
we
credit
union
movement
.
we
need
a
vision
for
the
sector
from
the
government
and
a
framework
for
credit
union
to
move
forward
over
the
medium
to
long
term
.
the
government
must
establish
a
financial
vehicle
so
the
credit
union
can
at
last
invest
in
social
housing
.
we
await
further
word
on
that
.
the
requirement
of
the
commission
on
credit
union
for
regulatory
impact
analysis
must
be
also
meet
.
I
welcome
the
committee
's
report
.
we
hope
its
recommendation
will
be
take
seriously
.
I
say
we
would
do
so
but
the
deputy
choose
to
ignore
that
.
I
say
we
would
do
so
but
the
deputy
choose
to
ignore
that
.
I
say
we
would
do
so
but
the
deputy
choose
to
ignore
that
.
so
the
constituency
be
marginal
.
you
be
admit
it
.
he
have
just
admit
it
.
why
do
we
not
talk
about
they
next
?
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Joan
Burton
.
we
be
support
this
motion
.
by
virtue
of
the
fact
we
be
support
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
,
and
it
would
appear
Fianna
Fáil
be
also
support
it
,
one
sense
there
be
a
trend
towards
the
motion
be
successful
.
while
I
would
not
wish
to
pre-empt
the
outcome
of
the
vote
on
Thursday
,
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
be
successful
,
will
the
government
recognise
the
voice
of
this
house
in
term
of
what
the
motion
seek
to
do
and
will
it
act
accordingly
?
we
have
note
a
trend
of
late
,
when
motion
come
before
this
House
and
the
government
be
defeat
,
that
there
be
inaction
and
the
voice
of
the
House
be
not
recognise
.
I
want
to
restate
that
we
be
support
the
motion
and
we
hope
that
,
should
it
be
successful
,
it
will
be
respect
.
the
Tánaiste
in
he
speech
state
that
the
establishment
of
a
strategic
communication
unit
in
the
Department
of
the
Taoiseach
be
to
create
a
communication
programme
lead
by
the
Taoiseach
under
the
auspices
of
the
Global
Irish
economic
Forum
.
I
believe
he
be
take
the
justification
for
the
establishment
of
that
so
-
call
SCU
out
of
context
.
that
recommendation
be
make
in
2011
,
when
we
be
in
the
maelstrom
of
a
global
downturn
and
in
a
situation
where
350000
people
have
lose
they
job
between
2008
and
2011
.
the
context
in
which
he
be
use
that
justification
,
I
contend
,
be
utterly
out
of
context
.
I
think
there
be
a
bit
of
fake
news
go
on
and
a
little
bit
of
spin
.
he
be
justify
the
establishment
of
a
SCU
base
on
a
Global
Irish
economic
Forum
,
which
many
of
we
have
attend
,
but
that
be
at
a
time
when
we
be
quite
literally
on
we
knee
economically
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
a
SCU
be
to
be
establish
,
that
be
with
a
view
to
messaging
outwards
and
in
a
global
context
.
it
be
not
for
the
purpose
of
take
out
two
-
page
advertorial
,
with
soft
journalism
quote
only
from
Fine
Gael
representative
in
newspaper
like
the
Corkman
.
it
be
disingenuous
for
the
Tánaiste
to
come
to
the
House
and
say
that
be
the
reasoning
behind
it
.
we
have
yet
to
ascertain
just
how
much
be
pay
by
the
government
and
,
by
extension
,
the
taxpayer
for
this
advertorial
which
only
quote
from
Fine
Gael
or
government
representative
.
they
be
pitch
as
hard
news
when
,
in
fact
,
the
only
thing
one
could
see
that
be
a
nod
to
the
fact
they
be
advertorial
be
that
the
piece
be
head
,
"
Project
Ireland
2040
-
in
partnership
with
Rialtas
to
hÉireann
"
.
it
be
a
classic
piece
of
propaganda
.
if
we
be
tell
at
the
outset
that
this
be
what
they
be
go
to
do
,
we
might
have
understand
the
need
to
communicate
.
every
government
have
the
right
to
communicate
and
political
communication
be
absolutely
appropriate
when
one
be
in
government
.
it
be
advisable
that
the
work
of
the
State
and
of
the
government
should
be
communicate
to
the
people
so
they
know
what
be
happen
on
matter
that
pertain
to
they
everyday
life
.
nobody
would
argue
against
that
premise
.
however
,
what
we
have
here
be
a
blatant
and
political
use
of
taxpayer
's
funding
to
present
a
message
in
a
way
that
be
favourable
to
member
of
the
government
down
to
the
most
local
level
.
that
be
plain
wrong
.
we
wish
that
,
through
this
motion
,
should
it
be
successful
and
if
the
will
of
this
House
be
such
that
it
seek
to
abandon
or
abolish
the
strategic
communication
unit
,
the
government
would
adhere
to
the
wish
of
this
House
.
in

with
the
order

I
welcome
and
support
the
motion
.
it
be
now
clear
that
it
will
be
assent
to
by
the
majority
of
member
.
the
question
to
be
ask
be
what
action
will
be
take
as
a
result
of
its
passing
because
,
increasingly
,
we
be
see
motion
be
pass
by
the
House
but
little
or
no
action
thereafter
.
the
motion
be
very
practical
.
it
speak
to
the
concern
of
business
owner
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
.
there
be
one
line
in
it
that
I
want
to
highlight
.
it
read
:
"
call
on
the
government
to
...
legally
oblige
insurer
to
provide
a
breakdown
of
the
premium
cost
to
the
business
and
to
provide
more
information
to
the
business
on
how
premium
be
calculate
"
.
we
do
not
have
transparency
in
the
process
on
the
cost
of
premium
for
individual
business
and
small
business
owner
throughout
the
country
.
until
such
time
as
we
have
transparency
,
all
of
the
rhetoric
and
the
work
do
for
the
cost
of
insurance
work
group
's
report
will
be
for
nautht
.
we
will
not
have
transparency
until
the
minister
tackle
that
dynamic
and
be
able
to
see
which
inherent
cost
within
premium
be
to
make
provision
for
bad
debt
and
claim
against
a
insurance
company
and
for
super
-
normal
profit
.
I
agree
with
previous
speaker
.
the
insurance
industry
be
act
like
a
cartel
.
insurance
company
be
not
be
transparent
on
the
profit
they
be
earn
and
if
they
be
not
be
transparent
on
the
profit
they
be
earn
,
they
can
charge
ordinary
people
whatever
premium
they
wish
.
if
there
be
one
entity
in
the
country
that
seem
to
be
the
voice
of
all
of
the
big
gun
,
the
international
player
which
begin
with
the
letter
a
,
for
instance
,
it
be
Insurance
Ireland
.
in
interaction
with
the
finance
committee
on
issue
such
as
the
book
of
quantum
,
the
level
and
consistency
of
award
and
the
high
cost
of
premium
the
view
of
the
insurance
company
seem
to
have
be
articulate
through
one
vehicle
-
Insurance
Ireland
.
because
we
do
not
see
the
name
and
face
,
the
insurance
sector
be
able
to
hide
behind
Insurance
Ireland
and
we
still
do
not
have
transparency
.
that
be
partly
the
reason
insurance
premium
be
so
high
.
it
be
because
the
insurance
company
be
earn
super
-
normal
profit
which
be
in
-
build
in
the
cost
of
each
and
every
premium
pay
throughout
the
land
.
I
want
to
refer
specifically
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Michael
D'Arcy
's
contribution
.
in
speak
about
the
level
and
consistency
of
award
and
the
book
of
quantum
he
state
:
the
first
be
that
there
should
be
less
reason
for
case
to
go
to
litigation
as
the
level
of
award
grant
by
the
court
will
be
align
with
that
provide
by
PIAB
.
this
in
turn
should
mean
a
reduction
in
legal
cost
.
secondly
,
a
stable
claim
and
award
environment
should
mean
that
the
reserve
put
aside
by
insurer
to
meet
future
claim
would
not
have
to
be
regularly
adjust
to
reflect
new
development
such
as
increase
in
award
level
.
we
do
not
know
in
real
term
what
reserve
insurance
company
put
aside
and
until
such
time
as
there
be
that
transparency
,
it
be
impossible
to
predict
the
level
and
consistency
of
award
.
in
other
word
,
it
be
impossible
to
predict
with
certainty
that
it
will
result
in
a
decrease
in
the
cost
of
premium
for
individual
and
business
.
there
be
still
a
long
way
to
go
and
,
to
be
fair
to
the
Minister
of
State
who
be
formerly
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
,
I
do
not
doubt
he
bona
fide
in
seek
to
take
action
on
the
issue
,
but
what
we
need
be
a
sense
of
urgency
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
a
intervention
by
the
State
because
it
seem
that
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
have
only
be
tinker
at
the
edge
.
it
do
not
appear
to
have
weigh
in
or
be
imbue
with
the
resource
it
need
to
fully
interrogate
insurance
company
to
see
whether
they
be
act
as
a
cartel
.
what
the
Minister
of
State
probably
need
to
tackle
this
issue
be
the
resource
to
attract
people
from
the
private
sector
to
organisation
such
as
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
and
pay
they
commensurate
salary
.
I
refer
to
forensic
accountant
and
so
on
who
would
be
able
to
go
in
and
examine
the
insurance
company
to
see
what
they
be
do
on
the
inside
.
until
such
that
happen
,
I
fear
that
we
will
be
back
here
again
in
12
month
's
time
pay
lip
service
to
the
people
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
who
have
be
listen
to
politician
like
I
talk
for
a
long
time
about
the
cost
of
do
business
and
who
want
to
see
some
action
be
take
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
we
have
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2018
which
be
government
policy
but
nowhere
in
it
do
it
speak
about
the
increase
cost
of
do
business
in
the
domestic
sector
.
we
will
bend
over
backwards
to
help
a
IDA
Ireland
back
company
come
to
Ireland
.
I
say
that
as
a
former
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Jobs
and
Innovation
.
we
will
do
everything
for
a
Enterprise
Ireland
back
company
,
but
what
we
now
need
to
do
be
start
to
look
after
the
company
,
the
challenge
of
which
be
represent
by
the
motion
and
which
want
to
see
real
action
be
take
now
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
Communication
,
climate
action
and
environment
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
149(
1
)
.
the
first
issue
I
wish
to
raise
relate
to
the
complexity
of
the
datum
protection
code
.
in
Ireland
we
have
choose
to
retain
most
of
the
data
Protection
Act
1988
and
2003
,
although
we
will
in
the
future
apply
they
only
to
case
involve
national
security
,
defence
or
international
relation
.
for
every
other
case
,
we
will
have
the
new
EU
datum
protection
regulation
which
have
173
recital
and
99
article
.
we
will
also
have
this
implement
Bill
which
have
165
section
and
three
schedule
.
the
Bill
and
the
regulation
will
have
to
be
read
side
by
side
.
data
protection
compliance
be
as
pervasive
a
issue
in
modern
society
as
tax
compliance
and
the
code
be
become
as
complex
,
attract
its
own
cohort
of
professional
adviser
who
be
need
to
explain
all
of
it
to
that
of
we
who
must
comply
with
it
.
the
rule
do
not
just
apply
to
the
Mark
Zuckerbergs
and
Denis
O'Briens
of
this
world
.
the
reality
be
that
every
one
of
we
who
have
even
a
basic
mobile
phone
that
store
name
and
number
be
a
datum
controller
in
the
eye
of
the
law
.
year
ago
the
code
be
extend
to
apply
to
manual
as
well
as
electronic
record
.
the
rule
will
not
apply
to
what
be
call
"
purely
personal
or
household
activity
"
,
but
if
someone
have
any
name
or
number
on
he
or
she
phone
that
he
or
she
no
long
need
for
personal
or
household
activity
,
strictly
this
law
will
apply
to
that
person
and
he
or
she
will
be
in
breach
of
it
.
I
wonder
how
many
citizen
be
aware
of
this
.
a
example
of
the
complexity
be
the
rule
relate
to
child
.
first
,
there
be
the
so
-
call
digital
age
of
consent
.
this
be
the
age
at
which
a
child
have
the
capacity
to
consent
to
the
processing
of
personal
datum
by
the
provider
of
a
"
information
society
service
"
.
the
regulation
deal
with
personal
datum
,
datum
that
identify
or
be
about
a
individual
person
and
include
name
,
address
,
date
of
birth
and
anything
that
a
person
share
on
social
media
such
he
or
she
preference
,
status
update
and
,
in
many
case
,
private
conversation
over
messaging
app
,
among
other
element
.
a
key
issue
in
the
gdpr
involve
the
notion
of
profiling
.
profiling
be
essentially
about
use
algorithm
,
datum
analytic
and
artificial
intelligence
to
predict
what
a
person
might
like
,
what
he
or
she
fear
might
be
,
what
he
or
she
bias
might
be
,
what
advertisement
he
or
she
would
like
to
see
and
to
what
message
he
or
she
would
respond
well
.
while
this
all
sound
of
little
consequence
,
recent
scandal
such
as
that
involve
Cambridge
Analytica
show
that
profiling
be
a
extremely
powerful
tool
and
can
be
use
to
undermine
democracy
and
manipulate
ordinary
citizen
.
the
tool
use
to
profile
user
be
complex
computer
algorithm
that
use
machine
learning
,
datum
analytic
and
artificial
intelligence
.
a
major
question
in
the
context
of
datum
protection
be
whether
the
typical
user
of
any
online
platform
on
which
one
share
datum
actually
have
a
good
enough
understanding
of
how
this
algorithm
work
and
what
the
consequence
of
share
datum
that
be
feed
to
they
might
be
.
before
proceed
,
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
people
like
Professor
Barry
O'Sullivan
,
to
whom
I
have
defer
on
this
matter
as
a
guide
on
its
technical
element
.
Professor
O'Sullivan
,
who
be
a
professor
of
computer
science
at
University
College
Cork
,
highlight
to
I
that
a
important
point
to
remember
be
that
the
Internet
be
design
as
a
democratic
environment
in
which
all
user
be
treat
and
regard
equally
.
as
a
consequence
,
no
special
allowance
be
make
for
child
online
,
but
they
do
deserve
special
attention
.
there
have
be
considerable
debate
in
the
House
on
the
digital
age
of
consent
.
it
be
Professor
O'Sullivan
's
contention
,
as
a
expert
in
the
field
,
that
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
not
about
when
child
can
go
online
,
use
device
,
etc.
;
rather
,
it
only
relate
to
situation
where
the
processing
of
the
personal
datum
of
a
child
be
perform
.
the
Bill
set
the
Irish
digital
age
of
consent
at
the
low
possible
age
-
13
year
-
but
do
we
believe
a
child
of
13
be
able
to
understand
the
power
of
algorithmic
profiling
?
do
we
believe
child
understand
how
they
action
online
influence
the
advert
that
they
see
or
the
content
suggest
to
they
?
the
answer
be
surely
not
.
of
course
,
one
can
easily
make
this
argument
against
16
year
old
also
,
but
we
should
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
set
the
digital
age
of
consent
at
the
upper
end
of
the
allow
age
band
,
that
being
,
16
year
.
do
so
would
keep
Ireland
in
line
with
Germany
,
the
Netherlands
,
France
and
other
that
have
well
-
in
-
the
-
class
approach
to
protect
child
online
.
a
digital
age
of
consent
low
than
16
year
be
out
of
line
with
the
age
of
consent
for
other
matter
,
for
instance
,
give
consent
for
health
procedure
.
it
be
important
that
parent
have
the
power
to
give
consent
for
young
child
,
which
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
year
would
provide
.
Parent
need
to
be
in
a
position
to
parent
they
child
,
not
to
be
exclude
in
this
instance
at
the
age
of
13
year
.
advocate
for
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
13
year
might
argue
that
child
have
a
right
to
a
voice
online
and
a
right
to
participation
.
no
one
be
argue
against
this
.
however
,
the
digital
age
of
consent
only
apply
when
they
personal
datum
be
be
gather
and
process
.
the
argument
should
be
about
provide
child
under
the
digital
age
of
consent
with
platform
that
do
not
exploit
they
personal
datum
as
a
condition
of
they
use
.
this
be
particularly
important
for
vulnerable
young
child
who
should
not
have
to
rely
on
parental
consent
.
the
issue
in
this
instance
become
the
provision
of
safe
place
online
that
protect
they
anonymity
and
platform
that
do
not
profile
they
on
the
basis
of
personal
datum
.
rely
on
commercial
platform
such
as
Facebook
,
Instagram
,
Snapchat
and
other
to
provide
such
safe
place
or
to
attempt
to
use
they
as
such
put
vulnerable
child
at
risk
.
such
risk
can
arise
from
the
unintentional
breach
of
they
anonymity
,
they
target
through
advertising
and
marketing
campaign
base
on
they
interaction
online
and
the
potential
exposure
to
individual
online
who
might
not
have
they
good
interest
at
heart
.
many
special
interest
group
and
child
's
rights
representative
have
argue
for
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
13
year
.
some
of
the
argument
include
the
question
of
how
we
should
support
child
whose
parent
be
,
for
example
,
abusive
and
,
therefore
,
cannot
be
rely
on
to
give
consent
;
the
need
for
a
child
in
care
to
have
access
to
he
or
she
birth
family
,
other
family
member
and
friend
where
it
be
not
clear
who
have
the
power
of
parental
consent
;
and
that
child
who
need
access
to
support
and
preventive
service
.
it
be
important
to
stress
that
it
be
dangerous
to
rely
on
social
media
platform
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
vulnerable
or
at
-
risk
child
to
network
with
like
-
minded
child
.
first
,
the
existence
of
this
child
on
such
platform
be
often
easy
to
discover
by
a
parent
.
for
example
,
if
the
child
and
the
parent
use
phone
to
access
Facebook
and
each
have
the
mobile
number
of
the
other
on
he
or
she
phone
,
Facebook
can
recommend
each
of
they
as
a
possible
friend
to
the
other
.
in
other
word
,
the
anonymity
of
the
child
be
not
protect
,
as
have
be
argue
on
social
media
site
.
second
,
the
close
group
might
themselves
be
dangerous
since
predatory
individual
might
lurk
in
they
to
befriend
vulnerable
child
.
the
solution
that
must
be
provide
to
support
the
child
of
abusive
parent
be
not
standard
social
media
company
but
platform
that
be
safe
and
that
do
not
process
personal
datum
,
which
would
make
they
exempt
from
the
digital
age
of
consent
.
who
have
parental
responsibility
for
the
child
be
something
that
should
be
clarify
in
the
data
Protection
Bill
2018
.
for
example
,
such
consent
could
be
give
by
the
person
or
entity
that
have
guardianship
of
the
child
.
this
be
something
the
Bill
need
to
include
and
that
can
easily
be
solve
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
complexity
of
the
world
in
which
child
live
.
in
this
party
we
take
the
view
that
we
should
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
that
the
most
appropriate
digital
age
of
consent
be
16
year
.
the
regulation
define
a
information
society
service
as
a
service
normally
provide
for
remuneration
at
a
distance
by
electronic
means
and
at
the
individual
request
of
a
recipient
of
the
service
.
it
include
service
that
be
not
directly
remunerate
by
that
who
receive
they
,
if
they
represent
a
economic
activity
.
Google
search
,
as
a
obvious
example
,
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
information
society
service
.
the
government
have
decide
to
set
at
13
year
the
age
at
which
a
child
can
consent
to
the
processing
of
he
or
she
personal
datum
in
connection
with
a
offer
from
a
information
society
service
.
I
note
that
a
Seanad
amendment
provide
for
a
review
of
this
age
limit
after
three
year
.
however
,
the
Bill
contain
provision
relate
to
code
of
conduct
for
the
protection
of
child
who
,
for
this
purpose
,
be
all
person
under
18
year
of
age
.
we
will
have
13
year
old
with
the
capacity
to
sign
away
they
personal
datum
,
even
though
for
the
next
five
year
of
they
life
they
will
be
the
subject
of
special
protective
code
because
in
the
eye
of
the
law
they
be
still
child
.
it
be
a
contradiction
in
term
.
on
top
of
this
,
we
have
to
incorporate
the
common
law
rule
relate
to
child
and
contract
.
as
I
see
it
,
this
rule
have
not
be
displace
or
amend
by
the
Bill
.
article
8
of
the
regulation
specifically
state
its
provision
"
shall
not
affect
the
general
contract
law
of
Member
State
such
as
the
rule
on
the
validity
,
formation
or
effect
of
a
contract
in
relation
to
a
child
"
.
what
be
the
position
on
this
apparent
contradiction
?
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
not
about
a
child
's
general
capacity
to
enter
into
a
contract
;
it
be
solely
about
he
or
she
capacity
to
consent
to
the
processing
of
personal
datum
.
it
do
not
affect
the
general
law
of
Ireland
on
the
validity
or
effect
of
a
contract
with
a
child
or
so
it
state
.
as
I
say
,
under
Irish
common
law
,
a
individual
do
not
have
full
capacity
to
make
a
contract
until
he
or
she
be
18
year
of
age
.
there
be
a
exception
for
the
sale
to
a
minor
of
what
the
law
call
"
necessary
"
.
if
this
common
law
rule
be
leave
in
place
and
unamended
,
it
seem
that
the
outcome
will
be
that
a
minor
will
have
the
capacity
at
13
year
to
consent
to
the
processing
of
he
or
she
personal
datum
but
may
not
have
capacity
to
enter
the
substantive
contract
in
question
on
the
grounds
that
it
be
not
a
contract
for
a
"
necessary
"
.
whether
the
contract
be
for
a
necessary
entirely
depend
on
a
court
's
view
on
the
contract
in
question
and
,
in
particular
,
the
goods
or
service
in
question
and
the
minor
's
need
for
they
.
if
that
be
so
,
in
such
a
case
the
contract
will
be
unenforceable
against
the
minor
such
that
,
for
example
,
any
debt
accrue
will
not
be
recoverable
.
my
point
be
not
so
much
about
whether
this
be
good
or
bad
rule
.
my
question
be
whether
it
be
a
improvement
to
have
two
set
of
rule
that
can
conflict
with
each
other
and
which
cease
to
apply
at
different
age
.
that
be
the
nub
of
what
I
be
say
.
I
will
speak
briefly
about
electoral
activity
.
follow
the
Cambridge
Analytica
saga
,
the
mass
manipulation
of
personal
datum
bank
for
electoral
and
referendum
purpose
have
attract
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
comment
.
the
minister
respond
in
the
Seanad
with
amendment
to
section
45
.
the
section
now
provide
that
,
as
a
exception
to
a
general
prohibition
,
the
processing
of
personal
datum
reveal
political
opinion
be
lawful
where
it
be
carry
out
in
the
course
of
electoral
activity
in
the
State
by
a
political
party
or
candidate
or
a
referendum
commission
.
I
wonder
if
this
tightly
draft
exception
have
miss
the
point
.
as
I
understand
it
,
Cambridge
Analytica
be
not
accuse
of
process
personal
datum
that
reveal
political
opinion
.
it
be
accuse
of
amass
datum
from
internet
usage
that
enable
it
to
compile
a
crude
psychological
profile
of
a
individual
in
order
to
assist
a
advertiser
in
decide
how
to
shape
a
political
message
that
would
specially
appeal
to
that
individual
,
a
custom
design
message
that
would
not
be
see
by
the
broad
mass
of
voter
.
if
that
be
correct
,
I
do
not
see
how
section
45
would
apply
to
this
activity
at
all
.
the
section
,
as
amend
,
do
seem
broad
enough
to
cover
political
canvassing
and
the
mark
of
the
register
,
but
,
as
the
minister
seem
to
admit
in
the
Seanad
,
it
be
not
a
form
of
exemption
envisage
by
the
regulation
.
in
other
word
,
there
do
not
seem
to
be
a
specific
provision
of
the
regulation
that
enable
the
Oireachtas
to
carve
out
a
exception
enable
the
processing
of
political
opinion
for
electoral
purpose
.
the
good
the
minister
can
point
to
be
recital
(
56
)
which
state
"
where
in
the
course
of
electoral
activity
,
the
operation
of
the
democratic
system
in
a
Member
State
require
that
political
party
compile
personal
datum
on
people
's
political
opinion
"
and
so
forth
.
I
note
that
the
minister
have
say
he
intend
to
bring
forward
a
amendment
.
I
do
not
know
if
it
will
speak
specifically
to
that
issue
.
I
be
hopeful
it
will
.
we
be
put
he
on
notice
that
it
be
we
intention
to
speak
to
this
issue
further
on
committee
stage
.
we
in
this
House
and
the
Upper
House
,
councillor
and
every
elect
representative
in
the
country
be
not
always
electioneer
.
we
aim
to
always
be
ready
for
a
election
.
in
the
interim
,
we
act
as
a
citizen
advice
bureau
and
social
worker
,
legal
adviser
,
advocate
and
facilitator
.
we
explain
and
,
to
some
extent
,
humanise
the
bureaucracy
of
the
State
on
behalf
of
we
constituent
.
this
daily
routine
of
we
life
have
nothing
to
do
with
section
45
.
it
be
not
electoral
activity
and
do
not
involve
process
datum
on
political
opinion
,
but
in
this
process
we
compile
varied
and
detailed
file
which
,
of
they
nature
,
be
full
of
personal
information
,
much
of
which
be
very
sensitive
.
when
election
be
hold
,
we
contact
the
people
in
question
and
remind
they
of
all
the
occasion
on
which
we
engage
with
they
in
the
precede
year
.
there
be
nothing
underhand
about
this
.
it
would
be
astonish
if
we
do
not
do
it
,
but
be
it
legal
to
do
so
?
section
55
and
56
of
the
Bill
seem
to
have
be
design
to
override
the
general
provision
of
article
21
of
the
regulation
.
that
article
give
a
individual
the
right
to
object
to
the
processing
of
he
or
she
personal
datum
.
the
two
section
of
the
Bill
state
this
right
do
not
apply
to
direct
mailing
or
datum
processing
carry
out
in
the
course
of
electoral
activity
.
I
be
entirely
unclear
on
whether
this
cover
direct
mailing
during
a
election
from
a
database
compile
outside
election
time
and
which
be
compile
from
constituency
clinic
case
.
there
be
a
need
for
clarity
in
that
regard
because
it
go
to
the
heart
of
what
we
do
.
if
no
clarity
be
provide
,
we
be
in
a
existential
crisis
.
if
,
for
example
,
we
be
oblige
under
the
general
rule
not
to
retain
constituent
datum
for
long
than
be
necessary
to
deal
with
a
clinic
case
,
how
would
we
have
the
wherewithal
to
generate
any
direct
mailing
list
at
election
time
?
I
can
well
appreciate
that
the
law
should
apply
to
we
activity
and
the
information
we
amass
and
keep
,
but
I
cannot
help
wonder
,
have
regard
to
we
own
activity
,
how
well
we
and
,
by
extension
,
the
rest
of
the
country
will
,
in
practice
,
comply
with
the
detail
of
the
rule
we
be
about
to
make
.
I
empathise
with
the
deputy
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(

the

we
have
to
interrogate
that
information
here
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
business
,
Enterprise
and
innovation
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(

)
(

)
and
149(

)
.
that
be
a
steer
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
this
issue
.
as
we
speak
,
I
have
a
Bill
before
the
House
on
the
prohibition
of
microbead
.
it
be
before
the
committee
.
on
28
March
,
we
have
a
positive
engagement
with
expert
from
NUI
Galway
,
Galway
-
Mayo
Institute
of
Technology
and
the
Department
's
official
regard
the
Bill
's
progression
.
I
note
the
word
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
about
the
government
's
intention
to
publish
legislation
on
ban
microplastic
or
microbead
,
but
we
have
yet
to
see
the
colour
of
the
government
's
money
in
that
regard
.
there
be
evidence
that
it
have
be
talk
about
this
matter
since
2016
,
but
we
have
see
no
legislation
as
yet
.
I
be
happy
to
withdraw
my
legislation
.
I
do
not
view
it
as
partisan
in
any
way
.
it
follow
on
from
a
Bill
that
be
introduce
by
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
and
can
be
amend
.
I
openly
acknowledge
that
it
have
flaw
.
its
intention
be
to
ban
microplastic
and
the
scourge
of
microbead
,
which
find
they
way
into
river
course
and
out
into
the
sea
.
there
be
a
evidence
basis
for
that
plastic
be
ingest
by
fish
and
eventually
work
they
way
back
into
the
human
food
chain
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
government
will
publish
its
legislation
.
a
great
deal
of
water
have
go
under
the
bridge
since
that
commitment
be
first
make
in
2016
,
though
,
and
we
be
now
in
2018
.
accord
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
the
government
will
have
legislate
for
this
matter
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
I
take
he
bona
fide
in
good
faith
,
but
the
government
have
say
all
of
this
before
.
it
would
be
easy
for
deputy
to
be
sceptical
about
whether
the
government
will
produce
that
legislation
,
but
we
will
hold
it
to
account
.
when
they
appear
before
we
on
28
March
,
the
official
of
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
Planning
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
,
state
:
in
relation
to
the
Prohibition
of
Micro
Plastics
Bill
2016
,
we
primary
concern
be
that
the
legislation
which
will
be
require
be
technically
more
complex
and
challenging
than
be
draft
in
[
my
]
legislation
.
as
a
example
,
as
well
as
ensure
we
have
robust
and
future
-
proof
definition
of
microbead
and
plastic
,
we
have
to
work
out
how
the
prohibition
can
be
enforce
,
who
will
enforce
it
and
what
staffing
and
financial
resource
will
be
require
to
do
so
.
I
take
this
comment
in
good
faith
,
give
that
there
be
challenge
,
but
they
be
not
insurmountable
.
rather
,
they
be
minor
and
I
be
surprised
that
they
have
not
be
contend
with
to
date
.
the
official
state
further
:
we
be
very
concerned
about
the
confusion
between
microbead
and
microplastic
in
this
propose
legislation
as
microbead
be
only
a
small
subset
of
microplastic
.
as
have
be
highlight
in
previous
Oireachtas
debate
,
a
national
prohibition
of
product
contain
microbead
will
have
implication
for
the
principle
of
free
movement
under
the
provision
of
the
Treaty
on
the
Functioning
of
the
European
Union
.
this
be
another
red
herring
,
a
smokescreen
that
be
be
use
to
delay
matter
.
there
be
precedent
in
the
House
.
when
a
former
minister
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
introduce
the
smoking
ban
,
a
period
of
time
pass
before
effect
be
give
to
the
legislation
and
the
same
claim
,
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
free
market
rule
,
be
use
.
it
do
not
stop
the
ban
come
into
effect
,
though
.
the
same
can
be
do
in
this
instance
.
there
be
precedent
because
other
European
Union
member
state
have
already
instigate
such
a
ban
.
the
time
be
now
.
if
the
government
be
serious
,
let
it
produce
its
legislation
.
nearly
a
month
have
pass
since
the
committee
's
interaction
on
my
Bill
and
people
want
to
see
microplastic
and
microbead
ban
.
in
term
of
capture
the
Zeitgeist
,
people
want
a
environment
that
be
healthy
,
protect
future
generation
against
aquatic
life
ingest
this
dangerous
microplastic
and
ensure
that
we
sea
be
clean
,
which
go
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
.
the
reputable
academic
,
Dr.
Audrey
Morley
,
Dr.
Kevin
Lynch
and
Dr.
Anne
Marie
Mahon
,
who
appear
before
the
committee
on
28
March
give
extraordinary
evidence
.
they
tell
we
about
certain
beach
in
the
west
that
they
survey
,
and
state
:
when
we
be
there
,
the
level
of
pollution
on
the
beach
be
very
obvious
.
as
we
be
walk
we
say
the
sand
look
interesting
.
when
we
bend
down
and
pick
up
some
of
it
,
we
note
it
be
not
actually
sand
but
100
%
microplastic
.
therefore
,
the
sand
on
the
beach
be
compose
entirely
of
microplastic
.
the
student
be
very
interested
in
move
into
this
area
.
we
be
happy
to
supervise
they
project
.
the
rest
of
the
presentation
that
day
be
a
exposition
of
that
work
.
two
issue
arise
.
first
,
sand
be
replace
by
microplastic
be
a
worry
trend
.
second
,
student
have
a
significant
hunger
to
research
this
matter
because
they
want
the
problem
eliminate
.
that
be
a
positive
sign
.
as
policymaker
,
we
need
to
move
into
this
space
more
rapidly
than
we
have
do
heretofore
and
legislate
for
the
banning
of
microbead
.
we
should
not
be
throw
up
smokescreen
about
whether
do
so
would
be
contrary
to
EU
rule
.
other
EU
member
state
be
move
rapidly
in
this
space
.
Ireland
be
a
island
and
a
maritime
nation
.
as
such
,
this
be
a
existential
issue
for
we
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
have
a
great
degree
of
urgency
in
this
regard
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
,
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
,
will
publish
he
legislation
,
but
the
government
should
remember
that
it
do
not
have
a
majority
in
the
House
and
my
Bill
be
still
survive
before
the
committee
.
I
will
keep
my
Bill
on
the
table
and
will
only
withdraw
it
at
such
time
as
I
be
sure
of
the
government
's
commitment
to
legislate
for
what
be
a
very
important
issue
,
give
that
it
speak
to
future
generation
of
Irish
people
.
I
raise
this
issue
along
with
deputy
Rabbitte
on
the
basis
that
we
be
both
concerned
about
it
and
be
both
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
we
be
both
conscious
that
this
story
seem
to
emerge
in
the
public
domain
through
the
Irish
Times
but
,
until
now
,
this
House
have
not
have
a
opportunity
to
discuss
the
issue
.
we
be
conscious
about
give
the
issue
a
airing
.
we
want
to
move
to
a
situation
for
the
approximately
40000
member
of
Scouting
Ireland
,
13000
volunteer
,
35
staff
and
approximately
500
troops
that
exist
throughout
the
island
of
Ireland
,
both
North
and
South
,
where
we
can
clarify
the
funding
position
and
collectively
work
on
the
issue
of
child
protection
.
I
be
not
aware
of
the
content
of
the
Ian
Elliott
report
.
I
understand
that
Scouting
Ireland
bring
in
Ian
Elliott
as
a
person
who
would
go
through
the
child
first
guideline
or
kick
the
tyre
on
that
.
I
understand
that
a
barrister
be
subsequently
appoint
to
go
through
the
recommendation
of
that
report
.
I
be
not
sure
if
the
minister
have
sight
of
the
Ian
Elliott
report
.
I
do
not
have
sight
of
the
report
but
,
in
some
respects
,
this
be
a
little
reminiscent
of
when
I
find
myself
in
this
House
in
2007
advocate
for
the
publication
of
the
Cloyne
report
,
which
be
the
subject
of
Ian
Elliott
's
reporting
of
issue
relate
to
the
diocese
of
Cloyne
.
I
hope
that
we
be
nowhere
near
that
kind
of
scenario
and
I
suspect
that
we
be
not
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
confidence
in
the
work
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
we
all
know
there
be
people
in
we
community
throughout
this
island
who
give
they
time
voluntarily
to
ensure
that
all
child
protection
procedure
be
adhere
to
.
they
do
so
on
a
voluntary
basis
and
want
to
ensure
the
sustainability
of
the
entity
that
be
scout
Ireland
because
it
be
a
invaluable
entity
to
we
life
and
it
enhance
the
life
of
community
throughout
the
island
.
I
accept
the
minister
's
answer
to
the
House
and
support
she
in
she
endeavour
.
although
no
member
want
funding
to
be
unnecessarily
withdraw
,
if
there
be
question
mark
over
governance
standard
,
the
taxpayer
investment
in
the
organisation
should
be
withheld
until
that
governance
issue
be
deal
with
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
keep
in
mind
the
volunteer
at
a
local
level
because
they
be
without
sin
in
all
of
this
.
they
be
go
about
they
daily
and
weekly
activity
and
be
vital
to
we
community
.
I
hope
the
minister
can
engage
proactively
as
quickly
as
possible
to
achieve
a
desire
outcome
for
all
interested
party
such
that
funding
can
be
restore
.
I
appreciate
why
Scouting
Ireland
might
say
it
be
fund
up
to
the
end
of
June
but
it
may
not
be
that
simple
when
day
-
to
-
day
running
cost
be
take
into
account
,
so
I
ask
the
minister
to
give
we
some
assurance
that
funding
can
be
restore
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70

the

I
want
to
ask
the
minister
what
be
the
nature
of
she
discussion
with
Scouting
Ireland
last
week
.
we
in
this
house
demand
transparency
.
I
believe
the
minister
to
be
transparent
in
she
dealing
with
all
matter
under
the
remit
of
she
Department
.
for
we
own
part
,
we
have
yet
to
ascertain
what
be
in
the
detail
of
the
Elliott
report
.
I
be
very
anxious
to
hear
from
Mr.
Ian
Elliott
as
somebody
who
everybody
across
the
divide
would
respect
in
term
of
previous
work
he
have
do
.
I
want
to
hear
the
minister
's
perspective
on
the
nature
and
content
of
the
meeting
that
take
place
last
week
.
do
I
take
it
then
that
the
minister
have
full
confidence
in
the
process
that
be
under
way
within
Scouting
Ireland
in
regard
to
its
governance
and
historical
case
?
furthermore
,
will
the
minister
confirm
,
as
per
she
assertion
when
myself
and
deputy
Rabbitte
raise
this
in
the
House
the
week
before
last
,
that
there
be
no
further
case
be
deal
with
in
a
historical
context
?
my
understanding
be
that
the
minister
inform
this
House
that
she
have
receive
call
to
she
office
about
the
potential
for
further
case
.
be
that
still
the
case
?
be
there
only
one
sample
case
at
play
here
or
be
there
other
complaint
?
be
the
minister
willing
to
again
acknowledge
the
vital
role
thousand
of
volunteer
play
throughout
the
island
of
Ireland
in
everyday
scouting
activity
,
that
they
be
utterly
sacrosanct
in
term
of
maintain
child
protection
policy
and
procedure
and
that
there
be
no
blemish
whatsoever
on
ordinary
member
of
the
scout
throughout
this
island
and
that
it
be
important
that
we
reiterate
that
in
this
house
?
the
minister
will
forgive
I
but
I
must
have
miss
something
in
the
dispatch
.
it
be
news
to
I
that
Jillian
van
Turnhout
be
appoint
by
the
minister
.
I
must
have
miss
the
press
release
on
that
one
.
as
a
former
senator
,
I
think
we
all
have
confidence
in
the
fact
that
she
have
be
appoint
to
that
role
.
do
the
minister
envisage
that
the
Elliot
report
will
be
publish
?
when
will
the
minister
restore
funding
?
it
be
vital
,
notwithstand
the
process
that
be
under
way
,
to
restore
funding
and
have
a
direction
of
travel
to
restore
that
funding
.
it
be
a
entity
that
represent
thousand
of
volunteer
.
I
be
still
unclear
in
my
own
mind
-
that
be
why
I
cannot
wait
to
have
a
interrogation
of
scout
Ireland
's
internal
procedure
-
as
to
how
the
funding
flow
down
into
individual
troops
.
there
seem
to
be
a
disparity
between
what
happen
at
the
head
of
the
organisation
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
organisation
.
there
seem
to
be
a
gap
between
ordinary
member
and
that
within
the
upper
echelon
of
the
organisation
.
I
welcome
the
appointment
of
Jillian
van
Turnhout
but
merely
want
to
ask
the
minister
that
question
.
it
be
tack
on
.
with
all
due
respect
,
the
minister
tack
it
on
in
the
second
or
third
reply
to
a
question
.
fair
enough
.
first
,
I
offer
a
sincere
thanks
to
that
who
take
part
in
this
debate
.
I
understand
the
lateness
of
the
debate
and
the
continue
push
back
of
its
time
make
it
difficult
for
some
to
stay
who
want
to
speak
.
I
thank
they
for
the
call
to
my
office
in
support
of
the
Bill
,
but
I
offer
special
thanks
to
that
who
persever
to
speak
and
to
that
who
stay
in
the
Gallery
.
with
this
Bill
,
Ireland
would
have
a
opportunity
for
another
first
,
such
as
the
plastic
bag
levy
and
the
smoking
ban
.
let
we
look
at
the
reality
behind
this
Bill
,
one
of
which
be
the
increase
in
the
number
of
child
sex
tourism
hot
spot
with
easy
access
to
child
.
there
be
the
reality
of
impunity
for
abuser
in
that
country
.
there
be
the
reality
of
the
condition
that
drive
child
into
the
sex
industry
,
some
of
whom
be
sell
by
they
family
.
this
condition
include
extreme
poverty
,
unemployment
,
the
lack
of
access
to
education
and
conflict
situation
.
there
be
also
the
reality
of
the
sexual
exploitation
of
child
.
it
can
be
invisible
and
it
be
certainly
mobile
.
it
be
global
in
both
the
developed
and
develop
world
.
it
be
escalate
because
there
be
a
mark
increase
in
preference
for
child
.
it
be
also
highly
profitable
and
be
facilitate
also
by
easy
and
cheap
access
to
travel
throughout
the
world
.
this
be
a
opportunity
to
set
a
benchmark
to
protect
child
from
serious
harm
.
it
be
about
protect
child
from
a
person
outside
this
state
do
a
act
which
,
if
it
be
commit
here
,
would
constitute
a
sexual
offence
by
one
who
have
be
release
into
the

after
commit

the

be
paedophile

preferential

situational
customer
,
local
prostitute
user
,
tourist
,
travelling
businessman
and
some
woman
,
migrant
foreign
worker
and
the
military
.
it
be
reckone
that
the
issue
in
the
Philippines
begin
with
the
presence
of
the
US
military
way
back
.
it
lead
to
a
increase

the
Bill
be
about

for

,
leave
can

grant

but
alarm
bell
would
ring
if
there
be
a
request
to
go
for
three
week
to
Thailand
or
the

.
I
stress
the
narrow
remit
of
the
Bill
.
we
say
the
rights
of
child
be
a
priority
for
Ireland
.
it
be
certainly
outline
in

foreign
policy
.
it
be
also
part
of
the
Irish
Aid

,
one
World
,
one
Future
.
Ireland
have
provide
funding
for
end
Child
Prostitution
and
Trafficking
International
,
ECPAT
International
.
in
2016
we
give
it
a
grant
for
three
year
for
a
project
in
Thailand
combat
child
sexual
exploitation
.
this
Bill
be
a
chance
to
go
even
further
and
not
just
give
money
.
it
be
a
opportunity
to
do
something
significant
and
radical
and
something
that
will
make
a
difference
in
child
's
life
.
when
it
come
to
the
amendment
,
I
be
strike
by
the
Minister
of
State
's
optimism
that
we
will
be
here
in
12
month
's
time
so
the
work
will
be
do
within
that
timeframe
.
I
think
about
it
and
decide
to
take
all
the
positive
from
he
speech
.
I
decide
that
accept
the
amendment
be
a
good
way
to
progress
the
Bill
.
we
also
have
to
acknowledge
the
backlog
of
work
for
the
justice
committee
.
I
will
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
word
and
I
hope
we
can
work
on
a
short
timeframe
or
at
least
a
commitment
from
Fine
Gael
that
if
it
be
back
in
government
the
Bill
will
not
get
lose
but
will
be
a
priority
to
be
progress
.
we
owe
it
to
that
in
that
country
.
the
poverty
in
that
country
be
related
to
we
developed
world
,
in
particular
to
that
country
that
carve
up
south
-
east
Asia
,
Latin
America
,
South
America
and
Africa
for
they
empire
.
it
be
also
related
to
the
continue
economic
,
financial
and
tax
policy
of
the
developed
world
.
I
be
all
for
work
together
.
I
hear
the
Minister
of
State
speak
about
the
balancing
of
rights
.
as
we
be
debate
this
here
tonight
there
be
child
and
young
people
,
boy
and
girl
,
who
be
be
sexually
exploit
,
sexually
abuse
and
rape
in
poor
country
by
man
and
some
woman
from
we
world
.
it
be
time
to
ensure
the
rights
of
child
to
they
childhood
.
if
European
country
can
prevent
football
hooligan
from
travel
to
match
,
surely
we
can
do
more
to
save
child
from
convict
sex
offender
because
the
life
of
child
be
more
important
.
there
be
a
right
to
travel
but
how
can
we
possibly
agree
with
the
right
to
travel
to
abuse
,
hurt
and
sexually
exploit
child
.
that
be
what
I
have
be
try
to
do
in
this
Bill
.
I
hope
we
can
see
progress
on
it
before
12
month
or
before
the
Dáil
finishes
.
first

I
offer
a
sincere
thanks
to
that
who
take

in
this
debate
.
I
understand
the
lateness
of
the
debate
and
the
continue
push
back
of
its
time
make
it
difficult
for
some
to
stay
who
want
to

.
I
thank
they
for
the
call
to
my

in
support
of
the
Bill
,
but
I
offer
special
thanks
to
that
who
persever
to
speak
and
to
that
who
stay

with
this
Bill

Ireland
would
have
a
opportunity
for
another
first
,
such
as
the
plastic
bag
levy
and
the
smoking

.
let
we
look
at
the

behind
this

,
one
of
which
be
the
increase
in
the

of

there
be
the
reality
of
impunity
for

in
that
country
.
there
be
the
reality
of
the
condition
that
drive
child

the
sex

,
some
of

be
sell

they
family
.
this
condition
include
extreme
poverty
,
unemployment
,
the
lack
of
access
to
education
and
conflict
situation
.
there
be
also
the
reality
of
the
sexual
exploitation
of
child
.
it
can
be
invisible
and
it
be
certainly
mobile
.
it
be
global
in
both
the
developed
and
develop
world
.
it
be
escalate
because
there
be
a
mark
increase
in
preference
for

.
it
be
also
highly
profitable
and
be
facilitate
also
by
easy
and
cheap

the

this
be
a

to
set
a

to
protect

from
serious
harm

.
this
be
a
opportunity
to
set
a
benchmark
to
protect
child
from
serious
harm
.
it
be
about
protect
child
from
a
person
outside
this
state
do
a
act
which
,
if
it
be
commit
here
,
would
constitute

the

about

for

,

but
alarm
bell
would
ring
if
there
be
a
request
to
go
for
three
week
to
Thailand

I
stress
the
narrow
remit
of
the
Bill
.
we
say
the
rights
of
child
be
a
priority
for
Ireland
.
it
be
certainly
outline
in

foreign
policy
.
it
be
also
part

the
Irish

,
one
World
,
one
Future
.
Ireland
have
provide
funding
for
end
Child
Prostitution
and
Trafficking
International
,
ECPAT
International
.
in
2016
we
give
it
a
grant
for
three
year
for
a
project
in
Thailand
combat
child
sexual
exploitation
.
this
Bill
be
a
chance
to
go
even
further
and
not
just
give
money
.
it
be
a
opportunity
to
do
something
significant
and
radical
and
something
that
will
make
a
difference
in
child
's
life
.
when
it
come
to
the
amendment
,
I
be
strike
by
the
Minister
of
State
's
optimism
that
we
will
be
here
in
12
month
's
time
so
the
work
will
be
do
within
that
timeframe
.
I
think
about
it
and
decide
to
take
all
the
positive
from
he
speech
.
I
decide
that
accept
the
amendment
be
a
good
way
to
progress
the
Bill
.
we
also
have
to
acknowledge
the
backlog
of
work
for
the
justice
committee
.
I
will
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
word
and
I
hope
we
can
work
on
a
short
timeframe
or
at
least
a
commitment
from
Fine
Gael
that
if
it
be
back
in
government
the
Bill
will
not
get
lose
but
will
be
a
priority
to
be
progress
.
we
owe
it
to
that
in
that
country
.
the
poverty
in
that
country
be
related
to
we
developed
world
,
in
particular
to
that
country
that
carve
up
south
-
east
Asia
,
Latin
America
,
South
America
and
Africa
for
they
empire
.
it
be
also
related
to
the
continue
economic
,
financial
and
tax
policy
of
the
developed
world
.
I
be
all
for
work
together
.
I
hear
the
Minister
of
State
speak
about
the
balancing
of
rights
.
as
we
be
debate
this
here
tonight
there
be
child

young
people
,
boy
and

,
who
be
be
sexually
exploit
,
sexually
abuse
and
rape
in
poor
country
by
man
and
some
woman
from
we
world
.
it
be
time
to
ensure
the
rights
of
child
to
they
childhood
.
if
European
country
can
prevent
football
hooligan
from
travel
to
match
,
surely
we
can
do
more
to
save
child
from
convict
sex
offender
because
the
life
of
child
be
more
important
.
there
be
a
right
to
travel
but
how
can
we
possibly
agree
with
the
right
to
travel
to
abuse
,
hurt
and
sexually
exploit
child
.
that
be
what
I
have
be
try
to
do
in
this
Bill
.
I
hope
we
can
see
progress
on
it
before
12
month
or
before
the
Dáil
finishes
.

I
offer
a

I
understand
the
lateness
of
the

and
the
continue
push
back
of
its

make
it
difficult
for
some
to
stay
who
want
to

I
thank
they
for

in

,
but
I
offer
special
thanks
to
that
who
persever
to
speak
and
to
that
who
stay

with
this
Bill

Ireland
would
have
a
opportunity
for
another
first

such
as
the

the

let

he
bona
fide
in
regard
to
tackle
the
downside
of
gambling
,
and
the
need
to
regulate
gambling
have
be
well
articulate
.
we
support
the
Bill
.
one
could
say
that
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
the
Bill
be
limited
but
this
be
second
stage
and
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
before
the
Bill
be
finalise
.
I
take
on
board
the
point
make
by
the
Minister
of
State
and
by
the
originator
of
the
Bill
,
Deputy
Jack
Chambers
and
Anne
Rabbitte
,
and
I
acknowledge
they
work
on
this
.
for
example
,
there
be
issue
around
technology
,
in
particular
how
the
Bill
will
legislate
for
the
constant
movement
and
shift
in
technology
.
let
we
suppose
there
be
a
well
-
know
betting
outfit
base
in
Gibraltar
,
or
somewhere
offshore
,
and
it
have
a
presence
onshore
in
Ireland
.
if
one
subscribe
to
its
app
,
there
be
evidence
it
can
provide
differential
odd
between
different
user
.
the
use
of
algorithm
and
technology
mean
there
be
such
fluidity
build
into
the
system
that
it
can
prove
difficult
to
find
some
sort
of
legislative
scrutiny
or
regulatory
scrutiny
that
keep
the
State
ahead
of
the
curve
of
where
movement
and
trend
be
in
regard
to
the
gambling
industry
.
there
be
big
challenge
ahead
for
the
legislation
in
that
regard
,
although
there
be
a
clear
political
willingness
to
seek
to
address
that
.
if
there
be
proper
and
robust
engagement
with
the
stakeholder
,
I
believe
it
can
be
achieve
.
I
have
have
some
meeting
with
the
Gaming
and
Leisure
Association
of
Ireland
-
I
think
we
have
all
be
approach
by
it
to
some
extent
-
and
it
tell
we
it
welcome
the
legislation
.
it
state
that
in
create
a
regulate
industry
and
require
all
operator
to
be
license
,
the
government
could
establish
control
over
who
be
operate
gambling
in
Ireland
.
it
also
state
that
,
pivotally
,
such
a
process
would
ensure
that
only
that
who
have
be
deem
personally
fit
to
operate
and
prove
tax
compliant
would
be
permit
to
engage
in
the
provision
of
gambling
service
,
drive
criminality
and
the
black
market
economy
out
of
the
industry
.
that
be
a
wonderful
aspiration
and
we
would
all
agree
with
it
,
but
there
be
a
massive
challenge
to
that
.
I
mention
I
have
meeting
with
the
Gaming
and
Leisure
Association
of
Ireland
if
only
to
articulate
the
fact
the
gaming
and
leisure
sector
would
seek
to
be
regulate
.
if
I
be
a
cynic
,
I
might
say
the
reality
be
that
member
's
club
be
in
fact
proprietary
club
run
by
owner
as
profitable
commercial
operation
.
we
know
that
concern
be
express
ten
year
ago
in
a
report
to
government
on
casino
that
the
provision
of
casino
-
style
game
in
this
club
should
be
a
matter
of
concern
,
give
the
provision
of
such
game
be
entirely
contrary
to
the
intention
of
the
1956
Act
and
that
there
be
no
regulation
of
they
activity
.
that
be
ten
year
ago
and
we
might
argue
that
there
be
such
a
proliferation
of
they
now
that
there
be
a
broad
acceptance
of
they
and
it
be
a
case
of
just
say
,
"
ah
well
,
let
we
do
we
good
to
regulate
they
"
.
if
the
sector
be
call
for
regulation
,
we
accept
its
bona
fide
in
that
regard
.
the
question
be
how
the
legislation
will
deal
with
the
advance
in
technology
and
whether
it
can
provide
support
for
the
people
who
have
speak
so
passionately
about
this
,
like
Davy
Glennon
,
who
describe
a
win
as
"
only
a
loan
to
give
back
to
the
booky
"
.
there
be
people
stand
up
in
society
who
be
very
brave
and
to
whom
we
have
a
duty
of
care
.
the
challenge
be
whether
we
can
legislate
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
support
people
like
Davy
Glennon
.
I
do
not
want
to
patronise
Mr.
Glennon
as
I
do
not
know
the
man
from
Adam
but
,
give
he
courage
in
come
forward
,
we
need
to
meet
what
he
be
say
with
clear
and
robust
legislation
.
while
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
,
at
least
this
be
a
starting
point
.
I
congratulate
Fianna
Fáil
for
bring
this
forward
and
congratulate
the
government
for
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Bill
.
I
believe
we
will
have
much
discourse
throughout
the
various
stage
of
this
Bill
to
try
to
get
it
right
,
so
we
can
speak
for
the
type
of
people
who
Davy
Glennon
have
speak
for
,
and
for
Davy
Glennon
himself
,
as
one
example
,
and
that
we
endeavour
to
do
we
good
on
this
issue
.
I
never
hit
the
pillar
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
issue
,
in
co-operation
with
my
constituency
colleague
,
deputy
O'Keeffe
.
I
be
the
minister
of
State
who
turn
the
sod
for
the
two
school
in
question
in
2015
.
this
be
multimillion
euro
project
to
deliver
,
in
the
instance
of
St.
Colman
's
community
college
in
Middleton
,
for
1000
student
and
,
in
the
instance
of
Coláiste
a
Chraoibhín
in
Fermoy
,
for
800
student
.
the
parent
,
staff
and
student
,
who
be
the
most
important
people
in
all
this
,
receive
correspondence
last
week
from
Cork
Education
and
Training
Board
to
state
it
have
decide
to
terminate
the
contract
with
Sammon
for
the
building
of
the
extension
.
this
be
a
very
serious
matter
and
it
be
cause
a
great
degree
of
worry
because
the
etb
be
state
it
will
put
in
place
additional
accommodation
for
September
2018
if
necessary
.
we
reason
for
raise
this
issue
here
today
be
to
seek
to
ensure
that
Cork
ETB
can
work
with
the
Department
and
all
the
other
stakeholder
to
ensure
the
tendering
process
that
be
necessary
to
deliver
this
two
vital
project
to
completion
happen
post
-
haste
,
in
other
word
,
that
it
happen
immediately
,
so
we
can
reach
the
milestone
set
down
under
the
previous
school
capital
programme
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
this
be
about
deliver
education
for
hundred
of
student
in
we
local
area
,
and
we
want
to
ensure
they
get
the
good
possible
chance
to
be
able
to
do
this
and
that
it
be
do
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
it
set
out
the
process
around
the
meeting
with
the
contractor
and
the
fact
that
the
contractor
do
not
subsequently
provide
the
plan
as
be
agree
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
transparency
in
this
.
we
now
need
to
talk
about
the
future
and
ensure
the
project
be
complete
so
the
student
can
get
into
the
two
school
.
this
be
the
most
important
thing
.
follow
the
reply
,
I
now
understand
why
the
ETB
suspend
the
contract
.
we
have
it
clearly
from
the
minister
himself
.
the
minister
say
he
be
to
seek
a
critical
path
and
that
a
process
be
under
way
.
the
parent
,
student
,
teacher
and
staff
will
find
some
comfort
in
that
word
.
it
be
for
we
as
the
public
local
representative
and
Oireachtas
member
to
try
to
ensure
that
we
maintain
the
pressure
on
the
process
,
and
if
there
be
a
critical
path
to
deliver
both
project
,
that
it
be
do
in
a
timely
fashion
and
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
soon
be
in
a
position
to
give
we
a
clear
timeframe
by
which
this
can
be
deliver
.
I
condemn
utterly
the
killing
yesterday
by
Israeli
force
of
dozen
of
protestor
.
child
have
be
kill
and
thousand
of
people
have
be
injure
by
sniper
fire
and
exposure
to
tear
gas
.
ambulance
and
emergency
medical
personnel
have
come
under
fire
and
medic
have
sustain
injury
.
the
excessive
and
brutal
use
of
force
will
scar
community
for
generation
,
as
we
know
well
from
we
own
history
,
and
it
achieve
nothing
for
the
long
-
term
security
of
the
region
.
the
decision
of
President
Trump
to
move
the
US
embassy
in
Israel
to
Jerusalem
have
provoke
huge
anger
and
we
have
see
the
consequence
of
that
.
the
shocking
assertion
by
President
Trump
that
it
be
"
a
great
day
for
Israel
"
and
similar
remark
by
the
Israeli
Prime
Minister
that
it
be
"
a
glorious
day
"
have
leave
most
right
-
think
people
absolutely
sicken
.
this
reckless
move
have
set
back
the
possibility
of
a
long
-
term
peace
.
we
can
ask
who
benefit
.
it
have
tip
the
balance
of
power
in
the
Middle
East
in
a
way
that
will
lead
to
further
instability
and
violence
.
it
be
incumbent
on
we
in
Ireland
and
on
all
EU
member
state
to
take
concrete
action
now
to
redress
the
imbalance
that
have
occur
.
we
welcome
the
government
's
public
condemnation
of
what
have
happen
but
I
have
see
nothing
however
in
the
minister
's
speech
to
shed
some
light
on
the
Israeli
ambassador
's
response
to
the
minister
's
expression
of
the
"
horror
"
,
to
use
he
own
word
,
which
this
event
have
cause
among
the
Irish
people
and
the
government
.
when
the
minister
summon
the
Israeli
ambassador
he
be
represent
the
Irish
people
and
the
people
would
like
to
know
exactly
what
he
response
be
when
the
minister
express
such
horror
.
the
people
be
absolutely
outrage
by
this
and
we
demand
answer
and
a
global
response
.
every
effort
must
be
make
at
the
Unite
Nation
to
achieve
a
full
investigation
and
ensure
that
responsible
will
be
hold
to
account
.
the
government
should
also
urge
the
high
Representative
for
foreign
affair
and
Security
Policy
,
Ms
Mogherini
,
to
prepare
a
collective
response
condemn
the
killing
on
behalf
of
all
member
of
the
European
Union
.
as
we
have
say
before
,
we
welcome
the
firm
commitment
of
European
leader
to
a
two
-
state
solution
for
Israel
and
Palestine
.
we
also
welcome
the
fact
that
the
EU
position
on
Jerusalem
remain
unchanged
.
the
recent
call
make
by
the
Israeli
Prime
Minister
for
Ireland
to
move
its
embassy
to
Jerusalem
show
utter
contempt
for
international
effort
over
decade
to
broker
a
solution
that
recognise
the
importance
of
Jerusalem
to
both
Israeli
and
Palestinian
.
it
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
to
regard
the
situation
in
Palestine
as
stalemate
or
deadlock
which
we
be
powerless
to
break
.
on
the
contrary
,
the
situation
be
fluid
,
ever
change
and
clearly
worsen
in
recent
day
.
the
vacuum
cause
by
the
absence
of
a
fully
functioning
Palestinian
state
give
great
scope
for
that
who
promote
violence
and
reject
the
idea
of
a
two
-
state
solution
to
the
conflict
.
three
year
ago
the
Dáil
unanimously
vote
to
recognise
the
state
of
Palestine
.
what
be
delay
the
government
in
declare
its
recognition
of
Palestine
as
a
state
?
it
should
now
move
to
deliver
on
that
commitment
.
the
injustice
of
the
current
situation
feed
into
a
grow
radicalisation
of
Palestinian
,
include
among
that
who
be
citizen
of
Israel
.
the
conflict
be
be
reproduce
and
reinforce
through
every
means
,
include
the
education
system
.
violence
be
be
present
to
child
and
young
people
as
the
only
answer
.
such
radicalisation
can
only
lead
to
further
instability
and
violence
.
Recognition
of
the
Palestinian
state
by
the
government
would
provide
global
leadership
at
this
crucial
juncture
and
put
the
focus
,
rightly
,
on
the
governance
of
Palestine
and
its
future
development
.
that
be
why
we
be
call
on
the
government
to
tell
we
when
and
how
it
will
go
about
recognise
the
state
of
Palestine
.
I
beg
the
deputy
's
indulgence
,
but
I
seek
clarity
on
the
procedure
as
some
of
we
be
a
little
confused
.
should
Deputy
speak
to
they
amendment
in
the
group
now
?
may
I
seek
clarification
?
I
be
a
party
to
the
amendment

this
grouping

I

issue
on

and
Committee
Stage
so
will
not

detain
the
House

I
have
make
clear
that
I
favour
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
.
the
advocate
for
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
13
have
argue
that
child
have
a
right
to
a
voice
online
and
to
participation
.
however
,
the
digital
age
of
consent
apply
only
when
the
personal
datum
of
child
be
be
gather
and
process
.
child
under
the
digital
age
of
consent
should
be
provide
with
platform
that
do
not
exploit
they
personal
datum
as
a
condition
of
they
use
,
which
be
particularly
important
for
vulnerable
young
child
who
should
not
have
to
rely
on
parental
consent
.
the
issue
here
be
the
provision
of
safe
space
online
that
protect
child
's
anonymity
and
platform
which
do
not
profile
they
on
the
basis
of
personal
datum
.
rely
on
commercial
platform
such
as
Facebook
,
Instagram
,
Snapchat
and
other
to
provide
such
safe
space
or
attempt
to
use
they
as
such
arguably
put
vulnerable
child
at
risk
.
risk
may
also
arise
from
a
unintentional
breach
of
a
child
's
anonymity
,
he
or
she
target
through
advertising
and
marketing
campaign
base
on
he
or
she
interaction
online
or
potential
exposure
to
individual
online
who
might
not
have
the
child
's
good
interest
at
heart
.
I
be
speak
euphemistically
there
but
people
will
understand
to
what
I
refer
.
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
would
be
in
line
with
that
in
place
in
Germany
,
the
Netherlands
,
France
and
other
country
which
have
good
-
in
-
class
approach
to
protect
child
online
.
the
political
position
in
the
Netherlands
in
adopt
16
as
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
base
on
two
simple
principle
:
that
parent
must
parent
and
that
medical
consent
be
grant
at
the
age
of
16
and
,
that
be
so
,
it
follow
that
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
also
set
at
16
.
many
parent
with
genuine
concern
about
the
age
be
set
at
13
have
contact
I
on
this
issue
.
the
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
have
a
discussion
with
Professor
Barry
O'Sullivan
of
University
College
Cork
and
Dr.
Mary
Aiken
on
this
issue
in
the
context
of
cybersecurity
for
child
and
young
adult
.
Professor
O'Sullivan
state
:
for
clarification
,
the
digital
age
of
consent
be
not
about
when
a
child
can
access
the
Internet
,
it
be
merely
the
age
at
which
a
child
can
consent
to
a
profiling
of
they
personal
datum
and
that
be
it
.
it
be
not
about
access
,
it
be
just
the
age
at
which
a
child
can
say
he
or
she
be
happy
to
be
profile
by
a
social
media
company
or
by
a
game
.
notably
,
Ireland
have
opt
for
13
,
the
low
age
of
digital
consent
allow
under
the
gdpr
.
the
data
Protection
Bill
2018
,
which
enshrine
a
Irish
digital
age
of
consent
of
13
,
be
submit
to
the
Seanad
on
8
February
2018
and
be
currently
under
consideration
.
he
further
state
:
there
be
a
need
to
stop
conflate
a
child
's
right
to
access
information
online
with
the
digital
age
of
consent
which
specifically
relate
to
the
age
at
which
a
child
can
sign
legal
agreement
with
online
service
provider
who
gather
,
profile
,
sell
,
and
commercialise
personal
datum
.
we
both
agree
that
this
conflation
have
mis-stepp
the
entire
debate
on
the
digital
age
of
consent
in
Ireland
because
people
think
it
be
about
access
when
it
be
not
.
one
could
argue
that
the
gdpr
,
which
set
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
but
allow
member
state
to
lower
it
to
13
or
otherwise
,
do
not
take
account
of
the
point
deal
with
by
amendment

and

13
state
:
"
it
shall
be
a
offence
under
this

for
any
company
or
corporate
body

the

as
define
by
section
29
for
the
purpose
of
direct
marketing
,
profiling
or
micro-targeting
,
for
financial
gain
.
"
it
would
be
useful
to
hear
the
minister
's
justification
for
not
have
within
the
legislation
very
clearly
delineat
line
regard
the
exploitation
of

for

,
as
the
amendment
state
.
one
could
argue
the
digital

be
a
moot
point
because
the

be
quite
tune
in
to
the
fact
that
notwithstand
what
we
legislate
for
,
anybody
of
any
age
will
be
able
to
access
information
and
create
false
profile
.
however
,
on
the
balance
of
probability
,
to
set
the
digital
age
of
consent
at
16
,
as
be
the
case
across
Europe
,
would
be
the
good
possible
course
of
action
here
.
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
be
the
good
of
a
bad
set
of
choice
in
term
of
seek
to
provide
some
legal
protection
for
that
under
the
age
of
16
.
the
issue
of
self
-
verification
be
also
deal
with
at
the
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
it
be
tell
that
self

verification
do
not
work
but
that
there
be
potentially
a
role
for
Ireland
to
be
a
leader
in
that
regard
and
that
could
be
do
through
the

Protection
Commissioner
and
so
on
.
we
intend
to
press

this
be
about

provide
maximum

against

of

.
article

of
the
GDPR
deal
with
the
issue
of
consent
to
the
processing
of
personal

in
connection
with
what
we
call
information
society
service
.
that
be
the
headline
language
that
be
use
.
the
article
itself
propose
16
year
as
the
minimum
age
at
which
a
child
may
independently
consent
to
such
processing
.
young
child
's

may

"
only
if
,
and
to
the
extent
,
that
consent
be
give
or
authorise
by
the
holder
of
parental
responsibility
over
the
child
"
.
we
approach
to
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
year
be
to
facilitate
parent
to
give
they
the
opportunity
to
parent
,
not
create
a
situation
where
the
law
give
a
13
year
old
the
right
to
consent
to

and
the
use
of
he
or
she
personal
information
for
all
sort
of
service
,
be
it
exploitative
or
not
.
I
do
not
believe
we
should
legislate
on
the
basis
that
we
know
that
child
will
lie
about
the
age
they
give
in
the
age
verification
process
.
we
have
to
legislate
on
the
basis
of
what
we
believe
to
be
the
correct
course
of
action
.
if
we
be
talk
about
contract
law
,
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
year
would
err
on
the
good
side
in
the
expression
of
clear
judgment
in
ensure
parent
have
the
right
to
parent

that

I

to

6
in
the
name
of
deputy
O’Callaghan
.
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
amendment
but
it
behove
we
to
make
some
political
point
on
the
nature
of
how
this
legislation
be
begin
to
unfold
.
it
be
very
clear
now
that
Sinn
Féin
have
do
a
deal
with
the
government
in
respect
of
sentencing
guideline
.
what
we
would
like
to
know
,
what
the
House
would
like
to
know
and
what
the
people
who
be
look
at
this
legislation
would
like
to
know
,
be
what
the
nature
of
that
deal
be
and
whether
it
will
be
publish
in
some
transparent
way
in
order
we
can
all
have
sight
of
what
happen
-----
-----in
respect
of
the
position
that
Sinn
Féin
have
adopt
on
this
matter
.
it
be
very
rarely
that
I
agree
with
deputy
Wallace
but
he
be
right
when
he
say
this
be
poor
legislation
design
to
keep
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
on
board
.
if
we
really
examine
the
nature
of
the
legislation
,
in
he
assault
on
official
Ireland
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
rail
against
insider
and
cronyism
and
he
have
always
have
two
target
in
mind
,
with
one
be
the
Civil
Service
and
the
second
be
the
Judiciary
.
that
be
what
be
baffle
about
this
cunning
plan
of
he
.
ironically
,
in
order
to
"
reform
the
Judiciary
"
,
the
judge
will
ultimately
be
appoint
on
the
advice
of
senior
civil
servant
and
they
placeman
.
it
be
precisely
what
the
Bill
now
propose
.
there
have
be
much
comment
on
how
the
Bill
will
reduce
political
and
judicial
input
but
there
be
no
attention
at
all
on
who
will
provide
the
substitute
input
.
in
we
rush
to
depoliticise
the
judicial
appointment
process
,
we
be
be
ask
to
put
a
very
significant
part
of
it
into
the
hand
of
the
Public
Appointments
Service
.
what
be
the
Public
Appointments
service
element
?
it
be
a
body
consist
of
five
senior
career
civil
or
public
servant
,
include
two
departmental
assistant
secretary
,
the
former
chair
of
the
Northern
Ireland
Civil
Service
commissioner
and
three
personnel
consultant
.
I
do
not
see
why
the
senior
Civil
Service
should
have
any
role
in
appoint
the
judge
,
even
at
the
remove
of
appoint
that
who
will
recommend
the
appointment
.
let
we
be
realistic
about
this
.
the
State
in
its
various
guis
be
by
far
the
big
consumer
of
judicial
service
and
whereas
politician
come
and
go
,
we
senior
civil
servant
-
the
permanent
administration
-
be
daily
at
the
receive
end
of
adverse
judgement
and
rebuk
in
we
court
.
decision
be
overturn
,
scheme
be
upset
and
spending
plan
be
throw
into
disarray
by
court
decision
.
the
major
difference
on
the
bench
be
not
that
between
judge
appoint
by
different
government
.
we
all
know
that
there
be
no
pattern
at
all
of
Fine
Gael
judge
defend
they
own
team
and
have
a
go
at
Fianna
Fáil
government
or
vice
versa
.
neither
be
the
major
difference
on
the
bench
one
between
that
of
a
liberal
or
a
conservative
disposition
.
the
major
difference
be
between
that
judge
who
be
dispose
to
toe
the
line
and
that
who
do
not
.
it
be
between
that
who
,
from
the
perspective
of
the
executive
branch
of
government
,
know
they
place
and
that
who
do
not
.
the
judge
have
two
basic
task
.
one
be
to
do
justice
in
dispute
between
individual
and
the
other
,
perhaps
more
important
,
be
to
curtail
the
power
of
the
State
and
its
agency
and
to
confine
public
body
to
the
rule
of
law
;
in
short
,
it
be
to
bell
the
cat
.
the
senior
mandarin
who
shape
the
future
of
we
Civil
service
should
not
have
the
same
sort
of
say
in
shape
the
future
of
we
Judiciary
.
the
amendment
that
speak
to
common
sense
and
good
legal
practice
be
the
Fianna
Fáil
amendment
.
it
strike
a
good
balance
between
lay
person
and
pre-exist
member
of
the
Judiciary
.
it
be
a
little
grubby
that
we
be
try
to
make
law
here
on
judicial
appointment
and
it
have
become
the
subject
of
a
political
deal
between
the
Government
and
Sinn
Féin
.
the
Government
and
Sinn
Féin
should
publish
the
content
and
elucidate
on
and
enlighten
we
as
to
what
go
on
between
the
two
party
when
they
arrive
at
this
deal
.
deputy
Barrett
speak
to
the
heart
and
soul
of
Fine
Gael
in
regard
to
this
matter
tonight
.
notwithstanding
the
ideological
difference
between
all
of
we
in
this
House
,
when
somebody
of
deputy
Barrett
's
experience
stand
up
and
question
authoritatively
the
manner
in
which
the
legislation
be
proceed
and
speak
so
passionately
about
the
confidence
in
the
Judiciary
of
the
Irish
people
,
it
have
to
be
take
very
seriously
in
this
House
.
while
we
be
all
distract
by
the
referendum
campaign
take
place
outside
this
wall
,
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
what
this
legislation
ultimately
seek
to
do
.
it
be
seriously
flawed
as
it
be
construct
,
and
that
be
why
we
have
to
employ
common
sense
regard
the
number
of
person
to
be
appoint
to
the
commission
.
common
sense
ordain
that
11
member
be
a
reasonable
number
.
if
there
be
a
practise
barrister
,
a
practise
solicitor
,
a
chairman
elect
by
the
commission
,
and
the
other
constituent
member
propose
by
Fianna
Fáil
,
one
have
a
solution
that
seek
to
mediate
between
opposing
position
.
it
strike
a
balance
in
which
everyone
would
have
confidence
.
when
do
we
arrive
at
a
situation
where
this
house
would
be
hold
hostage
by
the
whim
and
vagary
of
the
personality
of
one
minister
who
be
seek
to
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
the
Judiciary
and
official
Ireland
?
the
net
effect
of
what
be
be
create
be
arguably
that
more
power
be
be
give
to
the
Civil
Service
through
the
Public
Appointments
Service
,
which
leave
we
in
a
very
bad
space
in
respect
of
this
legislation
.
it
set
a
very
bad
precedent
.
I
seek
clarification
.
I
be
open
to
correction
,
but
it
seem
we
have
vote
to
allow
for
the
election
of
13
member
to
this
body
.
however
,
the
arithmetic
do
not
appear
to
follow
.
we
seem
to
have
add
additional
member
and
,
accord
to
the
amendment
,
there
could
be
anything
up
to
17
people
who
could
be
deem
to
be
member
of
the
commission
.
we
have
already
vote
to
allow
for
only
13
member
.
could
we
perhaps
seek
some
clarification
on
the
issue
?
on
the
commission
we
have
the
Chief
Justice
,
the
President
of
the
Court
of
appeal
,
the
President
of
the
high
Court
,
the
chief
commissioner
of
the
Irish
human
Right
and
Equality
Commission
,
a
practise
barrister
,
a
practise
solicitor
-----
-----a
chairperson
and
six
layperson
.
we
seem
to
have
add
the
President
of
the
circuit
Court
,
the
President
of
the
District
Court
and
the
Attorney
General
.
the
minister
's
amendment
to
increase
the
number
of
member
from
13
to
17
have
be
defeat
.
we
be
all
confused
about
the
process
and
need
clarity
from
the
government
on
where
exactly
the
legislation
stand
.
I
appreciate
that
.
if
I
can
intervene
again
,
I
appreciate
the
point
make
by
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
as
legislator
,
we
need
clarity
.
what
amendment
be
deem
to
be
admissible
and
which
be
not
?
we
have
apparently
contradictory
position
.
unless
I
be
mistaken
,
we
seem
to
have
contradict
ourselves
,
which
be
why
I
seek
clarification
.
if
I
be
add
they
correctly
,
17
do
not
go
into
13
.
how
be
it
propose
that
we
discuss
this
issue
?
perhaps
the
minister
,
deputy
Shane
Ross
,
might
enlighten
we
?
I
be
concerned
about
the
point
raise
initially
by
deputy
Ryan
and
reflect
by
several
other
,
that
there
appear
to
be
a
unacceptable
level
of
confusion
about
what
be
happen
.

I
have
to
express
my
absolute
disgust
at
this
decision
because
it
fly
in
the
face
of
the
democratic
will
of
the
people
.
every
public
representative
in
County
Cork
give
evidence
before
the
oral
hearing
.
the
people
of
Cork
overwhelmingly
do
not
want
that
incinerator
to
go
ahead
.
there
be
countless
number
of
deferral
.
it
be
great
that
the
Tánaiste
,
who
be
from
the
area
,
be
here
in
the
Chamber
today
.
will
the
government
give
we
some
commitment
that
this
decision
will
be
fight
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
Cork
?
it
fly
in
the
face
of
the
Cork
Lower
Harbour
philosophy
of
renewable
and
clean
energy
.
we
have
be
work
for
quite
a
number
of
year
to
clean
up
the
industry
in
the
area
.
this
be
a
absolute
kick
in
the
tooth
for
the
people
of
County
Cork
.
be
there
a
copy
of
the
speech
?
I
call
on
the
government
to
adhere
to
and
accept
the
overwhelming
desire
of
this
House
,
and
of
the
family
of
Shane
,
for
a
independent
public
inquiry
into
this
matter
.
until
such
time
as
we
have
a
public
inquiry
,
which
be
a
political
decision
to
make
,
I
do
not
believe
we
can
have
absolute
confidence
that
justice
will
be
serve
in
its
entirety
regard
the
matter
of
the
murder
of
this
young
man
.
this
young
man
,
as
be
say
by
he
Mam
,
study
law
and
live
and
believe
in
the
law
.
the
justice
system
and
the
agency
of
the
State
have
fail
he
utterly
.
that
be
set
out
in
correspondence
to
the
leader
of
my
party
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
.
I
note
there
be
correspondence
between
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
and
the
Taoiseach
date
28
January
of
this
year
whereupon
the
Taoiseach
,
in
he
response
to
deputy
Howlin
,
state
:
I
be
advise
that
GSOC
official
meet
with
the
member
of
the
O'Farrell
family
on
27
September
2017
and
be
give
a
update
on
the
current
position
with
regard
to
the
investigation
of
they
complaint
.
I
be
further
advise
that
GSOC
have
be
review
a
number
of
matter
raise
by
the
family
and
that
they
hope
to
conclude
they
review
and
issue
they
report
on
the
investigation
shortly
.
if
we
fast
-
forward
to
the
minister
's
contribution
today
on
the
GSOC
investigation
,
it
be
important
to
quote
from
he
speech
where
he
state
:
GSOC
be
conscious
that
all
party
,
include
gardaí
under
investigation
,
have
rights
and
be
not
jeopardise
the
ongoing
disciplinary
investigation
by
name
individual
who
have
the
right
to
be
hear
and
offer
a
explanation
for
the
conduct
under
investigation
.
when
the
investigation
be
complete
,
a
report
will
be
forward
to
the
Garda
Commissioner
under
section
97
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
.
it
will
be
open
then
for
the
Garda
Commissioner
to
consider
what
action
,
if
any
,
he
think
appropriate
under
the
Garda
disciplinary
regulation
.
to
return
to
the
Taoiseach
's
response
to
deputy
Howlin
,
and
I
be
sure
the
same
response
be
issue
to
other
member
of
this
House
,
the
minister
in
he
contribution
today
state
:
on
the
question
of
a
statutory
inquiry
into
the
circumstance
of
Shane
O'Farrell
's
tragic
death
,
the
House
will
be
aware
that
the
previous
Taoiseach
and
Tánaiste
,
who
meet
with
the
O'Farrell
family
in
late
2016
have
stress
that
they
will
examine
whether
any
further
action
be
warrant
once
the
GSOC
investigation
be
complete
.
while
the
criminal
investigation
have
now
conclude
,
there
be
still
a
investigation
under
way
that
could
result
in
a
recommendation
for
disciplinary
action
against
one
or
more
gardaí
.
my
core
point
be
that
,
notwithstand
the
outcome
of
any
gsoc
investigation
or
whether
any
disciplinary
action
take
place
,
there
be
still
very
much
a
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
independent
public
inquiry
into
this
matter
.
if
one
refer
to
a
submission
to
a
plenary
session
of
the
British
-
Irish
Parliamentary
Assembly
,
entitle
submission
to
the
assembly
regard
the
circumstance
of
the
death
of
Mr.
Shane
O'Farrell
,
it
well
articulate
the
litany
of
injustice
that
be
do
to
this
young
man
.
the
perpetrator
be
permit
to
be
at
liberty
on
2
August
2011
.
at
that
time
he
be
in
breach
of
bail
.
he
face
yet
more
unrelated
charge
.
the
Garda
fail
to
raise
the
fact
that
the
perpetrator
be
in
breach
of
bail
,
have
suspend
sentence
and
have
be
sentence
to
a
custodial
sentence
which
he
do
not
serve
.
the
submission
claim
that
the
family
be
misl
about
the
fact
of
they
son'
death
.
there
be
claim
that
person
choose
not
to
answer
question
put
to
they
by
judge
,
thereby
mislead
the
court
.
it
go
to
the
heart
of
the
justice
system
.
it
be
about
justice
for
Shane
and
he
family
but
it
be
also
about
the
systemic
failure
that
continue
to
exist
within
the
Irish
system
.
be
it
a
geographical
issue
?
do
it
pertain
to
a
particular
geographical
location
?
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
answer
to
that
question
be
not
necessarily
so
.
I
believe
it
be
systemic
right
across
the
system
.
I
do
not
want
to
give
empty
platitude
to
the
O'Farrell
family
other
than
I
hope
they
will
recognise
the
fact
that
this
parliament
in
the
majority
be
ask
for
a
independent
public
inquiry
and
we
want
justice
to
be
do
for
Shane
O'Farrell
,
a
man
who
be
on
he
bike
.
think
about
it
.
he
be
go
about
he
business
on
he
bike
.
he
be
a
man
who
study
the
law
.
he
be
a
citizen
of
this
country
and
he
deserve
more
than
he
get
.
we
owe
it
to
he
memory
,
to
he
family
,
he
Mam
,
dad
and
sister
,
to
do
justice
and
to
do
right
by
he
.
I
do
not
believe
it
will
tax
the
State
too
much
to
have
this
.
we
need
a
proper
outcome
in
term
of
ensure
that
everything
be
go
through
in
this
instance
.
the
minister
's
state
he
strongly
reiterate
"
the
commitment
previously
give
to
the
O'Farrell
family
that
once
the
GSOC
investigation
be
complete
,
the
question
as
to
whether
there
remain
issue
that
require
further
investigation
will
be
fully
and
transparently
consider
"
.
I
hope
the
government
would
move
now
,
have
hear
the
overwhelming
view
of
the
majority
of
this
House
,
towards
give
some
indication
that
a
public
inquiry
should
be
hold
,
notwithstand
the
outcome
of
any
gsoc
hearing
or
finding
.
it
still
need
to
happen
regardless
of
the
GSOC
report
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
141
.

I
have
no
desire
to
hold
up
the
appointment
of
a
new
member
of
GSOC
.
we
wish
Mr.
Sullivan
well
but
we
have
question
about
the
process
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
Dáil
approve
a
previous
appointment
without
debate
on
the
basis
of
a
widespread
agreement
on
the
appointee
.
we
have
some
concern
about
the
process
employ
here
,
specifically
as
it
relate
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
I
only
learn
this
evening
that
this
go
through
the
Public
Appointments
Service
,
PAS
.
this
be
the
first
time
member
have
have
a
sense
of
the
CV
of
the
propose
appointee
.
one
could
argue
that
we
find
ourselves
in
a
invidious
position
where
we
have
no
view
on
the
appointee
because
we
do
not
have
a
opportunity
to
form
one
until
this
evening
,
when
the
minister
give
we
a
outline
of
the
credential
of
the
person
to
be
appoint
.
what
be
the
point
of
ask
we
to
approve
a
person
to
be
appoint
by
the
President
if
there
have
not
be
any
formal
or
iterative
process
with
regard
to
that
person
's
credential
?
the
process
this
evening
be
effectively
a
set
-
piece
event
,
without
question
and
answer
or
a
chance
to
interrogate
further
the
person
's
credential
.
we
do
not
doubt
the
person
's
bona
fide
and
we
wish
he
well
.
he
go
through
the
PAS
but
we
believe
it
might
have
be
more
appropriate
if
,
for
example
,
the
justice
committee
could
have
have
a
process
for
a
engagement
with
the
minister
on
the
appointment
.
the
legislation
provide
that
GSOC
be
to
consist
of
three
member
,
all
of
whom
be
to
be
appoint
by
the
President
on
the
nomination
of
the
government
and
the
passing
of
resolution
by
Dáil
Éireann
and
Seanad
Éireann
recommend
they
appointment
.
PAS
have
interview
the
person
and
cabinet
have
give
the
formal
nod
.
now
we
find
ourselves
in
the
position
tonight
where
at
the
last
minute
the
Oireachtas
be
expect
to
ratify
this
on
the
basis
of
the
minister
's
say
-
so
.
I
do
not
want
to
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
person
,
who
have
be
through
a
process
,
but
the
government
need
to
change
the
procedure
to
ensure
that
this
House
,
through
one
of
its
committee
-
the
most
appropriate
be
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
-
would
have
a
opportunity
to
have
some
sort
of
interaction
as
oppose
to
go
through
this
set
piece
.
it
should
be
a
iterative
process
involve
some
interrogation
of
the
process
and
of
the
person
's
bona
fide
.
I
find
myself
very
curious
about
the
bona
fide
of
the
person
in
question
.
it
be
genuine
human
curiosity
give
he
background
.
I
have
further
question
which
I
will
not
articulate
tonight
.
I
believe
the
process
need
to
be
more
robust
and
need
to
have
good
regard
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
that
might
involve
a
slight
amendment
to
the
2005
Act
.
in
he
speech
the
minister
make
specific
reference
to
the
Commission
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
.
we
all
look
forward
to
get
that
report
in
September
.
we
all
make
submission
to
the
Commission
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
.
if
we
be
to
look
at
GSOC
specifically
,
we
endorse
last
December
's
publication
in
its
proposal
for
legislative
change
and
we
accept
the
thrust
of
its
2016
report
on
Garda
oversight
and
accountability
.
we
state
that
the
commission
should
have
regard
to
the
legal
advice
to
the
previous
government
that
under
the
constitution
,
policing
belong
inherently
to
the
executive
branch
of
government
.
we
be
tell
that
the
power
of
any
independent
policing
authority
would
have
to
be
delimit
.
with
respect
,
the
argument
that
the
constitution
require
the
government
to
directly
control
policing
need
careful
consideration
.
we
be
hopeful
that
the
report
will
address
that
concern
.
the
constitution
make
no
reference
,
even
in
passing
,
to
policing
.
how
the
system
in
other
state
operate
be
well
articulate
.
even
in
that
state
with
a
common
law
tradition
there
be
a
view
that
policing
could
be
more
devolve
and
under
more
democratic
control
.
I
share
in
the
endorsement
,
if
only
to
go
through
a
formal
process
.
it
be
a
bit
strange
to
be
stand
here
support
the
government
in
ratify
somebody
for
appointment
to
GSOC
on
the
basis
of
a
recommendation
make
by
the
Public
Appointments
Service
when
we
have
only
just
learn
about
the
bona
fide
of
the
person
in
question
.
I
ask
that
we
review
the
process
for
the
future
so
that
Oireachtas
member
can
have
more
of
a
interaction
with
the
government
on
the
basis
of
the
recommendation
make
to
it
.
we
have
discuss
this
matter
at
length
already
.
I
do
not
want
to
repeat
the
point
I
make
the
last
evening
we
discuss
this
issue
except
to
say
I
believe
the
overwhelming
majority
of
member
of
this
House
wish
to
see
a
commission
of
investigation
,
a
public
inquiry
or
some
mechanism
that
will
allow
for
this
matter
to
be
investigate
such
that
the
memory
of
Shane
O'Farrell
can
be
honour
and
that
he
family
can
seek
to
have
justice
do
on
foot
of
the
failure
and
omission
that
be
so
glaringly
obvious
.
this
failure
and
omission
have
be
well
articulate
in
the
GSOC
report
,
notwithstand
the
critique
of
that
report
.
it
state
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
ensure
some
sort
of
public
intervention
that
seek
to
consider
everything
inherent
within
this
case
and
the
litany
of
failure
and
to
learn
from
they
.
the
public
demand
it
.
the
majority
in
this
House
demand
it
.
I
seek
some
assurance
in
the
minister
's
speech
that
the
government
be
move
towards
that
position
.
the
last
night
we
be
here
,
the
minister
state
that
while
the
criminal
investigation
be
now
conclude
,
there
be
still
a
investigation
under
way
that
could
result
in
a
recommendation
for
disciplinary
action
against
one
or
more
gardaí
.
he
state
more
or
less
the
same
thing
tonight
.
I
hope
I
be
not
read
too
much
into
that
.
he
say
:
"
I
assure
the
House
that
if
such
further
action
can
well
be
advance
by
a
commission
of
investigation
,
the
government
will
take
step
to
do
that
.
"
I
hope
there
be
some
advance
in
the
language
the
minister
use
in
seek
to
move
towards
a
position
to
ensure
the
ultimate
price
Shane
O'Farrell
pay
will
not
be
for
nothing
and
that
we
,
the
public
,
will
have
due
process
to
ensure
a
full
public
hearing
to
make
sure
he
family
get
justice
.
I
be
not
the
only
member
of
the
House
in
receipt
of
information
from
Mrs.
O'Farrell
.
she
outline
to
we
in
some
documentation
she
have
furnish
to
we
that
there
be
some
inherent
contradiction
between
correspondence
she
have
receive
from
a
Garda
Síochána
and
other
correspondence
.
for
instance
,
a
letter
date
25
June
2013
,
from
a
individual
I
will
not
name
,
imply
the
judge
cancel
the
application
and
do
not
estreat
the
bail
.
there
appear
to
be
a
prima
facie
contradiction
between
what
be
in
that
correspondence
and
what
be
in
the
GSOC
report
.
I
refer
to
the
judge
order
the
forfeiture
of
€
500
on
the
date
in
question
.
this
be
a
small
but
very
significant
example
.
nobody
here
be
seek
to
take
GSOC
down
.
we
all
want
to
believe
in
the
work
it
do
.
it
be
a
statutory
body
but
it
must
also
be
subject
to
scrutiny
.
some
of
we
be
more
rhetorical
than
other
in
term
of
how
we
proceed
but
we
be
fully
entitle
to
question
report
of
this
nature
if
we
believe
there
be
question
that
need
to
be
answer
.
we
all
fully
believe
at
this
stage
that
there
have
to
be
some
public
hearing
,
mechanism
,
public
inquiry
,
or
commission
of
investigation
.
I
be
hope
the
government
will
move
towards
that
position
but
I
still
do
not
understand
what
test
need
to
be
pass
to
arrive
at
that
.
be
it
necessary
that
the
investigation
that
be
under
way
,
which
may
result
in
disciplinary
action
against
one
or
more
gardaí
,
as
mention
by
the
minister
,
be
expedite
before
there
be
a
public
inquiry
?
I
argue
it
be
absolutely
not
.
there
may
be
wise
head
than
mine
think
about
that
point
,
however
.
it
could
take
a
considerable
time
.
I
do
not
believe
we
have
time
on
we
side
.
one
could
still
move
towards
a
mechanism
for
some
form
of
public
inquiry
.
I
feel
it
be
necessary
.
the
minister
might
wish
to
address
that
point
in
he
reply
.
what
be
the
test
that
will
ultimately
satisfy
the
government
that
a
public
inquiry
be
necessary
?
I
note
the
language
the
minister
use
:
"
I
assure
the
House
that
if
such
further
action
can
well
be
advance
by
a
commission
of
investigation
,
the
government
will
take
step
to
do
that
.
"
I
hope
that
language
become
strong
as
time
pass
.
I
hope
that
in
response
to
this
debate
the
minister
will
outline
to
we
why
such
a
public
inquiry
cannot
take
place
at
this
point
.
why
be
he
say
the
investigation
regard
disciplinary
action
need
to
conclude
?
the
litany
of
failure
be
well
articulate
and
have
be
articulate
by
GSOC
itself
.
the
family
have
be
very
reasonable
in
the
face
of
absolutely
insurmountable
odd
.
I
be
not
sure
that
the
good
of
we
could
cope
with
they
.
the
family
have
do
a
stellar
job
in
maintain
its
dignity
throughout
this
.
I
hope
it
can
get
justice
.
I
ask
the
government
to
listen
to
what
the
majority
of
the
Member
of
this
House
be
say
regard
the
need
for
some
sort
of
public
inquiry
to
do
right
by
the
young
man
in
question
and
to
do
right
by
he
memory
.
as
I
say
the
last
night
,
Shane
O'Farrell
be
on
he
bike
,
the
most
honest
means
of
travel
.
he
be
travel
by
he
own
steam
,
go
about
he
business
.
if
we
be
to
do
right
by
we
citizen
,
we
owe
it
to
Shane
to
do
right
by
he
on
this
matter
.

my
question
relate
to
Scouting
Ireland
.
have
the
minister
be
provide
with
a
update
on
the
work
of
Ms
van
Turnhout
on
she
assessment
of
the
governance
of
Scouting
Ireland
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
understand
that
the
minister
cannot
give
we
a
exact
date
by
which
she
will
receive
the
report
.
I
hope
she
will
keep
the
House
and
individual
Member
who
have
a
particular
interest
inform
on
this
issue
.
moreover
,
I
hope
that
when
the
report
come
before
she
,
she
will
keep
a
open
door
in
communicate
with
we
.
I
fully
accept
the
minister
's
answer
.
have
the
minister
be
make
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
be
many
good
people
within
Scouting
Ireland
who
believe
they
have
not
be
communicate
with
with
regard
to
some
of
the
governance
or
change
management
procedure
under
way
currently
,
especially
in
respect
of
the
propose
new
national
structure
?
I
have
write
to
the
minister
and
ask
if
she
would
communicate
with
Ms
van
Turnhout
with
a
view
to
hear
from
reasonable
and
rational
voice
within
Scouting
Ireland
who
wish
to
make
they
view
know
officially
to
Ms
van
Turnhout
on
some
of
the
concern
they
have
in
respect
of
the
current
process
.
will
the
minister
do
she
good
through
she
good
office
to
facilitate
that
,
please
?
we
be
very
much
aware
that
there
be
a
funding
issue
and
that
there
be
time
constraint
as
well
.
however
,
it
be
vital
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
ordinary
member
of
Scouting
Ireland
,
the
people
who
volunteer
at
weekend
,
have
confidence
in
the
process
that
be
under
way
.
everyone
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
taxpayer
's
money
be
be
use
to
fund
this
organisation
.
everyone
within
the
organisation
bar
none
must
have
absolute
confidence
in
the
process
under
way
at
the
moment
.
it
be
important
because
certain
voice
have
not
be
hear
heretofore
and
they
should
be
hear
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
be
a
fair
-
minded
and
decent
man
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
whether
she
be
satisfied
that
the
school
completion
programme
be
operate
effectively
.
I
be
not
satisfied
with
that
answer
,
to
be
very
honest
about
it
.
there
be
470
-
odd
primary
school
.
there
have
be
cut
in
counselling
service
.
we
have
hear
wonderful
word
like
"
review
"
and
"
reform
"
but
I
have
not
hear
anything
that
I
can
say
be
meaningful
.
the
school
completion
programme
be
not
operate
properly
currently
:
it
be
operate
sub-optimally
.
we
need
to
hear
something
a
little
bit
more
robust
and
definitive
from
the
minister
on
what
she
be
actually
do
.
she
have
have
report
,
proposal
and
analysis
on
hr
and
governance
.
I
and
the
House
want
a
straight
answer
to
this
question
on
what
exactly
it
be
that
the
minister
propose
to
do
.
what
be
the
current
budget
?
be
there
further
cut
propose
to
the
school
completion
programme
?
will
there
be
a
increase
in
the
budget
?
how
be
it
propose
to
recruit
more
staff
for
the
school
completion
programme
?
I
have
not
hear
any
of
that
from
the
minister
in
the
reply
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
the
minister
could
address
some
of
the
issue
be
put
to
he
next
time
he
speak
,
rather
than
just
blame
we
.

.
this
be
a
very
simple
issue
.
I
have
be
in
contact
with
a
member
of
a
Garda
Síochána
who
would
be
very
happy
,
should
the
opportunity
arise
,
to
take
up
a
offer
of
official
accommodation
in
Buttevant
,
County
Cork
.
he
be
a
person
of
impeccable
character
,
as
be
he
family
.
I
have
be
go
around
the
house
on
this
issue
with
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
and
the
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
the
OPW
,
deputy
Kevin
Boxer
Moran
.
I
have
ask
a
number
of
parliamentary
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
ensure
the
house
in
question
would
be
allocate
to
the
individual
garda
.
while
it
require
some
refurbishment
,
it
be
nothing
major
.
the
case
speak
to
the
wide
issue
of
the
significant
number
of
official
Garda
residence
nationally
which
be
empty
at
this
time
.
with
a
little
investment
and
refurbishment
,
it
would
be
possible
to
place
gardaí
and
they
family
in
this
residence
which
would
give
they
a
footprint
and
a
great
presence
in
local
community
which
might
not
otherwise
have
it
.
there
be
more
than
300
such
residence
nationally
,
some
of
which
be
occupy
,
while
other
be
not
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Boxer
Moran
,
the
state
of
play
.
I
get
a
lovely
letter
back
from
he
state
that
while
Buttevant
Garda
station
be
in
the
ownership
of
the
commissioner
of
Public
Works
,
matter
relate
to
Garda
accommodation
do
not
come
under
the
remit
of
he
office
and
be
instead
a
matter
for
a
Garda
Síochána
.
the
application
come
up
the
line
through
the
rank
of
a
Garda
Síochána
and
it
be
send
back
down
the
line
again
because
the
Garda
be
tell
this
be
a
matter
for
the
opw
.
I
be
confused
.
I
would
dearly
love
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
person
who
have
come
to
I
that
they
application
be
be
consider
seriously
because
the
applicant
be
a
member
of
the
Garda
and
this
be
a
official
Garda
residence
,
but
it
seem
that
somewhere
it
be
get
catch
between
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
and
the
OPW
.
it
seem
that
the
commissioner
of
Public
Works
,
quite
simply
,
do
not
want
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
I
be
sure
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
I
here
today
that
it
be
not
necessarily
a
matter
for
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
on
the
basis
that
it
do
not
have
the
resource
to
make
such
refurbishment
of
official
dwelling
,
but
I
would
hope
that
the
government
,
through
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Moran
,
who
in
fairness
be
a
straight
man
and
a
honourable
person
,
he
colleague
in
the
independent
Alliance
and
the
Minister
in
Fine
Gael
,
would
deal
with
the
issue
of
Garda
accommodation
because
it
represent
a
opportunity
to
put
gardaí
and
they
family
into
unoccupied
residence
.
for
the
want
of
a
few
bob
,
and
a
small
few
bob
at
that
,
it
would
represent
good
value
for
money
because
it
would
put
gardaí
back
into
the
community
,
particularly
in
rural
setting
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
acknowledge
there
be
limitation
.
he
be
not
tell
I
what
I
want
to
hear
in
respect
of
the
particular
case
.
it
would
be
useful
for
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
to
know
that
in
he
own
county
of
Kilkenny
there
be
nine
such
premise
.
I
ask
the
question
lately
of
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
I
ask
he
what
number
of
residence
be
under
he
remit
and
how
many
be
available
to
a
Garda
Síochána
for
official
accommodation
.
he
tell
I
,
for
instance
,
that
there
be
nine
in
Kilkenny
,
19
in
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
fair
county
,
and
34
in
my
county
.
I
refer
specifically
to
one
such
station
,
which
be
Buttevant
.
the
fundamental
point
be
that
for
the
sake
of
a
relatively
small
investment
in
term
of
the
State
's
resource
,
a
opportunity
could
be
create
for
member
of
a
Garda
Síochána
to
live
within
they
community
.
even
though
they
may
not
be
station
there
,
there
would
at
least
be
a
presence
.
family
would
be
house
at
the
same
time
.
I
need
clarification
on
the
number
that
have
be
furnish
to
I
.
I
have
ask
the
question
.
I
do
not
always
get
a
straight
answer
when
I
table
a
question
in
this
House
on
matter
relate
to
the
opw
.
the
commissioner
could
be
describe
as
semi-autonomous
.
the
issue
be
that
the
matter
have
go
up
the
line
through
a
Garda
Síochána
and
have
come
back
down
the
line
.
there
be
a
figure
involve
for
refurbishment
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
figure
mention
be
slightly
high
for
what
need
to
be
do
.
I
would
like
the
issue
to
be
sort
because
it
represent
a
opportunity
.
as
few
than
ten
member
have
risen
,
I
declare
the

I
congratulate
the
minister
because
this
be
a
major
legislative
foray
for
she
.
I
congratulate
she
and
she
official
because
they
have
do
a
stellar
job
in
bring
forward
this
legislation
.
to
quote
from
the
minister
's
own
speech
on
this
legislation
,
it
will
replace
"
all
exist

child
care

scheme
with
a
single
,
streamlined
scheme
that
will
provide
the

"
.
now
that
the
legislation
be
do
and
dust
and
on
a
statutory
footing
,
we
look
forward
to
mark
the
minister
,
in
the
most
respectful
way
.
we
hope
that
the
minister
will
be
able
to
deliver
further
within
she
Department
with
regard
to
bring
resource
to
this
sector
at
a
time
when
we
be
be
tell
that
great
funding
be
available
in
the
Exchequer
pot
.
we
hope
that
the
minister
will
be
able
to
fight
she
battle
internally
with
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
to
do
even
more
good
work
in
this
space
.
I
congratulate

I
thank
the
minister
,
Minister
of
State
and
all
the
contributor
for
support
the
motion
and
for
they
genuine
,
heartfelt
support
for
snas
,
who
do
a
tremendous
,
caring
,
dedicated
,
valuable
job
.
as
say
early
,
they
see
it
as
a
career
or
vocation
.
the
majority
I
come
across
in
Tipperary
,
from
Carrick
-
on
-
Suir
up
to
Moneygall
and
across
from
Araglin
to
Ballingarry
,
work
diligently
day
in
,
day
out
.
it
be
more
than
work
;
it
be
a
vocation
.
they
look
after
a
very
special
cohort
of
child
,
who
be
vulnerable
and
who
have
very
sensitive
need
.
it
be
a
pity
it
have
to
end
up
in
a
argument
because
we
be
all
passionate
about
this
.
I
will
not
even
refer
to
what
be
say
in
tweet
and
other
media
.
let
the
people
decide
that
this
be
something
we
must
reflect
on
with
a
view
to
offer
support
and
good
working
condition
.
the
condition
of
service
need
to
be
improve
greatly
.
special
employment
condition
need
to
be
consider
.
what
be
occur
be
totally
unfair
.
we
be
debate
the
employment
legislation
early
and
seek
condition
and
rights
but
the
cohort
I
be
refer
to
,
who
be
do
such
vital
,
valuable
,
dedicated
work
,
have
no
real
secure
tenure
of
employment
.
I
recognise
what
the
minister
say
and
the
effort
he
and
the
Minister
of
State
be
make
.
tosach
None
,
leath
to
hoibre
.
I
acknowledge
that
.
we
be
not
be
negative
.
we
want
to
be
as
positive
as
we
can
this
evening
.
I
welcome
the
report
to
which
both
minister
refer
,
the
NESC
report
.
it
be
very
timely
.
snas
have
be
with
we
for
a
while
.
they
be
seriously
affect
by
the
downturn
in
the
economy
and
the
FEMPI
cut
,
which
people
seem
to
want
to
forget
about
.
many
deputy
on
my
right
remind
we
that
deputy
Micheál
Martin
play
a
role
in
this
.
of
course
,
he
have
.
we
all
do
.
we
want
to
make
the
condition
good
and
look
after
that
affect
,
especially
the
daoine
óga
and
that
with
special
need
.
there
be
a
wonderful
testimony
from
deputy
Michael
Healy
-
Rae
.
he
say
dyslexia
,
dyspraxia
and
many
such
condition
be
not
even
hear
of
20
year
ago
.
they
be
certainly
unheard
of
when
we
be
in
school
.
my
late
brother
be
a
paediatrician
of
some
renown
.
he
do
a
lot
of
work
in
this
area
.
when
he
use
word
associate
with
the
area
,
I
do
not
know
what
he
mean
.
it
be
a
bad
day
on
which
one
do
not
learn
something
.
we
have
come
a
long
way
but
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
the
minister
refer
to
the
fact
that
more
child
be
present
.
they
be
.
there
be
a
early
diagnosis
,
which
be
vital
for
the
child
.
it
be
very
important
to
they
future
.
we
must
try
to
keep
pace
in
meet
the
need
because
there
be
people
present
with
condition
that
do
not
present
before
.
I
listen
carefully
to
deputy
Harty
.
the
snas
be
at
the
front
line
of
the
service
when
parent
present
with
a
child
who
,
for
whatever
reason
,
be
just
not
able
to
engage
practically
and
reasonably
with
they
sibling
and
friend
.
the
parent
be
worried
and
really
upset
.
the
parent
use
always
be
wait
until
July
.
deputy
Barry
refer
to
the
overwhelming
vote
by
the
SNAs
.
there
be
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
.
they
have
to
make
they
stand
.
I
hope
that
,
as
a
result
of
the
vote
and
threat
of
industrial
action
,
the
minister
will
take
action
.
he
be
able
to
find
the
funding
.
thankfully
,
we
be
now
in
a
good
situation
financially
but
,
as
I
say
,
mol
a
óige
agus
tiocfaidh
sí
.
it
be
the
very
start
for
that
concerned
.
it
be
they
early
year
education
.
I
could
not
say
enough
about
the
snas
who
operate
in
the
school
with
which
I
be
familiar
.
I
have
serve
on
board
of
management
of
national
school
and
secondary
school
and
I
serve
on
a
naíonra
.
I
serve
at
all
level
except
third
level
.
I
be
in
the
fourth
level
at
the
moment
,
learn
something
every
day
,
I
hope
.
often
we
might
need
special
assistance
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
or
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
to
keep
we
on
track
and
sometimes
to
protect
we
.
I
listen
very
carefully
to
what
the
minister
say
this
evening
.
I
be
not
sure
it
will
prove
to
be
of
comfort
to
the
parent
in
school
who
be
sick
and
tired
of
hear
how
commit
the
Department
be
to
snas
because
,
nevertheless
,
it
allow
dysfunction
to
continue
year
after
year
.
I
know
the
Department
have
a
job
to
do
but
it
need
to
empathise
and
walk
in
the
shoe
of
the
parent
with
the
child
concerned
.
it
need
to
walk
in
the
shoe
of
the
snas
.
I
meet
SNAs
in
St.
Mary
's
CBS
in
Irishtown
this
year
.
it
have
two
special
unit
.
there
be
champion
there
in
Mr.
Ryan
,
a
former
principal
,
and
the
other
who
set
they
up
.
they
make
a
effort
.
a
whole
-
school
team
make
a
effort
and
the
snas
be
a
vital
cog
in
the
wheel
.
they
do
tremendous
work
and
they
be
dedicated
and
compassionate
.
they
be
attach
to
the
child
when
they
be
in
the
school
.
they
wait
,
ready
,
willing
and
able
,
for
the
new
cohort
each
year
.
the
role
of
snas
be
very
clearly
lay
out
in
the
Department
's
circular
of
2014
.
it
confirm
that
snas
be
that
provide
school
with
additional
support
staff
who
can
assist
child
with
special
educational
need
who
also
have
additional
and
significant
care
need
,
as
everybody
refer
to
tonight
.
that
phrase
"
additional
and
significant
care
need
"
really
go
to
the
heart
of
why
this
motion
and
issue
be
so
important
.
I
thank
my
colleague
in
the
rural
independent
Group
and
we
staff
and
everybody
else
who
assist
we
.
we
know
from
the
NCSE
that
more
than
34600
student
be
currently
be
support
and
that
snas
be
deeply
value
.
we
want
that
to
continue
.
the
minister
mention
the
comprehensive
review
of
the
special
need
assistant
scheme
carry
out
by
the
NCSE
.
that
review
find
a
broad
range
of
support
option
be
require
to
address
student
's
additional
care
and
support
need
in
school
.
the
minister
be
talk
glowingly
about
the
report
but
we
cannot
be
selective
;
we
must
dig
deep
into
the
whole
comprehensive
report
.
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
consider
that
the
broad
range
of
support
option
require
to
address
student
's
additional
care
need
include
timely
access
to
support
from
personnel
with
relevant
qualification
and
a
wide
set
of
skill
set
.
a
example
of
this
be
provide
and
I
want
to
repeat
it
to
highlight
why
change
be
important
.
a
student
may
require
support
because
of
severe
sensory
processing
difficulty
associate
with
a
autism
spectrum
disorder
,
asd
,
diagnosis
.
in
such
case
,
he
or
she
school
may
require
support
from
a
behaviour
practitioner
to
assist
in
address
the
behaviour
difficulty
that
arise
from
the
sensory
processing
difficulty
.
the
school
may
also
require
advice
from
a
occupational
therapist
to
explore
environmental
adaptation
which
could
assist
in
reduce
the
level
of
sensory
difficulty
the
student
experience
in
the
first
place
.
this
intervention
will
help
the
student
build
coping
skill
,
not
just
manage
the
symptom
.
it
be
vital
to
intervene
as
early
as
possible
.
the
example
make
it
clear
what
be
at
stake
.
the
NCSE
,
as
part
of
its
review
,
also
recommend
that
,
in
line
with
international
good
practice
,
student
's
additional
care
need
be
identify
and
meet
through
a
continuum
of
support
framework
which
include
whole
-
school
,
target
-
school
and
intensive
-
school
support
within
a
inclusive
school
context
.
that
be
really
what
parent
want
for
they
child
.
that
be
what
snas
want
to
deliver
day
in
,
day
out
,
every
week
.
it
must
be
a
wrap
-
around
service
which
support
all
the
need
of
the
child
,
deliver
by
hard
-
work
and
commit
snas
with
permanent
job
security
.
it
be
not
a
big
ask
.
it
be
a
vocation
for
the
snas
and
they
want
to
help
.
they
have
upskil
themselves
but
they
need
more
retraining
to
deal
with
the
different
complexity
which
be
throw
up
with
new
diagnosis
regularly
.
they
need
the
good
possible
support
.
above
all
,
they
need
respect
from
they
employer
,
the
Department
,
which
work
through
the
board
of
management
.
membership
of
a
board
of
management
be
a
arduous
task
.
board
of
management
have
to
deal
with
employment
legislation
,
health
and
safety
regulation
agus
gach
rud
eile
.
the
minister
must
support
the
board
of
management
,
the
parent
's
council
,
the
teaching
staff
,
as
well
as
the
ancillary
school
staff
down
to
the
caretaker
.
snas
need
certainty
.
they
do
not
need
to
be
tell
in
May
,
June
or
July
that
they
will
have
a
contract
in
September
.
a
sna
lose
he
or
she
position
can
be
a
emotional
wrench
.
while
they
lack
job
security
,
they
have
passion
,
dedication
,
enthusiasm
and
a
vocational
spirit
as
educator
to
that
young
child
with
special
need
.
they
impart
that
skill
set
to
the
parent
.
Parent
be
happy
to
leave
they
child
in
school
,
know
they
will
be
care
for
and
properly
look
after
.
I
salute
the
SNAs
up
and
down
the
country
.
the
government
must
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
be
and
implement
-
fully
,
not
selectively
-
the
recommendation
of
the
report
.
in
the
first
instance
,
I
note
that
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
Bill
's
passage
to
second
Stage
.
however
,
we
have
some
serious
reservation
about
some
of
the
condition
or
content
of
the
Bill
and
have
several
question
.
I
refer
to
the
issue
of
electronic
tagging
.
while
I
need
some
further
clarification
,
from
my
reading
of
the
legislation
this
be
the
third
attempt
to
legislate
for
electronic
tagging
.
this
legislation
seek
to
do
something
which
be
already
on
the
Statute
book
and
one
wonder
about
the
efficacy
of
such
a
effort
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
administrative
consolidation
of
the
Bail
Act
1997
as
prepare
by
the
Law

legislation

seek
to

for
electronic
tagging

tag
be
already
on
the
Statute
book
but
it
have
not
yet
commence
.
that
be
a
issue
we
should
explore
further
on
committee
stage
.
I
be
happy
to
receive
clarification
if
my
point
be
misdirected
but
I
be
not
entirely
sure
they
be
.
as
such
,
there
be
some
reservation
on
that
score
.
I
receive
a
document
today
from
the
Irish
Penal
Reform
trust
,
IPRT
,
which
tally
with
the
concern
of
the
minister
.
spokesperson
such
as
deputy
Ó
Laoghaire
also
outline
some
of
its
content
or
there
be
a
coincidence
between
the
point
he
make
and
the
content
of
the
IPRT
submission
.
I
will
quote
from
that
document
because
it
sum
it
up
for
I
with
regard
to
section
2
(
a
)
and
fetter
discretion
of
the
Judiciary
.
it
state
:
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
Court
already
have
the
power
to
refuse
a
application
for
bail
under
the
1997
Act
(
as
amend
)
where
they
be
satisfied
that
such
refusal
be
reasonably
necessary
to
prevent
the
commission
of
a
serious
offence
.
in
response
to
concern
over
a
perceive
increase
in
offend
by
people
while
on
bail
,
article
40.4.6
,
the
sixteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
,
be
insert
in
1996
as
a
result
of
a
referendum
.
section
2
(
1
)
of
the
Bail
Act
,
1997
give
effect
to
this
amendment
,
provide
that
:
"
where
a
application
for
bail
be
make
by
a
person
charge
with
a
serious
offence
,
a
court
could
the
minister
repeat
that
?
no
.
if
the
minister
be
listen
to
what
I
say
,
he
would
know
I
indicate
we
would
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
in
order
that
the
question
we
have
on
some
of
the
flaw
we
perceive
in
it
can
be
address
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
make
.
I
think
notwithstand
-----
notwithstanding
the
point
that
I
be
make
about
the
passing
of
legislation
in
this
House
-
the
minister
I
be
sure
will
be
embarrass
by
the
fact
that
he
government
be
stand
over
the
judicial
Appointments
Commission
Bill
2017
,
which
be
a
joke
and
a
legislative
farce
-
I
still
believe
that
because
we
be
in
a
democracy
,
we
in
this
House
have
the
right
to
give
a
hearing
to
deputy
O'Callaghan
and
he
party
in
respect
of
legislation
that
come
before
we
.
we
be
fully
entitle
to
allow
the
Bill
to
proceed
to
another
stage
even
though
we
might
have
reservation
about
it
.
that
be
the
fundamental
point
I
be
make
.
I
refer
again
to
the
submission
of
the
IPRT
.
I
have
make
the
point
on
electronic
tagging
about
which
we
have
question
.
I
support
the
minister
's
point
on
the
Bill
's
constitutionality
.
this
be
support
in
the
submission
by
the
IPRT
.
we
have
to
be
cautious
about
how
we
legislate
for
this
matter
in
this
House
.
I
stand
before
the
Ceann
Comhairle
to
support
the
O'Farrell
family
.
there
be
a
litany
of
abuse
and
failure
of
the
system
in
that
case
,
but
that
should
not
mean
we
should
legislate
in
haste
and
repent
thereafter
if
there
be
a
risk
the
legislation
might
be
overturn
.
that
serve
nobody
and
it
do
not
do
anybody
any
good
in
deal
with
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
have
a
question
about
the
explanatory
memorandum
,
which
I
hope
deputy
Jim
O’Callaghan
can
address
,
and
the
statement
that
13
%
of
all
crime
be
commit
by
people
out
on
bail
.
in
how
many
case
be
bail
oppose
?
if
we
be
go
to
interrogate
the
metric
we
need
to
know
in
how
many
of
the
13
%
of
crime
,
bail
be
oppose
.
I
have
no
qualm
about
support
the
passing
of
this
legislation
to
the
next
stage
,
but
there
be
a
lot
of
work
to
be
do
on
committee
stage
.
there
be
a
issue
as
to
whether
the
Bill
be
constitutional
,
and
on
committee
stage
we
will
soon
find
out
whether
that
be
the
case
.
there
be
more
than
200
private
Member
's
bill
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
we
as
individual
member
have
to
check
the
executive
authority
of
the
House
.
for
too
long
the
executive
rule
the
roost
and
it
be
no
harm
the
balance
have
shif
back
towards
the
ordinary
Member
of
the
House
.

I
be
very
disappointed
with
the
attitude
of
some
.
it
be
need
in
Ballyhooley
.
the
Labour
Party
welcome
the
establishment
of
the
select
committee
.
I
look
forward
to
be
a
member
of
it
.
I
wish
to
address
briefly
the
potential
for
carbon
capture
and
storage
.
I
understand
a
feasibility
study
be
under
way
in
that
regard
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
indicate
where
Ireland
stand
in
regard
to
the
potential
for
carbon
capture
and
storage
.
I
specifically
put
that
on
the
agenda
because
it
should
be
discuss
within
the
remit
of
the
committee
.
I
understand
the
European
Union
be
look
for
large
-
scale
carbon
capture
and
storage
,
CCS
,
project
,
for
which
significant
funding
be
available
.
that
represent
a
potentially
good
opportunity
for
Ireland
and
will
help
to
decarbonise
electricity
generation
on
we
island
.
it
could
act
as
a
potential
for
further
foreign
direct
investment
into
Ireland
on
the
basis
that
many
multinational
company
be
now
consider
opportunity
for
decarbonisation
and
we
have
to
be
practical
and
pragmatic
about
that
opportunity
if
they
come
before
we
.
could
the
minister
,
in
he
response
,
give
we
some
indication
as
to
where
stand
the
feasibility
study
on
carbon
capture
and
storage
?
I
tab
a
specific
parliamentary
question
to
he
on
that
issue
.
I
meet
Ervia
yesterday
,
which
be
very
interested
in
this
space
.
as
we
know
,
Ervia
be
we
own
company
.
it
have
a
big
interest
in
this
area
and
it
be
something
on
which
we
should
engage
with
it
.
I
share
the
sentiment
of
other
speaker
.
we
have
a
massive
opportunity
on
this
island
to
send
a
message
globally
on
meeting
target
and
realise
opportunity
.
we
be
a
small
,
innovative
island
and
the
network
create
as
between
industry
and
academia
in
term
of
scientific
research
and
the
person
to
person
and
business
to
business
network
probably
allow
for
people
to
come
together
more
easily
than
in
other
part
of
the
European
Union
.
that
represent
a
opportunity
for
we
.
I
be
hopeful
we
could
also
have
regard
to
the
work
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
on
the
previous
investment
by
the
taxpayer
in
the
marine
renewable
energy
space
.
when
I
be
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
we
launch
the
Marine
and
renewable
Energy
Ireland
,
MaREI
,
centre
in
Cork
.
there
be
a
significant
investment
by
the
taxpayer
in
the
area
of
marine
renewable
energy
.
we
need
to
kick
the
tyre
,
so
to
speak
,
in
term
of
where
that
entity
currently
stand
.
it
be
one
of
the
few
entity
look
specifically
at
marine
renewable
energy
and
as
a
island
nation
,
and
a
Atlantic
nation
,
we
have
to
start
leverage
more
opportunity
to
make
great
investment
to
ensure
we
energy
mix
move
further
into
the
renewable
space
.
I
believe
the
marine
renewable
sector
represent
a
major
opportunity
in
that
regard
.
I
look
forward
to
work
as
part
of
the
committee
.
I
be
hopeful
it
will
not
be
just
a
talking
shop
.
as
a
parliament
we
have
a
opportunity
through
this
committee
,
work
collaboratively
across
party
,
to
try
to
make
some
serious
change
in
the
direction
this
island
go
in
its
responsibility
regard
climate
change
.
we
be
all
green
now
.
nobody
have
ownership
of
green
issue
.
there
be
existential
issue
face
we
now
,
as
well
as
future
generation
,
and
we
all
need
to
collaborate
politically
in
that
space
for
action
.
I
also
wish
to
speak
in
general
term
to
section
7
and
8
.
I
will
highlight
some
correspondence
that
I
receive
about
they
and
outline
in
particular
concern
among
beekeeper
.
in
one
email
,
the
correspondent
,
a
beekeeper
in
east
Cork
,
tell
I
that
the
person
's
apiary
have
decrease
in
size
from
a
average
of
15
in
the
early
1990
to
,
at
well
,
nine
today
.
honey
bee
be
a
great
indicator
species
of
the
environment
,
as
they
only
forage
within
a
radius
of
1.5
mile
.
the
decrease
can
mostly
be
attribute
to
change
in
farming
practice
such
as
hedge
cutting
and
hedgerow
removal
.
for
that
reason
,
the
correspondent
urge
I
to
vote
against
section
7
and
8
.
this
be
testimony
from
someone
with
a
interest
in
beekeeping
.
another
person
be
concerned
that
the
change
to
the
hedge
cutting
date
would
lead
to
further
decline
in
population
of
the
red
list
yellowhammer
,
the
linnet
and
the
greenfinch
and
reduce
essential
food
supplies
for
pollinator
,
of
which
one
third
be
threaten
with
extinction
.
this
be
just
two
sample
of
a
large
number
of
email
to
I
outline
concern
with
section
7
and
8
.
I
represent
a
urban
-
rural
constituency
.
I
understand
as
well
as
western
and
north
-
western
representative
sensitive
issue
in
urban
and
rural
area
.
I
have
a
understanding
of
rural
issue
because
I
speak
to
people
in
rural
Ireland
every
single
day
of
the
week
.
we
should
not
be
go
down
the
road
of
hedge
cutting
in
the
month
of
August
.
it
be
not
a
question
of
extend
the
period
for
hedge
cutting
but
of
ensure
adequate
resource
in
the
first
instance
so
that
hedge
cutting
can
be
complete
in
100
%
of
case
where
necessary
during
the
apposite
season
.
when
local
authority
issue
hedge
cutting
contract
,
that
contract
do
not
cover
the
entirety
of
the
area
that
need
to
be
cut
back
.
it
be
foolish
of
the
House
to
go
down
this
road
without
a
proper
interrogation
and
examination
of
what
we
be
propose
to
do
.
I
be
not
a
dyed
in
the
wool
,
die
in
a
ditch
environmentalist
,
but
I
hope
I
have
common
sense
.
I
grow
up
spend
large
swathe
of
my
time
in
the
countryside
and
live
in
a
town
where
one
need
only
walk
a
mile
to
be
out
in
the
countryside
.
one
have
a
understanding
of
the
season
and
how
they
work
.
nesting
be
always
vital
and
understand
by
rural
dweller
.
for
every
deputy
who
tell
the
House
that
farmer
be
custodian
and
will
make
the
right
decision
,
many
farmer
in
my
area
have
express
to
I
concern
about
what
be
be
propose
in
this
Bill
.
they
concern
be
echo
in
the
correspondence
we
have
receive
from
the
likes
of
BirdWatch
Ireland
,
with
people
tell
we
that
Ireland
's
legal
protection
for
nature
be
regress
.
I
have
have
my
issue
with
a
Taisce
,
which
be
a
stakeholder
body
,
enter
objection
to
young
people
's
planning
application
in
rural
Ireland
.
I
have
my
issue
with
many
people
who
be
headquarter
,
as
it
be
,
in
Dublin
and
seek
to
profess
widely
of
they
knowledge
of
the
dynamic
of
rural
Ireland
,
but
I
do
not
know
anyone
who
would
disagree
with
the
logic
in
BirdWatch
Ireland
's
fear
about
this
legislation
,
particularly
section
7
and
8
.
I
do
not
know
to
which
vested
interest
this
section
be
pander
,
but
they
be
against
nature
.
if
the
right
resource
and
budget
be
allocate
to
local
authority
during
the
current
window
of
opportunity
for
hedge
cutting
,
every
single
hedgerow
in
the
county
we
represent
could
be
cut
annually
or
biannually
where
necessary
and
the
red
herring
of
protect
the
leanaí
go
to
school
could
not
be
use
.
I
pour
scorn
on
the
notion
of
sell
this
legislation
as
a
two
-
year
pilot
cover
all
26
county
.
I
be
not
the
first
person
to
make
this
point
,
but
when
have
this
country
ever
use
pilot
programme
that
cover
all
county
?
previously
,
there
might
be
one
,
two
,
four
or
six
pilot
programme
in
every
region
.
be
the
minister
and
she
official
serious
about
this
and
ask
we
to
take
it
seriously
?
it
be
a
joke
of
a
provision
.
BirdWatch
Ireland
's
submission
read
:
the
legislation
be
be
sell
as
a
2
-
year
'
Pilot
'
period
which
cover
all
26
county
but
no
methodology
for
such
a
pilot
have
be
provide
,
no
baseline
datum
have
be
gather
.
most
worryingly
,
section
8
of
the
Bill
be
not
subject
to
the
'
Pilot
'
period
,
it
can
continue
indefinitely
.
I
realise
that
I
be
under
time
pressure
.
I
appreciate
that
.
that
be
a
load
of
rubbish
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I
welcome
the
Bill
and
congratulate
deputy
Pringle
for
he
tireless
work
on
this
issue
.
I
also
thank
Trócaire
for
its
advocacy
.
it
be
a
organisation
that
,
since
its
foundation
,
have
be
commit
to
climate
justice
.
I
have
witness
the
work
that
it
do
first
hand
in
country
such
as
Ethiopia
,
where
it
partner
with
people
on
the
ground
to
deliver
the
productive
safety
net
programme
.
it
also
help
to
ensure
sustainable
food
production
.
we
have
to
make
the
link
between
what
we
be
do
with
this
legislation
and
what
happen
in
country
such
as
Ethiopia
and
other
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
.
if
we
be
serious
about
partner
with
people
in
place
such
as
Tigray
in
Ethiopia
,
we
cannot
be
paternalistic
about
it
by
continue
to
produce
fossil
fuel
and
emit
greenhouse
gas
,
both
of
which
be
cause
major
consequence
for
the
very
people
we
be
try
to
help
.
we
have
close
the
loop
on
that
.
we
have
show
real
leadership
and
through
Irish
Aid
we
can
send
a
very
positive
signal
to
the
eight
country
we
be
work
with
,
particularly
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
that
Ireland
be
now
take
the
lead
in
term
of
a
process
of
divestment
of
fossil
fuel
.
this
legislation
also
send
a
very
positive
signal
in
term
of
the
Paris
agreement
.
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
meet
the
target
that
agreement
set
,
as
have
be
say
,
but
today
be
a
positive
step
forward
.
the
third
report
and
recommendation
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
,
which
be
subtitle
,
"
how
the
State
can
make
Ireland
a
leader
in
tackle
climate
change
"
should
be
mention
.
we
will
be
grapple
with
that
issue
soon
.
some
of
the
recommendation
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
,
compose
of
citizen
of
Ireland
,
be
very
radical
and
progressive
.
one
of
the
recommendation
,
endorse
by
100
%
of
the
member
of
the
assembly
,
be
that
the
State
should
take
a
leadership
role
in
address
climate
change
through
mitigation
measure
.
the
report
list
a
number
of
suggest
measure
.
I
look
forward
to
this
house
engage
with
that
report
.
if
we
be
radical
and
progressive
in
term
of
we
approach
to
this
issue
I
believe
we
can
become
global
leader
.
I
again
congratulate
deputy
Pringle
and
Trócaire
.
this
legislation
send
a
very
positive
signal
to
we
partner
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
.
I
will
deal
with
the
last
point
first
.
there
be
not
such
a
set
of
rule
.
insurance
,
be
the
business
it
be
,
have
capital
amount
underwrite
business
and
cash
come
in
to
try
to
ensure
there
be
sufficient
cash
reserve
to
settle
claim
.
as
sure
as
there
be
insurance
company
,
there
will
be
insurance
company
failure
.
I
would
not
say
we
have
be
quarrel
over
how
exactly
to
put
in
place
the
good
structure
but
there
be
a
pretty
substantial
court
procedure
-
involve
the
high
Court
,
Court
of
appeal
and
Supreme
Court
.
until
that
be
conclude
,
it
be
very
difficult
for
the
State
to
intervene
.
in
the
short
period
from
December
2017
until
January
of
this
year
,
we
move
as
quickly
as
we
could
after
the
actuarial
analysis
be
conclude
to
try
to
ensure
that
people
who
adhere
to
the
law
correctly
and
appropriately
and
find
themselves
face
a
potential
claim
through
no
fault
of
they
own
would
be
facilitate
in
the
way
we
have
facilitate
they
,
bring
the
level
up
to
a
level
similar
to
the
one
in
question
,
maybe
involve
the
ICF
.
I
thank
deputy
Michael
McGrath
.
I
be
aware
of
he
determination
to
try
to
bring
this
to
a
conclusion
.
I
appreciate
that
on
all
occasion
he
be
just
pursue
the
matter
on
behalf
of
he
constituent
.
this
apply
to
all
the
Deputy
who
question
I
and
my
predecessor
.
it
be
absolutely
my
intention
to
have
no
amendment
in
the
Seanad
.
with
no
amendment
there
,
we
will
be
able
to
conclude
this
legislation
next
week
,
in
this
term
.
it
will
then
go
to
the
President
for
he
signature
.
the
matter
will
be
finish
and
then
it
will
be
a
matter
of
the
administrative
process
for
the
next
tranche
,
which
will
be
three
month
from
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
.
the
Central
Bank
(
National
Claim
Information
Database
)
Bill
2018
be
publish
today
.
this
be
a
important
Bill
because
,
when
enact
,
it
will
enable
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
to
publish
a
range
of
information
on
a
annual
basis
to
increase
transparency
on
the
relationship
between
insurance
premium
and
related
cost
,
identify
current
and
emergency
trend
within
the
market
,
identify
the
factor
that
drive
movement
in
the
price
of
insurance
in
the
State
,
and
provide
information
on
the
number
of
claim
,
as
well
as
provide
statistical
analysis
of
the
cost
associate
with
settle
that
claim
and
,
importantly
,
understand
the
settlement
channel
use
by
the
insurance
company
.
it
be
essential
that
we
get
the
Bill
through
both
house
in
the
next
term
so
it
can
be
operational
in
2019
.
the
Central
Bank
be
currently
try
to
establish
how
we
will
deal
with
the
national
claim
information
database
for
motor
insurance
first
.
we
feel
it
be
appropriate
to
establish
it
in
the
motor
sector
first
,
and
then
we
will
move
to
the
employer
liability
and
public
liability
sector
.
I
think
we
be
all
Republican
here
.
the
sentence
in
paragraph
(
i
)
of
article
40.6.1o
currently
read
,
"
the
publication
or
utterance
of
blasphemous
,
seditious
,
or
indecent
matter
be
a
offence
which
shall
be
punishable
in
accordance
with
law
.
"
as
I
understand
it
,
as
amend
,
the
sentence
will
read
,
"
the
publication
or
utterance
of
seditious
or
indecent
matter
be
a
offence
which
shall
be
punishable
in
accordance

law
.
"
I
want
to
refer
to
the
Corway
v.
independent
Newspaper
(
Ireland
)
Ltd.
,
case
of
1999
.
in
that
case
the
Supreme
Court
point
out
the
difficulty
in
prosecute
the
offence
of
blasphemy
.
the
case
arise
out
of
a
attempt
by
Mr.
Corway
to
bring
a
private
prosecution
against
the
newspaper
for
publish
what
he
claim
be
a
blasphemous
cartoon
.
the
difficulty
for
the
court
be
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
any
legislation
provide
a
definition
set
out
the
ingredient
of
the
offence
of
blasphemy
.
at
common
law
,
blasphemy
consist
only
of
attack
on
the
doctrine
of
the
establish
church
,
Anglicanism
,
by
way
of
vilification
,
ridicule
or
irreverence
.
the
minister
have
allude
to
this
previously
.
Mr.
Justice
Barrington
give
the
lead
judgment
and
state
:
in
this
state
of
the
law
,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
definition
of
the
constitutional
offence
of
blasphemy
,
it
be
impossible
to
say
of
what
the
offence
of
blasphemy
consist
...
the
task
of
define
the
crime
be
one
for
the
legislature
,
not
for
the
court
.
the
question
for
the
government
be
whether
we
could
not
make
exactly
the
same
criticism
about
at
least
one
of
the
two
offence
the
government
be
propose
to
leave
in
the
constitution
.
be
the
minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
satisfied
that
he
could
provide
a
clear
and
comprehensive
definition
of
the
offence
of
indecent
publication
?
none
of
the
rest
of
we
could
.
be
the
Internet
,
for
instance
,
cover
by
the
constitution
?
although
we
still
have
law
that
prohibit
indecency
-
obscenity
in
various
circumstance
,
there
be
no
constitutional
or
statutory
definition
of
either
indecency
or
obscenity
.
however
,
this
be
precisely
the
problem
the
Supreme
Court
identify
in
regard
to
blasphemy
.
as
Mr.
Justice
Barrington
state
:
''
the
task
of
define
the
crime
be
one
for
the
legislature
,
not
for
the
court
.
"
therefore
,
what
be
the
thinking
behind
the
decision
to
keep
some
offence
in
article
40o
while
delete
this
one
,
give
that
all
three
give
rise
to
the
same
difficulty
?
I
be
amazed
that
the
number
of
post
office
to
be
close
in
my
county
be
12
.
where
capacity
have
reach
a
low
ebb
in
the
context
of
activity
level
in
some
of
this
post
office
,
I
can
understand
a
postmaster
or
postmistress
make
a
decision
to
exit
the
market
.
that
be
understandable
and
the
reason
be
very
personal
.
the
Kerr
report
be
publish
in
2016
.
the
minister
tell
we
that
in
2018
a
Post
have
implement
just
over
17
of
the
19
recommendation
make
.
I
put
it
to
he
and
a
Post
that
many
of
the
post
office
affect
in
County
Cork
be
never
contact
or
have
no
engagement
on
the
recommendation
make
in
the
Kerr
report
.
they
capacity
be
reduce
to
such
a
extent
that
they
decide
to
exit
the
market
.
there
be
no
meaningful
engagement
on
the
Kerr
report
in
regard
to
e-payment
,
motor
tax
or
community
hub
pilot
in
respect
of
many
of
the
post
office
in
Cork
,
such
as
at
Minane
Bridge
,
Lackaroe
,
Drinagh
,
Carrigadrohid
,
Ballynoe
,
Ballyclough
,
Ballineen
and
Allihy
.
it
may
not
seem
a
long
distance
but
for
the
people
of
Allihy
to
drive
to
Eyeries
be
a
distance
of
approximately
11
kilometer
and
from
Lackaroe
to
Youghal
be
5
kilometer
.
while
this
do
not
seem
a
long
distance
,
it
be
the
loss
of
a
essential
service
.
the
minister
will
not
convince
I
that
that
make
the
Kerr
recommendation
,
of
which
the
minister
say
a
Post
have
accept
17
of
the
19
,
visit
this
post
office
in
any
way
,
shape
or
form
in
order
to
allow
this
community
at
least
a
fighting
chance
if
they
decide
they
want
to
retain
the
service
in
they
area
.
we
need
a
further
analysis
of
some
of
the
postulation
of
the
minister
in
term
of
he
speech
to
the
House
.
when
we
stand
here
in
2017
to
reluctantly
agree
to
facilitate
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
stamp
to
€
1
,
we
do
so
in
good
faith
on
the
basis
that
the
revenue
generate
would
allow
a
post
a
fighting
chance
.
we
do
not
do
it
on
the
basis
that
159
post
office
would
be
close
as
a
result
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
minister
sell
we
a
pup-----
-----
but
if
the
revenue
increase
as
a
result
of
that
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
stamp
be
use
to
buy
out
contract
or
pay
part
of
a
redundancy
,
then
I
believe
we
should
demand
absolute
transparency
in
regard
to
that
process
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(

European
Union
minister
from
the
27
member
state
,
I
have
to
say
that
if
a
person
have
ever
chair
a
meeting
of
Mallow
Town
Council
then
he
or
she
could
chair
a
meeting
of
any
forum
anywhere
in
the
world
.
I
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
I
start
there
,
as
do
my
late
father
in
1967
.
in
government
,
we
become
part
of
a
collective
agreement
and
I
be
part
of
the
decision
that
collectively
agree
to
abolish
town
council
.
I
be
glad
that
we
as
a
party
have
take
a
decision
to
seek
to
rescind
that
decision
.
it
be
a
grievous
error
and
I
acknowledge
fully
that
I
be
part
of
that
decision
.
I
support
the
legislation
that
we
have
put
forward
so
that
we
can
create
again
the
front
-
line
for
representative
democracy
,
that
be
,
through
we
municipal
or
district
council
.
person
will
argue
that
local
authority
such
as
Cork
County
Council
have
the
municipal
district
.
in
my
experience
,
since
they
creation
,
people
have
be
a
little
remove
from
the
decision
-
make
mechanism
.
the
resource
of
the
local
authority
have
become
more
stretch
in
the
allocation
of
engineer
,
housing
staff
and
outdoor
staff
and
they
be
cover
a
large
geographic
area
.
if
we
decide
to
implement
this
legislation
as
a
legislature
and
reinstate
town
council
,
what
we
will
put
back
into
they
be
the
core
competency
of
staff
who
always
look
after
this
town
.
since
the
abolition
of
town
council
,
I
have
notice
a
diminution
of
service
in
town
.
I
be
sure
many
member
find
themselves
do
council
-
related
work
more
often
.
we
be
all
happy
to
do
that
because
all
politics
be
local
and
we
will
help
everybody
at
every
turn
of
the
road
,
no
matter
how
high
up
the
food
chain
we
go
politically
.
I
believe
though
that
have
a
coterie
of
town
councillor
again
represent
district
and
town
would
be
another
service
.
it
would
mean
a
return
to
basic
and
to
core
principle
in
representative
democracy
and
the
people
would
welcome
that
.
no
matter
what
town
a
person
come
from
,
when
he
or
she
walk
down
the
main
street
as
a
public
representative
-
whether
as
a
councillor
,
a
deputy
or
a
minister
-
there
will
always
be
somebody
on
a
Friday
or
Saturday
afternoon
that
will
ask
why
we
abolish
the
town
council
.
I
be
hard
-
press
to
give
a
answer
.
this
legislation
seek
to
address
that
.
person
like
the
idea
that
they
have
a
local
person
they
could
go
to
who
would
represent
they
interest
and
advocate
for
the
bread
and
butter
issue
that
affect
they
.
I
refer
to
get
the
bread
and
butter
issue
or
the
simple
thing
right
because
sometimes
it
be
the
simple
thing
that
exercise
people
.
the
town
council
give
everybody
access
on
that
bread
and
butter
issue
.
there
be
now
a
sense
of
remoteness
.
citizen
in
town
do
not
feel
that
connectedness
through
the
relationship
in
the
municipal
district
.
that
be
something
that
this
legislation
would
address
.
I
move
amendment
no.

where
it
secondly
occur
.
I
be
one
of
a
number
of
Deputy
who
have
put
this
forward
.
I
make
no
bone
about
say
I
be
from
the
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
Irish
Distiller
have
a
big
operation
there
through
the
Midleton
Distillery
and
big
Irish
brand
be
present
,
include
Jameson
.
I
have
a
little
concern
and
I
hope
the
minister
can
allay
that
issue
with
signage
.
the
whiskey
tourism
offering
be
quite
strong
currently
.
there
be
up
to
130000
visitor
come
to
Midleton
annually
and
they
include
tourist
and
other
responsible
person
who
purchase
product
.
there
be
a
massive
multiplier
effect
for
the
local
economy
as
they
spend
time
in
the
Cork
and
south
-
west
region
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
misinterpret
the
legislation
but
I
worry
that
if
we
be
to
put
in
place
measure
that
would
prevent
signage
to
distillery
such
as
that
in
Midleton
,
it
would
serve
as
a
impediment
to
that
visitor
.
Irish
Distiller
be
a
big
employer
,
employ
600
people
across
four
site
.
as
I
say
,
whiskey
tourism
be
a
grow
offering
as
part
of
the
great
tourism
spend
.
I
add
my
voice
to
the
concern
about
signage
,
particularly
with
respect
to
visitor
centre
,
which
be
a
key
element
of
the
argument
.
while
I
have
the
floor
,
I
should
indicate
that
I
put
down
a
amendment
that
be
withdraw
on
committee
stage
relate
to
cancer
labelling
.
the
amendment
come
about
not
because
I
be
against
labelling
per
se
but
rather
because
I
have
reservation
about
cancer
labelling
on
its
own
.
I
want
to
look
at
the
labelling
issue
in
the
round
because
if
one
think
of
diabete
,
cirrhosis
,
cardiovascular
disease
,
depression
,
seizure
and
gout
,
it
be
obvious
that
abuse
of
alcohol
have
a
impact
in
the
context
of
a
range
of
illness
.
it
be
for
this
reason
that
I
tab
the
amendment
.
I
hope
,
however
,
if
we
be
to
take
a
approach
to
labelling
,
that
we
would
look
at
all
of
the
illness
and
all
of
the
disease
in
the
round
and
that
we
would
not
be
so
prescriptive
in
the
context
of
cancer
.
that
be
merely
my
worry
.
I
be
not
against
labelling
per
se
.
if
the
minister
could
provide
a
answer
in
that
regard
at
some
stage
I
would
be
grateful
.
I
do
not
wish
to
delay
the
passage
of
this
legislation
any
further
.
I
do

I
be
very
happy
with
the
minister
's
explanation
and
justification
.
there
be
a

the
amendment
before

House
.
I
be
happy
to
withdraw

name
from
it

at
least
not
to

the
amendment
.
I
wish
to
clarify
that

be
satisfied

I
thank
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
this
issue
for
come
before
the
House
today
.
I
want
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
defunding
of
the
INFANT
research
centre
,
a
perinatal
healthcare
centre
in
University
College
Cork
.
it
be
a
research
centre
fund
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
lead
by
female
investigator
and
the
only
one
of
its
kind
in
the
State
.
the
centre
deal
specifically
with
ensure
good
health
outcome
for
pregnant
woman
and
they
child
and
baby
,
both
in
utero
and
after
birth
.
a
decision
have
be
make
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
to
defund
the
centre
.
I
will
not
use
any
other
word
to
describe
the
decision
.
no
matter
what
way
it
be
parse
,
it
be
a
decision
to
defund
this
vital
research
centre
.
the
INFANT
centre
subscribe
to
a
external
process
whereby
its
activity
be
review
by
a
international
panel
of
expert
,
chair
by
none
other
than
Professor
Gordon
Smith
,
head
of
the
obstetrics
and
gynaecology
department
at
Cambridge
University
.
in
its
deliberation
while
examine
the
work
and
output
of
INFANT
,
the
panel
clearly
state
that
the
centre
should
continue
to
be
fund
by
SFI
.
under
a
subsequent
decision
,
which
be
now
in
the
public
domain
,
SFI
instigate
its
own
process
.
notwithstanding
the
rigorous
process
the
research
centre
have
undergyne
as
part
of
the
external
review
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
decide
,
base
on
a
second
opaque
and
secretive
process
,
that
the
INFANT
centre
should
be
defund
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
there
be
serious
question
mark
over
the
SFI
process
.
it
have
not
be
transparent
and
neither
I
nor
the
taxpayer
of
this
country
have
sufficient
insight
into
the
process
by
which
this
decision
be
make
.
when
million
of
euro
of
taxpayer
's
money
be
at
stake
,
we
need
to
hear
from
the
Minister
of
State
the
reason
the
second
process
be
design
,
who
be
in
charge
of
it
and
whether
the
director
general
of
SFI
oversee
the
second
oversight
panel
.
it
rankle
I
that
two
eminently
qualified
member
of
the
board
of
governor
of
INFANT
,
Dr.
Ruth
Barrington
and
Professor
Douglas
Kell
,
resign
recently
.
accord
to
a
statement
from
Dr.
Ruth
Barrington
,
a
former
chief
executive
of
the
Health
Research
Board
,
the
SFI
process
be
"
neither
objective
nor
fair
"
.
I
hope
that
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
will
have
clear
oversight
of
the
process
.
I
hope
he
will
give
we
some
hope
that
he
will
pour
light
on
the
approach
take
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
its
director
general
on
this
issue
.
Gabh
mo
leithscéal
,
be
there
a
copy
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
?
no
.
the
key
line
in
the
minister
's
response
be
:
"
in
the
case
of
infant
,
the
independent
international
oversight
panel
recommend
that
it
should
not
receive
immediate
refunding
.
"
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
do
not
wish
to
deliberately
misinform
the
House
.
I
know
note
be
prepare
for
the
minister
and
I
have
be
in
that
position
.
let
we
be
clear
that
there
be
two
process
here
.
one
be
the
international
peer
review
which
be
the
external
process
.
that
be
chair
by
Professor
Gordon
Smith
,
one
of
the
most
pre-eminent
professor
of
obstetrics
and
gynaecology
in
the
world
,
and
he
enthusiastically
recommend
refunding
without
further
review
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
a
international
oversight
panel
.
that
be
SFI
's
international
oversight
panel
,
a
second
and
separate
process
which
be
secretive
and
anonymous
and
with
which
none
of
the
researcher
or
principal
investigator
involve
in
INFANT
have
any
dealing
.
there
be
something
opaque
and
lack
in
transparency
in
this
process
.
it
be
for
the
minister
of
State
to
examine
that
process
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
because
I
fear
that
it
be
deliberately
game
to
take
out
a
research
centre
which
be
one
of
the
small
of
the
seven
to
hand
.
the
centre
be
lead
by
woman
researcher
and
deal
with
woman
and
child
.
the
SFI
try
to
take
out
the
low
hanging
fruit
and
think
it
be
on
the
path
of
least
resistance
.
there
be
a
issue
of
transparency
here
.
Dr.
Ruth
Barrington
and
Professor
Douglas
Kell
stand
down
because
they
question
that
SFI
process
.
I
implore
the
minister
to
look
at
this
.
I
be
be
genuine
in
the
intervention
I
be
make
.
it
be
extremely
disappointing
that
ucc
do
not
appeal
the
decision
or
back
its
own
female
researcher
.
why
be
that
?
there
be
serious
question
in
this
regard
.
consequent
on
the
minister
's
explanation
in
respect
of
signage
on
amendment
no.
17
,
I
wish
to
withdraw
my
name
from
amendment
Nosemcue
19
and
20
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
amendment
.
there
be
many
bar
throughout
the
country
which
sponsor
soccer
team
,
GAA
team
,
all
class
of
sport
organisation
and
the
quid
pro
quo
for
that
sponsorship
be
that
they
particular
hostelry
be
emblazon
on
the
jersey
.
as
a
consequence
of
this
amendment
,
will
that
practice
cease
beyond
31
December
2023
?
that
practice
be
,
by
implication
,
advertising
alcohol
.
if
that
be
the
case
many
small
club
who
rely
on
that
essential
sponsorship
from
small
local
family
own
inter-generational
bar
could
have
a
serious
permutation
in
term
of
try
to
fill
the
gap
on
foot
of
the
lack
of
that
sponsorship
that
would
have
be
readily
available
.
I
seek
clarification
on
that
.
therefore
,
it
will
cease
.
in
essence
,
if
a
local
bar
in
a
local
town
or
village
want
to
sponsor
the
local
GAA
team
beyond
2023
,
the
permutation
of
this
amendment
be
such
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
do
that
anymore
.
I
thank
the
deputy
.
I
thank
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
,
which
do
a
fine
job
in
assist
we
with
interpret
the
Bill
.
broadly
speak
,
the
Bill
be
non-contentious
and
be
aim
at
two
distinct
issue
.
with
regard
to
the
sentencing
of

,
this
provision
originate
in
a

Member
's
Bill
,
sponsor
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Boxer
Moran
,
and
subsequently
adopt
by
the
government
.
essentially
,
the
Bill
propose
a
new
section
58
for
the
criminal
justice
(

offence
)
act
2017
,
to
be
head
commission
of

within
a

period
.
this
propose
new
section
mirror
section
25
of
the
criminal
Justice
Act
2007
,
which
provide
for
a
regime
of
enhance
custodial
sentence
for
offender
who
reoffend
.
the
basic
idea
be
that
where
a
adult
be
convict
on
indictment
of
one
of
the
serious
offence
schedule
to
the
Act
and
be
sentence
to
at

five
year
and
where
he
or
she
be
subsequently
convict
of
another
schedule
offence
within
seven
year
of
the
first
conviction
,
the
court
must
sentence
the
defendant
to
a
minimum
of
three
-
quarter
of
the
maximum
permissible
sentence
for
that
subsequent
offence
.
however
,
there
be
a
important
proviso
.
if
the
court
be
satisfied
that
it
would
be
disproportionate
in
the
circumstance
to
impose
such
a
sentence
,
the
court
may
deviate
from
it
.
this
mirror

25
of

act.

arguably
,
a

beg
the

of

who
be
in

ask

take
cognisance

I
make

yes
,
they
be
.
as
I
have
the
ear
of
the
minister
,
and
thus
a
captive
audience
,
I
plead
with
he
and
,
by
extension
,
the
government
to
look
at
the
cost
of
nicotine
-
replacement
therapy
,
which
be
exorbitant
and
which
prove
to
be
a
disincentive
to
move
from
smoking
to
therapy
such
as
inhaler
,
lozenge
or
gum
.
if
the
cost
be
so
prohibitive
it
act
as
a
disincentive
.
I
understand
it
be
cover
by
the
general
medical
service
scheme
and
,
on
that
basis
,
the
pricing
mechanism
be
arguably
far
too
high
.
there
be
profiteering
go
on
with
the
cost
of
such
therapy
,
and
I
ask
the
minister
to
look
at
this
issue
.
we
be
get
a
tour
of
Louth
.
give
that
I
only
have
a
minute
and
the
fact
that
this
resolution
will
come
into
effect
from
1
January
2019
,
I
ask
the
government
to
look
at
this
again
in
the
Finance
Bill
.
it
be
clear
there
will
be
unintended
consequence
as
a
result
of
the
propose
implementation
of
this
measure
.
we
have
be
contact
throughout
the
evening
by
many
people
from
all
the
sector
that
have
be
discuss
tonight
,
range
from
restaurant
to
barber
shop
to
hairdressing
salon
.
it
be
clear
that
it
will
have
a
massive
effect
whether
one
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
a
large
urban
conurbation
or
a
middle
size
town
.
will
the
government
review
this
or
be
there
any
scope
for
examine
it
again
so
we
can
have
a
wide
debate
?
the
debate
should
not
be
condense
into
mere
minute
as
it
have
be
tonight
.
I
accept
that
you
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
must
organise
the
business
in
this
way
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
inland
revenue
(
include
value
-
add
tax
and
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.

I
join
my
colleague
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
in
make
the
case
for
the
M20
between
Cork
and
Limerick
.
there
be
some
mood
music
in
what
be
say
in
the
expenditure
report
but
there
be
not
actually
a
figure
for
the
proposal
to
bring
it
to
planning
.
it
would
be
very
useful
if
we
have
some
clarity
about
this
.
it
be
not
just
about
Cork
or
Limerick
,
it
be
about
the
south
-
west
and
the
entire
region
of
Munster
in
term
of
balance
regional
economic
growth
.
I
want
to
speak
on
the
issue
of
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
.
I
be
very
confused
about
what
be
announce
in
the
budget
yesterday
.
in
he
speech
,
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
speak
specifically
about
increase
the
threshold
for
eligibility
for
the
childcare
scheme
.
he
speak
about
increase
the
base
income
threshold
from
€
22000
to
approximately
€
26000
and
the
maximum
income
threshold
go
from
€
47500
to
€
60000
.
fast
forward
to
today
,
and
at
the
press
conference
of
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
I
could
glean
very
little
that
suggest
a
affordable
childcare
scheme
be
up
and
run
,
notwithstand
the
announcement
on
increase
in
the
threshold
.
I
take
some
note
,
and
I
hope
I
will
quote
the
minister
,
deputy
Zappone
,
correctly
.
she
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
when
she
be
ask
about
the
qualification
for
the
increase
and
the
it
infrastructure
to
underpin
it
she
state
:
I
would
say
the
qualification
for
the
increase
,
effectively
in
raise
the
threshold
not
only
be
go
to
be
do
that
which
impact
the
increase
,
but
in
order
to
implement
that
change
,
we
will
also
have
the
information
technology
system
in
order
to
implement
the
way
in
which
this
will
be
administer
.
what
the
information
technology
system
will
do
be
,
as
a
parent
,
you
will
be
able
to
sit
at
you
computer
,
you
will
put
in
you
pps
number
and
with
you
consent
,
information
come
from
the
department
of
Revenue
,
and
also
the
department
of
social
protection
will
feed
into
the
calculation
,
along
with
the
age
of
you
child
,
the
amount
of
time
you
want
they
to
go
into
childcare
,
and
out
of
that
to
determine
a
subsidy
per
child
,
per
week
.
to
that
extent
the
qualification
be
set
,
the
net
income
threshold
be
determine
by
the
net
income
take
away
tax
,
prsi
,
USC
,
pension
contribution
.
all
of
that
will
be
very
clearly
lay
out
technically
.
but
part
of
the
objective
calculation
be
to
determine
what
be
the
subsidy
rate
for
you
household
income
and
you
circumstance
in
term
of
child
.
I
be
quote
the
minister
.
this
be
my
note
base
on
what
the
minister
say
,
and
she
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
the
key
issue
be
that
we
have
have
a
announcement
on
a
increase
in
the
threshold
that
give
the
impression
that
a
affordable
childcare
scheme
be
now
up
and
run
but
the
evidence
24
hour
after
the
announcement
seem
to
be
that
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
be
anything
but
up
and
run
and
there
be
still
,
in
spite
of
numerous
announcement
,
a
lack
of
a
it
infrastructure
.
when
parent
who
head
the
announcement
in
the
budget
yesterday
go
to
the
website
of
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
there
be
no
portal
or
it
infrastructure
that
allow
they
to
see
whether
they
fit
the
income
threshold
increase
,
whether
they
be
eligible
for
the
scheme
or
what
they
will
be
able
to
avail
of
in
term
of
a
subsidy
.
this
be
smoke
and
mirror
.
if
I
look
at
the
Department
's
documentation
where
it
state
there
be
change
to
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
,
it
state
this
increase
threshold
will
mean
thousand
more
family
will
benefit
from
the
new
affordable
childcare
scheme
,
once
it
be
launch
at
the
end
of
2019
,
and
they
will
see
they
childcare
cost
tangibly
reduce
.
we
have
now
reach
a
situation
in
the
House
where
announcement
be
make
in
2018
for
budget
2019
that
will
not
come
into
effect
until
the
end
of
2019
.
in
effect
,
the
people
who
be
suppose
to
benefit
from
this
scheme
,
that
on
base
income
up
to
the
new
threshold
of
€
26000
,
and
that
on
up
to
€
60000
,
which
be
the
new
threshold
for
the
maximum
income
,
will
not
see
the
benefit
of
this
until
2020
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
minister
,
deputy
Zappone
,
when
she
have
the
opportunity
to
come
before
the
House
,
whether
it
be
the
case
that
this
new
threshold
will
not
apply
until
2020
.
if
that
be
the
case
we
be
be
sell
a
pup
with
regard
to
create
a
expectation
.
thousand
of
family
will
assume
they
will
benefit
from
increase
subsidy
but
in
reality
they
will
not
see
the
benefit
of
this
for
more
than
12
month
.
if
this
be
the
new
way
of
budget
for
the
year
and
how
the
House
do
its
budget
,
we
be
not
be
fool
.
we
take
great
umbrage
at
the
fact
.
if
the
government
be
try
to
sell
we
some
smoke
and
mirror
at
this
stage
of
the
process
we
will
interrogate
the
figure
to
the
nth
degree
.
this
be
the
political
time
in
which
we
live
.
person
will
not
be
fool
.
person
will
immediately
realise
that
if
the
government
be
serious
about
create
a
affordable
childcare
scheme
the
one
thing
it
would
have
have
up
and
run
at
this
stage
be
a
it
architecture
to
give
a
portal
to
parent
who
be
to
benefit
from
the
scheme
.
that
have
not
even
be
set
up
.
we
need
to
hear
from
the
minister
,
deputy
Zappone
,
just
exactly
what
be
go
on
with
regard
to
the
announcement
make
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
yesterday
and
make
by
she
today
.
on
the
issue
of
climate
change
,
it
be
astounding
that
in
the
week
when
the
Intergovernmental
panel
on
Climate
Change
have
tell
we
there
be
a
narrow
window
of
opportunity
to
keep
global
warming
within
1.5°
Celsius
and
that
to
avail
of
this
opportunity
we
have
to
act
now
,
the
government
do
not
do
anything
in
term
of
a
set
of
measure
that
would
seek
to
decarbonise
further
the
economy
.
in
the
minister
of
Finance
's
speech
,
where
he
refer
to
climate
change
,
what
he
actually
end
up
do
be
state
he
would
invest
more
than
€
164
million
in
target
measure
to
achieve
Ireland
's
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
energy
objective
in
line
with
the
government
's
own
mitigation
plan
.
in
the
same
breath
he
announce
€
103.5
million
for
improvement
in
grant
and
premium
rate
for
planting
forest
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
carbon
sink
through
more
forest
be
the
way
to
go
.
it
be
one
solution
that
we
acknowledge
.
he
would
also
introduce
a
beef
environmental
efficiency
pilot
scheme
to
further
improve
efficiency
in
beef
production
.
I
represent
a
agricultural
heartland
and
I
must
weigh
up
the
local
consideration
we
all
have
in
represent
all
we
constituent
equally
.
the
International
panel
on
Climate
Change
tell
we
there
will
be
a
existential
crisis
for
humanity
if
we
see
increase
of
5°
Celsius
above
pre-industrial
level
by
2100
.
I
will
not
be
too
verbose
about
that
but
the
minister
come
here
only
to
announce
a
scheme
relate
to
good
environmental
efficiency
for
beef
production
,
along
with
a
additional
€
70
million
for
the
target
agricultural
modernisation
scheme
,
TAMS
.
there
be
plenty
of
opportunity
through
divert
money
from
the
so
-
call
rainy
day
fund
to
ensure
we
could
decarbonise
the
economy
in
a
way
that
could
bring
many
choice
,
include
transport
,
household
and
building
.
there
could
have
be
any
number
of
imaginative
scheme
,
and
the
point
be
there
be
a
lack
of
imagination
.
the
government
do
not
use
its
opportunity
with
increase
resource
to
do
that
.
I
could
go
on
but
my
time
have
expire
.

(

that
the
deputy
must
want
to
hoover
up

I
raise
the
issue
of
the
€
75
support
,
which
be
announce
by
the
former
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
on
27
June
2017
,
when
he
state
that
a
annual
support
of
€
75
would
be
introduce
for
person
with
lifelong
or
long
-
term
medical
incontinence
and
that
this
support
would
help
people
to
meet
the
average
annual
cost
of
disposal
of
incontinence
product
.
that
be
the
minister
's
announcement
.
there
be
a
further
significant
speech
on
5
July
2017
when
the
minister
state
,
when
he
be
announce
some
change
to
the
waste
disposal
regime
,
that
the
final
change
be
to
provide
a
government
-
support
€
75
per
year
to
assist
person
with
medical
incontinence
.
this
be
base
on
the
average
cost
of
disposal
of
650
kg
of
incontinence
product
and
be
develop
in
consultation
with
industry
and
patient
stakeholder
group
.
fast
forward
to
September
2018
,
and
there
be
a
number
of
case
,
include
a
specific
case
of
a
young
person
in
my
constituency
who
have
a
long
-
term
need
.
I
seek
clarification
from
the
government
as
to
the
status
of
the
€
75
support
which
be
announce
by
the
government
in
2017
and
further
reinforce
in
2018
.
be
this
€
75
available
?
perhaps
I
have
miss
something
in
despatch
.
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
.
I
need
to
be
able
to
report
back
to
my
constituent
whether
this
be
happen
.
a
sum
of
€75
be
a
significant
amount
of
money
,
especially
when
the
annual
cost
of
waste
for
a
average
household
be
quite
high
.
this
would
give
untold
support
to
such
family
who
be
in
desperate
need
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
response
and
I
appreciate
that
he
be
take
this
on
behalf
of
another
Department
.
it
be
not
he
own
line
Department
.
this
be
announce
in
July
2017
.
we
be
far
along
the
road
now
.
the
GDPR
issue
could
have
be
anticipate
because
that
be
come
down
the
line
from
Europe
.
raise
the
issue
of
datum
protection
be
a
bit
of
a
diversion
at
this
stage
.
I
do
not
think
that
be
a
insurmountable
issue
.
myriad
Department
handle
personal
detail
about
individual
.
one
could
easily
administer
a
scheme
that
would
give
€
75
to
every
family
that
have
a
issue
relate
to
long
-
term
medical
incontinence
.
it
would
have
a
massive
impact
on
that
family
with
regard
to
reduce
they
waste
disposal
cost
.
I
implore
the
government
to
come
back
to
I
at
some
stage
with
a
solution
and
timeline
for
this
.
I
be
not
buy
the
argument
that
datum
protection
be
a
issue
.
it
be
very
easy
to
design
a
scheme
,
give
the
innovative
nature
of
this
country
,
that
would
easily
meet
the
need
of
the
people
that
we
be
all
try
to
represent
here
.
there
be
not
a
member
of
this
House
who
do
not
have
this
issue
and
who
do
not
have
a
family
in
he
or
she
constituency
who
would
benefit
from
this
€
75
support
which
be
announce
in
2017
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
consult
he
colleague
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
we
can
at
least
follow
through
on
something
that
be
announce
and
get
over
this
hurdle
,
such
as
the
datum
protection
hurdle
.
I
do
not
believe
that
be
a
issue
which
cannot
be
deal
with
a
little
bit
of
energy
on
the
part
of
the
government
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
141
of
the
standing
order
relative
to
Public
business
.

Mr.
Justice
Charleton
describe
sit
through
the
hearing
in
Dublin
Castle
as
a
dispiriting
exercise
.
for
that
of
we
who
have
do
so
,
read
he
report
be
equally
dispiriting
.
as
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
write
,
"
every
judge
be
conscious
that
the
task
of
judge
other
be
a
human
function
.
as
such
,
it
be
fallible
.
"
the
judge
will
therefore
understand
that
I
do
not
share
he
every
opinion
as
express
in
this
report
,
particularly
on
matter
of
political
accountability
.
however
,
I
do
believe
that
it
be
a
impressive
exercise
in
arrive
at
the
truth
on
factual
issue
and
in
secure
answer
that
be
previously
hide
from
we
.
I
want
to
concentrate
on
three
aspect
that
most
immediately
concern
we
as
public
representative
.
I
start
with
the
controversy
surround
deputy
Fitzgerald
,
even
though
it
be
far
from
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
affair
,
but
we
need
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
.
as
have
be
point
out
by
other
this
week
,
here
and
in
the
media
,
she
government
colleague
have
attempt
to
use
the
report
in
order
to
exonerate
deputy
Fitzgerald
of
a
charge
of
which
she
be
not
accuse
.
as
a
government
member
and
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Fitzgerald
's
primary
responsibility
be
to
account
fully
and
accurately
to
this
house
for
the
performance
of
she
function
.
the
reason
she
resign
be
not
because
of
anything
that
happen
in
2015
.
I
want
to
be
fair
to
deputy
Fitzgerald
because
we
all
hold
she
in
high
regard
on
a
personal
basis
.
the
reason
she
resign
be
because
of
what
happen
in
2017
.
deputy
Fitzgerald
resign
last
November
because
the
Dáil
be
misl
about
she
knowledge
of
issue
at
the
O'Higgin
commission
that
take
place
in
May
2015
.
I
repeat
that
this
be
a
issue
of
political
,
rather
than
legal
,
accountability
,
well
assess
by
the
Member
of
this
House
.
what
be
now
clear
about
the
issue
at
the
O'Higgin
hearing
in
May
2015
be
that
the
Chief
State
Solicitor
's
team
consider
it
to
be
"
political
dynamite
"
and
Commissioner
O'Sullivan
consider
that
she
be
in
a
"
almost
impossible
dilemma
"
.
the
Department
and
then
the
minister
be
notify
about
what
be
go
on
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Fitzgerald
,
acknowledge
that
she
must
have
read
the
email
send
to
she
about
it
.
she
decide
not
to
intervene
,
and
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
believe
this
be
correct
.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
,
although
,
carefully
,
the
judge
do
not
say
that
a
minister
could
never
intervene
in
such
circumstance
.
he
expressly
leave
it
open
that
a
minister
would
be
fully
justify
in
intervene
if
in
fact
false
allegation
of
sexual
abuse
have
be
deploy
before
Mr.
Justice
O'Higgin
,
in
order
to
unfairly
traduce
Maurice
McCabe
.
in
any
event
,
in
November
2017
my
colleague
,
deputy
Kelly
,
submit
parliamentary
question
about
what
be
know
about
all
of
this
in
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
the
answer
he
receive
be
vague
and
unhelpful
,
but
he
persist
.
he
might
,
truthfully
,
have
be
tell
in
reply
that
the
minister
be
aware
of
the
issue
but
have
decide
on
legal
and
official
advice
not
to
interfere
.
instead
,
officialdom
behave
as
if
it
have
something
to
hide
,
and
as
we
subsequently
find
out
it
do
.
the
Taoiseach
be
brief
by
he
minister
and
tell
the
Dáil
that
the
minister
,
"
find
out
about
it
[
the
legal
strategy
]
after
the
fact
,
but
around
the
time
it
be
in
the
public
domain
when
everybody
else
know
about
it
as
well
"
.
that
simply
be
not
true
and
the
subsequent
trawl
of
email
in
the
Department
show
it
be
not
true
.
then
,
to
top
it
all
,
we
discover
that
the
email
have
not
be
send
to
the
tribunal
,
ten
month
after
it
have
be
appoint
.
the
minister
resign
the
follow
day
.
the
Dáil
have
be
misl
about
the
nature
and
extent
of
she
knowledge
of
a
matter
of
live
public
controversy
.
in
the
atmosphere
of
last
November
,
there
be
no
alternative
to
the
step
she
take
.
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Fitzgerald
,
be
in
charge
of
the
"
dysfunctional
"
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
as
the
Taoiseach
call
it
.
the
Charleton
tribunal
have
ask
everyone
to
provide
full
documentation
to
it
,
but
subsequently
the
Department
have
to
provide
multiple
box
of
newly
discover
information
.
nothing
in
the
report
publish
this
week
point
to
a
vindication
in
relation
to
a
charge
of
fail
to
account
fully
and
accurately
to
the
Dáil
.
we
all
have
a
certain
responsibility
here
.
as
member
of
the
Dáil
,
we
each
have
a
responsibility
in
that
regard
.
another
point
directly
concern
we
as
public
representative
.
member
should
be
slow
to
blow
we
own
trumpet
but
I
do
not
think
there
will
be
a
rush
of
journalistic
commentator
or
other
queue
up
to
make
the
point
clear
.
in
he
report
,
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
reject
the
swear
evidence
of
two
Garda
commissioner
and
other
senior
Garda
officer
.
the
evidence
of
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
be
reject
as
"
improbable
"
.
the
evidence
of
Tusla
staff
be
describe
as
"
wholly
unconvincing
"
.
the
tribunal
list
six
case
where
journalist
flatly
contradict
each
other
in
evidence
,
although
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
have
to
decide
the
truth
in
only
two
of
that
case
.
in
fact
,
there
be
only
one
class
of
witness
whose
evidence
on
all
matter
of
serious
contention
be
accept
by
the
tribunal
.
that
class
consist
of
the
Member
of
the
Dáil
who
give
evidence
.
on
all
the
factual
issue
about
which
they
give
evidence
the
tribunal
accept
what
be
say
.
the
class
include
deputy
Frances
Fitzgerald
but
also
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
John
McGuinness
,
John
Deasy
,
Mick
Wallace
,
Clare
Daly
,
the
former
deputy
,
Pat
Rabbitte
,
and
my
party
leader
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
.
the
report
contain
a
final
chapter
of
recommendation
.
we
need
to
return
to
they
and
consider
they
in
detail
,
perhaps
in
committee
.
the
tribunal
outcome
point
above
all
to
the
importance
of
this
House
and
its
Member
as
a
means
of
secure
accountability
from
government
and
agency
of
the
State
.
it
demonstrate
the
importance
of
persistence
,
refuse
to
accept
the
official
line
,
listen
to
outsider
and
bang
again
and
again
at
the
close
door
until
they
open
up
and
let
in
some
light
.
this
be
a
real
exercise
in
the
separation
of
power
between
Dáil
and
government
.
it
be
a
exercise
in
deputy
use
they
privileged
position
to
ensure
the
issue
would
not
go
away
.
they
keep
advance
it
until
a
formal
inquiry
become
inevitable
and
necessary
.
this
be
how
accountability
in
a
mature
democracy
be
mean
to
work
.
the
tribunal
report
demonstrate
how
much
we
still
have
to
learn
about
accountability
.
let
we
consider
this
passage
,
for
example
,
from
page
112
:
from
2016
,
no
one
within
TUSLA
consider
own
up
to
the
serious
mistake
that
have
be
make
.
the
solicitor
's
letter
of
complaint
on
Maurice
McCabe
's
behalf
,
send
in
response
to
the
letter
from
TUSLA
receive
in
January
2016
,
be
a
invitation
to
give
a
proper
explanation
of
what
have
happen
.
have
that
happen
,
have
TUSLA
senior
management
sit
down
and
read
the
file
and
then
forthrightly
reply
set
out
fully
the
mistake
that
they
have
make
,
this
tribunal
of
inquiry
would
most
probably
have
be
avoid
.
there
be
shade
of
CervicalCheck
here
in
the
sense
of
the
need
for
a
open
disclosure
policy
,
one
of
set
out
fully
and
forthrightly
the
mistake
that
have
be
make
.
one
final
aspect
that
need
highlight
be
the
impact
of
what
we
have
learn
from
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
on
we
response
to
the
recommendation
of
the
O'Toole
Commission
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
.
the
Maurice
McCabe
affair
demonstrate
the
importance
of
external
oversight
by
the
Dáil
of
the
government
and
its
Department
and
agency
.
we
need
to
improve
the
capacity
for
oversight
and
to
make
it
far
more
effective
,
but
the
same
lesson
must
be
learn
with
regard
to
a
Garda
Síochána
.
for
decade
my
party
have
call
for
a
external
Garda
oversight
agency
.
we
be
determined
to
break
the
secretive
and
damaging
relationship
between
the
force
and
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
that
relationship
be
vividly
demonstrate
in
the
report
by
the
flurry
of
telephone
call
at
senior
level
between
the
Phoenix
Park
and
St
Stephen
's
Green
at
time
of
crisis
.
this
be
call
which
no
one
could
late
remember
make
or
receive
.
they
content
be
immediately
forget
once
the
line
go
dead
.
my
party
be
determined
to
secure
effective
Garda
accountability
and
oversight
to
a
independent
external
body
.
we
achieve
most
of
what
we
want
when
the
Policing
Authority
be
finally
establish
.
that
body
,
under
its
chairperson
,
Josephine
Feehily
,
have
live
up
to
most
of
we
expectation
,
although
there
be
improvement
that
can
be
make
to
the
legislation
.
that
be
why
it
be
,
to
use
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
's
term
,
so
dispiriting
to
see
now
a
recommendation
to
disband
the
Policing
Authority
as
a
external
body
secure
oversight
and
to
replace
it
instead
with
a
in
-
house
board
of
management
.
a
in
-
house
board
will
of
necessity
become
ingrain
with
a
in
-
house
policing
mentality
.
if
we
have
learn
anything
from
this
tribunal
,
it
be
that
the
Garda
Síochána
need
far
less
,
not
more
,
of
a
in
-
house
policing
mentality
.
member
of
the
force
need
to
be
require
to
demonstrate
fully
and
in
public
that
they
live
up
to
the
same
basic
standard
of
fairness
,
decency
and
common
sense
that
bind
the
rest
of
we
.
as
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
put
it
on
page
294
:
Central
to
that
issue
be
a
mentality
problem
.
where
a
problem
occur
,
strongly
self
-
identify
organisation
can
have
a
self
-
protective
tendency
.
that
,
regrettably
,
also
describe
a
Garda
Síochána
.
it
be
beyond
a
pity
that
it
take
independent
inquiry
to
identify
obvious
problem
with
what
Maurice
McCabe
be
report
.
why
on
earth
would
we
react
to
this
finding
and
comment
by
shunt
accountability
back
inside
the
force
and
abolish
outside
oversight
and
scrutiny
?
if
the
government
and
the
Dáil
accept
that
flawed
recommendation
from
the
O'Toole
commission
,
then
we
will
show
that
we
have
learn
nothing
from
the
McCabe
affair
or
the
Charleton
report
.
a
Garda
Síochána
need
good
structure
of
management
.
the
number
of
body
and
agency
that
surround
it
may
need
to
be
rationalise
,
but
that
must
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
important
principle
-
one
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
have
teach
we
again
-
that
policing
demand
accountability
.
as
he
put
it
on
page
292
:
a
police
force
be
a
aspect
of

this
help
no

.
this

have
be
about
call
that

to

.
the
Morris
Tribunal
be
about
the
same
thing
.
the
commission
of
investigation
conduct
by
Mr
Justice
Kevin
O’Higgin
,
which
report
to
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
on

,
be
about
the
same
thing
.
Central
to
this
inquiry
have
be
the
truth
.
this
be
not
the
time
to
consider
abolish
any
body
whose
function
be
to
demand
openness
,
accountability
and
the
truth
.
the
select
Committee

complete

Children

on
Health

complete
its
consideration
of
the
Children
's
Health
Bill
2018
and
have
make
no
amendment
thereto
.
there
be
several
specific
point
I
wish
to
raise
on
the
technical
detail
of
the
Bill
but
before
I
do
so
,
I
wish
to
address
the
rainy
day
fund
.
the
Labour
Party
be
at
pain
to
understand
the
necessity
for
such
a
fund
.
we
be
wonder
if
it
be
conjure
up
to
make
Fianna
Fáil
look
fiscally
responsible
and
whether
it
be
a
Fianna
Fáil
tool
or
a
Fine
Gael
tool
and
we
seek
more
transparency
and
openness
in
that
regard
.
while
the
fund
may
appear
prudent
,
take
€
1.5
billion
from
the
Ireland
Strategic
investment
Fund
be
just
a
change
on
paper
.
it
be
not
new
money
.
we
would
like
to
know
where
the
new
fund
will
be
invest
and
whether
it
be
simply
a
bailout
fund
for
the
bank
.
the
Labour
Party
have
argue
that
the
money
should
be
invest
in
affordable
housing
and
to
bring
about
real
social
recovery
.
I
have
hope
the
minister
would
give
great
detail
about
the
rainy
day
fund
,
how
it
will
come
into
being
and
whether
it
will
specifically
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
.
in
regard
to
action
on
climate
change
,
member
be
now
well
verse
in
the
report
of
the
Intergovernmental
panel
on
Climate
Change
,
IPCC
.
I
be
hopeful
that
between
the
minister
's
speech
on
budget
day
and
the
publication
of
the
Bill
,
we
would
see
some
real
and
meaningful
action
on
climate
change
.
we
cannot
ignore
the
advice
of
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
regard
tax
on
carbon
and
mitigating
that
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
that
that
at
risk
of
fuel
poverty
or
dependent
on
the
fuel
allowance
would
benefit
from
certain
allowance
in
that
regard
.
we
cannot
continue
to
ignore
climate
change
and
we
need
some
real
policy
intervention
that
result
in
drastic
change
in
human
behaviour
.
that
must
start
this
year
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
IPCC
report
.
I
be
pleased
that
member
of
the
panel
will
soon
address
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
because
it
be
important
that
we
hear
from
they
regard
radical
proposal
that
we
would
like
to
see
come
from
government
.
my
party
and
perhaps
other
in
this
House
would
support
such
measure
if
they
be
forthcoming
or
that
the
government
would
take
seriously
certain
intervention
propose
by
a
committee
or
by
Member
of
the
House
.
we
cannot
afford
to
let
another
fiscal
year
go
by
without
make
some
real
intervention
or
policy
change
on
this
issue
.
on
the
universal
social
charge
,
USC
,
a
worker
on
the
living
wage
of
€
24500
will
gain
a
little
more
than
€
20
a
year
from
the
change
to
USC
but
a
person
earn
€
70500
,
or
three
time
more
,
will
gain
€
126
,
or
six
time
the
tax
cut
.
this
matter
will
be
fully
discuss
on
committee
stage
.
four
out
of
five
worker
will
gain
nothing
from
the
change
but
the
high
earner
will
gain
up
to
€
130
per
year
.
when
one
combine
the
USC
and
income
tax
cut
,
a
person
on
€
70500
or
three
time
the
living
wage
of
€
24500
will
benefit
from
a
level
of
tax
reduction
14
time
great
than
will
a
person
on
the
living
wage
.
the
squeeze
middle
have
be
completely
ignore
in
that
conundrum
,
so
it
be
not
really
a
budget
for
that
grouping
in
that
context
.
it
be
a
budget
for
that
on
high
income
.
the
cut
in
USC
and
the
move
with
regard
to
income
tax
threshold
will
cost
approximately
€
284
million
.
every
member
in
this
House
could
have
think
of
very
good
way
to
spend
€
284
million
in
term
of
deliver
good
public
service
,
not
to
mention
much
more
economical
step
we
could
have
take
to
deliver
concrete
benefit
to
the
people
who
need
it
most
.
for
example
,
free
-
of
-
charge
school
book
at
primary
and
secondary
level
would
have
cost
€
40
million
while
pay
all
public
sector
worker
a
living
wage
might
have
cost
€
39.3
million
so
we
would
argue
that
it
be
not
a
solid
budgetary
decision
.
the
home
care
tax
credit
be
good
for
that
with
income
but
not
all
carer
will
benefit
equally
from
a
tax
credit
approach
.
direct
service
,
like
respite
care
,
would
be
fair
and
arguably
more
useful
for
many
carer
.
section
8
rightly
remove
accommodation
and
healthcare
from
be
treat
as
taxable
benefit
-
in
-
kind
for
member
of
the
Defence
Force
.
this
be
something
we
welcome
.
we
would
like
a
close
interrogation
of
that
measure
on
committee
stage
.
section
22
rightly
remove
the
rent
-
a
-
room
tax
relief
from
short
-
term
letting
such
as
Airbnb
without
affect
relief
for
student
dig
as
well
as
regular
letting
.
we
have
a
proposal
to
support
microbrewery
.
we
have
put
forward
a
amendment
for
the
benefit
of
the
minister
's
official
that
would
amend
section
78a
of
the
Finance
Act
2003
,
which
involve
relief
for
small
brewery
.
section
78a
of
the
Finance
Act
2003
would
be
amend
in
subsection
(
1
)
(
a
)
by
substitute
"
60000
hectolitre
"
for
"
40000
hectolitre
"
.
this
would
not
increase
the
alcohol
tax
rebate
such
brewery
can
claim
but
it
would
allow
they
a
great
output
while
still
be
class
as
microbrewery
.
the
EU
permit
up
to
200000
houlever
for
microbrewery
so
we
be
well
inside
the
limit
by
go
from
40000
houlever
to
60000
houlever
.
section
25
introduce
the
control
foreign
company
rule
,
as
require
by
the
EU
Council
Directive
2016
/
1164
-
atad
.
this
be
a
example
of
how
the
EU
be
rightly
move
to
reduce
aggressive
tax
avoidance
practice
across
the
Union
.
the
atad
,
along
with
the
OECD
base
erosion
and
profit
shifting
,
BEPS
,
process
,
show
how
country
be
come
to
grip
with
tax
avoidance
by
multinational
company
.
we
openly
acknowledge
that
Ireland
be
comply
with
this
new
rule
and
have
co-operate
with
the
OECD
process
as
well
and
so
it
should
.
however
,
we
must
also
think
about
what
this
mean
for
Ireland
in
the
medium
term
.
be
we
ready
to
replace
we
reliance
on
foreign
direct
investment
with
the
next
phase
of
we
economic
development
?
what
be
that
phase
and
be
we
ready
?
I
would
argue
that
we
be
not
.
we
should
be
give
this
much
more
serious
thought
.
I
hope
there
would
be
more
measure
in
this
Bill
that
would
reflect
a
good
industrial
policy
to
allow
for
the
fact
that
as
other
country
lower
they
rate
to
that
of
Ireland
,
it
will
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
on
we
competitiveness
.
the
argument
be
whether
the
writing
be
on
the
wall
for
the
corporation
tax
rate
with
regard
to
its
competitiveness
.
there
be
no
argument
with
the
fact
that
it
must
be
retain
.
the
point
I
be
make
be
whether
we
need
to
shift
we
industrial
policy
to
reflect
we
reliance
on
foreign
direct
investment
and
whether
we
should
more
aggressively
target
new
market
for
export
.
I
be
sure
this
be
something
to
which
the
minister
will
return
.
section
30
provide
for
a
new
exit
tax
that
apply
to
people
take
asset
out
of
the
jurisdiction
and
out
of
the
EU
.
it
be
arguable
that
this
new
measure
have
not
be
adequately
explain
by
the
government
.
it
transpose
article
5
of
the
ATAD
into
Irish
law
.
we
have
a
exit
tax
for
individual
that
be
charge
at
the
capital
gain
tax
rate
of
33
%
.
apparently
,
this
close
a
certain
tax
loophole
that
be
be
exploit
.
this
will
now
be
supersede
by
the
new
tax
,
although
there
be
still
a
measure
to
block
the
tax
loophole
.
as
I
understand
it
,
and
,
again
,
I
seek
clarification
,
the
new
tax
will
be
levy
at
12.5
%
,
which
be
the
corporation
tax
rate
,
rather
than
33
%
but
the
rate
of
33
%
will
apply
if
the
measure
be
use
for
tax
avoidance
purpose
.
how
easy
will
it
be
to
identify
a
tax
avoidance
purpose
?
this
will
be
quite
difficult
.
what
be
happen
be
that
when
asset
be
move
abroad
,
include
intellectual
property
,
we
be
tax
unrealised
capital
gain
.
why
not
tax
they
at
capital
gain
tax
rate
?
grant
,
there
be
no
sale
and
,
therefore
,
no
realise
capital
gain
,
which
pose
cash
flow
issue
,
but
the
asset
or
wealth
gain
in
monetary
term
be
the
same
as
for
a
realise
gain
.
it
have
just
not
be
crystalise
.
why
tax
it
at
a
low
rate
?
with
regard
to
excise
,
the
definition
of
a
sugar
-
sweeten
drink
have
be
expand
.
with
regard
to
the
add
50
cent
on
a
pack
of
20
cigarette
,
the
price
of
cigarette
be
now
typically
between
€
12
and
€
13
.
this
might
not
do
much
to
deter
commit
smoker
but
it
do
help
deter
young
people
from
start
the
habit
.
there
be
a
argument
for
ramp
it
up
further
but
it
be
regressive
in
respect
of
that
on
low
income
who
be
addicted
.
the
healthy
Ireland
survey
find
that
about
22
%
of
Irish
adult
be
smoker
,
18
%
smoke
on
a
daily
basis
and
4
%
smoke
occasionally
.
this
still
translate
to
about
830000
smoker
in
Ireland
.
it
be
quite
a
significant
figure
.
the
price
of
cigarette
be
only
one
part
of
a
broad
campaign
to
help
people
quit
smoking
.
we
acknowledge
the
HSE
's
quit
helpline
,
plain
packet
and
warning
label
on
cigarette
but
be
the
pricing
mechanism
actually
work
or
have
it
reach
its
limit
?
do
it
have
a
high
proportionate
cost
with
regard
to
poorer
people
?
there
be
another
angle
to
this
that
be
slightly
obtuse
but
I
will
put
it
on
the
record
anyway
.
will
Brexit
bring
about
the
potential
for
smuggling
?
if
the
UK
move
to
a
mechanism
whereby
it
have
control
over
its
vat
rate
and
levy
0
%
vat
on
cigarette
,
will
we
see
a
return
to
the
duty
-
free
cigarette
regime
we
see
in
the
past
?
if
the
minister
have
time
,
could
he
address
that
and
whether
there
be
a
plan
for
that
scenario
?
we
would
like
to
hear
more
.
in
respect
of
bet
duty
,
we
proposal
to
lower
the
cost
on
SME
bookmaker
aim
to
ensure
that
bet
duty
be
pass
on
to
the
consumer
as
only
the
large
firm
can
absorb
the
cost
.
bet
duty
be
currently
1
%
and
be
define
by
Revenue
as
bet
enter
into
by
a
bookmaker
or
remote
bookmaker
with
person
in
the
State
.
in
we
alternative
budget
for
2019
,
we
call
for
betting
duty
to
increase
by
2
%
to
a
new
rate
of
3
%
at
a
yield
of
€
104
million
accord
to
Revenue
's
ready
reckoner
.
the
government
's
budget
call
for
a
increase
in
betting
duty
to
2
%
at
a
yield
of
€
52
million
.
bet
duty
be
much
high
in
the
past
.
it
be
up
to
20
%
on
turnover
.
let
we
be
clear
about
that
;
it
be
on
turnover
.
the
purpose
of
bet
tax
be
similar
to
that
of
excise
on
alcohol
and
tobacco
,
namely
,
a
tax
on
"
vice
"
,
a
word
I
put
in
invert
comma
,
design
to
lower
the
incentive
for
people
to
consume
.
compare
to
other
European
country
,
bet
duty
in
Ireland
be
relatively
low
.
in
economic
term
,
tax
that
be
primarily

to
change
behaviour
rather
than
raise
revenue
-----
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
I
support
the
private
Member
's
motion
and
thank
the
Green
Party
for
put
it
before
we
.
it
speak
to
common
sense
.
the
scourge
of
single
use
plastic
be
a
blight
on
we
environment
and
landscape
.
there
be
a
clear
demand
now
among
the
people
,
as
articulate
by
the
majority
of
member
in
the
House
through
the
motion
,
and
a
clear
view
that
we
must
now
move
towards
the
elimination
of
single
use
plastic
on
a
practical
basis
.
if
we
be
to
give
any
serious
consideration
to
the
IPCC
report
,
which
we
be
all
very
familiar
with
at
this
juncture
,
failure
to
take
radical
and
drastic
action
will
have
serious
consequence
for
humanity
.
I
be
not
give
to
verbosity
but
when
one
look
at
the
stark
figure
contain
in
the
IPCC
report
,
there
be
very
little
time
in
global
historical
term
for
we
to
do
something
radical
to
potentially
turn
thing
around
to
a
more
positive
vein
.
this
be
a
practical
motion
to
which
member
have
assent
.
we
should
not
be
fool
by
the
government
's
intention
to
abstain
on
it
or
read
that
as
government
assent
.
it
be
,
as
have
be
say
by
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
a
delay
tactic
.
the
money
message
be
a
mechanism
be
use
as
a
very
blunt
instrument
to
stint
the
progress
of
opposition
bill
and
motion
in
the
House
.
we
demand
action
on
this
issue
now
.
if
the
majority
of
Member
say
we
want
to
support
the
motion
,
that
should
,
in
a
democratic
process
,
give
rise
to
action
by
the
government
out
of
,
at
a
minimum
,
sheer
respect
for
the
democratic
process
.
we
need
radical
action
.
we
be
all
familiar
with
the
idea
of
deposit
refund
scheme
and
all
of
we
have
see
they
in
operation
.
they
work
in
many
western
European
country
and
be
base
on
pragmatism
and
common
sense
.
why
can
we
not
move
in
a
direction
which
seek
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
single
use
plastic
?
we
all
realise
as
consumer
and
citizen
that
if
we
do
not
tackle
this
issue
,
the
scourge
of
single
use
plastic
,
particularly
around
we
coastline
,
will
get
bad
.
I
speak
as
a
sea
kayaker
.
it
be
something
I
do
as
a
pastime
.
there
be
nothing
more
beneficial
than
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
in
a
boat
on
one
's
own
steam
.
it
be
depressing
to
see
the
amount
of
plastic
wash
up
on
beach
with
every
tide
or
the
plastic
that
float
at
sea
when
one
get
out
far
enough
.
as
a
island
nation
with
a
proud
maritime
history
,
we
need
to
do
something
to
tackle
it
and
to
take
leadership
on
this
issue
,
if
not
for
this
generation
,
for
future
generation
.
I
look
forward
to
the
intervention
of
some
of
the
member
of
the
IPCC
who
will
be
before
the
House
to
address
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
because
it
will
bring
home
to
we
just
how
stark
this
problem
be
.
we
need
to
be
jolt
into
action
.
sometimes
in
this
house
we
be
in
a
bit
of
a
bubble
and
sometimes
people
outside
the
House
know
well
what
need
to
happen
in
term
of
action
.
they
be
demand
action
on
this
issue
,
which
be
not
a
insurmountable
one
.
it
can
be
tackle
with
some
co-operation
and
collaboration
.
the
motion
speak
to
a
pragmatic
approach
where
we
move
towards
a
eventual
phasing
out
of
single
use
plastic
.
in
the
meantime
,
it
propose
,
as
a
intervention
,
the
introduction
of
a
deposit
refund
scheme
,
as
be
commonplace
in
other
country
.
we
also
need
to
consider
invest
in
the
establishment
of
glass
bottling
plant
.
perhaps
this
have
be
speak
about
already
and
it
have
certainly
be
speak
about
previously
.
the
idea
that
we
become
producer
of
glass
bottle
and
further
incentivise
the
constant
reuse
of
material
be
common
sense
.
we
do
this
before
plastic
become
omnipresent
and
there
be
a
demand
for
it
.
there
be
many
worthwhile
cause
throughout
Ireland
now
.
member
of
clean
Coast
Ballynamona
in
east
Cork
be
out
every
weekend
clean
up
beach
and
do
a
mighty
job
.
what
we
see
in
that
be
people
power
.
it
be
people
and
community
come
together
across
the
generation
,
not
radical
action
.
they
want
to
be
able
to
walk
on
pristine
beach
again
.
they
want
to
ensure
that
water
quality
be
of
a
certain
standard
.
it
bring
I
to
the
issue
of
ban
microplastic
,
on
which
I
have
a
Bill
that
have
reach
committee
stage
.
the
relevant
committee
have
analyse
the
microplastic
Bill
.
I
be
wait
for
a
money
message
on
it
too
.
we
cannot
have
more
stalling
tactic
on
this
issue
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
Green
Party
first
bring
through
the
microplastic
Bill
,
on
which
we
take
up
the
cudgel
,
and
that
we
be
wait
for
the
government
to
publish
its
Bill
.
I
know
that
there
be
a
Bill
in
gestation
,
which
I
welcome
,
but
we
want
to
see
it
publish
in
order
that
we
can
all
examine
it
.
if
we
do
not
ban
microplastic
,
I
do
not
need
to
tell
deputy
or
anybody
watch
what
the
consequence
of
the
constant
presence
of
microplastic
in
marine
life
be
,
or
what
the
consequence
ultimately
will
be
for
human
.
one
do
not
have
to
go
too
far
to
witness
the
insidious
damage
microplastic
and
other
plastic
cause
to
flora
and
fauna
such
as
bird
.
we
have
a
opportunity
to
pass
a
motion
in
this
House
,
but
it
will
be
meaningless
as
a
motion
if
it
be
not
follow
by
action
.
there
be
a
willingness
on
the
part
of
this
House
,
and
every
deputy
,
to
try
to
bring
about
radical
change
in
we
attitude
to
plastic
and
to
try
to
legislate
for
change
in
human
behaviour
in
a
practical
way
.
in
the
context
of
taxation
,
the
imposition
of
increase
betting
duty
could
have
a
unintended
consequence
.
large
chain
of
betting
shop
be
able
to
absorb
betting
duty
through
a
reduction
in
profit
rather
than
pass
the
cost
to
consumer
and
some
can
cross
-
subsidise
it
through
they
online
profit
.
for
the
information
of
the
official
who
be
with
the
Minister
of
State
,
a
examination
of
the
account
of
a
small
betting
shop
over
a
two
-
year
period
show
that
it
will
have
a
betting
duty
liability
of
over
€
340000
for
each
year
,
a
amount
that
significantly
great
than
its
profit
margin
.
a
unintended
consequence
of
the
increase
,
if
it
be
not
pass
on
directly
to
the
consumer
,
be
that
the
small
outlet
will
suffer
but
the
big
operator
will
quite
easily
absorb
it
into
they
cost
base
.
I
ask
that
this
be
address
or
that
there
be
a
indication
by
the
government
regard
how
the
measure
will
work
because
we
must
try
to
speak
for
the
small
,
independent
high
-
street
outlet
,
particularly
the
intergenerational
or
family
interest
which
be
rapidly
go
out
of
business
because
they
cost
base
be
increase
dramatically
.

some

now
be

free
,
up
from

if
the

this
would
yield

divide
the

8.1
million
annual
cost
by
that

3333

indicate
that

2433

can
bet
that

be
in

it

that

seem
to
deal
with

avoidance
such
that
people
with
a
beneficial
interest
in
a
dwelling
hold
by
a
trust
will
not
be
able
to
avail
of
a
tax
exemption

it

be
good
to

more
about

or

tax
?
I
would
like
to
hear
more
on
this
proposal
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Finance
Bill
.
I
have
only
two
and
half
minute
to
speak
about
the
budget
.
this
be
a
welcome
change
.
the
Finance
Bill
be
the
statutory
mechanism
use
to
give
effect
to
the
measure
announce
in
the
budget
.
it
be
timely
to
reflect
in
a
more
positive
way
on
from
where
we
have
come
and
how
much
we
have
develop
in
recent
year
,
in
addition
to
the
great
sacrifice
that
have
to
be
make
by
the
people
and
politician
to
get
where
we
be
.
there
be
many
thing
that
we
still
have
not
achieve
;
about
which
there
be
no
doubt
.
we
have
a
serious
housing
problem
which
affect
young
people
and
with
which
we
have
to
deal
soon
rather
than
late
.
I
would
certainly
like
something
to
be
do
in
this
area
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
as
much
as
anybody
else
,
I
be
fully
aware
of
the
exigency
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
special
housing
committee
that
meet
two
year
ago
to
examine
how
we
should
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
in
the
country
generally
.
I
suggest
,
as
I
have
do
many
time
,
the
way
to
deal
with
the
issue
be
to
go
back
to
the
old
-
fashioned
system
of
rely
on
local
authority
and
affordable
house
.
that
system
be
change
about
25
year
ago
when
approve
housing
body
be
give
the
responsibility
to
take
over
from
the
local
authority
and
replace
they
.
for
my
sin
,
I
predict
at
the
time
that
this
would
not
work
,
but
everybody
scoff
and
say
it
be
the
great
idea
ever
and
that
it
be
bound
to
solve
the
problem
.
it
be
say
it
would
bring
private
money
to
the
public
house
-
building
programme
,
without
any
major
sacrifice
.
that
be
wrong
;
it
do
not
happen
in
that
way
.
all
that
happen
be
that
the
particular
housing
requirement
be
not
meet
and
it
have
not
be
meet
since
.
it
will
not
be
meet
as
long
as
this
body
be
compete
.
let
I
outline
my
reason
for
think
this
,
without
mean
any
disrespect
to
the
housing
body
.
in
fact
,
the
special
housing
body
be
very
good
and
prove
that
they
be
very
good
at
deal
with
specific
and
very
acute
problem
.
they
should
never
have
be
expect
to
deal
with
the
thrust
,
body
and
weight
of
the
housing
requirement
.
along
the
way
some
wise
person
decide
to
change
the
term
"
local
authority
house
"
and
"
affordable
house
"
and
to
use
instead
the
term
"
social
housing
"
,
as
if
identify
such
housing
be
free
in
some
way
or
other
.
that
do
a
lot
of
damage
to
the
effort
be
make
to
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
.
we
must
remember
that
housing
provision
pose
a
ongoing
problem
;
it
do
not
go
away
.
every
year
a
new
crop
of
people
require
housing
to
be
provide
in
one
form
or
another
.
that
in
the
low
income
group
be
compete
with
that
in
the
middle
income
group
.
they
be
come
downhill
at
the
former
and
compete
with
they
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
.
it
be
a
very
unfair
game
.
neither
the
middle
income
group
nor
the
low
income
group
be
be
satisfied
and
they
cannot
be
because
house
price
be
be
control
by
one
sector
.
the
housing
crisis
be
be
control
by
the
same
sector
.
it
will
never
change
unless
there
be
specific
change
to
the
structure
of
the
housing
development
process
and
responsibility
be
return
to
the
local
authority
.
they
must
in
turn
be
give
a
programme
each
year
with
target
they
must
meet
and
provide
.
that
be
easily
do
because
all
the
budgetary
and
census
figure
be
available
.
they
be
available
in
respect
of
the
need
to
provide
school
place
,
public
utility
and
service
.
housing
be
nothing
exceptional
in
that
regard
.
it
be
just
another
issue
that
must
be
deal
with
.
the
other
issue
in
this
regard
relate
to
taxation
in
general
.
local
authority
housing
applicant
who
find
themselves
force
up
the
ladder
to
compete
with
other
in
the
private
housing
sector
in
some
case
end
up
spend
up
to
€
2000
per
month
.
that
be
a
lethal
situation
.
the
affordable
and
local
authority
housing
system
be
part
of
we
taxation
system
when
it
be
work
properly
.
that
mean
the
people
in
a
particular
income
bracket
be
not
force
to
seek
high
wage
,
because
that
be
the
only
other
way
they
could
go
.
that
happen
in
the
case
of
benchmarking
some
year
ago
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
to
address
the
fact
that
it
be
not
possible
for
people
to
live
due
to
the
cost
of
living
arise
from
massively
increase
house
price
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
in
the
public
sector
but
it
impact
on
the
private
sector
in
turn
and
inflate
the
economy
to
the
extent
that
we
know
what
happen
eventually
.
it
should
not
have
happen
but
that
be
the
way
it
be
.
it
be
no
harm
to
reflect
on
the
way
we
use
to
do
thing
and
on
the
way
we
appear
to
have
get
into
a
rut
and
be
unable
to
look
at
the
positive
thing
that
be
there
.
it
be
easy
for
the
Opposition
to
pour
cold
water
on
everything
the
government
do
.
it
do
it
very
well
,
and
I
be
sure
I
do
it
too
when
I
be
in
a
similar
situation
.
however
,
I
have
learn
new
way
to
do
it
from
listen
to
the
Opposition
over
recent
year
.
it
be
always
a
feature
of
this
House
that
there
be
a
recognition
by
whoever
be
in
opposition
of
the
effort
of
that
in
government
in
difficult
time
.
they
always
give
credit
for
that
.
that
have
disappear
now
.
in
fact
,
the
only
thing
that
happen
now
be
that
whoever
be
in
government
be
blame
for
everything
that
go
wrong
and
the
Opposition
take
credit
for
everything
that
do
not
go
wrong
-
I
do
not
say
go
right
,
but
what
do
not
go
wrong
.
we
must
learn
from
that
.
the
way
we
debate
in
the
House
have
change
,
and
not
for
the
good
.
we
should
never
say
anything
in
the
House
that
we
could
not
say
to
people
outside
the
House
.
that
be
part
and
parcel
of
what
we
must
do
if
we
be
to
establish
respect
for
each
other
in
the
House
.
in
return
,
people
outside
the
House
will
have
respect
for
the
Member
of
the
House
and
for
one
another
.
we
be
quite
good
at
that
over
the
year
even
in
turbulent
time
but
we
have
lose
we
way
in
that
regard
in
more
recent
time
.
I
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
current
position
and
the
challenge
that
lie
ahead
.
the
Finance
Bill
must
be
view
against
international
global
challenge
and
the
potential
for
world
trade
war
.
when
Peter
Sutherland
be
alive
he
be
a
major
player
in
achieve
equilibrium
in
world
trade
and
the
WTO
.
he
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
work
on
it
and
be
very
successful
.
his
influence
be
positive
and
we
reach
a
situation
where
small
country
be
no
long
the
minion
and
target
all
the
time
.
of
course
,
some
of
the
large
economy
do
not
like
that
.
they
would
prefer
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
,
like
great
white
shark
and
other
.
it
be
always
good
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
so
they
can
rely
on
they
for
support
on
particular
occasion
.
at
present
,
there
be
a
distinct
threat
of
a
global
trade
war
and
we
must
keep
that
in
mind
particularly
when
deal
with
the
budget
and
Finance
Bill
.
we
must
recognise
that
the
threat
be
ahead
of
we
and
hope
that
it
do
not
get
bad
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
any
diminution
of
foreign
direct
investment
here
.
some
member
of
the
House
would
welcome
that
.
they
will
say
that
there
should
not
be
any
foreign
direct
investment
and
that
it
should
be
elsewhere
.
of
course
,
elsewhere
will
always
welcome
that
because
elsewhere
want
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
.
it
be
we
competitor
.
when
we
be
in
that
situation
we
must
recognise
that
not
everybody
be
on
we
side
.
the
obvious
threat
of
Brexit
have
not
go
away
.
its
effect
will
not
go
away
unless
there
be
a
change
of
heart
in
we
neighbour
across
the
water
.
we
would
all
hope
that
there
would
be
and
that
it
would
revert
back
to
what
prevail
heretofore
,
acknowledge
the
sacrosanctity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
and
the
necessity
to
underwrite
it
and
stay
with
it
.
all
of
we
should
recognise
the
benefit
of
the
single
Market
of
more
than
500
million
people
.
it
be
a
sizeable
market
in
anybody
's
back
garden
,
without
go
to
the
wide
global
sphere
.
starting
with
a
market
of
500
million
people
be
a
fair
advantage
.
we
must
ensure
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
we
next
door
neighbour
withdraw
from
the
scene
and
we
end
up
pay
for
it
.
that
could
happen
,
and
we
must
guard

I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Finance
Bill
.
I
have
only
two
and
half
minute
to
speak
about
the
budget
.
this
be
a
welcome
change
.
the
Finance
Bill
be
the
statutory
mechanism
use
to
give
effect
to
the
measure
announce
in
the
budget
.
it
be
timely
to
reflect
in
a
more
positive
way
on
from
where
we
have
come
and
how
much
we
have
develop
in
recent
year
,
in
addition
to
the
great
sacrifice
that
have
to
be
make
by
the
people
and
politician
to
get
where
we
be
.
there
be
many
thing
that
we
still
have
not
achieve
;
about
which
there
be
no
doubt
.
we
have
a
serious
housing
problem
which
affect
young
people
and
with
which
we
have
to
deal
soon
rather
than
late
.
I
would
certainly
like
something
to
be
do
in
this
area
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
as
much
as
anybody
else
,
I
be
fully
aware
of
the
exigency
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
special
housing
committee
that
meet
two
year
ago
to
examine
how
we
should
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
in
the
country
generally
.
I
suggest
,
as
I
have
do
many
time
,
the
way
to
deal
with
the
issue
be
to
go
back
to
the
old
-
fashioned
system
of
rely
on
local
authority
and
affordable
house
.
that
system
be
change
about
25
year
ago
when
approve
housing
body
be
give
the
responsibility
to
take
over
from
the
local
authority
and
replace
they
.
for
my
sin
,
I
predict
at
the
time
that
this
would
not
work
,
but
everybody
scoff
and
say
it
be
the
great
idea
ever
and
that
it
be
bound
to
solve
the
problem
.
it
be
say
it
would
bring
private
money
to
the
public
house
-
building
programme
,
without
any
major
sacrifice
.
that
be
wrong
;
it
do
not
happen
in
that
way
.
all
that
happen
be
that
the
particular
housing
requirement
be
not
meet
and
it
have
not
be
meet
since
.
it
will
not
be
meet
as
long
as
this
body
be
compete
.
let
I
outline
my
reason
for
think
this
,
without
mean
any
disrespect
to
the
housing
body
.
in
fact
,
the
special
housing
body
be
very
good
and
prove
that
they
be
very
good
at
deal
with
specific
and
very
acute
problem
.
they
should
never
have
be
expect
to
deal
with
the
thrust
,
body
and
weight
of
the
housing
requirement
.
along
the
way
some
wise
person
decide
to
change
the
term
"
local
authority
house
"
and
"
affordable
house
"
and
to
use
instead
the
term
"
social
housing
"
,
as
if
identify
such
housing
be
free
in
some
way
or
other
.
that
do
a
lot
of
damage
to
the
effort
be
make
to
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
.
we
must
remember
that
housing
provision
pose
a
ongoing
problem
;
it
do
not
go
away
.
every
year
a
new
crop
of
people
require
housing
to
be
provide
in
one
form
or
another
.
that
in
the
low
income
group
be
compete
with
that
in
the
middle
income
group
.
they
be
come
downhill
at
the
former
and
compete
with
they
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
.
it
be
a
very
unfair
game
.
neither
the
middle
income
group
nor
the
low
income
group
be
be
satisfied
and
they
cannot
be
because
house
price
be
be
control
by
one
sector
.
the
housing
crisis
be
be
control
by
the
same
sector
.
it
will
never
change
unless
there
be
specific
change
to
the
structure
of
the
housing
development
process
and
responsibility
be
return
to
the
local
authority
.
they
must
in
turn
be
give
a
programme
each
year
with
target
they
must
meet
and
provide
.
that
be
easily
do
because
all
the
budgetary
and
census
figure
be
available
.
they
be
available
in
respect
of
the
need
to
provide
school
place
,
public
utility
and
service
.
housing
be
nothing
exceptional
in
that
regard
.
it
be
just
another
issue
that
must
be
deal
with
.
the
other
issue
in
this
regard
relate
to
taxation
in
general
.
local
authority
housing
applicant
who
find
themselves
force
up
the
ladder
to
compete
with
other
in
the
private
housing
sector
in
some
case
end
up
spend
up
to
€
2000
per
month
.
that
be
a
lethal
situation
.
the
affordable
and
local
authority
housing
system
be
part
of
we
taxation
system
when
it
be
work
properly
.
that
mean
the
people
in
a
particular
income
bracket
be
not
force
to
seek
high
wage
,
because
that
be
the
only
other
way
they
could
go
.
that
happen
in
the
case
of
benchmarking
some
year
ago
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
to
address
the
fact
that
it
be
not
possible
for
people
to
live
due
to
the
cost
of
living
arise
from
massively
increase
house
price
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
in
the
public
sector
but
it
impact
on
the
private
sector
in
turn
and
inflate
the
economy
to
the
extent
that
we
know
what
happen
eventually
.
it
should
not
have
happen
but
that
be
the
way
it
be
.
it
be
no
harm
to
reflect
on
the
way
we
use
to
do
thing
and
on
the
way
we
appear
to
have
get
into
a
rut
and
be
unable
to
look
at
the
positive
thing
that
be
there
.
it
be
easy
for
the
Opposition
to
pour
cold
water
on
everything
the
government
do
.
it
do
it
very
well
,
and
I
be
sure
I
do
it
too
when
I
be
in
a
similar
situation
.
however
,
I
have
learn
new
way
to
do
it
from
listen
to
the
Opposition
over
recent
year
.
it
be
always
a
feature
of
this
House
that
there
be
a
recognition
by
whoever
be
in
opposition
of
the
effort
of
that
in
government
in
difficult
time
.
they
always
give
credit
for
that
.
that
have
disappear
now
.
in
fact
,
the
only
thing
that
happen
now
be
that
whoever
be
in
government
be
blame
for
everything
that
go
wrong
and
the
Opposition
take
credit
for
everything
that
do
not
go
wrong
-
I
do
not
say
go
right
,
but
what
do
not
go
wrong
.
we
must
learn
from
that
.
the
way
we
debate
in
the
House
have
change
,
and
not
for
the
good
.
we
should
never
say
anything
in
the
House
that
we
could
not
say
to
people
outside
the
House
.
that
be
part
and
parcel
of
what
we
must
do
if
we
be
to
establish
respect
for
each
other
in
the
House
.
in
return
,
people
outside
the
House
will
have
respect
for
the
Member
of
the
House
and
for
one
another
.
we
be
quite
good
at
that
over
the
year
even
in
turbulent
time
but
we
have
lose
we
way
in
that
regard
in
more
recent
time
.
I
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
current
position
and
the
challenge
that
lie
ahead
.
the
Finance
Bill
must
be
view
against
international
global
challenge
and
the
potential
for
world
trade
war
.
when
Peter
Sutherland
be
alive
he
be
a
major
player
in
achieve
equilibrium
in
world
trade
and
the
WTO
.
he
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
work
on
it
and
be
very
successful
.
his
influence
be
positive
and
we
reach
a
situation
where
small
country
be
no
long
the
minion
and
target
all
the
time
.
of
course
,
some
of
the
large
economy
do
not
like
that
.
they
would
prefer
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
,
like
great
white
shark
and
other
.
it
be
always
good
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
so
they
can
rely
on
they
for
support
on
particular
occasion
.
at
present
,
there
be
a
distinct
threat
of
a
global
trade
war
and
we
must
keep
that
in
mind
particularly
when
deal
with
the
budget
and
Finance
Bill
.
we
must
recognise
that
the
threat
be
ahead
of
we
and
hope
that
it
do
not
get
bad
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
any
diminution
of
foreign
direct
investment
here
.
some
member
of
the
House
would
welcome
that
.
they
will
say
that
there
should
not
be
any
foreign
direct
investment
and
that
it
should
be
elsewhere
.
of
course
,
elsewhere
will
always
welcome
that
because
elsewhere
want
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
.
it
be
we
competitor
.
when
we
be
in
that
situation
we
must
recognise
that
not
everybody
be
on
we
side
.
the
obvious
threat
of
Brexit
have
not
go
away
.
its
effect
will
not
go
away
unless
there
be
a
change
of
heart
in
we
neighbour
across
the
water
.
we
would
all
hope
that
there
would
be
and
that
it
would
revert
back
to
what
prevail
heretofore
,
acknowledge
the
sacrosanctity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
and
the
necessity
to
underwrite
it
and
stay
with
it
.
all
of
we
should
recognise
the
benefit
of
the
single
Market
of
more
than
500
million
people
.
it
be
a
sizeable
market
in
anybody
's
back
garden
,
without
go
to
the
wide
global
sphere
.
starting
with
a
market
of
500
million
people
be
a
fair
advantage
.
we
must
ensure
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
we
next
door
neighbour
withdraw
from
the
scene
and
we
end
up
pay
for
it
.
that
could
happen
,
and
we
must
guard
against
it
.
we
will
do
that
by
be
certain
we
retain
sufficient
ownership
of
we
economy
at
all
time
so
we
can
battle
as
well
as
anybody
else
in
the
troubled
water
that
might
lie
ahead
.
I
have
great
confidence
in
we
ability
as
a
nation
to
survive
in
that
situation
.
in

,
we
have
a

I
be
a
member
of
the
special
housing
committee
that
meet
two
year
ago
to
examine
how
we
should
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
in
the
country
generally
.
I
suggest
,
as
I
have
do
many
time
,
the
way
to
deal
with
the
issue
be
to
go
back
to
the
old
-
fashioned
system
of
rely
on
local
authority
and
affordable
house
.
that
system
be
change
about
25
year
ago
when
approve
housing
body
be
give
the
responsibility
to
take
over
from
the
local
authority
and
replace
they
.
for
my
sin
,
I
predict
at
the
time
that
this
would
not
work
,
but
everybody
scoff
and
say
it
be
the
great
idea
ever
and
that
it
be
bound
to
solve
the
problem
.
it
be
say
it
would
bring
private
money
to
the
public
house
-
building
programme
,
without
any
major
sacrifice
.
that
be
wrong
;
it
do
not
happen
in
that
way
.
all
that
happen
be
that
the
particular
housing
requirement
be
not
meet
and
it
have
not
be
meet
since
.
it
will
not
be
meet
as
long
as
this
body
be
compete
.
let
I
outline
my
reason
for
think
this
,
without
mean
any
disrespect
to
the
housing
body
.
in
fact
,
the
special
housing
body
be
very
good
and
prove
that
they
be
very
good
at
deal
with
specific
and
very
acute
problem
.
they
should
never
have
be
expect
to
deal
with
the
thrust
,
body
and
weight
of
the
housing
requirement
.
along
the
way
some
wise
person
decide
to
change
the
term
"
local
authority
house
"
and
"
affordable
house
"
and
to
use
instead
the
term
"
social
housing
"
,
as
if
identify
such
housing
be
free
in
some
way
or
other
.
that
do
a
lot
of
damage
to
the
effort
be
make
to
deal
with
the
housing
crisis
.
we
must
remember
that
housing
provision
pose
a
ongoing
problem
;
it
do
not
go
away
.
every
year
a
new
crop
of
people
require
housing
to
be
provide
in
one
form
or
another
.
that
in
the
low
income
group
be
compete
with
that
in
the
middle
income
group
.
they
be
come
downhill
at
the
former
and
compete
with
they
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
.
it
be
a
very
unfair
game
.
neither
the
middle
income
group
nor
the
low
income
group
be
be
satisfied
and
they
cannot
be
because
house
price
be
be
control
by
one
sector
.
the
housing
crisis
be
be
control
by
the
same
sector
.
it
will
never
change
unless
there
be
specific
change
to
the
structure
of
the
housing
development
process
and
responsibility
be
return
to
the
local
authority
.
they
must
in
turn
be
give
a
programme
each
year
with
target
they
must
meet
and
provide
.
that
be
easily
do
because
all
the
budgetary
and
census
figure
be
available
.
they
be
available
in
respect
of
the
need
to
provide
school
place
,
public
utility
and
service
.
housing
be
nothing
exceptional
in
that
regard
.
it
be
just
another
issue
that
must
be
deal
with
.
the
other
issue
in
this
regard
relate
to
taxation
in
general
.
local
authority
housing
applicant
who
find
themselves
force
up
the
ladder
to
compete
with
other
in
the
private
housing
sector
in
some
case
end
up
spend
up
to
€
2000
per
month
.
that
be
a
lethal
situation
.
the
affordable
and
local
authority
housing
system
be
part
of
we
taxation
system
when
it
be
work
properly
.
that
mean
the
people
in
a
particular
income
bracket
be
not
force
to
seek
high
wage
,
because
that
be
the
only
other
way
they
could
go
.
that
happen
in
the
case
of
benchmarking
some
year
ago
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
to
address
the
fact
that
it
be
not
possible
for
people
to
live
due
to
the
cost
of
living
arise
from
massively
increase
house
price
.
benchmarking
be
introduce
in
the
public
sector
but
it
impact
on
the
private
sector
in
turn
and
inflate
the
economy
to
the
extent
that
we
know
what
happen
eventually
.
it
should
not
have
happen
but
that
be
the
way
it
be
.
it
be
no
harm
to
reflect
on
the
way
we
use
to
do
thing
and
on
the
way
we
appear
to
have
get
into
a
rut
and
be
unable
to
look
at
the
positive
thing
that
be
there
.
it
be
easy
for
the
Opposition
to
pour
cold
water
on
everything
the
government
do
.
it
do
it
very
well
,
and
I
be
sure
I
do
it
too
when
I
be
in
a
similar
situation
.
however
,
I
have
learn
new
way
to
do
it
from
listen
to
the
Opposition
over
recent
year
.
it
be
always
a
feature
of
this
House
that
there
be
a
recognition
by
whoever
be
in
opposition
of
the
effort
of
that
in
government
in
difficult
time
.
they
always
give
credit
for
that
.
that
have
disappear
now
.
in
fact
,
the
only
thing
that
happen
now
be
that
whoever
be
in
government
be
blame
for
everything
that
go
wrong
and
the
Opposition
take
credit
for
everything
that
do
not
go
wrong
-
I
do
not
say
go
right
,
but
what
do
not
go
wrong
.
we
must
learn
from
that
.
the
way
we
debate
in
the
House
have
change
,
and
not
for
the
good
.
we
should
never
say
anything
in
the
House
that
we
could
not
say
to
people
outside
the
House
.
that
be
part
and
parcel
of
what
we
must
do
if
we
be
to
establish
respect
for
each
other
in
the
House
.
in
return
,
people
outside
the
House
will
have
respect
for
the
Member
of
the
House
and
for
one
another
.
we
be
quite
good
at
that
over
the
year
even
in
turbulent
time
but
we
have
lose
we
way
in
that
regard
in
more
recent
time
.
I
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
current
position
and
the
challenge
that
lie
ahead
.
the
Finance
Bill
must
be
view
against
international
global
challenge
and
the
potential
for
world
trade
war
.
when
Peter
Sutherland
be
alive
he
be
a
major
player
in
achieve
equilibrium
in
world
trade
and
the
WTO
.
he
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
work
on
it
and
be
very
successful
.
his
influence
be
positive
and
we
reach
a
situation
where
small
country
be
no
long
the
minion
and
target
all
the
time
.
of
course
,
some
of
the
large
economy
do
not
like
that
.
they
would
prefer
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
,
like
great
white
shark
and
other
.
it
be
always
good
to
have
minion
in
they
vicinity
so
they
can
rely
on
they
for
support
on
particular
occasion
.
at
present
,
there
be
a
distinct
threat
of
a
global
trade
war
and
we
must
keep
that
in
mind
particularly
when
deal
with
the
budget
and
Finance
Bill
.
we
must
recognise
that
the
threat
be
ahead
of
we
and
hope
that
it
do
not
get
bad
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
any
diminution
of
foreign
direct
investment
here
.
some
member
of
the
House
would
welcome
that
.
they
will
say
that
there
should
not
be
any
foreign
direct
investment
and
that
it
should
be
elsewhere
.
of
course
,
elsewhere
will
always
welcome
that
because
elsewhere
want
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
.
it
be
we
competitor
.
when
we
be
in
that
situation
we
must
recognise
that
not
everybody
be
on
we
side
.
the
obvious
threat
of
Brexit
have
not
go
away
.
its
effect
will
not
go
away
unless
there
be
a
change
of
heart
in
we
neighbour
across
the
water
.
we
would
all
hope
that
there
would
be
and
that
it
would
revert
back
to
what
prevail
heretofore
,
acknowledge
the
sacrosanctity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
and
the
necessity
to
underwrite
it
and
stay
with
it
.
all
of
we
should
recognise
the
benefit
of
the
single
Market
of
more
than
500
million
people
.
it
be
a
sizeable
market
in
anybody
's
back
garden
,
without
go
to
the
wide
global
sphere
.
starting
with
a
market
of
500
million
people
be
a
fair
advantage
.
we
must
ensure
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
we
next
door
neighbour
withdraw
from
the
scene
and
we
end
up
pay
for
it
.
that
could
happen
,
and
we
must
guard
against
it
.
we
will
do
that
by
be
certain
we
retain
sufficient
ownership
of
we
economy
at
all
time
so
we
can
battle
as
well
as
anybody
else
in
the
troubled
water
that
might
lie
ahead
.
I
have
great
confidence
in
we
ability
as
a
nation
to
survive
in
that
situation
.
in
addition
,
we
have
a
duty
to
look
after
we
neighbour
in
Northern
Ireland
.
we
be
inextricably
link
economically
and
socially
despite
all
the
thing
that
have
happen
.
as
the
Queen
say
in
she
speech
,
we
might
be
good
off
if
some
of
they
have
not
happen
.
now
,
however
,
we
must
ensure
that
we
do
nothing
disruptive
.
we
will
not
do
that
in
this
jurisdiction
but
we
must
hope
that
in
adjoin
jurisdiction
we
do
not
find
ourselves
in
a
less
providential
situation
than
we
have
heretofore
.
this
island
must
be
able
to
trade
in
a
single
Market
,
North
and
South
,
for
the
benefit
of
both
the
North
and
the
South
.
together
we
can
play
we
part
.
a
unite
Ireland
aside
,
this
be
simple
economics
and
we
have
a
major
role
to
play
in
the
European
Union
as
well
.
in
recent
year
we
endure
probably
the
most
rigorous
test
we
have
ever
face
,
when
we
find
ourselves
break
.
I
be
not
attribute
a
political
agenda
to
this
because
this
thing
can
happen
at
any
time
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
they
do
not
happen
again
or
that
we
have
do
we
good
to
avert
the
bad
excess
of
what
might
happen
.
item
such
as
the
rainy
day
fund
,
while
not
massive
,
be
a
indication
of
what
we
have
in
mind
at
budget
time
and
in
the
Finance
Bill
.
it
be
a
wise
decision
because
,
if
need
be
,
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
borrow
on
the
international
market
at
low
interest
rate
.
if
we
do
thing
wrong
and
throw
caution
to
the
wind
by
spend
injudiciously
,
we
will
not
have
that
back
.
not
even
we
European
colleague
would
be
secure
with
that
.
it
be
important
to
ensure
that
we
European
colleague
have
sufficient
confidence
in
we
as
a
nation
to
withstand
anything
that
happen
,
and
they
will
as
long
as
we
be
prudent
in
how
we
manage
we
finances
.
we
should
also
remember
that
notwithstand
the
fact
the
IMF
have
withdraw
from
Government
Buildings
,
a
problem
still
remain
.
we
must
remain
alert
and
try
to
ensure
that
when
that
time
come
we
will
recover
again
if
we
have
to
,
we
will
depend
on
ourselves
to
do
it
and
we
will
accept
the
support
of
we
colleague
in
Europe
in
that
effort
.
I
refer
to
the
plight
of
serve
member
of
the
Defence
Force
who
find
themselves
in
deplorable
condition
relate
to
they
pay
and
entitlement
.
what
step
be
be
take
to
alleviate
the
hardship
be
endure
by
many
such
member
?
the
family
and
spouse
of
defence
force
personnel
recently
march
to
this
house
in
a
very
dignified
way
and
hand
letter
to
the
government
to
seek
to
ensure
that
they
dignity
be
maintain
and
that
we
recognise
the
service
they
give
to
this
country
.
what
step
be
be
take
to
ensure
that
there
be
the
require
core
of
military
personnel
across
the
Air
Corps
,
Naval
Service
and
Army
?
as
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
aware
,
member
of
the
Naval
Service
reserve
be
recently
ask
to
fill
full
-
time
place
within
the
Naval
Service
.
today
of
all
day
,
the
100th
Unite
Nation
Day
,
it
be
unedifying
for
the
country
to
have
a
shortage
of
competent
military
personnel
.
I
hope
to
hear
something
positive
from
the
Minister
of
State
regard
he
intention
for
concrete
action
to
ensure
that
the
condition
under
which
people
work
within
the
service
be
address
such
that
they
,
at
least
,
receive
the
living
wage
and
be
pay
a
fair
day
's
salary
for
a
fair
day
's
work
.
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
a
core
crew
of
competent
personnel
across
the
Army
,
Naval
Service
and
Air
Corps
.
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
.
it
present
a
very
rosy
picture
.
the
Minister
of
State
stand
up
here
and
say
on
the
record
of
the
House
that
pay
for
a
3
star
private
,
which
be
the
starting
rank
for
enlist
personnel
,
be
€
35000
gross
while
pay
for
the
average
able
seaman
,
which
be
the
equivalent
rank
in
the
Naval
Service
,
be
€
37000
gross
.
I
do
not
know
if
that
be
the
experience
base
on
a
average
working
week
of
39
hour
because
if
we
examine
that
figure
more
closely
,
we
will
find
that
most
people
who
be
within
the
service
be
work
far
in
excess
of
39
hour
per
week
.
when
we
annualise
the
hour
and
the
average
hour
per
week
work
for
the
salary
that
be
be
articulate
here
,
the
picture
be
far
more
stark
than
the
one
present
to
we
by
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
have
a
example
involve
a
soldier
with
20
year
service
who
get
a
affordable
house
with
a
mortgage
ten
year
ago
.
he
have
a
monthly
mortgage
payment
of
€700
and
two
daughter
and
receive
€
500
per
week
on
average
from
the
Defence
Force
.
he
be
apply
for
family
income
supplement
.
no
soldier
or
member
of
the
Naval
Service
or
Air
Corps
should
have
to
apply
for
family
income
supplement
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
make
.
there
be
a
gap
somewhere
between
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
tell
we
and
the
reality
for
soldier
on
the
ground
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
too
rhetorical
about
this
.
I
want
to
give
the
Minister
of
State
a
chance
to
deal
with
this
issue
and
I
think
we
have
give
the
government
a
fair
wind
to
deal
with
it
.
I
know
of
soldier
who
be
take
home
€300
per
week
.
the
military
allowance
of
€
120
be
be
use
to
make
up
core
pay
when
it
should
be
additional
pay
.
there
be
all
sort
of
issue
there
.
every
member
of
the
House
could
come
before
we
with
individual
example
of
soldier
in
they
constituency
or
member
of
the
Defence
Force
but
I
still
believe
there
be
a
lot
of
work
to
be
do
by
government
to
make
soldiering
and
work
in
the
Naval
Service
or
Air
Corps
something
to
be
proud
of
.
the
rate
of
attrition
be
due
to
the
fact
that
basic
rate
of
pay
be
too
poor
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday

.

I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
welfare
of
child
throughout
the
State
.
today
we
have
the
publication
of
the
HIQA
report
on
the
special
care
unit
at
Coovagh
,
Ballydowd
and
Glenaulin
in
Cork
.
we
have
have
numerous
hiqa
report
on
child
protection
,
foster
care
,
residential
care
,
adoption
and
so
on
.
we
do
not
,
as
yet
,
have
a
affordable
childcare
scheme
.
we
have
be
tell
it
will
be
roll
out
in
November
2019
.
we
have
serious
issue
in
respect
of
Tusla
and
the
absence
of
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
.
we
also
have
serious
issue
around
residential
respite
place
for
child
with
intellectual
disability
.
I
ask
that
provision
be
make
to
discuss
service
for
child
across
the
State
and
across
a
whole
range
of
area
.
there
be
a
lack
of
urgency
on
the
part
of
government
on
a
number
of
issue
to
do
with
the
welfare
of
child
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
decline
in
water
quality
at
Bellvelly
on
the
great
island
of
Cobh
.
I
be
contact
by
resident
of
the
area
who
tell
I
that
on
Monday
last
Irish
Water
lift
a
"
do
not
use
"
notice
.
the
company
state
that
customer
could
resume
normal
usage
of
the
water
for
drinking
,
food
preparation
,
brushing
tooth
and
other
domestic
use
.
the
notice
be
lift
follow
consultation
with
the
HSE
and
the
receipt
of
satisfactory
monitoring
result
indicate
the
new
water
supply
be
safe
to
drink
.
councillor
Cathal
Rasmussen
and
I
meet
the
resident
last
Monday
evening
after
the
Irish
Water
notice
be
lift
and
we
be
give
recent
sample
of
the
water
.
if
I
could
bring
one
of
the
sample
to
the
House
,
I
would
do
so
.
I
be
not
a
scientist
,
but
it
be
clear
that
the
water
be
not
suitable
for
human
consumption
or
other
domestic
use
.
it
be
very
discoloured
.
it
be
normal
practice
for
member
to
try
to
work
through
any
issue
in
respect
of
water
supply
or
sanitary
issue
in
we
constituency
with
Irish
Water
,
but
we
have
be
go
around
the
house
on
this
issue
for
some
time
and
I
feel
compel
to
raise
it
in
the
House
.
several
affect
family
want
a
solution
to
this
problem
which
have
be
go
on
for
20
year
.
they
want
the
restoration
of
a
safe
supply
of
potable
water
that
can
be
use
for
showering
and
other
everyday
domestic
use
.
they
want
a
water
supply
similar
to
that
enjoy
by
the
rest
of
the
country
.
that
be
they
right
.
Irish
Water
should
not
have
lift
the
"
do
not
use
"
notice
on
Monday
because
it
be
very
clear
that
the
water
be
of
insufficient
quality
and
something
have
go
wrong
in
the
system
.
the
resident
will
not
use
the
water
and
they
have
no
confidence
in
Irish
Water
.
they
can
present
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
water
be
still
very
discoloured
,
notwithstand
the
flushing
of
the
network
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
the
House
that
this
have
be
do
and
that
a
pH
correction
have
already
be
input
into
the
water
system
.
I
can
tell
he
now
that
the
water
quality
be
not
what
it
should
be
.
the
"
do
not
use
"
notice
should
not
have
be
issue
.
we
want
a
response
from
the
Minister
of
State
that
state
clearly
that
there
will
be
capital
investment
to
ensure
the
resident
of
Belvelly
have
a
adequate
and
proper
water
supply
.
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
.
he
have
give
I
some
comfort
with
he
assurance
that
he
will
raise
the
issue
with
Irish
Water
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
although
I
be
not
a
scientist
,
I
have
see
the
water
sample
that
be
present
on
Monday
at
approximately
8.30
p.m
.
the
"
do
not
use
"
notice
have
be
lift
some
time
on
Monday
morning
or
afternoon
.
the
resident
of
Belvelly
have
no
confidence
in
the
water
supply
.
we
want
Irish
Water
to
be
call
to
account
for
the
lift
of
the
"
do
not
use
"
notice
.
there
be
serious
public
safety
and
public
health
issue
for
the
resident
.
they
be
be
tell
by
Irish
Water
that
they
can
drink
the
water
now
,
but
they
see
clear
discolouration
when
they
look
at
the
water
.
there
be
child
,
baby
,
old
people
and
people
with
compromise
health
living
in
the
community
.
person
want
to
have
confidence
that
they
water
supply
be
as
it
should
be
.
we
want
to
see
a
evidence
base
or
benchmark
for
the
quality
assurance
use
by
Irish
Water
.
we
do
not
know
how
,
or
against
what
benchmark
,
Irish
Water
be
measure
what
qualify
as
or
what
constitute
good
or
bad
water
.
the
point
I
would
make
about
the
flushing
of
the
pipe
be
that
the
water
supply
infrastructure
be
very
old
and
Dickensian
.
it
need
capital
investment
.
in
light
of
the
number
of
people
live
in
the
Belvelly
area
-
I
have
be
tell
that
up
to
175
house
be
affect
-
I
be
ask
for
a
solution
to
be
find
.
if
we
can
find
€500
million
for
a
rainy
day
fund
,
I
be
sure
we
can
divest
a
fraction
of
that
amount
to
start
fix
problem
like
this
.
notwithstanding
the
Minister
of
State
's
comment
,
there
be
a
wide
issue
with
how
Irish
Water
sometimes
communicate
with
member
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
relationship
be
very
positive
at
local
level
,
but
further
up
the
food
chain
the
level
of
engagement
with
member
tend
to
diminish
from
time
to
time
.
so
have
mine
,
to
be
honest
.
no
,
I
say
that
the
pipe
be
Dickensian
.
they
do
not
take
sample
from
the
tap
in
people
's
house
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on
the
other
hand
,

istigh
None
anocht
.
we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the
Gaeltacht
,
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
be
responsible
for
spend
over
€
25
million
in
public
fund
in
addition
to
money
it
have
from
its
own
resource
.
it
be
sell
factory
to
owner
who
be
and
always
will
be
base
in
the
Gaeltacht
because
it
suit
the
purchaser
to
have
údarás
factory
on
lease
and
to
be
able
to
develop
they
.
its
overall
annual
spending
amount
to
up
to
€
30
million
.
its
funding
be
increase
in
this
budget
.
however
,
the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the

and
then
on
the
Finance

or
social

I

system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on

we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to

in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the

,
Údarás
to

for
spend

it

it

its

its

the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the
budget
and
then
on
the
Finance
Bill
or
social
welfare
Bill
.
I
speak
on
the
social
welfare
Bill
and
the
Finance
Bill
before
I
get
the
chance
to
speak
on
the
budget
.
we
tax
system
be
extremely
complicated
.
deputy
fill
out
form
for
a
living
.
very
few
ordinary
small
taxpayer
fully
understand
the
tax
system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on
the
other

None
anocht
.
we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the
Gaeltacht
,
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
be
responsible
for
spend
over
€
25
million
in
public
fund
in
addition
to
money
it
have
from
its
own
resource
.
it
be
sell
factory
to
owner
who
be
and
always
will
be
base
in
the
Gaeltacht
because
it
suit
the
purchaser
to
have
údarás
factory
on
lease
and
to
be
able
to
develop
they
.
its
overall
annual
spending
amount
to
up
to
€
30
million
.
its
funding
be
increase
in
this
budget
.
however
,
the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the
budget
and
then
on
the
Finance
Bill
or
social
welfare
Bill
.
I
speak
on
the
social
welfare
Bill
and
the
Finance
Bill
before
I
get
the
chance
to
speak
on
the
budget
.
we
tax
system
be
extremely
complicated
.
deputy
fill
out
form
for
a
living
.
very
few
ordinary
small
taxpayer
fully
understand
the
tax
system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on
the
other
hand

None
anocht
.
we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the
Gaeltacht
,
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
be
responsible
for
spend
over
€
25
million
in
public
fund
in
addition
to
money
it
have
from
its
own
resource
.
it
be
sell
factory
to
owner
who
be
and
always
will
be
base
in
the
Gaeltacht
because
it
suit
the
purchaser
to
have
údarás
factory
on
lease
and
to
be
able
to
develop
they
.
its
overall
annual
spending
amount
to
up
to
€
30
million
.
its
funding
be
increase
in
this
budget
.
however
,
the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the
budget
and
then
on
the
Finance
Bill
or
social
welfare
Bill
.
I
speak
on
the
social
welfare
Bill
and
the
Finance
Bill
before
I
get
the
chance
to
speak
on
the
budget
.
we
tax
system
be
extremely
complicated
.
deputy
fill
out
form
for
a
living
.
very
few
ordinary
small
taxpayer
fully
understand
the
tax
system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on
the
other
hand

istigh
None
anocht
.
we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the
Gaeltacht
,
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
be
responsible
for
spend
over
€
25
million
in
public
fund
in
addition
to
money
it
have
from
its
own
resource
.
it
be
sell
factory
to
owner
who
be
and
always
will
be
base
in
the
Gaeltacht
because
it
suit
the
purchaser
to
have
údarás
factory
on
lease
and
to
be
able
to
develop
they
.
its
overall
annual
spending
amount
to
up
to
€
30
million
.
its
funding
be
increase
in
this
budget
.
however
,
the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the
budget
and
then
on
the
Finance
Bill
or
social
welfare
Bill
.
I
speak
on
the
social
welfare
Bill
and
the
Finance
Bill
before
I
get
the
chance
to
speak
on
the
budget
.
we
tax
system
be
extremely
complicated
.
deputy
fill
out
form
for
a
living
.
very
few
ordinary
small
taxpayer
fully
understand
the
tax
system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.
give
the
way
this
debate
have
be
organised
,
there
be
a
extent
to
which
it
feel
like
eat
one
's
Christmas
dinner
at
the
end
of
January
.
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
eat
this
Christmas
dinner
at
this
time
because
unfortunately
the
budget
debate
be
not
continue
when
it
should
have
be
,
namely
,
when
it
be
fresh
in
everyone
's
mind
.
I
admire
the
versatility
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Phelan
,
tonight
.
he
be
here
early
to
deal
with
social
welfare
matter
and
he
be
here
now
on
the
budget
.
I
hope
he
wield
as
much
power
in
government
as
it
appear
he
do
tonight
.
when
the
current
dáil
be
form
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
fundamental
reform
and
how
we
do
we
business
.
it
be
amazing
,
but
old
habit
die
hard
and
the
budget
day
charade
go
on
.
there
be
a
time
when
budget
day
be
a
very
exciting
day
here
.
a
big
parcel
of
surprise
be
unwrapp
for
the
electorate
,
some
of
which
be
good
and
some
of
which
be
bad
.
the
place
use
to
be
throng
with
people
,
but
the
people
be
always
ahead
of
we
.
on
budget
day
,
we
be
warn
about
only
get
two
ticket
each
and
about
the
overflow
space
in
the
coffee
dock
.
however
,
nobody
turn
up
.
the
people
have
realise
that
the
show
we
put
on
for
budget
day
be
a
bit
of
a
charade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
not
go
where
I
would
like
we
to
go
.
I
would
like
we
to
go
to
a
truly
iterative
process
.
it
be
a
iterative
process
in
the
cabinet
where
thing
go
over
and
back
,
one
look
at
scenario
,
reject
thing
and
take
thing
on
and
I
would
like
that
to
happen
in
committee
of
the
Dáil
too
.
while
we
have
set
up
a
budget
committee
,
it
be
like
a
lot
of
committee
here
and
be
not
iterative
.
this
committee
do
not
propose
various
scenario
and
then
tease
they
out
.
they
listen
to
all
sort
of
group
who
come
in
,
take
down
what
be
say
and
publish
a
report
.
that
be
not
a
real
debate
in
the
way
a
debate
should
take
place
between
politician
.
I
speak
early
about
fundamental
change
in
welfare
and
I
want
to
speak
now
about
fundamental
change
in
something
which
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
but
in
respect
of
which
very
little
action
be
ever
take
.
that
be
fundamental
change
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
carbon
tax
and
all
of
that
.
climate
change
and
carbon
tax
be
normally
approach
in
a
very
anti-rural
way
.
the
idea
be
that
if
people
be
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
the
cost
of
diesel
will
be
put
up
until
it
be
sky
high
to
force
they
to
live
in
town
.
if
one
be
raise
beef
cattle
,
one
will
be
force
to
go
into
tillage
,
even
if
one
's
land
consist
of
rock
and
bog
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
deal
with
a
issue
.
there
be
always
positive
,
win
-win
approach
to
issue
but
we
never
think
.
in
particular
,
environmentalist
seem
hell
-
bend
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
everything
they
propose
rather
than
a
lot
of
gain
with
little
pain
.
as
a
rural
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Doyle
,
will
know
about
something
I
have
be
harp
on
about
for
a
long
time
.
I
accept
that
public
transport
have
a
major
role
to
play
.
I
accept
that
,
particularly
if
environmentally
-
friendly
vehicle
be
use
,
public
transport
can
be
more
environmentally
friendly
than
private
motor
car
,
especially
that
with
a
internal
combustion
engine
.
it
be
also
a
efficient
way
of
transport
people
.
although
we
tend
not
to
debate
it
,
we
spend
€
60
million
on
bus
for
Dublin
and
€
40
million
on
bus
to
serve
the
3
million
people
who
live
outside
the
capital
.
one
would
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
provide
bus
but
if
one
add
in
rural
bus
such
as
rural
Link
,
the
total
cost
might
be
€
50
million
.
that
be
a
ratio
of
at
least
3:1
in
term
of
per
capita
spending
in
favour
of
the
urban
area
around
Dublin
which
have
a
population
of
approximately
1.1
million
.
if
one
be
unaware
of
the
figure
,
one
would
intuitively
think
it
be
the
other
way
around
and
that
far
more
would
be
spend
per
head
of
population
in
rural
area
.
if
the
minister
,
deputy
Ross
,
decide
to
invest
in
public
transport
in
order
to
make
it
practical
for
all
,
he
could
begin
in
a
county
such
as
that
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
Letterkenny
be
by
far
the
big
centre
of
population
in
County
Donegal
.
many
people
live
in
a
35
mile
radius
of
the
town
work
,
go
to
hospital
or
attend
the
third
level
institution
there
.
in
the
south
of
the
county
many
people
travel
to
Sligo
for
similar
reason
.
I
would
bet
that
there
be
very
poor
morning
and
evening
commuter
service
between
Letterkenny
and
place
such
as
Dungloe
and
Gweedore
.
if
it
be
anything
like
the
situation
in
Connemara
,
the
last
bus
to
Dungloe
or
Gweedore
probably
leave
Letterkenny
at
6
p.m
.
if
one
be
a
student
in
a
third
level
college
,
one
do
not
want
to
go
home
at
6
p.m.
.
the
student
's
parent
be
force
to
drive
in
and
out
like
yo
-
yos
.
in
plan
for
the
budget
,
we
must
be
clear
that
we
must
tackle
this
problem
and
that
there
be
certain
positive
way
we
can
direct
the
money
which
would
improve
the
lifestyle
of
many
people
and
also
achieve
another
target
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
we
carbon
footprint
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
arise
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
.
there
be
some
curious
thinking
go
on
in
the
government
.
I
admire
the
Minister
for
rural
and
Community
Development
,
deputy
Ring
,
because
he
manage
to
get
a
significant
amount
of
money
for
he
Department
.
however
,
it
frustrate
I
greatly
that
he
never
spend
it
.
year
after
year
,
he
get
a
wad
of
money
for
he
Department
but
cannot
spend
it
and
it
be
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
the
minister
pull
the
coup
to
end
all
coup
this
year
as
he
manage
to
get
€
55
million
for
the
rural
regeneration
scheme
.
however
,
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
of
he
spend
that
€
55
million
between
now
and
this
time
next
year
,
no
matter
how
much
talk
there
be
of
shovel
-
ready
project
.
he
must
first
approve
the
project
and
will
then
find
that
many
of
they
be
not
as
shovel
-
ready
as
he
think
they
be
.
he
will
then
have
to
seek
tender
for
the
project
.
the
Minister
of
State
opposite
,
deputy
Doyle
,
know
the
delay
involved
in
that
process
.
there
be
cooling
-
off
period
and
argument
and
one
must
get
bond
and
so
on
.
most
of
the
project
will
not
begin
until
June
of
next
year
,
if
they
begin
at
all
.
there
be
no
way
that
€
55
million
will
be
spend
in
time
to
have
a
mature
liability
by
this
time
next
year
.
on
the
other

None

.
we
have
the
chief
executive
of
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
in
with
we
tonight
.
one
must
remember
that
up
until
2009
-
10
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
infrastructure
in
the
Gaeltacht
,
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
be
responsible
for
spend
over
€
25
million
in
public
fund
in
addition
to
money
it
have
from
its
own
resource
.
it
be
sell
factory
to
owner
who
be
and
always
will
be
base
in
the
Gaeltacht
because
it
suit
the
purchaser
to
have
údarás
factory
on
lease
and
to
be
able
to
develop
they
.
its
overall
annual
spending
amount
to
up
to
€
30
million
.
its
funding
be
increase
in
this
budget
.
however
,
the
total
capital
expenditure
announce
for
the
Gaeltacht
,
include
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
,
be
€
13.7
million
.
if
Údarás
to
Gaeltachta
have
be
give
€
15
million
or
€
20
million
it
could
begin
refurbish
its
building
,
achieve
the
mature
liability
and
spend
the
money
.
if
it
be
give
the
modest
amount
of
€
8
million
rather
than
the
€
30
million
for
which
it
be
responsible
in
the
past
,
and
the
allocation
to
the
minister
's
rural
regeneration
scheme
be
decrease
to
€
50
million
,
the
minister
would
still
end
up
with
far
more
money
than
he
could
spend
for
the
third
time
in
a
row
since
he
Department
be
establish
.
that
money
could
be
spend
on
the
Gaeltacht
.
it
seem
that
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
allergic
to
the
Gaeltacht
,
the
Irish
language
and
spend
money
where
we
know
it
can
be
spend
in
a
profitable
way
and
on
a
agency
that
successfully
create
job
in
the
most
disadvantaged
and
peripheral
part
of
the
country
.
I
do
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
that
regard
.
it
be
very
strange
to
be
speak
on
the
budget
after
have
speak
on
the
Finance
Bill
.
the
normal
sequence
be
for
deputy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
on
the
budget
and
then
on
the
Finance
Bill
or
social
welfare
Bill
.
I
speak
on
the
social
welfare
Bill
and
the
Finance
Bill
before
I
get
the
chance
to
speak
on
the
budget
.
we
tax
system
be
extremely
complicated
.
deputy
fill
out
form
for
a
living
.
very
few
ordinary
small
taxpayer
fully
understand
the
tax
system
.
I
refer
to
people
earn
€
30000
,
€
40000
,
€
50000
or
less
,
not
that
earn
big
money
.
if
ordinary
taxpayer
be
ask
which
social
welfare
payment
be
taxable
and
which
be
not
,
very
few
would
answer
correctly
.
many
ordinary
people
be
miss
out
on
allowance
because
there
be
so
many
and
it
be
so
complex
.
the
Revenue
have
admit
that
.
I
be
not
talk
about
extraordinary
allowance
involve
big
accountant
who
be
pay
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
by
multi-millionaire
.
there
be
such
a
fear
of
fill
out
form
that
people
do
not
claim
allowance
.
for
example
,
a
non-standard
tax
allowance
be
available
to
that
employ
in
certain
profession
.
how
many
people
know
about
or
receive
it
?
I
be
not
talk
about
the
employee
allowance
of
€
1650
.
we
need
a
radical
simplification
of
we
tax
system
.
it
should
be
accessible
to
and
understandable
by
all
.
as
I
state
in
my
contribution
on
the
Finance
Bill
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
time
to
abolish
the
USC
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
point
out
that
it
be
introduce
by
Fianna
Fáil
.
yes
,
we
introduce
it
at
a
time
of
crisis
but
it
be
always
intend
to
be
a
temporary
measure
.
have
USC
,
pay
-
related
social
insurance
and
income
tax
be
wrong
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
should
only
be
two
such
charge
.
it
should
be
very
simple
for
the
ordinary
punter
to
claim
allowance
.
I
always
say
at
cabinet
that
we
should
abolish
all
the
small
allowance
and
use
the
save
to
give
a
good
basic
allowance
to
everybody
.
otherwise
,
it
be
that
who
be
good
at
understand
the
complication
of
the
system
who
gain
and
it
be
that
who
be
afraid
of
inquire
and
who
do
not
read
into
this
thing
who
lose
.
the
other
thing
that
be
amazing
be
the
lack
of
interaction
between
we
tax
code
and
we
social
welfare
code
.
that
catch
many
people
.
in
that
context
,
I
would
like
to
mention
something
that
be
creep
up
on
people
now
.
the
age
exemption
use
to
be
€
20000
for
a
single
person
and
€
40000
for
a
couple
.
that
be
very
handy
because
when
people
get
to
a
certain
age
,
they
do
not
owe
any
prsi
.
if
they
main
income
be
welfare
,
they
do
not
have
any
USC
liability
as
long
as
they
income
be
under
€
12,000
.
if
they
combine
income
as
a
couple
be
under
€
40000
,
they
do
not
have
any
tax
liability
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
people
in
question
be
exempt
from
fill
in
tax
form
.
during
the
downturn
,
the
€
40000
threshold
in
the
case
of
a
couple
be
reduce
by
€
4000
to
€
36000
and
the
threshold
for
a
single
person
be
reduce
to
€
18000
.
the
reality
be
that
we
increase
pension
by
€
5
every
year
.
the
increase
of
€
10
in
the
case
of
a
couple
amount
to
€
500
a
year
,
or
€
1500
over
three
year
.
as
a
result
,
more
and
more
pensioner
be
come
back
into
the
tax
bracket
.
it
would
have
be
very
simple
this
year
to
have
raise
the
threshold
to
the
previous
level
of
€
20000
,
or
€
40000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
.
the
amount
of
additional
tax
that
be
collect
because
of
the
move
from
€
40000
to
€
36000
be
small
.
the
change
be
a
nuisance
for
people
who
be
not
pay
income
tax
but
now
have
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
Revenue
's
decision
to
require
employer
to
make
return
in
real
time
every
week
.
I
hope
this
system
be
use
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
.
this
can
be
achieve
by
give
back
the
information
.
most
people
who
ask
get
a
pre-print
form
from
Revenue
.
if
a
self
-
employ
person
or
somebody
who
have
a
paye
income
get
a
pre-print
form
12
,
form
11
or
form
11S
in
June
,
for
example
,
Revenue
will
already
know
how
much
paye
income
that
person
have
,
or
how
much
be
be
declare
by
employer
.
I
can
never
understand
why
Revenue
do
not
tell
people
it
know
that
.
if
it
be
to
provide
the
relevant
figure
,
people
could
compare
they
to
the
figure
on
they
p60
.
Revenue
already
know
how
much
social
welfare
people
receive
.
this
be
facilitate
through
datum
matching
.
Revenue
know
exactly
what
taxable
income
people
be
be
pay
as
social
welfare
.
rather
than
make
life
easy
for
people
,
Revenue
require
they
to
write
to
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
to
get
the
relevant
figure
again
.
to
sum
up
at
this
late
hour
,
I
think
this
have
be
a
standing
-
still
budget
.
there
be
nothing
radical
in
it
.
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
will
lift
the
country
.
the
two
big
fundamental
remain
with
no
resolution
in
sight
.
the
first
one
be
the
whole
housing
crisis
.
nothing
that
be
announce
on
budget
day
recognise
that
not
enough
house
be
be
build
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
streamline
housing
and
make
it
attractive
.
nothing
be
be
do
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
on
reasonably
good
income
-
€
40000
a
year
,
or
€
80000
in
the
case
of
a
couple
-
to
buy
a
house
.
it
be
amazing
how
we
have
go
so
much
against
house
ownership
.
some
year
ago
,
one
could
get
tax
relief
at
one
's
marginal
rate
of
tax
in
respect
of
the
interest
on
one
's
loan
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
that
be
available
some
year
ago
be
worth
the
equivalent
of
€
15000
in
today
's
money
.
I
appreciate
the
point
that
could
be
make
about
a
tax
break
in
that
context
.
the
first
-
time
house
buyer
's
grant
be
great
because
it
be
pay
at
the
end
.
there
be
always
extra
cost
when
one
be
buy
a
house
or
build
a
new
house
.
it
be
useful
to
get
this
money
in
such
circumstance
.
traditionally
,
there
be
a
very
big
social
value
on
house
ownership
for
that
who
have
job
.
we
seem
to
have
lose
that
etho
.
last
month
's
budget
do
not
do
anything
philosophically
for
carbon
.
in
other
word
,
it
do
nothing
to
deal
with
climate
change
in
a
positive
way
rather
than
in
a
negative
way
.
it
do
nothing
significant
with
regard
to
social
housing
.
it
do
nothing
to
make
it
affordable
for
people
whom
one
would
expect
to
be
able
to
buy
they
house
to
do
so
.
it
do
nothing
on
the
health
crisis
.
it
provide
for
no
reform
to
make
the
bureaucratic
machine
,
which
be
get
more
complicated
by
the
minute
,
easy
for
the
people
to
approach
.
it
be
not
a
good
budget
.

the
Labour
Party
support
that
motion
as
well
,
for
the

.
the
a
Post

centre
in
Cork
,
we
be
tell
,
be
now
under
threat
of
closure
,
with
the
potential
loss
of
200
job
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
if
he
can
confirm
that
that
be
the
case
.
it
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
postal
service
in
the
southern
region
.
I
also
want
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
promise
that
be
make
in
respect
of
a
new
post
office
that
be
suppose
to
be
tender
for
in
Kilworth

.
do
a
Post
intend
to
close
the
Cork
mail
centre
,
with
the
loss
of
200
job
?
we
need
confirmation
on
that
.
I
ask
a
question
about
the
Cork
mail
centre
-----
perhaps
the
minister
could
respond
to
I
at
some
stage
before

with
the
Acting
Chairman
's
permission
,
I
will
engage
in
a
direct
exchange
of
question
and
answer
with
the
minister
.
my
first
question
be
how
much
be
this
go
to
cost
the
taxpayer
.
approximately
how
much
will
it
cost
the
taxpayer
?
what
provision
have
the
government
make
for
delivery
of
the
national
broadband
plan
?
I
quote
the
minister
:
"
it
be
now
my
priority
that
the
procurement
process
be
bring
to
a
conclusion
in
a
fair
and
transparent
manner
.
I
propose
to
revert
to
government
in
the
come
week
with
a
recommendation
.
"
be
it
possible
that
the
government
will
conclude
that
it
will
not
proceed
with
the
national
broadband
plan
?
give
deputy
Bruton
's
vast
experience
as
a
minister
and
as
a
member
of
this
House
,
and
the
fact
that
we
all
respect
he
,
could
he
please
be
a
little
more
forthcoming
on
what
he
assess
to
be
the
approximate
cost
of
delivery
and
the
likelihood
?
give
that
a
decision
be
due
in
a
matter
of
week
,
there
must
be
some
assessment
at
this
stage
of
the
cost
and
of
the
likelihood
of
there
be
a
successful
bidder
.
in
other
word
,
the
people
want
to
know
whether
Granahan
McCourt
will
end
up
be
the
final
bidder
and
,
ultimately
,
whether
they
will
end
up
pay
a
king
's
ransom
through
they
tax
for
the
privilege
of
have
Granahan
McCourt
as
the
successful
bidder
.
we
have
reach
endgame
on
this
one
.
we
be
sick
of
be
tell
that
it
be
a
matter
of
the
tender
process
and
it
be
secretive
.
if
I
pick
up
the
phone
to
the
ceo
of
a
number
of
company
or
if
I
scratch
the
surface
hard
enough
,
I
would
know
fairly
well
that
people
be
talk
to
each
other
informally
anyway
.
it
be
a
small
town
.
in
fairness
,
it
be
a
small
country
.
what
we
want
at
this
stage
be
for
the
primacy
of
parliament
to
be
recognise
and
for
there
to
be
some
straight
answer
from
government
in
recognition
of
and
out
of
respect
for
we
mandate
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
give
we
some
indication
at
this
stage
.
if
there
be
only
one
bidder
leave
in
the
room
,
what
of
the
technical
appraisal
need
to
be
go
through
at
this
stage
of
the
process
?
give
that
it
have
go
on
for
year
,
if
one
be
close
to
endgame
there
must
be
something
that
the
minister
can
impart
to
we
by
way
of
public
information
to
which
we
be
entitle
at
this
stage
in
relation
to
the
cost
,
the
process
and
whether
there
will
be
a
successful
bidder
or
not
.
there
be
only
one
bidder
leave
.
I
have
43
second
leave
.
a
figure
of
€
3
billion
be
in
the
public
domain
as
a
potential
cost
.
what
credence
do
the
minister
give
to
that
figure
?
be
the
minister
make
provision
for
the
potential
of
liability
at
this
stage
?
be
he
anticipate
any
litigation
by
the
underbidder
in
this
process
?
that
be
not
the

may
I
rise
on
a
point
of
order
?
I
find
this
disconcerting
.
Minister
of
State
after
Minister
of
State
be
roll
in
here
,
give
we
a
five
-
minute
statement
,
go
through
the
motion
and
then
walk
out
again
.
this
be
one
of
the
great
cris
that
we
have
face
nationally
and
globally
in
generation
.
more
respect
should
be
give
to
the
issue
at
hand
in
the
first
instance
.
there
be
a
obligation
in
law
for
the
minister
to
present
case
or
what
they
be
do
as
per
they
own
Department
.
there
be
no
opportunity
to
interrogate
that
whatsoever
.
there
be
young
people
here
today
.
the
optic
of
this
with
regard
to
how
this
parliament
deal
with
this
issue
be
atrocious
.
I
wish
to
record
that
.
I
express
my
disappointment
that
there
be
not
senior
minister
present
for
this
discussion
on
such
a
vital
topic
.
nobody
would
deny
that
the
minister
be
absolutely
commit
to
address
climate
change
.
his
integrity
in
respect
of
the
issue
be
beyond
question
.
his
interaction
with
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
be
one
of
quality
and
there
be
a
clear
commitment
on
he
part
to
seek
to
tackle
climate
change
in
a
systematic
way
.
notwithstanding
that
,
there
be
certain
obligation
under
the
Climate
Action
and
low
Carbon
Development
Act
.
that
be
why
we
be
have
this
statement
today
.
the
Act
prescribe
that
detail
on
emission
,
inventory
and
projection
should
be
publish
.
we
do
not
hear
from
the
minister
or
Minister
of
State
clearly
define
projection
as
to
how
they
propose
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
we
be
now
at
the
stage
where
the
annual
transition
statement
be
disconcerting
in
how
it
depict
a
lot
of
positive
action
,
without
state
clearly
how
far
this
country
be
off
course
in
tackle
climate
change
.
we
be
move
in
the
wrong
direction
in
climate
pollution
.
emission
be
rise
,
rather
than
fall
,
contrary
to
all
target
,
legal
obligation
and
political
commitment
.
under
the
Unite
Nation
Framework
Convention
on
Climate
Change
,
Ireland
agree
to
cut
emission
by
5
%
per
annum
from
2018
until
2050
.
Ireland
be
one
of
just
two
EU
member
state
that
will
not
meet
this
commitment
.
there
be
without
question
a
need
for
radical
action
.
we
have
to
see
a
great
sense
of
urgency
from
the
government
in
deal
with
the
challenge
we
face
.
it
must
involve
a
clear
policy
on
carbon
budget
.
secretary
General
have
come
before
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
.
it
have
to
be
say
that
,
in
the
case
of
most
Department
,
there
be
no
sense
of
urgency
about
a
set
of
mitigation
policy
that
would
contribute
to
the
cutting
of
emission
.
it
be
make
clear
in
the
recent
special
report
of
the
Intergovernmental
panel
on
Climate
Change
that
we
have
a
narrow
window
of
opportunity
to
enable
global
warming
to
stabilise
gradually
at
1.5°
Celsius
above
pre-industrial
temperature
.
it
have
be
well
articulate
that
this
will
require
unprecedented
change
within
the
next
12
year
.
we
have
to
reduce
net
carbon
dioxide
emission
by
approximately
45
%
from
2010
level
by
2030
.
we
have
to
transition
to
net
zero
emission
globally
by
around
2050
.
accord
to
the
minister
,
the
EPA
be
in
the
process
of
update
its
projection
for
greenhouse
gas
emission
to
reflect
the
impact
of
a
high
level
of
policy
ambition
.
for
example
,
the
climate
action
commitment
contain
in
the
national
development
plan
be
be
factor
in
.
I
think
we
need
to
see
that
happen
soon
rather
than
late
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
when
this
parliament
report
on
the
finding
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
,
the
policy
outcome
that
will
result
from
the
assembly
's
recommendation
be
more
radical
than
,
or
at
least
equal
to
,
that
recommendation
.
we
need
to
see
more
radical
action
at
community
level
in
respect
of
the
potential
to
use
wind
energy
and
for
the
deep
retrofit
of
house
.
community
need
to
be
help
to
own
and
buy
into
energy
project
.
as
we
have
articulate
at
the
joint
committee
,
there
be
numerous
possibility
to
do
thing
across
the
agriculture
and
environment
sector
,
as
well
as
other
.
they
can
be
measure
.
programme
should
be
under
way
within
the
next
three
month
.
if
we
do
not
start
to
act
on
a
quarterly
basis
,
with
proper
metric
and
proper
target
,
we
will
be
use
the
same
language
again
this
time
next
year
.
as
the
economy
grow
,
there
will
be
challenge
.
for
example
,
the
effect
of
increase
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
will
need
to
be
offset
.
the
only
way
to
do
it
be
by
ensure
the
fund
readily
available
to
the
government
be
use
in
a
way
that
will
facilitate
people
on
the
ground
who
want
to
take
radical
action
.
it
be
clear
from
the
report
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
that
people
be
of
a
mind
to
take
radical
action
.
we
need
to
put
in
place
policy
that
will
be
back
up
by
proper
funding
and
that
allow
people
to
start
to
take
action
at
all
level
,
down
to
community
level
.
that
mean
transition
away
from
diesel
and
petrol
vehicle
towards
electric
vehicle
and
provide
for
the
deep
retrofit
of
old
housing
stock
,
to
mention
just
two
example
of
something
that
could
be
do
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
with
some
energy
and
commitment
.
if
we
be
all
here
this
time
next
year
,
when
the
country
be
meet
its
obligation
under
the
annual
transition
statement
,
we
will
need
to
give
great
political
urgency
to
this
matter
.
by
this
time
next
year
,
we
must
ensure
we
will
have
reach
a
set
of
target
collectively
and
in
a
non-partisan
way
that
will
enable
we
to
say
we
be
see
clear
evidence
of
a
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
if
we
do
not
achieve
this
target
,
we
will
be
on
a
hiding
to
nothing
.

the

it

for

through

from
the
new
rule
book
that
have
be
agree
with
regard
to
put
the
2015
Paris
agreement
into
real
action
,
will
the
minister
give
I
a
sense
of
he
vision
in
term
of
the
type
of
funding
instrument
the
government
will
use
to
move
we
to
a
rapid
decarbonisation
phase
?
the
minister
address
the
Oireachtas
Committee
on
Climate
Action
on
5
December
and
make
very
specific
reference
to
the
€500
million
climate
action
fund
.
he
have
already
say
that
there
be
seven
major
climate
change
project
that
will
share
€
77
million
in
government
funding
.
he
also
make
reference
to
the
sovereign
green
bond
.
if
we
be
talk
about
how
the
decision
we
will
make
by
2020
will
determine
whether
global
heating
can
be
keep
at
1.5°
centigrade
above
pre-industrial
level
,
that
expenditure
will
be
vital
in
term
of
programme
that
will
be
put
to
good
use
on
we
own
little
island
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
tell
we
what
sense
of
urgency
exist
across
the
government
with
regard
to
deploy
that
funding
in
very
specific
area
like
decarbonisation
of
building
,
transport
network
and
smart
grid
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
from
he
that
there
be
a
urgency
across
government
with
regard
to
its
own
response
.
if
we
be
sign
up
to
this
rule
book
as
per
the
2015
Paris
agreement
and
if
we
be
serious
about
hit
the
pre-industrial
target
in
term
of
mitigating
against
a
1.5°
centigrade
increase
in
temperature
by
2020
,
what
measure
be
the
government
take
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
commitment
,
about
which
there
be
no
question
.
in
ask
the
question
,
I
be
try
to
find
out
what
the
sense
in
government
be
.
I
understand
that
the
minister
have
meet
the
various
line
Department
but
it
be
about
a
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
lead
directly
by
the
Taoiseach
that
recognise
the
urgency
of
the
challenge
and
ensure
that
the
net
behavioural
change
that
need
to
happen
so
that
we
can
hit
this
target
be
implement
.
I
would
not
like
to
see
this
become
too
process
-
drive
.
I
would
like
for
it
to
be
recognise
across
all
line
Department
that
the
silo
within
government
should
be
break
down
and
that
this
be
probably
one
of
the
big
challenge
we
will
face
as
a
country
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
I
would
like
to
see
a
massive
response
in
term
of
the
initiative
that
citizen
can
avail
of
in
term
of
good
transport
network
and
decarbonise
building
such
as
public
building
and
school
.
I
would
like
to
get
timeline
from
the
minister
as
to
when
he
can
start
roll
out
that
funding
for
bespoke
project
.

in
the
few
moment
I
have
,
I
will
refer
to
the
minister
's
speech
where
he
talk
about
how
there
have
be
a
particular
problem
in
Dublin
regard
some
of
the
large
signature
project
.
he
go
on
to
say
that
that
problem
arise
because
of
different
reason
that
make
they
tricky
to
solve
but
he
do
not
articulate
what
that
problem
be
or
what
he
propose
to
do
.
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
motherhood
and
apple
pie
in
the
minister
's
speech
.
he
speak
about
€
53
million
be
roll
out
in
2019
and
€
135
million
be
roll
out
in
sustainable
urban
transport
programme
.
all
of
this
will
be
up
to
2021
.
to
my
knowledge
,
we
have
not
have
any
new
greenway
since
the
minister
take
office
.
I
be
put
a
hand
up
here
boldly
for
the
Lee
to
Sea
Greenway
in
my
native
Cork
and
the
Midleton
-
Youghal
railway
line
in
respect
of
which
there
have
be
a
proposal
for
a
greenway
.
if
the
minister
be
serious
about
deliver
on
greenway
and
have
a
proper
regional
spread
of
they
to
facilitate
cycling
and
family
be
able
to
cycle
in
a
safe
way
,
that
two
proposal
should
be
top
priority
.
I
make
no
bone
about
make
that
request
.
when
I
put
down
parliamentary
question
about
cycling
policy
such
as
the
roll
out
of
dockless
bicycle
or
extend
scheme
beyond
city
like
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
,
I
be
always
refer
to
the
National
Transport
Authority
,
NTA
.
in
reply
to
parliamentary
question
,
the
minister
always
say
that
he
be
not
involved
in
the
day
-
to
-
day
operation
of
public
transport
,
include
the
management
of
public
bicycle
scheme
.
I
receive
that
response
to
a
question
I
put
down
in
July
.
in
reply
to
a
question
I
put
down
regard
dockless
bicycle
and
the
potential
for
roll
they
out
across
the
country
,
he
say
that
he
be
not
involved
in
the
day
-
to
-
day
delivery
of
walking
and
cycling
infrastructure
,
include
the
management
of
public
bicycle
scheme
.
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
minister
that
he
need
to
roll
up
he
sleeve
and
be
more
engage
with
the
NTA
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
sufficient
for
he
to
come
into
the
House
and
say
he
have
set
up
a
great
Dublin
area
,
gda
,
cycle
network
plan
to
deal
with
the
issue
in
Dublin
.
I
do
not
have
a
inferiority
complex
I
think
-
I
be
from
Cork
-
but
the
minister
must
look
beyond
the
Pale
,
possibly
come
outside
Dublin
,
see
what
be
go
on
regard
cycling
initiative
in
city
like
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
,
roll
up
he
sleeve
,
get
down
into
the
nitty
gritty
and
meet
and
engage
with
more
of
the
stakeholder
on
they
territory
rather
than
have
a
very
distant
and
nebulous
involvement
and
come
in
here
with
speech
that
do
not
deliver
anything
in
real
term
or
where
thing
be
push
out
to
another
time
.
I
suggest
that
the
minister
have
a
opportunity
to
leave
a
legacy
in
respect
of
cycling
policy
depend
on
the
length
of
he
mandate
.
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
there
be
a
nice
parcel
of
funding
but
we
want
to
see
that
translate
into
real
action
on
the
ground
.
the
key
to
all
of
this
be
,
and
I
say
this
as
a
occasional
cyclist
,
change
the
culture
and
mentality
in
this
country
regard
cycling
.
person
be
discourage
from
cycle
because
they
do
not
feel
it
be
safe
to
alt
onto
a
public
road
.
if
the
minister
can
be
the
advocate
,
take
leadership
and
change
the
culture
through
simple
policy
and
by
engage
with
the
local
authority
in
a
way
that
will
not
put
up
barrier
to
more
people
use
they
bike
in
they
day
-
to
-
day
life
,
he
will
have
do
a
great
day
's
work
.
in
answer
to
a
question
I
ask
about
the
Cork
city
cycling
scheme
I
be
tell
by
the
NTA
that
,
while
funding
be
available
for
capital
investment
,
financial
support
to
meet
the
operational
cost
be
more
challenging
.
the
scheme
cost
just
over
€
1
million
a
year
.
the
response
from
the
NTA
go
on
to
state
Exchequer
funding
to
meet
this
expenditure
be
not
available
to
it
and
that
local
authority
support
in
fund
the
cost
be
essential
.
the
issue
of
funding
to
meet
increase
operational
expenditure
in
a
Cork
scheme
expansion
-
for
Cork
read
Limerick
,
Galway
or
any
other
urban
conurbation
-
have
not
be
resolve
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
resolve
that
matter
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
17
January
2019
.
as
a
final
piece
of
business
,
I
thank
the
Deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
minister
.
I
also
thank
my
colleague
and
all
the
staff
of
the
House
for
all
they
work
and
effort
in
this
term
.
I
thank
the
people
in
the
Gallery
for
visit
.
I
wish
all
member
a
happy
Christmas
and
a
very
safe
new
year
.
I
,
too
,
welcome
the
motion
and
my
party
support
it
.
I
want
to
speak
briefly
on
the
report
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
.
inherent
in
it
be
some
very
valuable
recommendation
,
which
would
very
much
tally
with
the
methodology
set
out
and
the
motion
that
be
before
we
.
there
be
50
recommendation
in
the
report
and
I
will
refer
to
a
few
of
they
.
this
recommendation
be
eminently
sensible
and
predicate
on
a
wide
consultation
whereby
that
involve
in
the
report
go
out
into
the
community
.
recommendation
22
state
:
the
building
of
genuine
community
partnership
should
be
a
requirement
for
all
Garda
district
.
Gardaí
should
be
assess
for
they
performance
in
this
respect
,
and
it
should
be
a
factor
in
determine
assignment
and
promotion
.
it
also
refer
to
district
policing
plan
.
recommendation
26
refer
to
the
redeployment
of
experienced
gardaí
currently
employ
in
other
duty
.
it
state
:
job
specification
should
be
develop
for
all
position
in
the
police
service
,
clearly
indicate
the
skill
and
expertise
require
and
whether
police
power
be
necessary
for
the
job
or
not
.
if
not
,
the
presumption
should
be
that
a
non
-sworn
person
should
occupy
the
position
.
regard
the
number
of
gardaí
in
rural
Ireland
and
across
urban
Ireland
,
there
be
a
clear
view
in
the
report
that
perhaps
too
many
gardaí
be
involved
in
administrative
duty
,
some
of
necessity
,
but
that
if
there
be
scope
to
redeploy
people
to
the
front
line
,
that
should
be
accelerate
in
a
timely
fashion
.
recommendation
40
state
:
District
police
should
be
in
close
communication
with
they
community
.
a
Garda
Síochána
should
produce
regular
,
and
eventually
real
-
time
,
open
datum
feed
to
the
public
.
Public
app
should
be
develop
at
the
community
level
to
enable
resident
to
report
they
concern
,
and
police
to
disseminate
the
information
about
matter
of
interest
from
crime
prevention
to
road
closure
.
a
Garda
Síochána
should
develop
and
implement
a
new
social
media
strategy
.
in
all
district
the
police
should
use
social
media
and
other
technology
tool
to
engage
with
the
local
community
.
if
we
can
start
the
work
of
bring
to
fruition
this
recommendation
,
that
will
have
a
great
impact
.
if
we
can
deploy
this
resource
at
the
district
level
in
a
way
that
allow
the
community
to
communicate
directly
,
use
the
new
technology
that
be
available
,
with
the
gardaí
,
that
will
provide
real
-
time
information
and
that
should
give
rise
to
a
real
-
time
response
.
there
be
still
a
lag
time
in
many
district
and
the
evidence
of
that
be
clear
.
if
there
be
a
genuine
willingness
to
implement
this
recommendation
,
that
will
have
a
bear
on
some
of
the
issue
,
particularly
for
rural
area
.
Chapter
6
of
the
report
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
be
quite
stark
.
it
refer
to
the
recording
of
crime
statistic
.
it
state
:
[
I
be
be
hard
to
say
with
confidence
what
the
level
of
crime
be
.
but
we
encounter
concern
about
crime
wherever
we
travel
in
we
consultation
around
the
country
,
both
in
urban
and
rural
area
.
fear
of
crime
,
which
be
often
great
than
the
reality
of
crime
,
be
also
a
serious
matter
in
itself
,
badly
affect
quality
of
life
.
we
have
find
many
example
in
we
public
consultation
of
community
and
individual
live
with
a
unsettling
level
of
fear
of
crime
.
deputy
Ó
Caoláin
refer
to
this
issue
in
he
contribution
.
there
be
specific
recommendation
regard
great
police
visibility
,
engagement
and
accessibility
and
that
this
would
help
address
that
fear
of
crime
.
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
,
collectively
,
as
a
Oireachtas
can
work
on
that
issue
and
if
we
could
instill
confidence
in
the
community
.
deputy
Ó
Laoghaire
refer
to
this
issue
as
well
and
mention
poor
Shane
O'Farrell
whose
family
still
have
not
receive
justice
.
until
such
time
as
they
-
to
name
one
family
among
thousand
of
people
who
have
be
the
victim
of
crime
-
receive
justice
,
we
will
continue
to
have
a
lag
in
term
of
confidence
.
furthermore
,
until
such
time
as
we
accelerate
the
recommendation
and
principle
in
the
report
on
the
Future
of
Policing
in
Ireland
,
I
fear
the
lack
of
confidence
in
some
part
of
the
country
will
continue
to
be
a
issue
.
we
have
a
opportunity
to
address
that
.
we
have
the
tool
of
the
trade
to
seek
to
resolve
the
very
many
issue
bring
before
we
in
this
motion
.
we
must
ensure
the
resource
be
deploy
in
a
smart
way
to
ensure
people
,
particularly
in
rural
area
,
have
confidence
that
when
they
report
a
incident
it
be
respond
to
in
a
timely
fashion
and
that
justice
be
do
in
a
timely
fashion
.
we
must
also
ensure
he
preventative
element
of
criminality
be
such
that
if
the
resource
be
deploy
in
a
smart
way
,
employ
the
technology
,
that
we
can
do
much
to
prevent
the
crime
against
people
we
be
articulate
and
that
be
espouse
in
this
motion
.
I
,
too
,
would
like
to
raise
the
issue
of
clarity
regard
cctv
.
we
know
that
there
be
issue
regard
the
gdpr
and
whether
citizen
go
about
they
daily
business
have
certain
entitlement
to
the
right
to
privacy
.
we
need
to
overcome
that
challenge
because
there
must
be
a
balance
between
protect
we
community
,
ensure
there
be
proper
surveillance
and
ensure
the
balance
of
rights
for
individual
who
be
go
about
they
daily
business
in
a
honest
fashion
.
if
we
be
to
poll
people
throughout
the
country
,
I
believe
the
vast
majority
of
they
would
want
to
have
a
public
infrastructure
that
involve
some
degree
of
surveillance
of
sensitive
area
throughout
we
town
and
village
and
within
rural
community
.

infrastructure

some
degree
of
surveillance
of

area
throughout

town

.
we
support
the
motion
.
on
the
issue
of
bail
in
respect
of
the
criminal
Justice
Act
,
we
have
to
be
mindful
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
we
be
support
the
motion
,
of
its
constitutionality
.
to
be
fair
to
the
proposer
of
the
motion
,
they
be
seek
to
reduce
the
level
of
recidivism
and
that
should
be
support
.
in

with

Order

be
that
they
only
site
?
be
there
other
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
ask
a
legitimate
question
.
he
be
a
opposition
member
and
ask
a
question
of
the
government
.
he
be
give
a
wholly
inadequate
answer
.
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
be
here
,
too
.
I
will
not
detain
the
House
for
too
long
.
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
Bill
,
which
fulfil
a
very
simple
purpose
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
have
say
.
that
be
to
facilitate
a
person
who
be
under
the
supervision
of
the
Probation
Service
in
one
EU
member
state
but
who
live
in
another
EU
member
state
to
return
home
to
continue
he
or
she
supervision
there
.
we
will
support
the
Bill
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
outline
the
intention
of
the
Bill
very
clearly
.
it
give
effect
to
the
provision
of
the
EU
Council
Framework
decision
2008/947/jha
.
while
I
have
the
opportunity
,
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
Probation
Service
and
praise
the
work
it
do
.
it
be
very
instructive
to
look
at
the
monthly
offender
population
report
.
the
January
report
show
there
be
9850
people
who
be
guest
-
if
you
will
-
of
the
service
.
of
that
figure
,
1471
person
be
in
custody
and
8379
be
in
the
community
.
that
be
a
testament
to
how
successful
the
Probation
Service
be
.
it
be
worthwhile
for
we
to
acknowledge
the
vital
role
it
play
in
Irish
society
.
while
it
be
not
germane
to
the
Bill
I
wish
to
also
refer
to
the
social
enterprise
strategy
call
a
New
Way
Forward
.
I
understand
a
review
be
carry
out
for
2017
-
2019
.
the
whole
modus
operandi
of
the
social
enterprise
strategy
be
to
support
social
enterprise
within
the
criminal
justice
system
.
it
be
a
laudable
initiative
,
the
main
aim
of
which
be
to
ensure
there
be
not
a
rate
of
recidivism
.
there
be
20
social
enterprise
employ
people
who
have
have
conviction
,
with
46
job
create
within
social
enterprise
up
to
October
2018
.
while
it
be
not
pertinent
to
the
Bill
,
I
believe
there
be
a
clear
case
to
be
make
for
ensure
that
the
social
enterprise
strategy
continue
and
for
resource
to
be
put
into
it
to
create
more
job
for
people
who
have
a
history
of
offending
.
through
a
increase
in
educational
and
training
role
and
job
,
there
be
less
likelihood
of
reoffending
.
the
Labour
Party
would
wholeheartedly
support
any
resource
the
government
might
put
into
that
strategy
.
while
we
be
speak
about
the
prisoner
population
and
that
who
be
be
look
after
within
the
community
by
the
Probation
Service
,
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
in
provide
consular
assistance
to
that
Irish
citizen
-
and
there
be
a
few
-
who
be
serve
time
in
prison
overseas
and
especially
outside
the
European
Union
.
it
be
encouraging
to
know
that
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
take
a
very
humane
approach
,
notwithstand
some
of
the
crime
that
have
be
commit
abroad
.
the
Department
take
a
very
humane
approach
to
ensure
that
the
welfare
of
prisoner
abroad
be
maintain
insofar
as
be
practicable
,
and
it
be
worth
acknowledge
the
Department
's
role
in
that
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
and
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
bring
it
before
the
House
.
the
minister
be
here
seven
week
ago
and
state
that
ensure
the
procurement
be
bring
to
a
conclusion
in
a
fair
and
transparent
manner
be
a
priority
for
he
and
that
he
propose
to
revert
to
government
with
a
recommendation
.
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
to
indicate
,
in
definitive
term
,
the
timeline
for
the
roll
-
out
of
the
national
broadband
plan
.
perhaps
I
should
have
inquire
first
as
to
whether
it
be
the
intention
of
the
government
to
roll
out
such
a
plan
.
the
minister
state
that
he
Department
be
kick
the
tyre
on
this
.
I
imagine
,
therefore
,
that
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
be
pore
over
every
dot
,
line
and
comma
in
respect
of
the
cost
exposure
relate
to
the
national
broadband
plan
.
I
also
imagine
that
there
be
probably
serious
question
to
be
ask
about
the
potential
cost
.
I
say
all
that
on
the
basis
that
we
be
still
in
the
dark
about
the
final
cost
of
the
roll
-
out
of
the
national
broadband
plan
.
many
question
remain
.
I
have
hope
that
the
minister
might
be
a
bit
more
forthcoming
.
I
recognise
that
there
might
be
constraint
on
what
he
can
say
but
,
give
that
there
be
only
one
bidder
leave
stand
,
I
think
the
minister
might
have
be
a
bit
more
forthcoming
regard
information
flow
to
the
House
because
no
more
than
he
own
office
,
all
we
office
here
be
inundate
with
testimonial
from
people
who
have
a
significant
expectation
regard
the
provision
of
the
national
broadband
plan
and
await
a
announcement
from
government
.
base
on
the
minister
's
intervention
on
4
December
2018
,
I
be
give
to
understand
that
we
would
be
near
enough
to
a
announcement
,
particularly
at
this
time
and
allow
for
some
slippage
over
Christmas
,
but
that
have
not
happen
.
perhaps
the
minister
could
give
we
some
firm
timeline
as
to
what
the
government
's
intention
be
in
that
respect
.
we
all
have
testimonial
from
constituent
.
I
fear
for
the
people
who
will
not
be
cover
by
the
national
broadband
plan
and
who
be
not
cover
among
the
300000
but
who
be
deem
to
have
coverage
as
matter
stand
.
on
4
December
2018
,
the
minister
indicate
that
674
national
school
in
the
State
intervention
would
be
cover
by
the
national
broadband
plan
.
however
,
I
have
example
of
situation
in
place
such
as
Cobh
.
I
will
use
the
example
of
Cobh
as
a
articulation
of
other
town
in
my
constituency
.
when
people
in
Rushbrook
approach
Eir
for
coverage
for
the
school
,
they
be
inform
that
it
could
not
be
provide
even
though
Eir
be
state
that
it
be
provide
coverage
in
the
area
.
when
one
individual
approach
Open
Eir
on
foot
of
advice
from
ComReg
,
the
company
state
that
the
person
be
not
a
wholesale
customer
and
,
therefore
,
it
could
not
provide
the
person
with
high
-
speed
fibre
even
though
such
fibre
be
be
provide
in
the
area
.
I
fear
for
that
people
,
club
and
school
that
will
not
cover
by
the
national
broadband
plan
and
that
be
deem
to
be
service
currently
but
that
be
tell
by
a
provider
when
they
approach
it
that
it
cannot
provide
they
with
the
fibre
they
seek
.
what
will
become
of
they
when
the
national
broadband
plan
be
announce
?
there
be
clear
evidence
in
place
such
as
Cobh
on
great
Island
where
Eir
and
other
company
be
provide
but
be
not
provide
at
a
expectation
that
be
commensurate
with
the
time
in
which
we
live
in
view
of
the
capacity
that
exist
to
provide
x
number
of
gigabit
for
a
average
household
.
what
will
happen
to
that
people
who
,
it
could
be
argue
,
be
be
discriminate
against
because
of
that
active
market
failure
?
I
receive
a
email
from
a
individual
who
inform
I
that
when
they
ask
Eir
,
they
current
broadband
supplier
,
about
fibre
broadband
,
they
be
tell
to
talk
to
Open
Eir
,
which
will
not
talk
to
individual
because
they
be
not
wholesale
customer
.
the
person
in
question
state
that
they
have
be
previously
be
with
Sky
and
three
but
that
this
company
be
dependent
on
Open
Eir
put
down
the
fibre
broadband
and
do
not
appear
able
or
willing
to
advance
the
project
.
there
be
still
major
gap
in
the
market
.
I
be
not
sure
what
role
ComReg
be
play
in
address
the
market
failure
that
exist
throughout
the
country
regard
that
area
that
will
not
be
cover
by
the
national
broadband
plan
.
I
will
wrap
up
my
contribution
this
evening
by
ask
the
minister
if
it
be
still
the
case
that
we
might
not
have
a
national
broadband
plan
on
the
basis
of
figure
that
may
or
may
not
have
be
present
to
the
minister
-
assessment
of
cost
that
may
make
it
too
prohibitive
if
it
run
into
billion
of
euro
-
and
whether
that
be
part
of
the
minister
's
assessment
that
be
under
way
in
term
of
kick
the
tyre
on
the
proposal
before
we
.
if
a
price
be
agree
,
what
be
to
stop
Granahan
McCourt
from
come
back
and
hold
we
all
to
ransom
,
tell
we
through
the
tender
process
that
it
be
not
able
to
roll
out
the
plan
at
the
cost
it
will
agree
and
have
we
over
a
barrel
for
a
additional
payment
?
this
have
already
happen
in
this
state
with
countless
number
of
project
.
as
a
result
,
there
be
still
serious
question
to
be
answer
.
we
support
the
motion
.
I
be

my
Labour
Party
colleague
and
I
join
other
deputy
in
express
we
sympathy
to
the
family
of
that
people
who
die
on
we
road
in
the
past
week
.
on
page
43
of
the
programme
for
government
,
it
be
clearly
state
that
the
government
will
set
out
a
list
of
priority
in
respect
of
the
development
of
the
Atlantic
corridor
.
there
be
also
a
commitment
to
a
50
%
increase
in
capital
expenditure
on
road
.
in
light
of
the
recent
statement
he
make
regard
the
reprofiling
of
the
capital
expenditure
programme
and
comment
to
the
effect
that
some
project
will
be
defer
,
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
to
provide
a
assurance
that
the
M20
motorway
between
Cork
and
Limerick
will
be
develop
in
a
timely
fashion
.
in
the
interest
of
ensure
proper
regional
development
,
I
ask
he
to
give
a
concrete
commitment
that
the
M20
project
will
not
be
put
on
the
back
burner
and
that
other
project
relate
to
it
,
include
bypass
town
such
as
Mallow
,
will
not
be
forget
.
I
seek
assurance
from
the
Taoiseach
on
this
matter
.
in
accordance
with
the
Standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
31
January
2019
.
as
a
signatory
to
the
motion
,
I
support
it
.
I
will
speak
specifically
about
the
early
year
sector
and
quote
from
the
most
recent
Pobal
report
,
the
early
Year
Sector
profile
report
2017
-
2018
,
because
it
paint
a
particular
picture
of
the
state
of
the
sector
.
I
will
also
speak
specifically
for
the
worker
within
the
sector
,
in
the
first
instance
,
because
there
be
clear
issue
with
wage
and
the
high
level
of
qualification
require
,
combine
with
the
lack
of
commensurate
pay
structure
to
reflect
they
.
there
be
also
a
issue
in
retain
staff
.
I
will
quote
from
the
early
year
sector
profile
report
,
with
which
the
the
minister
,
deputy
Zappone
,
will
be
very
familiar
,
as
she
write
the
foreword
.
the
report
show
that
the
average
wage
of
a
early
year
assistant
be
€
11.20
per
hour
across
48
%
of
all
staff
within
the
sector
.
that
figure
be
70
cent
low
than
the
so
-
call
living
wage
.
the
average
rate
of
pay
for
all
staff
work
directly
with
child
be
approximately
€
12.17
per
hour
.
the
report
be
very
interesting
.
it
also
address
that
who
have
high
qualification
but
earn
low
wage
.
for
instance
,
60
%
of
that
work
directly
with
child
earn
less
than
the
living
wage
.
the
report
also
show
that
job
title
have
the
big
influence
on
wage
,
follow
by
length
of
time
in
the
sector
and
length
of
time
in
a
particular
service
.
qualification
be
the
fourth
most
important
factor
,
accounting
for
a
figure
of
10
%
when
it
come
to
exert
influence
on
how
wage
be
calculate
.
this
show
that
there
be
a
certain
degree
of
informality
in
the
sector
which
be
not
,
as
we
know
,
recognise
as
a
sector
in
its
own
right
.
there
be
disparate
wage
rate
across
it
.
the
issue
of
qualification
be
important
.
staff
in
the
sector
be
become
more
qualified
,
with
94
%
have
level
5
qualification
or
high
.
the
figure
be
92
%
in
2016
-
17
and
88
%
in
2015
-
16
.
for
level
6
qualification
,
the
figure
be
65
%
.
it
be
63
%
last
year
and
56
%
in
2015
-
16
.
we
be
see
a
gradual
rise
in
the
level
of
educational
attainment
.
despite
this
,
57
%
,
or
2,256
service
,
report
have
problem
in
find
suitably
qualified
staff
to
fill
vacancy
.
that
figure
have
increase
by
10
%
since
last
year
.
some
of
the
figure
I
be
quote
be
take
directly
from
the
report
.
the
minister
have
acknowledge
that
skilled
and
highly
qualified
staff
be
a
vital
component
of
childcare
provision
.
she
say
that
the
report
also
highlight
the
ongoing
issue
of
staff
wage
and
that
she
be
fully
aware
that
retain
qualified
staff
remain
a
concern
for
many
service
.
what
we
need
to
see
be
a
commitment
from
government
,
or
at
least
a
great
degree
of
energy
from
government
,
to
address
the
issue
of
the
retention
rate
within
the
sector
.
what
we
be
clearly
see
from
the
evidence
of
campaign
like
the
Big
start
campaign
by
SIPTU
,
for
example
,
be
that
the
rate
of
attrition
from
the
sector
be
too
high
.
there
be
no
formal
sectoral
employment
order
.
it
be
increasingly
difficult
to
organise
worker
within
the
sector
.
it
be
quite
challenging
because
of
the
disparate
nature
of
the
sector
.
I
trust
I
be
not
misquote
the
minister
on
the
matter
but
she
have
acknowledge
the
potential
impact
of
a
sectoral
employment
order
,
something
to
which
she
have
give
word
of
support
in
the
past
.
if
it
be
put
in
a
formal
setting
,
then
we
could
at
least
address
the
retention
rate
,
recognise
the
qualification
of
worker
and
prevent
the
high
rate
of
attrition
.
person
be
go
off
to
other
sector
to
become
special
need
assistant
or
teacher
or
even
emigrate
and
work
in
the
same
sector
abroad
.
that
of
we
in
the
House
need
to
recognise
the
issue
around
that
.
the
government
should
come
to
the
table
or
at
least
be
more
proactive
in
recognise
the
need
.
the
minister
be
talk
about
expand
service
.
the
minister
have
refer
to
increase
she
budget
line
year
-
on
-
year
on
a
cumulative
basis
for
this
sector
.
she
will
tell
we
how
she
budget
line
be
increase
,
I
imagine
,
when
she
be
on
she
foot
presently
.
there
be
no
point
in
increase
the
budget
line
,
although
it
be
necessary
,
if
the
rate
of
attrition
of
staff
be
increase
year
on
year
.
the
early
year
sector
profile
report
be
show
we
clear
evidence
of
that
.
we
cannot
ask
service
to
take
on
more
additionality
or
child
if
the
capability
or
capacity
be
not
there
because
of
a
lack
of
staffing
and
that
be
a
major
issue
.
I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
Big
start
campaign
.
that
of
we
across
the
political
divide
have
give
we
support
to
the
campaign
.
politically
,
everyone
in
the
House
have
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
campaign
and
the
need
to
organise
worker
across
the
sector
.
we
can
start
that
process
with
the
sectoral
employment
order
.
that
would
address
issue
like
pay
,
pension
and
sick
pay
.
it
would
build
a
strong
coherent
voice
for
the
sector
.
individual
deputy
should
not
be
come
into
the
House
,
at
this
late
stage
in
2019
,
when
we
do
not
even
have
a
formal
structure
affordable
childcare
scheme
up
and
run
.
there
should
be
no
need
for
the
worker
to
have
to
continue
to
organise
themselves
in
order
that
they
can
get
a
sectoral
employment
order
.
this
should
have
be
achieve
a
long
time
ago
.
perhaps
now
be
the
time
for
government
to
address
this
.
give
the
minister
's
commitment
or
support
for
the
idea
of
the
worker
be
organised
,
perhaps
she
could
intervene
to
try
to
influence
matter
by
be
as
proactive
as
she
possibly
can
.
I
put
down
a
question
for
the
minister
on
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
last
year
.
I
want
to
know
when
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
would
be
formally
up
and
run
.
a
announcement
be
make
in
budget
2019
.
yet
,
if
I
be
interpret
the
minister
correctly
we
will
not
see
the
roll
-
out
of
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
until
the
end
of
this
year
.
by
any
rational
analysis
,
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
it
may
not
actually
take
place
until
2020
.
I
ask
the
minister

run
or
put
in
place
.
she
reply
that
work
be
currently
ongoing
on
the
secondary
legislation
and
the
formal
policy
guideline
.
she
say
work
be
currently
ongoing
on
the
development
of
the
regulation
and
that
the
regulation
would
be
introduce
in
advance
of
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
to
allow
school
-
age
childcare
service
to
register
and
thereby
participate
in
the
scheme
from
its
inception
.
the
minister
go
on
to
say
that
the
scheme
's
information
and
communication
technology
system
have
conclude
the
full
public
procurement
process
and
that
the

she
say

,
administrative
and

element
of

.
she
continue
:
consultation
and
engagement
with
stakeholder
be
ongoing
and
,
in
the

,
a

campaign
will

other
key

finally
,
budget
2019
provide

to
the

which
will
ensure
that
a
even
great
number
of
family
will
now
benefit
from
the
scheme
once
launch
.
in
the
few
second
remain
to
I
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
the
minister
of
where
the
architecture
of
the
affordable
childcare
scheme
be
at
this
point
.
that
be
one
of
the
key
question
we
have
on
this
side
of
the
House
.
I
also
want
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
recent
Pobal
and
ESRI
report
on
the
link
between
the
cost
of
childcare
and
the
fact
that
there
be
low
rate
of
access
to
childcare
among
that
who
be
lone
parent
.
the
issue
be
one
this
society
need
to
deal
with
and
I
hope
the
minister
will
respond
to
that
.
thank
you
for
you

Cheann
Comhairle

Seanad
Éireann
have
pass
the
Hallmarking
(
amendment
)
Bill
2016
,
without
amendment
.
I
be
delighted
the
minister
,
deputy
Creed
,
be
in
the
House
to
reply
to
the
query
.
Haulbowline
Island
,
as
we
know
,
have
be
the
subject
of
remediation
work
since
2011
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
be
the
current
owner
of
the
site
,
which
be
the
former
Ispat
or
Irish
Steel
site
.
we
know
the
East
tip
of
the
island
have
be
significantly
remediate
in
the
last
year
or
so
and
there
be
great
praise
for
the
work
that
have
be
do
in
respect
of
the
football
pitch
and
the
East
tip
itself
be
complete
,
with
proper
seeding
and
shrubbery
be
plant
,
and
so
on
.
however
,
there
be
a
question
mark
over
the
remainder
of
the
site
.
my
understanding
be
that
three
site
be
to
be
remediate
.
the
East
tip
be
arguably
all
but
complete
and
there
have
be
much
progress
on
that
.
I
be
here
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
status
of
the
remainder
of
the
work
and
when
they
will
be
complete
.
there
be
massive
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
reside
in
that
area
,
particularly
the
people
of
great
Island
and
Cobh
.
we
know
Spike
Island
have
become
a
global
tourist
attraction
and
there
be
a
high
expectation
that
Haulbowline
would
be
complete
and
remediate
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
not
respond
by
say
the
ownership
of
the
site
be
to
transfer
to
the
Department
of
Defence
and
it
then
will
take
ownership
of
the
issue
.
as
far
as
the
people
of
great
Island
be
concerned
,
this
be
a
whole
-
of
-
government
issue
which
should
be
respond
to
by
everybody
across
government
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
not
be
a
turf
war
between
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
and
the
Department
of
Defence
in
respect
of
the
remainder
of
the
work
that
need
to
be
do
.
in
fairness
to
the
minister
,
he
have
take
ownership
of
this
issue
thus
far
.
he
state
the
remediation
work
would
intensify
between
July
2017
and
late
2018
,
which
have
prove
to
be
the
case
,
as
I
acknowledge
.
I
be
hopeful
the
government
will
take
a
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
to
this
issue
.
I
would
specifically
like
to
know
if
there
be
a
funding
line
available
and
earmark
for
the
remainder
of
the
work
to
be
carry
out
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
explain
the
exact
position
in
respect
of
the
site
because
the
expectation
be
high
in
the
area
that
the
remediation
work
will
be
complete
.
I
accept
the
minister
's
response
.
while
I
have
the
great
respect
for
he
,
I
believe
what
we
be
see
be
a
transfer
of
authority
from
the
minister
to
the
Department
of
Defence
,
although
it
have
not
happen
yet
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
,
as
far
as
the
people
of
the
great
Island
and
Cobh
and
the
surround
area
be
concerned
,
this
be
a
whole
-
of
-
government
responsibility
and
they
do
not
necessarily
see
into
the
internal
working
of
the
various
silo
within
government
and
between
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
and
the
Department
of
Defence
.
some
€
61
million
be
originally
allocate
for
this
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
government
and
my
understanding
be
that
only
€
23
million
have
be
spend
so
far
.
we
acknowledge
the
work
do
thus
far
but
there
be
more
to
be
do
,
for
example
,
a
significant
amount
of
site
remediation
work
.
I
have
not
have
a
clear
answer
from
government
in
respect
of
when
that
will
happen
.
we
know
the
recreational
park
will
open
some
time
in
2019
and
that
will
add
significantly
to
the
public
use
value
of
the
site
,
which
be
a
positive
public
good
.
however
,
we
need
to
hear
from
the
government
specific
answer
to
specific
question
as
to
whether
the
remainder
of
the
fund
will
be
make
available
to
do
the
work
at
the
South
tip
and
at
the
former
steel
plant
itself
.
to
my
mind
,
the
minister
have
not
respond
satisfactorily
in
that
respect
.
I
ask
the
government
to
revisit
the
issue
and
give
we
a
clear
picture
of
what
the
likely
outcome
will
be
,
give
there
be
a
ring
-
fence
allocation
of
approximately
€
60
million
in
funding
and
that
have
not
be
spend
.
be
we
now
give
to
understand
this
have
be
shelve
in
favour
of
other
priority
in
the
capital
programme
?
it
be
a
important
issue
.
the
Labour
Party
unambiguously
welcome
the
Bill
and
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
Minister
and
the
Minister
of
State
in
bring
it
before
the
House
.
the
Bill
be
clear
in
what
it
seek
to
achieve
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
and
congratulate
Ms
Liane
Reddy
,
the
parliamentary
researcher
who
compile
the
Bill
digest
and
raise
some
very
interesting
point
in
the
process
.
I
note
that
the
United
Kingdom
be
one
of
the
signatory
to
the
Istanbul
Convention
.
in
the
context
of
Brexit
negotiation
,
have
there
be
any
discussion
within
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
on
how
Brexit
may
impact
on
the
interpretation
of
this
legislation
vis-à
-
vo
we
relationship
with
the
Unite
Kingdom
give
the
close
tie
that
exist
between
the
two
country
?
it
be
a
very
theoretical
question
at
this
stage
.
it
may
be
that
because
the
United
Kingdom
be
a
signatory
to
the
convention
which
have
a
certain
date
stamp
,
Brexit
will
have
no
implication
in
that
regard
.
it
would
be
very
useful
to
have
that
clarify
.
Cosc
,
the
national
office
for
the
prevention
of
domestic
,
sexual
and
gender
-
base
violence
,
state
that
a
government
action
plan
to
give
voice
to
the
Istanbul
Convention
be
in
place
and
relate
to
issue
such
as
education
and
training
module
for
a
Garda
Síochána
,
the
HSE
,
Tusla
and
the
Court
Service
.
be
the
Minister
of
State
satisfied
that
adequate
ongoing
training
and
education
be
in
place
?
have
a
Garda
Síochána
implement
what
Cosc
describe
as
the
risk
assessment
matrix
?
I
do
not
fully
understand
what
constitute
a
risk
assessment
matrix
.
it
would
be
useful
for
that
to
be
explain
and
to
clarify
whether
it
be
ongoing
.
be
there
a
integrate
24
-
hour
national
helpline
to
respond
to
the
issue
pertinent
to
the
legislation
?
Cosc
also
raise
the
issue
of
support
for
child
witness
of
domestic
or
sexual
violence
.
be
the
minister
satisfied
that
programme
,
protocol
or
procedure
be
in
place
in
respect
of
that
issue
?
my
party
very
much
welcome
the
Bill
.
I
again
refer
to
the
Bills
digest
,
which
be
very
useful
in
gain
a
good
understanding
of
the
dynamic
of
the
legislation
.
in
respect
of
the
principle
of
extra-territorial
jurisdiction
it
state
:
however
,
there
be
a
"
grow
list
of
situation
in
which
offence
commit
outside
Irish
territory
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
Irish
court
.
"
this
be
largely
due
to
the
effect
of
globalisation
,
and
a
acceptance
by
the
international
community
''
that
it
have
a
common
obligation
to
tackle
certain
form
of
criminal
enterprise
that
threaten
fundamental
interest
transcend
national
boundary
.
''
as
Ireland
assume
obligation
under
a
increase
number
of
international
agreement
,
the
extent
to
which
Irish
citizen
and
that
ordinarily
resident
in
Ireland
may
be
prosecute
for
act
do
outside
the
State
have
also
increase
.
it
then
refer
to
section
of
act
such
as
the
domestic
Violence
Act
2018
and
the
criminal
Justice
(
Corruption
Offences
)
act
2018
,
and
to
section
4
of
the
criminal
Justice
(
female
Genital
Mutilation
Act
)
2012
.
the
digest
also
address
the
issue
of
Irish
-
register
ship
or
aircraft
,
state
:
the
fact
that
a
ship
or
aircraft
be
register
in
Ireland
do
not
automatically
mean
that
it
be
Irish
territory
for
the
purpose
of
criminal
jurisdiction
once
it
leave
Irish
territorial
water
or
airspace
.
however
certain
statutory
provision
confer
that
jurisdiction
on
they
where
certain
criminal
offence
be
commit
on
board
,
irrespective
of
the
nationality
of
the
offender
.
what
be
the
perspective
of
he
Department
on
that
dynamic
?
be
this
legislation
pertinent
to
such
scenario
?
the
Labour
Party
fully
support
the
Bill
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
be
not
make
a
political
point
.
rather
,
I
be
merely
ask
a
question
,
the
answer
to
which
I
have
anticipate
.
for
the
record
,
I
ask
the
question
in
good
faith
and
with
good
intention
.
I
thank
all
contributor
to
this
evening
's
debate
.
I
note
the
support
from
all
side
of
the
House
,
bar
the
government
side
,
which
have
decide
to
abstain
.
I
will
address
some
of
the
point
make
by
the
only
two
government
Member
who
speak
,
namely
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
D'Arcy
and
Kehoe
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
D'Arcy
,
state
there
be
a
"
well
establish
framework
of
accountability
,
responsibility
and
control
in
operation
at
each
level
.
"
that
be
a
unfortunate
statement
to
make
today
of
all
day
.
we
be
bring
forward
amend
legislation
on
the
role
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
who
,
as
I
state
,
have
independent
expertise
at
he
disposal
which
can
help
and
assist
the
government
at
no
extra
cost
,
despite
the
contention
make
by
government
speaker
.
the
government
argue
that
the
Bill
do
not
appear
to
provide
any
additional
power
for
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
,
while
also
contend
that
there
may
be
a
cost
to
the
Exchequer
if
it
be
enact
.
that
be
a
contradiction
.
it
indicate
to
I
in
no
uncertain
term
that
the
government
have
interpret
and
consider
the
Bill
in
a
flippant
manner
and
have
not
go
into
any
great
detail
in
offer
a
view
contrary
to
the
view
express
by
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
and
other
Opposition
Deputy
in
this
debate
.
I
acknowledge
Sinn
Féin
's
recognition
of
we
intention
and
the
basis
on
which
we
have
propose
the
Bill
.
in
do
so
,
it
also
agree
with
the
Bill
,
as
do
other
speaker
.
we
want
to
increase
accountability
and
transparency
across
government
.
government
speaker
also
say
that
for
a
minister
to
instruct
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
to
intervene
and
analyse
and
scrutinise
a
capital
development
project
and
the
cost
associate
with
it
where
they
exceed
the
initially
envisage
cost
would
in
some
way
be
interfere
with
the
independence
of
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
.
I
find
that
very
hard
to
comprehend
,
especially
in
the
week
and
day
that
be
in
it
.
I
would
be
more
impressed
if
it
be
the
intention
of
government
to
reflect
on
this
Bill
,
especially
if
it
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
,
and
improve
it
,
especially
at
it
be
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
one
's
face
that
the
State
have
at
its
disposal
machinery
that
would
allow
for
a
independent
assessment
of
capital
project
.
it
should
not
leave
we
in
the
current
predicament
where
we
have
abysmal
mismanagement
of
the
new
child
's
hospital
and
we
be
flounder
as
we
seek
to
find
out
what
impact
this
will
have
on
other
project
.
it
be
not
yet
clear
from
what
I
have
hear
from
the
minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
what
cutback
will
take
place
as
a
result
of
this
.
for
example
,
on
the
A5
road
project
,
he
state
that
,
even
allow
for
the
problem
and
difficulty
with
the
Northern
Ireland
Assembly
unfortunately
not
be
in
place
,
it
may
be
the
end
of
this
year
before
the
€
27
million
in
funding
can
be
draw
down
.
it
will
not
be
a
cut
from
this
year
's
Exchequer
allocation
if
it
come
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
in
the
event
that
the
government
be
not
forthcoming
with
information
,
the
Dáil
,
especially
this
side
of
the
House
,
will
insist
that
the
government
provide
member
of
this
House
and
,
by
association
,
they
constituent
with
detail
of
what
project
and
community
will
be
at
a
loss
in
respect
of
the
initial
commitment
give
by
the
government
when
its
member
travel
the
country
with
a
series
of
roadshow
.
it
be
now
unable
to
have
one
roadshow
to
tell
we
exactly
where
we
stand
.
it
be
not
only
the
funding
of
project
this
year
that
we
be
worried
about
because
it
be
not
as
if
the
government
can
move
this
expenditure
from
one
year
to
another
and
the
sum
involve
will
end
up
supposedly
be
only
€
100
million
.
the
government
make
commitment
to
the
tune
of
almost
€
500
million
that
will
now
have
to
be
reprofile
,
as
the
Taoiseach
say
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
commitment
the
same
Taoiseach
give
to
we
and
,
more
importantly
,
to
the
nation
when
he
speak
on
national
radio
last
Sunday
week
.
he
say
that
within
ten
day
everybody
would
be
aware
of
the
implication
of
the
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
capital
development
programme
.
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
which
appear
to
have
be
more
forthcoming
than
other
at
this
stage
,
say
that
€3
million
will
come
from
the
flood
relief
scheme
.
as
a
representative
who
be
probably
affect
by
that
,
I
will
insist
on
know
what
scheme
and
project
in
the
flood
relief
scheme
will
be
affect
and
will
not
go
ahead
despite
the
commitment
give
by
the
government
last
year
and
previously
regard
the
funding
that
be
to
be
provide
in
that
regard
.
that
will
play
out
in
the
come
day
,
as
it
should
.
it
would
be
expect
of
we
to
extract
that
from
the
government
.
as
I
say
,
one
of
the
main
lesson
from
how
the
government
respond
to
this
fiasco
and
the
colossal
overspend
be
that
it
immediately
rush
to
the
private
sector
to
get
it
to
carry
out
a
analysis
and
relevant
scrutiny
.
there
be
many
other
demand
project
in
the
offing
,
as
other
member
have
mention
,
not
the
least
of
which
be
the
broadband
programme
.
many
billion
will
be
expend
on
that
and
there
be
great
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
public
that
it
will
ensure
broadband
be
available
to
every
house
.
if
it
be
available
at
a
cost
,
we
need
to
know
it
and
to
know
that
there
be
process
in
place
to
ensure
the
taxpayer
's
interest
be
protect
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
there
be
a
indication
of
a
overrun
at
a
certain
point
,
this
legislation
would
allow
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
office
to
use
its
expertise
to
analyse
and
scrutinise
that
to
see
how
such
a
cost
overrun
could
be
arrest
.
another
aspect
of
the
national
child
's
hospital
debacle
be
that
it
appear
the
initial
contract
provide
for
a
cost
of
construction
inflation
of
at
least
4
%
year
on
year
.
that
do
not
stop
it
go
to
8
%
if
that
be
what
present
,
which
be
what
happen
.
as
deputy
Fleming
say
,
the
initial
rush
to
get
on
site
on
the
part
of
that
with
responsibility
in
this
area
be
purely
to
meet
they
aspiration
for
political
advancement
,
at
the
fault
of
not
have
proper
and
adequate
process
to
ensure
that
any
subsequent
contract
could
be
tight
,
protect
the
interest
of
taxpayer
,
ensure
they
fund
be
spend
wisely
and
appropriately
,
and
deliver
on
the
commitment
that
be
make
initially
.
we
be
all
interested
in
this
,
and
many
previous
government
have
be
drive
by
the
desire
to
put
that
facility
in
place
and
to
ensure
child
be
afford
the
good
possible
care
,
attention
and
service
from
the
State
from
a
health
perspective
.
that
be
not
diminish
in
any
way
by
we
commentary
.
we
merely
make
it
in
the
good
interest
of
ensure
that
other
project
that
be
commit
to
can
be
deliver
,
be
they
in
Waterford
,
my
constituency
or
elsewhere
.
Real
commitment
be
make
by
the
government
,
which
have
taxpayer
's
fund
at
its
disposal
and
which
should
not
use
thrift
with
that
spending
or
responsibility
for
its
political
gain
.
that
be
all
we
wish
to
ensure
.
we
be
not
interested
in
head
or
in
play
political
game
.
as
we
all
know
,
there
be
big
picture
at
play
.
we
cannot
stand
idly
by
in
this
jurisdiction
when
chaos
reign
in
Westminster
and
,
unfortunately
,
in
the
North
.
the
good
Friday
agreement
and
its
content
be
hard
fight
for
and
hard
win
but
,
thankfully
,
be
deliver
to
give
the
potential
for
the
type
of
democracy
in
the
North
that
there
be
in
other
jurisdiction
.
however
,
we
colleague
in
Sinn
Féin
be
part
of
a
unfortunate
world
record
at
this
stage
in
respect
of
not
take
they
seat
.
it
be
a
disease
they
cannot
seem
to
rid
themselves
of
,
and
that
be
unfortunate
as
it
be
not
just
at
they
expense
but
at
the
expense
of
all
of
we
.
it
be
at
the
expense
of
this
island
's
prosperity
and
its
potential
to
succeed
economically
and
socially
.
more
importantly
,
from
we
perspective
the
good
Friday
agreement
have
the
potential
to
protect
we
security
,
and
that
be
paramount
.
we
will
not
use
this
unfortunate
mismanagement
and
almost
misappropriation
of
fund
for
political
gain
.
we
think
too
much
of
that
who
give
we
the
privilege
to
be
here
to
do
that
.
that
continue
to
be
the
raison
d'être
for
we
.
we
be
commit
to
this
country
be
unite
in
its
effort
to
respond
to
that
challenge
.
obviously
,
a
unite
government
and
unite
Dáil
be
essential
to
ensure
the
people
can
rest
assure
that
the
commitment
be
real
and
meaningful
.
I
thank
all
contributor
to
this
evening
's
debate
.
I
note
the
support
from
all
side
of
the
House
,
bar
the
government
side
,
which
have
decide
to
abstain
.
I
will
address
some
of
the
point
make
by
the
only
two
government
Member
who
speak
,
namely
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
D'Arcy
and
Kehoe
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
D'Arcy
,
state
there
be
a
"
well
establish
framework
of
accountability
,
responsibility
and
control
in
operation
at
each
level
.
"
that
be
a
unfortunate
statement
to
make
today
of
all
day
.
we
be
bring
forward
amend
legislation
on
the
role
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
who
,
as
I
state
,
have
independent
expertise
at
he
disposal
which
can
help
and
assist
the
government
at
no
extra
cost
,
despite
the
contention
make
by
government
speaker
.
the
government
argue
that
the
Bill
do
not
appear
to
provide
any
additional
power
for
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
,
while
also
contend
that
there
may
be
a
cost
to
the
Exchequer
if
it
be
enact
.
that
be
a
contradiction
.
it
indicate
to
I
in
no
uncertain
term
that
the
government
have
interpret
and
consider
the
Bill
in
a
flippant
manner
and
have
not
go
into
any
great
detail
in
offer
a
view
contrary
to
the
view
express
by
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
and
other
Opposition
Deputy
in
this
debate
.
I
acknowledge
Sinn
Féin
's
recognition
of
we
intention
and
the
basis
on
which
we
have
propose
the
Bill
.
in
do
so
,
it
also
agree
with
the
Bill
,
as
do
other
speaker
.
we
want
to
increase
accountability
and
transparency
across
government
.
government
speaker
also
say
that
for
a
minister
to
instruct
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
to
intervene
and
analyse
and
scrutinise
a
capital
development
project
and
the
cost
associate
with
it
where
they
exceed
the
initially
envisage
cost
would
in
some
way
be
interfere
with
the
independence
of
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
.
I
find
that
very
hard
to
comprehend
,
especially
in
the
week
and
day
that
be
in
it
.
I
would
be
more
impressed
if
it
be
the
intention
of
government
to
reflect
on
this
Bill
,
especially
if
it
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
,
and
improve
it
,
especially
at
it
be
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
one
's
face
that
the
State
have
at
its
disposal
machinery
that
would
allow
for
a
independent
assessment
of
capital
project
.
it
should
not
leave
we
in
the
current
predicament
where
we
have
abysmal
mismanagement
of
the
new
child
's
hospital
and
we
be
flounder
as
we
seek
to
find
out
what
impact
this
will
have
on
other
project
.
it
be
not
yet
clear
from
what
I
have
hear
from
the
minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
what
cutback
will
take
place
as
a
result
of
this
.
for
example
,
on
the
A5
road
project
,
he
state
that
,
even
allow
for
the
problem
and
difficulty
with
the
Northern
Ireland
Assembly
unfortunately
not
be
in
place
,
it
may
be
the
end
of
this
year
before
the
€
27
million
in
funding
can
be
draw
down
.
it
will
not
be
a
cut
from
this
year
's
Exchequer
allocation
if
it
come
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
in
the
event
that
the
government
be
not
forthcoming
with
information
,
the
Dáil
,
especially
this
side
of
the
House
,
will
insist
that
the
government
provide
member
of
this
House
and
,
by
association
,
they
constituent
with
detail
of
what
project
and
community
will
be
at
a
loss
in
respect
of
the
initial
commitment
give
by
the
government
when
its
member
travel
the
country
with
a
series
of
roadshow
.
it
be
now
unable
to
have
one
roadshow
to
tell
we
exactly
where
we
stand
.
it
be
not
only
the
funding
of
project
this
year
that
we
be
worried
about
because
it
be
not
as
if
the
government
can
move
this
expenditure
from
one
year
to
another
and
the
sum
involve
will
end
up
supposedly
be
only
€
100
million
.
the
government
make
commitment
to
the
tune
of
almost
€
500
million
that
will
now
have
to
be
reprofile
,
as
the
Taoiseach
say
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
commitment
the
same
Taoiseach
give
to
we
and
,
more
importantly
,
to
the
nation
when
he
speak
on
national
radio
last
Sunday
week
.
he
say
that
within
ten
day
everybody
would
be
aware
of
the
implication
of
the
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
capital
development
programme
.
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
which
appear
to
have
be
more
forthcoming
than
other
at
this
stage
,
say
that
€3
million
will
come
from
the
flood
relief
scheme
.
as
a
representative
who
be
probably
affect
by
that
,
I
will
insist
on
know
what
scheme
and
project
in
the
flood
relief
scheme
will
be
affect
and
will
not
go
ahead
despite
the
commitment
give
by
the
government
last
year
and
previously
regard
the
funding
that
be
to
be
provide
in
that
regard
.
that
will
play
out
in
the
come
day
,
as
it
should
.
it
would
be
expect
of
we
to
extract
that
from
the
government
.
as
I
say
,
one
of
the
main
lesson
from
how
the
government
respond
to
this
fiasco
and
the
colossal
overspend
be
that
it
immediately
rush
to
the
private
sector
to
get
it
to
carry
out
a
analysis
and
relevant
scrutiny
.
there
be
many
other
demand
project
in
the
offing
,
as
other
member
have
mention
,
not
the
least
of
which
be
the
broadband
programme
.
many
billion
will
be
expend
on
that
and
there
be
great
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
public
that
it
will
ensure
broadband
be
available
to
every
house
.
if
it
be
available
at
a
cost
,
we
need
to
know
it
and
to
know
that
there
be
process
in
place
to
ensure
the
taxpayer
's
interest
be
protect
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
there
be
a
indication
of
a
overrun
at
a
certain
point
,
this
legislation
would
allow
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
office
to
use
its
expertise
to
analyse
and
scrutinise
that
to
see
how
such
a
cost
overrun
could
be
arrest
.
another
aspect
of
the
national
child
's
hospital
debacle
be
that
it
appear
the
initial
contract
provide
for
a
cost
of
construction
inflation
of
at
least
4
%
year
on
year
.
that
do
not
stop
it
go
to
8
%
if
that
be
what
present
,
which
be
what
happen
.
as
deputy
Fleming
say
,
the
initial

to

any
subsequent

could
be
tight
,
protect
the
interest
of
taxpayer
,
ensure
they
fund
be
spend
wisely
and
appropriately
,
and
deliver
on
the
commitment
that
be
make
initially
.
we
be
all
interested
in
this
,
and
many
previous
government
have
be
drive
by
the
desire
to
put
that
facility
in
place
and
to
ensure
child
be
afford
the
good
possible
care
,

and
service
from
the
State
from
a
health
perspective
.
that
be
not
diminish
in
any
way
by
we
commentary
.
we
merely
make
it
in
the
good
interest
of
ensure
that
other
project
that
be
commit
to
can
be
deliver
,
be
they
in
Waterford
,
my
constituency
or
elsewhere
.
Real
commitment
be
make
by
the
government
,
which
have
taxpayer
's
fund
at
its
disposal
and
which
should
not
use
thrift
with
that
spending
or
responsibility
for
its

.
that
be
all
we
wish
to
ensure
.
we
be
not

or
in

game
.
as
we
all

,
there
be
big
picture
at

to

in
the
week
and
day
that
be
in
it
.
I
would
be
more
impressed
if
it
be
the
intention
of
government
to
reflect
on
this
Bill
,
especially
if
it
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
,
and
improve
it
,
especially
at
it
be
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
one
's
face
that
the
State
have
at
its
disposal
machinery
that
would
allow
for
a
independent
assessment
of
capital
project
.
it
should
not
leave
we
in
the
current
predicament
where
we
have
abysmal
mismanagement
of
the
new
child
's
hospital
and
we
be
flounder
as
we
seek
to
find
out
what
impact
this
will
have
on
other
project
.
it
be
not
yet
clear
from
what
I
have
hear
from
the
minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
what
cutback
will
take
place
as
a
result
of
this
.
for
example
,
on
the
A5
road
project
,
he
state
that
,
even
allow
for
the
problem
and
difficulty
with
the
Northern
Ireland
Assembly
unfortunately
not
be
in
place
,
it
may
be
the
end
of
this
year
before
the
€
27
million
in
funding
can
be
draw
down
.
it
will
not
be
a
cut
from
this
year
's
Exchequer
allocation
if
it
come
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
in
the
event
that
the
government
be
not
forthcoming
with
information
,
the
Dáil
,
especially
this
side
of
the
House
,
will
insist
that
the
government
provide
member
of
this
House
and
,
by
association
,
they
constituent
with
detail
of
what
project
and
community
will
be
at
a
loss
in
respect
of
the
initial
commitment
give
by
the
government
when
its
member
travel
the
country
with
a
series
of
roadshow
.
it
be
now
unable
to
have
one
roadshow
to
tell
we
exactly
where
we
stand
.
it
be
not
only
the
funding
of
project
this
year
that
we
be
worried
about
because
it
be
not
as
if
the
government
can
move
this
expenditure
from
one
year
to
another
and
the
sum
involve
will
end
up
supposedly
be
only
€
100
million
.
the
government
make
commitment
to
the
tune
of
almost
€
500
million
that
will
now
have
to
be
reprofile
,
as
the
Taoiseach
say
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
commitment
the
same
Taoiseach
give
to
we
and
,
more
importantly
,
to
the
nation
when
he
speak
on
national
radio
last
Sunday
week
.
he
say
that
within
ten
day
everybody
would
be
aware
of
the
implication
of
the
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
capital
development
programme
.
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
which
appear
to
have
be
more
forthcoming
than
other
at
this
stage
,
say
that
€3
million
will
come
from
the
flood
relief
scheme
.
as
a
representative
who
be
probably
affect
by
that
,
I
will
insist
on
know
what
scheme
and
project
in
the
flood
relief
scheme
will
be
affect
and
will
not
go
ahead
despite
the
commitment
give
by
the
government
last
year
and
previously
regard
the
funding
that
be
to
be
provide
in
that
regard
.
that
will
play
out
in
the
come
day
,
as
it
should
.
it
would
be
expect
of
we
to
extract
that
from
the
government
.
as
I
say
,
one
of
the
main
lesson
from
how
the
government
respond
to
this
fiasco
and
the
colossal
overspend
be
that
it
immediately
rush
to
the
private
sector
to
get
it
to
carry
out
a
analysis
and
relevant
scrutiny
.
there
be
many
other
demand
project
in
the
offing
,
as
other
member
have
mention
,
not
the
least
of
which
be
the
broadband
programme
.
many
billion
will
be
expend
on
that
and
there
be
great
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
public
that
it
will
ensure
broadband
be
available
to
every
house
.
if
it
be
available
at
a
cost
,
we
need
to
know
it
and
to
know
that
there
be
process
in
place
to
ensure
the
taxpayer
's
interest
be
protect
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
there
be
a
indication
of
a
overrun
at
a
certain
point
,
this
legislation
would
allow
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
office
to
use
its
expertise
to
analyse
and
scrutinise
that
to
see
how
such
a
cost
overrun
could
be
arrest
.
another
aspect
of
the
national
child
's
hospital
debacle
be
that
it
appear
the
initial
contract
provide
for
a
cost
of
construction
inflation
of
at
least
4
%
year
on
year
.
that
do
not
stop
it
go
to
8
%
if
that
be
what
present
,
which
be
what
happen
.
as
deputy
Fleming
say
,
the
initial
rush
to
get
on
site
on
the
part
of
that
with
responsibility
in
this
area
be
purely
to
meet
they
aspiration
for
political
advancement
,
at
the
fault
of
not
have
proper
and
adequate
process
to
ensure
that
any
subsequent
contract
could
be
tight
,
protect
the
interest
of
taxpayer
,
ensure
they
fund
be
spend
wisely
and
appropriately
,
and
deliver
on
the
commitment
that
be
make
initially
.
we
be
all
interested
in
this
,
and
many
previous
government
have
be
drive
by
the
desire
to
put
that
facility
in
place
and
to
ensure
child
be
afford
the
good
possible
care
,
attention
and
service
from
the
State
from
a
health
perspective
.
that
be
not
diminish
in
any
way
by
we
commentary
.
we
merely
make
it
in
the
good
interest
of
ensure
that
other
project
that
be
commit
to
can
be
deliver
,
be
they
in
Waterford
,
my
constituency
or
elsewhere
.
Real
commitment
be
make
by
the
government
,
which
have
taxpayer
's
fund
at
its
disposal
and
which
should
not
use
thrift
with
that
spending
or
responsibility
for
its
political
gain
.
that
be
all
we
wish
to
ensure
.
we
be
not
interested
in
head
or
in
play
political
game
.
as
we
all
know
,
there
be
big
picture
at
play
.
we
cannot
stand
idly
by
in
this
jurisdiction
when
chaos
reign
in
Westminster
and
,
unfortunately
,
in
the
North
.
the
good
Friday
agreement
and
its
content
be
hard
fight
for
and
hard
win
but
,
thankfully
,
be
deliver
to
give
the
potential
for
the
type
of
democracy
in
the
North
that
there
be
in
other
jurisdiction
.
however
,
we
colleague
in
Sinn
Féin
be
part
of
a
unfortunate
world
record
at
this
stage
in
respect
of
not
take
they
seat
.
it
be
a
disease
they
cannot
seem
to
rid
themselves
of
,
and
that
be
unfortunate
as
it
be
not
just
at
they
expense
but
at
the
expense
of
all
of
we
.
it
be
at
the
expense
of
this
island
's
prosperity
and
its
potential
to
succeed
economically
and
socially
.
more
importantly
,
from
we
perspective
the
good
Friday
agreement
have
the
potential
to
protect
we
security
,
and
that
be
paramount
.
we
will
not
use
this
unfortunate
mismanagement
and
almost
misappropriation
of
fund
for
political
gain
.
we
think
too
much
of
that
who
give
we
the
privilege
to
be
here
to
do
that
.
that
continue
to
be
the
raison
d'être
for
we
.
we
be
commit
to
this
country
be
unite
in
its
effort
to
respond
to
that
challenge
.
obviously
,
a
unite
government
and
unite
Dáil
be
essential
to
ensure
the
people
can
rest
assure
that
the
commitment
be
real
and
meaningful
.
I
thank
all
contributor
to
this
evening
's
debate
.
I
note
the
support
from
all
side
of
the
House
,
bar
the
government
side
,
which
have
decide
to
abstain
.
I
will
address
some
of
the
point
make
by
the
only
two
government
Member
who
speak
,
namely
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
D'Arcy
and
Kehoe
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
D'Arcy
,
state
there
be
a
"
well
establish
framework
of
accountability
,
responsibility
and
control
in
operation
at
each
level
.
"
that
be
a
unfortunate
statement
to
make
today
of
all
day
.
we
be
bring
forward
amend
legislation
on
the
role
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
who
,
as
I
state
,
have
independent
expertise
at
he
disposal
which
can
help
and
assist
the
government
at
no
extra
cost
,
despite
the
contention
make
by
government
speaker
.
the
government
argue
that
the
Bill
do
not
appear
to
provide
any
additional
power
for
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
,
while
also
contend
that
there
may
be
a
cost
to
the
Exchequer
if
it
be
enact
.
that
be
a
contradiction
.
it
indicate
to
I
in
no
uncertain
term
that
the
government
have
interpret
and
consider
the
Bill
in
a
flippant
manner
and
have
not
go
into
any
great
detail
in
offer
a
view
contrary
to
the
view
express
by
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
and
other
Opposition
Deputy
in
this
debate
.
I
acknowledge
Sinn
Féin
's
recognition
of
we
intention
and
the
basis
on
which
we
have
propose
the
Bill
.
in
do
so
,
it
also
agree
with
the
Bill
,
as
do
other
speaker
.
we
want
to
increase
accountability
and
transparency
across
government
.
government
speaker
also
say
that
for
a
minister
to
instruct
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
to
intervene
and
analyse
and
scrutinise
a
capital
development
project
and
the
cost
associate
with
it
where
they
exceed
the
initially
envisage
cost
would
in
some
way
be
interfere
with
the
independence
of
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
.
I
find
that
very
hard
to
comprehend
,
especially
in
the
week
and
day
that
be
in
it
.
I
would
be
more
impressed
if
it
be
the
intention
of
government
to
reflect
on
this
Bill
,
especially
if
it
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
,
and
improve
it
,
especially
at
it
be
as
plain
as
the

on

that
the

.
it

for
Public

and
Reform
what

this
.
for
example
,
on
the
A5
road
project
,
he
state
that
,
even
allow
for
the
problem
and
difficulty
with
the
Northern
Ireland
Assembly
unfortunately
not
be
in

,
it
may
be
the
end
of
this
year
before
the
€
27

can
be
draw
down
.
it
will
not
be
a
cut
from
this
year
's
Exchequer
allocation
if
it
come
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
in
the
event
that
the
government
be
not
forthcoming
with
information
,
the
Dáil
,
especially
this
side
of
the
House
,
will
insist
that
the
government
provide
member
of
this
House
and
,
by
association
,
they
constituent
with
detail
of
what
project
and
community
will
be
at
a

in

of
the

exactly
where

it
be
not
only
the
funding
of
project
this
year
that
we
be
worried
about
because
it
be
not
as
if
the
government
can
move
this
expenditure
from
one
year
to
another
and
the
sum
involve
will
end
up
supposedly
be
only
€
100
million
.
the
government
make
commitment
to
the
tune
of
almost
€
500
million
that
will
now
have
to
be
reprofile
,
as
the
Taoiseach
say
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
commitment
the

Taoiseach
give

and
,
more

,
to
the

when
he
speak

last
Sunday
week
.
he
say
that
within
ten
day
everybody
would
be
aware
of
the

of
the

on

on

.
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
which
appear
to
have
be
more
forthcoming
than
other
at
this
stage
,
say
that
€3
million
will
come
from
the
flood
relief
scheme
.
as
a
representative
who
be
probably
affect
by
that
,
I
will
insist
on
know
what
scheme
and
project
in
the
flood
relief
scheme
will
be
affect
and
will
not
go
ahead
despite
the
commitment
give
by
the
government
last
year
and
previously
regard
the
funding
that
be
to
be
provide
in
that
regard
.
that
will
play
out
in
the
come
day
,
as
it
should
.
it
would
be
expect
of
we
to
extract
that
from
the
government
.
as
I
say
,
one
of
the
main
lesson
from
how
the
government
respond
to
this
fiasco
and
the
colossal
overspend
be
that
it
immediately
rush
to

there
be
great
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
public
that
it
will
ensure
broadband
be
available
to
every
house
.
if
it
be
available
at
a
cost
,
we
need
to
know
it
and
to
know
that
there
be
process
in
place
to
ensure
the
taxpayer
's
interest
be
protect
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
there

to
see
how
such

could
be

.
another
aspect
of
the
national
child
's
hospital
debacle
be
that
it
appear
the
initial
contract
provide
for
a
cost
of
construction
inflation
of
at
least
4
%
year
on

.
that
do
not
stop
it
go
to
8
%
if
that
be

be

Real

that
be
unfortunate
as
it
be
not
just
at
they
expense
but
at
the
expense
of
all
of
we
.
it
be
at
the
expense
of
this
island
's
prosperity
and
its
potential
to
succeed
economically
and
socially
.
more
importantly
,
from
we
perspective
the
good
Friday
agreement
have
the
potential
to
protect
we
security
,
and
that
be
paramount
.
we
will
not
use
this
unfortunate
mismanagement
and
almost
misappropriation
of
fund
for
political
gain
.
we
think
too
much
of
that
who
give
we
the
privilege
to
be
here
to
do
that
.
that
continue
to
be
the
raison
d'être
for
we
.
we
be
commit
to
this
country
be
unite
in
its
effort
to
respond
to
that
challenge
.
obviously
,
a
unite
government
and
unite
Dáil
be
essential
to
ensure
the
people
can
rest
assure
that
the
commitment
be
real
and
meaningful
.
will
the
minister
outline
whether
burial
site
ally
to
former
institution
be
be
examine
for
the
purpose
of
possible
further
investigation
?
this
be
in
the
context
of
the
commission
of
investigation
into
mother
and
baby
home
and
in
the
light
of
the
speech
that
the
minister
make
to
the
Seanad
on
6
February
,
when
she
indicate
that
the
commission
plan
to
deliver
a
substantial
report
on
the
burial
arrangement
for
person
who
die
while
resident
in
the
institution
by
15
March
2019
.
she
go
on
to
state
that
the
commission
's
assessment
of
burial
arrangement
at
other
major
institution
be
also
be
consider
.
what
be
the
state
of
play
vis
-à
-
vis
other
institution
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
reply
and
acknowledge
that
the
commission
have
capture
the
personal
experience
of
more
than
500
people
,
as
the
minister
note
in
she
speech
in
the
Seanad
.
I
ask
she
to
be
a
little
more
specific
about
other
institution
,
if
possible
.
can
I
deduce
from
the
minister
's
reply
that
other
former
institution
be
be
examine
,
and
that
there
will
be
a
report
to
that
effect
?
the
Tuam
site
be
well
document
and
a
process
be
under
way
.
can
we
expect
a
process
in
respect
of
other
part
of
the
country
?
in
that
case
,
we
can
assume
unambiguously
that
no
geophysical
testing
of
Bessborough
have
thus
far
take
place
but
that
if
the
need
arise
,
such
testing
will
take
place
.
can
a
decision
on
that
be
expect
when
the
report
be
publish
,
or
be
the
minister
,
in
consultation
with
she
cabinet
colleague
,
take
step
in
the
interim
to
have
geophysical
testing
do
at
the
site
?
I
could
go
around
the
house
in
north
Cork
-
and
in
east
Cork
for
that
matter
-
but
I
will
not
do
so
.
do
the
minister
anticipate
that
the
€9
million
allocation
will
actually
be
use
up
?
will
that
fund
be
fully
take
up
?
the
minister
have
not
visit
Cork
since
she
be
appoint
.
may
I
ask
a
brief
supplementary
question
on
that
subject
?
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
minister
be
give
the
House
some
signal
here
that
if
the
report
make
a
adjudication
or
finding
in
respect
of
Bessborough
,
there
will
be
a
action
there
and
she
will
consult
she
cabinet
colleague
.
I
would
be
grateful
if
the
minister
would
reiterate
on
the
record
of
the
House
,
give
she
bona
fide
in
respect
of
Tuam
,
that
the
same
set
of
principle
will
apply
in
respect
of
Bessborough
.
to
Bessborough
?

there
will
be
a
transport

Oireachtas
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
to
articulate
we
concern
in
respect
of
the
drip
-
feeding
of
report
to
the
media
without
a
parallel
process
in
respect
of
this
issue
in
place
in
the
House
.
a
mechanism
must
be
find
to
ensure
the
minister
report
back
to
the
House
on
this
matter
regularly
.
I
also
wish
to
ask
the
minister
specifically
when
Mr.
Elliott
's
report
will
be
finalise
and
make
public
.
this
be
a
matter
of
grave
public
concern
.
Mr.
Elliott
be
bring
in
by
Scouting
Ireland
.
he
be
a
safeguard
expert
whose
bona
fide
be
without
question
.
however
,
it
appear
as
though
the
line
of
public
communication
seem
to
be
between
Mr.
Elliott
internally
,
the
chief
executive
,
presumably
,
and
the
line
Department
.
we
be
concerned
that
this
be
quite
a
linear
process
which
need
to
be
expand
.
we
need
to
see
great
transparency
around
this
.
I
be
also
concerned
that
Scouting
Ireland
itself
be
manage
the
phoneline
for
that
with
concern
.
be
it
through
Scouting
Ireland
,
the
Garda
or
Tusla
that
people
should
go
?
I
do
not
believe
that
be
right
if
a
person
be
a
victim
or
allege
victim
,
or
that
person
wish
to
report
something
.
if
a
person
have
be
traumatise
by
a
organisation
historically
,
it
be
very
hard
to
have
the
confidence
to
return
to
that
organisation
to
report
allegation
of
abuse
.
I
want
to
put
that
on
the
record
as
it
be
a
issue
that
must
be
address
.
there
be
people
who
do
not
have
confidence
in
Scouting
Ireland
,
notwithstand
the
bona
fide
of
the
child
protection
expert
who
have
be
bring
in
.
they
must
have
confidence
that
they
issue
will
be
deal
with
through
Scouting
Ireland
as
the
phoneline
be
currently
constitute
.
there
be
a
danger
of
revictimise
people
who
have
be
traumatise
.
will
the
minister
consider
a
organisation
such
as
one
in
four
be
bring
in
to
examine
the
mechanism
be
use
to
deal
with
the
historical
case
?
it
could
liaise
with
the
external
expert
who
have
be
hire
as
a
internal
adviser
on
child
protection
in
Scouting
Ireland
.
this
liaison
could
take
place
through
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
and
-
or
Tusla
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
we
be
hear
of
this
almost
as
it
have
happen
.
however
,
I
have
a
concern
about
the
minister
's
reply
.
notwithstanding
she
openness
and
transparency
,
I
ask
specifically
that
in
historical
case
the
helpline
be
operate
by
a
independent
organisation
act
outside
Scouting
Ireland
.
that
be
important
.
the
minister
do
say
that
consideration
should
be
give
to
ensure
that
the
personnel
man
the
helpline
be
independent
of
Scouting
Ireland
.
there
be
a
mechanism
to
bring
in
a
organisation
such
as
one
in
four
.
there
be
a
lack
of
confidence
in
Scouting
Ireland
's
ability
to
deal
with
its
own
affair
.
I
be
concerned
by
the
minister
's
statement
that
consideration
should
be
give
to
nominate
the
ceo
of
Scouting
Ireland
to
be
the
principal
liaison
to
work
on
child
first
.
we
need
to
examine
the
dynamic
that
exist
within
Scouting
Ireland
regard
its
governance
.
notwithstanding
the
minister
's
robust
reply
,
the
government
need
to
take
this
completely
out
of
Scouting
Ireland
's
hand
for
it
to
be
deal
with
wholly
independently
if
there
be
to
be
confidence
among
the
parent
whose
child
be
part
of
scout
troops
throughout
the
country
.
a
great
shadow
be
be
cast
across
Scouting
Ireland
as
a
result
of
this
revelation
.
speak
as
a
parent
myself
,
I
be
very
concerned
about
Scouting
Ireland
as
constitute
,
notwithstand
the
issue
around
governance
and
child
protection
that
it
be
go
through
.
scout
Ireland
do
not
command
the
support
of
that
its
seek
to
represent
and
the
government
need
to
intervene
further
to
remove
it
from
they
hand
entirely
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
the
order
of
the
House
state
that
if
there
be
no
further
speaker
offer
before
11.30
p.m.

the

I
merely
wish
to
raise
a
issue
that
be
articulate
by
the
journalist
Paul
Williams
on
6
March
.
he
state
in
the
article
that
gardaí
uncover
evidence
of
a
major
scam
in
which
180
nonrespect
-eu
national
obtain
taxi
licence
use
fraudulent
public
service
vehicle
application
despite
have
no
legal
status
in
this
country
.
he
further
state
that
the
Garda
National
Immigration
Bureau
,
GNIB
,
search
several
residential
address
across
Dublin
in
which
it
be
suspect
false
documentation
include
spsv
application
be
be
produce
as
part
of
a
massive
immigration
fraud
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
this
matter
?
be
he
satisfied
that
measure
be
be
take
to
adequately
deal
with
issue
of
this
nature
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
.
he
outline
that
there
be
64
case
in
which
revocation
be
a
possibility
or
probability
and
that
35
deportation
be
pend
.
although
the
operation
be
geographically
align
to
the
Dublin
metropolitan
area
,
be
there
a
concern
regard
more
widespread
potential
immigration
fraud
and
usage
of
false
licence
?
be
there
any
intelligence
to
suggest
that
such
practice
may
also
be
take
place
in
other
part
of
the
country
?
I
welcome
the
response
of
the
minister
.
my
understanding
from
that
response
be
that
INIS
be
recommend
deportation
in
the
64
case
that
have
be
send
to
it
.
person
who
come
to
this
country
must
abide
by
the
law
.
there
be
taxi
driver
who
ply
they
trade
day
in
,
day
out
and
obey
the
rule
.
I
welcome
the
success
of
Operation
vantage
so
far
.
a
good
job
of
work
have
be
do
by
the
Garda
.
it
would
be
very
helpful
and
useful
for
the
minister
to
provide
any
insight
he
may
have
as
to
whether
this
problem
be
more
widespread
than
currently
seem
to
be
the
case
.
since

the

I
thank
my
colleague
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
for
share
she
time
with
I
.
I
,
too
,
congratulate
Deirdre
Kingston
,
Rebecca
Moynihan
and
people
such
as
George
Lawlor
-
I
speak
for
my
own
party
in
this
regard
-
for
raise
awareness
of
this
issue
and
certainly
build
my
consciousness
of
period
poverty
.
it
be
a
issue
I
would
have
typically
shy
away
from
previously
,
say
it
be
very
much
a
woman
's
issue
.
it
be
not
one
on
which
I
would
have
necessarily
engage
.
person
such
as
Ms
Moynihan
,
to
be
fair
to
she
,
have
certainly
open
my
eye
to
the
issue
at
play
here
.
as
a
society
,
if
we
be
to
move
on
and
really
achieve
full
equality
,
there
must
be
a
acknowledgement
of
issue
such
as
this
,
and
we
as
man
must
embrace
this
issue
.
it
be
particularly
welcome
that
the
woman
's
Caucus
have
embrace
this
as
a
issue
,
and
I
be
delighted
to
be
part
of
the
debate
and
the
interaction
today
.
on
a
personal
level
,
I
congratulate
everyone
who
be
part
of
this
initiative
.
what
we
see
here
be
a
cross-party
attempt
to
ensure
that
this
issue
be
deal
with
by
government
.
I
congratulate
the
people
from
the
NGO
sector
who
have
work
on
this
issue
.
it
be
particularly
apposite
that
in
the
House
of
Commons
today
,
notwithstand
the
bad
news
we
be
use
to
hear
from
that
House
,
there
be
a
chink
of
light
in
Philip
Hammond
's
spring
statement
.
he
say
he
have
decide
to
fund
the
provision
of
free
sanitary
product
in
secondary
school
and
college
in
England
from
the
next
school
year
.
I
be
no
fan
of
the
Tories
,
but
if
the
Tories
can
do
it
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
.
I
think
there
would
be
cross
-party
support
to
try
to
ensure
that
this
could
be
do
.
if
local
authority
be
do
it
and
embrace
this
as
a
issue
,
I
do
not
see
why
government
cannot
do
likewise
,
particularly
give
it
have
cross
-party
support
to
do
so
.
I
be
,
therefore
,
hopeful
the
government
can
deliver
on
this
and
respond
substantially
to
the
motion
before
we
.
the
Brexit
situation
be
fundamentally
unpredictable
.
few
political
analyst
predict
that
the
British
people
would
vote
to
leave
the
European
Union
.
few
could
have
predict
how
chaotic
and
torturous
the
negotiation
would
become
between
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
European
Union
.
even
now
,
two
week
before
the
exit
date
of
29
March
,
the
British
Parliament
have
not
be
ask
to
formally
vote
to
express
its
preference
for
the
future
EU
-
UK
relationship
.
yesterday
,
the
House
of
Commons
convincingly
reject
the
deal
broker
by
the
Prime
Minister
.
today
,
Westminster
be
expect
to
vote
overwhelmingly
against
a
British
exit
with
no
deal
.
from
this
and
previous
vote
,
we
know
what
Parliament
do
not
want
,
but
the
default
position
remain
a
no
deal
Brexit
until
Westminster
come
up
with
something
else
.
tomorrow
,
mp
will
be
ask
to
vote
on
extend
article
50
.
there
have
be
mix
signal
from
the
EU
institution
and
member
state
,
but
it
seem
likely
that
a
short
extension
to
the
end
of
June
would
be
grant
if
there
be
a
technical
reason
for
do
so
,
for
example
,
where
it
be
require
to
pass
legislation
.
there
be
little
appetite
for
allow
the
current
state
of
limbo
to
continue
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
position
that
we
should
not
block
any
reasonable
request
from
the
UK
for
a
extension
,
but
there
be
no
guarantee
that
a
extension
will
be
give
or
that
it
will
last
very
long
.
there
be
a
very
real
prospect
that
the
rejection
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
will
mean
the
UK
leave
the
EU
with
no
deal
or
with
only
a
minimal
set
of
arrangement
in
place
to
avoid
the
bad
of
a
sudden
departure
.
in
that
context
,
we
immediate
priority
have
to
be
people
's
job
and
livelihood
.
we
have
speak
at
length
in
recent
month
about
the
open
border
,
and
that
remain
a
absolute
necessity
,
but
as
Brexit
loom
ever
close
,
we
must
preserve
job
and
keep
small
business
afloat
.
the
Tánaiste
know
the
statistic
.
the
Minister
for
Finance
have
say
40000
job
be
at
risk
.
we
know
that
40
%
of
we
exporting
firm
only
export
to
the
UK
and
be
totally
expose
to
tariff
,
quota
or
other
barrier
to
trade
.
exporter
be
also
vulnerable
to
a
collapse
in
the
value
of
sterling
and
the
possible
influx
of
cheap
goods
from
outside
the
EU
into
the
UK
if
Britain
adopt
a
certain
type
of
trade
policy
.
certainly
,
the
indication
be
that
the
UK
intend
to
set
zero
tariff
on
a
wide
range
of
goods
.
however
,
there
will
be
tariff
on
some
food
export
,
which
be
bad
news
for
the
meat
and
dairy
sector
,
we
major
exporter
.
again
,
the
Tánaiste
know
the
statistic
.
this
export
from
Ireland
be
largely
to
Britain
,
and
tariff
on
food
export
would
be
a
significant
blow
.
even
in
case
where
zero
tariff
apply
,
extra
competition
for
access
to
the
UK
market
will
be
a
major
challenge
to
we
exporter
.
the
UK
could
well
open
its
market
to
country
with
much
low
wage
than
Ireland
.
that
would
be
a
challenge
which
would
impact
on
decent
wage
and
condition
of
employment
here
.
additionally
,
we
need
to
be
very
clear
that
Ireland
import
a
great
deal
from
the
UK
.
this
import
be
often
raw
material
for
goods
that
we
subsequently
export
.
we
do
not
yet
know
what
tariff
the
EU
will
apply
to
British
goods
enter
the
single
Market
,
but
there
be
likely
to
be
tariff
and
perhaps
quota
.
we
must
recall
that
under
World
Trade
Organization
rule
,
the
EU
must
apply
one
set
of
rule
for
all
third
party
country
,
and
the
UK
cannot
be
give
any
favourable
treatment
or
status
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
trade
agreement
.
as
we
know
,
such
a
agreement
be
a
long
way
off
.
Serious
negotiation
on
the
future
relationship
with
the
UK
have
not
yet
begin
because
the
British
government
have
waste
two
and
a
half
year
negotiate
the
withdrawal
agreement
.
much
of
this
negotiation
have
take
place
inside
the
Conservative
Party
.
in
that
context
,
as
I
say
,
much
be
unpredictable
.
perhaps
article
50
will
be
extend
for
a
significant
period
.
perhaps
the
UK
will
pass
the
current
withdrawal
agreement
to
buy
the
time
a
agree
transition
period
could
offer
.
perhaps
the
UK
will
end
up
have
a
general
election
or
a
new
referendum
,
the
result
of
either
of
which
be
genuinely
hard
to
predict
.
however
,
if
and
when
it
happen
,
Brexit
will
be
bad
for
Ireland
.
we
cannot
claim
to
have
predict
all
the
flow
of
goods
and
service
,
as
well
as
of
people
,
that
will
make
Brexit
so
damaging
for
job
and
business
.
the
Labour
Party
remain
to
be
satisfied
with
the
government
's
Brexit
preparation
.
while
the
government
have
provide
information
and
deliver
a
range
of
seminar
,
that
be
far
from
enough
.
we
need
now
to
talk
about
what
resource
will
be
in
place
to
save
job
and
business
.
after
the
2008
economic
crash
,
we
have
to
completely
redesign
we
bankruptcy
law
and
we
personal
insolvency
service
.
the
most
significant
lesson
from
2008
be
that
it
can
be
much
hard
to
provide
someone
with
a
new
job
and
career
than
to
stop
that
job
be
lose
in
the
first
place
.
likewise
,
it
be
easy
to
keep
a
business
afloat
rather
than
allow
someone
to
become
bankrupt
and
then
try
to
pick
up
the
piece
.
in
order
to
keep
job
and
business
go
,
we
need
to
have
fund
in
place
.
we
should
not
allow
a
situation
where
there
be
any
delay
whatsoever
after
29
March
,
or
the
end
of
June
,
where
the
government
need
to
pass
legislation
or
a
supplementary
budget
to
ensure
fund
can
be
spend
.
in
this
context
,
the
Labour
Party
endorse
the
proposal
of
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
for
the
creation
of
a
Brexit
adjustment
assistance
fund
.
it
suggest
put
€500
million
into
the
fund
,
rather
than
into
the
so
-
call
rainy
day
fund
.
the
government
's
Brexit
omnibus
Bill
have
not
cover
this
.
we
need
to
be
ready
,
in
a
lawful
manner
,
to
provide
state
aid
or
subsidy
to
that
business
which
be
most
vulnerable
to
the
effect
of
Brexit
.
the
government
have
say
its
preference
be
for
each
Department

spend
money
individually
to
its
own
sector
.
that
be
all
well
and
good
but
the
government
say
it
be
spend
€
200
million
.
be
that
enough
?
why
not
dedicate
the
full
€500
million
to
this
purpose
rather
than
put
it
in
the
so
-
call
rainy
day
fund
?
be
the
possibility
of
a
no
-
deal
Brexit
not
enough
of
a
emergency
?
the
Labour
Party
would
also
endorse
the
call
from
Congress
for
plan
tax
cut
in
2020
to
be
abandon
.
we
reject
this
proposal
when
the
Taoiseach
make
they
.
we
double
down
on
that
rejection
now
.
the
propose
tax
cut
would
only
benefit
the
top
one
in
five
income
earner
,
as
Revenue
statistic
show
.
no
benefit
whatsoever
would
go
to
the
low
and
middle
pay
four
out
of
every
five
worker
.
in
any
context
,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
hard
Brexit
,
such
tax
giveaway
would
be
reckless
and
divisive
,
as
well
as
economically
incompetent
.
there
be
a
wide
range
of
other
important
point
make
in
congress
's
report
,
the
implication
of
a
No-deal
Brexit
.
I
recommend
the
government
study
it
in
detail
.
time
do
not
allow
I
to
say
much
more
but
I
will
conclude
by
come
back
to
the
theme
of
unpredictability
.
we
just
do
not
know
what
be
go
to
happen
next
.
a
year
ago
,
the
government
be
sanguine
in
its
view
that
the
Irish
Border
backstop
be
bullet
proof
and
cast
iron
.
then
the
government
be
sure
the
withdrawal
agreement
be
a
good
deal
for
Ireland
.
the
British
Parliament
,
however
,
have
comprehensively
reject
the
withdrawal
agreement
,
notwithstand
the
great
effort
of
minister
and
Minister
of
State
such
as
deputy
McEntee
.
the
Irish
Border
backstop
be
at
the
centre
of
the
argument
,
especially
how
the
open
Border
require
the
UK
to
stay
close
to
European
custom
arrangement
and
single
market
rule
.
it
be
simply
impossible
to
predict
what
happen
next
.
accordingly
,
we
need
to
be
prepare
for
any
eventuality
,
include
a
no
-
deal
Brexit
in
little
over
two
week
's
time
.
the
government
need
to
do
much
more
to
ensure
we
be
prepare
.
if
we
learn
nothing
else
from
the
2008
economic
crash
and
the
painful
recovery
,
it
be
much
easy
to
keep
job
and
business
in
existence
-
even
on
life
support
-
than
it
be
to
let
they
go
to
the
wall
and
try
to
create
new
job
and
business
to
replace
they
.
the
Labour
Party
call
on
the
government
to
make
the
necessary
resource
available
,
along
with
whatever
legislation
be
need
to
allow
they
immediate
deployment
,
if
and
when
,
they
be
need
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
finance
,
Public
expenditure
and
Reform
pursuant
to
standing
order

I
will
stick
to
the
process
.
I
have
just
come
from
a
meeting
of
the
committee
on
Communication
,
climate
action
and
environment
,
where
we
be
discuss
the
issue
of
the
report
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
,
which
have
a
very
clear
set
of
recommendation
.
with
respect
,
and
I
be
always
deferential
in
regard
to
the
ruling
of
the
Ceann
Comhairle
,
in
the
short
time
afford
to
I
,
I
would
ask
you
to
allow
I
to
set
out
the
preamble
of
what
I
be
go
to
say
in
respect
of
the
process
.
thank
you
.
we
on
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Communication
,
Climate
action
and
environment
be
discuss
the
citizen
's
Assembly
report
.
there
be
a
very
clear
set
of
recommendation
in
respect
of
that
and
,
in
particular
,
a
set
of
clear
climate
action
that
the
people
want
to
see
put
into
effect
in
respect
of
reduce
the
million
of
tonne
of
carbon
we
produce
in
this
society
on
a
annual
basis
.
what
be
pertinent
to
the
debate
be
whether
the
House
allow
for
the
process
whereby
,
when
something
that
be
either
a
legitimate
motion
or
legitimate
legislation
come
before
the
House
,
depend
on
one
's
point
of
view
,
that
be
stymy
by
the
power
that
be
at
a
give
point
in
time
.
it
be
we
very
clear
view
that
this
process
be
be
stymy
,
and
I
make
no
bone
about
that
.
thousand
of
people
have
inundate
we
with
email
in
respect
of
they
view
and
to
ask
and
demand
of
we
that
we
keep
carbon
and
fossil
fuel
in
the
ground
and
do
not
extract
they
.
on
that
basis
,
in
respect
of
the
process
,
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
that
come
before
we
tonight
.
I
want
to
quote
from
one
of
the
email
I
have
receive
.
it
state
that
the
fair
and
reasonable
approach
be
clear
here
;
that
this
be
a
Dáil
Bill
and
the
select
committee
of
deputy
should
be
allow
to
decide
whether
to
move
the
Bill
to
the
next
stage
;
that
Senator
will
have
they
chance
to
vote
on
the
Bill
if
it
pass
all
stage
in
the
dáil
and
move
to
the
Seanad
;
and
that
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
block
deputy
from
pursue
the
Dáil
's
legislative
process
.
on
that
basis
,
and
in
deference
to
the
Ceann
Comhairle
as
chair
of
this
assembly
,
I
wish
to
support
the
motion
on
the
technical
basis
on
which
it
be
before
we
but
also
on
the
basis
of
the
substantive
issue
that
be
before

be
it
Mr.
Elliott

I
want
to

not

with
-----
my
question
do
not

with
governance

with
safeguarding
.
the
minister
come
into
the
House
recently
and
make
a
very
strong
statement
on
overnight
trip
for
scout
.
some
of
the
issue
be
now
be
work
through
,
and
we
hope
we
have
reach
a
more
positive
space
with
regard
to
Tusla
's
interaction
with
Scouting
Ireland

all
member
wish
for

the
thousand
of
family
with
child

member

which
be
volunteer
that
Scouting
Ireland
be
a
safe

to
be

all
member
believe
it
to
be
a
safe
place
,
but
there
be
some
inherent
risk

however
,
definitive
answer
from
the
minister

the
Tusla
review
of
supervision
of
child

.
she
have
give
no

far
today

she
discuss

to
know
where
we
be

piece

Mr.

have
be
investigate

be
he

of

article
38.3.1°
of
the
constitution
require
that
in
order
for
specify
offence
to
be
try
in
non-jury
court
,
the
inadequacy
of
the
ordinary
court
to
administer
justice
must
be
determine
in
accordance
with
law
.
there
be
a
difference
between
a
matter
that
be
to
be
determine
by
law
,
such
as
the
number
of
county
council
under
article
28a
,
and
one
to
be
determine
in

the
latter
phrase
denote
a
certain
basic
standard
of
decision

making
.
for
example
,
a
determination
base
on
the
toss
of
a
coin
could
never
be
one
make
in

.
previously
,
the

of

by
the

have
regard
to
the
fact
that
it
meet
and
act
as
a
collective
body
,
the
role
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
in
policing
and
the
reporting
relationship
with
the
Garda
Commissioner
,
it
be
reasonable
to
infer
that
a
reasonable
volume
of
information
be
available
to
it
when
make
this
decision
.
it
be
noteworthy
that
the

file
affidavit
as
to
its
knowledge
and
its
means
of
knowledge
when
its
decision
be
challenge
in
the
case
of
Kavanagh
v.
the
governor
of
Mountjoy
Prison
in
2001
.
the
court
clearly
afford
the
government
a
reasonable
margin
of
discretion
in
its
decision
,
although
it
be
careful
not
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
a
successful
challenge
.
in
the
1998
and
2009
Act
,
however
,
the
Oireachtas
arrogate
to
itself
the
determination
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
court
to
administer
justice
.
it
be
state
in
the
body
of
the
act
that
the
ordinary
court
be
inadequate
in
this
case
.
the
Oireachtas
then
delegate
to
the
two
house
the
decision
to
be
take
annually
as
to
whether
the
court
remain
inadequate
.
in
the
absence
of
such
decision
,
the
offence
continue
in
existence
but
cease
to
be
schedule
offence
.
if
a
Kavanagh

style
challenge
be
mount
today
,
what
would
a
affidavit
file
on

of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
contain
as
to
they
state
of
knowledge
about
any
of
this
thing
?
this
two
determination
amount
to
what
would
in
US
practice
be
call
legislative
finding
.
we
be
not
use
to
they
here
,
but
the
preamble
to
the
Financial
emergency
measure
in
the
Public
Interest
act
provide
example
whereby
,
"
a
serious
disturbance
in

a
decline

circumstance
of

have
occur
,

and
whereas
as
a
consequence
a
serious
deterioration
in

of

have
occur
and
there
be
significant
and
increase
Exchequer

"
.
however
,
legislator
could
make
that
FEMPI
finding
simply
by
virtue
of
information
officially
provide
to
they
under
statute
,
include
,
for
example
,
the
quarterly
Exchequer
return
.
there
be
no
comparable
body
of
information
provide
to
Oireachtas
Member
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
criminal
court
or
the
risk
of
corruption
or
intimidation
of
jury
.
in
the
Abbeylara
case
,
all
the
judge
expressly
recognise
that
member
of
both
house
be
entitle
to
make
inquiry
and
to
be
inform
through
they
committee
in
aid
of
the
legislative
power

in
this
matter
,
the
Oireachtas
and
,
every
year
since
,
the
two
house
,
make
finding
which
disturb
the
constitutional
equilibrium
.
they
sit
and
debate
in
public
,
as
do
the
committee
.
we
know
what
they
have
consider
and
,
as
such
,
we
know
what
they
have
neglect
to
consider
.
the
record
will
show
not
that
they
arrive
at
the
wrong
conclusion
on
the
evidence
,
but
,
rather
,
that
they
have
have
no
evidence
at
all
.
the
adequacy
of
the
ordinary
court
to
administer
justice
have
never
be
debate
by
a
committee
or
on
the
floor
of
either
House

the

report
furnish
by
the

to
both
house
recite
the
number
of

offence
have
be
prosecute
,
arrest

so

it
state
nothing
,
good
,
bad
or
indifferent
,
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
ordinary
court
to
administer
justice
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
report
be
detailed
.
however
,
what
be
relevant
be
what
be
not
include
in
it
.
it
refer
to
section
14
of

provide

create

be
schedule
offence

the
purpose
of
the
offence
against
the
State
Act
1939
,
and
that
schedule
offence
be
triable
before
the
non-jury
special
criminal
Court
.
it
go
on
to
state
that
section
14
,
which
deal
with
schedule
offence
under
the
Act
,
be
utilise
on
36
occasion
last
year
.
it
do
not
make
reference
to
the
fact
that

14
of
the

declare
that

be
inadequate

secure
the
effective
administration
of
justice
and
the
preservation

peace
and

in
respect
of
each
of

offence

the
House
be
be
invite
to
renew
that
declaration
on
foot
of

report
that

not
refer
to
the
term
of
the
declaration
expressly
or
by
implication
and
which
contain
no
information
or
opinion
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
ordinary
jury
court
.
the
more
solid
and
substantial
evidential
basis
we
require
for
renewal
be
one
that
expressly
recognise
and
address
the
core
question
of
whether
jury
court
be
inadequate
to
secure
the
effective
administration
of
justice
and
the
preservation
of
public
peace
and
order
.
in
the
absence
of
evidence
,
how
can
the
house
arrive
at
a
decision
in
accordance
with
law
that
section
14
of
the
1998
act
should
be
continue
?
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
decision
be
not
just
on
its
merit
wrong
and
ground
on
inadequate
evidence
,
but
rather
take
without
reference
to
any
evidence
at
all
,
it
be
not
too
hard
to
argue
that
the
determination
be
not
make
in
accordance
with
law
as
article
38
of
the
constitution
require
and
that
it
be
vulnerable
to
legal
challenge
by
a
future
defendant
before
the
special
criminal
Court
.
this
be
not
a
case
in
which
a
court
would
refuse
on
separation
of
power
grounds
to
second
-
guess
a
Parliamentary
opinion
;
it
be
,
rather
,
a
case
in
which
a
court
might
very
well
say
that
if
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
insist
on
retain
for
themselves
the
power
to
make
decision
on
this
matter
,
they
must
take
the
basic
step
of
inform
themselves
about
the
matter
on
which
they
be
to
decide
.
we
propose
two
amendment
to
the
motion
.
the
second
amendment
be
rule
out
of
order
as
be
equivalent
to
a
direct
negative
to
the
motion
.
the
first
amendment
resolve
that
section
2
to
4
,
inclusive
,
6
to
12
,
inclusive
,
and
17
of
the
offence
against
the
State
(
amendment
)
Act
1998
should
continue
in
operation
for
the
period
begin
30
June
2019
and
end
29
June
2020
.
however
,
the
amendment
resolve
that
section
14
of
that
act
should
not
continue
in
operation
.
the
effect
would
be
that
all
this
offence
would
be
continue
but
would
be
prosecute
in
the
ordinary
way
before
the
ordinary
court
.
the
reason
give
for
decline
to
resolve
that
section
14
should
continue
in
operation
be
"
for
want
of
any
or
any
adequate
information
be
present
to
[
the
Dáil
]
,
by
way
of
a
report
under
section
18
of
that
act
or
otherwise
,
in
order
to
enable
the
dáil
to
make
a
inform
finding
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
ordinary
court
to
secure
the
effective

I
do
not
propose
to
detain
the
House
for
long
.
we
unequivocally
support
the
Bill
.
I
come
to
the
House
with
the
expectation
that
the
government
would
have
take
into
consideration
the
point
make
in
the
Seanad
and
support
the
Bill
on
that
basis
,
but
I
be
disappointed
to
hear
,
yet
again
,
that
it
will
use
the
tool
of
the
money
message
to
stymie
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
practice
that
have
become
more
prevalent
as
this
dáil
progress
,
particularly
where
robust
legislative
measure
be
propose
by
the
Opposition
.
it
be
another
form
of
the
guillotine
,
to
be
frank
.
there
be
much
discourse
previously
about
the
use
of
the
guillotine
,
and
the
money
message
have
become
its
replacement
,
in
my
humble
opinion
.
I
read
the
Minister
's
speech
and
I
be
still
try
to
internalise
most
of
it
.
I
be
speak
off
the
cuff
about
it
,
to
be
honest
.
I
do
not
understand
the
minister
's
use
of
the
report
of
the
low
pay
Commission
as
a
mechanism
to
oppose
this
Bill
.
point
be
make
about
tip
by
the
low
pay
Commission
in
its
report
,
but
it
be
not
useful
to
use
that
as
a
Trojan
horse
for
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
would
say
there
be
challenge
lay
out
in
the
low
pay
Commission
's
report
and
suggest
that
we
try
to
meet
that
challenge
head
-
on
by
work
together
through
amendment
on
committee
stage
to
seek
to
legislate
for
this
principle
in
respect
of
people
who
receive
gratuity
.
I
work
in
the
hospitality
sector
as
a
student
and
I
know
one
become
reliant
on
tip
.
arguably
,
they
form
part
of
one
's
income
,
but
they
be
nonetheless
gratuity
.
there
be
a
cultural
precept
whereby
tipping
be
very
much
part
of
the
hospitality
sector
.
where
the
gratuity
be
give
it
provide
a
additional
form
of
income
but
it
be
not
,
of
itself
,
the
primary
form
of
income
.
if
we
move
away
from
that
cultural
aspect
,
we
will
do
a
disservice
to
people
in
the
hospitality
sector
.
the
principle
that
Senator
Gavan
and
other
be
seek
to
establish
in
this
legislation
be
that
people
would
retain
that
gratuity
and
the
gratuity
would
be
recognise
for
what
they
be
,
which
be
something
over
and
above
the
wage
accrue
by
the
individual
worker
.
however
,
the
minister
have
come
to
the
House
with
quite
a
bureaucratic
and
technocratic
response
,
use
the
low
pay
Commission
report
as
a
mechanism
to
kick
this
legislative
proposal
to
touch
.
the
idea
of
the
troncmaster
be
use
as
a
mechanism
to
oppose
the
legislation
by
say
it
would
have
certain
obligation
in
respect
of
report
to
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
that
be
not
insurmountable
.
it
could
be
legislate
for
on
committee
stage
if
we
be
imaginative
.
it
be
not
good
enough
to
come
to
the
House
to
express
sympathy
or
empathy
for
the
situation
in
which
worker
find
themselves
unless
one
come
forward
with
a
alternative
or
at
least
a
expression
of
goodwill
towards
progress
the
legislation
,
without
use
a
de
facto
guillotine
of
the
Bill
through
the
money
message
tool
.
the
ownership
of
tip
be
not
consider
wage
under
the
payment
of
Wage
Act
.
that
appear
to
be
the
kernel
of
this
issue
.
there
be
a
majority
view
in
the
House
in
favour
of
this
legislation
.
if
a
majority
view
in
favour
of
the
legislation
have
be
articulate
by
the
political
representative
of
party
and
entity
,
it
be
a
matter
for
the
government
to
allow
this
Bill
to
proceed
to
further
examination
on
committee
stage
.
we
must
recognise
the
majority
view
and
the
paradigm
that
exist
in
this
House
whereby
if
the
majority
of
political
party
express
a
view
in
favour
of
legislation
,
the
government
of
the
day
should
respect
that
and
at
least
allow
it
to
proceed
to
the
next
stage
.
we
will
wait
to
see
what
happen
on
Thursday
in
respect
of
allow
this
Bill
to
proceed
to
the
next
stage
,
but
I
again
lament
the
fact
that
the
money
message
have
be
use
as
a
tool
to
stymie
this
Bill
when
it
have
already
be
pass
by
the
Seanad
.
we
stand
unequivocally
by
this
Sinn
Féin
Bill
.
we
recognise
the
people
who
help
to
craft
the
Bill
and
we
recognise
it
as
a
genuine
attempt
to
ensure
that
people
who
receive
gratuity
get
what
be
duly
theirs
,
without
put
a
bureaucratic
or
technocratic
imposition
on
that
attempt
.
from
a
cultural
and
societal
point
of
view
in
the
hospitality
and
other
sector
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
principle
of
give
a
gratuity
or
tip
.
we
should
legislate
to
ensure
that
the
tip
go
to
its
rightful
owner
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order

Ryan
on
the
wonderful

be
a
very
tropical
issue
indeed
.
in
respect
of
the
new
plan
by
the
government
,
the
word
"
ambitious
"
be
perhaps
verbose
in
the
circumstance
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
plan
be
less
ambitious
than
the
42
recommendation
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
,
which
be
make
in
March
.
the
risk
of
fail
to
act
be
enormous
when
we
consider
future
generation
.
we
have
12
year
leave
to
reduce
emission
drastically
.
if
we
do
not
achieve
massive
and
rapid
decarbonisation
,
we
be
face
climate
breakdown
with
enormous
consequence
globally
for
fail
to
act
.
we
all
acknowledge
this
as
a
fact
at
this
stage
.
there
be
unprecedented
scientific
consensus
on
the
need
to
start
reduce
emission
by
between
5
%
and
10
%
per
annum
start
now
.
however
,
this
plan
aim
to
reduce
emission
by
just
2
%
each
year
from
2021
to
2030
and
then
by
7
%
each
year
after
2030
.
the
worry
I
have
about
the
government
's
plan
be
that
if
we
kick
this
target
further
down
the
road
and
fail
to
act
today
,
we
will
miss
the
2030
target
by
a
significant
margin
.
the
plan
delay
action
relative
to
what
we
say
we
would
do
in
the
joint
committee
.
this
delay
be
base
on
a
red
herring
that
new
technology
will
somehow
emerge
to
reduce
emission
.
we
already
have
the
solution
we
need
;
we
need
the
political
will
and
the
policy
to
implement
they
.
we
bring
in
a
lot
of
expertise
in
the
joint
committee
and
work
out
how
many
of
this
solution
could
well
be
implement
now
.
it
be
the
view
of
the
Labour
Party
that
the
government
's
plan
take
some
of
that
action
and
water
they
down
.
the
joint
committee
agree
that
new
climate
legislation
would
be
enact
by
the
Oireachtas
in
2019
and
that
it
would
contain
several
crucial
new
governance
structure
,
include
emission
reduction
target
for
2030
and
2050
and
carbon
budget
to
map
out
the
quantity
of
emission
allowable
in
each
five
-
year
period
.
the
government
's
plan
now
roll
back
on
the
all
-
party
recommendation
and
instead
say
it
will
publish
legislation
in
March
2020
.
this
House
have
already
declare
a
climate
emergency
.
it
could
be
late
2020
before
the
government
's
legislation
see
the
light
of
day
and
be
pass
by
the
Oireachtas
and
another
year
will
have
pass
.
the
joint
committee
feel
strongly
that
carbon
budget
be
a
excellent
way
to
plan
for
emission
reduction
in
a
way
that
be
transparent
and
accountable
.
we
have
be
push
for
they
but
the
government
's
climate
action
plan
depart
considerably
from
the
UK
plan
,
on
which
we
kick
the
tyre
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
joint
committee
.
unlike
the
UK
plan
,
on
which
the
committee
formulate
its
recommendation
for
planning
and
set
carbon
budget
up
to
2035
,
the
government
plan
allow
carbon
budget
to
be
change
every
five
year
.
the
whole
point
of
set
the
budget
in
law
well
in
advance
be
to
safeguard
the
process
from
short
-
term
political
horse
trading
.
we
need
to
make
sure
that
carbon
budget
be
do
properly
when
it
come
to
lay
down
the
procedure
in
a
new
or
amend
climate
act
.
on
the
role
of
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
,
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
agree
that
new
function
and
power
should
be
give
to
the
climate
council
in
line
with
the
citizen
's
Assembly
recommendation
.
this
should
include
great
capacity
and
a
big
budget
to
match
the
great
demand
be
place
on
this
important
climate
body
.
the
government
's
action
plan
,
however
,
do
not
allocate
the
extra
capacity
or
resource
that
be
need
.
we
need
to
make
sure
we
be
do
thing
right
.
I
hope
this
matter
will
be
revisit
.
on
home
energy
retrofit
,
the
new
government
plan
set
a
target
of
upgrade
500000
home
to
a
b
energy
rating
by
2030
.
the
joint
committee
's
plan
have
already
agree
to
put
the
measure
in
place
to
deliver
800000
deep
energy
retrofit
by
2030
.
there
be
now
a
gap
between
the
joint
committee
's
ambitious
recommendation
and
target
and
the
government
's
target
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
government
plan
row
back
significantly
on
what
we
agree
in
March
.
instead
of
show
a
urgency
to
deliver
home
energy
retrofit
,
it
commit
to
a
nominal
increase
in
the
exist
national
target
as
lay
down
in
the
national
development
plan
.
there
be
huge
unmet
potential
in
Ireland
for
community
-
own
energy
.
community
energy
be
a
way
to
collectively
reduce
energy
demand
and
achieve
renewable
energy
target
.
it
do
this
with
local
,
social
and
economic
benefit
.
it
democratise
energy
generation
and
could
go
a
long
way
towards
help
to
meet
anticipate
strong
growth
in
energy
demand
in
the
period
until
2030
.
against
all
expectation
,
the
government
plan
do
not
do
anything
more
to
encourage
and
support
community
energy
than
what
be
already
commit
to
under
the
renewable
electricity
support
scheme
,
RESS
.
the
timeline
be
no
more
than
what
be
already
require
under
exist
EU
target
.
again
,
we
perceive
a
lack
of
ambition
on
the
part
of
the
government
plan
.
we
need
to
remove
the
barrier
to
entry
for
community
energy
project
and
have
a
ring
-
fence
pot
for
community
energy
in
the
first
ress
auction
.
this
recommendation
be
in
the
report
of
the
Joint
Oireachtas
Committee
on
Climate
Action
but
be
not
in
the
government
plan
.
peatland
restoration
may
offer
a
nature
-
base
solution
to
climate
change
.
the
joint
committee
propose
many
action
on
nature
base
solution
which
be
not
reflect
in
this
report
.
we
need
to
use
nature
to
capture
carbon
and
keep
it
in
the
ground
.
this
new
plan
refer
to
peatland
re-wetting
but
do
not
contain
any
target
or
specific
measure
.
the
joint
committee
do
considerable
work
on
this
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
target
to
restore
200000
ha
of
natural
and
cutover
peatland
and
50000
ha
of
industrially
harvest
peatland
by
2030
.
this
be
not
a
issue
specifically
for
the
line
minister
,
the
Minister
for
Culture
,
Heritage
and
the
Gaeltacht
,
deputy
Josepha
Madigan
.
we
have
some
deliberation
with
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
on
this
matter
yesterday
.
there
must
be
a
whole
-
of
-
government
response
on
this
issue
.
we
contend
that
resource
must
be
provide
to
address
the
urgent
need
to
start
a
major
re-wetting
programme
to
stop
exist
emission
from
peatland
.
this
feed
into
the
just
transition
issue
.
while
the
proposal
to
establish
a
just
transition
review
group
under
the
auspices
of
the
National
economic
and
social
Council
,
NESC
,
be
welcome
,
we
would
also
argue
that
the
just
transition
task
force
must
address
or
have
the
capability
to
address
the
issue
that
arise
in
the
midland
.
on
forestry
,
rather
than
the
industrially
manage
monoculture
of
Sitka
spruce
,
we
need
to
shift
to
continuous
cover
forestry
with
a
good
mix
of
tree
species
.
this
type
of
forestry
be
far
good
at
capture
carbon
,
be
good
for
the
environment
and
would
provide
more
high
-
value
job
in
direct
employment
and
in
local
industry
.
the
government
plan
rely
heavily
on
forestry
to
soak
away
carbon
but
contain
nothing
about
the
sustainability
and
environmental
performance
of
the
forestry
model
to
be
use
.
this
be
a
climate
issue
and
need
to
be
treat
as
one
.
the
new
plan
refer
to
a
climate
action
delivery
board
.
there
must
to
be
further
deliberation
on
this
.
I
welcome
the
discussion
we
have
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
the
joint
committee
yesterday
on
how
the
climate
action
delivery
board
will
work
but
it
remain
the
view
of
the
joint
committee
that
,
in
buttress
the
power
and
resource
of
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
,
one
have
a
independent
council
that
sit
outside
of
the
government
that
can
put
smacht
-
or
manners
-
on
the
government
of
the
day
.
it
become
a
issue
if
too
much
of
the
plan
depend
on
what
be
happen
in
the
government
and
through
the
individual
Departmental
silo
.
without
any
proper
oversight
or
real
power
vested
in
a
independent
council
,
I
fear
there
would
be
slippage
in
the
target
.
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
who
seek
to
knock
down
many
of
the
silo
that
exist
within
government
,
have
be
in
government
,
I
recognise
that
if
individual
line
Department
be
protect
they
own
brief
and
edifice
,
I
worry
about
the
danger
of
the
overarching
policy
or
plan
become
bog
down
in
internecine
and
interdepartmental
war
.
for
this
reason
,
we
need
proper
oversight
of
the
plan
to
ensure
carbon
budgeting
be
nail
down
and
have
a
legislative
base
,
with
a
statutory
carrot
and
stick
to
ensure
the
plan
get
deliver
.
I
would
like
to
see
great
dovetailing
and
interoperability
between
the
plan
and
the
recommendation
of
the
joint
committee
.
we
must
remember
that
the
recommendation
of
the
joint
committee
reflect
the
finding
of
the
citizen
's
Assembly
.
as
such
,
the
committee
's
report
come
directly
from
the
people
.
some
work
be
need
to
get
42
distinct
and
separate
voice
together
to
agree
,
by
and
large
,
a
set
of
policy
,
principle
and
recommendation
.
this
be
why
I
be
hopeful
the
government
and
minister
of
the
day
will
lean
more
towards
the
report
's
recommendation
because
they
be
radical
and
take
more
of
they
on
board
as
the
plan
move
through
its
iterative
process
.
I
be
delighted
to
wholeheartedly
welcome
the
Bill
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
bring
it
before
the
House
.
we
have
be
through
quite
a
process
since
2016
in
seek
to
have
this
place
firmly
on
the
agenda
and
I
be
delighted
to
be
part
of
a
process
where
we
be
in
agreement
with
the
government
's
Bill
on
the
important
issue
of
ban
microbead
.
I
acknowledge
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
's
role
in
this
because
she
start
the
ball
roll
.
when
she
Bill
be
reject
by
the
government
on
the
basis
of
single
market
issue
and
certain
article
in
the
EU
treaty
,
we
take
up
the
cudgel
.
as
have
be
state
,
we
use
the
precedent
of
the
smoking
ban
as
a
mechanism
to
progress
the
issue
through
the
introduction
of
we
own
Bill
.
I
recall
speak
on
second
stage
of
that
legislation
on
4
May
2017
and
acknowledge
that
it
be
not
be
oppose
at
that
juncture
and
that
I
would
gladly
withdraw
it
if
I
see
the
colour
of
the
government
's
money
.
I
be
glad
that
the
minister
have
deliver
on
the
promise
that
be
make
.
while
I
be
possibly
in
uncharted
territory
in
that
I
may
be
the
only
member
of
the
Opposition
to
withdraw
a
private
Member
's
Bill
,
which
I
be
not
sure
there
be
precedent
for
,
on
the
basis
of
a
commitment
the
government
give
to
introduce
its
own
legislation
,
I
do
so
on
trust
.
I
be
glad
to
state
that
my
trust
be
repaid
with
the
publication
of
the
Bill
before
we
.
the
passing
of
this
legislation
could
be
the
minister
's
great
legacy
.
future
generation
will
thank
this
House
for
legislate
in
respect
of
this
very
important
issue
.
notwithstanding
that
,
we
all
know
what
microplastic
and
microbead
be
.
I
do
not
need
to
speak
about
they
effect
on
the
environment
.
we
be
all
well
-
educate
on
the
effect
that
they
have
for
marine
and
other
life
in
we
watercourse
and
the
ocean
.
I
have
a
question
on
a
matter
to
which
deputy
Ó
Broin
refer
.
I
refer
to
the
lack
of
intention
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
target
leave
-
on
or
wear
-
off
product
at
this
time
.
I
know
it
be
not
possible
for
the
minister
,
he
official
or
any
of
the
agency
of
State
to
police
the
daily
ablution
of
citizen
regard
what
they
do
in
they
own
bathroom
but
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
,
even
when
the
Bill
be
enact
,
the
risk
that
microplastic
will
still
enter
we
watercourse
and
the
ocean
.
I
want
the
minister
and
he
official
to
clarify
the
position
in
respect
of
the
leave
-
on
product
.
the
minister
state
:
although
there
be
readily
available
alternative
ingredient
to
replace
plastic
microbead
in
rinse
-
off
cosmetic
product
,
manufacturer
cannot
currently
reformulate
leave
-
on
cosmetic
product
as
easily
.
the
impact
to
the
cosmetic
industry
and
to
consumer
would
be
enormous
if
such
a
blanket
ban
be
introduce
at
this
time
.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
not
to
take
on
the
cosmetic
industry
,
its
modus
operandi
be
for
a
environmental
good
,
to
ensure
future
marine
life
and
human
health
so
that
we
be
not
ingest
this
plastic
back
into
we
system
.
we
already
have
a
evidence
base
which
show
we
that
sea
life
be
already
consume
plastic
and
it
be
inherent
within
it
and
human
as
well
.
I
be
worried
if
we
be
not
go
the
whole
hog
in
term
of
ban
microbead
outright
and
if
we
be
introduce
a
exception
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
allay
my
fear
when
he
reply
.
if
we
have
to
wait
for
a
six
-
year
lead
-
in
time
for
restrict
leave
-
on
cosmetic
product
on
the
basis
that
he
be
allow
for
product
reformulation
,
then
I
be
fearful
that
we
may
be
in
a
position
where
we
will
not
have
tackle
the
problem
fully
.
I
accept
the
minister
's
bona
fide
in
respect
of
the
Irish
position
but
I
be
concerned
because
,
as
deputy
Ó
Broin
indicate
,
the
cosmetic
lobby
have
more
direct
access
to
the
European
Commission
than
any
member
state
in
term
of
the
efficacy
of
its
lobbying
.
it
could
seek
to
put
a
stay
on
any
legislative
proposal
come
from
the
commission
in
respect
of
wipe
out
the
use
of
microbead
in
cosmetic
altogether
.
I
hope
my
concern
in
this
regard
will
be
address
.
I
have
a
question
on
the
maximum
size
of
microbead
,
which
be
refer
to
as
be
5
mm
.
do
any
industry
standard
specify
5
mm
?
be
the
figure
determine
on
the
basis
of
advice
receive
from
particular
entity
or
scientific
adviser
?
it
be
not
that
I
doubt
the
5
mm
specification
in
any
way
but
I
be
interested
in
the
logic
behind
it
.
I
welcome
the
legislation
and
thank
the
minister
for
bring
it
before
the
House
.
I
acknowledge
that
he
deliver
on
the
commitment
he
give
that
he
would
legislate
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
all
member
of
this
House
,
in
a
non-partisan
way
and
through
the
intervention
they
have
make
,
be
very
clear
regard
they
intention
to
seek
to
have
this
matter
legislate
for
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
when
the
minister
be
refer
to
leave
-
on
product
I
believe
he
could
have
be
refer
to
what
might
loosely
be
term
"
cosmeceutical
"
,
where
there
be
marketing
of
a
cosmetic
that
claim
to
have
a
medical
benefit
.
I
be
not
sure
if
that
be
where
he
be
go
with
this
but
there
must
be
clarity
on
Committee
stage
,
notwithstand
the
point
he
make
about
delay
the
legislation
.
if
we
do
not
fully
legislate
for
the
abolition
of
microbead
or
if
there
be
any
doubt
about
that
in
term
of
pass
legislation
in
the
House
in
which
there
be
a
massive
amount
of
exception
,
it
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
.
this
issue
arise
from
the
propose
takeover
of
GlaxoSmithKline
,
GSK
,
in
Cork
by
Thermo
Fischer
Scientific
.
it
have
give
rise
to
concern
on
the
part
of
the
worker
and
they
representative
,
specifically
SIPTU
which
represent
the
majority
of
the
affect
worker
.
they
relate
to
the
interpretation
or
perceive
lack
of
adherence
to
the
regulation
in
respect
of
the
transfer
of
undertaking
regulation
of
2003
.
the
trade
union
SIPTU
have
write
to
the
Minister
for
Business
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
but
I
understand
the
matter
be
now
in
the
bailiwick
of
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
.
I
will
quote
from
a
letter
I
receive
in
respect
of
concern
that
be
raise
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
.
it
refer
to
:
...
GSK
management
's
announcement
that
they
have
fail
to
consult
fully
with
the
union
and
merely
put
in
place
a
communication
strategy
to
inform
we
member
of
both
employer
's
unilateral
decision
to
change
exist
term
and
condition
of
employment
.
the
type
of
unilateral
change
communicate
by
both
employer
to
worker
have
far
reach
economic
impact
on
we
member
for
example
the
ceasing
of
the
define
Benefit
Pension
Scheme
,
fundamental
change
to
the
bonus
scheme
,
non-transfer
of
annual
leave
entitlement
,
cease
of
the
revenue
approve
share
purchase
scheme
.
they
be
just
some
of
the
issue
that
have
arise
.
the
worker
in
GSK
be
inform
by
they
employer
on
16
May
last
that
the
plant
,
which
employ
over
400
people
,
be
to
be
sell
to
Thermo
Fischer
Scientific
"
under
transfer
of
undertaking

the
purpose
of
the
European
Community
(
Protection
of

2003
...
"
.
in
plain
English
,
one
entity
have
be
take
over
by
another
.
there
be
pre-exist
and
longstanding
agreement
collectively
arrive
at
and
it
be
fear
that
they
will
now
be
push
aside
.
this
relate
to
holiday
,
sick
pay
and
other
change
the
employee
will
have
to
incur
,
particularly
with
regard
to
they
pension
entitlement
or
a
previously
negotiate
pension
arrangement
.
any
entity
,
regardless
of
what
it
be
,
must
be
compliant
with
the
law
.
I
be
raise
this
with
the
government
to
ensure
that
the
worker
in
GSK
and
Thermo
Fischer
Scientific
be
protect
in
law
and
that
a
process
be
put
in
place
forthwith
through
the
machinery
of
the
State
,
be
it
the
Labour
Court
or
through
a
conciliation
process
,
whereby
the
government
be
watchful
of
what
be
happen
and
ensure
it
be
aware
of
the
situation
so
there
will
be
a
proper
dialogue
between
the
two
side
to
ensure
no
worker
's
rights
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
minister
clearly
and
unambiguously
state
the
law
.
a
minister
who
sit
at
cabinet
have
state
,
on
the
record
of
this
House
,
the
law
of
the
land
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
I
hope
that
any
party
bear
witness
to
this
exchange
be
mindful
of
this
.
however
,
he
also
state
,
"
I
currently
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
company
involved
will
not
comply
with
the
legislation
.
"
I
have
no
way
of
know
that
and
I
be
sure
the
Minister
of
State
have
no
way
of
know
it
because
he
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
.
I
be
hopeful
that
,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
have
raise
this
issue
,
some
process
can
be
enter
into
whereby
the
Minister
of
State
's
colleague
in
cabinet
will
take
heed
of
the
main
provision
of
the
regulation
,
as
he
have
clearly
set
they
out
.
as
a
minister
of
State
who
sit
at
cabinet
have
set
out
the
regulation
on
the
record
of
the
House
,
I
be
pretty
sure
the
party
involve
will
take
heed
of
they
.
I
record
my
gratitude
to
the
Chairman
,
deputy
Ó
Caoláin
,
and
the
committee
for
bring
forward
a
very
insightful
report
and
a
set
of
recommendation
that
I
feel
be
base
on
common
sense
,
be
very
pragmatic
and
should
be
easily
implementable
.
arise
from
that
recommendation
,
I
acknowledge
the
contribution
the
Police
Service
of
Northern
Ireland
make
to
the
committee
in
respect
of
some
of
the
initiative
in
which
it
be
involved
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
use
of
social
media
.
there
be
approximately
900000
follower
of
the
PSNI
and
it
be
use
as
a
very
good
mechanism
for
communication
.
give
the
time
we
live
in
,
and
notwithstand
the
good
work
of
Muintir
to
Tíre
,
which
be
also
acknowledge
in
the
report
-
the
text
message
alert
be
very
useful
and
should
be
retain
and
resource
-
there
be
also
the
other
form
of
social
media
that
present
a
opportunity
for
gardaí
and
the
population
to
engage
in
a
proactive
and
preventative
way
where
incident
occur
.
I
be
strike
today
by
the
intervention
of
the
representative
of
the
Garda
Representative
Association
on
"
Morning
Ireland
"
in
respect
of
issue
in
Longford
.
he
mention
that
the
force
there
be
operate
on
a
fire
brigade
basis
,
which
be
how
he
put
it
.
the
import
be
that
gardaí
be
react
and
that
they
be
provide
all
-
to
-
call
service
.
if
nothing
else
,
this
report
and
its
recommendation
seek
to
move
we
away
from
that
towards
a
more
reflective
type
of
policing
mechanism
,
where
gardaí
be
on
the
ground
,
gather
intelligence
on
a
day
-
to
-
day
basis
,
and
they
can
engage
with
people
actively
in
a
way
that
prevent
crime
from
happen
.
if
we
can
take
the
recommendation
in
this
report
and
inculcate
they
into
the
policing
model
that
be
evolve
,
and
let
we
acknowledge
how
it
be
evolve
,
and
if
we
can
achieve
that
in
a
pragmatic
and
sensible
way
,
we
could
do
a
lot
to
prevent
what
be
happen
in
the
town
and
city
of
the
State
,
and
prevent
a
lot
of
crime
.
we
acknowledge
there
be
increase
resource
and
the
magic
number
be
15000
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
however
,
while
seek
to
reach
that
point
,
we
have
to
try
to
prevent
incident
such
as
that
that
be
happen
in
Longford
and
other
part
of
the
State
.
if
the
local
GRA
representative
be
say
we
be
operate
a
fire
brigade
service
where
we
be
react
to
incident
and
it
be
very
hard
to
keep
on
top
of
that
because
there
be
a
lack
of
resource
and
a
need
for
a
strong
Garda
presence
,
then
we
need
to
look
carefully
at
what
be
be
say
and
react
positively
to
it
.
I
welcome
what
be
a
very
progressive
report
.
the
proposal
and
recommendation
in
regard
to
the
crime
and
Disorder
Act
1998
warrant
further
investigation
and
attention
.
the
report
state
:
"
the
committee
believe
that
,
whilst
some
collaboration
do
exist
between
a
Garda
Síochána
and
other
organisation
to
provide
community
-
base
service
in
Ireland
,
much
more
need
to
be
do
to
implement
a
properly
structure
and
effective
multi-agency
model
.
"
it
also
state
:
the
crime
and
Disorder
Act
(
1998
)
define
the
core
group
of
agency
involve
in
this
partnership
,
as
well
as
they
function
and
role
at
the
local
level
.
the
committee
recommend
that
serious
consideration
be
give
to
introduce
similar
legislation
in
Ireland
.
there
be
a
lot
of
common
sense
in
that
.
it
could
be
that
this
thinking
be
already
take
place
within
the
Department
and
with
the
Garda
Commissioner
.
if
that
be
put
on
some
sort
of
a
statutory
footing
and
formalise
,
it
would
have
a
massive
impact
in
term
of
how
policing
be
do
on
this
island
.
I
welcome
the
report
,
which
be
a
very
good
template
to
work
from
.
the
minister
have
welcome
the
report

I

I
support
the
motion
.
I
want
to
focus
on
one
aspect
of
the
issue
relate
to
the
submission
make
by
Family
Carers
Ireland
,
FCI
,
in
respect
of
the
transport
and
mobility
scheme
.
the
mobility
allowance
and
motorised
transport
grant
be
withdraw
in
2013
.
I
quote
from
a
very
sensible
submission
it
make
,
which
state
:
the
failure
to
replace
the
Mobility
Allowance
and
motorised
Transport
Schemes
,
withdraw
in
2013
on
the
grounds
of
age
discrimination
,
have
lead
to
the
illogical
situation
whereby
that
who
receive
a
Mobility
Allowance
prior
to
2013
have
be
allow
to
keep
it
while
other
now
equally
in
need
be
lock
out
.
it
also
mean
that
the
only
transport
support
available
be
the
disabled
driver
and
Passenger
Scheme
,
which
be
target
only
at
that
with
severe
physical
disability
,
with
no
support
available
to
that
with
a
intellectual
disability
.
this
prioritise
the
need
of
people
with
physical
disability
over
that
with
a
intellectual
disability
and
be
subject
to
legal
challenge
.
that
sum
up
the
issue
.
I
be
chairman
of
the
Committee
on
Public
Petition
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
who
have
responsibility
for
disability
,
appear
before
the
committee
in
October
2017
.
at
that
stage
he
be
promise
a
transport
scheme
.
last
year
in
May
2018
,
a
memorandum
be
bring
to
the
government
on
the
same
issue
with
proposal
for
a
transport
-
support
payment
scheme
which
do
not
seem
to
pass
muster
at
the
cabinet
and
they
be
ask
to
go
away
and
look
at
the
issue
again
.
in
January
2019
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
state
:
I
intend
to
revert
to
government
in
due
course
with
revise
proposal
to
reflect
the
discussion
at
that
cabinet
meeting
and
further
discussion
between
myself
and
Minister
Harris
on
the
good
way
to
progress
the
Transport
Scheme
.
I
do
not
understand
the
role
of
the
Minister
of
State
in
the
government
.
I
know
what
he
title
be
but
I
feel
strongly
that
he
have
deliver
absolutely
nothing
for
the
people
he
be
suppose
to
serve
.
this
be
a
typical
example
of
a
government
kick
to
touch
a
issue
it
promise
to
legislate
and
provide
for
.
it
be
a
very
specific
issue
but
it
affect
people
in
a
complex
way
.
the
spirit
of
this
motion
from
we
party
reflect
a
sensible
set
of
recommendation
from
Family
Carers
Ireland
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
give
the
excuse
that
there
be
little
or
no
resource
,
we
will
take
that
with
a
pinch
of
salt
.
the
rainy
day
fund
be
a
example
of
that
.
money
can
be
find
for
that
particular
scheme
to
ensure
that
that
in
need
be
provide
for
.
it
would
not
take
a
pile
of
money
to
do
this
,
give
that
on
numerous
occasion
,
include
at
cabinet
meeting
,
the
Minister
of
State
have
say
that
he
would
provide
for
the
replacement
of
the
2013
scheme
.
in
my
short
submission
,
I
call
on
he
to
deliver
on
he
promise
.
when
it
come
to
this
agenda
,
the
Minister
of
State
have
disappear
.
he
be
kick
everything
to
touch
.
I
could
go
on
and
on
about
the
family
I
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
and
they
son
and
daughter
with
intellectual
disability
who
cannot
access
even
a
night
of
respite
.
as
deputy
,
we
have
have
conversation
with
the
ceo
of
the
service
provider
and
then
have
go
back
to
the
HSE
and
the
government
but
we
cannot
get
honest
,
decent
answer
to
the
question
we
put
forward
.
all
we
want
be
to
represent
the
people
who
elect
we
.
all
they
be
ask
for
,
on
behalf
of
they
family
,
be
the
dignity
of
be
able
to
access
respite
care
for
they
love
one
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
go
to
ground
and
I
fail
to
understand
it
.
the
Labour
Party
make
decision
in
government
and
we
pay
a
price
for
it
but
this
be
a
time
of
relative
plenty
;
the
resource
be
there
.
I
understand
the
government
have
to
make
provision
for
thing
such
as
Brexit
but
I
do
not
understand
why
,
in
the
time
in
which
we
live
,
we
cannot
provide
for
that
who
do
not
have
a
strong
voice
for
themselves
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
Health
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
149(
1
)
.
I
express
my
solidarity
with
the
more
than
200
worker
who
find
themselves
in
a
position
where
they
be
go
to
lose
they
job
.
there
be
some
240
job
,
161
part
time
and
79
full
time
,
on
the
line
at
the
Cork
mail
centre
.
I
anticipate
that
the
minister
will
tell
we
he
have
no
operational
involvement
in
decision
of
this
nature
.
it
be
important
,
however
,
that
we
have
a
opportunity
to
raise
we
concern
about
this
decision
.
that
concern
be
base
on
the
fact
that
it
be
difficult
to
see
the
justification
for
the
closure
of
this
mail
centre
.
a
Post
be
tell
we
that
its
operating
profit
last
year
be
€
41
million
and
that
there
be
a
7
%
rise
in
revenue
as
well
as
a
40
%
rise
in
parcel
volume
.
the
company
's
justification
for
the
closure
of
the
Cork
plant
be
that
the
centre
be
operate
25
%
below
capacity
due
to
the
decline
in
traditional
mail
volume
.
it
be
difficult
for
I
,
and
the
worker
,
to
reconcile
that
fact
with
the
40
%
rise
in
the
parcel
delivery
volume
last
year
.
that
surely
represent
a
opportunity
.
if
that
business
be
grow
,
a
Post
should
ensure
that
all
of
its
sorting
and
mail
centre
be
include
within
the
mix
.
the
people
of
Cork
be
disgust
by
a
Post
's
decision
to
cull
,
in
a
very
political
way
,
the
Cork
mail
centre
because
they
see
no
justification
for
this
decision
.
the
excuse
that
there
be
a
decline
in
traditional
mail
when
the
evidence
show
a
increase
in
revenue
from
the
rise
in
parcel
volume
do
not
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
the
decision
be
make
and
I
note
that
the
narrative
have
now
move
on
to
try
to
get
the
good
deal
possible
for
the
worker
.
let
we
remember
that
there
be
161
part
-
time
worker
and
79
full
-
time
worker
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
we
have
to
understand
,
at
a
time
when
parcel
volume
be
increase
across
various
business
sector
,
why
a
Post
be
excise
one
of
its
key
centre
and
sacrifice
one
of
its
mail
centre
.
to
my
mind
,
that
do
not
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
I
be
raise
this
with
the
minister
because
it
be
important
that
there
be
a
political
response
from
the
government
regard
this
issue
.
be
that
not
the
point
?
we
do
not
know
which
of
the
centre
be
the
most
efficient
.
we
have
not
have
sight
of
the
McKinsey
report
so
we
do
not
know
for
sure
which
of
the
centre
be
the
least
efficient
.
this
be
a
political
decision
.
I
believe
a
Post
go
for
the
political
path
of
least
resistance
.
the
Cork
mail
centre
be
sacrifice
on
the
altar
on
that
basis
.
I
be
hope
that
in
government
circle
there
would
have
be
a
great
degree
of
resistance
by
that
at
cabinet
and
that
there
would
have
be
some
fight
for
Cork
.
that
have
not
be
the
case
,
as
it
transpy
.
I
will
make
a
prediction
.
I
forecast
that
this
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
universal
service
obligation
and
the
five
-
day
delivery
service
.
we
be
start
to
get
rid
of
mail
centre
and
post
office
and
that
be
cloth
in
the
pretence
of
investment
in
the
General
Post
Office
,
GPO
,
on
Oliver
Plunkett
Street
and
a
new
delivery
unit
be
open
in
Skibbereen
.
that
be
all
welcome
change
but
they
be
piecemeal
.
the
structural
long
-
term
objective
of
a
Post
be
to
go
down
to
a
three
,
a
two
or
even
a
one
-
day
delivery
service
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
that
be
where
we
be
head
and
that
have
to
be
call
out
.
if
we
do
not
stand
up
for
job
in
Cork
and
for
what
could
be
a
viable
business
,
which
could
operate
at
capacity
,
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
a
Post
itself
make
regard
a
significant
rise
in
parcel
volume
,
then
I
think
that
be
a
bad
day
for
the
postal
service
in
this
country
.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
we
have
not
have
sight
of
the
McKinsey
report
.
the
decision
be
not
base
on
the
efficiency
model
.
it
be
more
than
scepticism
.
I
be
advocate
a
more
rigorous
political
examination
of
decision
.
in
accordance
with
standing

we
be
also
support
the
Bill
.
I
wish
to
speak
in
support
of
the
amendment
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
FLAC
on
this
and
its
submission
on
the
Bill
.
with
the
permission
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
I
will
refer
to
its
submission
.
it
state
the
issue
of
the
appointment
of
receiver
to
property
that
be
the
principal
private
residence
of
the
borrower
have
become
contentious
in
recent
month
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
increase
number
of
loan
that
have
be
sell
by
the
pillar
bank
to
investment
and
vulture
fund
.
FLAC
have
note
this
particularly
where
the
borrower
have
,
at
some
point
follow
the
occurrence
of
arrears
,
move
out
of
the
property
and
rent
it
to
a
tenant
in
order
to
stem
the
arrears
problem
and
-
or
attempt
to
resolve
it
.
typically
,
the
borrower
will
move
back
to
he
or
she
original
family
home
or
try
to
source
cheap
accommodation
with
friend
and
relative
.
in
the
case
FLAC
have
see
,
the
borrower
subsequently
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
rent
directly
to
the
lender
and
therefore
the
appointment
of
the
receiver
be
arguably
unnecessary
.
indeed
,
as
the
receiver
be
deem
to
be
the
agent
of
the
mortgagor
or
borrower
under
section
108
(
2
)
of
the
Land
and
Conveyancing
Law
Reform
Act
2009
,
though
appoint
by
the
mortgagee
or
lender
,
the
appointment
of
the
receiver
may
lead
to
less
money
be
pay
to
the
lender
as
the
cost
of
the
receiver
would
be
deduct
from
the
rent
pay
by
the
tenant
to
the
landlord
or
borrower
.
FLAC
believe
that
in
some
of
this
case
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
be
a
prelude
to
evict
the
relevant
tenant
,
obtain
vacant
possession
of
the
property
and
then
sell
it
without
have
to
bring
legal
proceedings
to
the
circuit
Court
to
repossess
it
in
the
normal
manner
envisage
by
the
Act
of
2009
.
this
strategy
rob
a
borrower
who
have
act
in
good
faith
,
have
attempt
to
deal
with
the
arrears
problem
and
have
credible
proposal
to
solve
that
problem
of
the
opportunity
to
convince
a
court
that
the
possession
order
should
not
be
grant
,
and
it
effectively
undermine
the
role
of
the
court
to
administer
justice
.
it
also
undermine
the
intention
of
this
Bill
,
which
be
to
empower
the
circuit
Court
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
such
a
order
be
grant
,
accord
to
a
specific
statutory
criterion
.
the
mortgage
deed
,
accord
to
FLAC
,
will
generally
provide
for
the
power
of
the
lender
to
appoint
a
receiver
on
the
occurrence
of
specific
event
,
include
a
default
in
the
payment
of
instalment
.
this
be
currently
back
up
by
section
108
(
1
)
of
the
act
of
2009
,
which
allow
the
lender
to
appoint
a
receiver
in
the
event
of
arrears
or
other
breach
of
the
agreement
.
no
other
condition
be
impose
on
the
exercise
of
this
right
.
subsection
(
3
)
allow
the
receiver
to
"
exercise
any
power
delegate
by
the
mortgagee
or
other
person
"
.
in
essence
,
we
be
support
the
amendment
on
the
basis
of
the
grounds
set
out
,
where
there
be
a
intervention
whereby
the
mortgagee
may
not
appoint
a
receiver
without
the
permission
of
the
circuit
Court
.
we
believe
this
complement
the
Bill
and
speak
to
the
spirit
of
the
Bill
propose
originally
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Moran
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
support
the
amendment
.
we
have
to
talk
about
this
Bill
in
the
context
of
what
it
mean
for
the
owner
of
family
home
.
take
the
announcement
today
from
Ulster
Bank
regard
its
plan
to
sell
a
€900
million
loan
book
with
3200
home
,
we
can
safely
state
that
common
sense
dictate
that
if
a
property
go
into
receivership
,
then
that
be
a
precursor
to
take
possession
of
the
property
.
this
amendment
merely
seek
to
provide
some
sort
of
a
buttress
to
protect
further
the
family
home
and
it
be
in
keeping
with
the
original
spirit
of
the
Bill
.
it
just
seek
to
add
another
piece
of
equipment
or
another
tool
to
the
Bill
to
protect
the
homeowner
.
I
understand
the
spirit
of
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
come
from
regard
he
intention
in
respect
of
the
Bill
.
we
have
,
however
,
the
ability
within
this
House
to
fast
track
legislation
if
we
so
wish
.
I
do
not
think
that
use
the
defence
of
a
undue
delay
in
regard
to
the
legislation
be
adequate
.
the
amendment
should
be
consider
further
,
particularly
as
it
and
what
it
seek
to
do
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(

,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday

when
I
raise
this
issue
in
November
,
I
believe
I
be
the
first
of
the
Cork
Deputy
to
raise
it
.
I
bring
it
up
again
six
day
ago
.
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
economic
justification
for
the
closure
of
the
Little
Island
mail
centre
in
Cork
.
I
would
like
to
examine
the
justification
for
the
decision
in
great
detail
because
we
have
not
see
a
detailed
justification
.
to
provide
clarity
for
the
proposer
of
the
original
motion
,
we
amendment
seek
clarity
on
the
McKinsey
report
.
the
minister
have
not
come
before
the
House
to
explain
to
we
,
chapter
and
verse
,
what
be
in
the
McKinsey
report
.
we
have
now
hear
from
deputy
Micheál
Martin
about
the
Accenture
report
.
as
the
minister
state
,
McKinsey
and
Company
be
commission
to
do
a
report
in
2016
but
we
do
not
have
sight
of
any
information
on
the
engagement
between
a
Post
and
McKinsey
,
nor
do
we
know
what
recommendation
be
make
arise
from
that
interaction
.
it
be
a
fair
assumption
that
the
Cork
centre
be
not
the
one
that
be
slate
for
closure
.
I
believe
there
be
a
politically
expedient
decision
to
close
Cork
on
the
basis
that
it
be
the
path
of
least
resistance
.
this
process
should
be
stall
pend
a
further
interrogation
by
this
house
in
respect
of
the
decision
that
have
be
make
about
Cork
.
I
say
this
with
some
justification
.
if
the
previous
minister
can
come
before
the
House
and
create
a
scenario
whereby
he
seek
some
sort
of
moral
authority
in
respect
of
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
a
stamp
to
€
1
,
and
if
this
House
give
that
minister
some
impetus
to
do
that
on
the
basis
that
we
want
to
give
a
post
a
fighting
chance
,
then
I
also
believe
that
we
have
the
right
in
this
House
,
give
there
be
a
public
interest
at
stake
,
to
interrogate
the
decision
in
respect
of
Cork
.
I
have
already
rehash
the
argument
in
two
previous
intervention
in
this
house
in
respect
of
the
increase
in
revenue
and
the
loss
of
retail
business
,
so
I
will
not
go
over
they
again
.
however
,
when
revenue
be
increase
,
the
profit
line
be
increase
and
the
company
say
it
be
move
into
the
parcel
business
,
why
would
it
then
hive
off
one
of
the
parcel
centre
as
a
area
of
activity
and
close
it
?
that
do
not
stack
up
and
I
do
not
understand
it
.
notwithstanding
all
of
that
,
a
Post
's
administrative
cost
,
accord
to
its
annual
report
,
have
ramp
up
as
a
percentage
of
sale
and
,
specifically
in
2018
,
go
from
€
55.9
million
to
€
63.9
million
,
which
give
it
a
extra
€
8
million
.
to
quote
directly
from
a
journal
.ie
post
on
17
March
,
in
its
official
rebranding
a
Post
have
spend
€
5
million
,
change
the
colouring
of
its
logo
and
create
a
fictional
millennial
character
call
Ciara
,
and
there
be
a
whole
blurb
about
the
future
direction
of
a
Post
.
therefore
,
in
this
two
example
,
there
be
already
€
13
million
that
we
have
not
have
sight
of
or
have
a
opportunity
to
interrogate
.
yet
,
we
in
this
house
be
expect
to
accept
at
face
value
the
closure
of
a
vital
,
modern
and
relatively
new
centre
.
I
refuse
to
accept
the
justification
for
the
closure
of
this
centre
until
such
time
as
we
have
a
proper
process
by
which
we
can
interrogate
that
decision
on
the
basis
that
there
be
a
public
interest
issue
at
stake
.
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
he
say
to
I
on
the
record
of
the
Dáil
on
20
November
last
year
,
when
I
first
raise
this
issue
,
that
''
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
be
a
public
company
that
have
a
commercial
responsibility
''
.
we
have
the
right
to
interrogate
that
relationship
between
government
and
a
post
on
the
basis
that
we
cannot
accept
a
at
face
value
everything
a
Post
be
tell
we
in
regard
to
rationalisation
of
service
at
a
time
when
its
revenue
be
increase
.
we
want
the
opportunity
to
protect
job
and
to
give
that
worker
a
fight
chance
.
we
need
to
know
exactly
how
much
have
be
pay
to
Accenture
and
to
McKinsey
thus
far
by
a
Post
.
while
it
be
talk
about
savings
and
rationalisation
,
one
could
argue
that
the
spend
on
consultant
and
on
rebranding
would
have
save
any
number
of
job
at
the
Cork
mail
centre
.
I
support
the
motion
.
we
have
put
forward
a
amendment
and
I
have
clarify
the
rationale
behind
it
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
decision

this

I
be
on

try
to
defend
that
worker
on

rational
argument

speak
to
the
issue
of
protect
the
rights
of
victim
in
this
process
.
the
criminal
Justice
(
Victim
of
crime
)
Act
2017
give
victim
a
statutory
right
to
certain
information
.
for
example
,
a
victim
may
request
information
from
a
Garda
Síochána
,
the
Ombudsman
Commission
,
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
,
the
Irish
Prison
Service
,
the
director
of
a
child
detention
school
or
a
clinical
director
of
a
designate
centre
.
the
victim
be
entitle
to
information
on
,
among
other
thing
,
when
a
prisoner
be
expect
to
be
release
from
prison
,
any
temporary
release
of
the
prisoner
or
prison
transfer
.
my
expectation
in
propose
the
amendment
be
that
this
criterion
would
be
add
to
the
Bill
as
one
the
parole
board
would
have
to
take
into
account
.
I
be
not
do
to
die
in
a
ditch
on
the
amendment
.
I
merely
want
to
speak
to
the
issue
.
it
could
be
that
what
I
be
propose
in
the
amendment
be
already
provide
for
in
the
Bill
.
if
not
,
I
would
be
grateful
if
they
could
be
accept
.
what
I
be
try
to
do
be
to
have
a
reference
to
the
impact
on
the
victim
insert
more
firmly
and
unambiguously
into
the
legislation
.
if
my
interpretation
of
the
legislation
thus
far
be
correct
,
the
impact
of
the
granting
of
parole
on
a
victim
be
not
list
as
a
criterion
that
the
board
must
take
into
account
.
the
minister
say
it
be
provide
for
in
general
term
,
but
there
be
no
specific
codicil
or
line
in
that
respect
.
therefore
,
I
be
seek
to
tighten
the
legislation
in
that
regard
.
I
expect
the
minister
to
respond
by
say
he
be
stand
firm
,
which
be
fair
enough
,
but
it
be
my
intention
to
press
the
amendment
.
perhaps
the
originator
of
the
Bill
might
have
a
view
on
this
matter
?
I
thank
deputy
O'Callaghan
.
we
have
to
legislate
on
the
basis
that
there
be
all
type
of
scenario
.
victim
come
in
many
shape
and
guis
,
but
we
have
to
legislate
for
reasonable
grounds
.
victim
be
reference
in
the
parole
Bill
,
but
,
as
I
understand
it
,
they
be
only
to
be
notify
when
a
hearing
be
schedule
to
be
hold
,
rather
than
when
a
application
be
make
.
the
criminal
justice
(
victim
of
crime

act
2017
give
victim
a
statutory
right
to

.
that
be
the
context
in
which
I
be
propose
the
amendment
.
I
have
make
the
argument
which
have
be
defeat
,
which
I
accept
.
I
move
amendment
no.

do

I
ask
the
minister
again
if
he
believe
that
we
have
indulge
Eir
for
long
enough
in
respect
of
the
intervention
that
have
be
make
in
this
house
in
recent
day
.
one
interpretation
of
Eir's
activity
be
that
it
want
to
scupper
the
national
broadband
plan
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
on

my
colleague
,
Senator
Bacik
,
have
already
speak

I
see
no
reason
to
rehearse

comment

in
the
interest
of
brevity
and
to
ensure
we
can
pass
the
Bill
in
the
short
time
available
to
we
,
I
merely
wish
to
seek
further
clarity
on
section
18
(

(

which
state
that
the
personal

be
there
scope
to
consult
as
wide
a
range
of
stakeholder
as
possible
,
include
that
advocate
for
insurance
reform
?
in
a
similar
vein
to
deputy
Ó
Laoghaire
,
I
seek
to
interrogate
further
the
relationship
that
exist
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
person
purchase
a
product
,
such
as
car
or
house
insurance
.
a
thorough
solution
have
not
be
provide
regard
the
increase
in
premium
.
we
have
not
have
complete
transparency
on
the
profit
derive
by
insurance
company
on
this
island
.
that
company
justify
increase
in
premium
by
state
that
there
have
be
a
increase
in
claim
and
the
settlement
of
claim
.
that
need
to
be
further
interrogate
as
well
because
it
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
damage
award
.
I
would
be
grateful
if
the
minister
respond
to
that
in
broad
term
.
my
party
welcome
the
Bill
.
the
minister
should
not
be
so
patronising
.
it
be
a
honest
answer
.
give
that
today
be
4
July
,
it
be
perhaps
apposite
that
I
raise
the
propose
imposition
by
the
US
of
tariff
on
Irish
whiskey
export
.
we
be
tell
by
IBEC
that
this
could
cost
the
whiskey
industry
€
400
million
in
loss
of
export
.
it
be
vital
that
this
issue
be
raise
by
government
with
the
US
Administration
.
I
ask
that
the
government
give
a
commitment
that
Irish
export
of
whiskey
product
to
the
United
State
would
be
protect
and
that
the
government
would
seek
a
exemption
for
Irish
whiskey
sale
from
that
propose
tariff
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I
support
the
report
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
in
respect
of
ward
of
court
.
I
congratulate
the
member
and
the
Chairman
,
deputy
Ó
Caoláin
,
on
the
job
of
work
they
have
do
in
respect
of
the
recommendation
they
have
make
.
I
listen
very
closely
to
the
minister
's
speech
.
if
I
be
listen
to
this
debate
as
a
relative
of
a
ward
of
court
,
I
would
ask
myself
if
I
have
hear
anything
to
give
I
some
semblance
of
hope
for
the
future
in
term
of
the
issue
and
recommendation
that
have
be
air
.
the
answer
to
that
question
be
that
the
jury
be
still
very
much
out
in
term
of
seek
closure
to
many
of
the
issue
raise
in
the
report
.
the
minister
contend
,
in
respect
of
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
,
that
:
[
T
]
he
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
have
advise
that
the
proposal
on
the
audit
of
ward
of
court
fund
by
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
be
incompatible
with
the
constitution
's
architecture
and
be
not
consistent
with
article
33.1
.
the
advice
be
that
wardship
fund
be
not
public
fund
[
that
be
the
key
line
in
that
sentence
]
but
be
subject
to
the
control
and
supervision
of
the
high
Court
.
this
be
essential
obstacle
to
enable
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
to
take
on
responsibility
for
audit
such
fund
.
the
advice
...
be
also
that
legislate
for
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
oversight
of
this
fund
could
undermine
the
independence
of
the
Judiciary
and
the
administration
of
justice
under
article
34.1
and
35.2
of
the
constitution
.
in
the
absence
of
a
alternative
to
that
recommendation
,
I
ask
that
the
government
come
forward
with
a
set
of
proposal
to
ensure
that
this
particular
recommendation
be
address
.
if
we
take
the
advice
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
at
face
value
,
give
that
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
have
endorse
the
position
of
inclusion
Ireland
in
respect
of
that
recommendation
,
some
sort
of
architecture
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
should
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
recommendation
in
respect
of
auditing
be
deal
with
.
this
be
germane
to
the
issue
at
hand
.
there
be
a
responsibility
on
the
government
of
the
day
to
deal
with
this
very
point
.
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
have
make
a
set
of
recommendation
,
which
be
follow
by
a
particular
recommendation
by
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
.
if
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
be
contrary
to
that
recommendation
,
something
have
to
be
put
in
place
to
meet
the
need
of
the
people
who
want
to
see
transparency
in
respect
of
the
auditing
process
.
if
people
perceive
that
there
be
something
wrong
with
the
process
,
that
be
enough
.
the
perception
must
be
deal
with

a
key
point
be
make
by
Inclusion
Ireland
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
it
and
justice
for
Wards
have
do
on
this
.
in
a
email
I
receive
today
,
Inclusion
Ireland
state
that
,
with
regard
to
the
fund
that
be
lose
,
the
committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
ask
for
a
independent
review
to
take
place
,
include
that
fund
identify
by
Justice
for
Wards
.
the
email
further
state
that
the
review
that
take
place
by
Mazar
almost
immediately
after
the

be
publish
look
at

case
,
but
it
be
unclear
whose
case
be
look
at

whether
that
case
be
representative

that
be
why
Inclusion
Ireland
be
call
for
a

this
be
vital
.
it
be

reasonable
request

the
qualitative
relationship

the
culture
that
exist
around

something
that
need

in

mind

there
be
a
serious
lack

that
be
how
they
perceive
it
and
it
have
be
the
experience
of
some
of

matter

very
issue

we

with
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
I
will
read
into
the
record
the
entirety
of
correspondence
I
receive
last
night
from
the
Justice
for
Magdalene
Research
,
JFMR
,
group
.
the
group
state
:
we
in
Justice
for
Magdalene
Research
(
JFMR
)
be
write
to
express
we
concern
about
the
serious
shortcoming
in
the
health
and
social
care
provide
to
Magdalene
survivor
to
date
and
to
suggest
that
the
Dáil
use
this
legislative
opportunity
to
fundamentally
amend
the
Redress
for
woman
Resident
in
certain
Institution
(
RWRCI
)
act
2015
(
in
more
way
than
the
government
propose
)
so
that
the
health
and
social
care
recommend
by
Judge
John
Quirke
in
2013
be
actually
provide
to
all
survivor
under
the
Magdalene
ex
gratia
scheme
.
the
government
's
Bill
simply
seek
to
add
woman
who
work
as
child
in
Magdalene
Laundry
while
register
on
the
roll
of
adjacent
institution
to
the
exist
health
and
social
care
aspect
of
the
Magdalene
ex
gratia
scheme
.
however
,
we
in
JFMR
have
repeatedly
point
out
-
and
we
have
be
join
by
healthcare
professional
in
so
do
-
that
the
care
service
currently
provide
under
the
RWRCI
Act
2015
be
not
compliant
with
judge
John
Quirke
's
recommendation
.
we
have
raise
the
problem
of
healthcare
provision
to
Magdalene
numerous
time
since
the
RWRCI
Act
2015
be
enact
,
include
in
write
to
minister
for
Justice
and
Department
of
Justice
official
[
and
the
letter
go
on
to
quote
various
date
in
that
regard
]
.
on
25th
February
2016
JFMR
write
to
the
National
Director
of
primary
Care
at
the
HSE
to
ask
for
write
clarification
of
all
way
in
which
Magdalene
survivor
's
entitlement
under
the
RWRCI
act
card
differ
from
that
already
available
under
the
standard
medical
card
.
we
receive
a
acknowledgment
letter
on
15th
March
2016
but
have
no
receive
no
substantive
response
to
date
.
I
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Ó
Laoghaire
in
respect
of
dental
,
ophthalmic
and
aural
service
,
psychotherapy
for
survivor
,
access
to
counselling
and
psychotherapy
for
family
member
,
and
access
to
complementary
therapy
.
there
be
issue
in
respect
of
whether
service
as
per
the
recommendation
be
to
be
provide
.
it
be
the
understanding
of
JFMR
that
they
be
not
be
provide
.
give
that
we
have
just
recently
read
the
amendment
,
I
seek
clarification
from
the
minister
and
he
official
on
the
wording
for
the
provision
of
dental
,
ophthalmic
and
aural
service
,
which
will
be
a
addition
to
section
2
,
and
on
referral
make
by
register
medical
practitioner
.
I
also
seek
clarification
in
respect
of
subsection
(
would
)
in
amendment
no.
1
,
which
have
just
be
bring
before
the
House
,
in
respect
of
the
paragraph
relate
to
complementary
therapy
and
such
other
service
as
may
be
prescribe
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
have
regard
to
the
correspondence
that
we
-
and
,
I
presume
,
he
and
he
official
-
receive
last
night
.
will
the
concern
outline
in
the
correspondence
be
address
in
the
context
of
the
amendment
the
minister
have
propose
?
I
may
have
inadvertently
say
there
be
amendment
to
this
Bill
before
the
House
this
evening
but
I
withdraw
that
comment
.
it
be
a
mistake
on
my
part
.
I
accept
the
minister
's
comment
and
thank
he
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
amendment
.
be
it
appropriate
in
ten
second
or
less
to
express
some
gratitude
to
people
?
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
former
deputy
Clare
Daly
in
respect
of
the
Bill
and
the
work
of
Dr.
Jo
Murphy
-
Lawless
,
now
retire
,
who
be
a
excellent
proponent
of
this
legislation
.
there
be
too
many
other
woman
to
mention
.
the
impact
of
the
subject
matter
,
as
articulate
by
people
such
as
Vicky
Conway
in
the
Irish
Times
of
late
,
have
a
tremendous
effect
on
all
of
we
.
I
acknowledge
that
woman
who
have
pass
away
.
we
think
of
they
as
we
promulgate
the
legislation
.
as
a
minister
of
State
,
I
accompany
deputy
Flanagan
,
then
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
throughout
both
iteration
of
the
Stormont
House
talk
.
it
be
perhaps
apposite
that
deputy
Flanagan
be
now
here
as
the
minister
for
justice
implement
some
of
the
outworking
of
that
agreement
through
the
presentation
of
the
legislation
before
the
House
tonight
.
as
part
of
that
process
,
we
look
closely
at
North
-
South
co-operation
at
that
time
.
Stormont
House
be
a
omnibus
agreement
that
deal
with
welfare
,
public
infrastructure
such
as
road
,
north
western
gateway
and
flag
.
most
important
,
it
deal
with
the
very
legacy
issue
we
be
talk
about
tonight
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
.
I
would
have
like
more
consideration
and
briefing
with
official
from
the
Department
of
Justice
and
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
to
receive
great
knowledge
about
the
present
context
in
which
the
legislation
be
be
present
.
that
notwithstanding
,
it
be
vital
that
we
push
on
with
we
commitment
in
that
agreement
and
that
be
why
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
that
the
Garda
Commissioner
can
enter
into
co-operation
agreement
with
non-police
or
law
enforcement
body
outside
the
State
.
whether
it
be
do
on
the
island
of
Ireland
,
with
people
on
the
island
of
Ireland
partake
in
this
process
,
or
whether
we
elicit
the
help
of
external
people
,
we
need
to
deal
with
this
issue
as
they
will
not
go
away
.
legacy
issue
and
matter
,
such
as
the
creation
of
the
historical
investigation
unit
and
the
independent
commission
on
information
retrieval
,
must
all
be
deal
with
.
anything
which
support
that
process
be
worthy
of
support
.
I
reiterate
we
support
of
the
Bill
and
acknowledge
the
word
of
the
minister
on
the
vacuum
in
Northern
Ireland
at
present
and
,
to
be
fair
to
he
,
he
be
one
of
the
architect
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
.
one
be
always
hopeful
that
we
can
reach
some
accommodation
under
the
ambit
of
the
two
government
's
sponsorship
and
that
we
can
get
back
to
a
position
where
we
can
deal
with
this
issue
on
the
ground
through
proper
structure
and
that
haste
be
make
to
set
they
up
that
we
can
move
on
and
deal
with
the
legacy
issue
.
the
Bill
be
part
of
that
process
.
I
would
be
aware
of
any
agreement
.
I
would
be
aware
of
any
agreement
.
I
would
be
aware
of
any

I
would
be
aware

any

I

I
would
be
aware

any
agreement

I
defer
to
my
colleague
from
west
Cork
.
I
speak
on
behalf
of
that
who
have
be
affect
by
this
cut
.
I
hope
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
in
the
House
this
evening
to
say
that
he
be
go
to
reverse
it
.
it
be
a
punitive
measure
which
affect
that
who
do
not
themselves
have
a
strong
voice
.
I
fail
to
understand
the
economic
prerogative
behind
this
cut
.
person
in
this
sector
be
in
what
be
call
a
rehabilitative
phase
,
which
be
design
to
assist
progression
.
for
the
sake
of
€
31.80
per
person
,
it
seem
miserly
and
mean
to
make
cut
affect
people
in
this
category
.
I
hope
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
reverse
this
decision
because
none
of
we
on
this
side
of
the
House
understand
why
it
be
make
in
the
first
instance
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
tell
we
that
the
status
quo
will
remain
and
that
he
have
no
intention
of
reverse
the
cut
.
that
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
I
take
little
comfort
from
he
reply
to
the
effect
that
each
cho
within
the
HSE
's
region
would
have
flexibility
to
redirect
its
own
savings
to
address
local
service
requirement
.
all
of
we
on
this
side
of
the
House
be
use
to
deal
with
the
HSE
at
local
level
and
we
know
that
that
money
will
go
into
the
so
-
call
black
hole
of
Calcutta
.
it
will
not
be
redirect
to
the
people
who
most
need
it
.
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
take
away
from
people
be
the
modicum
of
independence
for
which
they
strive
.
the
payment
represent
that
independence
,
but
it
be
be
swip
from
they
and
give
to
the
cho
.
it
be
a
disgraceful
decision
on
he
part
and
one
that
need
not
have
be
make
.
for
the
sake
of
ensure
equality
within
the
system
,
everyone
should
have
keep
the
right
to
retain
the
payment
.
it
be
very
disappointing
to
hear
the
minister
of
State
say
that
.

I
thank
my
colleague
for
such
brevity
give
the
limited
time
remain
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
and
its
broad
policy
and
principle
.
we
have
all
be
call
for
this
legislation
for
some
time
.
the
minister
have
act
in
haste
over
the
summer
period
and
we
welcome
that
on
the
week
the
Dáil
resume
,
the
Bill
have
be
publish
and
be
before
we
.
I
share
some
of
the
concern
deputy
Rabbitte
outline
in
respect
of
proceedings
before
the
District
Court
,
particularly
in
reference
to
the
wording
in
section
35b
where
a
court
at
District
Court
level
"
shall
consider
whether
to
direct
that
a
guardian
ad
litem
be
appoint
for
a
child
and
the
court
may
by
order
so
direct
"
.
if
I
be
to
read
that
at
face
value
and
read
the
wording
of
the
minister
's
contribution
,
she
clearly
state
there
be
a
presumption
in
favour
of
appoint
the
gal
at
the
District
Court
level
.
the
follow
section
,
section
4
,
outline
the
parameter
by
which
such
a
gal
be
appoint
.
if
I
be
to
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
ensure
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
whether
the
gal
be
appoint
for
the
child
,
it
could
be
argue
that
the
section
35b
provision
,
especially
as
it
relate
to
the
District
Court
appointment
,
should
be
such
that
a
gal
would
de
facto
be
appoint
in
all
case
at
District
Court
level
.
I
be
merely
pose
that
to
the
minister
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
de
facto
it
should
always
be
the
case
.
I
appreciate
the
point
the
minister
be
make
in
respect
of
the
need
for
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
the
guidance
the
judge
have
now
by
which
he
or
she
can
appoint
the
gal
.
I
wonder
about
the
minister
's
justification
in
leave
it
open
in
respect
of
the
District
Court
.
it
be
one
thing
for
the
minister
to
say
there
be
a
presumption
in
favour
of
appointment
.
that
suggest
to
I
that
it
may
or
may
not
happen
,
and
that
depend
very
much
on
the
sitting
judge
on
the
day
.
if
the
sitting
judge
be
hear
any
other
number
of
case
that
be
not
necessarily
family
law
case
or
case
that
require
the
service
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
where
the
judge
,
dare
I
say
it
,
do
not
necessarily
have
a
specialism
in
this
area
,
be
the
minister
leave
a
gap
which
diminish
the
right
of
the
child
?
I
would
like
more
clarity
on
that
point
.
I
be
minded
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
District
Court
in
respect
of
this
issue
and
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
,
but
I
would
like
that
point
clarify
,
particularly
before
Committee
stage
,
because
it
could
determine
whether
we
would
seek
to
amend
it
.
I
will
,
however
,
be
guide
by
the
minister
on
that
point
.
I
seek
clarity
also
on
the
cost
,
budget
and
funding
,
because
if
it
be
the
case
that
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
create
a
executive
office
under
the
auspices
of
Tusla
but
act
separately
within
Tusla
,
within
its
own
silo
,
as
it
be
,
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
the
minister
have
not
speak
to
the
nature
of
the
service
.
we
be
rely
on
the
child
care
law
reporting
project
for
any
utterance
about
the
system
and
how
it
work
.
I
have
never
find
myself
,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
,
attend
any
proceedings
.
we
be
therefore
somewhat
blind
,
as
legislator
,
as
to
how
the
system
work
in
real
time
.
we
be
depend
on
expert
such
as
Carol
Coulter
and
the
child
care
law
reporting
project
.
there
have
be
a
number
of
submission
make
in
respect
of
the
consultation
process
.
I
wish
to
quote
from
one
such
submission
,
which
be
make
by
a
solicitor
in
Cork
.
Mr.
Colm
Roberts
,
a
solicitor
from
the
Law
Centre
in
North
Quay
House
,
make
a
submission
.
under
the
guise
of
the
policy
and
principle
,
he
state
:
"
the
purpose
of
the
service
be
to
benefit
the
child
by
support
the
court
to
make
interest
of
the
child
as
the
paramount
consideration
;
"
I
do
not
believe
the
principle
as
state
be
appropriate
.
I
say
this
as
it
be
my
view
that
the
purpose
of
the
service
should
primarily
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
and
not
as
word
.
the
Guardian
ad
litem'
...
purpose
must
at
all
time
be
to
benefit
the
court
and
its
responsibility
should
be
its
primary
purpose
.
that
purpose
should
not
become
unclear
or
confused
.
it
be
unhelpful
for
the
gal
to
become
a
advocate
in
the
adversarial
process
.
this
issue
be
comment
on
by
a
district
court
judge
in
a
decision
report
recently
in
the
Child
Care
Law
Reporting
Project
...
when
the
gal
become
too
active
a
participant
,
he
/
she
can
alienate
...
[
himself
or
herself
]
from
the
party
and
be
perceive
as
become
part
of
the
problem
rather
than
the
solution
,
thus
undermine
its
value
and
purpose
.
it
be
my
understanding
that
the
gal
be
appoint
by
the
court
to
assist
it
in
be
fully
and
freely
inform
of
the
wish
of
the
child
,
the
circumstance
of
the
case
and
the
potentiality
of
all
viable
option
available
in
the
interest
and
welfare
of
the
child
.
the
court
and
not
the
GAL
must
remain
the
ultimate
arbiter
in
determine
the
rights
of
child
and
parent
in
this
matter
to
ensure
compliance
with
its
statutory
,
constitutional
and
ECHR
duty
.
I
take
that
at
face
value
because
that
be
the
voice
of
somebody
who
have
be
work
at
the
coalface
for
many
year
,
indeed
somebody
who
be
well
know
to
many
of
we
as
a
front
-
line
expert
.
it
be
my
wish
that
there
would
be
clarity
about
the
exact
role
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
in
a
prescriptive
way
enshrine
within
the
primary
legislation
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
on
board
view
such
as
this
because
I
believe
that
it
reflect
a
reasonable
and
rational
view
of
proceedings
and
it
ensure
that
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
the
role
of
the
gal
.
I
ask
the
minister
if
she
would
take
on
board
that
particular
point
or
at
least
,
if
it
be
not
she
view
or
if
it
be
not
she
intention
to
legislate
for
this
submission
,
to
revert
to
we
on
committee
stage
.
finally
,
we
need
to
talk
about
the
budget
,
transparency
and
the
cost
of
the
solicitor
involve
and
of
the
gal
service
.
it
be
my
party
's
view
that
this
need
to
be
enshrine
in
primary
legislation
to
the
point
of
ensure
there
be
a
report
,
for
instance
,
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
to
give
we
transparency
about
the
exact
cost
of
the
service
.
we
have
no
oversight
of
that
.
we
know
exactly
what
Tusla
be
spend
on
legal
fee
.
Tusla
and
the
minister
,
I
be
sure
,
would
have
no
problem
in
break
down
that
cost
.
some
effort
have
be
make
by
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
to
seek
further
information
about
the
true
cost
of
this
service
,
but
it
would
be
useful
for
all
of
we
to
have
sight
of
the
cost
as
that
would
inform
we
as
to
whether
money
be
be
spend
in
a
way
that
ensure
the
child
-
let
we
not
forget
this
be
about
child
and
we
must
keep
a
focus
on
child
-
be
get
the
good
possible
service
.
where
report
be
seek
by
the
court
for
access
to
particular
service
to
be
allocate
to
the
child
,
there
should
be
no
excuse
make
that
the
service
cannot
be
allocate
because
no
budget
be
available
to
provide
service
for
the
child
but
yet
the
gal
-
maybe
I
speak
from
a
point
of
ignorance
here
-
have
cost
for
the
period
of
the
hearing
of
possibly
hundred
or
thousand
of
euro
.
a
recommendation
may
be
make
that
a
service
should
be
provide
for
the
child
,
but
the
child
cannot
get
access
to
the
service
that
would
have
cost
the
same
as
the
gal
because
of
resource
constraint
.
do
the
minister
see
the
point
?
I
reluctantly
propose
the
adjournment
of
the
debate
.
I
reluctantly
propose
the
adjournment
of
the
debate
.
I
reluctantly
propose
the
adjournment
of
the
debate
.
I
do
not
doubt
for
a
minute
that
the
minister
be
sincere
in
what
he
seek
to
do
in
term
of
lead
this
agenda
.
however
,
as
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
and
one
of
the
people
who
contribute
to
produce
the
42
recommendation
that
be
broadly
agree
by
its
member
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
,
I
be
fearful
that
a
tension
be
emerge
between
the
radical
nature
of
some
of
the
recommendation
we
make
and
where
the
government
sit
in
term
of
its
implementation
plan
.
I
be
fearful
that
there
be
a
gap
between
the
climate
action
plan
action
and
the
joint
committee
,
which
be
a
committee
of
this
House
consist
of
representative
of
all
party
and
none
,
and
that
a
tension
be
emerge
between
the
two
.
the
committee
's
report
reflect
the
report
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
,
which
be
radical
in
its
action
but
base
on
common
sense
and
easily
attainable
target
.
I
worry
,
however
,
that
that
target
will
not
be
reach
.
I
hope
the
minister
continue
to
engage
with
the
committee
about
how
its
recommendation
,
couple
with
the
government
's
set
of
recommendation
in
the
climate
action
plan
,
can
be
bring
about
.
in
chapter
1
of
the
committee
's
report
,
we
speak
about
the
need
for
a
new
national
framework
where
new
climate
change
legislation
would
be
enact
in
the
Oireachtas
in
2019
and
about
how
,
with
regard
to
new
governance
structure
,
action
on
climate
action
should
be
consider
a
priority
activity
across
all
of
government
.
we
also
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
new
climate
action
council
to
supersede
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
and
the
establishment
of
a
standing
committee
of
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
minister
speak
to
that
issue
but
the
committee
set
target
.
I
understand
that
there
may
be
difference
of
emphasis
between
what
the
government
will
do
and
what
we
have
recommend
but
target
need
to
be
achieve
.
I
fear
that
we
be
push
action
out
in
this
country
to
2020
,
2021
and
2022
and
that
,
as
every
quarter
go
by
,
we
miss
opportunity
for
real
action
.
I
appreciate
that
the
minister
have
attend
town
hall
meeting
,
include
one
in
Limerick
where
he
announce
that
some
of
the
action
in
the
climate
action
plan
that
would
be
undertake
include
a
new
micro-generation
scheme
,
a
transition
towards
1
million
electric
vehicle
and
a
nationwide
programme
of
home
retrofit
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
objective
will
be
achieve
but
I
fear
that
they
will
not
be
achieve
in
a
timely
fashion
or
even
in
the
manner
set
out
in
the
target
drive
by
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
.
we
have
very
clear
target
relate
to
ensure
the
five
-
yearly
carbon
budget
.
this
would
all
be
include
in
the
legislation
that
be
to
be
agree
in
2019
.
we
also
set
target
by
which
the
renewable
share
of
electricity
generation
would
reach
at
least
70
%
by
2030
and
the
statutory
obligation
on
public
body
would
be
strengthen
to
require
that
they
perform
they
function
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
2050
target
.
we
need
this
target
to
be
set
out
in
very
clear
legislative
term
because
the
action
that
be
so
vital
will
flow
from
this
.
Transport
be
one
of
the
key
thematic
area
on
which
we
need
action
.
in
the
context
of
the
target
of
1
million
electric
vehicle
by
2030
,
if
one
look
at
consumer
behaviour
and
analysis
of
where
people
stand
regard
the
switch
towards
such
vehicle
in
2019
,
one
find
that
there
be
not
enough
charging
point
.
the
totemic
image
which
emerge
over
the
summer
,
purport
to
show
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
charge
he
vehicle
at
a
point
that
have
not
go
live
,
be
most
detrimental
.
it
do
nothing
to
create
the
perception
that
the
government
be
do
anything
in
real
term
to
meet
target
or
install
charging
point
throughout
the
country
.
that
be
the
first
aspect
.
there
be
target
call
for
a
move
from
internal
combustion
engine
to
fully
electric
vehicle
by
2030
.
Consumer
be
look
at
the
price
point
for
this
vehicle
.
they
may
be
willing
to
make
that
transition
,
but
the
price
point
be
still
too
high
.
Range
anxiety
be
still
a
massive
issue
because
there
be
too
few
charging
point
.
the
kernel
of
this
issue
be
behavioural
change
.
if
we
be
to
hit
target
by
2030
and
2050
and
if
climate
action
be
to
mean
anything
,
then
this
all
have
to
be
about
behavioural
change
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
no
rational
person
will
move
from
a
vehicle
that
run
on
petrol
or
diesel
if
the
price
point
for
a
electric
vehicle
be
too
high
-
beyond
the
means
of
most
people
in
this
country
-
or
if
there
be
not
enough
charging
point
.
that
be
why
I
must
go
back
to
the
point
I
make
at
the
outset
about
the
recommendation
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
.
that
target
be
tangible
and
real
.
they
must
drive
behaviour
across
the
Civil
Service
,
among
all
the
stakeholder
and
across
government
to
ensure
we
hit
that
target
in
a
meaningful
way
.
I
hear
the
message
from
the
young
generation
about
where
we
need
to
go
on
climate
action
.
there
be
a
massive
demand
for
behavioural
change
and
radicalism
in
government
.
young
people
do
not
necessarily
look
at
this
as
a
governmental
task
.
they
be
look
to
all
politician
in
this
House
to
act
together
in
a
non-partisan
way
in
order
to
drive
the
change
that
be
need
.
the
minister
refer
to
community
ownership
of
electricity
and
drive
the
grid
with
community
-
base
project
.
I
be
concerned
that
we
could
be
here
this
time
next
year
without
have
make
solid
progress
towards
the
democratisation
of
the
production
of
energy
,
which
would
facilitate
rural
community
in
particular
to
become
involved
in
project
supply
electricity
to
the
grid
.
we
need
action
on
that
and
we
need
it
now
.
I
be
fearful
that
if
it
be
leave
too
much
to
the
committee
,
we
will
not
see
the
radical
action
that
be
necessary
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
be
glad
that
there
be
a
Bill
due
before
the
House
late
that
deal
with
just
transition
.
the
number
of
email
I
have
receive
call
on
we
to
support
this
legislation
have
be
phenomenal
.
there
be
a
mood
among
we
citizen
now
.
they
want
to
see
worker
and
stakeholder
come
together
to
ensure
that
people
in
carbon
-
intensive
industry
can
transition
into
net
zero-
carbon
industry
.
again
,
I
be
fearful
that
we
will
allow
another
three
quarter
or
a
full
year
to
go
by
before
we
do
anything
tangible
to
set
up
a
national
infrastructure
with
tooth
that
can
drive
that
behaviour
.
instead
of
talk
within
this
little
bubble
,
we
must
engage
with
the
stakeholder
who
will
drive
that
just
transition
to
take
carbon
out
of
this
economy
and
we
society
.
I
want
to
be
supportive
of
what
the
minister
and
the
government
be
do
.
however
,
I
be
fearful
that
the
target
set
in
the
Oireachtas
committee
report
be
already
be
miss
.
we
be
head
towards
the
end
of
2019
.
among
that
42
recommendation
be
clear
target
to
be
meet
by
the
end
of
this
year
.
I
be
fearful
that
there
will
be
too
much
slippage
.
we
need
radical
action
and
clear
target
so
that
people
can
get
behind
that
target
and
drive
they
on
.
I
do
not
intend
to
take
my
full
allocation
of
time
.
I
support
the
Bill
.
the
Labour
Party
unambiguously
support
the
Bill
and
we
welcome
it
.
we
believe
that
give
the
level
of
correspondence
we
have
receive
on
the
issue
and
the
level
of
engagement
we
have
have
on
it
,
particularly
with
the
trade
union
movement
,
the
Bill
be
timely
and
worthy
of
we
support
.
I
respectfully
take
issue
with
the
minister
's
open
remark
.
it
appear
he
intention
be
to
curtail
the
Bill
with
the
provision
of
a
money
message
.
we
feel
this
be
a
disappointing
departure
.
it
run
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
and
the
view
and
recommendation
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
.
there
be
a
very
clear
and
unambiguous
determination
in
the
committee
's
report
that
a
just
transition
taskforce
would
be
establish
.
while
the
Bill
do
not
per
se
call
for
a
just
transition
taskforce
it
do
call
for
a
just
transition
commission
.
the
minister
seek
to
use
the
auspices
of
the
National
economic
and
social
Council
,
NESC
,
as
the
mechanism
by
which
many
of
the
issue
contain
the
Bill
would
be
articulate
.
we
see
no
reason
the
minister
could
not
continue
to
use
the
NESC
as
a
valuable
resource
for
the
government
and
ensure
a
policy
direction
that
be
consistent
between
all
of
the
stakeholder
.
the
point
be
that
the
government
be
not
the
sole
stakeholder
or
owner
of
this
agenda
any
more
.
just
like
we
colleague
in
the
UK
House
of
Commons
,
we
must
recognise
there
be
a
shift
of
emphasis
towards
the
Member
of
the
House
and
towards
the
sovereignty
of
Parliament
relative
to
the
power
of
the
executive
.
I
be
a
little
bit
worried
that
the
minister
in
he
statement
seek
to
undermine
the
legislation
.
by
my
interpretation
,
he
have
express
a
opinion
that
the
power
of
the
government
would
be
usurp
by
the
enactment
of
such
legislation
.
the
minister
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
but
this
be
certainly
my
impression
.
we
do
need
coherence
on
the
recommendation
of
the
joint
committee
on
the
very
specific
task
of
establish
a
just
transition
taskforce
in
2019
and
the
intention
of
the
Bill
,
which
be
the
establishment
of
the
commission
.
perhaps
on
committee
stage
we
can
iron
out
some
of
this
potential
difference
.
the
Bill
have
the
potential
to
give
voice
to
the
minister
's
opinion
or
intention
regard
the
use
of
the
NESC
as
a
tool
in
a
complementary
way
to
ensure
we
can
drive
the
agenda
of
a
low
carbon
or
carbon
zero
economy
and
society
.
as
I
have
say
,
I
have
receive
much
correspondence
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
the
Labour
Party
make
the
establishment
of
the
just
transition
taskforce
a
red
line
issue
during
the
course
of
we
deliberation
in
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
.
we
want
to
ensure
there
would
be
no
water
down
of
this
proposal
by
that
on
the
government
side
.
we
want
to
ensure
we
would
give
voice
to
that
stakeholder
in
civil
society
who
feel
strongly
that
they
have
a
voice
that
be
equal
to
that
of
the
government
and
that
the
voice
of
the
citizen
'
assembly
would
be
hear
in
term
of
the
implementation
of
government
policy
.
we
have
no
hesitation
in
support
the
Bill
.
we
will
seek
to
amend
and
strengthen
it
.
by
we
reading
,
the
Bill
set
out
a
very
clear
set
of
function
in
section
5
but
we
be
just
a
little
bit
fearful
that
some
of
the
function
may
not
be
robust
enough
to
ensure
the
idea
of
a
just
transition
be
firmly
fix
in
policy
provision
.
we
argue
for
policy
coherence
between
the
Government
and
the
Oireachtas
with
a
equal
role
between
the
two
.
where
a
legislative
proposal
be
robust
and
worthy
of
enactment
,
it
should
be
support
.
we
have
no
hesitation
in
support
this
legislation
.
we
look
forward
to
work
with
we
colleague
in
the
Green
Party
to
ensure
that
the
people
we
seek
to
represent
on
this
issue
whose
voice
have
make
themselves
hear
since
the
publication
of
this
Bill
and
during
the
citizen
'
assembly
be
accurately
and
robustly
reflect
in
the
legislation
.
I
could
not
agree
more
with
the
minister
.
debate
be
healthy
.
it
be
the
lifeblood
of
this
place
and
the
voter
decide
.
we
will
put
it
to
the
people
.
I
think
I
have
my
poster
design
for
the
upcoming
election
,
which
be
not
that
far
away
.
it
will
be
a
quote
from
the
minister
's
early
contribution
to
the
debate
when
he
say
,
"
this
go
way
beyond
what
be
envisage
.
"
it
do
because
we
need
to
start
think
a
hell
of
a
lot
big
about
what
we
be
do
for
the
climate
.
the
Fine
Gael
mantra
that
the
status
quo
be
good
enough
be
not
good
enough
.
I
really
relish
the
chance
to
come
back
to
the
minister
on
the
specific
concern
he
have
raise
,
to
reassure
he
that
this
be
absolutely
the
right
structure
.
it
be
a
superstructure
but
one
that
be
go
to
work
and
be
relatively
easy
to
introduce
.
the
minister
say
this
ask
a
company
in
advance
to
set
out
a
plan
and
engage
with
stakeholder
and
mediate
.
that
be
exactly
what
we
need
.
that
be
exactly
what
we
do
not
have
at
the
moment
with
Bord
to
Móna
.
as
deputy
Harty
say
,
they
be
try
to
do
this
in
Moneypoint
but
the
business
be
not
there
.
the
status
quo
under
the
Fine
Gael
-
lead
government
be
not
good
enough
and
need
to
change
.
the
minister
say
we
could
do
this
through
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
,
that
we
have
a
exist
structure
.
the
problem
be
that
under
the
legislation
it
be
set
up
to
specialise
in
trade
union
dispute
with
employer
.
it
do
not
have
experience
or
expertise
in
climate
change
or
in
deal
with
community
.
deputy
Harty
and
other
speaker
say
that
when
we
be
do
this
we
need
to
get
the
worker
,
the
community
and
other
business
in
.
we
need
a
community
-
base
stakeholder
's
response
.
as
good
as
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
be
,
it
will
not
deliver
that
.
the
minister
,
along
with
other
,
suggest
that
NESC
should
do
it
.
I
have
the
high
regard
for
NESC
,
which
have
a
critical
role
,
and
in
the
climate
committee
report
we
outline
that
it
would
have
a
specific
role
in
this
and
other
area
,
but
NESC
's
skill
,
good
capability
and
good
addition
in
the
jigsaw
of
piece
we
need
be
in
strategic
policy
.
I
do
not
believe
that
NESC
want
to
get
down
and
dirty
in
a
individual
,
local
dispute
where
it
would
try
to
work
out
what
the
specific
response
should
be
because
that
be
not
its
specialty
.
the
minister
also
mention
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
but
I
know
from
speak
to
its
member
they
be
terrify
by
we
climate
report
because
they
fear
we
be
throw
too
much
on
they
and
they
know
they
do
not
have
adequate
resource
in
the
exist
system
.
moreover
,
the
council
want
to
maintain
the
high
level
strategic
view
in
how
we
make
the
transition
and
do
not
want
to
be
involved
in
dispute
management
resolution
.
the
minister
also
suggest
that
the
government
and
he
Department
could
be
responsible
.
in
the
Department
there
be
probably
approximately
250
official
,
perhaps
50
of
whom
work
in
the
energy
section
,
for
example
.
the
work
require
will
not
just
be
in
energy
,
however
.
it
will
involve
transport
,
agriculture
,
forestry
,
housing
and
a
range
of
area
.
I
know
that
the
official
do
not
have
enough
time
.
they
manage
all
the
European
legislation
,
all
we
legislation
and
all
the
policy
initiative
and
regulation
.
they
be
not
well
place
to
do
it
.
last
but
not
least
,
the
minister
seem
to
indicate
that
the
House
should
do
it
.
while
we
be
well
place
to
write
legislation
,
hold
the
government
to
account
and
consider
the
big
policy
issue
,
the
House
be
the
last
place
that
would
be
appropriate
.
if
one
want
to
find
a
resolution
to
a
thorny
local
issue
,
one
want
to
be
down
the
country
,
wherever
that
be
.
we
hear
it
in
the
case
of
the
midland
,
where
there
be
such
conflicting
view
.
some
people
say
the
answer
concern
burn
biomass
while
other
say
the
answer
be
something
else
.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
we
to
act
in
the
way
the
community
need
,
namely
,
as
a
neutral

service
with
real
expertise
in
mediation
.
mediation
be
not
a
dirty
word
.
on
page
13
of
the
programme
for
government
,
it
be
recognise
the
State
be
not
work
well
and
one
of
the
reason
outline
be
that
it
do
not
consult
well
.
it
have
to
start
listen
,
consult
and
engage
.
I
be
glad
the
minister
be
hold
meeting
throughout
the
country
but
the
problem
cannot
be
resolve
in
a
town
hall
meeting
.
one
need
to
be
in
the
town
for
month
,
tease
through
some
of
the
specific
local
issue
,
which
be
what
the
propose
agency
will
do
.
I
look
forward
to
the
committee
stage
debate
,
even
with
the
sword
of
Damocles
of
no
money
message
hang
over
it
,
to
tease
the
matter
out
with
the
Department
.
do
the
Department
really
believe
it
be
well
place
for
do
it
,
or
do
the
government
really
believe
that
the
Department
of
the
Taoiseach
should
do
it
?
the
latter
Department
have
a
critical
role
.
I
be
supportive
of
the
all
-
of
-
government
action
plan
approach
,
the
new
legislation
we
have
plan
and
all
the
measure
on
which
we
have
agree
.
we
also
agree
,
however
,
that
we
need
a
just
transition
architecture
.
I
have
slightly
different
view
from
my
colleague
,
such
as
on
whether
the
body
should
be
call
a
task
force
.
to
reassure
deputy
Sherlock
,
whose
support
on
the
Bill
I
very
much
appreciate
,
along
with
the
support
we
have
receive
from
trade
union
and
other
,
on
page
17
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
report
it
be
state
the
just
transition
task
force
will
include
a
specialist
mediation
service
for
worker
,
community
and
business
and
that
it
should
make
recommendation
for
action
to
the
government
and
the
party
.
that
be
what
the
Bill
will
do
.
it
provide
for
a
specialist
mediation
service
.
we
have
think
a
great
deal
about
the
structure
outline
.
we
have
seek
advice
from
the
good
lawyer
and
talk
to
all
the
interested
party
that
have
a
good
interest
in
and
knowledge
about
the
matter
.
to
allay
one
of
the
concern
the
minister
outline
,
namely
,
that
the
service
would
be
all
powerful
and
would
not
be
democratic
,
it
will
be
democratic
in
the
sense
that
it
will
be
appoint
in
the
same
way
we
appoint
director
to
the
board
of
RTÉ
and
to
the
inland
Fishery
Board
.
it
will
be
appoint
by
both
the
Government
and
the
Oireachtas
.
it
will
be
representative
,
therefore
,
of
the
House
.
one
matter
keenly
fight
with
trade
union
and
other
be
that
the
commission
's
decision
in
help
to
devise
a
plan
will
not
issue
mandatory
instruction
.
it
be
mediation
,
not
compellability
,
but
it
will
bring
transparency
,
expertise
and
neutrality
.
the
minister
state
we
be
plan
a
agency
that
would
bring
in
all
the
various
actor
but
that
be
what
we
need
in
order
to
ensure
a
good
transition
.
the
Bill
be
technical
and
specific
and
be
only
one
piece
of
the
architecture
.
the
government
oppose
it
because
it
do
not
want
to
lose
control
,
it
could
not
possibly
agree
to
a
Bill
come
from
the
Opposition
and
it
could
not
possibly
support
a
Bill
from
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
but
it
would
make
the
government
work
good
.
it
would
be
useful
for
the
Department
to
have
it
rather
than
everyone
run
after
a
problem
like
that
of
Bord
to
Móna
,
after
the
fact
.
it
would
be
think
three
or
five
year
ahead
about
where
will
be
the
next
bord
to
Móna
problem
down
the
line
.
it
will
allow
we
to
set
up
the
system
here
and
now
in
advance
,
instead
of
the
usual
reactive
response
to
cris
when
we
turn
up
too
late
.
we
need
to
get
in
early
and
engage
all
the
party
.
it
will
not
be
expensive
.
we
be
not
talk
about
a
large
organisation
but
rather
small
team
of
mediator
with
specialist
capability
and
with
the
legislative
structure
to
empower
they
.
compellability
be
need
.
I
hear
tonight
that
the
ESB
be
not
talk
to
the
worker
at
the
Moneypoint
plant
.
everyone
I
speak
to
in
Bord
to
Móna
have
state
the
process
be
not
work
there
either
.
if
a
single
person
think
differently
about
the
Bord
to
Móna
transition
issue
,
I
would
love
to
hear
about
it
but
the
word
on
the
ground
be
the
current
system
-
the
status
quo
-
be
not
work
.
the
Bill
go
beyond
what
be
envisage
because
we
envisage
a
massive
change
to
we
entire
transport
,
energy
,
waste
and
industrial
system
.
that
be
what
the
climate
striker
tomorrow
demand
.
they
say
they
listen
to
that
Swedish
girl
and
that
the
science
be
so
clear
and
true
about
the
scale
of
the
change
require
.
we
have
430
gigatonne
remain
but
we
use
41
gigatonne
a
year
.
in
eight
year
,
we
will
be
over
the
tipping
point
.
it
will
be
such
change
and
we
need
to
envisage
it
and
how
we
plan
and
prepare
for
it
.
the
Bill
will
do
that
in
a
just
way
.
it
will
bring
social
and
ecological
justice
together
,
which
be
what
we
need
to
do
.
I
look
forward
to
committee
stage
.
I
could
not
agree
more
with
the
minister
.
debate
be
healthy
.
it
be
the
lifeblood
of
this
place
and
the
voter
decide
.
we
will
put
it
to
the
people
.
I
think
I
have
my
poster
design
for
the
upcoming
election
,
which
be
not
that
far
away
.
it
will
be
a
quote
from
the
minister
's
early
contribution
to
the
debate
when
he
say
,
"
this
go
way
beyond
what
be
envisage
.
"
it
do
because
we
need
to
start
think
a
hell
of
a
lot
big
about
what
we
be
do
for
the
climate
.
the
Fine
Gael
mantra
that
the
status
quo
be
good
enough
be
not
good
enough
.
I
really
relish
the
chance
to
come
back
to
the
minister
on
the
specific
concern
he
have
raise
,
to
reassure
he
that
this
be
absolutely
the
right
structure
.
it
be
a
superstructure
but
one
that
be
go
to
work
and
be
relatively
easy
to
introduce
.
the
minister
say
this
ask
a
company
in
advance
to
set
out
a
plan
and
engage
with
stakeholder
and
mediate
.
that
be
exactly
what
we
need
.
that
be
exactly
what
we
do
not
have
at
the
moment
with
Bord
to
Móna
.
as
deputy
Harty
say
,
they
be
try
to
do
this
in
Moneypoint
but
the
business
be
not
there
.
the
status
quo
under
the
Fine
Gael
-
lead
government
be
not
good
enough
and
need
to
change
.
the
minister
say
we
could
do
this
through
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
,
that
we
have
a
exist
structure
.
the
problem
be
that
under
the
legislation
it
be
set
up
to
specialise
in
trade
union
dispute
with
employer
.
it
do
not
have
experience
or
expertise
in
climate
change
or
in
deal
with
community
.
deputy
Harty
and
other
speaker
say
that
when
we
be
do
this
we
need
to
get
the
worker
,
the
community
and
other
business
in
.
we
need
a
community
-
base
stakeholder
's
response
.
as
good
as
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
be
,
it
will
not
deliver
that
.
the
minister
,
along
with
other
,
suggest
that
NESC
should
do
it
.
I
have
the
high
regard
for
NESC
,
which
have
a
critical
role
,
and
in
the
climate
committee
report
we
outline
that
it
would
have
a
specific
role
in
this
and
other
area
,
but
NESC
's
skill
,
good
capability
and
good
addition
in
the
jigsaw
of
piece
we
need
be
in
strategic
policy
.
I
do
not
believe
that
NESC
want
to
get
down
and
dirty
in
a
individual
,
local
dispute
where
it
would
try
to
work
out
what
the
specific
response
should
be
because
that
be
not
its
specialty
.
the
minister
also
mention
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
but
I
know
from
speak
to
its
member
they
be
terrify
by
we
climate
report
because
they
fear
we
be
throw
too
much
on
they
and
they
know
they
do
not
have
adequate
resource
in
the
exist
system
.
moreover
,
the
council
want
to
maintain
the
high
level
strategic
view
in
how
we
make
the
transition
and
do
not
want
to
be
involved
in
dispute
management
resolution
.
the
minister
also
suggest
that
the
government
and
he
Department
could
be
responsible
.
in
the
Department
there
be
probably
approximately
250
official
,
perhaps
50
of
whom
work
in
the
energy
section
,
for
example
.
the
work
require
will
not
just
be
in
energy
,
however
.
it
will
involve
transport
,
agriculture
,
forestry
,
housing
and
a
range
of
area
.
I
know
that
the
official
do
not
have
enough
time
.
they
manage
all
the
European
legislation
,
all
we
legislation
and
all
the
policy
initiative
and
regulation
.
they
be
not
well
place
to
do
it
.
last
but
not
least
,
the
minister
seem
to
indicate
that
the
House
should
do
it
.
while
we
be
well
place
to
write
legislation
,
hold
the
government
to
account
and
consider
the
big
policy
issue
,
the
House
be
the
last
place
that
would
be
appropriate
.
if
one
want
to
find
a
resolution
to
a
thorny
local
issue
,
one
want
to
be
down
the
country
,
wherever
that
be
.
we
hear
it
in
the
case
of
the
midland
,
where
there
be
such
conflicting
view
.
some
people
say
the
answer
concern
burn
biomass
while
other
say
the
answer
be
something
else
.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
we
to
act
in
the
way
the
community
need
,
namely
,
as
a
neutral
specialist
service
with
real
expertise
in
mediation
.
mediation
be
not
a
dirty
word
.

of
the
Irish
Suckler
Beef
Sector
.
my
own
area
of
Cork
be
predominantly
a
dairy
sector
and
be
probably
more
protect
from
the
vagary
of
the
market
than
the
Border
,
midland
and
west
region
to
which
other
speaker
have
refer
.
the
report
set
out
a
clear
challenge
regard
where
the
suckler
beef
sector
will
see
itself
in
a
number
of
year
.
page
66
of
the
report
concern
move
afoot
to
replace
suckler
beef
with
dairy
beef
.
I
will
quote
from
the
report
because
it
be
worth
consider
the
academic
view
on
this
.
section
7.4
state
that
:
it
be
expect
that
the
dairy
sector
will
continue
to
grow
,
and
as
such
a
increase
share
of
the
output
of
the
beef
sector
will
be
comprise
of
dairy
-
breed
beef
.
some
believe
that
the
threat
of
a
contract
suckler
cow
herd
can
be
offset
by
the
potential
to
replace
this
sector
with
dairy
-
breed
beef
.
however
,
for
other
there
be
concern
about
whether
rear
dairy
calve
be
a
appropriate
substitute
for
suckle
farming
.
single
suckling
sell
weanling
be
the
most
common
production
system
in
the
west
of
Ireland
.
typically
,
calve
remain
graze
with
the
cow
and
be
sell
once
wean
.
this
calve
be
typically
purchase
by
farmer
with
good
production
condition
and
possibly
base
in
a
good
climate
,
and
be
then
fatten
.
single
suckling
sell
weanling
farm
may
not
have
the
land
type
,
housing
facility
and
/
or
husbandry
skill
to
finish
dairy
animal
.
Anecdotal
evidence
suggest
that
,
despite
a
number
of
campaign
to
promote
dairy
calf
rearing
in
the
west
of
Ireland
,
uptake
have
be
very
slow
.
it
remain
to
be
see
whether
dairy
beef
can
be
a
viable
alternative
to
suckler
farming
in
marginal
area
.
in
speak
to
that
point
,
it
be
important
that
we
do
not
forget
that
there
be
regional
variation
and
that
in
certain
area
,
farmer
must
specialise
in
suckle
farming
because
of
the
condition
that
apply
there
.
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
that
farm
family
need
to
earn
a
income
,
put
food
on
the
table
and
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
note
,
give
they
child
the
option
of
continue
in
farming
.
they
must
have
a
proper
price
for
they
product
.
they
can
not
be
merely
price
taker
.
we
also
welcome
the
recent
move
regard
price
but
we
feel
strongly
that
the
government
must
play
a
more
active
part
in
ensure
that
there
be
great
communication
between
all
the
stakeholder
in
a
co-ordinate
and
organised
way
that
recognise
the
regional
variation
that
exist
as
they
relate
to
that
people
who
rely
on
the
suckler
beef
sector
.
the
regional
spread
of
the
agrifood
sector
mean
that
it
underpin
the
socioeconomic
development
of
rural
area
,
in
particular
.
for
example
,
more
than
half
of
all
Irish
farmer
be
locate
in
the
Border
,
midland
and
west
region
with
around
a
quarter
of
farmer
be
over
the
age
of
65
.
statistic
from
the
government
point
to
job
creation
in
the
capital
in
the
area
of
finance
or
it
do
little
to
compensate
that
farmer
leave
to
deal
with
the
consequence
of
a
no
-deal
Brexit
.
simply
put
,
this
region
will
need
real
support
to
transition
through
whatever
crisis
might
come
down
the
line
.
they
be
already
at
crisis
point
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
government
have
fail
to
provide
the
necessary
support
and
funding
to
the
sector
and
rural
Ireland
over
the
past
three
year
.
its
fail
management
of
two
programme
,
one
of
which
be
fully
fund
by
the
EU
with
the
other
be
co-fund
,
demonstrate
this
fact
.
the
leader
programme
2014
-
2020
,
which
be
a
key
driver
for
rural
development
,
consist
of
€250
million
with
regard
to
project
relate
to
rural
environment
,
social
inclusion
and
economic
development
yet
with
less
than
16
month
until
the
deadline
.
at
a
time
of
deep
turbulence
for
rural
Ireland
,
less
than
40
%
of
the
total
funding
have
be
distribute
so
far
.
this
be
all
major
funding
line
that
have
a
significant
impact
in
that
marginal
area
and
on
the
marginal
income
,
to
which
I
refer
early
.
there
need
to
be
a
more
co-ordinate
approach
at
government
level
.
in
echo
the
call
of
the
motion
,
we
agree
that
introduce
a
framework
for
producer
group
be
necessary
to
ensure
a
critical
mass
of
farmer
come
together
to
facilitate
price
negotiation
.
in
addition
,
fix
-
price
contract
must
be
explore
,
as
propose
by
the
motion
,
because
the
farmer
take
all
the
risk
.
if
a
farmer
have
a
fix
-
price
contract
,
he
or
she
know
what
he
or
she
will
get
.
it
be
a
fix
price
that
a
farmer
can
take
to
the
bank
,
so
to
speak
.
Irrespective
of
currency
devaluation
,
fluctuation
or
market
condition
,
the
farmer
know
that
there
be
certainty
.
it
provide
a
safety
net
.
it
would
involve
share
the
risk
between
processor
and
producer
or
farmer
but
it
would
provide
farmer
with
reassurance
and
provide
great
market
stability
.
we
support
the
motion
.
we
strongly
believe
that
there
need
to
be
a
great
interrogation
of
the
dynamic
within
the
suckler
sector
.
the
report
from
which
I
quote
provide
a
strong
basis
for
this
.
it
state
in
its
conclusion
:
despite
the
economic
significance
of
the
suckler
cow
sector
,
the
grave
and
difficult
economic
situation
at
the
farm
level
be
a
major
weakness
.
the
very
low
market
price
relative
to
production
cost
mean
that
this
large
farm
sector
be
almost
entirely
reliant
on
direct
payment
.
this
obviously
make
the
sector
,
and
indeed
the
entire
supply
chain
,
extremely
vulnerable
in
light
of
the
propose
cut
to
the
CAP
budget
.
any
negative
price
shock
arise
from
threat
such
as
Brexit
or
international
trade
deal
will
exacerbate
the
economic
situation
at
the
farm
level
make
farmer
even
more
reliant
on
payment
.
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
to
ensure
the
viability
of
the
sector
in
this
country
,
but
this
be
a
starting
point
,
and
on
that
basis
we
be
support
the
motion
.
I
thank
all
the
speaker
who
support
we
motion
and
who
come
and
give
of
they
time
.
disappointment
have
be
express
about
many
who
do
not
come
.
Agriculture
be
we
primary
industry
and
we
must
mind
it
.
I
learn
a
great
deal
during
the
time
of
the
protest
and
it
be
not
just
the
blockade
in
Cahir
where
I
be
much
of
the
time
.
I
thank
Bob
Wilkinson
,
a
man
in
he
80s
,
young
Daniel
Long
,
and
Alison
de
Vere
Hunt
,
who
travel
to
Dublin
for
the
talk
and
who
be
not
treat
nicely
in
the
minister
's
Department
.
I
have
say
that
to
he
before
.
I
also
thank
Superintendent
Denis
Whelan
,
the
gardaí
in
Cahir
Garda
station
,
and
the
worker
who
go
in
and
out
of
the
factory
and
be
so
peaceful
and
respectful
of
what
be
go
on
.
many
of
they
bring
food
to
feed
the
farmer
and
they
family
.
I
thank
the
many
company
that
bring
food
and
the
many
woman
who
bake
scone
and
apple
tart
and
cream
.
there
be
a
joyous
atmosphere
there
.
the
weather
be
great
.
it
go
on
long
than
it
should
have
.
we
should
not
have
have
to
have
be
there
because
this
crisis
have
be
come
.
the
minister
sleepwal
into
it
.
when
we
get
the
mandate
to
talk
to
Fine
Gael
about
the
programme
for
government
and
we
agree
to
include
the
issue
of
producer
organisation
,
the
government
do
nothing
about
it
.
as
deputy
Michael
Healy
-
Rae
and
other
have
say
,
this
be
a
Dublin
-
centric
government
.
the
Taoiseach
,
who
should
be
sit
where
the
minister
be
now
,
say
that
we
must
eat
less
beef
.
be
that
a
man
to
be
head
we
country
?
we
know
what
he
interest
be
.
deputy
Healy
-
Rae
be
right
to
point
that
out
.
time
and
again
the
government
be
warn
.
in
recent
day
when
my
colleague
and
other
be
work
very
hard
to
get
the
gate
open
and
the
cattle
go
in
,
there
be
rumour
that
Meat
Industry
Ireland
,
MII
,
meet
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
to
get
the
Garda
to
move
the
rest
of
the
people
away
.
we
be
negotiate
,
and
while
I
acknowledge
the
minister
take
a
phone
call
from
one
of
the
Healy
-
Rae
brother
on
Saturday
to
try
to
get
it
stand
down
,
he
do
not
take
a
phone
call
or
a
text
from
I
at
the
start
of
the
protest
.
he
ignore
it
and
hope
it
would
go
away
.
he
be
on
he
holiday
and
want
to
stay
on
he
holiday
.
he
could
be
on
holiday
every
day
because
this
be
the
most
useless
,
toothless
and
fruitless
government
that
ever
sit
in
this
Chamber
.
it
have
no
respect
for
rural
Ireland
,
no
respect
for
to
None
beaga
or
for
any
of
the
organisation
,
although
some
be
too
cosy
with
the
government
.
MII
place
injunction
on
the
Beef
Plan
Movement
,
which
have
to
go
to
ground
.
then
the
government
tell
we
it
have
no
one
to
talk
to
.
independent
Farmers
of
Ireland
come
forward
and
send
people
to
talk
and
,
thankfully
,
we
be
where
we
be
.
the
minister
cobble
together
a
agreement
.
it
be
a
tús
maith
.
it
be
a
good
start
and
we
have
to
work
to
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
that
all
the
stakeholder
,
all
the
usual
suspect
,
will
be
put
onto
this
task
force
.
I
do
not
want
all
the
stakeholder
.
they
can
meet
the
minister
every
day
of
the
week
,
Bord
Bia
,
Teagasc
,
and
Department
official
.
this
should
involve
mii
,
with
a
truly
independent
chairperson
-
someone
like
Kieran
Mulvey
.
he
do
not
have
to
know
agriculture
.
the
less
he
know
about
it
the
good
.
he
be
someone
who
will
not
be
fool
or
have
the
wool
pull
over
he
eye
.
it
have
to
include
the
farming
group
,
Veterinary
Ireland
,
and
MII
,
and
it
must
have
standard
.
there
should
be
no
threaten
.
it
be
shameful
to
say
that
Mr.
Healy
from
my
own
county
be
use
bully
-
boy
tactic
and
incense
farmer
when
I
see
the
farmer
and
the
worker
salute
one
another
and
give
tea
and
whatever
else
.
I
sympathise
with
the
worker
who
lose
they
job
or
who
be
temporarily
lay
off
.
that
should
not
have
happen
.
I
be
a
employer
,
like
deputy
Michael
Healy
-
Rae
,
deputy
Michael
Collins
,
and
many
more
.
we
would
keep
we
worker
for
a
few
week
certainly
.
where
be
the
good
faith
and
the
goodwill
?
one
day
when
I
be
there
,
a
lorry
with
a
40
ft
container
arrive
and
a
vet
come
to
plead
with
the
lad
to
let
he
in
to
inspect
it
.
he
tell
we
that
be
Polish
beef
go
into
the
factory
.
it
leave
.
three
week
late
another
lorry
come
and
we
be
tell
it
be
a
load
of
pork
.
that
lorry
be
follow
because
bring
in
pork
from
Poland
be
dangerous
due
to
swine
flu
and
other
infection
.
that
would
have
be
devastating
.
everyone
at
the
gate
be
film
by
powerful
camera
all
day
and
night
.
as
if
that
be
not
bad
enough
,
some
of
the
lad
come
out
of
the
factory
to
intimidate
the
protester
and
make
video
.
we
be
all
tell
we
be
catch
on
video
.
that
lorry
be
follow
.
I
know
where
it
go
.
it
come
back
say
it
go
to
the
wrong
factory
.
I
want
the
minister
to
investigate
that
issue
.
that
could
cause
unbelievable
damage
.
it
be
reckless
.
we
do
not
know
what
be
go
into
the
meat
.
one
thing
that
have
come
out
of
this
protest
be
that
the
public
have
get
a
great
understanding
of
how
the
farmer
be
be
blackguard
,
when
the
fact
be
put
on
the
poster
that
only
2.6
%
of
the
€
10
go
to
the
farmer
and
what
else
go
to
the
retailer
and
the
factory
.
where
do
the
fifth
quarter
go
?
I
salute
Mr.
Seamus
Maye
and
the
fabulous
investigation
of
the
fifth
quarter
he
have
carry
out
.
the
problem
in
that
regard
be
staggering
.
the
government
allow
a
certain
mogul
in
the
industry
to
take
control
of
offal
only
a
couple
of
year
ago
.
every
bit
of
offal
be
control
by
a
big
beef
baron
and
nobody
else
can
go
anywhere
with
any
of
it
.
when
individual
plant
be
make
deal
because
they
want
to
get
go
and
fulfil
they
contract
,
as
we
all
do
,
the
heavy
hand
come
in
again
.
the
mogul
rule
.
the
big
beef
baron
in
the
country
-
everyone
know
who
I
mean
-
say
the
plant
could
not
sell
they
offal
and
instead
could
dump
it
wherever
they
like
.
such
cop
-on
have
be
allow
.
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
be
a
disgrace
.
it
have
do
nothing
but
tell
farmer
they
could
not
negotiate
the
price
.
what
be
the
authority
mean
to
be
?
if
I
be
run
a
business
up
a
boreen
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
be
do
something
to
cause
unfair
competition
,
the
authority
would
fine
I
and
close
I
down
.
it
will
not
touch
the
people
I
have
outline
,
however
,
because
there
be
too
much
money
involve
,
too
much
big
business
and
too
many
people
who
be
friend
with
one
another
when
they
be
grow
up
.
the
IFA
have
give
the
government
a
easy
ride
in
the
past
eight
year
.
of
course
it
have
,
give
that
most
of
its
member
be
in
the
government
's
party
.
fair
due
to
the
beef
industry
of
Ireland
and
independent
farmer
.
circumstance
have
change
and
will
never
be
the
same
because
the
genie
be
out
of
the
bottle
and
people
know
what
be
go
on
.
they
know
that
farmer
have
be
blaggard
.
when
the
animal
be
put
in
the
trailer
,
as
deputy
Michael
Healy
-
Rae
note
,
farmer
tend
to
it
.
if
the
cow
be
inseminate
,
farmer
nurture
the
little
calve
,
work
with
the
cow
the
whole
way
and
look
after
it
.
they
be
accuse
of
all
kind
of
bad
practice
but
they
look
after
they
animal
and
respect
they
,
they
land
and
they
family
.
all
they
want
be
a
fair
price
for
they
work
,
rather
than
cartel
be
form
,
money
be
creame
off
elsewhere
,
and
the
blaggarding
that
be
go
on
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
insist
that
the
Cahir
factory
be
reopen
.
everything
be
allow
in
by
the
protestor
except
cattle
or
beef
,
while
cattle
be
allow
in
for
the
Chinese
visit
.
of
course
the
Chinese
delegation
be
allow
in
because
it
would
have
be
reckless
otherwise
,
and
meat
be
allow
out
when
it
have
to
be
bring
out
.
all
the
maintenance
crew
be
allow
in
to
keep
the
factory
ready
and
in
pristine
condition
,
but
now
we
be
tell
it
will
take
a
couple
of
week
in
some
place
to
start
kill
again
.
that
be
blaggarding
and
it
must
stop
.
the
power
must
be
give
back
to
the
producer
.
what
be
we
here
for
?
rural
Ireland
will
be
wipe
out
.
as
have
be
note
,
with
all
that
be
take
away
from
we
,
we
will
lose
beef
farmer
and
producer
.
they
spend
every
penny
in
the
rural
economy
,
in
the
school
,
shop
,
GAA
club
and
the
whole
lot
.
Ní

what
be
we
try
to
do
under
the
government
?
it
be
a
disgrace
how
it
have
treat
everyone
else
.
any
small
person
be
in
the
way
.
it
be
all
about
the
large
supermarket
,
Larry
Goodman
and
company
,
and
the
rest
of
they
,
and
to
hell
with
to
None
beaga
.
the
government
do
not
want
they
at
all
.
it
should
go
back
to
its
root
.
it
will
have
to
go
back
soon
enough
look
for
vote
and
will
find
out
the
hard
way
.
I
thank
the
gardaí
and
everyone
in
Cahir
who
help
to
keep
the
peace
,
normal
trading
and
the
work
go
on
,
even
though
some
people
be
turf
out
.
we
be
on
the
cusp
of
a
settlement
in
Cahir
on
Monday
,
16
September
but
it
do
not
happen
,
although
it
should
have
.
we
be
again
on
the
cusp
on
Wednesday
,
18
September
,
when
most
of
the
farmer
who
want
to
stand
down
walk
away
.
a
group
stay
on
,
as
be
they
prerogative
.
the
factory
know
on
Thursday
that
the
matter
would
be
settle
on
Friday
but
what
do
it
do
?
it
announce
another
100
job
loss
on
Friday
morning
.
it
be
such
contempt
,
such
wave
,
teasing
and
mocking
of
the
protestor
.
the
factory
have
a
monopoly
for
35
year
and
it
get
away
with
it
,
since
Charlie
Haughey
bail
it
out
and
leave
it
alone
.
at
least
he
make
beef
deal
and
with
the
Purcells
sell
export
to
Libya
.
he
do
something
for
the
country
and
do
the
State
some
service
,
but
the
government
have
do
nothing
.
it
have
watch
it
be
destroy
,
rural
Ireland
be
decimate
and
farmer
be
drive
to
protest
this
week
,
but
for
several
week
the
minister
would
not
even
engage
.
when
he
do
engage
at
first
,
he
have
mii
dictate
what
would
happen
,
who
could
be
in
the
room
and
under
what
condition
.
it
be
time
the
mask
be
remove
from
MII
and
that
it
respect
producer
.
many
worker
at
the
factory
be
annoyed
at
what
happen
and
some
of
they
be
annoyed
with
I
,
which
I
fully
accept
.
they
be
entitle
to
be
,
give
that
I
be
in
the
middle
.
if
we
do
not
have
producer
,
the
worker
would
not
be
keep
at
the
factory
.
that
be
what
we
do
not
see
in
the
picture
.
I
watch
a
wonderful
exposé
on
RTÉ
last
night
about
what
happen
at
the
atrocious
event
in
County
Cavan
.
it
be
time
that
RTÉ
and
the
rest
of
the
media
broadcast
a
exposé
on
what
be
take
place
with
the
cartel
in
the
beef
business
.
it
be
beyond
time
but
it
will
not
happen
,
as
it
will
not
in
the
case
of
the
multiple
,
because
as
we
see
when
we
open
the
Sunday
newspaper
,
there
be
page
and
page
of
advertisement
.
money
talk
.
it
be
time
the
minister
answer
the
question
about
beef
from
Poland
and
,
bad
again
,
the
pork
from
Poland
.
do
it
come
into
Cahir
and
,
if
so
,
why
?
what
be
happen
in
that
regard
?
we
demand
respect
.
we
do
not
want
a
taskforce
with
all
the
usual
suspect
take
up
place
,
eat
they
dinner
and
take
up
time
.
we
want
the
producer
,
farm
family
,
the
organisation
and
MII
.
there
must
be
a
independent
regulator
,
with
tooth
and
power
,
and
it
must
gain
respect
.
respect
have
to
be
earn
and
he
or
she
who
earn
it
will
get
it
.
previously
,
the
regulator
be
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
.
I
do
not
know
the
man
but
how
could
he
be
independent
?
he
be
not
independent
.
we
want
independence
on
the
taskforce
.
we
in
the
rural
independent
Group
,
en
masse
day
in
,
day
out
,
will
call
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
the
taskforce
be
meaningful
,
and
that
it
will
have
respect
and
tooth
.
we
will
not
be
fob
off
.
the
fobbing
-
off
be
over
,
as
the
minister
will
soon
learn
.
I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Michael
Fitzmaurice
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
.
there
be
nothing
injurious
to
anybody
's
interest
in
this
good
and
broad
motion
.
anybody
with
any
shred
of
common
sense
would
support
what
it
seek
to
address
.
across
the
party
-
political
spectrum
,
it
be
clear
the
issue
of
forestry
be
at
the
forefront
of
the
political
agenda
and
there
be
various
way
in
which
we
can
maximise
the
potential
of
the
industry
.
we
must
be
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
it
support
more
than
12,000
job
across
the
country
and
it
be
a
sequester
of
carbon
but
it
be
not
a
perfect
model
and
more
work
need
to
be
do
.
the
motion
could
be
strengthen
if
the
minister
look
at
the
forestry
implementation
group
because
it
be
probably
top
heavy
with
forestry
industry
stakeholder
and
there
be
not
enough
voice
from
the
environmental
pillar
.
that
be
not
to
any
way
diminish
that
on
it
.
however
,
if
we
be
to
have
a
serious
conversation
about
future
forestry
policy
,
ensure
there
be
a
increase
in
forestry
scheme
with
great
broadleaf
cover
,
conservation
measure
and
rewilding
,
we
need
to
find
a
mechanism
to
ensure
view
,
as
express
by
the
Green
Party
's
motion
,
find
some
articulation
.
this
must
continue
to
a
policy
that
involve
rural
dweller
,
key
stakeholder
and
not
just
the
usual
suspect
.
I
do
not
use
that
latter
term
in
any
derogatory
way
.
however
,
the
conversation
on
forestry
policy
have
always
be
through
the
prism
of
Coillte
and
the
timber
industry
.
that
need
to
be
broaden
.
there
be
a
clear
call
for
that
in
the
House
tonight
.
will
the
minister
give
serious
consideration
to
ensure
the
forestry
implementation
group
be
broaden
to
hear
more
voice
and
proactively
work
with
the
government
to
change
forestry
policy
?
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
visit
Glennon
Brother
,
the
timber
product
manufacturer
,
recently
with
other
Cork
Deputy
and
the
minister
.
I
go
in
with
some
prejudice
about
the
timber
industry
before
that
meeting
.
I
certainly
come
out
of
the
meeting
very
much
assure
by
the
fact
that
there
be
people
in
the
industry
like
Glennon
Brother
who
want
to
engage
with
all
stakeholder
,
the
ngo
and
the
environmental
pillar
on
what
we
forestry
policy
should
look
like
in
the
future
.
if
there
be
proactive
and
progressive
people
within
the
timber
industry
-
IBEC
be
do
some
work
on
this
-
who
be
willing
to
engage
in
a
meaningful
way
,
and
not
just
be
at
the
table
for
the
sake
of
it
,
and
ensure
people
's
voice
hear
,
we
need
to
grasp
that
nettle
.
I
support
the
motion
but
the
conversation
need
to
be
broaden
.
the
government
need
to
take
seriously
the
recommendation
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
's
report
in
respect
of
forestry
and
afforestation
measure
because
that
be
a
cross-party
report
with
more
than
40
recommendation
arise
from
the
citizen
's
Assembly
.
to
date
,
if
I
be
be
objective
about
it
,
the
recommendation
of
that
all
-
party
report
be
quickly
gather
dust
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
3
October
2019
.
I
support
the
legislation
.
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
on
13
November
2018
and
I
will
give
the
reference
number
for
the
information
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
official
.
it
be
question
no.
277
,
reference
number
46967/18
.
in
it
I
ask
specifically
about
the
number
of
record
knife
crime
in
the
country
.
I
subsequently
receive
correspondence
from
the
CSO
,
specifically
from
the
crime
and
criminal
justice
statistic
section
.
it
state
:
the
Central
Statistics
Office
,
CSO
,
have
take
the
decision
to
resume
publication
of
record
crime
statistic
under
a
new
category
entitle
statistic
under
reservation
.
this
categorisation
indicate
the
quality
of
the
statistic
do
not
meet
the
standard
require
of
the
official
statistic
publish
by
the
CSO
.
please
see
the
attach
explanatory
link
…
knife
crime
would
have
be
for
crime
incident
where
it
have
be
indicate
that
a
knife
be
use
via
the
modus
operandi
,
mo
,
datum
field
.
the
CSO
would
have
concern
that
figure
generate
in
this
way
could
understate
the
true
figure
and
,
as
such
,
we
be
not
happy
to
release
such
datum
.
there
be
a
serious
issue
with
the
specific
recording
of
knife
crime
which
the
CSO
have
point
out
.
since
I
submit
my
parliamentary
question
on
13
November
2018
,
which
be
not
too
far
off
a
year
ago
,
I
hope
there
have
be
some
improvement
in
the
quality
of
the
recording
of
the
statistic
in
question
.
it
would
be
useful
if
the
minister
of
State
in
he
reply
or
he
official
late
could
give
I
a
update
on
this
matter
.
if
we
be
not
deal
with
real
-
time
figure
,
we
will
not
know
the
true
extent
of
what
be
go
on
.
we
need
a
real
picture
of
what
be
go
on
if
we
be
to
legislate
efficiently
and
effectively
on
this
matter
.
as
a
aside
,
there
be
a
topical
issue
matter
before
this
legislation
be
present
.
it
would
be
a
vote
of
confidence
if
line
minister
be
available
to
take
individual
topical
issue
matter
.
it
would
stave
off
much
of
the
tension
create
when
they
be
not
available
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Kelly
,
raise
a
issue
concern
Tipperary
.
I
be
a
constituency
colleague
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Stanton
,
and
I
accept
he
response
.
I
do
not
wish
to
score
a
political
point
on
this
matter
.
however
,
there
be
a
issue
in
respect
of
the
administration
of
justice
.
the
topical
Issue
matter
refer
specifically
to
the
new
operating
structure
of
a
Garda
Síochána
in
Tipperary
.
it
be
also
a
major
concern
in
north
County
Cork
where
the
new
divisional
Garda
headquarters
will
be
move
to
Macroom
.
some
deputy
have
genuine
concern
.
when
a
topical
issue
matter
be
raise
,
it
should
be
deal
with
by
the
line
minister
.
I
have
stand
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
stand
now
and
I
fully
accept
he
explanation
in
this
regard
.
I
be
not
be
political
or
try
to
score
a
point
.
however
,
I
want
merely
to
state
it
for
the
record
.
I
want
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
financing
.
if
we
be
to
have
climate
action
,
there
be
the
climate
action
fund
.
the
minister
have
state
previously
that
it
be
the
intention
of
the
government
to
use
the
reserve
from
the
National
Oil
reserve
Agency
,
NORA
,
and
that
if
there
be
any
surplus
within
that
reserve
,
it
would
be
use
for
the
purpose
of
the
action
contain
within
the
climate
action
plan
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
reserve
can
be
use
now
or
do
it
require
a
change
of
legislation
?
I
understand
the
minister
may
have
make
a
statement
in
this
regard
previously
but
I
do
not
have
access
to
that
.
it
would
be
useful
to
understand
from
the
minister
what
he
intention
be
regard
the
use
of
NORA
.
if
we
be
to
talk
about
create
a
fund
and
utilise
NORA
,
it
would
be
useful
to
know
the
legal
position
.
my
understanding
,
and
I
stand
open
to
correction
,
be
that
if
it
be
intend
to
repurpose
the
NORA
surplus
reserve
in
any
way
at
this
point
,
that
could
be
deem
to
be
unlawful
.
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
clarification
from
the
minister
on
that
.
the
second
issue
be
one
in
respect
of
which
we
have
receive
many
email
in
the
past
24
hour
,
namely
,
the
LNG
terminal
.
the
minister
will
be
aware
that
among
the
concern
raise
in
regard
to
the
proposal
to
designate
the
construction
of
a
liquefy
natural
gas
terminal
as
a
EU
project
of
common
interest
be
the
prospect
of
frack
gas
be
import
from
the
Unite
State
.
no
doubt
the
schedule
hearing
before
the
joint
committee
will
provide
a
opportunity
to
consider
the
controversial
aspect
of
the
fracking
process
and
whether
gas
extract
in
this
way
should
be
introduce
into
the
Irish
and
European
energy
mix
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
outline
the
position
in
law
as
regard
such
a
facility
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
Petroleum
and
other
Minerals
Development
(
Prohibition
of
Onshore
Hydraulic
Fracking
)
act
2017
introduce
the
fracking
ban
by
insert
into
the
principle
act
-
that
be
,
the
1960
Act
-
a
new
Chapter
IIA
deal
with
hydraulic
fracturing
.
the
core
provision
of
the
new
section
5B
,
under
Chapter
IIA
,
provide
,
"
it
shall
not
be
lawful
for
a
person
to
search
for
,
get
,
raise
,
take
,
carry
away
or
work
petroleum
by
means
of
hydraulic
fracturing
.
"
we
find
the
relevant
definition
in
section
2
(
1
)
of
the
1960
Act
.
that
section
include
the
follow
definition
:
"
work
"
when
use
in
relation
to
petroleum
,
include
dig
,
search
for
,
boring
for
,
get
,
raise
,
take
,
carry
away
,
store
[
"
store
"
be
the
key
word
]
and
treat
petroleum
,
and
cognate
word
shall
be
construe
accordingly
.
"
it
seem
,
therefore
,
that
to
"
work
"
petroleum
encompass
its
storage
and
that
,
accord
to
at
least
one
interpretation
of
section
5b
,
it
be
unlawful
not
only
to
search
for
or
extract
natural
gas
by
frack
but
also
to
store
frack
gas
in
the
State
.
I
would
be
grateful
if
the
minister
could
confirm
to
I
whether
it
be
he
view
that
,
without
a
change
in
the
law
,
a
LPG
terminal
could
be
use
for
the
storage
of
import
gas
that
have
be
extract
by
way
of
hydraulic
fracturing
elsewhere
in
the
world
.
I
do
not
propose
to
detain
the
House
at
this
hour
of
the
night
with
the
three
t's
or
a
typical
second
stage
speech
on
everything
I
know
about
broadcast
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
I
will
endeavour
to
stick
to
the
legislative
proposal
before
we
.
I
have
a
question
about
the
proposal
for
the
broadcasting
funding
scheme
to
be
administer
by
the
BAI
to
provide
a
bursary
grant
scheme
for
professional
journalist
work
in
certain
sound
broadcaster
at
local
or
community
level
.
will
the
minister
give
some
consideration
to
broaden
the
scheme
to
include
print
journalism
?
do
he
have
a
view
on
whether
it
should
be
expand
to
include
print
journalism
?
as
we
all
know
,
historically
,
many
journalist
cut
they
tooth
in
the
back
-
street
office
of
local
newspaper
.
there
be
many
great
journalist
who
come
out
of
that
stable
and
move
into
the
broadcasting
or
print
journalism
sphere
.
it
would
be
a
worthwhile
proposal
if
it
could
be
consider
.
while
the
legislation
be
silent
on
the
household
charge
,
the
minister
do
make
a
announcement
on
it
.
however
,
he
be
tell
we
that
it
will
be
five
year
before
it
be
introduce
.
for
the
life
of
I
,
I
can
not
understand
why
we
have
to
wait
for
five
year
.
I
surmise
that
there
may
be
political
sensitivity
surround
the
very
idea
of
introduce
a
household
charge
base
on
experience
in
the
past
with
certain
other
proposal
for
charge
.
however
,
I
do
not
think
we
should
be
afraid
to
move
in
that
direction
soon
than
the
minister
be
propose
to
do
.
if
we
be
really
serious
about
content
creation
,
particularly
from
a
cultural
and
indigenous
point
of
view
when
we
know
that
there
be
such
creativity
on
this
island
,
and
if
we
know
that
we
be
not
realise
the
full
potential
of
the
television
licence
fee
and
that
it
have
a
bear
on
public
service
broadcasting
,
I
do
not
understand
why
we
cannot
be
more
radical
and
imaginative
in
move
with
great
haste
and
urgency
.
I
do
not
understand
why
ensure
there
be
the
requisite
funding
to
support
the
creative
content
that
be
so
vital
and
that
sustain
we
could
not
be
do
in
way
less
than
five
year
.
I
share
deputy
Dooley
's
point
.
I
think
the
minister
would
find
agreement
across
the
House
on
how
we
could
reach
that
point
,
if
the
message
of
a
household
charge
be
articulate
in
the
right
way
to
the
people
such
they
understand
,
as
citizen
,
what
they
get
for
they
money
,
namely
,
great
content
and
home
-
grow
and
indigenous
content
,
displace
some
of
the
dross
be
import
by
RTÉ
,
much
of
which
can
be
watch
on
most
other
platform
.
if
we
be
not
create
indigenous
content
,
we
be
go
down
the
slippery
slope
towards
great
homogenisation
.
we
badly
need
to
ensure
we
protect
and
encourage
home
-
grow
content
producer
.
it
be
self
-
evident
that
the
content
produce
be
of
the
high
order
.
it
receive
global
recognition
.
we
need
to
be
brave
in
how
we
approach
issue
such
as
the
household
charge
.
I
reiterate
that
the
minister
would
find
favour
across
the
House
if
there
be
dialogue
with
Opposition
Member
on
how
it
could
be
achieve
.
my
last
point
be
not
pertinent
to
the
legislation
but
relate
to
the
recent
announcement
make
by
RTÉ
on
Lyric
FM
and
the
potential
closure
of
the
Cork
studio
.
if
RTÉ
be
look
to
member
to
advocate
for
it
on
the
basis
of
fly
kite
of
this
nature
,
it
be
go
about
it
in
a
very
bad
way
.
suggest
,
for
instance
,
in
such
a
announcement
that
Lyric
FM
or
the
station
in
Cork
which
be
a
major
regional
component
of
RTÉ's
output
be
close
down
be
not
the
way
to
go
if
RTÉ
be
seek
to
find
friend
in
political
circle
.
we
all
see
it
as
the
move
that
it
be
.
if
it
be
seek
to
leverage
from
we
,
as
politician
represent
this
area
,
a
degree
of
sympathy
to
approach
the
government
to
increase
its
funding
stream
,
or
use
we
as
leverage
to
increase
its
funding
stream
in
order
that
it
could
go
back
to
the
government
for
a
great
share
of
the
pot
,
I
suggest
to
RTÉ
that
it
be
not
the
way
to
go
.
it
need
to
engage
in
dialogue
a
little
more
with
local
public
representative
on
its
future
plan
.
at
the
same
time
,
if
we
do
not
have
RTÉ
,
if
we
do
not
have
a
public
service
broadcasting
model
,
or
if
it
be
not
on
a
sound
financial
footing
and
not
future
-
proof
because
it
cannot
drive
new
content
owe
to
a
lack
of
revenue
,
five
year
be
too
far
into
the
future
for
a
household
charge
.
as
I
say
,
there
would
be
a
willingness
to
engage
on
what
broadcasting
would
look
like
in
the
future
,
and
member
of
this
House
would
co-operate
with
the
government
in
that
regard
.
I
want
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
EU'
"
Television
without
Frontiers
"
directive
.
while
I
be
ask
the
minister
to
look
into
the
crystal
ball
,
it
would
be
very
useful
to
have
the
minister
's
perspective
on
where
the
"
Television
without
Frontiers
"
directive
stand
if
UK
station
leave
the
EU
and
what
arrangement
,
if
any
,
would
need
to
be
put
in
place
,
particularly
where
UK
channel
be
advertise
within
the
Irish
market
.
I
do
not
know
if
that
question
be
pertinent
but
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
perspective
in
regard
to
where
stand
the
"
Television
without
Frontiers
"
directive
in
the
event
a
no
-deal
Brexit
.
we
have
not
hear
of
how
the
broadcasting
component
of
Brexit
will
play
out
,
give
we
consume
so
much
content
from
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
it
could
be
that
it
have
no
effect
whatsoever
but
it
would
be
useful
to
hear
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
.
what
about
"
the
late
late
show
"
?
the
Healy
-
Raes
be
regular
on
that
.
the
deputy
have
to
thank
it
too
.
the

have
a
opportunity
to
speak
again
the

,
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
to
consider
the
excessive
cost
of
nicotine
replacement
therapy
,
include
chew
gum
and
lozenge
.
there
be
many
people
who
be
not
on
the
medical
card
scheme
and
wish
to
give
up
smoking
through
the
use
of
alternative
source
of
nicotine
as
they
wean
themselves
off
the
product
.
however
,
the
cost
of
this
product
be
excessive
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
consider
review
the
cost
of
that
product
for
which
pharmaceutical
company
be
charge
a
arm
and
a
leg
.
with
respect
,
I
hear
a
deputy
say
"
Vótáil
"
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
inland
revenue
(
include
value
-
add
tax
and
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.

I
apologise
for
my
voice
.
I
will
start
on
the
climate
action
agenda
.
yesterday
,
the
minister
announce
that
€
90
million
would
be
ring
-
fence
.
the
language
use
in
the
document
be
vague
and
non-committal
.
accord
to
the
document
,
the
ring
-
fencing
of
that
€
90
million
be
to
protect
the
most
vulnerable
,
have
sustainable
mobility
programme
,
have
agri-environmental
scheme
,
and
plan
for
a
low
-
carbon
future
.
within
that
€
90
million
nod
.
be
give
to
specific
issue
,
such
as
€
20
million
for
the
midland
for
a
social
housing
energy
-
efficiency
programme
;
€
5
million
for
peatland
rehabilitation
;
€
6
million
for
the
just
transition
;
€
9
million
for
that
so
-
call
sustainability
mobility
project
;
and
€
8
million
towards
the
purchase
of
electric
vehicle
.
on
the
carbon
tax
,
that
of
we
who
be
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
sign
up
to
the
42
recommendation
in
the
committee
's
report
arise
from
the
citizen
's
Assembly
deliberation
.
one
of
the
primary
recommendation
be
that
if
there
be
to
be
a
increase
in
the
carbon
tax
and
if
that
carbon
tax
be
ring
-
fence
,
there
would
be
no
price
increase
until
the
Department
of
Finance
carry
out
a
study
on
the
effect
of
fuel
poverty
,
particularly
for
that
who
live
in
fuel
-
impoverished
household
,
such
that
money
could
be
make
available
subsequently
to
ensure
that
if
retrofit
or
energy
efficiency
measure
could
be
carry
out
they
would
be
do
.
nothing
in
yesterday
's
announcement
give
I
or
my
party
solace
that
we
will
have
any
time
soon
a
programme
with
a
specific
budget
to
upgrade
the
thousand
of
house
that
need
to
be
retrofit
.
instead
all
we
get
be
the
€
20
million
that
be
announce
for
social
housing
energy
project
in
the
midland
.
nobody
in
this
House
-
I
be
from
Cork
-
would
argue
against
that
,
but
the
€
20
million
as
a
starting
point
be
woefully
inadequate
and
too
focus
on
one
geographical
area
,
notwithstand
that
it
be
go
to
happen
there
.
it
need
to
be
broaden
and
we
need
to
see
the
specific
proposal
for
that
€
90
million
to
ensure
that
for
every
citizen
who
want
to
spend
money
from
savings
or
borrowing
to
have
they
house
retrofit
,
there
be
a
scheme
that
will
supplement
the
cost
of
retrofit
that
home
if
we
be
to
meet
the
target
.
we
have
not
have
that
study
from
the
Department
of
Finance
.
while
the
government
pay
lipservice
to
the
recommendation
of
various
committee
of
this
legislature
,
it
make
no
genuine
attempt
to
take
seriously
the
recommendation
of
specific
committee
.
this
be
a
all
-
party
recommendation
.
the
government
need
to
show
great
urgency
on
what
it
intend
to
do
on
the
issue
of
climate
action
.
I
wish
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
disability
.
all
member
be
inundate
by
constituent
ask
about
the
lack
of
proper
respite
facility
for
people
with
intellectual
disability
.
the
vagueness
of
the
language
use
in
the
expenditure
report
that
accompany
the
minister
's
budget
statement
yesterday
merely
state
that
€
25
million
would
be
make
available
for
disability
service
.
there
be
a
package
of
measure
on
the
provision
of
asd
service
and
respite
care
for
people
with
intellectual
disability
.
however
,
again
the
language
be
vague
and
on
respite
,
it
simply
state
that
the
government
will
build
capacity
and
respond
to
the
evolve
need
of
service
user
and
they
family
.
that
be
so
vague
that
I
do
not
know
what
it
mean
.
in
budget
2020
,
the
government
be
refer
to
building
capacity
at
a
time
all
deputy
and
Senator
be
inundate
with
request
from
parent
whose
child
have
intellectual
disability
and
who
need
respite
and
cannot
get
it
.
I
be
aware
of
one
case
where
a
family
have
not
have
respite
in
ten
year
for
they
son
.
what
do
that
mean
for
they
?
it
be
meaningless
language
.
we
want
specifics
on
whether
that
family
and
countless
other
family
can
see
in
this
budget
something
that
give
they
hope
that
they
son
or
daughter
arise
from
this
budget
will
now
get
respite
.
there
be
a
massive
waiting
list
for
asd
appraisal
.
we
all
have
the
waiting
list
for
we
constituency
.
not
only
be
there
a
waiting
list
for
the
initial
assessment
but
the
person
be
not
guarantee
the
service
thereafter
.
that
be
cause
massive
stress
.
the
language
of
the
budgetary
documentation
be
suitably
vague
.
it
state
:
"
funding
be
be
provide
for
a
Autism
plan
[.
.
.]
to
improve
service
for
people
with
autism
and
they
family
.
"
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
have
be
go
on
for
the
past
three
year
during
the
lifetime
of
this
government
?
be
it
tell
we
that
in
2020
there
will
be
funding
for
a
autism
plan
,
when
I
be
sure
even
the
Taoiseach
's
office
be
inundate
with
request
from
family
for
proper
service
for
people
with
asd
and
for
people
who
need
respite
?
I
be
not
try
to
score
a
narrow
political
point
.
there
be
resource
available
that
could
be
deploy
in
a
way
that
focus
on
the
individual
family
such
that
they
can
get
access
to
respite
in
a
decent
and
fair
way
to
alleviate
the
stress
they
be
under
.
the
narrative
of
education
over
the
past
few
week
have
be
about
the
compulsory
teaching
of
history
at
junior
cycle
level
.
there
will
be
a
critique
of
whether
that
become
a
Trojan
horse
for
other
subject
to
have
a
equal
case
to
be
make
compulsory
.
it
overshadow
the
fact
that
there
be
absolutely
no
provision
in
the
education
budget
for
the
reduction
of
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
and
more
specifically
,
in
respect
of
the
provision
of
additional
teacher
to
teach
English
as
a
additional
language
.
there
be
over
26
language
speak
in
a
school
quite
close
to
where
I
live
.
that
school
be
struggle
to
provide
English
language
resource
and
do
not
have
enough
teacher
to
meet
the
demand
.
I
be
sure
the
same
be
true
across
the
country
.
for
a
small
sum
in
the
overall
education
allocation
,
the
minister
could
have
have
a
tremendous
positive
effect
in
ensure
that
English
as
a
additional
language
,
EAL
,
teacher
could
be
provide
to
give
people
who
be
part
of
we
community
the
opportunity
to
learn
English
in
a
properly
-
resource
way
in
order
that
they
can
go
about
they
business
as
citizen
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
budget
.
it
be
very
much
a
budget
that
prepare
for
the
bad
while
hope
for
the
good
.
there
be
a
few
issue
I
want
to
pick
up
on
.
we
can
all
highlight
weakness
in
the
budget
,
and
we
would
all
have
like
to
see
far
more
money
go
into
service
,
but
there
be
several
element
of
this
budget
that
must
be
highlight
.
they
provide
a
opportunity
for
community
across
the
country
with
good
idea
and
solution
to
come
forward
with
constructive
proposal
that
can
be
develop
into
very
beneficial
scheme
,
not
just
for
that
community
but
for
the
country
as
a
whole
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
€
31
million
of
funding
have
be
allocate
for
the
midland
county
to
deal
with
the
challenge
surround
Bord
to
Móna
.
I
particularly
welcome
the
€
6
million
of
funding
allocate
to
measure
for
a
just
transition
.
person
will
argue
that
the
funding
be
insufficient
,
and
I
agree
with
they
.
however
,
it
be
seed
capital
to
support
community
across
the
midland
county
.
that
community
can
come
forward
with
good
,
innovative
solution
that
will
create
job
across
the
midland
and
have
they
develop
into
initiative
that
can
leverage
funding
from
the
European
Commission
or
the
urban
or
rural
regeneration
and
development
fund
.
I
also
welcome
the
acknowledgement
in
the
budget
of
remote
working
.
while
in
the
past
we
have
pay
lip
service
to
this
issue
,
IDA
Ireland
have
continue
to
pile
more
job
into
the
city
of
Dublin
,
which
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
cater
for
they
.
meanwhile
,
many
community
across
the
country
with
the
require
office
and
housing
accommodation
cannot
attract
that
job
.
the
budget
announcement
include
a
allocation
of
funding
to
establish
300
rural
digital
hub
across
the
country
,
with
a
average
of
seven
in
every
county
.
this
will
allow
community
and
individual
to
work
remotely
.
I
encourage
company
and
business
base
here
in
Dublin
to
see
how
they
can
exploit
that
digital
hub
to
relocate
staff
from
rural
part
of
the
country
and
the
region
back
to
that
community
.
my
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Boxer
Moran
,
have
advocate
remote
work
for
the
Civil
Service
.
the
minister
for
Finance
acknowledge
this
option
in
he
budget
speech
and
a
review
will
now
commence
.
the
first
area
that
need
to
be
look
at
be
vacant
State
-
own
office
accommodation
throughout
the
country
to
see
whether
staff
could
be
locate
there
rather
than
have
to
develop
new
accommodation
.
Roscommon
town
have
thousand
of
square
footage
of
turnkey
commercial
office
space
that
would
be
ready
to
accommodate
business
tomorrow
morning
.
I
encourage
business
look
at
expand
rather
than
try
to
build
and
source
new
office
accommodation
in
Dublin
to
consider
the
opportunity
in
provincial
town
throughout
the
country
,
such
as
Roscommon
town
,
use
the
tool
of
remote
working
.
the
government
should
capitalise
on
what
it
have
announce
in
the
budget
and
it
need
to
bring
together
a
task
force
not
just
of
the
State
body
but
of
all
of
the
expertise
throughout
the
economy
that
could
look
at
how
we
can
incentivise
and
support
business
and
provide
they
with
the
knowledge
and
know
-
how
to
encourage
remote
working
and
give
a
substantial
boost
to
community
throughout
the
country
.
with
regard
to
the
agricultural
sector
,
several
significant
announcement
be
make
yesterday
.
a
€300
million
fund
will
be
put
in
place
for
new
agri-environmental
scheme
.
person
can
dismiss
this
and
say
€
3
million
be
insufficient
to
put
in
place
any
type
of
agri-environmental
scheme
but
it
be
a
blank
canva
for
farmer
to
come
forward
with
solution
on
how
to
develop
a
agri-environmental
scheme
that
support
farm
income
rather
than
what
have
happen
heretofore
,
when
the
environmentalist
have
create
hoop
and
hurdle
for
farmer
to
jump
through
.
I
actively
encourage
the
farming
community
throughout
the
country
to
see
how
they
can
develop
this
.
the
same
issue
arise
with
regard
to
the
€
40
million
fund
of
target
support
for
the
beef
sector
.
I
actively
encourage
the
beef
representative
group
throughout
the
country
to
come
forward
now
with
proposal
on
how
that
funding
can
be
draw
down
in
a
innovative
way
to
support
beef
farmer
,
particularly
suckle
farmer
,
throughout
the
country
rather
than
let
official
in
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
design
a
scheme
that
meet
the
administration
objective
rather
than
the
objective
of
community
throughout
the
country
.
I
pose
this
question
to
ascertain
from
the
minister
what
the
total
climate
action
budget
will
be
for
2020
.
the
carbon
tax
yield
be
peg
at
€
90
million
in
the
budget
last
week
.
we
be
tell
that
will
be
ring
-
fence
to
protect
the
most
vulnerable
in
society
,
support
sustainable
mobility
,
provide
agri-environment
scheme
and
plan
for
a
low
-
carbon
future
.
I
would
like
the
Minister
of
State
to
drill
down
a
little
further
and
elaborate
on
what
that
mean
in
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
and
the
type
of
initiative
he
be
go
to
bring
forward
regard
climate
action
.
I
be
glad
that
the
Minister
of
State
mention
NORA
.
it
have
be
indicate
that
NORA
's
current
surplus
fund
will
be
use
for
climate
action
measure
.
be
it
legally
possible
for
that
fund
to
be
use
in
that
way
now
?
my
second
question
concern
figure
give
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Communication
,
Climate
action
and
environment
suggest
some
17.4
%
of
household
be
consider
to
be
fuel
impoverished
.
there
be
nothing
in
any
of
the
budget
announcement
that
will
do
anything
to
generate
programme
to
deal
with
fuel
poverty
.
I
refer
to
ensure
a
massive
programme
of
retrofit
be
initiate
to
take
carbon
out
of
house
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
tell
we
,
de
facto
,
that
it
be
not
legal
to
use
the
current
NORA
excess
reserve
for
climate
action
measure
,
but
that
it
be
to
be
make
legal
by
pass
the
Bill
to
which
he
refer
.
the
reference
to
NORA
's
excess
reserve
can
be
take
off
the
table
as
be
speak
of
as
part
of
the
climate
action
fund
.
when
the
government
be
allocate
fund
,
it
be
important
that
it
do
not
refer
to
fund
to
which
it
do
not
have
access
.
I
refer
to
not
be
legally
entitle
to
take
money
from
NORA
to
use
for
climate
action
.
it
be
important
to
have
that
clarify
.
turn
to
the
just
transition
commissioner
,
be
it
the
case
that
he
or
she
will
now
be
fund
by
the
private
sector
and
industry
?
I
also
make
the
case
that
there
need
to
be
a
regional
balance
regard
climate
action
.
we
all
support
measure
propose
for
a
just
transition
in
the
midland
.
it
be
vital
that
every
region
throughout
the
State
be
look
at
and
that
each
should
come
up
with
a
set
of
proposal
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
intervention
in
the
context
of
hear
from
the
region
.
it
be
vital
there
be
equality
in
any
of
the
proposal
that
come
forward
in
respect
of
project
that
meet
the
criterion
relate
to
climate
action
.
the
€90
million
from
the
carbon
tax
be
just
a
drop
in
the
ocean
.
a
message
will
be
send
to
the
Seanad
acquaint
it
accordingly
.

I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
response
.
to
some
degree
,
the
Minister
of
State
be
support
the
point
that
I
be
make
about
the
success
of
the
card
and
the
satisfaction
that
people
have
when
they
use
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
mention
that
there
be
customer
service
benefit
,
that
more
than
600,000
free
travel
journey
be
undertake
every
week
with
the
public
service
card
and
more
than
600,000
payment
be
verify
.
I
be
seek
to
speak
for
people
throughout
Irish
society
who
,
as
may
surprise
the
Acting
Chairman
,
would
not
have
a
passport
or
driver
's
licence
,
which
be
the
two
other
obvious
form
of
identification
.
they
be
in
possession
of
the
public
service
card
.
we
be
merely
ask
that
the
service
could
be
expand
,
especially
for
anti-money
laundering
purpose
,
such
that
where
a
person
be
carry
out
a
financial
transaction
where
proof
of
identity
be
require
,
especially
in
a
credit
union
with
many
old
people
who
use
it
,
the
public
service
card
would
be
deem
to
be
fit
for
purpose
for
proof
of
identification
and
to
adhere
to
the
money
laundering
legislation
.
the
Minister
of
State
tell
we
that
there
be
a
high
degree
of
satisfaction
with
the
card
and
that
people
be
comfortable
use
it
.
it
really
bring
we
back
to
the
point
of
whether
the
social
Welfare
,
Pension
and
Civil
Registration
Bill
2017
,
which
have
be
sit
there
for
two
year
,
could
be
expedite
in
a
way
that
would
ensure
that
a
provision
could
be
make
that
it
could
be
use
for
anti-money
laundering
legislation
,
so
that
if
somebody
open
a
account
in
a
credit
union
,
the
public
service
card
could
be
deem
to
be
a
valuable
or
appropriate
form
of
identification
.
that
would
probably
have
the
effect
of
ensure
great
confidence
in
the
card
and
probably
ensure
that
it
could
meet
the
anti-money
laundering
requirement
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
who
speak
in
support
of
Sinn
Féin
's
motion
.
it
be
really
welcome
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
government
have
indicate
it
will
abstain
.
that
be
a
disappointment
not
just
for
Sinn
Féin
but
,
more
importantly
,
for
the
lone
-
parent
family
who
be
look
on
and
hope
that
some
of
the
minister
's
positive
word
recently
would
translate
into
positive
action
.
while
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McGrath
,
rattle
off
a
range
of
benefit
in
he
contribution
,
this
be
available
to
many
parent
in
the
State
and
be
not
limit
to
lone
parent
.
the
Minister
of
State
fail
to
touch
on
the
Thatcherite
cut
to
the
one
-
parent
family
payment
that
the
Fine
Gael
government
introduce
with
a
Labour
Party
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
and
the
impact
that
cut
have
have
on
one
-
parent
family
.
this
measure
be
irrelevant
to
the
motion
because
we
be
talk
about
the
non-payment
of
maintenance
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
,
always
open
any
response
when
it
relate
to
child
maintenance
by
detail
the
legal
obligation
under
the
family
law
act
.
I
be
disappointed
the
minister
be
not
in
the
Chamber
to
respond
personally
to
the
motion
and
the
question
ask
.
this
legal
obligation
clearly
mean
nothing
.
we
know
that
because
the
majority
of
lone
parent
be
not
receive
maintenance
for
they
child
.
instead
,
lone
parent
be
leave
to
struggle
and
to
live
in
poverty
.
the
minister
have
a
tendency
to
dismiss
the
issue
of
child
maintenance
as
a
matter
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
yet
it
be
the
policy
of
she
Department
,
not
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
that
have
condemn
many
lone
-
parent
family
to
poverty
.
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
be
able
to
pursue
the
non-custodial
parent
to
cover
its
own
cost
for
the
one
-
parent
family
payment
but
have
no
interest
in
collect
maintenance
for
the
child
involve
.
what
about
the
cost
of
a
lone
parent
raise
child
alone
?
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
also
speak
about
the
liable
relative
unit
,
but
I
note
he
do
not
share
the
figure
outline
by
my
colleague
,
deputy
Quinlivan
,
because
that
figure
be
embarrassing
.
the
liable
relative
unit
be
wholly
dysfunctional
.
it
do
not
work
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
speak
about
the
action
of
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
,
on
the
issue
of
child
maintenance
as
if
she
have
be
tackle
the
issue
for
year
.
until
September
2019
,
not
once
do
the
minister
agree
to
examine
the
process
currently
in
place
in
order
to
seek
child
maintenance
.
I
spend
more
than
two
year
ask
she
about
it
over
and
over
again
in
this
Chamber
.
let
we
not
pretend
the
minister
have
be
work
hard
to
tackle
this
issue
.
she
spend
that
two
year
try
to
pawn
the
issue
off
on
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
it
have
to
be
say
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
,
have
do
nothing
to
date
to
tackle
the
issue
face
by
lone
parent
with
maintenance
.
that
be
a
fact
.
it
be
really
disappointing
that
the
government
have
choose
to
abstain
on
this
critical
motion
.
the
minister
say
money
have
be
set
aside
in
the
budget
and
that
be
welcome
,
but
we
do
not
need
guideline
.
Lone
-
parent
family
need
a
statutory
child
maintenance
service
that
have
be
show
will
cost
a
very
small
amount
of
money
to
establish
,
about
€
7
million
.
that
cost
would
be
so
important
to
the
many
family
out
there
that
be
drive
into
poverty
because
of
the
failure
of
this
government
and
of
successive
government
to
put
in
place
a
maintenance
service
that
would
help
to
ensure
that
child
be
lift
out
of
poverty
,
use
child
maintenance
as
a
means
to
do
so
.
I
ask
and
urge
the
government
again
not
to
abstain
on
this
,
but
to
support
it
and
work
together
collectively
,
because
no
one
have
a
monopoly
on
this
issue
and
no
one
want
to
turn
it
into
a
political
football
.
we
can
all
work
together
on
this
,
but
abstain
send
out
the
wrong
message
to
lone
-
parent
family
that
desperately
need
this
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
who
speak
in
support
of
Sinn
Féin
's
motion
.
it
be
really
welcome
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
government
have
indicate
it
will
abstain
.
that
be
a
disappointment
not
just
for
Sinn

liable
relative
unit
,
but
I
note
he
do
not
share
the
figure
outline
by
my
colleague
,
deputy
Quinlivan
,
because
that
figure
be
embarrassing
.
the
liable
relative
unit
be
wholly
dysfunctional
.
it
do
not
work

the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finian
McGrath
,
speak
about
the
action
of
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
,
on
the
issue
of
child
maintenance
as
if
she
have
be
tackle
the
issue
for
year
.
until
September
2019
,
not
once
do
the
minister
agree
to
examine
the
process
currently
in
place
in
order
to
seek
child
maintenance
.
I
spend
more
than
two
year
ask
she
about
it
over
and
over
again
in
this
Chamber
.
let
we
not
pretend
the
minister
have
be
work
hard
to
tackle
this
issue
.
she
spend
that
two
year
try
to
pawn
the
issue
off
on
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
it
have
to
be
say
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Regina
Doherty
,
have
do
nothing
to
date
to
tackle
the
issue
face
by
lone
parent
with
maintenance
.
that
be
a
fact
.
it
be
really
disappointing
that
the
government
have
choose
to
abstain
on
this
critical
motion
.
the
minister
say
money
have
be
set
aside
in
the
budget
and
that
be
welcome
,
but
we
do
not
need
guideline
.
Lone
-
parent
family
need
a
statutory
child
maintenance
service
that
have
be
show
will
cost
a
very
small
amount
of
money
to
establish
,
about
€
7
million
.
that
cost
would
be
so
important
to
the
many
family
out
there
that
be
drive
into
poverty
because
of
the
failure
of
this
government
and
of
successive
government
to
put
in
place
a
maintenance
service
that
would
help
to
ensure
that
child
be
lift
out
of
poverty
,
use
child
maintenance
as
a
means
to
do
so
.
I
ask
and
urge
the
government
again
not
to
abstain
on
this
,
but
to
support
it
and
work
together
collectively
,
because
no
one
have
a
monopoly
on
this
issue
and
no
one
want
to
turn
it
into
a
political
football
.
we
can
all
work
together
on
this
,
but
abstain
send
out
the
wrong
message
to
lone
-
parent
family
that
desperately
need
this
.
I
move
:

report
on

to

and

and

'
,
which
be
lay
before
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
on
the
27th
August
,
2019
;
—endorse
the
view
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
that
:
—
high
speed
broadband
be
a
vital
piece
of
infrastructure
for
rural
Ireland
and
should
be
provide
as
quickly
as
possible
,
to
the
same
standard
as
be
available
commercially
in
other
part
of
the
country
,
at
the
same
cost
to
consumer
as
elsewhere
and
at
good
value
to
the
taxpayer
;
and
—
the
broadband
network
infrastructure
should
be
under
the
ownership
of
the
State
,
as
it
be
strategically
important
;
and
—
resolve
that
public
money
should
not
be
expend
on
any
propose
broadband
telecomumication
network
unless
such
a
network
be
,
or
be
to
be
,
own
by
a
minister
of
the
government
or
a
public
body
on
behalf
of
the
people
.
I
be
share
time
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Howlin
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
that
if
the
government
be
to
spend
over
€
2.9
billion
of
public
money
on
a
broadband
network
over
25
year
,
such
a
network
should
be
own
by
the
State
.
one
would
have
to
look
long
and
hard
to
find
anyone
outside
of
the
government
who
would
disagree
with
that
.
the
question
of
rural
broadband
be
not
about
whether
we
should
deliver
it
.
everyone
agree
we
should
have
comprehensive
broadband
for
every
home
and
business
in
this
country
.
everyone
want
the
benefit
that
it
will
bring
and
Labour
desire
equality
of
access
to
high
-
speed
broadband
across
the
country
.
however
,
this
will
be
nearly
€
3
billion
give
to
a
private
monopoly
,
which
will
own
the
network
forever
,
and
the
propose
contract
will
last
25
year
but
what
then
?
the
private
monopoly
will
then
be
in
a
strategic
position
to
charge
significantly
more
to
user
.
we
be
not
so
much
sell
the
family
silver
as
pay
someone
to
take
it
off
we
hand
.
generation
to
come
will
wonder
at
the
ineptitude
of
hand
over
such
a
strategic
asset
to
the
private
sector
.
Fine
Gael
will
have
to
answer
for
this
in
a
general
election
.
why
be
it
commit
to
hand
over
a
network
we
will
pay
for
,
where
the
risk
have
be
all
but
remove
,
to
a
private
operator
?
the
purpose
of
this
motion
be
for
the
dáil
to
make
a
clear
statement
on
where
we
stand
on
ownership
.
in
a
dáil
where
decision
-
making
have
become
debase
,
this
be
a
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
vote
on
Thursday
.
we
will
give
due
consideration
to
the
Sinn
Féin
amendment
.
the
government
's
amendment
neglect
to
mention
the
gap
funding
model
would
only
work
if
there
be
strong
competition
between
bidder
,
rather
than
the
farce
of
a
tender
process
we
have
have
.
the
other
possible
ownership
structure
that
be
leave
on
the
table
be
discard
by
this
Fine
Gael
government
and
be
not
mention
in
the
government
amendment
.
that
option
be
a
full
concession
model
where
ownership
would
revert
to
the
State
.
we
know
the
choice
be
make
by
Fine
Gael
minister
to
pursue
this
flawed
model
where
the
price
be
trebl
from
€
1
billion
to
€
3
billion
.
in
term
of
public
procurement
seek
value
for
money
on
behalf
of
the
public
,
what
happen
under
this
government
be
not
serious
.
it
be
a
joke
.
let
we
remind
ourselves
of
how
we
get
to
this
point
.
there
can
not
be
a
competitive
process
with
only
one
bidder
.
the
argument
that
the
remain
bidder
be
there
simply
because
it
outlast
its
competitor
be
not
true
.
first
,
Labour
leave
two
option
on
the
table
,
namely
,
a
commercial
stimulus
model
and
a
concession
-
type
arrangement
.
follow
a
recommendation
by
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
the
government
choose
the
commercial
stimulus
model
or
the
so
-
call
gap
funding
model
.
under
this
model
,
the
private
sector
would
finance
,
design
,
build
,
own
and
operate
the
network
under
contract
to
the
Department
.
in
other
word
,
the
government
reject
the
alternative
full
concession
model
in
which
the
asset
would
be
hand
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
.
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
say
in
he
explanation
at
the
time
:
I
be
advise
that
under
a
full
concession
Model
,
the
entire
cost
of
the
project
would
be
place
on
the
government
's
balance
sheet
,
with
serious
implication
for
the
available
capital
funding
over
the
next
five
to
six
year
.
give
that
both
model
will
deliver
the
same
service
and
be
govern
by
a
almost
identical
contract
we
)
,
I
cannot
justify
reduce
the
amount
of
money
available
to
government
for
other
critical
priority
such
as
Climate
Change
,
Housing
and
Health
,
over
the
next
six
year
.
his
advice
turn
out
to
be
completely
wrong
.
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
choose
a
model
that
surrender
a
publicly
fund
asset
to
the
private
sector
and
yet
the
cost
of
the
project
be
still
on
the
public
balance
sheet
and
eat
into
the
funding
available
for
the
rest
of
we
capital
programme
.
second
,
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
decide
to
allow
Eir
to
split
out
300000
profitable
household
from
the
rest
of
the
population
.
Eir
withdraw
once
it
have
secure
this
prize
.
the
ESB
-
Vodafone
bid
,
or
SIRO
as
it
be
call
,
withdraw
after
that
be
allow
to
happen
.
the
truth
be
that
the
term
of
the
State
's
offer
be
fundamentally
change
once
Eir
be
allow
to
redraw
the
map
.
SIRO
be
more
than
entitle
to
leave
at
that
stage
.
what
be
leave
be
Granahan
McCourt
bid
for
the
500000
hard
-
to
-
reach
household
.
we
see
this
consortium
reconfigure
itself
in
various
way
,
include
a
state
purchase
of
the
remain
private
share
in
Enet
from
the
consortium
for
a
undisclosed
price
.
then
we
find
out
about
a
series
of
meeting
and
dinner
.
now
we
be
sleepwalk
into
confirm
a
disastrous
deal
,
on
no
other
justification
than
that
we
have
start
so
we
will
finish
.
that
deal
pour
public
money
into
private
pocket
.
what
the
minister
need
to
do
,
even
at
this
11th
hour
,
be
to
take
this
service
in
-
house
.
he
should
cancel
the
bid
and
instruct
the
official
in
he
department
to
get
on
the
phone
and
talk
to
the
esb
about
how
the
State
can
deliver
broadband
itself
.
as
a
former
bidder
,
the
ESB
will
know
exactly
what
be
require
to
deliver
broadband
to
the
remain
500000
household
,
and
will
have
detailed
knowledge
of
how
it
can
use
its
own
publicly
-
own
infrastructure
of
mast
and
other
infrastructure
to
deliver
this
.
we
have
every
right
to
use
the
State
's
own
resource
to
deliver
this
plan
.
no
one
doubt
the
importance
of
get
this
plan
deliver
for
household
and
business
.
give
the
central
importance
of
access
to
information
and
knowledge
for
social
inclusion
,
personal
development
,
equal
access
to
goods
and
service
,
and
a
range
of
economic
opportunity
,
the
importance
of
provide
broadband
internet
to
the
whole
population
cannot
be
understate
.
the
government
talk
up
the
risk
of
a
unacceptable
delay
if
the
national
broadband
plan
collapse
,
but
equally
unacceptable
would
be
a
situation
where
private
enterprise
have
so
much
monopoly
power
that
the
people
end
up
pay
far
too
much
for
the
delivery
of
this
vital
service
when
State
company
could
have
deliver
it
for
a
low
cost
.
I
would
also
refer
that
interested
in
further
read
on
this
issue
to
the
work
and
expertise
of
Dr.
Dónal
Palcic
and
Professor
Eoin
Reeves
from
the
University
of
Limerick
.
in
respect
of
we
motion
,
I
also
want
to
put
on
the
record
that
we
preference
be
to
bring
a
Bill
to
put
in
law
we
view
,
and
that
of
the
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
,
that
a
broadband
network
we
will
pay
for
must
remain
in
public
ownership
.
however
that
Bill

"
we
be
not
propose
to
appropriate

.
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
ruling
on
we
Bill
be
base
on
a
assumption
that
,
if
the
contract
be
sign
but
be
frustrated
because
of
a
change
in
the
law
,
then
the
State
become

however
,
if
no

,
it
would

I
do
not

how

to

as

to

and
until
we
know
as
a
fact
whether
such

have

incidentally
,
if
no
contract
have
be
sign
by
the
date
of
introduction
of
the

,
it
would
take
a
great

of

that

subsequent

could

a

that

I
it
would
lead
to
a
impossible
situation
if

and
the

I
must

we

p.m.
so

we
support

,
which
be
a
technical

I
be
not
sure
how
much
practical
effect
it
will
have
.
mutual

of

concern

as
a
alternative
to

,
in

similarly
,
a

may

during

the

the
point
of

be
that
it
be
not
just
about
climate

,
but
about
people

a
good
example
of
this
from
elsewhere
in

be
articulate
by
we
former
President
,
Mary

,
in

keynote
speech
in

last

reference

how

develop
a

that
will
create

this
be
a
story
of
how
preparation
and

can
work
to
deliver
positive
outcome
for
all
.

we
to
the

recent

no
matter
what
part
of

we
come
from

we
all
agree
that
the

be
the
effective
epicentre
for
the
just
transition
.
it
be
the
test
bed
.
I
share
the
view
of
deputy
Chambers
regard
the
vagueness
in
respect
of
planning
.
notwithstanding
the
budget
announcement
,
which
we
understand
be
the
€
31
million
package
for
the
midland
and
the
just
transition
fund
,
we
still
do
not
have
sight
of
what
that
mean
in
real
term
for
project
delivery
on
the
ground
.
we
do
not
know
,
for
instance
,
the
detail
around
the
propose
500
job
that
will
be
create
,
as
refer
to
by
the
minister
,
between
peatland
restoration
and
the
transition
into
alternative
source
of
employment
.
I
believe
that
we
all
agree
there
have
to
be
a
transition
away
from
harvesting
.
I
be
sure
my
colleague
deputy
Fitzmaurice
will
speak
for
the
sole
trader
who
be
look
after
they
own
little
patch
of
raise
bog
in
he
part
of
the
world
.
there
be
a
case
to
be
make
for
that
people
also
.
I
certainly
do
not
have
sight
of
the
detail
around
the
just
transition
as
it
relate
to
the
midland
.
I
would
welcome
a
further
response
from
the
minister
to
provide
great
detail
on
what
be
he
and
the
government
's
vision
for
how
the
transition
will
come
to
pass
.
I
be
aware
that
a
retrofit
programme
for
housing
be
announce
in
the
budget
but
the
detail
of
that
have
yet
to
be
articulate
by
the
government
.
we
all
welcome
a
retrofit
programme
but
how
will
it
be
implement
and
how
can
we
ensure
that
people
will
transition
from
one
form
of
employment
into
that
type
of
employment
into
the
future
?
the
detail
of
that
also
remain
to
be
see
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
matter
.
my
plea
to
the
government
be
for
it
to
provide
this
House
,
within
a
short
space
of
time
,
with
the
detail
of
what
the
just
transition
mean
for
the
midland
and
how
comprehensive
the
programme
will
be
.
we
need
to
see
the
devil
in
the
detail
on
that
.
this
Bill
implement
the
referendum
result
by
remove
statutory
reference
to
the
offence
of
blasphemy
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
.
the
sentence
in
paragraph
5
of
article
40.6.1
of
the
Constitution
originally
read
:
"
the
publication
or
utterance
of
blasphemous
,
seditious
,
or
indecent
matter
be
a
offence
which
shall
be
punishable
in
accordance
with
law
.
"
as
amend
,
the
sentence
now
read
:
"
the
publication
or
utterance
of
seditious
or
indecent
matter
be
a
offence
which
shall
be
punishable
in
accordance
with
law
.
"
we
be
now
tidy
up
the
Statute
Book
in
order
to
take
account
of
the
removal
of
blasphemy
from
the
constitution
.
in
the
case
of
Corway
v.
independent
Newspaper
(
Ireland
)
Ltd
in
1999
,
the
Supreme
Court
point
out
the
difficulty
in
prosecute
blasphemy
,
give
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
any
other
legislation
have
provide
a
definition
set
out
the
ingredient
of
the
offence
.
Mr.
Justice
Donal
Barrington
give
the
lead
judgment
,
which
state
:
in
this
state
of
the
law
,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
definition
of
the
constitutional
offence
of
blasphemy
,
it
be
impossible
to
say
of
what
the
offence
of
blasphemy
consist
...
the
task
of
define
the
crime
be
one
for
the
legislature
,
not
for
the
court
.
while
it
be
not
as
interesting
,
we
can
make
exactly
the
same
criticism
about
at
least
one
of
the
two
offence
leave
in
this
article
of
the
constitution
.
there
be
no
clear
or
comprehensive
definition
of
the
offence
of
indecent
publication
or
sedition
.
what
be
the
thinking
behind
the
decision
to
keep
some
of
the
offence
in
article
40
while
delete
this
one
,
give
that
all
three
give
rise
to
the
same
difficulty
?
I
refer
to
the
Fianna
Fáil
contribution
to
this
debate
from
last
night
.
the
follow
be
say
in
relation
to
the
view
of
the
former
minister
,
Dermot
Ahern
:
when
the
debate
take
place
at
that
time
,
the
economic
climate
be
such
that
spending
on
a
referendum
might
not
have
be
prudent
or
even
financially
feasible
,
so
the
Defamation
Act
1961
be
update
instead
because
there
be
a
lacuna
in
which
there
be
a
offence
define
in
the
constitution
...
yet
it
do
not
have
a
place
on
the
Statute
Book
.
the
government
of
the
day
should
have
have
the
moral
courage
to
hold
a
referendum
on
this
issue
.
instead
of
do
so
,
the
government
introduce
a
act
which
arguably
make
matter
bad
.
by
remove
a
formal
link
between
Judeo
-
Christianity
and
blasphemy
,
it
become
a
matter
for
each
religious
group
to
define
for
itself
what
matter
be
sacred
.
there
be
no
free
speech
provision
in
subsection
3
of
the
2009
Act
.
a
example
of
the
effect
of
that
be
that
Salman
Rushdie
's
guilt
or
innocence
depend
on
a
court
's
finding
that
he
book
,
the
Satanic
Verses
,
have
genuine
literary
value
.
under
section
36
(
2
)
(
a
)
,
individual
sect
or
religion
would
be
leave
free
to
police
what
be
consider
blasphemous
.
it
do
not
address
a
lacuna
,
as
be
state
last
night
,
but
in
effect
make
matter
bad
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
I
thank
all
the
Member
of
the
House
present
,
and
that
who
be

the

I
also
welcome

be
apparent
from

this

that
echow
the
very
high
level
of
support
which
,
as
many
people
have
,
be
already
visible
from
the
people
's
vote
we
have
on
this
issue
in
the
referendum
last
October
.
I
also
believe
that
the
intention
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
assume
the
Bill
be
accord
passage
through
the
remain
stage
,
be
to
commence
the

as
quickly
as
possible
.
I
note
a
few
comment
from
deputy
Mattie
McGrath
,
as
he
be
in
the
House
.
what
the
deputy
reference
happen
in

something

could
note
that
the

in
response
to
the

comment
,
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
in
present
the
Bill
express
the
government
's
abhorrence
at
the
use
of
reference
to

I
move
:
that
leave
be
grant
to
introduce
a
Bill
entitle
a
act
to
provide
for
the
provision
of
datum
by
television
broadcasting
service

in
its
2018
report
and
recommendation
on
the
five
-
year
review
of
public
funding
conduct
under
section
124
of
the
Broadcasting
Act
2009
,
the
Broadcasting
Authority
of
Ireland
,
BAI
,
highlight
the
very
difficult
situation
face
by
public
service
broadcaster
and
urge
the
government
to
take
urgent
,
decisive
and
substantive
action
.
specifically
,
the
BAI
find
that
public
service
broadcasting
and
public
service
broadcaster
face
critical
and
urgent
challenge
and
it
be
clear
the
current
funding
situation
be
not
sustainable
.
it
find
that
,
at
a
minimum
,
RTÉ
should
receive
a
increase
in
its
annual
public
funding
of
€
30
million
with
immediate
effect
on
the
basis
that
the
broadcaster
meet
certain
condition
,
which
be
strategic
in
nature
,
and
have
audience
at
the
core
of
its
consideration
.
it
also
find
that
there
should
be
a
increase
of
€
6
million
per
annum
in
public
funding
for
TG4
over
and
above
its
2017
public
funding
provision
,
with
full
effect
from
2018
and
onwards
over
the
period
of
tg4'
strategy
.
in
response
to
the
BAI
report
,
the
Government
have
announce
the
tv
licence
fee
funding
system
will
be
replace
by
a
device
independent
broadcasting
charge
,
which
will
take
account
of
technological
change
and
will
enable
the
sustainable
funding
of
public
service
content
in
the
long
term
.
however
,
this
will
take
time
to
develop
and
implement
and
in
the
interim
the
current
tv
licence
collection
contract
will
be
retain
and
be
to
be
put
out
to
public
tender
for
a
five
-
year
period
.
the
tv
licence
fee
evasion
rate
be
difficult
to
quantify
.
a
rate
of
between
12
%
and
14
%
be
generally
accept
.
in
2018
,
€
221
million
in
licence
fee
be
collect
,
of
which
€
189
million
be
receive
by
RTÉ
and
the
rest
support
other
public
service
broadcaster
and
independent
producer
.
in
the
same
year
,
RTÉ
make
a
loss
of
€
13
million
.
it
seem
clear
that
a
more
efficient
collection
system
could
increase
licence
fee
revenue
by
between
€
25
million
and
€
30
million
,
which
be
more
than
double
the
amount
of
RTÉ
's
annual
loss
.
without
prejudice
to
any
prefer
permanent
funding
solution
,
datum
share
between
a
Post
or
any
future
licence
fee
collector
and
the
current
tv
service
provider
would
reduce
evasion
rate
.
a
simple
cross-checking
of
list
of
licence
fee
payer
and
subscriber
to
Sky
,
Virgin
and
other
would
identify
that
who
should
be
pay
for
a
tv
licence
but
be
not
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
confer
statutory
authority
for
such
datum
share
.
the
Bill
be
,
by
its
Long

I
do

cut
across

on

three
of
my
question
have
be
rule
out

they
relate
to
Operation
Freeflow
,
the
budget
line
for
the
new
Garda
operational
division
and
the
number
of
community
gardaí
.
I
have
be
tell
this
be
operational
matter
for
the
Garda
,
but
they
be
also
issue
of
government
policy
and
matter
about
which
the
government
speak
very
strongly
.
I
be
frustrated
that
this
priority
question
have
be
rule
out
of
order
.
the
question
also
relate
to
policy
matter
.
I
thank
deputy
O'Callaghan
for
allow
I
to
interject
.
the
question
be
self
-
explanatory
.
how
many
time
have
the
Garda
air
support
unit
be
use
in
each
of
the
year
from
2016
to
2018
and
to
date
in
2019
?
what
be
the
reason
for
deployment
and
the
cost
involve
for
each
deployment
?
from
what
area
be
fund
obtain
?
I
seek
a
perspective
from
the
minister
regard
the
use
of
this
service
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
.
we
all
agree
that
this
be
a
invaluable
service
that
we
would
wish
to
see
further
resource
if
possible
.
do
the
vast
bulk
of
that
deployment
take
place
in
the
Dublin
metropolitan
area
?
be
there
scope
for
extend
the
deployment
of
the
resource
to
a
more
diverse
geographical

include
the
south
,
south

the
Acting
Chairman
be
very
kind
.
I
thank
my
colleague
and
I
apologise
for
not
be
here
on
time
.
I
congratulate
the
minister
because
I
genuinely
believe
he
make
a
decent
effort
in
bring
the
Bill
before
we
.
the
process
start
with
Grace
O'Sullivan
,
mep
.
I
have
have
some
pitch
battle
,
if
I
could
put
it
that
way
,
with
the
minister
on
occasion
in
respect
of
this
legislation
and
we
have
one
or
two
stand
-
up
row
.
notwithstanding
the
minister
's
current
travail
,
he
genuinely
seek
to
legislate
for
this
matter
and
I
appreciate
he
effort
in
that
regard
.
I
tell
he
this
could
be
he
lasting
legacy
.
I
be
not
sure
about
the
housing
issue
,
but
this
certainly
could
be
something
that
will
be
part
of
he
legacy
as
minister
and
I
congratulate
he
in
that
regard
.
I
want
to
satisfy
myself
that
the
issue
raise
on
second
stage
have
be
comfortably
deal
with
and
that
,
once
the
legislation
come
into
effect
,
we
will
ban
microplastic
in
this
country
.
I
again
seek
that
reassurance
from
the
minister
.
as
I
say
,
the
former
Senator
,
Grace
O'Sullivan
,
mep
,
start
the
ball
roll
on
this
legislation
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
take
up
the
cudgel
and
I
accept
that
the
minister
have
be
genuine
in
he
attempt
to
legislate
and
make
Ireland
,
as
a
island
nation
,
a
forerunner
in
western
Europe
on
this
vital
issue
.
I
be
just
go
to
say
that
the
idea
of
a
recommittal
,
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
amenable
,
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
.
we
will
,
however
,
be
direct
by
he
on
this
issue
.
the
Acting
Chairman
have
be
very
helpful
in
allow
we
to
come
back
in
and
make
contribution
.
technically
,
we
should
not
.
this
issue
be
not
the
subject
of
amendment
either
,
and
that
be
why
we
be
seek
this
clarification
.
I
be
grateful
to
the
acting
chairman
.
regard
section
9
,
the
Minister
of
State
have
already
provide
clarity
to
we
,
outside
of
this
House
,
regard
that
club
we
all
represent
,
include
GAA
club
,
community
organisation
etc.
that
run
bingo
game
on
a
Friday
night
.
I
refer
to
a
local
volunteer
call
the
ball
in
the
game
where
perhaps
€
1000
be
bring
in
and
€
800
be
pay
out
in
prize
,
with
a
small
surplus
go
back
into
the
community
organisation
or
the
GAA
club
.
the
Minister
of
State
would
be
do
we
a
great
service
if
he
be
to
give
we
some
comfort
by
confirm
that
such
activity
will
not
fall
foul
of
this
legislation
.
I
also
refer
to
the
rollover
of
GAA
lottery
run
on
a
community
basis
,
as
deputy
Scanlon
mention
.
there
be
much
worry
abroad
regard
whether
local
GAA
lottery
,
in
particular
,
will
be
allow
to
roll
over
under
this
legislation
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
I
signal
my
party
's
intention
to
support
the
amendment
.
I
will
speak
in
the
same
vein
as
deputy
Scanlon
and
refer
to
parish
and
community
organisation
,
a
example
of
which
be
to
be
find
in
Kildorrery
in
my
own
native
Cork
.
a
bingo
game
be
run
there
which
take
in
approximately
€
1100
and
approximately
€900
be
pay
out
.
I
will
refer
to
the
point
make
by
deputy
Michael
Healy
-
Rae
,
although
he
may
be
on
the
phone
and
indispose
.
with
regard
to
the
deputy
's
point
,
the
prize
fund
in
this
particular
instance
be
predetermine
.
I
seek
clarification
from
the
Minister
of
State
.
will
the
propose
section
26a
apply
to
this
particular
operation
?
this
section
state
:
section
26
shall
not
apply
to
a
lottery
where
—
(
a
)
the
total
value
of
the
prize
be
not
more
than
€
1000
,
(
b
)
the
price
of
each
ticket
be
not
more
than
€
5
,
(
c
)
the
maximum
number
of
ticket
sell
be
not
more
than
1500
,
(
would
)
the
lottery
be
conduct
for
the
benefit
of
a
charitable
or
philanthropic
purpose
,
and
(
e
)
the
promoter
of
the
lottery
derive
no
personal
profit
from
the
lottery
and
have
not
conduct
a
lottery
in
accordance
with
this
section
during
the
precede
3
month
.
to
be
fair
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
he
be
my
constituency
colleague
and
I
do
not
believe
he
would
seek
to
shut
down
operation
such
as
this
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
this
voluntary
organisation
some
clarity
and
comfort
tonight
.
to
return
to
the
bingo
game
in
Kildorrery
,
and
in
every
community
across
the
land
,
it
make
a
few
bob
for
the
GAA
,
the
local
development
association
and
community
endeavour
.
it
be
not
for
profit
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
will
clarify
that
point
,
I
be
sure
many
of
we
will
be
very
satisfied
.
I
be
sure
he
will
do
so
.
the
second
issue
be
about
how
roll
-
over
jackpot
will
be
deal
with
under
this
legislation
.
I
be
confident
the
Minister
of
State
will
provide
some
clarity
on
this
issue
as
well
.
my
final
point
relate
to
circumstance
in
which
a
GAA
club
,
for
example
,
give
away
a
house
as
a
prize
.
this
have
be
know
to
happen
.
a
number
of
GAA
club
across
the
country
be
now
sell
ticket
for
raffle
or
lottery
in
which
the
prize
be
a
house
.
what
will
be
the
threshold
for
such
lottery
?
there
be
reference
to
a
figure
of
€
360000
in
the
legislation
.
give
the
value
of
particular
house
in
particular
part
of
the
country
,
that
threshold
of
€
360000
could
easily
be
surpass
.
I
be
come
from
a
place
of
ignorance
in
this
regard
.
I
seek
to
be
educate
by
the
Minister
of
State
on
that
point
.
that
be
the
key
point
.
I
recognise
that
they
do
not
strictly
relate
to
the
set
of
amendment
now
be
discuss
but
they
be
the
issue
exercising
many
of
we
at
this
point
.
two
minute
.
I
be
,
again
,
seek
clarification
on
the
rollover
jackpot
.
for
example
,
Béal
Átha
a
Ghaorthaidh
,
Ballingeary
,
which
be
not
in
my
constituency
,
currently
have
a
lottery
jackpot
of
€
15000
.
it
be
€
14800
last
week
and
,
as
it
be
not
win
,
it
be
increase
by
€200
this
week
.
I
may
have
misheard
the
Minister
of
State
when
he
speak
about
rollover
jackpot
previously
.
I
be
seek
clarification
on
whether
the
GAA
club
that
run
that
lottery
be
now
require
to
apply
for
a
licence
.
I
be
not
sure
of
the
history
of
this
particular
lottery
but
my
understanding
be
that
under
section
26
(
a
)
if
the
total
prize
be
under
€
1000
it
would
not
have
to
apply
for
a
permit
or
a
licence
but
by
dint
of
a
rollover
mechanism
it
now
have
to
apply
for
a
licence
.
I
be
seek
clarification
on
whether
it
have
to
make
a
weekly
application
or
if
it
be
a
once
off
process
once
it
go
over
the
term
of
section
26
(
a
)
if
that
be
what
its
intention
be
in
the
first
instance
.
I
hope
that
make
sense
.
I
move
:
"
that
report
stage
be
take
now
.

I
move

profit

.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
issue
.
regard
the
closure
of
the
greyhound
track
in
Youghal
,
I
think
Youghal
be
be
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
expediency
.
it
be
a
profit
centre
that
be
wash
its
face
.
the
term
of
reference
set
out
with
regard
to
the
Indecon
report
seem
to
have
work
unfairly
against
centre
like
Youghal
.
there
will
be
a
good
fight
by
the
people
of
Youghal
regard
the
proposal
to
close
this
track
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
the
lack
of
school
place
in
east
Cork
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
will
be
aware
of
the
proposal
regard
Carrigtwohill
community
college
.
the
people
of
Carrigtwohill
be
now
be
tell
that
it
could
be
2023
by
the
time
the
school
open
there
and
that
a
process
be
be
go
through
with
Cork
County
Council
.
we
have
have
some
engagement
with
the
education
and
training
board
.
as
late
as
last
Friday
,
we
be
tell
that
a
certain
number
of
place
for
the
Carrigtwohill
area
for
the
2020
intake
up
to
2023
will
be
provide
.
notwithstanding
that
,
I
wish
to
put
to
the
minister
the
fact
that
we
be
receive
many
email
and
phone
call
from
parent
who
find
themselves
fall
foul
of
the
enrolment
policy
as
instigate
by
the
community
college
in
Carrigtwohill
through
no
fault
of
they
own
.
they
be
bereft
at
the
fact
that
notwithstand
the
proposal
to
put
in
place
new
class
for
September
2020
,
there
be
no
guarantee
that
a
certain
number
of
that
parent
will
have
place
for
they
son
and
daughter
for
September
2020
and
onwards
.
it
apply
not
only
in
Carrigtwohill
but
in
Midleton
.
I
know
the
minister
be
a
person
of
deep
empathy
who
would
be
very
mindful
and
conscious
of
the
need
of
family
and
will
appreciate
that
at
this
juncture
,
there
be
no
guarantee
of
place
for
that
student
in
Carrigtwohill
,
which
cause
a
massive
amount
of
stress
for
that
family
.
I
wish
to
bear
witness
for
that
family
because
they
be
be
tell
that
by
dint
of
the
enrolment
policy
,
particularly
where
there
be
two
sibling
,
one
girl
and
one
boy
,
if
the
girl
have
receive
a
place
in
another
all
-
girl
school
,
the
boy
who
may
wish
to
enrol
in
Carrigtwohill
community
college
be
not
guarantee
a
place
.
this
be
a
function
of
the
enrolment
policy
.
I
have
be
tell
by
the
education
and
training
board
that
this
position
be
entirely
legal
.
I
understand
that
to
a
certain
extent
but
in
a
era
where
equality
matter
,
it
must
be
the
case
that
the
government
do
everything
it
can
to
ensure
that
family
be
not
divide
in
town
like
Carrigtwohill
by
dint
of
a
enrolment
policy
where
there
be
no
guarantee
of
a
place
notwithstand
the
effort
of
the
education
and
training
board
to
provide
extra
classroom
and
the
fact
that
the
education
and
training
board
be
engage
with
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
as
of
18
November
regard
future
provision
of
place
.
we
must
still
ensure
that
no
young
student
be
without
a
school
place
so
I
ask
the
minister
to
do
he
level
well
on
this
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
about
the
additional
two
classroom
and
ongoing
engagement
between
he
official
and
the
ETB
that
the
minister
have
lay
before
the
House
,
there
remain
the
problem
that
,
even
when
that
capacity
be
achieve
,
there
will
still
be
unmet
demand
from
parent
and
student
in
the
east
Cork
area
.
it
should
be
take
into
account
that
2020
be
the
timeline
for
the
delivery
of
the
school
campus
.
I
should
respectfully
correct
the
minister
and
say
that
this
have
be
on
the
agenda
since
2012
.
even
when
that
temporary
infrastructure
be
build
and
the
demand
for
place
be
meet
through
the
new
campus
,
parent
will
still
not
know
where
they
child
will
be
go
to
school
and
that
might
be
the
case
into
May
of
next
year
.
we
cannot
countenance
a
situation
where
we
have
uncertainty
that
be
cause
major
stress
and
strain
for
parent
.
Parent
would
be
reassure
if
that
could
be
look
at
.
there
be
no
guarantee
from
the
etb
that
demand
can
be
meet
at
present
.
that
be
what
the
ETB
be
tell
we
.

under

as
we

in

57

the

we
classify

as
valid
centre
for
people
to
present
to
ensure
that
we
stave
off
the
over
-
crowding
that
be
currently
take
place
in

we
cannot
have
a
situation
whereby
Dr.
Padraig

,

be

the

come
from

at

that

when

centre
and

be
completely
over
-
run
.
will
the
Taoiseach
take
a
look
at
it
personally
?
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
I
support
the
Bill
and
welcome
the
initiative
by
deputy
Curran
in
respect
of
this
matter
.
I
share
the
sentiment
express
by
the
Minister
of
State
about
the
exist
offence
.
he
say
that
the
exist
offence
do
not
require
physical
custody
of
the
drug
and
the
prosecution
can
prove
constructive
possession
,
for
example
,
when
drug
be
purchase
online
but
not
deliver
into
the
hand
of
the
accuse
.
in
the
propose
offence
,
additional
proof
may
be
require
,
which
be
not
require
to
prove
possession
,
and
,
therefore
,
this
offence
might
unintentionally
be
more
difficult
to
prove
than
the
exist
offence
.
I
be
sure
deputy
Curran
will
clarify
that
at
a
further
stage
in
the
proceedings
.
it
be
a
legitimate
issue
to
be
raise
.
through
popular
culture
and
various
television
drama
,
we
be
now
see
the
articulation
or
expression
of
the
exploitation
of
child
,
be
it
the
passing
of
the
burner
phone
or
child
act
as
mule
or
lookout
.
it
be
a
reflection
of
the
reality
on
the
ground
.
we
be
face
with
the
vista
of
child
be
exploit
in
this
way
,
with
impunity
,
by
this
malevolent
force
in
we
society
.
I
share
the
view
express
by
previous
speaker
about
the
need
to
ensure
that
child
be
not
exploit
and
that
there
should
be
a
penalty
for
the
exploitation
of
a
child
.
on
that
basis
,
we
support
the
legislation
.

I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
issue
today
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
deputy
Zappone
,
be
before
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
early
today
,
where
she
agree
to
make
available
a
programme
support
payment
of
,
as
I
understand
it
,
approximately
€
1500
to
childcare
provider
.
in
many
case
,
insurance
cost
be
increase
twofold
,
tenfold
and
,
in
some
instance
,
20
-
fold
,
in
particular
for
non-member
of
early
Childhood
Ireland
.
a
provider
in
my
constituency
who
pay
€
550
in
2019
be
be
quote
€
2100
for
next
year
by
Arachas
.
the
operator
have
be
tell
that
if
she
pay
€
245
to
join
early
Childhood
Ireland
,
which
be
partly
fund
by
the
government
,
she
will
only
have
to
pay
€
1500
.
the
risk
profile
of
this
service
have
not
increase
and
it
have
pass
all
of
the
regulatory
rigour
.
it
be
vital
that
service
that
be
not
member
of
early
Childhood
Ireland
be
not
penalise
.
I
appreciate
the
statement
the
minister
have
make
on
the
average
payment
of
€
1500
per
provider
.
there
need
to
be
great
interrogation
of
how
that
scheme
be
propose
to
be
roll
out
.
the
question
be
whether
it
will
give
comfort
to
the
provider
that
I
refer
to
early
.
I
do
not
buy
the
argument
make
by
the
insurance
sector
that
risk
profile
have
increase
.
if
people
,
provider
and
owner
have
be
compliant
up
to
now
,
either
through
the
HSE
or
through
Tusla
,
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
,
I
do
not
understand
how
they
risk
profile
have
all
of
a
sudden
increase
to
the
point
where
they
insurance
premium
be
be
increase
to
the
extent
of
they
be
.
I
go
back
to
the
point
that
I
make
about
one
provider
who
be
now
be
penalise
,
even
though
that
provider
's
risk
profile
have
not
increase
.
this
provider
be
be
tell
that
if
it
join
early
Childhood
Ireland
,
it
pay
€
240
,
the
€
2100
that
be
be
quote
now
through
Arachas
be
reduce
to
€
1500
.
that
blow
the
risk
profile
argument
out
of
the
water
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
have
regard
to
that
.
in
the
Committee
on
Children
and
Youth
affair
meeting
today
,
deputy
Rabbitte
call
for
a
dedicated
Oireachtas
helpline
so
that
we
can
work
through
case
like
that
and
bring
they
directly
to
the
minister
's
Department
.
I
also
support
the
call
here
that
Irish
public
body
or
some
other
such
institution
should
now
be
able
to
step
into
the
breach
to
cover
the
risk
.
they
be
all
go
to
Mallow
.
this
be
a
bit
surreal
.
I
move
:
''
that
Dáil

I

time
with

Burton
,
if
she
turn
up

and
the
effect

on

there
be
some
universal
principle
that

recognise

we

on

such

have
already

we
acknowledge
the
announcement
by
the
minister
that
the
government
propose
to
extend
the
ban
to
a
large
number
of
town
.
we
want
the

produce

,

of

the

in
the

's

will
reduce
Ireland

.
the
purpose
of
the
motion
be
to
focus
on
the
effect
of
pollution
on
people
's
health
and
the
unfairness
of
society
pay
the
cost
of
pollution
while
business
continue
to
make
profit
.
I
refer
to
the
issue
of
trust
and
certainty
.
business
like
certainty
,
especially
when
it
come
to
make
long
-
term
investment
.
government
regulation
of
the
economy
should
be
not
only
be
clearly
signal
in
advance
but
should
be
follow
through
.
when
government
fail
to
do
what
they
promise
,
as
Fine
Gael
do
in
the
case
of
the
ban
on
smoky
coal
,
it
undermine
public
trust
in
politics
and
business
's
ability
to
make
investment
.
I
be
aware
of
many
fuel
business
throughout
the
country
that
make
expensive
investment
to
be
ready
to
produce
smokeless
coal
in
time
for
the
introduction
of
the
initial
smoky
coal
ban
.
one
could
say
they
be
stab
in
the
back
by
Fine
Gael
's
failure
to
go
through
with
the
ban
for
entirely
spurious
reason
.
if
there
be
a
legal
case
to
be
make
against
the
ban
on
smoky
fuel
,
it
would
already
have
be
make
with
regard
to
the
city
and
town
where
it
be
ban
and
turf
and
wet
wood
may
still
be
burn
.
the
government
's
argument
,
repeat
in
amendment
no.
3
to
the
Labour
Party
motion
,
be
weak
and
implausible
.
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
draw
be
that
Fine
Gael
have
some
other
reason
for
refuse
to
implement
the
nationwide
ban
.
I
hope
this
reason
will
be
bring
to
light
by
the
minister
tonight
.
while
we
welcome
as
progress
the
suggestion
that
the
ban
be
extend
to
other
town
on
a
piecemeal
basis
,
this
be
a
clear
example
of
the
government
's
failure
to
understand
how
the
ban
be
to
be
enforce
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
outline
which
town
be
cover
under
this
approach
.
I
do
not
believe
anyone
intend
to
have
inspector
call
from
house
to
house
to
check
what
people
be
burn
.
the
easy
way
to
implement
a
ban
be
to
enforce
it
at
the
point
of
sale
.
through
Revenue
,
we
know
where
all
the
fuel
merchant
be
base
and
we
can
keep
a
eye
on
what
they
be
sell
.
Partial
ban
mean
that
fuel
sale
can
continue
down
the
road
from
town
with
a
ban
and
that
make
enforcement
more
expensive
and
complicated
.
Fine
Gael
's
extension
of
the
smoky
coal
ban
to
a
further
13
town
be
arguably
a
face
-
save
exercise
that
will
deny
life
-
save
improvement
in
air
quality
to
dozen
of
other
town
and
village
around
the
country
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
we
seem
to
have
cross-party
support
from
a
majority
of
deputy
in
favour
of
implement
a
nationwide
ban
on
smoky
coal
.
if
we
motion
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
,
I
expect
the
government
to
acknowledge
that
and
honour
the
Dáil
's
decision
by
implement
a
full
nationwide
ban
.
amendment
Nosemcue
1
,
2
and
4
propose
by
other
party
leave
the
Labour
Party
's
substantial
motion
entirely
or
mostly
intact
.
they
add
value
to
we
motion
and
we
welcome
that
.
in
essence
,
if
this
motion
be
pass
,
we
want
the
government
to
recognise
the
motion
and
simply
seek
to
have
its
content
implement
in
a
way
that
ensure
the
smoky
coal
ban
be
extend
countrywide
.
the
benefit
of
do
that
would
be
self
-
evident
.
it
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
minister
to
use
the
argument
that
EU
law
or
competition
law
could
act
as
a
impediment
to
that
.
if
he
already
recognise
the
smoky
coal
ban
exist
and
it
be
he
intention
to
extend
it
to
a
certain
number
of
town
,
that
surely
negate
the
argument
regard
non-adherence
to
competition
rule
.
I
put
forward
a
parliamentary
question
on
this
issue
on
10
December
which
note
that
a
company
,
PurpleAir
,
in
my
native
Cork
have
numerous
air
quality
monitoring
station
.
Cork
city
have
have
a
smoky
coal
ban
in
place
since
1995
.
notwithstanding
that
and
the
fact
that
PurpleAir
be
now
in
situ
monitor
air
quality
,
there
be
still
a
serious
issue
with
air
quality
in
Cork
city
and
at
certain
other
point
in
the
county
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
parochial
about
this
issue
.
I
have
use
Cork
as
a
example
but
the
situation
there
would
be
reflect
in
many
town
and
city
throughout
the
country
.
in
he
reply
to
my
question
as
to
whether
he
attention
have
be
draw
to
the
poor
air
quality
in
Cork
,
the
minister
state
:
further
extension
of
the
smoky
coal
ban
in
key
location
would
have
a
positive
impact
on
air
quality
and
public
health
,
particularly
in
build
up
area
.
regard
the
propose
national
extension
to
the
smoky
coal
ban
,
a
number
of
coal
firm
have
indicate
that
they
would
challenge
the
proposal
to
expand
the
smoky
coal
ban
nationwide
,
and
also
challenge
the
exist
ban
on
the
basis
that
the
State
should
also
apply
such
a
ban
to
the
burning
of
other
fossil
fuel
,
include
wood
and
peat
product
.
there
be
nothing
in
this
motion
that
seek
to
extend
a
ban
on
peat
or
wood
product
but
there
be
a
precedent
whereby
the
State
have
already
implement
a
smoky
coal
ban
.
if
industry
be
ready
for
that
in
the
past
,
it
can
be
ready
again
to
implement
a
nationwide
ban
.
let
we
put
that
to
the
test
and
let
we
not
be
fearful
of
litigation
or
of
take
on
the
vested
interest
who
might
seek
to
prevent
we
from
have
circumstance
in
which
air
quality
would
be
improve
immensely
throughout
the
State
.
we
will
need
two
five
-
minute
slot
.
I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Fitzmaurice
.
hopefully
somebody
will
send
out
a
text
to
tell
he
he
will
be
up
in
five
minute
.
every
week
we
be
in
this
Chamber
or
at
a
committee
talk
about
climate
action
.
if
the
government
be
to
achieve
everything
that
it
have
set
out
in
the
climate
action
plan
,
it
would
be
useful
if
we
could
nail
down
the
financial
package
involve
.
let
we
take
target
around
afforestation
or
the
retrofit
of
house
.
while
I
do
not
wish
to
be
partisan
tonight
,
by
any
objective
analysis
,
there
be
only
300
deep
retrofit
carry
out
in
2019
when
the
government
have
speak
about
commit
to
a
b2
ber
standard
for
50000
house
per
annum
.
this
will
require
money
.
if
the
minister
be
talk
about
ring
-
fencing
carbon
tax
to
build
a
fund
,
it
be
arguable
that
that
resource
may
not
meet
the
demand
,
particularly
in
the
transport
sector
and
with
the
provision
of
roll
stock
to
meet
public
transport
demand
.
there
be
the
issue
of
put
together
the
fund
which
will
retrofit
local
authority
housing
.
there
be
issue
with
the
just
transition
.
I
be
glad
Mr.
Kieran
Mulvey
be
mention
tonight
because
he
be
normally
the
person
the
government
of
the
day
call
in
to
act
as
chief
firefighter
.
he
have
a
remarkable
record
in
that
respect
.
if
we
be
serious
about
the
just
transition
,
and
the
midland
be
ground
zero
for
this
,
it
must
be
resource
adequately
.
we
then
need
to
see
how
that
just
transition
be
replicate
throughout
the
State
because
other
part
of
the
country
would
have
that
transition
from
carbon
produce
,
particularly
my
area
,
which
be
the
main
hub
for
energy
source
for
a
significant
part
of
the
island
.
we
be
anxiously
wait
to
see
what
funding
will
be
make
available
for
this
just
transition
for
the
remainder
of
the
country
.
notwithstanding
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Mulvey
,
the
jury
be
still
out
on
how
that
process
in
the
midland
be
go
.
it
be
early
day
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
the
financial
element
of
what
be
propose
.
the
European
Union
have
propose
a
€
100
billion
fund
.
what
be
the
government
's
thinking
on
how
much
will
be
available
for
Ireland
to
draw
down
?
as
I
understand
it
,
the
package
have
yet
to
be
sign
off
on
but
it
be
in
play
.
in
the
context
of
the
agricultural
sector
in
particular
,
what
will
the
permutation
of
the
negotiation
relate
to
the
multi-annual
financial
framework
mean
for
the
next
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
?
right
now
,
we
be
be
tell
that
the
CAP
negotiation
could
become
not
interminable
,
but
could
surpass
the
closing
date
of
the
current
cap
.
there
be
a
opportunity
to
invest
in
agriculture
in
partnership
with
farmer
on
carbon
sequestration
.
what
funding
measure
do
the
minister
envisage
could
be
bring
to
bear
?
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
Creed
,
will
have
a
view
on
that
,
but
I
would
like
to
hear
the
view
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
on
it
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
draft
national
energy
and
climate
plan
?
we
have
some
deliberation
on
this
matter
in
the
committee
today
.
obviously
,
we
want
to
ensure
the
voice
of
the
Oireachtas
committee
be
hear
when
we
reach
a
point
when
there
be
consensus
-
hopefully
there
will
be
consensus
-
on
that
draft
national
energy
and
climate
plan
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
have
regard
to
what
the
Oireachtas
committee
have
to
say
.
absolutely
.
absolutely
.
absolutely
.
absolutely
.
absolutely

absolutely
.
absolutely
.
absolutely

absolutely
.
I
thank
sincerely
the
people
of
Cork
East
for
give
I
a
mandate
again
to
serve
they
in
this
,
the
thirty
-
third
dáil
.
I
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
and
sense
of
pride
in
be
here
today
.
I
make
a
very
simple
request
of
this
Dáil
,
while
we
be
in
a
collegiate
frame
of
mind
.
two
specific
issue
come
up
on
the
doorstep
aside
from
housing
and
so
on
,
namely
the
future
of
the
early
year
sector
and
people
with
intellectual
disability
not
have
have
the
requisite
access
to
service
that
they
desire
.
I
request
that
we
in
this
House
would
agree
to
convene
two
all
-
party
committee
to
deal
with
that
two
issue
.
if
we
could
,
by
agreement
,
come
to
a
consensus
on
what
the
future
of
the
early
year
sector
should
look
like
,
by
way
of
a
all
-
party
,
non-partisan
approach
,
we
would
do
a
great
service
to
the
people
who
work
and
operate
in
that
sector
.
a
similar
approach
should
be
adopt
on
behalf
of
that
family
touch
by
intellectual
disability
.
there
be
a
great
need
for
this
society
and
for
we
not
to
view
this
issue
as
partisan
but
as
issue
on
which
we
must
deliver
for
the
people
.
I
will
write
to
the
party
leader
to
make
that
request
but
I
be
hopeful
that
we
could
arrive
at
a
consensus
on
that
specific
issue
.
the
Business
Committee
will
convene
next
week
as
a
matter
of
urgency
to
begin
the
process
of
plan
what
work
we
can
undertake
.
I
wish
to
express
solidarity
with
deputy
McDonald
and
she
family
,
and
with
any
family
throughout
the
State
and
on
the
island
who
find
themselves
under
the
strain
at
this
time
.
collectively
,
we
in
the
Dáil
must
up
we
game
with
regard
to
Covid
-
19
.
in
the
UK
,
the
Prime
Minister
have
announce
that
worker
will
be
entitle
to
statutory
sick
pay
if
they
be
self
-
isolate
in
case
of
coronavirus
.
the
Conservative
government
have
also
modify
the
entitlement
rule
such
that
worker
will
be
pay
from
day
one
,
not
the
fourth
day
.
this
be
not
because
of
they
love
of
worker
's
rights
,
it
be
because
this
measure
be
necessary
to
help
contain
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
have
call
for
the
same
change
to
be
make
here
but
the
government
have
,
so
far
,
fail
to
move
on
this
issue
.
if
worker
cannot
pay
the
rent
or
put
food
on
the
table
they
will
go
to
work
even
if
they
be
at
risk
of
spread
Covid
-
19
.
this
be
the
reality
of
we
economy
.
we
need
to
change
the
social
protection
rule
so
that
worker
can
afford
to
stay
at
home
if
they
need
to
self
-
isolate
.
there
might
be
some
who
think
that
thing
be
somehow
bad
in
the
UK
than
here
,
but
please
consider
that
with
87
case
of
the
virus
,
the
UK
have
have
one
case
per
764000
people
in
the
population
.
we
have
have
six
confirm
case
of
Covid
-
19
,
which
be
one
case
per
805000
people
in
the
population
.
in
other
word
,
it
could
be
argue
that
we
have
proportionately
as
many
case
of
Covid
-
19
in
Ireland
as
in
the
UK
.
we
should
be
take
the
risk
of
the
virus
spread
as
seriously
as
it
be
be
take
by
the
UK
and
other
government
in
Europe
.
it
may
become
necessary
to
move
from
voluntary
self
-
isolation
to
require
people
to
stay
at
home
if
they
be
contagious
.
it
may
become
necessary
to
restrict
movement
to
or
from
some
part
of
the
country
if
the
virus
spread
in
that
area
.
it
may
also
be
necessary
to
outlaw
price
hike
or
hoarding
of
sanitiser
or
other
medical
goods
or
even
of
food
.
exist
law
,
which
largely
date
from
just
after
the
second
World
War
and
from
the
19th
century
,
do
not
provide
the
government
with
the
legal
power
to
do
this
thing
,
especially
in
relation
to
potential
case
rather
than
confirm
case
of
infectious
disease
.
the
caretaker
government
that
we
have
have
no
democratic
mandate
or
legitimacy
in
introduce
such
serious
measure
if
they
become
require
.
the
government
have
propose
to
provide
briefing
to
Opposition
party
or
to
consult
they
.
this
be
not
acceptable
.
it
be
not
for
a
interim
government
or
interim
minister
,
some
of
whom
be
no
long
member
of
the
Dáil
,
merely
to
inform
Opposition
member
about
what
they
be
do
.
the
Minister
for
Health
be
part
of
a
interim
government
,
head
by
a
Taoiseach
who
fail
to
secure
the
confidence
of
the
majority
of
the
Dáil
at
its
first
meeting
.
the
Labour
Party
's
proposal
for
a
dáil
committee
on
Covid
-
19
have
,
perhaps
,
be
misconstrue
or
insufficiently
explain
by
we
.
let
I
clarify
we
proposal
.
in
the
absence
of
a
new
government
that
can
command
the
confidence
of
a
majority
in
the
Dáil
,
it
be
the
dáil
itself
that
should
be
make
this
decision
,
not
a
caretaker
government
.
a
dáil
committee
on
Covid
-
19
would
not
be
a
talking
shop
take
up
hour
of
health
official
's
time
.
it
should
be
a
executive
group
that
would
work
with
the
interim
minister
to
provide
democratic
legitimacy
for
the
difficult
decision
that
may
be
require
.
this
group
should
literally
be
available
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
agree
action
that
be
necessary
.
this
be
not
just
health
decision
.
they
be
decision
about
transport
,
retail
and
control
of
people
's
liberty
.
potentially
,
we
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
cancel
St.
Patrick
's
Day
parade
before
the
Dáil
meet
again
in
two
week
.
while
other
have
speak
about
the
Dáil
's
willingness
to
meet
to
pass
legislation
,
we
all
know
that
this
cannot
happen
overnight
whereas
some
of
the
vital
decision
that
may
be
require
in
the
come
week
may
require
rapid
decision
-
make
to
respond
to
a
quickly
evolve
emergency
.
this
be
how
serious
the
situation
be
.
we
must
not
be
complacent
.
the
public
need
to
see
the
political
system
act
responsibly
and
maturely
in
response
to
Covid
-
19
.
we
need
to
get
ahead
of
the
issue
so
that
we
can
shut
down
misinformation
and
unnecessary
panic
.
I
would
make
the
point
that
the
Dáil
sit
overnight
when
it
come
to
the
financial
crisis
.
the
Dáil
also
take
immediate
and
strong
action
when
farming
be
threaten
by
foot
-
and
-
mouth
disease
.
person
's
life
and
they
peace
of
mind
be
be
threaten
by
Covid
-
19
.
it
be
unthinkable
that
we
would
be
any
less
diligent
and
responsive
to
Covid
-
19
when
there
be
clear
evidence
that
this
be
a
very
serious
emergency
.
I
speak
to
the
mother
of
a
child
with
a
compromise
immune
system
.
she
cannot
understand
why
the
government
have
not
require
business
to
provide
hand
sanitiser
,
as
we
do
for
foot
-
and
-
mouth
.
the
people
want
clear
instruction
and
guidance
,
include
on
travel
and
ordinary
business
,
to
come
from
that
with
democratic
legitimacy
.
this
be
not
a
sensationalist
position
.
on
30
January
,
the
World
Health
Organization
call
Covid
-
19
a
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
.
the
state
of
California
have
declare
a
state
of
emergency
to
activate
the
necessary
power
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
all
around
Europe
,
government
be
take
the
necessary
action
.
we
in
this
house
be
in
a
special
position
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
we
official
and
public
servant
be
do
everything
they
can
to
address
the
situation
but
we
do
not
have
a
proper
government
in
power
.
it
be
incumbent
on
all
of
we
in
the
Dáil
to
fill
the
democratic
deficit
until
a
new
government
be
form
.
there
be
a
great
many
worker
who
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
survive
on
statutory
illness
benefit
of
€
203
per
week
.
many
worker
will
have
no
contractual
entitlement
to
anything
beyond
this
,
but
they
will
have
the
same
requirement
to
pay
rent
,
pay
bill
and
heat
they
home
.
they
may
have
additional
cost
associate
with
gp
fee
or
the
cost
of
medicine
.
this
be
the
reality
for
low
-
pay
worker
,
and
one
in
four
worker
in
this
country
be
classify
in
this
category
,
as
the
OECD
have
confirm
.
we
have
to
take
action
to
help
this
worker
take
the
right
action
to
stop
the
spread
of
the
virus
,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
be
possible
to
do
so
,
we
have
to
avoid
low
-
pay
worker
be
make
materially
bad
off
for
do
the
right
thing
.
doctor
,
nurse
and
other
hospital
staff
be
also
likely
to
be
affect
by
the
need
for
self
-
isolation
as
a
result
of
Covid
-
19
.
we
could
very
quickly
find
ourselves
in
a
situation
where
we
do
not
have
enough
medical
staff
to
operate
we
hospital
or
primary
care
centre
.
this
be
on
top
of
the
problem
in
we
health
service
where
the
government
rely
far
too
heavily
on
temporary
agency
staff
and
have
a
effective
staffing
embargo
that
have
stop
people
gain
permanent
role
.
this
be
why
we
need
a
committee
of
the
dáil
put
in
place
to
make
executive
decision
collectively
.
this
be
what
the
emergency
require
.
it
be
frankly
disappointing
,
to
say
the
least
,
that
some
member
be
propose
briefing
along
the
line
of
the
Brexit
briefing
,
as
if
we
have
a
normal
government
with
democratic
legitimacy
.
it
be
also
disappointing
that
some
member
be
propose
dedicate
time
at
the
Dáil
's
next
sitting
to
make
statement
on
various
issue
rather
than
demand
that
we
deal
with
the
emergency
face
we
society
where
we
,
as
the
people
's
representative
,
be
the
democratically
elect
decision
-
maker
.
we
cannot
afford
this
kind
of
complacency
and
I
hope
that
all
of
we
as
member
will
reflect
as
the
Covid
-
19
situation
evolve
and
become
more
prepared
to
insist
on
the
Dáil
's
prerogative
to
be
central
to
democratic
decision
-
make
about
how
we
respond
to
this
emergency
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
take
this
statement
and
listen
to
the
concern
of
member
.
I
acknowledge
the
effort
of
we
public
servant
,
particularly
the
medical
staff
encounter
the
spread
of
Covid
-
19
throughout
the
country
.
it
have
not
,
thankfully
,
yet
be
widespread
but
in
monitor
what
have
happen
in
other
jurisdiction
,
we
may
be
at
the
beginning
of
something
in
this
country
.
I
hope
I
be
wrong
on
that
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
effort
of
other
across
the
country
,
in
particular
the
Garda
,
teacher
,
transport
worker
,
front
-
line
service
worker
and
worker
in
shop
,
hotel
and
other
service
industry
for
they
co-operation
and
assistance
during
this
period
.
as
mention
early
by
we
spokesperson
on
health
,
deputy
Stephen
Donnelly
,
general
communication
have
be
good
.
I
call
,
however
,
for
more
of
a
open
approach
,
particularly
regard
the
identification
of
certain
area
.
I
do
not
refer
to
individual
because
we
need
to
protect
individual
identity
.
we
need
people
to
self
-
identify
and
we
do
not
want
to
put
that
in
jeopardy
but
we
need
to
trust
the
public
.
Public
health
must
be
we
main
concern
in
all
of
this
,
and
it
should
be
we
top
priority
at
all
cost
.
the
HPSC
have
identify
nine
case
so
far
but
that
could
be
ten
from
what
we
be
hear
this
evening
.
I
express
my
solidarity
to
that
family
and
individual
concerned
because
it
be
worry
for
they
and
they
community
.
the
public
expect
a
plan
to
deal
with
community
transmission
when
that
happen
.
that
need
to
be
forthcoming
.
unfortunately
,
I
find
the
minister
's
statement
early
a
little
light
on
detail
.
I
know
this
be
a
unfolding
issue
for
he
and
he
official
,
but
we
need
to
reassure
the
public
with
more
detail
of
the
government
's
future
plan
regard
the
coronavirus
.
in
China
,
80
%
of
the
case
be
mild
,
15
%
need
treatment
in
hospital
while
5
%
require
intensive
care
treatment
.
on
that
basis
,
the
minister
's
early
announcement
of
just
20
intensive
care
bed
be
entirely
insufficient
,
and
I
fear
it
may
feed
public
concern
.
I
also
welcome
the
establishment
of
the
cabinet
sub
-committee
to
co-ordinate
we
national
response
.
the
government
must
show
leadership
on
this
issue
.
constitutionally
,
the
appropriate
body
to
exercise
such
power
be
the
government
,
not
a
ad
hoc
committee
of
the
House
.
I
welcome
the
guideline
put
before
the
House
early
.
the
regulation
to
prevent
the
stockpiling
of
sanitise
or
medical
product
should
be

we
heart
go
out
to
all
that
who
have
lose
love
one
and
friend
throughout
this
pandemic
.
it
be
important
that
we
not
become
desensitise
by
the
sheer
scale
of
death
that
we
have
witness
in
society
.
I
will
focus
on
long
-
term
residential
facility
such
as
nursing
home
.
we
be
very
fortunate
that
we
live
in
a
society
where
care
for
the
elderly
be
still
characterise
by
compassion
and
humanity
,
and
so
we
express
we
deep
gratitude
to
front
-
line
worker
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
they
do
hourly
,
daily
and
weekly
.
today
,
I
want
to
speak
for
that
people
who
live
in
nursing
or
care
home
.
I
applaud
the
minister
's
handling
of
the
crisis
but
there
be
some
question
we
feel
need
to
be
answer
.
today
,
RTÉ
report
that
accord
to
NPHET
there
be
1,9444
laboratory
-
confirm
case
of
the
virus
in
nursing
home
.
accord
to
that
report
,
this
be
61
%
high
than
the
number
of
nursing
home
infection
reveal
by
NPHET
on
Monday
.
this
represent
a
increase
of
740
case
in
two
day
.
the
number
of
nursing
home
death
be
absolutely
frightening
and
a
increase
of
740
in
two
day
be
astronomical
.
what
we
need
be
clarity
,
transparency
and
a
clear
communication
policy
on
what
be
happen
in
nursing
home
.
we
need
to
know
who
exactly
be
in
charge
of
manage
the
crisis
in
nursing
home
at
present
.
be
it
the
minister
,
the
HSE
,
NPHET
or
the
Chief
Medical
Officer
?
where
exactly
do
the
buck
stop
?
what
we
need
to
see
be
a
clearly
communicate
plan
that
would
give
certainty
to
resident
,
family
and
worker
in
the
sector
.
why
be
the
number
of
case
of
Covid
-
19
in
long
-
term
care
facility
increase
this
far
into
the
crisis
?
will
the
minister
please
describe
the
relationship
between
stakeholder
operate
in
the
State
health
sector
,
namely
,
the
aforementioned
Chief
Medical
Officer
,
NPHET
,
the
HSE
and
the
minister
,
and
the
owner
of
private
nursing
home
and
they
representative
body
?
I
hope
the
minister
will
disabuse
I
of
this
notion
or
perception
I
have
that
at
present
,
there
be
friction
between
how
the
State
sector
be
manage
the
crisis
and
how
Nursing
Home
Ireland
be
manage
its
affair
.
I
perceive
some
friction
in
the
relationship
and
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
now
be
the
time
to
ensure
the
safety
of
old
people
who
be
resident
of
nursing
home
.
now
be
the
time
to
ensure
family
know
who
be
in
charge
of
manage
this
element
of
the
crisis
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
family
of
that
in
nursing
home
to
have
sight
of
record
relate
to
the
day
-
to
-
day
management
of
the
crisis
as
it
relate
to
they
love
one
.
the
very
notion
that
in
certain
circumstance
in
this
society
,
but
for
the
compassion
of
individual
nursing
and
care
home
staff
,
relative
would
not
have
access
to
information
on
how
they
love
one
die
be
just
not
sustainable
.
I
would
like
to
know
exactly
what
be
the
status
today
in
real
time
of
the
national
and
regional
Covid
-
19
infection
control
team
announce
on
4
April
.
how
long
will
they
remain
in
situ
?
how
many
cluster
exist
today
in
nursing
home
?
what
be
the
real
-
time
figure
?
accord
to
the
RTÉ
report
today
,
102
people
in
nursing
home
be
presume
to
have
die
from
the
virus
.
how
do
the
minister
respond
to
this
?
what
relative
who
do
not
have
access
to
information
about
how
they
love
one
die
want
be
clear
communication
.
they
want
to
ensure
they
know
exactly
the
manner
in
which
they
love
one
pass
away
and
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
that
clarity
be
still
not
there
and
they
feel
they
be
not
be
properly
communicate
with
.
I
know
the
minister
be
do
he
good
but
he
might
give
we
some
clarity
about
how
he
intend
to
manage
that
.
in
respect
of
the
18000
test
that
have
be
carry
out
in
long
-
term
residential
facility
,
will
the
minister
tell
we
how
many
more
have
yet
to
be
do
?
be
there
a
sunset
for
that
process
in
term
of
complete
the
testing
regime
?
I
want
to
deal
with
two
further
issue
.
first
,
I
be
hear
from
primary
care
facility
that
they
be
still
in
need
of
ppe
and
they
be
very
concerned
about
the
shortage
.
in
one
instance
involve
a
large
community
primary
care
facility
,
I
be
tell
they
have
a
week
's
supply
in
store
.
second
,
although
this
be
not
directly
within
the
minister
's
brief
,
I
know
he
will
look
through
the
health
prism
at
the
resumption
of
childcare
for
work
people
,
not
only
for
that
who
be
front
-
line
worker
but
across
society
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
appreciate
that
where
two
people
within
a
family
be
work
while
also
try
to
manage
childcare
,
it
give
rise
to
domestic
challenge
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
whether
the
government
plan
to
roll
out
a
childcare
scheme
that
could
see
more
worker
outside
certain
sector
filter
back
into
the
workplace
,
or
at
least
free
up
time
for
people
who
be
work
within
the
home
at
present
by
enable
they
to
send
the
kid
to
crèche
or
a
childminder
at
least
to
alleviate
some
of
the
pressure
happen
on
the
domestic
front
at
present
?
that
conclude
statement
and
question
and
answer
on
Covid
-
19
.
the
Acting
Chairman
be
very
kind
.
I
propose
to
make
a
short
opening
statement
and
then
have
a
rapid
-
fire
round
with
the
minister
.
I
,
too
,
welcome
the
competence
of
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
vital
role
the
Department
play
in
Irish
society
.
I
know
there
be
member
present
in
the
House
who
be
part
of
a
tentative
government
who
would
be
very
sensitive
to
the
need
of
child
and
ensure
that
we
,
as
a
society
,
recognise
the
role
of
child
and
the
importance
of
maintain
a
minister
at
cabinet
level
.
that
be
vital
.
I
thank
the
minister
sincerely
for
she
work
to
date
.
I
say
without
any
plámás
that
she
have
be
one
of
the
most
progressive
minister
that
we
have
have
in
respect
of
she
role
.
I
genuinely
wish
she
well
for
the
future
and
thank
she
and
she
official
for
the
progressive
role
they
have
play
in
term
of
protect
and
progress
the
rights
of
child
in
society
.
I
thank
she
for
be
here
today
.
I
want
to
outline
in
brief
term
that
there
be
a
element
to
this
crisis
that
have
not
receive
the
attention
it
deserve
.
for
work
mother
,
the
burden
of
childcare
continue
to
fall
predominantly
on
they
during
this
time
.
as
progressive
as
we
like
to
believe
we
be
as
a
society
,
the
demand
that
have
fall
on
work
mother
in
the
absence
of
a
proper
childcare
structure
mean
that
woman
be
effectively
be
hold
back
because
they
be
again
assume
traditional
household
role
for
the
most
part
.
that
be
the
sad
reality
of
the
situation
.
as
a
parent
of
two
young
child
,
as
progressive
and
all
as
I
like
to
think
I
be
,
I
know
the
reality
be
that
work
mother
still
assume
the
vast
bulk
of
the
role
of
maintain
and
manage
a
household
.
it
be
have
a
impact
on
they
career
progression
as
we
speak
.
that
be
why
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
restore
the
childcare
system
and
have
a
pathway
or
roadmap
which
ensure
all
worker
have
access
to
the
service
in
the
short
period
of
time
possible
.
it
be
vital
that
we
step
up
the
energy
level
that
be
require
to
achieve
that
.
I
wish
to
make
a
point
regard
the
wage
subsidy
scheme
as
it
relate
to
woman
who
be
return
from
maternity
leave
.
the
minister
may
not
be
able
to
answer
it
as
she
be
probably
not
the
line
minister
for
the
issue
.
it
be
vitally
important
that
the
legislation
be
amend
,
as
articulate
by
SIPTU
,
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
,
the
National
woman
's
Council
of
Ireland
and
Member
in
this
House
today
,
so
that
that
return
from
maternity
leave
be
eligible
to
apply
for
the
wage
subsidy
scheme
.
the
Labour
Party
lend
its
voice
to
that
call
.
if
we
be
to
talk
about
equality
and
the
progression
of
woman
in
society
,
we
must
ensure
this
anomaly
be
correct
by
way
of
legislation
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
give
we
some
clarity
today
regard
the
roadmap
.
my
question
in
regard
to
it
be
very
simple
.
the
first
be
specific
and
relate
to
the
€
15
per
hour
the
minister
say
will
be
pay
to
worker
to
go
into
the
home
of
healthcare
staff
.
have
there
be
a
assessment
in
real
time
of
demand
for
that
service
?
do
we
know
how
many
healthcare
worker
be
actively
look
for
this
provision
?
second
,
what
be
the
anticipate
supply
of
worker
?
third
,
where
be
the
incentive
for
somebody
who
be
currently
avail
of
the
wage
subsidy
scheme
or
Covid
-
19
payment
as
a
employee
to
move
off
that
payment
and
into
work
in
the
home
of
a
healthcare
worker
?
fourth
,
what
protocol
will
be
design
around
ensure
the
safety
of
the
worker
go
into
the
home
?
we
recognise
the
need
of
healthcare
worker
but
we
must
also
ensure
that
where
a
childcare
or
early
year
worker
decide
to
volunteer
,
he
or
she
can
feel
safe
go
into
a
particular
house
.
will
there
be
Garda
vetting
of
member
of
the
household
to
protect
the
volunteer
who
be
go
in
?
will
that
be
a
requirement
of
the
scheme
?
what
be
the
insurance
permutation
for
the
household
into
which
a
worker
be
come
?
that
be
my
open
question
.
I
hope
I
will
be
able
to
come
in
with
a
second
round
of
question
.
my
closing
question
relate
to
who
the
eligible
healthcare
worker
be
and
the
point
make
by
deputy
Anne
Rabbitte
,
which
be
a
vital
one
,
regard
the
phasing
in
of
this
measure
in
July
.
the
minister
say
,
for
example
,
it
will
be
one
day
per
week
but
that
throw
up
major
issue
which
I
think
we
need
answer
to
now
in
this
House
.
there
need
to
be
detailed
answer
to
that
type
of
question
because
I
can
foresee
family
contact
I
say
that
they
be
be
tell
they
cannot
avail
of
the
service
on
Monday
when
they
need
it
on
Monday
or
on
Tuesday
when
they
need
it
on
Tuesday
.
this
be
go
to
have
a
massive
impact
.
it
will
put
massive
pressure
on
the
provider
in
a
way
that
will
probably
force
they
into
a
lottery
system
,
which
again
will
have
negative
impact
for
family
.
this
be
the
issue
that
need
to
be
tease
out
in
this
forum
,
now
I
would
argue
.
I
share
the
deputy
's
frustration
at
the
situation
around
the
provision
of
childcare
for
essential
or
healthcare
worker
.
I
speak
about
that
.
we
certainly
be
encourage
it
as
much
as
we
could
along
the
way
.
I
understand
that
the
mother
and
baby
home
commission
be
still
on
schedule
to
submit
its
report
in
June
.
I
have
be
in
communication
with
the
commission
and
hope
to
meet
the
membership
in
some
way
before
I
finish
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
she
extraordinary
advocacy
on
this
.

I
propose
to
make
a
few
point
and
to
ask
a
few
question
.
if
the
minister
can
answer
they
in
the
time
allocate
,
I
would
be
grateful
.
if
not
,
I
would
be
happy
to
receive
a
write
reply
.
I
wish
to
raise
four
issue
:
the
status
of
undocumented
worker
,
the
enforcement
of
regulation
by
a
Garda
Síochána
,
direct
provision
and
the
status
of
the
Garda
task
force
.
regard
undocumented
worker
,
the
minister
will
be
in
receipt
of
a
letter
issue
by
the
ceo
of
the
civil
society
organisation
call
for
the
regularisation
of
undocumented
child
,
young
people
and
worker
.
I
will
quote
from
a
letter
I
receive
,
and
which
the
minister
himself
will
have
receive
.
it
state
:
undocumented
worker
have
step
up
and
continue
to
work
provide
essential
service
in
this
crisis
.
they
be
work
in
sector
where
Ireland
need
worker
right
now
-
in
elder
care
,
healthcare
,
retail
,
cleaning
,
food
processing
,
agriculture
and
fishing
.
there
be
broad
base
support
for
the
regularisation
of
undocumented
people
-
from
the
public
,
business
,
civil
society
,
and
across
all
major
political
party
in
Ireland
.
could
the
minister
confirm
whether
the
government
will
commit
to
regularise
the
legal
status
of
that
undocumented
person
currently
carry
out
essential
front
-
line
service
,
as
care
worker
in
particular
?
the
second
issue
concern
the
operational
status
of
a
Garda
Síochána
.
I
acknowledge
the
reference
the
minister
make
in
he
statement
to
the
Policing
Authority
report
,
but
it
be
worth
quote
from
the
report
,
which
state
:
in
the
previous
set
of
figure
release
by
a
Garda
Síochána
,
for
the
period
8
to
25
April
,
there
be
760
such
incident
.
this
mean
a
additional
412
incident
have
be
record
or
confirm
in
the
past
week
(
a
54
%
increase
)
.
it
be
note
that
some
of
this
incident
may
have
occur
prior
to
the
26th
April
but
be
not
include
in
previous
total
due
to
not
be
validate
the
report
set
out
the
issue
in
respect
of
the
policing
of
Covid
.
it
further
state
:
approximately
22
%
of
the
offence
relate
to
public
order
,
while
a
further
16
%
relate
to
simple
drug
possession
.
General
road
offence
be
the
third
most
frequent
offence
classification
,
accounting
for
approximately
10
%
.
however
,
when
all
type
of
road
offence
be
combine
,
they
account
for
almost
32
%
.
in
tandem
with
that
,
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
submit
a
detailed
letter
to
the
Garda
Commissioner
set
out
issue
and
query
regard
the
implementation
by
the
Garda
of
the
regulation
introduce
on
7
April
.
that
regulation
amend
the
1947
regulation
.
the
1947
regulation
,
for
instance
,
have
power
of
enforcement
that
can
be
invoke
that
include
the
power
of
entry
onto
private
premise
where
the
regulation
be
be
breach
.
for
instance
,
the
hold
of
a
party
on
a
private
property
be
a
offence
under
the
regulation
on
the
part
of
the
guest
because
they
have
leave
they
home
without
a
reasonable
excuse
,
and
on
the
part
of
the
host
because
he
or
she
be
host
the
unauthorised
event
.
be
the
minister
satisfied
that
the
statistic
put
forward
by
the
Garda
Commissioner
show
there
be
a
low
level
of
use
of
that
enforcement
power
and
that
there
be
a
need
then
to
ensure
that
we
return
to
normal
policing
as
quickly
as
possible
?
inherent
within
that
,
as
we
move
to
the
next
phase
on
18
May
,
in
term
of
the
normalisation
of
society
,
as
it
be
,
and
as
we
move
through
the
phase
beyond
that
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
regulation
in
the
1947
Act
.
be
it
the
minister
's
intention
to
relax
or
lift
that
regulation
or
what
do
he
propose
to
do
in
respect
of
they
?
we
be
fast
approach
18
May
but
at
this
point
,
we
do
not
have
sight
of
he
intention
in
respect
of
the
power
of
the
Garda
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
to
have
some
perspective
from
he
.
similar
to
other
deputy
,
I
also
seek
assurance
from
the
minister
that
the
Garda
have
access
to
the
requisite
ppe
now
and
will
have
as
we
move
through
that
phase
.
far
,
have
consideration
be
give
by
the
government
or
by
he
to
priority
testing
and
result
for
a
Garda
Síochána
in
respect
of
Covid
-
19
?
my
third
point
relate
to
direct
provision
.
I
share
the
concern
of
other
deputy
with
regard
to
Cahersiveen
.
it
be
important
that
the
minister
speak
to
the
Cahersiveen
issue
specifically
.
it
would
be
worthwhile
.
the
minister
make
no
specific
reference
to
it
in
he
speech
but
I
would
like
to
hear
from
he
in
that
respect
.
in
he
speech
,
the
minister
say
that
7700
people
be
be
support
under
direct
provision
at
present
.
on
social
and
physical
distancing
support
and
cocooning
measure
,
he
say
"
more
than
600
resident
have
relocate
to
support
social
and
physical
distancing
and
cocooning
measure
in
centre
.
"
there
be
7700
people
in
direct
provision
and
,
accord
to
the
minister
's
speech
,
600
people
have
be
move
into
safe
accommodation
.
will
the
minister
give
we
he
perspective
on
the
next
phase
?
how
far
along
be
the
minister
and
he
Department
with
regard
to
ensure
the
safety
of
that
who
reside
in
direct
provision
centre
?
will
a
Garda
task
force
be
set
up
for
County
Louth
and
for
Drogheda
in
particular
?
point
regard
policing
in
this
specific
region
have
be
raise
by
other
speaker
.
follow
on
from
that
,
what
be
the
status
of
the
Garda
task
force
for
Dublin
's
north
inner
city
?
if
I
have
time
to
come
back
in
,
I
would
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
,
but
I
doubt
I
will
.
we
will
update
it
.
I
will
start
with
the
quality
of
life
issue
face
work
parent
,
particularly
work
mother
,
for
whom
childcare
have
become
a
crucial
issue
.
we
have
the
first
research
finding
from
the
Central
Statistics
Office
,
CSO
,
on
the
adverse
effect
it
be
have
on
work
woman
in
particular
.
the
CSO
press
statement
on
the
employment
and
life
effect
of
COVID
-
19
survey
publish
on
13
May
state
:
it
find
that
more
woman
...
than
man
...
be
care
for
a
dependent
family
member
or
friend
because
of
the
COVID
-
19
crisis
.
it
also
find
that
woman
be
more
likely
to
report
childcare
issue
related
to
the
COVID
-
19
crisis
...
and
woman
be
find
it
more
difficult
to
work
from
home
because
of
family
be
around
.
we
now
have
a
evidence
base
to
show
this
pandemic
be
have
a
adverse
effect
on
work
woman
in
particular
.
I
say
this
the
last
time
I
stand
in
the
Chamber
to
speak
to
the
minister
and
I
be
say
it
again
today
.
in
the
intervene
period
,
a
milestone
be
miss
.
we
have
much
expectation
about
this
milestone
be
reach
but
it
be
miss
.
it
be
pertinent
for
we
to
ask
why
it
have
be
miss
.
if
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
scepticism
about
the
next
milestone
be
reach
,
that
would
be
understandable
by
any
objective
analysis
.
I
seek
a
cast
-
iron
guarantee
from
the
government
and
the
minister
that
the
next
phase
of
this
scheme
will
proceed
on
29
June
.
if
the
minister
can
give
we
that
guarantee
,
will
she
also
indicate
,
give
that
phase
1
for
essential
worker
be
miss
,
whether
there
be
plan
to
put
in
place
a
revise
scheme
for
the
period
until
29
June
?
be
work
ongoing
to
devise
a
scheme
for
that
who
be
miss
in
phase
1
?
that
be
the
first
question
.
I
will
take
the
answer
now
,
if
I
may
,
please
.
I
have
ten
minute
and
many
question
.
with
all
due
respect
,
I
make
a
general
point
-----
I
ask
one
very
specific
question
.
yes
,
please
.
my
next
question
relate
to
the
Federation
of
early
Childhood
Provider
.
will
the
minister
intervene
directly
to
ensure
that
the
federation
,
which
I
understand
represent
1400
provider
,
will
be
include
in
the
advisory
group
?
the
minister
refer
to
the
Norwegian
model
in
connection
with
the
next
phase
of
open
up
.
there
be
no
reference
in
she
speech
to
floor
space
.
this
will
be
crucial
to
the
operation
of
any
model
because
it
will
have
a
impact
on
the
number
of
child
who
can
be
cater
for
at
any
give
time
.
regard
full
-
time
provision
for
child
between
zero
and
six
year
,
I
understand
the
floor
space
be
anywhere
from
3.5
sq.
m
per
child
to
2.3
sq
marry
per
child
.
under
the
Danish
model
,
on
which
I
have
information
,
the
area
be
anywhere
from
4
sq.
m
to
6
sq.
m
.
the
regulation
associate
with
the
Norwegian
model
state
:
"
the
indicative
norm
for
indoor
play
area
be
4
m
²
per
child
over
3
year
old
and
approximately
0.33
m²
for
a
child
under
three
.
"
I
want
to
tease
out
with
the
minister
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
other
speaker
in
respect
of
the
capacity
of
provider
to
provide
highly
regulate
early
year
childcare
in
the
new
paradigm
we
be
face
in
a
way
that
ensure
every
child
get
a
chance
and
that
none
be
leave
behind
,
and
that
there
be
no
lottery
system
for
child
and
they
parent
in
regard
to
provision
.
if
necessary
,
will
a
increase
in
capacity
be
seek
beyond
the
provider
,
or
will
the
provider
be
allow
to
rent
or
be
subsidise
for
seek
extra
space
?
what
be
the
internal
advice
to
the
minister
from
she
official
on
the
permutation
for
the
provision
of
space
and
the
regulation
at
present
?
my
final
intervention
relate
to
insurance
.
I
seek
a
clarification
from
the
minister
on
the
statement
I
understand
she
make
to
the
effect
that
Allianz
be
provide
95
%
of
the
insurance
cover
in
this
area
at
present
and
that
Covid
-
19
,
or
the
risk
of
it
,
do
not
arise
.
I
may
have
misinterpret
what
she
say
.
I
just
want
further
clarity
as
to
who
exactly
she
or
she
official
be
talk
.
be
it
a
umbrella
body
or
be
she
talk
to
specific
insurance
provider
.
if
it
be
the
latter
,
to
which
provider
be
she
talk
?
what
be
the
nature
of
that
conversation
?
be
Allianz
set
precondition
or
lay
down
any
benchmark
which
the
Department
must
reach
before
it
can
be
satisfied
that
it
can
provide
cover
to
the
provider
in
any
new
scheme
?

I
wish
to
raise
a
number
of
issue
with
the
minister
.
I
will
ask
a
question
,
receive
the
answer
and
then
follow
up
with
subsequent
question
.
the
first
issue
be
the
fact
that
as
public
representative
people
be
come
to
we
who
be
concerned
about
the
wage
subsidy
scheme
and
its
impact
on
they
as
employee
in
respect
of
they
pension
entitlement
down
the
line
.
I
would
like
the
minister
's
assurance
that
people
's
statutory
pension
entitlement
will
not
be
affect
by
the
fact
that
they
be
be
pay
under
the
temporary
Covid
-
19
wage
subsidy
scheme
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
reply
.
perhaps
he
could
circulate
he
response
to
all
we
colleague
here
,
as
I
think
it
be
a
question
they
have
all
be
ask
.
there
be
another
similar
question
on
people
's
mind
.
will
a
tax
liability
arise
from
receipt
of
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
unemployment
payment
?
I
thank
the
minister
.
the
next
issue
I
wish
to
raise
concern
correspondence
I
have
receive
via
the
Irish
Cancer
Society
.
this
body
write
to
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
Regina
Doherty
,
with
whom
I
intend
to
raise
the
matter
directly
today
.
the
Irish
Cancer
Society
state
:
it
have
come
to
we
attention
that
a
number
of
cancer
patient
who
have
be
advise
to
cocoon
be
not
entitle
to
the
covid
-
19
enhance
illness
benefit
payment
of
€350
per
week
...
the
Irish
Cancer
Society
be
ask
[
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
]
,
in
consultation
with
you
colleague
minister
Harris
and
Donohoe
,
to
address
this
anomaly
by
amend
regulation
in
order
to
extend
the
COVID
-
19
enhance
illness
benefit
payment
to
that
unable
to
work
during
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
on
the
advice
of
the
government
and
/
or
a
medical
practitioner
.
to
be
fair
to
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
the
Irish
Cancer
Society
receive
a
quite
sympathetic
response
:
employee
who
cocoon
without
a
medical
certificate
may
approach
they
employer
in
relation
to
take
annual
or
other
pay
leave
-
this
be
at
the
discretion
of
the
employer
.
the
government
have
encourage
employer
to
support
worker
with
leave
request
.
the
core
point
here
be
this
.
I
be
not
look
for
exceptional
treatment
for
any
sector
in
society
.
however
,
some
people
who
be
undergo
cancer
treatment
at
the
moment
be
not
in
a
position
to
use
up
any
more
leave
or
to
go
back
to
work
even
though
work
be
available
for
they
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
have
regard
to
the
Irish
Cancer
Society
's
correspondence
with
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
and
at
least
bear
the
matter
in
mind
when
consider
the
possible
extension
of
the
temporary
Covid
-
19
wage
subsidy
scheme
and
the
Covid
-
19
enhance
illness
benefit
.
that
be
the
first
point
.
I
wish
to
make
another
very
brief
point
about
the
continuation
of
the
temporary
Covid
-
19
wage
subsidy
scheme
.
we
have
recently
hear
from
the
Irish
hotel
Federation
and
the
National
campaign
for
the
Art
,
as
well
as
a
organisation
call
the
Event
Production
Industry
Covid
-
19
working
group
,
which
consist
of
stakeholder
in
the
entertainment
sector
,
organiser
of
outdoor
concert
and
so
on
.
they
have
all
correspond
with
we
to
request
that
the
wage
subsidy
scheme
and
the
Covid
-
19
payment
be
extend
.
I
again
ask
the
minister
whether
he
will
give
consideration
to
that
.
they
be
the
sector
that
will
be
the
last
to
come
on
stream
.
the
EPIC
group
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
outdoor
concert
,
include
engineer
,
rigger
and
other
seasonal
worker
.
they
be
ask
that
they
concern
be
address
.
be
the
minister
in
receipt
of
correspondence
from
the
National
campaign
for
the
Art
in
respect
of
that
issue
?
we
have
probably
all
receive
they
in
recent
day
.

when
will
PDFORRA
be

?
what
exactly
be
the
state
or
nature
of
that
discussion
?
when
will
PDFORRA
be
able
to
affiliate
to
ICTU
?
I
want
a
reassurance
that
there
be
no
impediment
on
the
government
's
part
to
ensure
that
,
as
a
principle
,
PDFORRA
can
affiliate

.
on
pay
and
condition
,
the
Minister
of
State
speak
to
the
issue
of
engagement
with
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
regard
that
who
have
either
return
from
overseas
deployment
in
Lebanon
or
be
go
out
.
he
tell
we
that
there
be
full
engagement
with
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
that
he
hope
to
come
back
to
Member
on
the
various
issue
that
have
be
raise
as
soon
as
possible
.
the
late
UN
deployment
to
Lebanon
take
place
in
mid-November
2019
and
would
have
end
in
May
2020
.
as
I
understand
it
,
approximately
50
personnel
would
have
then
come
home
for
leave
.
they
have
a
entitlement
to
a
two
-
week
leave
arrangement
,
which
they
would
have
take
up
.
they
understandably
do
not
return
to
Lebanon
because
of
the
pandemic
we
be
in
the
midst
of
,
but
the
net
effect
of
that
50
-
odd
personnel
have
return
home
be
a
loss
of
income
.
they
have
effectively
lose
one
third
of
they
allowance
,
though
provision
would
have
be
make
for
that
allowance
anyway
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
a
assurance
to
that
who
return
home
on
leave
during
the
last
tour
of
duty
that
they
will
have
the
element
of
they
pay
they
lose
restore
?
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
,
because
he
be
aware
of
the
issue
and
be
sympathetic
to
the
plight
of
that
people
.
I
return
to
my
point
that
this
money
would
have
be
budget
for
anyway
and
through
no
fault
of
they
own
,
this
situation
have
result
in
a
serious
loss
of
income
for
this
people
.
we
know
the
consequence
of
that
loss
of
income
for
a
Defence
force
family
,
especially
in
term
of
keep
a
household
and
manage
bill
.
if
there
be
a
process
of
engagement
with
the
relevant
authority
,
I
ask
for
a
clear
and
sympathetic
view
for
that
cohort
of
defence
force
personnel
who
be
affect
by
a
set
of
circumstance
that
be
entirely
out
of
they
control
.
I
ask
that
that
issue
be
deal
with
.
like
other
deputy
,
I
wish
to
make
the
case
in
respect
of
that
who
be
now
go
into
quarantine
before
go
out
.
they
be
away
from
they
family
and
household
.
it
be
arguable
that
for
the
sake
of
equity
and
fairness
they
would
have
a
case
for
the
payment
of
allowance
while
they
be
in
quarantine
on
Irish
soil
.
I
add
my
voice
to
the
case
that
have
be
make
by
other
member
that
they
receive
appropriate
recompense
for
the
period
of
time
during
which
they
be
in
quarantine
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
.
the
Minister
of
State
may
not
be
able
to
respond
to
a
particular
issue
I
wish
to
raise
.
I
refer
to
the
current
status
of
the
Lynch
Camp
in
Kilworth
,
County
Cork
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
barrack
?
it
be
be
use
by
the
HSE
,
as
I
understand
it
,
but
there
be
anecdotal
evidence
of
family
be
ask
to
socially
isolate
there
.
can
the
minister
of
State
confirm
whether
that
be
the
case
?
he
may
not
be
able
to
answer
that
question
now
,
but
if
he
could
write
to
I
I
would
be
most
grateful
.
there
have
be
two
minister
who
have
come
in
here
and
have
use
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
for
a
bit
of
cover
.
I
be
not
sure
how
acceptable
it
be
.
I
believe
the
minister
be
a
very
fair
-
minded
person
.
by
any
objective
analysis
,
he
have
always
be
distributional
in
term
of
he
etho
and
of
funding
across
the
State
.
a
point
be
make
early
about
urban
renewal
.
there
need
to
be
new
thinking
around
tackle
the
level
of
degradation
of
building
,
particularly
in
urban
area
,
village
and
town
where
there
be
a
rural
hinterland
.
I
refer
to
area
in
which
building
have
be
leave
abandon
,
there
be
absentee
landlord
,
and
there
be
a
absolute
need
for
a
coherent
policy
around
incentivise
people
to
come
back
to
live
again
in
the
main
street
in
we
town
and
village
.
we
have
all
witness
the
level
of
degradation
of
certain
building
within
town
.
it
seem
we
be
powerless
to
intervene
with
a
local
authority
or
with
the
owner
of
this
building
to
place
a
onus
on
they
to
ensure
they
can
enhance
the
public
realm
to
which
the
minister
refer
.
to
be
fair
,
by
any
objective
analysis
,
the
town
and
village
renewal
scheme
have
prove
to
be
quite
successful
.
credit
be
due
there
.
the
point
deputy
Tully
be
make
be
around
that
level
of
degradation
of
certain
part
of
town
and
street
.
I
support
she
contention
.
I
also
share
the
concern
that
be
raise
by
Deputy
Michael
and
Aindrias
Moynihan
from
Cork
North
-
West
in
respect
of
the
5
kilometer
rule
.
in
urban
area
,
we
have
all
witness
people
congregate
,
young
people
in
particular
.
it
be
hard
to
blame
they
in
certain
respects
,
but
let
we
be
honest
that
the
social
distancing
rule
be
be
flout
.
it
be
self
-
evident
.
I
be
not
go
to
argue
against
a
bunch
of
young
people
if
they
want
to
get
together
.
there
be
rule
in
place
and
the
relevant
authority
to
enforce
they
be
a
Garda
Síochána
.
however
,
it
be
also
the
case
that
somebody
cannot
visit
somebody
else
in
a
rural
area
such
as
a
grandmother
or
grandfather
.
grandparent
be
not
able
to
see
they
grandchild
at
the
moment
by
dint
of
the
fact
that
they
live
more
than
5
kilometer
away
.
there
be
a
inequity
there
.
it
be
unfair
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
use
he
very
influential
and
strong
voice
at
cabinet
to
articulate
this
viewpoint
,
as
I
be
sure
he
have
.
it
be
have
a
effect
in
rural
community
in
particular
or
,
for
example
,
where
a
son
or
daughter
live
with
he
or
she
child
in
a
urban
area
but
want
to
travel
beyond
the
20
kilometer
to
visit
a
grandparent
.
perhaps
the
cabinet
could
take
a
look
at
that
again
.
I
also
wish
to
raise
the
scheme
for
mná
tí
in
Gaeltacht
area
.
I
know
it
be
not
the
minister
's
line
Department
but
I
be
sure
he
will
have
a
view
on
the
None
to
bhfoghlaimeoir
í
Gaeilge
,
which
provide
for
up
to
27000
student
.
it
be
a
per
diem
payment
for
the
bean
a
tí
for
student
who
be
learn
in
Irish
college
.
we
know
that
the
Irish
college
be
not
go
to
be
operational
this
summer
.
will
the
minister
give
we
a
sense
of
whether
the
government
have
give
any
consideration
to
provide
some
degree
of
compensation
to
the
mná
tí
who
host
this
student
every
year
and
who
will
have
lose
a
significant
amount
of
income
?
they
be
in
we
rural
community
and
Gaeltacht
area
.
we
know
there
be
a
massive
multiplier
effect
as
a
result
of
this
payment
to
mná
tí
in
they
local
community
.
have
the
minister
or
he
colleague
give
any
consideration
to
provide
some
sort
of
compensation
to
the

with
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
and
if
the
minister
be
amenable
,
I
would
like
to
ask
some
very
simple
question
and
have
a
engagement
with
the
minister
.
I
seek
clarity
on
the
7
%
target
be
speak
about
in
the
context
of
government
formation
.
we
know
that
the
climate
action
plan
have
set
out
target
of
3.5
%
.
my
question
be
very
simple
:
do
the
minister
envisage
that
the
target
set
out
in
the
climate
action
plan
can
be
increase
to
7
%
?
be
that
feasible
?
be
it
possible
?
be
consideration
be
give
to
it
?
the
minister
refer
to
the
2050
net
zero
target
.
the
more
immediate
target
be
the
2030
target
.
we
be
talk
about
go
from
60
million
tonne
to
33
million
tonne
,
approximately
.
the
question
then
in
term
of
policy
intervention
by
2030
be
how
we
achieve
that
target
.
for
instance
,
be
the
minister
's
state
policy
ambition
to
take
diesel
car
out
of
the
equation
by
2030
still
a
state
policy
intervention
?
be
it
still
on
the
card
?
furthermore
,
there
have
be
some
discussion
about
ring
-
fencing
the
carbon
budget
,
for
instance
,
or
ring
-
fencing
carbon
tax
.
person
be
ask
what
that
mean
in
real
term
for
citizen
.
do
it
mean
the
aforementioned
fee
-
and
-
dividend
model
,
which
be
do
the
round
in
public
discourse
at
the
moment
,
be
a
real
prospect
in
term
of
government
formation
?
will
there
be
ring
-
fencing
for
key
project
to
deliver
the
reduction
in
emission
that
be
so
badly
need
?
I
want
to
discuss
sectoral
issue
.
I
know
the
minister
be
not
the
line
minister
responsible
for
agriculture
but
he
will
have
a
view
on
agricultural
emission
.
the
Labour
Party
espouse
a
position
whereby
the
government
need
to
consult
the
stakeholder
in
agriculture
to
talk
about
agricultural
emission
.
everyone
recognise
that
there
have
to
be
a
reduction
in
agricultural
emission
but
how
we
get
there
remain
to
be
see
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
State
be
move
beyond
think
and
into
real
policy
intervention
.
we
will
all
be
aware
of
the
good
research
conduct
by
Teagasc
on
how
to
reduce
the
emission
.
I
be
keen
to
know
,
if
agriculture
be
see
as
a
emitter
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
,
where
the
thinking
be
at
present
in
respect
of
how
the
agriculture
sector
will
move
forward
in
play
its
part
in
reduce
that
emission
.
we
always
defer
to
the
academic
research
when
it
suit
we
.
anyway
,
the
minister
will
be
aware
of
a
recent
study
carry
out
by
ucc
through
the
SFI
Research
Centre
for
Energy
,
Climate
and
Marine
,
MaREI
,
which
be
a
renewable
energy
research
entity
.
the
centre
refer
to
how
drastic
reduction
would
need
to
be
make
.
in
one
instance
a
reduction
in
the
national
herd
be
cite
if
we
be
to
meet
the
7
%
target
.
I
do
not
believe
we
should
get
bog
down
in
over
-
simplify
we
discussion
around
what
the
reduction
look
like
in
term
of
a
requirement
to
reduce
the
national
herd
to
reach
output
of
x
.
this
be
why
we
need
to
have
some
sort
of
stakeholder
process
.
there
need
to
be
a
just
transition
for
agriculture
so
that
if
we
be
to
move
to
reduce
emission
properly
,
we
include
the
farming
and
agricultural
community
as
part
of
that
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
next
government
seek
to
set
a
target
of
7
%
,
there
will
be
a
lot
of
worried
people
in
rural
Ireland
.
if
one
of
the
policy
output
as
a
result
of
a
new
programme
for
government
be
a
drastic
reduction
in
the
national
herd
,
that
would
have
a
massive
impact
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
on
rural
community
.
person
need
to
transition
.
New
scheme
need
to
be
devise
and
new
financing
option
make
available
for
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
who
would
displace
one
form
of
activity
for
another
,
recognise
they
role
as
guardian
within
the
rural
economy
.
I
hope
that
we
do
not
use
very
sharp
implement
that
could
have
unintended
consequence
for
citizen
who
live
in
the
rural
economy
.
it
be
very
interesting
to
hear
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
who
may
be
a
prospective
Tánaiste
,
give
we
a
sense
of
he
vision
.
the
potentially
continue
or
next
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
be
also
here
to
listen
to
that
view
.
I
be
in
no
way
be
facetious
about
this
.
the
view
espouse
by
deputy
Ryan
,
possibly
soon
to
be
a
minister
,
be
a
vision
that
broadly
we
would
all
like
to
buy
into
.
it
be
a
picture
of
a
Ireland
that
exist
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
past
,
when
one
look
at
grassland
management
,
forestry
management
,
land
use
and
all
that
they
entail
.
we
be
,
however
,
in
a
scenario
where
agriculture
be
a
key
component
of
we
economy
.
we
have
a
particular
type
of
production
base
on
grassland
and
it
have
a
massive
benefit
to
the
economy
.
I
would
like
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
national
herd
.
in
the
context
of
climate
action
the
debate
around
agriculture
have
be
narrow
into
the
funnel
of
reduce
the
national
herd
.
there
have
be
a
oversimplification
of
that
argument
and
it
have
become
the
narrative
.
some
of
we
want
to
see
a
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
but
do
not
want
to
see
the
fabric
of
the
rural
economy
be
take
out
and
rip
to
shred
in
one
fall
swoop
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
can
understand
,
as
can
deputy
Ryan
,
that
there
be
farm
family
who
rely
on
beef
production
.
this
be
because
most
people
be
now
farming
to
scheme
.
a
unfortunate
outcome
of
the
way
we
have
manage
agriculture
over
the
decade
be
that
people
farm
to
scheme
and
be
incentivise
to
go
into
a
particular
scheme
because
that
be
from
where
they
derive
they
income
.
somewhere
within
that
discourse
there
have
to
be
a
discussion
about
how
we
incentivise
that
farmer
who
be
,
with
some
degree
of
justification
,
suspicious
or
sceptical
about
the
direction
of
travel
to
move
towards
scheme
such
as
agri-environment
scheme
and
TAMS
that
will
ensure
they
can
continue
to
manage
and
produce
livestock
in
a
way
that
be
sustainable
but
do
not
compromise
they
membership
of
a
community
.
in
rural
community
,
on
a
Friday
night
,
one
could
have
three
generation
of
a
farm
hold
or
household
sit
in
a
pub
talk
to
they
neighbour
about
what
happen
at
the
mart
.
we
cannot
tell
they
they
must
stop
beef
production
in
one
fall
swoop
.
we
have
to
manage
a
transition
towards
a
future
that
they
be
a
part
of
and
have
ownership
of
and
which
do
not
compromise
they
ability
to
produce
livestock
.
there
be
a
happy
medium
.
I
be
not
a
scientist
so
when
I
look
at
Teagasc
research
I
have
to
interpret
what
the
organisation
be
try
to
say
.
there
seem
to
be
something
in
its
research
which
,
through
a
pathway
of
proper
land
use
,
scheme
and
buy
-
in
,
allow
we
to
get
to
the
2030
target
.
however
,
certain
thing
have
to
happen
.
farmer
need
to
be
part
of
a
discussion
and
to
have
ownership
of
what
need
to
happen
if
we
be
to
reach
the
2030
target
.
there
be
a
disparity
between
the
3.5
%
climate
action
plan
target
and
the
6.5
%
or
7
%
target
that
have
be
bandy
around
as
part
of
discussion
on
a
programme
for
government
.
this
be
cause
a
great
deal
of
confusion
and
be
wrap
up
in
the
narrative
that
the
7
%
figure
equate
to
a
reduction
in
the
national
herd
.
I
do
not
think
that
will
happen
but
there
need
to
be
clarity
regardless
of
who
be
in
government
.
will
we
annual
emission
reduction
target
in
the
climate
action
plan
be
3.5
%
or
will
it
ramp
up
to
7
%
?
I
be
seek
the
minister
's
perspective
on
this
and
to
have
he
enlighten
we
.
if
the
annual
target
go
up
to
7
%
,
what
will
be
the
knock
-
on
effect
for
farmer
,
the
rural
economy
and
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
?
will
it
entail
,
as
it
must
in
my
view
,
the
setting
in
place
of
scheme
that
will
ensure
there
be
no
drastic
loss
of
income
and
give
the
individual
landowner
and
farmer
a
stake
in
what
that
future
look
like
?
broadly
,
the
question
I
have
for
the
minister
be
whether
we
will
see
a
increase
.
all
party
here
,
ironically
enough
,
have
buy
into
the
7
%
target
,
because
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
agree
to
that
.
it
be
interesting
to
hear
from
we
friend
in
Fianna
Fáil
,
who
be
in
opposition
now
but
might
soon
be
sit
at
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
use
opposition
rhetoric
.
I
do
not
speak
in
a
pejorative
way
about
target
and
about
the
reduction
of
the
national
herd
but
they
need
to
be
honest
about
the
fact
they
sign
up
for
this
very
target
.
we
need
to
have
honesty
in
this
debate
around
climate
action
,
because
it
be
a
non-partisan
and
apolitical
space
and
we
need
to
work
together
on
it
.
I
will
be
interested
in
hear
the
minister
's
perspective
on
how
we
get
from
a
target
of
3.5
%
to
6.5
%
,
as
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
indicate
-
or
be
it
7
%
or
6
%
or
whatever
you
be
have
yourself
-
because
that
will
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
for
agriculture
before
talk
about
Shannon
,
which
be
the
primary
issue
that
I
wish
to
discuss
tonight
,
I
join
with
deputy
Connolly
in
call
for
some
clarity
about
when
the
island
will
open
,
and
whether
they
will
open
for
family
member
,
which
be
most
important
,
for
people
who
have
a
holiday
home
there
,
and
for
tourism
.
they
be
all
important
but
to
different
degree
.
some
clarity
be
require
as
all
the
other
area
of
open
up
be
be
bring
forward
.
last
week
,
I
address
this
House
in
the
minister
's
presence
and
accuse
he
of
a
certain
Dublin
bias
,
or
at
least
of
have
concentrate
on
Dublin
during
he
tenure
as
minister
.
we
have
talk
a
lot
about
contagion
in
this
House
in
the
last
couple
of
week
and
the
danger
of
contagion
.
I
wonder
if
that
bias
be
particularly
contagious
,
give
the
minister
's
fleeting
visit
to
Bunratty
and
the
fact
that
we
now
have
the
Shannon
Heritage
group
.
it
have
decide
that
it
will
close
all
of
its
heritage
site
in
the
mid-west
,
which
it
be
suppose
to
serve
primarily
,
from
the
end
of
August
onwards
.
it
be
open
they
up
at
the
end
of
this
month
.
the
site
that
it
run
in
Dublin
will
remain
open
and
be
service
,
include
the
General
Post
Office
,
Malahide
Castle
and
garden
,
and
Newbridge
House
and
Farm
.
that
be
of
concern
to
I
.
if
this
essential
tourist
site
in
Dublin
be
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
,
why
be
they
not
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
in
the
mid-west
?
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
.
there
be
obviously
a
difference
in
ownership
structure
.
I
have
raise
this
issue
with
the
Shannon
Group
and
its
management
have
question
whether
it
be
appropriate
for
a
commercial
semi-State
body
to
pump
money
into
something
that
it
know
will
lose
money
,
the
Shannon
heritage
site
.
I
be
not
expect
that
the
minister
will
make
a
decision
in
the
time
leave
to
he
as
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
but
maybe
he
will
initiate
a
examination
of
it
,
if
it
be
not
appropriate
for
Shannon
Group
to
maintain
this
site
.
deputy
Cathal
Crowe
have
a
plastic
model
of
Bunratty
Castle
.
unfortunately
,
the
real
castle
be
make
of
brick
and
stone
and
be
a
ancient
building
which
be
expensive
to
maintain
.
it
be
a
protect
structure
,
as
it
should
be
,
and
any
work
which
be
to
be
carry
out
would
have
to
be
do
to
a
high
standard
and
would
be
expensive
because
of
the
nature
of
the
building
and
the
degree
of
specialisation
require
to
work
on
it
.
in
addition
,
because
it
be
a
building
that
receive
many
tourist
,
it
inevitably
require
significant
upkeep
every
year
.
the
same
be
true
of
Knappogue
Castle
,
Dunguaire
Castle
,
near
Kinvara
,
King
John
's
Castle
and
Craggaunowen
.
this
be
expensive
site
to
maintain
.
while
they
be
important
tourist
site
,
they
be
also
a
important
part
of
we
heritage
.
how
do
we
value
we
heritage
?
clearly
,
the
structure
that
be
be
put
in
place
for
the
visitor
's
centre
in
the
GPO
,
Malahide
Castle
and
Newbridge
House
mean
the
heritage
of
that
site
be
value
highly
because
Shannon
Heritage
will
continue
to
keep
they
open
whereas
the
heritage
of
the
site
in
the
mid-west
seem
to
be
of
less
value
,
and
I
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
that
.
even
if
it
be
the
case
that
somehow
one
be
more
important
than
another
because
of
a
ownership
structure
,
with
none
in
private
ownership
,
and
if
the
structure
need
to
be
maintain
to
ensure
investment
in
they
,
state
aid
rule
have
be
relaxed
.
Fáilte
Ireland
and
the
airport
group
be
to
invest
a
sizeable
sum
in
Bunratty
Castle
.
give
that
this
be
a
essential
heritage
site
,
perhaps
the
State
should
consider
invest
that
money
instead
because
the
Shannon
Group
be
not
in
a
good
place
.
last
but
by
no
means
least
,
I
would
like
to
mention
the
Aer
Lingus
worker
.
some
have
give
a
lifetime
to
Shannon
Airport
and
they
have
be
tell
that
from
Sunday
week
,
they
will
not
even
be
on
standby
in
the

I
have
long
hold
suspicion
about
Aer

attitude
to
the
airport
.
it
inform
my
attitude
to
the
sale
of
the
25
%
shareholding
a
number
of

.
however
,
it
have
be
confirm
by
Aer

management
that
the
staff
who
have
give
a
lifetime
of
work
to
Shannon
Airport
will
be
relegate
to
a
much
less
status
than
that
at
Cork
and
Dublin
Airport
.
it
be
not
fair
or
right
.
I
appreciate
that
Aer
Lingus
be
a
private
company
,
and
I
expect
that
will
be
the
minister
's
response
.
however
,
it
be
somehow
the
flag
carrier
for
Ireland
and
if
the
government
could
signal
its
opposition
to
that
move
,
it
might
carry
some
weight
.
I
urge
it
to
do
so
.
before
talk
about
Shannon
,
which
be
the
primary
issue
that
I
wish
to
discuss
tonight
,
I
join
with
deputy
Connolly
in
call
for
some
clarity
about
when
the
island
will
open
,
and
whether
they
will
open
for
family
member
,
which
be
most
important
,
for
people
who
have
a
holiday
home
there
,
and
for
tourism
.
they
be
all
important
but
to
different
degree
.
some
clarity
be
require
as
all
the
other
area
of
open
up
be
be
bring
forward
.
last
week
,
I
address
this
House
in
the
minister
's
presence
and
accuse
he
of
a
certain
Dublin
bias
,
or
at
least
of
have
concentrate
on
Dublin
during
he
tenure
as
minister
.
we
have
talk
a
lot
about
contagion
in
this
House
in
the
last
couple
of
week
and
the
danger
of
contagion
.
I
wonder
if
that
bias
be
particularly
contagious
,
give
the
minister
's
fleeting
visit
to
Bunratty
and
the
fact
that
we
now
have
the
Shannon
Heritage
group
.
it
have
decide
that
it
will
close
all
of
its
heritage
site
in
the
mid-west
,
which
it
be
suppose
to
serve
primarily
,
from
the
end
of
August
onwards
.
it
be
open
they
up
at
the
end
of
this
month
.
the
site
that
it
run
in
Dublin
will
remain
open
and
be
service
,
include
the
General
Post
Office
,
Malahide
Castle
and
garden
,
and
Newbridge
House
and
Farm
.
that
be
of
concern
to
I
.
if
this
essential
tourist
site
in
Dublin
be
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
,
why
be
they
not
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
in
the
mid-west
?
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
.
there
be
obviously
a
difference
in
ownership
structure
.
I
have
raise
this
issue
with
the
Shannon
Group
and
its
management
have
question
whether
it
be
appropriate
for
a
commercial
semi-State
body
to
pump
money
into
something
that
it
know
will
lose
money
,
the
Shannon
heritage
site
.
I
be
not
expect
that
the
minister
will
make
a
decision
in
the
time
leave
to
he
as
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
but
maybe
he
will
initiate
a
examination
of
it
,
if
it
be
not
appropriate
for
Shannon
Group
to
maintain
this
site
.
deputy
Cathal
Crowe
have
a
plastic
model
of
Bunratty
Castle
.
unfortunately
,
the
real
castle
be
make
of
brick

stone
and
be
a
ancient
building
which
be
expensive
to
maintain
.
it
be
a
protect
structure
,
as
it
should
be
,
and
any
work
which
be
to
be
carry
out
would
have
to
be
do
to
a
high
standard
and
would
be
expensive

of
the
nature
of
the

and
the
degree
of
specialisation
require
to
work
on
it

in

,
because
it
be
a

that
receive

tourist

it
inevitably
require

the

they

how
do
we
value
we

clearly
,
the

that
be
be
put
in
place
for
the
visitor
's
centre
in
the
GPO
,
Malahide
Castle
and
Newbridge

mean
the
heritage
of
that

be
value
highly
because
Shannon
Heritage
will
continue
to
keep
they
open
whereas
the
heritage
of
the
site
in
the
mid-west
seem
to
be
of
less
value
,
and
I
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
that
.
even
if
it
be
the
case
that
somehow
one
be
more
important

of

give
that

be
a
essential
heritage
site
,
perhaps
the
State
should
consider
invest
that
money
instead
because
the
Shannon
Group
be
not
in
a
good
place
.
last
but
by
no
means
least
,
I
would
like
to
mention
the
Aer
Lingus
worker
.
some
have
give
a
lifetime
to
Shannon
Airport
and
they
have
be
tell
that
from
Sunday
week
,
they
will
not
even
be
on
standby
in
the
event
that
Aer
Lingus
divert
a
plane
there
or
the
airport
start
open
up
.
other
company
will
be
call
on
to
carry
out
ground
crew
work
or
any
essential
work
that
be
require
.
I
have
long
hold
suspicion
about
Aer
Lingus
's
attitude
to
the
airport
.
it
inform
my
attitude
to
the
sale
of
the
25
%
shareholding
a
number
of
year
ago
.
however
,
it
have
be
confirm
by
Aer
Lingus
management
that
the
staff
who
have
give
a
lifetime
of
work
to
Shannon
Airport
will
be
relegate
to
a
much
less
status
than
that
at
Cork
and
Dublin
Airport
.
it
be
not
fair
or
right
.
I
appreciate
that
Aer
Lingus
be
a
private
company
,
and
I
expect
that
will
be
the
minister
's
response
.
however
,
it
be
somehow
the
flag
carrier
for
Ireland
and
if
the
government
could
signal
its
opposition
to
that
move
,
it
might
carry
some
weight
.
I
urge
it
to
do
so
.
before
talk
about
Shannon
,
which
be
the
primary
issue
that
I
wish
to
discuss
tonight
,
I
join
with
deputy
Connolly
in
call
for
some
clarity
about
when
the
island
will
open
,
and
whether
they
will
open
for
family
member
,
which
be
most
important
,
for
people
who
have
a
holiday
home
there
,
and
for
tourism
.
they
be
all
important
but
to
different
degree
.
some
clarity
be
require
as
all
the
other
area
of
open
up
be
be
bring
forward
.
last
week
,
I
address
this
House
in
the
minister
's
presence
and
accuse
he
of
a
certain
Dublin
bias
,
or
at
least
of
have
concentrate
on
Dublin
during
he
tenure
as
minister
.
we
have
talk
a
lot
about
contagion
in
this
House
in
the
last
couple
of
week
and
the
danger
of
contagion
.
I
wonder
if
that
bias
be
particularly
contagious
,
give
the
minister
's
fleeting
visit
to
Bunratty
and
the
fact
that
we
now
have
the
Shannon
Heritage
group
.
it
have
decide
that
it
will
close
all
of
its
heritage
site
in
the
mid-west
,
which
it
be
suppose
to
serve
primarily
,
from
the
end
of
August
onwards
.
it
be
open
they
up
at
the
end
of
this
month
.
the
site
that
it
run
in
Dublin
will
remain
open
and
be
service
,
include
the
General
Post
Office
,
Malahide
Castle
and
garden
,
and
Newbridge
House
and
Farm
.
that
be
of
concern
to
I
.
if
this
essential
tourist
site
in
Dublin
be
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
,
why
be
they
not
important
enough
to
be
keep
open
in
the
mid-west
?
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
.
there
be
obviously
a
difference
in
ownership
structure
.
I
have
raise
this
issue
with
the
Shannon
Group
and
its
management
have
question
whether
it
be
appropriate
for
a
commercial
semi-State
body
to
pump
money
into
something
that
it
know
will
lose
money
,
the
Shannon
heritage
site
.
I
be
not
expect
that
the
minister
will
make
a
decision
in
the
time
leave
to
he
as
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
but
maybe
he
will
initiate
a
examination
of
it
,
if
it
be
not
appropriate
for
Shannon
Group
to
maintain
this
site
.
deputy
Cathal
Crowe
have
a
plastic
model
of
Bunratty
Castle
.
unfortunately
,
the
real
castle
be
make
of
brick
and
stone
and
be
a
ancient
building
which
be
expensive
to
maintain
.
it
be
a
protect
structure
,
as
it
should
be
,
and
any
work
which
be
to
be
carry
out
would
have
to
be
do
to
a
high
standard
and
would
be
expensive
because
of
the
nature
of
the
building
and
the
degree
of
specialisation
require
to
work
on
it
.
in
addition
,
because
it
be
a
building
that
receive
many
tourist
,
it
inevitably
require
significant
upkeep
every
year
.
the
same
be
true
of
Knappogue
Castle
,
Dunguaire
Castle
,
near
Kinvara
,
King
John
's
Castle
and
Craggaunowen
.
this
be
expensive
site
to
maintain
.
while
they
be
important
tourist
site
,
they
be
also
a
important
part
of
we
heritage
.
how
do
we
value
we
heritage
?
clearly
,
the
structure
that
be
be
put
in
place
for
the
visitor
's
centre
in
the
GPO
,
Malahide
Castle
and
Newbridge
House
mean
the
heritage
of
that
site
be
value
highly
because
Shannon
Heritage
will
continue
to
keep
they
open
whereas
the
heritage
of
the
site
in
the
mid-west
seem
to
be
of
less
value
,
and
I
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
that
.
even
if
it
be
the
case
that
somehow
one
be
more
important
than
another
because
of
a
ownership
structure
,
with
none
in
private
ownership
,
and
if
the
structure
need
to
be
maintain
to
ensure
investment
in
they
,
state
aid
rule
have
be
relaxed
.
Fáilte
Ireland
and
the
airport
group
be
to
invest
a
sizeable
sum
in
Bunratty
Castle
.
give
that
this
be
a
essential
heritage
site
,
perhaps
the
State
should
consider
invest
that
money
instead
because
the
Shannon
Group
be
not
in

I
urge
it
to
do
so
.
I
rise
to
support
this
Labour
Party
motion
.
we
be
now
in
what
I
call
a
dark
age
in
term
of
public
housing
project
in
this
country
.
from
the
1930s
to
the
1950s
there
be
massive
state
intervention
in
respect
of
public
housing
build
in
this
country
.
this
be
do
because
there
be
a
will
to
do
it
.
at
the
heart
of
the
motion
before
we
be
the
supply
of
housing
as
the
ultimate
goal
and
,
in
the
interim
,
protection
for
renter
and
the
introduction
of
a
state
support
scheme
to
ensure
nobody
be
put
out
on
the
street
such
that
we
do
not
further
exacerbate
the
homelessness
crisis
that
we
have
see
in
this
country
to
date
.
we
need
a
enlightenment
period
in
regard
to
public
housing
construction
.
the
Labour
Party
will
support
any
measure
that
be
appropriate
in
that
regard
.
what
we
want
to
see
from
this
government
on
that
journey
be
real
intervention
and
not
only
rhetoric
.
while
we
all
have
partake
in
rhetoric
,
it
be
important
now
,
more
than
at
any
other
time
in
we
history
,
that
we
put
in
place
a
programme
of
public
housing
construction
such
that
we
can
alleviate
the
need
for
measure
such
as
income
support
for
that
who
be
rent
.
to
date
,
1300
people
within
this
state
be
await
rent
supplement
.
whether
we
like
it
or
not
that
rent
supplement
will
go
into
the
hand
of
private
landlord
.
the
model
we
have
build
up
in
this
country
be
perverted
and
we
need
to
deconstruct
it
.
this
motion
say
to
government
that
the
Labour
Party
will
work
it
but
what
we
need
to
see
in
return
be
the
put
in
place
of
proper
activation
measure
such
that
we
never
again
see
anybody
be
put
out
on
the
street
.
we
need
a
public
housing
programme
.
as
other
speaker
have
say
,
it
be
a
supply
and
demand
issue
.
we
need
a
public
housing
programme
to
ensure
that
we
meet
that
supply
and
demand
.
I
be
delighted
to
stand
in
this
Convention
Centre
to
support
this
motion
.
thus
far
,
I
have
serve
as
a
deputy
for
13
year
.
the
number
of
people
come
to
see
I
who
be
on
social
housing
list
be
ever
grow
.
it
be
utterly
depressing
that
in
this
modern
republic
we
cannot
build
house
for
people
.
we
will
hold
the
minister
to
he
word
.
we
will
give
he
a
fair
chance
and
a
fair
crack
of
the
whip
.
the
minister
say
early
that
he
want
local
authority
to
get
back
to
build
house
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
let
we
give
he
a
fair
crack
at
that
whip
.
I
contend
that
the
model
need
to
be
wide
.
the
local
authority
need
to
be
key
stakeholder
but
delivery
should
not
be
leave
to
only
they
.
there
be
a
loss
of
corporate
memory
in
regard
to
how
local
authority
build
house
.
local
authority
have
not
be
involve
in
house
building
for
a
long
time
.
we
need
to
develop
a
model
that
regardless
of
we
political
persuasion
we
can
buy
into
and
support
.
we
need
this
to
be
a
non-partisan
issue
and
a
issue
about
young
people
.
this
be
the
very
people
who
be
lose
hope
daily
that
they
will
never
own
,
occupy
or
have
fixity
of
tenure
in
a
house
so
that
they
can
support
themselves
and
they
family
.
the
time
for
a
radical
programme
be
now
.
even
in
the
midst
of
this
Covid
crisis
now
be
the
time
to
put
we
shoulder
to
the
wheel
.
I
be
conscious
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Madigan
,
be
in
the
Chamber
to
deal
with
the
topical
Issue
matter
tab
by
deputy
Ó
Snodaigh
,
but
he
be
not
present
and
,
as
such
,
we
will
not
deal
with
it
today
.
I
rise
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
to
support
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
.
we
welcome
this
unambiguous
motion
that
should
warrant
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
Member
of
this
House
.
I
reread
the
minister
's
speech
as
I
find
part
of
it
quite
difficult
to
understand
.
she
state
:
the
change
be
seek
be
complex
from
a
legal
perspective
.
it
be
not
as
simple
as
be
be
suggest
.
adopt
the
propose
measure
would
require
I
,
as
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
to
bring
forward
primary
legislation
to
amend
the
Maternity
Protection
Act
1994
to
2004
,
in
order
to
provide
that
woman
who
have
already
start
or
complete
they
maternity
period
would
be
entitle
to
take
a
further
13
week
's
leave
.
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
would
also
be
require
to
amend
the
social
Welfare
Consolidation
Act
2005
,
as
amend
,
to
provide
for
the
associate
payment
of
maternity
benefit
at
€
245
per
week
for
the
period
of
any
extension
.
the
minister
continue
:
what
be
propose
in
the
motion
would
require
legislation
to
have
a
retrospective
effect
.
Retrospective
legislation
,
as
the
House
will
be
aware
,
be
extremely
rare
and
can
raise
constitutional
issue
.
in
addition
,
there
may
be
legal
difficulty
in
identify
the
relevant
cohort
to
which
the
amendment
would
apply
.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
whom
I
wish
well
in
she
role
,
for
a
minister
to
come
into
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
and
give
as
a
excuse
for
not
deal
with
this
issue
the
line
that
it
would
be
too
complex
from
a
legal
perspective
be
condescending
and
patronising
to
that
of
we
who
represent
the
very
woman
who
have
give
we
the
testimonial
of
just
how
much
this
crisis
have
affect
they
.
if
we
have
as
a
bar
or
standard
that
all
legislation
would
have
to
be
simple
and
clear
before
we
could
proceed
,
we
would
never
get
anything
do
in
this
House
.
in
fact
,
we
would
never
have
introduce
the
extensive
legislation
in
respect
of
the
Covid
pandemic
,
which
give
rise
to
many
government
initiative
and
which
be
extremely
complex
.
the
minister
and
the
government
should
rethink
they
approach
to
this
issue
.
use
the
excuse
that
the
matter
be
complex
be
not
good
enough
for
the
woman
who
have
seek
change
to
the
legislation
and
who
voice
the
concern
we
have
hear
tonight
.
childcare
be
a
issue
we
have
be
raise
for
month
in
this
House
.
this
be
the
fourth
time
I
have
point
out
that
we
have
yet
to
come
up
with
a
solution
in
respect
of
childcare
in
this
country
.
to
be
frank
about
it
,
the
government
have
be
find
want
.
we
now
have
testimony
from
so
many
provider
and
parent
in
respect
of
they
inability
to
provide
childcare
facility
for
baby
under
the
age
of
one
year
.
we
be
now
see
the
evidence
of
a
regressivity
have
creep
in
as
a
result
of
Covid
-
19
in
respect
of
woman
's
rights
in
this
country
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
revisit
this
issue
from
a
policy
point
of
view
because
this
pandemic
have
have
a
massive
effect
on
woman
and
they
ability
to
progress
in
they
career
and
in
society
as
a
whole
.
that
effect
have
not
be
fully
measure
.
no
quantum
or
metric
have
be
fully
put
behind
it
.
there
be
some
nascent
research
from
the
Central
Statistics
Office
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
revisit
this
issue
on
behalf
of
that
woman
in
order
that
we
can
bring
forward
progressive
idea
on
how
woman
can
progress
in
they
job
and
in
society
.
there
be
no
Green
Party
minister
in
the
Chamber
,
although
there
may
be
one
here
late
on
in
the
evening
.
I
do
not
wish
to
attack
anybody
,
but
we
have
before
we
testimony
from
deputy
O'Gorman
,
who
be
now
a
minister
.
I
wish
he
well
in
he
Ministry
.
he
raise
this
issue
in
the
dáil
on
20
May
when
he
ask
whether
the
then
minister
have
consider
how
group
such
as
woman
return
from
maternity
leave
and
employee
return
from
sick
leave
have
be
impact
by
the
current
definition
of
specify
employee
under
the
temporary
wage
subsidy
scheme
.
he
ask
if
the
minister
have
consider
extend
the
statutory
period
of
maternity
leave
,
and
the
period
of
payment
of
maternity
benefit
,
to
provide
protection
for
woman
who
would
otherwise
be
return
to
work
during
the
Covid
-
19
crisis
.
the
current
minister
ask
in
a
parliamentary
question
on
3
June
,
just
last
month
,
if
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
-
at
the
time
it
be
deputy
Flanagan
-
would
consider
extend
maternity
leave
and
benefit
for
that
woman
move
into
the
unpaid
entitlement
phase
of
they
maternity
leave
during
the
Covid
-
19
crisis
,
and
if
he
would
make
a
statement
on
the
matter
.
there
be
a
very
clear
,
unambiguous
position
by
one
of
the
constituent
party
of
the
government
in
respect
of
deal
in
a
honest
and
forthright
way
with
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
thousand
of
woman
affect
.
the
government
's
response
tonight
have
fall
a
little
short
of
expectation
.
the
minister
cannot
come
to
the
House
and
speak
about
the
"
unexpected
additional
burden
to
we
key
sme
sector
"
,
have
presumably
hear
the
concern
of
the
SME
sector
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
the
SME
sector
be
only
one
sector
in
society
.
I
know
the
minister
have
to
represent
every
swathe
of
society
in
this
argument
but
there
seem
to
be
too
much
of
what
the
SME
sector
have
say
in
she
response
to
this
motion
and
not
enough
of
what
a
august
body
,
the
National
woman
's
Council
of
Ireland
,
have
say
.
that
it
support
this
campaign
on
behalf
of
the
woman
of
Ireland
should
be
enough
for
any
progressive
government
to
stand
up
and
take
stock
,
listen
and
respond
accordingly
.
it
be
not
long
since
member
of
this
House
,
now
Minister
of
the
Government
,
stand
up
in
this
House
and
,
to
coin
a
phrase
,
speak
on
the
side
of
the
angel
on
this
issue
.
it
be
deeply
disappointing
that
they
have
go
to
the
other
side
in
a
heartbeat
.
the
testimonial
be
real
.
this
be
email
from
real
people
that
we
be
all
receive
.
a
baby
girl
be
screen
due
to
reflux
and
no
hand
-
on
help
be
available
or
recommend
from
gps
,
lactation
consultant
and
osteopath
.
it
be
say
that
phone
consultation
be
not
the
same
.
the
baby
suffer
unnecessarily
for
week
until
thing
settle
down
for
she
.
her
parent
suffer
.
another
mother
say
this
be
not
the
happy
maternity
leave
she
be
look
forward
to
when
have
she
baby
.
she
be
due
back
to
work
in
September
but
she
cannot
get
childcare
sort
due
to
restriction
.
this
mean
she
will
need
to
take
unpaid
leave
,
which
will
create
its
own
financial
stress
and
burden
.
many
of
we
will
have
go
through
this
process
.
as
a
father
of
two
small
child
,
I
can
relate
to
this
.
however
,
because
we
be
not
then
in
a
Covid
-
type
situation
,
my
family
have
access
to
all
of
the
service
that
new
parent
can
expect
to
avail
of
.
this
be
not
available
for
many
of
this
woman
.
as
a
society
,
we
can
do
a
lot
more
.
Senator
Marie
Sherlock
,
who
,
in
case
anyone
be
wonder
,
be
a
first
cousin
of
mine
,
get
the
wording
right
on
this
issue
,
when
she
say
the
follow
:
the
extension
in
parental
leave
will
not
become
available
until
November
2020
.
this
mean
that
the
crisis
face
a
number
of
parent
who
have
exhaust
all
they
maternity
,
paternity
and
parental
leave
and
who
cannot
secure
childcare
for
they
young
baby
be
not
resolve
.
this
parent
be
still
face
stark
choice
.
will
the
minister
revisit
this
issue
?
I
know
she
be
a
progressive
minister
and
if
she
be
to
revisit
this
,
she
would
do
a
great
service
to
many
woman
and
family
throughout
this
country
.
I
congratulate
the
new
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Hildegarde
Naughton
,
on
she
appointment
.
I
have
not
have
a
chance
to
do
so
formally
and
I
wish
she
the
very
good
of
luck
with
the
journey
ahead
.
person
may
be
aware
that
we
be
in
the
same
year
in
college
at
NUI
Galway
,
so
I
be
very
proud
of
she
accession
to
such
a
high
position
.
well
do
to
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
will
speak
briefly
to
keep
the
Mallow
relief
road
on
the
political
agenda
.
the
M20
be
very
much
on
the
political
agenda
regard
the
roll
-
out
of
that
motorway
between
Cork
and
Limerick
.
as
part
of
that
,
however
,
what
the
people
of
Mallow
need
and
require
now
be
a
assurance
regard
the
relief
road
for
the
town
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
we
that
the
design
preparation
be
in
play
and
that
consultant
have
be
appoint
since
November
2019
.
we
acknowledge
that
and
there
be
a
process
to
be
go
through
in
that
regard
.
JB
Barry
Transportation
have
be
approve
as
technical
adviser
and
the
study
area
have
be
identify
.
this
project
be
part
of
the
national
development
plan
.
there
be
a
strategic
outcome
which
be
relevant
to
this
project
and
it
come
under
enhance
regional
accessibility
.
I
be
seek
assurance
now
from
the
government
that
this
project
will
not
slip
down
the
political
agenda
and
that
money
will
be
put
behind
this
project
after
the
consultation
process
be
over
so
that
the
project
can
be
deliver
.
it
be
a
essential
project
in
give
relief
for
the
N72
and
N73
.
the
N73
be
in
a
deplorable
state
.
it
be
the
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
road
and
it
need
serious
investment
regard
realignment
.
the
town
of
Mallow
for
many
year
now
,
however
,
have
be
ask
for
money
to
be
make
available
for
a
relief
road
.
it
be
important
that
dovetail
with
any
project
concern
the
m20
in
a
way
that
ensure
a
seamless
join
of
the
two
project
to
give
that
relief
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
government
to
give
a
assurance
that
this
project
will
not
slip
down
the
political
agenda
.
as
I
have
say
,
the
Minister
of
State
will
probably
tell
I
that
the
consultant
have
be
appoint
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
and
we
appreciate
that
design
preparation
be
under
way
.
we
have
be
there
before
and
route
corridor
have
be
assign
before
.
that
be
why
we
want
to
remain
vigilant
about
ensure
that
the
town
of
Mallow
be
not
leave
behind
in
any
capital
investment
for
road
infrastructure
.
it
be
a
key
reference
town
in
the
province
of
Munster
and
a
key
point
of
connectivity
between
Kerry
and
Dublin
as
well
.
I
appeal
to
the
Minister
of
State
to
keep
that
in
mind
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
she
reply
.
again
,
I
wish
to
reiterate
the
point
that
while
there
be
statutory
process
to
be
go
through
in
respect
of
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
's
responsibility
in
that
regard
,
it
be
important
to
state
that
there
be
considerable
political
capital
in
delivery
of
road
.
that
political
capital
come
from
the
fact
that
government
decision
be
make
in
respect
of
infrastructural
project
like
road
throughout
the
country
.
I
be
again
call
on
the
government
,
once
the
consultation
period
have
end
,
to
move
to
the
next
stage
so
that
money
can
be
assign
to
carry
out
this
project
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
there
will
be
a
review
of
the
national
development
plan
.
I
acknowledge
that
but
I
be
hopeful
and
optimistic
that
this
government
will
recognise
the
relief
road
from
Mallow
as
be
a
key
project
give
Mallow
's
location
and
centrality
in
the
province
of
Munster
.
we
be
talk
about
regional
development
and
inward
investment
.
we
be
talk
about
open
up
the
south
-
western
region
in
the
context
of
a
keynote
project
like
the
M20
Cork
to
Limerick
road
.
if
we
go
on
a
east
to
west
trajectory
then
it
be
vital
that
the
town
of
Mallow
do
not
get
leave
behind
in
that
analysis
.
notwithstanding
the
response
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
which
I
appreciate
,
and
the
fact
that
there
be
environmental
impact
assessment
report
and
compulsory
purchase
order
to
be
go
through
,
I
be
ask
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
this
she
utmost
priority
.
as
it
be
now
past
midnight
,
the
Dáil
stand
adjourn
until
9.30
a.m.
when
it
will
reconvene
at
the
Convention
Centre
Dublin
.
as
it
be
now
past
midnight
,
the

when
it
will
reconvene
at
the
Convention

the
Dáil

adjourn

when
it
will
reconvene
at
the
Convention

Dublin
.
there
be
a
long
-
standing
convention
in
this
House
that
speech
would
be
circulate
.
will
the
acting
chairman
allow
I
to
contribute
?
it
be
a
important
issue
.
it
allow
we
to
digest
the
speech
while
the
minister
be
speak
and
if
there
be
issue
inherent
in
the
speech
that
we
do
not
necessarily
pick
up
on
on
first
hearing
then
we
can
digest
they
.
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
do
not
lose
that
convention
,
acting
Chairman
.
I
thank
the
Acting
Cathaoirleach
and
I
be
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
and
support
the
motion
bring
forward
by
deputy
Funchion
and
Sinn
Féin
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
speech
on
the
basis
that
he
have
set
out
some
form
of
a
blueprint
here
to
be
proceed
with
.
it
be
only
fair
that
we
give
the
new
minister
a
opportunity
to
set
out
he
stall
and
follow
through
on
the
many
promise
that
be
be
make
within
the
speech
.
it
be
for
we
then
to
support
that
as
that
initiative
roll
out
or
call
the
minister
to
book
if
he
be
not
progress
with
he
own
vision
.
I
do
not
need
to
rehearse
for
the
House
the
issue
that
be
inherent
within
childcare
as
we
have
be
talk
about
they
here
for
year
.
I
do
not
need
to
rehash
old
argument
about
the
insecurity
of
employment
and
the
cost
of
childcare
.
this
be
well
-
rehearse
and
well
-
know
to
everybody
and
to
all
of
we
as
public
representative
and
member
of
this
house
because
we
be
represent
the
people
who
be
affect
by
this
issue
day
in
,
day
out
.
the
minister
will
have
regard
to
SIPTU
's
research
on
the
rate
of
attrition
within
the
sector
,
of
which
he
own
official
will
also
be
aware
.
the
bleed
need
to
stop
very
quickly
.
the
minister
state
that
he
be
put
in
place
some
structure
to
seek
to
stop
the
haemorrhage
of
people
move
out
of
the
sector
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
minister
be
meet
with
SIPTU
next
week
to
address
some
of
the
issue
that
it
have
be
highlight
for
quite
some
time
.
let
we
take
that
at
face
value
,
accept
the
minister
's
meeting
with
SIPTU
and
see
what
arise
from
that
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
be
in
a
position
in
the
short
term
,
after
23
August
,
to
give
we
some
solace
on
the
status
of
the
temporary
wage
subsidy
scheme
,
TWSS
.
while
the
minister
state
that
he
be
work
with
he
government
colleague
in
respect
of
the
time
after
23
August
,
I
ask
that
the
minister
and
government
give
consideration
to
the
continuation
of
the
twss
.
he
be
not
tell
we
outright
that
this
be
what
will
happen
but
I
be
hopeful
that
if
we
be
talk
about
real
support
for
the
sector
,
this
be
one
of
the
bedrock
by
which
one
can
support
employment
in
the
sector
.
if
one
look
at
the
rate
of
attrition
,
with
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
I
would
not
be
trumpet
as
a
win
the
fact
where
he
state
in
he
speech
that
over
85
%
of
all
service
which
be
usually
open
in
the
summer
month
have
already
reopen
just
three
week
into
the
reopening
period
.
that
signify
that
there
be
a
rate
of
attrition
already
of
that
service
that
would
normally
open
in
summer
.
I
know
that
there
be
a
natural
rate
of
attrition
which
the
minister
's
official
might
tell
he
of
and
which
he
will
be
aware
of
.
what
I
fear
be
that
,
come
September
,
with
the
uncertainty
that
exist
now
around
the
reopening
of
school
,
where
we
do
not
have
a
clear
pathway
,
this
will
feed
into
a
further
uncertainty
for
childcare
.
for
the
fourth
time
in
this
house
I
will
speak
about
the
regressivity
that
exist
for
woman
and
work
mother
as
a
result
of
Covid
-
19
.
we
have
to
stem
that
immediately
.
if
there
be
uncertainty
about
September
and
the
further
reopening
of
school
,
that
have
a
obvious
knock
-
on
effect
on
crèch
and
on
preschool
and
early
year
.
what
we
need
now
,
and
what
parent
and
that
who
work
within
the
sector
demand
,
be
that
there
be
some
certainty
bring
to
bear
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
be
not
talk
about
week
but
day
,
so
that
people
can
plan
and
have
some
certainty
and
confidence
.
the
minister
speak
about
a
package
of
funding
measure
that
have
be
put
in
place
by
the
Department
and
they
be
to
be
welcome
.
we
will
also
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
have
be
some
pushback
on
that
,
with
some
justification
,
by
the
sector
where
the
package
of
measure
that
be
announce
would
not
necessarily
meet
the
true
cost
of
meet
the
public
health
regulation
.
perhaps
that
be
something
that
be
be
address
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
one
can
not
stand
here
tonight
and
talk
about
childcare
without
talk
about
all
child
.
I
refer
briefly
to
child
in
this
state
who
be
user
of
disability
service
.
it
be
a
frightening
fact
that
there
be
still
no
certainty
about
child
who
use
service
such
as
that
in
my
own
area
such
as
St
Joseph
's
Foundation
,
Enable
Ireland
and
cope
Foundation
,
where
the
perception
be
that
there
be
no
communication
directly
with
parent
with
respect
to
they
child
and
as
to
whether
or
not
they
will
have
access
to
service
come
September
.
this
distil
down
to
service
provide
by
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
as
regards
its
respite
facility
call
Cooleens
House
.
I
will
quote
from
a
letter
I
receive
which
state
that
this
be
the
only
residential
facility
available
to
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
to
accommodate
resident
who
require
isolation
as
per
HSE
and
public
health
guideline
.
it
be
liais
with
the
HSE
on
reopening
service
but
state
,
"
while
we
await
a
positive
response
from
the
HSE
,
we
be
explore
possible
alternate
option
in
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
to
provide
urgently
require
break
for
priority
family
.
"
the
funding
position
of
organisation
like
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
,
which
we
have
right
across
we
constituency
,
be
that
they
ability
to
fundraise
at
present
be
severely
hamper
and
there
be
still
the
uncertainty
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
minister
will
make
and
welcome
the
fact
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
be
here
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
work
with
the
HSE
and
through
she
Department
to
work
through
this
issue
.
if
we
could
treat
this
issue
with
a
sense
of
urgency
to
give
all
family
who
access
disability
service
some
certainty
about
where
they
stand
for
September
,
I
think
it
will
give
people
some
confidence
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
will
require
a
funding
package
because
there
be
no
way
that
organisation
such
as
St.
Joseph's
,
the
cope
Foundation
or
Enable
Ireland
will
be
able
to
provide
or
adhere
to
the
public
health
guideline
unless
they
be
provide
with
a
funding
package
to
be
able
to
meet
the
regulatory
requirement
.
this
particularly
relate
to
transport
and
access
to
service
that
be
so
vital
,
such
as
Cooleen
's
Respite
House
.
there
be
hundred
of
Cooleens
throughout
the
State
.
I
do
not
think
we
can
talk
about
child
without
talk
about
all
child
.
I
want
to
speak
for
that
child
,
as
we
all
have
and
do
through
we
parliamentary
question
,
whose
parent
be
beside
themselves
with
worry
about
where
they
stand
in
all
of
this
.
they
feel
like
forget
people
at
present
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
condescending
or
patronising
but
I
know
both
minister
to
be
inherently
good
and
decent
people
.
I
be
proud
to
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
people
such
as
Deputy
Function
and
Rabbitte
when
we
be
all
in
opposition
,
because
they
fight
the
good
fight
.
I
know
the
Minister
will
fight
the
good
fight
for
the
people
I
speak
of
tonight
.
I
give
some
welcome
to
the
minister
's
speech
.
it
be
a
guard
,
cautious
welcome
,
as
the
minister
will
appreciate
,
but
we
need
to
move
towards
a
fully
-
fund
model
.
if
it
be
a
fully
-
fund
model
and
private
operator
be
operate
within
that
system
,
there
be
a
challenge
which
everybody
acknowledge
.
the
one
thing
that
I
think
everybody
be
unite
on
be
that
we
have
to
stem
the
tide
of
attrition
of
worker
within
the
sector
.
if
the
minister
,
through
the
working
group
,
come
up
with
a
model
of
childcare
that
every
parent
and
child
can
be
happy
in
,
whether
it
be
a
blend
model
,
a
fully
-
fund
model
,
a
for
-
profit
or
a
not
-
for
-
profit
,
then
let
we
work
through
all
of
that
when
the
proposal
come
before
we
.
we
have
not
even
get
to
that
starting
gate
yet
.
we
recognise
that
it
be
fund
to
the
tune
of
60
%
but
I
think
that
we
can
go
further
.
in
the
current
climate
,
there
have
never
be
a
great
opportunity
to
take
that
one
step
further
,
and
in
this
crisis
that
we
have
at
present
,
now
be
the
time
for
lateral
and
imaginative
thinking
.
the
minister
will
find
that
if
the
government
move
in
that
direction
,
we
in
the
Labour
Party
will
certainly
move
in
lockstep
with
the
minister
if
we
feel
that
it
be
a
genuine
effort
to
create
a
properly
and
fully
-
fund
model
of
childcare
.
I
will
do
my
good
and
bring
the
strong
case
make
by
the
deputy
to
Irish
Water
.
I

I
will

my
good

let
we
be
100
%
clear
.
Joan
Burton
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
change
to
the
pup
bring
by
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
on
12
July
through
the
statutory
instrument
,
SI
242/2020
.
with
no
public
notice
,
the
minister
change
the
rule
for
the
Covid
-
19
pup
and
for
other
unemployment
payment
mean
that
recipient
could
not
take
holiday
abroad
.
previously
,
they
be
allow
two
week
in
any
calendar
year
for
a
holiday
without
lose
entitlement
to
jobseeker
's
benefit
.
the
Taoiseach
have
now
say
there
should
be
a
review
of
case
where
people
who
travel
be
not
aware
they
be
at
risk
of
lose
they
income
.
some
104
individual
have
the
pup
stop
in
the
last
two
week
follow
check
at
airport
and
a
further
44
have
benefit
such
as
jobseeker
's
allowance
cut
off
.
today
on
"
Morning
Ireland
"
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
say
the
statutory
instrument
be
not
discuss
at
cabinet
,
which
be
not
unusual
.
however
,
be
the
advice
of
the
Attorney
General
seek
?
that
be
a
key
question
in
all
of
this
.
there
be
question
about
the
legal
standing
of
the
regulation
,
as
the
travel
advisory
on
which
it
be
base
have
no
legal
standing
.
as
the
people
be
not
inform
of
the
change
,
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
they
could
travel
under
the
normal
rule
that
previously
apply
.
since
2007
,
social
welfare
regulation
have
provide
that
recipient
of
jobseeker
's
benefit
can
leave
the
State
for
two
week
of
holiday
.
the
minister
's
regulation
change
that
.
the
Tánaiste
say
on
Sunday
that
people
be
now
require
to
be
genuinely
seek
work
if
on
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
.
however
,
do
that
apply
to
that
work
in
a
pub
or
the
entertainment
industry
?
the
gov.ie
website
be
change
on
Monday
to
reflect
this
comment
.
the
government
have
still
not
clarify
this
.
it
be
not
clear
if
there
have
be
a
regulation
stipulate
that
that
on
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
must
be
actively
seek
work
now
.
the
Taoiseach
have
now
order
a
investigation
into
how
the
government
website
be
change
.
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
have
ask
the
Department
how
it
be
get
datum
to
block
benefit
payment
.
there
be
key
question
.
as
it
be
a
statutory
instrument
base
on
advice
from
another
Department
,
be
the
travel
ban
legal
?
do
the
Attorney
General
sign
off
on
this
?
be
there
a
change
in
the
condition
that
apply
to
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
?
must
people
be
actively
seek
work
since
Monday
when
the
website
be
change
?
be
this
decide
at
cabinet
?
be
there
a
new
regulation
?
from
where
be
the
datum
be
use
to
stop
people
come
?
what
be
the
reasonable
grounds
that
apply
and
why
be
people
be
stop
in
the
airport
not
be
tell
it
be
for
social
welfare
purpose
?
I
go
back
to
Joan
Burton
.
the
social
Welfare
and
Pension
Act
2012
provide
power
for
a
Garda
Síochána
to
assist
with
tackle
fraud
,
but
it
be
the
minister
who
change
the
rule
without
notice
early
this
month
.
the
legal
basis
for
this
check
be
section
250
(
16
)
of
the
social
Welfare
Consolidation
Act
2005
,
as
amend
by
section
17
of
the
social
Welfare
and
Pension
Act
2012
.
the
issue
here
be
how
the
regulation
be
change
,
not
social
welfare
inspector
at
the
airport
.
since
March
of
this
year
,
more
than
2000
pandemic
unemployment
payment
claim
have
be
close
as
a
result
of
check
carry
out
at
Dublin
Airport
.
we
do
not
know
how
the
Department
be
access
and
process
all
this
information
.
from
anecdotal
report
,
it
appear
people
be
not
be
tell
when
stop
that
this
be
for
social
welfare
control
.
under
the
law
,
a
social
welfare
inspector
accompany
by
a
garda
or
a
garda
act
for
the
Department
must
have
reasonable
grounds
for
believe
that
there
have
be
a
contravention
of
the
act
.
the
anecdotal
evidence
we
have
hear
on
various
radio
show
today
from
people
who
have
be
stop
do
not
seem
to
reflect
the
grounds
lay
out
in
the
law
.
the
minister
and
she
Department
have
not
clarify
why
she
do
not
publicise
the
change
in
the
regulation
over
two
week
ago
when
she
introduce
the
statutory
instrument
.
the
Department
change
the
guidance
online
on
gov.ie
/
welfare
on
Monday
follow
the
Tánaiste
's
comment
on
"
the
Week
in
Politics
"
.
it
be
the
Fine
Gael
Minister
who
change
the
rule
for
people
on
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
without
clear
it
through
the
cabinet
or
tell
the
public
.
it
be
not
clear
if
welfare
recipient
be
allow
to
travel
to
a
green
list
country
.
the
statutory
instrument
refer
to
the
general
travel
advisory
from
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
the
government
have
not
provide
a
definition
of
what
essential
travel
be
,
nor
have
it
ban
people
from
leave
the
country
.
from
where
be
the
datum
for
check
people
leave
the
country
come
?
be
it
on
the
basis
of
Garda
check
at
the
airport
?
what
be
the
reasonable
grounds
be
use
?
Gardaí
be
ask
people
for
they
name
,
address
and
pps
number
,
but
not
tell
they
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
social
welfare
check
.
what
be
the
reasonable
grounds
for
believe
there
have
be
a
contravention
?
the
people
be
demand
that
this
question
be
answer
.
I
refer
the
minister
to
a
COVID
-
19
law
and
human
rights
observatory
document
which
be
publish
by
Dr.
Mel
Cousin
of
Trinity
College
Dublin
.
it
be
a
very
interesting
document
entitle
,
pandemic
unemployment
payment
:
holiday
in
the
Sun
?
I
will
cite
some
extract
from
it
.
it
state
:
unlike
most
social
welfare
payment
,
pup
be
base
on
a
(
unpublished
)
administrative
scheme
.
thus
the
normal
rule
in
relation
to
claim
,
payment
,
decision
,
appeal
,
etc.
set
out
in
the
social
Welfare
Act
do
not
apply
.
however
,
this
do
not
mean
that
the
scheme
can
be
operate
on
a
arbitrary
basis
and
the
normal
rule
of
administrative
(
and
human
rights
)
law
apply
.
so
the
question
arise
as
to
what
be
the
legal
basis
for
the
decision
not
to
make
payment
to
people
on
holiday
and
on
they
return
?
that
be
a
very
legitimate
question
that
demand
clarification
from
the
minister
and
she
Department
.
the
document
go
on
to
state
:
the
legal
change
to
[
jobseeker
's
benefit
]
be
make
as
of
10
July
.
it
be
not
clear
when
exactly
the
change
be
make
to
the
pup
condition
although
it
have
be
make
as
of
27
July
.
Principle
of
administrative
law
would
not
seem
to
allow
person
to
be
disqualify
for
a
benefit
on
the
basis
of
a
rule
which
have
not
yet
be
make
or
of
which
they
be
unaware
so
the
rule
concern
non-payment
of
pup
abroad
would
seem
to
apply
somewhere
between
10
and
27
July
(
whenever
it
be
actually
make
and
notify
to
claimant
)
.
this
be
another
valid
point
this
eminent
legal
practitioner
have
raise
.
it
deserve
attention
and
it
deserve
to
be
answer
.
every
point
I
have
just
raise
be
pertinent
to
the
legislation
.
I
will
briefly
speak
to
certain
section
.
we
acknowledge
that
section
6
provide
that
some
of
the
expenditure
incur
to
date
on
the
pup
,
which
have
be
pay
as
a
supplementary
welfare
allowance
or
urgent
need
payment
,
may
be
charge
to
the
social
Insurance
Fund
.
what
be
the
monetary
implication
of
this
measure
for
the
social
Insurance
Fund
?
be
this
a
raid
on
cash
to
avoid
raise
tax
or
borrowing
?
do
this
risk
destabilise
the
already
weaken
fund
?
be
this
a
retrospective
measure
?
be
we
to
draw
on
the
fund
to
cover
cost
that
have
be
incur
through
this
supplementary
welfare
allowance
?
if
so
,
be
this
kind
of
retrospective
legislation
constitutional
?
I
again
seek
clarity
from
the
minister
on
that
point
.
there
be
set
to
be
a
hefty
surplus
in
the
fund
,
which
have
be
identify
as
a
source
of
funding
to
allow
for
the
delay
in
raise
the
pension
entitlement
age
.
will
this
window
of
opportunity
now
be
close
?
section
6
provide
that
some
of
the
expenditure
incur
to
date
on
the
pup
,
which
have
be
pay
on
a
special
welfare
allowance
or
urgent
need
payment
,
may
be
charge
to
the
social
Insurance
Fund
.
that
be
worth
repeat
.
there
be
no
link
,
however
,
between
social
insurance
contribution
and
eligibility
for
the
pup
.
student
,
for
example
,
would
not
have
sufficient
prsi
contribution
record
.
deplete
the
social
Insurance
Fund
surplus
,
especially
when
it
be
likely
to
come
under
pressure
to
pay
for
insolvency
and
redundancy
payment
,
do
not
seem
to
be
sound
public
policy
.
section
9
be
a
technical
amendment
,
which
formally
identify
the
new
Covid
-
19
pup
as
a
social
insurance
benefit
within
the
social
welfare
code
.
if
the
pup
become
a
social
welfare
entitlement
base
on
payment
of
social
insurance
,
will
that
change
the
situation
for
people
travel
abroad
?
I
have
already
speak
to
this
issue
.
Jobseeker
's
benefit
,
for
example
,
be
payable
for
up
to
two
week
of
holiday
abroad
if
travel
advice
be
follow
.
it
appear
,
however
,
that
quarantine
be
not
cover
.
if
people
travel
abroad
to
seek
work
or
to
visit
family
for
sound
medical
reason
,
or
if
they
travel
within
we
common
travel
area
with
the
UK
or
within
the
EU
common
Market
,
can
they
be
deny
a
social
insurance
-
related
entitlement
?
as
time
go
by
,
there
may
be
increase
number
of
people
on
the
pup
go
abroad
to
seek
work
.
they
entitlement
to
a
stable
income
need
to
be
secure
.
if
the
new
definition
of
PUP
end
up
exclude
people
who
be
entitle
to
it
as
a
form
of
supplementary
welfare
allowance
,
will
the
old
form
of
pup
still
be
available
to
prevent
people
lose
they
income
or
drop
to
a
much
low
level
of
income
?
as
we
all
know
,
supplementary
welfare
allowance
be
base
on
open
rule
,
which
allow
discretion
,
and
allow
for
people
to
be
give
money
in
a
variety
of
circumstance
.
it
seem
likely
that
any
legislating
for
pup
will
tighten
the
criterion
and
exclude
people
who
may
be
in
dire
need
of
a
supplementary
welfare
allowance
payment
.
this
be
again
something
I
hope
the
minister
will
clarify
.
like
other
speaker
,
I
would
also
like
to
speak
on
behalf
of
that
involved
in
the
entertainment
and
culture
sector
.
as
member
,
we
will
all
have
receive
email
from
the
Music
&
Entertainment
Association
of
Ireland
.
I
will
quote
the
email
that
I
receive
from
somebody
involved
in
that
group
:
I
be
write
to
you
as
a
member
of
the
Music
&
Entertainment
Association
of
Ireland
(
MEAI
)
to
express
my
anger
at
the
lack
of
proper
support
for
self
-
employ
worker
in
the
July
stimulus
.
the
Minister
for
Art
in
she
support
package
for
the
Art
,
have
fail
utterly
to
understand
how
my
profession
work
.
as
a
self
-
employ
musician
/
entertainer
I
do
not
need
a
'
Stimulus
Package
'
-
I
need
a
Survival
Package
.
as
a
worker
in
this
industry
,
I
be
unable
to
earn
a
living
due
to
the
government
Guideline
on
social
distancing
.
my
industry
be
sacrifice
its
right
to
work
and
earn
a
living
in
order
to
help
protect
the
health
of
the
nation
during
this
pandemic
.
I
be
not
unemployed
.
I
be
force
not
to
be
employ
as
a
direct
result
of
government
guideline
.
my
colleague
in
the
industry
be
face
hardship
like
never
before
.
MEAI
conduct
a
survey
of
its
4100
member
recently
.
-
68.5
%
depend
solely
on
the
Music

.
-
31.6

the
nub
of
what
this

ask
for
be
a
immediate

of

of
€350
a
week
from

for
all
its
member
for
the
duration
of
the
crisis
and
until
the
industry
be
able
to
reopen
without
social
distancing
.
that
be
not
a
unreasonable
request
and
I
hope
the
minister
will
give
some
consideration
to
the
thousand
of
people
in
this
sector
who
be
affect
by
the
cut
to
this
payment
.
the
Covid
-
19
work
group
of
the
event
production
industry
also
write
to
I
.
I
will
again
quote
from
a
email
from
one
of
its
member
:
I
have
speak
to
3
company
today
,
all
in
business
20
+
year
.
one
with
6
staff
,
the
other
two
have
20
plus
staff
.
one
be
a
event
safety
consultant
,
one
be
Event
Power
and
the
final
one
be
a
sound
&
lighting
company
.
all
three
will
be
out
of
business
by
September
1st
.
this
package
be
devastating
for
sme
in
general
but
it
be
essentially
a
death
sentence
for
that
operate
in
the
live
Entertainment
Sector
.
this
person
go
on
to
say
:
the
removal
of
the
covid
payment
to
proprietary
director
seem
to
illustrate
a
basic
understanding
of
small
and
medium
size
business
.
small
business
owner
:
-
tend
to
be
majority
shareholder
-
tend
to
be
employee
-
be
the
first
people
into
work
in
the
morning
and
the
last
people
pay
-
most
business
owner
pay
they
staff
first
when
time
be
tough
-
have
personal
equity
tie
up
in
the
business
e.g.
house
tie
to
business
loan
.
this
be
not
wealthy
people
.
this
person
continue
:
the
event
industry
be
make
up
of
hundred
of
small
business
and
sole
trader
who
,
although
normally
profitable
,
be
depend
on
the
covid
payment
many
have
sink
savings
and
personal
asset
into
they
enterprise
.
simply
own
you
own
business
now
singles
you
out
for
further
impoverishment
on
top
of
the
many
responsibility
of
company
ownership
and
,
in
one
swoop
the
government
be
crush
the
one
group
who
should
be
support
have
already
prove
that
they
have
the
strength
and
drive
to
create
a
company
and
job
.
I
will
make
reference
to
my
own
local
area
where
,
in
2019
,
the
Indiependence
festival
in
Mitchelstown
generate
in
excess
of
€
500000
in
vat
alone
for
the
Exchequer
.
this
festival
should
have
be
go
into
its
15th
edition
this
week
,
with
15000
people
descend
on
Mitchelstown
and
spend
in
excess
of
€
1.5
million
locally
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
stimulus
package
to
help
event
such
as
this
to
survive
the
next
12
month
so
that
they
can
return
to
generate
large
sum
for
the
Exchequer
when
the
public
health
advice
allow
for
same
.
I
again
ask
the
minister
to
please
give
consideration
to
the
people
who
be
work
within
this
sector
,
with
a
view
to
revise
the
rule
to
allow
they
not
to
fall
below
a
social
floor
,
whereby
they
lose
that
vital
protection
to
sustain
themselves
throughout
this
crisis
.
I
start
off
my
submission
in
respect
of
the
issue
of
the
past
24
hour
.
I
have
ask
a
litany
of
question
.
I
be
very
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
respond
to
the
question
I
have
ask
because
at
this
stage
the
public
demand
clarity
in
respect
of
the
pup
and
the
stop
of
people
at
airport
in
this
State
.
that
have
really
upset
thousand
of
genuine
people
go
about
they
business
and
act
within
the
law
as
they
see
it
,
rather
than
ultra
vire
.
all
the
world
be
a
stage
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
deputy
Gannon
's
early
intervention
.
on
the
point
the
minister
make
,
in
my
early
contribution
I
say
that
there
be
question
about
the
regulation
,
as
the
travel
advisory
on
which
it
be
base
have
no
legal
standing
.
person
be
not
inform
of
the
change
so
there
be
potentially
a
legitimate
expectation
they
could
travel
under
the
normal
rule
that
previously
apply
.
I
have
also
ask
other
question
of
the
minister
which
have
not
be
answer
.
there
be
further
section
to
be
discuss
on
which
I
have
question
which
have
not
be
answer
.
I
previously
ask
about
the
status
of
the
social
Insurance
Fund
.
I
may
have
miss
the
minister
's
response
.
in
she
speech
,
she
say
:
"
this
be
a
accounting
mechanism
that
do
not
have
any
impact
on
the
entitlement
of
claimant
.
"
this
be
,
however
,
to
be
pay
for
from
the
social
Insurance
Fund
.
what
exact
figure
will
be
extract
from
the
fund
?
it
be
vital
in
fund
retirement
and
this
measure
may
have
a
impact
on
whether
the
retirement
age
in
this
country
be
lower
.
I
support
the
amendment
.
the
government
have
say
this
stimulus
package
be
worth
more
than
€
7
billion
.
for
a
sum
that
would
be
quite
small
relative
to
the
cost
of
the
stimulus
package
,
although
the
figure
be
indeterminate
at
present
,
the
livelihood
of
that
within
the
sector
for
which
we
have
all
speak
over
the
last
number
of
hour
could
be
sustain
.
the
most
vulnerable
could
be
support
.
they
be
culturally
and
economically
productive
and
they
be
we
own
people
.
when
all
of
the
analysis
be
do
and
all
the
figure
be
tot
up
when
we
come
out
of
this
crisis
,
we
will
see
that
corporate
Ireland
have
do
very
well
but
the
people
that
produce
culture
and
music
-----
-----
will
have
be
relegate
to
the
low
tier
.
the
government
have
a
opportunity
to
recognise
the
sector
that
we
celebrate
and
which
export
this
culture
as
part
of
the
soft
diplomacy
of
international
relation
.
we
sell
this
globally
as
a
major
comparative
advantage
economically
,
and
we
be
do
the
culture
and
entertainment
sector
a
disservice
by
not
support
it
.
I
appeal
to
the
minister
to
reconsider
she
position
in
respect
of
this
.
I
ask
she
not
to
make
it
so
onerous
on
people
who
have
lose
they
job
in
so
many
different
sector
,
who
will
feel
like
they
be
go
to
the
poorhouse
look
for
alm
when
this
section
become
law
.
it
need
to
be
revise
or
rather
delete
.
in
regard
to
the
free
zone
,
Rosslare
Europort
be
seek
the
creation
of
such
a
zone
at
the
port
to
facilitate
and
encourage
the
development
of
business
.
the
port
have
be
engage
with
Wexford
County
Council
on
this
matter
.
among
the
business
opportunity
the
port
wish
to
pursue
in
the
context
of
a
free
zone
be
the
creation
of
a
facility
to
service
the
grow
offshore
wind
industry
.
Free
zone
be
secure
custom
area
within
the
European
Union
where
non-Union
goods
can
be
introduce
free
of
import
duty
and
charge
and
commercial
policy
measure
.
this
goods
may
,
follow
time
in
the
free
zone
,
be
release
to
the
domestic
market
subject
to
payment
of
import
duty
and
other
charge
.
Rosslare
Europort
envisage
that

free
zone
would
have
the
ability
to
operate
and
install
offshore
wind
farm
in
a

effective
and
competitive
manner
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
proposal
for
a
free
zone
at
Rosslare
be
at
a
very
early
concept
stage
and
a
full
business
proposal
would

this
will

of

I
rise
to
support
the
legislation
and
thank
the
minister
for
bring
it
forward
.
it
be
absolutely
timely
and
it
send
a
clear
signal
of
the
government
's
intention
in
respect
to
a
pathway
for
pub
to
reopen
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
minister
state
that
the
power
to
be
confer
on
the
Garda
be
significant
.
we
take
solace
in
the
fact
that
there
be
a
sunset
clause
in
the
legislation
and
this
offset
the
risk
of
it
be
apply
in
a
nefarious
way
.
I
would
like
the
government
to
give
a
exact
date
on
which
the
pub
can
reopen
.
it
would
give
great
confidence
to
publican
throughout
the
land
and
it
be
something
they
be
wait
on
with
some
degree
of
patience
at
this
stage
.
I
acknowledge
this
patience
,
particularly
that
of
that
publican
who
might
have
be
tempt
to
move
into
the
food
sector
but
who
resist
that
temptation
because
they
be
confident
that
the
government
could
put
in
place
a
set
of
action
which
would
see
they
reopening
what
be
,
in
the
main
,
family
-
own
and
intergenerational
business
.
notwithstand
the
legislation
before
we
,
it
be
important
that
we
beal
to
it
a
clear
timeframe
and
date
for
publican
so
they
can
get
back
to
work
.
in
my
experience
frequent
or
sit
at
bar
and
speak
to
publican
over
the
past
number
of
week
,
I
know
they
be
the
policeman
and
policewoman
of
they
establishment
.
I
feel
strongly
from
talk
to
they
that
this
legislation
will
not
apply
to
the
vast
majority
of
they
as
they
be
very
good
at
police
they
own
house
and
be
compliant
with
the
law
.
we
will
support
the
legislation
,
which
confer
significant
power
on
the
Garda
,
accord
to
the
minister
,
but
I
hope
its
provision
never
have
to
be
use
.
I
know
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
case
,
the
publican
I
refer
to
who
own
they
house
and
be
deeply
invest
in
they
community
will
continue
to
police
they
house
as
they
always
have
do
.
we
support
the
legislation
but
we
want
a
definitive
timeline
with
a
exact
date
by
which
the
pub
can
reopen
and
get
back
to
business
in
we
community
.
I
have
already
say
we
have
hear
from
they
and
we
hear
from
they
day
in
and
day
out
.
they
have
demonstrate
a
remarkable
amount
of
fortitude
when
they
have
see
what
have
go
on
around
they
in
they
community
.
they
have
resist
the
temptation
to
flout
the
law
or
to
do
anything
that
would
put
they
on
the
wrong
side
of
it
,
because
for
the
most
part
they
be
good
and
law
-
abide
citizen
.
they
be
great
supporter
of
sport
,
community
and
voluntary
organisation
.
the
time
be
now
right
for
they
to
reopen
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
introduction
of
this
legislation
and
I
thank
she
for
it
.
as
she
say
in
she
own
speech
,
the
Garda
must
take
a
graduate
,
proportionate
and
human
rights
-
base
approach
.
I
be
pretty
sure
that
be
what
it
will
do
.
I
appeal
to
the
minister
to
give
we
a
date
on
which
the
government
will
allow
the
pub
to
reopen
.
I
understand
that
be
agree
this
morning
and
it
will
be
take
tomorrow
before
committee
stage
.
I
have
witness
a
degree
of
anxiety
on
the
part
of
professional
work
in
the
childcare
sector
,
when
they
have
to
be
test
for
Covid
-
19
,
regard
the
time
it
be
take
they
to
get
test
in
some
instance
,
and
then
to
attain
the
result
.
this
be
worry
for
themselves
personally
,
but
also
where
they
be
reasonably
confident
of
a
negative
test
outcome
,
as
they
may
be
out
of
circulation
for
a
considerable
period
,
which
be
understandable
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
establish
a
protocol
that
would
allow
for
the
early
possible
testing
to
be
carry
out
in
sector
that
be
deal
with
child
,
specifically
,
school
and
the
early
year
care
provider
?
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
reply
.
I
appreciate
that
there
be
a
ongoing
engagement
between
he
and
NPHET
as
to
the
prioritising
of
testing
for
that
people
who
be
work
with
child
.
I
reiterate
the
call
that
such
priority
could
be
give
.
nobody
in
society
will
oppose
the
idea
of
prioritise
testing
where
people
be
work
with
child
.
I
also
seek
the
minister
's
perspective
on
the
fact
that
there
be
no
sick
pay
scheme
in
place
for
worker
within
the
childcare
sector
.
the
absence
of
such
a
sick
pay
scheme
have
a
bear
on
whether
somebody
will
decide
to
stay
in
employment
and
it
pose
a
certain
risk
.
give
that
the
minister
be
proactive
in
respect
of
engage
with
NPHET
on
the
prioritise
testing
,
I
would
be
grateful
to
know
whether
he
be
give
consideration
to
,
for
instance
,
SIPTU
's
campaign
for
a
sick
pay
scheme
for
that
people
currently
work
within
the
sector
.
again
,
I
welcome
that
the
minister
be
proactive
in
respect
of
engage
with
the
stakeholder
.
we
know
that
79
%
of
early
year
professional
do
not
have
a
sick
pay
scheme
at
work
.
person
may
not
make
the
link
between
testing
for
Covid
-
19
and
a
sick
pay
scheme
but
if
there
be
a
sick
pay
scheme
in
situ
that
be
embed
within
the
system
,
it
give
comfort
largely
to
parent
who
we
be
talk
about
across
the
sector
.
there
be
a
Labour
Party
Bill
on
a
sick
pay
scheme
for
all
worker
but
for
this
sector
in
particular
,
it
give
comfort
to
the
professional
work
within
it
that
they
can
avail
of
such
a
scheme
if
it
be
available
.
as
I
say
,
79
%
of
early
year
professional
do
not
have
a
sick
pay
scheme
at
work
.
if
we
be
talk
about
continue
professional
development
,
CPD
,
and
embed
more
formalisation
of
the
sector
in
Irish
society
,
this
have
to
become
one
of
the
bulwark
for
ensure
that
worker
be
look
after
.
it
be
the
sting
in
the
tail
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order

,
the

be
postpone
until

I
note
that
no
minister
be
in
situ
at
present
.
I
note
the
presence
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Feighan
,
and
I
be
very
sorry
that
the
senior
minister
have
take
it
upon
himself
to
leave
during
a
discussion
on
such
a
important
motion
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
regulation
be
overkill
but
I
worry
that
the
motion
before
we
now
,
if
it
succeed
,
would
result
in
annul
all
the
regulation
,
and
that
could
also
be
overkill
.
while
we
agree
with
the
spirit
of
what
be
be
debate
,
if
there
be
a
attempt
to
annul
the
regulation
completely
,
it
be
important
that
we
recognise
that
such
a
absence
,
if
there
be
a
confirm
case
of
Covid
-
19
in
a
public
house
for
instance
,
could
result
in
nullify
any
attempt
to
carry
out
contact
tracing
.
there
be
problem
with
the
motion
,
notwithstand
the
rightful
anger
that
be
be
express
at
the
government
's
handling
of
the
imposition
of
this
regulation
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
pub
will
reopen
on
21
September
.
that
of
we
in
this
house
who
be
reasonable
and
rational
have
be
lobby
minister
for
the
past
number
of
month
and
reflect
the
view
of
the
VFI
and
other
representative
body
but
,
most
important
,
intergenerational
family
who
have
run
good
public
house
for
donkey
's
year
and
find
themselves
leave
out
in
the
cold
,
look
askance
at
the
contradictory
statement
make
by
the
minister
and
the
government
on
the
imposition
of
regulation
on
other
sector
.
that
publican
be
leave
to
wonder
would
they
ever
be
let
back
in
from
the
cold
.
I
be
glad
that
pub
will
reopen
on
21
September
.
I
be
hopeful
that
will
be
adhere
to
and
that
the
government
will
be
bind
by
that
date
because
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
get
pub
reopen
not
only
to
purvey
alcohol
but
to
allow
for
the
impact
they
have
on
they
community
by
deliver
intergenerational
solidarity
,
serve
the
fundamental
human
need
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
coalesce
with
other
member
of
a
community
,
to
meet
,
talk
,
chat
,
bitch
and
moan
,
if
I
be
not
use
unparliamentary
language
when
I
say
that
.
person
need
to
bicker
and
to
be
allow
get
on
with
they
life
in
a
safe
way
that
allow
for
normal
life
to
continue
insofar
as
we
can
call
the
circumstance
in
which
we
live
at
present
"
normal
"
.
the
minister
need
to
stop
act
like
a
independent
observer
from
Stokes
Kennedy
Crowley
.
he
need
to
start
to
feel
what
it
be
like
to
live
in
this
country
at
present
.
there
have
be
contradiction
.
the
people
be
tell
one
week
that
they
can
go
to
a
GAA
game
,
a
sport
that
they
have
be
follow
for
year
,
and
the
next
minute
they
be
not
allow
to
watch
the
sport
that
be
in
the
very
blood
that
course
through
they
vein
.
the
minister
need
to
start
have
more
empathy
and
not
to
be
dispassionate
.
he
need
to
get
out
and
start
meet
real
people
because
I
fear
that
he
be
be
cocoon
,
to
use
that
unfortunate
phrase
.
I
feel
that
he
have
not
go
out
and
meet
the
people
because
,
if
he
do
so
,
he
would
probably
sense
the
anger
and
frustration
of
the
people
live
in
this
country
who
want
to
abide
by
the
regulation
and
obey
the
rule
but
also
want
some
degree
of
normality
to
be
restore
to
they
life
to
allow
they
to
be
able
to
do
the
thing
they
always
do
.
they
do
not
want
to
be
tell
that
they
can
do
something
one
minute
only
for
it
to
be
stop
in
its
track
the
next
.
we
need
to
have
a
degree
of
humanity
,
sympathy
and
emotional
intelligence
about
how
we
conduct
we
affair
in
this
parliament
.
we
look
to
the
government
to
provide
that
.
we
have
give
to
this
government
all
of
the
support
that
could
reasonably
be
give
by
any
opposition
in
the
time
in
which
we
live
but
common
sense
have
now
break
down
.
it
need
to
be
restore
and
we
be
ask
the
minister
to
please
take
note
of
the
fact
that
we
be
reflect
the
view
of
ordinary
people
in
the
argument
we
be
make
.
it
be
not
common
sense
to
take
a
occupational
therapist
who
be
work
in
the
HSE
and
put
they
to
work
contact
tracing
.
that
person
be
a
front
-
line
worker
and
we
do
not
know
how
many
of
they
have
be
redeploy
to
contact
trace
.
how
many
people
in
this
State
need
occupational
therapy
as
we
speak
?
it
be
not
common
sense
to
put
a
assistant
psychologist
who
could
be
work
with
a
family
feel
the
psychosocial
effect
of
Covid
-
19
into
contact
tracing
or
testing
.
a
skew
public
policy
be
in
place
at
present
where
good
front
-
line
worker
be
be
take
from
key
and
essential
job
and
be
put
into
area
in
which
they
should
not
be
deploy
.
there
need
to
be
a
root
-
and
-
branch
review
of
how
Covid
be
be
deal
with
and
whether
scarce
resource
be
be
deploy
in
the
most
effective
way
.
I
ask
the
minister
and
the
government
to
start
take
on
the
beef
baron
and
do
a
deep
dive
to
look
at
what
be
happen
in
the
meat
industry
.
I
fear
that
the
baron
be
in
the
ear
of
influential
people
and
have
a
overbearing
influence
on
this
society
that
affect
migrant
and
Irish
worker
who
live
in
we
community
and
feel
the
brunt
of
the
culture
that
exist
within
that
industry
.
it
need
to
be
review
and
take
on
.
we
want
a
sense
of
decency
.
if
there
be
decency
and
common
sense
,
we
will
support
it
,
but
we
have
not
witness
decency
or
common
sense
this
past
few
week
.
I
thank
the
Defence
Force
for
they
massive
effort
and
work
in
they
peacekeeping
duty
over
the

one

I
welcome

to
the
Chamber
and
welcome
she
statement
.
the
announce
€
7.8
million
be
a
significant
sum
of
money
but
it
will
only
become
so
if
the
follow
-
on
service
be
provide
.
last
night
in
the
House
I
raise
the
issue
of
professional
such
as
occupational
therapist
be
deploy
to
contact
tracing
and
even
testing
.
that
make
a
mockery
of
any
attempt
to
ensure
people
who
rely
on
the
follow
-
on
service
arise
from
a
assessment
of
need
would
get
that
service
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
take
a
close
look
at
that
to
see
if
that
people
can
be
bring
back
into
a
core
front
-
line
service
.
if
the
announcement
of
the
€
7.8
million
be
to
mean
anything
for
family
,
it
should
mean
a
follow
-
on
service
become
available
arise
from
the
retrenchment
of
that
who
be
otherwise
engage
at
present
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
point
in
respect
of
90
%
of
day
service
have
reopen
but
forgive
I
if
I
be
sceptical
.
some
90
%
of
the
service
might
be
open
but
that
do
not
mean
people
have
access
to
90
%
of
service
.
person
be
back
on
a
part
-
time
basis
and
it
be
still
very
piecemeal
.
until
we
get
to
the
stage
where
people
have
full
access
to
the
service
they
have
always
enjoy
and
have
a
right
to
,
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
.
to
be
fair
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
she
would
acknowledge
that
.
I
also
want
to
speak
for
organisation
like
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
in
my
neck
of
the
wood
.
one
of
its
facility
,
Cooleens
House
,
have
be
reassign
as
a
isolation
centre
.
it
be
a
respite
house
and
respite
be
key
to
all
of
this
service
for
family
.
I
be
sure
the
Minister
of
State
will
respond
to
this
case
.
if
Cooleens
House
could
revert
to
a
respite
house
and
some
other
such
facility
could
be
find
to
provide
for
isolation
,
that
would
send
a
clear
and
positive
signal
to
that
who
use
the
service
of
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
will
the
minister
of
State
examine
the
relationship
between
the
HSE
and
the
section
38
and
39
organisation
?
the
voluntary
organisation
be
very
much
price
taker
.
they
have
to
accept
the
budget
they
be
give
.
they
must
then
raise
fund
,
which
have
be
challenging
in
the
current
climate
.
I
ask
that
the
HSE
,
on
ministerial
direction
,
give
some
ground
and
financial
leeway
to
this
organisation
in
the
current
climate
in
order
that
they
can
get
on
with
restore
the
service
to
which
people
be
entitle
.
in
my
experience
,
the
relationship
with
the
HSE
have
sometimes
be
lopsided
.
the
HSE
have
come
in
wave
a
stick
or
beat
the
drum
against
some
section
38
and
39
body
.
in
the
current
climate
,
this
organisation
need
a
little
financial
headroom
and
leeway
to
allow
they
to
deliver
service
.
there
need
to
be
a
rebalancing
of
they
relationship
with
the
HSE
.
I
be
sure
the
Minister
of
State
be
conscious
that
without
this
organisation
,
this
service
would
not
be
provide
.
I
make
the
case
for
respite
service
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
reply
,
if
not
today
then
at
some
stage
,
regard
the
metric
for
every
single
person
or
group
who
should
have
access
but
do
not
have
access
at
full
capacity
at
this
time
.
if
that
issue
be
address
and
a
full
service
restore
,
it
would
bring
relief
to
many
family
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
17
September
2020
.
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
if
there
be
a
attempt
at
policy
coherence
in
respect
of
rural
transport
provision
.
Covid
-19
have
highlight
the
weakness
in
school
transport
policy
in
particular
.
we
know
that
currently
there
be
a
review
of
the
school
transport
scheme
but
to
we
mind
there
be
no
point
in
have
a
review
of
the
school
transport
scheme
unless
the
minister
's
Department
be
map
across
the
review
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
if
she
Department
be
develop
a
rural
policy
for
Ireland
I
do
not
think
it
be
possible
to
do
so
without
talk
about
the
totality
of
public
transport
.
increasingly
,
rural
Ireland
be
a
cosmopolitan
place
.
the
people
who
live
there
now
traverse
the
entire
demographic
of
Irish
society
.
without
be
too
verbose
about
it
,
this
September
there
be
a
crisis
regard
the
supply
of
school
transport
.
hopefully
,
that
will
be
work
through
.
there
be
a
opportunity
here
for
policy
coherence
to
radicalise
how
rural
transport
be
develop
.
we
have
local
link
which
,
arguably
,
be
a
very
successful
service
.
that
be
certainly
the
case
in
my
neck
of
the
wood
.
in
develop
a
rural
policy
there
be
no
reason
we
could
not
look
at
the
totality
of
transport
.
I
prevail
upon
the
minister
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
120000
child
use
school
transport
.
I
realise
it
be
not
across
the
minister
's
Department
,
but
there
be
the
potential
to
use
the
5000
bus
involve
in
school
transport
to
transport
other
people
as
well
who
live
in
rural
Ireland
.
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
have
teach
we
that
more
and
more
people
be
connect
.
many
people
who
ordinarily
would
not
have
be
connect
to
Internet
technology
be
now
in
possession
of
smartphone
and
can
use
that
technology
in
a
seamless
way
across
the
age
range
.
it
be
about
develop
a
coherent
supply
of
transport
service
to
allow
people
to
use
the
technology
to
map
on
,
so
that
no
matter
where
they
be
live
they
can
get
access
to
service
and
they
do
not
have
to
go
to
a
place
to
buy
a
ticket
,
for
example
,
as
they
can
use
they
phone
now
.
there
be
a
opportunity
to
radicalise
in
a
positive
sense
how
we
deliver
rural
transport
in
a
more
cosmopolitan
society
,
as
it
be
.
I
be
very
grateful
to
deputy
Brendan
Smith
for
he
act
of
kindness
.
it
be
much
appreciate
.
I
be
delighted
to
speak
in
this
debate
.
I
welcome
the
minister
to
the
House
.
he
will
not
be
a
stranger
to
the
benefit
that
the
music
,
culture
and
art
community
bring
to
society
.
this
point
be
self
-
evident
;
it
be
a
truth
.
it
would
be
very
useful
if
the
government
be
to
consider
restore
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
to
the
thousand
of
people
whom
we
have
hear
from
in
the
past
24
to
48
hour
.
we
would
be
do
they
a
great
service
if
we
be
to
recognise
they
talent
and
the
fact
that
they
be
go
to
be
last
back
into
the
fray
.
I
join
in
the
call
from
other
member
to
ask
for
the
restoration
of
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
.
it
would
have
a
tremendous
impact
in
term
of
keep
people
above
the
threshold
.
many
of
they
have
fall
through
the
floor
.
we
know
of
household
that
have
two
income
arise
from
involvement
in
the
music
or
art
sector
,
or
from
production
,
lighting
or
theatre
company
.
there
be
that
whose
mortgage
be
now
put
in
abeyance
,
and
they
have
experience
a
serious
loss
of
income
.
if
this
could
be
re-examine
,
we
would
all
welcome
it
.
it
be
important
when
we
examine
the
issue
of
stimulus
in
general
that
we
do
not
take
we
eye
off
the
ball
in
respect
of
capital
project
,
particularly
school
project
.
in
my
constituency
,
Cork
East
,
there
be
two
project
of
note
,
one
concern
the
Patrician
Academy
in
Mallow
and
another
concern
the
Carrigtwohill
school
campus
,
under
the
auspices
of
the
education
and
training
board
.
we
learn
today
that
the
tender
process
for
the
Carrigtwohill
project
be
not
expect
to
start
until
the
first
quarter
of
2021
.
we
recognise
that
there
be
delay
but
there
have
be
a
significant
delay
in
this
project
in
very
general
term
.
it
be
announce
in
2012
so
this
have
be
go
on
for
quite
some
time
now
.
the
government
be
accountable
,
no
more
than
we
be
when
we
be
in
government
.
in
light
of
the
delay
with
the
planning
application
,
and
give
that
we
now
hear
there
be
to
be
further
deliberation
on
the
local
road
infrastructure
,
could
the
government
,
as
the
key
stakeholder
and
the
body
that
will
ultimately
be
issue
the
cheque
,
take
the
lead
in
engage
with
the
third
-
party
developer
,
the
local
authority
,
the
education
and
training
board
and
the
local
community
,
which
have
demonstrate
some
forbearance
regard
this
issue
,
with
a
view
to
press
ahead
with
the
vital
project
?
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
miss
a
quarter
regard
progress
be
that
more
prefab
will
be
need
on
the
school
campus
come
September
2021
.
I
raise
this
issue
in
the
context
of
this
debate
because
it
concern
a
stimulus
project
.
it
have
the
potential
to
create
hundred
of
construction
job
.
it
be
pertinent
to
the
debate
we
be
have
today
about
not
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
regard
capital
expenditure
when
there
be
a
deficit
of
the
kind
in
question
.
there
be
a
borrowing
requirement
.
we
can
more
than
adequately
proceed
with
this
project
give
we
borrowing
potential
.
with
regard
to
road
like
the
N72
,
N73
and
the
Fota
Road
,
I
speak
unashamedly
about
my
own
constituency
in
the
context
of
this
debate
because
it
have
the
potential
to
create
job
.

I
would
like
to
ask
the
minister
if
she
have
give
consideration
to
the
restoration
of
the
Covid
payment
for
that
people
who
be
part
of
the
live
entertainment
and
event
sector
.
the
reason
we
be
consistently
make
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
live
entertainment
and
event
sector
be
there
be
no
timeline
for
the
restoration
of
that
job
.
the
loss
of
income
that
have
accrue
to
that
in
that
sector
through
no
fault
of
they
own
,
which
the
minister
will
appreciate
fully
,
have
be
absolutely
devastating
.
the
ability
of
many
of
the
people
work
in
that
sector
to
survive
and
they
quality
of
life
,
even
at
the
tiered
rate
,
have
be
severely
diminish
.
the
net
effect
of
that
will
be
that
many
of
they
may
now
be
force
to
emigrate
.
that
be
the
reality
as
they
will
not
be
able
to
find
work
in
other
sector
because
this
be
quite
technical
and
specify
job
.
I
again
make
the
case
for
that
sector
.
can
the
minister
again
give
consideration
to
look
at
the
issue
in
the
round
?
if
there
be
no
timeline
for
the
reopening
of
the
sector
and
if
we
be
not
go
to
have
cultural
and
sport
event
,
whatever
type
of
event
one
want
to
imagine
that
befit
the
live
entertainment
and
event
sector
,
there
have
to
be
some
scope
for
develop
a
package
.
every
day
,
we
support
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
through
the
IDA
.
we
support
local
enterprise
through
Enterprise
Ireland
.
I
be
also
make
the
case
for
the
other
97
%
but
they
have
some
chance
of
reclaim
they
employment
.
the
live
entertainment
sector
have
no
chance
at
present
.
if
the
minister
be
tell
we
that
she
be
not
of
a
mind
to
up
the
payment
to
€350
,
I
accept
that
.
I
want
to
see
,
however
,
some
sort
of
package
of
support
that
directly
go
into
people
's
house
in
a
way
that
sustain
they
.
will
the
minister
indicate
the
status
of
the
public
service
card
?
not
yet
.
I
do
make
good
use
of
my
Leap
card
and
I
would
like
to
see
that
facility
extend
throughout
the
country
if
possible
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
for
a
status
update
in
respect
of
the
public
service
card
.
I
recognise
that
the
matter
be
before
the
court
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
government
have
appeal
the
decision
regard
the
enforcement
notice
to
the
circuit
Court
.
I
merely
wish
to
ascertain
-
I
do
not
think
this
be
a
sub
judice
issue
-
where
that
process
stand
at
present
.
have
there
be
a
hearing
or
be
there
to
be
a
hearing
?
if
the
latter
be
the
case
,
when
do
the
government
anticipate
that
such
a
hearing
will
take
place
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
answer
.
the
word
"
shortly
"
can
cover
a
multitude
but
I
understand
where
she
be
come
from
and
I
be
not
try
to
be
facetious
.
however
,
it
would
be
good
to
have
a
more
definitive
position
on
this
matter
from
the
government
.
there
be
issue
regard
minor
,
in
particular
,
and
the
very
personal
information
hold
regard
people
under
the
age
of
18
.
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
the
minister
's
perspective
in
term
of
access
service
in
that
instance
.
my
understanding
of
the
issue
-
I
could
be
wrong
and
,
if
so
,
I
will
defer
to
the
minister
-
be
that
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
the
requisite
datum
protection
impact
assessment
be
carry
out
in
respect
of
the
card
.
finally
,
if
the
public
service
card
be
to
succeed
and
to
transcend
its
use
only
within
the
minister
's
Department
,
consideration
should
be
give
,
for
instance
,
to
its
potential
use
as
a
form
of
identification
for
service
user
of
credit
union
.

I
support
the
my

's
Bill
.
unlike
they
counterpart
in
most
other
European
country
,
Irish
worker
have
no
legal
right
to
be
pay
by
they
employer
if
they
be
absent
from
work
because
of
illness
.
whether
to
pay
sick
pay
be
entirely
the
decision
of
a
employer
.
there
be
no
legal
obligation
to
do
so
.
Dr.
Ronan
Glynn
have
speak
on
this
issue
and
say
that
NPHET
have
recommend
to
the
government
that
"
whatever
measure
need
to
be
put
in
place
"
should
be
put
into
place
to
ensure
that
worker
who
be
sick
can
afford
to
not
attend
work
.
Dr.
Glynn
effectively
say
that
the
introduction
of
sick
pay
be
important
to
prevent
the
spread
of
Covid
-
19
and
recommend
the
government
to
take
action
several
week
ago
.
so
far
,
this
government
have
do
nothing
except
to
say
that
it
will
have
a
consultation
process
,
which
the
minister
speak
to
early
.
while
many
union
have
deliver
sick
pay
arrangement
for
they
member
through
collective
bargain
agreement
,
worker
in
non-unionised
job
in
the
private
sector
can
be
force
to
continue
to
work
while
sick
or
else
they
must
rely
upon
social
welfare
.
the
enhance
Covid
-
19
illness
benefit
only
provide
€350
per
week
,
so
if
a
person
be
earn
more
than
this
but
be
struggle
financially
,
he
or
she
may
be
tempt
to
continue
to
work
while
sick
with
Covid
-
19
.
the
issue
experience
in
meat
factory
,
which
play
a
big
part
in
the
lockdown
in
county
Kildare
,
Offaly
and
Laois
,
be
example
of
this
problem
.
all
worker
be
be
ask
not
to
go
to
work
if
they
be
show
symptom
of
Covid
-
19
.
a
employer
,
however
,
be
not
oblige
to
pay
a
worker
who
cannot
come
to
work
because
he
or
she
be
sick
with
Covid
-
19
,
unless
it
be
part
of
the
contract
of
employment
.
this
situation
mean
that
some
worker
who
might
have
symptom
of
coronavirus
be
force
to
go
to
work
as
they
cannot
afford
not
to
,
thus
spread
the
virus
further
.
Ireland
have
a

benefit
scheme
of

203
per

,
but
in
my
experience
as
a
deputy
,
this

this
draft
Bill
be
a
important
protection
for

but
be
also
very
important
in
combate
Covid

,
as
the
lack
of

encourage
worker
who
be
struggle
financially
to
continue
to

even
if
they
be

.
the
Labour
Party
consider
sick

to
be
a
basic
right
that
worker
in
Ireland
should
have
.
we
be
launch
the
Bill
to
give

the
right
to

.
I
now
turn
to
the
issue
of
parental
leave
.
as
school
have
reopen
,
parent
have
be
in
a
position
to
return
to
work
,
but
the
threat
of
Covid
-
19
remains
.
many
parent
will
be
force
to
take
unpaid
leave
for
the
duration
of
the
school
closure
,
evidence
of
which
we
have
see
already
.
that
who
may
be
struggle
financially
will
find
it
incredibly
difficult
to
cope
if
they
be
force
to
take
unpaid
leave
to
look
after
they
child
.
as
a
extraordinary
measure
,
the
Labour
Party
be
propose
pay
parental
leave
when
a
school
or
preschool
must
close
or
reduce
the
number
of
pupil
who
can
attend
in
order
to
comply
with
government
policy
to
stop
the
spread
of
Covid
-
19
.
in
such
a
case
,
a
employee
who
be
the
parent
or
adoptive
parent
of
a
child
will
be
entitle
to
Covid
-
19
parental
leave
at
full
pay
for
so
long
as
the
child
be
unable
to
attend
the
school
or
preschool
and
the
presence
of
the
employee
be
require
at
home
to
care
for
the
child
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.
2
in
the
name
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
to
the
motion
on
community
safety
and
firework
take
on
Tuesday
,
22
September
2020
.
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
be
make
"
,
a
division
be
claim
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
for
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
issue
of
dual
pricing
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
work
of
we
parliamentary
colleague
,
deputy
Doherty
,
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
have
it
not
be
for
he
foresight
,
I
would
not
be
here
talk
about
it
today
and
we
would
not
be
deal
with
this
as
a
issue
.
we
hear
term
such
as
"
price
walking
"
,
"
price
signalling
"
,
"
dual
pricing
"
and
"
differential
pricing
"
but
it
all
amount
to
the
same
thing
,
namely
,
how
much
more
money
can
be
squeeze
and
screw
out
of
the
consumer
.
it
permeate
the
insurance
industry
and
it
be
self
-
evident
.
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
CCPC
,
be
acknowledge
it
and
the
Central
Bank
be
latently
acknowledge
it
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Finance
,
deputy
Fleming
,
and
I
ask
he
what
the
government
's
response
to
this
will
be
,
give
that
there
be
a
programme
for
government
commitment
on
it
.
if
the
programme
for
government
be
say
we
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
level
playing
field
for
consumer
on
the
price
of
car
insurance
,
for
instance
,
what
be
the
solution
and
what
solution
be
the
government
offering
?
the
Labour
Party
be
of
a
mind
to
support
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
that
be
before
the
House
because
that
be
a
solution
to
this
issue
.
the
Central
Bank
's
response
to
the
issue
of
dual
pricing
do
not
leave
one
inspire
and
I
refer
to
a
article
in
the
Irish
Times
on
9
September
,
which
reference
a
senior
official
in
the
Central
Bank
.
when
this
official
be
question
about
this
issue
,
she
advocate
for
a
:
"
measure
and
proportional
approach
,
base
on
actual
tangible
evidence
"
.
we
have
the
tangible
evidence
.
that
have
be
self
-
evident
since
2015
and
2016
.
the
dog
in
the
street
know
about
this
.
the
official
go
on
to
state
that
the
Central
Bank
be
keen
to
avoid
unintended
consequence
from
any
new
regulation
such
as
the
stifling
of
competition
,
say
:
"
if
you
ban
the
practice
,
it
might
result
in
some
industry
firm
exite
the
market
,
reduce
competition
and
choice
for
consumer
"
.
my
analysis
of
that
response
by
the
Central
Bank
to
this
important
issue
be
one
that
remind
I
of
how
the
Central
Bank
regulate
the
bank
in
the
bad
day
prior
to
the
recession
.
it
seem
to
I
to
be
signal
that
there
be
almost
a
hand
-
off
,
conservative
or
light
-
touch
approach
to
this
issue
and
that
do
not
augur
well
.
we
want
the
Central
Bank
,
the
government
and
this
parliament
to
finally
deal
with
this
issue
to
ensure
there
be
fairness
on
how
people
consume
product
within
the
insurance
industry
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
cartel
-
like
behaviour
be
do
away
with
once
and
for
all
and
that
Ireland
follow
the
model
of
the
UK
on
the
issue
of
dual
pricing
.
the
Minister
of
State
before
we
have
a
stout
record
as
a
advocate
for
the
consumer
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
government
will
take
this
issue
extremely
seriously
and
that
the
Central
Bank
will
not
be
conservative
in
its
approach
to
this
issue
because
everybody
be
watch
it
right
now
to
see
what
way
it
will
move
on
this
issue
.
we
have
already
have
a
signal
from
the
CCPC
on
17
September
on
anti-competitive
co-operation
or
in
other
word
,
cartel
-
like
behaviour
and
the
consumer
be
demand
a
response
.
we
have
cross
a
Rubicon
and
we
need
a
adequate
response
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
but
the
response
do
not
inspire
I
,
to
be
honest
.
if
the
Central
Bank
be
fulfil
its
obligation
as
the
"
watchdog
"
,
it
would
already
have
the
evidence
.
if
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
CCPC
,
tell
we
it
have
investigate
practice
as
far
back
as
2015
and
2016
,
what
be
the
Central
bank
do
in
that
period
?
there
should
already
be
a
book
of
evidence
on
the
matter
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
make
in
respect
of
legislation
but
if
a
legislative
proposal
be
bring
before
the
House
,
we
will
look
seriously
at
it
and
support
it
.
right
now
,
people
look
at
this
matter
be
demand
a
robust
response
by
the
Central
Bank
,
the
government
and
this
Parliament
.
the
idea
that
low
introductory
rate
can
be
offer
to
new
consumer
of
car
insurance
be
not
a
competitive
practice
.
it
be
not
morally
right
if
there
be
a
penalty
apply
to
a
person
who
be
loyal
to
a
particular
company
.
we
know
that
be
happen
.
it
would
not
take
a
trawl
through
million
of
piece
of
datum
to
get
the
require
information
as
there
be
enough
people
in
the
insurance
sector
to
yield
it
.
there
be
enough
of
a
body
of
evidence
from
consumer
and
the
complaint
they
have
make
about
this
issue
and
the
decision
make
against
insurance
company
.
this
come
down
to
the
refusal
to
charge
the
same
price
for
provide
the
same
service
to
exist
and
new
customer
.
it
be
really
a
form
of
pyramid
scheme
that
make
sense
only
in
the
context
of
a
exponentially
expand
customer
base
.
in
other
word
,
it
make
absolutely
no
sense
at
all
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
be
here
this
evening
to
deal
with
this
matter
.
I
fully
appreciate
that
there
be
lot
of
pressure
on
the
Department
of
Health
as
it
be
a
area
on
which
I
have
focus
since
come
into
the
Oireachtas
back
in
2011
.
I
also
thank
all
of
the
Deputy
who
contribute
to
this
debate
.
I
very
much
appreciate
that
and
I
also
thank
my
colleague
,
deputy
Higgins
,
for
she
support
in
work
with
I
on
the
draft
of
this
Bill
.
I
wish
to
advise
the
Minister
of
State
that
I
do
not
go
away
.
this
be
the
third
Bill
that
I
have
instigate
.
I
initiate
a
medical
practitioner
's
(
amendment
)
Bill
relate
to
professional
indemnity
insurance
for
all
doctor
.
when
I
come
into
the
Oireachtas
,
that
be
not
the
law
so
I
introduce
a
private
Member
's
Bill
.
that
be
now
law
,
as
a
result
of
a
government
subsequently
bring
forward
a
Bill
.
the
second
one
be
missing
person
legislation
,
the
Civil
Law
(
Presumption
of
death
)
Bill
which
I
be
tell
could
not
be
do
.
in
fairness
,
I
get
the
then
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
on
board
and
that
be
now
law
.
I
hope
I
will
also
be
able
to
contribute
to
the
implementation
of
legislation
in
this
area
.
my
involvement
with
elderly
care
go
back
too
well
before
I
come
into
this
House
in
that
I
be
involved
in
a
legal
challenge
to
the
Department
of
Health
in
regard
to
the
provision
of
nursing
home
care
,
which
subsequently
,
as
a
result
of
that
legal
challenge
,
change
the
whole
process
of
how
we
provide
nursing
home
care
.
even
though
we
sometimes
think
that
when
we
be
outside
this
House
,
we
cannot
bring
about
change
,
in
fact
,
when
we
can
use
the
court
system
,
we
can
force
the
change
that
be
require
and
force
proper
structure
to
be
set
in
place
.
I
be
delighted
that
,
as
a
result
of
that
legal
challenge
,
proper
structure
be
put
in
place
.
I
believe
it
be
time
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
as
I
say
early
,
this
be
my
third
time
bring
forward
a
Bill
.
while
I
fully
accept
there
be
other
pressure
on
the
Department
,
I
believe
that
as
a
result
of
Covid
,
more
than
anything
else
,
there
be
now
a
urgent
need
to
deal
with
this
whole
area
.
the
figure
I
produce
early
demonstrate
there
will
be
338000
people
aged
over
80
by
2036
,
which
be
only
16
year
away
,
and
1
million
people
aged
over
65
by
2030
.
therefore
,
we
need
a
increase
level
of
home
care
available
because
a
increase
number
will
be
look
for
that
kind
of
support
.
a
lot
of
research
have
be
do
already
.
the
Health
Research
Board
do
work
in
2017
which
look
at
programme
in
Scotland
,
Sweden
,
Germany
and
the
Netherlands
.
quite
a
lot
of
research
have
be
do
in
regard
to
what
be
in
place
in
other
country
,
and
we
should
use
that
without
have
to
go
down
the
road
of
do
further
research
,
give
the
information
be
already
set
out
quite
clearly
.
likewise
,
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
in
2011
be
base
on
a
huge
amount
of
research
which
be
set
out
quite
clearly
on
the
publication
of
that
report
.
the
groundwork
be
done
.
I
have
no
problem
work
with
the
Minister
of
State
to
amend
anything
need
to
deal
with
this
area
,
but
I
believe
it
be
important
that
we
have
the
regulation
in
place
.
we
do
not
give
enough
recognition
to
informal
carer
,
although
I
know
we
do
not
need
legislation
for
they
.
the
last
CSO
figure
show
there
be
195000
people
provide
informal
care
in
they
own
home
.
we
need
to
acknowledge
the
work
they
be
do
and
how
they
be
care
for
someone
in
they
home
.
they
be
do
this
not
for
two
or
three
hour
per
day
,
not
for
two
or
three
day
a
week
,
not
for
two
or
three
week
a
year
,
but
24
-
7
,
365
day
of
the
year
.
we
need
to
acknowledge
they
contribution
and
the
work
they
be
do
.
it
be
also
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
work
provide
by
carer
employ
either
by
the
HSE
or
the
private
company
.
while
we
might
be
critical
of
some
of
the
private
company
,
they
be
provide
a
service
where
the
statutory
agency
be
not
able
to
provide
it
.
in
draft
legislation
,
we
need
to
make
sure
we
cover
all
the
angle
,
whether
the
service
be
provide
by
the
HSE
or
other
State
agency
,
or
by
private
company
.
I
be
determined
that
we
will
have
legislation
in
this
area
before
this
dáil
be
dissolve
.
this
be
crucial
for
the
people
who
want
care
but
we
must
also
make
sure
that
the
appropriate
level
of
care
be
provide
.
come
from
a
legal
background
,
one
of
the
thing
that
concern
I
,
and
one
of
my
colleague
refer
to
this
during
the
debate
,
be
the
abuse
of
elderly
people
.
I
have
see
it
.
we
need
to
make
sure
we
have
all
of
the
process
and
procedure
in
place
so
this
can
be
easily
bring
under
control
without
someone
suffer
any
loss
.
it
be
extremely
important
that
we
provide
that
.
there
be
a
number
of
report
recently
in
the
newspaper
,
and
the
Irish
Mail
on
Sunday
recently
have
a
very
disturbing
story
in
regard
to
a
person
with
a
disability
who
be
provide
with
care
but
that
care
fall
totally
short
of
what
the
person
want
,
and
it
be
clear
there
be
also
abuse
.
it
be
important
,
where
member
of
the
general
public
be
concerned
in
any
way
about
the
care
be
provide
,
that
they
bring
that
information
to
the
relevant
authority
and
make
they
aware
of
it
.
we
all
have
a
part
to
play
.
there
be
no
point
say
,
''
that
be
someone
else
's
problem
,
not
mine
.
''
it
be
we
problem
.
it
be
important
that
we
make
sure
we
elderly
be
protect
at
all
stage
in
regard
to
financial
matter
and
in
regard
to
they
care
,
upkeep
and
healthcare
.
we
need
to
move
forward
with
this
legislation
.
I
fully
accept
the
Minister
of
State
require
time
and
I
look
forward
to
work
with
she
.
I
want
to
make
a
contribution
to
this
in
the
same
way
I
have
make
a
contribution
to
the
other
legislation
I
have
be
involve
in
.
I
hope
that
,
by
this
time
next
year
,
we
will
have
a
clear
programme
in
place
for
the
legislation
to
go
through
and
be
enact
,
and
to
have
it
fully
operational
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
be
here
this
evening
to
deal
with
this
matter
.
I
fully
appreciate
that
there
be
lot
of
pressure
on
the
Department
of
Health
as
it
be
a
area
on
which
I
have
focus
since
come
into
the
Oireachtas
back
in
2011
.
I
also
thank
all
of
the
Deputy
who
contribute
to
this
debate
.
I
very
much
appreciate
that
and
I
also
thank
my
colleague
,
deputy
Higgins
,
for
she
support
in
work
with
I
on
the
draft
of
this
Bill
.
I
wish
to
advise
the
Minister
of
State
that
I
do
not
go
away
.
this
be
the
third
Bill
that
I
have
instigate
.
I
initiate
a
medical
practitioner
's
(
amendment
)
Bill
relate
to
professional
indemnity
insurance
for
all
doctor
.
when
I
come
into
the
Oireachtas
,
that
be
not
the
law
so
I
introduce
a
private
Member
's
Bill
.
that
be
now
law
,
as
a
result
of
a
government
subsequently
bring
forward
a
Bill
.
the
second
one
be
missing
person
legislation
,
the
Civil
Law
(
Presumption
of
death
)
Bill
which
I
be
tell
could
not
be
do
.
in
fairness
,
I
get
the
then
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
on
board
and
that
be
now
law
.
I
hope
I
will
also
be
able
to
contribute
to
the
implementation
of
legislation
in
this
area
.
my
involvement
with
elderly
care
go
back
too
well
before
I
come
into
this
House
in
that
I
be
involved
in
a
legal
challenge
to
the
Department
of
Health
in
regard
to
the
provision
of
nursing
home
care
,
which
subsequently
,
as
a
result
of
that
legal
challenge
,
change
the
whole
process
of
how
we
provide
nursing
home
care
.
even
though
we
sometimes
think
that
when
we
be
outside
this
House
,
we
cannot
bring
about
change
,
in
fact
,
when
we
can
use
the
court
system
,
we
can
force
the
change
that
be
require
and
force
proper
structure
to
be
set
in
place
.
I
be
delighted
that
,
as
a
result
of
that
legal
challenge
,
proper
structure
be
put
in
place
.
I
believe
it
be
time
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
as
I
say
early
,
this
be
my
third
time
bring
forward
a
Bill
.
while
I
fully
accept
there
be
other
pressure
on
the
Department
,
I
believe
that
as
a
result
of
Covid
,
more
than
anything
else
,
there
be
now
a
urgent
need
to
deal
with
this
whole
area
.
the
figure
I
produce
early
demonstrate
there
will
be
338000
people
aged
over
80
by
2036
,
which
be
only
16
year
away
,
and
1
million
people
aged
over
65
by
2030
.
therefore
,
we
need
a
increase
level
of
home
care
available
because
a
increase
number
will
be
look
for
that
kind
of
support
.
a
lot
of
research
have
be
do
already
.
the
Health
Research
Board
do
work
in
2017
which
look
at
programme
in
Scotland
,
Sweden
,
Germany
and
the
Netherlands
.
quite
a
lot
of
research
have
be
do
in
regard
to
what
be
in
place
in
other
country
,
and
we
should
use
that
without
have
to
go
down
the
road
of
do
further
research
,
give
the
information
be
already
set
out
quite
clearly
.
likewise
,
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
in
2011
be
base
on
a
huge
amount
of
research
which
be
set
out
quite
clearly
on
the
publication
of
that
report
.
the
groundwork
be
done
.
I
have
no
problem
work
with
the
Minister
of
State
to
amend
anything
need
to
deal
with
this
area
,
but
I
believe
it
be
important
that
we
have
the
regulation
in
place
.
we
do
not
give
enough
recognition
to
informal
carer
,
although
I
know
we
do
not
need
legislation
for
they
.
the
last
CSO
figure
show
there
be
195000
people
provide
informal
care
in
they
own
home
.
we
need
to
acknowledge
the
work
they
be
do
and
how
they
be
care
for
someone
in
they
home
.
they
be
do
this
not
for
two
or
three
hour
per
day
,
not
for
two
or
three
day
a
week
,
not
for
two
or
three
week
a
year
,
but
24
-
7
,
365
day
of
the
year
.
we
need
to
acknowledge
they
contribution
and
the
work
they
be
do
.
it
be
also
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
work
provide
by
carer
employ
either
by
the
HSE
or
the
private
company
.
while
we
might
be
critical
of
some
of
the
private
company
,
they
be
provide
a
service
where
the
statutory
agency
be
not
able
to
provide
it
.
in
draft
legislation
,
we
need
to
make
sure
we
cover
all
the
angle
,
whether
the
service
be
provide
by
the
HSE
or
other
State
agency
,
or
by
private
company
.
I
be
determined
that
we
will
have
legislation
in
this
area
before
this
dáil
be
dissolve
.
this
be
crucial
for
the
people
who
want
care
but
we
must
also
make
sure
that
the
appropriate
level
of
care
be
provide
.
come
from
a
legal
background
,
one
of
the
thing
that
concern
I
,
and
one
of
my
colleague
refer
to
this
during
the
debate
,
be
the
abuse
of
elderly
people
.
I
have
see
it
.
we
need
to
make
sure
we
have
all
of
the
process
and
procedure
in
place
so
this
can
be
easily
bring
under
control
without
someone
suffer
any
loss
.
it
be
extremely
important
that
we
provide
that
.
there
be
a
number
of
report
recently
in
the
newspaper
,
and
the
Irish
Mail
on
Sunday
recently
have
a
very
disturbing
story
in
regard
to
a
person
with
a
disability
who
be
provide
with
care
but
that
care
fall
totally
short
of
what
the
person
want
,
and
it
be
clear
there
be
also
abuse
.
it
be
important
,
where
member
of
the
general
public
be
concerned
in
any
way
about
the
care
be
provide
,
that
they
bring
that
information
to
the
relevant
authority
and
make
they
aware
of
it
.
we
all
have
a
part
to
play
.
there
be
no
point
say
,
''
that
be
someone
else
's
problem
,
not
mine
.
''
it
be
we
problem
.
it
be
important
that
we
make
sure
we
elderly
be
protect
at
all
stage
in
regard
to
financial
matter
and
in
regard
to
they
care
,
upkeep
and
healthcare
.
we
need
to
move
forward
with
this
legislation
.
I
fully
accept
the
Minister
of
State
require
time
and
I
look
forward
to
work
with
she
.
I
want
to
make
a
contribution
to
this
in
the
same
way
I
have
make
a
contribution
to
the
other
legislation
I
have
be
involve
in
.
I
hope
that
,
by
this
time
next
year
,
we
will
have
a
clear
programme
in
place
for
the
legislation
to
go
through
and
be
enact
,
and
to
have
it
fully
operational
.
I
will
have
conclude
by
then
,
le

Míle
Fuíochas
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
rise
to
support
the
Bill
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
,
Senator
Hackett
,
and
the
minister
,
deputy
McConalogue
,
and
I
congratulate
they
on
they
appointment
.
the
issue
be
well
articulate
.
my
colleague
,
Senator
Annie
Hoey
,
articulate
the
Labour
Party
position
in
the
Seanad
.
while
the
legislation
be
necessary
,
it
give
rise
to
many
question
,
one
of
which
be
forestry
policy
in
its
totality
.
the
Labour
Party
be
not
convinced
that
this
Bill
alone
be
the
answer
or
the
panacea
to
the
problem
that
exist
within
the
forestry
sector
at
present
.
I
believe
the
minister
and
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
there
be
problem
inherent
with
the
process
.
we
need
to
have
this
issue
rectify
if
we
be
serious
about
ensure
we
have
a
seamless
,
fit
-
for
-
purpose
forestry
sector
that
recognise
the
challenge
of
afforestation
and
increase
beyond
11
%
the
rate
of
cover
.
we
must
also
recognise
that
the
process
of
apply
for
licence
be
clearly
not
fit
for
purpose
.
we
need
to
investigate
further
after
this
legislation
be
pass
,
and
presumably
it
will
,
why
the
process
be
not
work
.
we
be
all
aware
,
across
the
party
divide
in
the
House
,
that
it
be
not
fit
for
purpose
currently
.
I
ask
that
a
lot
of
energy
be
give
to
ensure
that
once
the
Bill
pass
,
there
be
a
root
and
branch
review
of
policy
in
general
so
the
requisite
staff
be
appoint
and
the
requisite
whole
-
time
equivalent
be
appoint
.
we
be
tell
that
additional
staff
be
be
appoint
within
the
forestry
service
but
we
do
not
have
a
clear
number
of
staff
and
the
type
of
staff
that
be
be
appoint
.
much
of
the
work
could
be
do
internally
on
the
licence
screen
process
,
with
regard
to
triage
of
application
and
in
the
assessment
of
the
ecological
or
environmental
impact
element
,
without
diminish
the
right
of
anybody
to
appeal
.
there
be
much
in
this
legislation
that
give
voice
to
regulation
that
will
have
to
come
into
force
after
the
Bill
have
pass
.
the
Labour
Party
be
worried
about
the
number
of
regulation
,
as
articulate
in
the
propose
new
section
14e
.
I
would
dearly
love
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
specifically
to
the
point
I
be
about
to
make
.
I
note
that
she
official
be
present

section
14e
provide
for
14
regulation
that
must
come
into
force
.
for
this
legislation
to
be
take
seriously
,
the
question
that
arise
be
when
this
will
happen
.
what
be
the
timeframe
for
bring
that
regulation
into
force
once
the
legislation
have
pass
?
accord
to
the
propose
new
section
14e
(
1
)
:
without
prejudice
to
the
generality
of
section
7
(
2
)
and
15
,
for
the
purpose
of
the
conduct
of
appeal
,
and
have
regard
to
the
need
for
efficiency
in
the
system
of
appeal
,
the
minister
may
make
regulation
to
provide
for
all
or
any
of
the
follow
:
the
section
go
on
to
list
potential
area
of
regulation
in
subsection
(
a
)
through
to
(
n
)
,
provide
,
inter
alia
,
for
"
time
limit
to
apply
to
the
making
and
conduct
of
appeal
"
;
"
the
constitution
of
division
of
the
Forestry
appeal
Committee
and
the
assignment
of
appeal
to
that
division
"
;
and
"
the
form
and
manner
of
make
of
request
by
the
Forestry
appeal
Committee
for
information
from
a
party
to
a
appeal
,
or
a
person
other
than
a
party
"
.
if
we
do
not
have
sight
right
now
of
the
timeframe
,
it
could
be
argue
that
notwithstand
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
and
Minister
of
State
present
in
the
Chamber
in
seek
to
have
this
issue
address
,
there
be
a
danger
that
if
that
timeframe
slip
and
be
not
tight
there
will
be
no
systemic
change
in
this
process
,
notwithstand
the
subdivision
of
the
fac
,
and
there
could
be
as
many
delay
in
the
licensing
process
in
the
future
as
there
be
now
.
if
we
have
some
sight
of
how
the
minister
will
deal
with
this
regulation
and
when
they
will
be
put
into
force
,
that
will
give
great
confidence
to
the
forestry
sector
and
would
allay
some
of
the
fear
of
people
in
the
forestry
sector
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
that
issue
in
response
to
the
second
stage
debate
.
we
talk
about
afforestation
policy
and
there
be
programme
for
government
commitment
,
but
we
be
seriously
lag
behind
.
I
be
not
try
to
make
a
party
political
point
on
this
because
we
all
agree
on
afforestation
in
this
House
.
we
want
to
see
clear
target
and
we
want
that
target
to
be
meet
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
the
minister
with
responsibility
for
biodiversity
will
set
out
a
pathway
for
that
afforestation
target
to
be
meet
,
and
that
we
achieve
target
great
than
8,000
in
2021
to
offset
the
miss
target
in
2020
,
2019
,
2018
,
2017
and
2016
.
Ireland
be
abysmally
behind
the
curve
,
and
I
say
this
in
a
spirit
of
co-operation
.
this
minister
and
the
government
have
a
opportunity
now
really
to
hammer
home
the
idea
that
Ireland
need
to
nudge
well
past
the
11
%
.
that
be
something
the
government
would
get
support
for
,
but
only
on
the
basis
that
it
be
not
just
blanket
cover
but
a
afforestation
policy
that
ensure
that
biodiversity
be
not
damage
in
any
way
.
I
be
state
the
obvious
as
far
as
the
Minister
of
State
be
concerned
.
the
issue
of
afforestation
and
forestry
policy
need
to
have
a
radical
basis
now
.
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
in
the
last
dáil
publish
a
report
contain
clear
target
which
have
cross
-party
support
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
find
that
if
she
be
radical
in
she
approach
to
this
,
she
will
have
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
Member
of
this
House
.
on
the
issue
of
fee
I
would
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
consider
the
impact
of
levy
a
fee
.
the
minister
,
arguably
,
be
silent
on
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
the
fee
.
it
be
another
issue
that
will
be
give
over
to
regulation
or
statutory
instrument
.
what
people
want
be
certainty
with
this
legislation
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
of
a
mind
to
instigate
a
fee
-
and
it
seem
from
she
speech
that
she
be
absolutely
clear
on
the
need
for
a
fee
-
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
ordinary
people
,
such
as
that
for
whom
deputy
Martin
Kenny
speak
in
place
like
Leitrim
,
be
lock
out
of
a
process
.
ordinary
people
cannot
be
lock
out
of
the
process
by
dint
of
the
fact
that
there
be
a
fee
put
in
they
way
that
arguably
diminish
they
right
to
make
a
genuine
submission
to
a
appeal
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
revisit
that
issue
.
I
repeat
the
point
make
early
on
the
number
and
type
of
staff
be
appoint
at
present
.
how
many
people
have
be
appoint
in
the
past
number
of
month
since
the
government
be
form
and
across
what
position
?
what
be
the
proposal
to
appoint
new
people
in
the
forestry
service
?
again
,
I
reiterate
the
point
that
the
Oireachtas
Committee
on
Agriculture
must
come
together
and
work
with
the
minister
and
Minister
of
State
to
shine
a
light
into
how
the
forestry
service
operate
and
unlock
any
of
the
impediment
to
the
granting
of
licence
in
a
way
that
balance
the
need
of
industry
with
ensure
that
the
ecology
and
the
environment
be
not
damage
or
put
upon
in
any
way
.
the
committee
must
give
a
voice
to
all
of
the
stakeholder
and
contextualise
the
more
9000
submission
in
public
.
if
we
be
to
agree
a
position
on
the
working
of
the
forestry
service
,
we
must
have
a
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing
or
some
public
articulation
and
give
further
voice
,
after
this
legislation
be
pass
,
to
how
we
feel
the
forestry
service
need
to
operate
.
we
must
hear
from
independent
and
other
within
the
sector
as
to
how
they
feel
the
forestry
service
should
operate
.
I
be
talk
about
the
stakeholder
within
the
industry
who
be
affect
by
the
decision
of
the
forestry
service
day
in
,
day
out
.
I
also
wish
to
give
voice
to
the
frustration
of
people
,
some
of
whom
will
also
have
contact
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
know
of
one
forestry
application
that
be
823
day
in
the
system
with
no
decision
.
I
have
learn
of
other
application
that
be
681
day
,
713
day
and
520
day
in
the
system
with
no
decision
.
it
be
unconscionable
for
any
modern
public
or
civil
service
to
take
that
long
to
process
a
application
or
a
appeal
.
it
beggar
belief
.
I
know
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
conscious
of
this
problem
but
we
need
to
get
to
a
stage
where
this
be
no
long
happen
and
the
soon
,
the
good
.
I
do
not
wish
to
tarry
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
the
issue
.
I
have
ask
very
specific
question
and
hope
that
they
will
be
answer
when
the
minister
of
State
respond
at
the
end
of
this
second
stage
debate
.
the
Labour
Party
be
generally
supportive
of
the
Bill
but
there
must
be
a
root
and
branch
review
of
how
the
forestry
service
operate
when
all
of
this
be
over
.
that
need
to
happen
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
apologise
for
be
late
.
the
record
of
the
House
already
show
that
Fianna
Fáil
have
quite
a
strident
position
on
this
when
in
opposition
.
without
reprise
all
the
issue
here
tonight
,
which
be
unnecessary
,
I
hope
that
there
will
be
consistency
in
the
approach
it
take
now
.
I
hope
Fianna
Fáil
will
be
consistent
with
its
approach
in
opposition
.
I
just
want
to
put
that
on
the
record
.
hopefully
not
,
but
it
be
happen
in
the
private
sector
.
I
have
only
find
it
to
be
a
frustrating
experience
.
when
people
interact
with
public
service
and
public
body
they
should
interact
with
a
individual
where
possible
,
include
through
the
use
of
email
and
phone
.
that
new
strategy
be
very
important
.
it
be
great
to
see
a
new
minister
of
State
who
be
able
to
take
charge
and
drive
that
strategy
,
because
in
small
way
it
have
a
big
impact
on
lot
of
people
throughout
the
country
.

the
Labour
Party
and
I
wholeheartedly
support
this
excellent
motion
and
the
recommendation
therein
.
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
recently
publish
a
special
report
,
combate
Child
Poverty
-
good
targeting
of
commission
support
.
Mr.
Tony
Murphy
,
the
Irish
member
of
the
court
,
be
clear
in
he
messaging
about
the
European
Union
's
response
to
eliminate
child
poverty
.
he
state
:
child
poverty
be
a
serious
issue
in
the
EU
.
without
a
sustained
and
target
action
,
the
current
unacceptable
level
be
unlikely
to
decrease
.
it
be
become
more
critical
because
of
the
expect
impact
of
the
pandemic
.
that
be
stark
word
and
bear
close
scrutiny
.
the
report
state
:
EU
legislation
do
not
target
funding
directly
at
combate
child
poverty
.
both
the
Commission
and
the
Member
State
visit
could
not
quantify
the
amount
of
fund
allocate
to
project
directly
tackle
child
poverty
and
therefore
could
not
assess
they
effectiveness
.
by
any
standard
,
that
be
a
damning
indictment
of
we
,
as
a
country
,
and
successive
government
,
include
the
one
of
which
I
be
a
part
.
we
now
need
radical
action
to
ensure
that
this
issue
be
address
.
there
be
presentation
during
the
week
by
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
and
the
Society
of
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
.
the
central
message
from
Mr.
Murphy
,
the
Irish
member
of
the
court
,
be
that
because
EU
instrument
target
at
eliminate
child
poverty
be
not
legally
bind
,
it
have
become
difficult
to
measure
the
true
impact
of
measure
intend
to
eliminate
child
poverty
.
the
EU
target
of
remove
20
million
citizen
from
poverty
have
no
sub-target
for
child
and
no
adjust
target
have
be
set
even
though
it
have
be
clear
for
some
time
that
this
objective
will
not
be
meet
.
Mr.
Murphy
's
critique
,
if
I
can
use
that
word
,
be
not
just
of
the
commission
for
fail
to
pressure
member
state
,
but
of
member
state
themselves
for
be
deliberately
obtuse
in
draft
policy
,
interpret
directive
and
report
result
.
Ms
Karen
Kiernan
,
chief
executive
officer
of
one
Family
,
bear
that
out
when
she
say
that
be
she
experience
and
that
it
apply
to
Ireland
.
the
policy
discussion
during
the
Society
of
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
presentation
include
policymaker
from
New
Zealand
,
Ireland
and
Scotland
.
they
discuss
how
good
to
respond
to
child
poverty
in
a
increasingly
uncertain
economic
landscape
.
Ms
Kristie
Carter
,
director
of
the
child
poverty
unit
in
New
Zealand
,
speak
about
the
child
poverty
unit
in
Prime
Minister
Jacinda
Ardern
's
department
.
the
Prime
Minister
have
a
child
poverty
unit
within
she
department
.
that
be
the
level
of
importance
that
be
ascribe
to
this
issue
in
New
Zealand
.
we
can
learn
from
that
.
I
note
that
the
minister
with
responsibility
for
child
be
here
today
and
I
accept
he
bona
fide
but
the
example
of
New
Zealand
show
what
can
be
do
when
political
parentage
,
if
you
will
,
be
give
to
this
issue
such
that
it
be
elevate
to
the
equivalent
level
of
the
Department
of
the
Taoiseach
.
that
be
when
one
start
see
real
action
because
that
be
when
resource
be
make
available
.
policymaker
,
people
who
be
charge
with
implement
policy
,
and
stakeholder
can
then
see
real
result
from
the
effort
to
eliminate
child
poverty
.
Ms
Carter
highlight
that
the
creation
of
the
child
poverty
unit
be
crucially
accompany
by
cut
red
tape
for
non-governmental
organisation
,
ngo
,
as
well
as
increase
funding
.
the
logic
be
simply
that
if
this
be
not
make
a
priority
,
target
would
be
miss
.
that
sum
up
the
Irish
scenario
on
the
issue
.
it
seem
reasonable
to
request
then
that
in
addition
to
report
,
measure
and
set
target
,
the
government
provide
the
necessary
funding
as
happen
in
New
Zealand
.
we
endorse
the
setting
of
legislative
target
because
we
feel
strongly
it
would
guarantee
accountability
.
where
there
be
nebulous
target
,
there
be
nebulous
policy
-
making
.
where
people
must
account
for
themselves
and
they
action
,
one
start
to
see
real
result
.
the
two
event
that
take
place
this
week
be
,
arguably
,
very
prescient
because
they
deal
directly
with
the
substance
of
the
motion
before
we
today
.
we
be
here
again
in
the
dáil
talk
about
this
issue
,
and
there
be
a
working
out
of
this
issue
when
we
talk
about
child
poverty
.
all
member
of
the
Oireachtas
have
countless
example
of
constituent
who
be
suffer
because
of
a
lack
of
proper
income
but
also
because
,
increasingly
,
child
do
not
have
access
to
the
basic
service
they
require
.
from
a
answer
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
this
week
on
access
for
child
and
the
number
of
child
wait
for
occupational
therapy
through
the
HSE
,
I
learn
there
be
now
21000
child
who
have
be
wait
for
up
to
one
year
.
I
have
state
before
in
this
House
that
there
be
something
illogical
about
the
fact
that
occupational
therapist
,
front
-
line
worker
,
be
be
deploy
to
do
testing
,
swabbing
and
trace
when
any
reasonable
non-medical
person
could
be
train
to
do
so
.
the
net
effect
of
the
loss
of
a
occupational
therapy
service
be
that
child
,
by
and
large
,
suffer
.
we
need
to
start
produce
logical
public
policy
,
particularly
health
policy
,
in
respect
of
child
.
the
lack
of
such
policy
lead
to
great
impoverishment
.
I
use
the
term
"
impoverishment
"
broadly
.
we
support
the
motion
.
I
will
not
be
give
a
rendition
of
"
Rivers
of
Babylon
"
or
treat
the
House
to
a
treatise
on
Mesopotamia
.
I
stand
here
to
support
the
amendment
,
which
be
quite
logical
and
practical
.
we
be
about
be
practical
this
evening
in
how
the
forestry
appeal
service
could
operate
.
I
will
refer
briefly
to
the
Mackinnon
report
,
which
be
the
template
for
many
of
we
now
.
in
wrap
up
she
second
stage
speech
,
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
it
and
the
appointment
of
a
independent
chairperson
.
in
support
of
the
amendment
I
will
speak
very
briefly
to
the
observation
make
on
page
eight
of
that
report
.
I
be
sure
many
member
,
include
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
,
will
have
a
copy
of
the
report
before
he
.
paragraph
22
state
"
the
perception
among
[
register
forester
]
and
landowner
be
that
,
where
a
appeal
be
lodge
,
it
be
likely
to
be
a
further
12
month
before
a
decision
be
issue
.
"
tonight
,
we
be
look
to
tidy
the
process
up
to
be
helpful
to
the
Minister
of
State
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
accept
this
reasonable
and
practical
amendment
,
it
would
give
ample
time
for
staff
to
process
application
and
go
through
a
appeal
process
,
give
that
14
ecologist
have
now
be
appoint
.
this
would
ensure
we
can
sustain
community
throughout
this
land
.
from
the
fellow
drive
the
digger
to
open
the
road
to
the
fellow
planting
the
forestry
to
the
person
who
thin
it
,
everybody
would
have
a
fighting
chance
.
right
now
,
that
fighting
chance
be
not
there
and
will
not
be
until
we
see
this
legislation
pass
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
consideration
to
the
amendment
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
the
motion
regard
child
poverty
.
on
Wednesday
,
30

I
express
we
sadness
at
the
passing
of
Dr.
Martin
O'Donnell
of
Charleville
,
father
of
deputy
Kieran
O'Donnell
,
we
colleague
in
the
House
.
Dr.
O'Donnell
be
one
of
the
founder
of
the
Charleville
and
District
mentally
handicapped
Children
's
Association
,
which
be
the
forerunner
of
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
as
we
know
it
today
.
I
be
particularly
hearten
to
hear
the
Minister
of
State
tonight
mention
Cooleens
House
and
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
I
take
some
solace
from
she
speech
that
she
be
very
much
aware
of
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
and
its
work
,
thanks
in
no
small
part
to
the
late
Dr.
Martin
O'Donnell
and
he
team
.
a
lovely
article
in
the
Limerick
Leader
today
contain
a
quote
from
a
local
who
say
that
the
late
Dr.
O'Donnell
bring
child
out
of
the
attic
in
1968
.
we
be
still
here
tonight
discuss
this
issue
,
which
may
be
a
indictment
on
all
of
we
.
there
have
never
be
a
great
consciousness
around
this
issue
and
around
ensure
we
can
advocate
for
people
and
continue
in
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
be
truly
respect
,
who
have
great
passion
and
compassion
for
the
people
he
serve
as
a
gp
.
the
article
speak
of
the
50th
anniversary
celebration
of
St.
Joseph's
Foundation
where
it
be
say
that
he
remember
Dr.
O'Donnell
say
the
highlight
of
he
career
work
with
that
with
special
need
be
when
it
be
recognise
they
could
get
they
first
holy
communion
.
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
then
but
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
I
recognise
the
minister
of
State
's
integrity
.
I
note
that
deputy
Michael
Moynihan
,
who
will
chair
the
disability
committee
,
be
also
present
.
we
can
do
good
work
and
we
be
already
see
a
evidence
base
for
a
increase
in
resource
.
that
be
plain
for
everybody
to
see
.
this
be
a
non-partisan
issue
.
if
we
can
continue
in
the
vein
of
people
such
as
Dr.
O'Donnell
,
we
will
do
some
good
work
.
I
be
particularly
heartened
that
the
Minister
of
State
mention
Cooleens
House
.
that
be
evidence
she
be
across
that
specific
issue
in
north
Cork
and
be
cognisant
of
the
impact
of
the
loss
of
respite
care
and
the
effect
it
be
have
on
,
for
instance
,
the
33
people
who
use
it
in
the
context
of
Cooleens
House
.
I
pay
tribute
to
Dr.
O'Donnell
and
he
family
,
to
Mrs.
O'Donnell
and
they
five
child
and
offer
condolence
to
we
colleague
,
deputy
Kieran
O'Donnell
,
on
he
loss
.
as
I
have
say
,
if
we
have
this
debate
last
June
people
would
have
predict
that
in
July
Prime
Minister
Netanyahu
would
have
move
ahead
with
annexation
of
part
of
the
West
Bank
,
and
possibly
even
the
Jordan
Valley
.
that
do
not
happen
because
of
international
pressure
.
the
perception
be
that
Israel
have
be
give
the
green
light
to
do
that
and
it
do
not
.
it
be
talk
out
of
do
so
by
powerful
ally
of
Israel
but
also
by
very
direct
messaging
from
the
European
Union
,
in
which
Ireland
be
very
much
involved
in
the
debate
on
the
Middle
East
peace
process
at
that
stage
within
the
foreign
affair
Council
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
that
in
many
instance
Israel
act
with
impunity
.
it
continue
to
impinge
on
Palestinian
land
and
Palestinian
rights
in
a
way
that
be
illegal
.
we
have
to
continue
to
highlight
that
and
maintain
pressure
but
we
also
have
to
talk
to
Israel
and
maintain
a
relationship
that
can
result
in
a
negotiate
outcome
at
some
point
in
the
future
.
it
will
not
be
resolve
by
protest
alone
.
I
seek
clarity
on
a
point
of
order
.
I
think
-----
the
deputy
be
well
use
to
interrupt
in
this
house
when
need
be
.
I
be
ask
for
clarity
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
should
not
shout
into
the
microphone
.
he
should
have
a
little
bit
of
decorum
.
may
I
just
have
a
moment
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
time
?
I
think
the
order
of
speaker
go
from
the
government
to
Sinn
Féin
and
then
to
the
Labour
Party
.
I
seek
clarification
on
that
.
i-----
I
seek
clarification
from
the
Whip
's
office
last
night
on
the
ordering
of
business
for
private
Member
's
time
and
receive
it
at
about
9
o'clock
.
I
receive
a
email
to
the
effect
that
the
order
go
from
the
government
,
back
to
Sinn
Féin
and
then
to
the
other
Opposition
party
.
that
order
seem
to
have
be
disrupt
.
I
want
to
speak
in
favour
of
the
motion
and
to
speak
specifically
about
the
cohort
of
worker
who
be
in
receipt
of
the
payment
of
€300
per
week
.
as
we
be
in
a
level
3
lockdown
,
the
inevitable
consequence
be
that
thousand
more
people
will
lose
they
job
.
the
minister
be
tell
we
that
approximately
129500
people
be
in
receipt
of
the
€300
rate
and
that
this
represent
60
%
of
the
prior
average
income
for
this
group
of
worker
.
that
be
the
same
cohort
of
worker
who
will
feel
the
brunt
of
this
lockdown
,
however
,
because
they
work
in
bar
,
restaurant
,
tourism
and
hospitality
.
a
lot
of
they
be
on
modest
income
but
a
significant
proportion
of
they
be
single
income
household
with
family
who
be
earn
anywhere
between
€
50000
and
€
80000
per
year
,
depend
on
where
they
work
.
the
minister
's
suggestion
that
there
be
a
jobseeker
's
payment
that
this
people
can
move
to
and
that
that
of
they
who
have
dependant
will
benefit
on
a
pro
rata
basis
by
apply
for
a
jobseeker
's
payment
do
not
give
we
a
real
picture
of
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
income
on
that
cohort
.
we
do
not
know
how
long
the
lockdown
will
last
.
even
if
it
end
tomorrow
,
there
would
still
be
a
lag
effect
before
the
relevant
sector
return
.
the
case
in
point
,
which
all
of
we
have
articulate
,
be
the
entertainment
sector
.
approximately
31000
people
in
the
sector
have
be
seriously
affect
by
this
cut
and
would
probably
find
themselves
in
that
cohort
.
even
if
we
take
at
face
value
what
the
minister
say
on
the
payment
of
€
250
and
the
€
203
,
although
I
do
not
fully
accept
she
argument
that
this
people
be
bad
off
on
a
net
basis
,
I
still
believe
she
have
to
look
at
that
who
be
on
the
payment
of
€300
a
week
because
they
include
people
with
mortgage
and
many
single
income
household
with
family
.
even
when
this
people
move
to
a
jobseeker
's
payment
or
other
such
payment
they
will
be
net
loser
.
this
be
the
same
people
who
will
have
a
obligation
to
pay
they
mortgage
.
if
the
boiler
break
or
a
tyre
change
be
need
on
they
car
,
the
marginal
effect
of
have
to
make
this
payment
be
much
more
adverse
on
family
in
that
cohort
.
in
the
context
of
budget
discussion
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
revise
the
government
's
position
on
that
group
of
worker
.
as
we
speak
,
that
cohort
of
worker
be
not
get
any
break
from
the
bank
,
as
have
be
articulate
already
by
the
proposer
and
supporter
of
the
motion
.
if
they
fall
behind
on
mortgage
payment
,
I
do
not
need
to
tell
the
minister
the
consequence
this
would
have
for
that
family
.
I
ask
that
she
take
on
board
the
plea
be
make
on
behalf
of
that
cohort
of
worker
.
they
be
the
people
who
go
out
to
work
every
day
and
keep
the
economy
go
.
they
have
lose
they
job
through
no
fault
of
they
own
.
since
12
March
,
some
of
they
,
for
example
,
that
in
the
entertainment
sector
,
will
not
be
able
to
go
into
a
Intreo
office
and
say
they
can
now
go
carry
a
hod
up
a
ladder
on
a
building
site
.
they
simply
do
not
have
the
ability
to
pivot
into
or
find
work
in
other
sector
.
this
be
the
variable
or
factor
that
be
not
be
take
into
account
.
as
a
deputy
,
I
have
a
excellent
working
relationship
with
official
of
the
Department
of
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
when
act
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
.
that
official
show
professionalism
par
excellence
when
deal
with
representation
I
make
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
.
the
Minster
,
however
,
have
a
problem
with
Intreo
.
the
time
lag
,
machinery
and
obstacle
that
apply
to
people
in
that
cohort
need
to
be
sort
out
.
they
include
the
revision
of
form
and
the
seek
of
further
information
when
a
person
transition
from
the
Covid
payment
to
a
jobseeker
's
payment
.
it
cause
major
stress
for
family
.
on
balance
,
we
would
be
good
off
if
,
for
this
very
uncertain
period
,
the
€350
payment
be
restore
or
review
.
that
would
give
people
some
headroom
to
meet
any
overhead
they
have
while
society
be
go
through
this
turmoil
.
we
have
not
see
the
time
lag
effect
of
the
lockdown
that
be
announce
this
week
.
it
will
have
the
effect
of
push
more
people
into
the
Covid
payment
bracket
.
the
government
need
to
revise
its
position
in
respect
of
the
cohort
of
people
on
the
€300
payment
.
this
people
be
in
entertainment
and
the
tourism
and
allied
sector
.
they
have
massive
overhead
.
they
have
child
of
schoolgoing
age
and
car
loan
and
we
need
to
look
after
they
.
when
the
economy
come
back
again
they
will
jump
back
into
work
but
we
can
not
put
they
into
poverty
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
try
to
make
to
the
minister
.
they
can
not
be
reduce
to
poverty
.
we
need
a
social
floor
,
a
protection
below
which
they
will
not
fall
.
I
ask
the
minister
again
to
please
consider
the
cohort
within
the
€300
bracket
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.

under
the
aviation
section
of
the
programme
for
government
,
there
be
a
clear
commitment
to
deliver
the
capital
programme
require
to
support
service
and
ensure
safety
at
State
and
regional
airport
.
I
be
speak
specifically
in
respect
of
Cork
Airport
,
with
which
the
Tánaiste
be
familiar
.
the
chief
executive
officer
of
Dublin
Airport
Authority
,
DAA
,
be
in
Leinster
House
yesterday
and
he
state
that
Cork
have
receive
no
direct
funding
.
I
be
merely
ask
now
if
Cork
Airport
will
be
able
to
access
regional
airport
operating
expenditure
and
capital
funding
so
as
to
ensure
it
can
survive
the
storm
.
this
be
so
that
when
people
start
fly
again
,
it
will
have
a
fighting
chance
.
Cork
Airport
go
from
2.7
million
passenger
in
2019
to
650000
passenger
this
year
.
if
we
be
speak
about
regionally
balance
economic
policy
,
we
must
ensure
Cork
have
a
fight
chance
in
order
that
when
the
airline
that
have
leave
Cork
decide
to
come
back
,
they
will
be
able
to
do
it
through
a
sustainable
operation
.
be
that
a
"
yes
"
?
will
we
get
funding
in
Cork
?
I
be
take
that
as
a
"
yes
"
.
I
thank
member
for
they
contribution
and
the
minister
for
he
motivational
remark
.
we
will
meet
again
next
Tuesday
in
the

I
thank
member
for

the
minister
for
he
motivational
remark
.
we
will
meet
again
next
Tuesday
in
the
national
convention
centre
for
budget
day
.
in
the
short
space
of
time
I
have
,
I
will
begin
with
the
area
of
agriculture
.
with
regard
to
the
agricultural
budget
,
there
have
be
much
talk
about
new
scheme
,
include
agri-environment
scheme
.
when
one
parse
the
document
,
however
,
it
be
very
hard
to
get
detail
.
that
difficulty
character
this
budget
generally
.
when
one
try
to
delve
into
the
minutiae
of
the
figure
and
the
wall
of
money
announce
in
the
last
24
hour
,
it
be
hard
to
find
the
devil
in
the
detail
.
I
will
speak
specifically
about
matter
such
as
the
green
,
low
-
carbon
agri-environment
scheme
,
GLAS
,
and
the
transitional
period
in
respect
of
CAP
.
we
be
still
unsure
as
to
how
that
money
will
filter
down
through
the
farm
gate
to
the
individual
farmer
.
we
will
need
more
clarity
on
this
matter
in
the
come
day
because
we
want
to
be
able
to
interrogate
the
figure
and
to
see
what
they
impact
will
be
for
individual
farm
family
.
I
also
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
fuel
allowance
,
specifically
as
it
relate
to
the
social
protection
budget
.
when
we
analyse
the
figure
in
respect
of
the
payment
of
the
fuel
allowance
under
budget
2021
,
we
notice
that
there
be
effectively
a
net
reduction
of
approximately
€
49
in
the
payment
.
it
be
we
contention
that
this
be
a
cut
rather
than
a
increase
,
as
the
government
have
portray
it
.
the
allowance
be
pay
for
four
extra
week
during
the
2019
-
20
season
,
which
be
worth
a
extra
€
98
.
the
budget
increase
of
€
3.50
a
week
will
apply
for
only
14
week
from
January
.
this
additional
payment
will
be
worth
€
49
over
the
full
2020
-
21
fuel
season
.
after
the
failure
of
the
government
to
provide
a
extra
four
week
of
fuel
allowance
,
as
it
do
last
winter
,
that
receive
the
payment
will
be
down
€
49
this
winter
.
Ceapaim
go
bhfuil
a
tAire
Stáit
ag
None
.
we
be
call
on
the
government
to
provide
another
four
week
of
the
fuel
allowance
and
reverse
the
effective
cut
in
the
amount
that
375000
people
will
receive
this
winter
.
the
four
extra
week
of
fuel
allowance
be
pay
in
the
2019
-
20
season
in
April
.
this
be
key
to
this
issue
.
that
extra
week
be
worth
€
24.50
a
week
,
or
a
total
of
€
98
.
in
the
budget
,
that
much
-
need
four
extra
week
be
not
retain
.
the
payment
will
instead
increase
by
€
3.50
from
January
2021
.
that
increase
,
however
,
will
only
apply
to
14
week
of
the
2020
-
21
fuel
season
,
and
that
be
worth
€
49
or
half
of
what
people
receive
this
year
.
in
effect
,
this
be
a
cut
.
the
nearly
375000
people
rely
on
the
fuel
allowance
this
winter
will
have
nearly
€
50
less
to
spend
to
keep
themselves
warm
.
in
the
middle
of
this
pandemic
,
old
and
vulnerable
people
be
spend
more
time
at
home
,
but
they
will
receive
less
this
winter
than
they
do
in
the
one
just
gone
.
even
take
account
of
the
increase
,
the
value
of
the
extra
payment
across
28
week
in
2021
-
the
last
14
week
of
the
2020
-
21
fuel
season
and
the
first
14
week
of
the
2021
-
22
season
-
will
be
€
98
,
which
be
exactly
the
same
as
what
be
provide
in
the
four
extra
week
in
April
of
this
year
.
take
that
into
account
,
however
,
we
must
remember
that
the
carbon
tax
increase
on
fuel
come
into
effect
in
May
,
which
mean
that
next
winter
,
people
will
be
face
high
heating
bill
but
without
any
real
extra
financial
support
from
the
fuel
allowance
payment
.
we
be
call
on
the
government
,
even
at
this
late
stage
,
when
the
Minister
for
employment
affair
and
social
Protection
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
come
before
we
,
to
take
on
board
we
suggestion
that
provide
a
extra
four
week
of
fuel
allowance
this
winter
will
negate
the
cut
.
the
technical
element
of
this
issue
be
that
the
fuel
allowance
be
pay
over
28
week
,
from
the
end
of
September
through
to
March
.
the
2019
-
20
fuel
season
be
extend
by
four
week
because
of
the
impact
of
Covid
-
19
.
that
be
worth
€
98
,
which
in
real
term
be
€
24.50
multiply
by
four
week
.
in
2021
,
the
payment
will
increase
,
as
I
have
detailed
,
by
€
3.50
a
week
from
January
.
over
a
full
28
week
that
will
be
worth
€
98
.
that
high
rate
be
only
be
pay
for
14
week
of
this
fuel
season
,
however
,
and
that
will
be
worth
€
49
.
in
essence
,
therefore
,
people
on
fuel
allowance
this
winter
will
be
down
by
€
49
compare
to
the
2019
-
20
fuel
season
,
and
they
will
also
face
more
expensive
fuel
cost
next
winter
because
of
the
increase
in
carbon
tax
.
the
select
Committee
on
social
Protection
,
Community
and
rural
Development
and
the
Island
have
complete
its
consideration
of
vote
42
for
the
year
end
31
December
2020
.
he
have
set
a
precedent
.
I
wish
to
address
the
same
issue
.
it
relate
to
Cork
Airport
and
the
loss
of
Ryanair
job
there
.
there
be
a
call
from
the
airport
stakeholder
that
the
EU
's
traffic
light
system
for
international
travel
be
adopt
because
that
would
give
a
fighting
chance
to
airport
like
that
at
Cork
and
Shannon
.
I
raise
this
issue
last
week
and
ask
again
that
the
cabinet
give
the
green
light
to
this
system
as
soon
as
possible
to
give
airport
like
Cork
Airport
a
fighting
chance
so
we
can
grow
the
route
again
.
I
express
my
solidarity
with
the
Ryanair
worker
at
Cork
Airport
and
Shannon
Airport
who
be
now
in
a
very
precarious
position
,
as
be
worker
in
other
airline
.
while
the
package
of
measure
-
some
€
10
million
for
the
two
regional
airport
-
announce
by
the
government
be
welcome
,
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
,
the
Tánaiste
and
the
cabinet
to
look
at
this
again
.
it
be
vital
that
a
decision
on
the
implementation
of
the
EU
traffic
light
system
for
international
travel
be
make
as
quickly
as
possible
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Cahill
's
final
comment
that
it
do
not
make
sense
to
import
peat
here
.
the
bottom
line
,
however
,
be
that
the
sector
will
have
to
transition
away
from
peat
.
we
will
not
have
a
endless
supply
of
peat
even
if
we
want
to
continue
with
extraction
.
in
the
interim
,
as
part
of
that
,
there
may
well
be
scope
to
facilitate
that
by
focus
on
the
domestic
demand
for
horticultural
peat
rather
than
export
.
regard
the
10
%
that
stay
here
as
oppose
to
the
90
%
we
export
,
there
may
be
scope
there
,
which
would
seem
to
I
to
be
a
reasonable
approach
in
that
we
would
put
we
grower
ahead
of
that
abroad
.
my
department
,
in
conjunction
with
the
industry
,
be
actively
look
at
alternative
to
peat
.
while
there
be
not
yet
any
suitable
or
viable
alternative
for
mushroom
case
,
my
Department
be
currently
fund
two
research
project
that
have
be
commission
by
Ireland
's
mushroom
producer
organisation
,
CMP
.
in
term
of
the
two
element
to
that
,
there
be
one
on
a
spend
mushroom
stabilisation
project
.
the
objective
of
that
project
be
to
develop
a
rapid
aerobic
process
to
stabilise
spend
mushroom
compost
and
create
a
by
-
product
that
could
be
use
as
a
grow
substrate
within
the
sector
.
that
work
be
ongoing
.
the
second
alternative
be
look
into
be
a
peat
case
reduction
project
.
the
objective
of
this
project
be
to
examine
the
impact
of
reduce
the
quantity
of
peat
use
as

in

production
.
a
number
of
alternative
substrate
can
be
use
but
they
have
issue
in
term
of
sustainability
and
they
location
.
this
be
a
issue

I
believe
it
be
something
the
sector
can
embrace
with
proper

it
be
very
seamless
between
ourselves
and
the
social
Democrat
.
we
work
nicely
together
.
I
welcome
and
support
the
motion
.
the
grant
Thornton
report
be
actually
a
good
report
and
well
worth
reading
.
I
be
glad
it
be
commission
.
I
be
particularly
impressed
with
the
strength
,
weakness
,
opportunity
and
threat
,
swot
,
analysis
element
of
it
.
the
report
refer
to
the
strength
of
the
post
office
with
its
premium
brand
recognition
and
positive
public
perception
,
be
at
the
heart
of
the
community
,
support
local
economic
growth
and
social
vibrancy
in
that
community
,
a
prove
track
record
of
service
delivery
,
a
loyal
customer
base
,
be
community
and
social
centred
,
have
the
capacity
to
handle
additional
business
,
as
well
as
be
Ireland
's
large
retail
network
with
a
unrivalled
geographical
reach
and
local
knowledge
of
the
network
.
the
weakness
be
the
structural
decline
in
letter
post
volume
,
grow
digitalisation
and
e-substitution
,
dependence
on
social
welfare
contract
,
increase
competition
and
the
failure
to
grow
profitable
service
line
,
and
uncommercial
post
office
branch
.
it
be
a
report
which
look
inward
and
be
honest
about
what
the
post
office
's
failing
and
weakness
be
.
the
opportunity
be
a
key
element
of
the
swot
analysis
.
they
include
assume
responsibility
for
additional
government
service
-
"
the
State
on
you
doorstep
"
-
capability
and
infrastructure
,
the
ability
to
extend
business
,
available
capacity
to
grow
service
offering
for
public
and
private
sector
organisation
,
open
up
the
financial
service
market
,
e-commerce
and
parcel
growth
,
capture
new
customer
and
increase
market
share
through
to
provision
of
complementary
service
and
product
.
I
could
go
through
the
threat
but
they
have
be
well
itemise
.
the
executive
summary
of
the
report
state
"
[
t
]
he
Post
Office
Network
consist
of
899
post
office
,
as
operate
by
independent
contractor
serve
local
community
across
Ireland
,
face
significant
level
of
unrestrained
closure
by
the
end
of
2021
without
urgent
government
intervention
"
.
that
be
the
key
sentence
.
year
in
,
year
out
we
all
stand
up
in
the
dáil
and
speak
about
the
importance
of
postal
service
provision
in
this
country
.
we
hear
platitude
speak
on
the
issue
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
as
the
report
highlight
,
the
cost
of
operate
the
post
office
network
be
€
70
million
.
the
revenue
generate
by
the
retail
element
associate
with
postmaster
be
€
53
million
.
therefore
,
the
funding
shortfall
which
must
be
make
good
to
prevent
unrestrained
closure
of
post
office
be
€
17
million
.
what
can
the
government
do
to
bridge
that
gap
?
as
I
have
already
note
,
the
report
be
very
good
at
identify
the
network
's
strength
.
how
can
we
build
the
business
base
and
expand
the
business
model
to
give
post
office
a
fight
chance
,
whether
they
be
locate
in
a
rural
setting
or
a
city
like
Cork
,
Galway
or
Limerick
?
post
office
everywhere
face
the
same
type
of
challenge
.
it
be
important
that
as
consumer
we
make
the
conscious
decision
to
use
post
office
.
the
volume
of
customer
be
a
issue
.
the
demise
of
letter
-
writing
have
obviously
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
.
one
could
argue
that
the
growth
of
the
parcel
service
will
be
relatively
short
-
live
because
company
like
Amazon
be
build
they
own
parallel
network
.
I
wonder
about
the
medium
-
term
or
long
-
term
sustainability
of
that
contract
with
a
Post
.
I
have
my
doubt
about
whether
it
will
turn
out
to
be
a
profit
centre
for
a
Post
after
all
.
we
need
to
move
beyond
platitude
.
this
be
a
very
good
report
.
the
government
must
examine
and
interrogate
it
further
with
a
ethic
of
ensure
that
post
office
be
plant
firmly
and
sustainably
in
community
.
there
be
a
template
in
this
report
.
if
it
be
give
a
fighting
chance
,
the
imbalance
in
that
figure
can
be
address
.
one
of
the
proposal
involve
a
public
service
obligation
.
this
should
be
seriously
consider
by
the
government
.
as
the
report
highlight
,
it
be
already
in
place
.
this
be
a
excellent
report
because
it
be
write
for
politician
like
ourselves
,
who
probably
do
not
have
time
to
go
through
report
of
this
nature
line
by
line
.
the
executive
summary
provide
a
very
good
synopsis
of
what
be
need
.
country
with
approval
from
the
European
Commission
to
operate
a
post
office
network
through
a
PSO
include
France
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
Poland
,
Finland
,
Spain
and
the
recently
depart
but
still
significant
Unite
Kingdom
.
we
do
not
have
one
but
I
think
it
should
be
consider
.
interestingly
,
the
report
also
highlight
that
other
industry
that
previously
operate
under
a
pso
in
Ireland
include
agriculture
,
aviation
,
rail
,
finance
,
bus
transport
,
radio
,
housing
and
energy
.
that
be
particularly
significant
.
as
politician
we
be
all
give
to
the
odd
platitude
.
if
we
can
move
beyond
rhetoric
,
embrace
the
report
and
think
differently
about
what
a
pso
can
look
like
,
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
build
a
sustainable
future
for
the
post
office
network
.
we
will
support
the
motion
on
that
basis
.
we
cannot
look
at
post
office
in
a
rural
setting
without
look
at
the
whole
area
of
rural
development
.
it
be
a
tangential
point
,
but
it
be
worth
highlight
the
report
of
the
Irish
local
Development
Network
on
budget
2021
.
the
report
outline
three
core
concern
,
namely
,
that
no
funding
have
be
provide
for
new
leader
project
in
2021
;
no
funding
have
be
identify
for
the
delivery
and
administration
of
the
leader
programme
in
2021
;
and
no
interim
national
rural
development
programme
have
be
announce
for
the
period
from
2021
to
2023
,
as
commit
to
in
the
programme
for
government
.
one
might
say
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
post
office
.
however
,
post
office
have
everything
to
do
with
the
rural
economy
,
how
money
can
be
spend
to
sustain
it
and
the
multiplier
effect
of
money
flow
into
it
.
we
need
to
be
more
expansive
in
we
thinking
about
the
rural
economy
and
rural
society
.
the
post
office
network
must
be
the
fulcrum
through
which
rural
society
survive
and
thrive
.
I
support
this
Bill
.
we
welcome
it
.
I
wish
to
take
the
opportunity
to
remember
the
Buttevant
rail
disaster
that
occur
on
1
August
1980
,
that
who
be
injure
in
it
and
the
18
who
die
.
this
be
pertinent
to
this
legislation
because
the
response
to
the
disaster
by
the
community
,
emergency
service
and
Iarnród
Éireann
,
or
CIÉ
at
the
time
,
be
absolutely
tremendous
.
the
event
still
haunt
the
community
of
Buttevant
and
the
wide
area
.
it
be
appropriate
that
we
be
discuss
legislation
on
railway
safety
and
the
reporting
and
investigation
of
serious
accident
and
incident
on
certain
railway
.
I
pay
tribute
to
everybody
involved
in
the
response
to
the
disaster
,
which
leave
so
many
people
scar
.
it
be
still
remember
today
.
I
pay
tribute
to
the
worker
in
Irish
Rail
.
I
be
a
weekly
user
of
rail
service
from
Cork
to
Dublin
and
also
a
weekly
DART
user
.
at
this
time
of
Covid
,
I
pay
tribute
to
that
who
operate
the
railway
service
for
we
in
very
difficult
circumstance
.
when
I
depart
Mallow
on
a
Tuesday
morning
,
there
be
always
great
banter
on
the
platform
with
the
worker
.
they
be
always
jovial
and
full
of
good
humour
.
the
same
apply
to
the
staff
on
the
train
.
they
bring
professionalism
and
friendliness
to
deal
with
customer
such
as
I
in
they
daily
work
.
we
should
remember
this
as
something
that
be
positive
and
contribute
to
society
.
what
underpin
it
be
the
etho
of
safety
on
the
railway
system
.
I
welcome
this
Bill
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Hildegarde
Naughton
,
for
she
deliberation
and
introduce
legislation
that
codify
and
tidy
up
element
of
railway
safety
in
respect
of
investigation
into
serious
accident
and
incident
.
it
be
important
that
we
have
this
legislation
.
I
again
pay
tribute
to
everybody
who
be
involved
in
the
response
40
year
ago
to
the
Buttevant
rail
disaster
.
the
people
within
the
community
and
that
who
professionally
respond
to
that
disaster
still
carry
the
memory
of
that
fateful
day
with
they
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
they
memory
and
also
acknowledge
the
people
who
be
injure
and
still
bear
the
scar
of
that
disaster
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
countenance
support
the
government
on
the
Bill
in
its
current
form
.
I
would
characterise
its
passage
as
one
of
sow
additional
confusion
and
obfuscation
and
have
the
effect
of
traumatise
further
the
many
woman
who
look
to
the
House
and
expect
we
to
legislate
on
the
basis
of
reason
.
the
manner
in
which
the
Bill
be
bring
before
the
Seanad
and
now
this
House
leave
one
utterly
disappointed
because
the
subject
matter
be
so
sensitive
that
the
least
we
would
have
expect
,
and
that
the
woman
would
have
expect
,
be
that
we
would
give
it
proper
and
due
consideration
and
time
to
reflect
on
all
the
issue
in
order
that
we
could
all
move
with
one
voice
.
the
effect
of
the
government
's
stance
,
position
and
approach
to
the
Bill
will
be
to
divide
the
House
.
a
minority
of
we
will
vote
against
the
Bill
,
as
it
be
currently
constitute
,
while
the
majority
will
vote
for
it
.
I
expect
that
many
on
the
government
bench
will
privately
agree
with
the
position
we
be
adopt
,
because
we
do
so
on
the
basis
of
reason
and
,
one
hope
,
intelligence
,
but
will
still
walk
through
the
lobby
and
vote
Tá
with
the
government
.
I
understand
that
happen
even
at
the
good
of
time
,
because
I
follow
the
whip
many
a
time
when
I
be
in
government
,
but
on
a
issue
such
as
this
,
there
have
to
be
time
and
consideration
.
I
write
to
the
Ceann
Comhairle
early
to
express
my
disappointment
at
the
way
in
which
certain
bill
be
be
deal
with
and
to
see
whether
we
could
find
some
mechanism
to
ensure
that
a
Bill
as
sensitive
as
this
would
find
a
good
way
of
progress
through
both
house
in
order
that
we
could
interrogate
further
what
the
minister
propose
.
the
minister
,
in
he
contribution
,
stick
rigidly
to
the
30
October
deadline
.
I
have
be
confuse
by
this
and
perhaps
the
minister
will
give
we
the
benefit
of
he
wisdom
but
it
be
my
simple
understanding
that
there
be
nothing
injurious
to
the
constitution
such
that
the
minister
could
not
provide
for
a
extension
of
time
for
the
passage
of
this
legislation
or
even
a
extension
of
time
for
the
commission
.
be
it
overly
simplistic
of
I
to
put
forward
the
argument
that
there
be
nothing
that
say
we
as
a
legislature
could
not
amend
the
Commission
of
investigation
Act
2004
to
make
provision
for
the
very
sensitive
issue
that
be
inherent
within
this
Bill
and
for
which
the
minister
be
argue
he
cannot
move
beyond
the
30
October
deadline
?
that
be
the
first
point
I
will
make
and
it
be
one
on
which
I
would
love
to
receive
a
answer
when
the
minister
be
respond
to
this
debate
.
the
second
issue
be
that
the
minister
send
we
a
note
by
he
adviser
or
staff
early
in
which
he
say
:
finally
,
with
regard
to
the
unfortunate
urgency
of
this
legislation
,
the
commission
be
due
to
submit
its
final
report
and
stand
dissolve
in
law
by
30th
October
.
at
present
,
that
timeframe
can
only
be
amend
where
the
minister
receive
a
request
for
a
extension
from
the
commission
which
be
ground
in
a
interim
report
.
this
request
then
have
to
be
consider
and
approve
by
government
.
to
date
,
no
request
for
a
extension
have
be
receive
.
as
such
,
if
this
legislation
be
not
enact
by
30th
October
,
then
we
will
have
fail
to
preserve
the
unique
database
develop
by
the
commission
and
provide
for
its
use
in
line
with
datum
protection
and
other
exist
law
.
forgive
my
blind
ignorance
and
I
seek
the
assistance
of
the
Ceann
Comhairle
and
the
minister
on
this
but
I
would
have
think
,
have
serve
in
government
,
that
there
be
line
of
communication
between
the
commission
and
the
government
such
that
,
if
the
minister
's
argument
be
that
he
have
not
receive
the
request
and
therefore
have
to
adhere
to
the
law
,
there
be
some
mechanism
that
could
be
find
to
allow
for
we
to
give
further
consideration
to
this
and
some
formal
or
informal
line
of
communication
can
be
establish
such
that
the
minister
stand
up
in
the
House
and
say
he
would
like
more
time
to
deliberate
and
that
he
would
like
a
extension
beyond
30
October
.
how
can
we
develop
a
mechanism
or
a
protocol
to
be
able
to
do
that
?
I
be
sure
something
could
be
find
to
do
that
and
to
facilitate
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
to
be
able
to
give
more
time
to
the
passage
of
this
legislation
.
will
the
minister
please
respond
to
that
question
because
it
be
not
just
about
I
?
more
importantly
,
it
be
about
the
people
outside
of
this
wall
who
be
look
to
we
,
who
have
write
to
we
,
who
be
traumatise
and
hurt
,
who
want
to
ensure
that
whatever
happen
in
here
happen
in
a
way
that
be
sensitive
to
they
need
.
right
now
,
the
way
they
feel
be
that
they
be
be
traumatise
again
and
we
need
to
address
that
as
a
legislature
.
if
some
mechanism
can
be
find
to
find
a
extension
then
it
should
be
find
.
I
think
it
can
be
find
and
that
it
can
be
do
easily
.
the
third
point
I
will
make
be
in
respect
of
the
minister
's
speech
where
he
say
:
I
intend
to
request
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Children
,
Disability
,
Equality
and
Integration
to
lead
on
this
re-examination
in
a
format
that
would
allow
for
survivor
and
they
representative
,
expert
legal
opinion
and
other
lead
academic
to
explore
thoroughly
the
major
principle
underlie
the
debate
on
access
to
personal
information
in
the
commission
's
archive
and
to
make
a
set
of
recommendation
aim
to
resolve
the
very
real
difficulty
which
the
passage
of
this
legislation
have
highlight
.
I
be
a
member
of
that
committee
and
my
interpretation
of
that
statement
be
that
the
minister
be
ask
I
,
as
a
member
of
that
committee
,
to
do
the
work
the
minister
should
be
do
as
a
minister
regard
the
process
of
pre-legislative
scrutiny
and
give
more
time
to
deliberation
of
this
issue
such
as
the
balance
of
rights
between
seek
information
and
of
personal
privacy
and
the
issue
of
agency
.
this
issue
should
all
be
sort
before
we
come
to
the
House
to
legislate
,
not
after
the
fact
,
because
deputy
Funchion
,
who
make
a
astounding
contribution
to
this
debate
early
on
,
be
chair
of
that
committee
and
there
be
now
a
expectation
be
foist
on
the
committee
that
we
would
deal
with
and
deliberate
on
this
and
come
up
with
a
set
of
recommendation
.
give
the
history
of
that
committee
under
a
previous
mandate
and
not
under
the
chairmanship
of
deputy
Funchion
we
have
make
umpteen
recommendation
through
umpteen
report
,
as
have
many
Oireachtas
committee
,
which
be
gather
dust
on
shelf
.
it
insult
my
intelligence
for
the
minister
to
bring
that
before
I
as
a
member
of
this
Oireachtas
when
there
be
a
mechanism
and
that
be
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
which
be
waive
in
this
instance
,
and
proper
consideration
in
committee
of
all
of
this
issue
so
that
we
can
legislate
properly
,
there
be
no
request
afterwards
and
we
do
not
legislate
in
haste
such
that
we
be
correct
error
after
the
fact
.
it
have
permutation
for
how
we
do
we
business
but
it
be
a
insult
to
the
people
who
have
be
traumatize
.
it
be
insulting
to
they
to
bring
legislation
in
this
way
.
this
should
be
non-partisan
and
it
should
be
deal
with
in
a
way
that
ensure
it
progress
and
every
member
of
this
House
agree
on
it
.
the
public
purse
be
ensure
that
this
development
will
go
ahead
and
it
be
important
that
developer
be
not
allow
to
turn
they
back
on
the
people
of
Ringsend
.

the
Ceann
Comhairle
speak
to
the
matter
of
reason
and
the
importance
of
people
listen
and
hearing
,
and
seek
to
have
that
principle
apply
to
both
side
.
the
tone
of
the
debate
here
,
unlike
debate
on
other
matter
,
have
be
measure
from
a
opposition
point
of
view
,
which
be
the
point
of
view
I
can
speak
from
.
we
be
be
ask
to
legislate
with
one
hand
tie
behind
we
back
because
we
feel
we
be
speak
to
reason
in
seek
more
time
for
more
deliberation
on
issue
.
one
issue
that
be
pertinent
to
this
Bill
be
information
and
tracing
.
we
do
not
have
a
information
and
tracing
Bill
.
that
render
this
Bill
and
its
effect
useless
for
the
countless
people
who
will
want
access
to
information
on
the
content
of
the
database
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
the
minister
's
amendment
will
ameliorate
that
.
we
have
be
tell
that
there
be
60000
record
.
my
colleague
,
Senator
Ivana
Bacik
,
say
in
the
Seanad
:
"
if
one
be
one
of
the
survivor
or
a
family
member
about
whom
there
be
datum
hold
,
how
frustrating
it
be
to
know
that
the
datum
be
go
to
be
hold
by
the
minister
but
seal
for
30
year
,
and
by
Tusla
for
some
undefined
period
yet
a
survivor
or
one
's
family
member
will
have
no
access
to
it
and
no
right
to
see
it
or
even
know
what
it
be
.
"
this
be
important
and
it
be
not
centrally
about
the
testimony
give
by
survivor
to
a
confidential
committee
but
about
the
60000
record
which
,
as
the
datum
protection
assessment
say
,
relate
to
a
wide
array
of
information
,
paper
,
record
obtain
under
discovery
and
record
hold
by
the
institution
,
State
,
religious
order
and
so
on
.
we
be
say
that
people
should
have
access
to
a
large
amount
of
information
where
it
identify
they
or
a
relative
,
or
where
it
be
they
information
.
how
frustrating
it
must
be
and
paternalistic
of
we
to
continue
to
hold
that
and
say
we
will
allow
people
access
at
some
future
point
but
that
we
do
not
yet
know
how
we
will
do
that
.
there
be
a
philosophical
point
about
how
,
while
nobody
be
striving
with
perfection
,
the
Parliament
deal
with
a
issue
as
sensitive
as
this
.
we
speak
last
night
and
the
minister
hear
excellent
,
balance
testimony
from
member
about
the
genuine
concern
of
people
to
find
a
way
of
negotiate
this
legislation
in
a
way
that
have
a
outcome
that
speak
to
the
need
to
create
the
archive
in
a
appropriate
way
and
also
with
regard
to
the
seek
of
information
.
it
be
not
partisan
or
overly
political
.
aside
from
the
flaw
in
the
legislation
,
what
be
missing
be
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
.
we
do
not
know
when
we
will
have
that
legislation
.
it
be
absolutely
germane
to
this
very
issue
.
that
be
why
we
be
hamst
as
a
legislature
.
that
Bill
should
at
least
be
publish
in
parallel
with
this
Bill
and
should
pass
this
house
.
we
be
seek
to
appeal
to
reason
.
the
minister
have
say
that
he
will
not
accept
amendment
.
as
deputy
Whitmore
say
,
that
be
a
forthright
view
,
and
it
render
the
next
few
hour
a
utter
sham
.
it
make
a
mockery
of
the
legislative
process
.
it
show
that
this
be
a
government
that
be
not
willing
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
that
on
the
Opposition
bench
who
,
to
we
mind
,
be
put
forward
reasonable
amendment
.
we
now
have
to
go
through
the
choreography
and
pageantry
of
the
next
hour
,
know
that
whatever
we
say
be
for
nowt
,
thus
disappointing
and
traumatise
people
who
feel
rightfully
aggrieved
because
of
the
method
by
which
this
legislation
be
be
pass
.
I
note
with
interest
the
point
make
by
deputy
Connolly
about
the
creation
of
Tusla
.
it
be
a
word
that
do
not
trip
off
the
tongue
easily
.
I
do
not
even
know
if
there
be
a
statutory
basis
for
the
name
"
Tusla
"
.
I
believe
it
be
call
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
.
we
would
all
do
ourselves
a
favour
if
we
be
to
continue
to
refer
to
it
as
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
.
I
do
not
know
when
the
marketing
people
come
in
and
decide
to
give
it
this
glossy
title
.
perhaps
this
be
something
that
should
be
review
and
revise
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
in
that
respect
.
the
minister
be
again
state
unambiguously
that
the
Bill
do
not
seal
the
mother
and
baby
home
archive
for
30
year
.
do
I
understand
that
correctly
?
the
minister
be
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
last
night
he
say
:
"
this
Bill
do
not
seal
the
mother
and
baby
home
archive
for
30
year
.
"
late
in
that
debate
,
he
also
say
:
the
2004
Act
provide
for
the
publication
of
the
final
report
of
a
commission
by
the
prescribe
minister
and
further
provide
that
the
archive
of
record
will
remain
seal
for
a
period
of
30
year
,
after
which
time
its
availability
for
public
inspection
be
govern
in
accordance
with
the
National
Archive
Act
1986
.
while
I
want
to
give
the
minister
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
this
seem
to
be
contradictory
statement
.
while
I
do
not
mean
this
in
any
pejorative
way
,
there
may
be
a
bit
of
wizardry
go
on
with
the
word
.
while
,
technically
speak
,
the
Bill
before
we
may
not
seal
the
database
or
the
record
,
the
minister
have
acknowledge
that
the
2004
act
on
which
all
this
hinge
provide
for
the
record
to
remain
seal
.
that
be
the
point
I
can
not
reconcile
in
my
mind
.
that
be
the
perception
I
have
,
and
I
be
quote
the
Minister
's
own
word
back
to
he
.
we
want
more
time
to
deliberate
on
this
so
that
we
could
go
through
this
line
by
line
,
dissect
the
minister
's
word
and
scrutinise
the
legislation
adequately
so
that
we
could
have
a
clear
conscience
collectively
that
we
be
pass
legislation
that
would
not
be
detrimental
to
the
woman
,
child
,
relative
and
everybody
directly
affect
by
the
legislation
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
clarify
for
we
he
intention
in
respect
of
this
in
the
simple
language
.
we
interpretation
be
that
there
be
a
definitive
sealing
of
the
record
.
the
minister
make
the
point
previously
,
in
response
to
point
I
make
on
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
word
with
regard
to
there
be
a
process
and
that
he
hope
to
bring
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
before
we
next
year
.
the
minister
will
forgive
I
if
I
be
somewhat
sceptical
about
he
ability
to
do
that
.
I
be
not
refer
to
he
personal
ability
to
do
it
.
I
do
not
doubt
he
bona
fide
in
this
respect
.
however
,
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
stop
like
a
juggernaut
and
it
have
not
start
again
,
and
I
do
not
understand
why
.
that
need
explain
and
further
interrogation
because
it
be
germane
to
this
Bill
,
not
from
the
privacy
or
confidentiality
aspect
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
seek
information
and
devise
a
process
to
facilitate
people
to
seek
the
information
they
so
deserve
and
that
be
theirs
as
of
right
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
please
clarify
the
seem
contradiction
in
he
second
stage
speech
last
night
on
the
record
's
sealing
.
he
state
:
the
2004
Act
provide
for
the
publication
of
the
final
report
of
a
commission
by
the
prescribe
minister
and
further
provide
that
the
archive
of
record
will
remain
seal
for
a
period
of
30
year
,
after
which
time
its
availability
for
public
inspection
be
govern
in
accordance
with
the
National
Archive
Act
1986
.
it
be
not
a
point
of
order
.
the
House
be
adjourn
.
it
be
not
a
point
of
order
.
the
House
be
adjourn
.
I
support
the
Bill
.
it
be
not
the
first
time
we
have
see
a
Bill
of
this
nature
.
I
be
do
research
early
and
discover
that
my
former
colleague
,
Willie
Penrose
,
bring
forward
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
.
the
issue
have
be
ongoing
for
a
long
time
.
with
due
respect
to
we
colleague
in
Sinn
Féin
,
they
be
not
the
first
to
the
party
on
this
matter
.
there
be
attempt
as
late
as
2016
by
Fianna
Fáil
and
deputy
Troy
,
who
be
now
a
minister
of
State
,
to
publish
a
Bill
on
this
.
up
until
last
March
,
deputy
Troy
give
a
commitment
to
he
constituent
that
he
support
the
establishment
of
a
single
Shannon
authority
with
statutory
power
.
March
be
not
very
long
ago
.
in
fact
,
a
former
Taoiseach
,
John
Bruton
,
give
a
commitment
on
the
issue
as
well
,
fadó
fadó
.
this
be
not
new
and
every
party
and
none
have
support
the
principle
of
the
establishment
of
a
single
authority
.
I
do
not
receive
a
copy
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
,
but
I
listen
carefully
to
what
he
say
.
my
understanding
of
the
government
amendment
be
that
the
Bill
be

a
second
time
this
day
nine
month
,
to
allow
for
a
examination
on
the
legislative
landscape
include
a
review
of
the
current
regulatory
environment
"
.
one
could
take
that
at
face
value
,
but
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
qualify
he
word
late
in
the
debate
when
he
say
"
if
appropriate
"
,
so
member
should
forgive
I
if
I
be
a
little
jaundice
in
my
view
of
whether
we
will
ever
see
the
establishment
of
a
single
Shannon
authority
with
statutory
power
.
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
tell
we
in
a
code
way
,
if
I
be
interpret
he
correctly
,
be
that
there
be
too
many
regulatory
issue
and
requirement
in
each
of
the
statutory
body
that
be
involved
in
the
Shannon
flood
risk
State
agency
co-ordination
working
group
,
which
be
a
awful
mouthful
,
to
bring
they
together
to
form
one
agency
.
the
amount
of
legislation
that
would
be
require
to
do
that
would
probably
have
the
House
deal
with
it
until
kingdom
come
.
however
,
we
should
try
,
because
the
problem
continue
.
I
have
evidence
of
the
work
of
the
opw
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
.
towns
such
as
Mallow
and
Fermoy
be
always
top
of
the
news
headline
whenever
there
be
a
flooding
incident
.
this
town
have
benefit
from
excellent
work
carry
out
by
the
opw
on
flood
alleviation
.
however
,
there
be
still
the
perennial
problem
of
the
Shannon
.
I
represent
a
Cork
constituency
,
but
I
recognise
the
fact
that
the
good
people
who
live
in
the
hinterland
of
the
River
Shannon
be
still
encounter
problem
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
be
flood
risk
management
plan
,
annual
work
programme
and
the
Minister
of
State
have
set
up
a
short
-
and
medium
-
term
working
group
,
and
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
in
this
regard
,
there
be
still
issue
in
respect
of
have
a
view
of
where
we
want
to
go
and
what
the
policy
be
from
a
high
-
level
perspective
with
regard
to
statutory
power
,
so
money
can
start
to
flow
into
each
of
the
problem
that
affect
the
people
who
live
on
or
near
the
River
Shannon
.
the
good
way
to
do
this
be
through
a
statutory
agency
.
I
will
repeat
the
point
that
be
make
early
in
respect
of
the
Shannon
flood
risk
State
agency
co-ordination
working
group
.
it
have
not
meet
regularly
.
it
do
not
have
statutory
power
as
a
co-ordination
group
.
I
know
from
past
experience
-
I
have
be
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
now
-
that
there
will
always
be
compete
agency
in
which
ego
be
large
,
there
be
turf
war
take
place
and
there
be
a
non-acceptance
of
responsibility
.
the
evidence
of
that
be
on
the
River
Blackwater
at
present
.
there
be
a
weir
that
be
in
such
a
woeful
state
of
repair
that
when
all
the
State
agency
appear
before
the
petition
committee
of
this
House
last
year
,
each
one
of
they
disavow
any
responsibility
for
the
repair
of
say
weir
.
person
's
experience
have
be
,
and
it
be
hard
not
to
be
cynical
about
this
,
that
they
have
be
lead
up
the
hill
on
too
many
occasion
in
the
past
and
promise
much
,
but
very
little
have
be
deliver
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
but
I
do
not
accept
the
response
from
the
government
to
this
issue
.
there
be
a
significant
majority
view
on
this
.
certainly
in
Fianna
Fáil
it
be
evidence
by
its
Bill
and
statement
as
late
as
last
March
,
while
there
be
a
history
in
Fine
Gael
of
support
the
principle
of
set
up
a
State
agency
.
Sinn
Féin
be
now
propose
it
and
we
be
support
it
.
we
bring
forward
legislation
previously
on
this
issue
.
I
do
not
believe
we
should
be
cow
by
the
challenge
it
entail
.
one
should
be
honest
with
people
about
what
one
be
try
to
do
and
tell
they
that
it
could
take
a
number
of
year
to
establish
.
if
the
minister
be
honest
and
forthright
with
people
about
the
fact
that
it
will
take
time
to
put
in
place
alleviation
measure
,
I
think
they
will
accept
that
.
what
they
do
not
accept
be
be
promise
something
in
March
and
then
,
in
November
,
for
one
of
the
three
party
in
power
to
come
in
to
stand
over
a
government
amendment
which
say
that
on
this
day
in
nine
month
's
time
second
stage
will
be
read
.
that
be
not
the
way
to
do
business
here
.
we
see
it
with
the
Education
(
Admission
to
Schools
)
Bill
and
the
sick
pay
scheme
.
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
when
there
be
a
tripartite
government
,
everybody
have
to
be
keep
on
board
and
happy
.
however
,
that
do
not
answer
the
question
pose
by
people
who
live
within
the
Shannon
region
and
who
,
as
it
be
,
be
serve
by
the
Shannon
.
I
ask
that
the
government
accept
the
second
Reading
of
the
Bill
tonight
and
that
we
would
,
through
the
various
line
committee
of
the
Oireachtas
,
grapple
with
what
be
a
serious
and
laudable
aim
of
every
party
in
this
House
,
namely
,
to
have
one
agency
responsible
for
deal
this
issue
.
if
there
be
challenge
from
a
regulatory
point
of
view
in
term
of
alig
and
legislate
for
that
,
then
let
we
just
do
it
and
manage
the
expectation
around
what
it
be
that
be
try
to
be
achieve
.
it
be
not
a
insurmountable
challenge
.
Ireland
be
a
small
country
.
person
know
each
other
.
by
and
large
,
relationship
be
informal
.
if
a
couple
of
head
have
to
be
knock
together
to
make
it
happen
in
the
State
agency
,
let
it
be
so
,
but
let
we
try
to
be
progressive
about
deal
with
this
issue
.
let
we
get
on
with
the
business
.
it
have
be
go
on
for
donkey
's
year
at
this
stage
.
I
welcome
the
minister
to
the
House
tonight
as
it
be
a
sign
that
she
be
give
this
very
important
matter
the
recognition
it
deserve
.
I
will
speak
to
the
future
of
the
tidy
Towns
competition
.
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
minister
on
17
September
ask
if
the
tidy
Towns
competition
would
be
allow
to
proceed
in
2021
under
the
current
social
distancing
and
public
health
guideline
.
the
minister
reply
by
say
the
tidy
Towns
competition
have
a
unique
place
in
Ireland
's
culture
and
since
its
inception
in
1958
,
when
it
have
52
entrant
,
the
competition
have
grow
year
on
year
to
see
a
record
number
of
924
entrant
in
2019
.
unfortunately
,
the
2020
SuperValu
tidy
Towns
competition
have
to
be
cancel
this
year
on
public
health
grounds
due
to
Covid
-
19
.
the
work
of
the
tidy
Towns
committee
be
build
on
community
come
together
and
work
together
;
in
the
position
we
find
ourselves
in
this
year
,
it
would
not
have
be
possible
for
committee
around
the
country
to
deliver
they
project
in
the
usual
way
.
the
minister
acknowledge
the
importance
of
the
competition
.
there
be
many
committee
throughout
the
country
that
want
to
continue
if
they
can
adhere
to
public
health
guideline
.
they
be
seek
some
solace
from
the
minister
and
the
public
health
guideline
interpretation
that
there
will
be
a
competition
next
year
.
they
be
seek
the
goodwill
of
the
government
and
the
minister
so
she
might
seek
to
do
she
very
good
to
ensure
the
competition
proceed
next
year
because
of
the
importance
of
the
competition
.
that
be
self
-
evident
but
if
the
committee
have
some
word
of
comfort
or
a
view
on
how
the
competition
might
proceed
in
2021
,
it
would
give
people
a
great
lift
in
this
time
.
we
know
the
character
of
the
volunteer
involve
with
the
tidy
Towns
competition
and
that
there
be
many
people
who
be
semi-retired
or
retire
who
work
on
it
.
it
be
a
competition
that
encourage
young
and
old
people
to
be
involve
.
they
just
want
some
guidance
and
direction
from
the
minister
.
if
it
be
in
the
affirmative
,
they
would
welcome
such
comment
.
will
the
minister
work
with
the
tidy
Towns
competition
in
a
way
that
will
allow
it
to
proceed
in
2021
?
it
would
be
a
positive
step
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
for
each
of
the
committee
involve
.
I
be
grateful
to
the
minister
for
she
reply
and
it
be
worth
stay
up
this
late
just
to
hear
such
a
assertive
and
affirmative
reply
from
the
minister
.
there
be
no
ambiguity
from
the
minister
about
the
future
of
the
competition
in
2021
and
the
more
than
924
applicant
that
will
be
there
will
be
delighted
with
the
news
.
it
be
a
very
genuine
competition
and
the
people
involve
be
the
salt
of
the
Earth
.
they
do
so
much
for
they
community
and
it
be
such
a
valuable
competition
.
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
SuperValu
in
the
sponsorship
in
bring
along
with
the
State
intervention
.
its
impact
be
enormous
and
in
the
midst
of
Covid
-
19
,
the
social
value
of
this
competition
be
highlight
even
more
.
this
be
a
very
positive
response
from
the
minister
and
all
the
volunteer
will
be
delighted
.
it
will
lead
to
yet
further
enhancement
of
we
community
across
the
State
and
I
sincerely
welcome
the
minister
's
reply
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
it
be
so
unambiguous
and
direct
.
on
this
night
of
the
US
election
,
it
be
worth
get
a
answer
like
that
at
11.50
p.m
.
it
be
rare
that

make

Cork
early
.
there
have
be
much
rhetoric
in
Cork
and
many
harsh
word
from
both
side
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
person
have
become
very
entrenched
and
it
have
go
to
law
.
that
be
people
's
right
if
they
want
to
do
that
.
I
ask
that
calmness
be
restore
on
the
issue
in
Cork
.
I
believe
that
people
everywhere
acknowledge
that
the
work
have
to
be
do
but
there
be
a
contrast
in
how
they
should
be
do
,
whether
we
go
for
demountable
wall
and
a
mix
of
other
type
of
solution
or
for
the
tidal
barrier
.
it
would
be
very
useful
to
have
the
perspective
of
the
opw
on
the
potential
cost
of
a
tidal
barrier
.
we
have
hear
a
range
of
figure
but
I
be
not
aware
that
active
consideration
have
be
give
to
that
or
whether
a
price
have
be
put
on
that
.
business
people
and
resident
in
Cork
affect
by
flooding
want
a
solution
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
Minister
of
State
say
he
would
not
meet
with
the
save
Cork
City
people
.
I
be
not
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
do
that
,
but
some
mechanism
need
to
be
find
to
bring
all
side
together
.
this
be
something
my
party
colleague
,
such
as
councillor
John
Maher
and
Peter
Horgan
,
have
call
for
.
they
be
on
public
record
on
that
.
we
just
need
a
bit
of
calm
.
the
rhetoric
need
to
be
tone
down
.
Public
official
who
make
public
utterance
on
this
issue
need
to
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
they
serve
all
the
people
of
Cork
and
all
they
view
.
there
be
a
legitimate
question
mark
over
whether
the
consultation
process
be
actively
engage
in
after
the
fact
or
whether
there
be
a
proper
and
due
analysis
of
that
consultation
process
.
I
be
not
say
there
be
not
,
but
there
be
a
question
mark
in
the
mind
of
people
in
Cork
on
whether
there
be
a
active
engagement
on
that
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
have
due
consideration
to
that
issue
also
.
he
be
in
a
powerful
position
because
he
have
management
of
the
purse
string
.
that
give
he
weight
and
heft
in
the
debate
regard
Cork
city
.
I
ask
he
to
use
he
good
office
to
seek
some
sort
of
intervention
,
for
a
honest
broker
to
come
into
proceedings
to
mediate
a
solution
between
the
two
side
before
the
debate
become
even
more
entrenched
.
the
Minister
of
State
also
speak
about
insurance
cost
.
I
meet
with
he
predecessor
,
the
former
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Canney
,
a
number
of
year
ago
about
this
issue
.
at
this
point
there
be
a
strong
evidence
base
for
the
effectiveness
of
demountable
flood
defence
in
town
like
Mallow
,
which
be
my
home
town
.
I
live
a
stone
's
throw
from
the
Blackwater
.
I
have
witness
the
efficacy
of
demountable
flooding
structure
as
they
pertain
to
the
Munster
Blackwater
,
particularly
for
the
town
of
Mallow
and
Fermoy
.
they
work
and
there
be
a
evidence
base
for
that
.
we
have
to
take
on
the
insurance
company
that
be
not
insure
resident
and
business
in
this
area
.
they
be
not
apply
the
principle
of
fairness
.
where
there
be
a
evidence
base
and
it
be
incontrovertible
that
the
demountable
wall
work
,
there
should
be
no
issue
in
procure
insurance
for
one
's
premise
.
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
that
he
be
look
at
this
issue
but
it
have
be
go
on
for
too
long
now
and
we
be
always
be
fob
off
by
the
insurance
sector
.
even
though
there
be
a
strong
evidence
base
before
they
,
they
continue
to
refuse
to
insure
property
in
area
where
there
be
demountable
flood
defence
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
redouble
he
effort
in
that
regard
.
a
minor
work
scheme
application
be
make
in
2018
regard
flooding
issue
at
Castlemartyr
,
County
Cork
.
we
be
now
on
the
cusp
of
2021
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
take
a
look
at
the
Castlemartyr
issue
again
and
to
correspond
with
I
on
it
if
possible
.
the
minister
of
State
speak
about
the
efficacy
of
minor
flood
work
scheme
last
night
.
where
there
be
outstanding
application
for
such
scheme
,
I
ask
that
he
consider
give
they
a
degree
of
urgency
.
I
pose
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
about
the
coastal
protection
scheme
and
Roches
Point
in
Cork
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
Green
Party
councillor
Liam
Quaide
raise
this
issue
previously
and
Paschal
Sheehy
of
RTÉ
do
a
very
good
piece
on
it
on
25
October
.
there
be
a
terrace
of
11
coastguard
cottage
in
Roches
Point
,
date
back
to
the
1830s
,
where
flooding
be
still
take
place
.
I
understand
that
no
application
for
work
have
come
before
Cork
County
Council
.
that
be
something
on
which
I
as
a
local
public
representative
will
follow
up
.
if
that
application
come
in
from
Cork
County
Council
,
I
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
give
due
consideration
to
protect
Roches
Point
.
it
be
a
wonderful
place
.
its
people
be
resilient
and
it
be
a
key
point
within
we
county
.
it
would
be
great
if
this
matter
be
give
some
priority
and
progress
by
the
county
council
.
in
respect
of
Glashaboy
and
Blackpool
in
Cork
,
some
concern
have
be
express
about
whether
the
length
of
the
propose
culvert
would
have
a
environmental
impact
on
flora
,
fauna
and
biodiversity
in
that
area
.
on
foot
of
I
raise
the
issue
here
,
could
I
correspond
further
with
the
Minister
of
State
about
it
or
could
he
official
correspond
with
people
in
Blackpool
who
have
concern
about
whether
culvert
be
the
most
effective
way
of
deal
with
that
issue
?
we
will
adhere
to
expert
advice
but
this
concern
nonetheless
need
to
be
address
.
Glashaboy
and
Glanmire
have
have
some
degree
of
forbearance
and
I
ask
the
minister
of
State
to
progress
that
issue
as
well
because
it
be
vitally
important
for
the
resident
of
the
area
.
my
question
relate
to
the
propose
amendment
to
the
consumer
Protection

Regulation

2018
to
introduce
provision
to
regulate
the
affordability
clause
in
hire
purchase
and
personal
contract
plan
,
pcp
,
financing
arrangement
,
particularly
as
they
relate
to
the
motor
industry
.
more
than
76000
people
be
on
pcp
contract
and
the
value
of
loan
outstanding
be
some
€
1.5
billion
.
the
Tutty
report
in
2018
advise
that
legislation
be
introduce
in
this
area
.
many
people
who
have
such
contract
have
lose
they
job
as
a
result
of
the
Covid
crisis
and
be
have
to
seek
help
from
the
money
advice
&
budgeting
service
,
MABS
,
because
they
be
unable
to
get
any
forbearance
from
some
of
this
company
.
will
the
Taoiseach
give
this
issue
he
personal
attention
?
they
have
be
expect
"
shortly
"
for
a
while

I
receive
a
response
on
30
September
to
a
question
I
tab
in
respect
of
payment
to
student
nurse
in
the
first
-
year
to
third
-
year
cohort
.
the
response
state
:
supernumerary
clinical
practice
placement
be
temporarily
suspend
during
the
initial
Covid
-
19
pandemic
response
and
a
temporary
scheme
be
put
in
place
whereby
this
student
be
offer
employment
by
the
HSE
as
healthcare
assistant
.
this
supernumerary
clinical
practice
placement
will
resume
as
expect
,
base
on
the
requirement
for
undergraduate
nursing
and
midwifery
programme
.
base
on
a
trawl
through
the
figure
that
be
provide
to
I
,
more
than
554
people
be
affect
by
this
issue
among
the
first
-
year
to
third
-
year
cohort
.
I
reiterate
the
call
from
the
Irish
Medical
Organisation
,
INMO
,
for
a
scheme
to
be
put
in
place
,
similar
to
the
one
that
be
previously
in
operation
,
under
which
student
nurse
be
pay
healthcare
assistant
salary
.
that
be
do
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
many
student
nurse
be
work
well
beyond
they
experience
.
we
know
there
be
serious
capacity
issue
within
the
system
.
accord
to
the
INMO
,
the
reality
of
current
service
provision
be
that
"
inadequate
register
nursing
staffing
level
be
require
student
throughout
they
clinical
placement
to
undertake
work
over
and
above
that
expect
of
they
undergraduate
status
"
.
the
INMO
state
that
the
failure
to
remunerate
they
"
amount
to
exploitation
"
.
we
all
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
organisation
in
this
matter
.
we
be
merely
call
on
the
government
to
recognise
that
student
nurse
be
worker
and
that
they
should
be
pay
for
they
work
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
come
at
this
issue
from
a
high
education
point
of
view
.
I
acknowledge
he
indication
that
there
be
the
possibility
of
take
it
up
with
the
HSE
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
relevant
line
minister
.
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
nurse
be
productive
from
the
minute
they
go
onto
a
ward
or
into
a
acute
hospital
setting
.
that
be
the
point
we
be
make
.
Student
nurse
be
take
up
the
slack
due
to
the
lack
of
capacity
at
this
time
.
there
be
a
precedent
in
the
fact
that
,
at
the
start
of
the
pandemic
in
March
,
a
payment
be
make
to
student
nurse
akin
to
the
healthcare
assistant
payment
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
revisit
that
payment
scheme
.
it
could
go
a
long
way
towards
stave
off
the
possibility
that
some
of
this
student
nurse
will
be
lose
from
the
system
.
if
people
get
good
pay
and
condition
at
a
early
stage
in
they
career
,
the
chance
be
good
that
they
can
be
retain
within
the
service
instead
of
be
lose
to
Australia
,
Dubai
or
the
UK
.
we
must
be
more
lateral
in
we
thinking
in
respect
of
the
day
-
to
-
day
support
that
nurse
should
have
because
we
need
to
retain
they
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
the
Financial
Resolution
1
to
15
,
inclusive
,
for
the
Finance
Bill
2020

today
,
on
the
question
that
the
Financial
Resolution
1
to
15
,
inclusive
,
be
agree
to
,
a
division
be
claim
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.

I
welcome
the
Tánaiste
's
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
government
will
not
oppose
the
Bill

stage

that
be

move

we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
national
remote
working

group
will
meet
today

that
be
important

what
we
want
to
do
with
this
Bill
be
ensure
we
enshrine
the
right
to
switch
off
in
law
while
at
the
same
time
recognise
that
flexibility
need
to
be
build
in
for
individual
in
they
workplace
as
befit
they
circumstance
and
in
concert
with
they
employer
.
nobody
be
argue
against
that
flexibility
.
work
mother
,
in
particular
,
and
commuter
need
to
have
that
blend
so
that
they
can
go
to
the
office
or
work
from
home
as
need
be
.
childcare
be
a
essential
component
,
especially
for
work
mother
and
work
family
.
we
have
see
the
evidence
of
the
effect
of
the
first
lockdown
for
work
mother
.
research
from
the
National
woman
's
Council
show
that
it
be
have
a
detrimental
effect
and
lead
to
stressful
situation
for
work
mother
who
be
literally
work
all
hour
and
,
in
the
first
lockdown
,
have
to
take
care
of
child
.
it
affect
work
mother
in
the
main
.
we
want
the
principle
of
the
right
to
switch
off
to
be
enshrine
in
legislation
.
we
want
to
improve
the
rights
of
worker
by
provide
employee
who
work
remotely
with
the
right
to
switch
off
from
out
-
of
-
hour
work
-
related
electronic
communication
.
this
be
important
for
they
mental
health
,
for
that
caring
for
child
and
for
other
vulnerable
people
who
need
support
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
the
Tánaiste
in
respect
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
nobody
be
seek
to
amend
that
such
that
every
employee
would
not
be
entitle
to
at
least
11
hour
of
rest
in
every
24
hour
and
every
employer
would
not
permit
he
or
she
employee
to
work
for
more
than
48
hour
in
a
week
under
that
act
.
nobody
be
talk
about
amend
that
act
to
the
detriment
of
worker
,
lest
the
impression
be
convey
that
that
be
the
case
.
the
Tánaiste
refer
to
some
concern
that
he
have
in
respect
of
the
diminution
of
worker
's
rights
,
which
be
absolutely
not
the
case
in
this
legislation
.
we
seek
to
strengthen
the
rights
of
worker
;
allow
for
a
new
paradigm
to
exist
whereby
people
be
,
by
necessity
,
work
from
home
;
and
ensure
we
do
not
have
a
dystopian
future
.
we
have
see
evidence
of
employer
monitor
worker
at
home
through
the
use
of
application
of
Time
Doctor
,
ActivTrak
,
Terramind
and
StaffCop
,
where
surveillance
application
be
be
apply
to
worker
who
work
at
home
at
all
hour
of
day
and
night
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
we
as
a
legislature
legislate
for
the
new
phenomenon
in
a
way
that
protect
worker
's
rights
and
allow
for
some
protection
from
the
point
of
view
of
both
occupational
health
and
safety
and
ensure
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
act
be
apply
and
strengthen
.
