correspondence
with
the
Chief

Solicitor

Office
with
a

which
will

and
,
to
that
end
,
a
further
meeting
have
be
schedule
between
my
Department
and
the
County
Council
to
further
clarify
outstanding
issue
.
I
sincerely
thank
the
leader
of
all
the
political
party
,
of
all
persuasion
,
for
that
kind
and
wonderful
word
.
I
thank
too
the
staff
of
the
House
whose
expression
of
sympathy
in
the
past
few
week
have
make
we
proud
of
the
fact
that
when
we
father
be
a
member
,
he
acquit
himself
well
,
be
well
like
and
do
he
good
for
the
people
he
represent
.
we
grief
for
we
father
be
personal
but
to
be
able
to
share
it
so
publicly
in
many
respects
and
that
so
many
have
express
sympathy
with
we
leave
we
proud
.
we
heart
be
warm
by
the
fact
that
the
man
endear
himself
to
so
many
.
I
cannot
say
too
much
today
but
with
the
indulgence
of
the
House
will
read
some
line
from
a
letter
I
receive
from
a
former
colleague
and
dear
friend
of
my
father
's
who
campaign
with
he
over
many
year
:
Joe
epitomise
for
I
all
that
be
good
,
fine
and
noble
in
politics
.
I
be
so
move
to
hear
you
speak
so
proudly
on
Thursday
[
the
day
of
the
funeral
]
about
he
genuine
commitment
to
the
Republicanism
of
Wolfe
Tone
and
of
the
French
Revolution
,
of
Liberty
,
Equality
and
Fraternity
,
because
that
be
what
I
see
Joe
Sherlock
live
when
I
have
the
privilege
of
work
with
he
.
he
be
a
instinctive
socialist
,
and
find
ease
with
the
noble
of
spirit
and
of
heart
.
he
think
and
fight
from
the
heart
.
he
could
readily
distinguish
between
nationalism
and
republicanism
,
and
always
know
a
sham
when
it
present
.
his
be
a
abide
humanity
,
a
part
of
himself
that
he
could
not
detach
or
shake
off
.
his
volcanic
ability
for
anger
never
fail
.
he
never
have
to
feign
it
—
he
honesty
valve
be
set
so
high
!
for
the
very
many
of
we
who
have
the
privilege
of
walk
in
Joe
's
considerable
shadow
,
I
must
say
that
it
be
a
rare
privilege
.
it
be
enrich
and
exciting
.
he
give
hope
and
leadership
,
and
enable
person
to
dream
,
and
to
believe
that
there
be
and
be
a
good
way
of
do
thing
.
one
of
the
other
great
irony
be
that
while
Joe
be
never
in
government
,
he
achieve
more
for
the
people
of
North
Cork
as
a
campaigning
politician
than
a
Mercedes
full
of
government
minister
ever
have
—
he
make
a
real
impact
on
people
's
life
.
we
should
not
forget
Joe
,
and
though
he
main
monument
be
build
in
we
heart
,
we
must
not
leave
he
inspiration
slip
.
all
money
have
be
pay
to
the
group
on
the
basis
of
the
vouch
eligible
capital
expenditure
documentation
it
submit
to
my
Department
.
under
the
Group
Broadband
Scheme
(
GBS
)
,
project
be
approve
for
a
cap
amount
of
grant
aid
base
on
the
project
and
financial
plan
.
the
draw
down
of
such
grant
aid
be
,
however
,
conditional
on
the
production
of
documentation
to
vouch
that
the
requisite
eligible
capital
expenditure
have
be
incur
within
one
year
of
the
grant
approval
offer
.
there
be
no
mechanism
under
the
GBS
for
the
award
of
supplementary
payment
to
group
where
a
shortfall
occur
between
the
vouch
eligible
expenditure
incur
and
the
grant
amount
originally
offer
.
I
raise
this
question
in
the
context
that
Ireland
have
up
to
€
8.1
billion
in
food
export
on
a
annual
basis
.
recently
we
see
that
approximately
1.3
million
tonne
of
pigmeat
be
import
from
outside
the
EU
into
Ireland
and
then
brand
and
package
here
.
my
question
be
base
on
the
fact
that
Irish
pig
producer
be
rapidly
go
into
decline
because
long
-
establish
brand
be
be
market
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
impression
that
they
use
Irish
pig
meat
.
the
European
Union
be
currently
review
the
condition
and
I
understand
the
issue
may
be
only
within
the
competence
of
the
Union
.
however
,
the
government
have
a
certain
responsibility
in
the
issue
.
if
there
be
no
provision
in
we
law
to
amend
legislation
,
I
call
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
labelling
,
through
marketing
and
Bord
Bia
,
be
do
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
that
where
a
consumer
purchase
a
product
perceive
to
be
Irish
,
a
clear
label
be
attach
to
the
product
attest
to
that
fact
.
this
have
serious
implication
for
pig
producer
and
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
clarify
whether
the
government
be
make
provision
in
that
regard
.
be
the
minister
aware
that
Galtee
Foods
in
Mitchelstown
,
a
company
that
have
sustain
people
in
the
area
for
many
year
,
recently
close
?
one
of
the
main
reason
be
the
clear
perception
among
consumer
that
,
though
its
product
be
brand
as
Irish
,
they
be
import
and
the
Galtee
brand
have
diminish
in
stature
as
a
result
.
it
be
a
result
of
a
certain
degree
of
government
intransigence
on
the
issue
that
we
now
see
the
demise
of
a
traditional
company
and
the
government
need
to
do
more
to
ensure
the
industry
,
which
have
sustain
many
farming
family
for
a
long
time
,
be
support
.
I
preface
my
question
by
state
the
strong
belief
within
my
party
that
the
loss
of
a
industry
that
sustain
many
farm
family
and
industrial
worker
throughout
the
land
for
generation
be
a
travesty
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
Indecon
report
,
on
which
the
government
base
its
recommendation
,
be
incorrect
.
the
government
,
therefore
,
cost
taxpayer
untold
sum
of
money
and
put
they
through
the
process
of
go
to
the
high
court
which
subsequently
reverse
the
decision
.
it
be
utterly
needless
and
a
waste
of
taxpayer
's
money
.
will
the
minister
respond
on
that
issue
?
the
fundamental
question
be
when
the
restructuring
package
will
be
introduce
and
the
grower
pay
.
what
level
of
consultation
have
there
be
with
grower
on
the
issue
?
have
there
be
final
and
full
agreement
on
the
matter
?
the
Indecon
report
be
important
.
I
want
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
the
Indecon
report
cost
the
taxpayer
,
how
much
it
cost
to
go
to
the
high
Court
.
the
issue
here
concern
the
public
purse
and
how
money
be
expend
on
behalf
of
taxpayer
.
can
the
minister
guarantee
that
Greencore
will
not
challenge
this
decision
which
,
although
it
have
be
take
at
a
political
level
,
have
yet
to
go
through
the
board
of
Greencore
?
it
should
be
state
that
the
minister
be
a
shareholder
or
have
a
golden
share
in
that
company
.
we
have
hear
the
quintessential
civil
servant
's
answer
.
every
farmer
take
responsibility
for
ragwort
or
any
noxious
weed
.
nevertheless
,
it
exist
extensively
throughout
the
country
.
one
can
have
all
the
public
awareness
and
information
campaign
in
the
world
,
but
action
be
need
.
would
the
minister
consider
fund
local
authority
to
ensure
this
blight
be
wipe
out
,
particularly
on
roadside
verge
?
farmer
and
landowner
take
responsibility
for
noxious
week
when
they
occur
on
they
land
.
I
take
the
view
that
the
glass
be
half
full
but
there
be
a
trend
in
Irish
agriculture
of
flight
from
the
land
.
this
be
largely
due
to
global
trend
.
the
WTO
be
influence
mainly
by
global
corporation
and
that
have
a
effect
on
small
Irish
family
farm
.
will
the
minister
bear
that
in
mind
when
she
attend
WTO
talk
or
Council
of
Minister
's
meeting
?

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
to
discuss
the
follow
urgent
matter
of
public
interest
:
the
serious
economic
and
employment
implication
for
the
Cork
East
constituency
and
Cork
in
general
follow
the
announcement
that
the
Amgen
project
which
be
to
deliver
more
than
1000
job
be
not
to
proceed
,
the
need
for
the
Minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
to
outline
the
background
to
the
decision
and
the
step
he
intend
to
take
to
ensure
the
project
proceed
or
be
replace
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
considerable
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
have
be
expend
on
attract
this
industry
to
Cork
East
and
the
people
of
the
region
—
—
—
—
want
to
know
exactly
how
much
be
spend
.
we
be
seek
to
bring
the
minister
before
the
House
so
that
we
can
have
a
opportunity
to
ask
he
that
relevant
question
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
the
announcement
by
Amgen
have
come
as
a
body
-
blow
to
the
east
Cork
region
.
the
economic
loss
to
Carrigtwohill
and
surround
area
be
unquantifiable
.
I
empathise
with
that
people
who
have
lose
they
job
in
the
company
.
while
global
corporate
entity
like
Amgen
be
subject
to
the
vagary
of
international
market
,
the
people
of
the
region
accept
in
good
faith
statement
make
by
the
company
in
April
that
a
delay
of
two
year
in
the
project
would
not
amount
to
a
complete
cessation
of
it
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
a
second
announcement
yesterday
to
the
effect
that
the
project
be
indefinitely
postpone
be
nothing
more
than
spin
and
a
deliberate
attempt
to
play
down
the
decision
not
to
proceed
.
anyone
with
common
sense
must
conclude
that
two
postponement
in
six
month
be
tantamount
to
a
cessation
.
the
government
have
serious
question
to
answer
.
question
arise
as
to
whether
Amgen
or
IDA
Ireland
be
the
beneficial
owner
of
the
site
at
which
the
project
be
to
proceed
.
we
must
also
ask
what
will
happen
to
the
site
in
the
event
of
a
further
postponement
or
acknowledgement
of
cessation
.
the
project
be
to
be
the
mainstay
of
the
region
and
Middleton
,
Youghal
and
other
centre
of
population
have
place
they
bet
on
it
.
many
young
people
invest
in
housing
in
the
region
on
foot
of
the
promise
of
foreign
direct
investment
by
Amgen
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
we
have
be
deal
a
hammer
blow
and
that
people
be
extremely
disappointed
.
expectation
in
this
context
have
not
be
manage
well
by
the
government
,
which
now
have
a
serious
case
to
answer
.
the
minister
have
a
responsibility
to
deliver
to
the
people
of
the
region
.
be
I
allow
to
make
a
point
of
order
?
on
a
point

the
minister
say
he

out
the

congratulation
,
deputy
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Martin
Ferris
and
Mary
Upton
.
if
Deputy
Doyle
and
Connaughton
be
sell
that
calve
,
they
might
give
I
a
shout
because
I
be
think
of
increase
my
herd
by
200
%
.
I
speak
in
support
of
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
between
2005
and
2006
,
the
agrifood
sector
account
for
163400
job
,
or
8.1
%
of
the
working
population
.
Irish
agrifood
export
account
for
more
than
€
8
billion
.
as
a
country
we
discount
the
importance
of
this
sector
of
the
economy
at
we
peril
.
at
a
time
when
increase
consolidation
of
the
agrifood
sector
be
drive
the
market
,
we
must
not
forget
the
importance
of
ensure
that
consumer
interest
be
maintain
.
we
must
also
continue
to
ensure
that
the
protection
of
consumer
health
lie
at
the
core
of
agriculture
and
food
policy
.
in
recent
time
,
the
standard
set
for
Irish
farmer
in
the
production
of
beef
and
pig
meat
be
not
be
subscribe
to
by
producer
from
third
country
who
have
access
to
Irish
and
European
market
.
in
essence
,
Irish
farmer
be
be
ask
to
ensure
that
they
produce
be
of
the
high
standard
before
go
to
market
while
they
counterpart
in
country
outside
the
European
Union
can
compete
on
a
uneven
playing
field
.
the
regulatory
framework
be
clearly
not
work
in
this
instance
.
the
EU
legislative
framework
,
as
it
stand
,
work
against
the
Irish
farm
family
and
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
be
compromise
as
a
result
.
more
important
,
the
health
of
the
Irish
consumer
be
compromise
if
there
be
so
much
as
the
slight
doubt
about
the
standard
of
produce
be
import
into
Irish
market
from
third
country
.
Brazilian
beef
be
a
case
in
point
.
Brazilian
producer
in
many
instance
produce
to
the
high
standard
but
there
be
legitimate
concern
about
the
traceability
and
production
method
of
some
Brazilian
beef
which
find
its
way
on
to
Irish
table
.
this
motion
rightly
call
for

to

other
such

within

reasonable

to
address
the
concern
of

government
policy
on
the
protection
of

far
as
it
pertain
to
guard

in

importation
be
too
weak
at

.
on
substantial
transformation
,
I
realise
that
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
labelling
legislation
rest
with
the
food
Safety
Authority
of
Ireland
.
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
,
whereby
a
primary
product
can
enter
Ireland
,
be
process
in
some
way
and
subsequently
be
brand
as
Irish
,
be
govern
by
EU
legislation
.
however
,
it
be
not
good
enough
that
the
government
would
hide
behind
EU
legislation
in
tackle
this
problem
,
nor
be
it
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
say
it
can
only
be
amend
at
EU
level
.
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
on
3
October
last
,
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
deputy
Sargent
,
express
the
follow
concern
:
...
this
arrangement
could
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
be
use
to
mislead
the
consumer
as
to
the
origin
of
the
raw
material
use
in
certain
product
.
I
be
not
satisfied
with
the
current
legal
position
and
the
minister
have
raise
we
concern
at
EU
Council
level
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
share
my
concern
,
we
need
to
know
how
he
will
address
they
and
what
proactive
measure
he
will
take
to
ensure
the
viability
of
producer
and
confidence
of
consumer
,
who
should
be
the
primary
concern
.
it
be
not
sufficient
for
he
to
say
:
"
the
concept
of
substantial
transformation
need
to
be
more
clearly
define
and
I
will
continue
to
urge
the
commission
to
address
this
problem
.
"
a
weak
legislative
base
on
labelling
allow
consumer
to
be
dup
into
believe
product
of
the
kind
in
question
be
of
Irish
origin
.
the
government
's
primary
concern
must
be
to
protect
the
health
of
consumer
and
ensure
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
farming
.
in
seek
to
be
proactive
on
this
matter
,
we
must
work
with
the
farming
organisation
and
processor
to
ensure
that
the
quality
assurance
mark
take
pride
of
place
on
every
packet
leave
the
factory
floor
.
a
clear
marketing
strategy
,
with
a
strengthening
of
legislation
,
be
the
key
to
solve
this
problem
.
on
3
October
last
I
ask
the
minister
if
she
would
amend
legislation
to
ensure
that
foodstuff
of
foreign
origin
would
not
be
label
as
"
produce
in
Ireland
"
,
"
process
in
Ireland
"
or
"
source
and
produce
in
Ireland
"
.
I
ask
the
question
to
remedy
the
circumstance
whereby
consumer
and
producer
interest
be
not
be
protect
and
to
ensure
that
we
comparative
advantage
as
a
nation
would
be
maintain
.
I
realise
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
have
overall
responsibility
for
the
general
food
labelling
legislation
and
that
food
labelling
be
govern
by
directive
2000
/
13
/
EC
.
the
government
state
in
response
to
the
commission
paper
labelling
,
competitiveness
,
consumer
information
and
good
regulation
for
the
EU
,
publish
in
2002
,
that
there
be
a
unsatisfactory
practice
at
play
regard
substantive
transformation
.
the
government
make
certain
recommendation
in
this
regard
but
they
have
not
come
to
fruition
.
why
have
the
commission
not
act
on
the
Irish
recommendation
to
date
and
why
have
the
minister
not
be
more
proactive
on
the
matter
?
the
commission
be
now
prepare
to
forward
proposal
but
I
understand
this
involve
a
co-decision
procedure
.
we
could
be
back
in
this
house
in
12
month
still
with
no
resolution
to
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
.
I
urge
the
minister
to
fast
-
track
the
process
,
where
possible
.
on
29
September
last
,
the
Irish
Farmers
Journal
report
that
Reox
Holding
,
a
subsidiary
of
Dairygold
,
be
in
the
process
of
sell
Breeo
Foods
.
Breeo
Foods
carry
top
brand
such
as
Dairygold
,
Shaws
,
Galtee
meat
,
Roscrea
,
Mitchelstown
,
Calvita
and
Sno
.
this
brand
be
long
-
establish
in
the
mind
of
consumer
and
be
perceive
to
be
Irish
in
origin
and
content
.
the
truth
be
otherwise
and
some
of
this
brand
be
market
in
a
way
that
suggest
they
be
Irish
.
in
the
mind
of
pig
producer
and
worker
in
Mitchelstown
and
beyond
,
the
closure
of
Galtee
Foods
be
as
a
direct
result
of
substantial
transformation
.
if
there
be
to
be
no
provision
in
Irish
law
to
amend
legislation
in
the
short
term
,
the
government
should
ensure
that
labelling
,
through
a
proper
marketing
strategy
by
Bord
Bia
,
will
be
implement
clearly
.
the
government
must
also
allow
open
access
to
that
plant
that
be
be
market
by
Bord
Bia
to
ensure
that
the
content
of
all
produce
be
as
it
say
on
the
packet
or
tin
.
I
be
not
ashamed
to
say
we
must
protect
we
national
interest
.
we
have
a
comparative
advantage
over
other
country
and
we
must
maintain
this
competitive
edge
.
the
future
of
Irish
agriculture
depend
upon
it
.
it
be
not
my
job
to
criticise
the
government
for
the
sake
of
criticism
but
it
be
necessary
to
critically
assess
its
response
to
agricultural
issue
as
they
arise
.
the
Labour
Party
be
not
against
the
science
of
genetic
modification
and
do
not
adopt
a
fundamentalist
view
thereon
.
we
believe
biotechnology
can
coexist
with
natural
biodiversity
without
compromise
the
latter
.
it
be
in
this
context
that
we
seek
to
ensure
that
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
be
maintain
.
with
that
in
mind
,
it
be
beyond
we
comprehension
that
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
choose
to
abstain
from
a
crucial
vote
on
genetically
modify
animal
feed
at
a
meeting
of
the
European
Council
of
Minister
in
Brussels
last
month
.
the
minister
's
logic
for
this
abstention
,
that
be
,
that
it
do
not
affect
the
eventual
outcome
,
be
beyond
belief
.
we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
European
Commission
will
move
to
approve
genetically
modify
feed
import
.
the
internal
party
machination
of
the
Green
Party
be
of
no
concern
to
we
.
what
be
of
concern
to
we
be
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
EU
scientific
committee
move
at
a
pace
that
be
in
keeping
with
the
market
and
provide
for
a
level
playing
pitch
for
Irish
agriculture
.
the
government
's
intransigence
on
this
issue
,
by
way
of
abdicate
its
responsibility
,
be
grossly
negligent
and
undermine
we
ability
to
negotiate
on
further
matter
of
this
nature
.
we
support
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
it
mark
a
pragmatic
approach
to
the
good
means
of
maintain
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
while
protect
the
right
of
consumer
to
perfect
knowledge
of
they
purchase
and
ensure
that
Irish
farming
family
can
compete
on
a
level

pitch

,
the

by

whether
it
will

with

plant
?
if
anybody
be
to
be
accuse
of
play
politics
with
this
issue
it
be
the
member
of
the
minister
's
party
and
he
backbencher
.
what
about
the
€4
million
?
we
all
accept
the
vagary
of
the
international
market
,
that
negotiation
be
delicate
and
that
landmark
project
of
this
nature
sometimes
do
not
proceed
.
if
Amgen
be
retain
ownership
of
the
site
,
the
people
of

will
want
to
know
why
it
be
do
so
when
they
have
postpone
the
project
twice

be
the

continue
negotiation
with
Amgen

will
Amgen
make
a

decision
on
its
intention
in

where
Amgen

go
?
if
it
do
not
locate
within

will
someone
else
do
so
?
give
that
€
4
million

expend
to
attract
this
industry
,
a
legitimate
question
hang
over
the
use
of

's
money

the
Amgen
project

I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Broughan
.
I
will
speak
for
approximately
two
minute
.
I
thank
deputy
Broughan
for
share
he
time
.
he
would
have
give
I
more
time
but
I
be
sure
he
will
address
the
salient
point
in
the
argument
.
there
be
a
gross
disparity
result
from
the
outsource
of
driver
testing
to
private
company
.
the
list
of
centre
on
the
on
-
line
driving
application
form
on
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
,
website
do
not
include
every
centre
to
which
driver
may
apply
.
I
know
of
people
who
wait
month
for
they
test
only
to
be
inform
by
telephone
that
it
have
be
outsource
to
a
private
company
at
a
test
centre
other
than
the
one
to
which
they
have
apply
.
they
receive
no
notification
of
this
change
in
writing
.
applicant
who
move
to
live
in
another
part
of
the
country
encounter
serious
difficulty
in
transfer
they
application
to
test
centre
at
they
new
location
.
I
know
a
man
who
apply
for
a
driving
test
in
Tallaght
where
he
be
live
but
who
late
move
permanently
to
Mallow
.
he
seek
in
writing
to
do
he
test
at
the
Mallow
test
centre
.
since
then
he
have
receive
two
test
date
from
SGS
in
Tallaght
.
he
have
receive
no
correspondence
acknowledge
he
request
to
change
test
centre
.
SGS
management
tell
he
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract
for
testing
in
Cork
.
he
will
soon
have
to
move
to
he
third
provisional
licence
before
receive
a
driving
test
date
.
the
testing
system
be
farcical
and
until
this
be
sort
out
,
the
rate
of
fully
qualified
driver
will
increase
only
marginally
,
not
at
the
rate
the
government
and
the
RSA
anticipate
,
certainly
not
in
the
ten
week
timescale
determine
by
the
minister
or
,
as
he
put
it
,
"
on

"

I
thank
the
minister
for
she
reply
.
the
timeline
be
as
we
anticipate
and
I
welcome
the
establishment
of
the
consultative
committee
.
I
refer
the
minister
to
a
speech
give
by
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
in
Paris
last
month
.
she
refer
to
the
Health
check
,
the
strengthening
of
competitiveness
,
support
rural
society
and
so
on
.
it
be
all
very
aspirational
in
its
aim
.
farmer
be
worried
about
the
issue
of
cross-compliance
and
modulation
under
the
single
payment
scheme
and
,
particularly
,
whether
the
commission
will
place
upper
or
low
limit
on
payment
to
they
under
the
scheme
in
the
context
of
the
Health
check
.
they
be
worried
about
the
nature
of
cross
compliance
and
the
stringent
control
under
which
they
be
place
.
have
the
government
define
a
clear
negotiating
position
on
that
issue
because
farmer
have
strong
view
on
they
?
the
government
be
now
discriminate
against
that
people
who
get
they
application
in
on
time
and
who
will
now
be
cut
off
as
a
result
of
this
action
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
verbose
answer
and
he
advertising
blurb
for
RTE
.
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
Bord
Bia
and
the
Department
of
Community
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
through
the
leader
programme
be
do
much
to
encourage
farmer
's
market
.
however
,
on
the
ground
,
many
farmer
's
market
be
striving
—
I
will
not
say
they
be
struggle
—
to
boost
they
popularity
locally
.
much
of
this
work
be
do
through
voluntary
effort
.
while
programme
be
in
place
through
leader
to
help
they
,
if
some
sort
of
direct
support
be
make
available
to
they
for
advertising
through
local
media
,
it
would
be
of
great
assistance
to
they
.
judge
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
,
he
be
not
tell
I
that
he
Department
necessarily
will
be
directly
responsible
for
that
and
I
accept
this
point
.
I
also
accept
the
fact
that
there
be
serious
potential
within
this
country
for
the
growth
of
local
market
.
will
the
minister
of
State
consider
the
idea
of
direct
finance
for
marketing
and
advertising
?
I
be
aware
of
the
time
constraint
.
give
that
the
legislation
be
at
the
stage
of
a
first
reading
at
the
Council
of

,
be
the

aware

the
range
of

that
will
come

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
construct
a
relief
road
at
Mallow
,
County
Cork
and
the
urgent
need
to
serve
notice
to
land
owner
within
the
vicinity
of
the
project
before
the
period
expire
,
beyond
which
the
compulsory
purchase
order
process
cannot
take
place
,
thus
jeopardise
the
project
's
future
.
as
previously
state
,
most
recently
in
my
reply
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
530
on
9
October
2007
,
the
approach
to
determine
the
hardship
payment
be
fair
and
reasonable
and
there
be
no
plan
to
revise
the
scheme
.
the
€
25
m
salmon
Hardship
scheme
adopt
by
government
be
intend
to
provide
a
measure
of
relief
to
individiual
in
line
with
the
level
of
hardship
likely
to
be
experience
on
foot
of
the
cessation
of
mix
stock
fishing
for
wild
salmon
.
the
overall
sum
take
account
of
the
level
of
payment
recommend
by
the
independent
Group
and
the
record
catch
history
of
the
eligible
licensee
.
a
additional
€
5
million
be
be
provide
under
a
Community
support
scheme
,
the
focus
of
which
primarily
will
be
that
community
where
commercial
salmon
fishing
have
be
a
well
-
establish
activity
and
where
its
withdrawal
demonstrably
impact
on
the
economic
and
social
fabric
of
the
area
.
the
transfer
of
function
to
the
Department
of
Transport
seem
logical
and
laudable
in
some
respects
.
it
can
only
be
effective
if
it
deal
with
a
certain
range
of
issue
.
I
can
only
speak
for
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
for
the
general
Cork
area
,
where
funding
for
non-national
road
have
be
absolutely
derisory
.
if
this
Bill
be
to
mean
anything
,
it
must
ensure
funding
be
effective
and
will
trickle
down
through
the
various
division
within
Cork
County
Council
and
its
engineering
area
.
what
we
have
see
to
date
be
that
road
prioritise
under
Transport
21
receive
funding
,
which
be
welcome
,
but
non-national
road
or
secondary
road
receive
no
funding
whatsoever
.
the
N72
and
N73
be
particular
example
.
if
we
be
to
take
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
which
be
on
that
route
,
one
will
serve
the
main
tourist
route
between
Waterford
and
Killarney
and
the
other
will
serve
the
main
route
from
Kanturk
,
west
of
Mallow
and
through
to
Dublin
.
Mallow
currently
have
hub
-
town
status
but
we
be
not
get
the
trickle
-
down
effect
of
financial
incentive
to
create
the
northern
relief
road
,
which
be
vital
to
a
town
like
Mallow
and
its
surround
area
in
term
of
its
attractiveness
for
inward
investment
and
the
creation
of
infrastructure
around
the
town
.
we
need
a
change
in
policy
and
funding
for
road
such
as
this
.
they
be
vital
artery
for
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
but
they
have
become
dangerous
road
because
of
a
lack
of
proper
funding
.
to
travel
the
road
from
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
on
a
day
such
as
today
,
in
some
instance
one
be
take
one
's
life
in
one
's
hand
.
two
lorry
cannot
pass
each
other
comfortably
on
some
part
of
the
road
without
stop
or
slowing
down
to
speed
of
5
km/h
or
10
kilometer
/h
.
that
speak
volume
about
the
government
not
invest
properly
in
such
infrastructure
.
deputy
Ferris
speak
of
community
involvement
and
local
improvement
scheme
.
there
be
almost
a
begging
-
bowl
mentality
in
this
regard
for
public
representative
such
as
myself
.
I
have
to
go
cap
in
hand
to
local
area
engineer
to
seek
funding
or
to
have
certain
road
prioritise
within
divisional
engineering
area
,
which
be
completely
ludicrous
in
this
day
and
age
.
if
people
pay
road
tax
and
a
development
contribution
for
the
building
of
a
house
in
a
rural
part
of
the
county
,
I
do
not
see
why
they
should
have
to
pay
extra
to
have
a
road
include
in
a
local
improvement
or
community
involvement
scheme
.
this
people
should
have
the
same
rights
and
entitlement
as
any
other
citizen
of
this
State
to
have
the
road
outside
they
house
in
a
acceptable
condition
.
the
Cork
to
Limerick
road
also
speak
volume
about
government
policy
,
as
we
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
have
be
wait
for
this
northern
relief
road
but
be
almost
at
the
mercy
of
Transport
21
and
the
funding
stream
of
the
NRA
.
there
be
also
the
question
of
whether
the
NRA
will
get
the
requisite
funding
to
be
able
to
create
the
Atlantic
corridor
between
Cork
and
Limerick
,
and
whether
a
spur
will
be
create
for
the
northern
relief
road
.
this
be
policy
issue
as
to
how
funding
be
implement
at
the
local
level
but
they
have
a
great
effect
on
people
's
life
.
that
be
what
we
be
speak
to
in
debate
this
legislation
.
will
a
change
in
legislation
bring
about
a
mark
increase
in
the
quality
of
people
's
life
,
as
we
must
ensure
it
do
?
I
speak
about
development
contribution
and
the
current
funding
of
local
government
be
completely
inequitable
.
if
a
young
couple
apply
for
planning
permission
today
,
they
will
be
levy
at
exorbitant
rate
for
contribution
on
the
building
of
they
house
.
it
add
to
the
cost
of
building
and
they
do
not
see
a
return
in
term
of
increase
lighting
or
improvement
in
the
road
surface
outside
the
house
.
the
money
be
centralise
within
the
county
council
and
then
divvy
out
through
the
division
.
the
northern
division
of
a
county
council
would
compete
with
the
southern
division
for
funding
into
specific
area
.
the
entire
area
of
government
policy
as
it
pertain
to
road
must
be
look
at
.
if
we
be
to
enhance
the
quality
of
people
's
life
,
any
effect
or
change
in
the
legislation
must
ensure
this
happen
.
if
the
government
's
proposal
succeed
,
there
will
be
dire
consequence
for
the
provision
of
not
-
for
-
profit
child
care
and
the
significant
contribution
make
by
this
sector
to
we
community
will
be
roll
back
.
any
change
to
the
subvention
structure
under
the
national
child
care
investment
programme
that
result
in
a
reduction
in
staffing
level
will
mean
a
reduction
in
fund
available
to
pay
staff
in
many
community
-
base
child
care
centre
.
this
possibility
contradict
the
commitment
in
the
national
development
plan
to
provide
a
additional
28000
child
care
place
and
8,000
job
in
child
care
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
subvention
be
be
introduce
in
reverse
.
that
be
to
say
,
the
high
rate
of
subvention
be
be
suggest
for
parent
who
be
in
receipt
of
full
social

I
call
on

in
the
light
of
the
publication
yesterday
of
the
European
Commission
's
proposal
on
cap
reform
and
of
the
health
check
and
give
that
this
be
a
legislative
proposal
to
which
the
government
will
be
a
party
and
which
will
have
serious
permutation
for
Ireland
and
bring
about
significant
change
with
regard
to
how
the
farming
community
and
the
rural
economy
develop
,
will
the
government
make
time
available
to
debate
the
matter
in
the
House
?
although
no
specific
legislative
proposal
be
due
to
come
before
the
House
,
will
the
government
,
in
view
of
the
serious
nature
and
importance
of
the
issue
,
make
arrangement
for
such
a
debate
?
I
accept
the
Taoiseach
's
point
.
the
matter
will
obviously
be
discuss
by
the
joint
committee
.
however
,
in
view
of
its
serious
nature
,
it
be
worthy
of
a
debate
in
the
House
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Wall
.
in
speak
to
this
motion
one
wonder
what
be
the
government
's
primary
motivation
in
put
it
before
the
House
.
it
be
not
a
legislative
proposal
.
it
contain
no
concrete
provision
.
it
be
short
on
detail
and
long
on
aspiration
and
therein
lie
the
rub
.
the
government
be
high
on
aspiration
but
low
on
delivery
.
the
motion
be
so
broad
that
one
sense
there
be
a
clear
agenda
by
the
government
to
pay
lip
service
to
the
idea
of
address
the
young
people
's
issue
throughout
this
island
.
what
young
people
want
be
concrete
legislative
proposal
that
will
speak
directly
to
they
concern
.
this
concern
be
well
document
and
have
be
bring
to
government
through
representative
body
such
as
the
National
Youth
Council
of
Ireland
,
NYCI
.
the
NYCI
be
a
social
partner
and
the
genuineness
of
this
motion
will
be
measure
by
the
government
's
response
to
concern
outline
by
group
such
as
the
NYCI
.
I
fear
,
however
,
that
this
motion
be
meaningless
and
full
of
platitude
and
that
young
people
have
become
use
to
hear
from
a
government
about
the
provision
of
service
.
in
the
limited
time
afford
to
I
I
wish
to
address
a
number
of
specific
area
.
the
first
relate
to
the
health
of
child
and
we
young
people
.
the
NYCI
,
in
its
budget
submission
,
call
on
the
government
to
deliver
on
its
promise
to
double
the
income
threshold
for
full
medical
card
entitlement
for
parent
of
child
under
six
year
of
age
in
this
year
's
budget
.
I
believe
this
be
attainable
.
the
government
must
look
positively
on
this
proposal
.
approximately
1.1
million
child
and
young
people
under
the
age
of
18
live
in
Ireland
.
accord
to
the
NYCI
,
only
305000
of
they
be
cover
under
the
medical
card
scheme
.
access
to
a
gp
be
vital
to
ensure
that
a
young
person
can
avail
of
service
to
assist
he
or
she
through
this
difficult
year
.
a
young
person
need
to
be
able
to
do
this
without
incur
a
financial
cost
.
this
service
would
serve
as
a
positive
move
that
would
give
young
people
the
confidence
and
independence
to
avail
of
vital
service
but
in
a
way
that
would
ensure
confidentiality
.
Young
people
live
in
rural
area
in
particular
where
counselling
and
other
service
be
not
readily
available
would
benefit
in
particular
.
the
government
must
also
look
favourably
on
family
with
child
over
the
age
of
seven
and
under
the
age
of
18
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
income
threshold
be
raise
to
allow
more
child
to
avail
of
primary
and
secondary
health
care
.
the
second
issue
that
need
to
be
address
be
the
lack
of
adequate
facility
and
service
for
young
people
who
be
in
need
of
counselling
and
require
access
to
mental
health
facility
.
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
the
organisation
Let
get
together
be
set
up
to
help
other
affect
by
suicide
and
to
examine

in
2005

Foundation

up
with
a
number
of
similar
organisation
throughout
the
country
to
set
up
a
all
-
Ireland
suicide
prevention
strategy
,
thereby
raise
awareness
of
the
issue
and
speak
to
local
and
national
media
.
if
this
motion
be
to
mean
anything
,
the
government
must
assist
organisation
of
this
nature
.
the
high
rate
of
suicide
be

among
young
man
aged
under
35
—
this
age
group
account
for
40
%
of
all
Irish
suicide
.
there
be
a
clear
lack
of
a
coherent
government
policy
to
encourage
young
people
who
be
experience
difficulty
in
they
life
to
talk
to
other
about
it
.
the
lack
of
available
fact
on
a
range
of
health
and
lifestyle
issue

user
to
relevant

throughout
the
country

exacerbate
the
travesty
of
suicide
which
have
reach
epidemic
proportion
throughout
this
land
.
we
have
the
fifth
high
suicide
rate
in
Europe
among
the
15
to
25
year
age
group
and
death
by
suicide
be
the
number
one
cause
of
death
among
young
Irish
man
.
the
government
,
if
it
be
serious
about
this
motion
,
need
to
fund
more
campaign
of
representative
organisation
such
as
the
NYCI
,
through
the
primary
care
strategy
,
to
reduce
the
large
number
of
death
by
suicide
.
awareness
must
be
raise
.
Young
people
need

and
to
be
able
to
access
they
in
a
safe
and
non-judgmental
manner
.
we
have
all

of
we
have

fortunate
in
that
we
have
family
and
friend
to

not
every
young

have
that
luxury
.
issue
such
as
come
out
to
parent
,
unexpected
pregnancy
,
low
self
-
esteem
and
depression
need
to
be
tackle
in
a
non-judgmental
way
.
on
the
issue
of
unwanted
pregnancy
,
now
that
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
,
deputy
Harney
,
have
admit
that
vat
on
condom
can
be
cut
to
as
low
as
5
%
,
will
she
not
bring
a
proposal
to
cabinet
that
the
minister
for
Finance
should
cut
the
tax
from
21
%
to
5
%
,
as
be
do
in
the
UK
and
other
EU
member
state
?
the
crisis
Pregnancy
Agency
have
state
that
32
%
of
people
have
indicate
that
the
cost
of
contraception
be
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
not
to
use
condom
,
result
in
a
rise
incidence
of
sexually
transmit
disease
and
unintended
pregnancy
.
I
could
go
on
as
there
be
many
issue
.
however
,
since
I
be
share
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Wall
,
I
be
happy
to
do
so
and
will
leave
it
at
that
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
the
Defence
Force
camp
at
Kilworth
,
County
Cork
,
have
be
designate
as
the
location
for
a
prison
cover
Munster
and
it
will
replace
facility
at
Cork
Prison
in
particular
.
the
propose
location
of
the
prison
will
be
within
the
1200
acre
camp
locate
close
to
the
M8
motorway
between
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
and
it
be
destine
to
house
up
to
450
prisoner
.
on
Monday
last
,
the
resident
of
the
immediate
area
call
public
representative
to
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
proposal
and
to
air
they
genuine
concern
.
in
seek
this
adjournment
debate
,
I
wish
to
speak
about
a
number
of
that
concern
.
give
that
this
prison
will
be
construct
under
the
term
of
the
strategic
infrastructure
legislation
,
there
be
genuine
concern
that
local
resident
's
fear
will
not
be
address
.
the
construction
of
such
a
large
prison
within
a
very
rural
area
raise
a
number
of
fear
.
for
example
,
landowner
who
lease
land
from
the
Department
of
Defence
for
agricultural
purpose
now
wonder
where
they
future
lie
.
they
have
a
long
-
standing
arrangement
and
have
ask
will
they
be
able
to
stay
on
the
land
or
will
this
scenario
change
.
person
have
also
ask
whether
the
land
acquisition
process
for
the
prison
have
be
complete
.
if
not
,
there
be
a
strong
school
of
thought
within
the
community
that
the
footprint
of
the
prison
should
be
move
to
a
more
suitable
location
within
the
overall
landholding
.
the
community
also
believe
the
prison
should
be
construct
within
contour
that
make
it
more
suitable
.
it
be
strongly
perceive
that
the
current
proposal
,
as
we
understand
it
,
be
a
site
within
162
acre
.
if
the
land
acquisition
be
not
complete
,
resident
believe
that
the
case
could
be
make
for
the
prison
to
be
move
,
even
if
that
be
beyond
the
current
162
-
acre
footprint
.
from
a
environmental
point
of
view
,
there
be
concern
that
three
stream
within
the
footprint
of
the
proposal
will
be
compromise
.
the
area
in
question
be
serve
by
the
Killally
,
Ballinrush
and
Graigue
group
water
scheme
.
the
source
of
this
scheme
be
approximate
to
the
footprint
of
the
site
.
the
minister
,
in
response
to
a
question
I
tab
on
Thursday
last
,
state
that
normal
planning
provision
do
not
apply
to
a
prison
development
.
there
be
a
understanding
that
for
security
reason
one
do
not
broadcast
or
make
know
the
exact
plan
.
we
all
acknowledge
that
fact
,
but
further
concern
have
be
raise
about
the
transport
provision
to
and
from
the
prison
.
person
in
the
nearby
village
of
Kilworth
,
where
at
time
traffic
cause
a
bottleneck
,
be
seek
,
through
they
community
council
,
assurance
on
the
traffic
management
provision
of
the
proposal
.
they
also
seek
a
buffer
zone
around
the
prison
from
a
aesthetic
and
security
point
of
view
.
that
who
live
in
Cork
city
be
use
to
the
presence
of
a
prison
within
they
city
.
the
construction
of
a
prison
of
this
nature
in
a
very
rural
area
would
give
rise
to
genuine
cause
for
concern
and
anxiety
.
if
the
proposal
be
be
present
as
a
fait
accompli
and
be
not
subject
to
normal
planning
consideration
,
I
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
ensure
any
provision
relate
to
public
safety
and
environmental
concern
be
address
.
to
assist
the
community
further
,
I
respectfully
request
of
the
minister
and
he
official
that
he
would
meet
a
deputation
of
resident
and
public
representative
in
the
area
so
they
can
have
they
concern
address
at
a
early
stage
.

it

report
yesterday
that

40
million
next
year
on
carbon
credit
.
until
such
time
as
the
year
on

,
I
will
take
anything
say
on
the
government
bench
about
this
issue
with
a
pinch
of
salt
.
as
a
newly
elect
deputy
,
I
find
this
a
extraordinary
week
.
on
two
of
the
most
important
issue
pertain
to
Ireland
,
young
people
and
climate
change
,
we
have
be
offer
opportunity
to
speak
at
length
but
no
legislation
or
other
concrete
proposal
have
be
bring
forward
.
I
think
I
be
elect
to
address
this
and
other
issue
through
legislation
but
I
see
this
week
that
be
not
the
case
.
consider
this
issue
as
only
worthy
of
a
talking
shop
add
to
the
cynicism
for
politics
outside
this
house
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
about
the
correlation
between
climate
change
and
energy
production
and
the
demand
for
food
.
there
be
a
danger
that
the
technological
advance
in
agriculture
that
have
dramatically
increase
crop
yield
in
the
past
50
year
could
be
erode
due
to
the
real
and
present
danger
of
climate
change
.
give
that
solar
radiation
,
temperature
and
precipitation
be
the
main
driver
of
crop
growth
,
agriculture
be
still
highly
dependent
on
the
climate
.
energy
production
be
also
a
function
of
crop
growth
.
it
be
therefore
obvious
that
any
significant
change
in
climate
on
a
global
scale
will
impact
on
local
agriculture
and
thereby
affect
the
world
's
food
and
energy
supplies
.
it
be
important
for
this
house
to
discuss
the
correlation
between
climate
change
and
energy
security
in
the
context
of
food
production
.

and

next

,
the
FAO
be
expect
to
state
that
global
food

be
at
they
low
in
25

and
that
price
will
remain
high
for

.
the
article
in

also
state
:

.
Argentinian

have
call
for
a

so
that

.
there
be
a
simple
explanation
for
why
this
be
happen
now
.
increase
in
food
price
stem
from
a
increase
in
oil
price
.
record
oil

be
force
a
flight
out
of
food
production
in
favour
of
energy
production
.
US

couple
with
this
change
,
extreme
weather
condition
and
grow
demand
from
country
such
as
India
and
China
be
cause
a
serious
spike
in
grain
and
rice
demand
.
it
be
estimate
that
the
competition
for
grain
between
the
world
's
800
million
motorist
and
its
2
billion
poor
people
,
who
be
simply
try
to
survive
,
be
emerge
as
the
epic
battle
of
we
time
.
the
government
cannot
produce
a
motion
on
climate
change
and
energy
production
without
factor
in
food
production
and
its
effect
on
energy
security
.
climate
change
have
already
begin
to
have
serious
effect
on
food
supply
.
therefore
,
policymaker
in
this
country
will
need
to
adjust
they
thinking
.
we
can
achieve
self
-
sufficiency
in
the
area
of
grain
production
but
this
must
be
do
in
a
way
that
meet
security
of
energy
and
food
supply
.
if
the
United
State
be
seek
to
reduce
petrol
demand
by
20
%
before
2017
,
we
must
wake
up
and
take
note
in
this
country
.
we
now
have
a
scenario
where
oil
price
increase
create
a
demand
for
food
for
energy
production
.
climate
change
and
inclement
weather
pattern
be
force
a
spike
in
food
price
and
biofuel
from
grain
production
be
experience
unprecedented
demand
.
this
have
serious
permutation
for
third
world
farmer
.
Oxfam
have
already
warn
that
the
EU
policy
of
substitute
10
%
of
all
car
fuel
with
biofuel
threaten
to
displace
poor
farmer
in
third
World
country
.
change
in
climate
be
cause
a
catastrophe
which
be
force
the
price
of
food
upwards
.
one
optimistic
economic
analysis
predict
that
market
will
automatically
readjust
to
food
shortage
as
high
grain
price
make
it
profitable
once
more
to
grow
crop
for
people
rather
than
car
.
if
we
be
to
be
serious
about
this
issue
in
Ireland
,
we
must
harness
exist
resource
such
as
wind
and
tidal
power
and
subscribe
to
a
philosophy
of
ensure
food
security
.
we
must
encourage
great
food
production
domestically
to
offset
grow
demand
.
a
grow
body
of
opinion
assert
that
we
can
become
self
-
sufficient
in
grain
production
.
we
must
examine
the
possibility
for
both
food
and
energy
production
in
the
future
.
we
must
become
part
of
the
scientific
analysis
that
seek
new
crop
variety
that
can
adapt
to
change
climactic
condition
.
we
have
to
encourage
a
slowdown
in
population
growth
globally
.
however
,
I
do
not
subscribe
to
the
Malthusian
analysis
that
population
growth
will
outstrip
agricultural
growth
because
regulation
and
rational
human
behaviour
can
keep
this
scenario
from
arise
.
we
have
to
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
if
the
price
of
oil
rise
further
it
will
make
fertiliser
and
transport
more
expensive
,
while
also
make
biofuel
crop
cultivation
more
profitable
.
in
the
past
year
alone
,
the
cost
of
food
in
this
country
have
risen
by
4.4
%
.
the
era
of
cheap
food
be
over
.
the
price
of
milk
and
flour
have
increase
by
16
and
17
%
respectively
.
if
we
be
to
get
the
equation
right
,
we
must
strike
a
balance
between
ensure
energy
supply
while
also
ensure
food
supply
.
the
flight
to
biofuel
must
not
come
at
the
expense
of
food
production
.
while
I
do
not
expect
much
from
this
government
,
future
government
will
have
to
regulate
human
behaviour
and
the
demand
for
energy
will
have
to
be
curb
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
reply
.
I
be
motivate
to
table
my
question
on
the
basis
of
the
grow
concern
that
food
price
inflation
be
increase
.
Christmas
be
approach
and
expenditure
on
food
be
quite
extensive
.
there
have
be
increase
in
the
range
of
16
%
to
17
%
in
respect
of
staple
such
as
milk
and
,
in
particular
,
flour
.
there
be
major
potential
for
growth
in
the
cereal
sector
to
meet
this
demand
.
I
accept
there
be
global
permutation
that
will
affect
how
matter
pan
out
for
the
industry
here
.
grain
farmer
want
to
see
a
increase
in
production
to
meet
domestic
demand
.
this
be
particularly
the
case
if
one
consider
the
rise
in
bio
-
fuel
production
.
my
question
inquire
about
the
practical
solution
the
government
will
be
put
in
place
to
facilitate
the
increase
trend
towards
the
cultivation
of
grain
.
I
have
not
receive
a
answer
in
that
regard
.
do
the
minister
of
State
refer
to
a
figure
of
€
10
million
?
the
Minister
of
State
also
refer
to
figure
of
1.355
%
and
1.53
%
in
respect
of
output
.
this
represent
minuscule
rate
of
increase
and
the
rate
of
inflation
in
respect
of
food
will
far
outstrip
they
.
I
suggest
that
that
rate
should
be
increase
considerably
to
meet
demand
.
on
the
CAP
health
check
,
on
the
Order
of
Business
yesterday
I
ask
for
a
debate
on
this
issue
on
the
basis
that
they
will
be
subject
to
the
co-decision
procedure
.
while
it
be
a
legislative
proposal
and
do
not
specifically
relate
to
the
House
,
it
have
major
potential
implication
,
both
positive
and
negative
,
for
we
agriculture
sector
and
the
rural
economy
.
will
the
minister
consider
arrange
a
full
debate
on
this
issue
,
notwithstanding
that
it
will
also
be
address
in
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
the
importance
of
this
issue
warrant
a
debate
.
I
have
already
raise
the
issue
with
my
party
whip
who
indicate
such
a
debate
would
be
unlikely
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
be
in
Germany
last
month
,
Mullingar
last
week
and
Wexford
this
week
and
will
,
I
understand
,
travel
to
Rome
next
week
.
he
be
increase
he
carbon
footprint
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
take
a
boat
to
Rome
.
I
thank
he
for
he
response
.
with
29
%
of
respondent
in
a
survey
indicate
a
willingness
to
purchase
local
food
,
it
be
clear
that
farmer
's
market
have
scope
to
tap
this
market
.
however
,
give
that
most
people
will
shop
at
one
of
the
multiple
,
it
be
necessary
to
target
this
food
retailer
.
while
the
work
be
do
by
Bord
Bia
be
without
equal
,
one
of
the
issue
to
arise
from
the
conference
hold
last
week
be
the
need
to
build
a
relationship
between
Bord
Bia
and
the
large
multiple
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
be
cognisant
of
this
when
formulate
government
policy
.
I
be
not
satisfied
with
that
answer
because
this
be
a
demand
-
lead
scheme
and
be
open
to
all
comer
.
if
somebody
get
a
application
in
on
time
it
be
as
valid
as
any
other
application
.
I
do
not
see
why
the
minister
can
discriminate
against
that
people
who
apply
within
that
timeframe
but
,
because
the
budget
line
be
suddenly
cut
,
be
not
to
be
consider
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
review
the
decision
on
the
basis
that
if
we
encounter
serious
change
in
agriculture
into
the
future
then
it
will
be
a
matter
for
farmer
to
improve
they
holding
and
they
facility
.
this
be
a
wonderful
scheme
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
achieve
but
there
should
be
more
flexibility
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
allow
at
least
that
people
who
get
in
before
the
cut
-
off
to
be
consider
.
the
word
"
review
"
be
a
very
broad
term
.
it
be
not
a
concrete
term
and
it
give
no
solace
to
that
farmer
who
apply
on
time
.
in
the
context
of
the
EU
CAP
health
check
,
will
any
measure
be
undertake
to
assist
organic
farmer
in
Ireland
?
when
funding
of
this
nature
be
allocate
to
grower
,
be
the
labour
inspectorate
involve
in
inspect
facility
where
the
potential
for
abuse
of
labour
standard
exist
?
give
that
money
be
expend
by
the
taxpayer
and
it
have
be
document
that
exploitation
have
take
place
within

the
Taoiseach
be
acknowledge
that
the
Labour
Party
position
be
correct
.
we
have
now
reach
a
point
where
people
have
lose
confidence
in
the
system
of
deliver
cancer
care
.
that
people
's
confidence
in
the
system
have
be
shake
to
its
foundation
be
put
it
mildly
.
that
thousand
of
woman
who
be
at
risk
of
breast
cancer
face
a
cloud
of
uncertainty
be
a
sad
indictment
of
the
government
.
that
a
committee
of
this
House
be
inform
by
the
HSE
that
97
woman
would
have
to
be
recall
for
test
before
the
woman
themselves
be
inform
speak
volume
.
that
this
woman
have
not
be
contact
personally
within
24
hour
be
nothing
short
of
a
scandal
.
when
Dr.
Peter
Naughton
tell
the
minister
in
2005
that
breast
cancer
service
at
Portlaoise
be
a
shamble
,
do
she
listen
to
he
concern
?
yes
,
she
do
.
do
she
act
in
a
manner
that
be
reflective
of
she
position
as
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
?
the
answer
be
"
no
"
.
if
the
answer
be
"
yes
"
,
the
minister
would
not
only
have
refer
the
matter
to
the
HSE
,
she
would
have
follow
this
issue
to
its
proper
conclusion
and
take
total
responsibility
.
that
conclusion
should
have
be
the
restoration
of
confidencein
a
system
upon
which
thousand
of
woman
rely
.
what
be
the
culture
that
now
pervade
the
politics
of
health
?
it
be
one
where
responsibility
be
pass
from
the
executive
to
the
bureaucracy
and
where
political
accountability
be
non-existent
.
the
minister
be
wrong
to
adopt
a
hand
-
off
approach
.
that
be
plainly
and
simply
wrong
.
a
minister
for
Health
and
Children
cannot
adopt
a
hand
-
off
approach
.
otherwise
,
Angola
will
surely
follow
.
if
this
motion
achieve
nothing
else
,
it
will
have
put
down
a
clear
marker
to
the
government
that
the
issue
of
political
accountability
must
be
place
at
centre
stage
in
term
of
health
care
facility
and
delivery
.
that
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
have
be
force
to
give
a
account
of
she
action
be
a
victory
for
political
accountability
and
for
that
woman
who
tonight
live
in
fear
for
they
future
and
that
of
they
family
.
no
long
will
the
people
of
this
country
endure
a
system
that
leave
no
person
or
organisation
accountable
for
the
lack
of
delivery
of
cancer
care
and
other
service
.
we
role
as
public
representative
of
the
people
must
be
respect
.
if
we
seek
answer
,
we
must
get
answer
,
not
carefully
word
attempt
to
dodgeball
the
issue
.
the
minister
should
not
take
we
for
fool
.
nor
should
she
take
the
woman
we
represent
for
fool
.
if
we
deem
it
necessary
to
seek
answer
on
behalf
of
the
countless
victim
of
the
current
health
care
regime
,
the
minister
must
respect
that
and
must
respond
in
kind
.
we
can
no
long
accept
a
lack
of
political
accountability
.
the
question
tonight
be
whether
the
minister
act
with
due
diligence
.
she
do
not

I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
.
in
recent
time
,
November
have
be
one
of
the
good
month
of
the
year
for
the
Minister
for
Finance
.
today
,
of
all
day
,
will
tell
a
different
story
.
the
serious
decline
in
the
housing
construction
market
clearly
confirm
the
continue
fall
in
Exchequer
receipt
from
tax
such
as
stamp
duty
.
exchequer
figure
for
November
show
that
total
tax
receipt
be
almost
€
2
billion
behind
the
target
set
out
in
last
year
's
budget
.
the
Department
of
Finance
signal
last
Friday
that
tax
collect
this
year
would
be
approximately
€
1.7
billion
below
target
.
what
will
today
's
budget
bring
and
what
will
be
the
minister
for
Finance
's
priority
for
the
economy
for
the
year
ahead
?
with
inflation
run
at
4.8
%
—
among
the
high
rate
in
Europe
—
the
scope
for
a
expansive
budget
be
limit
.
the
budget
be
very
relevant
to
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
there
be
not
a
great
deal
in
that
motion
with
which
I
disagree
.
the
issue
of
competitiveness
and
rise
labour
cost
be
key
driver
for
any
economic
outlook
.
the
budget
will
determine
whether
the
call
within
the
motion
will
bear
fruit
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Penrose
,
outline
a
number
of
fundamental
point
relate
to
the
lack
of
investment
in
infrastructure
and
issue
of
public
sector
pay
.
it
be
true
that
infrastructural
spending
in
this
country
be
well
below
par
.
there
may
have
be
serious
spending
on
inter-
urban
route
such
as
that
between
Cork
and
Dublin
,
but
there
be
still
regional
disparity
which
have
not
be
sort
out
.
how
long
do
it
take
a
train
to
get
from
Dublin
to
Sligo
?
if
a
burst
water
pipe
can
turn
Dublin
's
principal
motorway
into
a
car
park
for
eight
hour
,
then
what
can
we
seriously
expect
from
a
government
that
be
lung
from
one
crisis
to
another
?
there
be
secondary
and
non-national
road
throughout
this
island
that
be
rarely
travel
by
minister
,
and
that
eminent
backbencher
from
south
Kerry
himself
admit
that
if
there
be
a
pothole
to
be
fill
in
the
absence
of
the
Ceann
Comhairle
,
he
would
look
after
it
.
should
we
be
live
on
a
island
as
prosperous
as
this
with
even
one
pothole
to
we
name
in
this
day
and
age
?
the
fact
they
exist
at
all
be
a
testament
to
the
lack
of
investment
in
non-national
road
throughout
the
country
.
in
regard
to
broadband
,
there
be
part
of
north
Cork
where
people
be
still
diall
-
up
to
access
the
Internet
.
diall
up
in
2007
be
a
joke
.
data

by
the
European
Commission
show
that
in
2007
,
74
%
of

Netherlands

access
compare
with
31
%
in
Ireland
.
who
be
responsible
for
ensure
that
Ireland
meet
its
goal
of
become
what
the
government
call
a
"
world
-
class
knowledge
economy
"
in
just
over
five
year
?
how
can
we
compete
on
a
global
scale
if
the
roll
-
out
of
broadband
be
at
such
a
paltry
level
?
the
Fine
Gael
motion
call
on
the
government
to
take
necessary
action
on
public
sector
pay
.
it
be
difficult
to
comprehend
just
exactly
what
this
mean
.
the
vast
bulk
of
both
public
sector
and
private
sector
worker
be
operate
at
wage
level
that
keep
they
and
they
family
's
head
just
above
the
water
-
line
.
a
total
of
1.5
million
people
have
salary
worth
less
than
€
38000
.
to
survive
on
a
wage
of
€
38000
in
today
's
term
be
a
difficult
task
.
Real
people
operate
and
survive
within
this
bracket
,
but
they
be
under
pressure
in
this
society
.
they
mortgage
have
increase
and
they
have
borrow
to
meet
the
demand
of
day
to
day
living
.
they
be
overwork
,
overcharge
for
child
care
and
overstretched
.
they
average
basket
of
food
item
be
increase
at
a
rate
of
4
%
to
5
%
per
annum
.
person
on
this
income
bracket
can
ill
afford
to
absorb
such
increase
,
yet
they
be
the
back
-
bone
of
this
economy
.
today
the
minister
will
present
the
usual
budget
of
tax
and
social
welfare
change
.
he
must
look
at
this
income
bracket
and
provide
some
measure
of
relief
to
increase
real
income
to
offset
the
increase
cost
of
living
.
Fianna
Fáil
make
generous
election
promise
on
health
,
education
and
justice
with
more
teacher
,
more
gardaí
and
more
consultant
promise
.
today
will
tell
whether
the
minister
intend
to
fulfil
that
promise
.
there
be
a
nervousness
about
Ireland
's
economic
prospect
,
and
much
talk
of
a
tight
budget
.
this
motion
largely
address
that
concern
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
we
should
not
play
politics
with
the
economy
.
I
do
not
wish
to
score
point
,
but
I
do
want
to
remind
this
government
that
its
handling
of
the
economy
have
a
bear
on
people
's
job
and
they
mortgage
and
how
they
provide
for
they
family
.
in
support
the
spirit
of
this
motion
,
but
not
the
full
tenet
of
it
,
we
believe
it
be
the
role
of
a
opposition
to
contribute
constructively
on
how
to
maintain
economic
prosperity
and
further
economic
development
.
there
be
serious
issue
about
we
competitiveness
and
we
have
to
face
up
to
that
.
however
,
there
be
also
a
lot
that
be
positive
about
the
economy
.
in
that
respect
,
as
a
nation
we
need
to
focus
on
opportunity
.
the
economic
review
and
outlook
,
produce
by
the
Department
of
Finance
last
month
,
predict
that
the
economy
will
grow
by
about
3
%
next
year
.
it
be
not
what
we
would
want
but
it
be
growth
and
we
should
acknowledge
that
.
we
still
need
to
focus
on
the
possibility
.
growth
in
the
economy
be
no
long
drive
by
the
export
of
goods
.
however
,
growth
of
service
export
be
very
healthy
.
we
need
to
continue
the
focus
on
sector
such
as
sale
,
research
and
development
and
high
-
value
trade
service
.
we
need
to
ensure
,
not
just
that
we
invest
in
research
in
we
university
,
but
that
the
knowledge
be
generate
be
turn
into
commercial
activity
and
that
young
indigenous
company
survive
.
the
agricultural
sector
be
a
mainstay
of
we
economy
.
food
and
drink
export
account
for
over
€
8
billion
.
we
must
also
look
to
we
rural
economy
and
ensure
that
investment
continue
in
the
agri
-food
sector
.
we
ignore
the
potential
of
the
rural
economy
at
we
peril
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
must
continue
to
ensure
we
can
attract
foreign
investment
.
it
do
not
include
spending
on
non-national
road
either
.
the
measure
will
probably
have
a
positive
effect
in
so
far
as
it
will
discourage
potential
new
smoker
.
if
the
price
of
cigarette
be
prohibitive
,
it
would
probably
have
that
effect
.
however
,
if
one
be
a
commit
smoker
,
it
will
not
change
one
's
behaviour
at
all
.
if
it
be
propose
as
a
health
measure
,
the
government
must
look
at
the
issue
of
smoking
cessation
.
if
some
of
this
money
could
be
divert
to
smoking
cessation
measure
,
then
perhaps
it
would
be
see
as
a
more
productive
move
.
I
also
urge
the
government
to
look
at
nicotine
replacement
substance
,
such
as
gum
and
patch
,
which
be
very
prohibitively
price
.
they
sale
be
also
restrict
in
that
they
be
only
available
in
pharmacy
,
although
they
be
widely
available
in
supermarket
and
multiple
in
other
mainland
European
country
.
if
one
be
to
discourage
people
from
smoking
,
one
need
to
look
at
the
distribution
of
that
product
as
well
.
that
be
absolute
rubbish
.
will
deputy
Curran
please
stop
talk
rubbish
?
it
be
merely
talk
for
talk
's
sake
.
what
be
the
human
and
social
implication
?
there
be
a
generational
issue
at
play
here
.
if
people
only
recently
become
use
to
deal
with
cheque
transaction
,
they
can
not
now
be
penalise
.
it
be
easy
for
people
of
my
generation
and
that
which
immediately
precede
it
because
we
be
use
to
electronic
banking
,
on
-
line
banking
,
use
ATM
card
etc.
,
but
not
everybody
be
in
a
position
to
carry
on
they
affair
in
this
way
,
particularly
when
one
take
into
consideration
issue
such
as
numeracy
skill
and
people
's
ability
to
deal
with
technology
.
if
the
government
be
determined
to
encourage
people
to
begin
hide
cash
under
they
mattress
again
—
—
—
—
this
be
the
way
to
do
it
.
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
people
to
return
to
act
in
this
way
.
we
want
to
make
it
easy
for
they
to
make
transaction
.

problem
that
exist
for
the
IPU
.
he
state
:
"
the
Bill
before
we
today
be
,
in
effect
,
champion
price
fixing
,
which
be
a
serious
crime
carry
a
maximum
prison
sentence
of
five
year
"
.
this
give
rise
to
the
question
of
whether
the
Minister
of
State
have
decide
by
implication
that
the
general
medical
scheme
as
it
stand
be
administer
by
pharmacist
in
a
manner
that
be
not
in
keep
with
the
law
.
he
must
clarify
he
opinion
.
the
current
impasse
between
the
IPU
and
the
HSE
be
characterise
by
the
latter
seek
to
enforce
its
will
on
the
former
without
even
the
courtesy
or
corporate
social
responsibility
of
allow
negotiation
.
the
very
nature
of
this
unilateral
decision
to
slash
the
payment
make
by
the
HSE
to
pharmacist
for
the
purchase
of
medicine
will
undermine
the
viability
of
pharmacy
everywhere
.
I
do
not
speak
for
the
large
multiple
which
will
soak
up
the
reduction
in
margin
without
pain
but
for
community
base
and
family
run
pharmacy
which
have
a
wealth
of
knowledge
of
they
client
and
be
acutely
aware
of
the
intergenerational
health
issue
that
run
within
family
.
the
vast
majority
of
this
pharmacy
be
locate
in
rural
and
marginal
area
.
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
,
Mitchelstown
,
Youghal
,
Carrigtwohill
,
Cobh
and
Midleton
be
characterise
by
the
presence
of
independently
own
pharmacist
who
rely
heavily
on
the
general
medical
scheme
.
I
speak
for
that
who
may
have
take
over
a
pharmacy
from
a
parent
and
be
carry
on
a
proud
tradition
.
they
deserve
the
opportunity
to
at
least
negotiate
they
position
.
this
move
by
the
HSE
be
doll
up
as
reform
but
we
can
see
it
for
the
bullying
tactic
it
be
.
if
the
HSE
have
the
reform
zeal
it
purport
to
have
,
it
would
have
consult
the
pharmacist
prior
to
any
unilateral
move
.
that
be
why
we
be
seek
to
ensure
that
by
amend
the
Competition
Act
,
organisation
such
as
the
IPU
will
at
least
have
the
right
to
negotiate
a
position
that
will
not
leave
they
strand
on
this
or
any
other
issue
.
if
the
concept
of
engagement
and
social
partnership
be
to
mean
anything
,
the
government
will
at
least
afford
they
that
right
.
this
unilateral
action
by
the
Health
Service
executive
,
HSE
,
run
contrary
to
long
-
hold
belief
that
the
primacy
of
negotiation
with
any
representative
body
be
paramount
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
defend
that
right
.
it
extend
to
Blackpool
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
afford
I
this
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
I
wish
to
speak
about
the
urgent
need
for
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Science
to
address
the
serious
delay
in
grant
permission
to
St.
Mary
's
community
school
,
Buttevant
,
County
Cork
,
to
build
a
new
school
to
provide
for
a
increase
in
the
student
population
.
this
issue
have
be
ongoing
for
more
than
ten
year
.
it
be
last
raise
by
my
predecessor
and
late
father
in
April
2007
.
as
yet
,
no
progress
have
be
make
in
this
regard
.
the
staff
and
pupil
,
as
well
as
the
people
of
Buttevant
,
have
be
wait
for
ten
year
for
this
project
to
be
expedite
and
I
now
call
on
the
minister
to
tell
the
people
of
Buttevant
when
she
intend
to
notify
County
Cork
vocational
Education
Committee
of
she
approval
of
the
new
school
.
when
I
be
a
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
it
take
a
proactive
decision
to
rezone
land
for
the
purpose
of
designate
a
educational
site
to
provide
for
this
school
.
at
present
,
the
school
principal
and
that
who
be
involved
in
the
school
only
seek
the
appointment
of
a
design
team
to
enable
they
at
least
to
move
to
a
stage
from
which
progress
can
be
make
on
this
issue
.
the
school
itself
be
characterise
by
building
which
in
some
instance
date
back
to
pre-Famine
time
.
as
the
enrolment
have
increase
from
182
last
year
to
194
this
year
,
be
set
to
rise
by
at
least
a
further
ten
next
year
and
be
increase
on
a
yearly
basis
,
the
people
of
Buttevant
and
the
school
authority
wonder
when
the
Department
will
expedite
this
matter
.
the
layout
of
the
building
be
of
a
very
poor
standard
and
design
because
the
building
be
not
a
purpose
-
build
school
.
the
staffroom
be
very
cramped
and
there
be
no
sport
facility
.
the
school
be
oblige
to
use
the
local
GAA
facility
for
physical
education
and
other
sport
use
.
as
the
site
have
be
purchase
on
foot
of
the
rezoning
,
that
step
of
the
process
have
be
undertake
.
I
call
for
some
progress
on
this
matter
and
for
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Science
at
least
to
deliver
on
a
promise
and
commitment
to
the
people
of
Buttevant
because
the
population
of
Buttevant
and
the
school
's
catchment
area
be
increase
yearly
.
it
be
anticipate
that
Buttevant
's
location
on
a
main
national
primary
route
will
make
it
a
far
more
attractive
place
to
live
in
future
and
the
need
of
the
local
secondary
school
on
a
new
greenfield
site
must
be
meet
in
that
context
.
this
issue
have
be
ongoing
for
more
than
ten
year
and
the
people
of
Buttevant
and
of
north
Cork
wish
to
see
some
progress
in
this
regard
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
this
on
board
and
expedite
the
matter
and
bring
it
to
design
stage
in
2008
.
I
will
conclude
by
wish
the
Acting
Chairman
,
the
staff
and
member
all
the
good
for
the
season
and
for
2008
.
that
be
a
virtual
cut
and
paste
of

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
debate
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
construct
a
northern
relief
road
at
Mallow
,
County
Cork
,
and
the
urgent
question
why
the
notice
to
treat
be
not
serve
to
landowner
within
the
vicinity
of
the
project
and
why
the
NRA
have
postpone
this
project
again
.
today
I
receive
three
piece
of
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
office
regard
four
question
I
put
down
to
minister
,
three
of
which
,
relate
to
the
upkeep
of
the
N72
and
N73
road
in
County
Cork
,
be
disallow
on
the
basis
that
the
minister
have
no
official
responsibility
to
Dáil
Éireann
for
this
matter
,
which
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
National
Road
Authority

I
also
pose
a
question
to
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
about
Lombardstown
Post
Office
and
the
continuance
of
its
operation
and
,
again
,
I
be
tell
that
the

have
no

when
be
it
deem
possible
for

House
to
ask

he
or

feel
be
pertinent

the
running
of

constituency
and
be
important
enough
to
raise
on
the
floor
of
the

by
way
of
a
parliamentary
question
,
without
be
tell
it
be
a
operational
matter
not

for

be
it
now
the
case
that

that

as

there
be
measure
in
the
Finance
Bill
that
be
laudable
,
such
as
the
welcome
measure
to
encourage
company
to
invest
in
environmentally
-
friendly
equipment
.
the
measure
under
the
save
as
you
earn
scheme
be
also
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
the
health
measure
,
such
as
the
vat
reduction
on
non-oral
contraceptive
,
include
condom
,
do
not
go
far
enough
.
it
be
we
contention
that
the
minister
should
have
further
reduce
the
rate
to
5
%
,
in
line
with
the
EU
vat
directive
.
I
will
specifically
refer
to
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
.
the
minister
should
fix
indefinitely
2003
as
the
base
year
for
avail
of
the
tax
credit
.
the
Bill
,
as
I
understand
it
,
extend
the
base
year
of
2003
for
the
purpose
of
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
for
a
further
four
year
to
31
December
2013
.
however
,
the
Bill
provide
that
the
subsequent
year
's
expenditure
,
for
calculate
the
incremental
spend
,
will
be
the
ten
year
before
the
end
of
the
relevant
accounting
period
.
for
example
,
2014
will
have
a
base
year
of
2004
.
one
can
compare
this
to
the
UK
position
,
which
be
base
not
on
a
incremental
position
but
on
all
research
and
development
spend
.
this
give
the
UK
a
comparative
advantage
so
we
should
consider
adopt
this
approach
.
if
there
be
a
new
minister
of
State
responsible
for
innovation
policy
,
I
assume
the
government
be
give
the
notion
of
intellectual
policy
and
innovation
some
degree
of
stature
.
a
gesture
such
as
this
would
assist
many
company
and
enterprise
throughout
the
country
which
be
increasingly
endeavour
to
heighten
research
and
development
spend
.
consider
the
matter
vis
-à
-
vis
foreign
direct
investment
and
its
current
unstable
nature
,
we
will
have
to
rely
on
many
indigenous
industry
.
much
work
be
be
do
within

be

should
incentivise

possible

and
would
have

more
favourable
measure
.
I
will
comment
on
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
the
relevance
of
this
Bill
to
such
a
constituency
,
where
unemployment
figure
be
rise
.
it
have
be
prove
that
in
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
,
Mitchelstown
,
Cobh
and
Midleton
,
the
figure
be
go
up
year
on
year
.
the
current
Amgen
issue
—
—
I
have
a
answer
to
a
parliamentary
question
which
clearly
prove
the
unemployment
figure
be
rise
.
I
can
make
they
available
to
the
Minister
of
State
if
he
so
wish
.
we
be
currently
lose
job
in
Cork
East
.
we
have
lose
traditional
industry
and
,
for
example
,
the
food
industry
be
not
what
it
once
be
and
be
go
into
decline
.
Irish
Sugar
be
no
long
with
we
and
Dairygold
be
downsizing
its
operation
.
there
be
increase
uncertainty
about
Amgen
.
in
try
to
be
positive
about
how
we
proceed
economically
and
take
north
and
east
Cork
as
a
region
,
if
a
similar
situation
become
evident
,
we
will
have
to
rely
on
indigenous
industry
.
the
government
must
proactively
seek
to
upskill
that
people
work
within
exist
industry
and
introduce
some
measure
for
employer
to
enable
they
to
upskill
and
grow
exist
company
.
there
be
many
family
-
base
company
in
this
town
and
I
be
sure
they
could
do
with
some
incentivisation
to
grow
.
the
government
should
consider
the
issue
give
the
current
global
economic
climate
.
I
be
not
advocate
look
inward
but
we
can
start
think
more
locally
about
how
to
provide
incentive
to
grow
job
.
this
be
the
essential
point
I
have
seek
to
cover
.
I
would
have
like
the
Finance
Bill
to
provide
for
some
composite
scheme
like
the
town
renewal
or
urban
renewal
scheme
.
towns
such
as
Mitchelstown
,
Mallow
and
,
to
a
less
extent
,
Fermoy
be
still
characterise
by
certain
area
where
development
have
not
keep
pace
with
corresponding
development
on
the
outskirt
of
town
.
the
government
could
be
in
a
position
to
consider
some
urban
renewal
scheme
or
a
adjunct
to
the
exist
programme
.
I
realise
a
Goodbody
report
on
the
performance
of
the
urban
renewal
scheme
be
publish
which
indicate
a
slow
take
-
up
in
some
aspect
of
the
scheme
.
the
climate
be
right
for
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
and
Mitchelstown
to
benefit
from
that
scheme
so
we
could
get
rid
of
some
of
the
dereliction
still
exist
within
the
town
.
I
have
probably
use
much
less
than
11
minute
but
I
do
not
believe
in
fill
time
for
the
sake
of
it
.
I
have
cover
the
point
I
wish
to
make
and
other
which
I
could
expand
have
be
expound
upon
by
we
finance
spokesperson
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
take
my
comment
on
board
.
I
will
be
very
happy
to
make
the
figure
available
to
the
Minister
of
State
which
prove
beyond
any
doubt
that
unemployment
figure
have
increase
exponentially
in
this
town
.

I
thank
deputy
McManus
for
share
she
time
.
how
can
I
speak
for
Paul
Quinn
in
a
way
that
do
not
patronise
he
family
or
politicise
he
memory
?
how
can
I
,
who
do
not
know
he
personally
,
possibly
speak
in
a
manner
that
will
pay
adequate
tribute
to
he
independence
and
single
-
mindedness
that
ultimately
cost
he
he
life
?
I
can
only
speak
to
the
fact
that
neither
he
or
he
family
nor
the
community
of
Cullyhanna
have
receive
justice
.
if
we
be
to
subscribe
to
the
ideal
of
the
republic
and
all
the
belief
go
with
it
,
we
must
speak
up
for
Paul
Quinn
.
we
must
condemn
,
without
equivocation
,
he
murder
,
and
that
condemnation
must
come
from
all
facet
of
the
political
spectrum
.
if
there
be
that
who
seek
to
equivocate
,
they
must
reverse
they
position
.
if
this
island
,
which
have
leave
so
many
family
bereft
of
justice
,
be
to
move
on
we
must
hold
Paul
Quinn
up
as
a
example
that
justice
can
prevail
.
in
order
for
this
to
happen
,
that
in
the
shadow
must
be
root
out
and
take
responsibility
for
they
action
.
decision
on
any
necessary
action
to
be

by

Department
and

or
the
Commission
for
Energy
Regulation
as
a
consequence
of
any
change
to
the
UK
gas
regulatory
regime
will
be
take
in
the
context
of
the
publication
by
the
Office
of
Gas
and
electricity
Market
(
OFGEM
)
,
of
revise
proposal
to
the
current
regime
.
the
publication

proposal
be
await
.
OFGEM
be
the
Office
of
the

Market
,
which
support
the
Gas
and

Market
Authority
(
GEMA
)
,
the
regulator
of
the
gas
and
electricity
industry
in
great
Britain
.
on
10
July
2007
,
the
U.K.
's
Competition
Commission
(
CC
)
quash
a
decision
by
the
GEMA
to
reform
the
gas
offtake
regime
for
great
Britain
's
high
-
pressure
National
Transmission
System
.
the
principal
initiative
behind
OFGEM
's
proposal
be
the
creation
of
a
"
user
commitment
"
model
,
require
all
shipper
who
offtake
at
a
UK
gas
transmission
network
exit
point
to
secure
sufficient
capacity
to
meet
they
need
3
-
7
year
in
advance
.
this
would
have
result
in
a
number
of
change
to
the
Irish
market
with
regard
to
the
booking
of
gas
capacity
from
the
Moffat
exit
point
of
the
interconnector
between
Scotland
and
Ireland
.
the
decision
be
currently
be
reconsider
by
OFGEM
,
have
regard
to
the
Competition
Commission
's
view
,
and
I
be
advise
that
revise
exit
reform
proposal
be
likely
to
be
publish
in
the
near
future
.
in
the
meantime
,
while
await
OFGEM
's
final
decision
,
the
cer
,
support
by
my
Department
,
have
take
a
proactive
approach
to
this
matter
,
and
both
be
in
regular
contact
with
Bord
Gáis
Éireann
and
with
we
UK
counterpart
in
relation
to
it
.
I
be
always
willing
to
allow
deputy
Perry
some
latitude
.
I
will
address
my
remark
specifically
to
domiciliary
care
allowance
.
the
timeframe
for
deal
with
application
for
the
allowance
be
too
lengthy
and
cause
undue
hardship
for
that
apply
in
respect
of
minor
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
in
the
HSE
south
area
expenditure
on
supplementary
welfare
allowance
which
form
part
of
the
rent
supplement
scheme
amount
to
€
43.56
million
in
2005
,
€
46.30
million
in
2006
and
€
49.21
million
in
2007
.
annual
increase
in
expenditure
in
this
area
would
be
unwarranted
if
the
government
be
do
its
job
and
deliver
a
adequate
social
housing
programme
.
every
year
the
number
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
who
contact
I
grow
exponentially
.
Rent
supplement
be
directly
link
to
the
increase
in
the
number
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
and
continue
to
cost
the
State
exorbitant
amount
every
year
.
the
money
expend
under
the
scheme
be
pocket
by
landlord
.
if
a
adequate
programme
for
deal
with
social
housing
be
in
place
,
the
expenditure
allocate
to
rent
supplement
could
be
redirect
to
more
needy
section
of
society
.
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
be
one
way
of
supplant
the
rent
supplement
scheme
.
my
party
advocate
a
"
begin
to
buy
"
approach
which
would
allow
more
people
to
move
from
social
housing
onto
the
housing
ladder
.
we
need
more
join
-
up
think
on
this
issue
.
while
the
supplementary
welfare
scheme
may
be
a
necessary
mechanism
in
the
short
term
,
we
must
examine
the
reason
expenditure
on
it
be
increase
every
year
.
more
and
more
people
be
be
force
onto
social
housing
waiting
list
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
I
have
be
inform
by
my
Department
that
compulsory
purchase
order
power
have
not
be
use
in
the
Department
from
2005
to
date
.

the

network
section

HSE
south
,
when
ask
to
provide
specifics
in
reply
to
question
I
have
pose
to
the
minister
,
respond
with
generality
which
leave
we
none
the
wise
.
I
have
tab
numerous
question
to
the
minister
on
the
future
of
the
hospital
,
the
appointment
of
a
executive
management
structure
,
the
appointment
of
a
radiologist
,
casemix
,
and
the
appointment
of
a
radiographer
to
oversee
the
ct
scanner
that
have
be
sit
in
a
empty
room
for
year
.
on
the
issue
of
casemix
,
I
refer
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
400
on
30
January
2008
,
where
the
HSE
in
response
to
my
question
on
the
€
500000
cut
to
the
hospital
budget
state
:
Mallow
General
Hospital
have
receive
a
negative
casemix
adjustment
of
€
571233
for
2008
(
which
be
base
on
2006
activity
)
.
management
at
the
hospital
be
examine
the
underlying
cause
of
the
negative
casemix
adjustment
for
2008
and
a
rigorous
scrutiny
of
the
hospital
's
base
cost
will
be
carry
out
.
MGH
's
budget
have
be
cut
because
the
workload
of
the
hospital
have
be
under
measure
through
casemix
because
of
a
lack
of
clerical
staff
,
but
it
do
not
suit
the
HSE
to
admit
this
.
I
have
it
on
good
authority
that
only
95
%
of
MGH
's
workload
be
capture
.
the
HSE
's
official
line
be
that
the
budget
be
cut
because
of
"
inefficiency
"
.
nobody
dispute
that
MGH
's
budget
be
the
low
in
the
country
or
that
its
workload
be
great
than
many
comparable
hospital
.
how
be
it
then
that
its
budget
be
cut
?
I
refer
to
the
appointment
of
a
executive
management
board
.
why
have
Bantry
hospital
,
with
a
small
catchment
area
than
Mallow
,
a
emb
?
I
applaud
Bantry
hospital
in
this
regard
but
it
be
lucky
.
the
answer
I
receive
be
a
insult
to
the
people
I
represent
.
I
refer
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
119
of
31
January
2008
,
in
which
I
ask
about
the
make
up
and
reintroduction
of
the
executive
management
structure
.
in
its
reply
,
the
HSE
state
that
management
of
both
the
Cork
University
Hospital
group
and
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
keen
to
enhance
the
management
structure
at
the
hospital
and
have
over
the
past
several
month
be
work
with
the
HSE
's
performance
and
development
unit
to
facilitate
the
process
of
establish
a
executive
management
board
at
Mallow
hospital
.
it
continue
that
key
stakeholder
have
be
meet
on
a
one
-
to
-
one
basis
to
explore
concern
,
expectation
,
vision
for
the
future
and
development
need
,
that
discussion
be
ongoing
and
that
a
proposal
to
re-establish
the
executive
management
board
at
the
hospital
be
currently
be
finalise
.
accord
to
the
HSE
,
the
review
have
take
slightly
long
than
anticipate
because
its
scope
be
broaden
to
incorporate
community
-
base
service
and
to
allow
wide
consultation
with
key
stakeholder
,
include
medical
staff
from
the
Mallow
catchment
area
.
again
,
the
HSE
speak
in
generality
but
be
short
on
specifics
.
it
fail
to
acknowledge
that
a
executive
management
board
be
in
place
Mallow
General
Hospital
which
cease
to
operate
and
be
never
replace
.
as
for
its
assertion
that
there
be
a
consultation
with
key
stakeholder
,
this
be
stretch
the
truth
.
I
can
name
95
gps
who
be
key
stakeholder
in
the
area
but
be
never
consult
.
I
know
of
nobody
in
community
-
base
service
who
be
consult
.
which
key
stakeholder
and
medical
staff
from
the
Mallow
catchment
area
be
consult
?
what
do
the
HSE
regard
as
the
Mallow
catchment
area
?
in
the
same
reply
,
the
HSE
state
that
the
acute
hospital
service
review
in
HSE
south
will
determine
overall
governance
arrangement
.
to
whom
have
the
proposal
for
a
executive
management
board
for
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
send
?
on
the
issue
of
the
ct
scanner
,
which
be
also
address
in
the
reply
,
if
the
HSE
see
the
benefit
of
the
scanner
,
why
do
it
not
put
a
proper
management
plan
in
place
in
2005
?
we
be
concerned
for
the
future
of
the
hospital
and
that
the
acute
hospital
review
will
seek
to
downgrade
we
accident
and
emergency
service
,
postpone
further
appointment
when
current
surgical
term
of
employment
end
and
further
delay
the
building
of
a
day
procedure
unit
.
we
want
to
see
the
appointment
of
a
radiographer
because
we
have
wait
too
long
for
one
.
we
want
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
be
a
centre
of
excellence
for
secondary
care
.
we
be
proud
of
we
Hospital
.
if
the
HSE
persist
in
downgrade
the
hospital
by
stealth
,
we
will
protest
vigorously
.

let
we
consider
the
impending
review
of
acute
hospital
.
give
that
hospital
such
as
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
which
be
currently
be
downgrade
by
stealth
,
be
anxiously
await
this
review
,
will
it
give
rise
to
a
legislative
procedure
?
in
some
respects
the
issue
have
move
on
since
the
question
be
tab
.
however
,
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
as
soon
as
this
issue
come
to
light
,
both
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
and
she
Department
take
a
highly
proactive
approach
in
respect
of
reps
2
and
reps
3
.
be
there
a
definite
timeframe
in
which
a
decision
will
be
make
on
the
outcome
regard
payment
under
the
REPS
4
scheme
?
I
understand
negotiation
be
ongoing
at
present
and
I
take
cognisance
of
the
sensitivity
associate
therein
.
however
,
I
would
appreciate
the
provision
by
the
minister
of
a
approximate
timeframe
to
member
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
as
a
general
point
,
this
be
a
vital
scheme
and
the
income
derive
from
it
by
farmer
be
essential
to
they
.
if
the
minister
have
any
scope
to
have
the
Irish
model
adopt
throughout
the
European
Union
,
it
will
be
very
positive
for
agriculture
in
Ireland
and
the
Union
.
she
might
take
this
on
board
.
he
will
have
to
get
a
financial
statement
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
there
be
retrospective
testing
since
November
2007
,
but
subsequently
the
commission
regulation
allow
for
importation
from
previously
susceptible
area
.
to
my
mind
,
notwithstand
the
level
of
co-operation
with
the
Northern
Ireland
Minister
for
Agriculture
and
rural
Development
,
that
imply
the
risk
still
exist
—
and
if
testing
be
occur
post
-
import
,
the
disease
might
be
detect
.
be
the
minister
satisfied
that
every
beast
will
be
test
on
importation
to
offset
the
risk
and
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
commission
regulation
—
notwithstand
Ireland
's
position
—
have
go
against
we
?
the
relevant
deputy
will
be
very
impressed
.
what
we
be
see
be
a
consolidation
of
the
grower
.
many
small
grower
be
be
squeeze
and
the
government
need
to
take
action
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
local
producer
.
the

in
the
five
minute
allocate
to
I
I
will
do
my
good
to
cover
the
issue
I
feel
be
pertinent
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
motion
and
to
support
it
unequivocally
.
I
wish
to
address
a
number
of
general
point
relate
to
the
national
broadband
scheme
,
the
lack
of
roll
-
out
of
broadband
to
rural
area
and
the
need
for
the
government
to
adopt
a
universal
service
obligation
similar
to
that
which
exist
for
postal
and
telephony
service
.
with
regard
to
a
universal
service
obligation
,
on
7
February
last
I
receive
a
letter
from
the
Commission
for
Communication
Regulation
follow
representation
by
I
on
the
issue
of
inadequate
or
no
broadband
provision
in
village
such
as
Ballyhooly
and
Glanworth
.
I
speak
of
this
village
because
they
be
typical
of
many
rural
area
throughout
the
country
.
I
be
tell
in
this
letter
that
ComReg
impose
certain
obligation
on
Eircom
but
this
obligation
stretch
only
to
the
rights
of
a
citizen
to
a
functional
telephone
line
,
capable
of
carry
voice
and
datum
over
28.8
kbit
.
while
this
obligation
might
have
satisfied
the
Ireland
of
20
or
even
ten
year
ago
,
it
no
long
go
far
enough
in
term
of
provide
adequate
telecomumication
to
the
Ireland
of
today
.
Universal
service
obligation
broadband
must
be
enshrine
in
legislation
as
a
entitlement
.
the
politician
of
my
parent
's
generation
make
representation
on
matter
relate
to
the
provision
of
telephone
when
no
one
could
get
access
to
a
telephone
line
.
politician
of
my
generation
make
representation
on
the
issue
of
broadband
,
when
part
of
this
country
be
bereft
of
what
be
now
consider
a
essential
service
.
that
people
of
my
generation
be
be
tell
that
next
generation
network
be
be
roll
out
when
people
live
beyond
the
Pale
be
still
use
dial
-
up
and
can
only
rely
on
that
narrow
bandwidth
be
a
joke
when
the
average
modem
for
a
computer
be
56
kbit
.
a
regional
disparity
exist
and
it
have
a
negative
effect
both
socially
and
economically
for
that
live
in
rural
area
which
be
not
cover
.
the
admission
by
ComReg
that
a
universal
service
obligation
apply
under
EU
regulation
only
for
the
provision
of
telephone
and
not
in
respect
of
broadband
bely
a
serious
flaw
in
the
system
.
every
citizen
should
have
a
entitlement
to
broadband
in
the
same
way
they
have
entitlement
to
a
operational
phone
line
.
consequently
,
I
propose
a
review
similar
to
that
carry
out
by
the
European
Commission
in
2005
which
would
result
in
a
legislative
change
and
give
a
voice
to
the
thousand
of
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
deny
access
to
what
be
a
essential
service
by
today
's
standard
.
the
broadband
availability
map
find
on
the
Department
's
website
simply
do
not
reflect
the
situation
on
the
ground
.
I
would
go
so
far
as
to
state
the
map
be
largely
a
work
of
fiction
and
so
would
many
of
my
constituent
.
there
be
a
glaring
disparity
between
that
who
will
eventually
be
able
to
avail
of
the
next
-
generation
network
and
other
,
many
of
whom
I
represent
in
a
mix
urban
and
rural
constituency
,
who
must
still
dial
up
for
internet
access
.
there
be
a
inequality
at
play
here
.
the
criterion
lay
down
in
the
national
broadband
scheme
must
ensure
there
be
100
%
broadband
coverage
.
the
minister
must
ensure
that
white
area
depict
no
coverage
on
the
departmental
map
will
have
broadband
access
by
June
2008
.
Broadband
access
be
a
right
in
today
's
Ireland
.
the
delivery
of
commitment
by
a
Post
in
regard
to
access
issue
at
company
-
own
post
office
be
a
operational
matter
for
the
board
and
management
of
a
Post
and
one
in
which
I
have
no
statutory
function
.

I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
timely
debate
,
recognise
that
deputy
Crawford
seek
its
instigation
.
in
term
of
the
minister
's
contribution
,
I
be
reassure
.
it
be
the
first
time
in
my
experience
that
we
have
have
such
a
comprehensive
outline
of
the
Irish
position
vis
-à
-
vis
the
negotiation
,
and
I
be
reassure
by
the
fact
that
there
be
a
very
strong
Irish
position
,
one
that
seek
to
protect
the
national
interest
.
the
very
term
''
national
interest
''
appear
to
have
come
into
fashion
again
,
because
there
be
clear
trend
in
how
Ireland
's
term
of
trade
have
be
affect
,
or
potentially
may
be
,
by
any
deal
negotiate
by
Mr.
Mandelson
,
purportedly
on
we
behalf
.
this
could
,
however
,
be
detrimental
ultimately
to
Irish
agriculture
and
Ireland
's
interest
.
I
be
heartened
that
the
minister
and
she
official
be
sceptical
and
have
express
caution
about
the
concessionary
approach
of
the
commission
in
its
approach
to
the
negotiation
.
it
would
appear
that
Mr.
Mandelson
's
negotiating
position
have
be
further
weaken
by
criticism
by
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
to
the
effect
that
the
European
Union
be
make
too
many
concession
on
agriculture
.
it
would
appear
,
too
,
from
the
minister
's
statement
that
the
Irish
and
French
position
be
as
one
in
this
regard
.
it
beg
the
question
as
to
how
many
other
member
state
hold
a
similar
position
and
whether
Commissioner
Mandelson
's
mandate
have
be
overstepp
.
as
deputy
Creed
state
,
it
be
a
question
of
determine
whether
the
commissioner
's
mandate
should
be
review
on
the
basis
that
the
potential
for
Irish
agriculture
be
be
undermine
seriously
by
he
current
negotiating
stance
.
the
response
of
the
EU
Commissioner
for
External
Trade
to
the
remark
of
President
Sarkozy
be
that
he
hand
be
tie
by
that
in
emerge
nation
who
want
concession
on
industrial
goods
or
non-agricultural
market
access
.
if
President
Sarkozy
be
sceptical
or
critical
,
it
do
not
bide
well
for
the
next
ministerial
round
,
especially
give
he
comment
that
he
would
oppose
any
WTO
deal
that
go
against
the
interest
of
France
and
the
27
-
nation
European
Union
,
especially
in
respect
of
agriculture
.
Agriculture
,
therefore
,
remain
a
stumble
block
to
a
deal
.
ironically
,
it
be
perhaps
fortuitous
that
the
French
position
be
strong
because
I
hope
it
will
favour
Ireland
in
the
final
outcome
.
it
would
appear
that
talk
be
not
move
quickly
enough
for
the
United
State
,
whose
representative
be
warning
against
what
Ambassador
Schwab
,
the
US
Trade
Representative
,
be
call
a
"
erosion
"
of
willingness
by
some
nation
to
open
they
market
to
more
import
farm
goods
.
the
agricultural
issue
seem
to
have
reach
a
impasse
.
my
understanding
of
this
development
be
that
future
success
will
be
base
on
the
so
-
call
Doha
round
of
world
trade
talk
,
allow
for
great
market
access
for
agriculture
in
particular
.
the
big
question
will
be
whether
there
can
be
enough
progress
to
allow
a
ministerial
meeting
in
late
March
,
April
or
even
late
to
agree
on
the
outline
of
a
deal
,
give
that
the
Doha
round
be
launch
in
2001
and
be
expect
to
last
approximately
four
year
.
it
be
clear
from
the
US
perspective
that
there
be
a
clear
mood
in
favour
of
the
liberalisation
of
agriculture
.
the
US
trade
representative
,
have
state
a
agreement
on
freer
agricultural
trade
be
essential
if
there
be
to
be
a
Doha
pact
.
the
US
position
be
predicate
on
a
liberalisation
agenda
include
the
European
Union
,
by
way
of
Mr.
Mandelson
advocate
a
similar
line
.
this
involve
the
European
Union
reduce
its
subsidy
in
exchange
for
expand
access
to
market
in
third
country
and
develop
country
in
particular
.
to
be
frank
,
the
Mandelson
agenda
be
detrimental
to
both
Irish
agriculture
and
agriculture
in
develop
country
.

for

,

and

"
.
it
seek
recognition
for
non-trade
concern
.
I
remain
sceptical
about
the
EU
position
on
non-trade
concern
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
current
deliberation
that
would
give
solace
to
any
Irish
farmer
compete
in
the
dairy
and
beef
sector
who
fear
the
flooding
of
the
Irish
and
EU
market
with
import
that
be
not
subject
to
the
same
standard
that
apply
within
the
EU
Internal
Market
.
the
EU
position
,
as
adopt
by
Commissioner
Mandelson
,
be
nebulous
.
the
IFA
,
in
its
paper
,
meeting
the
Challenge
of
WTO
and
cap
Reform
,
rightly
reflect
the
concern
of
consumer
regard
"
the
double
standard
between
that
which
Irish
and
other
European
farmer
have
to
meet
on
food
safety
,
[
and
]
traceability
...
and
the
much
low
standard
apply
to
food
import
into
the
EU
"
.
it
must
be
state
this
be
a
rational
concern
predicate
on
a
genuine
fear
that
we
standard
of
production
will
be
trade
away
to
meet
a
agenda
that
do
nothing
to
protect
we
interest
and
concession
,
which
have
be
hard
win
through
cap
negotiation
for
year
.
it
must
also
be
state
that
the
United
State
be
champion
the
liberalisation
of
agricultural
trade
,
target
in
particular
the
elimination
of
export
subsidy
and
substantial
improvement
in
market
access
.
one
analysis
of
the
US
position
be
that
it
be
weaken
by
the
large
increase
in
domestic
support
the
US
be
pay
to
its
farmer
"
and
by
doubt
over
whether
the
political
support
exist
in
Congress
to
face
down
its
own
farm
lobby
and
embrace
far
-
reach
reform
"
.
the
Doha
agenda
be
unpopular
and
there
be
question
mark
over
whether
the
end
of
the
Bush
regime
in
the
Unite
State
will
signal
any
mood
for
a
deal
in
advance
of
a
new
President
be
appoint
.
the
Irish
farming
position
be
characterise
by
genuine
fear
about
cut
to
beef
and
dairy
tariff
.
it
be
a
question
of
whether
there
be
enough
support
evident
at
Council
of
Minister
level
for
such
a
cut
and
of
the
consequence
for
the
Irish
position
.
this
have
be
outline
clearly
today
.
the
Irish
and
French
position
be
very
clear
but
one
must
ask
whether
there
be
a
sufficient
block
majority
to
alter
the
EU
Commission
's
position
on
the
protection
of
agriculture
in
Ireland
and
other
country
.
arguably
,
Ireland
be
a
small
peripheral
nation
in
the
negotiation
and
it
rely
on
the
trading
bloc
represent
by
the
European
Commission
.
however
,
if
the
French
position
be
similar
to
we
own
—
I
realise
there
will
be
subtle
difference
—
we
need
to
form
a
alliance
.
the
question
remain
as
to
whether
the
trading
bloc
in
the
European
Union
be
sufficiently
large
to
force
Commissioner
Mandelson
's
hand
on
the
matter
.
I
remain
sceptical
because
he
have
already
receive
he
mandate
,
but
I
hope
it
can
be
reverse
in
some
respects
.
while
guarantee
food
security
for
EU
citizen
be
a
priority
and
while
this
can
well
be
achieve
through
a
combination
of
support
EU
food
production
and
through
importation
set
in
the
framework
of
the
WTO
rule
,
food
security
also
depend
on
the
European
Union
's
contribution
to
the
building
up
of
world
stock
,
which
be
dramatically
low
,
and
allow
the
European
Union
not
only
to
protect
itself
against
shortage
,
but
also
to
take
responsibility
with
regard
to
global
food
security
.
such
importation
,
however
,
must
be
subject
to
the
same
standard
that
Irish
farmer
adhere
to
,
and
there
can
be
no
trade
-
off
or
concession
on
this
matter
.
in
any
quest
to
impose
liberalisation
of
the
regime
,
equality
in
term
of
trade
and
standard
must
apply
.
in
that
context
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
need
to
protect
the
farmer
of
Europe
,
include
Irish
farmer
,
against
a
liberalisation
agenda
that
will
ultimately
compromise
the
Irish
comparative
advantage
in
the
beef
and
dairy
sector
and
will
add
nothing
of
value
to
develop
country
's
term
of
trade
.
perhaps
my
assessment
of
the
current
WTO
deliberation
be
open
to
debate
,
but
it
seem
to
I
that
the
Irish
farming
position
be
not
too
dissimilar
to
that
of
develop
country
in
its
opposition
to
the
current
round
,
albeit
for
entirely
different
reason
.
ultimately
,
we
must
protect
Irish
agriculture
and
allow
for
a
opening
up
of
market
for
third
country
.
however
,
if
there
be
to
be
any
doubt
about
the
future
and
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
,
and
if
the
propose
tariff
cut
be
make
,
notwithstand
Commissioner
Mandelson
's
association
with
a
sister
party
of
mine
—
I
disown
he
current
policy
in
this
regard
—
there
should
be
no
deal
and
no
compromise
on
this
issue
.
in
the
time
available
it
have
not
be
possible
to
clarify
and
assemble
all
of
the
information
request
.
I
will
revert

I

the

.
I
thank
deputy
Lynch
for
she
excellent
time

.
I
hope
what
I
have
to

will
be
equally
and
not

than
what
she
say
in
she
contribution
.
the
government
state
last
night
,
in
the
course
of
this
debate
,
that
in
2008
the
Department
of
Education
and
Science
will
pay
€
167
million
to
primary
school
to
cover
day
-
to
-
day
running
cost
and
that
a
€
21
increase
to
€330
per
pupil
mean
primary
school
receive
unprecedented
level
of
funding
per
pupil
to
meet
running
cost
.
this
bely
a
fundamental
lack
of
understanding
of
the
true
nature
of
educational
provision
as
we
citizen
understand
it
,
as
the
parent
understand
it
,
and
as
the
principal
and
teacher
understand
it
.
when
a
parent
send
a
child
to
school
,
a
unwritten
social
contract
that
be
enshrine
within
the
Irish
psyche
be
enter
into
that
the
child
will
receive
the
good
education
possible
.
that
social
contract
be
not
on
the
basis
that
the
parent
must
also
fundraise
,
take
part
in
raffle
,
sing
karaoke
,
hillwalk
,
play
bingo
and
join
in
pub
quizze
so
that
the
child
can
have
the
benefit
of
water
,
electricity
and
a
myriad
other
service
within
they
school
.
in
real
economic
term
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
school
have
increase
considerably
in
recent
year
and
the
burden
now
face
by
school
to
meet
this
additional
cost
ultimately
place
a
further
financial
strain
on
parent
of
child
who
find
themselves
fundraising
for
school
on
a
constant
basis
.
Educational
provision
should
not
have
to
be
subject
to
this
form
of
pressure
.
it
be
enough
for
any
school
in
this
time
to
have
to
educate
and
educate
alone
.
that
in
itself
remain
the
fundamental
challenge
and
,
arguably
,
it
should
be
the
only
challenge
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
government
have
increase
the
capitation
grant
since
1997
.
however
,
by
double
the
capitation
grant
now
,
it
do
not
have
to
come
at
the
expense
of
provide
extra
teacher
,
a
theory
which
have
be
posit
elsewhere
in
this
debate
,
and
somewhat
disingenuously
.
the
logic
of
we
position
be
to
ensure
that
the
headache
of
maintenance
and
run
cost
be
take
away
from
all
school
so
that
they
can
concentrate
on
provide
education
and
continue
,
in
certain
instance
,
to
do
battle
with
the
minister
on
the
capital
programme
for
the
provision
of
adequate
school
building
in
place
such
as
Castlelyons
,
Rahan
,
Grange
and
Midleton
where
no
proper
building
have
be
provide
for
considerable
period
.
not
only
have
school
to
raise
fund
,
they
also
be
operate
in
substandard
building

I
welcome
the
reply
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
my
response
will
be
very
brief
.
do
the
feps
encourage
the
growth
of
native
woodland
?
will
the
minister
of
State
potentially
consider
a
additional
premium
for
that
farmer
,
landowner
or
forestry
owner
who
wish
to
grow
more
forestry
on
the
basis
that
it
would
reduce
co2
emission
for
this
country
?
perhaps
a
additional
premium
could
be
give
to
that
farmer
who
be
not
already
grow
forestry
but
who
may
potentially
embark
on
grow
it
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
but
there
be
potential
to
give
a
further
premium
purely
on
the
basis
there
be
room
to
have
carbon
off
-
setting
,
for
want
of
a
good
expression
.
there
be
major
scope
for
the
private
sector
to
become
involved
in
forestry
.
as
I
understand
it
,
to
date
there
be
less
than
20
%
involvement
of
the
private
sector
in
forestry
and
it
be
a
area
of
agribusiness
that
have
even
more
potential
.
I
be
not
convince
the
€
7600
per
hectare
payment
,
the
maximum
,
be
adequate
give
that
one
would
have
to
operate
on
large
economy
of
scale
in
order
to
get
some
sort
of
a
decent
return
.
many
small
forestry
owner
do
not
currently
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
thin
back
forest
to
allow
for
great
potential
.
the
cost
of
thinning
and
maintenance
would
eat
into
the
premium
.
we
be
try
to
make
a
case
,
in
essence
,
for
more
grant
aid
or
financial
incentive
to
be
provide
.
will
the
minister
of
State
consider
that
?
perhaps
we
should
consult
the
church
on
this
matter
.
it
be
a
ecumenical
matter
.
that
be
a
cod
if
I
ever
hear
one
.
it
be
rubbish
.
I
suppose
the
Minister
of
State
's
next
press
release
will
be
expound
the
virtue
of
organic
manure
.
the
chicken
be
come
home
to
roost
follow
the
loss
of
IFI
,
which
have
result
in
increase
cost
for
import
fertiliser
.
we
do
not
know
the
exact
content
of
fertiliser
import
from
third
country
because
there
be
no
policing
of
urea
and
other
content
.
the
Department
should
put
in
place
some
policing
mechanism
to
ensure
the
content
be
what
it
say
on
the
tin
.
this
have
permutation
for
grower
and
crop
production
generally
.
what
about
third
country
?
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
reduce
to
two
from
three
the
number
of
consultant
operate
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
result
in
a
dramatic
reduction
in
surgical
service
from
seven
day
to
five
day
with
the
further
increase
in
the
workload
of
Cork
University
Hospital
;
and
the
need
to
debate
the
fact
that
this
decision
be
take
without
prior
consultation
with
staff
at
either
hospital
,
the
net
result
be
a
increase
in
number
present
to
CUH
,
which
be
ill
-
equip
to
deal
with
the
increase
throughput
,
and
the
potential
increase
in
the
danger
to
that
serve
in
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.

pertinent
that
Opposition
Member
would
hold
the
government
to
account
on
its
position
vis-à
-
vo
the
WTO
negotiation
and
that
the
government
would
not
take
any
pertinent
question
from
this
side
of
the
House
as
a
slight
,
give
that
we
all
have
as
we
good
interest
the
future
interest
of
Irish
agriculture
and
Irish
agribusiness
.
by
way
of
response
to
the
speech
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Coughlan
,
I
wish
to
clear
up
the
notion
that
she
seem
to
convey
on
the
issue
of
the
single
farm
payment
.
it
be
we
clear
understanding
that
to
convey
the
impression
somehow
that
the
single
farm
payment
will
be
undermine
and
that
she
be
endeavour
to
save
they
under
the
WTO
agreement
under
the
green
box
issue
,
be
something
of
a
misnomer
.
my
understanding
be
that
they
be
not
part
of
the
WTO
negotiation
in
any
event
and
to
say
they
be
convey
the
wrong
impression
.
the
fundamental
question
that
we
must
ask
ourselves
today
be
what
the
Doha
Round
will
mean
for
Irish
agriculture
and
for
farm
family
who
form
the
bedrock
of
we
rural
society
.
the
WTO
be
inform
by
a
modus
operandi
that
seek
,
with
the
World
Bank
and
the
IMF
,
a
global
market
devoid
of
trade
barrier
.
since
2001
,
at
Doha
,
the
WTO
have
embark
on
a
strategy
of
liberalisation
of
global
trade
result
in
a
view
,
by
country
such
as
we
own
and
,
I
might
add
,
poorer
country
,
that
the
indiscriminate
liberalisation
agenda
will
be
detrimental
to
we
interest
and
the
interest
of
poorer
country
seek
to
raise
they
economic
output
.
for
the
purpose
of
analyse
the
government
's
amendment
to
this
motion
,
there
be
absolutely
nothing
in
its
response
that
would
give
solace
to
the
thousand
of
farmer
who
today
have
to
leave
they
homestead
in
the
quest
to
have
they
voice
hear
.
we
critique
of
the
current
Doha
round
be
simple
.
the
WTO
be
not
on
the
correct
path
to
deliver
worldwide
economic
prosperity
.
it
will
not
raise
the
economic
tide
of
all
comer
and
,
from
this
island
's
point
of
view
,
will
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
rural
economy
and
agricultural
sector
.
moreover
,
it
will
decimate
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
to
which
we
all
subscribe
and
which
have
be
negotiate
by
a
process
of
pool
sovereignty
of
EU
member
state
through
many
year
of
diplomacy
.
all
of
we
recognise
the
primacy
of
agricultural
negotiation
and
this
sector
have
become
a
easy
target
for
the
EU
Commission
in
its
quest
to
gain
concession
on
a
neoliberal
trade
agenda
because
of
the
subsidisation
of
agriculture
.
we
view
be
simple
.
to
use
develop
country
as
a
bargain
chip
to
unravel
CAP
be
a
disingenuous
argument
and
one
to
which
we
do
not
subscribe
.
it
be
we
analysis
that
concession
will
be
fight
for
on
agricultural
issue
as
a
substitute
for
agreement
on
the
liberalisation
of
service
.
develop
country
rightly
argue
that
it
be
unfair
to
expect
they
to
open
they
market
on
service
while
clear
barrier
to
entry
exist
amongst
developed
country
on
the
provision
of
service
.
the
key
worry
for
service
liberalisation
be
what
it
mean
for
the
ability
to
regulate
foreign
service
-
base
company
operate
in
less
developed
region
.
furthermore
,
the
availability
of
micro-credit
in
Africa
have
have
the
positive
effect
of
lift
ten
of
million
of
small
farmer
out
of
poverty
.
a
agrarian
revolution
be
take
place
in
Africa
about
which
one
will
not
hear
on
radio
or
tv
.
we
concern
be
that
the
growth
of
urban
population
in
Africa
,
which
be
feed
through
the
rural
African
economy
,
may
be
compromise
in
the
quest
to
achieve
a
rate
of
liberalisation
,
which
may
be
detrimental
to
they
economic
interest
.
therein
lie
the
comparison
with
the
Irish
farmer
.
while
the
Irish
farmer
rely
on
the
subsidisation
of
agriculture
,
the
African
farmer
rely
on
a
new
system
of
micro-credit
which
may
allow
he
to
survive
,
and
even
in
time
,
flourish
.
in
that
context
,
Ireland
and
develop
country
be
unite
in
they
opposition
to
the
Doha
round
,
albeit
for
differ
reason
.
to
state
that
we
interest
be
somehow
detrimental
to
that
of
develop
country
be
a
naked
lie
which
must
be
firmly
nail
.
to
say
that
we
be
be
protectionist
and
self
-
interested
be
true
.
we
should
not
be
afraid
to
state
that
we
as
a
nation
must
ensure
the
primacy
of
agriculture
as
a
integral
part
of
we
society
and
any
attempt
to
diminish
hard
-
fight
gain
on
CAP
must
be
resist
at
ministerial
level
.
a
fair
global
trading
system
be
something
we
all
want
.
any
agreement
should
also
encompass
bilateral
deal
in
which
the
EU
be
engage
,
particularly
with
the
poor
and
most
vulnerable
economy
through
economic
partnership
agreement
.
as
we
in
Ireland
look
at
the
potential
cost
of
cut
in
tariff
,
the
poor
country
be
be
ask
to
eliminate
more
than
80
%
of
they
tariff
by
the
EU
.
there
be
no
equity
in
that
proposal
which
signal
a
bad
deal
for
both
develop
country
and
developed
country
such
as
Ireland
.
Global
food
security
be
a
issue
that
not
only
effect
that
who
be
more
prone
to
adverse
weather
condition
but
also
this
island
.
if
it
advance
,
this
deal
will
compromise
the
food
security
of
this
nation
.
the
African
farmer
may
also
be
leave
with
a
stark
choice
if
this
process
be
to
succeed
as
envisage
by
the
EU
Commission
.
the
African
farmer
may
find
himself
at
the
end
of
a
trade
liberalisation
agenda
that
force
he
to
buy
he
seed
from
a
conglomerate
such
as
Monsanto
,
thereby
risk
he
livelihood
,
chain
he
to
another
form
of
bond
labour
and
potentially
compromise
he
biodiversity
.
Doha
and
the
WTO
fail
to
consider
the
cultural
and
societal
permutation
of
ram
this
deal
down
we
throat
.
if
it
succeed
,
we
can
wave
goodbye
to
a
traditional
way
of
live
.
that
farmer
who
be
able
to
acquire
more
land
and
develop
economy
of
scale
will
flourish
and
the
traditional
farm
family
will
no
long
exist
.
I
may
be
accuse
of
expound
rhetoric
but
the
implication
of
this
deal
will
be
a
flight
from
the
land
.
this
will
be
due
to
the
influx
of
cheap
import
devoid
of
any
control
,
standard
or
traceability
.
the
Doha
round
be
predicate
on
a
globalisation
agenda
.
it
rely
on
unrestricted
global
market
force
.
in
this
scenario
,
transnational
corporation
will
commandeer
advantageous
term
of
trade
.
small
local
interest
will
no
long
be
able
to
secure
,
control
or
protect
market
share
.
co-operative
will
be
swallow
up
by
large
food
multiple
and
the
"
tescofication
"
of
agriculture
will
become
the
norm
.
when
this
large
food
multiple
control
the
means
of
production
,
they
will
control
the
price
the
consumer
pay
and
the
price
the
producer
derive
.
we
have
already
arrive
at
this
scenario
,
albeit
on
a
small
scale
.
the
structure
of
a
unaccountable
WTO
rule
-
make
militate
against
the
small
producer
,
be
he
or
she
European
or
African
.
the
structure
give
a
advantage
to
large
corporation
and
foreign
direct
investor
at
the
cost
of
weaken
the
traditional
equity
-
orientate
economic
programme
such
as
CAP
,
from
which
we
as
a
island
have
benefit
.
if
the
rule
govern
ownership
of
company
be
change
,
we
will
not
see
a
company
from
a
less
developed
region
acquire
a
firm
from
a
developed
country
.
I
think
I
have
15
minute
.
have
I
already
reach
the
15
-
minute
mark
?
I
be
only
at
ten
minute
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
in
reality
,
this
shoddy
proposal
will
bring
major
change
in
the
market
structure
of
develop
country
in
term
of
ownership
.
it
be
we
view
that
trade
liberalisation
will
transform
subsistence
farming
into
arid
export
monoculture
,
stifle
the
power
of
micro-credit
and
put
poor
country
at
the
mercy
of
western
country
such
as
the
US
.
furthermore
,
the
price
sensitivity
of
market
will
be
more
keenly
feel
.
in
essence
,
the
WTO
proposal
as
they
currently
stand
be
overly
ambitious
in
term
of
trade
liberalisation
and
rule
implementation
.
develop
country
,
as
well
as
this
country
,
rightly
fear
that
they
have
nothing
to
gain
from
this
deal
.
we
feel
that
we
have
make
enough
concession
and
have
gain
nothing
in
return
.
if
this
be
the
case
,
it
be
then
clear
that
the
process
have
fail
both
ourselves
and
less
developed
country
and
be
,
therefore
,
unworkable
in
its
current
term
.
contiguous
to
the
analysis
arrive
at
in
recent
week
be
the
notion
that
perhaps
no
deal
be
good
than
a
bad
deal
.
this
be
something
that
need
to
be
tease
out
in
great
detail
.
the
EU
Commission
agenda
be
detrimental
to
both
Irish
agriculture
and
agriculture
in
develop
country
.
the
Irish
farming
position
be
one
which
have
genuine
fear
about
cut
to
beef
and
dairy
tariff
.
the
question
be
whether
enough
support
be
evident
at
Council
of
Minister
level
for
such
a
cut
.
if
this
be
the
case
,
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
have
question
to
answer
about
whether
she
feel
this
be
a
tenable
position
and
if
not
,
what
she
counter
argument
be
and
if
there
be
a
sufficient
block
minority
to
force
a
rethink
on
this
deal
.
there
be
no
grounds
for
believe
that
Pascal
Lamy
can
push
through
a
deal
ahead
of
the
meeting
of
Agriculture
Minister
on
19
May
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
Doha
agenda
be
unpopular
and
there
be
question
mark
over
whether
the
end
of
the
Bush
regime
in
the
US
will
signal
any
mood
for
a
deal
in
advance
of
a
new
president
be
appoint
.
it
be
we
view
that
,
while
guarantee
food
security
for
EU
citizen
be
a
priority
and
this
can
well
be
achieve
through
a
combination
of
support
EU
food
production
and
through
import
set
in
the
framework
of
the
WTO
rule
,
this
food
security
also
depend
on
the
EU
's
contribution
to
the
building
up
of
world
stock
,
which
be
today
dramatically
low
.
this
allow
the
EU
not
only
to
protect
itself
against
shortage
but
also
to
take
responsibility
with
regards
to
global
food
security
.
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
need
to
protect
the
farmer
of
Europe
,
include
Irish
farmer
,
against
a
liberalisation
agenda
that
will
ultimately
compromise
Irish
comparative
advantage
in
both
the
beef
and
dairy
sector
and
will
add
nothing
of
value
to
develop
country
's
term
of
trade
.
we
view
be
one
which
unashamedly
seek
to
protect
the
national
interest
.
in
seek
to
do
so
,
we
be
protect
we
economy
,
particularly
the
rural
economy
,
and
a
way
of
life
that
be
under
threat
.
Commissioner
Mandelson
have
a
agenda
which
be
incongruous
with
the
found
principle
of
the
European
Union
on
issue
of
subsidiarity
and
its
position
as
a
community
-
base
trading
bloc
.
we
be
now
leave
with
a
appalling
scenario
whereby
the
Mandelson
agenda
be
totally
at
variance
with
that
of
certain
member
of
the
Council
of
Minister
,
include
we
minister
.
the
commission
must
take
its
mandate
from
the
Council
of
Minister
.
it
must
not
exceed
its
mandate
.
it
be
a
supra-national
organisation
and
it
must
derive
its
negotiating
stance
from
the
minister
and
she
colleague
.
the
minister
have
a
hard
task
,
therefore
,
in
build
the
alliance
of
interest
that
be
necessary
to
protect
we
interest
.
we
cannot
and
must
not
trade
away
the
rural
economy
at
a
time
when
other
sector
of
the
economy
have
be
undermine

the
agribusiness
sector
be
the
one
that
have
remain
constant
through
thick
and
thin
throughout
the
history
of
the
State
.
it
be
the
sector
that
will
always
be
there
.
if
we
be
to
trade
away
the
concession
that
have
be
hard
win
through
tough
negotiation
and
diplomacy
,
all
that
concession
will
have

I
be
disappointed
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
,
who
have
primacy
for
this
issue
,
have
leave
the
Chamber
.
I
would
have
like
if
she
stay
for
the
five
minute
allocate
to
I
on
this
issue
.
there
be
a
proposal
make
at
the
end
of
March
that
the
number
of
consultant
operate
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
reduce
from
three
to
two
.
this
be
on
the
termination
of
a
contract
of
employment
.
the
result
of
the
termination
would
have
be
to
reduce
accident
and
emergency
cover
within
the
hospital
from
seven
day
to
five
,
result
in
Monday
to
Friday
cover
from
9
a.m.
to
5
p.m
.
this
decision
be
already
take
,
a
fait
accompli
and
,
but
for
the
action
of
people
such
as
the
Mallow
Hospital
Action
Committee
,
of
which
I
be
secretary
,
Friend
of
Mallow
Hospital
and
general
practitioner
who
come
out
fight
and
hold
a
press
conference
,
decide
that
a
expression
of
''
no
confidence
''
would
be
place
in
the
management
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
the
management
would
have
proceed
with
the
decision
without
a
''
by
you
leave
''
.
because
of
the
action
,
the
furore
,
and
the
amount
of
public
protest
as
a
result
of
the
decision
,
the
HSE
have
state
that
it
be
in
a
position
to
fill
the
post
with
a
locum
consultant
until
the
end
of
May
.
we
have
no
commitment
in
write
that
the
HSE
be
intent
on
the
continuation
of
a
third
surgical
position
at
Mallow
.
we
fear
the
intention
of
the
HSE
and
the
minister
to
downgrade
we
hospital
and
reduce
by
stealth
the
number
of
surgical
post
in
the
hospital
,
thereby
reduce
the
accident
and
emergency
service
and
funnel
everything
to
CUH
which
,
if
one
believe
the
HSE
,
be
the
new
Jerusalem
in
the
south
and
will
solve
all
we
ill
.
we
believe
the
process
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
life
of
the
100000
people
in
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
have
a
adverse
effect
on
medical
outcome
.
CUH
be
ill
-
equip
to
deal
with
the
extra
work
load
this
development
will
entail
.
I
call
on
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
guarantee
in
writing
that
Mallow
,
as
a
secondary
care
facility
,
will
continue
as
the
centre
of
excellence
that
it
be
,
that
the
100
gps
refer
patient
to
the
hospital
will
have
the
accident
and
emergency
cover
they
need
and
that
there
will
be
three
surgeon
or
more
to
provide
the
service
to
more
than
100000
people
who
require
it
.
we
also
want
to
ensure
that
the
hospital
—
a
excellent
facility
—
go
from
strength
to
strength
and
will
not
be
downgrade
any
further
.
we
demand
a
clear
commitment
in
writing
from
the
HSE
,
that
it
will
ensure
the
continuation
of
a
third
surgical
position
so
that
we
can
deliver
service
to
we
people
on
the
ground
.
we
have
no
confidence
in
the
current
management
system
because
we
have
listen
to
promise
on
the
roll
-
out
of
a
ct
scanner
,
which
have
be
idle
for
more
than
three
year
.
we
have
no
radiologist
in
the
hospital
,
which
be
promise
.
we
have
no
executive
management
board
,
which
be
promise
and
for
which
the
HSE
state
it
would
embark
on
a
consultation
process
.
the
dog
on
the
street
know
that
a
15
minute
consultation
with
one
or
two
gps
do
not
constitute
a
consultation
in
we
book
.
we
call
for
the
instigation
of
a
executive
management
board
so
that
we
can
call
into
question
any
decision
on
the
future
of
the
hospital
and
examine
and
provide
a
audit
report
of
any
accounting
procedure
relate
to
the
hospital
.
we
want
to
see
a
centre
of
excellence
at
Mallow
.
it
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
outcome
of
patient
in
the
region
and
we
will
oppose
vehemently
any
attempt
by
the
HSE
to
downgrade
service
.
we
want
to
see
firm
commitment
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
to
see
the
third
post
instigate
in
perpetuity
so
that
the
people
of
the
region
can
have
a
proper
standard
of
care
,
and
excellent
care
at
that
.
the
Minister
of
State
do
not
address
one
point
that
I
raise
and
it
be
a
insult
to
the
people
of
the
region
that
a
minister
of
State
can
give
such
a
bland
reply
in
the
House
.
it
make
a
mockery
of
the
House
,
with
all
due
respect
.
my
Department
have
not
provide
funding

I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Broughan
.
most
of
the
argument
in
this
debate
have
be
well
thrash
out
and
I
will
not
repeat
point
that
have
already
be
make
and
that
I
support
.
I
be
in
favour
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
and
will
vote
for
it
.
I
work
in
the
European
Parliament
for
three
year
and
,
though
it
be
a
august
institution
,
the
first
12
month
of
my
time
there
be
spend
seek
to
interpret
the
Byzantine
language
that
emanate
from
it
.
this
be
a
issue
for
ordinary
citizen
of
the
European
Union
who
find
it
hard
to
interpret
national
legislation
at
the
good
of
time
,
never
mind
European
treaty
and
some
of
the
language
use
therein
.
this
have
negative
consequence
for
the
relationship
citizen
have
with
the
European
Union
and
term
like
"
co-decision
"
and
"
subsidiarity
"
may
be
example
of
language
use
in
a
manner
that
be
sometimes
deliberately
design
to
obfuscate
or
confuse
people
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
my
experience
of
the
European
Union
have
lead
I
to
see
it
as
a
positive
force
.
I
grow
up
in
Ireland
in
the
1980
and
1990
and
transfer
from
the
European
Union
help
member
of
family
like
mine
to
attend
college
and
benefit
from
the
European
social
Fund
.
I
be
able
to
get
a
grant
for
third
level
education
.
the
investment
in
education
through
the
fund
help
thousand
of
people
of
my
age
who
,
otherwise
,
may
not
have
benefit
from
a
third
level
education
.
neither
would
we
have
see
the
resultant
economic
benefit
derive
by
this
country
.
this
be
,
however
,
more
of
a
historic
context
.
what
be
need
be
a
simplification
of
the
language
use
in
EU
document
.
the
treaty
should
be
vote
for
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
incorporate
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
,
a
simplify
document
that
codify
the
rights
of
EU
citizen
.
whether
one
be
from
Ballyhooly
or
Budapest
,
one
be
a
citizen
of
the
European
Union
and
,
therefore
,
one
's
rights
be
guarantee
by
this
provision
.
the
problem
encounter
by
people
in
this
country
be
exactly
the
same
as
by
that
in
other
country
.
we
rights
should
be
as
inalienable
as
that
in
other
member
state
.
I
speak
as
a
Republican
and
subscribe
to
the
ideal
of
this
republic
.
no
provision
in
the
treaty
be
at
variance
with
any
of
this
ideal
.
everything
enshrine
in
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
give
succour
to
that
ideal
of
egalitarian
principle
and
seek
to
ensure
every
citizen
have
a
define
set
of
rights
.
that
be
the
most
important
issue
.
the
farming
organisation
have
state
a
position
on
the
referendum
ves
-à
-
vo
the
WTO
negotiation
.
while
I
be
sympathetic
to
they
argument
,
I
would
not
advocate
a
vote
against
the
Lisbon
treaty
on
the
basis
of
a
argument
over
the
WTO
negotiation
.
the
treaty
will
broaden
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
through
enhance
co-decision
procedure
.
the
Council
of
Minister
it
would
seem
have
sway
over
agricultural
decision
affect
this
country
.
if
the
power
of
the
agricultural
committee
of
the
European
Parliament
be
broaden
and
national
parliament
be
give
a
great
say
in
transpose
EU
legislation
,
the
voice
of
Irish
agriculture
will
be
strengthen
and
have
more
power
on
decision
affect
it
.
it
be
important
to
note
we
have
have
little
in
transparency
on
the
decision
make
at
EU
ministerial
council
level
.
I
would
bet
any
money
that
if
the
attendance
record
for
EU
Council
meeting
be
check
,
Irish
minister
would
be
note
for
a
fair
degree
of
absenteeism
.
Little
information
be
available
publicly
as
to
what
go
on
at
this
meeting
.
return
to
the
demise
of
the
Irish
sugar
industry
,
a
deal
be
hammer
out
at
European
level
yet
we
do
not
know
what
happen
on
that
fateful
night
in
November
2005
at
the
relevant
EU
Council
meeting
.
we
do
not
know
what
minister
take
what
decision
or
what
be
say
.
the
treaty
will
make
every
Council
of
Minister
meeting
more
transparent
.
I
welcome
this
and
it
will
allow
we
to
know
what
we
minister
and
the
permanent
representation
be
do
in
Brussels
.
when
the
Convention
on
the
Future
of
Europe
be
hold
first
,
the
imposition
of
Valéry
Giscard
d'Estaing
probably
set
a
negative
tone
.
there
be
a
large
-
state
view
on
how
the
propose
EU
constitution
should
proceed
with
the
large
member
state
seek
to
control
the
agenda
.
I
do
not
blame
small
member
state
for
kick
over
the
trace
.
there
be
a
clear
modus
operandi
of
seek
to
impose
a
certain
set
of
value
in
the
constitution
.
I
be
glad
this
have
be
roll
back
and
its
replacement
be
a
treaty
.
the
ideal
of
the
constitution
have
be
simplify
in
the
treaty
.
if
the
treaty
give
more
power
to
the
European
Parliament
,
it
give
more
power
to
the
people
of
Europe
.
if
it
give
more
to
national
parliament
,
it
give
more
power
to
we
as
Irish
citizen
to
have
a
say
in
how
the
European
Parliament
proceed
on
any
legislative
matter
,
which
can
only
be
welcome
.
the
treaty
also
put
in
place
further
check
and
balance
against
the
commission
,
a
necessary
mechanism
.
EU
commissioner
such
as
Frit
Bolkestein
have
be
hell
-
bend
on
a
liberalisation
agenda
.
some
from
a
left
-
wing
perspective
will
oppose
the
Lisbon
treaty
because
of
that
very
agenda
.
I
contend
we
should
agree
with
the
treaty
so
that
check
and
balance
can
be
put
in
place
against
that
neoliberal
agenda
.
it
be
also
a
agenda
for
which
we
own
commissioner
,
Charlie
McCreevy
,
have
be
a
strong
advocate
and
have
do
we
no
favour
in
that
regard
.
I
support
the
Lisbon
treaty
.
while
it
be
not
perfect
,
on
balance
we
will
derive
far
more
benefit
than
negative
from
it
.
I
welcome
this
debate
and
I
wholeheartedly
support
the
motion
,
which
call
for
some
simple
,
pragmatic
solution
to
a
problem
that
afflict
the
10000
and
more
people
who
be
affect
by
acquire
brain
injury
.
the
motion
also
request
the
establishment
of
a
regional
network
of
rehabilitation
facility
and
service
to
be
establish
in
the
context
of
a
national
rehabilitation
strategy
.
the
response
from
the
government
side
offer
nothing
that
would
provide
comfort
or
encouragement
to
that
suffer
from
acquire
brain
injury
in
the
context
of
address
they
need
.
there
be
a
regional
disparity
in
the
delivery
of
health
care
.
if
one
live
in
Cork
,
Kerry
,
Galway
or
Donegal
,
one
be
already
at
a
disadvantage
if
one
suffer
with
a
acquire
brain
injury
.
the
disparity
to
which
I
refer
must
be
address
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
not
only
do
this
disparity
exist
in
the
area
of
health
,
it
be
also
prevalent
in
the
economy
and
in
the
government
's
regional
policy
.
I
recently
make
representation
to
a
neurologist
on
behalf
of
a
person
with
a
acquire
brain
injury
.
he
confide
in
I
that
if
he
be
to
close
the
door
of
he
practice
tomorrow
,
he
would
have
sufficient
client
to
deep
he
in
business
for
the
next
two
year
.
that
illustrate
the
seriousness
of
this
issue
.
that
on
the
government
side
state
that
the
development
of
a
new
rehabilitation
centre
be
at
the
planning
stage
and
that
this
will
hopefully
be
up
and
run
by
2012
.
that
assertion
do
not
provide
any
grounds
for
confidence
.
the
motion
before
the
House
call
for
a
increase
in
the
number
of
approve
post
for
consultant
neurologist
from
24
to
42
.
such
a
development
would
almost
,
if
not
quite
,
bring
we
up
to
a
standard
which
obtain
in
other
European
country
and
would
represent
a
immeasurable
improvement
on
the
exist
position
.
what
we
be
ultimately
concerned
with
be
people
's
dignity
.
there
be
that
who
have
no
access
to
the
service
of
which
they
should
be
able
to
avail
as
a
matter
of
right
.
this
individual
will
gain
no
comfort
from
what
be
be
say
by
that
on
the
government
side
because
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
sense
of
urgency
about
this
matter
.
the
Labour
Party
be
request
that
there
be
such
a
sense
of
urgency
in
order
to
preserve
people
's
dignity
and
give
they
the
right
to
a
standard
of
health
care
they
tax
euro
should
afford
they
.
be
they
resident
in
Dublin
or
the
region
,
they
should
be
treat
as
equal
.
that
be
what
we
be
call
for
in
this
debate
.
I
monitor
current
expenditure
in
my
Department
on
a
ongoing
basis
to
ensure
it
remain
within
the

I
will
speak
to
some
very
specific
point
on
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
and
the
fact
that
a
mechanism
be
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
a
unified
scheme
to
replace
the
exist
scheme
.
this
be
long
overdue
.
I
will
not
repeat
the
point
make
here
previously
because
there
seem
to
be
general
agreement
about
the
main
thrust
of
the
Bill
.
my
experience
,
both
as
a
student
and
as
a
public
representative
,
have
be
one
typify
by
frustration
.
for
a
student
to
go
into
the
third
semester
without
receive
any
payment
whatsoever
be
a
sad
indictment
of
the
system
of
student
support
as
they
exist
in
the
mid-1990
.
it
be
blatantly
obvious
that
the
system
have
not
change
much
since
then
,
notwithstand
the
good
effort
of
local
authority
official
,
especially
that
in
Cork
County
Council
,
and
that
in
VECs
,
who
probably
expedite
the
application
as
good
they
could
.
the
important
point
be
that
the
whole
system
be
to
be
streamline
.
in
welcoming
the
Bill
,
I
still
do
not
think
that
there
should
be
discrimination
under
section
8
for
that
student
who
be
attend
private
college
.
if
a
student
's
parent
have
the
means
which
would
deem
the
student
eligible
to
be
successful
in
get
a
grant
for
a
approve
college
as
define
in
the
Bill
,
I
do
not
see
why
such
a
student
cannot
avail
of
a
grant
to
attend
a
private
college
as
well
.
in
other
word
,
the
grant
should
be
pay
on
the
basis
of
the
student
rather
than
the
college
.
we
be
talk
about
a
social
mechanism
that
enhance
the
student
's
ability
or
lighten
the
burden
as
he
or
she
go
through
the
education
system
.
there
should
be
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
choose
one
college
over
another
.
we
have
all
be
subject
to
the
USI
lobby
and
I
welcome
its
address
of
the
situation
as
it
pertain
to
part
-
time
student
.
as
previous
speaker
outline
,
we
be
now
in
a
society
and
a
economy
that
need
to
retrain
and
upskill
itself
constantly
.
I
would
like
to
see
a
situation
whereby
if
somebody
be
lay
off
or
be
force
into
part
-
time
work
,
that
person
could
be
deem
eligible
for
some
student
support
if
it
mean
that
the
person
be
enhance
he
or
she
prospect
of
get
back
into
the
labour
force
.
it
be
time
that
the
traditional
mechanism
that
exist
be
review
so
that
we
can
take
account
of
a
more
plural
society
whereby
everything
be
not
designate
by
a
person
's
parent
's
income
,
whether
the
person
be
eligible
for
a
back
to
education
allowance
or
whether
a
person
have
be
out
of
education
for
a
number
of
year
and
be
receive
social
welfare
payment
.
the
system
should
also
take
cognisance
of
that
people
who
have
be
work
full
time
for
a
number
of
year
but
will
suffer
a
serious
loss
of
income
by
go
back
into
full
-
time
education
.
such
people
need
a
degree
of
support
as
well
.
we
must
take
into
account
the
whole
gamut
of
society
,
not
just
a
few
people
.
I
welcome
the
appeal
mechanism
because
the
current
system
have
be
very
prescriptive
in
how
it
arrive
at
a
decision
.
if
a
student
be
go
to
college
and
if
there
be
mitigating
circumstance
relate
to
the
financial
outgoing
of
he
or
she
parent
,
they
should
be
take
into
account
.
to
make
a
decision
base
on
the
p60
,
P21
and
P45
and
without
take
other
factor
into
account
be
not
good
enough
.
there
need
to
be
a
certain
degree
of
discretion
and
I
hope
that
it
work
in
favour
of
the
student
when
use
the
appeal
mechanism
.
where
the
vec
deem
that
the
student
be
worthy
of
the
grant
,
it
should
err
on
the
side
of
grant
financial
assistance
.
I
have
meet
people
who
,
because
they
be
a
couple
of
hundred
euro
over
the
limit
,
have
be
completely
wash
out
of
the
system
.
there
be
people
on
fix
income
in
this
country
who
need
that
financial
assistance
,
but
who
have
find
themselves
outside
the
system
and
cannot
afford
to
return
to
college
.
that
may
be
a
issue
for
which
we
need
to
look
at
the
income
limit
,
but
we
still
need
to
examine
it
on
a
overall
basis
.
we
generally
support
the
Bill
.
we
believe
that
it
be
time
to
look
at
part
-
time
student
.
we
need
to
encourage
more
people
into
the
education
system
and
the
way
to
do
that
be
not
to
make
it
prohibitively
expensive
for
they
to
do
so
.
we
believe
that
the
grant
should
follow
the
student
and
not
necessarily
the
so
-
call
approve
institution
,
as
it
be
label
in
the
Bill
.
there
have
be
a
mark
increase
in
the
number
of
private
institution
that
be
provide
excellent
course
that
ultimately
add
value
to
society
and
to
the
economy
.
if
a
student
decide
that
he
or
she
want
to
go
to
a
private
college
,
he
or
she
should
not
suffer
discrimination
on
the
basis
that
it
be
not
a
approve
institution
.

note
the
Taoiseach

use

the
expression

the
legislative

as
it
pertain

Fishery

be
fairly
empty

the

three

the

ask

I

I

with
correspondence
from

of
Compassion

on
the
defeat
Fur

Bill

,
which
be
,
I
understand
,
introduce
by
the
Green
Party
during
the
previous
government
's
term
in
office
.
will
the
relevant
provision
feature
in
the
animal
health

welfare
Bill
?
when
will
the
legislation
come
before
the
House
?
on
the
scarcity
of
global
food
supplies
,
give
the
lack
of
government
initiative
in
this
area
,
it
would
be
pertinent
to
have
a
debate
on
the
issue
.
the

in
the
past
24
hour
we
have
hear
much
from
the
government
side
about
the
ESRI
report
.
if
I
be
a
construction
worker
or
a
manufacturing
worker
who
have
lose
he
job
in
the
past
three
month
,
the
ESRI
report
would
not
mean
a
whole
pile
to
I
.
I
would
not
be
able
to
bring
home
the
ESRI
report
on
Thursday
evening
instead
of
a
cheque
and
put
it
on
the
table
to
feed
my
family
.
the
government
have
engage
in
a
degree
of
spin
on
the
issue
in
the
past
24
hour
.
there
be
a
state
of
denial
on
this
issue
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
lobby
the
government
to
examine
this
issue
positively
,
take
in
hand
certain
aspect
of
the
economy
and
re-jig
its
thinking
on
how
to
work
we
way
out
of
the
downturn
,
notwithstand
the
potential
long
-
term
gain
as
outline
in
the
ESRI
report
.
to
arrest
the
decline
in
the
construction
industry
the
government
must
come
out
in
favour
of
infrastructural
spending
.
it
be
not
sufficient
that
the
NRA
and
other
agency
concentrate
spending
on
interurban
or
intercity
project
.
the
NRA
must
be
adequately
fund
to
develop
road
network
between
town
,
especially
for
secondary
road
that
be
not
good
,
in
some
instance

.
if
regional
development
,
which
should
be
a
main
plank
of
a
country
such
as
this
,
be
to
mean
anything
,
then
the
national
spatial
strategy
must
be
return
to
the
forefront
of
economic
thinking
.
a
typical
hub
town
such
as
Mallow
must
benefit
from
government
policy
that
deliver
infrastructure
,
as
should
town
such
as
Cobh
,
Youghal
,
Midleton
and
Fermoy
.
this
town
have
not
benefit
from
the
boom
except
in
the
area
of
construction
.
investment
in
the
infrastructure
of
road
network
,
business
and
enterprise
park
will
encourage
local
economic
growth
.
the
government
must
also
find
way
to
take
a
punt
on
innovation
.
give
that
we
have
€
8
billion

we
must
find
way
to

back
and
encourage
that
who
invest
in

overseas
to
take
a
chance
on
the
commercialisation
of

we
must
support
venture
capital

divert
investment
in
brick

to
innovation

the

's
recent
announcement
of
€500
million
funding
be
welcome
but
it
must
go
further

the
recent
downturn

the

,
through

charge
,
be
a
testament
to
the
contempt
in
which
this
government
hold

.
properly
fund
local

would
mean
few

more

there
must
be
a
paradigm
shift
in
think
towards
take
the
burden
of
charge
away
from
small

.
for
too
long
they
have
be
a
soft
focus
for

the
reason
for
the
question
be
the
degree
of
uncertainty
which
be
have
a
mark
result
in
this
country
in
that
we
be
now
pay
more
for

be
pay
much
more
for

and
that
give
rise
to
the
question
.
if
the

deal
go
through
as
it
be
constitute
,
that
will
have
a
further
uncertainty
for
food
production
throughout
the
European
Union
into
the
future
.
many
people
be
ask
whether
the
government
have
a
coherent
policy
.
Irish
farmer
and
food
producer
will
be
ask
whether
that
€
8.6
billion
in
export
will
be
compromise
in
any
way
if
global
trend
continue
as
they
be
.
we
be
try
to
elicit
whether
,
notwithstand
the
CAP
health
check
and
the
FAO
agenda
on
a
global
basis
,
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and

have
a
coherent
strategy
on
the
way
forward
for
Irish
producer
to
attain
some
degree
of
self
-
sufficiency
—
and
ensure
we
take
a
long
-
term
view
on
food
production
in
Ireland
.
that
be
the
premise
of
the
question
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
if
the
WTO
deal
go
through
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
,
this
will
have
a
further
adverse
effect
for
producer
in
develop
country
—
as
well
as
for
Irish
producer
?
ultimately
,
and
this
hark
back
to
what
the
Fine
Gael
spokesman
be
say
as
regards
the
current
WTO
deal
,
there
be
political
consideration
,
both
domestically
and
internationally
.
Irish
farmer
want
to
hear
that
there
will
be
no
dismantling
of
the
long
-
term
achievement
of
cap
into
the
future
.
it
be
clearly
the
case
that
the
WTO
deal
,
as
it
stand
,
will
compromise
that
gain
and
indeed
,
diminish
and
destroy
they
.
they
want
to
hear
a
firm
voice
from
the
government
as
to
its
intention
on
the
WTO
deal
.
I
refer
to
the
Malone
report
and
the
basis
of
the
five
hectare
limit
.
be
this
over
-
prescriptive
and
be
there
scope
for
further
reduction
in
this
regard
?
a
ministerial
prerogative
be
available
to
reduce
it
further
,
if
necessary
,
in
certain
location
.
as
with
any
regime
change
,
one
would
hope
there
be
plan
for
force
majeure
event
.
this
have
be
ten
year
in
the
making
.
I
welcome
the
clear
statement
and
,
frankly
,
I
hope
it
be
true
.
this
legislation
be
on
the
Order
Paper
when
I
come
into
this
House
,
then
it
be
take
off
and
it
have
appear
again
.
the
confusion
relate
to
this
be
genuine
and
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
spokesperson
on
agriculture
,
there
have
be
no
legislation
on
agriculture
,
fishery
,
forestry
or
food
in
the
past
12
month
.
for
this
reason
I
hope
the
statement
be
genuine
and
I
look
forward
to
the
legislation
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
parochial
but
this
matter
relate
to
the
office
in
north
Cork
,
specifically
Mallow
,
where
structural
issue
have
exist
for
some
time
that
make
it
difficult
for
staff
to
process
grant
claim
.

to

this

the
minister
while
we
be
on
the
subject

I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
allow
I
to
contribute
.
I
be
a
regular
user
of
the
Mallow
to
Dublin
service
and
I
rely
on
it
greatly
.
it
be
perhaps
a
credit
to
Iarnród
Éireann
in
some
respects
that
it
have
roll
out
a
fairly
extensive
service
.
however
,
credit
be
also
due
to
the
exist
driver
on
that
route
.
some
of
this
driver
have
eat
considerably
into
they
holiday
time
over
the
past
12
month
because
of
the
shortage
of
driver
and
be
refuse
leave
in
some
instance
when
they
seek
and
give
notice
for
leave
for
family
occasion
like
confirmation
or
first
holy
communion
.
while
we
agree
this
be
a
unofficial
strike
—
I
particularly
welcome
the
fact
that
the
LRC
machinery
be
now
kick
in
and
I
hope
that
both
side
will
come
to
a
compromise
on
this
—
there
need
to
be
a
roll
-
out
of
the
driver
as
promise
.
if
that
can
be
expedite
so
that
the
service
be
resume
and
the
exist
driver
be
not
put
under
increase
pressure
that
should
be
do
.
there
be
two
side
to
this
Iarnród
Éireann
story
.
I
hope
it
will
come
to
a
successful
conclusion
.
some
driver
have
be
very
flexible
in
they
approach
with
Iarnród
Éireann
and
have
be
more
than
willing
to
accede
to
its
wish
in
term
of
practice
.
I
hope
Iarnród
Éireann
will
reciprocate
in
kind
.
I
have
no
function
in
relation
to
control
the
price
of
oil
,
diesel
or
petrol
.
the
Irish
oil
industry
be
fully
privatise
,
liberalise
and
deregulate
.
there
be
free
entry
into
the
market
.
price
at
the
pump
reflect
market
factor
such
as
global
market
price
,
transportation
cost
,
Euro
/
dollar
fluctuation
and
other
operating
cost
.
the
Competition
Authority
be
a
statutory
independent
body
with
specific
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
competition
law
.
the
National
consumer
Agency
have
specific
statutory
responsibility
for
protect
the
rights
of
consumer
.
both
have
responsibility
for
ensure
that
competition
work
optimally
for
the
benefit
of
consumer
throughout
the
country
.
EU
price
figure
publish
on
19th
May
,
2008
,
show
that
the
average
price
of
diesel
in
Ireland
in
April
be
€
1.248
per
litre
.
the
corresponding
figure
for
April
publish
in
May
2007
be
€
1.072
per
litre
.
traditionally
,
diesel
have
be
less
expensive
than
petrol
in
Ireland
at
the
forecourt
.
this
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
international
price
for
both
product
be
at
a
similar
level
,
and
excise
duty
be
low
on
diesel
.
the
excise
differential
in
favour
of
diesel
be
7.46
cent
.
the
international
price
of
diesel
be
determine
by
supply
and
demand
,
and
the
increase
in
demand
for
diesel
which
be
take
place
both
within
Europe
and
in
China
and
other
rapidly
-
develop
economy
world
-
wide
,
have
push
up
the
international
price
for
diesel
above
the
price
of
petrol
.
the
increase
in
the
demand
for
diesel
have
lead
to
a
shortage
in
European
refinery
,
and
diesel
be
now
be
source
from
far
afield
,
particularly
from
Russia
.
the
International
Energy
Agency
(
IEA
)
have
also
report
that
US
refiner
have
be
produce
substantially
more
petrol
than
usual
and
domestic
US
stock
be
very
high
.
this
factor
be
likely
to
have
curb
flow
of
export
of
petrol
from
Europe
to
the
US
,
leave
Northwest
European
petrol
stock
above
average
.
the
combination
of
all
of
this
market
factor
have
contribute
to
the
rise
in
European
diesel
price
relative
to
petrol
.
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
by
the
HSE
to
appoint
more
occupational
therapist
in
order
that
people
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
be
not
wait
for
period
of
up
to
six
month
and
beyond
to
receive
a
occupational
therapist
report
for
the
purpose
of
apply
for
a
housing
aid
for
old
people
grant
where
essential
and
quality
of

modification
be

without
which
they
would
be
unable
to

comfortably
.
or
a
missal
.
Transport
be
one
of
the
fast

sector
in

of

.
it
be
widely
acknowledge
that
transport
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
area
in
which
to

in

.
biofuel
offer
one
potential
means
to
counter
rise

level
in

.
the

proposal
set
the

target
for
5.75
%
in

and
10
%
by

have
include
the
provision
that
any

have
at

a
35
%
emission
reduction
and
have
to
show
that
they
come
from
sustainable
source
which
do
not
destroy

.
biofuel
production
and
use
will
enhance

of

and
contribute
to
a
reduction
in

emission
.
in
addition
to
direct

,
biofuel
offer
opportunity
for

so
that
we
can
continue
to
provide
basic

in
such
circumstance
.
Recent
event
have
show
we
that
biofuel
be
not
without

.
the
diversion
of

into

have
be
one
factor
in

.
there
have
also
be
concern
that

have
lead
to
the
conversion
of

into

.
it
be
for
this

that
we

take

within

the

the
language
use
by
the
institution
of
the
European
Union
be
not
understand
by
the
general
populace
or
politician
.
a
practical
example
of
this
would
be
to
ask
any
member
what
the
co-decision
procedure
mean
.
I
be
sure
the
majority
would
find
it
difficult
to
explain
.
if
one
cannot
explain
the
co-decision
procedure
,
how
can
one
explain
what
the
Lisbon
treaty
mean
for
enhance
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
?
how
can
one
explain
that
the
treaty
would
give
more
power
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
?
if
that
language
deficit
exist
,
it
be
difficult
for
the
general
populace
to
latch
on
to
a
idea
of
what
the
treaty
mean
.
I
support
the
treaty
because
it
aim
to
enhance
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
,
make
the
European
Council
more
transparent
in
its
dealing
and
give
,
by
extension
,
more
power
to
the
people
.
it
would
address
the
issue
that
turf
cutter
,
fisherman
,
farmer
and
other
have
because
the
European
Parliament
,
and
by
extension
the
people
,
would
have
extend
power
.
however
,
we
vote
"
no
"
to
that
.
therefore
,
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
how
we
should
start
to
educate
ourselves
as
to
how
the
European
Union
work
and
what
be
the
inter-
relationship
between
the
Council
of
Minister
,
the
European
Commission
and
the
European
Parliament
and
how
this
inter-relationship
and
pooling
of
sovereignty
affect
we
as
citizen
of
the
European
Union
.
the
argument
of
sovereignty
be
use
against
the
treaty
.
when
we
join
in
1973
,
we
do
so
on
the
basis
not
that
we
be
give
up
we
sovereignty
but
that
we
be
pool
we
sovereignty
and
become
part
of
a
decision
-
making
process
of
which
we
be
also
member
and
stakeholder
.
this
treaty
be
go
to
enhance
that
very
provision
but
,
as
other
speaker
have
say
,
we
find
ourselves
on
the
back
foot
,
rebut
argument
that
be
spurious
in
the
main
.
I
respect
people
's
decision
to
vote
"
no
"
.
I
have
to
respect
that
decision
because
if
there
be
a
fundamental
lack
of
understanding
as
to
how
the
institution
work
,
how
can
a
person
buy
into
and
believe
in
the
process
?
the
question
be
how
we
be
go
to
address
this
attitude
and
make
people
believe
in
the
process
.
will
there
now
be
a
complete
recasting
of
we
relationship
with
the
European
Union
?
do
we
now
proceed
backwards
into
a
process
of
intergovernmentalism
or
do
we
enhance
and
deepen
the
process
by
means
of
inter-institutionalism
?
this
be
the
question
that
need
to
be
ask
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
explain
that
very
relationship
to
people
on
the
doorstep
.
we
must
wait
for
the
time
when
the
people
of
Ireland
understand
the
positive
aspect
of
that
relationship
and
we
begin
to
use
a
language
that
do
not
regard
Brussels
as
some
foreign
entity
but
merely
as
a
city
in
which
decision
be
take
by
we
as
equal
partner
to
a
decision
-
making
process
that
be
the
European
Union
.
until
we
begin
to
decipher
the
language
and
change
the
language
we
use
and
make
it
more
amenable
and
understandable
to
people
,
we
will
continue
to
have
this
deficit
.
my
sojourn
here
for
the
past
year
have
be
one
during
which
there
have
be
a
dearth
of
legislation
and
a
proliferation
of
statement
on
everything
under
the
sun
.
on
a
personal
level
,
I
could
say
I
have
enjoy
the
experience
but
I
expect
when
I
come
to
this
House
that
I
would
be
up
to
my
oxter
in
legislation
and
debate
but
the
contrary
have
be
the
case
.
I
sense
a
malaise
and
a
lack
of
appetite
for
the
issue
which
relate
to
the
governance
of
this
country
from
the
government
side
of
the
House
.
today
we
debate
the
Lisbon
treaty
referendum
and
I
,
as
a
deputy
for
Cork
East
,
have
five
minute
to
discuss
and
put
forward
the
idea
I
have
but
I
could
not
do
so
in
the
time
available
.
the
time
available
in
this
house
for
political
discourse
and
debate
be
become
short
all
the
time
.
that
send
a
message
to
the
people
that
politician
could
not
care
one
fig
about
the
issue
relate
to
they
everyday
life
.
we
be
now
go
to
extend
this
session
by
one
week
.
that
will
feed
into
that
increase
cynicism
which
exist
beyond
this
wall
about
political
discourse
in
Ireland
.
the
Labour
Party
have
many
idea
and
positive
contribution
to
make
in
work
with
this
government
,
in
constructively
oppose
idea
which
this
government
put
forward
and
in
offer
good
solution
,
if
it
can
.
however
,
the
space
for
discourse
and
debate
have
be
cut
to
shred
.
that
be
what
exist
in
the
country
at
present
and
it
need
to
be
address
.
I
have
a
particular
competence
as
Labour
spokesperson
for
food
provision
and
agriculture
.
I
have
idea
that
I
could
put
forward
that
would
,
I
hope
,
lead
to
expand
the
base
for
agricultural
production
and
for
deal
with
the
issue
of
increase
food
price
.
however
,
I
be
not
able
to
do
this
because
the
government
and
the
leader
of
the
country
will
not
allow
I
the
opportunity
to
do
so
,
thereby
deny
I
the
opportunity
to
represent
the
people
who
put
I
here
.
this
House
have
primacy
in
term
of
its
democratic
function
but
this
be
not
recognise
.
the
government
be
run
scared
from
any
kind
of
debate
and
be
not
face
up
to
its
responsibility
.
it
need
to
start
do
so
straight
away
.

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
why
Mallow
General
Hospital
do
not
yet
have
a
ct
scanner
that
be
operational
,
despite
the
budgetary
provision
be
make
in
2004
and
despite
its
subsequent
installation
;
to
ask
why
the
person
who
be
appoint
radiographer
will
not
now
take
up
the
post
;
and
,
further
,
to
ask
the
minister
for
Health
and
Children
when
it
be
propose
that
this
post
will
be
fill
.
they
will
be
ask
we
to
run
the
country
next
.
I
propose
to
share
time
with
deputy
Tommy
Broughan
and
Brendan
Howlin
,
if
I
may
.
I
receive
the
same
e-mail
as
deputy
Creed
and
I
believe
it
have
sum
up
the
situation
as
it
relate
to
a
family
that
be
completely
reliant
on
fishing
for
its
livelihood
.
a
husband
and
wife
re-mortgage
a
house
to
invest
in
a
boat
,
employ
a
crew
of
five
people
and
take
to
the
sea
.
in
one
instance
,
it
spend
ten
day
,
or
240
hour
,
at
sea
for
a
return
of
€
725
per
man
before
tax
.
basically
,
they
be
earn
€
3
per
hour
.
moreover
,
the
same
fisherman
then
be
oblige
to
incur
the
stringent
regulation
apply
by
the
authority
in
Ireland
,
while
French
,
Spanish
and
fisherman
from
other
country
be
look
on
and
laugh
at
the
regime
here
.
this
pertain
to
realise
that
a
group
of
people
exist
within
we
society
who
,
because
of
climactic
and
bureaucratic
condition
,
incur
serious
loss
of
income
.
however
,
they
wish
to
sustain
they
livelihood
and
they
coastal
community
because
they
have
do
so
for
generation
.
as
the
lady
who
write
the
e-mail
state
,
when
they
hit
bad
time
they
want
a
leg
up
and
not
a
handout
.
moreover
,
they
do
not
wish
to
incur
the
bureaucratic
nightmare
that
relate
to
fishery
policy
.
however
,
they
want
to
see
put
in
place
a
realistic
mechanism
that
would
assist
they
through
,
if
one
pardon
the
pun
,
choppy
water
.
during
time
when
crewmen
and
woman
be
not
bring
in
catch
and
they
income
be
be
seriously
deplet
—
they
be
deem
to
be
self
-
employ
—
they
should
not
be
oblige
to
go
cap
in
hand
to
the
local
community
welfare
officer
to
beg
to
supplement
they
income
.
a
form
of
tax
incentive
or
tax
break
could
be
put
in
place
on
the
basis
they
be
sustain
community
in
coastal
region
.
moreover
,
the
government
should
consider
a
form
of
social
welfare
mechanism
to
assist
such
man
and
woman
on
the
basis
that
they
income
fluctuate
between
one
end
of
the
year
and
the
other
,
that
would
not
necessarily
be

I
ask
the
chair
to
let
I
know
when
I
have
speak
for
four
minute
.
I
be
anxious
about
the

about
the

that

the
issue
of

that
specifically
relate

Cork
County
Council
's
northern
division

we
be
ask
that
the
minister
consider
a
increase
in

.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finneran
,
will
tell
the
House
there
have
be
a
increase
year
on
year
in
the
overall
allocation
for
2008
and
the
total
amount
disburse
in

.
the
announcement
in
February
by
the
then
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
housing
,
deputy
Batt
O'Keeffe
,
cause
the
other
scheme
announce
to
become
so
successful
that
hundred
of
people
apply
for
they
.
that
create
a
expectation
.
we
now
find
in
the
northern
division
of
Cork
County
Council
that
there
be
a
lack
of
funding
to
meet
the
scheme
of
which
many
vulnerable
and
old
people
be
in
need
to
carry
out
necessary
modification
to
they
home
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
see
if
there
be
any
way
to
provide
a
increase
in
the
funding
stream
.
the
local
Government
Computer
Service
Board
(
LGCSB
)
,
a
body
under
the
aegis
of
my
Department
,
be
schedule
to
move
to
Drogheda
under
the
decentralisation
programme
.
progress
in
relation
to
that
relocation
,
which
be
a
matter
for
the
body
itself
,
be
report
on
to
the
Decentralisation
Implementation
Group
.
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
discuss
the
follow
specific
and
important
matter
of
public
interest
require
urgent
attention
,
namely
,
the
urgent
need
for
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
to
make
a
comprehensive
statement
to
the
House
on
the
threat
to
health
and
safety
pose
by
the
estimate
half
a
million
tonne
of
hazardous
material
contain
chromium
6
and
other
toxin
still
on
site
at
the
former
Irish
steel
site
at
Haulbowline
,
County
Cork
;
the
reason
the
removal
of
the
material
be
stop
by
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
and
the
contractor
be
instruct
to
cap
the
material
;
and
the
need
for
the
minister
to
outline
what
step
be
now
plan
to
remove
this
material
to
ensure
that
any
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
resident
be
remove
.
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
request
,
I
hope
the
Ceann
Comhairle
will
agree
to
it
be
take
.
I
wish
to
share
my
time
with
deputy
Ó
Snodaigh
.
I
echo
the
sentiment
of
we
spokesperson
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
on
this
Bill
.
the
legislation
,
as
it
be
put
to
we
,
and
the
subsequent
statement
by
the
minister
,
would
leave
one
wonder
what
be
the
purpose
and
content
of
this
legislation
.
there
be
few
meaningful
section
in
the
Bill
.
the
culture
and
sale
of
alcohol
in
this
country
would
probably
be
well
deal
with
in
the
sale
of
alcohol
Bill
.
however
there
be
some
good
provision
in
the
Bill
that
be
worthy
of
support
.
in
this
country
we
cannot
talk
about
alcohol
without
its
have
some
very
deep
cultural
meaning
.
we
relationship
with
alcohol
have
be
ambiguous
and
we
have
speak
about
it
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
in
my
research
I
come
across
a
study
in
the
Journal
of
statistical
and
social
Inquiry
Society
of
Ireland
entitle
issue
for
Irish
Alcohol
Policy
:
a
historical
perspective
with
some
Lesson
for
the
Future
,
publish
in
1991
.
the
author
of
that
report
,
Mr.
Daniel
McCoy
,
cite
a
quotation
:
''
no
one
can
be
competent
to
discuss
the
drink
question
unless
he
have
think
over
it
sufficiently
to
realise
how
complicated
the
subject
necessarily
be
.
''
on
page
21
of
that
study
the
author
refer
to
historical
view
of
the
relationship
we
have
with
alcohol
in
this
country
:
Irish
drinking
be
see
as
convivial
rather
than
ritual
and
be
use
as
a
bonding
with
people
of
the
same
or
other
group
.
Irish
people
...
have
a
"
social
acceptance
"
of
drunkenness
something
that
be
completely
opposite
to
the
Islamic
view
.
while
I
do
not
advocate
that
we
all
turn
to
Islam
,
neither
do
I
advocate
some
of
the
point
raise
in
this
piece
of
legislation
that
seek
to
modify
behaviour
.
for
example
,
I
do
not
believe
the
provision
on
sale
of
wine
in
supermarket
be
good
.
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
see
fit
to
reverse
that
trend
.
the
vast
majority
of
people
drink
responsibly
and
like
to
imbibe
and
share
a
bottle
of
wine
in
they
home
.
the
notion
that
somebody
would
have
to
go
to
a
supermarket
that
have
a
off
-
licence
and
ask
for
a
bottle
to
be
hand
out
by
a
member
of
staff
so
that
he
or
she
could
handle
it
before
purchase
be
ludicrous
.
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
reverse
that
provision
.
I
want
to
speak
briefly
on
theatre
licence
.
there
should
not
be
uniform
closing
time
for
nightclub
.
have
hundred
of
people
spill
out
onto
the
street
at
one
give
time
be
not
a
effective
method
of
regularise
alcohol
consumption
,
if
that
be
the
modus
operandi
of
the
Bill
.
by
modify
or
regulate
closing
time
in
a
very
uniform
way
one
will
not
modify
behaviour
.
the
core
of
the
legislation
should
be
to
seek
to
change
the
culture
.
by
staggering
closing
time
,
particularly
for
nightclub
with
theatre
licence
,
there
would
be
more
of
a
drip
-
feed
onto
the
street
and
it
would
be
easy
to
control
.
the
legislation
propose
to
have
cctv
camera
install
and
that
would
be
a
good
way
to
monitor
the
behaviour
of
clientele
exite
onto
street
at
night
time
.
however
restrict
licence
,
particularly
theatre
licence
,
will
not
be
a
good
way
of
modify
alcohol
consumption
.
the
two
do
not
correlate
.
I
have
attend
the
Gaiety
Theatre
,
which
have
a
late
licence
,
on
a
number
of
occasion
.
accord
to
its
website
,
this
weekend
four
different
event
will
take
place
simultaneously
in
the
theatre
's
four
bar
.
there
will
be
a
live
band
play
indie
and
retro
music
,
on
another
stage
there
will
be
northern
soul
and
there
will
also
be
some
hip
hop
.
in
a
city
the
size
of
Dublin
one
be
catering
for
a
wide
range
of
musical
taste
and
a
clientele
that
like
to
go
out
clubbing
.
this
people
do
not
necessarily
see
themselves
as
deviant
in
any
way
when
they
have
take
alcohol
and
will
go
home
after
enjoy
a
responsible
night
out
.
curb
that
person
's
behaviour
through
legislation
will
not
necessarily
create
a
panacea
for
how
alcohol
be
consume
in
this
country
.
the
vast
majority
of
people
behave
responsibly
,
like
to
go
out
and
have
a
varied
night
,
such
as
the
night
provide
by
a
facility
such
as
the
Gaiety
Theatre
.
restrict
that
type
of
licence
will
not
necessarily
change
the
culture
.
although
the
alcohol
advisory
group
make
recommendation
with
regard
to
closing
time
,
not
all
of
its
recommendation
be
necessarily
contain
in
the
Bill
,
from
what
I
have
read
.
I
repeat
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
's
point
that
the
sale
of
alcohol
Bill
must
deal
with
the
cultural
aspect
of
alcohol
consumption
in
this
country
by
modify
closing
time
and
the
right
to
be
able
to
purchase
alcohol
in
a
supermarket
or
off
-
licence
.
make
provision
whereby
a
certain
aspect
of
a
supermarket
have
to
be
close
off
and
all
alcohol
move
behind
a
counter
be
totally
ludicrous
.
I
welcome
the
change
announce
in
the
minister
's
speech
and
the
overtone
in
that
regard
.
with
regard
to
early
morning
house
,
while
I
understand
the
Bill
must
go
through
committee
stage
,
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
it
almost
criminalise
that
who
have
early
morning
licence
and
seek
to
convey
a
impression
that
anyone
with
such
a
licence
be
the
purveyor
of
all
sort
of
iniquity
.
many
people
,
some
of
they
constituent
of
mine
,
have
work
either
as
docker
or
have
work
night
shift
all
they
life
.
due
to
they
pattern
of
sleeping
follow
a
night
shift
,
they
will
enjoy
a
pint
in
the
morning
in
the
early
house
and
will
then
proceed
home
in
a
proper
and
orderly
fashion
.
of
course
,
there
have
be
instance
where
early
house
have
probably
have
some
degree
of
anti-social
behaviour
but
this
be
not
outside
the
norm
of
any
other
establishment
hold
a
normal
licence
.
the
advisory
group
do
not
undertake
any
quantitative
or
qualitative
study
.
I
do
not
know
of
one
licensee
in
the
early
morning
trade
to
whom
I
speak
who
have
a
visit
from
any
departmental
official
during
the
framing
of
this
legislation
.
I
believe
this
measure
be
include
as
a
afterthought
and
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
make
some
concession
in
this
regard
.
in
conclusion
,
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
see
sense
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
cultural
aspect
of
alcohol
consumption
,
the
link
between
the
cultural
aspect
and
education
have
to
be
expound
more
vociferously
by
the
government
.
the
only
way
we
will
change
the
culture
be
by
a
process
of
education
.
I
do
not
believe
some
of
the
provision
in
the
Bill
would
necessarily
change
that
culture
and
,
in
fact
,
they
would
drive
alcohol
more
into
a
underground
mode
.
while
I
welcome
the
Bill
in
some
respects
,
I
be
glad
the
change
the
minister
have
propose
will
now
be
make
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
the
project
cost
of
fully
clean
up
the
site
be
estimate
to
be
in
the
region
of
€300
million
and
that
this
be
a
determine
factor
in
the
government
's
decision
to
send
a
letter
to
the
contractor
on
18
April
,
as
report
in
today
's
Irish
Examiner
,
state
that
the
require
course
of
action
would
be
to
''
cap
the
lagoon
with
inert
slag
material
(
or
other
such
suitable
available
material
)
,
pend
a
detailed
risk
assessment
of
the
entire
site
''
?
the
government
find
out
how
much
it
would
cost
to
clean
up
the
site
and
be
now
seek
to
spin
the
matter
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
the
subcontractor
on
the
site
be
act
outside
they
station
or
ultra
vire
and
be
now
seek
to
put
the
blame
on
they
.
when
the
government
realise
that
it
have
unearth
such
a
problem
,
it
refuse
to
acknowledge
it
and
seek
to
cover
it
up
.
its
intention
,
in
the
first
instance
,
be
never
to
fully
assess
and
continue
the
work
that
be
necessary
on
the
site
.
this
be
a
bombshell
to
the
people
who
reside
in
the
vicinity
of
the
site
.
they
think
that
the
government
be
act
in
good
faith
when
it
decide
that
the
Haulbowline
site
would
be
clear
.
for
the
government
to
state
that
the
contract
only
cover
above
-
surface
work
and
not
sub
-
surface
work
be
a
attempt
to
cover
up
the
problem
that
exist
from
a
subterranean
point
of
view
.
its
intention
be
never
to
expend
the
fund
necessary
to
clean
up
the
site
and
make
it
safe
for
that
who
reside
and
work
in
its
vicinity
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
specifically
address
the
point
in
the
letter
date
18
April
2008
because
it
be
the
most
pertinent
point
relate
to
this
issue
.
the
local
authority
have
wash
its
hand
of
the
matter
.
it
say
it
be
with
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
195
to
197
,
inclusive
,
together
.
since
2002
,
the

I
wish
to
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
for
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
to
confirm
if
material
,
which
be
remove
from
slag
heap
at
Haulbowline
,
be
use
in
road
construction
or
for
other
use
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
the
quantity
of
material
remove
,
whether
the
material
be
examine
for
toxicity
and
,
if
necessary
,
treat
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
the
name
of
the
company
or
company
that
extract
the
material
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
where
the
material
be
use
and
if
the
requisite
licence
be
in
place
;
and
the
need
for
he
to
confirm
that
all
potentially
hazardous
material
remove
from
the
site
can
be
account
for
.
in
light
of
the
revelation
by
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
,
we
know
material
be
move
from
this
site
to
the
mainland
.
the
current
investigation
,
therefore
,
must
also
examine
material
carry
off
site
.
we
need
to
know
where
the
material
be
transport
to
and
how
it
be
transport
.
be
a
licence
grant
to
transport
it
?
be
only
inert
material
transport
?
be
the
material
form
part
of
a
slag
heap
somewhere
in
County
Cork
?
give
the
material
be
transport
by
a
company
base
in
Mallow
,
when
do
it
transfer
to
Mallow
?
be
the
material
still
in
Mallow
or
have
it
be
deposit
in
municipally
license
dump
in
north
Cork
?
be
material
deposit
in
non-licensed
facility
?
can
the
minister
confirm
whether
some
material
have
end
up
in
other
location
in
north
Cork
?
will
the
minister
,
on
foot
of
this
revelation
,
consider
a
further
investigation
and
use
the
power
vested
in
he
to
seek
to
ensure
complete
traceability
of
all
material
?
will
he
wide
the
remit
of
the
current
assessment
of
the
site
to
ensure
all
traceable
material
,
both
on
and
off
site
,
come
within
the
remit
of
that
investigation
?
in
light
of
this
revelation
,
I
also
call
on
the
minister
to
meet
the
elect
representative
of
east
Cork
and
the
harbour
area
and
,
in
particular
,
the
mayor
of
Cobh
immediately
to
listen
to
they
concern
.
in
the
time
available
,
it
have
not
be
possible
to
identify
and
assemble
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
.
my
department
be
in
the
process
of
identify
and
assemble
the
information
and
I
will
revert
to
the

as

that
this
government
would
expect
we
to
come
into
this
house
,
take
the
Bill
that
be
before
we
and
accept
it
as
a
fait
accompli
without
any
critical
assessment
be
a
gross
underestimation
and
a
gross
insult
to
that
we
represent
.
the
amendment
that
have
be
put
forward
by
the
Labour
Party
be
sensible
because
they
seek
to
give
a
parliamentary
oversight
to
the
process
that
be
about
to
be
undertake
here
.
the
amendment
on
the
financial
aspect
—
I
refer
specifically
to
amendment
no.
24
—
to
the
effect
that
a
equity
stake
could
be
take
by
the
State
in
the
event
of
a
call
on
one
of
the
loan
be
something
that
should
be
consider
.
the
people
of
this
country
would
then
have
some
sort
of
a
stake
and
say
in
the
control
of
the
banking
system
into
the
future
.
the
other
issue
relate
to
the
power
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
in
any
parliamentary
democracy
there
must
be
check
and
balance
.
what
be
be
propose
by
the
government
in
its
current
form
give
undue
power
to
the
Minister
for
Finance
and
the
amendment
that
we
have
put
forward
would
seek
to
keep
that
in
check
.
I
do
not
want
to
engage
in
a
rhetorical
speech
here
about
the
nature
of
global
financial
capitalism
,
but
what
we
need
in
this
country
,
which
we
can
bring
about
only
through
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
,
be
a
great
degree
of
regulation
that
will
ensure
that
the
confidence
that
have
always
be
in
the
banking
sector
will
continue
.
unlike
deputy
Gogarty
,
I
do
not
envisage
that
we
should
return
to
the
gold
standard
.
confidence
be
all
important
but
if
the
taxpayer
of
this
country
be
be
ask
to
underwrite
this
,
there
should
be
some
pain
for
the
bank
,
there
should
be
some
quid
pro
quo
,
and
there
should
be
a
possibility
that
the
State
would
at
some
future
date
have
a
degree
of
equity
in
the
banking
system
,
if
necessary
.
that
be
what
be
be
propose
,
and
that
there
would
be
complete
transparency
in
that
process
as
well
.
we
amendment
be
reasonable
and
should
be
take
on
board
.

may
we

give
that
this

I
be

to
get
my
tooth
into
legislation
,
but
we
have
not
have
any
from
the
Department
during

time

we
also
deserve
a
explanation
for
this
.
we
go
through
the

charade
every
week
.
member
want

but
be
prevent
from
do
so
.
we
need
to
have
some
light
on
the
rule
and
regulation
because
this
be
a
archaic
institution
in
the
way
it
be
be
operate

in
reference
to
the
minister
's
speech
,
particularly
where
he
deal
with
the
principle
of
taxation
,
he
say
the
imposition
of
tax
must
be
fair
and
equitable
and
that
a
high
rate
must
apply
to
that
on
high
income
.
that
sound
familiar
in
that
it
read
exactly
like
my
old
leave
certificate
economics
Folens
textbook
and
whoever
write
that
probably
do
the
leave
certificate
around
the
same
time
as
myself
.
however
,
I
always
understand
from
my
leave
certificate
economics
that
taxation
should
be
progressive
,
not
regressive
.
in
this
instance
,
the
1
%
levy
be
regressive
.
that
on
the
margin
and
people
who
predominantly
probably
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
be
be
punish
for
they
loyalty
.
they
be
the
people
who
do
not
benefit
extensively
during
the
boom
year
.
instead
,
they
go
out
every
day
to
do
as
they
always
do
and
now
they
be
be
punish
.
it
be
the
wrong
strategy
and
a
regressive
measure
.
when
one
take
account
of
the
increase
in
vat
and
other
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
,
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
they
real
income
.
the
real
income
of
that
in
the
low
income
bracket
will
be
severely
affect
and
for
that
reason
we
oppose
this
measure
.
on
the
price
of
tobacco
,
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
measure
on
the
basis
that
it
will
act
as
a
deterrent
.
however
,
in
a
effort
to
curb
tobacco
consumption
,
we
should
encourage
people
to
use
substitute
product
and
allow
that
product
to
be
free
of
vat
.
product
such
as
Nicorette
should
be
delist
—
as
currently
they
can
only
be
sell
in
pharmacy
—
and
allow
to
be
sell
in
supermarket
and
to
a
wide
range
of
people
.
I
call
for
such
a
measure
in
the
previous
budget
.
I
suspect
one
of
the
thing
at
play
here
be
that
the
Irish
Pharmaceutical
Union
be
firmly
in
control
of
that
issue
.
I
take
the
measure
at
face
value
if
it
be
a
question
of
equity
but
it
should
be
consider
in
a
wide
context
if
it
be
consider
as
a
health
measure
.
if
I
be
a
average
Fianna
Fáil
voter
,
a
male
,
who
like
to
back
a
horse
,
maybe
enjoy
a
glass
of
wine
—
—
—
—
and
drive
a
petrol
car
—
—
—
—
and
I
be
a
low
or
middle
income
earner
,
I
would
be
apoplectic
when
study
this
budget
.
many
people
who
fit
that
demographic
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
in
the
last
election
and
now
they
will
think
seriously
about
how
they
will
vote
the
next
time
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
the
government
do
not
put
any
vat
on
child
's
clothes
or
footwear
because
,
by
God
,
if
it
do
,
we
would
definitely
be
go
back
to
the
1980
.
I
refer
to
the
stamp
duty
on
cheque
and
bill
of
exchange
.
while
many
people
engage
in
on
-
line
banking
and
make
electronic
payment
,
we
have
not
reach
the
stage
where
the
bulk
of
people
make
such
payment
by
that
means
.
the
facility
do
not
exist
in
the
community
or
the
commercial
sector
.
for
example
,
if
one
go
to
a
builder
's
provider
it
be
not
always
possible
to
make
electronic
payment
.
this
be
a
unfair
measure
,
especially
for
old
people
who
still
rely
on
the
use
of
a
cheque
book
.
this
be
a
sneaky
way
to
raise
a
few
bob
.
let
we
suppose
a
person
have
a
mortgage
and
there
be
a
life
assurance
policy
tack
on
to
that
mortgage
.
be
that
person
susceptible
to
the
propose
increase
vis
-à
-
vis
life
assurance
and
investment
fund
?
this
would
have
the
net
effect
of
increase
the
cost
of
mortgage
for
a
certain
sector
.
it
be
propose
that
this
would
yield
€
13
million
per
year
.
I
seek
clarification
on
this
matter
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
ask
a
question
.
on
a
point
of

it
be
very
patriotic
.
most
of
the
point
about
the
health
effect
of
this
budget
have
be
well
cover
by
my
colleague
.
they
highlight
how
the
budget
have
impose
numerous
stealth
tax
and
cut
.
deputy
Shortall
have
outline
the
so
-
call
treacherous
30
.
a
rational
analysis
of
this
budget
would
leave
one
in
no
doubt
but
that
every
single
citizen
will
be
adversely
affect
.
the
Taoiseach
yesterday
call
the
nation
to
patriotic
action
.
in
a
late
deposition
,
for
want
of
a
good
word
,
the
Taoiseach
state
this
government
be
predicate
on
a
philosophy
of
Republican
egalitarianism
.
when
the
Minister
for
Finance
finish
he
speech
yesterday
and
the
backbencher
rise
to
applaud
he
,
I
think
they
be
go
to
spontaneously
burst
into
a
rendition
of
"
Wrap
the
Green
Flag
round
I
"
.
from
where
I
stand
as
a
Republican
and
as
somebody
who
subscribe
to
that
Republican
ideal
and
that
ideal
of
egalitarianism
,
this
budget
be
far
from
that
.
if
I
be
a
elderly
person
today
,
or
if
I
be
somebody
who
be
survive
on
a
low
income
or
if
I
be
unemployed
and
I
be
seek
some
solace
from
this
budget
,
none
would
be
find
.
there
be
nothing
in
this
budget
that
cover
that
people
who
would
subscribe
to
that
same
ideal
,
namely
,
every
single
citizen
.
if
it
be
a
egalitarian
budget
,
it
would
not
have
introduce
a
levy
of
1
%
on
all
income
.
if
we
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
taxation
must
be
equitable
and
fair
and
it
must
abide
by
the
canon
of
taxation
,
then
the
tax
rate
would
have
be
increase
and
the
minister
would
not
have
increase
taxation
on
all
income
.
I
wish
to
nail
the
lie
that
this
be
somehow
a
progressive
measure
.
what
it
seek
to
do
be
further
decrease
take
-
home
pay
and
real
income
.
the
people
most
affect
will
be
that
on
the
margin
or
in
the
low
-
income
bracket
.
if
this
be
couple
with
the
increase
in
stamp
duty
,
the
increase
charge
for
third
level
registration
,
increase
in
vat
and
in
DIRT
,
no
matter
what
way
,
such
people
will
be
catch
on
all
side
.
this
be
not
the
action
of
a
government
that
care
about
level
taxation
in
a
truly
egalitarian
manner
.
I
have
a
call
today
from
a
lady
from
Cloyne
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
.
this
lady
be
married
,
there
be
two
income
come
into
the
family
and
she
have
four
child
.
this
be
a
person
who
be
rational
in
she
assessment
of
the
current
climate
.
she
and
she
husband
have
live
through
the
1970
and
1980
and
have
begin
to
raise
a
family
in
that
time
when
she
husband
and
herself
be
pay
50
pence
in
the
pound
and
possibly
more
in
taxation
.
she
have
a
22
-
year
old
son
and
she
be
now
actively
encourage
he
to
emigrate
.
she
tell
I
she
can
see
no
hope
for
he
in
the
present
climate
in
this
country
.
she
be
tell
he
he
good
chance
of
get
a
good
job
and
survive
in
this
world
would
be
to
get
out
of
here
.
there
be
nothing
that
she
could
see
in
the
current
climate
that
would
give
she
or
she
family
any
hope
.
she
tell
I
that
she
husband
be
near
retirement
age
and
that
they
both
work
hard
for
every
single
penny
they
earn
.
they
never
ask
for
anything
from
the
State
.
they
never
have
medical
card
.
they
pay
the
high
rate
of
tax
in
the
1970
and
1980
.
they
send
they
kid
to
college
but
they
never
qualify
for
third
level
grant
.
that
family
be
representative
of
thousand
of
family
who
today
will
have
to
pay
the
price
of
the
profligacy
of
the
past
seven
or
eight
year
.
they
will
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
that
deficit
of
approximately
€
12
billion
,
if
the
figure
be
to
be
believe
.
as
she
public
representative
,
what
be
I
to
say
to
she
to
give
she
any
hope
for
the
future
?
I
do
not
blame
she
for
the
cynicism
that
she
express
about
the
political
system
.
when
I
hear
the
government
wrap
the
language
of
this
budget
in
patriotic
fervour
and
Republican
egalitarianism
,
it
stick
in
my
craw
a
little
bit
.
the
government
,
notwithstand
the
external
force
we
hear
so
much
about
,
must
take
some
level
of
political
responsibility
.
if
we
be
on
that
side
of
the
House
,
we
would
have
to
take
political
responsibility
if
the
card
be
stack
in
the
same
way
.
this
be
what
the
people
want
,
particularly
that
who
be
on
low
to
middle
income
.
they
do
not
want
always
to
be
force
to
pay
the
price
of
government
profligacy
.
this
be
not
what
they
have
subscribe
to
.
they
be
,
by
they
nature
,
always
paye
worker
and
they
be
the
people
that
work
the
hard
,
put
they
child
through
college
and
do
not
expect
a
lot
from
the
State
but
they
do
not
expect
to
be
punish
by
the
State
either
and
that
be
what
this
budget
have
do
to
that
people
.
if
we
be
talk
about
egalitarianism
and
about
equity
in
the
system
,
then
I
call
on
the
government
to
reverse
some
of
that
measure
to
at
least
release
the
real
income
or
let
they
claw
back
some
of
that
real
income
they
have
lose
through
this
measure
.
this
would
be
equitable
and
fair
and
there
would
be
a
great
share
of
the
burden
of
responsibility
.
as
a
high
-
income
earner
,
I
would
be
happy
to
take
on
a
great
burden
if
necessary
.
it
be
often
say
that
the
true
mark
of
a
egalitarian
society
be
how
old
people
be
treat
.
this
budget
have
claw
back
the
medical
card
for
the
over
-
70
and
this
be
nothing
short
of
a
disgrace
.
I
will
not
use
superlative
or
come
out
with
a
soundbite
but
it
be
unfair
on
that
people
.
we
have
create
expectation
and
put
in
place
a
system
that
people
have
become
familiar
with
.
when
they
come
to
the
autumn
year
of
they
life
they
have
the
peace
of
mind
of
know
they
could
go
to
the
gp
when
they
want
to
and
have
that
little
entitlement
when
inflation
and
the
cost
of
living
be
increase
.
they
no
long
have
that
little
cushion
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
reverse
that
as
a
egalitarian
and
truly
Republican
measure
.
if
the
government
subscribe
to
that
ideal
it
will
reverse
this
measure
.

I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
O'Shea
and
Ferris
.
I
wish
to
speak
about
the
subject
of
this
motion
.
I
will
stick
to
the
point
of
this
debate
,
which
have
go
all
over
the
shop
,
quite
frankly
.
the
purpose
of
the
motion
be
to
seek
a
extension
to
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
.
the
Labour
Party
would
support
such
a
extension
,
not
for
political
expediency
or
point
-
scoring
,
but
because
we
realise
that
a
certain
number
of
farmer
will
not
be
able
to
make
the
deadline
.
we
support
such
farmer
for
reason
of
common
sense
and
pragmatism
,
some
of
which
have
already
be
outline
.
I
be
aware
of
farmer
who
have
not
be
able
to
get
contractor
to
do
the
work
which
be
require
under
the
scheme
.
the
poor
weather
we
have
endure
this
year
have
delay
some
building
work
.
many
farmer
will
not
be
able
to
meet
the
deadline
as
a
consequence
of
a
myriad
of
other
circumstance
,
which
I
will
not
repeat
.
there
be
merit
in
raise
,
in
a
genuine
way
,
the
possibility
of
a
extension
to
the
deadline
.
some
people
will
be
adversely
affect
if
a
change
be
not
make
.
the
valid
point
make
early
by
deputy
Deenihan
,
which
have
also
be
raise
by
the
Irish
Creamery
Milk
Suppliers
Organisation
,
ICMSA
,
deserve
further
examination
.
I
refer
to
the
interpretation
of
State
aid
and
the
interpretation
of
the
scheme
.
I
wish
to
quote
from
a
letter
send
by
the
president
of
the
ICMSA
to
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
on
25
August
last
.
the
letter
,
which
get
to
the
heart
of
the
debate
on
this
motion
,
read
:
dear
minister
I
wish
to
refer
again
to
the
31
December
2008
deadline
under
the
Farm
Waste
Management
Scheme
.
while
we
be
all
aware
of
the
background
to
the
scheme
and
the
setting
of
the
December
2006
and
December
2008
deadline
,
there
be
clearly
a
major
problem
for
a
grow
number
of
farmer
if
the
31
December
2008
deadline
be
to
be
interpret
as
mean
that
the
work
must
be
complete
and
approve
by
you
Department
on
or
before
that
date
.
we
do
not
accept
that
this
be
the
only
interpretation
.
I
believe
,
base
on
the
EC
Guideline
for
State
Aid
in
the
Agriculture
and
Forestry
Sector
,
that
Ireland
should
propose
that
the
31
December
2008
deadline
can
be
meet
by
a
individual
farmer
where
the
building
work
be
to
be
complete
or
commence
after
the
31
December
2008
if
that
farmer
have
a
legally
bind
contract
for
the
construction
of
the
building
and
or
supply
of
material
in
place
on
or
before
31
December
2008
.
this
procedure
,
reliance
on
a
legally
bind
contract
,
be
use
quite
often
for
the
phase
introduction
or
termination
of
tax
relief
measure
.
I
believe
that
this
procedure
can
be
readily
adopt
by
you
Department
and
would
meet
the
requirement
set
down
in
the
EC
Guideline
for
State
Aid
in
the
Agriculture
and
Forestry
Sector
.
that
proposal
,
which
be
base
on
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
state
aid
guideline
,
represent
common
sense
.
I
echo
deputy
Deenihan
's
comment
on
it
.
in
he
response
to
this
motion
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Smith
,
do
not
respond
to
deputy
Deenihan
's
point
.
I
call
on
one
of
the
government
deputy
to
respond
to
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
in
a
honest
manner
.
be
this
interpretation
of
the
guideline
valid
?
I
do
not
wish
to
play
politics
with
this
issue
.
a
balance
and
reasonable
view
be
be
put
forward
by
a
group
of
farmer
who
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
submit
the
card
a
due
to
genuine
reason
.
it
be
reasonable
for
we
to
echo
the
view
of
that
farmer
,
notwithstand
what
deputy
Conlon
and
other
have
say
in
support
of
the
scheme
.
we
have
have
superfluous
speech
by
government
backbencher
,
but
there
be
a
genuine
issue
that
need
to
be
address
.
before
the
clock
run
down
on
this
debate
,
I
hope
that
the
government
will
come
back
with
a
response
to
the
point
that
I
and
deputy
Deenihan
have
raise
.
there
be
a
genuine
concern
among
a
small
minority
of
farmer
and
that
must
be
address
.
my
Department
have
no
such
investment
and
be
not
aware
of
any
such
investment
hold
by
body
under
its
aegis
.
my
Department
have
no
such
investment
and
be
not
aware
of
any
such
investment
hold
by
body
under
its
aegis
.
I
be
remind
of
"
Joe
the
plumber
"
.
if
he
be
look
at
we
and
examine
this
scheme
,
would
he
and
he
family
have
confidence
that
the
scheme
be
implement
would
be
suitable
to
he
need
and
requirement
?
he
would
not
.
when
the
minister
first
announce
the
scheme
—
—
I
will
put
my
question
.
the
minister
promise
he
would
go
in
deep
.
this
scheme
allow
for
the
possibility
of
go
in
deep
without
go
in
deep
to
the
bank
.
I
see
nothing
in
the
scheme
that
change
the
regulatory
framework
we
have
see
heretofore
.
my
question
be
specifically
on
page
11
of
the
scheme
,
point
45
,
where
the
minister
refer
to
corporate
social
responsibility
.
he
state
,
"
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
,
on
behalf
of
all
cover
institution
,
submit
a
bi-annual
report
to
the
minister
on
goal
and
target
lay
down
by
the
minister
in
relation
to
corporate
social
responsibility
"
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
elaborate
on
that
statement
because
until
we
can
force
a
recalibration
of
the
modus
of
corporate
social
responsibility
and
how
bank
do
they
business
,
it
will
be
more
of
the
same
and
there
will
be
no
change
to
the
banking
culture
.
there
must
be
a
change
to
the
banking
culture
.
that
question
be
on
the
mind
of
the
people
I
represent
and
it
be
a
legitimate
question
.
I
would
like
a
further
teasing
out
of
the
appointment
of
non-executive
director
.
the
minister
previously
speak
about
the
problem
that
would
arise
about
the
legal
personality
if
one
be
to
appoint
people
directly
to
the
board
.
be
there
no
provision
that
can
be
make
that
would
serve
the
public
interest
by
amend
any
legal
provision
that
would
give
the
people
the
power
as
oversee
executive
on
board
of
bank
?
this
state
pay
the
Financial
Regulator
and
he
office
€
57
million
per
annum
.
we
have
see
no
bang
for
we
buck
.
nothing
in
this
document
—
—
I
will
.
I
see
nothing
in
this
document
that
will
give
any
solace
,
see
any
change
or
increase
the
power
of
the
Financial
Regulator
or
see
he
use
the
power
he
have
.
there
be
question
over
that
.
they
have
not
be
use
to
date
.
I
be
talk
about
the
behaviour
of
the
bank
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
elaborate
on
the
appointment
of
non-executive
director
.
I
can
examine
that
issue
but
we
might
be
constrain
by
the
current
arrangement
and
the
legislation
that
provide
for
it

the

that
who

the
safety

know
they
could

that

afford
to
they
.
we
have
lecture
last
week
from
the
Taoiseach
about
he
Republican
and
egalitarian
ideal
.
what
be
do
and
visit
upon
this
people
last
week
be
neither
Republican
nor
truly
egalitarian
.
it
run
counter
to
anything
that
be
Republican
or
egalitarian
.
in
the
short
time
I
have
,
I
implore
the
government
to
reverse
this
decision
.
if
the
thousand
of
people
who
come
onto
the
street
of
Dublin
today
be
anything
to
go
by
in
term
of
deliver
a
short
sharp
message
to
the
government
,
today
be
the
day
it
happen
.
the
government
must
listen
to
that
people
who
have
reach
they
autumn
year
and
be
now
worried
and
full
of
angst
about
this
measure
.
if
we
be
truly
to
be
a
republic
in
the
pure
sense
of
that
word
,
we
must
reverse
this
measure
.
the

I
can
confirm
that
a

will
be
provide
to
the
school
to
which
the

refer
to
make
good
the
damage
to

in
the
meantime
the
Department
be
work
with
the
school
to
find
a
solution
to
the

immediate
accommodation
need
and
the

expect
to
have
a

when
the

return
for
mid

break
.
in
relation
to
progression
of

permanent
project
,
the
Department
be
cognisant
of
the
site
restriction
which
would
impede
further
expansion
of
the
exist
school
.
Greenfield
provision
for
this
school
will
be
consider
in
the
context
of
the
Department
's
on
-
go
multi-annual
school
building
and
modernisation
programme
.
every
time
I
walk
into
this
Chamber
,
I
pass
a
statue
of
Thomas
Davis
,
a
fellow
Mallow
man
famous
for
the
quote
,
"
educate
that
you
may
be
free
"
.
the
government
,
by
its
action
in
recent
week
,
have
seek
to
curb
this
freedom
.
when
Davis
speak
of
freedom
,
he
may
have
speak
in
the
context
of
political
liberation
but
he
also
speak
in
the
context
of
the
freedom
of
idea
,
thought
and
consciousness
.
if
we
be
to
educate
we
child
in
this
nation
in
the
context
that
Davis
speak
about
we
must
give
they
all
the
tool
we
can
.
the
government
,
by
its
action
last
week
,
seek
to
limit
that
freedom
and
limit
the
give
of
that
tool
to
that
child
and
it
should
be
ashamed
of
its
action
.
when
I
look
across
the
bench
of
this
house
I
see
certain
member
of
the
Green
Party
play
the
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
and
run
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
the
hound
.
I
say
to
they
that
if
they
be
true
to
they
political
conscience
and
cree
they
will
vote
with
the
Labour
Party
on
this
motion
and
vote
for
the
child
of
the
nation
and
for
the
proper
education
policy
that
we
wish
to
see
in
this
land
.
in
speak
to
this
motion
I
speak
for
the
school
in
my
constituency
.
I
speak
for
the
child
of
Ballyhooley
national
school
and
the
people
in
Carrigtwohill
,
Fermoy
,
the
Mercy
national
school
in
Cobh
,
Midleton
College
and
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
this
be
among
many
who
make
representation
to
I
about
the
swingeing
cutback
that
will
be
implement
and
the
adverse
effect
they
will
have
on
the
day
to
day
operation
of
they
school
.
it
must
be
admit
that
great
stride
have
be
make
in
many
aspect
of
education
during
the
past
ten
year
,
although
not
at
a
pace
we
would
wish
to
see
.
however
,
it
be
wrong
for
any
government
to
roll
back
that
achievement
in
one
fall
swoop
and
send
we
headlong
back
to
where
we
be
in
the
1980
.
this
be
not
the
mark
of
a
nation
make
progress
.
I
urge
the
government
to
think
hard
about
its
action
.
if
we
be
go
to
flourish
as
a
nation
we
must
look
to
future
generation
.
the
way
we
can
flourish
,
socially
and
economically
,
be
by
ensure
every
child
bar
none
have
the
good
chance
in
life
he
or
she
can
have
and
have
a
education
system
that
be
world
class
.
anything
else
be
not
what
we
want
.
this
motion
be
reasonable
.
it
speak
to
the
genuine
fear
the
people
have
about
the
way
they
see
the
education
system
go
.
the
people
beyond
this
wall
,
the
people
of
this
land
,
who
have
shout
loudly
,
and
thank
God
for
they
voice
,
do
not
want
to
see
they
child
treat
this
way
nor
should
the
Legislature
treat
they
child
this
way
.
we
want
to
give
they
a
fair
chance
and
a
fair
opportunity
.
this
be
what
we
seek
through
this
motion
.
on
Friday
,
as
I
walk
down
the
main
street
of
Mallow
I
be
approach
by
transition
year
student
from
St.
Mary
's

school

they
flock
around
I
to
tell
I
they
will
not
be
able
to
carry
out
many
of
the
project
and
aspiration
they
have
for
they
transition
year
because
of
the
cut
.
they
ask
I
to
let
they
voice
be
hear
in
Dáil
Éireann
when
next
I
speak
on
the
subject
.
I
speak
for
that
girl
and
for
the
aspiration
they
have
.
I
speak
for
the
aspiration
I
have
when
I
be
they
age
and
for
the
educational
opportunity
I
have
which
be
limit
because
of
the
time
I
grow
up
in
during
the
1980
.
do
not
send
the
education
system
back
to
the
1980
.
let
we
think
forward
and
consider
the
investment
that
can
be
make
now
and
the
payoff
in
the
long
run
as
a
result
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
National

the
recent
budgetary
announcement
do
not
affect
the
criterion
use
for
the
allocation
of
additional
teaching
and
care
resource
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
this
be
to
do
with
legislation
.
I
will
get
the
same
answer
that
deputy
Michael
Creed
get
.
it
be
clear
from
the
early
reply
to
deputy
Michael
Creed
that
the
minister
will
not
budge
on
this
issue
.
today
,
a
recently
widow
lady
contact
I
whose
son
wish
to
take
over
the
family
farm
hold
.
he
would
have
be
a
ideal
applicant
for
this
two
scheme
.
however
,
as
they
be
go
through
a
process
of
grant
of
probate
,
he
be
not
in
a
position
to
send
he
application
before
14
October
.
the
legal
instrument
go
against
he
and
take
long
than
anticipate
.
will
the
minister
allow
for
some
degree
of
discretion
and
fairness
for
that
who
be
in
the
process
of
apply
?
on
14
October
the
two
scheme
be
cut
down
in
one
fall
swoop
without
any
notice
period
.
that
do
not
allow
individual
,
such
as
that
I
have
just
mention
,
to
have
some
fairness
in
submit
they
application
.
if
they
have
some
notice
,
they
might
have
come
into
the
scheme
.
cut
the
scheme
off
on
14
October
be
the
wrong
way
to
go
about
it
.
will
the
minister
revisit
he
decision
for
the
sake
of
equity
and
fairness
?
nobody
question
the
validity
of
the
scheme
or
its
success
.
we
all
agree
that
government
policy
have
be
sound
in
this
regard
.
what
we
be
ask
for
be
some
degree
of
discretion
.
there
should
be
a
extension
beyond
14
October
to
allow
this
people
to
make
they
application
.
there
must
be
some
degree
of
flexibility
on
this
issue
.
as
have
already
be
say
,
that
people
who
be
on
the
point
of
make
they
application
have
a
reasonable
expectation
,
because
they
have
go
through
the
process
of
apply
,
that
they
would
be
within
the
timeframe
.
the
minister
have
carry
out
a
miserly
and
mean
-
spirit
act
towards
that
who
set
out
in
good
faith
to
participate
in
the
scheme
.
it
be
a
sad
indictment
of
current
government
policy
.
the
minister
should
tell
that
to
the
widow
I
mention
.
the
original
question
be
base
on
the
premise
that
budgetary
cut
have
be
apply
across
the
board
in
the
agriculture
sector
.
this
be
the
only
opportunity
available
to
I
to
highlight
some
of
that
cut
.
for
example
,
investment
in
research
and
training
have
decrease
by
13
%
.
similar
reduction
have
be
apply
in
area
like
food
safety
,
health
and
welfare
,
plant
health
,
income
and
market
support
and
income
support
for
disadvantaged
area
.
when
one
examine
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
's
entire
programme
of
expenditure
,
one
have
to
conclude
that
the
government
's
ability
to
implement
the
programme
for
government
be
seriously
hamper
.
that
of
we
responsible
for
the
agriculture
brief
have
not
be
give
any
legislation
to
consider
since
the
last
election
.
when
will
the
animal
welfare
Bill
be
publish
,
in
line
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
?
the
extensive
consultation
period
in
that
regard
do
not
seem
to
have
come
to
a
conclusion
.
on
what
date
will
it
be
conclude
?
I
would
also
like
to
ask
about
the
propose
establishment
of
a
all
-
Ireland
GM
-
free
zone
.
when
do
the
Department
envisage
that
this
process
will
be
conclude
and
this
policy
will
be
implement
?
when
do
the
minister
envisage
that
the
target
of
dedicate
5
%
of
acreage
to
organic
farmland
will
be
reach
?
the
European
Commission
recently
announce
that
it
do
not
envisage
that
mandatory
country
of
origin
labelling
will
be
introduce
.
the
programme
for
government
state
that
mandatory
country
of
origin
food
labelling
will
be
extend
to
sheep
,
pig
and
poultry
meat
.
will
that
measure
be
implement
?
on
the
modulation
issue
,
I
be
reassure
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
minister
's
statement
on
the
move
from
pillar
one
to
pillar
two
.
be
there
a
political
appetite
in
the
Council
of
Minister
for
the
rate
of
change
from
pillar
1
to
pillar
2
as
envisage
by
the
commission
proposal
?
my
second
question
be
on
climate
change
proposal
.
there
be
a
view
that
the
basis
of
measurement
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
from
agriculture
be
predicate
on
a
faulty
methodology
.
will
the
minister
examine
that
methodology
and
request
a
independent
,
scientific
analysis
of
it
?
it
will
have
far
-
reach
effect
on
Irish
agriculture
and
that
be
the
reason
for
my
question
.
it
be
clear
that
there
be
still
issue
of
concern
relate
to
Brazilian
beef
.
while
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
and
acknowledge
that
beef
export
from
Brazil
be
confine
to
a
small
number
of
herd
,
the
amount
within
that
herd
would
probably
far
outweigh
the
Irish
national
herd
.
the
number
in
question
be
still
significant
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
and
accept
that
the
Department
have
choose
the
correct
course
of
action
in
the
circumstance
.
be
I
to
take
it
that
the
answer
be
the
same
as
that
give
for
question
no.
8
?
I
wish
to
ask
a
supplementary
question
.
I
will
take
the
answer
as
read
but
I
wish
to
state
that
money
be
be
take
out
of
farmer
's
real
income
here
.
some
of
the
measure
that
have
be
implement
in
this
budget
,
include
this
one
,
will
bring
about
a
further
demise
in
agricultural
productivity
.
the
Department
have
ride
roughshod
over
some
of
that
programme
since
then
.
the
minister
be
be
very
selective
,
with
all
due
respect
.
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
be
a
result
of
obligation
under
European
Commission
rule
which
have
to
be
implement
.
this
measure
will
further
undermine
the
rural
economy
and
that
be
the
bottom
line
.

into

when
do

Dooley
believe
that

how
many
thousand
of

?
I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Broughan
,
Morgan
and
Costello
.
I
will
begin
with
a
quotation
from
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
report
entitle
Innovation
in
Ireland
publish
in
2008
:
Ireland

on

...
I
repeat
the
second
sentence
:
"

to
respond

of

embrace
a

"
.
I
listen
carefully
to
the
minister
and
it
be
hard
to
disagree
with
what
have
be
say
in
that
one
sense
there
be
a
proactive
approach
and
a
continuation
of
strategy
to
maintain
employment
.
however
,
be
I
one
of
the
32000
plus
person
make
redundant
and
thus
have
to
apply
between
1
January
and
the
end
of
this
month
for
assistance
under
the
redundancy
scheme
,
this
would
not
provide
I
with
too
much
solace
.
I
know
of
a
particular
apprentice
—
there
be
hundred
like
he
—
who
,
even
if
he
want
,
could
not
return
to
complete
he
course
because
there
be
no
job
in
he
particular
field
.
the
construction
industry
have
dry
up
.
the
proof
of
this
be
the
current
lack
of
house
building
.
give
this
trend
,
apprentice
be
reluctant
to
continue
they
training
.
I
know
of
a
apprentice
who
,
have
complete
he
leave
certificate
examination
in
2006
,
decide
to
embark
on
a
few
year
'
travelling
.
when
he
return
home
he
take
up
a
apprenticeship
as
a
cabinet
maker
but
be
subsequently
lay
off
.
he
then
decide
,
give
the
trend
that
be
emerge
,
to
do
a
public
relation
course
.
when
the
person
concern
,
who
be
in
receipt
of
jobseeker
's
allowance
,
approach
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
in
respect
of
a
place
on
a
public
relation
course
he
be
tell
he
would
have
to
be
sign
on
for
156
day
before
he
would
quality
for
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
.
this
be
wherein
the
nub
of
the
problem
lie
.
I
refer
early
to
the
thousand
of
people
already
laid
-
off
and
make
redundant
,
many
of
whom
want
to
get
back
into
the
education
sphere
.
I
acknowledge
the
€
1.5
billion
allocation
for
FÁS
and
the
investment
in
sme
.
however
,
many
of
the
people
who
previously
work
in
research
and
development
and
high
-
end
it
job
now
want
to
do
mba
and
to
upskill
but
there
be
no
mechanism
through
which
they
can
re-enter
the
FÁS
or
SME
framework
without
they
incur
serious
economic
hardship
.
this
people
do
not
qualify
for
third
level
grant
or
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
as
they
be
already
in
receipt
of
the
jobseeker
's
allowance
.
be
I
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
House
I
would
be
re-examine
the
demographic
of
this
situation
in
term
of
where
the
lay
-
off
have
take
place
and
the
educational
attainment
of
that
involve
.
I
would
also
be
much
more
flexible
in
my
approach
,
which
be
what
the
government
will
have
to
be
if
unemployment
continue
to
rise
.
a
person
who
be
eligible
for
jobseeker
's
allowance
for
12
month
should
also
be
eligible
for
a
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
if
he
or
she
wish
to
upskill
by
re-enter
the
education
system
.
the
22500
people
currently
engage
in
community
employment
scheme
do
exceptional
work
.
however
,
many
of
this
people
be
hamper
after
a
few
year
by
the
principle
of
progression
,
of
which
we
hear
so
much
.
I
would
also
be
a
little
more
flexible
in
respect
of
the
requirement
to
quit
a
community
employment
scheme
after
a
specify
period
.
I
would
allow
for
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
in
term
of
permit
this
people
,
where
possible
,
to
continue
to
work
in
they
community
and
would
pay
they
the
allowance
require
in
this
regard
.
this
would
help
to
sustain
community
and
would
provide
this
people
with
employment
.
there
have
be
lay
-
off
in
a
wide
range
of
area
,
include
agriculture
,
banking
,
finance
and
insurance
.
a
wide
array
of
people
will
not
necessarily
fit
into
the
training
scheme
envisage
by
government
.
many
people
work
in
the
energy
,
manufacturing
,
building
and
civil
engineering
area
have
be
lay
-
off
and
will
not
get
work
any
time
soon
.
many
of
they
be
reliant
on
the
construction
industry
and
on
the
it
sector
,
in
particular
the
research
and
development
component
of
the
it
sector
,
a
area
almost
always
hit
first
during
a
downturn
.
this
people
be
unable
to
return
to
the
education
system
unless
they
pay
for
it
themselves
.
while
a
unemployed
single
person
with
savings
have
a
good
chance
of
access
a
third
level
course
,
a
unemployed
person
within
a
family
structure
will
need
to
put
aside
every
penny
to
meet
he
or
she
family
circumstance
.
the
government
need
to
apply
some
lateral
thinking
in
this
area
.
it
do
not
appear
to
have
internalise
the
full
extent
of
the
problem
face
unemployed
people
in
the
future
.
instead
of
quote
chapter
and
verse
in
this
house
on
that
which
we
know
already
—
one
have
only
to
look
at
the
Department
's
website
to
learn
what
be
be
spend
—
it
should
bring
forth
fresh
idea
in
regard
to
how
we
people
can
upskill
.
I
acknowledge
the
investment
in
fás
training
for
installation
scheme
and
so
on
.
it
be
once
say
to
I
that
the
next
boom
might
result
from
we
have
to
fix
some
of
the
faulty
and
dodgy
house
construct
in
haste
during
the
past
ten
year
.
it
may
be
that
such
a
scheme
will
be
require
.
however
,
we
must
also
cater
for
high
end
job
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
hundred
,
if
not
thousand
,
of
people
be
currently
unemployed
.
we
need
to
look
after
that
people
who
will
not
necessarily
fit
into
the
mechanism
prescribe
by
the
two
minister
in
they
response
.
I
reiterate
the
government
's
word
that
individual
need
to
respond
.
individual
want
to
respond
to
the
change
market
and
to
this
downturn
.
however
,
they
may
want
to
diversify
into
completely
different
area
of
education
.
this
,
for
some
people
,
be
a
opportunity
to
re-assess
from
where
they
come
.
if
we
be
talk
about
entrepreneurial
spirit
in
this
country
,
the
only
way
it
can
be
reinvigorate
be
if
the
€
179
million
allocate
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
or
€
90
million
spend
on
encourage
FDI
be
re-examine
and
perhaps
apportion
at
least
in
part
to
localised
scheme
for
people
who
have
that
kind
of
spirit
and
who
wish
to
create
indigenous
and
sme
-
type
industry
.
the
2009
budget
require
difficult
choice
to
be
make
across
all
area
of
public
expenditure
.
this
decision
be
make
to
control
public
expenditure
and
to
ensure
sustainability
in
the
long
run
.
in
this
respect
education
while
protect
to
a
much
great
extent
than
most
other
area
of
public
expenditure
could
not
be
totally
spare
.
prudent
management
of
the
government
finances
be
particularly
important
at
this
time
of
global
economic
uncertainty
when
tax
revenue
have
fall
so
significantly
and
when
world
economic
condition
be
so
serious
.
even
with
the
budget
measure
in
place
there
will
still
be
a
significantly
increase
borrowing
requirement
in
2009
.
the
government
's
commitment
to
education
be
clear
both
from
its
track
record
over
the
past
decade
in
provide
substantial
additional
resource
,
most
notably
extra
teacher
to
meet
previously
unmet
need
and
from
the
programme
the
government
set
for
itself
when
it
come
into
office
.
a
lot
have
change
in
the
past
year
and
the
first
and
foremost
imperative
be
that
we
stabilise
the
public
finances
.
it
be
only
by
do
so
that
we
can
shelter
gain
make
and
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
be
able
to
make
improvement
in
the
future
.
what
we
be
do
in
primary
school
from
September
next
be
staff
they
on
the
same
basis
as
they
be
staff
just
over
one
school
year
ago
.
in
term
of
the
position
in
respect
of
any
one
school
for
September
2009
,
school
be
currently
return
datum
to
my
Department
in
relation
to
they
enrolment
as
of
30
September
last
.
my
Department
have
commence
process
this
datum
although
all
school
have
not
yet
make
they
return
.
the
allocation
process
include
notification
to
school
will
commence
early
in
the
New
Year
.
the
allocation
process
include
appellate
mechanism
under
which
school
can
appeal
against
the
allocation
due
to
they
under
the
staffing
schedule
.
the
final
allocation
to
a
school
be
also
a
function
of
the
operation
of
the
redeployment
panel
which
provide
for
the
retention
of
a
teacher
in
a
exist
school
if
a

in
light
of
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
report
on
vulnerable
adult
and
the
law
,
which
have
be
publish
for
some
time
,
when
will
the
mental
capacity
Bill
be
publish
?
will
that
Bill
make
provision
to
make
a
person
a
ward
of
court
?
my
second
question
relate
to
the
animal
welfare
Bill
.
before
I
ask
about
the
date
for
publication
,
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
what
constitute
a
consultation
in
anticipation
of
she
answer
.
within
DEIS
,
the
commitment
give
to
early
year
education
be
that
"
the
Department
will
work
in
partnership
with
other
department
and
agency
to
complement
and
add
value
to
exist
childcare
programme
in
disadvantage
community
,
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
the
overall
care
and
education
need
of
the
child
concerned
be
meet
in
a
integrated
manner
.
"
my
department
be
work
with
agency
fund
through
the
Office
of
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
to
improve
the
quality
of
childcare
and
education
in
DEIS
pre-school
area
and
to
work
with
this
agency
on
prioritise
disadvantaged
area
.
one
question
need
to
be
address
regard
this
banking
crisis
,
namely
whether
the
government
guarantee
will
result
in
the
writing
off
of
private
debt
and
turn
that
into
public
debt
for
which
the
Irish
citizen
will
ultimately
pay
.
in
that
context
,
should
we
be
contemplate
the
writing
off
of
private
debt
to
avoid
a
probable
recourse
to
the
taxpayer
?
in
September
of
this
year
,
the
Central
Bank
publish
datum
show
that
the
M1
money
supply
—
the
physical
currency
circulate
in
the
economy
and
the
money
hold
on
deposit
account
—
be
shrink
rapidly
.
what
do
the
11
%
year
-
on
-
year
decrease
in
the
M1
money
supply
tell
we
?
Irish
business
have
less
money
in
they
account
.
they
have
become
stifle
,
they
cannot
repay
they
debt
and
they
cannot
access
credit
.
if
Irish
business
be
not
able
to
repay
they
debt
or
access
credit
,
the
bank
will
incur
further
loss
.
who
will
cover
such
loss
?
the
bank
guarantee
scheme
provide
for
the
Irish
taxpayer
to
cover
loss
to
bank
through
shrinkage
in
the
economy
.
if
banking
activity
be
shrink
,
then
bank
loss
be
inevitable
.
the
Labour
Party
be
propose
a
set
of
practical
measure
,
as
outline
by
deputy
Penrose
,
to
stimulate
the
economy
.
the
European
investment
Bank
,
rather
than
the
private
equity
capitalist
,
have
to
become
we
saviour
.
private
equity
capitalist
do
not
care
about
the
future
of
the
Irish
economy
.
as
soon
as
they
get
they
pound
of
flesh
,
they
move
on
to
the
next
target
.
it
should
be
note
that
the
Carlyle
Group
,
which
be
currently
flirt
with
one
of
this
country
's
bank
,
be
fund
by
Osama
bin
Laden
's
family
at
one
stage
of
its
history
.
I
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
we
be
deal
with
people
of
that
kind
.
we
should
be
very
careful
about
who
we
flirt
with
when
we
be
look
for
people
to
invest
in
the
Irish
economy
and
the
Irish
banking
infrastructure
.
the
Labour
Party
be
in
favour
of
sustainable
and
responsible
investment
.
that
have
not
be
a
mainstream
feature
of
this
country
's
banking
culture
.
have
a
sustainable
and
responsible
approach
to
investment
be
not
part
of
Irish
banking
culture
.
there
be
no
proper
risk
assessment
of
lending
and
there
be
no
proper
model
of
corporate
social
responsibility
.
as
deputy
Penrose
have
say
,
we
need
to
change
the
culture
of
banking
in
this
country
so
that
we
begin
to
lend
in
the
real
economy
.
Irish
business
should
not
continue
to
be
stifle
,
as
they
have
be
stifle
to
date
.
the
new
type
of
lending
we
advocate
will
,
inter
alia
,
champion
social
capital
.
the
former
Taoiseach
,
deputy
Bertie
Ahern
,
use
to
speak
about
Mr.
Putnam
's
book
,
Bowling
Alone
,
in
the
context
of
the
need
for
volunteerism
and
investment
in
social
capital
.
why
should
we
not
use
the
banking
guarantee
scheme
that
the
government
be
sponsor
as
a
means
of
ensure
that
we
enforce
change
in
this
country
's
banking
culture
and
thereby
enhance
investment
in
social
capital
?
why
should
preferential
lending
rate
,
below
the
ECB
rate
,
not
be
offer
to
community
organisation
,
sport
club
and
school
for
any
measure
that
involve
effort
that
enhance
we
community
?
the
banking
crisis
have
give
we
a
opportunity
to
set
up
a
ecological
loan
book
,
whereby
preferential
lending
rate
can
be
make
available
to
commercial
and
domestic
project
that
seek
to
reduce
we
dependence
on
carbon
.
such
loan
would
be
offer
in
respect
of
everything
from
residential
solar
panel
to
biodiesel
plant
.
such
a
system
would
help
we
to
offset
some
of
the
obligation
we
have
under
the
Kyoto
Protocol
.
we
need
to
be
imaginative
in
we
approach
to
lending
and
get
out
of
this
crisis
.
nothing
I
have
see
from
the
government
bench
give
I
confidence
,
as
a
member
of
this
House
and
as
a
citizen
,
that
this
country
be
in
safe
hand
and
that
we
banking
infrastructure
be
secure
for
the
future
.

when
will
the
animal
welfare
Bill
be
publish
?
have
the
consultation
period
end
yet
?
I
support
the
request
make
last
week
for
a
debate
in
the
House
on
the
implication
of
the
CAP
health
check
,
which
will
have
far
-
reach
effect
on
Irish
agriculture
and
the
way
we
do
business
within
the
rural
economy
.
with
regard
to
the
mental
capacity
Bill
,
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
have
be
in
existence
since
2006
.
when
will
the
Bill
be
publish
?
the
Taoiseach
have
previously
say
it
will
be
introduce
in
mid-2009
.
I
ask
that
it
be
publish
forthwith
.
that
be
a
imply
acknowledgement
of
the
cowboy
.
the
minister
for
Finance
make
a
call
to
patriotic
action
.
it
be
more
of
a
cull
in
term
of
patriotic
action
because
despite
the
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
the
current
difficulty
we
face
and
the
external
factor
that
have
affect
this
economy
,
there
be
no
imagination
in
term
of
the
framing
of
this
budget
.
there
be
little
by
way
of
provide
a
economic
stimulus
that
would
create
job
and
build
a
foundation
on
which
we
could
climb
out
of
this
morass
if
not
in
the
short
term
at
least
in
the
medium
term
.
instead
of
put
in
place
some
inventive
measure
,
the
government
decide
to
slash
and
burn
across
the
divide
.
to
take
one
sector
,
agriculture
be
a
primary
producer
.
food
and
drink
export
amount
to
€
8.2
billion
to
€
8.6
billion
every
year
but
at
a
time
when
production
be
go
on
in
that
sector
and
in
the
face
of
a
global
food
scarcity
,
the
government
decide
to
take
money
out
of
that
productive
part
of
the
economy
by
way
of
cut
in
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
not
extend
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
.
it
have
be
prove
that
every
euro
spend
within
the
rural
economy
have
a
multiply
effect
and
it
stay
within
the
rural
economy
.
in
cut
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
other
such
scheme
,
the
government
be
automatically
reduce
that
multiplier
effect
and
the
potential
within
what
be
a
productive
sector
.
that
do
not
make
economic
sense
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
when
reply
,
to
address
that
particular
aspect
because
we
need
to
be
imaginative
about
the
direction
in
which
this
country
be
go
in
this
tough
economic
climate
.
the
issue
of
vat
be
one
on
which
I
would
like
the
minister
to
respond
.
if
we
be
in
a
inflationary
period
and
if
there
be
less
money
in
the
economy
,
and
public
and
consumer
sentiment
be
non-existent
,
why
would
the
minister
increase
vat
at
a
time
when
people
be
not
spend
money
?
the
return
to
the
Exchequer
will
be
significantly
reduce
anyway
.
if
the
minister
could
stimulate
such
demand
by
reduce
vat
he
would
,
by
extension
,
increase
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
that
seem
to
be
the
most
logical
approach
.
he
should
not
increase
vat
but
maintain
it
at
the
current
rate
or
reduce
it
marginally
but
he
certainly
should
not
increase
it
in
the
current
climate
.
I
do
not
understand
the
reason
the
minister
have
do
that
,
and
perhaps
we
could
get
a
answer
as
to
he
logic
in
that
regard
.
on
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act
1997
relate
to
research
and
development
activity
,
we
all
agree
that
foreign
direct
investment
have
be
very
good
for
this
country
.
that
be
something
that
have
be
a
bedrock
of
policy
for
a
number
of
year
but
we
need
to
consider
whether
we
should
continue
to
rely
on
foreign
direct
investment
.
I
welcome
the
tax
credit
for
research
and
development
but
I
again
question
the
reason
for
the
base
year
of
2003
.
if
a
company
be
involved
in
research
and
development
there
be
a
good
possibility
that
its
research
could
predate
that
date
.
I
would
have
favour
2000
as
a
base
year
to
try
to
exercise
a
credit
of
that
nature
but
perhaps
there
be
a
logic
to
the
minister
's
position
on
that
.
he
might
respond
to
that
when
reply
.
on
the
issue
of
banking
,
we
need
some
consistency
.
bank
,
by
they
very
nature
,
have
be
profligate
in
the
way
they
have
loan
in
that
much
of
it
be
developer
lead
.
there
be
a
opportunity
now
through
this
state
guarantee
to
enforce
a
new
culture
on
banking
.
I
argue
last
night
in
we
private
Member
's
motion
that
a
ecological
loan
book
could
be
set
up
.
at
a
time
when
not
everybody
will
be
eligible
for
the
national
insulation
scheme
we
could
set
up
a
system
of
preferential
rate
that
would
allow
people
to
borrow
for
improvement
to
they
home
that
would
offset
carbon
.
as
I
understand
that
scheme
,
the
State
have
the
control
to
enforce
that
type
of
lending
and
I
do
not
understand
why
it
do
not
do
that
.
that
would
have
a
knock
-
on
multiplier
effect
in
term
of
job
creation
.
if
preferential
loan
could
be
give
to
people
who
be
not
eligible
for
grant
aid
for
home
improvement
,
it
would
have
a
positive
knock
-
on
effect
for
the
local
economy
.
we
need
a
little
more
imagination
.
while
we
all
acknowledge
the
position
we
be
in
,
four
minister
be
involved
in
the
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
brief
and
surely
many
action
can
be
take
to
stimulate
the
economy
.
this
party
have
give
many
idea
about
what
we
would
do
if
we
be
on
that
side
of
the
House
and
there
be
scope
for
that
to
be
take
on
board
.
there
have
be
much
battering
of
the
public
sector
of
late
.
I
know
umpteen
local
authority
outdoor
staff
on
Cork
County
Council
's
northern
division
who
have
be
let
go
.
they
be
either
on
temporary
contract
or
have
tender
for
job
.
one
of
they
have
work
for
the
council
as
a
JCB
operator
for
more
than
30
year
of
he
life
,
be
out
on
call
at
2
a.m.
,
5
a.m.
or
whenever
the
council
want
he
and
give
a
good
service
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
argument
in
this
House
about
cull
the
public
service
we
must
be
careful
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
worker
of
that
nature
on
the
front
line
,
who
serve
they
local
authority
well
and
have
great
loyalty
to
they
and
to
the
people
they
serve
,
be
be
let
go
.
there
be
people
work
in
FÁS
office
throughout
this
country
with
whom
I
deal
on
a
daily
basis
through
community
employment
scheme
.
I
support
that
people
who
deliver
for
they
community
.
I
distinguish
between
the
work
they
do
and
some
of
the
profligacy
that
may
have
take
place
at
the
top
.
like
the
people
of
Dromakeenan
,
the
people
of
Buttevant
be
proud
of
where
they
come
from
.
they
have
a
equally
dire
need
for
a
new
school
.
they
have
be
campaign
for
such
a
school
for
over
11
year
.
when
I
be
a
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
we
co-ordinate
with
the
local
vec
on
the
rezoning
of
a
specific
parcel
of
land
to
allow
the
new
school
to
be
develop
.
that
site
be
purchase
over
12
month
ago
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
schedule
of
accommodation
be
submit
in
September
of
this
year
.
nothing
have
come
back
from
the
Department
yet
.
the
school
authority
be
seek
the
appointment
of
a
design
team
.
such
a
appointment
should
not
incur
a
undue
cost
.
on
behalf
of
the
community
,
I
want
the
next
stage
of
the
process
to
be
reach
.
like
they
counterpart
in
hundred
of
school
throughout
the
State
,
the
pupil
and
teacher
of
the
vocational
school
in
Buttevant
be
have
to
work
in
dire
circumstance
.
the
building
in
question
date
back
to
pre-Famine
time
.
its
structure
be
not
in
line
with
what
one
would
expect
to
see
in
a
modern
school
.
notwithstanding
the
financial
circumstance
the
State
find
itself
in
,
if
it
be
to
be
progressive
it
need
to
move
this
project
onto
the
next
stage
.
that
would
not
involve
a
major
outlay
.
all
I
be
call
for
at
this
stage
be
the
progression
of
the
project
—
it
should
not
be
stall
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
because
I
have
sum
up
my
point
.
I
have
tab
parliamentary
question
on
this
matter
in
the
past
and
have
raise
it
on
the
adjournment
previously
.
I
will
continue
to
raise
this
issue
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
give
I
a
pro
forma
reply
.
I
appeal
to
the
official
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Science
who
will
be
responsible
for
read
the
transcript
of
this
debate
to
take
up
this
case
and
try
to
move
it
on
to
the
next
stage
.

I
will
share
time
with
Deputy
Penrose
and
Ferris
.
I
wish
to
begin
by
reply
to
deputy
Collins
.
not
every
farmer
in
the
country
want
to
build
house
or
become
a
developer
on
he
or
she
land
-
hold
.
that
people
be
in
the
minority
.
I
remind
the
deputy
that
the
arrangement
he
speak
about
be
only
guideline
and
that
the
county
development
plan
of
each
county
take
precedence
over
that
guideline
.
in
response
to
deputy
Brady
,
the
government
in
question
be
not
a
Democratic
Left
-
lead
government
.
there
be
three
party
in
that
particular
arrangement
.
I
represent
a
party
that
traditionally
would
not
be
align
to
the
farming
community
.
however
,
in
term
of
my
wholehearted
support
for
this
motion
,
I
can
give
a
analysis
that
be
unfettered
and
devoid
of
political
expediency
.
I
do
not
intend
to
be
politically
expedient
tonight
,
but
to
speak
of
the
fact
.
we
reside
in
a
European
Union
where
UK
young
farmer
represent
5.6
%
of
the
total
farming
workforce
and
Irish
young
farmer
represent
10.5
%
.
this
percentage
be
from
a
report
from
the
European
Parliament
issue
in
May
2008
and
represent
farmer
under
the
age
of
35
.
if
we
be
to
be
innovative
in
the
manner
we
create
job
during
the
current
downturn
,
we
need
to
create
incentive
.
the
only
way
to
create
incentive
be
to
ensure
that
coterie
of
the
population
—
the
under
35
—
who
be
interested
in
become
involved
in
agriculture
get
the
financial
incentive
to
do
so
.
there
be
a
economic
rationale
for
ensure
the
early
retirement
scheme
and
installation
aid
scheme
for
young
farmer
be
maintain
.
by
allow
this
new
farmer
to
enter
the
sector
,
which
be
a
productive
sector
and
generate
revenue
of
€
8.6
billion
per
annum
in
food
and
drink
export
about
which
the
minister
speak
,
we
encourage
innovation
.
however
,
by
cull
the
scheme
,
we
create
a
disincentive
.
at
a
time
when
,
for
example
,
FÁS
have
a
budget
of
€
1.05
billion
,
we
have
spend
€
48.4
billion
on
the
indigenous
sector
through
Enterprise
Ireland
and
we
be
spend
€
90
million
on
capital
expenditure
for
IDA
Ireland
,
all
of
which
be
for
job
creation
,
there
be
a
ratio
of
that
kind
of
investment
for
every
job
create
.
therefore
,
every
job
create
cost
the
economy
a
certain
amount
,
a
specific
figure
which
I
have
not
be
able
to
ascertain
.
therefore
,
by
create
,
allow
or
facilitate
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
by
invest
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
young
farmer
new
to
the
sector
,
the
government
be
progress
the
sector
and
create
a
job
,
or
in
economic
term
a
multiplier
effect
,
that
ensure
the
rural
economy
will
continue
to
be
maintain
.
this
be
a
rational
,
objective
and
cold
view
that
be
devoid
of
any
political
expediency
.
this
scheme
be
essential
if
we
be
to
maintain
we
comparative
advantage
within
the
rural
economy
.
if
the
government
continue
to
remove
fund
from
the
rural
economy
,
the
rural
depopulation
we
have
witness
,
the
lack
of
proper
infrastructure
and
the
lack
of
expenditure
within
that
economy
will
have
a
further
detrimental
effect
.
any
person
who
avail
of
a
scheme
such
as
the
young
farmer
installation
aid
do
not
spend
the
money
in
Santa
Ponsa
,
but
invest
it
in
he
or
she
own
farmholding
,
generally
in
a
way
that
be
innovative
and
will
increase
the
yield
or
return
to
that
farm
.
to
return
to
the
demographic
,
the
bulk
of
farmer
be
within
a
certain
age
group
and
there
be
a
certain
wisdom
that
come
with
that
intergenerational
solidarity
that
occur
within
the
sector
.
however
,
with
every
new
influx
of
blood
,
there
come
new
idea
.
we
talk
about
issue
such
as
carbon
off
-
setting
and
the
possibility
of
micro-energy
production
,
but
if
we
talk
about
innovative
idea
,
we
need
to
ensure
the
incentive
be
there
to
allow
young
people
come
into
the
sector
.
what
the
minister
have
do
by
cull
the
scheme
be
to
disincentivise
they
and
that
be
not
the
way
to
go
.
I
represent
a
rural
-
urban
mix
of
a
constituency
.
my
constituency
traditionally
have
large
agribusiness
interest
,
but
this
have
decline
over
a
period
of
time
.
there
be
now
a
real
opportunity
for
people
of
my
generation
to
come
into
the
sector
.
this
people
will
have
a
farming
mix
that
will
involve
energy
creation
and
a
different
type
of
product
mix
that
will
yield
benefit
to
the
country
in
the
long
run
.
therefore
,
I
urge
the
minister
to
rethink
the
change
.
I
conclude
by
quote
from
Macra
to
Feirme
,
which
have
a
rational
position
on
this
issue
:
Macra
be
demand
the
complete
reopening
of
the
young
farmer
installation
aid
scheme
.
this
scheme
be
agree
under
the
social
Partnership

2007
-

and
be
co-fund
by
the
EU
.
if
it
be
a
co-fund
procedure
devise
under
social
partnership
pillar
,
we
must
honour
the
agreement
,
just
as
we
honour
all
the
other
pillar
of
the
social
partnership
arrangement
in
the
country
.

by
way
of
preamble
I
draw
attention
to
how
the
minister
's
language
have
shif
considerably
from
the
statement
in
Limoges
where
he
say
that
the
sector
"
should
be
a
priority
for
any
unused
fund
within
the
CAP
budget
"
.
last
night
he
indicate
:
"
I
want
to
ensure
that
the
change
in
the
health
check
initiative
will
open
the
possibility
for
some
useful
action
.
"
now
the
minister
be
state
that
he
"
may
"
use
some
of
the
€
24
million
fund
to
support
the
sheep
sector
.
what
the
farmer
who
be
protest
on
Kildare
Street
want
to
know
be
whether
the
fund
will
be
use
.
will
the
minister
give
a
definitive
commitment
that
he
will
honour
the
statement
that
be
make
at
the
conference
in
Limoges
?
give
that
the
minister
have
commit
to
meet
representative
of
the
sector
,
will
he
move
the
date
of
16
December
forward
give
that
the
farmer
be
protest
outside
Leinster
House
?
it
would
be
courteous
if
the
minister
commit
to
meet
they
early
than
16
December
.
be
the
minister
now
tell
we
he
cannot
commit
the
unspent
cap
fund
to
the
sheep
sector
?
will
he
respond
with
a
"
yes
"
or
a
"
no
"
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
there
be
people
outside
this
building
who
be
await
the
answer
to
that
question
.
they
be
either
labour
under
a
misapprehension
regard
the
minister
's
statement
or
they
be
not
.
do
the
minister
make
a
commitment
that
he
would
allocate
unused
cap
fund
to
the
sheep
sector
?
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
he
be
shift
he
position
.
there
be
a
subtle
shift
.
be
the
answer
to
my
question
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
?
the
minister
should
just
answer
the
question
.
will
the
minister
clarify
whether
the
original
ratio
in
the
rural
development
package
be
to
be
50:50
between
EU
funding
and
Exchequer
funding
?
in
the
event
of
Exchequer
funding
be
at
25
%
,
will
the
government
commit
to
that
funding
in
light
of
the
new
modulation
or
the
common
agricultural
Policy
health
check
package
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
statement
in
term
of
the
commitment
on
modulation
and
how
it
be
to
be
ringfence
within
agriculture
.
that
be
vitally
important
and
be
something
I
have
raise
with
the
minister
previously
.
there
should
be
no
leakage
of
that
commitment
into
other
sector
,
or
into
non-governmental
,
community
and
voluntary
pillar
.
that
be
essential
.
do
the
minister
not
agree
that
the
€
170
million
package
deliver
by
the
CAP
will
be
deliver
by
farmer
themselves
?
the
1
%
increase
in
quota
will
effectively
come
down
to
the
farmer
who
get
up
every
day
to
milk
more
cow
.
the
minister
be
oversel
the
package
somewhat
.
it
be
widely
think
that
the
1
%
increase
in
quota
be
come
down
the
track
in
any
event
.
will
the
minister
explain
the
€
70
million
that
be
in
the
balance
?
some
€100
million
will
be
provide
for
additional
milk
production
and
there
be
a
extra
€
70
million
.
will
the
minister
clarify
how
this
extra
sum
will
be
designate
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
do
the
minister
state
the
EU
have
not
seek
any
regulation
in
this
regard
to
harmonise
the
situation
?
if
I
have
two
second
extra
,
I
would
have
come
in
on
cue
but
I
be
be
give
a
briefing
by
the
deputy
from
south
-
west
Cork
.
I
note
deputy
Creed
be
quick
off
the
mark
.
anyway
,
as
somebody
who
pose
the
question
,
even
though
it
be
in
the
name
of
deputy
Liz
McManus
,
I
wish
to
put
on
record
that
I
do
not
see
why
this
be
so
,
there
be
not
any
legal
impediment
and
there
be
no
European
Union
directive
that
state
that
the
minister
cannot
extend
the
deadline
to
allow
for
this
scheme
to
be
implement
.
the
scheme
be
revenue
neutral
.
I
do
not
see
why
,
if
it
can
be
do
on
one
part
of
this
island
,
it
can
not
be
do
on
another
part
of
this
island
.
it
defy
logic
.
farmer
in
the
North
be
farming
the
same
type
of
land
as
farmer
in
the
South
.
I
can
not
see
the
logic
of
the
government
's
position
on
this
matter
.
I
do
not
see
why
the
minister
cannot
change
he
mind
on
it
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
consider
change
he
mind
on
it
.
hear
,
hear
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
there
be
deep
concern
in
Fermoy
about
proposal
make
by
the
OPW
to
replace
the
weir
in
the
town
with
a
rock
ramp
pass
.
person
fear
for
they
rowing
club
which
some
argue
have
be
in
existence
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
they
fear
that
if
the
weir
be
replace
by
a
rock
ramp
,
it
will
have
untold
consequence
for
the
water
level
in
the
River
Blackwater
,
thus
negate
the
amenity
value
of
the
rowing
club
.
why
be
the
government
proceed
with
this
folly
?
there
be
no
justification
for
the
project
.
the
OPW
's
flood
alleviation
work
be
sanction
and
welcome
but
it
be
now
seek
to
change
the
weir
,
to
which
there
seem
to
be
no
logic
.
when
I
put
a
question
to
the
minister
on
the
issue
on
4
November
,
I
be
tell
the
direction
have
be
issue
in
the
interest
of
conserve
wild
salmon
resource
and
avoid
the
initiation
of
infringement
proceedings
by
the
European
Commission
under
the
habitat
directive
on
foot
of
a
complaint
lodge
with
the
environment
Directorate
-
General
of
the
Commission
.
give
that
the
government
be
seek
to
adhere
to
the
habitat
directive
,
the
people
of
Fermoy
and
I
would
like
to
know
the
nature
of
the
complaint
and
who
lodge
it
.
we
want
to
know
the
justification
for
it
.
if
it
be
to
ensure
enough
salmon
can
get
up
the
river
,
plenty
of
salmon
be
be
catch
by
rod
on
the
river
.
it
do
not
require
the
destruction
of
the
weir
to
ensure
more
salmon
can
get
up
the
river
because
there
be
a
much
cheap
solution
that
would
ensure
the
continuation
of
a
fish
pass
without
compromise
the
valuable
amenity
constitute
by
the
rowing
club
in
Fermoy
.
we
want
to
ensure
the
future
viability
of
the
rowing
club
.
we
do
not
see
the
economic
justification
for
the
proposal
in
the
current
climate
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
tell
I
that
the
project
be
be
carry
out
by
the
OPW
because
Fermoy
Town
Council
cannot
afford
to
do
so
,
she
should
note
that
the
former
minister
of
State
,
deputy
John
Browne
,
visit
the
town
in
2006
.
two
year
have
pass
since
he
visit
and
the
project
be
to
be
hitch
to
a
OPW
flood
alleviation
plan
,
to
which
there
be
no
logic
to
whatsoever
.
the
people
of
Fermoy
cannot
comprehend
it
.
the
EU
habitat
directive
be
be
use
as
a
batter
ram
to
carry
out
the
project
.
there
be
no
justification
for
this
.
if
there
be
a
complaint
lodge
to
the
environment
Directorate
-
General
of
the
Commission
,
will
the
minister
of
State
make
a
copy
of
it
available
to
the
House
in
order
that
member
will
know
exactly
who
be
behind
the
work
?
I
do
not
believe
for
one
moment
that
the
opw
be
fully
responsible
and
believe
there
be
other
mechanism
at
play
.
I
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
Southern
Regional
Fishery
Board
be
the
main
instigator
and
that
it
be
seek
to
justify
its
position
.
it
will
gladly
sacrifice
a
rowing
club
to
this
end
but
should
realise
that
,
ultimately
,
as
many
salmon
will
get
up
the
river
without
a
rock
ramp
as
they
would
if
one
be
install
.
hide
behind
the
fallacy
of
a
habitat
directive
be
typical
of
a
government
which
have
use
the
European
Union
when
it
want
to
push
through
some
bad
proposal
.
this
project
will
have
a
adverse
effect
on
the
community
in
Fermoy
.
I
ask
the
government
to
rethink
its
strategy
,
particularly
in
the
current
economic
climate
.

on
the
basis
that
the
debate
will
take
place
forthwith
,
I
wish
to
withdraw
my
submission
,
with
the
permission
of
the
chair
.
I
will
share
time
with
deputy
Willie
Penrose
.
I
express
solidarity
with
all
pig
producer
in
the
organic
and
non-organic
sector
,
craft
butcher
,
processor
and
every
worker
who
have
be
adversely
affect
by
this
crisis
.
Public
health
and
consumer
confidence
must
be
restore
immediately
.
this
will
be
the
indicator
of
the
future
viability
of
the
pigmeat
industry
.
Producer
have
be
unfairly
plunge
into
a
crisis
which
be
not
of
they
making
.
farm
which
purchase
contaminate
feed
do
so
in
good
faith
and
on
the
basis
that
the
product
be
license
.
the
pork
industry
be
the
fourth
large
in
the
agriculture
sector
and
be
worth
approximately
€400
million
per
annum
.
I
understand
export
of
pigmeat
be
worth
€
212
million
in
2007
.
in
that
context
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
only
ten
of
a
possible
400
producer
have
be
affect
by
contaminate
feed
.
I
understand
the
producer
in
question
produce
less
than
10
%
of
the
overall
kill
.
the
minimal
number
of
producer
affect
should
help
restore
public
confidence
because
if
the
figure
I
cite
be
correct
,
90
%
of
the
pig
kill
be
beyond
reproach
and
scientific
evidence
will
show
that
the
risk
to
human
health
diminish
significantly
.
we
cannot
underestimate
the
importance
of
the
meat
industry
.
have
listen
carefully
to
the
Taoiseach
and
Minister
,
I
note
that
neither
of
they
refer
to
a
timeline
for
the
return
of
pork
to
the
shelf
.
I
understand
from
the
Taoiseach
that
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
must
make
this
call
from
a
scientific
perspective
.
I
call
on
the
authority
and
European
Commission
to
make
allowance
for
the
importance
of
the
meat
industry
to
this
State
.
this
institution
must
act
as
soon
as
possible
to
ensure
product
be
place
on
the
shelf
again
and
public
confidence
restore
.
if
the
European
Union
will
not
provide
a
compensation
package
,
at
least
Commissioner
Kuneva
and
the
EFSA
should
issue
a
statement
within
24
to
48
hour
indicate
that
production
can
commence
again
.
the
true
test
of
patriotism
,
if
I
may
use
that
word
,
be
to
stand
in
solidarity
on
this
issue
.
we
should
not
use
it
to
score
political
point
off
the
minister
.
we
all
know
family
farmer
or
worker
in
processing
plant
whose
livelihood
depend
on
a
viable
pig
and
beef
industry
.
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
fundamental
question
must
be
ask
of
the
Department
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
act
with
great
urgency
and
to
implore
the
European
Commission
to
make
a
statement
forthwith
to
enable
the
industry
to
start
work
again
.
while
the
government
be
correct
to
introduce
a
total
recall
of
pork
product
,
if
the
problem
affect
less
than
10
%
of
producer
and
90
%
of
pork
product
be
thereby
deem
to
be
safe
and
fit
for
human
consumption
,
the
minister
should
have
make
a
statement
in
the
24
to
48
hour
period
follow
the
total
recall
indicate
that
production
could
recommence
.
he
should
clarify
the
reason
this
have
not
be
do
.
if
the
traceability
system
be
work
adequately
and
the
one
-
step
-
up
,
one
-
step
-
back
principle
be
be
adhere
to
,
it
would
have
be
possible
to
isolate
the
relevant
producer
and
stop
they
production
.
this
would
have
allow
other
producer
who
never
use
this
material
to
continue
to
provide
product
for
the
market
.
this
issue
must
also
be
address
.
the
national
feed
inspection
programme
be
a
rigorous
regime
apply
to
all
primary
producer
,
whether
pig
or
beef
farmer
.
everything
which
reach
the
farm
gate
be
subject
to
the
most
stringent
inspection
control
in
the
world
.
why
do
the
inspection
process
for
feedstuff
fail
in
respect
of
the
producer
in
question
?
the
system
failure
which
occur
have
significantly
diminish
the
potential
of
the
pig
and
pigmeat
industry
.
the
sector
will
take
a
long
time
to
claw
its
way
back
to
its
previous
position
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
we
need
to
show
solidarity
with
all
the
player
in
the
industry
.
this
be
a
national
issue
on
which
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
minister
in
every
step
of
the
process
.
nevertheless
,
the
problem
must
be
handle
with
a
great
sense
of
urgency
.
I
have
three
question
.
will
there
be
a
new
regulatory
framework
deal
with
non
-food
grade
oil
,
as
I
understand
it
?
my
second
question
relate
to
the
routine
sample
of
pork
fat
.
the
minister
state
on
28
November
that
a
routine
sample
of
pork
fat
take
as
part
of
he
Department
's
national
residue
monitoring
programme
be
show
to
be
positive
for
the
presence
of
non-dioxin
-
like
marker
pcb
.
be
there
routine
testing
for
pcb
on
a
ongoing
basis
throughout
the
food
industry
?
on
Friday
,
28
November
we
be
tell
that
this
indicative
testing
take
place
.
on
4
December
the
Department
issue
a
press
release
confirm
a
investigation
into
the
source
of
a
contaminant
in
animal
feed
and
the
restriction
of
a
number
of
farm
.
the
dutch
authority
contact
the
Department
and
the
FSAI
regard
they
independent
investigation
.
when
they
communicate
that
,
how
long
have
the
dutch
authority
's
investigation
be
in
train
?
when
be
the
rapid
alert
system
kick
into
action
?
this
be
also
a
important
point
.
the
minister
have
tell
we
this
all
happen
on
this
island
,
effectively
.
however
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
the
rapid
alert
kick
in
long
before
this
process
and
we
need
some
clarification
on
that
point
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
if
that
trade
notice
go
out
and
the
product
be
verifiable
,
why
be
stock
not
back
on
the
shelf
in
pork
butcher
throughout
the
country
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
we
have
only
have
one
question
from
this
side
of
the
House
so
far
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Willie
Penrose
and
I
propose
to
take
seven
minute
.
something
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
to
the
Agriculture
and
Fishery
Council
,
give
that
we
do
not
have
many
opportunity
to
discuss
fishery
be
the
additional
funding
emergency
measure
be
agree
in
July
.
it
be
still
urgent
that
progress
be
make
to
make
fund
available
at
the
early
possible
date
.
I
understand
that
the
Federation
of
Irish
Fishermen
,
FIF
,
have
make
submission
and
there
be
a
ongoing
campaign
.
we
all
know
that
fuel
price
have
decrease
dramatically
but
the
cost
input
for
fisherman
during
that
period
be
significant
as
be
loss
incur
during
that
period
.
we
should
support
that
measure
.
will
that
€
37
million
expenditure
be
expedite
?
perhaps
the
official
could
revert
to
we
in
due
course
on
this
matter
.
with
the
pend
December
Council
of
Minister
meeting
due
on
18
and
19
December
,
it
be
important
that
this
house
give
time
to
debate
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
have
have
some
significant
briefing
today
from
the
FIF
,
more
specifically
from
the
Irish
South
and
West
Fish
Producer
's
Organisation
,
on
the
issue
.
it
be
worth
reiterate
some
of
the
point
they
make
.
they
state
that
the
decision
take
at
the
December
Council
meeting
will
be
vital
to
the
future
of
the
industry
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
say
he
support
the
appropriate
conservation
measure
for
Celtic
Sea
cod
such
as
spawn
area
closure
which
be
originally
propose
by
fisherman
and
be
deliver
positive
effect
on
stock
level
in
that
area
.
the
organisation
's
position
be
such
that
it
propose
that
the
creation
of
a
sub
-
divide
management
area
separate
the
English
Channel
from
the
rest
of
the
exist
Celtic
Sea
,
have
certain
implication
for
Ireland
.
the
organisation
's
briefing
paper
state
:
the
separation
of
Area
VIId
,
the
English
Channel
,
from
the
remainder
of
Area
VIIb
-k
for
the
purpose
of
management
,
and
the
establishment
of
a
separate
total
allowable
catch
for
that
area
have
significant
implication
for
the
Irish
fishing
industry
.
while
the
measure
be
not
objectionable
in
itself
,
the
subdivision
of
the
stock
must
not
disadvantage
Irish
fisherman
by
directly
divide
the
quota
,
give
Ireland
quota
in
a
area
(
VIId
)
where
Irish
fisherman
do
not
fish
.
Irish
fisherman
catch
most
of
the
Cod
in
the
west
of
the
exist
management
area
,
to
the
south
of
Ireland
.
this
must
be
reflect
in
the
new
subdivision
of
quota
between
the
management
area
.
I
could
not
have
put
the
argument
any
good
.
with
regard
to
the
proposal
on
the
fishing
effort
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
that
the
European
Commission
be
effectively
re-write
,
after
the
fact
,
the
decision
reach
by
the
Council
.
the
FIF
state
that
the
commission
be
re-write
the
text
of
the
decision
on
fishing
effort
in
the
Irish
Sea
and
the
north
west
which
be
reach
at
last
month
's
EU
Agriculture
and
Fishery
Council
.
this
can
not
be
allow
as
it
would
mean
a
immediate
25
%
cut
in
fishing
possibility
in
2009
,
from
what
be
in
the
decision
which
be
in
itself
misguided
,
draconian
and
punitive
.
the
November
Council
of
Fishery
minister
reach
a
decision
on
a
new
and
intensify
series
of
measure
for
fishery
in
the
Irish
Sea
and
the
north
west
.
I
also
understand
that
the
Irish
government
and
industry
succeed
in
thwart
the
effort
to
have
this
approach
extend
to
the
south
and
west
coast
.
the
FIF
have
state
this
to
I
today
.
the
measure
agree
which
affect
the
Irish
Sea
and
north
west
,
clearly
curtail
fishing
effort
in
the
form
of
kilowatt
-
day
to
the
amount
of
effort
in
previous
base
year
.
it
have
only
come
to
light
in
recent
day
that
the
commission
be
go
significantly
beyond
what
be
agree
and
it
now
propose
in
2009
to
impose
a
further
25
%
cut
from
the
base
effort
.
this
be
contrary
to
all
understanding
of
what
be
agree
.
I
understand
the
minister
may
share
this
position
but
he
need
to
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
House
at
some
stage
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
on
the
Hague
Preference
,
that
they
be
a
integral
part
of
the
tac
,
total
allowable
catch
and
quota
allocation
system
and
they
must
continue
to
be
allocate
or
formally
incorporate
into
the
tac
and
quota
system
and
not
perhaps
subject
to
the
annual
approval
which
they
must
undergo
.
I
understand
the
point
make
by
the
Minister
of
State
when
he
state
that
certain
member
state
would
seek
to
denigrate
or
downgrade
that
agreement
.
the
position
adopt
by
the
FIF
in
continue
to
ensure
that
the
Hague
issue
be
maintain
,
be
paramount
to
the
industry
in
the
future
.
more
recently
there
have
be
positive
interplay
between
the
fisherman
's
organisation
and
the
minister
.
the
emergency
package
agree
in
July
,
however
,
need
to
be
expedite
.
it
be
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
the
industry
.
the
position
be
that
application
have
be
receive
from
three
high
education
institution
for
designation
as
university
.
this
application
raise

the
amendment
in
the
Bill
that
replace
section
45
(
5
)
(
a
)
of
the
Health
Act
1970
,
couple
with
the
fair
deal
legislation
on
nursing
home
,
by
they
very
nature
,
seek
to
destroy
any
semblance
of
public
provision
and
universality
in
the
health
care
system
,
as
it
relate
to
old
people
.
the
research
indicate
that
20000
people
who
have
have
access
to
a
medical
card
will
no
long
have
such
a
entitlement
.
this
send
the
wrong
message
about
how
the
country
deal
with
public
health
to
that
who
be
in
they
autumn
year
.
notwithstanding
the
pre-exist
deal
do
with
general
pracititioner
,
whereby
the
payment
per
patient
would
be
significantly
more
than
it
be
today
,
the
health
outcome
for
patient
in
that
category
be
significantly
good
as
a
result
of
have
a
universal
right
to
a
medical
card
.
for
man
,
in
particular
,
have
the
medical
card
mean
a
much
great
likelihood
that
they
would
go
to
they
gp
to
monitor
they
health
.
I
know
of
people
in
my
constituency
who
be
more
inclined
to
go
because
they
have
the
medical
card
.
from
talk
to
gps
,
I
also
know
that
they
achieve
far
good
outcome
for
they
patient
owe
to
the
entitlement
to
a
medical
card
.
when
we
talk
about
public
health
and
primary
care
provision
which
be
woefully
inadequate
in
the
part
of
the
country
that
I
represent
,
I
do
not
understand
why
the
minister
would
row
back
on
a
decision
make
to
provide
a
medical
card
when
the
net
benefit
to
the
Exchequer
be
positive
in
term
of
improve
health
outcome
because
it
keep
people
out
of
secondary
and
tertiary
care
facility
.
Fianna
Fáil
backbencher
speak
about
hysteria
and
the
media
frenzy
whip
up
over
this
issue
.
the
people
who
march
on
Leinster
House
be
not
whip
up
into
a
frenzy
of
hysteria
.
at
the
time
they
take
the
rational
view
that
they
rights
be
be
undermine
.
they
be
rightfully
fearful
of
the
possibility
that
they
entitlement
would
be
take
from
they
in
one
fall
swoop
.
I
be
glad
they
decide
to
organise
and
exercise
they
right
to
protest
.
if
they
have
not
do
so
,
we
would
not
be
here
today
and
the
government
would
not
have
row
back
on
the
position
it
take
on
this
issue
on
budget
day
.
if
we
be
to
exercise
public
health
policy
correctly
,
it
be
clear
that
the
campaign
to
maintain
the
automatic
right
to
a
medical
card
will
need
to
have
a
positive
outcome
.
we
need
to
continue
in
that
vein
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
minister
will
be
able
to
garner
savings
in
this
instance
.
it
seem
that
she
intend
to
reallocate
resource
from
that
whose
automatic
entitlement
be
be
withdraw
to
other
who
might
be
able
to
avail
of

.
person
on
low
income
will
not
receive
a

in
the
current
climate
because
the
threshold
have
not

sufficiently
.

2007
.
as
I
announce
on
budget
day
we
will
provide
for
some
alleviation
for
the
position
of
that
school
where
there
be
a
significant
concentration
of
newcomer
pupil
as
a
proportion
of
the
overall
enrolment
.
this
will
be
do
on
a
case
by
case
basis
.
at
this
time
the
priority
for
my
department
within
the
resource
available
to
it
be
to
carry
out
the
allocation
process
for
2009
/
10
in
a
timely
manner
.
divert
resource
in
order
to
create
staffing
profile
for
individual
school
or
list
of
school
could
not
be
justify
and
would
actually
impede
this
process
.
moreover
,
OECD
research
in
this
field
(
PISA
2006
)
show
that
Ireland
be
the
OECD
country
with
the
high
distribution
of
newcomer
across
school
mean
that
school
with
high
concentration
of
newcomer
child
be
relatively
unusual
.
ESRI
datum
also
show
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
school
have
high
concentration
of
newcomer
child
.
I
realise
that
standard
be
not
simply
achieve
by
supply
teaching
resource
and
that
the
quality
of
the
support
that
the
child
receive
and
the
inclusive
atmosphere
cultivate
in
school
be
important
factor
influence
the
quality
of
learning
achieve
by
migrant
child
.
my
Department
recognise
that
we
must
monitor
and
review
the
educational
experience
that
be
provide
to
migrant
student
so
that
we
can
improve
the
quality
and
effectiveness
of
we
provision
.
the
Department
be
undertake
a
range
of
research
to
consider
the
question
of
integration
in
school
and
how
good
to
deploy
we
resource
to
ensure
that
all
the
child
in
we
school
can
benefit
from
learning
in
a
intercultural
Ireland
.
my
department
be
provide
support
and
training
for
teacher
of
English
as
a
additional
language
in
the
current
school
year
.
at

the

(

)
have
identify
member
of
they
team
to
provide

additional

.
the
training
have
be
design
and
will
be
roll
out
in
early
2009
.

I
would
like
time
to
be

when
will
the

I

in

substantial
additional

most

extra
teacher
to
meet
previously
unmet

and
from
the
programme
the

set
for
itself
when
it
come
into

.
a
lot
have
change
in
the
past

and
the
first
and
foremost
imperative
be
that

public
finances

it

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
whether
the
government
will
seek
publication
of
a
report
by
the
National
Board
for
safeguard
Children
in
the
Catholic
Church
in
Ireland
into
issue
relate
to
child
protection
procedure
in
the
diocese
of
Cloyne
,
if
the
government
will
confirm
if
this
report
be
commission
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Children
,
if
the
recommendation
of
that
report
have
be
implement
,
and
if
certain
person
have
be
remove
from
position
of
responsibility
in
relation
to
child
protection
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Penrose
.
I
appreciate
that
we
all
have
to
act
in
unison
last
week
and
take
the
minister
's
statement
in
good
faith
as
the
crisis
unfold
.
across
the
political
divide
we
act
in
the
public
interest
.
a
total
product
recall
be
the
only
way
to
go
to
restore
consumer
confidence
and
export
market
in
the
long
run
.
this
week
,
however
,
we
be
at
a
different
juncture
.
the
minister
be
now
ask
we
to
stand
over
a
payment
of
€
50
million
by
way
of
a
Supplementary
estimate
.
I
have
serious
reservation
about
it
because
the
minister
have
not
provide
sufficient
detail
on
how
that
sum
will
be
spend
down
to
the
last
euro
.
I
agree
that
the
compensation
package
must
be
negotiate
but
the
lack
of
detail
show
a
certain
disregard
for
opposition
Member
who
represent
all
side
,
include
consumer
,
farm
worker
and
processor
.
we
should
be
provide
with
far
more
detail
of
this
Supplementary
estimate
,
give
that
it
be
taxpayer
's
money
.
my
understanding
be
that
this
€
50
million
payout
will
cover
interim
payment
to
processor
,
although
that
be
not
state
in
the
minister
's
speech
.
perhaps
we
can
get
some
clarification
on
that
.
I
do
not
hear
anything
in
the
speech
to
indicate
that
worker
who
be
leave
out
of
pocket
through
last
week
's
closure
of
plant
will
be
compensate
.
if
plant
such
as
Rossderragh
be
not
in
a
position
to
compensate
worker
for
loss
of
pay
,
which
occur
through
no
fault
of
they
own
,
there
be
a
strong
case
for
the
government
to
compensate
they
.
that
be
not
a
unreasonable
request
in
this
instance
.
I
be
disappointed
,
however
,
that
there
be
no
detail
of
such
a
scheme
in
the
speech
.
I
do
not
write
a
speech
in
advance
of
this
debate
because
I
want
to
listen
to
the
minister
before
respond
.
I
want
my
remark
to
be
base
on
he
speech
.
over
the
past
72
hour
,
I
have
read
a
great
deal
about
Millstream
Recycling
company
in
Bunclody
.
the
minister
state
:
"
in
regard
to
the
specific
investigation
into
the
source
of
the
contamination
,
my
Department
be
be
assist
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
the
Garda
"
.
why
be
the
Garda
involve
?
be
it
the
Department
's
opinion
that
a
illegal
or
nefarious
process
be
involved
?
if
people
be
be
ask
to
stand
over
a
payout
to
the
industry
of
between
€
50
million
and
€
180
million
,
it
be
fair
that
they
ask
pertinent
question
as
to
why
the
Garda
have
become
involved
.
the
minister
also
state
:
"
the
investigation
focus
on
the
type
of
fuel
use
in
a
burner
which
dry
surplus
food
material
for
animal
feed
and
the
appropriateness
of
this
type
of
oil
"
.
he
go
on
to
state
:
"
in
view
of
the
apparent
link
to
the
type
of
fuel
use
in
the
drying
process
,
I
be
ask
the
European
Commission
to
consider
whether
the
type
of
oil
to
be
use
by
feed
business
operator
can
be
more
strictly
regulate
"
.
it
appear
that
the
use
of
this
type
of
fuel
be
not
govern
by
the
Department
's
rule
,
the
hazard
analysis
and
critical
control
point
,
haccp
,
legislation
or
EU
regulation
.
will
the
minister
clarify
this
issue
and
inform
the
House
as
to
why
the
Garda
be
involved
?
if
the
Garda
be
involved
,
a
nefarious
scheme
be
the
presumption
.
if
there
be
a
illegal
process
,
will
there
be
a
source
of
redress
?
be
the
Millstream
process
illegal
?
it
be
the
reason
for
this
debate
.
the
process
will
cost
the
State
up
to
€
180
million
.
ironically
,
anything
that
I
have
read
about
the
factory
in
question
suggest
that
the
process
be
a
forward
look
venture
well
ahead
of
the
posse
in
term
of
new
industry
initiative
.
this
do
not
sit
well
and
I
hope
that
we
be
not
hang
a
particular
individual
out
to
dry
.
the
issue
must
be
address
transparently
.
while
we
agree
that
compensatory
measure
must
be
put
in
place
,
we
need
to
know
who
negotiate
the
package
on
behalf
of
the
pig
industry
.
we
also
need
to
know
when
the
funding
will
be
divvy
up
and
,
in
light
of
the
public
interest
,
whether
the
detail
of
who
get
what
will
become
available
.
if
the
taxpayer
be
to
cover
the
cost
,
it
be
only
fair
that
they
know
what
be
at
stake
and
in
play
.
there
have
be
a
failure
of
regulation
,
but
I
do
not
attribute
it
to
the
government
necessarily
.
by
way
of
constructive
criticism
,
I
suggest
that
we
have
a
single
figurehead
—
a
supremo
,
if
the
House
will
—
to
be
in
charge
of
food
regulation
.
I
be
not
discuss
the
creation
of
a
new
agency
or
quango
.
however
,
the
statement
issue
by
the
Department
,
the
food
Safety
Authority
of
Ireland
,
FSAI
,
and
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
could
give
rise
to
a
certain
degree
of
confusion
as
to
where
competency
lie
in
food
safety
.
it
take
some
24
hour
to
realise
that
competence
lay
with
the
FSAI
.
rather
than
a
merger
of
competency
,
I
propose
there
be
one
voice
within
the
regulatory
framework
so
that
when
the
member
of
the
fourth
estate
and
the
Legislature
need
question
answer
,
we
will
know
to
whom
we
should
go
.
more
detail
be
necessary
.
I
will
stand
over
the
Department
's
decision
to
effect
a
withdrawal
.
we
stand
over
the
necessary
compensatory
package
,
but
there
should
be
more
detail
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
may
I
ask
—
—
will
the
minister
of
State
respond
to
we
question
?
a
lot
do
,
more
to
do
.
there
be
a
local
authority
housing
development
in
Mitchelstown
,
north
County
Cork
.
the
house
be
some
of
the
fine
I
have
ever
see
and
there
be
a
mixture
of
social
and
affordable
housing
.
however
,
many
of
the
affordable
house
be
empty
because
they
can
not
be
sell
.
the
empty
house
have
give
rise
to
anti-social
behaviour
,
as
a
consequence
of
which
they
have
be
vandalise
.
the
estate
be
wonderful
and
the
resident
be
very
proud
of
where
they
live
.
they
have
organised
resident
's
association
.
however
,
they
be
very
concerned
that
some
of
the
empty
affordable
house
will
not
be
sell
,
as
they
have
be
on
the
market
for
almost
two
year
.
I
have
a
list
as
long
as
one
's
arm
of
people
in
the
Mitchelstown
area
who
would
gladly
take
one
of
this
house
if
they
be
transfer
to
social
housing
status
.
official
in
the
northern
division
of
Cork
County
Council
tell
I
that
because
of
certain
funding
and
resource
stipulation
put
in
place
during
the
preparation
of
the
affordable
housing
scheme
,
the
status
of
this
house
cannot
be
change
from
affordable
to
social
housing
.
I
be
certain
that
be
not
the
only
such
estate
in
the
country
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
should
allow
some
flexibility
.
in
case
where
the
social
housing
waiting
list
be
of
a
certain
size
,
it
could
show
some
degree
of
flexibility
to
ensure
such
house
be
occupy
.
in
this
way
the
problem
of
anti-social
behaviour
can
be
offset
.
we
need
a
common
-
sense
approach
to
the
use
of
empty
house
under
the
auspices
of
local
authority
.
I
refer
to
the
tenant
purchase
scheme
.
I
have
encounter
many
people
who
have
pay
rent
to
local
authority
and
invest
thousand
of
euro
in
they
house
during
the
year
.
as
a
result
of
restriction
on
the
tenant
purchase
scheme
,
they
be
prevent
from
purchase
they
house
.
if
there
be
great
flexibility
and
the
discounting
system
be
more
extensive
,
many
old
local
authority
resident
who
have
invest
much
money
in
they
house
and
make
it
they
own
could
purchase
it
.
it
would
realise
a
certain
amount
for
the
State
and
allow
it
,
in
turn
,
to
embark
on
a
further
housing
programme
.
I
realise
that
my
colleague
,
deputy
Lynch
,
have
do
a
lot
of
work
in
this
area
,
which
I
acknowledge
.
the
State
must
find
imaginative
solution
to
this
problem
and
should
examine
the
possibility
of
introduce
such
scheme
.
the
Acting
Chairman
,
deputy
Cuffe
,
state
in
he
contribution
to
the
debate
that
some
progress
have
be
make
.
however
,
a
good
deal
more
could
be
make
and
many
imaginative
solution
implement
.
we
may
propose
such
solution
through
motion
and
the
work
of
deputy
Lynch
who
be
the
Labour
Party
spokesperson
on
the
issue
.
such
solution
must
be
take
on
board
.
we
seek
to
work
positively
to
address
the
issue
.
many
rural
dweller
do
not
wish
to
be
shepherd
into
large
urban
area
to
be
facilitate
in
social
housing
.
the
State
must
make
provision
for
such
person
and
allow
they
,
if
eligible
for
social
housing
,
to
be
house
within
they
community
.
the
vibrancy
of
any
community
depend
on
a
housing
mix
in
which
that
demographic
be
also
cater
for
.
in
raise
this
matter
,
I
be
seek
to
highlight
the
fact
that
,
in
the
view
of
the
100
plus
gps
who
refer
people
to
it
,
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
a
centre
of
excellence
.
it
be
also
a
secondary
care
facility
that
cater
for
the
need
of
a
population
base
of
well
over
100000
.
if
the
national
service
plan
,
as
envisage
,
be
implement
,
the
accident
and
emergency
department
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
will
be
downgrade
to
a
minor
injury
unit
.
the
gps
from
whom
I
have
receive
representation
and
the
people
who
live
in
the
area
want
to
know
what
will
be
the
future
of
the
accident
and
emergency
department
.
there
be
a
concern
that
if
it
be
downgrade
to
the
status
of
a
minor
injury
unit
,
many
gps
in
the
area
will
bypass
Mallow
General
Hospital
and
refer
people
instead
to
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
.
give
a
expect
population
base
of
4.53
million
in
2009
,
it
be
vital
hospital
such
as
Mallow
General
Hospital
maintain
some
coherence
in
term
of
accident
and
emergency
service
.
reduce
or
diminish
it
to
a
minor
injury
clinic
will
result
in
more
people
be
put
into
the
narrow
funnel
that
be
Cork
University
Hospital
,
which
be
not
the
way
to
go
.
I
have
take
advice
on
the
matter
from
general
practitioner
who
refer
stroke
patient
and
people
with
heart
complaint
to
this
hospital
.
many
of
this
intervention
can
be
deal
with
by
the
accident
and
emergency
department
.
downgrade
the
hospital
to
a
minor
injury
unit
will
have
a
adverse
effect
on
outcome
for
patient
.

(
a)
under
the
2000
-
2006
round
,
the
European
Commission
will
process
the
final
operational
Programme
payment
(
estimate
at
over
€
20
million
in
aid
)
base
on
the
submission
of
the
Member
State
's
final
closure
document
.
(
b)
it
be
estimate
that
aid
of
€
130
million
(
approx
.
)
will
be
receive
in
respect
of
education
related
measure
during
the
period
2007
-
2013
.
I
respectfully
ask
that
time
be
make
available
for
a
debate
on
the
2009
allocation
make
by
the
National
Road
Authority
for
non-national
road
.
the
reason
I
seek
a
debate
be
that
County
Cork
have
receive
a
allocation
of
€
61
million
,
the
27th
low
of
the
29
local
authority
.
the
county
have
more
than
11000
kilometer
of
roadway
.
the
reason
I
ask
for
a
debate
be
that
it
be
important
to
examine
the
allocation
make
by
the
NRA
in
relative
term
and
in
the
context
of
Exchequer
expenditure
on
road
,
particularly
in
County
Cork
.
be
it
not
in
order
to
ask
for
a
debate
?
why
?
I
wish
to
record
my
utter
disgust
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
staff
and
patient
of
the
Heatherside
Hospital
in
north
Cork
,
at
the
HSE
's
unilateral
decision
to
close
the
facility
which
have
house
42
patient
for
many
year
.
the
decision
be
illogical
and
without
any
common
sense
basis
.
it
be
take
without
any
consultation
with
the
stakeholder
,
the
nursing
staff
or
the
patient
.
this
be
a
facility
that
have
look
after
patient
with
mental
health
issue
for
several
year
.
what
be
happen
in
society
be
disgusting
.
this
42
patient
will
be
move
into
a
facility
that
be
already
close
down
,
unfit
for
human
habitation
and
with
Dickensian
condition
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
government
or
the
HSE
be
at
,
particularly
when
they
give
we
much
rhetoric
on
how
well
they
look
after
mentally
ill
patient
.
I
be
call
on
they
to
put
a
stay
of
execution
on
this
decision
until
such
time
as
there
be
consultation
with
the
patient
's
representative
,
the
family
and
the
community
to
ensure
everyone
's
rights
and
entitlement
be
vindicate
.
if
we
have
any
sense
of
decency
,
this
issue
will
be
re-examine
.
I
call
on
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
to
intervene
directly
with
the
HSE
to
ensure
the
rights
and
entitlement
of
the
affect
patient
be
protect
and
common
decency
prevail
.
that
be
factually
incorrect
.
I

the

make

for
the
umpteenth
time
,
when
will
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
be
publish
?
with
all
due
respect
that
be
a
inadequate
answer
.
we
have
be
ask
this
question
for
the
past
year
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
people
on
this
side
of
the
House
that
we
be
not
get
the
right
answer
.
in
light
of
the
Taoiseach
's
announcement
on
Tuesday
,
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
Financial
Regulator
's
proposal
to
examine
a
specific
code
on
mortgage
.
can
the
minister
provide
a
clear
picture
as
to
what
that
entail
?
the
vast
bulk
of
expenditure
by
that
in
the
private
and
public
sector
be
on
mortgage
.
when
will
the
government
introduce
some
scheme
to
grant
relief
to
mortgage
holder
who
lose
they
job
?
while
the
current
rate
of
home
repossession
be
quite
low
,
it
can
be
reasonably
assume
that
the
rate
will
increase
seriously
in
the
next
few
year
.
I
would
like
to
get
some
response
from
the
minister
in
that
regard
.
the
Taoiseach
's
statement
also
refer
to
tax
credit
available
to
company
and
exemption
on
capital
gain
tax
.
if
the
exemption
be
significantly
increase
beyond
€
40000
it
would
give
a
further
incentive
for
people
to
come
into
that
sector
.
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
should
be
amend
to
allow
people
who
be
go
to
become
unemployed
to
avail
of
educational
training
,
include
how
to
start
up
they
own
company
,
without
lose
they
entitlement
.
we
need
to
be
a
bit
more
imaginative
.
if
we
be
go
to
create
tax
exemption
base
on
production
in
the
smart
economy
,
one
must
create
incentive
for
people
to
get
into
that
sector
in
the
first
instance
.
I
ask
about
tax
exemption
,
but
get
no
reply
.

will
the
minister
tell
we
whether
it
be
envisage
that
the
Health
Act
1970
,
which
guarantee
the
right
to
a
bed
,
will
be
revoke
and
whether
that
right
will
be
enshrine
in
the
new
legislation
?
if
that
right
be
not
to
be
revoke
and
in
the
event
of
somebody
decide
not
to
sign
up
to
and
be
a
willing
stakeholder
in
this
scheme
but
it
be
decide
medically
that
the
person
require
a
bed
,
will
he
or
she
have
a
automatic
right
to
a
bed
in
a
public
or
private
facility
?
on
the
resourcing
of
the
scheme
,
if
somebody
go
into
a
private
facility
,
will
the
charge
accrue
for
the
provision
of
that
bed
be
cap
by
the
State
?
will
the
state
legislate
for
or
regulate
the
charge
of
nurse
home
for
the
provision
of
that
bed
?
I
can
envisage
a
situation
where
the
private
sphere
,
because
of
the
economy
of
scale
in
that
sector
and
the
dramatic
reduction
in
the
provision
of
public
bed
for
elderly
people
,
will
see
a
opportunity
,
when
the
budget
be
outline
each
year
in
the
annual
estimate
pass
by
this
House
,
to
get
together
,
pool
they
resource
and
calculate
what
the
charging
regime
could
be
for
a
bed
.
that
will
present
untold
problem
for
many
family
.
can
the
minister
comment
specifically
on
this
issue
?
if
a
person
have
a
property
and
a
son
or
daughter
have
be
bequeath
that
property
or
if
a
son
or
daughter
who
be
not
married
have
be
give
that
property
legally
and
if
there
be
a
legal
arrangement
whereby
the
person
have
a
automatic
right
to
residence
in
the
home
,
what
be
the
legal
provision
in
the
event
of
that
person
go
into
a
nursing
home
?
the
regime
at
present
be
such
that
even
though
the
son
or
daughter
be
reside
within
the
family
home
and
there
be
a
legal
arrangement
to
that
effect
,
there
be
still
a
calculation
of
15
%
rental
income
in
arrive
at
the
nursing
home
subvention
.
that
be
unfair
.
I
consider
it
so
unfair
that
I
have
refer
the
specific
case
to
the
ombudsman
,
as
a
independent
source
,
to
ascertain
she
determination
on
such
a
provision
.
what
will
the
legal
provision
be
in
the
new
arrangement
,
after
the
legislation
be
pass
?
we
be
shore
up
many
problem
but
in
seek
to
deal
with
one
set
of
problem
the
House
and
the
government
will
create
a
new
set
.
I
still
cannot
get
my
head
around
the
proposal
in
the
legislation
regard
ancillary
state
support
.
I
refer
member
to
the
citizen
Information
Board
which
produce
a
paper
in
December
2008
that
refer
specifically
to
ancillary
state
support
in
the
context
of
this
Bill
.
the
paper
say
the
Bill
distinguish
between
state
support
and
ancillary
state
support
.
we
be
aware
of
the
provision
relate
to
state
support
but
,
accord
to
the
paper
one
must
apply
separately
for
ancillary
state
support
;
one
can
apply
even
if
one
do
not
qualify
for
state
support
;
ancillary
state
support
can
be
base
on
relevant
asset
only
,
not
cash
asset
;
and
there
must
be
a
property
over
which
a
charge
can
be
take
.
if
somebody
apply
for
ancillary
state
support
,
a
charge
be
level
against
the
property
.
what
be
the
repayment
schedule
on
that
?
if
I
need
to
go
to
a
nursing
home
tomorrow
,
for
example
,
and
I
apply
for
ancillary
state
support
,
what
agency
will
pay
the
money
to
the
nursing
home
in
term
of
the
support
that
be
give
?
will
it
be
the
HSE
or
another
such
agency
as
determine
by
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
?
if
this
will
be
a
resource
-
base
scheme
and
if
we
be
now
live
in
time
of
economic
turmoil
,
I
can
see
a
situation
where
there
will
be
hundred
of
people
queue
up
for
nursing
home
bed
who
will
not
be
able
to
get
one
as
they
will
not
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
ancillary
state
support
because
there
will
not
be
such
funding
.
how
that
will
work
its
way
out
through
the
system
need
to
be
tease
out
.
we
be
reach
a
stage
in
this
country
where
the
community
bed
that
once
provide
wonderful
nursing
home
care
be
be
whittle
away
by
a
process
of
stealth
.
we
be
move
so
far
into
the
private
sector
that
by
the
time
it
come
for
I
to
be
care
for
in
a
nursing
home
,
the
cost
accrue
will
be
so
astronomical
it
will
place
such
a
burden
on
the
State
as
to
be
untenable
.
at
this
stage
of
the
process
I
would
put
forward
a
theory
that
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
analysis
about
how
we
can
provide
bed
within
the
public
sector
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
42
-
bed
facility
in
north
Cork
which
be
about
to
be
close
.
it
be
neither
a
geriatric
nor
a
psychiatric
unit
;
it
have
no
designation
.
it
be
a
wonderful
facility
in
a
wonderful
setting
.
if
,
instead
of
be
close
,
it
receive
the
right
amount
of
investment
,
it
could
provide
a
wonderful
facility
for
the
provision
of
care
for
the
elderly
within
its
catchment
area
as
a
community
facility
.
that
same
people
would
happily
pay
they
pension
or
a
proportion
of
the
cost
of
get
they
bed
within
that
facility
and
they
would
gladly
welcome
whatever
subvention
or
state
support
that
would
arise
.
however
,
there
be
no
foresight
and
no
planning
.
I
see
nothing
in
this
legislation
that
would
give
I
any
grounds
for
hope
—
I
must
be
honest
about
it
—
that
the
minister
will
ensure
we
will
move
seamlessly
from
the
current
regime
into
a
new
regime
and
that
this
will
be
a
panacea
for
the
elderly
.
I
can
see
a
situation
where
the
number
of
people
,
family
member
of
person
who
be
in
nursing
home
,
who
come
to
my
clinic
will
increase
as
a
result
of
this
ill
thought
-
out
legislation
.
I
hear
the
Taoiseach
describe
himself
here
as
a
egalitarian
Republican
.
if
we
be
speak
of
egalitarianism
,
old
people
should
be
able
to
come
to
they
autumn
or
winter
year
with
a
certain
peace
of
mind
know
that
they
or
they
family
will
not
be
leave
with
a
undue
financial
burden
when
it
come
to
care
for
they
.
I
cannot
see
anything
in
this
legislation
that
will
give
solace
to
that
people
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
if
we
be
to
have
a
proper
system
in
this
country
,
it
must
be
with
the
proviso
that
the
cost
of
care
in
nursing
home
must
be
cap
.
deputy
O'Dowd
make
the
point
early
.
there
be
the
bare
cost
of
provision
for
the
bed
for
the
week
but
there
be
also
the
extra
cost
that
now
seem
to
be
accrue
,
which
be
not
account
for
.
I
refer
to
chiropody
,
hairdressing
and
other
such
service
which
seem
to
be
add
on
week
in
,
week
out
.
I
be
not
against
the
private
sector
because
I
visit
nursing
home
on
a
regular
basis
and
I
see
the
good
work
that
be
be
do
there
,
but
there
must
be
a
good
mix
.
this
come
back
to
the
point
I
make
about
the
1970
Act
.
I
be
ask
that
the
1970
act
not
be
rescind
and
that
everybody
would
have
a
right
to
a
bed
,
whether
in
the
public
or
private
sector
.
my
Department
be
currently
in
the
process
of
advise
the
school
concerned
of
the
impending
withdrawal
of
this
post
.
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
will
be
forward
to
he
directly
,
when
the
school
concerned
have
be
notify
.
the
minister
neglect
to
mention
that
before
the
common
position
be
reach
,
it
be
propose
to
reduce
the
quantity
of
pesticide
supply
or
use
by
50
%
.
that
proposal
do
not
take
into
account
the
national
plant
health
requirement
to
have
certain
substance
available
.
similarly
,
it
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
property
of
the
substance
concerned
.
will
a
list
of
the
specific
pesticide
that
be
to
be
prohibit
as
a
result
of
the
directive
,
or
the
common
position
that
have
be
reach
,
be
provide
?
the
minister
mention
that
people
will
have
to
be
train
to
use
pesticide
.
will
such
training
comprise
another
layer
of
bureaucracy
to
be
deal
with
by
landowner
and
farmer
before
they
can
set
about
they
daily
business
of
grow
crop
?
what
be
the
Irish
position
on
this
directive
?
I
accept
that
the
directive
be
specifically
aim
at
protect
human
and
animal
health
,
which
be
laudable
.
we
need
to
find
out
,
within
the
remit
of
question
Time
,
what
impact
the
directive
will
have
on
farmer
and
landowner
.
will
a
list
of
pesticide
be
prescribe
?
when
minister
speak
about
EU
legislation
,
they
have
a
tendency
to
use
word
like
"
lacuna
"
.
the
minister
's
response
be
somewhat
confusing
.
I
will
try
to
interpret
it
as
good
I
can
when
I
read
the
official
report
.
if
there
be
a
common
position
and
a
framework
for
community
action
,
there
will
be
a
prescribe
set
of
pesticide
use
or
function
.
will
there
be
a
define
list
?
will
pesticide
user
be
require
to
undertake
training
?
do
the
minister
envisage
that
this
will
be
implement
within
a
certain
timeframe
?
the
minister
have
say
that
Ireland
have
a
alliance
with
Britain
and
Hungary
on
this
issue
,
but
what
position
do
the
three
country
take
?
do
Ireland
abstain
when
the
vote
be
take
on
the
final
common
position
?
do
Ireland
vote
against
it
?
I
understand
the
target
set
by
the
EU
Commission
for
the
production
of
biofuel
be
10
%
by
2020
.
the
European
Parliament
and
its
environment
committee
,
which
consist
of
member
from
across
the
political
divide
,
vote
to
scale
down
the
propose
EU
-
wide
target
of
10
%
by
2020
to
4
%
by
2015
.
notwithstanding
the
1800
hectare
of
miscanthus
plant
,
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
,
we
have
move
from
the
planting
of
137
hectare
of
energy
crop
in
2003
to
just
more
than
9000
hectare
in
2007
,
which
represent
approximately
0.02
%
of
all
agricultural
land
.
Teagasc
have
estimate
that
potentially
75000
to
100000
hectare
of
land
could
be
devote
to
energy
crop
in
Ireland
without
impact
negatively
on
food
production
.
be
the
target
that
have
be
set
realistic
?
be
the
government
do
enough
to
encourage
farmer
to
get
into
the
business
of
grow
crop
for
fuel
?
how
will
the
food
versus
fuel
debate
impact
on
Ireland
?
what
be
the
government
do
to
encourage
more
farmer
to
diversify
into
such
production
?
be
there
a
ready
market
available
for
fuel
crop
?
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
it
be
hardly
a
bureaucratic
target
,
it
be
a
political
target
that
be
reach
partly
with
the
agreement
of
the
green
movement
throughout
the
European
Union
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
when
I
say
that
.
we
be
currently
at
a
point
where
fuel
price
have
decrease
due
to
the
fall
in
oil
price
.
the
government
have
a
tendency
to
take
its
foot
off
the
pedal
with
regard
to
develop
a
coherent
and
long
-
term
policy
.
post
CAP
reform
,
there
will
be
a
abyss
into
which
many
Irish
farmer
will
fall
.
there
will
be
significant
loss
of
revenue
.
this
be
one
way
in
which
the
slack
can
be
take
up
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
government
must
come
back
to
the
House
with
a
define
government
policy
on
how
farmer
can
look
to
the
future
with
regard
to
alternative
energy
production
and
the
creation
of
market
.
the
question
be
whether
there
will
be
a
loss
of
money
to
farmer
.
the
point
of
modulation
,
as
the
minister
have
state
,
be
to
contribute
towards
environmental
measure
such
as
water
conservation
.
will
the
money
involve
be
control
by
the
Department
?
will
they
be
pay
directly
to
farmer
,
or
will
they
be
pay
to
other
agency
as
determine
by
the
Department
to
administer
that
scheme
?
the
point
be
whether
farmer
will
lose
money
through
the
measure
that
be
suppose
to
be
incorporate
within
modulation
.
to
what
extent
do
the
minister
believe
that
the
commodification
of
dairy
product
and
the
fact
that
they
be
tradeable
commodity
have
a
effect
on
the
market
and
on
the
price
of
milk
for
Irish
farmer
?
this
should
be
take
into
account
.
be
there
discussion
at
EU
level
or
within
the
WTO
framework
to
tackle
the
fact
that
commodification
be
cause
great
vagary
in
price
?
that
be
have
a
impact
on
the
market
here
.
I
anticipate
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
spend
some
time
in
the
air
to
visit
some
of
the
event
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
there
be
a
significant
budget
for
Bord
Bia
.
it
be
money
well
spend
when
one
think
of
the
return
.
the
€
8
billion
to
€9
billion
in
food
export
will
be
one
of
the
saviour
if
this
economy
be
to
lift
itself
out
of
recession
.
the
emphasis
on
food
production
will
be
vital
in
that
sense
.
have
there
be
a
full
restoration
of
the
market
in
light
of
the
pork
dioxin
scare
?
I
refer
to
the
market
prior
to
6
December
.
as
I
understand
it
,
we
have
lose
some
market
share
to
the
UK
because
of
the
sterling
differential
,
which
be
a
major
factor
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
but
we
need
to
step
up
we
effort
in
term
of
the
potential
of
continental
Europe
give
that
we
have
33
%
of
export
there
currently
.
there
be
a
great
potential
in
continental
Europe
.
I
do
not
necessarily
expect
the
Minister
of
State
to
come
back
with
a
reply
on
that
one
give
the
timeframe
—
it
be
just
by
way
of
a
general
comment
.
we
wish
to
support
the
motion
on
the
basis
that
the
permutation
of
the
HSE
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
for
the
delivery
of
care
for
people
in
the
mid-west
will
have
untold
consequence
for
that
who
do
not
live
in
the
region
serve
by
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
in
address
this
motion
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
for
the
southern
region
,
where
the
national
service
plan
have
be
publish
.
we
have
also
recently
receive
a
document
from
the
HSE
state
that
new
efficiency
to
the
value
of
€
80
million
be
seek
in
its
operation
.
the
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
have
not
be
publish
in
the
south
.
have
read
the
Fine
Gael
motion
and
the
prescription
of
the
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
for
the
mid-west
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
delivery
of
service
in
the
combine
Munster
region
,
as
espouse
in
this
document
,
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
hospital
in
Nenagh
,
Ennis
and
Mallow
.
while
I
might
be
accuse
of
be
parochial
,
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
hospital
in
Mallow
be
like
that
in
Ennis
and
Mallow
,
and
to
address
this
as
a
Munster
-
wide
issue
.
there
have
be
no
politically
accountable
,
coherent
analysis
of
the
HSE
's
proposal
.
this
be
the
first
time
that
the
House
have
have
a
opportunity
to
properly
debate
they
implication
and
it
be
happen
on
Opposition
time
.
the
government
should
make
time
available
to
debate
the
issue
adequately
so
that
we
can
go
through
the
implication
of
this
proposal
euro
by
euro
,
and
hospital
by
hospital
.
we
have
witness
the
erosion
by
stealth
of
service
at
the
former
county
hospital
in
Mallow
.
a
ct
scanner
be
put
in
place
a
few
year
ago
and
become
operational
last
year
for
approximately
ten
to
15
hour
per
week
,
but
now
run
for
between
four
and
six
hour
per
week
.
last
week
,
we
find
out
that
the
ear
,
nose
and
throat
service
will
be
take
away
in
one
fall
swoop
.
we
have
also
be
notify
that
no
child
under
the
age
of
16
will
be
treat
within
the
hospital
and
that
the
long
-
term
plan
be
to
replace
the
accident
and
emergency
unit
with
a
nurse
-
lead
minor
injury
clinic
.
the
motion
note
that
between
15
and
30
people
be
regularly
on
trolley
for
over
24
hour
in
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
if
service
in
Mallow
be
further
reduce
the
same
will
apply
to
Cork
University
Hospital
.
we
in
the
Munster
region
be
argue
for
a
re-think
of
the
policy
.
clinician
who
advise
I
,
and
the
120
gps
who
serve
the
hospital
,
say
that
there
should
be
no
diminution
in
service
in
Mallow
general
hospital
until
the
HSE
can
guarantee
that
the
service
be
available
in
Cork
University
Hospital
.
that
be
the
logic
of
the
argument
be
apply
to
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
and
to
the
hospital
in
Nenagh
and
Ennis
.
there
be
a
complete
lack
of
foresight
in
the
approach
to
this
.
every
time
I
raise
the
issue
with
the
upper
echelon
of
the
HSE
management
in
the
southern
region
,
I
meet
vague
answer
and
lack
of
specifics
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
minister
can
dress
up
the
service
plan
for
the
southern
region
as
a
configuration
,
or
a
reconfiguration
,
because
it
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
the
service
be
deliver
to
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
,
Ennis
and
Nenagh
.
that
who
reside
in
the
catchment
area
will
have
to
travel
further
to
get
into
Cork
University
Hospital
and
Limerick
Regional
which
will
force
more
people
through
a
narrow
bottleneck
.
the
service
and
capacity
do
not
exist
within
that
hospital
.
there
be
no
logic
in
seek
to
further
downgrade
the
satellite
hospital
that
serve
Cork
University
and
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
we
want
a
proper
debate
on
this
and
I
ask
that
the
government
make
time
available
for
it
.
I
appreciate
that
Fine
Gael
raise
this
issue
and
we
support
it
.
how
much
time
do
I
have
leave
?
why
be
Fianna
Fáil
deputy
elect
by
this
constituency
allow
this
to
happen
?
why
do
that
deputy
constantly
move
to
blame
it
on
the
HSE
?
be
we
to
believe
that
Professor
Drumm
,
by
virtue
of
he
management
of
the
HSE
,
be
the
de
facto
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
?
be
there
no
voice
on
the
government
backbench
from
the
Munster
region
serve
by
the
hospital
at
Mallow
,
Ennis
and
Nenagh
that
will
call
a
halt
to
what
the
HSE
be
try
to
do
?
if
we
proceed
with
the
degradation
of
service
at
this
hospital
there
be
no
way
that
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
and
Limerick
Regional
will
be
able
to
deal
with
the
capacity
.
that
will
have
untold
consequence
.
the
hospital
in
Mallow
serve
over
100000
people
in
four
county
.
I
speak
to
the
staff
in
Cork
University
hospital
and
if
one
visit
it
on
any
give
day
,
one
will
see
that
the
accident
and
emergency
unit
cannot
cope
with
the
number
come
through
.
why
would
the
government
seek
to
further
diminish
service
to
the
satellite
hospital
?
we
support
the
motion
and
believe
that
if
the
government
backbencher
who
represent
constituency
serve
by
the
hospital
at
Ennis
,
Nenagh
and
Mallow
have
any
backbone
they
will
support
such
motion
because
in
that
way
they
will
support
the
people
.

I
be
pleased
to
inform
the

that
a
refurbishment
project
for
the
school
to
which
he
refer
be
include
among
the
list
of
major
school
building
project
which
I
announce
today
to
go
to
tender
and
construction
this

.
my
official
will
shortly
be
contact
each
school
on
the
list
about
the
next
step
they
should
take
to
progress
they
project
.
I
understand
the
government
Chief
whip
state
he
expect
such
legislation
could
be
draft
within
the
next
fortnight
.
be
that
still
a
realistic
prospect
?
I
be
raise
with
the
notion
that
the
taxation
system
should
be
progressive
,
base
on
equity
and
one
's
ability
to
pay
.
this
be
not
a
pension
levy
;
it
be
a
levy
on
income
.
it
be
completely
and
utterly
contrary
to
any
canon
of
taxation
and
to
the
Republican
—
I
use
that
in
the
wide
sense
of
the
word
—
ideal
to
which
we
subscribe
in
this
great
little
liberal
democracy
of
ours
.
I
wish
to
reflect
the
anger
of
one
person
in
north
Cork
who
write
to
I
and
whose
voice
be
reflective
of
thousand
of
other
.
I
wish
to
read
into
the
record
a
e-mail
I
receive
from
he
.
it
state
:
I
be
appal
at
the
propose
levy
of
7.5
%
be
impose
on
I
by
the
government
.
I
be
a
commit
public
servant
who
work
hour
far
in
excess
of
that
require
by
my
work
contract
,
for
nothing
.
in
December
2008
alone
I
work
forty
hour
overtime
for
which
I
neither
claim
nor
be
give
payment
.
during
my
twenty
-
three
year
of
public
service
I
have
work
about
ten
hour
a
week
overtime
without
pay
,
on
many
occasion
I
have
work
far
more
than
that
.
last
year
my
condition
of
employment
be
vary
and
I
be
oblige
to
pay
eighty
euro
additional
tax
per
week
.
I
do
so
without
complaint
.
this
year
in
January
a
employment
levy
be
impose
on
I
that
take
a
additional
twelve
euro
plus
per
week
.
now
in
February
2009
I
be
be
tell
to
pay
a
additional
ninety
Euros
pension
levy
for
which
I
will
receive
no
benefit
whatsoever
!
my
deduction
prior
to
the
imposition
of
any
of
this
additional
tax
be
as
follow
:
PRSI
[
approximately
]
3.25
%
,
Superannuation
plus
Widows
and
Orphans
6.5
%
,
notional
service
7.28
%
total
17.03
%
plus
VHI
of
[
approximately
]
fifty
euro
as
my
prsi
contribution
entitle
I
to
nothing
while
my
wife
and
I
be
both
alive
.
I
recently
put
two
member
of
my
family
through
third
level
college
and
receive
no
grant
whatsoever
.
my
weekly
deduction
after
this
levy
be
apply
will
total
approximately
four
hundred
and
sixty
Euro
per
week
.
I
have
always
feel
that
it
be
my
duty
as
a
Irish
citizen
to
give
a
contribution
above
and
beyond
that
call
for
by
my
work
contract
.
I
have
do
so
willingly
and
have
even
enjoy
do
so
.
I
pay
my
tax
and
do
so
without
complaint
.
I
feel
that
I
be
do
what
every
loyal
Irishman
or
Irishwoman
should
do
and
that
every
other
work
Irishman
or
Irish
woman
be
do
the
same
.
now
,
however
,
I
feel
that
I
be
be
single
out
as
a
soft
target
because
of
my
position
as
a
public
servant
and
that
my
contribution
to
Irish
society
and
the
country
have
be
demean
.
I
would
not
object
as
vehemently
if
the
load
be
spread
out
evenly
among
all
contributor
.
however
,
if
and
when
we
get
back
on
we
foot
in
this
country
,
I
will
still
be
pay
this
levy
,
whereas
if
it
be
income
tax
I
would
be
treat
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
other
taxpayer
and
when
tax
be
reduce
all
round
again
I
would
also
benefit
.
[
this
]
be
not
to
be
the
case
,
however
,
and
I
will
remain
a
victim
of
this
unjust
imposition
for
the
rest
of
my
working
life
.
you
will
understand
why
I
feel
that
my
commitment
and
dedication
be
not
appreciate
,
why
I
feel
that
I
be
be
single
out
as
a
scapegoat
for
the
economic
collapse
and
why
I
will
not
feel
in
the
future
that
I
should
go
that
extra
mile
,
as
I
and
many
other
do
every
week
of
every
year
without
acknowledgement
or
expectation
of
it
.
this
be
taxation
without
consultation
,
a
punitive
measure
direct
at
a
section
of
Irish
society
that
have
contribute
to
Irish
economic
growth
without
receive
a
commensurate
reward
.
the
government
must
seriously
rethink
its
strategy
on
what
I
call
this
income
levy
.
we
be
all
willing
to
share
the
burden
but
if
we
be
to
spread
the
burden
,
it
must
be
do
on
the
basis
of
equity
and
fairness

I
wish
to
share
my
time
with
Deputy
Morgan
and
Ó
Caoláin
.
I
propose
to
take
ten
minute
.
the
Bill
be
be
present
to
we
against
a
backdrop
of
a
announcement
today
that
AIB
be
to
write
off
€
1.8
billion
in
bad
loan
for
2008
.
the
minister
be
ask
the
House
to
support
a
Bill
that
will
recapitalise
that
same
bank
to
the
tune
of
€
3.5
billion
.
that
be
laudable
but
only
if
it
result
in
provision
of
credit
line
to
business
and
borrower
in
general
.
the
Labour
Party
must
critically
assess
the
proposal
bring
before
we
in
the
Bill
.
as
I
understand
it
,
€
4
billion
of
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
's
current
resource
will
be
use
as
part
of
that
recapitalisation
,
out
of
the
total
of
€
7
billion
.
bear
in
mind
that
the
global
market
be
not
touch
Irish
stock
currently
,
I
wonder
whether
that
be
a
wise
move
and
whether
the
methodology
the
minister
propose
in
the
Bill
be
not
without
its
flaw
.
we
be
tell
by
the
minister
that
he
have
consult
widely
with
financial
and
property
expert
in
draft
this
Bill
.
I
would
like
to
know
who
be
that
financial
and
property
expert
.
I
become
a
little
afraid
when
I
hear
of
minister
take
the
advice
of
property
expert
give
the
culture
we
have
be
use
to
in
recent
year
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
nature
of
that
advice
and
whether
there
be
a
alternative
advice
to
that
on
which
he
have
base
he
Bill
.
for
example
,
what
be
the
alternative
advice
,
if
any
,
on
devolve
more
power
to
the
minister
with
regard
to
direct
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
Commission
"
to
make
investment
in
such
institution
and
to
underwrite
they
share
issue
"
?
such
a
concentration
of
power
must
be
question
and
the
minister
must
tell
we
whether
there
be
scope
for
this
power
to
be
abuse
.
it
be
a
theoretical
question
but
in
term
of
the
enactment
of
a
law
it
be
worthy
of
answer
by
the
minister
in
he
reply
.
for
instance
,
if
the
minister
determine
,
for
political
expediency
,
that
a
investment
should
be
make
in
a
specific
financial
institution
,
and
if
the
NPRF
determine
that
this
be
contrary
to
any
responsible
investment
policy
,
it
be
powerless
to
act
against
such
a
move
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
responsible
investment
policy
be
one
of
the
key
component
underpin
the
governance
of
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
.
furthermore
,
invest
such
power
in
the
minister
bypass
this
House
and
any
scrutiny
we
may
wish
to
pursue
in
this
regard
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
address
that
point
when
reply
to
the
debate
.
in
he
contribution
the
minister
tell
we
that
the
State
will
get
a
direct
return
for
its
investment
.
in
the
current
climate
,
and
in
the
context
of
AIB
's
write
-
down
of
€
1.8
billion
today
,
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
any
return
to
the
taxpayer
any
time
soon
.
I
understand
that
if
we
take
the
long
-
term
view
a
alternative
view
could
be
argue
but
the
fundamental
principle
underpin
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
be
the
responsible
investment
policy
.
that
be
a
state
policy
that
give
rise
to
the
need
to
meet
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
of
social
welfare
pension
and
public
service
pension
to
be
pay
from
the
year
2025
to
2055
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
the
Bill
should
,
ceteris
paribus
,
yield
a
return
to
the
Exchequer
over
a
long
-
term
period
if
a
number
of
assumption
be
take
.
if
we
assume
there
be
no
restructuring
of
the
banking
regime
in
this
country
within
that
period
of
time
,
that
be
,
that
no
bank
will
merge
or
there
will
be
no
rationalisation
or
consolidation
of
banking
,
then
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
taxpayer
will
see
a
return
on
he
or
she
investment
but
I
question
the
minister
's
strategy
in
that
regard
.
that
we
invest
with
the
possibility
of
a
return
be
fair
enough
but
the
manner
in
which
the
minister
have
pitch
the
propose
return
on
the
investment
speak
to
I
of
a
ill
-
think
out
strategy
that
allow
the
bank
to
dictate
the
term
by
which
they
will
be
recapitalise
and
not
the
people
,
through
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
whose
money
will
be
use
for
this
purpose
.
the
minister
propose
to
get
a
preference
share
with
a
fix
dividend
of
8
%
or
ordinary
share
in
lieu
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
explain
the
reason
he
be
propose
to
take
preference
share
in
the
first
instance
instead
of
ordinary
share
.
if
the
minister
be
buy
preference
share
with
a
fix
dividend
at
today
's
price
,
what
will
be
the
total
yield
to
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
if
that
share
be
buy
back
by
the
bank
within
the
five
year
period
?
I
understand
they
have
a
provision
to
do
so
or
they
be
allow
to
do
so
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
minister
have
allow
the
bank
a
provision
to
buy
back
share
within
the
five
year
period
at
today
's
price
.
I
question
the
validity
of
such
a
strategy
and
wonder
if
it
would
have
be
more
expedient
for
the
taxpayer
's
money
,
through
the
NPRF
,
to
be
use
to
buy
ordinary
share
.
that
would
have
be
a
more
responsible
strategy
.
if
the
two
bank
report
loss
within
the
next
five
year
,
what
will
be
the
status
of
the
8
%
yield
on
that
preference
?
also
,
what
will
happen
to
the
yield
?
if
there
be
a
return
of
8
%
,
where
will
that
yield
be
invest
?
will
it
be
award
to
the
NPRF
?
I
would
also
like
to
know
what
the
minister
mean
,
in
layman
's
term
,
when
he
state
that
he
will
allow
the
commission
to
set
up
a
special
purpose
investment
vehicle
.
notwithstanding
that
I
have
a
degree
in
economics
,
I
admit
with
a
degree
of
humility
that
I
do
not
have
a
clue
what
a
special
purpose
investment
vehicle
be
.
when
we
be
write
legislation
in
this
house
,
and
if
we
be
use
taxpayer
's
money
to
underpin
a
strategy
of
recapitalisation
,
we
must
have
it
set
out
to
we
in
clear
term
what
exactly
that
mean
.
if
the
minister
be
to
be
give
devolve
power
and
if
we
be
set
up
special
purpose
investment
vehicle
,
we
must
know
for
exactly
what
purpose
they
be
design
and
,
if
there
be
a
return
on
such
a
vehicle
,
the
nature
of
that
return
and
how
that
investment
will
be
pitch
.
will
they
be
for
philanthropic
purpose
?
will
they
be
a
sop
to
we
learn
friend
in
the
Green
Party
?
will
there
be
a
sustainable
element
to
that
vehicle
?
what
will
be
the
nature
of
that
vehicle
?
the
people
be
entitle
to
know
that
and
it
must
be
set
out
clearly
in
any
legislation
that
be
bring
before
the
House
.
I
wish
to
address
some
point
make
by
deputy
Gogarty
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
personal
in
my
response
to
he
contribution
early
but
I
wish
to
state
for
the
record
that
I
have
never
take
a
bribe
or
a
red
cent
from
any
corporate
entity
,
except
through
a
fund
-
raising
race
event
I
hold
whereby
local
company
buy
in
to
a
race
night
I
run
when
I
be
raise
fund
to
try
to
get
elect
to
this
House
.
there
be
a
desire
by
deputy
Gogarty
to
impugn
certain
member
of
this
House
and
develop
a
language
that
state
that
we
be
not
credible
to
critically
analyse
any
measure
that
come
forth
from
this
government
in
respect
of
any
tract
of
legislation
because
somehow
we
respective
party
in
opposition
be
dirty
by
the
fact
that
they
may
have
take
corporate
donation
.
I
wish
to
state
for
the
record
that
I
have
never
take
corporate
donation
in
that
sense
of
the
word
.

the
financial
crisis
be
due
to
both
external
and
internal
factor
,
external
in
that
the
belief
we
hold
regard
the
behaviour
of
bank
and
financial
market
as
actor
in
a
real
economic
setting
have
be
challenge
like
never
before
.
it
must
be
say
that
somewhere
in
the
recess
of
we
mind
there
be
a
nebulous
idea
that
the
global
financial
economic
structure
be
base
on
a
false
premise
but
we
never
realise
just
how
much
the
Irish
banking
sector
be
tie
to
that
false
premise
.
we
be
now
leave
with
a
new
rhetoric
from
the
centre
leave
and
centre
right
about
the
role
of
the
State
.
the
question
for
all
of
we
be
how
to
construct
a
new
narrative
for
the
position
we
be
in
and
a
solution
for
the
next
generation
.
this
country
be
over
-
reliant
on
tax
receipt
from
stamp
duty
.
that
issue
will
be
analyse
until
kingdom
come
and
there
be
nothing
that
I
can
bring
to
that
analysis
that
be
new
.
the
question
now
be
how
we
get
ourselves
out
of
this
morass
and
restore
we
economic
well
-
being
,
and
what
we
can
do
to
ensure
a
sustainable
economic
and
social
model
into
the
future
.
the
restoration
of
the
economy
must
be
base
on
strong
government
intervention
and
co-decision
making
with
we
European
Union
partner
.
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
have
vanish
and
the
question
remain
as
to
what
will
replace
it
.
this
country
be
nowhere
near
a
fiscal
stimulus
plan
and
all
talk
of
change
,
President
Obama
style
,
be
futile
.
what
we
need
now
be
a
new
definition
of
the
role
of
market
and
the
role
of
the
State
regard
market
behaviour
.
I
be
encourage
by
the
fact
that
the
European
Commission
publish
proposal
last
week
that
would
set
up
a
pan-European
regulatory
body
with
strong
power
to
intervene
in
national
regulation
.
unfortunately
,
that
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
Ireland
's
soft
attitude
in
regulate
the
behaviour
of
financial
institution
.
we
await
the
political
outcome
of
such
proposal
and
I
hope
the
government
will
support
that
initiative
.
it
be
necessary
if
it
be
to
send
a
message
to
global
market
that
Ireland
be
get
its
house
in
order
.
if
the
government
be
to
restore
public
finances
it
must
also
restore
confidence
.
the
restoration
of
confidence
will
ensure
that
investor
will
once
again
begin
to
look
at
Ireland
.
give
that
we
be
a
open
economy
,
it
be
vital
that
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
be
see
in
a
positive
light
.
I
be
encourage
by
the
fact
that
the
EU
monetary
affair
Commissioner
have
state
publicly
that
any
country
in
crisis
will
receive
financial
assistance
in
advance
of
the
International
Monetary
Fund
knock
on
we
door
.
we
must
be
encourage
by
that
signal
.
in
term
of
the
motion
before
we
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
any
government
strategy
have
to
incorporate
we
European
Union
partner
.
without
they
,
we
be
doom
.
in
put
forward
this
idea
I
be
conscious
that
a
new
language
must
emerge
,
which
be
one
of
social
solidarity
.
this
government
have
seek
to
pitch
sectional
interest
against
each
other
.
we
need
a
new
language
that
do
not
put
the
private
sector
against
the
public
sector
or
the
urbanite
against
the
rural
dweller
.
any
intervention
make
by
government
must
be
base
on
equity
and
on
the
basis
that
each
bear
the
pain
in
accordance
with
they
ability
to
pay
.
we
all
have
idea
.
we
membership
of
this
house
be
base
on
the
notion
that
we
put
forward
idea
to
get
elect
here
.
I
suggest
we
examine
the
notion
of
social
capital
.
amidst
this
economic
storm
there
be
practical
solution
that
would
put
thousand
to
work
if
the
government
think
more
laterally
about
its
policy
intervention
.
many
community
be
in
need
of
serious
investment
in
term
of
public
work
that
could
be
carry
out
at
a
extra
marginal
cost
but
that
would
yield
a
massive
return
in
term
of
add
to
the
quality
of
this
country
's
citizen
's
life
.
we
need
a
proactive
government
intervention
at
the
most
basic
and
community
level
to
ensure
we
community
can
survive
.
in
that
light
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
in
the
past
six
month
my
colleague
within
the
Labour
Party
have
put
forward
some
concrete
proposal
,
we
wish
to
work
in
a
positive
sense
to
try
to
do
what
we
can
to
get
this
country
up
and
run
again
.
today
I
speak
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Róisín
Shortall
,
who
put
forward
proposal
on
the
inclusion
of
certain
person
within
the
tax
net
.
in
the
past
two
week
or
so
,
we
have
hear
many
social
commentator
speak
about
the
fact
that
38
%
of
the
population
be
currently
outside
the
tax
net
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
mini
-
budget
in
the
come
month
and
if
we
be
talk
about
change
the
tax
code
or
increase
personal
taxation
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
there
be
large
number
within
that
38
%
bracket
who
be
pensioner
and
low
pay
.
if
the
government
propose
to
bring
more
people
into
the
tax
net
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
of
equity
and
not
on
the
basis
of
make
sure
that
that
people
on
marginal
or
low
income
be
not
tax
unfairly
.
I
wish
to
advise
the
deputy
that
a
new
Community
College
be
under
construction
in
Adamstown
,
which
will
cater
for
1000
pupil
.
this
school
building
be
plan
to
come
on
stream
in
2009
and
will
operate
under
the
patronage
of
County
Dublin
vec
.
base
on
current
demographic
trend
,
my
Department
anticipate
that
there
will
be
a
need
for
a
further
post
-
primary
school
in
Lucan
in
the
medium
term
to
cater
for
a
long
-
term
project
enrolment
of
1000
pupil
.
my
Department
have
be
in
contact
with
South
Dublin
County
Council
regard
a
potential
site
for
future
educational
provision
in
the
area
,
and
have
arrange
a
technical
inspection
of
the
various
site
option
identify
by
South
Dublin
County
Council
.
this
option
be
currently
be
consider
and
the
Department
will
be
in
further
contact
with
South
Dublin
County
Council
in
the
come
week
regard
the
matter
.
I
thank
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
for
share
time
with
I
.
I
will
start
with
a
simple
question
—
will
the
minister
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
?
I
want
a
clear
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
from
she
.
if
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
keep
the
hospital
open
,
people
want
to
know
the
extent
of
its
service
in
future
.
we
have
be
meet
with
nothing
but
confusion
and
obfuscation
concern
the
provision
of
service
in
the
HSE
south
region
in
recent
month
.
we
have
have
the
national
service
plan
2009
,
the
reconfiguration
of
hospital
report
for
the
HSE
south
region
,
which
be
also
publish
this
year
,
and
we
have
also
have
the
teamwork
report
and
the
Howarth
report
.
now
we
be
be
tell
that
Professor
John
Higgins
will
examine
proposal
on
savings
that
will
be
garner
as
a
result
of
the
cut
to
be
implement
.
the
people
of
the
HSE
south
region
want
to
know
what
will
happen
by
way
of
fact
,
figure
and
timeline
.
we
be
sick
of
this
culture
that
exist
whereby
the
only
person
who
will
answer
publicly
for
HSE
decision
be
Professor
Drumm
.
we
want
to
know
why
people
in
the
hospital
network
office
of
the
HSE
south
region
,
and
other
such
high
-
rank
figure
,
be
not
speak
publicly
and
answer
in
proper
,
public
fora
for
the
decision
they
be
take
.
there
be
a
positive
alternative
to
the
scenario
that
be
currently
provide
by
the
HSE
south
region
.
the
minister
must
listen
to
gps
who
be
refer
to
hospital
like
Mallow
and
Cork
University
Hospital
.
she
must
listen
to
people
work
at
the
coalface
.
if
we
listen
more
to
doctor
and
other
health
professional
and
less
to
the
coterie
of
managerial
mandarin
,
we
would
be
able
to
effect
a
proper
system
that
could
guarantee
health
service
to
the
public
.
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
I
want
to
know
today
if
she
intend
to
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
on
behalf
of
that
region
's
taxpayer
,
I
also
want
to
know
what
future
scenario
she
envisage
for
the
hospital
.
we
can
rotate
far
more
discipline
from
Cork
University
Hospital
through
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
in
addition
,
we
can
enhance
the
service
at
Mallow
and
add
value
to
they
.
that
case
be
also
be
make
by
health
professional
who
be
operate
in
that
catchment
area
.
we
need
proper
answer
without
obfuscation
.
early
,
I
ask
whether
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
would
like
a
clear
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
.
I
understand
the
minister
reply
by
state
it
would
be
subject
to
revise
service
plan
.
in
the
event
that
the
subject
plan
do
not
adhere
to
standard
lay
down
by
the
Department
,
what
do
she
envisage
for
the
future
of
the
hospital
?
we
need
clarity
on
this
once
and
for
all
.
the

that

require
difficult

the

will
impact
on

depend
on
whether

I
wish
to
provide
a
example
of
one
of
the
way
in
which
we
might
assist
people
who
have
recently
become
unemployed
.
I
refer
to
the
provision
of
State
-
back
loan
to
allow
people
to
return
to
postgraduate
education
.
a
number
of
month
ago
I
be
contact
by
a
friend
of
mine
who
reside
in
the
west
.
the
man
in
question
graduate
from
UCG
in
the
mid-1990
and
have
since
work
as
a
design
engineer
for
a
blue
chip
company
.
he
be
highly
qualified
but
he
be
make
redundant
because
the
American
company
for
which
he
be
work
file
for
chapter
11
bankruptcy
.
after
12
year
,
my
friend
be
offer
a
statutory
redundancy
package
.
he
now
propose
to
embark
on
a
mba
programme
but
in
order
to
do
so
he
will
be
oblige
to
put
up
€
16000
from
he
own
savings
.
when
one
consider
that
he
be
get
married
late
in
the
year
,
there
be
no
doubt
this
be
quite
a
amount
of
money
.
he
approach
he
local
county
council
,
the
local
enterprise
board
and
FÁS
but
he
be
turn
down
by
each
for
funding
to
assist
he
to
retrain
and
up
-
skill
so
that
when
thing
get
good
he
could
return
to
the
job
market
.
if
that
person
be
provide
with
a
loan
from
the
State
,
specifically
for
postgraduate
study
,
he
tell
I
he
would
be
more
than
willing
to
draw
it
down
if
he
could
repay
it
as
soon
as
he
re-enter
the
workforce
.
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
a
administrative
fee
and
even
a
low
rate
of
interest
on
the
loan
.
I
see
the
logic
of
he
suggestion
.
if
we
can
fund
the
bank
to
the
tune
of
€
7
billion
,
I
do
not
understand
why
we
cannot
direct
that
bank
to
provide
lending
for
people
in
such
circumstance
.
they
cannot
pay
exorbitant
postgraduate
fee
at
present
because
every
cent
they
have
must
go
on
keep
life
and
limb
together
.
the
money
they
have
be
real
income
that
will
be
use
,
in
this
person
's
case
,
for
survival
and
to
keep
food
on
the
table
.
there
must
be
lateral
thinking
about
where
we
be
go
.
the
old
paradigm
relate
to
how
we
allocate
resource
and
money
have
go
out
the
window
.
there
be
a
opportunity
now
to
come
up
with
radical
proposal
.
let
we
not
be
afraid
to
embrace
radical
proposal
on
how
to
get
back
on
we
foot
.
if
the
person
I
mention
be
give
that
assistance
,
he
would
not
squander
it
.
everything
he
have
do
have
be
achieve
through
hard
work
.
that
be
,
generally
,
the
nature
of
the
Irish
psyche
.
nobody
want
anything
for
free
and
if
they
can
get
some
form
of
assistance
,
they
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
if
it
be
give
in
a
equitable
fashion
.
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
address
the
economic
regulatory
affair
committee
yesterday
.
he
say
the
country
's
competitiveness
have
be
on
the
wane
for
some
time
.
if
this
government
intend
to
put
forward
a
budget
shortly
,
it
must
examine
the
issue
of
competitiveness
and
the
cost
of
employ
people
in
the
current
environment
.
employer
's
prsi
must
be
change
in
some
way
to
make
it
easy
for
employer
to
retain
employee
.
the
government
must
deal
with
this
in
its
deliberation
on
the
budget
.
the
information
request
be
currently
be
collate
by
my
Department
and
will
be
forward
to
the
deputy
as
soon
as
it
be
available
.
give
that
what
the
minister
have
outline
represent
a
short
-
term
response
,
will
he
indicate
whether
a
long
-
term
response
have
be
discuss
?
I
ask
this
question
in
the
context
of
the
announcement
by
Dairygold
,
one
of
the
main
processor
in
Munster
,
that
it
have
have
to
reduce
milk
price
by
17.4
cent
per
litre
in
the
last
12
month
.
the
price
be
currently
bottom
out
at
some
20
cent
per
litre
.
the
intervention
mechanism
to
which
the
minister
refer
,
such
as
aid
to
private
storage
and
export
fund
,
will
have
a
short
-
term
effect
in
term
of
improve
price
.
have
there
be
any
political
discussion
on
the
overall
quota
regime
?
why
have
the
minister
entirely
rule
out
revisit
the
health
check
?
as
he
say
,
we
be
under
quota
.
in
the
current
global
economic
environment
,
the
demand
for
dairy
-
base
product
be
reduce
significantly
over
time
.
have
there
be
any
political
analysis
of
how
that
will
pan
out
?
give
we
emphasis
on
milk
-
base
production
,
there
will
be
serious
implication
for
the
agriculture
sector
if
there
be
no
improvement
in
global
demand
.
there
will
be
little
choice
but
to
revisit
the
health
check
because
it
will
have
serious
implication
for
how
we
produce
dairy
-
base
product
into
the
future
.
I
do
not
see
how
such
a
review
can
be
rule
out
emphatically
without
some
degree
of
debate
and
analysis
of
where
we
be
go
.
in
term
of
the
market
for
both
product
and
the
derivation
of
by
-
product
from
willow
and
miscanthus
,
have
the
department
undertake
a
study
in
regard
to
market
viability
?
also
,
do
the
minister
of
State
envisage
this
scheme
to
be
a
long
term
sustainable
scheme
,
sustainable
in
the
sense
of
it
be
maintain
as
a
scheme
?
I
be
concerned
that
the
suckler
cow
welfare
scheme
may
be
abolish
or
further
erode
.
that
be
the
basis
of
my
decision
to
table
this
question
.
over
32000
beef
farmer
have
participate
in
the
Teagasc
training
session
that
be
require
under
the
scheme
.
it
be
vitally
important
that
the
scheme
be
maintain
in
the
first
instance
.
the
answer
give
by
the
minister
will
not
reassure
the
House
.
will
the
scheme
be
maintain
?
if
so
,
farmer
be
entitle
to
know
the
level
at
which
it
will
be
maintain
.
I
appreciate
that
the
minister
cannot
make
a
statement
on
the
budgetary
position
ahead
of
7
April
next
.
however
,
farmer
be
entitle
to
know
whether
the
scheme
will
be
maintain
.
the
position
be
that
application
have
be
receive
from
three
high
education
institution
for
designation
as
University
;
Waterford
Institute
of
Technology
,
Dublin
Institute
of
Technology
and
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
.
the
issue
of
university
designation
do
not
just
affect
the
institution
and
the
region
from
which
application
have
be
receive
;
it
also
impact
on
the
future
structure
of
the
high
education
system
throughout
the
country
.
the
government
want
to
build
on
we
strength
and
to
provide
a
environment
where
all
we
high
education
institution
can
develop
in
a
way
that
well
serve
the
country
as
a
whole
as
well
as
the
region
where
they
be
base
.
I
have
ask
the
strategy
group
on
high
education
to
report
to
I
before
the
end
of
the
year
with
a
two
-
decade
road
map
for
the
development
of
the
sector
.
that
group
be
now
critically
examine
the
role
and
relationship
of
high
education
institution
so
that
the
system
can
deliver
the
level
of
efficiency
,
performance
,
innovation
and
growth
that
will
optimise
Ireland
's
'
smart
'
economic
recovery
and
social
development
.
there
be
no
plan
to
advance
any
of
the
current
application
for
university
status
before
the
strategy
group
complete
its
work
.
the
position
be
that
application
have
be
receive
from
three
high
education
institution
for
designation
as
University
;
Waterford
Institute
of
Technology
,
Dublin
Institute
of

and
Cork

.
the
issue
of
university
designation
do
not
just
affect
the
institution
and
the
region
from
which
application
have

I
welcome
the
minister
's
statement
.
this
be
the
second
time
in
a
short
period
that
the
minister
have
clarify
the
situation
in
respect
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
when
will
the
Teamwork
report
be
publish
?
the
reconfiguration
document
be
publish
on
15
January
and
lay
before
the
regional
health
forum
.
the
document
state
that
the
only
service
rotate
through
Mallow
General
Hospital
would
be
outpatient
and
obstetrics
and
gynaecology
service
and
no
other
service
be
envisage
.
ENT
service
be
now
be
cut
,
which
do
not
tally
with
the
minister
's
statement
.
will
the
minister
further
clarify
what
day
procedure
service
she
envisage
would
rotate
through
Mallow
General
Hospital
in
future
?
there
be
a
number
of
centre

excellence
in
Mallow
General

also
.
do
the
minister
not
acknowledge
that
a
lack
of
investment
in
a
day
procedure
unit
,
which
have
be
moot
for
the
past
ten
year
,
be
the
reason
that
statistic
be
low
?
if
there
have
be
such
investment
,
Mallow
General
Hospital
would
be
punch
even
further
above
its
weight
than
it
do
at
present
.

I
welcome
this
opportunity
to
speak
on
the
Bill
.
how
do
we
arrive
at
a
stage
in
the
country
's
development
where
thousand
of
people
be
on
local
authority
waiting
list
yet
thousand
of
house
throughout
the
land
be
unoccupied
?
when
do
we
,
economically
and
socially
speak
,
decide
that
a
house
would
become
a
tradeable
commodity
to
be
use
as
a
instrument
for
investment
primarily
and
not
as
a
place
of
refuge
or
to
raise
a
family
?
until
such
time
as
we
legislate
in
this
area
with
people
in
mind
and
give
up
we
obsession
with
the
property
market
we
be
doom
to
repeat
the
same
mistake
.
we
have
,
through
this
legislation
,
a
opportunity
to
provide
decent
housing
for
all
that
who
need
it
,
if
only
we
can
embark
on
a
little
lateral
thinking
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
,
state
that
recent
figure
publish
show
a
massive
jump
from
43700
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
to
nearly
60000
in
just
three
year
.
how
do
we
come
to
this
point
when
so
many
house
be
be
build
during
this
period
?
with
the
right
thinking
,
this
legislation
provide
a
golden
opportunity
to
address
the
imbalance
that
exist
within
the
social
housing
sector
.
the
relationship
between
the
Department
and
the
local
authority
need
to
reflect
the
reality
on
the
ground
.
for
instance
,
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
there
be
a
local
authority
scheme
at
Stag
Park
in
Mitchelstown
where
affordable
house
remain
unsold
and
be
board
up
.
I
have
queue
out
the
door
of
my
clinic
in
Mitchelstown
with
people
on
the
social
housing
list
who
would
dearly
love
to
obtain
one
of
this
modern
,
well
-
appoint
and
fantastically
design
house
.
however
,
they
will
remain
unsold
until
such
time
as
the
Department
free
up
the
financial
obligation
of
the
local
authority
to
the
department
with
regard
to
they
sale
.
the
current
market
condition
dictate
that
they
will
remain
unsold
because
they
have
be
board
up
for
so
long
that
a
certain
stigma
be
attach
to
they
.
the
Department
must
become
more
flexible
in
its
approach
.
a
house
which
be
designate
as
a
affordable
house
and
which
be
unsold
within
a
specific
period
must
be
allow
to
be
occupy
at
the
discretion
of
the
local
authority
if
the
local
authority
have
make
a
decent
attempt
to
sell
the
house
.
the
Minister
of
State
must
examine
this
.
countless
thousand
of
affordable
house
throughout
the
State
could
be
use
for
social
housing
but
this
cannot
be
do
because
of
certain
constraint
place
upon
they
.
generally
,
I
be
in
favour
of
voluntary
housing
association
but
I
have
certain
reservation
about
trend
that
I
have
see
within
this
sector
.
I
be
anxious
that
voluntary
housing
association
would
not
supplant
the
role
of
the
local
authority
in
term
of
the
provision
of
social
housing
.
it
be
true
that
they
fulfil
a
need
in
term
of
catering
to
a
certain
demographic
.
however
,
I
have
document
case
and
have
representation
from
quite
a
number
of
constituent
who
find
that
once
they
occupy
a
voluntary
housing
association
property
,
they
find
they
have
no
recourse
to
eventual
purchase
or
to
a
independent
arbiter
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
they
tenancy
.
in
one
case
I
encounter
,
the
rent
of
a
couple
on
a
fix
social
welfare
income
be
increase
substantially
by
the
voluntary
housing
association
and
they
have
no
recourse
to
a
independent
arbiter
when
they
seek
to
question
the
increase
.
this
issue
must
be
address
.
Irish
people
will
always
want
to
own
they
own
home
.
this
be
ingrain
within
we
psyche
.
this
trait
must
inform
how
we
formulate
policy
.
if
one
provide
a
social
house
it
must
be
on
the
basis
that
it
will
become
available
for
purchase
in
the
medium
to
long
term
.
this
choice
and
right
must
exist
even
if
it
be
not
exercise
.
the
current
tenant
purchase
scheme
be
woefully
inadequate
,
in
that
there
would
be
a
golden
opportunity
to
sell
off
old
housing
stock
if
it
be
discount
at
a
more
favourable
rate
.
most
local
authority
house
I
visit
which
have
long
-
term
tenancy
have
so
much
invest
in
they
by
the
occupier
that
the
valuation
they
get
when
they
seek
to
purchase
the
house
have
no
bear
on
the
original
real
cost
of
construction
and
the
amount
invest
in
the
intervene
period
.
if
one
wish
to
purchase
one
's
home
in
the
current
climate
there
be
a
discount
rate
but
it
have
become
a
instrument
of
the
market
by
virtue
of
a
valuation
which
must
be
seek
.
this
be
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
people
have
build
community
around
they
home
and
have
ensure
the
upkeep
of
the
house
for
the
duration
of
they
tenancy
.
if
we
be
to
incentivise
the
ownership
of
house
we
must
create
good
condition
to
allow
old
people
to
purchase
they
home
.
there
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
State
in
that
it
would
yield
a
massive
dividend
and
would
provide
a
opportunity
in
term
of
significantly
reduce
maintenance
cost
to
local
authority
.
section
16
provide
that
make
a
draft
plan
be
require
.
the
country
be
face
a
pension
nightmare
for
the
future
.
on
several
occasion
,
I
recall
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
remind
we
that
life
expectancy
have
risen
dramatically
since
the
government
come
into
office
.
I
question
she
claim
to
fame
in
this
respect
,
but
if
we
be
live
long
,
then
any
draft
plan
must
be
formulate
on
the
basis
that
housing
provision
for
old
people
in
the
future
be
encapsulate
within
such
plan
.
we
cannot
keep
shove
people
into
nursing
home
,
and
shelter
housing
be
only
part
of
the
solution
.
where
a
draft
plan
be
formulate
on
foot
of
a
county
development
plan
,
land
must
be
zone
specifically
for
housing
for
the
elderly
.
there
must
be
some
degree
of
forward
planning
which
must
start
now
to
deal
with
that
issue
.
if
people
be
currently
reside
in
quite
large
house
,
they
will
want
to
downsize
in
the
future
.
it
be
probable
that
there
will
be
a
demand
for
small
unit
.
County
development
plan
—
by
extension
,
the
draft
housing
plan
—
must
take
account
of
that
kind
of
planning
.
we
cannot
just
plan
for
the
next
two
or
three
year
,
but
for
20
year
hence
.
we
need
a
little
bit
of
foresight
in
that
respect
.
in
my
experience
,
I
have
find
that
planning
policy
unit
lack
the
necessary
resource
to
carry
out
demographic
study
of
population
trend
for
future
housing
provision
.
the
government
must
take
cognisance
of
this
.
the
CSO
could
be
a
viable
instrument
in
assist
local
authority
in
that
respect
.
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
with
which
I
be
most
familiar
be
in
north
Cork
,
and
it
have
be
well
deploy
.
this
be
the
case
because
the
staff
have
use
the
scheme
to
good
effect
,
which
be
a
tribute
to
people
who
be
use
limited
resource
.
how
do
we
get
to
a
stage
where
we
would
use
taxpayer
's
money
—
approximately
€450
million
—
to
pay
a
rental
subsidy
to
a
landlord
with
a
second
or
third
home
,
to
ensure
housing
provision
for
people
on
the
housing
list
?
there
be
a
economic
fallacy
to
that
argument
.
it
defy
any
kind
of
logic
or
common
sense
.
we
need
to
wean
ourselves
off
this
dependence
on
rent
allowance
.
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
rental
accommodation
scheme
if
resource
be
be
allocate
to
provide
house
for
people
in
need
.
if
we
take
approximately
€450
million
per
annum
,
there
be
a
multiplier
from
that
which
would
adequately
provide
capital
spending
for
all
of
the
social
housing
need
.
I
be
not
rail
against
the
scheme
as
it
currently
exist
,
because
it
have
do
well
in
the
circumstance
in
which
it
operate
,
but
there
must
be
more
lateral
thinking
about
how
we
provide
social
housing
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
examine
.
the
over
-
supply
of
housing
in
large
part
of
the
country
in
the
recent
past
must
teach
we
that
the
relationship
between
demand
and
supply
must
be
a
qualitative
one
and
not
base
on
quantity
alone
.
we
must
re-jig
we
thinking
in
this
area
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
antisocial
behaviour
in
this
respect
.
we
have
a
scheme
on
Mallow
Town
Council
whereby
the
council
and
other
source
fund
a
tenant
liaison
officer
.
since
that
officer
's
contract
of
employment
have
to
be
terminate
because
there
be
not
adequate
funding
to
meet
the
need
the
qualitative
relationship
between
the
tenant
and
the
local
authority
have
deteriorate
.
the
work
the
person
in
question
carry
out
on
a
three
year
contract
be
so
valuable
that
the
relationship
between
tenant
and
the
local
authority
improve
dramatically
during
that
period
and
the
incidence
of
antisocial
behaviour
reduce
dramatically
.
one
way
to
deal
with
antisocial
behaviour
be
to
build
relationship
by
ensure
that
a
tenant
liaison
officer
be
appoint
under
statutory
provision
in
every
local
authority
jurisdiction
.
the
relationship
building
process
in
this
instance
be
do
over
time
and
with
a
very
meticulous
approach
and
it
yield
result
.
that
need
to
be
examine
in
this
Bill
.
section
30
state
that
the
housing
authority
can
delegate
some
or
all
of
its
management
and
control
function
in
respect
of
its
dwelling
to
a
designate
body
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
expand
on
that
provision
.
I
have
a
certain
reservation
that
if
we
move
to
code
power
to
the
voluntary
housing
association
,
we
would
code
exclusive
control
of
social
housing
policy
to
non-statutory
body
.
the
minister
should
speak
about
this
in
he
response
.
there
be
land
zone
in
Mallow
that
be
own
by
the
town
council
,
in
which
a
plan
for
more
than
100
house
be
formulate
.
the
entrance
to
that
site
be
currently
no
wide
than
the
width
of
two
car
.
there
be
a
lack
of
join
up
thinking
where
land
own
by
a
council
be
zone
for
local
authority
housing
.
there
must
be
proper
access
to
the
site
.
the
land
adjoin
a
private
estate
and
if
one
consider
the
multiplier
of
100
house
for
car
and
traffic
movement
,
then
without
any
rectification
of
the
access
,
we
be
store
up
difficulty
for
the
future
.
we
cannot
speak
about
antisocial
behaviour
or
about
build
community
unless
we
have
proper
zoning
and
proper
access
to
local
authority
housing
site
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
as
well
.
for
too
long
,
social
housing
have
be
a
poor
relation
in
long
-
term
planning
.
Successive
government
have
build
house
with
the
sole
aim
of
get
people
off
the
list
.
that
in
itself
be
worthwhile
,
but
we
have
never
think
about
the
implication
of
crowd
hundred
of
house
into
one
area
without
any
thought
for
the
implication
of
lack
of
proper
space
,
amenity
space
and
proper
access
to
the
site
.
that
be
why
so
many
problem
exist
.
there
will
be
a
great
opportunity
presently
for
the
government
to
ensure
social
housing
provision
in
a
way
that
provide
for
everyone
in
need
of
housing
.
we
must
have
some
foresight
in
we
thinking
in
that
regard
.
under
the
current
term
of
the
third
level
student
grant
scheme
,
maintenance
grant
be
not
payable
to
candidate
who
already
hold
a
qualification
and
be
pursue
a
second
qualification
at
the
same
level
.
this
restriction
apply
to
every
student
who
already
hold
a
qualification
at
the
same
level
,
irrespective
of
where
that
qualification
be
obtain
or
whether
or
not
funding
be
previously
award
.
the
objective
of
the
student
grant
scheme
be
to
assist
as
many
student
as
possible
in
obtain
one
undergraduate
degree
and
in
progress
,
where
appropriate
,
to
postgraduate
study
.
there
be
no
plan
at
present
to
change
the
current
arrangement
.
any
such
proposal
would
have
to
be
consider
in
the
light
of
exist
resource
and
other
compete
demand
in
the
education
sector
.
the
statement
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
to
the
effect
that
the
government
have
take
care
"
to
ensure
that
the
measure
be
equitable
and
highly
progressive
"
be
incorrect
.
base
on
a
initial
analysis
of
the
figure
,
today
's
budget
will
create
a
large
demographic
sector
of
the
working
poor
.
when
the
income
levy
and
health
levy
be
factor
in
as
well
as
the
fact
that
most
people
work
in
the
private
sector
have
have
to
endure
pay
cut
across
the
board
,
the
real
income
they
will
be
leave
with
will
be
so
marginal
that
it
will
not
enable
they
to
have
a
adequate
standard
of
living
.
we
all
appreciate
that
measure
have
to
be
take
.
however
,
they
should
have
be
take
on
the
basis
that
they
would
not
be
regressive
.
there
be
now
a
large
demographic
cohort
of
ordinary
working
family
who
will
be
devastate
financially
by
the
proposal
within
this
document
.
with
regard
to
income
tax
,
we
be
always
tell
that
the
canon
of
taxation
dictate
it
should
be
progressive
.
I
do
not
see
anything
in
the
budget
that
ensure
high
net
worth
individual
will
pay
a
proportionate
amount
of
they
income
towards
get
we
out
of
the
mess
we
be
in
.
I
do
not
see
why
the
Minister
for
Finance
could
not
have
introduce
a
high
tax
rate
at
this
time
so
as
to
cushion
the
blow
against
middle
and
low
income
earner
.
it
be
completely
regressive
and
when
people
wake
up
to
the
fact
of
what
this
document
contain
,
it
will
make
they
even
more
angry
at
the
government
than
they
already
be
.
that
be
why
I
will
not
support
this
resolution
.
the
information
seek
be
not
readily
available
.
I
have
request
official
of
my
Department
to
compile
the
information
available
and
this
will
be
forward
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
explain
the
process
.
the
building
project
for
the
school
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
currently
at
a
early
stage
of
architectural
planning
.
the
progression
of
all
large
scale
building
project
,
include
this
project
,
from
initial
design
stage
through
to
construction
phase
will
be
consider
in
the
context
of
my
Department
's
multi-annual
School
Building
and
Modernisation
Programme
.
however
,
in
light
of
current
compete
demand
on
the
capital
budget
of
the
Department
,
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
indicative
timeframe
for
the
progression
of
the
project
at
this
time
.
we
be
right
.
be
it
not
a
very
cynical
move
to
introduce
such
a
measure
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
know
it
would
not
affect
people
until
the
winter
?
it
speak
volume
about
how
this
government
treat
old
people
that
it
do
not
have
the
gut
to
try
this
in
December
,
during
normal
budgetary
time
,
because
if
that
who
march
when
the
government
try
to
take
medical
card
from
the
over
-
70
number
thousand
,
they
would
be
out
in
they
hundred
of
thousand
during
December
.
we
now
live
in
a
society
with
a
breakdown
in
the
intergenerational
solidarity
that
always
sustain
the
community
in
this
country
.
that
a
government
would
take
away
a
economic
measure
that
give
comfort
to
old
people
,
at
a
time
when
people
spend
extra
on
they
family
and
themselves
,
be
miserly
and
unbelievable
.
no
Fianna
Fáil
leader
,
such
as
Lemass
or
de
Valera
,
would
have
countenance
such
a
move
during
they
tenure
.
it
be
a
measure
of
how
far
right
this
government
have
move
in
distance
itself
from
the
very
people
who
would
ordinarily
have
support
it
.
the
philosopher
Bertrand
Russell
state
,
"
to
be
happy
in
this
world
,
especially
when
youth
be
past
,
it
be
necessary
to
feel
oneself
not
merely
a
isolated
individual
whose
day
will
soon
be
over
,
but
part
of
the
stream
of
life
flow
on
from
the
first
germ
to
the
remote
and
unknown
future
"
.
this
government
be
increasingly
isolate
we
old
people
,
take
measure
that
be
dump
people
in
nursing
home
who
cannot
get
nursing
home
subvention
,
put
old
people
into
penury
in
respect
of
how
they
pay
for
care
in
they
autumn
and
winter
year
and
now
the
government
be
take
away
a
measure
that
give
some
small
assistance
to
see
they
through
the
winter
month
.
that
who
I
represent
be
not
upper
middle
class
people
live
in
urban
conurbation
.
they
be
live
in
rural
area
,
in
old
housing
stock
,
have
modest
pension
and
must
have
the
fire
lighting
all
day
every
day
to
keep
the
back
boiler
go
to
run
the
radiator
to
ensure
there
be
heat
in
the
house
.
by
reduce
this
payment
,
the
minister
be
tell
we
this
people
can
pay
for
they
heating
cost
but
when
they
go
to
the
community
welfare
officer
to
ask
for
a
supplementary
payment
they
will
not
be
give
it
.
they
would
ordinarily
have
use
the
bonus
to
pay
for
the
extra
bag
of
coal
or
other
such
simple
measure
that
sustain
they
through
the
hard
winter
month
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
think
of
the
intergenerational
solidarity
we
always
have
in
this
country
,
the
social
solidarity
to
which
previous
Fianna
Fáil
government
adhere
,
and
I
ask
she
to
reverse
this
miserly
,
mean
measure
.
to
introduce
it
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
when
it
be
not
so
high
on
the
political
agenda
,
be
a
cynical
move
.
it
be
symptomatic
of
the
cynical
politics
that
inhabit
this
country
.
I
represent
a
rural
constituency
where
many
people
live
in
isolated
area
and
this
scheme
allow
they
to
have
the
peace
of
mind
and
feeling
of
security
bring
about
by
have
a
monitor
alarm
system
.
they
relative
be
also
reassure
by
the
scheme
.
I
do
not
understand
,
therefore
,
why
the
scheme
be
be
suspend
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
be
true
to
he
word
when
he
say
it
will
be
reinstate
in
September
.
this
signify
a
further
erosion
of
service
,
particularly
for
old
people
.
tonight
we
debate
the
loss
of
the
Christmas
bonus
for
pensioner
and
we
all
remember
the
fiasco
of
the
medical
card
for
the
over
70
.
now
many
old
people
who
live
independently
in
isolated
area
no
long
feel
safe
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
this
scheme
.
it
also
give
a
certain
degree
of
comfort
to
people
who
might
embark
on
robbery

money

old
people
have
always
have
a

to
do
so
.
the
reduction
in
home
help
hour
mean
there
be
few
caller
to
people
in

,
so
the
lack
of
monitor
alarm
will
have
a
effect
.
in

Fermoy
area
of
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
,

monitor
alarm

since
January
.
a
further
28
old
people
be
on

they

welcome
the

I
acknowledge
the
work
of
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
in
introduce
the
Garda
Síochána
(
Powers
of
Surveillance
)
Bill
,
which
I
believe
be
the
forerunner
to
the
legislation
before
the
House
today
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
very
helpful
document
publish
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
service
,
which
be
a
invaluable
source
for
I
,
in
particular
,
in
seek
to
interpret
the
legislation
.
the
basis
on
which
we
would
support
the
legislation
be
the
morass
that
exist
in
Irish
society
today
.
this
be
exemplify
by
the
spate
of
ruthless
killing
we
have
borne
witness
to
over
a
number
of
year
.
the
question
outside
this
wall
be
whether
the
tipping
point
have
be
reach
—
and
whether
this
legislative
proposal
will
facilitate
that
tipping
point
to
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
,
again
,
on
we
street
.
we
be
previously
tell
that
the
murder
of
Veronica
Guerin
be
the
turning
point
in
the
context
of
gangland
killing
.
that
point
come
and
go
and
now
we
be
be
tell
that
the
murder
of
Shane
Geoghegan
in
Limerick
be
the
turning
point
.
I
hope
it
be
,
and
I
continue
to
hope
that
this
legislation
,
while
it
will
not
be
a
panacea
,
will
facilitate
a
process
that
will
allow
the
Garda
Síochána
to
have
the
necessary
tool
to
allow
it
to
carry
out
its
work
in
this
regard
.
as
deputy
Rabbitte
have
say
recently
,
in
outline
the
Labour
Party
position
on
this
,
the
fundamental
question
be
whether
the
response
by
way
of
legislation
be
reasonable
,
legitimate
and
proportionate
.
I
believe
that
it
be
and
that
the
Garda
must
be
give
power
to
respond
in
a
manner
that
facilitate
a
preventative
mechanism
.
the
power
within
this
legislation
,
on
first
reading
,
would
deem
that
to
be
the
case
.
I
be
encourage
,
also
,
by
the
statement
on
17
April
by
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
,
which
give
a
cautious
welcome
to
the
Bill
.
its
statement
say
that
intelligence
-
lead
policing
and
not
the
restriction
of
fair
trial
rights
be
the
most
effective
way
to
tackle
gangland
crime
.
I
refer
specifically
to
Mr.
Mark
Kelly
,
the
ICCL
's
director
who
state
that
the
Bill
would
at
last
place
Garda
surveillance
on
a
lawful
basis
that
broadly
conform
to
article
8
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
he
go
on
to
say
that
the
need
for
judicial
authorisation
of
most
form
of
surveillance
be
welcome
.
however
,
it
remain
unclear
why
it
be
feel
unacceptable
to
allow
tracking
device
to
be
place
on
people
's
vehicle
on
Garda
authority
alone
.
while
the
ICCL
have
reservation
,
I
be
sure
many
of
they
can
be
work
through
on
the
late
Stage
of
the
Bill
.
Mr.
Kelly
say
that
in
the
interest
of
protection
of
privacy
,
the
ICCL
be
urge
the
minister
to
publicly
disclose
before
the
Bill
become
law
the
propose
content
of
the
regulation
foreseen
in
section
8
(
2
)
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
will
be
a
human
rights
framework
for
the
use
by
gardaí
of
tracking
device
.
I
understand
that
deputy
Rabbitte
state
early
that
this
would
also
be
tease
out
on
late
Stage
.
however
,
I
welcome
the
ICCL
's
support
while
appreciate
its
concern
in
relation
to
article
8
under
the
European
Convention
of
human
Right
2003
,
and
the
recognition
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
be
maintain
,
or
not
compromise
in
any
way
.
I
hope
that
put
into
effect
a
explicit
statutory
provision
in
relation
to
surveillance
will
assuage
any
fear
regard
the
rights
of
a
individual
and
the
need
to
reduce
crime
.
I
believe
that
iccl
support
for
this
,
while
qualified
,
be
significant
.
my
interpretation
of
this
support
be
that
there
be
no
danger
such
a
act
would
contravene
article
40.3
of
the
constitution
in
term
of
the
personal
rights
of
the
citizen
.
such
article
40.3
rights
be
germane
to
the
tipping
point
or
the
turning
point
I
speak
of
early
.
what
Shane
Geoghegan
's
murder
teach
we
be
that
at
some
crucial
point
the
personal
rights
of
a
citizen
must
not
be
unqualified
.
that
be
to
say
,
they
be
not
absolute
.
if
we
be
to
pursue
he
killer
and
that
of
other
,
then
the
constitutional
rights
of
some
must
be
subservient
to
the
common
good
,
and
as
the
late
Mr.
Justice
Hamilton
previously
state
,
subject
to
the
requirement
of
public
order
and
morality
.
I
believe
that
be
what
this
legislation
be
about
.
it
be
about
ensure
that
we
can
reach
a
stage
where
a
person
's
personal
rights
be
vindicate
but
that
the
common
good
and
the
desire
for
the
rule
of
law
be
maintain
or
restore
within
this
country
.
we
need
to
get
to
a
point
where
we
can
have
some
confidence
that
the
power
the
Garda
have
will
be
use
to
such
a
extent
.
if
I
be
never
involved
in
the
legislative
process
,
I
would
still
take
the
view
that
it
be
necessary
for
the
Garda
to
have
such
power
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
its
function
.
that
this
Bill
will
provide
a
statutory
framework
for
carry
out
such
surveillance
by
gardaí
and
other
be
the
right
approach
at
this
time
.
in
fact
,
it
be
overdue
and
if
the
gardaí
be
not
give
such
power
,
then
the
morass
that
this
society
find
itself
in
,
which
incorporate
the
slaughter
of
innocent
,
will
continue
and
go
unpunished
in
some
case
.
in
address
the
specific
provision
of
the
Bill
,
there
be
a
number
of
question
to
which
I
seek
answer
.
section
5
provide
that
"
a
authorisation
may
be
madeex
parte
and
shall
be
hear
otherwise
than
in
public
''
.
I
hope
that
the
power
to
seek
authorisation
for
surveillance
in
such
circumstance
be
balance
against
the
power
of
the
judge
to
grant
a
specific
authorisation
.
if
I
interpret
that
provision
correctly
,
there
be
no
onus
on
the
superior
officer
to
state
a
particular
offence
and
I
hope
that
this
power
will
be
use
wisely
.
however
,
I
be
satisfied
the
specification
in
regard
to
the
authorisation
leave
no
grounds
for
a
potential
abuse
of
power
.
section
5
outline
that
where
a
authorisation
be
seek
,
there
be
specifics
in
regard
to
the
particular
of
the
surveillance
device
authorise
to
be
use
,
the
person
who
or
the
place
or
thing
to
be
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
,
the
name
of
the
superior
officer
to
whom
it
be
issue
,
the
condition
subject
to
which
the
authorisation
be
issue
and
the
date
of
expiry
.
it
be
necessary
that
there
be
specific
provision
within
that
authorisation
which
will
ensure
there
be
no
vagueness
about
the
authorisation
and
,
therefore
,
it
will
not
be
potentially
open
to
abuse
.
I
welcome
that
provision
in
regard
to
the
authorisation
and
I
hope
it
will
be
stringently
adhere
to
when
implement
.
in
regard
to
section
5
and
6
,
where
a
authorisation
be
seek
,
it
may
authorise
the
superior
officer
name
in
it
or
any
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
,
member
of
the
Defence
Force
or
officer
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
designate
by
that
superior
officer
.
there
be
a
provision
where
a
superior
officer
may
seek
the
authorisation
but
that
any
other
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
can
also
be
subject
to
that
authorisation
.
if
another
garda
who
be
not
a
superior
officer
be
subject
to
that
provision
,
be
he
or
she
name
in
it
?
if
we
be
to
grant
new
power
of
surveillance
,
will
there
be
specific
training
or
will
resource
be
allocate
to
train
junior
officer
under
the
legislation
?
if
the
legislation
be
to
work
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
that
every
officer
,
whether
in
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
the
Garda
Síochána
or
the
Defence
Force
,
be
give
specific
training
which
will
ensure
there
be
no
scope
to
challenge
the
provision
of
the
legislation
thereafter
where
criminal
proceedings
be
bring
.
will
the
minister
address
that
in
he
reply
?
I
refer
to
section
8
.
what
do
the
minister
interpret
as
a
"
tracking
device
"
?
I
have
watch
many
cop
show
and
we
all
know
what
a
tracking
device
be
.
in
practical
term
,
how
will
this
play
out
?
I
know
it
provide
for
specific
vehicle
to
be
track
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
take
on
that
section
when
he
respond
to
the
debate
.
I
refer
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
the
power
vested
in
section
11
.
there
be
a
complaint
procedure
in
the
legislation
which
state
specifically
that
recommendation
can
be
make
and
that
a
matter
can
be
report
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
.
what
be
the
power
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
in
regard
to
the
legislation
?
there
be
a
reporting
procedure
but
be
there
a
power
of
intervention
or
recommendation
which
must
be
act
upon
where
a
complaint
be
make
?
I
understand
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
power
of
a
circuit
Court
judge
and
the
complaint
referee
.
that
be
very
clear
.
however
,
the
power
in
regard
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
be
unclear
to
I
and
I
would
like
a
more
specific
interpretation
of
that
.
I
hope
from
a
societal
point
of
view
,
that
we
have
reach
a
tipping
point
where
we
can
now
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
on
we
street
and
that
once
this
legislation
be
enact
,
there
will
be
a
pressure
on
people
who
have
act
with
impunity
which
will
stymie
they
activity
and
put
they
out
of
business
for
a
long
time
to
come
.
it
be
necessary
to
enact
this
legislation
and
in
that
sense
,
I
welcome
it
.
it
will
not
provide
a
panacea
for
all
we
ill
but
it
will
provide
the
start
of
a
real
process
which
will
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
.

that

I
wish
to
share
my
time
with
deputy
Arthur
Morgan
.
in
the
interest
of
a
overview
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
indicate
the
effect
on
buoyancy
within
the
economy
of
the
most
recent
budget
and
the
subsequent
publication
of
the
Finance
Bill
.
if
the
Labour
Party
's
estimate
be
correct
,
it
be
propose
that
more
than
€
3
billion
will
be
take
out
of
the
economy
as
a
result
of
the
measure
propose
in
the
Bill
.
this
would
have
a
effect
on
economic
buoyancy
through
return
into
the
Exchequer
.
we
be
very
concerned
that
the
lack
of
buoyancy
or
the
effect
on
buoyancy
be
extremely
negative
.
this
will
have
further
negative
consequence
for
economic
growth
in
the
economy
.
I
would
like
a
coherent
and
specific
response
from
the
minister
with
regard
to
the
measure
propose
in
the
Bill
and
they
effect
on
economic
buoyancy
.
it
be
important
that
if
we
find
ourselves
in
a
scenario
where
we
seek
to
stimulate
the
economy
that
we
have
that
figure
.
on
the
pension
levy
and
its

I
have
have

have
never

yet
they
have

how
be
this

deem
eligible

levy
if
they
be

have
never

be

2010
as
originally
envisage
.
government
will
keep
the
matter
under
review
and
be
commit
to
the
full
implementation
of
Epsen
at
the
early
possible
date
.
I
be
particularly
pleased
that
,
in
order
to
strengthen
and
enhance
service
,
and
continue
the
preparation
for
the
full
implementation
of
the
act
at
a
late
date
,
the
government
provide
€
20
m
in
2009
—
€
10
m
for
education
service
and
€
10
m
for
health
service
.
in
my
Department
this
additional
funding
will
provide
for
a
expansion
of
the
NEPS
service
so
that
all
school
in
the
country
will
be
cover
by
the
service
as
well
as
enhance
the
capacity
of
the
NCSE
to
co-ordinate
the
provision
of
service
to
child
with
special
educational
need
.
in
addition
teacher
and
special
need
assistant
will
continue
to
be
deploy
to
school
to
meet
child
's
need
and
there
will
be
further
investment
in
teacher
training
in
this
area
.
we
broadly
welcome
the
legislation
,
which
be
long
overdue
,
and
wonder
why
the
draft
Bill
from
2007
have
not
be
introduce
before
now
.
however
,
it
be
now
before
we
.
it
be
ludicrous
that
a
significant
number
of
people
be
incarcerate
on
the
basis
that
they
be
unable
to
pay
fine
.
it
be
expeditious
and
proper
that
the
State
put
in
place
a
system
to
allow
people
to
pay
they
fine
by
instalment
or
other
means
,
thus
negate
the
need
to
go
to
prison
.
the
case
be
already
make
by
my
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
that
the
problem
that
persist
in
prison
as
a
result
of
overcrowding
be
in
no
small
way
attributable
to
the
fact
that
people
be
in
prison
due
to
non-payment
of
fine
.
this
be
lead
to
a
undue
burden
on
the
State
and
must
be
rectify
.
there
be
a
previous
judgment
in
this
regard
.
I
believe
it
be
Mr.
Justice
Henchy
who
state
that
in
no
circumstance
should
a
court
impose
imprisonment
as
a
alternative
to
a
fine
solely
on
the
grounds
that
the
defendant
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
fine
consider
by
the
court
to
be
appropriate
.
imprisonment
be
the
most
serious
punishment
,
and
if
it
be
not
appropriate
because
the
case
be
not
sufficiently
serious
,
a
fine
should
be
impose
as
a
less
penalty
.
if
the
defendant
cannot
afford
a
appropriate
fine
,
the
amount
should
be
lower
,
and
if
he
or
she
cannot
afford
any
fine
,
imprisonment
should
not
be
consider
as
a
alternative
solely
on
the
grounds
that
the
fine
cannot
be
pay
.
this
be
a
important
point
.
accord
to
that
judgment
,
it
be
good
for
someone
to
walk
free
without
punishment
rather
than
be
punish
by
imprisonment
just
because
he
or
she
have
no
money
to
pay
a
fine
.
otherwise
we
be
imprison
people
on
grounds
of
poverty
rather
than
accord
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offence
they
commit
.
this
legislation
will
facilitate
a
process
whereby
that
people
who
be
unable
to
pay
they
fine
in
one
fall
swoop
will
be
able
to
pay
by
instalment
.
this
result
in
great
equity
in
that
somebody
who
be
convict
of
a
crime
but
be
not
a
criminal
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
word
now
have
a
opportunity
to
pay
the
fine
in
small
instalment
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
do
not
understand
why
,
when
the
Law
Reform
Commission
introduce
recommendation
—
which
in
this
instance
date
back
to
1991
—
the
legislature
do
not
come
forward
with
proposal
in
a
more
timely
fashion
to
rectify
matter
or
make
the
law
good
.
this
Bill
be
first
publish
in
2007
and
the
Law
Reform
Commission
have
be
speak
on
this
issue
since
1991
.
any
function
democracy
should
have
within
its
remit
the
ability
to
enact
law
in
a
timely
fashion
.
if
one
consider
the
cost
factor
alone
,
base
on
the
number
of
people
who
have
serve
prison
sentence
for
non-payment
of
fine
,
we
could
have
save
the
State
countless
thousand
of
euro
if
good
legislation
have
be
introduce
early
.
the
Law
Reform
Commission
,
from
any
document
I
have
see
,
have
be
far
-
reach
in
its
approach
to
this
issue
.
this
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
address
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
fair
that
the
limit
above
which
instalment
can
be
pay
be
€
100
.
this
limit
should
be
remove
so
that
fine
of
less
than
€
100
can
be
also
pay
in
instalment
.
there
be
many
people
out
there
who
survive
on
subsistence
wage
or
rely
solely
on
income
from
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
,
and
to
whom
literally
every
penny
count
.
to
that
people
a
fine
of
as
little
as
€
50
would
be
a
considerable
burden
.
provision
should
be
make
in
the
Bill
so
that
a
fine
of
less
than
€
100
can
be
pay
by
instalment
.
daily
,
I
deal
with
people
who
find
themselves
in
difficulty
over
the
non-payment
of
refuse
charge
,
for
example
.
local
authority
have
system
whereby
€
5
per
week
could
be
pay
.
in
many
such
instance
,
the
outstanding
debt
could
be
as
little
as
€
70
or
€
80
.
the
same
type
of
principle
should
apply
to
this
provision
,
a
matter
I
hope
can
be
address
.
the
legislation
's
net
effect
should
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
impecunious
offender
be
sentence
to
imprisonment
.
there
should
be
careful
monitoring
of
sentencing
practice
across
the
board
to
ensure
the
objective
be
achieve
.
for
this
reason
,
the
Bill
should
provide
for
some
form
of
statistical
analysis
whereby
its
net
effect
can
be
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
measure
in
order
that
we
can
see
the
knock
-
on
effect
in
term
of
any
reduction
in
the
number
of
people
present
to
prison
and
the
success
or
otherwise
of
the
legislation
as
enact
.
if
the
legislation
be
update
in
future
,
it
be
important
that
there
be
a
statistical
analysis
.
in
this
context
,
the
Court
Service
would
be
a
important
actor
.
I
refer
to
the
Bills
Digest
.
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
issue
a
good
document
from
which
it
be
worth
quote
.
it
state
:
a
problem
inherent
in
a
system
of
penalty
base
on
fine
be
the
change
value
of
money
over
time
.
this
can
deprive
a
fine
of
its
punitive
nature
and
reduce
its
deterrent
effect
.
in
term
of
indexation
,
the
schedule
be
clearly
set
out
in
section
2
,
but
we
will
submit
some
amendment
that
will
be
of
a
semantic
nature
as
oppose
to
a
substantive
one
.
a
good
job
have
be
do
in
the
legislation
's
draft
in
term
of
the
change
monetary
effect
that
will
persist
in
future
.
this
be
welcome
.
the
issue
of
a
statement
of
means
should
be
address
.
if
someone
present
himself
or
herself
before
the
court
and
claim
a
inability
to
pay
a
fine
despite
possess
sound
financial
means
,
by
what
mechanism
can
the
judge
determine
whether
the
person
have
the
ability
to
pay
?
while
there
be
provision
in
the
legislation
,
should
it
be
more
prescriptive
?
as
mention
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
section
13
create
a
offence
of
knowingly
or
recklessly
make
a
statement
"
that
be
false
or
misleading
in
any
material
respect
to
a
court
conduct
a
inquiry
into
a
person
's
financial
circumstance
"
.
should
the
section
be
more
prescriptive
in
seek
a
statement
of
means
by
the
convict
person
to
prevent
that
with
means
from
claim
otherwise
?
as
there
be
scope
for
someone
to
misrepresent
he
or
she
position
to
the
court
,
it
might
be
desirable
that
a
statement
of
means
be
swear
by
the
offender
who
be
seek
a
abatement
of
the
fine
by
reason
of
he
or
she
circumstance
.
two
issue
be
not
provide
for
in
the
Bill
,
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
might
respond
.
under
the
Bill
,
could
judge
be
train
to
analyse
the
type
of
scenario
that
appear
before
they
and
to
work
with
the
Court
service
to
ensure
efficiency
be
build
into
the
system
?
there
seem
to
be
no
specific
provision
regard
revenue
offence
.
be
there
such
a
provision
?
I
do
not
wish
to
repeat
the
point
make
by
my
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
,
although
I
could
.
I
would
like
to
see
specific
issue
address
.
the
Labour
Party
be
broadly
in
favour
of
the
Bill
and
strongly
believe
that
it
be
high
time
to
reduce
the
number
present
to
prison
for
,
in
many
instance
,
be
unable
to
pay
fine
.
it
be
proper
that
legislation
be
introduce
to
prevent
such
occurrence
.
the
government
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
many
people
find
it
difficult
to
pay
fine
of
less
than
even
€
100
.
we
also
believe
that
,
since
some
people
might
try
to
misrepresent
they
true
financial
position
before
judge
,
the
Bill
should
have
a
prescriptive
provision
vis
-à
-
vis
the
presentation
of
a
statement
of
means
.
judge
should
be
train
on
the
Bill
's
mechanism
and
its
effect
should
be
monitor
by
the
Court
service
to
ensure
its
intend
impact
because
only
by
means
of
a
statistical
analysis
can
we
measure
the
Bill
's
true
impact
.

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
reporting
by
the
Irish
Examiner
today
that
Cork
University
Hospital

explain
how
she
propose
that

provider

I
also
seek

to
how

notwithstanding

I
welcome
the
publication
of
this
private
Member
's
Bill
and
I
congratulate
deputy
Flanagan
on
the
work
he
have
do
on
it
.
it
be
worthy
of
support
.
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
sum
up
the
basis
of
the
Bill
last
night
when
he
state
that
this
be
a
growth
industry
for
the
time
in
which
we
live
.
person
find
themselves
indebted
for
whatever
reason
and
in
some
case
they
be
extremely
vulnerable
,
stress
and
unable
to
discharge
debt
,
not
because
of
recklessness
on
they
part
but
because
of
the
economic
circumstance
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
only
a
small
number
of
debtor
plunge
themselves
knowingly
and
recklessly
into
this
circumstance
.
in
so
far
as
recklessness
be
involved
,
it
be
not
merely
on
the
side
of
the
consumer
,
but
be
frequently
share
by
the
lender
where
money
be
recklessly
loan
in
circumstance
where
question
might
reasonably
have
be
raise
about
ability
to
repay
.
honest
,
decent
,
law

citizen
find
themselves
in
this
circumstance
,
and
one
have
hear
the
case
be
make
that
they
be
be
subject
to
debt
collection
method
of
which
the
House
could
not
approve
.
it
be
important
to
speak
about
the
culture
surround
instance
where
people
find
themselves
subject
to
inordinate
amount
of
debt
.
it
have
be
state
previously
that
the
level
of
financial
literacy
in
this
country
still
leave
a
lot
to
be
desire
.
if
I
look
at
the
socio-
economic
group
that
find
itself
largely
at
the
mercy
of
debt
collector
,
I
note
they
be
invariably
person
who
may
not
have
a
degree
of
financial
literacy
that
would
pervade
throughout
all
of
the
socio-economic
strata
.
in
1997
,
the
OECD
conduct
a
international
audit
literacy
survey
.
it
find
that
25
%
of
Irish
adult
have
difficulty
with
simple
everyday
numeracy
and
literacy
task
,
such
as
add
up
a
bill
,
understand
a
payslip
or
fill
in
a
building
society
form
.
the
National
adult
literacy
Association
and
MABS
have
do
much
work
in
this
regard
,
but
it
be
important
that
if
this
Bill
be
take
on
board
,
we
should
look
at
the
overall
context
of
people
get
themselves
into
increase
debt
.
a
proportion
of
that
people
will
find
themselves
in
that
situation
because
they
may
not
have
read
the
fine
print
.
it
should
be
acknowledge
that
IFSRA
have
do
much
work
in
make
the
language
of
financial
service
much
clear
for
people
,
and
the
campaign
for
plain
English
have
achieve
much
in
that
respect
.
however
,
there
be
people
who
be
still
get
into
debt
,
either
through
debt
collection
agency
or
debt
collector
,
and
a
portion
of
that
be
due
to
a
inability
to
understand
the
process
on
which
they
embark
in
the
first
instance
.
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
.
when
it
come
to
the
issuance
of
a
licence
for
the
purpose
of
undertake
debt
collection
,
it
be
important
that
something
be
build
into
the
legislation
that
protect
the
consumer
.
the
licence
holder
should
be
make
take
cognisance
of
a
certain
set
of
criterion
.
although
they
be
not
deal
with
specifically
within
the
legislation
,
perhaps
they
could
be
deal
with
in
section
5
and
section
6
.
where
debt
be
be
collect
,
it
should
be
collect
where
there
be
a
assignment
of
wage
.
this
be
refer
to
in
the
Bill
.
there
must
be
safeguard
to
prevent
a
assignment
of
wage
from
adversely
affect
the
debtor
's
ability
to
maintain
a
basic
standard
of
live
for
themselves
and
they
family
.
in
particular
,
the
level
of
a
assignment
should
not
undermine
the
debtor
's
access
to
the
basic
such
as
food
,
clothing
,
housing
and
basic
utility
,
so
there
be
a
social
inclusion
component
build
into
the
Bill
in
order
for
people
to
have
they
basic
rights
.
there
also
need
to
be
more
regulation
of
the
cost
of
debt
collection
in
order
to
protect
the
debtor
and
he
or
she
family
.
there
be
often
penalty
charge
for
late
payment
build
into
debt
,
and
the
interest
payment
on
that
alone
be
significant
and
sometimes
can
be
a
multiple
of
the
original
debt
.
that
be
something
that
should
be
examine
.
in
welcoming
the
Bill
,
we
also
need
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
be
a
basic
EU
model
.
deputy
Rabbitte
state
last
night
that
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
regulatory
framework
for
debt
collector
across
the
EU
.
my
research
tell
I
that
there
be
no
such
framework
but
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
.
we
need
to
have
some
kind
of
overarching
regulation
of
debt
collection
,
so
that
every
citizen
know
he
or
she
rights
and
entitlement
.
there
should
be
a
effective
right
of
redress
in
the
Bill
for
the
debtor
in
respect
of
harassment
,
excess
debt
recovery
cost
and
the
wrongful
removal
of
goods
.
if
a
regulator
be
empower
to
look
at
this
issue
,
there
should
be
some
framework
to
give
a
right
of
redress
to
the
debtor
.
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
most
unregulated
debt
,
it
be
very
often
at
the
hand
of
moneylender
.
it
remain
a
difficulty
as
to
how
we
can
regulate
moneylender
who
operate
in
the
black
market
,
but
for
that
who
be
incorporate
and
be
collect
debt
,
then
harassment
issue
should
allow
for
a
certain
right
of
redress
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
where
action
be
prove
to
be
excessive
.
the
default
consumer
should
have
a
statutory
right
to
be
advise
on
who
be
authorise
to
collect
the
debt
so
that
there
be
complete
transparency
in
the
process
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
use
of
multiple
debt
collection
agency
to
collect
debt
simultaneously
should
be
prohibit
.
we
deal
with
the
Fines
Bill
last
week
in
the
House
.
we
be
witness
a
sea
change
in
government
thinking
,
so
that
we
be
try
to
keep
people
out
of
prison
and
facilitate
they
by
allow
for
payment
of
fine
by
instalment
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
it
could
be
argue
that
a
similar
type
of
facility
should
exist
for
people
who
find
themselves
in
debt
;
they
should
not
be
subject
to
the
same
offence
.
we
have
have
report
from
Horwath
,
Wrixon
,
Teamwork
and
Professor
John
Higgins
and
today
's
Irish
Examiner
claim
that
all
acute
service
other
than
that
provide
at
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
will
be
do
away
with
.
subsequently
,
a
HSE
press
release
state
that
Kerry
General
Hospital
will
be
exclude
from
the
process
.
what
will
be
the
position
of
acute
service
in
hospital
other
than
Kerry
General
Hospital
and
CUH
from
9
June
?
the
people
of
the
region
have
be
through
the
mill
,
give
the
obfuscation
on
simple
question
on
the
future
location
of
acute
service
for
the
countless
thousand
serve
by
hospital
in
,
for
example
,
Mallow
,
Bantry
and
Cork
.
we
want
a
little
bit
of
decency
and
for
people
to
tell
we
they
intention
with
regard
to
acute
service
.
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
efficient
and
at
the
top
of
its
league
in
term
of
cleanliness
and
the
other
hiqa
statistic
.
it
need
its
acute
service
,
give
its
catchment
area
of
more
than
150000
people
.
on
a
point
of
order
—
—
we
be
tell
it
be
9
June
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
state
it
be
mid
June
.
I
would
like
to
seek
a
clarification
on
that
.
there
be
no
area
value
set
down
in
primary
or
secondary
legislation
or
on
a
administrative
basis
for
minimum
classroom
size
.
however

,
the

of

have
be
notify

this
regard
.
the
decision
of
the
appeal
Board
be
final
.
will
the
government
admit
the
existence
of
a
political
,
social
and
economic
morass
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lie
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
?
the
culture
create
and
nurture
over
the
past
ten
year
have
do
much
damage
to
this
country
's
reputation
abroad
and
have
create
a
cynicism
about
politics
and
the
political
class
.
it
will
take
year
for
any
restoration
of
the
notion
of
public
service
or
for
the
notion
that
democracy
be
fundamentally
good
and
should
be
cherish
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
the
rating
agency
,
Standard
&
Poor's
,
have
change
we
designation
from
aa
+
to
aa
.
one
may
have
certain
view
on
the
nature
of
rating
agency
and
they
methodology
,
but
that
rating
send
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
Ireland
be
not
a
place
in
which
to
do
business
or
in
which
to
invest
,
but
a
country
where
the
political
and
economic
circumstance
be
such
that
inherent
or
structural
economic
flaw
mean
it
be
not
conducive
to
investment
.
the
reason
for
this
be
that
the
political
and
economic
situation
be
currently
so
negative
that
nobody
want
to
touch
the
country
with
a
barge
pole
.
until
there
be
a
change
of
the
guard
and
the
political
regime
,
we
cannot
hope
to
restore
some
semblance
of
confidence
,
internationally
,
economically
and
politically
.
that
be
the
reason
the
Labour
Party
support
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
government
.
will
the
government
admit
that
over
the
past
decade
the
economy
be
build
on
a
false
edifice
that
have
now
come
tumble
down
like
a
ton
of
brick
?
the
architect
of
this
false
edifice
be
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
.
Ireland
need
to
recover
economically
and
to
recover
faith
in
the
political
system
.
the
people
cast
they
vote
in
the
local
and
European
election
to
send
a
message
to
Fianna
Fáil
that
its
regime
and
day
be
number
.
the
people
have
register
they
disgust
with
the
government
not
only
because
they
feel
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
model
of
governance
have
fail
we
,
but
because
they
now
want
a
change
of
the
guard
.
they
want
to
see
a
restoration
of
a
model
of
governance
that
be
base
on
the
fundamental
principle
of
service
to
all
of
the
people
,
not
just
the
few
.
it
will
take
a
new
political
reality
to
restore
the
notion
of
public
service
.
the
past
ten
year
have
see
the
unhinging
of
economics
from
society
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
,
sum
it
up
when
he
say
the
public
have
be
reduce
to
the
level
of
spectator
as
the
economy
be
analyse
as
something
separate
from
society
.
it
will
take
a
new
,
centre
of
left
government
to
have
a
new
discourse
and
make
thing
different
.
that
be
the
reason
we
support
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
government
.
we
seek
change
and
to
inject
a
new
positivism
into
the
political
sphere
.
the
government
will
,
probably
,
defeat
we
with
its
motion
,
but
it
be
vital
that
we
in
opposition
lay
down
a
marker
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
vote
in
recent
day
to
get
the
government
out
.
it
be
right
that
that
people
have
they
voice
echo
by
we
on
this
motion
.
the
Labour
Party
leader
,
deputy
Eamon
Gilmore
,
state
yesterday
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
allow
we
economy
to
become
so
reliant
on
the
construction
sector
that
in
2006
one
in
every
four
man
in
the
labour
force
be
work
in
it
.
now
,
almost
one
in
eight
people
in
we
labour
force
be
on
the
dole
,
a
massive
rise
in
unemployment
which
have
ripple
out
of
the
collapse
construction
sector
.
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
at
well
turn
a
blind
eye
,
while
the
bank
and
big
developer
grow
the
property
bubble
to
burst
point
.
the
people
have
pay
for
this
type
of
cynical
politics
.
they
will
no
long
continue
down
this
path
.
they
be
sick
of
the
current
regime
.
it
be
a
ail
and
fail
regime
and
we
must
restore
a
proper
one
.
by
they
action
this
past
weekend
,
the
people
have
send
a
message
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
way
be
no
long
the
way
to
run
a
country
.
that
way
be
no
long
tenable
and
we
can
no
long
afford
it
.
Fianna
Fáil
have
move
to
a
situation
where
it
have
almost
bankrupt
the
country
.
it
can
no
long
be
trust
on
the
economy
.
it
have
not
get
a
clue
.
with
some
€
64
billion
in
deposit
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
,
the
Irish
taxpayer
,
not
the
government
,
be
now
the
lender
of
last
resort
.
that
be
the
regime
create
by
Fianna
Fáil
,
but
it
have
no
shame
about
it
.
it
come
out
day
in
and
out
and
defend
its
position
.
that
in
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
will
no
long
take
responsibility
for
they
action
.
they
will
not
confess
to
the
fact
that
they
could
not
run
the
economy
properly
and
have
run
it
into
the
ground
.
that
have
always
be
the
Fianna
Fáil
way
.
they
be
interested
in
power
for
the
sake
of
power
and
not
in
public
service
or
the
people
.
we
want
a
changing
of
the
guard
so
that
we
can
inject
positivity
into
politics
once
more
,
restore
some
degree
of
what
it
mean
to
be
a
public
servant
and
walk
through
this
hall
with
pride
,
know
the
people
outside
know
we
be
do
something
good
and
perform
a
public
service
.
they
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
.
as
the
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
(
NCSE

,
through

official
in
my

have

and
I

the

the

in
light
of
the
publication
of
the
Teamwork
Horwath
report
yesterday
on
the
reconfiguration
of
hospital
service
in
the
HSE
south
,
will
the
Taoiseach
make
time
available
in
the
House
to
debate
the
issue
?
it
should
be
debate
on
the
basis
of
the
permutation
of
the
report
for
satellite
hospital
such
as
Mallow
and
Bantry
.
I
be
sure
my
colleague
,
deputy
Healy
-
Rae
,
will
back
I
up
on
this
call
.
the
school
recently
confirm
to
the
Department
that
it
be
unlikely
to
reach
the
enrolment
level
envisage
when
they
make
the
original
application
for
additional
temporary
accommodation
.
the
related
issue
of
the
replacement
of
play
area
that
would
have
be
occupy
by
that
additional
temporary
accommodation
will
not
now
arise
.
the
Department
be
continue
to
work
with
the
school
authority
with
regard
to
its
accommodation
requirement
.

the
Department
be
continue
to
work
with
the
school
authority
with
regard
to
its
accommodation
requirement
.
it
be
vital
that
we
view
this
legislation
in
the
context
of
directive
2009
/
14
/
EC
.
the
change
incorporate
within
this
directive
form
the
basis
of
the
Bill
before
we
.
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
to
mitigate
risk
,
the
risk
face
by
small
depositor
or
work
people
who
rely
heavily
on
the
banking
system
to
assist
they
in
they
daily
life
.
it
be
vital
at
this
time
that
we
insure
depositor
against
a
run
on
a
bank
or
financial
institution
.
therefore
,
the
provision
within
the
Bill
that
increase
the
statutory
limit
from
€
20000
to
€
100000
be
to
be
welcome
and
necessary
,
give
that
a
vast
number
of
depositor
within
a
certain
age
bracket
who
have
contribute
to
the
economy
throughout
they
work
life
would
have
deposit
within
this
range
.
the
fact
that
the
guarantee
scheme
be
to
be
extend
to
include
the
credit
union
be
also
to
be
welcome
.
however
,
I
too
have
question
about
the
credit
union
movement
because
the
minister
state
the
current
level
of
contribution
be
set
at
0.2
%
of
the
prescribe
deposit
base
.
he
go
on
to
say
there
would
be
further
discussion
with
the
credit
union
movement
as
regards
admission
to
the
scheme
from
a
administrative
perspective
.
will
the
minister
,
please
,
tell
the
House
what
the
nature
of
the
discussion
with
the
credit
union
movement
have
be
so
far
?
will
he
inform
we
how
this
will
pan
out
in
practical
term
for
the
credit
union
movement
?
because
of
the
disparate
nature
of
credit
union
,
some
practical
difficulty
will
emerge
and
I
be
sure
they
have
question
about
the
Bill
which
they
will
expect
we
,
as
legislator
,
to
reflect
.
it
be
easy
to
forget
,
too
,
that
a
considerable
amount
of
money
be
hold
within
credit
union
.
it
would
not
be
equitable
,
therefore
,
to
exclude
they
from
the
ambit
of
the
Bill
.
the
current
economic
environment
be
uncertain
.
thankfully
,
thus
far
we
have
not
see
a
stampede
by
ordinary
depositor
to
extract
they
savings
from
financial
institution
.
we
must
guard
against
this
possibility
as
the
last
thing
the
State
need
be
a
run
on
the
banking
system
.
it
be
vital
,
therefore
,
that
a
measure
of
guarantee
be
provide
by
the
State
so
as
to
ensure
ordinary
people
who
be
normally
casualty
in
any
downturn
do
not
stop
put
money
into
the
bank
.
by
increase
the
deposit
protection
limit
from
€
20000
to
€
100000
we
be
at
least
ensure
individual
savings
will
not
be
split
disproportionately
between
a
wide
range
of
institution
.
liquidity
must
be
preserve
within
the
system
.
the
only
way
to
do
this
be
to
ensure
there
be
sufficient
money
on
deposit
.
on
the
matter
of
moral
hazard
,
the
movement
of
responsibility
for
this
area
from
the
Financial
Regulator
to
the
Central
Bank
have
to
be
explain
in
great
detail
.
I
have
certain
reservation
about
the
role
of
the
Central
Bank
in
the
last
12
month
in
oversee
the
banking
crisis
.
I
remain
to
be
convince
that
its
warning
,
issue
in
quarterly
report
,
be
adequately
articulate
.
perhaps
it
be
the
case
that
it
be
just
not
be
listen
to
,
or
perhaps
it
be
not
shouting
loudly
enough
about
what
be
go
on
.
some
,
more
cynically
minded
,
might
suggest
there
be
a
air
of
complicity
in
term
of
what
be
happen
throughout
the
economy
for
a
number
of
year
.
the
Central
Bank
,
with
the
Financial
Regulator
,
have
be
diminish
in
its
role
in
oversee
the
banking
structure
.
however
,
I
be
hopeful
the
minister
will
ensure
they
role
in
the
future
will
involve
vigorous
policing
of
the
scheme
once
it
come
into
being
.
I
refer
to
the
take
into
public
ownership
of
Eircom
.
it
be
report
in
the
newspaper
at
the
weekend
that
yet
another
private
equity
firm
,
Permira
,
have
express
a
interest
in
take
over
Eircom
.
the
other
be
CVC
Capital
Partners
Limited
and
STT
.
the
ask
price
for
Eircom
be
approximately
€
100
million
but
the
debt
mountain
be
in
the
region
of
€
3.8
billion
.
if
a
private
equity
firm
take
over
Eircom
lock
,
stock
and
barrel
,
I
be
not
convinced
we
will
see
a
increase
rate
of
broadband
penetration
in
this
country
.
I
be
not
convinced
this
would
be
the
most
effective
way
of
ensure
the
broadband
provision
and
capacity
require
in
order
to
make
this
country
competitive
with
regard
to
rate
available
in
Japan
.
a
private
equity
firm
will
not
ensure
the
rate
of
penetration
will
allow
we
to
compete
with
other
country
.
they
would
concentrate
on
the
most
profitable
area
and
would
not
ensure
the
rural
economy
or
society
would
be
serve
in
such
a
scenario
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
take
Eircom
into
public
ownership
to
ensure
there
be
another
suitable
platform
for
investment
in
broadband
.
if
we
be
to
bail
out
bank
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
will
not
enter
the
fray
and
take
Eircom
in
charge
to
ensure
all
rural
exchange
that
need
to
be
upgrade
be
upgrade
.
there
would
be
a
multiplier
effect
and
a
positive
net
benefit
to
the
rural
economy
.
it
would
ensure
some
income
be
derive
from
other
user
through
the
unbundling
of
the
local
loop
.
it
be
important
to
debate
this
.
it
be
not
right
to
hand
it
over
to
private
equity
firm
.
the
current
taxation
regime
have
include
increase
to
taxation
and
some
will
argue
they
be
necessary
.
as
a
short
,
sharp
solution
we
be
increase
taxation
on
income
and
that
be
also
stifling
the
economy
because
people
be
not
spend
.
be
we
not
concentrate
on
ensure
great
efficiency
in
public
expenditure
?
today
I
receive
the
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
on
the
amount
spend
by
the
HSE
on
legal
fee
between
2006
and
2009
,
inclusive
.
the
response
be
that
,
between
barrister
and
solicitor
bill
,
approximately
€
8.6
million
have
be
spend
in
legal
fee
by
the
HSE
to
date
.
the
reason
I
be
prompt
to
put
down
the
question
be
because
of
a
young
couple
who
have
to
send
a
child
to
hospital
and
think
they
be
cover
under
private
health
insurance
.
it
transpire
that
they
be
not
cover
and
they
be
pursue
vigorously
for
€
5000
.
I
would
hazard
a
guess
that
it
probably
cost
the
State
a
multiple
of
that
€
5000
to
pursue
the
family
for
that
cost
.
the
point
be
that
there
must
be
a
great
analysis
of
how
we
can
achieve
great
savings
without
adversely
affect
people
on
low
income
.
it
can
be
achieve
with
a
little
lateral
thinking
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
280
to
282
,
inclusive
,
together
.
the
number
of
school
project
at
each
respective
stage
of

planning
in
June
2008
and
June
2009
and
they
allocate
band
rating
be
contain

.
in
the
time
available
to
answer
this
question
it
be
not
possible
to
compile
and
verify
similar
information
for
June
2007
.
the
proportion
of
the
2009
capital
allocation
which
will
be
expend
on
band
one
project
in
2009
will
depend
on
the
progress
of

and
the

do
the

accept
that

make

that

the

make
about

I
welcome

will

examine
the
relationship
between
producer
,

the
co-operative
movement
?
it
seem
to
I
that
the
relationship
be
unbalanced
—
it
be
not
base

equity
.
perhaps
the
minister
and
he
colleague
,
the
Tánaiste
and
Minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
,
should
consider
introduce
legislation
on
fair
trade
practice
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
multiple
act
fairly
when
they
designate
a
price
to
the
primary
producer
,
especially
as
the
primary
producer
be
a
price
taker
.
I
respectfully
suggest
that
this
be
not
necessarily
a
short
-
term
blip
.
this
be
potentially
a
structural
change
in
the
market
.
nobody
,
up
to
the
EU
Agriculture
and
rural
Development
Commissioner
herself
,
can
foresee
what
will
happen
in
the
market
in

will
the

consider
other
means
of
ensure
that
primary
producer
of
all
hue
be
guarantee
some
kind
of
fair
market
price
for
they
produce
in
the
retail
multiple
sector
?
I
refer
to
the
introduction
of
fair
trade
legislation
,
for
example
,
or
the
appointment
of
a
retail
regulator
.
such
measure
should
be
introduce
as

a
package
that
include
the
market
mechanism
be
implement
by
the
commission
.
without
mean
to
sound
facetious
,
the
Minister

could
have
deal
with
this
point
when
answer
question
no.

,
this

I
thank
the
Leas

Cheann

I
be
at

understand
some
of
the
arcane
practice

house

I
take
you
point
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
the
Commissioner
have
outline
a
number
of
point
which
be
aspirational
and
laudable
in
they
own
way
.
for
Irish
agribusiness
to
flourish
there
need
to
be
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
position
vis-à
-
vis
the
retailer
and
the
primary
producer
and
processor
.
this
have
be
already
outline
in
great
detail
.
rather
than
wait
for
report
after
report
,
will
the
government
not
grab
the
bull
by
the
horn
,
take
the
initiative
and
implement
legislation
?
it
should
stop
wait
for
the
European
Union
's
guidance
on
every
matter
relate
to
the
agribusiness
sector
in
this
economy
.
we
have
a
very
viable
market
,
with
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sargent
,
at
the
forefront
give
that
he
have
responsibility
for
food
.
we
need
to
see
action
now
and
that
relationship
need
to
be
reinstate
.
this
House
have
the
power
to
implement
its
own
rule
and
regulation
vis
-à
-
vis
the
relationship
,
as
it
do
not
contravene
EU
rule
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
act
urgently
to
reinstate
that
relationship
.
the
model
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
aspire
be
the
French
model
whereby
one
go
to
the
Carrefour
for
one
's
large
cheap
product
and
to
the
boulangerie
for
one
's
baguette
and
so
on
.
the
problem
with
the
Irish
model
be
that
there
be
absolutely
no
transparency
vis-á
-
vis
profit
.
a
lack
of
transparency
vis-á
-
vis
the
profit
of
the
large
multiple
affect
the
relationship
between
the
product
,
primary
supplier
and
the
retailer
,
thus
allow
situation
as
that
describe
by
the
Minister
of
State
.
until
we
get
that
transparency
we
will
not
get
a
good
deal
for
the
primary
producer
result
in
a
loss
of
job
in
this
economy
.
we
be
already
see
this
in
the
Border
county

member
be
aware
of
what
happen
with
Tesco
.
I
beg
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
,
but
a
ombudsman
will
not
be
enough
to
rectify
the
problem
.
this
will
require
a
legislative
framework
such
as
fair
trade
legislation
.
that
be
the
only
way
we
will
be
able
to
guarantee
job

small
producer

degree
of
livelihood

in
yesterday
's
edition
of
the
Irish
Examiner
,
the
Limerick
State
solicitor
welcome
the
provision
of
the
criminal
justice
(
amendment
)
Bill
but
say
that
it
would
face
difficulty
.
when
ask
whether
the
new
law
represent
a
good
day
's
work
,
he
reply
:
it
remain
to
be
see
,
but
it
be
a
attempt
to
address
a
very
serious
problem
.
and
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
challenge
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
there
will
be
difficulty
ahead
for
this
legislation
.
but
something
have
...
to
be
do
and
we
just
can't
roll
over
and
let
this
people
take
over
we
city
and
we
country
.
he
go
on
to
state
"
the
contract
be
be
rewritten
by
the
State
on
its
term
,
and
I
think
rightly
so
"
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
sentiment
express
by
the
State
solicitor
and
everyone
want
this
matter
to
be
deal
with
.
the
Labour
Party
differ
on
this
legislation
,
not
on
the
sentiment
regard
the
need
to
tackle
organised
crime
,
but
on
whether
the
proposal
before
the
House
present
a
solution
to
get
society
out
of
the
morass
in
which
it
find
itself
.
one
's
natural
instinct
be
to
ensure
that
every
innocent
victim
will
get
justice
.
one
's
human
instinct
be
that
the
only
way
to
handle
this
criminal
be
with
a
short
,
sharp
shock
.
the
question
remain
,
however
,
of
whether
the
proposal
before
we
will
result
in
a
crack
down
on
organised
crime
or
in
legal
challenge
to
the
legislation
on
a
number
of
front
.
that
question
be
not
ideological
,
it
be
practical
.
will
this
legislation
assist
in
the
pursuit
of
criminal
in
Limerick
and
west
Dublin
or
will
it
be
challenge
by
they
legal
representative
at
every
turn
?
be
we
make
good
law
or
law
that
will
be
challenge
due
to
loophole
?
in
the
criminal
Justice
Act
2006
,
there
be
already
a
considerable
body
of
law
that
should
adequately
deal
with
organised
crime
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
government
be
hell
-
bend
on
swamp
we
with
more
law
,
common
sense
must
prevail
.
we
all
want
to
see
this
criminal
behind
bar
,
and
no
one
in
this
House
would
advocate
a
soft
approach
that
would
not
see
the
blight
of
organised
criminal
activity
wipe
out
once
and
for
all
,
but
we
differ
on
how
this
can
well
be
achieve
.
it
can
not
be
achieve
only
through
increase
legislation
,
the
dog
in
the
street
will
tell
the
minister
that
the
shortage
of
resource
for
the
gardaí
at
the
coalface
be
the
most
significant
impediment
to
progress
in
bring
criminal
to
trial
.
the
idea
that
we
apply
more
legislation
without
a
comprehensive
spend
on
overtime
,
surveillance
and
other
enable
mechanism
that
would
allow
gardaí
to
get
on
with
the
job
raise
serious
question
about
this
government
's
strategy
to
tackle
gangland
crime
.
if
common
sense
be
use
,
the
gardaí
would
have
all
of
the
necessary
intelligence
gathering
and
surveillance
mechanism
at
they
disposal
to
hinder
any
attempt
at
a
crime
.
the
fact
remain
that
the
cutting
of
overtime
for
gardaí
and
the
likelihood
that
there
will
be
a
massive
cull
of
more
experience
gardaí
near
the
end
of
they
tenure
due
to
the
possible
taxation
of
pension
lump
sum
will
further
exacerbate
the
situation
.
we
can
have
all
the
law
we
want
but
if
the
experience
do
not
exist
in
the
Garda
Síochána
to
break
down
this
criminal
element
,
it
be
all
for
nothing
.
law
such
as
that
propose
today
will
matter
not
one
jot
if
the
resource
to
match
be
not
in
place
.
the
first
thing
that
strike
I
be
that
there
have
be
very
little
change
to
the
definition
of
a
criminal
organisation
from
the
2006
act
except
to
include
a
requirement
that
two
of
the
gang
can
be
involve
with
a
view
to
act
in
concert
in
the
commission
of
a
offence
.
have
anyone
be
convict
under
section
72
of
the
2006
act
that
make
it
a
offence
for
a
person
to
participate
in
or
contribute
to
any
activity
of
such
a
organisation
?
it
be
a
distraction
to
introduce
a
new
offence
under
section
71
(
a
)
of
direct
the
activity
of
a
criminal
organisation
if
it
have
not
be
possible
to
prove
that
a
person
be
a
member
of
a
gang
.
to
introduce
a
provision
to
establish
the
requisite
intent
be
a
gimmick
.
the
new
section
72
(
6
)
provide
that
it
shall
be
presume
,
until
the
contrary
be
show
,
that
participation
or
contribution
be
make
with
the
requisite
state
of
mind
if
the
circumstance
under
which
the
relevant
act
be
commit
involve
the
possession
by
the
defendant
in
the
presence
of
one
or
more
other
person
of
a
balaclava
,
boiler
suit
or
other
means
of
disguise
.
I
hope
the
plumber
and
handyman
of
the
country
know
that
wear
a
boiler
suit
be
now
proof
of
requisite
criminal
intent
of
membership
of
a
criminal
organisation
.
the
minister
have
argue
this
legislation
be
necessary
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
.
instead
,
by
introduce
a
system
whereby
instead
of
seek
out
evidence
and
put
it
before
a
jury
,
a
garda
's
opinion
will
suffice
to
convict
and
this
can
be
do
before
a
court
sit
without
a
jury
.
grant
,
this
be
not
the
first
time
the
opinion
of
a
garda
have
be
use
to
replace
the
obligation
to
obtain
evidence
and
allow
a
court
to
decide
on
guilt
,
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1972
provide
that
in
prosecution
for
membership
of
a
paramilitary
organisation
,
the
evidence
of
a
chief
superintendent
as
to
that
membership
could
be
admissible
.
at
least
the
fact
that
only
a
very
senior
garda
could
give
such
evidence
give
a
indication
of
the
seriousness
of
the
matter
.
now
,
however
,
a
prosecution
can
rest
on
the
opinion
of
any
garda
who
have
the
appropriate
expertise
.
this
be
a
meaningless
criterion
because
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
a
court
refuse
to
hear
the
opinion
evidence
of
a
train
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
do
not
know
enough
about
gang
.
the
garda
's
opinion
can
be
base
on
the
fact
that
the
individual
in
question
have
previous
conviction
.
again
,
the
minister
have
already
ask
we
to
support
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
,
which
will
allow
gardaí
to
plant
listening
device
where
there
be
a
suspicion
of
any
arrestable
offence
.
I
have
no
issue
with
this
.
the
state
purpose
of
that
legislation
be
to
obtain
evidence
with
which
to
pursue
gangland
crime
but
now
we
find
we
be
not
even
go
to
rely
on
such
evidence
and
instead
all
we
will
require
be
the
opinion
of
a
garda
.
the
minister
state
that
such
evidence
will
not
go
to
the
guilt
of
the
person
in
question
but
there
must
be
a
further
clarification
on
that
point
.
section
71
onwards
deal
with
the
special
criminal
Court
,
the
main
issue
here
.
if
the
perceive
problem
be
that
witness
be
afraid
to
give
evidence
,
and
we
distinguish
between
witness
and
that
who
be
member
of
a
jury
,
surely
the
minister
should
be
look
at
great
support
for
witness
?
any
Bill
that
state
that
"
it
be
hereby
declare
that
the
ordinary
court
be
inadequate
to
secure
the
effective
administration
of
justice
and
the
preservation
of
public
peace
and
order
in
relation
to
a
offence
under
each
of
the
follow
provision
"
convey
the
impression
that
the
current
legal
remedy
be
inadequate
and
must
be
overhaul
.
be
we
in
a
de
facto
state
of
emergency
?
the
minister
in
this
legislation
expressly
state
that
the
ordinary
court
be
inadequate
to
deal
with
criminal
organisation
.
that
be
a
serious
contention
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
common
law
system
and
must
be
further
analyse
.
no
evidence
have
be
present
to
demonstrate
why
the
current
operation
of
the
court
be
inadequate
.
the
provision
in
section
8
amend
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1939
to
allow
certain
offence
to
be
try
at
the
non-jury
special
criminal
Court
,
include
the
offence
of
direct
a
criminal
organisation
,
participation
in
or
contribution
to
certain
activity
,
and
the
commission
of
a
offence
for
a
criminal
organisation
.
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
special
criminal
Court
in
that
context
and
its
power
have
be
extend
in
this
regard
.
the
protection
of
jury
member
and
witness
have
be
suggest
as
the
reason
for
extend
the
remit
of
the
special
criminal
Court
.
however
,
as
recently
as
last
month
,
speak
at
the
annual
prosecutor
's
conference
,
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
raise
a
important
point
about
the
participation
of
the
ordinary
citizen
in
the
criminal
justice
system
through
service
on
jury
.
this
,
he
say
,
"
import
a
degree
of
democratic
legitimacy
into
the
system
"
.
this
be
a
point
that
be
worth
bear
in
mind
.
one
can
infer
from
this
statement
that
it
be
in
question
whether
the
reality
of
the
dpp
refer
a
case
to
the
special
criminal
Court
will
actually
play
out
,
give
the
potential
doubt
as
to
whether
this
legislation
will
stand
on
its
own
two
foot
and
withstand
any
legal
challenge
down
the
line
.
the
issue
of
witness
intimidation
will
not
be
solve
simply
by
the
use
of
the
special
criminal
Court
,
as
witness
will
still
need
to
give
evidence
in
court
.
the
common
sense
point
of
view
be
that
witness
protection
should
be
deal
with
by
instigate
measure
design
to
protect
witness
's
identity
,
if
necessary
,
in
addition
to
Garda
protection
operation
.
this
be
a
more
rational
approach
.
the
decision
on
whether
to
prosecute
a
case
in
the
special
criminal
Court
come
down
to
one
law
officer
,
the
dpp
.
the
existence
of
total
discretion
on
he
or
she
part
as
to
whether
to
prosecute
and
to
prosecute
in
the
special
criminal
Court
or
otherwise
be
a
significant
power
and
must
be
exercise
with
great
caution
.
perhaps
the
Bill
could
be
amend
to
put
this
power
on
a
statutory
footing
.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
approach
.
could
we
not
instead
enact
a
provision
within
that
section
along
the
line
of
the
UK
practice
whereby
the
prosecution
may
apply
for
a
non-jury
trial
in
case
in
which
it
can
show
evidence
of
a
real
danger
of
jury
tampering
?
this
would
ensure
a
robust
response
where
there
be
proof
of
jury
tampering
.
the
question
for
this
legislature
be
whether
the
provision
be
a
new
departure
from
the
norm
compare
to
other
common
law
jurisdiction
.
at
what
point
should
we
depart
from
a
principle
enshrine
in
we
constitution
for
the
pursuance
of
a
goal
that
can
be
achieve
by
means
other
than
fundamentally
change
the
basis
of
a
criminal
trial
,
namely
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
?
the
minister
should
think
long
and
hard
about
this
provision
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
provision
contain
within
exist
legislation
should
be
adequate
to
deal
with
the
fundamental
premise
of
this
Bill
;
namely
,
the
eradication
of
organised
crime
.
there
be
some
presumption
that
the
new
provision
be
base
on
the
threat
pose
by
criminal
gang
.
it
convey
a
impression
that
the
people
engage
in
such
criminal
activity
possess
a
malevolent
influence
that
be
beyond
the
power
of
normal
court
procedure
to
pursue
.
I
do
not
buy
into
this
.
it
presume
that
we
in
this
house
—
representative
of
the
people
—
no
long
have
the
confidence
to
curb
criminal
activity
within
the
normal
legal
parameter
and
must
embark
on
some
pretence
at
emergency
provision
to
placate
certain
viewpoint
.
we
have
develop
a
new
language
and
rhetoric
with
regard
to
organised
crime
and
it
need
to
be
deconstruct
.
this
people
be
mere
individual
.
they
do
not
live
in
location
that
be
beyond
the
power
of
surveillance
.
the
high
Chaparral
in
Limerick
be
not
a
remote
location
.
person
can
be
photograph
and
track
and
they
movement
can
be
trace
.
they
be
not
possess
of
special
power
and
the
exist
judicial
system
and
corpus
of
law
,
couple
with
the
provision
of
adequate
Garda
resource
,
should
be
robust
enough
to
bring
they
to
justice
.
I
wonder
whether
term
such
as
"
organised
crime
"
would
ever
have
creep
into
we
lexicon
and
would
need
to
be
legislate
for
if
the
State
have
provide
adequate
funding
for
Garda
operation
such
as
Anvil
,
which
allow
the
development
of
surveillance
and
checkpoint
and
act
as
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
criminal
.
the
ability
of
the
Garda
to
tackle
crime
be
severely
hamper
by
a
cut
in
Garda
overtime
from
approximately
€
120
million
last
year
to
€
80
million
this
year
.
a
total
of
€
21
million
have
be
set
aside
this
year
for
Operation
Anvil
,
yet
the
State
be
spend
approximately
€
12
million
on
policing
north
Mayo
.
do
the
minister
not
see
a
inherent
contradiction
in
he
own
policy
in
this
regard
?
I
doubt
if
one
extra
gangland
boss
or
minion
will
be
bring
to
justice
as
a
result
of
the
measure
contain
within
the
Bill
.
we
do
not
argue
against
any
provision
that
address
the
increase
level
of
violence
and
intimidation
direct
at
witness
and
jury
,
or
the
use
of
the
special
criminal
Court
for
the
hearing
of
particular
organised
crime
offence
,
but
I
would
like
to
see
some
proof
of
the
fact
that
jury
be
systematically
be
intimidate
.
do
it
really
happen
?
it
be
one
thing
to
suggest
that
witness
be
be
intimidate
,
but
the
suggestion
that
jury
be
be
systematically
intimidate
and
that
this
require
a
seismic
shift
away
from
trial
by
jury
should
not
be
entertain
without
further
analysis
.
that
a
country
of
this
size
,
which
be
not
densely
populate
,
must
resort
to
such
measure
suggest
that
the
successful
tackle
of
crime
should
be
predicate
on
the
application
of
resource
and
not
necessarily
on
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law
.
if
there
be
proof
beyond
doubt
that
jury
be
be
tamper
with
and
intimidate
,
there
be
protective
instrument
that
can
be
apply
which
be
practical
and
base
on
a
common
sense
approach
.
this
be
well
document
.
under
section
7
of
the
Bill
,
the
opinion
of
any
garda
who
appear
to
the
court
to
possess
the
appropriate
expertise
will
be
admissible
as
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
criminal
organisation
.
under
this
section
,
expertise
mean
experience
,
specialise
knowledge
or
qualification
.
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
draft
a
paper
prior
to
the
instigation
of
this
legislation
from
which
I
will
quote
.
I
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
all
the
view
espouse
by
the
various
civil
society
organisation
and
I
have
my
own
view
about
the
rule
of
law
.
however
,
there
be
certain
point
of
law
address
by
the
ICCL
which
should
be
read
into
the
record
.
it
point
out
that
the
opinion
of
the
garda
can
be
inform
by
the
existence
of
previous
conviction
of
the
accuse
.
the
Supreme
Court
have
consider
the
use
of
belief
evidence
and
its
compatibility
with
article
38
of
the
constitution
and
article
6
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
,
which
deal
with
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
.
while
a
garda
may
claim
privilege
as
to
he
or
she
source
when
be
cross-examine
about
belief
evidence
,
the
Supreme
Court
be
clear
that
a
conviction
cannot
take
place
without
supportive
or
corroborative
evidence
in
recognition
of
the
disadvantage
that
accrue
to
the
defence
in
a
trial
.
moreover
,
in
regard
to
the
rank
of
garda
who
be
entitle
to
provide
belief
evidence
,
the
court
have
state
that
the
relevant
provision
of
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1939
be
carefully
craft
to
ensure
belief
evidence
must
come
from
a
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
not
below
the
rank
of
chief
superintendent
.
this
,
the
Supreme
Court
state
,
be
with
a
view
to
establish
trust
and
credibility
as
far
as
possible
.
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
regard
to
the
provision
contain
within
this
Bill
.
the
UN
human
rights
committee
have
refer
to
decision
of
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
in
assign
case
to
the
court
not
be
make
public
.
to
confer
further
power
on
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
for
the
hearing
of
particular
organised
crime
offence
in
the
special
criminal
Court
on
the
basis
of
he
or
she
total
discretion
beg
the
question
as
to
whether
the
application
of
increase
Garda
resource
might
be
a
more
reasonable
solution
to
the
problem
which
would
negate
the
need
for
this
provision
.
on
the
matter
of
secret
detention
hearing
,
under
part
4
of
the
Bill
,
procedure
of
District
Court
detention
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
extend
the
detention
of
person
under
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
be
alter
.
one
legal
opinion
suggest
it
be
contrary
to
the
principle
of
fair
trial
that
the
Bill
allow
for
the
hearing
to
take
place
in
private
if
the
judge
consider
there
may
be
a
risk
of
prejudice
.
in
justify
this
,
it
be
claim
that
member
of
organised
criminal
gang
be
attend
the
detention
hearing
and
decipher
the
direction
of
the
investigation
from
the
evidence
give
in
court
.
however
,
this
provision
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
criminal
justice
in
this
State
,
allow
for
the
judge
to
hear
evidence
from
a
garda
of
any
rank
,
in
private
and
without
legal
representation
.
this
include
answer
to
question
and
a
cross-examination
without
either
the
defendant
,
he
or
she
legal
representative
or
the
prosecutor
present
.
in
essence
,
this
mean
a
person
can
be
hold
without
knowledge
of
the
grounds
on
which
the
judge
be
justify
he
or
she
continue
detention
.
that
detention
can
be
justify
by
secret
information
from
any
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
,
irrespective
of
he
or
she
expertise
or
experience
.
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we
be
convinced
of
the
necessity
for
such
provision
,
the
reality
be
that
any
criminal
lawyer
worth
he
or
she
salt
will
most
likely
be
able
to
identify
any
number
of
potential
loophole
and
,
thus
,
the
prospect
of
a
legal
challenge
.
we
must
also
look
at
we
obligation
under
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
even
where
we
be
seek
to
make
provision
for
heinous
crime
such
as
murder
,
we
obligation
under
the
convention
remain
clear
.
we
must
avoid
a
situation
where
a
person
detain
on
a
murder
charge
ultimately
walk
free
as
a
consequence
of
a
challenge
to
this
law
under
a
article
40
provision
.
it
do
not
matter
whether
or
not
we
be
in
favour
of
waive
article
40
rights
in
emergency
situation
.
my
point
be
that
we
must
avoid
make
bad
law
or
law
that
will
be
discover
by
a
good
criminal
lawyer
to
have
all
type
of
loophole
.
that
be
how
the
State
have
typically
deal
with
issue
relate
to
criminality
heretofore
.
criminal
lawyer
have
always
be
able
to
find
loophole
that
have
allow
people
to
walk
free
in
certain
circumstance
.
if
we
be
to
tackle
this
problem
once
and
for
all
,
we
must
make
robust
and
effective
law
that
will
not
be
subject
to
future
challenge
at
a
supranational
court
,
as
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
observe
.
we
intend
to
propose
several
amendment
to
the
Bill
on
Committee
stage
.
practical
change
can
be
make
that
will
not
alter
the
minister
's
modus
operandi
in
seek
to
tackle
organised
crime
.
in
particular
,
we
must
ensure
there
be
protection
for
witness
and
that
jury
tampering
do
not
take
place
.
I
understand
the
court
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
have
find
that
the
state
be
oblige
to
take
particular
step
to
protect
certain
vulnerable
category
of
people
such
as
witness
.
we
be
not
so
naive
as
to
suggest
there
be
a
onus
on
the
State
to
prevent
every
possibility
of
violence
,
but
where
individual
be
expose
to
threat
to
they
life
,
the
State
will
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
be
oblige
to
provide
police
protection
.
in
order
to
fulfil
this
obligation
,
we
must
ensure
effective
measure
be
take
to
thwart
attempt
to
trace
witness
and
collaborator
of
justice
by
criminal
organisation
.
several
procedure
can
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
jury
be
not
tamper
with
and
that
witness
be
afford
adequate
protection
.
this
must
be
bring
forward
as
practical
measure
in
line
with
the
implementation
of
this
legislation
.
any
procedural
rule
that
be
enact
to
protect
the
rights
of
witness
must
be
formulate
take
into
account
the
need
to
safeguard
the
criminal
trial
process
.
measure
which
could
be
make
available
to
assist
witness
include
anonymity
before
,
during
and
after
the
criminal
trial
.
however
,
this
should
be
a
exceptional
measure
and
should
be
set
down
in
law
so
that
procedure
be
available
for
the
defence
to
challenge
the
need
for
anonymity
.
a
cause
of
concern
in
the
criminal
justice
system
be
the
considerable
delay
in
court
proceedings
in
the
State
.
if
court
proceedings
could
be
expedite
in
a
timely
fashion
,
this
would
offset
the
risk
of
any
potential
tampering
with
jury
.
we
should
not
set
about
fundamentally
change
we
common
law
system
when
we
could
instead
tackle
criminal
with
robust
measure
through
adequately
fund
and
effective
policing
mechanism
.
while
we
agree
with
the
tenor
of
the
Bill
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
achieve
,
we
be
of
the
view
that
it
require
amendment
.
no
.
it
be
not
what
I
say
.
I
could
clarify
it
for
the
Minister
of
State
.
the
special
criminal
Court
can
be
use
under
the
exist
framework
.
how
will
witness
be
deal
with
in
the
special
criminal
Court
?
if
we
need
to
sit
every
day
of
July
and
right
through
the
summer
we
should
do
that
.
the
reality
be
that
the
minister
have
outline
a
timetable
.
I
wish
to
conclude
because
I
be
take
the
indulgence
of
the
chair
.
it
would
be
wrong
if
I
,
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
European
affair
,
do
not
make
a
few
comment
on
the
importance
of
Europe
to
we
and
where
we
be
.
in
12
or
13
week
we
will
face
another
referendum
.
it
be
more
critical
than
any
decision
we
make
in
any
previous
referendum
other
than
the
decision
the
people
make
to
jump
into
the
dark
and
join
the
European
economic
Community
in
1972
.
if
there
be
ever
a
time
when
Europe
need
to
be
strong
and
focus
,
this
be
that
time
.
the
world
face
remarkable
challenge
and
not
just
the
economic
challenge
or
global
warming
.
late
this
year
Europe
will
face
a
major
energy
crisis
.
we
need
a
strong
Europe
that
be
fit
for
purpose
.
the
only
people
in
Europe
of
the
500
million
citizen
that
can
make
Europe
strong
now
be
the
Irish
people
.
the
Irish
people
have
show
great
perspicacity
and
extraordinary
courage
in
the
past
in
take
decision
.
I
do
not
know
why
and
what
failure
on
we
part
encourage
the
people
to
be
timorous
on
12
June
2008
.
it
be
temerity
ally
to
considerable
misleading
propaganda
that
force
people
to
say
they
do
not
know
enough
about
Europe
.
we
have
a
combine
responsibility
.
we
all
make
mistake
during
the
last
referendum
campaign
.
there
be
snip
on
different
side
in
this
House
and
we
be
all
culpable
.
on
this
occasion
we
really
must
work
together
.
it
will
not
be
easy
to
get
it
over
the
line
and
it
should
not
be
take
for
grant
.
we
should
never
take
the
people
for
grant
.
a
honest
effort
to
address
the
concern
of
the
people
be
make
.
that
concern
be
really
well
recognise
by
a
committee
of
both
house
.
we
should
now
have
the
courage
to
lead
.
we
be
elect
not
just
to
be
follower
but
also
to
lead
and
to
make
certain
the
people
take
a
decision
that
be
inform
,
focus
and
right
.
they
will
do
that
by
voting
"
yes
"
.
I
will
say
goodnight
at
that
.
if
we
need
to
sit
every
day
of
July
and
right
through
the
summer
we
should
do
that
.
the

.
I
will
say
goodnight
at
that
.
I
already
make
a
contribution
to
the
debate
on
the
Bill
on
second
Stage
and
,
therefore
,
I
will
speak
specifically
to
section
3
.
the
minister
indicate
that
the
amend
definition
be
merely
a
simple
formulation
but
that
they
will
nonetheless
make
it
easy
to
charge
person
with
the
offence
in
question
.
the
Bill
do
not
substantially
change
the
definition
of
what
constitute
a
criminal
organisation
which
be
contain
in
the
2006
Act
.
if
it
be
never
deem
practicable
to
bring
the
2006
definition
into
play
and
if
no
conviction
be
secure
on
the
basis
of
it
,
we
must
ask
whether
conviction
can
be
secure
on
the
basis
of
that
which
be
contain
in
the
legislation
before
the
House
.
be
there
a
requirement
that
sufficient
evidence
to
be
provide
to
allow
a
judge
,
of
the
special
criminal
Court
or
any
other
court
,
to
decide
to
convict
someone
on
the
basis
of
he
or
she
membership
of
a
organisation
?
this
be
particularly
relevant
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
provision
in
the
2006
act
have
not
be
implement
.
further
consideration
must
be
give
to
this
matter
.
I
be
of
the
view
that
section
3
be
not
practical
.
it
be
so
vague
that
if
one
be
a
criminal
lawyer
of
some
standing
,
one
could
pick
hole
in
it
.
on
a
point
of
clarification
,
the
minister
have
state
that
the
evidence
of
a
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
with
the
appropriate
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
a
criminal
organisation
will
not
go
to
the
guilt
or
otherwise
of
the
defendant
.
be
that
not
a
point
of
law
that
be
already
well
establish
?
this
legislation
do
not
give
a
new
voice
to
it
because
it
be
a
establish
principle
.
what
do
"
sufficiently
positive
"
mean
?
the
minister
have
to
give
he
that
one
.
I
question
the
criterion
by
which
appropriate
expertise
can
be
define
.
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
a
court
refuse
to
hear
the
evidence
of
a
train
garda
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
do
not
know
enough
about
gang
.
I
be
prompt
to
raise
this
issue
in
response
to
call
to
my
office
and
to
deputy
Brian
O'Shea
's
office
with
regard
to
the
probable
cessation
of
the
rural
bus
service
between
Waterford
and
Cork
.
this
be
a
service
which
specifically
serve
the
town
of
Dungarvan
,
Cappoquin
,
Lismore
,
Curraglass
,
Ballynoe
,
Conna
,
Castlelyons
,
Fermoy
,
Castletownroche
,
Killavullen
and
Mallow
.
there
be
a
concern
that
if
the
mid-day
service
which
be
provide
by
Bus
Éireann
be
stop
,
because
in
the
company
's
word
it
be
deem
to
be
"
not
profitable
"
,
this
will
have
a
untold
consequence
for
that
people
who
be
old
,
who
do
not
have
they
own
transport
and
who
would
normally
use
this
service
to
access
general
day
to
day
service
such
as
medical
,
post
office
and
other
service
that
generally
keep
life
and
limb
together
.
I
be
concerned
because
if
it
be
the
case
that
Bus
Éireann
decide
to
terminate
this
service
,
then
in
the
current
economic
climate
,
there
be
no
guarantee
that
the
rural
transport
programme
would
be
sufficiently
fund
to
replace
the
route
and
provide
the
service
to
what
I
would
call
a
vulnerable
section
or
we
society
who
do
not
have
the
means
to
provide
they
own
transport
and
be
not
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
get
taxi
if
they
be
live
in
rural
area
to
the
town
I
have
mention
.
we
see
in
1967
that
the
railway
line
between
Mallow
and
Dungarvan
or
Cork
and
Waterford
through
Mallow
be
stop
and
it
be
replace
by
a
bus
service
.
I
be
argue
now
,
along
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
O'Shea
,
that
there
would
be
a
public
service
obligation
to
ensure
that
that
people
would
continue
to
be
serve
by
some
form
of
public
transport
and
ideally
through
the
auspices
of
Bus
Éireann
.
it
be
my
view
that
if
we
be
to
go
down
the
line
in
this
country
of
stop
route
which
be
deem
to
be
not
profitable
,
then
it
will
be
another
nail
in
the
coffin
for
rural
society
.
at
a
time
when
we
be
talk
about
the
sustainability
of
the
rural
economy
and
rural
society
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
would
ensure
that
Bus
Éireann
and
other
provider
would
continue
to
have
some
obligation
to
provide
service
,
particularly
during
the
week
when
it
be
predominantly
elderly
people
who
avail
of
this
service
.
it
be
not
only
so
that
they
can
go
into
town
to
purchase
grocery
but
it
be
also
a
form
of
social
interaction
for
they
they
may
not
otherwise
have
without
the
service
.
if
government
policy
be
one
that
assure
that
rural
transport
would
be
well
cater
for
,
particularly
in
more
isolated
area
,
and
if
it
be
the
case
that
government
policy
be
such
that
there
be
a
service
in
existence
,
I
call
on
the
minister
to
ensure
that
the
service
be
maintain
,
preferably
by
Bus
Éireann
,
but
if
not
,
that
the
minister
would
intervene
directly
with
Bus
Éireann
to
ensure
that
it
be
maintain
.
that
will
ensure
that
if
we
get
rid
of
the
railway
we
do
not
also
get
rid
of
the
rural
bus
route
.
person
use
this
service
and
it
be
vital
that
they
have
access
to
the
service
that
maintain
they
in
they
everyday
life
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
intervene
directly
with
Bus
Éireann
on
this
issue
and
ensure
we
maintain
that
service
and
other
such
service
that
be
be
threaten
.
Bus
Éireann
be
undergo
a
process
of
review
its
route
and
that
deem
to
be
not
profitable
could
cease
in
the
future
.
that
would
be
a
bad
day
for
rural
society
and
the
rural
economy
in
particular
.

we
look
forward
to
that
enlightenment
.
the
date
2
October
2009
will
be
a
seminal
moment
in
we
relationship
with
the
European
Union
.
if
we
pass
the
Lisbon
treaty
,
we
will
say
to
we
EU
neighbour
that
we
be
on
board
and
intend
to
proceed
in
partnership
with
they
.
by
pass
it
,
we
will
say
to
we
EU
partner
that
we
want
to
see
the
establishment
of
area
of
co-operation
or
share
competence
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
internal
market
,
energy
and
economic
and
social
cohesion
.
this
be
the
area
on
which
we
must
focus
if
we
be
to
be
assist
in
put
we
economy
back
together
and
get
people
back
to
work
.
without
this
area
of
co-operation
,
we
will
be
force
to
proceed
alone
.
we
cannot
afford
such
a
policy
.
we
rely
,
from
this
juncture
,
on
we
EU
partner
to
assist
we
in
get
back
on
track
.
this
provision
be
build
into
the
treaty
and
if
we
reject
it
for
a
second
time
,
any
assistance
to
be
garner
from
we
EU
partner
will
be
nullify
.
we
be
a
shrewd
people
and
have
build
we
country
on
the
management
of
relationship
,
either
socially
,
politically
or
from
a
business
perspective
.
adopt
the
treaty
will
assist
that
relationship
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
foreign
direct
investment
and
EU
research
programme
,
two
area
that
be
vital
to
we
economic
growth
and
which
be
encompass
by
the
treaty
.
I
hope
we
can
continue
to
play
a
qualitative
role
as
a
member
of
the
European
Union
in
this
regard
and
that
we
can
continue
what
have
be
a
long
and
fruitful
relationship
.
I
be
grateful
for
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
because
mine
be
the
generation
that
have
benefit
most
therefrom
.
membership
of
the
Union
and
protection
of
we
national
interest
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
in
spite
of
the
economic
constraint
upon
we
now
,
it
will
be
through
a
deepen
relationship
with
we
EU
partner
that
we
will
restore
we
economic
vitality
.
at
the
EU
foreign
Minister
meeting
hold
after
the
last
referendum
,
we
Minister
for
foreign
affair
speak
on
the
diverse
nature
of
the
Irish
debate
and
the
overlap
in
that
debate
between
issue
that
be
relevant
to
the
treaty
and
other
that
be
not
.
some
of
that
extraneous
issue
,
which
have
no
part
in
the
debate
on
treaty
revision
,
have
now
be
put
to
bed
.
the
guarantee
be
secure
and
we
should
acknowledge
that
.
we
national
interest
be
a
strong
Ireland
within
a
strong
European
Union
and
one
that
be
concerned
with
job
,
family
and
social
solidarity
.
the
Union
consist
of
27
country
and
490
million
people
and
I
make
no
apology
for
contend
we
should
be
part
of
a
integrated
union
that
challenge
the
hegemony
of
the
Unite
State
,
China
and
Russia
.
we
view
in
the
Labour
Party
have
be
always
temper
by
a
belief
in
social
solidarity
,
as
espouse
in
the
European
social
model
.
that
model
of
social
solidarity
have
come
under
attack
from
people
such
as
we
own
commissioner
.
that
who
argue
in
favour
of
the
retention
of
a
commissioner
should
ask
themselves
if
the
incumbent
Irish
Commissioner
have
act
in
the
good
interest
of
this
country
or
propagate
a
agenda
that
be
contrary
to
we
largely
social
democratic
principle
.
I
hope
we
next
commissioner
will
possess
the
egalitarian
Republican
ideal
once
espouse
by
the
Taoiseach
.
I
be
glad
to
note
we
have
retain
we
commissioner
nonetheless
.
the
EU
Commission
,
by
its
composition
,
have
shif
to
the
right
.
that
provide
clear
evidence
of
the
need
for
the
Union
to
reform
its
structure
.
the
primacy
of
inter-institutionalism
,
that
be
,
of
a
all
-
powerful
commission
,
must
be
challenge
.
I
be
not
espouse
intergovernmentalism
per
say
because
there
must
be
a
finely
tune
balance
between
the
two
.
the
treaty
provide
such
a
compromise
.
that
balance
,
as
contain
within
this
treaty
,
be
provide
for
by
extend
the
decision
-
make
power
of
the
European
Parliament
,
a
institution
that
reflect
the
wish
of
the
people
of
Europe
.
we
,
the
people
of
Europe
,
must
understand
that
the
model
underpin
the
working
of
the
European
Union
have
be
dominate
by
that
who
have
seek
to
de-regulate
every
aspect
of
we
life
,
especially
within
the
realm
of
public
service
or
service
of
general
interest
,
as
they
be
refer
to
in
the
treaty
.
I
be
glad
we
have
make
progress
on
that
matter
and
that
this
service
be
recognise
within
the
treaty
.
we
have
see
the
fruit
of
the
commission
's
labour
—
a
European
financial
structure
that
be
in
tatter
and
a
EU
economy
that
be
flounder
.
this
be
unsustainable
and
unbalanced
.
the
way
to
redress
the
imbalance
be
to
give
more
power
to
the
European
Parliament
.
this
will
shift
the
power
back
to
the
people
,
the
same
people
who
be
currently
unemployed
and
face
a
uncertain
future
and
who
be
rightly
suspicious
of
they
government
and
want
to
see
job
and
the
economy
put
to
the
forefront
of
the
political
agenda
.
the
European
Parliament
will
at
least
provide
a
counter
-
weight
that
will
be
more
reflective
of
the
wish
of
the
European
people
,
even
if
it
be
dominate
by
the
right
.
the
Parliament
,
by
its
nature
,
because
it
do
not
govern
unilaterally
,
be
close
to
the
people
and
will
reflect
they
concern
.
it
will
ensure
that
job
creation
throughout
Europe
remain
the
first
priority
.
that
be
provide
for
within
the
treaty
.
the
Lisbon
treaty
provide
that
the
"
ordinary
legislative
procedure
"
involve
co-decision
between
the
Council
of
Minister
and
the
European
Parliament
,
with
qualified
majority
voting
in
the
Council
of
Minister
.
this
mechanism
,
by
its
nature
,
increase
democratic
control
over
legislation
.
this
concept
,
however
,
be
not
debate
widely
because
there
be
still
a
serious
deficit
of
knowledge
among
legislator
and
the
public
as
to
the
general
power
of
the
European
Parliament
.
until
every
citizen
have
as
much
knowledge
of
how
the
Union
work
as
they
do
of
they
local
council
or
even
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
treaty
revision
will
be
dominate
by
issue
such
as
that
on
which
legal
guarantee
have
be
obtain
and
which
form
no
part
of
the
treaty
.
the
fact
remain
that
we
still
do
not
understand
how
the
whole
mechanism
work
.
before
I
be
accuse
of
patronise
anybody
,
I
must
state
every
single
person
to
whom
I
speak
prior
to
the
last
referendum
state
he
or
she
do
not
understand
the
treaty
or
how
it
work
.
that
be
a
fact
.
how
can
I
sell
this
treaty
to
anyone
if
the
majority
of
we
do
not
understand
qualified
majority
voting
or
co-decision
or
know
the
difference
between
a
directive
,
a
regulation
and
a
decision
?
we
must
inculcate
we
fellow
citizen
with
knowledge
of
the
working
of
the
institution
in
a
positive
way
.
this
must
start
in
every
school
and
from
a
young
age
.
until
such
time
as
this
be
achieve
,
there
always
will
be
opportunity
for
government
and
self
-
interested
group
to
take
advantage
of
people
's
lack
of
knowledge
.
there
be
still
a
dearth
of
knowledge
.
it
be
not
sufficient
for
the
government
to
suggest
it
have
deliver
the
goods
in
term
of
legal
guarantee
or
solemn
declaration
.
there
be
many
who
be
never
exercise
by
this
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
most
be
exercise
by
the
fact
that
they
do
not
know
what
be
in
the
treaty
.
there
be
many
who
be
never
exercise
by
this
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
we
,
in
this
house
,
be
to
blame
for
this
.
we
have
never
set
out
to
have
a
meaningful
educational
dialogue
with
we
fellow
citizen
on
the
fundamental
of
how
the
European
Union
work
.
that
be
partly
why
the
referendum
fall
the
last
time
.
it
could
do
so
again
unless
we
engage
in
a
meaningful
way
with
we
fellow
citizen
.
I
wish
to
assure
the
deputy
that
there
will
be
no
pupil
with
a
special
educational
need
who
will
be
without
access
to
a
special
need
teacher
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
apply
the
normal
rule
which
govern
the
appointment
and
retention
of
teacher
of
special
class
for
pupil
with
a
mild
general
learning
disability
.
all
primary
school
be
allocate
additional
teaching
resource
under
the
General
Allocation
Model
to
enable
they
support
pupil
with
high
incidence
special
educational
need
include
mild
general
learning
disability
(
MGLD
)
.
school
can
decide
how
good
to
use
this
allocation
base
on
the
need
of
the
pupil
.
most
pupil
with
a
mgld
be
include
in
ordinary
class
with
they
peer
and
be
support
by
they
class
teacher
.
the
curriculum
be
flexible
so
that
teacher
can
cater
for
the
need
of
child
of
different
ability
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
teacher
allocation
to
school
typically
increase
or
decrease
depend
on
pupil
enrolment
.
in
the
case
of
class
for
MGLD
the
normal
pupil
teacher
ratio
that
apply
be
11:1

I

to

that

have
,
and
will
continue
to

,
access

there

I

there
will
be
no
pupil
with

will
be

all

school
can
decide
how
good
to
use
this
allocation
base
on
the
need
of
the
pupil
.
most
pupil
with
a
mgld
be
include
in
ordinary

with
they
peer

the
curriculum
be
flexible
so
that
teacher
can
cater
for
the
need
of
child
of
different
ability
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
teacher
allocation
to
school
typically
increase
or
decrease
depend
on
pupil
enrolment
.
in
the
case
of
class
for
MGLD
the
normal
pupil
teacher
ratio
that
apply
be
11:1
.
my

however
permit
school
to
retain
a
teaching
post
where
it
have
a
minimum
of
9
pupil
in
the

I

to

that

it
be
not
right
that
we
should
guillotine
this

it
warrant
further
discussion
particularly
on
Committee
stage
and
it
warrant
further
consideration
by
expert
opinion
before
we
decide
its
finality
.
I
oppose
the
guillotine
of
the
Bill
.
the
legislation
be
base
on
a
challenge
to
section
6
of
the
Enforcement
of
Court
order
Act
1940
,
which
provide
that
where
a
debtor
have
a
instalment
plan
to
pay
a
debt
and
fail
to
discharge
that
obligation
,
the
creditor
may
apply
to
the
District
Court
for
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
the
debtor
.
the
Free
legal
Aid
Centre
,
FLAC
,
in
its
opinion
,
state
the
enforcement
of
court
order
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
confines
itself
to
remedy
the
constitutional
deficiency
identify
by
the
high
Court
in
the
McCann
case
and
this
be
the
most
fundamental
point
.
political
and
legal
argument
be
well
make
by
my
colleague
,
Senator
Alex
White
,
on
the
Bill
in
question
and
particular
reference
be
make
to
the
instigation
of
a
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
when
case
come
before
the
court
for
non-payment
of
debt
.
I
have
make
provision
for
this
argument
by
way
of
propose
amendment
to
the
Bill
to
reflect
that
view
.
we
should
also
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
have
indicate
that
the
Department
will
await
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
consultation
paper
on
debt
enforcement
before
take
any
further
action
in
this
area
.
will
the
minister
give
a
commitment
to
legislate
for
this
and
,
in
particular
,
that
aspect
of
the
Laffoy
judgment
on
attachment
of
earnings
?
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
report
will
be
most
welcome
but
if
it
do
not
give
voice
to
legislation
almost
immediately
then
I
suggest
the
inherent
problem
will
continue
.
I
acknowledge
FLAC
's
comment
in
that
regard
and
it
should
also
be
note
that
its
report
,
to
no
one
's
credit
,
publish
on
6
July
,
propose
a
wide
range
of
recommendation
for
change
in
this
area
.
the
FLAC
position
paper
state
:
"
this
be
welcome
change
to
the
exist
legislation
but
it
must
be
say
that
they
only
address
the
last
step
in
what
be
a
complex
and
less
than
user
friendly
procedure
that
take
place
in
open
court
and
be
in
need
of
comprehensive
reform
generally
.
"
the
report
point
out
that
while
the
Bill
contain
welcome
change
necessitate
by
the
McCann
judgment
,
it
do
not
go
far
enough
in
that
it
still
contemplate
imprisonment
as
a
sanction
for
debtor
.
although
it
will
improve
the
current
position
,
it
be
akin
to
place
a
stick
plaster
on
a
open
wound
,
namely
,
we
shameful
policy
of
continue
to
imprison
people
who
for
genuine
reason
cannot
pay
they
debt
as
oppose
to
refuse
to
do
so
.
we
must
make
the
distinction
between
that
who
cannot
and
that
who
simply
will
not
pay
they
debt
.
FLAC
suggest
that
the
State
move
towards
the
removal
of
imprisonment
as
a
option
in
debt
case
and
instead
employ
effective
non-penal
remedy
to
enforce
compliance
with
civil
debt
judgment
.
I
hope
the
Law
Reform
Commission
would
give
great
voice
to
this
aspiration
.
there
be
merit
to
this
argument
but
the
complete
removal
of
the
sanction
of
prison
be
not
a
vista
that
we
would
support
at
present
,
particularly
with
regard
to
family
law
matter
.
in
introduce
the
Bill
in
the
Seanad
,
the
Minister
of
State
say
:
the
high
Court
find
that
the
exist
legislation
lack
a
number
of
necessary
safeguard
in
circumstance
where
a
person
be
at
risk
of
imprisonment
.
the
judgment
state
that
,
while
this
process
have
traditionally
be
regard
as
a
civil
matter
,
its
effect
be
akin
to
a
criminal
one
and
the
debtor
be
entitle
to
similar
protection
.
there
be
particular
concern
that
the
1940
Act
do
not
appear
to
require
a
person
to
be
hear
by
a
court
before
be
imprison
.
follow
a
default
on
a
instalment
order
make
by
the
District
Court
,
a
creditor
could
apply
to
the
court
for
a
committal
order
and
even
in
the
case
of
the
non-appearance
of
a
debtor
,
committal
order
could
be
,
and
be
,
grant
by
the
District
Court
.
the
new
section
6
address
this
and
we
will
not
seek
to
amend
it
in
that
regard
.
I
believe
we
must
give
voice
to
the
McCann
judgment
and
deal
with
it
immediately
.
however
,
whether
the
legislation
deal
with
the
Laffoy
judgment
in
its
entirety
be
another
matter
.
in
the
debate
in
the
Seanad
,
my
colleague
rightly
ask
how
a
debtor
could
be
imprison
without
any
requirement
that
the
District
Court
would
first
have
to
decide
whether
the
non-payment
be
due
to
a
inability
to
pay
or
a
refusal
to
pay
.
this
seem
a
fundamental
point
,
but
it
be
not
a
area
of
the
law
with
which
many
of
we
be
familiar
until
the
judgment
be
make
in
this
case
.
the
judgment
probably
surprise
people
in
that
it
deem
the
area
unconstitutional
,
which
necessitate
legislation
.
I
could
not
understand
how
it
could
be
justify
as
a
law
.
it
seem
to
require
a
change
.
it
seem
basic
that
fair
procedure
should
be
available
for
a
hearing
before
the
court
deal
with
the
possible
imprisonment
of
a
debtor
.
the
Labour
Party
acknowledge
this
be
serious
legislation
,
as
it
involve
the
potential
imprisonment
of
people
for
non-payment
of
debt
.
we
also
acknowledge
that
serious
issue
be
raise
in
the
judgment
of
Laffoy
in
the
McCann
case
.
we
need
to
discuss
that
issue
in
great
detail
.
the
question
for
the
House
be
whether
this
legislation
be
draft
to
take
cognisance
of
the
difference
between
that
who
cannot
pay
and
that
who
will
not
pay
and
whether
the
application
of
criminal
procedure
against
debtor
who
fail
to
discharge
they
debt
be
reasonable
.
the
fact
that
the
imprisonment
order
make
against
Ms
McCann
would
have
be
carry
out
if
she
have
not
take
the
action
show
that
a
person
could
be
deprive
of
he
or
she
freedom
,
regardless
of
whether
he
or
she
be
deliberately
flout
the
law
or
could
not
simply
pay
they
debt
.
in
that
case
,
the
respondent
have
inform
the
court
that
they
would
vary
the
instalment
,
but
that
the
debt
would
still
stand
.
this
be
widely
report
in
the
media
at
the
time
and
the
Irish
Times
of
27
June
state
that
Judge
Neilan
say
he
would
remand
all
committal
and
many
enforcement
matter
to
the
end
of
November
,
when
it
might
be
clear
if
the
Laffoy
decision
would
be
appeal
to
the
Supreme
Court
or
if
legislator
would
take
action
.
we
be
take
action
today
,
but
it
still
remain
unclear
whether
the
government
have
adequately
deal
with
the
Laffoy
judgment
as
it
pertain
to
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
the
question
remain
as
to
whether
we
should
vote
against
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
finding
within
the
Laffoy
judgment
be
not
implement
in
they
entirety
in
this
legislation
or
whether
we
should
revert
to
the
1940
Act
.
I
suggest
we
should
not
revert
to
the
1940
Act
but
that
a
response
be
require
.
I
feel
the
response
be
deliver
in
the
legislation
,
although
the
Labour
Party
still
find
the
legislation
somewhat
flawed
.
it
remain
to
be
see
whether
the
lack
of
a
provision
in
this
regard
will
be
challenge
once
the
Bill
be
pass
.
we
must
legislate
to
ensure
that
maintenance
order
be
enforce
and
upheld
and
ensure
that
the
threat
and
potential
for
imprisonment
remain
.
on
the
enforcement
of
maintenance
order
,
the
current
situation
in
this
regard
be
unclear
in
light
of
the
McCann
judgment
and
until
the
implementation
of
this
legislation
.
District
Court
clerk
must
maintain
that
order
,
but
the
situation
as
to
they
standing
be
unclear
.
be
there
a
issue
with
regard
to
time
constraint
,
from
the
time
of
the
McCann
judgment
up
to
the
implementation
of
this
legislation
?
person
seek
maintenance
through
maintenance
order
wonder
whether
they
will
be
affect
adversely
and
whether
the
order
will
be
enforce
.
they
want
to
know
what
direction
the
minister
will
give
to
the
Attorney
General
with
regard
to
advice
to
court
clerk
on
the
matter
of
what
they
should
do
next
about
that
order
once
the
legislation
be
pass
.
there
be
significant
confusion
and
concern
in
this
regard
.
I
understand
that
in
one
area
in
the
west
up
to
200
maintenance
order
have
be
put
in
abeyance
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
implementation
of
the
legislation
.
will
the
minister
address
that
in
he
response
?
I
may
be
miss
the
point
,
but
if
Judge
Neilan
make
a
judgment
he
would
not
do
anything
until
such
time
as
the
legislation
be
pass
,
we
need
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
effect
the
passing
of
the
legislation
will
have
on
the
issuing
of
maintenance
order
.
we
must
legislate
to
ensure
that
maintenance
order
be
enforce
and
that
the
minister
maintain
the
potential
threat
of
imprisonment
where
they
be
not
pay
.
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
could
still
be
incorporate
in
the
Bill
.
the
change
in
the
Bill
will
,
in
some
circumstance
,
put
a
end
to
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
a
debtor
in
he
she
absence
and
alter
the
onus
of
proof
in
this
case
so
that
it
be
now
for
the
creditor
to
establish
that
the
debtor
's
failure
to
pay
instalment
be
either
due
to
wilful
refusal
or
culpable
neglect
.
this
be
as
suggest
by
FLAC
.
this
shift
the
balance
away
from
the
debtor
to
the
creditor
but
allow
for
the
possibility
for
the
creditor
to
reclaim
the
debt
or
part
of
it
.
this
concept
,
however
,
give
rise
to
some
difficulty
for
the
Labour
Party
.
we
seek
to
amend
the
legislation
to
reflect
the
fact
that
in
she
judgment
Judge
Laffoy
speak
specifically
about
the
issue
of
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
the
Minister
of
State
in
he
response
to
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
move
in
the
Seanad
state
that
the
question
of
attachment
of
earnings
—
the
substantive
basis
of
the
amendment
—
and
of
the
whole
area
of
attachment
of
earnings
to
social
welfare
payment
have
be
consider
by
the
government
,
both
in
this
Bill
and
in
the
Fines
Bill
.
the
conclusion
,
however
,
be
that
it
would
be
problematic
and
difficult
to
operate
fairly
.
the
amendment
also
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
include
attachment
to
social
welfare
payment
,
but
that
this
might
not
be
the
good
time
to
try
to
do
that
.
there
would
also
be
practical
difficulty
that
would
need
to
be
overcome
where
person
in
temporary
employment
be
concerned
.
I
question
the
logic
of
such
a
approach
.
if
the
Law
Reform
Commission
be
go
to
consider
the
issue
of
debt
and
seek
solution
by
way
of
legislation
,
we
must
consider
the
range
of
option
available
.
I
contend
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
be
one
such
option
.
this
already
operate
within
the
family
law
system
and
I
see
no
reason
that
it
cannot
operate
within
other
area
of
civil
debt
.
in
the
Seanad
the
Minister
of
State
say
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
present
a
difficulty
.
if
the
difficulty
be
due
to
the
cost
factor
or
if
it
be
a
administrative
difficulty
,
what
be
the
logic
of
he
argument
?
if
the
ultimate
aim
be
to
keep
people
out
of
prison
,
the
cost
of
administration
of
such
a
scheme
would
be
far
less
than
the
cost
of
imprisonment
.
there
be
logic
in
consider
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
and
include
it
in
the
legislation
.
that
would
be
the
way
to
go
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
people
have
be
imprison
for
not
adhere
to
maintenance
order
,
but
with
regard
to
civil
debt
,
one
could
instigate
such
procedure
.
Senator
Bacik
,
when
speak
in
the
Seanad
and
address
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
say
it
be
eminently
sensible
since
it
propose
a
different
regime
as
a
alternative
to
the
sanction
of
imprisonment
be
impose
upon
a
debtor
,
and
rather
than
imprisonment
,
it
envisage
a
attachment
of
income
or
welfare
order
that
would
be
make
to
address
circumstance
where
somebody
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
pay
debt
.
we
agree
with
this
approach
and
have
tab
amendment
to
that
effect
.
we
still
need
to
go
back
to
the
judgment
of
Ms
Justice
Laffoy
,
who
refer
to
article
11
of
the
UN
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
political
Right
.
it
state
:
"
no
one
shall
be
imprison
merely
because
of
they
inability
to
fulfil
a
contractual
obligation
.
"
the
principle
in
international
law
that
people
should
not
be
imprison
merely
because
of
they
inability
to
fulfil
a
contractual
obligation
be
clear
and
we
be
in
breach
of
it
.
although
there
be
improvement
to
the
current
situation
in
this
Bill
,
which
be
necessitate
by
the
McCann
judgment
,
the
fundamental
principle
upon
which
the
current
system
be
premise
,
namely
,
that
people
can
be
imprison
for
non-payment
of
debt
remain
in
place
.
what
be
the
point
of
imprison
Ms
McCann
?
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
the
vast
majority
of
that
before
the
court
be
people
with
little
or
no
means
or
without
the
necessary
life
skill
,
in
some
instance
,
to
manage
household
income
.
the
idea
that
someone
would
be
subject
to
a
committal
order
without
have
engage
in
any
process
before
a
judge
speak
volume
about
the
arcane
,
archaic
and
outmode
and
borrow
common
law
procedure
which
form
part
of
this
system
.
even
when
someone
receive
documentation
regard
the
discharging
of
a
debt
,
the
chance
be
that
they
be
intimidate
by
a
language
that
be
far
from
simple
and
be
typical
of
a
bygone
age
.
I
be
glad
this
be
be
deal
with
in
the
Bill
.
the
State
must
immediately
begin
the
process
of
change
the
arcane
procedure
regard
the
discharging
of
debt
.
it
be
one
thing
for
we
to
change
the
legislation
,
but
the
question
then
arise
as
to
when
the
section
6
provision
will
kick
in
and
whether
we
will
see
a
revolution
in
the
court
regard
they
arcane
procedure
and
the
type
of
language
they
use
,
and
whether
they
will
change
overnight
.
I
suggest
they
will
not
and
that
many
people
who
present
themselves
to
the
court
will
be
as
confused
as
ever
.
until
we
develop
a
language
for
the
law
that
reflect
modernity
—
if
I
can
use
that
word
—
we
will
still
have
situation
like
the
McCann
case
.
we
still
await
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
paper
in
that
regard
and
hope
it
will
lead
to
the
overhaul
of
the
system
.
we
need
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
rights
of
the
debtor
before
the
court
and
the
rights
of
the
creditor
to
obtain
payment
.
the
minister
state
there
be
4300
application
for
enforcement
order
to
the
District
Court
and
that
186
people
be
imprison
so
far
this
year
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
figure
will
rise
.
when
one
take
into
account
that
in
prison
for
non-payment
of
fine
,
we
have
more
trouble
than
be
worth
it
inside
we
prison
,
where
people
be
there
for
civil
rather
than
criminal
issue
.
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
.
this
bring
I
back
to
FLAC
.
why
not
look
seriously
at
the
proposal
launch
on
Monday
call
to
no
one
's
credit
and
engage
on
that
issue
in
a
meaningful
way
?
I
suggest
the
government
,
particularly
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
deputy
Dermot
Ahern
,
have
its
face
set
against
any
idea
that
seek
to
look
more
laterally
at
the
issue
.
the
fact
remain
that
since
Adam
be
a
boy
people
have
renege
on
they
debt
and
no
government
,
no
matter
how
well
-
intentioned
,
will
be
able
to
legislate
for
human
behaviour
.
I
suggest
a
little
bit
of
common
sense
and
the
accommodation
of
new
idea
would
be
the
way
to
go
.
we
can
no
long
afford
the
notion
that
people
would
be
jail
for
debt
where
it
be
prove
that
they
genuinely
cannot
pay
.
Ms
Justice
Laffoy
,
on
page
82
of
the
judgment
,
state
that
the
application
of
element
of
the
test
to
section
6
illustrate
that
it
be
disproportionate
interference
with
the
constitutionally
protect
right
to
liberty
because
the
objective
of
imprison
a
debtor
for
failure
to
comply
with
a
instalment
order
be
to
procure
the
discharge
of
arrears
of
instalment
.
she
refer
specifically
to
a
statutory
procedure
under
which
a
debtor
who
be
unable
to
discharge
the
arrears
be
imprison
because
of
the
absence
therein
of
procedure
,
include
procedure
which
give
effect
to
the
debtor
's
right
to
fair
procedure
under
the
constitution
,
which
ensure
that
the
judge
ascertain
that
the
debtor
be
unable
to
discharge
the
arrears
,
cannot
be
say
to
be
rationally
connect
with
the
objective
.
this
speak
to
point
we
make
on
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
she
state
such
a
procedure
be
arbitrary
,
unfair
and
not
base
on
rational
consideration
,
and
be
a
unreasonable
and
unnecessary
interference
with
the
debtor
's
right
to
personal
liberty
.
the
question
be
whether
this
aspect
of
she
judgment
have
be
remedy
by
the
new
section
6
.
I
be
a
layman
;
I
be
not
solicitor
,
as
be
my
two
learn
colleague
,
but
perhaps
the
minister
could
respond
and
let
we
know
whether
that
aspect
of
she
judgment
have
be
remedy
.
could
the
statutory
scheme
she
refer
to
be
apply
by
way
of
a
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
?
she
state
that
in
circumstance
where
a
debtor
have
some
resource
to
meet
a
debt
,
a
statutory
scheme
which
do
not
require
the
creditor
to
seek
redress
by
attach
that
resource
do
not
impair
the
debtor
's
right
to
liberty
as
little
as
possible
.
we
wish
to
speak
to
that
issue
by
way
of
the
amendment
we
have
tab
.
ultimately
,
the
question
for
we
be
whether
we
need
to
amend
the
legislation
to
give
voice
to
Ms.
Justice
Laffoy
's
judgment
so
as
to
offset
the
risk
that
the
Bill
may
be
strike
down
again
on
foot
of
a
legal
challenge
in
this
strange
time
.
where
we
guillotine
at
will
,
we
risk
the
prospect
of
a
challenge
when
the
space
for
proper
debate
be
curb
.
proper
space
and
time
have
not
be
allocate
for
debate
on
this
matter
.
it
should
be
state
,
for
historical
purpose
,
that
guillotining
legislation
such
as
this
do
the
legislature
no
good
.
I
often
think
that
when
we
legislate
in
haste
,
it
may
come
back
to
haunt
we
.
we
welcome
section
6
.
it
will
get
the
minister
over
the
hump
,
so
to
speak
,
regard
the
McCann
judgment
,
but
there
be
other
issue
which
need
to
be
address
.
if
we
have
more
time
and
debate
,
a
great
allowance
for
amendment
and
more
expert
opinion
on
this
matter
,
perhaps
we
could
have
address
it
more
fruitfully
.
before
the
minister
embark
on
a
story
,
I
ask
he
to
address
the
point
on
the
District
Court
where
there
be
outstanding
issue
in
regard
to
maintenance
order
.
this
be
fully
address
in
the
Seanad
.
my
party
would
agree
with
the
principle
of
attachment
of
earnings
be
add
to
this
legislation
for
obvious
reason
.
it
would
provide
a
way
towards
off
-
set
the
risk
against
imprisonment
.
it
would
set
in
place
a
clearly
define
procedure
within
the
legislation
on
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
afterwards
.
on
that
basis
,
we
would
support
the
principle
of
attachment
of
earnings
as
use
in
maintenance
order
,
which
could
be
extend
here
.
it
would
address
the
Laffoy
judgment
also
.
I
move
amendment
no.

the
recent
scandal
at
FÁS
have
take
the
organisation
to
such
new
low
that
its
name
alone
evoke
any
number
of
negative
connotation
.
its
unfortunate
association
with
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
have
cast
a
further
shadow
over
its
reputation
.
whether
one
argue
that
this
patronage
be
real
or
perceive
,
it
be
now
time
to
end
the
era
of
the
nod
and
the
wink
and
sever
the
long
association
with
the
Fianna
Fáil
movement
.
it
be
time
to
break
this
unofficial
link
and
rebuild
the
organisation
so
that
FÁS
can
re-ignite
a
sense
of
trust
in
that
who
avail
of
its
service
.
let
we
be
sure
that
people
will
from
now
on
be
100
%
confident
that
FÁS
be
apolitical
in
its
approach
to
everything
it
do
.
we
must
strive
to
bring
FÁS
back
from
the
brink
and
excise
from
its
employment
anyone
who
be
be
carry
unnecessarily
.
its
upper
echelon
have
tarnish
the
authority
's
standing
in
the
public
eye
.
the
reason
for
this
be
well
document
and
have
be
cover
extensively
by
my
colleague
,
deputy
Shortall
.
however
,
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
there
be
much
to
praise
in
FÁS
.
the
Labour
Party
be
determined
to
assist
in
the
restoration
of
its
reputation
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
the
good
work
that
currently
go
on
in
FÁS
,
which
have
a
network
of
66
regional
office
and
20
training
centre
across
the
country
.
the
majority
of
its
work
be
carry
out
at
a
grass
-
root
level
through
the
hard
work
of
its
training
and
education
supervisor
,
employment
scheme
participant
,
business
adviser
and
recruitment
specialist
.
it
have
specifically
cater
for
the
marginalised
in
we
society
.
through
initiative
aim
at
people
with
disability
and
member
of
the
Traveller
community
,
FÁS
have
always
seek
to
empower
and
include
all
citizen
of
we
country
at
a
grass
-
root
level
.
its
wide
horizon
initiative
aim
at
increase
understanding
among
young
people
north
and
south
of
the
Border
,
reconcile
the
two
tradition
while
increase
work
skill
for
every
participant
.
at
ground
level
,
the
work
carry
out
by
FÁS
help
people
from
all
walk
of
life
to
find
job
and
obtain
training
,
and
promote
work
throughout
we
community
.
we
must
not
ignore
this
.
my
experience
of
FÁS
at
a
local
level
have
be
positive
,
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
associate
the
local
worker
with
the
shenanigan
of
that
within
the
hierarchy
.
what
this
people
on
the
ground
represent
be
far
remove
from
what
the
hierarchy
have
come
to
embody
.
where
it
represent
neglect
,
the
work
of
that
on
the
ground
be
characterise
by
a
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
to
the
people
they
be
supervise
through
the
community
employment
scheme
and
in
the
various
office
throughout
the
66
centre
.
where
waste
be
widespread
among
a
minority
at
the
upper
level
,
the
majority
have
come
to
represent
a
significant
investment
in
we
community
.
this
can
not
be
overlook
in
we
effort
to
reform
the
organisation
.
FÁS
have
give
hope
to
many
in
term
of
they
own
personal
circumstance
and
that
of
they
neighbourhood
.
I
be
representative
of
a
largely
rural
constituency
and
I
have
see
first
hand
the
benefit
yield
by
the
community
scheme
,
spearhead
by
FÁS
and
manage
by
local
people
work
within
that
community
.
as
with
all
State
-
fund
body
,
cutback
have
affect
the
service
offer
to
people
in
both
rural
and
urban
community
.
the
idea
that
the
waste
at
the
top
level
of
FÁS
run
parallel
with
the
reduction
of
valuable
service
to
community
have
anger
the
public
and
the
body
politic
alike
.
we
have
every
right
to
be
angry
but
we
must
differentiate
between
the
person
in
the
board
room
and
the
worker
on
the
street
.
we
anger
must
be
channel
appropriately
.
this
anger
lament
the
fact
that
this
fine
institution
should
have
become
a
vessel
for
such
waste
when
it
have
be
a
force
for
good
.
I
believe
it
can
be
a
force
for
good
again
,
but
we
must
bring
about
the
necessary
change
.
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
government
to
revise
the
fee
of
non-executive
chairperson
and
member
of
board
of
state
body
my
Department
contact
the
agency
where
a
fee
be
payable
to
the
chairperson
and
member
of
the
board
request
they
to
reduce
fee
payable
by
10
%
effective
from
1st
May
2009
.
the
relevant
agency
be
also
inform
that
the
revise
fee
be
to
be
apply
in
accordance
with
instruction
provide
by
the
Department
of
Finance
.
I
can
confirm
that
the
agency
concern
comply
with
the
request
.
I
do
not
want
to
raise
any
hackles
,
but
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
whether
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
will
be
publish
any
time
soon
.
that
we
be
only
now
transpose
a
directive
which
be
agree
in
2006
be
typical
of
the
manner
in
which
the
government
have
be
remiss
in
its
obligation
vis
-à
-
vo
the
transposition
of
EU
directive
in
general
.
Ireland
be
behind
the
curve
again
because
we
European
counterpart
,
in
some
instance
,
be
already
prepare
to
undertake
a
review
of
the
directive
that
we
have
yet
to
transpose
.
this
House
,
for
the
first
time
,
will
bring
about
legislation
specifically
charge
with
the
retention
of
communication
datum
.
this
legislation
be
so
flawed
that
it
will
have
to
be
completely
rewritten
if
the
Labour
Party
be
to
support
it
.
it
be
bad
for
business
,
too
costly
to
implement
,
undemocratic
and
the
oversight
provision
be
too
weak
.
I
hope
it
will
be
significantly
amend
to
make
it
more
realistic
and
not
the
sham
we
have
before
we
.
the
reason
for
Ireland
's
delay
in
follow
we
EU
counterpart
in
introduce
such
a
Bill
be
well
document
.
a
attempt
by
previous
administration
to
exclude
the
European
Parliament
and
the
European
Court
of
Justice
delay
the
adoption
of
the
directive
here
.
thankfully
,
with
the
exception
of
Slovakia
,
the
overzealous
and
restrictive
measure
favour
by
the
former
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
Michael
McDowell
,
curry
little
favour
in
Europe
.
this
directive
be
see
as
the
less
of
two
evil
by
the
party
of
European
Socialist
in
the
European
Parliament
,
in
2004
-
05
.
this
be
where
we
differ
with
the
minister
's
interpretation
in
term
of
the
historical
perspective
of
the
directive
.
follow
the
Madrid
bombing
in
2005
the
Irish
,
British
and
two
other
government
come
forward
with
proposal
for
a
third
pillar
intergovernmental
decision
on
datum
retention
.
such
a
measure
would
have
be
adopt
by
the
Justice
Council
with
consultation
rights
only
for
the
European
Parliament
and
no
oversight
role
for
the
European
Court
of
Justice
afterwards
.
this
course
of
action
be
oppose
by
the
Commission
and
the
European
Parliament
,
largely
on
the
grounds
that
such
a
measure
should
be
approve
by
the
European
Parliament
.
the
Commission
then
issue
a
proposal
for
a
draft
directive
in
September
2005
and
the
socialist
group
negotiate
amendment
in
the
European
Parliament
and
adopt
it
December
.
one
of
that
amendment
concern
a
full
review
of
the
measure
in
September
2010
.
my
colleague
in
the
European
Parliament
,
Mr.
Proinsias
de
Rossa
,
MEP
,
vote
in
favour
of
the
compromise
and
the
four
Fianna
Fáil
MEPs
at
that
time
abstain
.
the
directive
be
approve
by
the
Council
in
2006
and
be
to
have
be
transpose
into
Irish
law
by
September
2007
.
however
,
the
then
minister
,
Mr.
McDowell
,
take
a
case
to
the
European
Court
of
Justice
,
argue
that
the
Council
have
no
authority
to
adopt
the
directive
and
that
only
a
third
pillar
initiative
be
permit
.
the
government
refuse
to
transpose
the
directive
while
this
case
be
ongoing
.
in
response
the
European
Commission
begin
legal
proceedings
over
Ireland
's
failure
to
transpose
.
last
February
the
European
Court
of
Justice
reject
the
government
's
argument
and
upheld
the
directive
.
my
understanding
be
that
civil
liberty
group
do
not
have
a
opinion
about
the
four
country
's
initiative
in
2005
,
but
have
write
in
opposition
to
the
draft
directive
.
if
there
be
no
directive
,
it
could
be
argue
,
it
be
likely
that
the
four
country
's
initiative
would
have
be
adopt
.
in
that
context
there
be
two
view
that
can
be
take
on
the
directive
,
and
consequently
this
Bill
.
one
be
that
we
transpose
and
thereby
pass
the
Bill
into
law
without
question
and
accept
it
as
a
fait
accompli
.
the
second
be
that
we
seek
to
amend
the
Bill
and
ground
it
in
reality
by
address
the
cost
of
its
implementation
for
business
and
the
issue
of
oversight
.
the
Labour
Party
take
the
view
that
there
be
circumstance
in
which
datum
retention
be
need
and
useful
.
however
,
there
be
some
many
flaw
in
the
propose
legislation
that
it
would
have
to
be
considerably
amend
before
we
could
be
satisfied
with
its
passing
into
law
.
if
we
take
the
historical
perspective
and
the
context
in
the
which
the
directive
be
fashioned
,
then
we
must
speak
of
the
Madrid
bombing
and
the
Omagh
atrocity
,
which
occur
prior
to
the
instigation
of
the
directive
.
however
,
much
water
have
pass
under
the
bridge
and
the
need
to
transpose
and
legislate
remains
.
we
have
a
obligation
in
that
respect
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
legislation
have
be
supersede
in
some
respects
by
the
surveillance
Bill
in
its
use
as
a
crime
prevention
measure
.
whether
this
Bill
be
a
complement
to
recently
adopt
legislation
be
open
to
question
.
generally
speak
,
the
provision
within
the
Bill
must
be
such
that
they
be
only
allow
in
clearly
prescribe
circumstance
and
we
must
guard
against
any
nefarious
use
of
the
act
when
it
come
into
force
.
the
provision
must
be
subject
to
democratic
review
.
they
must
also
be
subject
to
proper
judicial
review
.
a
criticism
of
the
Bill
relate
to
its
timing
.
I
have
already
state
that
we
be
behind
the
curve
and
Ireland
should
now
be
prepare
for
the
2010
review
of
the
directive
.
it
should
also
be
point
out
that
the
European
Court
of
Justice
will
now
be
bind
by
the
datum
protection
article
of
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
because
of
Lisbon
.
if
there
be
claim
from
any
quarter
that
this
represent
excessive
interference
from
Brussels
,
it
would
be
my
view
that
Mr.
McDowell
's
alternative
be
far
more
draconian
and
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
-
Progressive
Democrat
arrangement
originally
seek
to
extend
this
measure
to
the
entire
EU
.
if
one
argue
this
Bill
from
the
civil
libertarian
perspective
,
then
I
respectfully
suggest
that
the
only
alternative
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
original
proposal
.
it
be
good
that
,
rather
than
have
"
a
intergovernmental
measure
"
,
we
have
a
"
community
measure
"
that
give
a
voice
to
the
European
parliament
,
and
give
the
European
Court
of
Justice
a
meaningful
role
.
concern
have
previously
arise
as
to
the
nature
and
specifically
the
volume
of
request
make
for
retain
datum
.
previously
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
highlight
how
,
in
2006
,
there
be
10000
Garda
request
for
access
to
personal
telephone
record
under
power
arise
from
the
amendment
to
the
criminal
Justice
(
Terrorist
Offences
)
Act
.
this
amount
to
almost
30
request
for
every
day
in
2006
,
and
it
be
evident
that
a
review
of
the
practice
have
be
long
require
.
that
we
be
finally
to
address
this
directive
with
a
Bill
be
positive
but
it
be
not
without
its
peril
.
the
Labour
Party
fully
support
datum
retention
but
only
for
specific
circumstance
.
with
this
power
,
there
be
a
responsibility
,
and
it
be
we
hope
that
through
the
legislative
process
we
will
address
some
of
the
ambiguity
and
issue
arise
from
what
have
be
present
in
the
Bill
.
I
be
concerned
with
the
provision
in
the
Bill
in
regard
to
the
timeframe
within
which
datum
will
be
retain
by
service
provider
.
there
be
concern
also
in
regard
to
cost
undertake
by
that
service
provider
to
adhere
to
such
a
provision
.
it
be
we
consider
view
that
the
minimum
period
of
six
month
may
be
sufficient
.
however
,
we
will
take
this
under
advisement
and
speak
about
this
on
committee
stage
.
I
fear
that
if
the
maximum
allowable
retention
period
will
be
two
year
,
then
we
will
open
this
process
to
a
abuse
and
the
cost
to
business
will
reduce
competitiveness
and
will
ultimately
affect
the
consumer
.
I
fail
to
see
how
10000
request
per
annum
could
possibly
be
pertinent
to
a
serious
crime
investigation
.
far
,
the
lack
of
a
role
for
the
Garda
Ombudsman
be
of
itself
a
cause
for
concern
.
where
a
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
be
investigate
a
complaint
against
a
Garda
that
may
involve
a
criminal
offence
,
the
officer
of
the
commission
have
all
the
power
,
immunity
and
privilege
of
a
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
.
this
include
common
law
power
and
power
under
any
act
,
whether
pass
before
or
after
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
.
so
,
it
seem
that
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
will
have
the
power
vested
in
the
Garda
under
this
Bill
.
while
this
be
reasonable
,
it
raise
the
question
as
to
why
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
its
officer
have
be
specifically
exclude
from
exercising
the
power
to
be
vested
in
gardaí
under
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
.
consistency
in
application
would
require
that
the
ombudsman
commission
should
have
investigative
power
equivalent
to
that
of
gardaí
under
both
this
piece
of
legislation
.
what
be
the
reason
for
exclude
the
ombudsman
commission
under
one
Bill
and
include
it
in
the
other
?
I
hope
the
minister
will
address
this
point
.
on
the
issue
of
oversight
,
I
must
ask
whether
the
minister
be
seriously
ask
this
legislature
to
accept
section
11
as
it
be
word
at
present
.
if
we
speak
specifically
to
the
issue
of
oversight
,
section
11
would
have
to
be
modify
to
give
a
more
structure
role
for
judicial
oversight
other
than
that
which
be
propose
.
the
wording
in
section
11
and
12
be
as
weak
as
water
and
pay
lip
service
to
the
notion
of
oversight
.
there
be
no
provision
for
redress
for
a
person
who
have
be
investigate
inappropriately
under
this
provision
.
there
be
no
provision
for
a
Revenue
officer
,
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
or
member
of
the
permanent
Defence
Force
to
be
bring
to
book
where
a
misuse
or
abuse
of
the
process
be
prove
.
the
oversight
process
must
investigate
a
adequate
number
of
file
and
this
must
be
on
a
random
basis
.
the
question
again
arise
as
to
what
real
power
a
judge
have
in
regard
to
any
abuse
of
process
.
there
be
none
that
I
can
see
in
the
Bill
.
I
refer
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
to
the
Bills
Digest
produce
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
,
which
produce
a
excellent
paper
on
this
matter
,
and
I
acknowledge
its
invaluable
service
in
this
respect
.
on
the
matter
of
judicial
supervision
,
the
paper
state
:
"
in
carry
out
he
-
she
duty
the
judge
may
investigate
any
case
in
which
a
disclosure
request
be
make
,
communicate
with
the
Taoiseach
or
the
minister
concern
disclosure
request
,
and
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
in
connection
with
the
Commissioner
's
function
under
the
data
Protection
Act
1988
and
2003
.
"
while
this
oversight
broadly
echow
similar
approach
use
in
,
for
example
,
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
2009
,
Mr.
Tom
McIntyre
,
speak
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
Justice
(
Terrorist
Offences
)
act
2005
,
raise
concern
about
the
effectiveness
of
this
form
of
supervision
scheme
.
he
state
:
.
.
.
this
oversight
system
have
be
almost
entirely
opaque
from
the
outset
.
the
annual
report
of
the
designate
judge
—
since
the
position
be
create
in
1993
—
have
consist
every
year
of
no
more
than
a
single
line
state
that
the
operation
of
the
act
have
be
keep
under
review
and
its
provision
have
be
comply
with
.
there
have
be
for
example
no
discussion
of
what
step
have
be
take
to
keep
the
operation
of
the
act
under
review
;
whether
the
individual
file
be
review
;
the
volume
of
surveillance
be
carry
out
;
and
whether
mistake
be
make
in
carry
out
surveillance
(
such
as
target
of
the
wrong
individual
or
number
)
and
,
if
so
,
what
step
be
take
to
safeguard
against
such
mistake
in
future
.
there
be
similarly
no
publicly
available
report
of
the
complaint
referee
indicate
what
complaint
,
if
any
,
have
be
make
and
-
or
upheld
.
this
may
be
contrast
with
the
most
recent
annual
report
of
the
UK
Chief
Surveillance
Commissioner
which
reveal
,
amongst
other
thing
,
that
23628
authorisation
for
direct
surveillance
be
grant
to
law
enforcement
agency
;
and
60
different
law
enforcement
agency
be
inspect
during
the
year
.
.
.
the
report
of
the
designate
judge
be
not
exactly
what
one
would
call
model
of
transparency
.
there
be
no
reason
that
we
should
not
have
a
provision
in
the
Bill
which
would
guarantee
that
statistical
datum
be
make
available
.
there
be
a
irony
in
that
because
,
if
one
examine
section
9
of
the
Bill
,
one
will
see
there
be
provision
for
a
annual
statistical
report
to
the
European
Commission
,
as
require
by
the
directive
,
but
not
to
the
Oireachtas
or
to
Irish
citizen
.
at
least
this
report
should
be
lay
before
the
Oireachtas
.
the
opaque
nature
of
the
Irish
oversight
system
also
become
obvious
when
compare
with
the
equivalent
report
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
the
relevant
official
in
the
UK
be
the
Interception
of
Communication
Commissioner
.
that
individual
be
a
retire
judge
who
have
similar
function
to
we
designate
judge
.
however
,
he
most
recent
annual
report
run
to
24
page
in
total
,
nine
of
which
be
devote
to
datum
retention
issue
.
grant
,
the
UK
system
be
on
a
much
large
scale
,
but
one
key
difference
be
that
the
UK
commissioner
do
not
see
he
role
as
limited
to
the
narrow
question
of
legality
—
instead
he
report
go
into
detail
about
mistake
which
be
make
and
explain
what
be
be
do
to
prevent
further
mistake
.
it
would
be
desirable
to
establish
a
great
role
for
the
designate
judge
along
this
line
.
I
hope
we
can
address
that
issue
on
committee
stage
.
the
function
of
the
designate
judge
and
complaint
referee
be
too
limited
.
one
of
the
problem
with
the
role
of
the
designate
judge
under
section
12
be
that
it
envisage
he
or
she
as
be
engage
in
a
largely
paper
-
base
exercise
.
section
12
give
the
designate
judge
"
the
power
to
investigate
any
case
in
which
a
disclosure
request
be
make
"
.
let
we
suppose
however
that
a
junior
garda
informally
pressurise
a
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
employee
to
hand
over
information
—
perhaps
for
some
private
purpose
.
in
that
case
no
"
disclosure
request
"
,
as
define
in
section
6
,
would
have
be
make
,
thus
leave
a
question
mark
as
to
whether
the
judge
have
any
power
to
investigate
.
it
might
be
possible
to
read
section
12
widely
to
find
such
a
power
—
but
it
would
be
desirable
for
it
to
be
make
clear
.
the
judge
's
role
under
section
12
be
also
limit
to
"
ascertain[ing
]
whether
the
Garda
Síochána
,
the
permanent
Defence
Force
and
the
Revenue
commissioner
be
comply
with
"
the
act
.
as
such
,
the
judge
do
not
appear
to
enjoy
any
power
to
,
for
example
,
make
sure
that
isp
and
telco
be
store
this
information
securely
or
be
respond
appropriately
to
request
.
similarly
,
the
role
of
the
complaint
referee
under
section
10
hing
on
there
be
a
"
disclosure
request
"
.
as
such
,
he
or
she
would
have
no
power
to
investigate
if
,
for
example
,
a
newspaper
be
to
bribe
a
telecom
employee
for
access
to
information
.
I
refer
to
a
recent
case
where
a
red
top
,
which
I
will
not
name
,
be
recently
implicate
in
a
similar
phone
tapping
scandal
.
that
problem
be
to
some
extent
mitigate
by
the
fact
that
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
might
investigate
that
situation
but
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
will
not
have
the
same
oversight
power
.
the
act
should
clarify
the
function
of
the
designate
judge
and
complaint
referee
and
make
clear
what
be
to
happen
in
borderline
case
.
there
be
uncertainty
about
to
whom
the
Bill
will
apply
.
the
Bill
take
,
essentially
verbatim
,
the
loose
language
of
the
directive
and
in
section
1
define
a
service
provider
as
"
a
person
who
be
engage
in
the
provision
of
a
publicly
available
electronic
communication
service
or
a
public
communication
network
by
means
of
fix
line
or
mobile
telephone
or
the
Internet
"
.
that
be
wide
,
and
imprecise
definition
and
give
that
specific
statutory
obligation
be
create
a
element
of
doubt
can
arise
.
there
be
many
various
application
and
we
do
not
know
how
the
provision
would
apply
to
or
affect
that
who
use
webmail
,
webmail
-
like
application
,
open
wifi
,
and
voice
internet
messaging
.
the
list
be
endless
.
there
be
such
a
broad
scope
and
range
of
technology
that
it
be
we
view
that
the
definition
need
to
be
clear
.
that
will
cause
panic
and
confusion
across
the
sector
and
will
have
seriously
damaging
consequence
for
Ireland
's
ability
to
promote
itself
as
a
destination
for
high
-
tech
industry
.
I
wish
to
read
into
the
record
a
copy
of
a
letter
receive
by
the
Minister
from
the
ICT
division
of
Engineer
which
speak
further
to
the
concern
they
have
about
the
Bill
:
we
first
observe
that
electronic
datum
be
diverse
,
and
increase
in
its
diversity
.
telephone
,
mobile
phone
and
text
messaging
be
well
establish
,
along
with
electronic
email
messaging
.
however
,
in
many
community
it
be
now
more
common
to
use
social
networking
site
—
such
as
Facebook
,
Bebo
,
and
LinkedIn
—
for
direct
person
to
person
,
and
person
to
group
communication
.
such
communication
use
a
different
technology
than
email
,
and
cannot
necessarily
be
detect
by
software
which
specifically
track
email
.
far
,
direct
internet
messaging
—
such
as
AIM
,
MSN
,
Yahoo
Messenger
and
skype
messaging
—
be
also
extremely
common
.
finally
of
course
Twitter
be
also
now
perhaps
the
most
prevalent
of
they
all
,
and
can
be
use
both
for
instant
person
to
person
communication
,
as
well
as
person
to
group
communication
.
no
doubt
next
year
,
there
will
be
another
new
communication
technology
..
we
concern
be
that
as
criminal
become
aware
of
the
legislation
pertain
in
Ireland
,
they
may
well
be
able
to
displace
they
electronic
communication
mode
to
new
one
for
which
legislation
have
yet
to
be
pass
.
[
that
issue
need
to
be
raise
as
well
.
]
on
a
different
track
,
we
would
note
that
in
today
's
world
,
much
electronic
communication
be
international
in
nature
.
correspondent
(
of
instant
messaging
,
email
,
social
networking
,
twitter
and
so
)
may
not
always
be
within
the
Irish
jurisdiction
,
and
not
even
within
the
EU
.
we
gently
draw
this
to
you
attention
,
and
assume
you
legal
advisor
be
consider
the
consequence
of
capture
information
relate
to
citizen
and
company
from
outside
the
EU
who
may
not
be
cover
by
Irish
legislation
.
[
that
point
must
be
address
by
the
minister
in
response
to
this
debate
.
]
with
today
's
falling
cost
of
storage
,
there
be
no
particular
great
concern
over
the
cost
of
the
physical
hardware
.
however
,
safely
and
securely
store
and
then
retrieve
(
perhaps
after
several
year
)
increase
quantity
of
information
do
have
implication
on
the
business
process
of
the
service
provider
concerned
.
there
be
the
aspect
of
capture
the
information
in
the
first
instance
,
base
on
the
number
of
mode
of
communication
.
that
will
run
into
billion
if
one
take
the
two
year
retention
period
into
account
.
that
issue
will
have
to
be
address
.
follow
that
,
there
be
a
significant
cost
implication
for
business
as
a
result
of
that
.
in
this
country
we
be
talk
about
the
possibility
of
a
smart
economy
.
what
the
legislation
do
be
incur
a
further
cost
on
business
by
virtue
of
the
datum
retention
period
.
Wide
issue
arise
in
term
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
legislation
vis-à
-
vis
the
fact
that
we
trade
internationally
and
message
pass
internationally
.
that
be
something
that
must
be
address
by
the
legislation
.
no
justification
have
be
give
for
a
two
-
year
retention
period
for
phone
datum
.
under
the
directive
,
member
state
be
free
to
choose
a
datum
retention
period
between
six
month
and
two
year
.
the
UK
adopt
a
standard
12
month
period
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
justification
as
to
why
the
Bill
opt
for
the
maximum
two
year
for
telephone
datum
.
the
European
Commission
's
own
research
on
police
request
for
datum
have
show
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
request
be
for
datum
which
be
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
Garda
experience
be
different
then
some
evidence
to
that
effect
would
be
desirable
.
as
to
the
budgetary
implication
of
this
legislation
,
I
have
serious
reservation
about
the
undue
cost
that
would
be
borne
by
business
as
a
result
of
that
measure
.
again
,
I
refer
to
the
Oireachtas
research
service
that
focus
on
the
budgetary
implication
.
it
state
the
Bill
be
silent
on
the
likely
cost
to
be
involve
in
implement
and
comply
with
the
provision
of
the
directive
.
accord
to
the
status
report
on
the
transposition
of
the
directive
by
EU
member
states
and
EFTA
and
the
regulatory
impact
assessment
prepare
by
the
Department
of
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
the
State
will
not
reimburse
service
provider
the
cost
involve
in
comply
with
the
obligation
under
the
Bill
,
even
though
"
service
provider
have
complain
that
management
of
datum
would
impose
heavy
cost
that
they
would
in
turn
have
to
pass
on
to
business
and
consumer
"
.
the
net
effect
of
the
legislation
,
arguably
,
be
that
we
will
retain
all
sort
of
datum
,
99.9
%
of
which
will
be
superfluous
message
that
pass
between
ordinary
citizen
.
this
will
be
store
by
the
service
provider
.
there
will
be
a
cost
for
that
storage
and
the
consumer
will
end
up
pay
that
cost
.
I
accept
the
principle
that
there
must
be
datum
retention
.
however
,
there
must
be
balance
in
term
of
how
long
it
be
retain
and
whether
it
be
necessary
to
retain
datum
for
two
year
.
I
believe
it
be
unnecessary
.
it
be
impractical
and
in
the
context
of
crime
prevention
measure
,
I
be
not
convinced
that
retain
datum
,
particularly
internet
datum
,
for
a
period
of
two
year
will
catch
more
criminal
or
undo
a
terrorist
organisation
.
we
must
exercise
a
little
common
sense
in
we
approach
to
the
legislation
.
with
that
in
mind
,
we
will
seek
to
amend
the
legislation
significantly
to
reflect
we
view
.
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
be
be
collate
by
my
official
,
but
unfortunately
it
have
not
be
possible
to
fully
gather
all
the
relevant
datum
in
the
time
available
.
I
will
reply
directly
to
the
deputy
as
soon
as
the
information
have
be
fully
collate
.

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
issue
raise
in
today
's
edition
of
the
Irish
Examiner
,
which
report
on
the
worry
level
of
suicide
in
Ireland
.
I
be
seek
a
debate
in
the
House
so
that
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
can
say
why
little
progress
have
be
make
in
implement
the
33
recommendation
make
by
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Children
in
2006
,
what
tangible
deadline
have
be
set
out
for
the
implementation
of
that
recommendation
and
to
ask
the
minister
to
respond
to
the
description
of
this
government
's
record
on
suicide
prevention
as
a
litany
of
failure
.
why
do
we
nationalise
it
?
while
I
have
great
respect
for
deputy
Michael
McGrath
's
view
,
as
a
layman
I
still
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
the
State
can
justify
the
investment
of
€
4
billion
of
taxpayer
's
money
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
to
date
,
no
one
have
be
able
to
give
I
a
economic
rationale
for
allow
this
bank
to
stay
afloat
.
I
have
not
hear
it
from
a
market
perspective
,
nor
have
I
hear
a
cogent
political
perspective
to
convince
I
of
the
need
to
have
invest
so
much
taxpayer
's
money
in
that
institution
.
there
will
have
to
be
a
further
analysis
of
that
decision
.
I
can
only
surmise
that
some
of
the
stakeholder
in
that
bank
be
so
strategic
in
term
of
the
Irish
economy
and
the
employment
they
provide
that
if
there
be
a
risk
they
investment
be
go
to
be
compromise
in
any
way
,
it
could
have
have
untold
consequence
for
job
in
a
number
of
other
sector
.
that
have
not
be
state
by
anyone
on
the
government
bench
,
however
.
I
would
prefer
people
to
come
clean
about
the
motive
for
such
a
investment
because
taxpayer
deserve
no
less
.
as
regards
the
deputy
's
comment
on
the
levy
,
that
who
will
ultimately
pay
the
price
if
such
a
levy
be
impose
on
the
bank
will
be
the
customer
,
not
the
institution
themselves
and
certainly
not
the
shareholder
.
if
a
levy
be
impose
,
the
taxpayer
will
pay
it
,
thus
impose
another
cost
on
the
customer
base
.
as
regards
the
NAMA
legislation
,
four
month
ago
,
a
representative
from
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
tell
a
Oireachtas
committee
that
approximately
14000
people
in
this
country
have
mortgage
which
be
in
arrears
.
juxtapose
this
with
a
blanket
guarantee
,
which
Labour
oppose
,
and
one
have
a
situation
where
the
government
now
stand
as
guarantor
for
the
fund
of
speculative
bondholder
in
some
instance
,
as
well
as
shareholder
in
a
banking
system
in
a
state
of
paralysis
and
to
which
it
be
propose
to
transfer
resource
in
the
name
of
all
taxpayer
,
present
and
future
.
one
of
the
fundamental
question
for
my
constituent
in
Cork
East
be
whether
legislation
of
this
magnitude
will
protect
home
owner
who
be
at
risk
of
repossession
.
the
answer
to
that
question
,
quite
plainly
,
be
"
no
"
.
we
be
lose
job
every
day
and
liquidity
play
a
part
in
that
analysis
.
more
seriously
,
as
my
colleague
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
point
out
early
,
home
owner
be
terrified
of
the
day
when
interest
rate
increase
as
the
European
Central
Bank
respond
to
a
slow
European
recovery
.
a
wave
of
repossession
may
ensue
.
that
figure
of
14000
represent
thousand
of
family
who
live
with
the
fear
of
repossession
hang
over
they
head
as
they
attempt
to
make
end
meet
.
this
be
family
live
in
unfinished
estate
or
shoebox
apartment
.
Young
family
be
send
they
child
to
prefab
classroom
in
school
too
small
to
cope
with
the
influx
of
new
housing
.
they
be
family
who
make
a
choice
.
much
like
the
banker
who
will
be
bail
out
by
this
legislation
,
this
family
decide
to
take
a
risk
in
purchase
house
at
historically
high
price
.
take
out
a
mortgage
constitute
make
a
investment
in
property
,
with
all
the
potential
hazard
that
come
with
it
.
in
the
main
,
however
,
they
behaviour
could
not
be
characterise
as
speculative
.
they
behaviour
be
predicate
on
the
basic
human
need
to
set
up
home
and
put
down
root
.
the
difference
,
however
,
be
that
this
family
will
not
be
afford
any
bailout
.
the
good
that
family
in
arrears
will
get
be
a
moratorium
,
a
stay
of
execution
that
will
delay
the
inevitable
proceedings
that
could
see
a
percentage
of
they
render
homeless
.
there
be
also
another
difference
.
while
banker
and
builder
look
to
a
multitude
of
so
-
call
financial
expert
hell
bend
on
hit
financial
target
,
the
people
take
they
government
's
assurance
at
face
value
when
step
onto
the
property
ladder
.
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
laugh
off
warning
of
a
recession
with
joke
about
naysayer
commit
suicide
and
insist
that
we
be
in
for
a
soft
landing
when
caution
about
the
overheated
economy
.
week
prior
to
the
2007
general
election
,
the
then
Taoiseach
,
deputy
Bertie
Ahern
,
criticise
a
RTE
programme
entitle
"
future
Shock
:
Property
Crash
"
.
at
the
time
the
programme
be
frightening
in
its
bleak
appraisal
of
the
property
market
,
but
it
be
now
see
as
remarkable
in
its
prescience
.
at
the
time
,
deputy
Bertie
Ahern
describe
the
programme
as
irresponsible
and
inaccurate
.
why
should
the
public
trust
that
who
get
we
into
this
mess
to
get
we
out
of
it
?
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
have
not
get
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
this
country
on
NAMA
or
any
other
issue
.
once
again
,
the
people
be
be
ask
to
trust
Fianna
Fáil
,
the
party
which
give
assurance
of
soft
landing
and
ignore
the
advice
of
that
concerned
with
the
property
bubble
.
once
again
,
its
member
choose
to
ignore
the
warning
,
this
time
disregard
the
sound
economic
consensus
that
NAMA
be
a
bad
deal
for
the
taxpayer
.
any
faith
the
public
once
have
in
Fianna
Fáil
be
gone
.
we
can
see
this
legislation
for
what
it
be
—
a
attempt
by
Fianna
Fáil
to
maintain
the
status
quo
.
it
will
continue
to
prop
up
that
who
benefit
greatly
from
the
economic
policy
of
Deputy
Bertie
Ahern
,
Charlie
McCreevy
and
Brian
Cowen
.
that
policy
enlarge
the
gulf
between
the
wealthy
elite
and
ordinary
citizen
.
the
people
of
Ireland
do
not
want
NAMA
and
they
do
not
believe
that
this
government
can
repair
the
damage
do
to
Ireland
's
economy
,
reputation
and
confidence
.
the
Labour
Party
policy
on
NAMA
be
predicate
on
a
belief
that
the
payment
to
a
bank
of
a
long
-
term
economic
value
for
loan
amount
to
a
significant
gift
by
taxpayer
.
this
be
a
€
7
billion
gift
to
the
bank
.
as
CORI
and
other
organisation
have
point
out
,
this
be
likely
to
undermine
the
State
's
finances
and
public
service
for
year
to
come
while
fail
to
secure
credit
for
business
.
the
government
's
approach
to
resolve
the
current
fiscal
crisis
be
inherently
flawed
.
there
be
no
talk
of
stimulus
and
the
asset
be
over
-
value
.
bank
do
not
have
to
change
they
behaviour
.
we
believe
the
current
market
value
be
the
price
that
must
be
pay
for
this
asset
.
the
government
should
ensure
nothing
above
the
true
current
market
value
be
pay
for
the
asset
in
order
that
the
risk
to
the
citizen
be
lessen
.
if
the
€
47
billion
valuation
be
accurate
,
the
decision
to
pay
the
bank
€
54
billion
for
the
asset
amount
to
a
gift
of
€
7
billion
to
they
.
where
be
the
economic
justification
for
such
a
action
?
the
Bill
be
one
of
the
most
significant
the
Dáil
will
ever
debate
.
the
risk
to
the
Exchequer
be
enormous
and
irreversible
.
overpayment
by
NAMA
for
the
loan
will
impose
a
major
financial
burden
on
the
State
,
yet
it
be
clear
this
be
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
government
's
approach
.
throughout
the
banking
crisis
,
the
Labour
Party
's
analysis
have
be
consistent
in
its
determination
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer
,
while
advance
proposal
to
restore
a
function
banking
system
,
supply
much
need
credit
in
the
economy
at
the
low
cost
and
risk
to
the
taxpayer
.
we
analysis
be
there
will
always
be
a
risk
to
the
taxpayer
but
we
can
mitigate
it
more
expeditiously
than
Fianna
Fáil
.
we
approach
,
base
on
temporary
nationalisation
of
the
two
large
bank
,
would
minimise
the
risk
to
the
taxpayer
and
provide
a
potential
upside
when
the
bank
be
reintegrate
into
the
private
sector
.
we
have
publish
we
position
in
this
regard
and
be
consistent
in
we
opposition
to
the
underlying
culture
of
greed
and
recklessness
that
give
rise
to
the
banking
crisis
in
the
first
place
.
we
have
always
call
for
tougher
regulation
at
EU
level
and
counter
the
role
of
we
own
commissioner
,
Mr.
Charlie
McCreevy
,
in
completely
roll
back
the
regulatory
framework
,
a
process
start
by
he
predecessor
,
Commissioner
Bolkestein
.
in
addition
,
we
have
always
say
the
financial
service
sector
would
have
to
be
regulate
because
the
invisible
hand
of
capitalism
would
render
the
type
of
crisis
we
be
now
experience
.
during
the
bubble
year
we
point
to
the
danger
and
unfairness
of
soar
house
price
,
bring
forward
legislation
to
control
the
price
of
building
land
and
challenge
the
tax
break
fuell
property
price
.
instead
of
act
to
control
price
,
Fianna
Fáil
stoke
the
property
boom
at
the
same
time
as
the
party
flaunt
its
relationship
with
property
developer
.
there
be
serious
weakness
in
the
propose
governance
structure
of
NAMA
.
as
well
as
the
risk
and
cost
of
bad
loan
be
borne
by
the
taxpayer
,
no
provision
in
the
Bill
give
assurance
that
a
tough
,
commercial
approach
will
be
take
to
developer
.
the
legislation
have
inherent
flaw
.
the
Bill
state
the
agency
be
to
obtain
the
well
achievable
financial
return
for
the
State
have
regard
to
a
number
of
factor
but
it
vest
extraordinary
power
and
discretion
in
the
minister
for
Finance
.
I
be
not
convinced
this
power
will
achieve
the
good
financial
return
for
the
State
.
the
legislation
state
,
"
except
where
otherwise
provide
by
this
act
,
NAMA
be
independent
in
its
performance
of
its
function
"
.
in
a
overall
assessment
of
the
Bill
's
provision
,
the
agency
,
in
all
major
respects
,
be
not
independent
but
it
must
act
at
the
direction
of
the
minister
.
its
function
be
"
to
acquire
certain
asset
from
certain
person
to
be
designate
"
by
the
minister
and
"
to
perform
such
other
function
related
to
the
management
or
realisation
of
bank
asset
that
it
have
acquire
as
be
direct
by
the
minister
"
.
the
power
of
designation
of
"
eligible
bank
asset
"
to
be
purchase
by
NAMA
be
vested
in
the
minister
.
he
or
she
must
consult
NAMA
,
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Financial
Regulator
but
the
power
to
designate
reside
with
he
or
she
exclusively
.
this
be
a
flawed
process
in
the
context
of
democracy
.
I
hope
the
Labour
Party
will
have
a
opportunity
to
address
this
issue
on
committee
stage
because
there
must
be
proper
financial
and
regulatory
oversight
of
the
legislation
to
ensure
it
will
not
be
abuse
if
the
minister
be
seek
to
achieve
the
aim
of
gain
the
maximum
value
for
the
amount
invest
by
the
State
.
the
legislation
require
NAMA
,
in
the
performance
of
its
function
,
to
have
regard
to
any
guideline
issue
by
the
minister
and
set
out
he
or
she
power
of
direction
,
which
be
extensive
.
the
agency
be
require
to
comply
with
any
ministerial
direction
.
the
legislation
give
the
minister
too
much
power
.
this
power
need
to
be
devolve
to
the
financial
regulatory
regime
.
I
hope
this
issue
will
also
be
address
on
committee
stage
.
the
NTMA
must
provide
NAMA
with
such
business
and
support
service
and
system
as
the
NAMA
board
determine
act
on
the
recommendation
of
the
chief
executive
officer
of
NAMA
and
follow
consultation
with
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
NTMA
.
it
be
also
oblige
to
supply
staff
and
provide
nama
with
treasury
service
and
advice
.
other
than
this
function
,
NAMA
appear
to
be
a
cuckoo
in
the
NTMA
nest
.
while
the
formula
of
have
consultation
with
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
be
include
in
the
Bill
,
clearly
the
minister
be
not
bind
by
and
do
not
need
to
have
particular
regard
to
he
or
she
view
.
with
regard
to
the
role
of
the
Oireachtas
,
the
minister
be
require
to
furnish
a
annual
statement
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
but
the
Bill
entitle
he
or
she
to
omit
"
any
matter
that
would
disclose
confidential
information
"
.
"
confidential
information
"
be
widely
define
and
could
be
construe
to
justify
withhold
any
information
the
minister
see
fit
.
the
chairperson
and
chief
executive
officer
of
NAMA
must
appear
before
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
and
deal
with
general
matter
that
be
specify
,
for
example
,
the
economy
and
the
efficiency
of
nama
system
and
procedure
.
however
,
the
Bill
include
a
section
that
gag
and
prevent
they
from
express
a
opinion
on
the
merit
of
the
policy
of
the
government
or
a
minister
or
on
the
merit
of
the
objective
of
such
a
policy
.
the
legislation
appear
to
leave
it
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
to
evaluate
after
five
year
whether
NAMA
"
have
make
progress
towards
achieve
its
overall
objective
"
and
whether
a
continuation
of
the
agency
be
necessary
.
that
should
be
a
decision
for
the
Oireachtas
,
rather
than
the
minister
.
the
minister
also
have
critical
override
function
in
the
determination
of
acquisition
value
.
the
Bill
empower
the
minister
to
make
regulation
to
require
NAMA
to
take
into
account
the
report
of
a
expert
concern
factor
or
matter
relevant
to
the
determination
of
the
value
of
any
property
in
question
.
under
the
legislation
,
he
or
she
will
appoint
the
expert
reviewer
and
the
valuation
panel
.
the
panel
will
review
the
total
portfolio
acquisition
value
and
then
proceed
to
communicate
its
position
to
the
minister
,
not
NAMA
.
however
,
the
minister
can
reject
the
valuation
of
a
portfolio
by
the
panel
.
in
other
word
,
if
he
or
she
do
not
secure
the
valuation
he
or
she
want
from
the
panel
,
it
will
have
to
reconsider
the
valuation
.
that
be
a
Labour
Party
analysis
and
be
something
I
hope
the
minister
will
respond
to
in
the
debate
because
it
be
pertinent
.
there
be
much
in
the
Bill
that
will
require
further
discussion
.
the
valuation
process
be
inherently
flawed
.
the
taxpayer
will
have
pay
a
surplus
of
they
own
money
to
the
bank
for
this
process
.
the
legacy
of
this
legislation
will
be
negative
.
the
Labour
Party
have
a
constructive
alternative
analysis
through
the
construction
of
a
asset
recovery
which
we
feel
would
be
a
much
more
expeditious
way
of
deal
with
the
crisis
in
the
banking
sector
.
we
feel
that
temporary
nationalisation
,
with
a
view
to
sell
stock
back
into
the
market
once
there
be
a
upturn
in
the
economy
,
be
the
way
to
go
.
we
hope
to
deal
with
all
of
the
issue
we
have
outline
on
Committee
stage
.
the
decision
on
eligibility
for
student
grant
be
a
matter
for
the
relevant
assess
authority
—
i.e.
the

if
the
original
reps
plan
be
a
agri-environment
measure
,
why
be
it
necessary
to
do
away
with
the
scheme
and
reintroduce
a
agri-environment
measure
which
will
have
the
same
aim
?
why
do
the
minister
not
refer
to
biodiversity
?
it
will
be
argue
the
scheme
be
use
as
a
supplementary
income
measure
in
some
case
.
the
scheme
's
closure
will
result
in
more
applicant
for
farm
assist
,
which
be
already
happen
in
some
area
.
consider
the
biodiversity
measure
already
contain
under
the
exist
scheme
and
its
success
,
it
seem
illogical
that
a
new
scheme
need
to
be
introduce
when
the
old
scheme
could
be
continue
.
will
the
new
scheme
—
we
can
call
it
the
agri-environment
measure
for
the
time
being
—
be
administer
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
what
be
the
average
pay
out
to
farmer
under
reps
?
there
be
too
much
consultation
.
that
be
fine
.
I
be
used
to
that
.
I
ask
this
question
,
give
that
Teagasc
's
procedure
and
operation
have
already
be
review
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
recommendation
will
be
implement
.
however
,
the
McCarthy
report
state
that
there
be
scope
for
reduce
Teagasc
's
staff
number
by
a
minimum
of
250
in
the
short
term
by
rationalisation
of
agricultural
college
and
location
,
reduce
low
priority
advisory
and
research
activity
,
reduce
administration
and
advisory
service
,
the
latter
by
50
%
,
reduce
education
and
training
function
by
30
%
and
20
%
,
respectively
,
by
2011
and
review
the
network
of
office
.
if
the
economy
be
to
get
back
on
its
foot
,
the
research
,
administrative
and
support
service
provide
by
Teagasc
will
be
necessary
to
ensure
people
operate
in
the
rural
economy
have
the
advantage
they
require
.
I
strongly
suggest
that
the
Minister
of
State
should
defend
the
service
operate
by
Teagasc
,
particularly
scientific
research
where
McCarthy
propose
that
all
research
should
be
codify
in
one
body
.
this
will
not
necessarily
assist
in
agricultural
or
agribusiness
-
related
research
and
this
should
be
revise
and
review
.
with
regard
to
that
people
who
be
employ
by
Teagasc
in
the
agricultural
college
,
a
question
arise
about
they
future
if
this
report
be
implement
.
I
agree
there
be
a
budgetary
process
in
train
but
I
ask
that
this
area
be
defend
.
if
it
be
not
defend
,
and
we
see
post
-
budget
in
2009
and
2010
a
further
reduction
or
diminution
in
the
service
operate
by
Teagasc
,
it
will
have
untold
consequence
for
the
rural
economy
which
we
will
not
stand
over
.
I
tab
a
question
on
the
public
service
number
and
expenditure
programme
.
this
report
be
sanction
by
government
and
make
specific
recommendation
.
when
I
ask
about
this
specific
recommendation
,
with
all
due
respect
to
that
minister
,
I
get
blasé
,
bland
answer
about
the
wonderful
role
of
Teagasc
.
my
question
be
pertinent
to
what
be
in
the
report
.
I
want
to
know
whether
that
service
will
be
defend
;
I
do
not
want
a
answer
that
hide
behind
the
budgetary
process
which
be
still
a
long
way
off
.
we
want
definitive
answer
.
I
ask
that
question
on
behalf
of
that
people
who
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
who
live
beyond
the
so
-
call
Pale
,
and
who
depend
on
this
service
.
the
Agriculture
Council
will
meet
next
week
.
will
that
meeting
give
rise
to
a
new
regulation
regard
a
CMO
,
common
market
organisation
,
for
milk
or
dairy
,
or
will
the
status
quo
remain
for
political
intervention
in
the
market
,
give
that
there
be
a
slight
increase
in
the
price
and
a
slight
recovery
at
present
?
be
the
strategy
within
the
European
Union
to
do
nothing
at
present
?
it
be
possible
a
logical
strategy
would
be
to
wait
to
see
if
there
will
be
a
further
recovery
,
or
will
there
be
further
intervention
?
I
do
not
quite
understand
the
minister
's
original
reply
.
Environmental
measure
,
such
as
water
management
,
will
become
more
prevalent
under
the
CAP
in
future
.
the
question
concern
the
administrative
function
.
there
be
a
suggestion
afoot
that
we
will
move
from
pillar
one
to
pillar
two
and
that
,
instead
of
direct
payment
to
farmer
for
management
of
the
economy
,
it
will
be
administer
through
various
local
organisation
.
that
danger
be
there
,
so
the
question
need
to
be
address
.
it
may
not
be
a
real
fear
,
but
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
view
on
that
in
the
first
instance
.
second
,
as
regards
carbon
reduction
,
at
some
stage
there
will
have
to
be
a
internal
debate
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Smith
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sargent
,
as
to
whether
methane
reduction
will
become
a
issue
if
the
process
of
carbon
reduction
become
part
of
the
CAP
regime
.
the
climate
change
agenda
be
also
on
the
card
,
give
the
forthcoming
UN
conference
in
Copenhagen
in
December
.
how
will
we
get
to
a
situation
where
we
do
not
compromise
production
or
market
share
,
while
meet
future
demand
for
food
,
as
well
as
other
target
?
there
will
be
a
internal
battle
within
the
government
on
that
issue
.
it
be
something
that
will
arise
in
the
context
of
the
CAP
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
opinion
from
the
minister
on
this
question
.
I
wish
to
assure
the
deputy
that
the
provision
of
appropriate
educational
intervention
and
support
for
child
with
special
educational
need
continue
to
be
a
key
government
priority
.
this
be
reflect
in
the
fact
that
my
Department
be
the
only
department
other
than
social
Welfare
that
get
a
increase
this
year
.
the

will
be
aware
of
my
commitment
to
ensure
that
all

include
that

can

in

there
have
be
unprecedented

there
be
now
about
19000

as

in

of

I
assume
that
the

relate
to
my

's
decision
early
this

to
suppress
a
number
of
special

for
pupil

a
mild
general

(

.
I
would
like
to
assure
the
deputy
that
there
will
be
no
pupil
with
a
special
educational
need
who
will
be
without

to

my

all

all

the
correspondence
also
refer
to
the
Education
for
Person
with
special
Educational
need
(
Epsen
)
Act
,
2004
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
this
government
be
commit
to
the
full
implementation
of
Epsen
at
the
early
possible
date
.
a
significant
number
of
section
of
the
act
have
already
be
commence
,
principally
that
establish
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
(
NCSE
)
and
that
promote
a
inclusive
approach
to
the
education
of
child
with
special
educational
need
.
in
the
light
of
the
current
financial
circumstance
,
it
be
not
possible
to
proceed
with
full
implementation
in
2010
as
originally
envisage
.
notwithstanding
this
,
a
commitment
have
be
make
in
the
renew
programme
for
government
to
develop
,
in
consultation
with
stakeholder
,
a
cost
multi-annual
plan
to
implement
some
priority
aspect
of
the
Epsen
Act
,
focus
on
measurable
and
practical
progress
in
education
and
health
service
for
child
with
special
need
.
furthermore
,
as
announce
in
the
renew
Programme
for
Government
,
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
(
NEPS
)
will
be
provide
with
funding
for
28
additional
post
to
bring
the
number
of
NEPS
psychologist
to
210
.
this
mean
that
every
school
in
the
country
will
have
access
to
NEPS
which
provide
assessment
and
psychological
advice
for
school
to
enable
they
to
provide
appropriate
support
and
programme
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
renew
Programme
also
commit
the
government
to
no
further
increase
in
the
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
primary
and
second
level
school
for
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
under
the
renew
programme
we
will
provide
500
teaching
post
between
primary
and
second
level
over
the
next
three
year
.
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
emphasise
that
child
with
special
educational
need
will
continue
to
receive
a
education
appropriate
to
they
need
.
I
intend
to
build
on
the
progress
that
have
be
achieve
in
recent
year
which
have
see
a
huge
increase
in
resource

the

possible
to
proceed
with
full
implementation
in
2010
as
originally
envisage
.
notwithstanding
this
,
a
commitment
have
be
make
in
the
renew
programme
for
government
to
develop
,
in
consultation
with
stakeholder
,
a
cost
multi-annual
plan
to
implement
some
priority
aspect
of
the
Epsen
Act
,
focus
on
measurable
and
practical
progress
in
education
and
health
service
for
child
with
special
need
.
furthermore
,
as
announce
in
the
renew
Programme
for
Government
,
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
(
NEPS
)
will
be
provide
with
funding
for
28
additional
post
to
bring
the
number
of
NEPS
psychologist
to
210
.
this
mean
that
every
school
in
the
country
will
have
access
to
NEPS
which
provide
assessment
and
psychological
advice
for
school
to
enable
they
to
provide
appropriate
support
and
programme
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
renew
Programme
also
commit
the
government
to
no
further
increase
in
the
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
primary
and
second
level
school
for
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
under
the
renew
programme
we
will
provide
500
teaching
post
between
primary
and
second
level
over
the
next
three
year
.
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
emphasise
that
child
with
special
educational
need
will
continue
to
receive
a
education
appropriate
to
they
need
.
I
intend
to
build
on
the
progress
that
have
be
achieve
in
recent
year
which
have
see
a
huge
increase
in
resource
for
special
need
.
the
NCSE
will
continue
to
support
school
,
parent
and
child
and
teacher
and
special
need
assistant
will
continue
to
be
deploy
to
school
to
meet
child
's
need
in
line
with
my
Department
's
policy
.
I
support

when
the
only
other
two
avenue
open
to

be

it
be

to
reform
this
House
and
to
introduce
new
rule
and
regulation
to
allow
we
to
raise
such
issue
on
the
order

this
be
the
tenth
time
I
have
ask
if
the
government
have
any
intention

publish
the
animal
welfare
Bill
.
if
it
have
no
intention
of

it
,
it
should
just

so

as

will
be
aware

the
proposal
in

report
of
the
special
Group
on
Public
Service
number
and
expenditure

be
be
consider
as
part
of
the
estimate
process
for

.
the
decision
on
all
of
the
issue
arise
will
be
a
matter
for
the
government
.
while
I
will
have
to
await
the
outcome
of
this
deliberative
process
,
I
can
confirm
that
there
be
no
plan
to
close
small
school
at
the
moment
other
than
that
that
would
arise
in
the
normal
course
under
the
current
sustainability
limit
.
I
fully
acknowledge
the
attachment
of
local
community
to
they
school
and
the
association
of
the
school
with
a
sense
of
place
.
however
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
my
Department
will
have
to
examine
the
implementation
of
more
strict
guideline
in
relation
to
the
number
of
pupil
require
for
the
sustainability
of
school
.
the
deputy
may
be

that

project
involve
amalgamation
of
school
already
attract
a
high
band
rating
within
the
Schools
Building
Programme
.
a
number
of
week

,
I
seek
a
debate
in
this
House
on
the
same
issue
follow
a
report
on
suicide
in
the
Irish
Examiner
.
I
support
deputy
Seán
Power
's
request
in
this
regard
.
it
be
a
fundamental
issue
for
Irish
society
and
time
should
be

a
substantive
and
qualitative
debate
on
the
nature
of

the

state
that

reduction
—
he
call
it
a
adjustment
—
envisage
will
be
offset
by
the
6.6
%
decrease
by
which
price
have
fall
.
the
import
of
this
be
that
a
reduction
of

1.3
billion
in
the
public
sector
pay
bill
have
no
effect
in

because
price
have

if
one
take

6.6
%
and
the

that
be

take

be
inevitable
against

there
be
no
adequate
support

will

fall

,
then
the
minister
be
create
a
major
problem
for
that
people
who
be
on

I
ask
the

to
address
the
question
of
the
inevitable
rise
in

rate
in
real

and
the
effect
that
will
have
for

will

such
a
increase

I
do
not
suggest
a
apocalypse

I
understand
I
have
five
minute
and
that
I
be
share
time
with
—
—
I
refer
to
the
praise
mete
out
to
the
fourth
estate
.
my
colleague
may
have
inadvertently
forget
to
mention
Jonathan
Healy
of
Newstalk
,
Ralph
Riegel
of
the
Irish
Independent
,
Barry
Roche
of
the
Irish

,
and
all

Echo

Paschal
Sheehy
may
have
be
on
holiday
but
I
understand
he
be
here
with
we
in
spirit
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
,
which
be
in
the
flood
plain
.
Mallow
have
be
flood
since
Adam
be
a
boy
but
the
event
of
recent
day
have
prove
that
the
flood
alleviation
work
have
work
very
well
for
the
town
.
the
flood
defence
for
the
first
phase
work
extremely
well
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
when
work
be
carry
out
successfully
.
I
humbly
give
praise
to
the
member
of
Mallow
Town
Council
and
its
staff
.
I
refer
to
George
O'Malley
and
the
lad
who
put
on
the
oilskin
and
go
out
year
after
year
when
flooding
occur
.
there
be
no
fuss
.
they
just
get
on
with
the
job
because
that
be
what
they
do
.
they
do
not
want
praise
for
it
but
that
work
be
worthy
of
acknowledgement
because
they
do
it
year
in
,
year
out
.
this
year
they
be
out
with
the
demountable
wall
,
work
with
the
area
and
town
engineer
,
and
have
that
defence
up
in
no
time
.
that
must
be
acknowledge
also
.
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
statement
on
the
start
of
phase
one
in
Fermoy
but
issue
remain
concern
the
clean
-
up
there
.
at
the
risk
of
be
parochial
,
both
side
of
the
river
,
particularly
at
Rathealy
Road
,
Francis
Street
,
Thomas
Street
,
Greenhill
and
Brian
Boru
Square
on
the
north
side
,
be
all
badly
affect
.
if
some
form
of
aid
be
to
be
make
available
,
I
ask
that
that
resident
be
eligible
for
it
,
as
should
the
people
on
the
south
side
,
particularly
at
Ashe
Quay
,
the
mart
road
,
O'Neill
Crowley
Quay
,
Elbow
Lane
and
Tallow
Road
,
which
be
all
badly
hit
.
it
have
be
say
to
I
that
the
Fermoy
flood
be
the
bad
in
the
past
25
year
.
that
should
be
on
the
record
because
while
we
agree
the
work
will
commence
shortly
in
Fermoy
,
some
damage
remain
arise
from
the
flood
work
in
that
area
.
I
ask
the
Department
to
examine
the
damage
that
have
be
do
and
look
favourably
on
the
resident
and
the
business
in
that
area
.
there
be
a
stoicism
among
people
who
be
bear
in
the
flood
,
so
to
speak
.
they
get
on
with
life
and
do
the
business
,
but
what
seem
to
have
characterise
the
flood
event
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country
be
that
they
would
not
normally
occur
in
that
area
.
while
we
will
deal
with
the
problem
in
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
and
I
visit
south
Galway
at
the
weekend
to
see
the
damage
do
,
it
be
vital
that
other
part
of
the
country
be
examine
in
the
same
way
as
Mallow
and
Fermoy
.
it
be
important
that
the
flood
alleviation
work
due
to
be
carry
out
in
Fermoy
do
not
compromise
the
amenity
that
be
the
rowing
club
.
there
be
proposal
to
carry
out
work
on
the
weir
on
the
Blackwater
in
Fermoy
but
we
be
concerned
they
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
rowing
club
.
I
be
aware
the
minister
make
some
public
statement
about
that
in
recent
day
and
I
hope
he
will
look
favourably
on
the
fact
that
there
be
a
rowing
club
in
the
area
and
that
this
amenity
cannot
be
compromise
in
any
way
.
it
be
particularly
ironic
that
some
member
of
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
blame
the
flooding
event
on
bad
planning
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
they
might
revisit
some
of
they
statement
in
that
sense
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Mansergh
,
state
that
development
on
flood
plain
should
be
avoid
,
where
possible
,
and
that
development
should
mitigate
,
not
add
to
,
exist
risk
.
Mallow
Town
park
be
locate
on
a
flood
plain
.
it
be
own
by
the
Jephson
family
,
which
also
own
Mallow
Castle
.
a
descendant
of
that
family
seek
to
have
the
Mallow
town
development
plan
materially
contraven
in
order
that
the
land
within
the
flood
plain
might
be
develop
.
there
have
be
a
constant
battle
on
Mallow
Town
Council
in
respect
of
this
matter
.
the
people
of
Mallow
want
to
ensure
that
the
park
will
be
hold
by
they
in
perpetuity
for
the
common
good
.
in
light
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
comment
,
will
the
government
entertain
the
possibility
of
compulsorily
purchase
the
land
in
question
in
order
that
it
might
be
hold
for
the
people
?

acknowledge
the

's
response

in

he
refer

importance

scheme

give
that
more

farmer
participate

have
participate
in

training
and
the
budget
be
approximately

250
million
,
would
the
minister
not
consider
increase
the
payment
from
€
40
to
€
60
per
head
in
the
come
year
because
of
the
difficulty
face
by
farmer
due
to
recent
adverse
weather
condition
and
the
state
of
the
market
?
farmer
have
a
deep
commitment
to
the
scheme
but
give
the
reduction
in
they
income
,
a
increase
in
this
payment
next
year
would
provide
a
major
buttress
against
loss
of
earnings
in
the
current
climate
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
answer
.
I
speak
to
this
issue
because
of
the
current
importance
of
the
export
market
.
it
be
a
very
productive
sector
and
any
input
now
or
in
the
next
two
year
will
be
vital
to
maintain
productivity
and
market
share
.
there
be
a
logic
to
maintain
the
scheme
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
give
a
commitment
to
maintain
the
scheme
and
to
review
the
payment
.
the
minister
mention
the
ICBF
.
its
recent
research
,
as
indicate
in
the
Irish
Farmers
's
Journal
of
last
week
,
suggest
that
the
cow
herd
have
shrink
by
6
%
this
year
.
that
could
have
negative
implication
for
the
future
of
the
export
market
.
be
the
minister
engage
with
the
farm
organisation
to
,
at
least
,
maintain
the
scheme
and
to
ensure
,
if
there
be
a
reduction
from
€
80
,
that
payment
will
continue
to
that
farmer
under
the
scheme
?
I
pose
this
question
on
the
last
occasion
the
minister
answer
question
and
I
get
the
exact
same
answer
as
he
have
impart
to
deputy
Cregan
.
I
note
he
say
that
a
meeting
take
place
on
2
November
.
what
be
the
outcome
of
that
meeting
?
will
the
stakeholder
group
,
the
consultative
group
,
engage
in
a
reporting
procedure
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
order
that
we
can
be
in
a
position
to
monitor
the
nature
of
deliberation
therein
?
we
be
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
abolition
of
quota
.
this
be
why
we
have
call
for
consultation
and
a
act
of
participation
.
it
be
important
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
would
feed
into
that
process
in
some
way
.
it
be
also
important
that
we
be
notify
of
the
ongoing
nature
of
the
consultation
.
do
the
Minster
invite
Teagasc
to
the
last
meeting
?
be
the
scientific
community
involved
in
this
process
as
a
active
participant
?
when
I
put
the
question
in
October
,
I
be
inform
it
would
be
invite
.
why
be
the
vast
bulk
of
the
population
not
drink
organic
milk
if
it
be
only
price
at
45
cent
per
litre
?
do
it
not
refer
to
the
current
market
price
for
a
litre
of
milk
in
the
shop
?
what
be
the
timeframe
with
regard
to
the
completion
of
the
process
?
I
tab
a
parliamentary
question
in
respect
of
how
this
matter
will
affect
north
Cork
—
—
—
—
and
the
minister
's
reply
indicate
that
it
be
propose
to
transfer
operation
there
to
Fermoy
.
have
consult
some
of
the
staff
in
Mallow
,
it
transpy
that
major
issue
have
arise
with
regard
to
the
move
to
Fermoy
.
how
definitive
be
the
decision
in
this
regard
?
what
consultation
take
place
in
respect
of
retain
the
staff
in
Mallow
and
transfer
operation
to
a
large
premise
there
?
I
assume
the
minister
in
he
reply
be
give
a
assurance
on
the
future
of
live
export
.
be
this
the
case
?
we
will
have
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
methane
emission
at
some
stage
.
what
be
the
minister
's
view
of
the
challenge
that
will
have
to
be
face
in
the
context
of
climate
change
?
concern
have
be
express
to
I
about
a
proposal
to
close
a
branch
office
of
the
Blackwater
Avondhu
Partnership
in
Mallow
.
some
member
of
the
board
be
concerned
about
the
proposal
because
the
office
in
Mallow
supervise
the
local
development
social
inclusion
programme
,
LDSIP
,
and
rural
transport
programme
.
I
attest
to
the
good
work
do
by
the
office
which
have
be
in
operation
since
1996
.
I
also
share
the
concern
communicate
to
I
by
board
member
about
the
closure
of
the
office
as
it
will
create
significant
potential
for
a
diminution
of
the
service
provide
in
the
Mallow
and
north
Cork
region
.
I
be
also
concerned
that
proposal
have
be
make
by
the
Blackwater
Avondhu
Partnership
to
instigate
a
round
of
voluntary
redundancy
in
advance
of
any
announcement
in
the
budget
of
a
reduction
of
a
ministerial
budget
line
for
such
group
to
provide
service
.
I
be
further
concerned
about
certain
corporate
governance
issue
which
arise
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
which
I
refer
.
at
the
most
recent
board
meeting
of
the
Blackwater
Avondhu
Partnership
,
it
be
communicate
to
member
that
no
decision
have
be
make
on
the
closure
of
the
Mallow
office
or
on
seek
a
round
of
voluntary
redundancy
.
despite
this
,
staff
have
be
notify
that
the
office
will
close
and
a
voluntary
redundancy
package
will
be
offer
.
they
must
give
they
decision
on
the
package
by
next
Monday
.
have
the
minister
give
a
direction
to
the
partnership
that
the
office
in
Mallow
should
close
?
have
the
board
or
chief
executive
officer
communicate
to
the
Department
a
intention
to
seek
voluntary
redundancy
?
have
the
department
communicate
with
the
partnership
about
the
need
to
seek
redundancy
and
close
one
of
its
operational
centre
,
namely
,
the
Mallow
office
?
I
ask
that
the
Department
give
the
board
of
Blackwater
Avondhu
Partnership
a
undertaking
that
all
rule
and
regulation
pertain
to
corporate
governance
procedure
will
be
adhere
to
as
regards
the
responsibility
of
the
board
,
as
distinct
from
the
chief
executive
officer
.
I
also
ask
that
the
Department
issue
guidance
to
the
board
in
this
respect
.
the
individual
who
communicate
with
I
be
board
member
.
while
some
of
they
vehemently
oppose
the
closure
of
the
Mallow
office
,
they
accept
the
argument
that
if
rationalisation
be
require
service
will
be
move
to
another
office
in
Fermoy
.
they
seek
to
ensure
that
the
process
apply
to
staff
member
in
the
Mallow
office
be
completely
transparent
,
the
wish
of
board
member
be
observe
and
no
person
or
person
act
in
a
unilateral
fashion
.
the
reason
I
see
fit
to
raise
this
issue
be
that
concern
have
arise
about
the
action
of
some
individual
with
regard
to
the
continuation
of
service
in
Mallow
.
I
share
this
concern
.
while
I
accept
that
we
live
in
constrain
time
and
the
amalgamation
of
two
entity
sometimes
cause
one
entity
to
suffer
,
I
be
adamant
that
the
LDSIP
,
a
phenomenally
successful
programme
,
should
continue
within
the
amalgamate
structure
.
the
rural
transport
programme
,
which
deliver
excellent
service
,
should
also
continue
,
as
should
the
other
service
such
as
that
at
the
Mallow
office
.
my
Department
be
currently
consider
a
number
of
broad
policy
issue
relate
to
the
recognition
process
for

be

by
Dr.
David
Madden
in
March
2000
,
state
:
child
benefit
in
Ireland
be
unlike
most
other
transfer
payment
in
two
respects
.
first
,
it
be
a
universal
non
means
-
test
payment
make
to
all
family
with
child
.
the
second
unusual
feature
regard
child
benefit
be
that
it
be
normally
pay
to
the
child
's
mother
or
step
-
mother
.
if
the
child
do
not
live
with
the
mother
or
step
-
mother
,
then
it
may
be
pay
to
the
child
's
father
or
step
-
father
.
the
report
continue
:
the
combination
of
this
two
factor
imply
that
analysis
of
child
benefit
and
the
pattern
of
expenditure
from
child
benefit
can
throw
light
on
a
number
of
feature
of
interest
.
the
first
of
this
concern
the
issue
of
within
household
allocation
.
much
economic
analysis
treat
the
family
as
the
unit
of
measurement
and
little
attention
be
pay
to
the
allocation
of
resource
within
the
household
.
since
child
benefit
be
pay
to
the
mother
then
analysis
of
how
it
be
spend
may
shed
light
on
the
degree
to
which
ownership
of
a
source
of
income
may
affect
its
use
.
Dr.
Madden
's
analysis
refer
to
a
report
publish
in
the
UK
,
which
show
how
:
a
change
in
the
payment
of
child
benefit
from
father
to
mother
lead
to
increase
expenditure
on
child
's
clothing
.
in
a
similar
vein
[
another
report
show
]
the
different
influence
of
male
and
female
income
on
pattern
of
household
expenditure
.
they
find
that
a
extra
unit
of
female
income
be
more
likely
to
be
spend
on
childcare
or
child
's
clothing
than
be
a
extra
unit
of
male
income
.
the
Madden
report
continue
:
if
the
propensity
to
consume
"
child
-
intensive
"
goods
such
as
food
or
child
's
clothing
be
high
from
child
benefit
than
other
source
of
income
then
it
seem
reasonable
to
infer
that
child
do
gain
disproportionately
from
child
benefit
.
the
universality
of
child
benefit
lend
itself
in
particular
to
the
analysis
of
this
issue
since
it
imply
that
apart
from
the
obvious
difference
of
have
child
,
family
receive
child
benefit
should
be
reasonably
representative
of
the
population
at
large
.
Dr.
Madden
also
refer
to
the
1994
Rottman
report
,
which
examine
some
of
this
issue
.
although
it
relate
to
a
original
survey
from
1987
,
I
suggest
that
the
same
principle
continue
to
apply
.
the
report
state
:
he
use
a
sample
of
625
household
who
be
part
of
a
follow
-
up
to
a
major
survey
carry
out
by
the
economic
and
social
Research
Institute
in
1987
.
he
find
that
the
source
of
income
appear
to
be
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
share
of
resource
.
household
with
income
derive
mainly
from
social
welfare
source
share
about
33
%
of
they
income
compare
with
a
average
of
about
63
%
for
other
household
.
with
regard
to
child
benefit
household
appear
to
divide
fairly
evenly
between
that
who
use
it
for
general
household
spending
and
that
who
use
it
for
child
specific
goods
.
that
breakdown
be
sensitive
however
to
who
control
the
spending
of
child
benefit
.
where
it
be
jointly
control
there
be
a
significantly
low
proportion
spend
on
child
's
goods
as
oppose
to
the
case
where
the
wife
[
I
assume
he
mean
"
partner
"
]
control
child
benefit
.
he
also
find
that
when
ask
how
a
windfall
increase
of
£
20
per
month
in
household
income
would
be
spend
,
18
%
of
wife
list
child
's
clothing
as
a
priority
as
oppose
to
10
%
of
husband
.
a
total
of
18
%
of
wife
list
child
's
clothing
as
a
priority
,
as
oppose
to
10
%
of
husband
.
the
fundamental
point
here
be
that
this
a
payment
to
woman
for
they
child
.
it
be
use
in
household
for
child
,
be
protect
by
woman
for
they
child
and
go
directly
towards
the
welfare
of
child
.
although
this
study
may
be
date
,
I
believe
it
stand
the
test
of
time
.
if
the
payment
go
to
woman
for
the
welfare
of
child
,
then
there
be
a
logical
case
for
it
to
be
preserve
,
as
have
already
be
elucidate
by
my
colleague
.
that
be
we
central
point
.
my
Department
's
primary
role
in
the
promotion
of
international
education
be
co-ordination
and
policy
development
,
and
Departmental
official
be
not
second
to
Irish
embassy
for
this
purpose
.
under
the
new
arrangement
which
I
have
recently
put
in
place
to
promote
Ireland
as
a
centre
for
international
education
,
Enterprise
Ireland
have
be
give
operational
responsibility
,
under
my
authority
,
for
the
marketing
and
promotion
of
the
"
Education
Ireland
"
brand
overseas
and
the
development
,
promotion
and
marketing
of
international
high
education
.
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
include
Ireland
's
network
of
diplomatic
mission
,
also
play
a
key
role
in
promote
international
education
,
include
through
awareness
-
raising
,
support
ministerial
visit
,
maintain
contact
with
overseas
government
ministry
and
education
agency
and
lend
support
and
assistance
to
visit
Irish
institution
;
it
work
very
closely
with
Enterprise
Ireland
in
this
regard
.
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
be
represent
on
the
inter-agency
group
on
international
education
which
my
Department
chair
,
and
will
also
be
represent
on
the
high
-
level
group
on
international
education
.
in
order
to
ensure
full
awareness
of
the
issue
involve
in
international
education
,
my
Department
provide
a
full
briefing
to
Irish
Ambassador
and
other
diplomat
prior
to
they
departure
on
overseas
post
.
I
support
the
amendment
.
the
minister
of
State
speak
of
the
Aarhus
Convention
.
to
my
mind
,
that
be
a
minimal
set
of
standard
.
in
this
amendment
we
seek
to
buttress
that
even
further
to
provide
for
some
degree
of
democratic
accountability
.
it
also
speak
to
the
issue
raise
by
deputy
Ferris
whereby
if
it
be
a
reserve
function
,
one
be
guarantee
it
will
be
wholly
democratic
and
wholly
representative
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
250
to
255
,
inclusive
,
together
.
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
regard
the
number
of
teacher
pay
pass
or
honour
degree
allowance
and
teaching
the
specific
subject
refer
to
be
not
available
from
my
Department
payroll
database
.
however
,
there
be
six
thousand
nine
hundred
and
eighty
two
teacher
employ
in
secondary
community
or
comprehensive
school
in
receipt
of
pass
degree
allowance
.
there
be
eight
thousand
eight
hundred
and
seventy
four
in
receipt
of
honour
degree
allowance
.
my
department
be
obtain
information
from
the
Teaching
Council
in
relation
to
the
number
of
register
teacher
hold
honour
or
pass
degree
in
the
subject
area
refer
to
.
I
will
arrange
for
that
information
to
be
forward
to
the
deputy
.
Proinsias
de
Rossa
never
take
money
off
the
poor
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
speech
where
he
say
that
recent
CSO
datum
show
that
44
%
of
cross
-border
shopper
buy
alcohol
.
this
assume
that
56
%
do
not
buy
alcohol
and
it
presuppose
that
some
people
's
motivation
for
go
across
the
Border
be
primarily
to
buy
alcohol
.
I
do
not
think
it
warrant
the
measure
produce
here
.
there
be
other
way
of
tackle
the
tide
or
stem
the
flow
across
the
Border
.
as
my
colleague
have
also
mention
,
regard
the
cut
in
public
sector
pay
,
5
%
on
a
salary
of
€
35000
,
will
reduce
the
salary
by
€
1500
.
how
in
the
name
of
God
will
that
kind
of
a
reduction
allow
anybody
—
—
—
—
with
a
mortgage
and
child
to
be
able
to
live
any
kind
of
a
decent
life
in
this
country
?
be
this
what
this
republic
have
be
reduce
to
?
it
be
a
absolute
shame
.
it
be
a
bit
surreal
to
see
—
—
—
—
Fianna
Fáil
so
silent
on
this
matter
.
I
refer
to
the
effect
the
carbon
tax
will
have
on
a
public
sector
employee
earn
€
30000
a
year
whose
income
will
be
reduce
by
€
1500
.
the
effect
of
the
carbon
tax
on
vulnerable
,
low
pay
people
will
be
more
pronounce
as
a
result
of
the
cut
that
have
be
effect
.
we
want
the
government
to
do
something
in
real
term
for
they
.
the
budget
be
predicate
on
reduce
the
income
of
the
low
pay
.
the
introduction
of
the
carbon
tax
without
mitigating
its
effect
on
that
on
low
income
be
inequitable
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
address
this
.
this
have
to
be
address
in
concrete
term
,
not
in
nebulous
or
airy
-
fairy
term
.
this
be
about
real
people
whose
income
be
minuscule
and
the
minister
be
further
marginalise
they
and
cut
they
off
through
imposition
of
this
tax
.
the
Green
Party
minister
do
not
realise
it
because
they
be
on
another
planet
.
they
do
not
inhabit
the
real
world
.
there
be
people
in
the
real
world
outside
this
wall
who
have
be
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
by
minister
who
be
off
save
the
planet
.
they
should
have
a
reality
check
.
we
do
not
oppose
the
carbon
tax
but
we
do
not
want
people
on
low
income
to
be
screw
to
the
wall
.

the
poor

that
be
not
what
the
minister
indicate
.
I
wish
to
be
helpful
to
the
minister
and
in
no
way
to
appear
facetious
,
but
the
process
be
instigate
by
the
former
Minister
for
social
Welfare
,
Proinsias
de
Rossa
.
a
sum
of
€
400000
plus
.
if
that
on
jobseeker
's
benefit
aged
under
24
be
reside
with
they
parent
,
will
there
be
a
pro
rata
cut
to
reflect
the
parent
's
mean
?
I
have
receive
more
and
more
call
from
parent
whose
son
or
daughter
recently
leave
college
and
be
live
at
home
.
they
have
a
high
dependency
on
the
parental
income
to
give
they
spending
power
.
how
will
they
be
affect
?
the
reduction
in
income
for
claimant
in
this
category
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
because
the
minister
's
announcement
about
additional
training
place
have
not
be
set
out
in
concrete
form
.
we
do
not
know
what
shape
the
place
will
take
or
whether
a
demographic
or
qualitative
study
have
be
conduct
as
to
who
in
this
category
would
sloot
into
the
place
.
we
do
not
know
how
they
will
sloot
in
or
what
type
of
course
they
will
take
up
.
this
be
ill
think
out
.
the
overarching
philosophy
of
the
minister
be
to
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
that
who
most
need
that
marginal
income
without
any
thought
or
lateral
view
of
how
this
might
impact
on
they
.
will
the
minister
outline
how
this
cut
will
affect
that
people
if
they
parent
's
income
be
above
a
certain
level
?
I
fear
for
they
.
for
example
,
if
a
parent
who
work
in
the
public
sector
have
a
income
up
to
€
40000
per
annum
and
have
a
son
or
daughter
who
have
just
graduate
,
it
be
most
likely
that
son
or
daughter
be
now
live
at
home
because
he
or
she
can
not
get
a
job
.
if
that
graduate
son
or
daughter
cannot
find
a
adequate
training
place
because
,
as
have
be
state
,
he
or
she
be
over
qualified
for
the
training
position
,
will
he
or
she
now
be
penalise
through
a
reduce
payment
because
of
refuse
a
training
place
?
what
negative
effect
will
this
have
on
they
income
if
they
live
at
home
.
this
be
issue
of
concern
.
in
talk
about
active
labour
market
mechanism
for
people
who
be
under
the
age
of
25
,
the
minister
should
have
think
a
little
more
laterally
about
put
some
well
think
out
scheme
in
place
before
effect
a
cut
.
deputy
Gogarty
have
now
acquire
a
God
complex
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
if
one
be
shove
somebody
—
—
there
be
approximately
69500
people
aged
under
24
on
the
live
register
.
the
minister
for
Finance
claim
in
he
speech
that
he
will
make
26000
training
place
available
.
therefore
,
we
cannot
force
all
of
that
people
into
training
scheme
because
there
be
simply
not
enough
place
.
many
of
that
be
graduate
who
will
be
over
qualified
for
the
type
of
training
place
I
imagine
will
be
envisage
under
this
proposal
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
parent
,
especially
that
in
the
public
sector
who
be
in
the
€
30000
-
45,000
income
bracket
and
who
have
see
they
income
reduce
,
will
see
a
further
squeeze
on
they
finances
if
they
have
child
who
have
recently
graduate
live
at
home
who
may
not
fit
the
type
of
training
scheme
that
be
envisage
.
under
section
3
,
the
minister
have
already
acknowledge
there
will
be
a
pro
rata
decrease
,
depend
on
means
.
I
understand
that
the
minimum
amount
for
which
somebody
live
at
home
could
be
eligible
be
about
€
30
.
that
be
pocket
money
and
it
reduce
the
dignity
of
people
who
qualify
from
third
level
education
and
who
continue
to
live
at
home
.
there
be
over
69000
people
aged
under
24
on
the
live
register
and
a
significant
number
of
they
be
graduate
who
can
not
get
a
job
.
the
logical
conclusion
—
I
say
this
rationally
and
without
emotion
—
be
that
many
of
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
will
be
oblige
to
migrate
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
to
obtain
employment
.
in
the
past
ten
year
,
Australia
be
the
new
Klondike
and
it
be
a
good
place
for
people
in
they
early
20
to
go
.
however
,
this
choice
be
no
long
available
because
the
employment
situation
in
Australia
be
not
as
good
as
previously
.
it
appear
Canada
be
the
new
Klondike
for
many
people
.
however
,
employment
opportunity
there
will
also
soon
dry
up
.
as
a
result
,
a
significant
number
of
people
under
the
age
of
25
will
be
oblige
to
reside
at
home
with
they
parent
.
this
individual
will
be
oblige
to
survive
on
income
of
€
30
or
€
40
per
week
and
this
will
place
a
increase
burden
on
they
parent
.
what
we
need
in
the
budget
be
some
degree
of
programming
which
would
ensure
that
people
would
not
be
oblige
to
take
up
position
on
Mickey
Mouse
course
in
order
to
maintain
they
social
welfare
payment
.
the
government
should
have
put
in
place
a
proper
,
well
think
out
,
structure
programme
of
internship
.
this
would
have
allow
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
to
use
the
knowledge
and
qualification
they
possess
.
the
minister
should
think
about
thing
in
a
more
lateral
fashion
.
if
she
be
go
to
put
in
place
scheme
,
this
should
be
properly
think
out
.
person
's
entitlement
should
not
be
cut
until
they
can
be
give
position
on
meaningful
course
or
be
provide
with
internship
.
if
they
be
afford
such
opportunity
,
it
will
assist
they
in
get
back
into
the
workplace
.

what
about
we
old
people
?
this
Bill
be
draft
by
a
generation
of
politician
and
mandarin
who
have
they
mortgage
pay
and
have
,
for
the
most
part
,
rear
they
child
.
it
show
blatant
disregard
for
people
of
my
generation
who
will
end
up
be
saddle
with
the
burden
of
the
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
for
the
rest
of
they
work
life
.
if
we
be
to
inject
some
equity
into
the
process
of
economic
recovery
,
it
must
be
do
on
the
basis
that
everybody
will
take
the
pain
equally
.
one
cannot
take
€
1500
from
somebody
in
the
public
sector
who
be
earn
€
30000
or
€
1,875
from
somebody
who
be
earn
€
35000
,
while
introduce
a
carbon
tax
which
will
affect
the
ability
of
such
people
to
get
to
and
from
they
place
of
work
on
a
daily
basis
.
such
people
will
also
be
affect
by
the
impact
on
they
of
the
potential
mortgage
increase
they
may
incur
in
the
future
.
I
have
a
short
time
in
which
to
speak
on
this
issue
.
it
be
a
sad
indictment
of
this
Parliament
that
we
cannot
debate
this
measure
in
a
proper
fashion
with
real
discourse
.
the
strike
by
the
public
sector
be
ill
-
time
,
in
that
we
all
have
to
buy
into
the
idea
that
there
would
be
a
reduction
in
the
public
sector
pay
bill
.
I
also
believe
in
the
bona
fide
of
a
government
and
a
trade
union
hierarchy
to
hammer
out
a
deal
that
would
ensure
that
earn
income
of
less
then
€
50000
would
not
incur
any
further
pain
as
a
result
of
measure
which
might
have
to
be
implement
and
that
earn
between
€
50000
and
€
100000
,
would
have
a
minuscule
percentage
cut
in
they
salary
and
they
would
be
benchmark
against
cut
in
the
private
sector
.
we
have
a
situation
whereby
a
single
person
who
earn
€
52000
per
annum
in
the
private
sector
incur
no
cut
to
he
or
she
salary
,
but
somebody
who
earn
€
50000
in
the
public
sector
will
incur
a
cut
of
€
3000
or
6
%
.
there
be
no
equity
in
such
a
situation
.
if
anybody
in
the
government
tell
we
that
everybody
have
to
incur
pain
,
the
proof
of
that
view
be
not
evident
in
such
budgetary
measure
.
I
be
quote
from
the
very
document
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Lenihan
,
lay
before
the
House
when
he
announce
he
budget
last
week
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
a
review
of
the
cut
to
people
on
the
low
end
of
the
public
sector
wage
scale
.
one
cannot
expect
a
single
female
clerical
officer
who
work
in
a
local
authority
,
have
take
out
a
mortgage
in
the
past
three
year
and
now
have
to
pay
increase
charge
for
she
petrol
to
get
to
work
to
incur
a
cut
of
€
1500
to
€
2200
in
she
salary
.
it
be
completely
inequitable
.
I
know
it
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Mansergh
,
in
he
heart
of
heart
,
know
it
.
I
believe
he
word
be
correct
,
he
tell
we
to
reverse
the
cut
would
cost
the
Exchequer
€
500
million
.
he
never
examine
the
quasi-autonomous
non-governmental
organisation
.
he
do
not
adequately
examine
that
earn
more
than
€
250000
.
it
be
time
the
government
look
equitably
at
that
who
will
now
bear
the
brunt
.
the
new
poor
now
exist
in
we
society
.
a
person
who
incur
a
cut
of
€
1500
will
not
be
able
to
survive
in
real
term
and
the
government
should
not
patronise
such
people
by
tell
they
it
have
reduce
the
cost
of
live
by
6
%
because
that
will
not
wash
.

perhaps
I
be
a
product
of
my
agrarian
or
peasant
root
,
but
—
—
—
—-
I
believe
we
need
to
start
slaughter
a
few
sacred
cow
in
this
great
republic
of
ours
.
when
somebody
in
the
public
service
have
to
incur
a
cut
of
€
1
,
500
in
he
or
she
salary
and
a
member
of
the
Judiciary
be
exempt
by
virtue
of
a
constitutional
arrangement
,
that
speak
volume
about
the
nature
of
the
society
in
the
Republic
.
if
Ireland
,
as
a
republic
,
be
to
treat
and
cherish
everybody
equally
,
and
if
we
subscribe
to
the
French
principle
of
liberté
,
None
and
fraternité
of
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
of
State
be
aware
,
then
we
should
have
no
qualm
in
this
troubling
time
about
reduce
the
salary
of
the
member
of
the
Judiciary
.
I
believe
we
be
unduly
deferential
to
people
who
hold
such
position
.
while
we
be
respectful
of
the
role
they
have
and
of
the
constitutional
arrangement
as
regards
the
separation
of
power
,
I
do
not
believe
they
should
be
exempt
from
such
cut
by
virtue
of
a
legal
advice
that
have
be
give
to
the
government
.
we
rely
too
much
on
such
legal
advice
matter
and
hold
they
in
too
great
a
stock
,
because
sometimes
they
supersede
what
be
fair
and
equitable
in
term
of
how
the
common
man
or
woman
might
perceive
such
question
.
I
gladly
support
the
amendment
that
have
be
tab
on
the
basis
of
it
be
equitable
and
right
for
this
country
at
this
time
.

the
Bill
allow
Coillte
to
increase
its
requirement
significantly
.
in
that
light
,
the
amount
of
time
designate
for
the
Bill
be
far
too
short
.
we
need
a
proper
and
lengthy
debate
on
the
nature
and
working
of
Coillte
.
on
the
same
issue
,
what
credence
do
this
house
give
to
a
ombudsman
's
report
?
if
we
do
not
respond
to
the
ombudsman
's
report
,
it
would
be
a
dereliction
of
duty
.
it
be
right
and
proper
that
this
house
give
some
time
to
debate
the
issue
at
least
.
she
be
very
expensive
.
I
find
myself
in
a
ludicrous
situation
in
that
I
must
thank
deputy
Creed
for
allow
I
some
of
he
time
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
allow
some
of
my
time
to
deputy
Ferris
,
with
whom
I
be
to
share
my
time
.
why
do
we
find
ourselves
in
circumstance
where
I
have
merely
two
or
three
minute
to
discuss
a
princely
sum
that
could
potentially
amount
to
€400
million
?
I
do
not
have
adequate
time
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
ceo
of
Coillte
be
be
pay
over
€
400000
at
a
time
when
the
subsidiary
under
Coillte
be
completely
under
-
perform
,
nor
do
I
have
time
to
analyse
properly
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
,
in
which
he
state
€
1.89
billion
,
or
just
under
1
%
of
gdp
,
be
attribute
to
forestry
.
that
figure
be
from
2008
but
it
will
be
reduce
significantly
in
the
future
give
that
the
subsidiary
be
under-
perform
.
I
want
time
to
discuss
this
in
great
detail
.
I
also
want
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
Forest
Stewardship
Council
audite
Coillte
in
2006
and
that
this
be
not
mention
in
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
.
the
result
of
the
audit
cast
a
poor
light
on
some
of
Coillte
's
practice
that
be
worthy
of
consideration
in
respect
of
this
Bill
.
I
want
to
discuss
the
fact
that
Coillte
be
currently
be
audite
by
the
Forest
Stewardship
Council
.
will
the
minister
expound
on
that
process
?
if
there
be
time
,
I
will
allow
some
to
deputy
Ferris
.
the
Bill
seek
the
permission
of
the
House
to
afford
to
Coillte
the
opportunity
to
increase
its
statutory
borrowing
requirement
from
€
101.5
million
to
€400
million
.
in
he
second
stage
speech
,
the
Minister
of
State
point
out
that
inflation
alone
would
allow
a
increase
in
the
borrowing
limit
to
€
182.5
million
.
this
be
base
on
inflate
the
€
101.5
million
limit
in
1988
by
Ireland
's
inflation
rate
up
to
October
2009
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
we
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
that
assertion
?
Coillte
's
borrowing
to
the
end
of
1988
be
€
161.2
million
and
it
have
approval
to
borrow
up
to
€
260
million
under
section
24
(
1
)
and
(
2
)
of
the
Forestry
Act
1988
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
a
good
overview
of
Coillte
's
working
,
the
direction
it
want
to
take
in
corporate
planning
and
the
working
group
establish
to
review
its
operation
.
there
be
no
mention
,
however
,
of
the
pension
deficit
,
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
company
's
operation
,
or
the
chief
executive
officer
's
and
the
board
's
remuneration
.
there
be
also
question
surround
a
Forestry
Stewardship
Council
report
which
indict
some
aspect
of
Coillte
's
operation
.
the
Labour
Party
would
be
reluctant
to
support
any
mechanism
to
allow
for
a
increase
in
a
company
's
borrowing
requirement
unless
there
be
some
degree
of
transparency
in
its
operation
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
second
Stage
speech
do
not
sufficiently
address
this
matter
.
the
company
's
report
and
account
also
do
not
address
this
issue
.
when
Coillte
attend
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
October
,
one
get
the
impression
everything
be
rosy
in
the
garden
.
there
be
,
however
,
some
difficulty
for
ancillary
firm
such
as
Mediate
and
other
with
the
downturn
in
the
construction
industry
and
this
be
reflect
in
they
result
.
what
be
the
future
for
this
firm
?
I
do
not
see
enough
report
back
to
this
House
on
how
this
operation
will
proceed
and
they
individual
financial
position
.
be
the
new
borrowing
requirement
to
facilitate
any
of
this
offshoot
company
?
what
will
the
nature
of
they
financial
position
be
as
a
result
of
this
amending
legislation
?
before
the
House
be
request
to
up
Coillte
's
borrowing
requirement
,
it
require
more
information
as
to
how
it
do
business
.
person
tend
to
look
favourably
on
Coillte
's
operation
because
of
the
recreational
and
amenity
value
of
its
work
.
I
have
benefit
from
they
myself
in
the
Ballyhouras
and
there
be
a
certain
pride
in
how
Coillte
have
develop
amenity
well
.
with
the
Copenhagen
summit
agenda
,
there
be
the
political
consideration
of
the
role
of
forestry
in
reduce
or
offset
co2
emission
.
will
the
increase
in
permissible
borrowing
go
towards
facilitate
this
process
?
if
so
,
will
Coillte
have
a
significant
role
in
that
process
?
I
would
also
like
the
Minister
of
State
to
address
the
issue
of
the
role
of
the
Forestry
Stewardship
Council
.
it
be
hope
,
give
the
2006
report
and
the
audit
under
way
,
that
there
would
be
significant
improvement
in
corporate
social
responsibility
and
the
role
of
corporate
governance
in
respect
of
how
Coillte
perform
its
function
.
fundamentally
,
we
need
a
little
more
transparency
in
regard
to
the
operation
of
Coillte
.
while
we
all
believe
that
it
be
a
force
to
do
good
,
there
be
aspect
of
its
operation
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
leave
doubt
in
one
's
mind
.
be
the
agency
to
be
a
little
more
transparent
there
would
be
a
great
deal
more
goodwill
towards
measure
such
as
this
.
I
refer
to
the
issue
of
inflation
,
the
1988
Act
and
the
minister
's
response
to
question
put
.
my
understanding
of
the
Forestry
Act
1988
be
that
at
any
one
time
the
aggregate
borrowing
of
the
company
should
not
exceed
£
80
million
or
€
101.5
million
in
today
's
money
.
the
Minister
of
State
state
borrowing
have
reach
€
182.5
million
in
October
2009
and
that
this
be
account
for
by
inflation
.
perhaps
I
misunderste
the
legislation
or
I
be
naive
but
my
understanding
be
the
figure
set
out
in
the
1988
act
be
finite
and
definitive
and
that
there
be
no
allowance
for
inflation
within
the
1988
Act
.
perhaps
my
interpretation
be
wrong
and
,
if
so
,
I
will
stand
correct
.
if
borrowing
increase
beyond
the
limit
at
any
time
between
1988
and
2009
there
should
have
be
a
amendment
to
the
1988
act
to
facilitate
such
a
change
long
before
now
.
the
importance
of
the
point
be
that
if
the
Minister
of
State
allow
for
inflation
or
if
such
a
measure
be
not
in
the
1988
Act
,
then
the
government
should
have
amend
the
legislation
long
before
now
and
this
raise
a
question
over
any
borrowing
in
excess
of
€
101.5
million
in
the
intervene
period
.
will
the
minister
of
State
clarify
this
for
my
satisfaction
and
understanding
?
I
refer
to
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
,
which
be
reasonable
because
the
tone
of
the
debate
from
the
Opposition
side
of
the
House
have
be
such
to
ensure
Coillte
be
subject
to
a
great
degree
of
scrutiny
.
as
we
state
,
Coillte
be
before
the
committee
and
there
be
no
mention
of
potential
for
increase
its
borrowing
requirement
at
that
stage
.
that
throw
up
a
question
about
the
role
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
when
witness
from
the
semi-State
sector
report
to
the
committee
,
be
they
oblige
,
in
the
interest
of
transparency
,
to
let
member
know
what
they
strategic
requirement
be
,
particularly
with
regard
to
borrowing
?
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
.
question
regard
the
remuneration
of
the
chief
executive
officer
and
other
high
-
rank
staff
be
not
answer
adequately
by
the
Minister
of
State
.
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
the
borrowing
be
for
the
purpose
of
remuneration
or
to
meet
deficit
in
the
pension
.
I
understand
the
Minister
of
State
say
this
would
be
deal
with
in
further
legislation
but
it
be
also
pertinent
to
this
Bill
,
in
particular
,
to
the
amendment
put
down
by
Fine
Gael
and
support
by
the
Labour
Party
.

I
seek
the
adjournment
of

to
raise
a
matter

importance
,
namely
,
the
current
appalling
condition
of
road
in
County
Cork
;
and
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Transport
to
increase
funding
for
the
maintenance
of
county
and
non-national
road
in
that
county
,
and
to
examine
why
the
road
network
in
County
Cork
be
severely
under
-
fund
and
why
funding
for
roadway
in
Cork
be
considerably
low

compare

the

no

be
make
directly

's
School
Transport
section

.
that
be
extremely
disingenuous
.
where
else
in
the
world
would
a
government
hide
behind
a
Supreme
Court
judgment
and
use
it
as
a
excuse
for
not
hold
a
open
and
inform
inquiry
?
in
no
other
liberal
democracy
would
a
minister
for
finance
stand
before
the
legislature
and
,
in
address
he
justification
for
a
inquiry
behind
close
door
,
refer
in
one
form
or
another
and
on
no
less
than
six
occasion
to
the
global
international
crisis
,
while
omit
to
refer
to
the
political
climate
underpin
the
anatomy
of
the
crisis
or
the
political
decision
make
that
be
inherent
to
its
very
character
.
it
be
extraordinary
that
the
commission
of
investigation
will
not
reach
into
the
domestic
political
decision
which
give
rise
to
the
crisis
.
that
minister
for
Finance
will
not
be
subject
to
examination
or
hold
accountable
for
they
action
be
ludicrous
.
I
be
not
sure
if
deputy
on
the
government
bench
be
aware
of
how
ridiculous
this
sound
to
people
.
the
Labour
Party
do
not
seek
retribution
,
a
issue
allude
to
by
other
,
but
it
be
entitle
to
seek
to
have
answer
provide
in
public
to
question
surround
the
role
of
the
Financial
Regulator
.
why
be
the
regulator
able
to
ride
out
of
"
Dodge
City
"
with
a
€
600,000
pay
-
out
without
be
subject
to
a
analysis
of
he
performance
or
at
least
some
scrutiny
of
he
decision
?
we
also
seek
a
answer
in
public
to
the
question
as
to
why
Anglo
Irish
Bank
continue
to
exist
.
we
want
to
know
the
reason
analyst
in
the
city
of
London
be
bay
for
a
kill
when
a
substantial
shareholder
in
the
bank
could
no
long
cover
he
position
.
how
could
one
individual
build
up
a
stake
of
28
%
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
through
numerous
contract
for
difference
?
the
hedge
fund
have
a
field
day
on
that
issue
and
no
one
in
the
Office
of
the
Financial
Regulator
call
time
on
the
madness
.
I
be
sure
we
will
never
know
the
reason
because
a
open
inquiry
will
not
allow
we
to
ask
this
very
question
.
instead
,
we
will
have
to
continue
to
read
the
business
page
of
the
broadsheet
newspaper
to
glean
the
knowledge
we
so
desperately
need
to
make
honest
appraisal
.
if
there
be
a
sound
economic
logic
for
the
continuance
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
,
let
the
case
be
make
publicly
in
order
that
that
who
elect
we
can
adjudicate
for
themselves
.
as
a
society
we
need
to
learn
valuable
lesson
from
this
period
in
we
economic
history
.
we
want
minister
for
finance
to
be
subject
to
rigorous
question
in
the
public
interest
.
the
only
way
we
can
achieve
this
be
through
a
transparent
process
that
stand
up
to
political
scrutiny
.
by
not
have
this
inquiry
in
public
we
add
to
the
moral
turpitude
that
have
underpin
this
society
for
too
long
.
we
want
the
fact
to
fit
the
preconception
.
as
long
as
a
veil
of
secrecy
exist
,
we
will
not
make
the
change
that
be
necessary
to
move
on
in
a
real
sense
.

up
to
€
30
million
on
primary
producer
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
the
current
traceability
regime
be
adequate
and
that
it
be
ludicrous
that
any
European
Union
proposal
would
seek
to
electronically
tag
any
animal
for
the
purpose
of
meet
some
bureaucratic
designation
?
be
the
assumption
of
€
1
million
industry
-
wide
or
be
it
divide
by
30000
sheep
farmer
?
be
that
the
basis
of
the
minister
's
claim
?
do
the
European
Commission
put
forward
this
proposal
in
2003
or
do
it
come
directly
from
a
Council
of
Minister
initiative
?
I
would
like
to
know
the
Council
's
state
reason
for
refuse
the
derogation
on
the
Irish
position
.
the
minister
's
response
be
utterly
disingenuous
.
would
he
not
acknowledge
the
fact
that
justice
have
not
be
serve
for
the
Byrne
family
,
who
have
no
way
of
know
the
term
of
the
scheme
and
no
way
of
benefit
by
way
of
tonnage
under
the
scheme
for
the
reason
outline
by
the
ombudsman
?
she
find
that
the
advertising
process
be
utterly
inadequate
and
the
family
have
no
way
of
benefit
from
the
scheme
as
a
result
.
would
the
minister
acknowledge
that
she
decision
to
grant
compensation
be
base
on
she
acknowledgement
of
the
wrong
that
be
do
and
that
there
be
no
way
the
family
could
benefit
from
tonnage
?
the
Ombudsman
find
that
some
prospective
applicant
be
put
in
a
more
advantageous
position
than
other
as
they
be
write
to
by
the
Department
and
the
minister
to
inform
they
of
the
scheme
when
it
be
launch
.
the
minister
must
respond
on
this
matter
.
third
,
the
very
fact
that
the
Ombudsman
deem
it
necessary
to
place
the
report
before
the
House
must
be
significant
.
the
government
side
of
the
House
be
disregard
and
disrespect
the
decision
of
the
Ombudsman
and
the
minister
must
answer
for
that
.
to
suggest
it
be
incumbent
on
every
applicant
to
read
the
fishing
press
be
a
disgrace
.
in
this
situation
,
a
father
have
pass
away
as
well
as
three
crew
and
a
brother
.
do
the
minister
think
they
extend
family
would
be
read
the
fishing
press
?
what
we
be
seek
here
be
natural
justice
.
this
be
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
the
Ombudsman
,
a
independent
arbiter
,
have
make
a
ruling
in
the
case
.
on
this
basis
,
we
be
seek
to
press
the
Department
for
a
change
of
heart
so
this
family
can
benefit
from
natural
justice
,
as
well
as
other
people
who
might
be
adversely
affect
by
this
scheme
.
certain
people
get
a
head
-
up
from
source
about
the
scheme
.
deputy
Cuffe
ask
a
question
on
the
possibility
of
establish
a
code
of
practice
or
ombudsman
.
the
second
proposal
be
the
wrong
approach
.
do
the
minister
of
State
agree
that
a
code
of
practice
would
not
be
worth
the
paper
it
be
write
on
until
such
time
as
a
legislative
mechanism
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
primary
producer
of
animal
and
vegetable
be
give
a
fair
crack
of
the
whip
in
term
of
secure
a
fair
percentage
of
the
market
price
for
they
product
?
the
Minister
of
State
indicate
that
200
producer
enjoy
a
share
of
the
€
8
million
provide
in
grant
aid
.
will
he
provide
a
breakdown
of
the
figure
?
do
potato
grower
feature
among
this
coterie
of
beneficiary
?
be
deputy
Cuffe
satisfied
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
?
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
some
of
the
problem
encounter
by
the
pig
and
food
industry
be
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
legislation
on
packaging
have
not
be
amend
and
that
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
still
impact
on
the
comparative
advantage
Irish
producer
might
enjoy
if
the
issue
be
to
be
sort
out
?
in
that
review
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
recognise
that
€
1450
be
too
modest
a
grant
sum
because
the
input
cost
be
high
enough
for
individual
farmer
who
might
wish
to
move
into
grow
miscanthus
.
if
the
sum
be
to
be
increase
it
would
encourage
more
grower
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
the
potential
of
miscanthus
especially
for
the
manufacture
of
pellet
and
firelog
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
outline
.
demand
be
grow
exponentially
and
on
a
almost
weekly
basis
.
the
delay
do
not
relate
to
miscanthus
be
bring
to
market
but
rather
it
revolve
around
try
to
encourage
more
farmer
to
grow
it
.
the
only
way
to
achieve
the
latter
be
to
provide
a
great
incentive
at
the
start
-
up
point
.
I
,
therefore
,
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
consider
increase
the
start
-
up
grant
.
I
accept
that
a
marketing
exercise
will
have
to
be
undertake
.
however
,
a
great
deal
of
micromarketing
be
take
place
in
various
region
—
Limerick
and
east
Cork
be
two
example
of
which
I
be
aware
—
in
respect
of
certain
sector
.
that
involve
in
the
industry
have
inform
I
that
if
the
start
-
up
grant
pay
to
farmer
be
increase
,
and
if
a
proper
education
process
to
accompany
this
be
put
in
place
,
this
will
be
of
major
assistance
to
local
or
micromarketing
initiative
.
with
respect
,
we
should
not
discuss
this
matter
in
a
aspirational
way
.
let
we
put
we
money
where
we
mouth
be
and
invest
in
the
industry
.
Miscanthus
be
both
a
carbon
offset
plant
and
a
fuel
source
and
it
offer
massive
potential
.
we
should
display
a
great
deal
more
urgency
in
the
context
of
how
we
promote
the
grow
of
this
plant
.

the

I
raise
this
matter

the
potential
for
exploitation

I
call
on
the
Tánaiste

trade

,
deputy
Mary
Coughlan
,
to
instigate
a
review

this
do
not

I
understand
that

employer
have
sign

for

under
which
they
can
employ
a
full
-
time
worker

.
it
do
not
cost
the

a

;
the

foot
the

offer
that
who
secure

a
weekly
payment
of
approximately
€
200
,
which
be
considerably
less
than
the
minimum
wage
.
the
aim
of
the
scheme
be
to
allow
graduate
and
other
person
to
learn
a
new
skill
and
gain
experience
,
which
be
important
in
the
current
climate
.
however
,
many
of
the
job
advertisement
under
the
work
placement
programme
specify
that
the
candidate
must
be
experience
and
,
in
some
case
,
that
he
or
she
must
be
able
to
work
unsupervised
.
this
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
programme
.
there
be
currently
over
800
work
placement
programme
job
list
in
the
FÁS
job
bank
.
among
this
position
be
sale
representative
,
receptionist
,
caretaker
,
laundry
operative
and
construction
worker
.
there
be
a
six
-
to
nine
-
month
training
period
for
each
of
this
job
.
the
question
arise
of
whether
work
in
a
laundry
for
six
to
nine
month
will
offer
any
real
progression
and
thus
whether
such
job
be
of
any
real
value
for
graduate
.
this
be
why
I
be
seek
the
review
.
it
be
evident
to
I
that
the
work
placement
programme
could
be
use
as
a
means
of
exploit
well
-
qualified
employee
by
provide
work
that
offer
no
real
opportunity
for
advancement
.
for
graduate
who
have
no
previous
experience
of
they
choose
field
and
who
do
not
qualify
for
a
social
welfare
payment
,
the
work
placement
programme
have
its
merit
.
for
other
,
this
programme
offer
absolutely
no
benefit
but
actually
come
at
a
cost
when
travelling
expense
be
deduct
from
the
already
meagre
payment
of
€
200
per
week
.
the
only
winner
here
be
the
employer
,
who
get
a
worker
for
up
to
nine
month
for
nothing
.
the
minister
must
revisit
this
scheme
urgently
,
as
FÁS
be
give
the
green
light
to
employ
staff
for
work
under
the
guise
of
a
training
scheme
for
which
candidate
be
grossly
overqualified
.
she
should
also
consider
require
the
employer
to
pay
some
salary
or
expense
so
the
person
be
at
least
earn
a
living
wage
while
work
a
full
week
.
we
argue
that
they
should
at
least
be
earn
the
minimum
wage
,
if
that
be
possible
.
a
testimonial
on
the
scheme
be
post
on
w
''
I
think
the
work
placement
programme
be
a
good
idea
but
a
person
would
only
be
earn
the
€
196
(
pay
by
the
social
welfare
)
for
a
full
week
's
work
.
while
I
agree
that
any
kind
of
work
look
good
on
you
CV
this
small
amount
of
money
have
make
the
uptake
of
this
programme
very
slow
''
.
in
essence
we
be
seek
to
prevent
the
exploitation
of
worker
.
if
the
scheme
be
design
so
that
people
can
progress
and
use
whatever
skill
they
have
to
advance
in
the
workplace
,
even
if
they
be
only
retain
they
social
welfare
benefit
,
it
should
be
a
real
advance
and
should
not
be
use
by
employer
to
advertise
job
that
involve
no
real
upskilling
.
I
hope
the
Tánaiste
will
at
least
review
this
scheme
the
range
of
information
request
by
the
deputy
be
substantial
and
as
this
information
be
not
hold
centrally
by
my
department
it
would
take
a
inordinate
amount
of
administrative
time
to
compile
.
if
the
deputy
have
a
interest
in
a
particular
agency
then
official
in
my
Department
will
request
the
agency
concerned
to
provide
the
relevant
information
insofar
as
it
be
possible
give
the

I
do
not
want
to
begin
with
a
litany
of
platitude
or
patronising
comment
but
we
must
recognise
the
suffering
and
hardship
endure
by
the
Byrne
family
.
we
must
also
have
regard
for
the
loss
of
three
crewmen
and
the
father
and
uncle
of
Mr.
Danny
Byrne
,
the
complainant
.
it
be
important
that
we
keep
the
Byrne
family
to
the
forefront
of
we
mind
when
speak
on
this
matter
.
however
,
the
manner
in
which
the
Minister
of
State
seek
to
question
the
family
's
motivation
be
utterly
degrading
.
in
he
contribution
to
the
debate
,
he
state
:
in
the
case
of
the
family
in
question
,
no
replacement
vessel
have
be
purchase
and
no
immediate
family
member
have
continue
in
fishing
in
the
20
-
year
period
between
the
accident
and
the
inception
of
the
scheme
.
give
that
the
scheme
be
intend
to
allow
family
to
continue
a
family
tradition
of
sea
fishing
,
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
it
can
be
sustain
that
the
family
be
disadvantage
by
the
failure
of
they
application
some
20
year
late
.
indeed
after
the
sinking
the
family
be
see
,
perhaps
understandably
,
to
have
leave
the
fishing
industry
for
the
subsequent
20
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
no
right
to
adjudicate
on
the
motive
of
that
family
nor
to
introduce
spin
and
revisionist
view
on
this
historical
case
.
I
have
also
see
correspondence
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
which
seek
to
undermine
the
role
of
the
family
.
nobody
in
this
Chamber
know
exactly
what
the
Byrnes
be
go
through
but
today
we
be
debate
the
maladministration
of
a
scheme
and
the
ombudsman
's
role
in
investigate
it
.
in
the
preamble
to
she
report
on
the
Byrne
case
,
the
Ombudsman
state
:
"
I
find
that
the
design
of
the
Scheme
and
the
manner
in
which
it
be
advertise
be
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
.
"
let
there
be
no
attempt
by
anybody
on
the
government
side
of
the
House
to
undermine
the
family
or
the
historical
record
.
the
matter
at
hand
be
one
of
natural
justice
and
whether
the
Byrne
family
receive
due
recognition
for
its
complaint
or
a
appropriate
response
from
the
agency
of
the
State
.
as
a
Opposition
deputy
,
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
deputy
Trevor
Sargent
,
file
a
complaint
over
the
role
of
the
former
minister
for
the
Marine
and
Natural
Resource
,
deputy
Frank
Fahey
,
in
this
affair
with
the
Standard
in
Public
Office
Commission
,
SIPO
.
while
SIPO
reject
the
complaint
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sargent
's
action
demonstrate
that
certain
member
who
be
now
in
government
recognise
the
maladministration
inherent
in
the
scheme
.
the
Ombudsman
find
the
scheme
to
be
"
seriously
deficient
and
flawed
"
and
the
European
Commission
be
never
inform
of
the
scheme
's
existence
.
the
Byrne
family
have
be
treat
abysmally
by
the
agent
of
the
State
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
the
Office
of
the
Ombudsman
.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
ombudsman
deal
with
the
complaint
in
a
manner
that
be
conducive
to
the
power
vested
in
she
office
.
however
,
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
clearly
have
decide
to
ensure
that
the
family
will
not
gain
redress
.
as
a
legislature
,
we
be
leave
for
only
the
second
time
in
the
history
of
this
state
with
a
scenario
that
have
completely
undermine
the
role
of
the
Office
of
the
Ombudsman
.
by
its
decision
to
reject
the
Ombudsman
's
finding
,
the
government
have
undermine
the
confidence
of
citizen
that
they
can
successfully
resolve
they
complaint
and
severely
compromise
the
independent
statutory
role
vested
in
that
office
by
this
legislature
.
for
the
Labour
Party
,
this
be
a
case
of
ensure
that
the
organ
of
the
State
be
not
undermine
or
demean
in
any
way
.
we
must
not
neglect
the
significance
of
a
rejection
by
the
government
of
the
Ombudsman
's
report
.
that
the
report
have
be
lay
before
the
House
,
presumably
as
a
last
resort
,
speak
volume
about
the
contempt
this
government
hold
for
any
independent
arbiter
whose
role
be
lay
out
under
statute
.
what
hope
can
the
ordinary
citizen
have
that
a
complaint
will
be
adjudicate
upon
fairly
if
a
decision
can
be
reject
by
the
government
of
the
day
for
reason
of
political
expediency
?
the
Byrne
family
have
be
subject
to
the
ignominy
of
see
a
report
which
offer
redress
and
a
measure
of
natural
justice
reject
for
the
sake
of
that
same
political
expediency
.
I
have
study
the
correspondence
between
the
Department
and
the
Ombudsman
's
office
.
it
be
clear
even
to
a
layman
that
the
Department
be
engage
in
a
parsimonious
exercise
and
will
do
anything
to
abdicate
its
responsibility
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
lengthy
speech
clearly
demonstrate
that
attitude
.
the
essence
of
he
argument
,
namely
,
that
he
reject
the
finding
of
the
report
out
of
hand
,
could
have
be
express
in
ten
second
.
I
seek
justice
for
the
Byrne
family
and
a
acknowledgement
of
the
ombudsman
's
report
.
it
be
insufficient
to
make
statement
on
this
issue
.
if
this
House
be
to
conduct
its
business
properly
,
we
must
refer
the
report
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
it
be
critical
that
we
afford
the
ombudsman
a
opportunity
to
present
she
finding
to
that
committee
.
we
must
also
be
able
to
hear
from
all
interested
party
in
order
to
understand
the
issue
fully
.
the
Ombudsman
state
:
my
role
as
ombudsman
be
to
ensure
that
we
public
administration
system
deal
properly
and
fairly
with
member
of
the
public
and
this
be
a
task
which
I
be
commit
to
fulfil
,
without
fear
or
favour
,
in
line
with
the
statutory
authority
which
have
be
grant
to
my
Office
by
the
Oireachtas
.
my
decision
to
make
a
special
report
in
this
case
be
not
take
lightly
.
it
be
my
statutory
duty
under
the
Ombudsman
Act
,
1980
to
decide
what
be
fair
and
reasonable
in
relation
to
each
complaint
that
come
before
I
.
where
a
remedy
be
warrant
I
take
great
care
to
ensure
that
my
recommendation
be
both
appropriate
and
proportionate
.
the
credibility
of
any
ombudsman
depend
on
he
or
she
ability
to
deliver
adequate
and
appropriate
remedy
to
people
who
have
be
treat
unfairly
.
my
investigation
of
the
Byrne
family
's
complaint
have
be
painstaking
and
forensic
.
however
,
in
this
case
,
despite
my
good
effort
,
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
continue
to
dispute
my
finding
and
recommendation
and
I
have
be
unable
to
resolve
the
impasse
.
my
only
option
when
this
arise
be
to
seek
the
intervention
of
the
Oireachtas
.
it
now
have
the
task
of
decide
who
be
right
and
who
be
wrong
in
the
context
of
good
administration
and
fairness
to
the
complainant
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
propose
that
the
House
would
adhere
to
the
recommendation
of
the
ombudsman
.
I
accept
it
be
not
within
we
gift
in
the
context
of
this
debate
to
apply
she
finding
and
deliver
some
degree
of
natural
justice
to
the
family
.
accordingly
,
I
propose
that
we
facilitate
the
ombudsman
at
a
meeting
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
so
that
she
and
she
office
may
be
afford
a
opportunity
to
outline
further
she
finding
and
to
enable
the
member
of
this
House
to
come
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
on
the
matter
.
it
be
vital
that
no
one
,
be
it
a
official
of
the
Department
,
or
a
Minister
or
Minister
of
State
,
have
the
right
or
entitlement
to
subjectively
question
the
motive
of
the
family
as
to
whether
they
would
continue
to
fish
,
whether
they
should
have
read
certain
industry
newspaper
to
search
for
advertisement
,
or
whether
that
be
take
as
a
give
,
because
as
the
minister
in
effect
say
,
it
be
a
small
community
and
they
should
have
know
that
the
scheme
be
available
.
it
be
not
for
the
minister
to
decide
on
the
motivation
of
the
family
or
to
comment
on
they
in
2010
in
the
context
of
a
scheme
that
be
in
place
from
1980
or
1981
to
1989
.
what
be
at
stake
be
the
role
of
the
Ombudsman
and
the
decision
and
finding
of
that
office
.
the
Ombudsman
clearly
state
that
there
be
maladministration
and
that
the
scheme
be
not
properly
advertise
.
she
make
a
decision
to
grant
redress
for
the
reason
outline
in
the
report
.
the
issue
be
whether
the
government
decide
to
take
on
board
the
view
of
a
independent
arbiter
,
which
have
a
statutory
function
.
we
be
plunge
ourselves
into
dangerous
territory
if
we
decide
for
the
second
time
to
reject
a
report
of
the
ombudsman
.
this
be
the
tribune
of
the
people
but
decision
take
by
the
tribune
of
the
people
have
to
be
subject
to
a
independent
arbiter
.
we
be
in
dangerous
territory
if
we
go
the
route
of
reject
a
ombudsman
's
report
.
we
all
have
to
be
subject
to
scrutiny
on
decision
by
branch
of
the
State
.
that
be
why
I
feel
strongly
that
the
ombudsman
must
be
bring
before
the
committee
so
that
we
have
another
opportunity
to
explore
further
this
decision
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
we
have
a
open
briefing
with
the
Ombudsman
,
where
she
outline
the
content
of
the
report
which
be
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
no
more
,
no
less
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
that
be
not
what
we
say
.
I
want
to
be
clear
about
this

Minister
of

on

of

in
furtherance
of
the
last
point
make
by
deputy
Rabbitte
,
the
fact
this
be
a
windfall
tax
on
landowner
whose
son
or
daughter
may
seek
to
build
a
house
near
the
family
home
in
a
rural
area
,
base
on
a
genuine
housing
need
,
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
re-examine
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
to
the
issue
of
the
carbon
tax
and
the
permutation
of
that
tax
for
the
agricultural
sector
.
speak
as
a
deputy
of
the
Labour
Party
,
a
party
with
no
apparent
natural
tie
with
the
agricultural
sector
,
it
could
be
argue
that
anything
we
may
say
on
this
subject
will
not
always
be
take
seriously
by
that
who
operate
within
the
rural
economy
.
I
want
to
put
on
record
that
what
be
vital
to
the
recovery
of
this
economy
be
how
the
rural
economy
will
thrive
.
the
imposition
of
the
carbon
tax
,
for
example
,
particularly
as
it
pertain
to
mark
gas
oil
or
agricultural
diesel
,
will
have
a
severe
impact
in
term
of
the
cost
input
for
that
who
operate
within
the
agricultural
sector
.
be
they
primary
producer
or
agricultural
contractor
,
the
very
fact
a
tax
of
this
nature
be
be
levy
at
8.7
%
when
road
diesel
be
at
4.4
%
will
cause
a
undue
cost
impact
for
that
who
be
operate
within
this
sector
,
and
it
need
to
be
revise
.
there
be
a
irony
to
the
situation
.
for
the
multiple
such
as
Tesco
,
they
lorry
on
the
road
be
subject
to
a
tax
of
4.4
%
whereas
the
primary
producer
such
as
the
farmer
who
be
produce
for
the
multiple
be
be
levy
at
8.7
%
,
which
will
put
a
further
squeeze
on
that
primary
producer
in
term
of
they
ability
to
supply
goods
into
the
market
.
this
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
take
on
board
,
particularly
by
the
Green
wing
of
the
government
,
who
have
herald
this
carbon
tax
as
the
dawn
of
a
new
age
.
in
principle
,
we
be
all
in
favour
of
the
tax
,
but
it
have
to
be
on
the
basis
that
it
be
levy
with
some
degree
of
equity
and
fairness
.
I
do
not
believe
a
proper
analysis
be
undertake
of
this
measure
before
it
be
decide
upon
.
it
should
be
revise
and
revisit
because
it
have
not
be
cost
and
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
very
recovery
that
be
necessary
for
this
economy
,
particularly
in
term
of
how
the
rural
economy
weigh
into
that
recovery
.
I
would
like
a
response
from
the
minister
on
this
issue
when
he
be
reply
to
the
debate
.
I
wish
to
refer
the
chair
to
a
e-mail
I
receive
from
a
farmer
who
be
directly
impact
as
a
result
of
this
proposal
.
he
state
:
I
too
have
no
problem
with
ct
[
carbon
tax
]
but
only
if
it
be
deal
out
in
fair
way
.
to
I
it
seem
that
this
tax
at
nearly
double
the
road
%
be
a
tax
on
production
.
...
another
concern
I
would
have
be
that
see
new
engine
in
tractor
be
go
to
cost
on
average
between
20
%
-
50
%
more
than
now
,
this
tax
would
be
a
barrier
to
clean
and
new
emission
target
machine
be
use
in
agriculture
,
as
people
will
just
make
do
[
that
be
to
say
,
make
do
with
exist
machinery
]
.
it
be
a
fact
that
this
new
tractor
burn
more
fuel
due
to
the
nature
of
the
emission
recycling
that
go
on
.
...
by
hook
or
crook
everyone
in
agriculture
will
be
affect
by
the
rise
,
any
contractor
will
just
have
to
pass
it
on
to
customer
,
and
they
be
find
it
hard
enough
to
get
pay
as
it
be
.
we
need
to
take
a
more
lateral
view
as
to
how
the
carbon
tax
will
be
implement
.
from
a
agricultural
perspective
,
it
be
prove
that
agricultural
income
be
down
significantly
in
2009
—
the
figure
be
there
for
everybody
to
see
.
if
one
be
operate
a
large
-
scale
farm
unit
,
the
chance
be
one
will
be
able
to
absorb
the
extra
cost
because
one
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
however
,
in
the
case
of
a
small
farmer
,
such
as
a
hillside
farmer
or
sheep
farmer
on
a
small
margin
,
any
increase
in
cost
of
this
nature
could
have
the
potential
to
put
that
farmer
out
of
business
.
we
need
to
revise
this
mechanism
on
that
basis
alone
.
I
keep
come
back
to
the
idea
that
if
the
agricultural
sector
be
to
form
a
part
of
we
economic
recovery
,
what
we
must
not
do
be
place
a
undue
burden
on
the
cost
of
production
.
the
cost
of
production
,
if
one
consider
the
overall
economy
,
have
to
be
the
same
for
agriculture
as
they
be
for
the
lorry
that
supply
Tesco
and
the
other
multiple
,
which
take
they
primary
product
from
that
same
primary
producer
.
we
need
equity
in
this
regard
.
I
also
refer
the
chair
to
the
proposal
by
the
Irish
Farmers
's
Association
,
which
state
:
Farm
diesel
have
excise
duty
charge
at
a
low
rate
than
road
diesel
or
petrol
.
furthermore
,
the
rate
of
vat
apply
be
the
low
rate
of
13.5
%
as
compare
with
21
%
for
normal
automotive
fuel
.
the
low
rate
of
excise
duty
also
apply
to
farm
diesel
in
other
EU
country
.
this
demonstrate
recognition
by
government
and
at
EU
level
that
a
low
rate
of
taxation
be
appropriate
for
farm
diesel
,
which
be
exclusively
use
in
agricultural
production
,
than
be
apply
to
other
motor
fuel
.
again
,
we
need
to
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
agricultural
diesel
,
by
its
very
nature
,
be
use
on
-
farm
and
primarily
for
agricultural
related
purpose
—
or
it
should
be
—
and
,
therefore
,
if
its
cost
to
the
farmer
be
increase
,
many
farmer
will
be
wipe
out
,
particularly
that
in
marginal
area
.
I
ask
the
government
to
revise
this
provision
.
my
Department
have
not
receive
a
application
for
home
tuition
on
behalf
of
the
child
in
question
.
I
have
arrange
for
a
application
form
to
issue
to
he
parent
at
the
address
supply
by
the
deputy
.
the
spectre
of
Abbeylara
have
hang
over
this
house
for
some
time
,
predate
my
membership
.
this
Bill
represent
a
honest
approach
to
deal
with
the
legality
surround
that
judgment
,
which
would
put
the
issue
to
bed
once
and
for
all
in
order
that
the
legislative
function
we
have
relative
to
the
executive
can
be
deal
with
in
a
meaningful
way
.
it
be
about
time
—
I
say
this
as
somebody
who
enter
the
Dáil
for
the
first
time
in
2007
—
this
issue
be
deal
with
in
a
substantive
way
.
I
wish
to
outline
some
of
the
principal
feature
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
worth
read
this
into
the
record
because
they
be
so
clear
it
be
difficult
to
fathom
why
they
would
not
be
accept
by
the
government
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
address
a
press
need
to
restore
the
status
of
the
Oireachtas
vis
-à
-
vis
the
executive
.
in
particular
,
we
need
to
address
the
view
that
the
Supreme
Court
decision
in
the
Abbeylara
case
have
put
a
end
to
any
possibility
of
inquiry
by
a
Oireachtas
committee
.
we
reject
the
view
that
,
short
of
constitutional
change
,
there
be
now
no
lawful
means
of
hold
a
parliamentary
inquiry
.
we
do
accept
,
however
,
that
legislation
be
require
to
address
the
defect
identify
by
the
court
in
that
case
,
hence
this
Bill
.
I
stand
before
you
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
as
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
and
Regulatory
affair
,
which
have
deal
with
a
number
of
banker
in
recent
year
.
we
have
have
the
spectre
of
Abbeylara
hang
over
we
in
that
every
time
a
witness
come
before
the
committee
we
need
to
be
careful
about
how
we
question
he
or
she
.
the
issue
of
compellability
also
loom
large
over
the
proceedings
,
as
member
will
see
if
they
check
the
record
of
the
committee
from
the
past
number
of
year
.
let
we
fast
forward
to
the
announcement
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
that
a
private
inquiry
would
be
hold
.
it
beggar
belief
that
the
government
would
hide
behind
a
Supreme
Court
judgment
as
a
excuse
for
not
hold
such
a
inquiry
in
public
.
that
be
a
affront
to
any
member
of
this
House
who
put
he
or
she
name
on
a
ballot
paper
and
seek
to
represent
the
people
.
it
allow
for
the
possibility
that
people
who
may
have
be
responsible
for
undermine
we
banking
system
and
we
very
economic
structure
will
hide
behind
such
a
judgment
as
a
attempt
not
to
answer
question
in
a
public
forum
—
what
I
would
call
the
tribune
of
the
people
.
the
people
demand
that
the
issue
be
deal
with
in
a
meaningful
way
,
and
this
Bill
do
so
.
I
ask
that
the
government
seriously
consider
accept
the
Bill
.
it
be
right
and
proper
—
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
banking
crisis
—
that
minister
for
finance
,
they
official
,
and
various
actor
within
the
banking
sector
should
be
subject
to
rigorous
question
in
the
public
interest
and
within
the
public
domain
on
the
basis
that
the
taxpayer
have
bail
out
some
of
that
very
institution
,
which
have
receive
a
guarantee
under
the
auspices
of
the
State
.
it
be
only
right
that
we
have
such
proceedings
in
public
.
any
excuse
that
might
be
put
forward
by
minister
that
they
be
restrict
in
do
so
by
virtue
of
a
Supreme
Court
decision
will
be
deal
with
by
this
legislation
,
which
will
prevent
any
excuse
for
not
have
such
public
inquiry
.
it
be
not
right
or
proper
that
somebody
who
be
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
,
which
have
a
particular
remit
in
respect
of
the
banking
sector
,
would
need
to
glean
he
information
from
the
business
page
of
the
Sunday
paper
.
when
I
read
the
Sunday
Times
or
the
Sunday
Tribune
on
any
Sunday
,
the
amount
of
leakage
on
issue
surround
Anglo
Irish
Bank
tell
I
that
the
government
be
selectively
talk
to
journalist
.
that
subvert
the
very
role
of
a
committee
such
as
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
—
or
any
other
committee
of
the
House
.
the
government
,
if
it
adopt
a
historical
perspective
—
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
conscious
of
this
—
will
admit
that
it
must
be
see
by
the
people
to
be
do
right
,
and
the
only
way
it
can
do
this
be
by
conduct
its
affair
in
a
public
fashion
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
a
meeting
of
the
northern
committee
of
Cork
County
Council
take
place
yesterday
at
which
a
decision
be
announce
to
dispose
of
up
to
106
affordable
unit
,
under
the
auspices
of
Cork
County
Council
,
51
of
which
be
to
be
dispose
of
through
local
auctioneer
and
the
remain
55
through
the
social
leasing
scheme
announce
by
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Michael
Finneran
,
some
time
ago
.
I
be
concerned
that
this
house
will
not
sell
on
the
open
market
.
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
that
they
will
sell
on
the
open
market
.
there
be
a
over
supply
of
affordable
house
within
local
authority
and
,
particularly
,
within
the
northern
division
of
Cork
County
Council
.
I
be
sceptical
about
any
attempt
by
Cork
County
Council
to
use
the
social
leasing
scheme
because
that
will
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
housing
association
.
anybody
who
take
up
residence
in
any
of
that
55
house
which
come
under
the
social
leasing
scheme
will
never
have
a
opportunity
to
purchase
that
house
.
any
person
who
may
be
on
a
affordable
housing
list
and
who
may
be
eligible
for
financing
will
not
consider
go
down
that
road
if
it
mean
that
for
the
duration
of
that
lease
he
or
she
cannot
own
the
house
.
I
be
also
of
the
view
that
the
51
house
it
be
propose
to
sell
on
the
open
market
will
not
be
sell
.
I
propose
that
there
must
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
on
the
part
of
the
minister
when
deal
with
local
authority
in
respect
of
housing
issue
.
if
the
106
house
to
which
I
refer
be
advertise
as
rent
-
to
-
buy
type
letting
,
they
could
then
be
occupy
,
which
be
extremely
important
.
after
two
or
three
year
,
the
occupant
could
then
decide
whether
they
wish
to
purchase
that
house
.
in
one
estate
in
the
Mitchelstown
area
there
be
20
house
,
ten
of
which
will
be
dispose
of
through
the
social
leasing
scheme
while
the
other
ten
will
be
dispose
of
through
the
affordable
housing
scheme
.
for
every
day
this
house
remain
unoccupied
,
problem
arise
in
the
estate
to
which
I
refer
.
if
its
be
leave
to
auctioneer
to
try
to
sell
this
house
in
a
market
in
which
no
one
be
buy
,
I
contend
that
they
will
remain
unoccupied
for
some
time
.
I
put
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
a
degree
more
flexibility
and
lateral
thinking
would
provide
people
who
be
live
in
the
area
with
the
opportunity
to
rent
that
house
.
they
could
do
so
through
the
social
housing
scheme
or
through
a
rent
-
to
-
buy
scheme
,
under
which
they
could
eventually
decide
to
buy
if
the
opportunity
arise
.
this
would
constitute
a
more
common
-
sense
and
practical
approach
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
unoccupied
house
in
certain
estate
.
since
2008
my
Department
have
undertake
a
number
of
measure
as
part
of
the
government
's

for
the
rationalisation

note

:
the
Teaching
Council
have
be
self
-
financing
since
March
2008
.
this
be
a
issue
of
fairness
and
connectivity
.
that
who
benefit
from
this
route
do
not
have
they
own
means
of
transport
.
as
most
of
they
be
isolate
,
they
rely
on
the
route
to
access
essential
service
they
cannot
access
other
than
through
Bus
Éireann
.
many
of
that
who
travel
on
the
366
route
cannot
avail
of
a
supplementary
service
under
the
rural
transport
programme
.
we
be
seek
to
achieve
the
retention
of
the
service
in
some
way
,
even
if
it
mean
a
reduction
in
the
service
to
one
day
a
week
.
we
strongly
believe
this
route
should
be
subject
to
a
public
service
obligation
.
it
be
put
in
place
to
supplement
the
loss
of
railway
infrastructure
.
while
that
may
be
deem
to
be
a
historical
debate
,
the
principle
still
apply
.
if
this
route
be
take
away
,
a
significant
number
of
people
,
most
of
whom
be
elderly
,
will
be
cast
further
into
isolation
.
a
lady
who
attend
one
of
my
clinic
two
week
ago
be
visibly
upset
about
the
loss
of
this
route
.
when
one
speak
about
access
to
service
,
one
always
wish
to
bear
in
mind
the
notion
of
a
national
spatial
strategy
and
intergenerational
solidarity
.
if
we
be
to
axe
route
that
allow
for
connectivity
,
we
will
do
a
disservice
to
old
people
.
we
will
marginalise
that
who
do
not
have
they
own
transport
and
therefore
rely
heavily
on
service
of
this
nature
as
they
travel
to
where
they
want
to
go
each
day
.
the
information
be
currently
be
compile
and
will
be
forward
to
the
deputy
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
move
amendment
no.

.
I
be
make
the
same
argument
here
as
I
do
on
Committee
stage
.
look
at
the
legislation
in
the
main
,
it
be
about
the
transposition
of
a
directive
which
be
complete
in
2006
.
we
have
to
look
at
the
historical
perspective
and
the
fact
that
the
directive
be
initiate
as
a
result
,
in
particular
,
of
the
Madrid
bombing
.
it
be
a
counter
-
terrorism
response
relate
to
that
period
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
a
number
of
year
have
past
and
we
be
move
towards
the
final
transposition
of
that
directive
now
.
we
view
be
that
some
of
the
provision
in
the
Bill
be
excessive
,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
length
of
time
for
which
datum
must
be
retain
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
justification
for
the
government
's
position
vis
-à
-
vis
the
two
-
year
retention
period
for
telephony
and
the
one
-
year
retention
period
for
Internet
datum
be
on
the
basis
of
security
and
counter
-
terrorism
measure
,
as
well
as
the
detection
of
crime
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
understand
that
rationale
and
would
not
argue
against
it
.
in
principle
,
we
be
not
against
the
retention
of
datum
and
believe
that
the
directive
must
be
transpose
.
however
,
we
take
issue
with
the
manner
in
which
it
be
be
transpose
and
the
length
of
time
for
which
datum
must
be
retain
,
particularly
in
relation
to
isp
and
telephone
record
,
because
we
believe
this
will
place
a
undue
burden
on
business
and
that
the
cost
could
be
prohibitive
and
reduce
any
future
comparative
advantage
Ireland
might
gain
through
the
Internet
and
telecomumication
sector
.
I
refer
to
the
historical
context
of
the
transposition
of
a
directive
date
back
to
2006
and
any
subsequent
legislation
enact
that
have
deal
with
counter
-
terrorism
or
crime
prevention
measure
more
than
adequately
,
include
the
criminal
justice
(
surveillance
)
act
and
the
recently
pass
criminal
justice
(
amendment
)
act
.
the
Labour
Party
be
examine
the
permutation
of
the
government
's
position
,
especially
vis-à
-
vo
the
cost
implication
.
I
submit
that
place
on
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
and
telephony
company
a
obligation
to
store
datum
for
two
year
would
result
in
a
undue
cost
burden
and
would
not
have
a
impact
on
crime
prevention
in
real
term
or
in
term
of
detection
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
submission
on
Committee
stage
.
he
state
that
the
12
month
detention
period
for
Internet
datum
be
very
much
in
the
mainstream
and
this
be
significant
because
the
Internet
be
a
relatively
new
technology
.
he
further
state
that
it
be
accept
that
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
which
would
arise
as
a
result
of
the
legislation
relate
to
datum
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
request
for
datum
be
,
to
use
the
word
of
the
minister
on
Committee
stage
,
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
,
then
I
submit
that
the
Labour
Party
amendment
,
which
seek
to
substitute
two
year
for
one
year
and
one
year
for
six
month
,
would
be
in
line
with
he
thinking
in
respect
to
the
prosecution
of
a
crime
or
any
investigation
pertinent
to
commit
a
crime
.
I
further
submit
that
if
the
legislation
be
pass
and
datum
be
to
be
retain
for
two
year
hence
,
then
on
this
day
in
two
year
time
,
that
be
,
on
23
February
or
24
February
2012
,
if
someone
be
to
be
investigate
for
a
crime
then
I
suggest
any
telephone
call
make
on
today
's
date
,
the
content
of
which
be
unknown
,
or
if
a
person
log
on
to
a
website
in
the
intervene
period
of
one
year
hereafter
,
it
would
impact
in
no
way
on
whether
one
could
suitably
detect
that
any
such
communication
be
pertinent
to
any
crime
commit
.
the
approach
of
the
government
in
term
of
transpose
the
directive
be
that
of
a
sledge
-
hammer
be
use
to
crack
a
nut
.
I
reiterate
that
we
be
not
against
the
principle
of
datum
storage
.
we
agree
the
directive
must
be
transpose
but
we
maintain
the
time
period
be
excessive
and
,
contrary
to
the
minister
's
statement
on
Committee
state
to
the
effect
that
the
legislation
be
in
line
with
the
mainstream
,
we
believe
it
be
against
the
European
mainstream
and
that
other
country
have
transpose
the
directive
on
the
basis
of
time
period
more
in
line
with
the
proposal
contain
in
the
Labour
Party
amendment
.
I
be
aware
of
one
Defence
force
member
who
miss
he
opportunity
for
promotion
because
he
final
medical
examination
could
not
take
place
for
reason
beyond
he
control
.
the
former
minister
for
Defence
be
well
aware
of
the
case
.
give
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
,
perhaps
the
case
could
be
re-examine
.
article
6
of
the
directive
allow
for
telephone
and
internet
datum
to
be
retain
for
a
minimum
of
six
month
and
a
maximum
of
two
year
.
we
all
accept
the
principle
of
the
retention
of
datum
and
each
state
be
at
liberty
to
choose
where
on
that
scale
it
pitch
its
obligatory
datum
retention
provision
.
the
norm
be
as
per
the
Labour
Party
position
set
down
in
this
amendment
.
there
be
no
contradiction
between
be
in
favour
of
the
principle
of
the
retention
of
datum
and
be
against
what
the
government
propose
.
if
one
put
a
onus
on
Internet
service
provider
and
telephony
company
to
retain
datum
,
they
must
retain
all
Internet
related
traffic
for
a
period
of
two
year
.
if
one
be
investigate
a
crime
,
one
cannot
speak
to
the
content
of
the
datum
.
if
I
use
my
Gmail
account
to
e-mail
someone
,
who
be
subsequently
charge
with
a
crime
,
one
can
only
state
that
correspondence
take
place
between
I
and
the
other
person
but
one
do
not
have
access
to
the
content
.
why
would
one
impose
a
cost
beyond
12
month
on
a
telephony
company
or
a
internet
service
provider
if
one
can
merely
deduce
that
communication
take
place
without
have
access
to
the
content
?
let
we
consider
the
example
of
social
networking
site
such
as
Bebo
,
Facebook
and
Twitter
and
web
-
base
e-mail
account
such
as
Hotmail
.
the
Minister
of
State
cannot
argue
that
this
measure
will
not
place
a
cost
burden
on
this
provider
because
every
single
piece
of
traffic
must
be
store
somewhere
.
I
imagine
the
vast
bulk
of
it
will
be
store
outside
the
confines
of
the
State
because
many
of
this
Internet
service
provider
be
international
company
and
have
specific
storage
facility
.
however
,
it
will
increase
the
cost
burden
for
that
who
operate
in
Ireland
,
such
as
Irish
company
with
storage
facility
here
.
by
increase
the
cost
burden
,
one
must
consider
whether
it
will
be
pertinent
to
the
solving
of
a
crime
thereafter
.
the
argument
of
the
Labour
Party
be
that
it
will
not
.
on
Committee
Stage
,
the
Minister
of
State
comment
:
the
significance
of
this
be
that
Internet
be
a
relatively
new
technology
.
it
be
accept
that
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
[
the
request
that
will
arise
from
the
vested
officer
]
be
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
be
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
,
the
position
of
the
Labour
Party
be
that
the
measure
exceed
that
which
the
Minister
of
State
state
on
Committee
stage
.
that
be
the
logic
behind
the
two
amendment
we
have
tab
.
yes
.
I
move
amendment
no.

so
that

we
want

I
accept

Minister

's
response

I
move

no.

"
.
there
be
suggestion
that
the
telecomumication
industry
,
through
various
submission
it
have
make
,
would
request
that
this
should
be
bring
into
the
legislation
.
the
amendment
be
self
-
explanatory
.
we
be
ask
that
a
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
the
service
provider
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
and
reasonable
in
scope
—
in
that
the
request
be
not
so
wide
as
to
place
a
undue
cost
on
the
service
provider
.
again
,
with
reference
to
the
cost
burden
,
if
,
for
instance
a
designate
officer
should
make
a
disclosure
request
,
there
have
to
be
a
reasonable
approach
to
this
.
if
,
for
instance
,
the
request
trawl
so
wide
as
to
be
entirely
non-specific
and
take
up
a
large
amount
of
time
,
then
this
will
obviously
place
a
burden
on
the
relevant
isp
or
telephone
company
.
if
a
disclosure
request
be
as
wide
-
range
as
a
chief
superintendent
determine
it
should
be
,
then
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
cost
to
the
service
provider
in
yield
up
that
information
.
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
will
argue
to
the
effect
that
disclosure
request
be
need
and
there
have
to
be
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
chief
superintendent
.
nonetheless
,
I
believe
the
request
have
to
be
target
and
some
degree
of
scope
must
be
allow
for
as
regards
the
isp
or
telephone
company
.
that
be
fundamentally
what
I
be
address
here
.
to
my
mind
,
the
memorandum
of
understanding
refer
to
by
the
Minister
of
State
on
Committee
Stage
be
not
on
a
statutory
footing
.
section
7
state
that
service
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
they
.
it
be
important
the
view
of
the
telco
and
the
isp
,
internet
service
provider
,
be
acknowledge
.
one
of
the
party
to
the
memorandum
of
understanding
be
the
ISPAI
,
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
.
it
make
a
submission
on
the
Bill
and
state
section
7
be
far
too
wide
and
unwieldy
and
take
no
account
of
what
be
reasonable
,
technically
possible
and
not
very
expensive
.
its
recommendation
be
that
a
service
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
it
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
.
I
take
on
board
the
view
expound
by
the
Minister
of
State
but
the
reality
be
that
we
do
not
know
for
sure
how
many
request
will
be
make
by
a
designate
officer
.
we
do
not
know
for
what
purpose
such
request
will
be
make
,
against
whom
they
will
be
make
or
the
reason
why
they
may
be
make
.
if
we
accept
in
good
faith
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
,
then
we
deduce
request
will
only
be
make
in
respect
of
taxation
or
a
investigation
by
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
a
chief
superintendent
or
a
officer
of
the
law
.
I
refer
to
the
Bills
's
digest
,
a
very
good
document
publish
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
service
.
it
state
that
under
the
Bill
a
individual
can
only
find
out
that
datum
relate
to
he
or
she
be
access
on
foot
of
a
disclosure
request
by
first
make
a
request
on
the
basis
that
they
believe
the
datum
have
be
access
.
this
veer
somewhat
from
the
point
of
the
amendment
but
I
seek
to
nail
down
the
idea
that
there
be
a
clear
focus
in
respect
of
how
the
legislation
be
use
.
we
may
agree
that
one
must
retain
datum
and
that
such
datum
can
be
pertinent
to
solve
a
crime
but
we
have
no
wish
for
anyone
to
flout
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
for
they
own
end
.
we
have
no
wish
for
anyone
to
make
nefarious
request
for
disclosure
and
trawl
with
the
net
so
wide
such
that
it
would
put
a
cost
on
the
isp
and
such
that
a
service
provider
be
spend
resource
for
something
that
may
not
be
for
the
detection
of
a
crime
or
for
which
the
legislation
be
design
.
I
wish
to
put
down
a
marker
in
this
respect
and
I
intend
to
press
the
amendment
.
do
we
know
who
the
responsible
judge
would
be
in
respect
of
this
oversight
?
how
have
that
system
be
use
?
have
the
judge
use
this
provision
in
respect
of
other
legislation
?
my
understanding
be
that
provision
be
also
relate
to
the
interception
of
postal
packet
and
telecomumication
message
and
the
oversight
be
pertinent
with
regard
to
that
legislation
.
I
be
give
to
understand
report
be
rubber
-
stamp
in
respect
of
how
that
provision
work
,
without
any
qualitative
analysis
of
the
provision
in
question
.
I
be
unconvinced
that
the
oversight
mechanism
in
this
legislation
would
be
use
as
designate
.
I
suspect
that
the
oversight
provision
will
end
up
simply
be
rubber
-
stamp
as
per
other
legislation
and
that
we
will
not
know
in
real
term
whether
the
legislation
will
be
flout
or
abuse
by
certain
person
.
it
be
open
to
abuse
regardless
of
whether
one
accept
the
bona
fide
of
a
chief
superintendent
or
any
other
designate
officer
.
that
be
the
point
we
want
the
Minister
of
State
to
clarify
.
I
want
to
ensure
disclosure
request
be
make
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
and
reasonable
and
that
the
oversight
mechanism
will
be
subject
to
proper
scrutiny
.

I
move
amendment
no.

this
be
another

it
seek
to
ensure
that

law

not

flout
in
any
way
.
it
speak

the
theme
of

no.
5
.
bear
in
mind
the
interception
of
postal
Packet
and
Telecommunications
message
(
Regulation
)
Act
1993
,
the
current
reporting
format
be
inadequate
,
even
if
there
be
judicial
oversight
.
if
one
examine
some
of
the
report
and
document
arise
from
the
oversight
procedure
,
one
will
see
they
contain
a
single
paragraph
state
record
regard
the
legislation
have
be
examine
by
a
judge
.
that
be
all
they
state
.
we
do
not
want
similar
circumstance
obtain
regard
the
legislation
under
discussion
.
we
would
like
to
have
include
a
provision
seek
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
disclosure
request
.
if
a
request
be
make
and
lead
to
a
criminal
offence
or
prosecution
,
there
would
be
some
justification
for
the
provision
.
however
,
if
there
be
a
large
number
of
disclosure
request
make
but
no
correlation
between
that
request
and
subsequent
prosecution
,
it
would
provoke
question
.
there
be
always
a
need
for
some
form
of
qualitative
analysis
to
ensure
legislation
be
work
properly
and
fit
for
purpose
.
that
be
why
the
Labour
Party
be
say
a
detailed
report
should
be
make
.
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
documentation
state
a
individual
can
only
find
out
if
datum
relate
to
he
or
she
have
be
access
on
foot
of
a
disclosure
request
by
first
make
a
request
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
believe
the
datum
have
be
access
.
that
be
a
fairly
serious
provision
.
the
reporting
procedure
could
redress
such
a
disparity
in
the
Bill
.
if
one
do
not
know
that
a
disclosure
request
have
be
make
about
one
,
one
have
no
way
to
access
the
referee
or
other
such
designate
person
.
perhaps
the
minister
have
a
view
on
that
.
if
my
understanding
of
the
provision
be
wrong
,
I
will
openly
acknowledge
it
but
the
amendment
will
ensure
that
the
legislation
be
not
use
for
nefarious
purpose
,
that
it
be
fit
for
purpose
and
that
it
be
use
in
a
manner
to
ensure
that
somebody
cannot
trawl
widely
for
a
disclosure
request
and
do
so
for
purpose
other
than
expedit
justice
.
the
Minister
of
State
offer
the
example
of
a
Mr.
Ryan
,
so
I
will
continue
to
use
that
example
.
he
also
refer
to
the
requirement
of
the
directive
and
the
term
under
which
datum
must
be
submit
to
the
commission
.
I
accept
that
point
.
however
,
if
we
be
discuss
the
rights
of
this
Mr.
Ryan
in
respect
of
whom
disclosure
be
request
,
under
the
Bill
Mr.
Ryan
can
only
find
out
if
a
disclosure
request
have
be
make
by
first
make
a
request
to
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
on
the
basis
that
he
believe
that
personal
datum
have
be
access
.
if
the
datum
relate
to
Mr.
Ryan
have
be
access
,
there
be
no
analysis
after
the
fact
.
if
nothing
arise
from
the
disclosure
and
Mr.
Ryan
be
innocent
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
analysis
thereafter
that
allow
Mr.
Ryan
to
know
that
a
disclosure
request
be
make
about
he
by
one
of
the
designate
officer
.
the
reporting
mechanism
to
the
commission
do
not
allow
for
that
either
.
we
be
try
to
ensure
that
if
Mr.
Ryan
be
not
prosecute
,
a
report
under
this
section
will
contain
detail
of
the
number
of
prosecution
actually
commence
as
a
result
of
investigation
to
which
request
related
and
detailed
justification
for
any
significant
excess
in
number
of
request
.
if
no
prosecution
be
take
against
Mr.
Ryan
,
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
a
excess
.
that
must
be
quantifiable
as
well
.
I
know
I
be
repeat
myself
but
I
be
try
to
strike
a
balance
between
what
be
appropriate
and
inappropriate
use
of
the
disclosure
request
in
the
first
instance
to
ensure
that
in
the
case
of
people
who
be
innocent
party
and
against
whom
disclosure
request
be
make
,
the
State
,
because
of
a
reporting
procedure
,
12
month
after
the
enactment
of
the
Bill
would
be
able
to
note
a
inordinately
large
amount
of
disclosure
request
from
a
particular
source
about
a
certain
person
where
no
action
have
arise
from
they
.
it
be
right
to
have
a
method
by
which
we
can
question
that
process
.
I
might
be
overly
pedantic
about
this
but
we
must
prevent
nefarious
use
of
the
law
.
that
be
my
objective
.
perhaps
the
Minister
of
State
could
clarify
and
acknowledge
whether
the
Bill
state
a
individual
can
already
find
out
if
datum
relate
to
he
or
she
have
be
access
on
foot
of
a
disclosure
request
.
that
provision
be
already
open
to
the
person

the

be
to
provide
clarity
and
avoid
any
constitutional
difficulty
in
respect
of
the
offence
to
which
the
section
apply

clearly
,
it
would
be
legally
improper
to
impose

the

Convention

expressly
state
that
a
high
penalty
than
the

at
the
material
time
of

be
impose

this

avoid
any
challenge
base
on
this
point
by
make
clear
that
the
new
penalty
will
only
apply
to
offence
commit
on
,
or
after
,
the
commencement
date
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
exist
Bill
be
ambiguous
,
in
that
it
do
not
state
clearly
whether
it
refer
to
the
conviction
or
the
offence
that
occur
before
the
commencement
date
.
it
be
a
matter
of
try
to
tighten
up
the
wording
.
that
be
we
approach
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
response
and
will
withdraw
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
I
