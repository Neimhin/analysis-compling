restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

allow
a

to
make
a
attachment

in

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work

to

it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the

I
have

be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap

bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence

be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that
we

we

my

however

Sinn

I
will

about
this

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative

mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

Sinn

see

it

as
it

as

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment

be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or

partner

parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get

,
we
will
work

some
of
the

I

if

attach

certainly
not

be
look

although
restorative

can

it

nowhere

as

it

we

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment

be
make
in

of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner

of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this

reach

.
of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on
that

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather

be

this
could
actually
have

as

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with

it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the

my

and
I
welcome

however
should
the

get

Sinn

will

further

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

indeed

the

be
look
at
this
very

although
restorative

can
be
very
labour

intensive
,
it
be
nowhere

as
costly
as
incarcerate
people

non-violent

it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative

in

I
reiterate
my
initial

that
we
support

we

I

my

I

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap

bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

have

there

allow
a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare
payment
.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get

,
we
will
work

and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the

my
party
and
I
welcome
the

will
be

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the

of
restorative

,
include

restorative

mediation
programme

both
within

alongside

system
North

South

although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

section

allow
a

to
make
a
attachment

order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will

of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap

bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence

be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that

my

however

Sinn

I
will
speak

about
this
a

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

see

as

social

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or

partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get

,
we
will

some
of
the

I

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a

be
make
in

of
a

,
there
be
a
chance
that
the

will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or

partner

parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would

to
amend

of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a

on
someone
who

raise
question

as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my
contribution
.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this

to
the

commend

on

my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this

and
will
be
support
its

however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek
to
amend
it
in

to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal

other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of

restorative

be

approach
to
respond

criminal
and

behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or

to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include

restorative

and

mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this

.
should
it
get

,
we
will
work

to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in

I
welcome
the

my

and
I
welcome

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime

we
be
commit
to
expand

of
restorative

restorative

both
within

system
North

although
we
may

loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of

should
pay

the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this

area
we

should

reach

.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that

we

will

about

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the

of
restorative

,
include

restorative

programme
,
both
within
and
alongside

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

Sinn

see
a

important
role
for

in

across

because
we
believe
that
in
a

case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive

as
it
result
in

although

that

as

know

social

be
often

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get

,
we
will
work

some
of
the

the

if

attach

although
restorative

can

very

it
be
nowhere

as
incarcerate

it

we

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate

.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a

be
make
in

there
be
a

will
suffer
unfairly

to
the
behaviour
of
he

area
we
would

of

we
will
work
constructively

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also

as

know

social

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the

my

and
I
welcome
the

of

will
be

however
should
the

get

that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek

to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would

I

worry

there
be
a

the

of

this
be
one
area
we

of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict

be
place
on

order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

in

North

restorative

practice
have
come

here
in

we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint

on
Justice
,
Defence

be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative

can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent

.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution

reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's

both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand

of
restorative

include

restorative

both
within

system
North

we
may

with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence

should

the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have

,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

allow
a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support

of
a

as
part
of
the

a

give

just
16

the

be
deem

the

the
good
Clareman
that
the

be

he
hurl
the
ball
very
well
on

I
sympathise
with
the

as
I
too
represent
a
rural
constituency
,
Cork
East
,
where
we
school
face
similar
challenge
.
the
government
have
set
out
criterion
which
be
open
to
the
rigour
of
a
independent
appeal
review
.
if
a
enrolment
could
be
increase
in
September
2014
,
there
be
a
mechanism
for
the
school
and
community
to
come
back
in

in
respect
of
the
question
pose
by
deputy
Tóibín
as
to
whether
or
not
we
will
take
any
amendment
on
board
,
the
amendment
be
put
forward
and
we
respond
to
they
.
we
have
take
a
clear
position
on
they
and
believe
that
the
legislative
process
be
such
that
it
produce
robust
legislation
.
however
,
there
be
some
point
we
can
consider
for
Seanad
Stage
in
the
Seanad
.
we
may
look
at
the
court
of
jurisdiction
,
which
be
a
area
raise
by
the
deputy
in
connection
with
employee
issue
.
in
response
to
the
amendment
put
forward
as
they
be
group
,
we
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
this
amendment
.
we
must
keep
reiterate
that
the
Bill
be
only
concerned
with
company
law
.
in
general
term
,
company
law
concern
itself
with
the
fiduciary
duty
a
director
owe
to
the
company
alone
while
recognise
that
a
director
ought
to
have
regard
to
the
interest
of
he
or
she
employee
.
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
include
the
propose
provision
in
the
Bill
.
legislation
govern
employee
rights
should
be
consider
in
the
context
of
employment
law
.
we
have
state
this
several
time
in
the
context
of
other
amendment
tab
by
opposition
Deputy
.
by
address
such
a
matter
in
a
company
Bill
,
the
provision
be
not
provide
protection
for
all
employee
,
such
as
sole
trader
or
that
work
in
partnership
.
second
,
employment
law
already
provide
for
redress
in
less
cumbersome
and
costly
fora
than
the
high
Court
.
third
,
and
equally
importantly
,
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
company
law
must
balance
the
rights
of
all
creditor
,
many
of
whom
be
employer
in
they
own
right
,
in
wind
-
up
situation

I
appreciate
what
the
deputy
be
attempt
to
achieve
with
this
propose
amendment
but
the
simple
fact
be
that
company
law
be
not
the
correct
vehicle
for
this
ambition
.
therefore
,
we
be
not
in
favour
of
this
amendment

amendment
no.
168
suggest
that
a
company
may
be
wind
up
in
court
where
it
owe
a
employee
or
a
group
of
employee
more
than
€
1500
.
the
Bill
set
the
limit
at
€
10000
,
as
it
be
consider
that
a
great
balance
and
proportionality
must
be
achieve
in
circumstance
where
the
severe
sanction
of
wind
-
up
be
concerned
.
the
section
do
not
distinguish
between
a
employee
and
any
other
creditor
.
in
the
circumstance
,
any
creditor
be
entitle
to
issue
a
letter
demand
payment
and
if
,
after
21
day
,
such
payment
have
not
be
receive
the
creditor
be
entitle
to
petition
the
high
Court
.
I
be
sure
the
deputy
present
can
appreciate
that
petition
the
high
Court
be
not
a
simple
or
low
-
cost
exercise
.
it
would
have
to
be
question
whether
wind
-
up
be
really
the
most
effective
way
to
settle
a
debt
of
€
1500
.
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
be
provision
in
both
employment
and
health
and
safety
law
,
alongside
common
law
remedy
,
which
already
provide
for
the
type
of
situation
describe
.
for
example
,
the
payment
of
Wage
Act
1991
provide
more
efficient
remedy
for
employee
who
have
not
be
pay
they
wage
than
a
attempt
to
have
the
company
wind
up
in
the
high
court
,
with
all
of
the
associate
cost
.

would
fail
in
substance
as
prosecution
thereunder
would
be
doom
to
fail
due
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
phrase
"
breach
of
employment
law
"
.
there
be
no
indication
as
to
what
be
mean
by
this
.
such
provision
be
workable
but
only
in
the
context
of
the
specific
and
appropriate
enactment
,
where
the
transgression
be
clearly
identify
or
identifiable
.
finally
,
the
amendment
propose
that
the
separate
legal
personality
of
the
company
would
be
proceed
against
for
a
transgression
of
civil
law
rather
than
criminal
law
.
in
all
of
the
other
circumstance
where
this
phrase
be
use
,
as
with
health
and
safety
legislation
,
for
example
,
it
require

offence

amendment
no.
175
suggest
that
the
value
of
the
preferential
treatment
of
employee
should
be
increase
to
€
40000
.
the
principal
benefactor
of
section
622
be
the
employee
of
the
company
and
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
the
period
for
which
the
calculation
be
base
,
in
the
context
of
employee
salary
or
wage
in
respect
of
service
render
,
be
four
month
before

up
,
the
appointment
of
a
provisional
liquidator
or
a
passing
of
the
resolution
for
the
wind
up
of
the
company
be
make
.
the
sum
of
€
10000
be
consider
to
offer
sufficient
protection
for
employee
in
this
circumstance
.
I
understand
the
deputy
's
intention
with
this
amendment
.
however
,
we
also
need
to
consider
that
there
be
other
creditor
whose
rights
must
be
protect
in
a
wind
-
up
situation
.
the
Bill
seek
to
offer
a
fair
balance
to
all
.
how
would
one
set
out
in
a
schedule
what
constitute
a
transgression
?
there
be
a
multitude
,
if
not
a
infinite
amount
,
of
potential
transgression

perhaps
the
deputy
could
articulate
exactly
how
he
would
propose
to
do
that
in
advance
of
the
debate
in
the
Seanad
.
without

perhaps
he
would
also
outline

the
transgression

respect
that

the

be
subject

constraint
and
pressure
that

the
moratorium
on

and
the
need

that

this
will
remain
the
case

on

basis
I
be
not
in

the

be
aware
that
there
be
a
transition
period
of
18

there
will
also

a
appropriate

I
be
confident
that

in
all
the
agency

will
be
well
equip

the

the

we

subsection
(

state
that
a

shall
disclose
by
the
filing
of
a

with
the
company
registration
office
a
list
of

and

section
217
(

)
(

oblige
company
to
send
copy
of
the
member
's
register
to
any
person
who
request
it
,
again
for

or

.
this

contain
the
name
and
address
of
member
and
the
number
of

hold
by
each

.
this
also
apply
to
unlimited
company
.
in
relation
to
subsection
(
3
)
and
(
4
)
of
the
amendment
,
it
would
be
costly
to
set
up
a
public
register
of
the
type
set
out
,
in
particular
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
information
be
already
available
by
other
means
.
currently
,
there
be
no
requirement
to
report
this
information
to
the
cro
.
in
this
regard
,
the
deputy
refer
to
the
possibility
of
the
introduction
of
legislation
.
the
deputy
be
free
to
introduce
legislation
to
this
House
.
therefore
,
there
would
be
cost
associate
with
this
for
the
cro
and
the
affect
company
.
the
ongoing
cost
to
the
cro
and
affect
company
of
make
and
process
thousand
of
notification
would
be
colossal
.
the
cost
involve
in
delay
to
transfer
of
ownership
in
share
would
be
unacceptably
and
could
interfere
with
the
constitutional
rights
to
private
property
.
that
be
something
we
all
adhere
to
also
.
I
be
not
sure
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
we
should
remove
unlimited
company
from
Irish
law
altogether
.
limited
company
serve
many
legitimate
business
purpose
and
be
a
feature
of
company
law
across
the
European
Union
.
just
as
guarantee
company
and
public
limited
company
be
important
for
certain
type
of
business
,
unlimited
company
also
serve
a
important
purpose
.
remove
they
would
be
disproportionate
and
would
,
I
would
argue
,
put
Ireland
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
.
if
the
deputy
would
like
to
remove
the
reporting
exemption
from
unlimited
company
,
other
country
across
the
EU
allow
unlimited
company
to
dispense
with
report
requirement
.
this
be
because
report
requirement
be
impose
as
a
quid
pro
quo
of
limited
.
where
there
be
no
limited
liability
there
be
no
reason
to
require
financial
reporting
.
it
be
very
easy
to
state
that
small
business
have
receive
less
favourable
treatment
than
they
big
counterpart
.
I
will
speak
to
the
amendment
.
we
could
become
involved
in
a
argument
with
regard
to
the
support
available
to
small
and
large
business
.
however
,
as
state
in
reply
to
a
previous
amendment
,
between
250
and
300
individual
who
own
small
business
of
various
size
attend
a
event
in
Cork
yesterday
in
order
to
learn
about
the
business
support
provide
by
over
27
agency
of
the
State
.
factually
,
the
deputy
's
statement
be
just
not
correct
.
in
the
context
of
the
amendment
,
the
law
on
unlimited
company
be
govern
by
EU
directive
and
any
propose
change
to
Irish
law
would
produce
few
,
if
any
,
benefit
for
the
creditor
of
such
company
.
however
,
such
change
would
give
rise
to
a
substantial
cost
to
this
country
in
term
of
its
international
commercial
competitiveness
.
Ireland
be
a
small
island
nation
and
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
here
be
responsible
for
employ
many
thousand
of
people
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
in
the
context
of
sub
-
supply
or
in
the
provision
of
service
.
the
fact
that
foreign
direct
investment
company
operate
here
give
rise
to
downstream
benefit
,
in
term
of
supply
,
for
many
of
the
small
business
we
be
discuss
.
I
accept
the
deputy
's
concern
with
regard
to
the
ownership
of
unlimited
company
.
this
issue
will
be
deal
with
in
the
come
month
in
the
context
of
the
accounting
directive
,
which
be
due
for
transposition
in
2015
.
the
debate
relate
to
say
directive
be
the
most
suitable
avenue
for
consider
the
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
.
the
primary
aim
of
the
Bill
before
the
House
be
to
consolidate
and
tidy
up
the
exist
law
.
it
be
also
design
to
provide
a
accessible
,
user
-
friendly
framework
for
business
operate
within
we
shore
.
I
reiterate
that
EU
law
do
not
require
report
on
the
part
of
unlimited
company
.
that
be
the
position
in
law
at
present
.
I
move
amendment
no.

review

fact

place

I
wish
to
read
some
information
into
the
record
of
the
House

the
accountancy
profession
be
,
in
general
,
adaptable
and
agile
and
be
able
to
respond
to
new
market
opportunity
and
direction
.
this
be
,
to
a
great
extent
,
because
it

not

down

there
be
detailed
statutory
provision

,
to
a
less
extent

insolvency
practice

the
Competition
Authority
hold
the
view
that
this
be
the
way
thing
should
stay
.
New
regulation
should
only
be
introduce
where
there
be
clear
evidence
of
market
failure

very
damaging
consumer
harm

that
have
not
be
establish

the
position

when
the
matter
be
review
by

Department
at
the
time

the
view
be
take
that
there
be
no
case
for
introduce
a
system
of
regulation
for
the
profession
generally
.
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
feel
that
introduce
such
a
system
would
put
at
risk
the
flexibility
of
the

its

it

stultify

in
response
to
the
concern
of
the

,
however
,
the

have
agree
to
consult
fully
on

I
be
inform
that

happen
this

we
do
not
have
a
definitive
timeline
in

I

it

agree
that
the

be
complete
in

of

perhaps

to

the

by

large
be
deal

approach

I
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
conclude

I
take
the
point
the

be
make
with
regard
to
tab
a

in
fairness
,
the

,
commit
in
good
faith
to
carry
out
and
conclude
a
review
by
the
end
of
the

.
all
party
involve
will
be
consult

I
hope
we
can
expedite
the

and
that
any

not
delay
the
implementation
of

the
late
PISA
report
from
the
OECD
's
programme
for
international
student
assessment
,
PISA
,
show
that

in
Ireland
perform
at
the

of

.
Ireland
rank
17th
of
the
28
OECD
country
that
take
part
in
the
study
,
and
22nd
out
of
all
44
participate
country
.
country
like
the
Unite

,

,
Denmark
and
Sweden
perform
similarly
to
Ireland
,
while
Canada
,
Australia
,
Finland
and
the
Unite
Kingdom
perform
significantly
good
than
Ireland
.
the
top
six
performing
country
be
in
Asia
,
with
Singapore
rank
first
.
the
performance
of
Irish
student
on
problem
solving
in
this
PISA
study
be
good
but
there
be
considerable
room
for
improvement
.
project
math
and
the
emphasis
on
skill
development
in
the
new
junior
cycle
student
award
,
JCSA
,
offer
student
and
teacher
new
way
of
thinking
and
learning
that
should
improve
we
15
-
year
-
old
's
problem
-
solve
capability
.
as
have
be
articulate
in
other
answer
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
we
be
move
away
from
a
rote
learning
framework
to
one
which
be
inquiry
-
base
and
which
put
the
student
at
the
centre
of
problem
solving
.
therefore
a
paradigm
shift
be
go
on
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
answer
regard
the
cost
of
the
digital
strategy
but
I
will
revert
to
he
with
that
information
.
there
will
be
significant
improvement
in
ICT
infrastructure
with
the
roll
-
out
of
broadband
be
available
to
all
second
-
level
school
in
the
autumn
.
the
priority
and
challenge
of
the
digital
strategy
be
currently
be
examine
as
part
of
a
ongoing
consultative
process
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
we
may
have
to
look
outside
the
Department
concern
the
digital
strategy
and
maybe
incorporate
more
stakeholder
,
include
student
themselves
,
in
meeting
head
-
on
the
challenge
of
PISA
and
learn
from
they
.
as
regards
the
methodology
involve
,
there
be
a
mark
difference
between
paper
-
base
and
computer
-
base
problem
solving
.
we
have
do
extremely
well
vis
-à
-
vis
PISA
on
paper
-
base
problem
.
however
,
there
be
clearly
a
deficit
in
the
presentation
of
scenario
to
student
for
the
purpose
of
PISA
mark
.
one
need
broadband
provision
in
the
first
instance
in
order
to
give
effect
to
a
digital
strategy
.
that
strategy
be
not
yet
under
way
and
work
remain
to
be
do
both
internally
and
externally
.
the
key
purpose
of
this
be
to
ensure
that
student
have
a
proper
understanding
of
the
dynamic
involve
.
person
in
Ireland
be
digital
native
and
instinctively
interface
with
the
technology
both
in
school
and
elsewhere
.
however
,
when
certain
scenario
be
present
to
they
it
show
a
deficit
,
so
we
need
to
discover
why
and
tackle
it
.
that
be
not
merely
a
matter
of
give
more
ipad
or
tablet
to
school
,
it
be
a
question
of
how
the
learning
process
can
be
enhance
as
a
result
of
interaction
with
technology
.
that
be
part
of
the
digital
strategy
which
need
to
be
further
interrogate
.
I
want
to
give
the
deputy
a
proper
answer
.
it
be
not
just
about
throw
money
at
the
problem
,
it
be
also
about
properly
interpret
the
PISA
dynamic
and
compare
the
experience
of
other
country
.
we
can
take
Finland
as
a
exemplar
and
see
how
it
be
do
there
.
we
may
adopt
some
of
that
model
into
a
Irish
system
.
we
be
get
there
but
we
need
to
get
the
ICT
roll
-
out
complete
in
the
first
instance
.
that
be
a
paternalistic
attitude
to
education
.
what
about
parental
responsibility
?
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
sub

on
environment
,
community
and
local

I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
,
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
.
RTE
be
a
independent
national
public
service
broadcaster
,
the
remit
and
obligation
of
which
be
set
out
in
the
Broadcasting
Act
2009
.
section
114
(
1
)
of
the
Act
state
the
principal
object
and
associate
power
of
RTE
,
while
section
98
provide
that
it
shall
be
independent
in
the
pursuance
of
this
object
,
subject
only
to
the
requirement
of
the
act
.
as
such
,
the
minister
have
no
function
in
RTE
's
general
day
-
to
-
day
matter
,
include
decision
on
advertising
.
it
be
clear
that
commercial
revenue
remain
a
key
priority
for
RTE
,
to
which
advertising
revenue
be
central
.
there
have
be
a
considerable
decline
in
advertising
revenue
for
all
broadcaster
since
the
economic
downturn
in
2008
and
the
advertising
market
remain
challenging
for
RTE
.
of
late
,
however
,
there
have
be
modest
and
tentative
sign
of
stabilisation
.
the
minister
be
satisfied
that
RTE
be
continue
its
effort
to
exploit
all
commercial
opportunity
in
pursuance
of
its
statutory
object
.
the
contention
that
RTE
refuse
to
accept
advertising
from
rival
broadcaster
be
materially
incorrect
.
in
fact
,
it
have
carry
advertisement
for
several
rival
broadcaster
,
include
Sky
,
Setanta
,
Newstalk
,
TG4
and
TV3
,
in
recent
time
.
it
have
advise
departmental
official
that
it
have
no
objection
to
continue
to
do
so
,
provide
the
propose
advertisement
conform
to
its
own
internal
guideline
.
notwithstanding
the
corporation
's
continue
objective
to
maximise
its
advertising
revenue
,
to
which
I
refer
,
RTE
do
have
internal
guideline
which
it
provide
for
all
advertising
copy
house
with
broadcaster
client
in
order
for
a
advertisement
to
be
clear
for
broadcast
.
this
guideline
state
RTE
do
not
accept
advertisement
where
,
inter
alia
,
the
advertising
broadcaster
claim
superiority
over
or
denigrate
another
broadcaster
,
or
request
the
audience
to
tune
in
to
another
channel
.
I
be
advise
that
this
be
the
only
circumstance
in
which
advertisement
for
other
broadcaster
may
be
refuse
for
broadcast
by
RTE
.
it
would
clearly
not
be
in
the
company
's
commercial
interest
to
clear
for
transmission
on
its
own
broadcasting
service
a
advertisement
which
serve
to
denigrate
RTE
or
effectively
ask
viewer
to
discontinue
use
RTE
service
.
if
a
broadcaster
be
not
satisfied
with
RTE
's
decision
to
refuse
to
clear
a
advertisement
for
broadcast
,
it
may
refer
the
matter
to
the
Competition
Authority
,
the
independent
statutory
body
that
enforce
Irish
and
European
competition
law
.
the
Department
do
not
have
a
function
in
the
oversight
of
complaint
of
this
nature
.
on
a
related
matter
and
by
way
of
update
,
arise
from
the
five
year
review
of
funding
of
public
service
broadcaster
,
the
Department
have
commission
Indecon
to
conduct
a
economic
assessment
of
the
advertising
market
in
Ireland
to
inform
the
development
of
a
revise
regulatory
framework
.
this
review
which
be
expect
to
be
complete
in
the
come
month
will
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
market
,
include
a
analysis
of
issue
around
pricing
and
competition
,
and
for
the
introduction
of
a
revise
system
for
set
advertising
minute
.
I
accept
the
statement
make
by
the
deputy
.
if
one
be
to
trawl
through
recording
of
RTE
radio
programme
,
one
might
come
across
instance
where
advertisement
for
show
on
sister
station
be
broadcast
.
I
listen
to
RTE
radio
and
this
practice
can
sometimes
seem
contradictory
.
I
also
note
the
comment
make
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
.
however
,
the
reply
I
have
just
read
clearly
indicate
that
there
be
guideline
which
apply
within
RTE
in
whether
it
accept
advertisement
from
other
broadcaster
.
the
station
have
set
down
its
own
rule
in
this
matter
.
we
all
take
the
minister
's
comment
seriously
,
but
it
must
be
note
that
he
may
have
be
speak
in
a
personal
capacity
.
I
do
not
hear
the
comment

I
imagine
that
what
the
minister
have
to
say
have
come
to
the
attention
of
that
in
RTE
.
while
it
be
important
that
the
national

retain
its

common

must
ultimately
apply
in
this
issue
.
I
accept
the
statement
make
by
the
deputy
.
if
one
be
to
trawl
through
recording
of
RTE
radio
programme
,
one
might
come
across
instance
where
advertisement
for
show
on
sister
station
be
broadcast
.
I
listen
to
RTE
radio
and
this
practice
can
sometimes
seem
contradictory
.
I
also
note
the
comment
make
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
.
however
,
the
reply
I
have
just
read
clearly
indicate
that
there
be
guideline
which
apply
within
RTE
in
whether
it
accept
advertisement
from
other
broadcaster
.
the
station
have
set
down
its
own
rule
in
this
matter
.
we
all
take
the
minister
's
comment
seriously
,
but
it
must
be
note
that
he
may
have
be
speak
in
a
personal
capacity
.
I
do
not
hear
the

this

.
the
question
as
tab
relate
to
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
.
the
late
quarterly
national
household
survey
publish
by
the
CSO
on
26
May
show
that
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
fall
by
2200
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
.
we
acknowledge
that
fall
.
it
be
a
very
diverse
sector
and
it
appear
the
experience
be
different
in
different
part
.
in
April
,
overall
,
the
volume
and
value
of
retail
sale
be
up
by
6.8
%
and
4.4
%
on
the
same
period
last
year
.
growth
be
concentrate
in
the
motor
,
furniture
,
clothing
,
hardware
and
electrical
sector
.
by
contrast
,
decline
be
record
in
the
volume
of
activity
in
grocery
,
book
and
newspaper
,
and
pharmacy
.
structural
change
,
such
as
trade
online
,
be
occur
in
the
sector
and
be
undoubtedly
play
a
role
.
on
the
other
hand
,
a
increase
in
the
KBC
-
ESRI
consumer
sentiment
index
for
April
,
which
put
Irish
consumer
sentiment
at
its
strong
level
since
January
2007
,
be
encouraging
.
however
,
the
key
challenge
be
to
translate
this
improvement
into
job
in
the
retail
sector
.
this
year
's
action
plan
for
Jobs
include
a
number
of
measure
to
support
the
retail
sector
.
this
measure
include
the
establishment
of
a
retail
consultation
forum
to
provide
a
platform
for
a
structure
engagement
between
the
retail
sector
and
relevant
Department
and
government
agency
.
its
purpose
be
to
allow
key
issue
of
relevance
to
the
sector
to
be
discuss
,
with
a
view
to
identify
practical
action
which
could
be
take
by
the
government
,
or
by
industry
itself
,
to
support
the
sector
.
the
first
meeting
of
the
forum
will
take
place
on
9
June
.
the
Action
Plan
for
Jobs
also
include
measure
to
address
issue
that
impact
on
cost
competitiveness
in
the
sector
,
the
introduction
of
a
number
of
structural
measure
to
support
the
retail
sector
,
and
the
continuation
of
the
online
trading
initiative
and
the
integrate
licensing
application
system
for
the
retail
sector
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
Irish
shopper
spend
€
3.8
billion
in
online
trading
in
2012
.
some
75
%
of
the
revenue
go
outside
the
State
.
while
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
,
we
must
tackle
this
through
deputy
Tóibín
's
committee
,
which
will
do
some
work
on
town
centre
planning
.
if
we
be
talk
about
retailer
,
which
he
mention
,
it
be
a
question
of
how
town
centre
be
structure
and
how
we
encourage
great
trading
.
I
be
sure
the
work
of
the
deputy
's
committee
will
feed
into
the
retail
consultation
forum
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
the
retail
consultation
forum
comprise
retail
retail
Ireland
,
retail
Excellence
Ireland
,
RGDATA
,
Chambers
Ireland
,
the
small
Firm
Association
and
individual
retail
practitioner
.
through
that
consultation
process
,
we
will
address
issue
like
town
centre
shopping
,
e-commerce
,
drive
more
business
online
from
Irish
retailer
,
and
the
cost
to
business
of
retail
.
there
be
specific
issue
in
the
grocery
sector
that
require
to
be
address
.
we
must
look
at
budget
2015
to
see
if
there
be
any
way
of
enhance
demand
through
the
process
.
we
must
also
look
at
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2015
,
the
home
renovation
incentive
scheme
and
the
impact
of
the
9
%
vat
rate
.
the
question
tab
by
the
deputy
concern
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
and
I
be
confident
that
,
through
a
process
of
consultation
involve
all
the
stakeholder
,
thorough
engagement
and
give
effect
to
many
initiative
that
arise
from
the
retail
consultation
forum
,
we
can
work
towards
increase
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
retail
sector
.
we
wholeheartedly
acknowledge
that
,
year
-
on
-
year
between
2013
and
2014
,
there
have
be
a
drop
of
5,900
in
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
sector
.
we
must
do
something
to
address
that
decline
and
the
decline
of
we
town
through
the
doughnut
effect
.
the
deputy
refer
to
the
retailer
he
be
meet
and
the
level
of
confidence
.
through
engage
with
that
retailer
and
they
representative
organisation
,
we
can
arrest
the
decline
.
I
be
confident
that
,
once
the
process
start
on
9
June
,
we
will
take
action
.
in
the
three
year
before
the
government
come
into
office
,
more
than
300000
job
have
be
lose
across
the
economy
.
the
construction
,
retail
and
tourism
sector
be
particularly
badly
hit
and
collectively
account
for
over
two
third
of
the
job
loss
.
almost
150000
job
be
lose
in
the
construction
sector
alone
between
the
beginning
of
2008
and
the
beginning
of
2011
.
in
2012
,
the
government
introduce
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
as
the
main
policy
instrument
to
tackle
the
employment
crisis
and
to
assist
job
creation
.
now
in
its
third
annual
iteration
,
the
action
plan
have
set
about
transform
the
operating
environment
for
business
by
seek
to
identify
and
remove
barrier
to
competitiveness
and
by
place
employment
on
the
agenda
of
every
Department
.
the
late
employment
figure
publish
by
the
Central
Statistics
Office
show
there
be
a
increase
of
42700
people
in
employment
in
the
first
quarter
of
2014
,
compare
to
the
first
quarter
of
2013
.
there
be
a
increase
of
63200
in
the
number
in
employment
in
the
last
two
year
.
this
figure
be
net
of
reduction
in
public
sector
number
.
more
than
67
%
of
the
job
create
since
2012
have
be
full
time
.
in
the
last
six
month
,
almost
all
the
job
create
in
the
economy
be
full
time
.
the
sector
that
have
consistently
perform
well
be
agriculture
,
food
and
fishing
,
accommodation
and
food
service
,
tourism
and
professional
,
scientific
and
technical
activity
.
this
sector
have
be
the
focus
for
attention
under
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
.
in
2013
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
client
company
have
record
year
for
employment
creation
,
generate
a
total
of
12500
net
new
job
in
export
-
focus
activity
.
this
pattern
suggest
the
job
be
create
be
add
value
to
the
economy
and
have
every
potential
to
be
sustainable
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
focus
on
sector
that
do
not
experience
a
job
recovery
over
the
past
two
year
.
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
,
which
we
discuss
early
,
continue
to
suffer
job
loss
,
while
the
pattern
be
similar
in
the
construction
sector
.
there
be
move
to
intervene
in
both
sector
.
there
be
a
specific
policy
instrument
for
the
construction
sector
.
construction
2020
set
out
a
series
of
policy
intervention
in
consultation
with
sectoral
representative
regard
how
the
housing
shortage
can
be
address
and
how
the
sector
,
which
take
a
major
hit
,
particularly
in
the
three
year
prior
to
2011
,
can
be
stimulate
.
yes
.
a
specific
initiative
be
under
way
,
particularly
aim
at
the
Dublin
region
,
under
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
.
I
can
engage
further
with
the
deputy
on
this
.
I
understand
from
EI
that
it
have
be
actively
promote
the
site
concern
to
a
number
of
interested
party
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
disclose
the
detail
of
that
interaction
for
commercially
sensitive
reason
.
however
,
task
force
have
be
use
in
the
past
as
part
of
a
response
to
a
sudden
loss
of
a
large
number
of
industrial
job
.
more
recently
,
other
initiative
be
increasingly
use
as
a
alternative
to
task
force
.
in
this
regard
,
the
establishment
of
LEOs
,
recently
announce
by
government
,
mean
that
all
category
of
business
,
include
sole
trader
,
micro
business
and
sme
have
access
to
government
support
and
advice
.
the
LEO
be
the
first
-
stop
shop
for
anyone
seek
information
and
support
on
start
or
enhance
a
business
.
the
active
promotion
of
the
site
be
take
place
.
EI
be
actively
engage
in
seek
to
ensure
the
job
that
be
lose
be
replace
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
a
company
like
this
to
a
town
like
Fethard
.
in
south
Tipperary
,
where
Enterprise
Ireland
be
the
lead
agency
in
effort
to
ensure
we
replace
and
create
job
,
there
be
76
client
company
employ
more
than
2000
people
in
full
-
time
job
.
this
be
the
figure
for
2013
.
in
excess
of
€9
million
worth
of
grant
have
be
pay
to
client
company
since
2011
.
I
assure
the
deputy
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
work
actively
as
the
representative
State
agency
in
seek
to
ensure
we
can
replace
the
job
that
have
be
lose
.
it
be
actively
promote
the
site
to
a
number
of
interested
party
as
we
speak
.
as
far
as
I
be
aware
,
there
be
no
formal
task
force
work
on
this
,
such
as
the
task
force
for
the
south
east
where
all
the
agency
be
work
together
.
I
assure
the
deputy
,
however
,
that
the
local
agency
be
work
together
.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
the
pre-eminent
State
agency
and
it
be
work
proactively
on
this
.
it
be
promote
the
site
to
a
number
of
interested
party
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
that
process
to
take
shape
.
I
be
sure
he
will
acknowledge
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
work
with
interested
party
to
seek
to
replace
the
job
that
have
be
lose
.
the
deputy
should
use
private
member
's
time
to
do
so
.
I
doubt
Sinn
Féin
will
use
private
member
's
time
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
tab
the
question
.
in
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2014
,
develop
a
good
environment
for
entrepreneurship
be
a
key
disruptive
reform
.
the
work
of
the
Entrepreneurship
Forum
have
be
a
valuable
input
to
identify
area
for
fruitful
initiative
.
the
Department
be
develop
a
national
policy
statement
on
entrepreneurship
.
as
part
of
this
process
,
the
forum
's
recommendation
be
be
evaluate
with
input
from
Department
and
agency
.
already
,
a
significant
number
of
initiative
have
be
take
which
respond
to
the
forum
's
evaluation
.
this
include
the
launch
of
the
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
the
initiation
of
a
competition
to
find
and
to
invest
in
the
good
young
entrepreneur
at
local
and
national
level
,
the
creation
of
a
new
ICT
skill
strategy
2014
-
18
,
the
establishment
of
knowledge
transfer
Ireland
and
its
online
database
of
innovative
idea
,
as
well
as
turn
that
idea
that
come
from
intellectual
property
through
the
university
and
institute
of
technology
into
new
company
.
in
addition
,
a
review
of
mentoring
be
be
prepare
by
Forfás
and
a
review
of
tax
support
be
under
way
for
entrepreneur
.
the
initiative
also
include
a
assessment
of
how
the
agency
in
the
Department
can
deliver
target
improvement
in
the
environment
for
business
,
particularly
for
start
-
up
,
and
the
preparation
of
a
strategy
statement
2014
-
16
by
Enterprise
Ireland
with
new
ambition
for
high
-
potential
start
-
up
.
there
be
a
strong
belief
that
the
start
-
up
area
offer
huge
opportunity
for
enhance
performance
and
job
growth
by
the
Irish
enterprise
sector
and
the
government
be
determined
to
facilitate
this
through
a
national
policy
statement
on
entrepreneurship
.
many
of
the
recommendation
make
actually
cut
across
measure
that
be
be
implement
anyway
.
it
be
unfair
to
suggest
that
the
government
be
not
engage
proactively
with
the
recommendation
.
it
acknowledge
wholeheartedly
the
role
play
by
the
chairman
and
individual
member
in
bring
forward
this
recommendation
.
I
can
tell
the
deputy
that
,
internally
,
there
be
no
sense
of
lethargy
about
engage
properly
.
however
,
he
must
acknowledge
that
if
one
be
to
take
all
the
recommendation
,
of
which
there
be
at
least
69
,
one
must
have
some
sort
of
process
to
ensure
the
State
agency
can
respond
and
that
there
be
a
interdepartmental
response
.
as
I
outline
already
in
my
initial
reply
,
the
government
have
launch
the
local
enterprise
office
,
which
will
cut
across
a
lot
of
the
recommendation
make
.
similarly
,
the
ICT
skill
strategy
will
cut
across
a
lot
of
the
recommendation
that
be
make
,
as
will
the
review
by
Forfás
on
mentoring
.
consequently
,
there
be
no
sense
that
the
Department
be
not
engage
with
the
recommendation
.
I
assure
the
deputy
and
that
people
who
have
be
in
contact
with
the
deputy
and
who
may
have
express
concern
that
the
government
be
absolutely
and
utterly
intent
on
ensure
that
the
national
policy
statement
will
reflect
the
view
put
forward
and
the
recommendation
propose
.
I
do
not
answer
the
question
on
the
number
of
people
who
have
be
assign
.
a
number
of
people
have
be
appoint
through
Enterprise
Ireland
in
Asia
,
comprise
ten
new
people
across
Asia
.
I
can
get
a
specific
figure
for
the
deputy
in
respect
of
China
.
to
my
mind
,
the
interdepartmental
approach
work
quite
rapidly
at
present
.
if
one
examine
again
the
recommendation
make
in
the
Entrepreneurship
Forum
report
,
it
be
evident
that
the

I
reiterate
that
I
be
not
rule
anything
out
in

of

on
this

I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
time
and

for
the
various
interest
in
the
various
Department
to
do
the
work
that
need

be
not
something
that
can

with
this

ask
about
my
contact
with
the

I
have
not
initiate
any

on
this

the
Garda
Síochána
be
a
independent
state

and
investigative
organisation
.
I
do
not
direct
it
on
matter
of
crime

seek
to
initiate
criminal
investigation
.
the
force
will
be
expect
to
exercise
judgment
with

to
allege
criminal
activity
in
this
case
,
in
the
same
way
as
it
do
in

of
any

investigation

it
be
important
that
each
department
with

surround

be
not

consult
,

the

parental

,
the

,

,
with

and

the
Department
continue
to
closely
monitor
the
financial
position
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
expenditure
remain
within
the
allocation
for
the
year
.
this
government
have
seek
to
protect

and
maintain

line

as
far
as
possible
.
however
,
level
of

cannot
be
determine
in
a
manner
that
ignore
the
economic
reality
.
consequently
,
there
be
no
scope
to
reverse
the
decision
take
in

to
reduce

.
funding
for
future
minor
work
and
summer
work
scheme
be
subject
to
funding
.
I
agree
with
some
of
the
sentiment
of
the
deputy
.
in
a
perfect
world
,
we
would
have
the
perfect
pot
of
money
to
allow
we
to
do
everything
we
could
within
the
education
sphere
to
ensure
the
amount
of
voluntary
contribution
make
by
parent
through
charitable
donation
and
fundraising
be
lessen
considerably
.
there
be
a
macroeconomic
picture
,
however
,
and
we
must
reduce
the
deficit
to
3
%
by
a
certain
year
.
Fianna
Fáil
subscribe
to
that
philosophy
and
that
mean
the
education
silo
have
a
finite
pot
of
money
.
to
govern
be
to
choose
,
and
we
must
make
choice
about
where
to
allocate
funding
.
with
regard
to
the
comment
about
electioneering
,
deputy
McConalogue
's
party
be
a
dab
hand
at
make
announcement
prior
to
election
.
let
we
take
the
cynicism
out
of
it
and
say
that
we
have
try
to
ensure
we
put
money
into
school
through
the
minor
work
scheme
and
the
summer
work
scheme
where
it
be
necessary
.
some
school
miss
out
because
of
the
prioritisation
process
,
but
they
be
not
be
cut
out
of
the
pot
.
hopefully
,
this
school
will
go
in
the
pot
for
next
year
,
and
it
be
the
intention
,
if
we
be
€500
million
ahead
of
profile
in
term
of
overall
taxation
receipt
,
that
it
will
reflect
positively
on
the
education
budget
.
this
will
allow
we
to
fund
project
such
as
that
outline
in
the
question
.
in
March
2011
,
the
macroeconomic
picture
in
this
country
be
abysmal
and
we
be
a
programme
country
.
however
,
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
the
capital
budget
and
we
have
a
five
-
year
programme
where
we
be
replace
prefab
and
build
new
school
.
therefore
,
in
spite
of
the
economic
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
we
have
be
able
to
build
out
and
replace
the
prefab
that
have
be
in
existence
since
the
height
of
the
boom
.
therefore
,
there
be
no
doubt
the
government
's
commitment
to
try
to
ensure
funding
be
put
in
place
for
necessary
work
.
we
have
not
yet
start
the
proper
discussion
around
budget
2015
.
therefore
,
it
would
be
premature
to
give
a
absolute
commitment
at
this
stage
.
however
,
if
we
have
commit
funding
for
this
year
,
2014
,
and
if
the
economic
profile
be
get
good
,
one
would
be
hopeful
.
that
be
all
one
can
say
.
if
the
deputy
be
stand
where
I
be
stand
,
this
be
what
he
would
be
say
.
we
would
hope
to
be
in
a
position
to
try
to
ensure
that
school
fund
for
the
necessary
repair
and
minor
work
will
be
provide
,
but
we
cannot
say
that
for
certain
until
we
have
get
through
the
negotiation
on
budget
2015
.
the
position
be
that
Ireland
receive
funding
for
a
European
globalisation
adjustment
fund
,
EGF
,
programme
to
support
redundant
worker
from
SR
Technics
.
this
consist
of
a
personalised
package
of
guidance
,
training
,
educational
and
enterprise
support
which
be
deliver
to
the
eligible
worker
concern
during
a
implementation
period
from
March
2009
to
October
2011
.
measure
include
tuition
cost
of
the
ALBA
degree
in
all
Hallows
which
,
normally
be
a
part
-
time
programme
,
be
deliver
on
a
tailor
full
-
time
basis
to
accommodate
the
specific
requirement
of
this
worker
give
the
finite
timeframe
for
EGF
co-fund
support
.
when
this
funding
cease
,
the
Department
provide
a
grant
as
a
once
-
off
measure
to
this
cohort
of
student
to
complete
they
study
.
the
Department
allocate
funding
to
the
HEA
for
direct
disbursement
to
approve
high
education
institute
and
the
internal
disbursement
be
a
matter
for
the
governing
body
.
the
provision
of
course
be
a
matter
for
individual
institution
as
autonomous
body
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
all
Hallows
be
a
private
college
and
be
not
in
receipt
of
core
grant
funding
.
however
,
the
Department
provide
grant
in
lieu
of
tuition
fee
funding
to
the
college
in
respect
of
three
approve
undergraduate
course
.
this
funding
amount
to
over
€
430000
for
the
2013
-
2014
academic
year
in
respect
of
the
119
eligible
student
who
attend
course
for
the
full
year
.
the
ALBA
programme
refer
to
by
the
deputy
be
a
part
-
time
course
and
be
,
therefore
,
not
a
approve
course
for
free
fee
funding
.
a
decision
be
make
to
provide
specific
funding
-
initially
under
the
EGF
and
subsequently
by
means
of
the
grant
scheme
-
to
certain
student
,
namely
,
former
employee
of
SR
Technics
who
undertake
the
course
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
when
the
EGF
funding
be
withdraw
,
the
Department
agree
to
support
the
full
-
time
qualifying
student
to
complete
they
study
.
this
be
ex-SR
technics
employee
who
be
undertake
the
ALBA
degree
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
as
already
state
,
the
institution
be
autonomous
body
in
they
own
right
.
I
hope
this
answer
the
deputy
's
question
.
I
be
not
unsympathetic
to
the
case
the
deputy
be
make
,
particularly
in
view
of
the
impact
the
course
have
have
on
that
individual
who
,
as
he
state
,
be
out
of
formal
education
for
such
a
long
period
.
I
contend
that
it
be
not
necessarily
for
the
Department
to
intervene
.
in
circumstance
in
which
a
course
of
this
nature
could
be
provide
by
another
institution
,
I
would
make
the
argument
that
it
would
be
a
matter
for
that
institution
to
subsume
it
into
its
own
programme
of
course
.
a
exception
be
make
.
it
must
be
remember
that
it
be
a
part
-
time
course
and
that
funding
would
not
normally
be
provide
in
such
circumstance
.
the
deputy
refer
to
a
particular
institution
,
but
there
be
any
number
of
institution
throughout
the
State
which
could
,
subject
to
they
internal
criterion
,
subsume
the
course
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
I
do
not
know
how
the
Department
could
intervene
in
that
matter
.
in
fact
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
mechanism
to
allow
it
to
do
so
.
it
be
a
result
of
the
EGF
and
the
specific
circumstance
relate
to
SR
Technics
that
a
intervention
be
make
in
this
instance
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
the
positive
impact
of
that
intervention
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
one
could
set
a
precedent
in
respect
of
any
number
of
other
course
which
could
be
bring
through
the
Department
to
be
deliver
out
into
specific
institution
.
however
,
we
must
recognise
the
autonomy
of
individual
institution
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
the
deputy
have
raise
this
issue
previously
.
I
hope
,
therefore
,
that
I
be
not
repeat
the
same
reply
to
the
deputy
.
to
date
,
the
Department
have
not
receive
any
formal
submission
from
parent
in
north
Kildare
on
the
provision
of
a
gaelcholáiste
in
the
north
-
eastern
Kildare
region
.
there
be
a
five
year
construction
plan
which
be
well
establish
.
the
establishment
of
any
new
school
be
,
therefore
,
consider
in
the
context
of
the
overall
need
for
additional
school
place
to
meet
future
demographic
demand
.
the
deputy
have
probably
hear
this
before
.
I
acknowledge
that
there
be
one
post
-
primary
school
in
Maynooth
,
Maynooth
post
-
primary
school
.
a
new
post
-
primary
school
,
Maynooth
community
college
,
will
be
add
to
the
provision
this
September
.
it
will
have
a
all
-
Irish
aonad
,
which
be
the
nub
of
the
issue
.
I
will
sit
down
with
the
deputy
who
may
wish
to
address
that
point
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
total
of
80
place
be
be
make
available
through
the
aonad
.
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
the
demand
from
the
community
for
a
gaelcholáiste
be
such
that
the
aonad
be
not
a
sufficient
response
,
we
will
have
to
find
a
way
of
facilitate
a
further
conversation
base
on
a
interrogation
of
the
survey
.
the
reply
furnish
to
I
suggest
that
include
in
the
first
year
enrolment
at
the
new
school
will
be
a
allocation
of
31
student
for
the
all
-
Irish
aonad
.
while
there
be
no
waiting
list
for
the
aonad
,
a
additional
85
first
year
place
can
be
fill
in
Maynooth
community
college
.
this
place
can
be
fill
either
in
the
aonad
,
on
the
English
language
side
of
the
school
or
between
the
two
facility
,
depend
on
demand
.
obviously
,
there
be
a
gap
between
what
the
Department
and
the
community
be
say
and
,
somehow
,
we
be
go
to
have
to
work
to
bridge
it
.
I
will
speak
with
the
deputy
after
question
Time
.
I
be
open
to
correction
,
but
it
be
my
understanding
the
Department
have
confirm
that
,
if
be
demonstrate
that
there
be
sufficient
demand
for
education
through
the
medium
of
Irish
in
the
aonad
over
a
four
year
cycle
,
the
establishment
of
a
independent
gaelcoláiste
can
be
consider
.
the
deputy
and
I
will
discuss
the
matter
.
I
be
aware
of
the
concern
of
all
the
patron
of
small
rural
school
,
include
that
of
a
Protestant
etho
.
how
good
to
sustain
provision
for
widely
disperse
and
small
Protestant
community
present
as
a
particular
challenge
,
especially
in
any
locality
where
the
number
enrol
in
the
school
be
decline
to
single
figure
and
amalgamation
be
not
a
option
because
there
be
no
other
school
nearby
.
the
government
be
intent
on
foster
pluralism
in
school
provision
.
support
minority
church
in
maintain
they
school
be
part
of
that
policy
.
nevertheless
,
resource
have
to
be
distribute
to
school
in
a
transparent
and
equitable
manner
.
in
this
regard
,
pupil
number
be
the
fair
basis
on
which
to
allocate
resource
to
a
school
,
irrespective
of
its
type
.
eight
small
school
of
a
Protestant
etho
be
successful
in
they
staffing
appeal
for
September
2014
.
on
the
deputy
's
question
on
dialogue
,
there
be
continue
dialogue
on
ensure
pluralism
within
the
education
system
.
let
I
refer
to
a
specific
example
.
with
the
Bishop
of
Cork
,
Cloyne
and
Ross
,
Dr.
Paul
Colton
,
and
Mr.
Owens
of
Cork
Education
and
Training
Board
,
we
have
in
Mallow
,
where
a
small
Church
of
Ireland
school
close
,
fashioned
a
new
model
that
will
create
a
precedent
for
a
education
and
training
board
to
join
a
Church
of
Ireland
school
in
create
a
brand
new
school
.
what
we
be
talk
about
be
ensure
the
recognition
of
the
faith
and
the
right
of
that
with
that
faith
to
educate
they
community
accordingly
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
there
be
a
model
,
or
model
,
to
allow
this
to
continue
.
it
be
worth
note
that
there
be
194
primary
school
with
a
Protestant
or
Presbyterian
etho
out
of
a
total
of
3146
.
base
on
the
enrolment
figure
for
September
2013
,
nine
of
that
have
one
teacher
,
73
have
two
teacher
and
36
have
three
or
more
.
therefore
,
there
be
recognition
of
the
community
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
.
it
be
a
matter
of
how
we
apply
lateral
thinking
in
come
up
with
solution
when
number
be
decrease
in
individual
school
to
such
a
extent
that
we
need
to
consider
new
model
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
.
there
be
satisfactory
dialogue
on
ensure
the
future
of
this
school
and
on
recognise
the
challenge
they
face
regard
pluralism
in
education
.
the
answer
to
the
deputy
's
question
be
"
yes
"
.
I
move
amendment
no.

the
Member

they
comment
and
what
be
a
fruitful
debate
on
the
Bill
during
its
passage
through
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
Bill
be
not
design
to
solve
all
the
issue
affect
the
co-operative
sector
but
to
address
a
number
of
particular
issue
that
have
be
identify
by
the
sector
as
be
area
of
most
press
concern
.
I
thank
the
co-operative
sector
,
particularly
the
umbrella
body
-
the
Irish
co-operative
Organisation
Society

warmly
welcome
the
reduction
in
the
administrative
burden
place
on
it
and
the
flexibility

I
believe
that

couple

charge

of
friendly
Society
-

of
organisation

commit
to
in

programme
for
government

the

when

I
do
not
accept
the

's
inference
that
US
foreign
investment

level

the

export
from

element

they

in

while

client

a
important

economy

it
should
be
remember
that
employment

represent
less
than
9
%
of

Irish

the

of

from

figure

capacity

.
this
be
taxpayer
's
money
be
invest
effectively
through
Enterprise
Ireland
to
support
the
indigenous
sector
.
in
the
past
decade
the
influence
of
the
Internet
on
the
economy
have
be
grow
steadily
,
about
which
there
be
no
doubt
.
in
2013
Indecon
Consultants
estimate
that
digitalrelated
activity
contribute
4.4
%
of
gdp
to
the
economy
.
the
consultant
predict
that
this
contribution
would
increase
by
16
%
year
on
year
.
almost
95000
job
be
already
support
by
digital
-
related
activity
in
the
economy
.
notwithstanding
this
trend
,
CSO
datum
suggest
only
23
%
of
small
company
in
Ireland
be
engage
in
sale
through
e-commerce
.
the
proportion
be
consider
to
be
even
low
for
company
with
few
than
ten
employee
.
this
company
be
potentially
lose
valuable
sale
opportunity
in
both
the
Irish
market
and
in
sell
overseas
.
it
be
estimate
that
Irish
consumer
spend
just
under
€
6
billion
online
annually
,
of
which
60
%
to
70
%
go
overseas
.
encourage
more
indigenous
company
to
engage
in
e-commerce
be
,
therefore
,
a
key
objective
of
the
government
's
national
digital
strategy
and
a
action
plan
for
Jobs
.
the
2014
action
plan
include
a
commitment
to
roll
out
a
trading
online
voucher
scheme
to
2000
micro
and
small
business
by
the
end
of
2015
.
the
scheme
be
intend
as
a
catalyst
to
support
business
to
start
trade
online
or
improve
they
current
online
trading
offering
,
rather
than
simply
have
a
online
presence
and
there
be
a
qualitative
difference
.
it
provide
successful
applicant
with
a
voucher
up
to
the
value
of
€
2500
to
help
meet
this
objective
.
the
value
of
the
voucher
must
be
match
by
the
applicant
company
.
the
trading
online
voucher
scheme
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
.
however
,
the
voucher
will
be
administer
by
the
local
enterprise
office
.
follow
a
piloting
of
the
scheme
by
the
Dublin
City
Enterprise
Office
at
the
start
of
the
year
,
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
announce
the
national
roll
-
out
of
the
scheme
last
week
.
applicant
business
will
be
select
on
the
basis
of
they
project
plan
,
include
they
expect
growth
in
job
and
export
as
a
result
of
trade
online
.
there
be
strong
recognition
by
the
government
of
the
size
of
the
spend
and
its
impact
on
gdp
.
the
advent
of
the
online
trading
voucher
through
the
local
enterprise
office
,
LEOs
,
be
a
concrete
policy
intervention
in
recognise
this
trend
and
provide
funding
towards
support
business
.
on
the
eligibility
criterion
,
the
voucher
will
be
available
to
a
maximum
figure
of
€
2500
.
approval
must
be
obtain
prior
to
incur
any
expense
and
third
party
cost
only
will
be
consider
.
all
third
party
supplier
invoice
must
contain
proper
business
detail
.
this
be
a
robust
document
that
greatly
encourage
business
that
may
have
have
a
online
presence
but
which
be
not
trade
online
.
it
will
be
for
the
leo
to
advertise
locally
to
ensure
business
will
come
into
they
.
the
important
point
be
that
we
have
recognise
the
potential
value
and
create
a
solution
through
the
roll
-
out
of
the
trading
online
voucher
scheme
.
in
term
of
the
early
result
under
the
pilot
scheme
,
seven
out
of
ten
company
state
the
voucher
application
process
have
already
help
they
to
determine
how
online
trading
would
fit
into
they
business
.
some
70
%
of
the
company
involve
in
the
pilot
scheme
in
Dublin
have
receive
more
customer
inquiry
,
while
55
%
have
have
more
sale
.
there
be
a
provision
within
the
LEO
infrastructure
to
allow
that
company
that
wish
to
trade
online
do
so
and
we
be
already
see
a
positive
impact
.
it
be
impossible
to
give
the
exact
figure
for
how
much
the
State
will
spend
in
support
this
activity
,
but
there
be
a
provision
available
and
it
have
be
roll
out
across
the
State
in
the
piloting
of
the
scheme
.
the
demand
from
small
local
business
to
participate
have
be
extremely
high
.
it
will
take
we
a
little
time
to
have
datum
on
the
number
of
business
that
have
come
in
and
how
this
have
have
a
impact
on
they
business
.
be
the
deputy
speak
from
experience
there
?
during
the
Irish
Presidency
in
June
2013
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
secure
the
agreement
of
all
trade
minister
in
the
EU
Council
,
to
formally
open
negotiation
with
the
US
on
a
transatlantic
trade
and
investment
partnership
,
TTIP
.
at
a
time
of
high
unemployment
we
must
grasp
every
opportunity
that
add
to
the
momentum
of
recovery
that
government
policy
be
achieve
.
in
particular
,
huge
potential
be
offer
by
TTIP
to
accelerate
economic
growth
,
and
expand
trade
and
export
opportunity
.
this
give
we
the
potential
to
create
more
job
so
that
the
already
fall
unemployment
rate
can
be
more
quickly
reduce
.
Ireland
have
particularly
strong
economic
link
with
the
US
,
with
over
100000
people
employ
in
500
US
company
here
and
with
Irish
company
export
over
€
1
billion
in
goods
and
service
to
the
US
every
year
.
if
we
add
in
export
from
foreign
company
locate
here
,
over
€
26
billion
in
goods
and
service
be
sell
to
the
high
value
US
market
.
this
give
a
clear
indicator
of
the
opportunity
we
can
leverage
from
few
barrier
to
transatlantic
trade
.
the
Department
recently
engage
Copenhagen
Economics
to
examine
the
economic
and
other
impact
of
TTIP
and
relate
potential
opportunity
.
some
tentative
and
preliminary
finding
suggest
that
the
impact
on
we
economy
might
be
as
large
as
a
additional
1.1
%
increase
in
gdp
.
this
be
high
than
the
estimate
0.5
%
gdp
gain
from
TTIP
for
the
EU
as
a
whole
.
in
employment
term
,
this
could
lead
to
a
additional
8,000
job
for
Ireland
over
the
agreement
's
implementation
period
.
however
,
considerable
further
analysis
need
to
be
do
by
the
consultant
to
clarify
what
the
impact
of
TTIP
will
be
.
in
term
of
employment
,
benefit
be
likely
to
accrue
,
particularly
to
sector
such
as
life
science
,
ICT
,
food
and
manufacturing
.
this
include
a
large
number
of
sme
.
I
hope
this
would
gain
disproportionately
because
the
type
of
barrier
that
TTIP
aim
to
tackle
,
be
more
costly
for
small
company
to
deal
with
.
we
be
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
upside
and
be
not
view
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
downside
.
we
will
do
a
proper
analysis
,
but
it
be
be
undertake
with
a
view
to
a
economic
win
.
to
be
helpful
,
as
the
minister
deal
with
the
first
matter
have
not
arrive
,
I
suggest
we
take
the
second
matter
first
.
I
thank
deputy
Stanton
for
raise
this
matter
.
both
deputy
Stanton
and
I
be
play
as
a
tag
team
in
respect
of
this
issue
because
it
be
pertinent
to
we
constituency
.
the
area
refer
to
have
be
identify
by
my
department
as
one
of
the
area
where
due
to
demographic
change
it
be
project
that
there
will
be
a
requirement
for
significant
additional
school
provision
at
both
primary
and
post
-
primary
level
over
the
come
year
.
I
think
deputy
Stanton
first
identify
the
precipice
that
have
be
reach
in
respect
of
that
demographic
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
since
that
time
,
we
have
be
work
together
to
get
this
project
over
the
line
.
we
have
have
success
particularly
in
respect
of
Midleton
and
the
Gaelscoil
at
Mainistir
to
Corann
.
Building

to
facilitate

in

to
this
particular

project
,
a

that
involve

and
one

Educate

the
site
acquisition
be
ongoing
at
present
.
I
have
already
refer
to
the
new
24
-
classroom
school
building
to
replace
a
exist
temporary
school
building
for
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
this
be
go
through
the
rapid
planning
process
as
we
speak
.
the
deputy
have
also
refer
to
the
possible
need
for
another
primary
school
because
of
the
demographic
challenge
.
in
that
regard
,
a
new
16
-
classroom
primary
school
with
patronage
to
be
decide
will
be
build
and
a
new
1000

primary
school
be
due
to
be
establish
under
the
patronage
of
Cork
etb
involve
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Cloyne
.
the
Department
,
with
the
assistance
of
Cork
County
Council
,
have
identify
and
be
currently
engage
in
the
site
acquisition
process
for
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
project
in
Carrigtwohill
refer
to
by
the
deputy
.
once
site
be
acquire
,
the
school
project
concerned
will
be
progress
immediately
through
the
architectural
planning
process
.
I
want
to
assure
the
people
of
this
area
and
deputy
Stanton
that
I
as
a
minister
of
State
in
that
Department
be
personally
oversee
that
project
.
the
deputy
and
I
have
discuss
the
commercial
sensitivity
around
specific
site
.
give
that
we
have
have
some
success
so
far
in
respect
of
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
,
a
issue
that
go
on
into
its
second
decade
,
and
the
fact
that
the
planning
process
have
now
start
,
I
be
confident
we
will
continue
to
give
this
top
priority
in
respect
of
Carrigtwohill
.
I
can
assure
the
deputy
and
the
people
of
that
area
that
we
be
work
on
this
on
a
daily
basis
and
we
will
continue
to
work
,
if
I
dare
say
it
,
as
a
tag
team
on
the
government
side
of
this
House
to
deliver
this
necessary
project
.
I
understand
that
the
site
notice
be
up
for
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
I
think
that
be
the
project
refer
to
by
deputy
Stanton
.
the
deputy
and
I
have
be
through
the
process
of
tease
out
the
site
acquisition
.
I
suppose
that
it
be
one
of
the
flaw
in
the
system
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
there
be
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
local
authority
,
when
one
be
seek
to
acquire
privately
own
land
and
there
be
a
market
value
on
the
land
.
there
be
a
inherent
challenge
there
because
of
the
constitutional
right
to
private
property
and
the
market
value
inherent
therein
.
on
top
of
that
,
if
there
be
a
number
of
site
that
have
be
designate
,
there
be
certain
commercial
sensitivity
around
that
.
I
be
confident
that
because
we
have
be
through
the
Gaelscoil
Midleton
process
together
,
the
same
energy
be
be
apply
to
the
challenge
in
Carrigtwohill
.
I
be
confident
that
once
the
site
be
acquire
,
we
can
move
rapidly
.
if
I
retain
my
position
or
indeed
regardless
of
my
position
,
I
will
continue
to
advocate
with
the
deputy
on
ensure
that
we
can
move
rapidly
to
get
this
school
build
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
definitive
timeframe
at
this
point
but
both
he
and
the
people
in
that
area
should
be
assure
of
we
commitment
to
ensure
that
we
deliver
within
the
five
-
year
planning
programme
.
that
be
the
aim
.
it
be
ominous
that
she
send
I
here
to
reply
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
Tánaiste
and
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Burton
.
as
the
deputy
say
,
we
acknowledge
the
crucial
role
carer
play
in
society
.
in
2014
the
estimate
Department
expenditure
on
various
support
for
carer
will
be
almost
€
886
million
,
comprise
approximately
€557
million
on
the
carer
's
allowance
,
€
21.5
million
on
carer
's
benefit
,
€
122
million
on
the
respite
care
grant
and
€
105.1
million
on
domiciliary
care
allowance
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
highlight
one
of
this
key
support
for
carer
provide
by
the
Department
,
namely
,
the
respite
care
grant
.
the
grant
be
introduce
in
June
1999
,
at
which
time
the
Department
of
Health
also
pay
a
respite
care
grant
to
people
receive
domiciliary
care
allowance
who
be
not
in
receipt
of
carer
's
allowance
or
carer
's
benefit
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
the
domiciliary
care
allowance
scheme
transfer
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
in
2009
as
do
responsibility
for
the
related
respite
care
grant
.
in
2005
the
stand
-
alone
respite
care
grant
be
introduce
for
all
full
-
time
carer
.
all
respite
care
grant
be
now
administer
by
the
Department
.
although
the
grant
be
not
subject
to
a
means
test
,
applicant
be
not
eligible
for
the
grant
if
they
be
work
more
than
15
hour
per
week
outside
the
home
,
if
they
be
get
a
jobseeker
's
payment
or
if
they
be
sign
on
for
credit
.
there
be
no
obligation
on
carer
to
use
the
respite
care
grant
to
access
respite
service
.
the
value
of
the
grant
stand
at
€
1,375
and
this
year
it
be
estimate
that
the
grant
will
be
pay
to
some
87000
person
at
a
cost
of
€
122
million
.
a
person
care
for
more
than
one
person
receive
a
grant
for
each
person
for
whom
they
care
.
the
grant
be
pay
on
the
first
Thursday
in
June
of
the
relevant
year
to
cover
52
week
from
this
date
.
as
it
be
a
advance
payment
,
the
type
of
circumstance
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
already
cover
.
the
grant
be
not
pay
on
a
proportional
basis
and
in
order
to
qualify
a
person
must
,
in
addition
to
other
criterion
,
be
caring
for
at
least
six
month
.
the
mid-year
June
payment
date
allow
carer
to
avail
of
respite
over
the
summer
month
,
facilitate
the
administration
of
the
grant
and
ensure
that
the
grant
be
target
at
that
provide
full
-
time
care
over
a
significant
period
of
time
.
in
a
review
of
the
grant
undertake
by
the
Department
in
recent
year
,
carer
be
ask
about
they
preference
regard
payment
.
the
option
of
split
the
grant
into
two
or
three
payment
through
the
year
be
put
to
people
and
the
vast
majority
of
respondent
,
84
%
,
indicate
that
they
would
prefer
no
change
to
the
current
arrangement
.
this
view
be
prevalent
irrespective
of
age
group
,
social
welfare
status
,
gender
,
location
,
number
of
care
recipient
or
marital
status
.
in
favour
the
current
annual
payment
,
people
express
the
view
that
a
large
lump
sum
would
be
more
likely
to
be
use
for
a
specific
purpose
,
such
as
a
holiday
,
whereas
small
sum
pay
more
frequently
would
be
more
likely
to
be
absorb
in
the
day
-
to
-
day
expense
of
the
household
.
in
general
,
respondent
state
that
they
be
very
pleased
to
receive
the
grant
and
that
it
be
very
helpful
to
they
in
ease
the
financial
stress
they
have
be
experience
.
that
who
use
the
grant
for
a
holiday
generally
feel
that
the
break
would
not
have
be
possible
without
the
grant
.
person
who
use
the
grant
for
other
purpose
,
particularly
to
pay
regular
household
bill
,
consider
that
the
grant
eas
they
financial
worry
generally
.
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
work
carer
do
,
which
be
part
of
the
Irish
psyche
and
the
intergenerational
solidarity
that
exist
here
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
government
will
increase
the
payment
because
we
be
not
in
a
position
,
regard
the
budget
arithmetic
,
to
ascertain
whether
there
be
scope
to
do
so
.

this

it

Ireland
be
work
directly
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
and
internationally
on
a
comprehensive
and
effective
response
to
the
ebola
epidemic
in
west
Africa
.
we
must
see
it
in
the
context
of
where
Ireland
sit
.
Ireland
be
very
much
part
of
the
international
response
which
sit
within
the
UN
infrastructure
where
there
be
a
special
UN
envoy
,
Mr.
Anthony
Banbury
,
who
be
on
the
ground
in
the
three
country
,
Sierra
Leone
,
Liberia
and
Guinea
in
particular
.
I
do
not
participate
in
the
donor
conference
in
London
last
week
because
I
be
in
Sierra
Leone
.
the
President
of
Sierra
Leone
be
unable
to
attend
the
conference
and
we
meet
he
in
Sierra
Leone
.
the
issue
here
be
not
the
monetary
response
per
se
.
I
be
confident
that
,
through
the
UN
infrastructure
,
the
political
willingness
exist
give
the
mandate
the
United
Nation
have
to
deal
with
this
.
from
a
European
Union
perspective
,
I
tend
to
agree
with
the
deputy
's
point
in
that
there
need
to
be
a
more
robust
political
response
at
a
EU
level
to
ensure
that
,
with
the
€
180
million
which
be
commit
by
the
EU
,
there
be
a
political
pressure
or
diplomatic
effort
apply
in
that
country
as
well
as
a
medical
and
humanitarian
response
to
ensure
that
system
-----
I
request
a
little
latitude
,
if
I
may
-
just
30
second
.
if
deputy
Smith
be
talk
about
medical
evacuation
,
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
clarity
such
that
when
Irish
people
go
out
there
to
help
in
the
effort
,
there
be
some
degree
of
assurance
that
they
can
have
a
pathway
back
to
the
most
appropriate
treatment
centre
.
the
national
response
on
this
be
discuss
at
cabinet
this
morning
.
this
will
take
a
interdepartmental
group
because
we
need
to
ensure
if
there
be
person
come
back
from
west
Africa
who
display
symptom
that
there
be
a
clear
pathway
from
they
house
or
place
of
work
directly
to
a
fully
staff
and
equip
hospital
-
wherever
that
may
be
within
the
country
-
and
that
there
be
a
clear
protocol
.
that
be
something
that
be
be
discuss
.
it
be
a
live
issue
as
we
speak
.
if
Sierra
Leonean
health
care
worker
be
not
work
on
the
ground
,
for
instance
,
because
they
may
not
have
be
pay
for
a
number
of
month
,
and
if
they
do
not
have
confidence
in
they
own
system
on
the
ground
,
and
I
can
only
speak
for
Sierra
Leone
,
it
be
difficult
to
ask
a
Irish
front
-
line
health
care
worker
to
work
in
that
circumstance
.
that
be
where
the
UN
co-ordinator
,
Mr.
Banbury
,
be
work
.
he
be
work
with
we
ambassador
and
Irish
ngo
,
such
as
GOAL
,
concern
and
Plan
Ireland
so
that
there
be
a
cross-sectoral
approach
to
deal
with
this
.
I
be
not
say
one
take
it
out
of
Sierra
Leonean
hand
,
but
one
manage
and
internationalise
the
effort
.
it
be
only
in
the
past
72
hour
that
we
be
see
a
major
ramping
up
of
that
effort
.
I
assure
the
deputy
that
this
be
be
discuss
in
term
of
a
Irish
response
on
the
ground
if
somebody
should
contract
the
virus
when
on
Irish
soil
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
debate
about
beef
price
.
beef
farmer
be
face
a
crisis
because
of
the
price
they
be
get
for
they
cattle
and
they
stock
.
I
agree
with
what
Deputy
McNamara
and
Martin
Ferris
have
to
say
about
the
issue
in
the
beef
sector
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
beef
market
in
this
State
be
control
by
a
small
number
of
processor
who
manipulate
and
control
the
price
that
farmer
can
achieve
for
they
stock
when
they
take
it
to
the
mart
.
that
be
the
crux
of
the
problem
for
the
beef
sector
in
this
country
.
the
average
income
of
beef
farmer
be
between
€
12,000
and
€
13000
per
annum
.
it
be
not
viable
for
they
.
they
be
struggle
.
farmer
along
the
west
coast
,
particularly
in
County
Donegal
,
be
depend
on
this
sector
.
there
be
just
three
operator
in
the
processing
sector
.
this
be
what
they
do
.
they
natural
tendency
be
to
maximise
they
profit
.
they
do
this
by
manipulate
price
.
that
be
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
that
be
what
they
do
.
the
problem
,
unfortunately
,
be
that
this
activity
be
not
police
in
this
State
.
I
recognise
that
live
export
have
increase
.
I
look
at
the
Bord
Bia
figure
today
.
the
minister
mention
that
there
have
be
increase
of
15
%
,
but
I
suggest
we
should
set
a
target
of
achieve
a
increase
of
30
%
or
50
%
.
that
would
provide
the
competition
in
the
mart
that
we
be
all
talk
about
.
if
the
processor
have
to
compete
,
they
will
end
up
pay
a
living
,
reasonable
price
for
the
stock
they
buy
from
farmer
.
over
the
past
15
or
20
year
,
hundred
of
small
abattoir
have
to
close
after
increase
regulation
and
standard
be
force
on
they
.
when
they
be
force
out
of
the
market
,
it
take
many
people
who
would
have
be
buy
cattle
at
mart
out
of
the
mart
and
out
of
the
cattle
-
purchase
sector
.
that
be
one
example
of
how
the
processor
have
manage
to
get
rid
of
competition
.
competition
be
further
diminish
when
live
export
be
reduce
.
the
processor
have
all
the
control
.
while
I
accept
the
minister
set
up
the
beef
forum
,
I
suggest
it
merely
involve
politely
ask
the
processor
to
do
something
to
improve
the
way
they
deal
with
farmer
and
to
increase
they
price
.
it
have
no
tooth
.
the
minister
must
have
some
tooth
if
he
be
to
enforce
the
requirement
on
the
processor
to
act
reasonably
and
responsibly
.
I
do
not
believe
the
multiple
play
a
huge
part
in
Ireland
in
term
of
the
price
that
farmer
can
get
.
we
export
90
%
of
what
we
produce
through
the
factory
.
if
the
multiple
here
be
pay
good
price
,
it
would
not
trickle
down
because
it
would
involve
no
more
than
10
%
of
the
stock
that
go
through
processor
.
the
big
problem
be
the
control
the
factory
exert
on
the
market
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
think
about
to
where
this
lead
back
.
I
read
a
article
today
trace
the
genesis
of
the
crisis
in
the
beef
sector
back
to
last
year
's
horsemeat
scandal
.
the
rationale
for
the
article
be
that
the
supermarket
and
multiple
in
England
start
to
put
pressure
on
processor
to
ensure
they
stick
rigidly
to
certain
specification
.
the
processor
then
use
that
specification
to
push
down
the
price
at
the
mart
.
what
have
happen
in
the
Department
in
the
period
since
the
horsemeat
crisis
threaten
we
beef
sector
?
have
there
be
any
follow
-
up
on
the
horsemeat
crisis
?
be
there
any
prosecution
outstanding
?
be
anything
happen
that
will
force
the
processor
to
act
responsibly
in
the
future
?
that
be
the
kind
of
pressure
we
need
to
put
on
they
if
we
be
to
ensure
they
behave
responsibly
.
we
should
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
examine
the
operation
of
this
country
's
beef
sector
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
processing
.
if
we
be
to
address
this
issue
,
we
must
look
seriously
at
the
competition
aspect
of
it
.
I
see
a
quote
from
the
minister
today
to
the
effect
that
the
Competition
Authority
have
suggest
that
the
beef
sector
be
very
competitive
.
when
I
go
through
the
Competition

's
website
,
I
could
not
find
any
reference
to
the
investigation
of
the
beef
sector
.
I
do
not
see
any
evidence
of
a
outcome
of
a
investigation
contain
a
finding
that
the

competitive

the
minister
should
be
ask
the
Competition

to
assess
the
level
of
competition
in
the
beef
sector
.
he
also
need
to
increase
live

ensure

have
to

accept
the
minister
set
up
the
beef
forum
,
I
suggest
it
merely
involve
politely
ask
the
processor
to
do
something
to
improve
the
way
they
deal
with
farmer
and
to
increase
they
price
.
it
have
no
tooth
.
the
minister
must
have
some
tooth
if
he
be
to
enforce
the
requirement
on
the
processor
to
act
reasonably
and
responsibly
.
I
do
not
believe
the
multiple
play
a
huge
part
in
Ireland
in
term
of
the
price
that
farmer
can
get
.
we
export
90
%
of
what
we
produce
through
the
factory
.
if
the
multiple
here
be
pay
good
price
,
it
would
not
trickle
down
because
it
would
involve
no
more
than
10
%
of
the
stock
that
go
through
processor
.
the
big
problem
be
the
control
the
factory
exert
on
the
market
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
think
about
to
where
this
lead
back
.
I
read
a
article
today
trace
the
genesis
of
the
crisis
in
the
beef
sector
back
to
last
year
's
horsemeat
scandal
.
the
rationale
for
the
article
be
that
the
supermarket
and
multiple
in
England
start
to
put
pressure
on
processor
to
ensure
they
stick
rigidly
to
certain
specification
.
the
processor
then
use
that
specification
to
push
down
the
price
at
the
mart
.
what
have
happen
in
the
Department
in
the
period
since
the
horsemeat
crisis
threaten
we
beef
sector
?
have
there
be
any
follow
-
up
on
the
horsemeat
crisis
?
be
there
any
prosecution
outstanding
?
be
anything
happen
that
will
force
the
processor
to
act
responsibly
in
the
future
?
that
be
the
kind
of
pressure
we
need
to
put
on
they
if
we
be
to
ensure
they
behave
responsibly
.
we
should
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
examine
the
operation
of
this
country
's
beef
sector
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
processing
.
if
we
be
to
address
this
issue
,
we
must
look
seriously
at
the
competition
aspect
of
it
.
I
see
a
quote
from
the
minister
today
to
the
effect
that
the
Competition
Authority
have
suggest
that
the
beef
sector
be
very
competitive
.
when
I
go
through
the
Competition
Authority
's
website
,
I
could
not
find
any
reference
to
the
investigation
of
the
beef
sector
.
I
do
not
see
any
evidence
of
a
outcome
of
a
investigation
contain
a
finding
that
the
sector
be
competitive
.
the
minister
should
be
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
assess
the
level
of
competition
in
the
beef
sector
.
he
also
need
to
increase
live
export
and
ensure
processor
have
to
pay
reasonable
price
for
they
produce
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
debate
about
beef
price
.
beef
farmer
be
face
a
crisis
because
of
the
price
they
be
get
for
they
cattle
and
they
stock
.
I
agree
with
what
Deputy
McNamara
and
Martin
Ferris
have
to
say
about
the
issue
in
the
beef
sector
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
beef
market
in
this
State
be
control
by
a
small
number
of
processor
who
manipulate
and
control
the
price
that
farmer
can
achieve
for
they
stock
when
they
take
it
to
the
mart
.
that
be
the
crux
of
the
problem
for
the
beef
sector
in
this
country
.
the
average
income
of
beef
farmer
be
between
€
12,000
and
€
13000
per
annum
.
it
be
not
viable
for
they
.
they
be
struggle
.
farmer
along
the
west
coast
,
particularly
in
County
Donegal
,
be
depend
on
this
sector
.
there
be
just
three
operator
in
the
processing
sector
.
this
be
what
they
do
.
they
natural
tendency
be
to
maximise
they
profit
.
they
do
this
by
manipulate
price
.
that
be
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
that
be
what
they
do
.
the
problem
,
unfortunately
,
be
that
this
activity
be
not
police
in
this
State
.
I
recognise
that
live
export
have
increase
.
I
look
at
the
Bord
Bia
figure
today
.
the
minister
mention
that
there
have
be
increase
of
15
%
,
but
I
suggest
we
should
set
a
target
of
achieve
a
increase
of
30
%
or
50
%
.
that
would
provide
the
competition
in
the
mart
that
we
be
all
talk
about
.
if
the
processor
have
to
compete
,
they
will
end
up
pay
a
living
,
reasonable
price
for
the
stock
they
buy
from
farmer
.
over
the
past
15
or
20
year
,
hundred
of
small
abattoir
have
to
close
after
increase
regulation
and
standard
be
force
on
they
.
when
they
be
force
out
of
the
market
,
it
take
many
people
who
would
have
be
buy
cattle
at
mart
out
of
the
mart
and
out
of
the
cattle
-
purchase
sector
.
that
be
one
example
of
how
the
processor
have
manage
to
get
rid
of
competition
.
competition
be
further
diminish
when
live
export
be
reduce
.
the
processor
have
all
the
control
.
while
I
accept
the
minister
set
up
the
beef
forum
,
I
suggest
it
merely
involve
politely
ask
the

to

it

on
the

that
would
mean
a
effective
tax
rate
of
59
%
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
custom
and
inland
revenue
(
include
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.
I
reiterate
what
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
say
in
respect
of
we
ability
to
maintain
we
commitment
in
respect
of
ODA
,
namely
,
official
development
assistance
or
overseas
development
aid
,
as
it
be
sometimes
know
.
in
the
context
of
the
partner
organisation
with
which
we
work
and
which
operate
under
the
auspices
of
Irish
Aid
,
the
cumulative
figure
provide
show
that
we
have
be
able
to
marginally
increase
the
level
of
we
financial
commitment
.
this
be
the
first
occasion
in
quite
a
number
of
year
that
we
have
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
this
commitment
because
of
the
work
do
by
we
partner
organisation
,
of
which
there
be
many
.
there
be
no
good
example
in
this
regard
than
the
current
crisis
involve
Ebola
.
work
on
the
ground
and
under
the
auspices
of
Irish
Aid
,
partner
organisation
such
as
concern
and
Goal
be
have
a
major
impact
in
term
of
deliver
humanitarian
assistance
and
help
to
build
capacity
in
the
affect
region
.
this
organisation
have
the
flexibility
to
react
to
this
crisis
and
to
become
major
stakeholder
in
the
fight
against
Ebola
in
the
country
most
affect
,
such
as
Sierra
Leone
.
the
Ebola
crisis
be
have
a
impact
across
transnational
boundary
.
however
,
the
partner
organisation
-
as
a
result
of
funding
which
be
smartly
divest
to
they
through
Irish
Aid
-
be
also
make
a
impression
in
what
one
might
term
"
a
live
setting
"
.
it
be
important
that
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
we
financial
commitment
in
this
area
and
I
be
grateful
to
the
government
for
facilitate
we
in
do
so
.
as
a
island
nation
on
the
western
periphery
of
Europe
which
do
not
have
any
military
standing
,
it
be
important
-
in
term
of
what
we
do
abroad
-
that
part
of
we
foreign
policy
relate
to
target
funding
towards
nutrition
,
hunger
and
poverty
alleviation
.
the
funding
provide
will
allow
we
to
continue
the
work
to
which
I
refer
and
to
deepen
we
engagement
,
particularly
with
partner
country
-
such
as
Sierra
Leone
-
with
which
we
have
bilateral
relationship
and
in
which
we
have
ambassadorial
mission
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
work
be
do
by
Ireland
,
through
its
mission
and
ambassador
,
in
Sierra
Leone
in
the
context
of
influence
-
in
conjunction
with
international
organisation
such
as
the
UN
mission
-
the
government
there
to
pursue
a
policy
of
contain
the
crisis
.
that
be
only
one
articulation
or
example
of
the
impact
we
partner
organisation
,
such
as
Goal
and
concern
,
be
have
there
.
it
be
important
to
recognise
the
work
they
do
and
keep
faith
with
this
commitment
,
and
I
be
pleased
to
say
that
we
have
do
so
.
we
have
demonstrate
we
commitment
in
the
budget
by
ensure
there
will
be
no
reduction
in
Ireland
's
overall
official
development
assistance
for
2015
.
we
have
allocate
€600
million
for
ODA
.
while
there
be
a
slight
reduction
in
vote
27
,
as
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
have
say
,
there
will
be
no
reduction
in
Ireland
's
overall
oda
commitment
for
2015
.
we
will
increase
it
slightly
,
depend
on
the
eventual
outturn
for
2014
.
anyway
,
we
anticipate
there
will
be
a
slight
increase
.
we
have
be
recognise
internationally
for
successfully
stabilise
we
development
budget
in
the
past
three
year
after
severe
cut
and
in
the
face
of
serious
economic
difficulty
.
maintain
the
budget
by
provide
€
601
million
for
Ireland
's
aid
programme
will
be
see
as
a
significant
Irish
contribution
in
2015
.
next
year
will
be
the
international
year
of
development
and
I
expect
Ireland
will
continue
to
play
a
lead
role
at
the
Unite
Nation
in
negotiate
a
new
set
of
global
development

to

from

no

which
be
amazing
when
one
consider
we

not

,
but
Sinn

claim
that
in

there
be

to

neither
do
it
mention
any

it
want

provide
for
a
additional
€
35
million
to

this
will
bring
to
€
125
million
the
total
investment
by
the
government
in

service
since
2012
.
the
additional

will
enable
the

,
to
continue
to
develop

modernise
we
mental

in

with

the

this
will

through

achieve
a
consistent

it
should
not

the
pathway

the

in

I
be

not

with
any
of
this

however
,
this
be
not
confine
to
old
people
;
it
can
also
affect
chronically
ill
young
people
.
we
have
set
aside
€
27
million
to
address
this
problem
in
the
short
term
.
the
long
-
term
strategy
will
examine
intensive
rehabilitation
that
can
get
people
,
whatever
they
age
,
back
home
into
they
own
community
.
it
will
also
help
that
at
home
who
have
become
immobile
-
bedridden
,
as
it
use
to
be
call
-
to
receive
intensive
rehabilitation
care
and
get
out
again
.
it
will
involve
grant
for
home
improvement
and
housing
adaptation
,
which
have
all
be
increase
.
deputy
Dessie
Ellis
know
I
do
not
stand
in
here
slag
people
off
because
I
do
not
believe
it
get
anyone
anywhere
.
we
need
to
find
solution
to
the
problem
we
all
want
to
solve
.
primary
care
will
be
roll
out
with
the
co-operation
of
the
Irish
Medical
Organisation
and
GPs
.
we
will
deliver
free
gp
care
to
all
child
under
six
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
with
the
co-operation
of
gps
and
the
imo
.
without
it
,
it
simply
can
not
be
do
.
I
hope
the
negotiation
between
the
imo
and
the
Department
will
be
successful
,
which
look
as
though
it
will
be
the
case
.
we
need
to
take
a
more
humane
approach
to
discretionary
medical
card
.
member
know
of
family
that
have
extraordinary
medical
need
.
while
they
may
be
over
the
financial
limit
to
be
eligible
for
a
card
,
we
need
to
take
a
more
holistic
view
on
all
of
this
.
I
hope
this
will
happen
too
.
I
always
say
it
be
about
the
politics
of
the
next
impossible
task
.
the
follow
story
describe
this
perfectly
.
there
be
two
guy
sit
down
to
breakfast
.
one
say
to
the
other
that
butter
toast
will
always
land
with
the
butter
side
down
if
it
fall
from
the
table
.
the
other
guy
say
it
will
be
more
a
case
of
50:50
.
the
first
guy
proceed
to
drop
he
butter
toast
to
the
ground
.
it
land
,
however
,
butter
-
side
-
up
.
the
second
guy
say
that
just
prove
it
be
always
50:50
,
to
which
the
first
guy
say
,
''
no
,
I
just
butter
the
wrong
side
.
''
it
be
the
same
when
it
come
to
the
Opposition
-
no
government
will
ever
do
it
right
in
its
eye
.
I
believe
we
be
do
a
very
good
job
in
the
difficult
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
I
be
very
grateful
that
we
have
extraordinarily
talented
people
in
the
Civil
Service
and
public
service
to
help
we
do
that
job
.
I
thank
deputy
Smith
for
raise
this
issue
and
I
thank
he
for
he
kind
word
.
it
be
appropriate
to
have
this
discussion
on
Ebola
today
,
give
the
rapid
deterioration
in
the
situation
in
west
Africa
over
the
past
month
and
with
case
appear
elsewhere
in
the
world
.
this
debate
be
particularly
timely
,
give
that
the
Ebola
crisis
be
discuss
at
the
EU
foreign
affair
Council
meeting
yesterday
and
will
be
discuss
at
the
European
Council
late
this
week
.
the
late
World
Health
Organisation
figure
be
alarming
-
well
over
9000
people
infect
by
Ebola
,
and
over
4500
death
in
west
Africa
.
despite
all
the
effort
of
the
international
community
,
the
likelihood
be
that
the
situation
will
deteriorate
further
before
it
improve
.
I
meet
Mr.
Banbury
when
I
be
in
Freetown
in
Sierra
Leone
.
he
indicate
to
we
that
the
crisis
would
get
bad
before
it
get
good
.
Ireland
have
be
very
actively
engage
at
all
level
in
address
the
crisis
on
the
ground
and
internationally
.
as
the
deputy
be
aware
,
I
travel
to
Sierra
Leone
at
the
start
of
the
month
and
witness
at
first
hand
the
devastating
impact
of
Ebola
there
.
I
come
away
from
my
visit
with
three
strong
impression
.
there
be
a
key
gap
in
leadership
and
co-ordination
,
which
I
be
glad
to
say
be
now
be
fill
by
the
UN
emergency
Ebola
mission
,
UNMEER
,
head
by
Mr.
Nabarro
and
co-ordinate
by
Mr.
Banbury
.
there
remain
important
funding
need
and
this
have
be
recognise
in
yesterday
's
motion
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
.
there
be
a
need
to
scale
up
capacity
for
isolation
and
treatment
.
there
be
a
urgent
need
for
more
international
health
care
professional
to
staff
the
isolation
and
treatment
centre
.
Ireland
be
one
of
a
very
small
number
of
EU
member
state
with
a
embassy
in
Freetown
.
I
be
strike
during
my
visit
by
the
very
strong
advocacy
and
co-ordination
role
be
play
by
the
Irish
ambassador
-
designate
,
Ms
Walsh
,
and
she
small
and
dedicated
team
.
Ireland
be
work
closely
with
international
partner
and
other
,
include
the
US
and
the
UK
and
the
government
of
Sierra
Leone
,
in
the
fight
against
Ebola
.
the
question
of
co-ordination
be
a
key
issue
if
the
Ebola
virus
be
to
be
tackle
effectively
in
the
west
Africa
region
and
if
its
spread
to
other
country
be
to
be
prevent
.
this
be
discuss
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
in
Luxembourg
yesterday
which
be
attend
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
.
the
Council
's
decision
yesterday
represent
a
important
further
step
in
EU
effort
to
tackle
the
crisis
by
reaffirm
the
need
to
work
together
in
a
co-ordinate
way
and
to
pool
we
strength
.
I
wish
to
assure
the
deputy
that
as
a
result
of
visit
Sierra
Leone
it
be
my
view
that
Ireland
must
use
its
influence
at
the
Unite
Nation
and
through
the
European
Council
to
support
the
need
for
a
pan-European
or
strong
EU
response
to
this
crisis
.
the
bilateral
response
be
a
powerful
one
but
it
be
not
sufficient
to
tackle
the
nature
of
this
crisis
.
there
be
a
clear
need
for
health
worker
and
other
key
personnel
to
be
represent
on
the
ground
.
the
Council
meeting
yesterday
recognise
the
need
to
support
international
health
responder
.
it
agree
that
the
EU
will
provide
appropriate
care
for
they
,
include
the
possibility
of
medical
evacuation
if
necessary
.
we
must
now
work
urgently
to
ensure
it
be
implement
in
full
.
I
can
only
speak
for
Sierra
Leone
.
I
concur
absolutely
with
the
deputy
on
he
remark
on
the
effort
of
the
ngo
.
the
work
do
by
GOAL
,
concern
,
Plan
and
other
agency
be
extremely
effective
.
the
Irish
government
's
response
be
that
we
need
to
be
flexible
in
we
approach
and
Irish
Aid
,
which
be
very
close
to
the
NGO
community
,
be
be
allow
to
pivot
towards
the
Ebola
response
.
the
big
concern
I
have
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
official
development
assistance
be
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
we
need
to
ensure
we
do
not
spark
a
humanitarian
crisis
in
all
of
this
.
the
nutrition
programme
be
deliver
need
to
continue
apace
.
instinctively
,
I
think
the
deputy
be
right
about
the
underreporting
.
it
be
only
a
matter
of
week
since
I
be
there
,
and
it
be
at
that
juncture
the
UN
have
come
to
Sierra
Leone
in
particular
.
now
that
Mr.
Banbury
have
be
appoint
as
co-ordinator
,
we
ambassador
be
work
very
closely
on
liais
with
the
Sierra
Leone
government
to
ensure
we
assist
in
build
the
infrastructure
to
treat
people
medically
on
the
ground
,
and
this
response
be
happen
.
it
be
a
fair
assumption
that
where
there
be
no
international
involvement
until
relatively
recently
,
and
instead
reliance
on
the
Sierra
Leone
department
of
health
,
social
welfare
or
education
to
deliver
programme
with
the
ngo
,
there
be
a
certain
lack
of
capacity
and
the
ngo
be
punch
above
they
weight
.
now
we
have
international
co-ordination
and
various
government
have
respond
proactively
.
I
agree
absolutely
the
European
response
need
to
be
rapid
.
the
resolution
yesterday
,
arise
from
the
Luxembourg
meeting
,
be
significant
because
it
recognise
for
the
first
time
the
need
to
ensure
we
protect
health
worker
who
go
out
there
.
a
live
issue
we
be
deal
with
when
I
be
there
be
the
need
to
ensure
local
Sierra
Leonean
health
worker
be
pay
,
because
they
have
not
be
pay
for
quite
a
period
of
time
.
it
be
difficult
to
expect
a
Irish
or
Spanish
health
worker
to
go
there
if
the
Sierra
Leonean
health
worker
be
not
be
pay
and
be
stay
away
.
there
be
a
strike
at
one
stage
.
this
be
the
issue
we
be
deal
with
.
we
be
very
effective
and
make
solid
progress
on
this
issue
.
I
agree
the
international
response
need
to
be
more
proactive
,
but
for
we
part
as
member
of
the
European
Union
we
have
have
a
influence
in
bring
this
to
bear
,
in
term
of
we
intervention
through
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
yesterday
.
we
be
keep
a
daily
watch
on
this
because
we
want
to
ensure
where
possible
case
be
deal
with
medically
within
the
region
.
this
be
the
most
effective
way
of
deal
with
case
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
might
have
write
a
different
pre-budget
statement
about
the
capacity
of
people
to
bear
even
more
austerity
because
of
the
crisis
memory
,
as
refer
to
by
deputy
Paul
Murphy
,
have
it
be
write
follow
the
demonstration
last
Saturday
week
.
it
get
that
very
wrong
.
what
the
demonstration
show
be
that
people
have
have
enough
and
they
be
not
willing
to
take
any
more
.
I
apologise
to
the
minister
for
not
be
present
for
he
speech
.
the
reason
I
be
late
be
because
I
be
attend
a
meeting
to
organise
the
next
big
demonstration
which
will
take
place
on
1
November
.
he
will
see
that
last
Saturday
week
be
not
a
one
-
off
event
but
be
part
of
a
grow
and
sustained
revolt
throughout
the
country
with
people
say
they
have
have
it
and
they
be
draw
a
line
with
water
charge
or
any
attempt
to
make
they
pay
any
more
for
the
crime
of
other
such
as
banker
and
bondholder
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
have
get
it
very
wrong
on
that
front
.
I
have
no
problem
with
the
concept
of
independent
monitoring
or
overview
of
government
economic
policy
in
term
of
ensure
policy
be
not
pursue
which
would
create
instability
or
crisis
.
I
would
equally
say
democratically
elect
government
and
,
more
important
,
the
people
who
elect
they
must
ultimately
have
the
freedom
to
make
they
own
decision
.
I
do
not
have
a
problem
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
say
he
do
not
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
and
the
government
will
do
thing
in
its
own
way
because
,
ultimately
,
such
decision
must
be
make
by
the
people
.
the
problem
I
have
be
that
this
so
-
call
independent
group
have
be
set
up
by
the
troika
and
its
main
task
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
a
banking
and
financial
crisis
that
be
not
create
by
they
but
be
create
by
the
financial
institution
,
the
big
political
institution
in
Europe
and
the
political
establishment
in
this
country
.
its
main
job
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
that
.
that
have
be
a
terrible
price
.
the
choice
we
be
offer
be
between
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
say
we
have
to
continue
down
this
road
and
take
a
further
€
2
billion
out
of
the
economy
,
thus
inflict
even
more
suffering
on
ordinary
people
,
or
the
government
's
claim
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
because
its
policy
be
such
a
fantastic
success
that
it
be
not
necessary
to
do
so
,
that
we
be
out
of
the
wood
now
due
to
its
policy
which
chart
the
way
forward
,
and
that
perhaps
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
do
not
fully
understand
just
how
fantastically
successful
the
government
's
policy
have
be
,
which
be
the
reason
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
a
further
cut
of
€
2
billion
.
both
of
that
option
be
false
,
but
there
be
aspect
of
truth
in
both
.
I
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
's
statement
that
the
downside
risk
in
term
of
the
European
economy
be
such
that
we
must
be
careful
about
the
rather
spectacular
growth
projection
that
be
emerge
.
the
IFAC
have
a
good
point
to
make
about
there
be
a
serious
danger
involve
in
that
regard
.
I
worry
a
lot
about
the
government
's
current
triumphalism
in
term
of
the
project
growth
it
state
will
alleviate
the
debt
burden
,
solve
the
deficit
problem
,
and
chart
we
on
the
way
back
to
economic
recovery
and
out
of
a
boom
and
slump
cycle
.
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
there
be
a
problem
with
both
the
way
the
government
and
the
fiscal
Advisory
Council
look
at
the
situation
in
that
they
have
not
identify
what
it
be
that
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
in
the
first
place
.
the
analysis
of
both
party
have
fail
to
address
that
fundamental
question
.
as
deputy
Paul
Murphy
indicate
,
there
be
a
significant
element
of
try
to
rewrite
what
happen
.
the
government
's
narrative
,
which
it
share
with
IFAC
,
be
that
the
problem
be
we
be
spend
way
beyond
we
means
and
therefore
it
be
all
about
rein
in
public
spending
to
avoid
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
be
not
what
cause
the
crisis
.
I
be
amazed
the
minister
do
not
understand
that
and
I
be
shocked
beyond
belief
that
IFAC
,
as
a
body
of
economic
expert
,
do
not
understand
it
.
of
course
one
need
a
balance
budget
and
a
link
between
expenditure
and
revenue
,
but
the
claim
that
such
be
the
problem
be
simply
not
true
.
we
debt
be
manageable
until
the
crash
come
.
we
expenditure
be
not
vastly
outstrip
revenue
but
what
be
a
problem
be
the
type
of
growth
we
have
.
at
various
time
the
minister
acknowledge
the
point
,
although
even
when
he
be
in
opposition
he
do
not
do
much
about
it
.
very
few
people
-
really
only
the
left
-
call
for
a
stop
to
what
be
happen
and
say
the
focus
and
disproportionate
emphasis
on
the
property
sector
be
dangerous
and
be
a
accident
wait
to
happen
that
could
result
in
a
economic
crash
.
that
be
the
problem
that
lead
to
the
crash
,
which
be
facilitate
by
banker
,
rather
than
we
spend
more
than
we
be
get
in
revenue
.
I
be
worried
about
precisely
the
same
thing
now
.
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
real
analysis
either
from
the
government
or
IFAC
about
the
type
of
growth
that
be
necessary
if
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
could
the
minister
clarify
whether
we
plan
for
economic
growth
be
base
on
sustainable
model
where
one
take
into
account
what
we
produce
,
for
whom
,
and
whether
it
be
about
meet
the
need
of
people
and
society
or
if
it
be
just
about
growth
number
and
balance
sheet
?
that
be
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
approach
of
both
the
minister
and
IFAC
.
we
need
a
different
model
that
start
with
what
society
need
,
what
people
need
and
plan
to
meet
that
need
rather
than
the
market
model
which
be
just
about
rampant
,
naked
competition
which
be
what
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
the
minister
say
he
want
to
get
away
from
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
might
have
write
a
different
pre-budget
statement
about
the
capacity
of
people
to
bear
even
more
austerity
because
of
the
crisis
memory
,
as
refer
to
by
deputy
Paul
Murphy
,
have
it
be
write
follow
the
demonstration
last
Saturday
week
.
it
get
that
very
wrong
.
what
the
demonstration
show
be
that
people
have
have
enough
and
they
be
not
willing
to
take
any
more
.
I
apologise
to
the
minister
for
not
be
present
for
he
speech
.
the
reason
I
be
late
be
because
I
be
attend
a
meeting
to
organise
the
next
big
demonstration
which
will
take
place
on
1
November
.
he
will
see
that
last
Saturday
week
be
not
a
one
-
off
event
but
be
part
of
a
grow
and
sustained
revolt
throughout
the
country
with
people
say
they
have
have
it
and
they
be
draw
a
line
with
water
charge
or
any
attempt
to
make
they
pay
any
more
for
the
crime
of
other
such
as
banker
and
bondholder
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
have
get
it
very
wrong
on
that
front
.
I
have
no
problem
with
the
concept
of
independent
monitoring
or
overview
of
government
economic
policy
in
term
of
ensure
policy
be
not
pursue
which
would
create
instability
or
crisis
.
I
would
equally
say
democratically
elect
government
and
,
more
important
,
the
people
who
elect
they
must
ultimately
have
the
freedom
to
make
they
own
decision
.
I
do
not
have
a
problem
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
say
he
do
not
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
and
the
government
will
do
thing
in
its
own
way
because
,
ultimately
,
such
decision
must
be
make
by
the
people
.
the
problem
I
have
be
that
this
so
-
call
independent
group
have
be
set
up
by
the
troika
and
its
main
task
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
a
banking
and
financial
crisis
that
be
not
create
by
they
but
be
create
by
the
financial
institution
,
the
big
political
institution
in
Europe
and
the
political
establishment
in
this
country
.
its
main
job
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
that
.
that
have
be
a
terrible
price
.
the
choice
we
be
offer
be
between
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
say
we
have
to
continue
down
this
road
and
take
a
further
€
2
billion
out
of
the
economy
,
thus
inflict
even
more
suffering
on
ordinary
people
,
or
the
government
's
claim
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
because
its
policy
be
such
a
fantastic
success
that
it
be
not
necessary
to
do
so
,
that
we
be
out
of
the
wood
now
due
to
its
policy
which
chart
the
way
forward
,
and
that
perhaps
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
do
not
fully
understand
just
how
fantastically
successful
the
government
's
policy
have
be
,
which
be
the
reason
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
a
further
cut
of
€
2
billion
.
both
of
that
option
be
false
,
but
there
be
aspect
of
truth
in
both
.
I
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
's
statement
that
the
downside
risk
in
term
of
the
European
economy
be
such
that
we
must
be
careful
about
the
rather
spectacular
growth
projection
that
be
emerge
.
the
IFAC
have
a
good
point
to
make
about
there
be
a
serious
danger
involve
in
that
regard
.
I
worry
a
lot
about
the
government
's
current
triumphalism
in
term
of
the
project
growth
it
state
will
alleviate
the
debt
burden
,
solve
the
deficit
problem
,
and
chart
we
on
the
way
back
to
economic
recovery
and
out
of
a
boom
and
slump
cycle
.
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
there
be
a
problem
with
both
the
way
the
government
and
the
fiscal
Advisory
Council
look
at
the
situation
in
that
they
have
not
identify
what
it
be
that
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
in
the
first
place
.
the
analysis
of
both
party
have
fail
to
address
that
fundamental
question
.
as
deputy
Paul
Murphy
indicate
,
there
be
a
significant
element
of
try
to
rewrite
what
happen
.
the
government
's
narrative
,
which
it
share
with
IFAC
,
be
that
the
problem
be
we
be
spend
way
beyond
we
means
and
therefore
it
be
all
about
rein
in
public
spending
to
avoid
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
be
not
what
cause
the
crisis
.
I
be
amazed
the
minister
do
not
understand
that
and
I
be
shocked
beyond
belief
that
IFAC
,
as
a
body
of
economic
expert
,
do
not
understand
it
.
of
course
one
need
a
balance
budget
and
a
link
between
expenditure
and
revenue
,
but
the
claim
that
such
be
the
problem
be
simply
not
true
.
we
debt
be
manageable
until
the
crash
come
.
we
expenditure
be
not
vastly
outstrip
revenue
but
what
be
a
problem
be
the
type
of
growth
we
have
.
at
various
time
the
minister
acknowledge
the
point
,
although
even
when
he
be
in
opposition
he
do
not
do
much
about
it
.
very
few
people
-
really
only
the
left
-
call
for
a
stop
to
what
be
happen
and
say
the
focus
and
disproportionate
emphasis
on
the
property
sector
be
dangerous
and
be
a
accident
wait
to
happen
that
could
result
in
a
economic
crash
.
that
be
the
problem
that
lead
to
the
crash
,
which
be
facilitate
by
banker
,
rather
than
we
spend
more
than
we
be
get
in
revenue
.
I
be
worried
about
precisely
the
same
thing
now
.
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
real
analysis
either
from
the
government
or
IFAC
about
the
type
of
growth
that
be
necessary
if
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
could
the
minister
clarify
whether
we
plan
for
economic
growth
be
base
on
sustainable
model
where
one
take
into
account
what
we
produce
,
for
whom
,
and
whether
it
be
about
meet
the
need
of
people
and
society
or
if
it
be
just
about
growth
number
and
balance
sheet
?
that
be
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
approach
of
both
the
minister
and
IFAC
.
we
need
a
different
model
that
start
with
what
society
need
,
what
people
need
and
plan
to
meet
that
need
rather
than
the
market
model
which
be
just
about
rampant
,
naked
competition
which
be
what
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle

minister

the
spread
of
the
Ebola
virus
in
west
Africa
continue
to
present
a
significant
challenge
to
the
international
community
.
we
have
a
obligation
to
strengthen
we
collective
response
in
order
that
the
necessary
skilled
personnel
and
medical
facility
be
fund
,
mobilise
and
deploy
to
west
Africa
to
deal
with
the
crisis
.
I
be
aware
of
the
comment
to
which
the
deputy
refer
and
I
agree
that
all
outstanding
funding
pledge
must
be
meet
,
quickly
and
in
full
.
there
be
a
moral
obligation
on
donor
to
do
so
.
it
be
only
by
tackle
the
Ebola
virus
in
west
Africa
that
we
can
ensure
its
spread
will
be
arrest
and
life
save
.
Ireland
have
be
play
its
part
,
however
,
through
the
work
locally
of
we
embassy
in
Sierra
Leone
and
significant
financial
support
for
the
Ebola
response
.
the
European
Union
and
its
member
state
have
commit
€
1.1
billion
to
the
Ebola
response
.
Ireland
will
provide
more
than
€
17
million
this
year
,
directly
and
through
non-governmental
organisation
,
to
the
country
in
west
Africa
most
affect
by
the
crisis
.
some
€
10
million
be
be
provide
through
we
annual
development
programme
in
we
partner
country
,
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
.
this
support
be
focus
particularly
on
strengthen
they
national
health
system
.
we
have
also
provide
more
than
€
4
million
in
recent
month
specifically
for
Ebola
treatment
facility
and
work
on
contact
tracing
,
community
mobilisation
and
child
nutrition
programme
,
among
other
activity
.
Ireland
have
a
strong
reputation
for
act
on
its
pledge
and
I
confirm
that
all
of
we
announce
funding
have
be
deliver
.
in
recent
day
,
the
Minister
and
I
announce
a
additional
grant
of
€
221000
for
the
supply
of
essential
food
and
non-food
item
to
family
in
Sierra
Leone
affect
by
local
quarantine
restriction
.
this
funding
will
be
disburse
without
delay
.
with
regard
to
the
EU
response
,
there
will
be
a
further
discussion
at
the
December
meeting
of
the
Council
of
foreign
Minister
,
at
which
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
will
be
present
,
on
that
very
issue
of
provide
a
update
on
funding
and
how
it
be
be
disburse
from
a
EU
perspective
.
the
EU
Ebola
co-ordinator
will
present
further
recommendation
at
that
time
.
I
wish
to
reassure
the
deputy
that
,
aside
from
the
investment
we
be
make
in
regard
to
assist
the
health
system
,
the
Irish
response
be
part
of
the
process
.
there
be
also
the
danger
of
the
secondary
humanitarian
crisis
that
follow
a
outbreak
of
this
nature
,
where
there
be
already
a
weak
health
system
.
I
visit
Sierra
Leone
between
1
and
4
October
and
I
be
delighted
to
say
we
have
a
very
strong
embassy
team
in
Freetown
,
head
by
ambassador
Sinead
Walsh
.
to
pick
up
on
the
point
about
the
Irish
response
,
which
be
where
we
need
to
focus
,
the
UN
now
have
a
mission
on
the
ground
which
be
co-ordinate
the
effort
in
the
three
most
affect
country
.
the
effectiveness
of
that
response
be
as
a
result
of
a
Irish
influence
on
the
ground
because
we
be
one
of
the
few
country
in
the
world
that
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
Sierra
Leone
-
in
other
word
,
we
have
a
embassy
there
.
I
would
acknowledge
the
role
of
Irish
worker
,
include
we
embassy
staff
,
work
on
the
ground
with
we
agency
,
such
as
GOAL
and
concern
.
there
be
Irish
worker
on
the
ground
who
be
have
a
major
impact
.
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Cubans
and
every
other
nation
state
for
the
worker
they
have
send
but
Irish
worker
be
not
only
influence
at
government
level
,
they
be
also
influence
at
Unite
Nation
level
and
they
be
a
integral
part
of
the
response
.
slowly
but
surely
that
impact
be
be
feel
in
that
we
be
get
ahead
of
it
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
Irish
taxpayer
's
money
be
disburse
be
stave
off
a
humanitarian
crisis
but
also
buttress
exist
health
system
on
the
ground
.
Nigeria
will
hold
presidential
and
National
Assembly
election
on
14
February
2015
.
this
will
be
follow
on
28
February
by
gubernatorial
and
state
assembly
election
.
we
be
follow
development
in
Nigeria
closely
through
we
embassy
in
Abuja
.
I
understand
that
political
association
in
Nigeria
be
constitutionally
prohibit
from
function
as
political
party
unless
they
be
register
with
the
independent
National
Electoral
Commission
,
INEC
.
there
be
strict
criterion
for
registration
lay
down
in
a
guideline
document
issue
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
in
March
last
year
.
I
be
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
electoral
commission
to
reject
a
application
from
the
socialist
Party
of
Nigeria
for
registration
as
a
political
party
.
this
matter
be
now
the
subject
of
proceedings
in
the
Nigerian
Federal
high
Court
in
Abuja
.
in
the
circumstance
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
I
to
comment
on
the
specific
case
.
however
,
as
a
general
point
of
principle
,
I
have
no
hesitation
in
call
for
the
forthcoming
election
in
Nigeria
to
be
as
inclusive
as
possible
.
it
be
important
that
they
be
conduct
peacefully
,
transparently
and
credibly
.
the
challenge
,
but
also
the
importance
of
this
,
be
underlin
by
the
deteriorate
security
situation
in
the
north
east
of
the
country
and
the
violence
be
perpetrate
by
the
terrorist
group
,
Boko
Haram
.
I
welcome
that
in
September
the
EU
commit
€
15
million
to
support
Nigeria
in
prepare
for
this
election
,
which
involve
in
excess
of
70
million
register
voter
and
150000
polling
station
.
I
also
welcome
the
decision
of
the
EU
to
deploy
a
electoral
monitoring
mission
to
monitor
the
election
.
we
have
nominate
a
number
of
Irish
observer
for
appointment
to
the
mission
.
I
understand
that
the
case
be
currently
before
the
court
and
be
list
for
a
second
hearing
tomorrow
,
27
November
.
from
a
Irish
perspective
Nigeria

it

I
feel
a
air
of
disbelief
that
we
be
actually
go
to
vote
on
this
private
Member
's
motion
because
who
could
vote
against
principle
of
human
rights
and
equality
?
who
could
vote
against
that
aspect
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
guide
vision
for
Ireland
that
would
see
policy
coherence
and
a
commitment
to
the
common
good
?
I
cannot
understand
the
objection
to
the
part
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
narrowing
of
the
gap
between
the
basic
social
welfare
rate
and
the
income
require
,
as
measure
by
the
Vincentian
Partnership
for
social
Justice
,
for
a
minimally
adequate
standard
of
living
and
for
that
gap
to
be
narrow
gradually
.
some
member
will
vote
against
a
private
Member
's
motion
which
acknowledge
the
positive
in
the
economic
recovery
.
they
will
also
be
voting
against
human
rights
which
,
as
I
outline
last
night
,
be
part
of
we
country
's
obligation
under
international
human
rights
treaty
.
it
be
disappointing
that
because
of
the
amendment
to
the
motion
and
the
vote
,
we
have
not
have
what
I
have
hope
would
be
a
more
philosophical
debate
on
the
principle
and
ideal
that
would
guide
we
over
the
next
few
year
.
one
of
the
way
to
get
it
right
be
if
human
rights
be
at
the
core
of
what
we
do
in
budget
and
in
policy
.
I
know
there
be
challenge
when
it
come
to

it

I
feel
a
air
of
disbelief
that
we
be
actually
go
to
vote
on
this
private
Member
's
motion
because
who
could
vote
against
principle
of
human

and
equality
?
who
could
vote
against
that
aspect
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
guide
vision
for
Ireland
that
would
see
policy
coherence
and
a
commitment
to
the
common
good
?
I
cannot
understand
the
objection
to
the
part
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
narrowing
of
the
gap
between
the
basic
social
welfare
rate
and
the
income
require
,
as
measure
by
the
Vincentian
Partnership
for
social
Justice
,
for
a
minimally
adequate
standard
of
living
and
for
that
gap
to
be
narrow
gradually
.
some
member
will
vote
against
a
private
Member
's
motion
which
acknowledge
the
positive
in
the
economic
recovery
.
they
will
also
be
voting
against
human
rights
which
,
as
I
outline
last
night
,
be
part
of
we
country
's
obligation
under
international
human
rights
treaty
.
it
be
disappointing
that
because
of
the
amendment
to
the
motion
and
the
vote
,
we
have
not
have
what
I
have
hope
would
be
a
more
philosophical
debate
on
the
principle
and
ideal
that
would
guide
we
over
the
next
few
year
.
one
of
the
way
to
get
it
right
be
if
human
rights
be
at
the
core
of
what
we
do
in
budget
and
in
policy
.
I
know
there
be
challenge
when
it
come
to
a
human

-
base
budget
analysis
,
such
as
access

and
the

feel
a
air
of
disbelief
that
we
be
actually
go
to
vote
on
this
private
Member
's
motion
because
who
could
vote
against
principle
of
human
rights
and
equality
?
who
could
vote
against
that
aspect
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
guide
vision
for
Ireland
that
would
see
policy
coherence
and
a
commitment
to
the
common
good
?
I
cannot
understand
the
objection
to
the
part
of
the
motion
that
call
for
a
narrowing
of
the
gap
between
the
basic
social
welfare
rate
and
the
income
require
,
as
measure
by
the
Vincentian
Partnership
for
social
Justice
,
for
a
minimally
adequate
standard
of
living
and
for
that
gap
to
be
narrow
gradually
.
some
member
will
vote
against
a
private
Member
's
motion
which
acknowledge
the
positive
in
the
economic
recovery
.
they
will
also
be
voting
against
human
rights
which
,
as
I
outline
last
night
,
be
part
of
we
country
's
obligation
under
international
human
rights
treaty
.
it
be
disappointing
that
because
of
the
amendment
to
the
motion
and
the
vote
,
we
have
not
have
what
I
have
hope
would
be
a
more
philosophical
debate
on
the
principle
and
ideal
that
would
guide
we
over
the
next
few
year
.
one
of
the
way
to
get
it
right
be
if
human
rights
be
at
the
core
of
what
we
do
in
budget
and
in
policy
.
I
know
there
be
challenge
when
it
come
to
a
human
rights
-
base
budget
analysis
,
such
as
access
datum
and
the
capacity
skill
for
that
who
would
do
the
work
,
but
they
be
not
insurmountable
.
Joseph
Stiglitz
be
often
quote
and
I
be
strike
by
one
short
quote
that
every
downturn
come
to
a
end
.
we
hope
it
be
come
to
a
end
but
what
some
people
suffer
during
that
downturn
must
be
acknowledge
,
from
the
force
100
%
repayment
to
reckless
bank
and
bondholder
,
who
gamble
and
lose
but
who
really
do
not
lose
at
all
,
to
the
cost
to
the
Irish
people
that
be
foist
on
they
,
without
they
agreement
.
we
know
the
cost
to
family
and
community
.
some
500000
people
emigrate
.
we
know
the
cost
in
term
of
the
growth
in
poverty
,
the
growth
in
unemployment
and
the
growth
in
homelessness
.
it
be
all
the
more
vital
that
we
get
it
right
if
we
be
in
recovery
and
that
we
do
not
get
complacent
and
say
that
happen
before
but
it
will
never
happen
again
.
it
can
happen
and
that
be
why
it
be
vital
we
put
human
rights
and
the
common
good
at
the
heart
of
what
we
do
.
when
tax
incentive
be
offer
in
a
budget
,
be
they
proof
from
a
human
rights
perspective
?
will
the
government
consider
a
sunset
clause
after
a
certain
number
of
a
year
-
a
review
that
the
objective
of
the
incentive
have
be
meet
and
that
this
would
include
a
human
rights
audit
?
can
the
government
put
its
hand
on
its
heart
and
say
that
the
tax
policy
here
be
compatible
with
the
obligation
to
use
the
maximum
available
resource
to
realise
economic
and
social
rights
?
on
the
international

,
we
be
a
respect

for

but
we
also
must
be

be

in

it
say

want
to
give
the
impression
that
the

have
enter
recovery

that
the

what
it
be
find

work

it

I
have

for

I
will
finish
with
a
quote

he
say
:
"

if

from
that
positive
.
we
all
respect
the
work
of
the
Society
of
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
and
I
be
strike
by
something
in
its
magazine
recently
.
it
say
that
government
,
media
etc.
want
to
give
the
impression
that
the
country
have
enter
recovery
and
that
the
era
of
austerity
be
over
but
what
it
be
find
in
its
day
-
to
-
day
work
with
people
in
severe
deprivation
,
lack
of
money
,
shortage
of
the
necessity
of
life
and
worry
about
maintain
a
roof
over
one
's
head
.
it
be
most
directly
involved
with
the
people
who
be
suffer
in
this
country
.
I
have
hope
for
more
philosophy
,
so
I
will
finish
with
a
quote
from
Nelson
Mandela
.
he
say
:
"
action
without
vision
be
only
pass
time
,
vision
without
action
be
merely
day
dream
,
but
vision
with
action
can
change
the
world
.
"
we
must
get
we
vision
right
,
then
we
will
get
we
action
right
.
we
can
create
a
good
country
because
every
action
must
be
accompany
by
a
vision
.
if
we
vision
be
equality
and
the
common
good
,
then
we
action
must
match
that
also
.
for
the
record
,
I
be
not
smirk
.
I
express
the
government
's
appreciation
of
the
support
express
by
some
Member
of
the
House
today
for
the
Stormont
House
agreement
and
the
government
's
role
in
negotiate
it
.
the
Stormont
House
agreement
be
a
necessity
.
the
month
before
the
political
talk
begin
be
characterise
by
political
deadlock
and
a
public
increasingly
disheartened
by
the
inability
of
the
political
system
to
deliver
reconciliation
and
economic
renewal
for
Northern
Ireland
.
the
talk
embody
the
collective
desire
at
Stormont
and
Westminster
and
in
Leinster
House
to
show
that
politics
can
deliver
by
address
a
range
of
contentious
issue
,
include
how
good
to
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
and
chart
a
way
forward
that
will
deliver
for
all
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
.
the
Stormont
House
agreement
have
create
the
condition
necessary
to
allow
a
fresh
start
in
2015
and
beyond
.
it
be
the
potential
for
a
new
beginning
which
Northern
Ireland
's
leader
need
to
embrace
fully
.
I
will
address
some
of
the
point
raise
by
previous
speaker
,
in
particular
,
about
the
outstanding
commitment
of
previous
agreement
.
as
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
have
underlin
,
the
government
remain
strongly
commit
to
ensure
outstanding
commitment
be
fulfil
.
it
must
be
repeat
that
,
notwithstand
that
commitment
,
the
agenda
for
the
most
recent
talk
be
essentially
focus
on
outstanding
commitment
arise
from
the
Good
Friday
and
St.
Andrew
's
agreement
,
the
foundational
agreement
of
the
peace
process
.
to
be
clear
,
the
Irish
government
be
not
a
party
to
the
negotiation
which
deal
specifically
with
budget
and
financial
reform
.
that
must
be
understand
for
the
historical
record
of
the
House
and
the
purpose
of
clarity
in
reply
to
some
of
the
point
raise
by
Member
opposite
.
while
the
case
of
the
late
Pat
Finucane
do
not
come
within
the
scope
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
the
position
of
the
Irish
government
on
this
important
point
have
not
change
.
a
commitment
to
have
a
public
inquiry
on
the
murder
of
Pat
Finucane
,
as
provide
for
in
the
Weston
Park
agreement
of
2001
,
should
be
honour
and
we
continue
to
raise
the
case
with
the
British
government
.
we
be
very
conscious
of
the
need
of
the
victim
and
survivor
in
the
South
,
include
the
family
of
the
victim
of
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
and
other
.
the
new
independent
commission
on
information
retrieval
will
operate
North
and
South
.
when
appropriate
,
we
will
,
in
a
timely
fashion
,
legislate
for
it
.
in
term
of
what
be
explicitly
on
the
agenda
,
the
government
's
mandate
go
into
the
talk
be
to
facilitate
agreement
between
party
who
hold
very
different
and
differ
view
and
this
mean
make
a
realistic
assessment
of
what
be
possible
within
a
very
tight
timeframe
and
lock
down
the
good
possible
outcome
.
we
achieve
this
.
the
president
of
Sinn
Féin
,
one
of
the
party
opposite
,
have
sign
up
to
it
,
despite
some
of
the
attempt
to
revise
he
party
's
position
on
the
talk
.
have
sign
up
to
it
,
we
stand
over
it
.
it
be
a
matter
of
regret
that
the
executive
party
and
the
British
government
be
unable
to
agree
on
the
inclusion
of
the
Irish
language
act
in
the
Stormont
House
agreement
.
nevertheless
,
we
succeed
in
ensure
the
agreement
contain
a
important
and
formal
recognition
by
both
government
of
the
need
for
respect
for
and
recognition
of
the
Irish
language
in
Northern
Ireland
.
the
government
will
continue
to
advocate
for
the
enactment
of
a
Irish
language
Act
and
to
encourage
the
Northern
Ireland
party
which
support
a
act
to
continue
to
build
the
necessary
enable
consensus
among
they
executive
colleague
.
one
of
the
party
opposite
,
Sinn
Féin
,
be
part
of
the
executive
.
I
beg
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
because
there
be
some
important
point
that
must
be
address
,
if
I
may
.
in
this
regard
,
I
be
encourage
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Northern
Ireland
Minister
for
Culture
,
Art
and
Leisure
,
Carál
Ní
Chuilín
,
of
she
intention
to
proceed
with
the
publication
of
Irish
and
Ulster
Scot
language
strategy
for
public
consultation
.
during
the
talk
,
we
advance
the
view
that
a
bill
of
rights
for
Northern
Ireland
could
set
out
precisely
and
formally
the
rights
upon
which
a
share
society
for
Northern
Ireland
could
be
base
.
regrettably
,
sufficient
consensus
between
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
party
do
not
exist
to
take
this
forward
within
the
context
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
.
however
,
we
succeed
in
ensure
the
agreement
contain
a
agreement
by
the
party
to
serve
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
equally
and
to
the
application
of
a
broad
range
of
associate
rights
.
regard
a
civic
forum
for
Northern
Ireland
,
during
the
talk
the
government
strongly
advance
we
position
that
great
civic
engagement
would
stimulate
inform
public
debate
on
key
societal
challenge
.
we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
Stormont
House
agreement
provide
for
the
establishment
of
a
civic
advisory
panel
to
meet
regularly
on
key
social
,
cultural
and
economic
issue
and
to
advise
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
.
as
minister
with
responsibility
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
I
be
particularly
pleased
that
the
agreement
provide
for
a
number
of
concrete
all
-
island
measure
.
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
,
meeting
in
institutional
format
,
will
agree
,
by
the
end
of
February
2015
,
a
report
on
new
sectoral
priority
for
North
-
South
co-operation
identify
during
ministerial
discussion
since
November
2013
.
as
many
member
have
observe
,
a
key
to
realise
the
full
potential
of
the
agreement
lie
in
effective
and
timely
implementation
.
it
be
the
government
's
intention
that
the
new
framework
be
operational
as
soon
as
be
reasonably
possible
.
we
will
continue
to
take
a
hand
-
on
approach
.
in
the
month
ahead
,
the
government
will
continue
to
sustain
the
commitment
show
throughout
the
talk
and
play
we
part
in
ensure
the
full
implementation
of
the
agreement
.
Dáil
Éireann
will
maintain
its
important
role
in
guarantee
peace
and
reconciliation
across
the
island
of
Ireland
,
not
least
through
the
consideration
of
the
legislation
that
the
agreement
require
for
the
new
institution
in
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
.
I
look
forward
to
the
co-operation
and
support
of
the
Member
of
the
House
as
we
progress
this
important
work
,
through
the
leadership
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
.
yes
.
while
one
talk
about
reform
,
I
refer
to
something
else
that
be
need
,
for
which
it
may
be
necessary
to
take
a
step
backwards
.
I
see
many
youngster
aged
15
or
16
who
,
at
one
time
in
the
past
,
when
they
go
through
the
vocational
system
and
learn
many
different
skill
,
go
on
a
different
route
.
although
not
everyone
will
become
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
,
we
have
concentrate
a
great
deal
on
this
and
have
go
in
a
different
direction
.
however
,
when
one
look
back
at
the
result
that
be
achieve
in
the
vocational

one
see
that
if

the

Ireland
be
play
a
strong
role
in
the
international
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
through
the
work
on
the
ground
of
its
embassy
in
Sierra
Leone
-
it
be
one
of
very
few
country
that
have
such
a
bilateral
relationship
with
that
country
in
particular
-
and
through
its
significant
financial
support
.
in
2014
alone
,
the
government
provide
more
than
€
18
million
directly
and
through
non-governmental
organisation
,
ngo
,
to
the
most
affect
country
in
that
region
.
this
include
approximately
€
10
million
through
its
annual
development
programme
in
its
partner
country
,
namely
,
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
,
which
have
a
particular
focus
on
strengthen
the
national
health
system
.
moreover
,
the
government
have
provide
more
than
€
5.6
million
specifically
for
Ebola
treatment
facility
and
for
work
on
contact
-
tracing
,
community
mobilisation
and
child
nutrition
programme
.
the
government
intend
to
continue
this
strong
focus
in
2015
.
while
there
appear
to
have
be
a
welcome
slow
-
down
in
the
incidence
of
case
of
Ebola
in
recent
week
,
there
be
fluctuation
from
country
to
country
.
it
be
therefore
essential
that
the
international
community
maintain
its
resolve
to
defeat
the
epidemic
and
not
lose
the
momentum
of
its
response
.
the
World
Health
Organization
,
who
,
report
that
fatality
rate
for
hospitalise
patient
in
the
most
affect
country
be
between
57
%
and
60
%
,
which
still
be
too
high
.
however
,
death
outside
treatment
centre
be
significantly
under
-
report
,
make
it
difficult
to
provide
a
completely
accurate
case
fatality
rate
for
the
outbreak
as
a
whole
.
now
that
Ebola
transmission
rate
be
drop
slightly
and
pressure
on
bed
be
reduce
,
more
suspect
Ebola
case
will
go
directly
to
treatment
centre
rather
than
transite
through
hold
centre
while
await
test
result
.
this
will
allow
more
patient
to
receive
the
high
quality
of
care
at
a
early
stage
and
that
will
lead
to
improve
outcome
.
through
the
chair
,
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
everything
deputy
Maureen
O'Sullivan
have
say
.
in
fairness
to
the
Irish
response
,
it
have
be
extremely
influential
in
influence
the
Unite
Nation
response
.
there
be
a
Unite
Nation
mission
on
the
ground
-
I
be
present
in
Freetown
on
the
very
weekend
it
arrive
-
and
because
of
the
presence
of
we
ambassador
and
team
on
the
ground
,
as
well
as
Irish
ngo
be
on
the
ground
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
,
we
be
able
to
influence
the
global
response
to
the
crisis
.
however
,
for
we
part
and
in
respect
of
we
response
as
a
nation
,
it
be
early
and
effective
.
while
I
agree
absolutely
with
deputy
O'Sullivan
when
she
state
there
be
more
fundamental
problem
,
the
government
have
a
embassy
and
accreditation
there
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
Sierra
Leone
be
third
from
last
on
the
human
development
index
.
this
signify
Ireland
's
commitment
to
that
country
on
the
very
issue
such
as
education
,
maternal
health
,
nutrition
,
gender
and
so
on
.
when
I
visit
,
I
speak
to
the
President
and
the
Minister
for
social
welfare
,
education
and
health
on
that
very
issue
because
the
government
believe
strongly
that
there
must
be
action
on
they
and
that
Ireland
have
a
role
to
play
in
assist
country
such
as
Sierra
Leone
in
that
respect
.
to
they
credit
,
the
Irish
ngo
be
work
directly
with
people
and
seek
to
empower
people
on
the
very
dynamic
about
which
the
deputy
have
speak
.
while
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
be
not
necessarily
make
this
point
,
Ireland
do
not
take
a
patronising
or
patriarchal
view
in
this
regard
.
we
help
people
to
empower
people
to
build
up
capacity
in
order
that
they
can
do
it
themselves
.
however
,
the
immediacy
of
the
Ebola
crisis
have
cause
the
government
to
shift
the
focus
towards
direct
funding
towards
that
crisis
per
se
by
direct
funding
to
thing
like
call
centre
,
community
mobilisation
and
psychosocial
issue
.
however
,
once
the
Ebola
crisis
be
over
,
the
work
to
which
the
deputy
refer
will
continue
apace
and
the
government
's
commitment
to
that
region
of
west
Africa
be
as
strong
as
it
ever
have
be
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
as
with
other
bank
on
the
island
,
Ulster
Bank
experience
insolvency
problem
.
its
parent
,
the
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
Group
,
be
under
the
regulatory
control
of
the
bank
of
England
rather
than
the
Irish
banking
system
.
the
bank
have
its
problem
and
at
one
point
some
year
ago
,
it
look
as
if
it
would
pull
out
of
Ireland
completely
.
such
a
scenario
would
have
be
a
great
loss
,
especially
in
the
northern
half
of
the
country
,
both
in
Northern

I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
important
issue
,
which
deserve
to
be
highlight
.
I
move
:
"
that
report
stage
be
take
now
.
"
I
be
stand
in
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
replace
the
current
three
-
member
gsoc
with
a
single
person
.
the
minister
appreciate
this
be
one
of
a
set
of
change
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
that
have
be
recommend
by
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
.
it
be
the
view
of
the
joint
committee
that
have
a
single
-
person
commission
would
provide
for
great
accountability
and
strengthen
its
overall
position
.
the
minister
have
consider
the
amendment
carefully
and
,
as
be
indicate
on
Committee
stage
,
there
be
,
of
course
,
more
involved
than
merely
a
change
to
the
number
of
commissioner
.
in
particular
the
minister
be
conscious
of
certain
advantage
from
have
a
three
-
person
body
and
she
believe
this
must
also
be
take
into
account
.
in
that
context
the
underlying
rationale
for
the
three
-
person
model
be
that
it
would
facilitate
bring
expertise
and
experience
across
a
range
of
different
sector
to
the
work
of
the
commission
.
in
addition
it
be
also
consider
to
be
a
practical
advantage
that
at
least
one
commissioner
would
always
be
available
to
guide
and
direct
operation
.
at
operational
level
,
GSOC
consider
this
to
be
a
significant
advantage
in
a
working
environment
as
that
face
by
the
commission
.
indeed
,
some
of
its
most
serious
and
sensitive
case
have
occur
at
weekend
and
during
holiday
period
.
moreover
,
a
three
-
person
commission
with
its
legally
require
gender
balance
and
its
range
of
experience
and
expertise
convey
a
strong
public
assurance
that
fairness
and
sensitivity
be
at
the
core
of
GSOC
's
approach
at
the
high
level
.
it
also
help
that
potential
difference
between
a
individual
commissioner
and
key
interlocutor
do
not
impinge
on
the
smooth
and
effective
running
of
the
organisation
.
the
minister
also
accept
that
up
to
recently
the
interaction
between
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
the
Garda
Síochána
have
not
be
function
,
if
one
like
,
as
effectively
as
it
should
.
however
,
this
be
a
area
in
which
substantial
work
be
be
undertake
by
both
organisation
.
furthermore
-
this
be
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
we
be
debate
today
-
additional
power
be
in
the
process
of
be
confer
on
GSOC
.
in
the
circumstance
the
minister
would
be
reluctant
to
alter
the
current
gsoc
structure
unless
it
could
be
show
that
a
significant
advantage
would
accrue
from
do
so
.
have
consider
the
overall
position
,
include
that
specific
arrangement
have
be
make
for
the
commission
,
through
a
nominate
member
to
account
to
Oireachtas
committee
,
the
minister
do
not
favour
move
to
a
one
-
person
commission
.
however
,
conscious
of
the
position
of
the
joint
committee
on
the
matter
,
the
minister
believe
this
be
a
aspect
that
need
to
be
keep
under
review
.
the
deputy
will
appreciate
the
consideration
that
have
be
give
to
he
amendment
.
in
the
circumstance
the
minister
hope
that
he
can
withdraw
the
amendment
.
with
regard
to
the
specific
question
from
deputy
Niall
Collins
,
we
acknowledge
that
the
vacancy
have
arise
for
the
chairperson
of
GSOC
on
foot
of
Mr.
O'Brien
's
resignation
.
the
appointment
of
member
of
the
Ombudsman
Commission
be
govern
by
section
65
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
.
this
stipulate
that
the
commission
consist
of
three
member
,
all
of
whom
be
to
be
appoint
by
the
President
on
the
nomination
of
the
government
follow
the
passage
of
resolution
by
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
recommend
the
appointment
.
the
2005
Act
require
that
the
government
be
satisfied
that
the
person
nominate
have
the
appropriate
experience
,
qualification
,
training
and
expertise
for
appointment
,
have
regard
to
the
function
of
the
commission
.
the
minister
have
indicate
that
the
government
,
in
accordance
with
the
2005
Act
,
will
consider
the
question
of
a
nomination
of
chairperson
of
GSOC
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
.
Mr.
O'Brien
state
that
he
resignation
be
essentially
for
family
reason
.
with
regard
to
the
timing
and
advertisement
,
it
be
a
matter
for
a
government
decision
so
we
will
revert
to
deputy
Niall
Collins
on
that
point
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
the
Member
opposite
concern
one
or
three
commissioner
.
the
government
have
set
out
its
position
on
deputy
Pádraig
Mac
Lochlainn
's
amendment
and
be
not
prepare
to
change
its
position
in
light
of
the
further
submission
make
by
the
deputy
.
the
minister
state
that
it
be
something
she
will
keep
under
review
in
deal
with
the
amendment
before
we
.
I
thank
all
that
who
contribute
to
the
debate
.
in
particular
,
I
thank
my
colleague
in
the
technical
Group
.
we
be
often
describe
as
a
disparate
group
,
but
this
be
one
motion
we
all
find
easy
to
support
.
the
response
of
the
government
in
tab
the
amendment
be
disappointing
.
the
most
breathtaking
statement
in
the
amendment
be
the
line
to
the
effect
that
the
debt
be
sustainable
and
that
it
be
possible
to
repay
it
.
it
be
one
thing
to
service
a
debt
on
which
there
be
a
productive
return
but
most
of
what
we
be
repay
be
not
typical
national
debt
.
part
of
it
relate
to
the
banking
collapse
,
while
a
major
share
of
it
relate
to
the
crash
in
tax
revenue
from
the
construction
sector
,
which
have
follow
-
on
consequence
in
other
sector
.
it
would
be
entirely
different
if
we
be
pay
back
a
debt
incur
in
build
new
water
infrastructure
,
a
public
transport
system
to
reduce
we
dependence
on
fossil
fuel
,
the
cost
of
which
be
€
8
billion
per
year
,
or
undertake
a
major
house
building
programme
to
deliver
security
of
tenure
and
affordable
accommodation
.
however
,
there
be
no
productive
aspect
to
most
of
we
debt
.
reference
be
make
to
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
although
we
have
not
include
it
in
the
motion
.
the
fund
be
plunder
,
but
the
pension
time
-
bomb
be
still
with
we
.
with
a
ageing
and
a
deplet
population
because
of
emigration
,
the
problem
be
go
to
get
bad
.
in
a
article
yesterday
Fintan
O'Toole
refer
to
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Michael
Noonan
's
explanation
of
why
Ireland
be
not
support
Greek
call
for
the
hold
of
a
European
debt
resolution
conference
.
the
minister
say
of
Ireland
's
€
214
billion
debt
:
"
we
debt
be
in
a
very
good
position
now
;
it
be
affordable
and
it
repayable
.
"
O'Toole
go
on
to
state
:
there
could
hardly
be
a
clear
message
to
we
gallant
ally
in
Europe
.
keep
you
hand
in
you
pocket
.
you
would
only
be
insult
we
if
you
offer
we
a
dig
-
out
.
many
of
we
can
identify
with
this
.
I
seriously
question
the
notion
that
we
debt
be
on
a
downward
trajectory
.
the
world
debt
clock
show
that
we
be
pay
in
the
region
of
€339
per
second
in
interest
.
therefore
,
in
the
five
minute
I
have
to
speak
tonight
we
will
have
add
€
100000
in
interest
to
we
debt
.
we
be
make
repayment
€
7.5
billion
to
service
the
national
debt
,
which
be
close
to
the
entire
education
budget
.
the
Taoiseach
say
the
water
charge
protest
be
about
more
than

they
be
;
they
be
about
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
big
squeeze
on

for
a
major
proportion
of
citizen
.
many
believe
they
be
bad
off

the

person
have
put
it
to
we
that

that
they
have
no
reserve
leave
and
that
,
whereas
they
may
have
have
a
little
money
at
the
beginning
,
there
have
no
reserve
now
.
some
tell
we
that
they
income
and
outgoing
be
so
finely
tune
that
something
like
Christmas
,
the
car
break
down
or
the
washing
machine
need
repair
can
throw
they
into
crisis
.
that
show
how
marginal
the
balance
be
.
the
minister
say
the
debt
be
sustainable
and
repayable
in
the
name
of
the
people
struggle
so
badly
,
not
only
in
the
name
of
the
government
.
the
dynamic
have
shif
in
Europe
.
what
it
be
not
possible
to
talk
or
think
about
six
month
ago
be
altogether
possible
now
.
it
be
not
only
in
Greece
where
this
debate
should
be
hold
.
let
we
consider
the
debt
problem
throughout
Europe
.
Italy
have
a
133
%
debt
-
to
-
gdp
ratio
;
France
,
93
%
;
and
Spain
,
96
%
.
even
Germany
have
a
75
%
ratio
.
Joschka
Fischer
,
a
former
Vice
Chancellor
of
Germany
,
write
in
the
Guardian
over
the
weekend
state
:
nothing
but
growth
will
decide
the
future
of
the

.
even
Germany
,
the
EU
's
big

,
face
a
enormous
need
for
infrastructure
investment
.
he
go
on
to
write
:
"
the
eurozone
's
cohesion
and
the
success
of
its
necessary
structural
reform
,
and
thus
its
very
survival
,
now
depend
on
whether
it
can
overcome
its
growth
deficit
.
"
he
also
state
:
warning
of
a
severe
political

go
unheeded

,
Chancellor
Angela

's

stubbornly
insist
that
the
pain
of
austerity
be
essential
to
economic
recovery
;
the
EU
have
little
choice
but
to
go
along
.
now
,
with
Greece
's
voter
have
drive
out
they
country
's
exhausted
and
corrupt
elite
in
favour
of
a
party
that
have
vow
to
end
austerity
,
the
backlash
have
arrive
.
we
have
good
start
to
pay
attention
to
it
.
the
debate
may
well
be
over
for
tonight
in
this
chamber
,
but
it
be
only
begin
throughout
Europe
.
a
seven
year

I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
sub-committee
on
Transport
,
Tourism
and
sport
pursuant
to
standing
order
82a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
(
6
)
(
a
)
and
118
of
the
standing
order
relative
to
Public
business
.
I
have
to
get
back
down
to
Cork
.
I
thank
deputy
Wallace
for
introduce
this
Bill
.
I
have
the
honour
of
set
out
the
government
's
position
on
it
.
this
be
the
second
time
in
three
week
that
the
House
have
debate
a
proposal
to
amend
the
constitution
by
insert
provision
concern
military
neutrality
.
I
will
focus
on
the
broad
issue
of
military
neutrality
before
turn
to
the
specific
proposal
in
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
.
as
have
be
state
in
the
House
many
time
,
include
three
week
ago
,
the
government
be
commit
to
the
long
-
standing
policy
of
military
neutrality
,
which
enjoy
widespread
public
support
.
the
government
's
commitment
be
publicly
re-confirm
in
the
major
statement
of
foreign
policy
priority
that
it
publish
in
January
,
entitle
"
the
Global
Island
:
Ireland
's
foreign
Policy
for
a
Changing
World
"
.
the
statement
set
out
a
comprehensive
series
of
policy
priority
concern
Ireland
's
future
in
a
rapidly
change
world
,
include
secure
we
nation
's
prosperity
,
active
engagement
in
the
EU
,
promote
peace
and
reconciliation
on
this
island
,
engage
with
we
diaspora
,
provide
travel
document
and
assistance
for
we
citizen
when
travel
abroad
and
promote
we
value
.
it
be
on
this
last
point
that
I
wish
to
focus
.
as
the
statement
make
clear
,
"
article
29
of
the
Constitution
set
out
the
principle
that
guide
Ireland
's
conduct
of
its
international
relation
"
.
this
principle
include
"
the
ideal
of
peace
and
friendly
co-operation
amongst
nation
"
and
"
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
"
.
it
further
confirm
that
we
foreign
policy
be
deeply
anchore
in
the
value
set
out
in
the
constitution
.
the
statement
reconfirm
that
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
remain
a
core
element
of
Irish
foreign
policy
.
in
line
with
this
policy
,
we
be
not
member
of
any
military
alliance
and
have
no
plan
to
join
any
.
however
,
military
neutrality
do
not
mean
that
we
take
a
insular
view
or
isolate
ourselves
from
the
world
.
we
be
conscious
of
we
duty
and
responsibility
to
do
what
we
can
to
prevent
and
alleviate
the
suffering
of
other
.
in
line
with
the
constitution
,
we
take
seriously
we
obligation
to
work
towards
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
.
moreover
,
we
export
-
orient
economy
rely
on
a
stable
rule
-
base
international
system
for
the
trade
,
investment
and
tourism
flow
on
which
the
prosperity
of
we
people
depend
.
the
government
,
therefore
,
believe
in
active
global
engagement
and
in
contribute
to
international
effort
to
secure
similar
peace
and
prosperity
in
other
part
of
this
interconnected
world
.
we
do
this
through
policy
aim
at
combate
poverty
and
hunger
,
principally
through
the
government
's
Irish
Aid
programme
;
advance
human
rights
;
promote
disarmament
;
and
work
through
the
UN
,
the
EU
and
with
we
international
partner
to
promote
international
peace
and
stability
.
the
contribution
make
by
Irish
troops
to
peacekeeping
mission
be
at
the
heart
of
we
strategy
.
thousand
of
man
and
woman
have
make
a
invaluable
contribution
to
keep
the
peace
in
country
ravage
by
year
of
conflict
.
we
troops
have
a
distinguished
track
record
and
a
well
-
deserve
international
reputation
earn
over
many
decade
.
to
meet
the
grow
demand
for
peace
operation
,
the
UN
have
increasingly
turn
to
regional
organisation
such
as
the
EU
,
the
African
Union
and
NATO
to
manage
operation
on
its
behalf
and
under
its
authority
.
Ireland
have
actively
contribute
to
the
shaping
of
the
EU'
common
Security
and
Defence
Policy
,
CSDP
,
which
equip
the
Union
to
take
on
crisis
management
operation
outside
the
EU
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
the
UN
Charter
.
the
operation
of
the
CSDP
be
entirely
consistent
with
Irish
foreign
policy
tradition
and
principle
.
it
be
guide
by
a
comprehensive
approach
which
seek
to
tackle
the
underlying
cause
as
well
as
the
manifestation
of
conflict
.
the
EU
now
have
a
wide
range
of
competence
equip
it
to
make
a
significant
contribution
to
peace
support
operation
by
draw
on
a
mix
of
economic
development
,
trade
,
mediation
,
rule
of
law
and
peace
support
instrument
.
the
EU
have
deploy
more
than
30
military
and
civilian
operation
since
2002
.
member
of
the
Defence
Force
have
participate
in
some
of
this
mission
.
however
,
the
majority
of
mission
be
civilian
in
nature
and
involve
the
deployment
of
police
officer
and
civilian
expert
.
this
EU
mission
be
externally
focus
and
design
to
contribute
to
international
peace
and
security
.
they
be
not
related
to
internal
EU
security
or
territorial
defence
.
they
rely
on
contribution
make
by
the
sovereign
decision
of
individual
member
state
.
in
Ireland
's
case
,
Defence
force
deployment
be
,
and
will
continue
to
be
,
govern
by
the
triple
lock
mechanism
which
be
set
out
in
legislation
.
lest
there
be
any
lingering
concern
arise
from
recent
comment
in
the
course
of
a
interview
by
the
President
of
the
European
Commission
,
Mr.
Jean
Claude
Juncker
,
I
want
to
make
clear
that
there
be
no
European
army
,
nor
be
there
any
basis
for
one
.
the
protocol
on
the
concern
of
the
Irish
people
to
the
Treaty
of
Lisbon
,
which
be
annex
to
the
Treaty
on
the
European
Union
,
make
clear
that
the
treaty
do
not
affect
or
prejudice
we
military
neutrality
.
the
protocol
also
state
that
the
treaty
do
not
provide
for
the
creation
of
a
European
army
.
the
treaty
itself
state
that
there
will
be
no
common
defence
unless
the
European
Council
unanimously
so
decide
and
article
29.4.9
prohibit
Irish
participation
in
such
a
common
defence
.
before
turn
to
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Wallace
,
I
want
to
refer
briefly
to
the
issue
of
the
use
of
Shannon
Airport
by
the
US
.
this
be
a
long
-
standing
practice
which
have
be
in
place
for
over
50
year
.
we
have
never
withdraw
or
suspend
the
use
of
facility
at
Shannon
at
any
stage
during
that
period
.
Ireland
have
not
enter
into
a
military
alliance
with
the
US
or
with
any
other
country
or
organisation
.
permit
the
use
of
Shannon
by
the
US
do
not
challenge
this
position
in
any
way
and
successive
government
have
consider
that
this
be
compatible
with
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
.
let
I
turn
to
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Wallace
.
the
Bill
propose
that
the
constitution
should
be
amend
to
require
adherence
to
the
provision
of
the
1907
Hague
Convention
(
V
)
,
respect
the
rights
and
duty
of
neutral
power
and
person
in
case
of
war
on
land
.
I
will
quote
the
exact
schedule
propose
to
be
insert
into
the
constitution
:
Ireland
's
neutral
status
shall
be
affirm
by
adherence
to
the
provision
of
the
1907
Hague
Convention
(
V
)
respect
the
Right
and
Duties
of
Neutral
Powers
and
Person
in
Case
of
War
on
Land
.
as
deputy
Wallace
will
be
aware
,
this
be
one
of
13
convention
adopt
on
18
October
1907
at
the
conclusion
of
the
second
Hague
Peace
Conference
.
the
convention
be
a
product
of
a
historical
context
which
concern
the
sovereign
right
of
state
to
wage
war
.
this
right
have
for
century
be
regard
as
a
legitimate
instrument
of
a
state
's
national
policy
.
the
law
of
neutrality
represent
a
logical
accompaniment
to
the
sovereign
right
of
state
to
wage
war
.
in
other
word
,
state
which
do
not
wish
to
be
consider
as
participant
in
a
war
have
the
legal
right
to
insist
on
respect
for
they
rights
as
neutral
party
and
as
neutral
party
have
to
comply
with
certain
legal
obligation
under
the
convention
.
however
,
just
two
decade
late
,
the
right
to
wage
war
be
relinquish
by
practically
all
state
under
the
1928
General
Treaty
for
the
Renunciation
of
War.
William
T.
Cosgrave
,
act
on
behalf
of
the
then
Irish
Free
State
,
be
among
the
original
signatory
to
the
treaty
which
declare
that
the
contracting
party
condemn
recourse
to
war
and
renounce
it
as
a
instrument
of
national
policy
in
they
relation
with
one
another
.
the
treaty
further
state
that
the
settlement
or
solution
of
all
dispute
or
conflict
of
whatever
nature
or
of
whatever
origin
they
may
be
shall
never
be
seek
except
by
pacific
means
.
the
prohibition
on
war
be
reinforce
with
the
adoption
in
1945
of
the
Charter
of
the
Unite
Nation
.
article
2
(
3
)
of
the
charter
require
all
member
to
settle
they
dispute
by
peaceful
means
.
under
article
2
(
4
)
,
UN
member
"
shall
refrain
in
they
international
relation
from
the
threat
or
use
of
force
against
the
territorial
integrity
or
political
independence
of
any
state
,
or
in
any
other
manner
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
Unite
Nation
.
"
whereas
the
1907
convention
be
design
to
allow
neutral
state
to
stay
out
of
a
war
,
it
have
largely
be
supersede
by
the
Charter
of
the
Unite
Nation
which
set
out
a
framework
of
internationally
accept
principle
concern
collective
security
.
the
old
distinction
between
belligerent
and
neutral
be
no
long
relevant
as
war
be
prohibit
by
international
law
.
under
the
UN
Charter
the
use
of
force
be
permit
only
in
individual
or
collective
self
defence
or
where
authorise
by
the
Security
Council
in
order
to
maintain
or
restore
international
peace
and
security
.
where
the
Security
Council
authorise
measure
,
include
military
action
,
to
restore
international
peace
and
security
,
member
state
not
participate
in
that
measure
be
nevertheless
oblige
under
article
2
(
5
)
to
"
give
the
United
Nation
every
assistance
in
any
action
it
take
"
in
accordance
with
the
Charter
.
UN
member
state
may
also
be
require
to
implement
sanction
impose
by
the
Security
Council
against
a
state
.
thus
it
may
no
long
be
possible
for
a
UN
member
state
to
remain
neutral
in
the
manner
prescribe
by
the
1907
convention
.
furthermore
,
the
1907
convention
apply
to
the
wage
of
war
,
which
be
a
armed
conflict
between
state
,
but
it
do
not
apply
to
conflict
within
a
state
or
to
conflict
between
state
and
non-state
actor
which
represent
the
vast
majority
of
modern
armed
conflict
.
it
refer
to
the
passage
of
troops
over
land
or
by
sea
,
but
because
it
be
a
product
of
its
time
it
make
no
reference
to
modern
mode
of
transport
,
include
air
travel
,
or
to
new
development
in
technology
.
the
1907
Hague
Convention
should
be
regard
as
a
product
of
its
time
.
just
33
country
be
state
party
to
the
convention
,
with
just
two
of
this
ratify
the
convention
after
the
1928
general
treaty
come
into
force
,
which
be
Ethiopia
in
1935
and
Belarus
in
1962
.
Ireland
fully
subscribe
to
the
provision
of
the
1928
general
treaty
and
the
UN
Charter
.
the
government
see
little
point
in
ratify
a
convention
which
have
its
root
in
a
right
to
wage
war
which
,
as
I
have
outline
,
be
now
prohibit
by
international
law
.
with
the
adoption
of
the
UN
Charter
,
it
be
far
from
clear
how
it
apply
in
the
modern
world
.
the
case
for
ratify
the
convention
be
weak
,
but
the
case
for
include
a
reference
to
it
in
the
constitution
,
to
bind
the
State
by
its
provision
,
be
weak
still
.
three
week
ago
,
the
government
reject
the
case
for
insert
provision
on
neutrality
into
the
constitution
.
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
deputy
Jimmy
Deenihan
,
note
that
the
objective
of
the
private
Member
's
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Seán
Crowe
be
well
intentioned
but
that
to
insert
that
provision
into
the
constitution
be
neither
necessary
nor
desirable
.
that
argument
apply
equally
to
this
Bill
.
as
I
say
in
my
open
remark
,
there
have
be
a
long
-
standing
commitment
by
successive
government
to
the
policy
of
military
neutrality
.
this
government
remain
fully
committed
to
this
policy
and
have
re­affirm
the
commitment
in
the
global
island
policy
.
article
29
(
2
)
of
the
constitution
confirm
Ireland
's
adherence
to
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
and
it
prohibit
participation
in
any
EU
common
defence
.
Ireland
's
policy
on
military
neutrality
be
acknowledge
and
protect
in
the
legal
guarantee
obtain
in
the
context
of
ratification
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
.
in
addition
to
all
this
important
provision
,
the
condition
which
must
be
satisfied
to
permit
Irish
participation
in
overseas
military
operation
be
set
out
in
legislation
under
the
triple
lock
mechanism
.
in
view
of
this
provision
,
the
government
do
not
consider
that
a
constitutional
provision
on
neutrality
be
require
.
I
would
be
concerned
about
the
potential
implication
of
a
constitutional
provision
that
require
the
State
to
act
in
keep
with
a
convention
which
have
in
large
measure
be
overtake
by
development
in
international
law
and
which
may
even
be
inconsistent
with
the
UN
Charter
.
I
do
not
think
that
this
House
would
wish
Ireland
to
find
itself
in
a
position
where
it
must
refuse
to
take
part
in
a
UN
-
mandate
peace
operation
or
must
refuse
to
implement
sanction
approve
by
the
Security
Council
because
the
constitution
have
be
amend
in
such
a
way
that
we
have
to
act
in
the
manner
in
which
a
neutral
state
would
have
do
at
a
time
of
war
in
1907
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
House
would
support
a
provision
which
potentially
might
tie
the
government
's
hand
and
prevent
it
from
take
a
public
position
on
incident
of
gross
violation
of
human
rights
or
the
commission
of
war
crime
that
may
occur
during
a
conflict
because
it
be
require
under
the
constitution
to
adhere
to
a
strictly
neutral
position
as
set
out
in
the
Hague
Convention
.
the
world
have
move
on
since
1907
.
we
no
long
live
in
a
era
of
belligerent
adhere
to
a
outmoded
law
on
the
right
to
wage
war
.
we
live
in
the
modern
world
,
a
world
in
which
we
and
most
other
state
regard
the
Unite
Nation
as
the
forum
within
which
dispute
should
be
settle
,
and
the
UN
Charter
as
the
set
of
principle
to
which
all
state
should
adhere
.
we
must
look
to
the
future
and
it
be
on
that
basis
that
the
government
be
not
accept
the
Bill
.
I
be
refer
to
the
1907
convention
,
so
the
deputy
should
not
forget
the
historical
narrative
.
many
point
have
be
raise
that
to
be
frank
and
respectful
be
extraneous
to
the
Bill
at
hand
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
with
due
respect
to
deputy
Wallace
,
I
propose
to
respond
to
the
Bill
itself
.
I
will
leave
it
to
the
historian
to
testify
to
the
verbosity
and
veracity
of
some
of
the
point
that
have
be
make
by
Member
opposite
.
it
have
be
a
interesting
debate
with
some
very
lively
contribution
.
I
sincerely
thank
deputy
Wallace
for
introduce
the
Bill
.
three
week
ago
,
the
government
make
clear
in
relation
to
a
separate
private
member
'
Bill
that
it
do
not
consider
it
necessary
or
desirable
to
incorporate
provision
on
neutrality
into
the
constitution
.
this
House
debate
and
subsequently
vote
against
the
Bill
.
my
view
and
that
of
the
government
be
that
be
the
correct
decision
.
the
conclusion
that
the
propose
legislation
in
this
area
be
unnecessary
and
undesirable
apply
even
more
strongly
to
the
Bill
before
we
today
.
this
be
a
Bill
which
serve
no
useful
purpose
in
the
modern
era
.
some
of
the
sentence
that
be
parse
from
the
speech
I
make
early
have
be
use
out
of
context
.
I
would
welcome
a
future
opportunity
to
elaborate
on
that
but
my
time
today
be
restrict
.
the
1907
convention
must
be
consider
in
the
grand
historical
context
and
that
be
what
be
pertinent
to
the
Bill
and
the
wording
that
be
propose
in
term
of
the
change
to
the
constitution
.
the
Bill
be
not
necessary
because
the
government
remain
commit
to
the
policy
of
military
neutrality
follow
by
successive
government
over
decade
.
the
commitment
have
be
reconfirm
in
the
Global
Island
review
which
state
:
"
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
remain
a
core
element
of
Irish
foreign
policy
.
"
it
may
only
be
refer
to
twice
but
it
be
there
and
it
be
inherent
within
government
policy
.
the
Bill
be
also
unnecessary
give
that
the
constitution
already
commit
Ireland
to
"
the
ideal
of
peace
and
friendly
cooperation
amongst
nation
"
and
to
"
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
.
"
the
strict
condition
under
which
we
Defence
Force
personnel
may
be
deploy
overseas
be
set
out
in
legislation
.
we
neutrality
be
also
fully
respect
by
the
EU
treaty
and
confirm
by
the
protocol
on
the
concern
of
the
Irish
people
to
the
Treaty
of
Lisbon
.
some
of
the
Member
opposite
must
reflect
on
they
position
in
regard
to
that
same
treaty
when
it
be
put
before
the
people
.
the
government
be
of
the
view
that
as
well
as
be
unnecessary
,
incorporation
of
the
propose
amendment
into
the
constitution
would
not
be
desirable
.
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
would
have
we
insert
into
the
constitution
a
bind
reference
to
a
convention
conclude
more
than
a
century
ago
.
this
be
a
convention
ratify
by
just
33
country
,
13
of
they
member
of
NATO
.
no
country
have
ratify
the
convention
for
more
than
50
year
.
I
say
that
for
the
benefit
of
deputy
Clare
Daly
.
I
repeat
that
this
be
a
convention
ratify
by
33
country
,
13
of
they
member
of
NATO
.
the
deputy
may
say
that
we
be
parrote
-
to
use
she
phrase
-
word
that
be
use
three
week
ago
,
but
I
respectfully
submit
to
this
House
that
the
message
be
still
the
same
and
it
be
no
less
potent
by
its
repetition
.
I
wish
to
inform
deputy
Clare
Daly
,
through
the
chair
,
that
no
country
have
ratify
the
convention
for
more
than
50
year
and
only
three
have
ratify
it
since
the
conclusion
of
the
first
World
War
.
I
speak
specifically
and
respectfully
to
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
in
response
.
one
could
ask
why
that
be
so
.
it
be
because
the
convention
be
no
long
relevant
to
the
contemporary
world
.
it
have
be
make
redundant
by
subsequent
legal
agreement
,
namely
,
by
the
General
Treaty
of
1928
and
by
the
UN
Charter
of
1945
.
regardless
of
all
of
the
issue
that
be
honestly
submit
by
member
opposite
in
regard
to
issue
of
neutrality
-
I
refer
to
issue
relate
to
Palestine
,
Cuba
and
whether
cabinet
member
be
for
or
against
NATO
-
and
again
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
before
the
House
,
we
respond
accordingly
and
efficiently
to
what
have
be
raise
in
the
provision
in
the
propose
Bills
.
the
government
believe
in
a
modern
constitution
for
a
modern
Ireland
that
take
a
active
role
in
a
modern
world
.
we
see
no
point
in
accord
constitutional
status
to
a
convention
which
be
no
long
relevant
;
which
in
large
measure
have
be
overtake
by
development
in
international
law
;
which
refer
to
telegraph
and
telephone
cable
and
to
the
erection
of
wireless
telegraphy
station
;
and
which
have
not
attract
a
single
new
adherent
in
more
than
half
a
century
.
I
realise
that
my
time
be
up
.
while
the
government
do
not
support
the
Bill
,
that
be
not
to
say
that
we
do
not
respect
the
spirit
in
which
the
Bill
have
be
introduce
.
we
believe
the
aim
of
it
,
which
be
to
seek
to
instil
within
the
Constitution
the
1907
Hague
Convention
,
be
not
the
pertinent
way
to
deal
with
the
entirety
of
the
issue
of
neutrality
.
deputy
Wallace
should
deal
with
he
Bill
.
I
be
sorry
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
be
not
rubbish
it
.

small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
will
continue
to
be
critical
to
we
economic
recovery
and
the
government
will
continue
to
support
they
,
whether
through
start
up
or
scaling
phase
.
sme
will
continue
to
provide
vital
job
and
goods
and
service
in
we
community
and
region
,
and
consequently
it
be
in
all
of
we
interest
that
sme
be
bear
,
survive
and
thrive
.
I
take
the
point
make
on
the
failure
of
sme
and
the
point
make
by
deputy
Kelleher
on
venture
capital
and
take
equity
stake
.
the
metric
will
show
clearly
the
government
have
a
very
strong
record
,
as
do
the
venture
capital
community
,
in
take
punt
on
many
sme
,
particularly
at
present
.
person
talk
about
a
paradigm
shift
but
a
new
dialogue
have
open
up
about
the
notion
of
fear
of
failure
.
we
all
subscribe
to
the
idea
one
can
fail
quickly
and
move
on
and
start
something
new
.
this
apply
mainly
in
the
tech
sector
.
in
other
sector
of
the
economy
one
must
be
a
little
more
reticent
and
careful
about
the
rhetoric
we
use
,
because
sometimes
the
failure
of
a
entity
involve
many
creditor
and
we
must
have
mechanism
in
place
so
people
can
find
relief
with
regard
to
debt
incur
by
a
company
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
system
which
be
too
loose
so
people
could
turn
over
entity
too
easily
whereby
many
people
be
leave
hang
for
want
of
the
expedition
of
the
debt
which
would
arise
from
such
activity
.
I
take
the
point
,
which
be
valid
,
but
we
need
to
be
careful
about
how
we
evolve
such
a
culture
in
this
country
.
we
have
to
state
for
the
record
that
as
strong
as
the
foreign
direct
investment
base
be
in
this
country
,
more
job
be
support
by
Enterprise
Ireland
and
local
enterprise
office
than
in
IDA
company
.
by
the
end
of
2014
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
local
enterprise
office
support
180072
job
and
31326
job
in
client
company
respectively
,
while
total
employment
in
IDA
client
company
stand
at
approximately
174500
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
indicate
yesterday
that
we
aim
be
to
create
100000
new
job
by
2016
and
we
think
this
be
a
realistic
proposition
.
we
be
well
on
we
way
,
with
a
extra
90000
job
have
be
create
in
net
term
since
the
Action
plan
for
Jobs
be
launch
in
2012
.
we
be
well
on
we
way
to
reach
the
100000
extra
job
during
this
year
,
a
full
18
month
ahead
of
schedule
.
we
facilitate
formal
mechanism
for
structure
ongoing
engagement
with
sme
through
the
advisory
group
on
small
business
,
the
high
level
group
on
good
regulation
and
the
retail
forum
.
this
formal
mechanism
can
and
do
feed
into
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
and
the
budget
process
,
ensure
facilitate
structure
and
regular
dialogue
between
the
government
and
representative
of
the
very
sector
about
which
we
be
speak
,
which
be
the
small
business
sector
,
on
any
issue
of
concern
and
on
how
to
promote
the
economic
development
and
job
potential
of
the
sector
.
it
must
be
say
that
raise
awareness
among
sme
and
entrepreneur
of
the
range
of
state
-
fund
support
available
remain
a
ongoing
challenge
for
the
public
policy
system
.
one
of
the
issue
which
cause
small
business
the
most
headache
be
the
lack
of
clarity
about
what
they
be
suppose
to
do
,
to
whom
they
need
to
speak
and
from
where
to
get
the
right
information
.
this
be
why
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
launch
actionplanforjobs.ie
and
have
partner
with
a
number
of
industry
ambassador
to
create
awareness
of
the
support
available
.
this
be
part
of
a
wide
effort
.
another
example
be
the
government
's
take
care
of
business
event
,
which
also
demonstrate
we
commitment
to
ensure
sme
have
easy
access
to
the
information
they
require
to
run
a
business
as
efficiently
and
effectively
as
possible
.
we
also
have
the
31
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
which
form
a
first
stop
shop
approach
for
business
in
each
community
and
this
will
continue
to
develop
relationship
.
if
we
look
at
the
metric
from
last
week
we
clearly
see
job
growth
from
the
activity
of
the
LEOs
.
it
be
four
year
since
we
take
office
and
we
economy
grow
by
4.8
%
last
year
.
it
be
the
fast
-
grow
economy
in
the
European
Union
.
when
we
start
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
the
unemployment
rate
be
at
15.1
%
.
it
have
fall
to
10
%
and
it
will
fall
below
10
%
very
shortly
.
I
thank
my
colleague
from
all
side
of
the
House
who
have
speak
since
yesterday
evening
on
this
topic
.
the
intention
be
to
place
sme
,
which
give
350000
people
a
income
in
this
country
on
a
daily
basis
,
at
the
centre
of
the
political
debate
.
we
have
succeed
to
some
degree
in
that
regard
,
give
the
media
coverage
and
discussion
on
this
topic
.
the
intention
of
the
motion
be
to
lay
down
some
very
specific
requirement
.
rather
than
go
for
a
scattergun
motion
and
throw
everything
in
with
it
,
we
lay
down
very
specific
request
,
such
as
the
introduction
of
a
earn
income
tax
credit
,
the
provision
of
prsi
and
social
protection
payment
,
a
information
campaign
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
to
highlight
the
service
and
benefit
available
to
self
-
employ
people
,
a
expansion
of
the
role
of
the
Strategic
Banking
Corporation
of
Ireland
,
change
in
capital
gain
tax
and
a
extension
to
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
.
while
all
that
thing
be
mention
approvingly
by
various
government
speaker
,
what
we
will
actually
be
voting
on
be
,
as
I
describe
it
last
night
,
the
labrador
puppy
of
government
amendment
.
everybody
love
it
.
everybody
will
pat
it
on
the
head
and
tell
it
,
"
you
be
a
great
lad
"
,
but
there
be
nothing
specific
there
that
we
can
hold
the
government
to
account
on
in
term
of
address
all
the
problem
that
have
be
raise
by
speaker
on
all
side
of
the
House
about
sme
.
this
be
why
we
will
vote
on
the
government
amendment
.
there
be
nothing
specific
in
term
of
address
a
insolvency
system
that
be
not
work
and
not
deliver
,
and
which
will
not
work
and
will
not
deliver
under
the
current
scheme
.
no
mention
be
make
over
the
two
night
of
why
the
Fine
Gael
Party
be
sell
out
the
Labour
Party
again
in
respect
of
the
bankruptcy
term
,
why
the
Fine
Gael
Party
be
not
bring
we
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
into
line
with
Northern
Ireland
and
England
in
term
of
bankruptcy
law
and
why
the
Taoiseach
continue
to
stick
he
head
in
the
sand
regard
the
inadequacy
of
we
insolvency
network
.
we
need
a
insolvency
system
that
will
deliver
for
all
cohort
,
but
particularly
for
sme
.
there
be
nothing
specific
regard
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
and
why
,
after
a
review
publish
in
mid-2014
,
which
highlight
its
inadequacy
,
we
be
now
move
rapidly
towards
mid-2015
and
we
be
no
further
on
in
term
of
change
the
scheme
and
address
that
inadequacy
.
meanwhile
,
business
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
that
need
access
to
that
facility
be
have
they
loan
sell
out
from
under
they
by
bank
.
they
be
be
sell
to
foreign
fund
with
no
respect
,
no
understanding
and
no
thought
for
the
selfless
effort
that
have
go
into
build
up
that
business
and
for
the
people
who
be
work
in
that
business
.
they
need
a
reform
credit
guarantee
scheme
,
but
it
be
not
a
priority
.
it
be
put
on
the
long
finger
.
as
I
say
when
I
open
this
debate
last
night
,
this
system
do
not
understand
how
it
be
for
someone
to
arrive
into
work
on
a
Monday
morning
and
not
know
if
they
will
have
money
to
pay
they
employee
,
never
mind
themselves
.
it
do
not
understand
what
it
be
like
for
someone
to
go
for
week
on
end
without
receive
a
cent
until
somebody
pay
they
,
and
then
they
must
pay
Revenue
,
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
they
supplier
and
only
then
,
if
there
be
anything
leave
,
will
the
business
owner
get
pay
.
life
as
a
sme
owner
be
not
,
as
people
like
to
portray
it
,
all
champagne
,
yacht
and
big
car
.
it
be
very
tough
.
a
system
that
do
not
understand
and
whose
every
response
demonstrate
that
lack
of
understanding
need
to
come
on
that
journey
and
to
understand
how
it
be
to
go
without
be
pay
.
then
we
might
see
urgency
around
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
and
the
need
for
a
new
business
bank
.
instead
of
set
up
and
give
money
to
bank
that
have
fail
Irish
business
,
and
small
business
in
particular
,
we
need
to
set
up
a
new
business
bank
and
take
they
on
.
the
money
be
there
to
do
it
.
that
be
what
this
two
night
have
be
about
-
inject
urgency
into
this
system
and
into
the
minister
's
Department
about
sme
and
not
treat
they
like
some
little
child
to
be
pat
on
the
back
and
tell
:
"
you
be
a
great
lad
.
stay
there
in
the
corner
,
be
quiet
and
do
not
embarrass
we
.
"
sme
be
the
lifeblood
of
this
economy
.
they
will
get
this
country
back
on
its
foot
.
it
be
time
we
have
a
government
and
a
system
that
respect
they
.
the
amendment
show
no
respect
and
no
understanding
of
the
position
sme
be
in
at
present
and
that
be
why
we
will
oppose
it
.
this
be
a
complete
abuse
of
privilege
.
that
be
just
not
true
.
who
appoint
he
?
they
do
not
understand
the
answer
.
this
current
issue
relate
to
pancrea
transplantation
,
not
kidney
transplantation
.
dialysis
be
for
kidney
treatment
and
not
pancrea
problem
.
the
renal
unit
seem
to
be
work
relatively
well
in
Beaumont
.
certainly
,
it
have
not
be
the
case
that
any
kidney
that
could
have
be
transplant
in
Ireland
be
export
or
anything
like
that
.
I
be
not
involved
in
recruitment
to
individual
post
in
Beaumont
or
any
other
hospital
,
but
I
understand
the
hospital
have
difficulty
fill
the
post
in
question
.
it
be
advertise
and
the
hospital
be
unable
to
get
someone
.
that
be
a
ongoing
problem
in
we
health
service
.
what
would
happen
in
the
private
sector
be
that
a
organisation
would
go
out
and
head
-
hunt
someone
and
pay
the
person
whatever
have
to
be
pay
,
but
that
be
not
how
the
public
service
work
.
we
do
not
give
market
rate
to
individual
people
.
for
various
reason
,
the
public
service
be
different
from
the
private
sector
in
that
regard
,
for
good
and
for
bad
.
anyway
,
the
important
thing
now
be
that
the
new
arrangement
be
be
put
in
place
.
it
be
anticipate
that
the
arrangement
will
be
fully
in

the

deputy

should
read
back
on

report
late
on

I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
deputy
McGrath
may
heckle
away
.
let
I
say
in
the
first
instance
that
I
recognise
the
purpose
behind
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Pringle
and
welcome
the
opportunity
to
debate
the
issue
.
while
I
oppose
the
Bill
I
would
like
to
assure
the
Deputy
that
the
government
be
fully
commit
to
economic
,
social
and
cultural
development
within
Ireland
through
the
annual
allocation
of
money
and
resource
via
the
Oireachtas
and
also
in
the
context
of
international
co-operation
.
as
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
I
would
like
to
begin
by
set
out
we
commitment
to
human
rights
in
the
international
context
.
at
the
end
of
this
year
,
Ireland
will
conclude
a
three
-
year
term
on
the
UN
human
Right
Council
.
on
the
council
,
Ireland
have
work
to
promote
and
protect
the
human
rights
of
all
people
,
particularly
the
marginalised
and
most
vulnerable
.
I
be
particularly
proud
of
the
resolution
we
lead
on
combat
preventable
mortality
and
morbidity
of
child
under
five
year
of
age
.
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human
rights
be
one
of
six
priority
area
within
we
international
development
policy
.
Ireland
remain
commit
to
achieve
the
UN
target
of
0.7
%
of
GNP
in
official
development
assistance
as
we
economy
improve
.
we
give
particular
importance
to
the
role
of
the
UN
human
rights
treaty
monitoring
body
.
in
2014
,
Ireland
's
record
under
the
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
political
Right
be
examine
by
the
UN

Right
Committee
,
a
body
of

by
that
country
that
have
ratify
that
convention
.
Ireland
's
delegation
be
lead
by
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
next
month
,
on
8
and
9
June
,
Ireland
's
examination
under
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
will
be
examine
by
the
UN
Committee
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
.
I
will
lead
a
delegation
which
will
be
compose
of
official
from
my
Department
and
from
the
Department
with
responsibility
for
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
of
course
,
we
acknowledge
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human
rights
lie
within
the
state
themselves
.
we
appreciate
the
important
role
of
the
committee
,
and
all
of
the
Unite
Nation
treaty
monitoring
body
,
in
hold
state
party
to
account
regard
they
international
human
rights
obligation
.
Ireland
be
proud
to
play
a
instrumental
role
in
the
recent
strengthen
process
of
treaty
monitoring
body
,
call
the
Dublin
process
,
as
two
key
meeting
of
international
expert
be
hold
in
Iveagh
House
.
I
be
not
sure
if
it
have
be
distribute
.
we
will
make
provision
for
that
.
I
apologise
to
the
House
if
the
script
have
not
be
make
available
.
I
be
sure
my
official
be
watch
now
and
can
ensure
that
it
happen
.
without
doubt
.
in
March
,
the
government
establish
a
interdepartmental
committee
on
human
rights
to
improve
co-ordination
throughout
the
government
on
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human
rights
in
we
foreign
policy
.
the
interdepartmental
committee
will
progress
ratification
by
Ireland
of
key
international
human
rights
treaty
,
monitor
the
implementation
of
Ireland
's
treaty
obligation
,
and
facilitate
timely
reporting
to
international
treaty
body
in
accordance
with
this
obligation
.
as
chair
of
the
interdepartmental
committee
,
I
look
forward
to
watch
it
bear
fruit
as
it
become
embed
in
we
operational
process
.
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
be
the
main
treaty
protect
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
it
be
adopt
,
as
have
be
state
,
and
be
open
for
signature
,
ratification
and
accession
by
the
General
Assembly
in
1966
.
it
enter
into
force
on
3
January
1976
.
Ireland
sign
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
in
1973
and
ratify
it
in
1989
.
the
covenant
have
be
ratify
by
164
country
,
include
all
EU
member
state
.
the
covenant
contain
some
of
the
most
significant
international
legal
provision
establish
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
,
include
rights
relate
to
work
in
just
and
favourable
condition
,
to
social
protection
,
to
a
adequate
standard
of
living
,
to
the
high
attainable
standard
of
physical
and
mental
health
,
to
education
,
to
take
part
in
cultural
life
and
to
enjoyment
of
the
benefit
of
scientific
progress
.
in
November
2000
Ireland
ratify
the
1996
revise
European
social
Charter
,
which
be
the
Council
of
Europe
's
treaty
on
social
and
economic
rights
.
I
note
two
of
the
Deputy
opposite
have
leave
the
Chamber
.
I
hope
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
at
least
have
regard
to
the
reply
,
provide
on
behalf
of
the
government
,
to
some
of
the
point
they
make
.
on
the
same
date
Ireland
ratify
the
1995
additional
protocol
to
the
European
social
Charter
,
which
provide
for
a
system
of
collective
complaint
.
while
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
have
not
be
incorporate
into
domestic
law
,
the
substance
of
a
number
of
the
rights
contain
in
the
covenant
be
protect
by
the
constitution
and
by
legislation
.
although
not
cognisable
by
the
court
,
article
45
of
the
Constitution
set
out
directive
principle
of
social
policy
for
the
general
guidance
of
the
Legislature
.
if
we
be
to
move
to
a
situation
,
and
I
make
a
genuine
point
,
whereby
this
legislation
be
incorporate
such
that
there
be
a
constitutional
referendum
,
we
must
be
cognisant
of
the
separation
of
power
between
the
executive
,
the
Judiciary
and
the
Legislature
on
point
of
law
which
might
come
forward
where
test
case
be
make
and
what
the
role
of
the
Legislature
would
be
thereafter
,
or
would
it
be
diminish
relative
to
the
Judiciary
.
I
make
this
point
in
a
very
genuine
way
.
I
know
deputy
Pringle
in
reply
to
the
debate
will
respond
to
this
.
the
government
aim
at
ensure
that
the
State
's
obligation
to
implement
the
covenant
in
Ireland
be
meet
through
policy
aim
at
improve
the
enjoyment
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
,
include
by
fight
persistent
poverty
and
social
exclusion
and
recognise
that
other
,
include
individual
,
family
and
many
organisation
and
body
,
have
important
responsibility
as
well
.
the
means
by
which
the
State
set
out
to
meet
its
obligation
in
this
area
be
through
the
allocation
of
resource
.
I
will
now
speak
about
human
rights
in
the
domestic
context
,
notably
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
.
Ireland
have
ratify
the
instrument
refer
to
above
which
promote
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
since
we
last
review
by
the
UN
Committee
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
in
2002
,
Ireland
enjoy
a
period
of
unprecedented
economic
growth
,
follow
by
a
equally
acute
financial
crisis
,
result
,
as
we
know
,
in
a
international
bailout
package
and
more
than
five
year
of
tough
measure
.
social
transfer
be
use
to
mitigate
inequality
and
effort
be
make
to
ensure
a
minimum
core
content
of
rights
.
we
approach
be
not
to
apply
blanket
reduction
to
all
area
of
spending
,
but
rather
to
reform
expenditure
in
a
way
that
continue
to
protect
,
where
possible
,
we
society
's
most
vulnerable
people
to
the
great
extent
possible
within
we
available
resource
.
since
take
office
in
2011
,
the
government
have
be
determined
to
fulfil
the
mandate
give
to
we
by
the
Irish
people
to
repair
the
economy
and
public
finances
,
create
job
and
give
we
citizen
confidence
in
a
good
future
.
the
scale
of
the
economic
crisis
we
have
go
through
be
unprecedented
in
Ireland
's
history
.
difficult
decision
have
be
take
and
huge
sacrifice
have
be
make
by
the
Irish
people
,
but
this
have
not
be
in
vain
.
the
spring
economic
statement
confirm
the
path
that
have
be
take
be
the
right
one
.
as
we
now
plan
for
the
remainder
of
this
decade
,
we
citizen
have
every
reason
to
be
confident
and
hopeful
about
they
future
.
this
future
will
have
steady
,
stable
economic
growth
and
more
people
work
in
secure
and
sustainable
job
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
State
.
it
will
be
a
future
of
stable
public
finances
that
will
deliver
money
in
people
's
pocket
,
high
quality
public
service
and
strategic
investment
in
essential
infrastructure
throughout
the
country
.
this
hard

the
fact
clearly
show
the
policy
of
the
government
have
work
and
will
continue
to
work
in
the
year
ahead
.
we
economy

at
the

rate
in

,
by

in

and
the

this

steady

stable
economic
growth

the
spring
economic
statement
be
part
of
a
much
broad
reform
of

budgetary
framework
.
the
next
in
this
new
framework
be
the
national
economic
dialogue
and
I
refer
specifically
-----
in
the
time
allocate
to
I
to
speak
on
the
Bill
I
be
provide
the
context
in
which
the
Bill
be
be
put
forward
.
on
the
point
make
by
deputy
Collins
,
let
I
say
a
national
economic
dialogue
will
take
place
in
July
.
this
will
wide
consultation
on
the
budget
with
key
stakeholder
and
will
fully
respect
the
role
of
the
government
and
the
Oireachtas
to
make
policy
.
deputy
Collins
will
have
a
opportunity
to
make
she
own
or
she
party
's
submission
to
the
dialogue
and
we
look
forward
to
the
idea
she
will
propose
in
the
process
.
let
I
remind
deputy
Collins
the
government
have
legislate
for
the
restoration
of
the
minimum
wage
-----
-----
and
we
have
take
thousand
of
worker
out
of
the
universal
social
charge
.
let
I
also
say
the
national
economic
dialogue
be
about
ensure
we
have
a
inform
and
mature
discussion
on
the
short
and
medium
-
term
priority
of
the
government
and
beyond
.
undoubtedly
,
in
recent
year
considerable
sacrifice
be
make
by
the
people
of
Ireland
and
it
pose
challenge
in
term
of
the
progressive
realisation
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
in
line
with
the
covenant
before
we
now
.
however
,
as
I
have
state
,
we
be
already
see
the
fruit
of
we
labour
.
the
public
finances
be
under
control
with
the
deficit
fall
below
3
%
this
year
and
debt
level
be
set
to
move
down
towards
the
European
average
in
the
next
few
year
.
as
a
result
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
implement
another
expansionary
budget
this
year
and
every
year
out
to
2020
if
this
be
deem
prudent
and
appropriate
.
we
will
meet
we
medium
-
term
objective
of
a
balance
budget
in
structural
term
over
the
forecast
horizon
.
in
order
to
return
stability
to
the
public
finances
,
gross
vote
expenditure
be
reduce
from
its
peak
of
more
than
€
63
billion
in
2009
to
€
54
billion
in
2014
.
in
implement
expenditure
reduction
,
the
government
's
priority
have
be
to
protect
key
public
service
and
social
support
to
the
great
extent
possible
at
a
time
of
increase
demand
.
this
target
approach
have
mean
that
primary
social
welfare
rate
such
as

have
be
fully
maintain
since
the
government
take
office
.
we

that

budget
2015
mark
a
turning
point
when
expenditure
reduction
be
no
long
require
to
meet
we
fiscal
target
.
we
be
now
in
a
position
to
provide
target
increase
for
key
service
.
in
the
area
of
education
,
we
have
seek
from
the
beginning
to
protect
DEIS
expenditure
,
which
prioritise
the
educational
need
of
child
and
young
people
from
disadvantaged
area
.
in

,

across

will
amount

,
include
the

Recognition
Bill

and
the
Children
and
Family
Relationship
Act
2015
.
this
set
the
context
for
we
discussion
today
about
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
.
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
,
ICESCR
,
require
state
that
be
party
to
it
to
take
step
,
to
the
maximum
of
they
available
resource
,
to
achieve
progressively
the
full
realisation
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
the
concept
of
progressive
realisation
constitute
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
will
generally
not
be
possible
to
achieve
the
full
realisation
of
all
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
a
short
period
of
time
.
the
reference
to
resource
availability
reflect
a
recognition
that
the
realisation
of
this
rights
can
be
hamper
by
a
lack
of
resource
and
can
be
achieve
only
over
a
period
of
time
.
equally
,
it
mean
that
a
state
's
compliance
with
its
obligation
to
take
appropriate
measure
be
assess
in
light
of
the
resource
,
financial
and
otherwise
,
available
to
it
.
even
though
state
may
realise
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
progressively
,
they
must
also
take
immediate
action
,
irrespective
of
they
resource
,
in
five
area
:
elimination
of
discrimination
;
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
not
subject
to
progressive
realisation
;
obligation
to
"
take
step
"
;
non-retrogressive
measure
;
and
minimum
core
obligation
.
if
either
of
the
two
referenda
on
Friday
pass
,
it
will
be
the
first
time
that
a
proposal
for
constitutional
reform
put
forward
by
a
constitutional
convention
result
in
actual
constitutional
change
.
I
ask
the
House
to
reject
the
Bill
,
while
thank
Deputy
Pringle
and
Healy
for
put
it
forward
,
because
it
be
important
that
voice
be
give
to
a
Bill
that
seek
to
change
the
constitution
.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the
constitution
.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Humphrey
,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order
Paper
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
's
speech
be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle
-
income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase
they
income
and
asset
during
the
recession
and
the

of
the
current

recently
,
the
Sunday

tell
we
that
the
250

73.4

be
something

30

there

some

this

be

it
be
no

do
not

rights

constitution

I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the
constitution
.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin

,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order
Paper
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
's
speech
be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle

income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

a

the

tell

that

not

the

that

this
people
be
bail

it
be
no
wonder
that
the

which
include
the

,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social

cultural
rights
into

when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense

.
there
be
a
huge
sense
of
disappointment
,
particularly
among
member
of

the
various
non-governmental

which
promote
the

of
put

basic

I
commend

in

I
have
hope

for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of

across
the

of

I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that

might
agree

on

start
the

whereby
economic

I
would
have
expect
the
Labour

,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock

out
,
the
1916

the

give
the

of
that
party
's

James

Jim

,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour

would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in

,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the

.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at

will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour

's
position
be
also
a

its

it
be
a

to

,
as

to
the

have
a

of
the
inequality
over
which
the

the
last

it
be
worth

be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own

.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister

who
have
a

similar
to
this
on
the

the

be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle

income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

a

the

that

this

be

it
be
no

that

do
not

I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that

on

and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic

I
would

would
have
take

this
people
be
bail

it
be
no
wonder
that
the

,
which
include
the
Labour

,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
into
the
constitution
when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense
social
dislocation
.
there
be
a
huge
sense
of
disappointment
,
particularly
among
member
of
the
constitutional

and
the
various
non-governmental
organisation
which
promote
the
idea
of
put

basic

into

I
commend

in

I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank

for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of

across
the
floor
of
the

.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the

might
agree
to
take
the

on

and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic

social

have
be
put

I
would
have
expect
the
Labour

,
in

,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916

the

give
the
view
of
that
party
's

,
James

Jim

,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its

it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí

,
who
propose
a

,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister

,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order

the
Minister
of

,
deputy

be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four

a
half

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

family

be
carry

very
wealthy

have

be

a

of
the
inequality
over

the

have
preside

it

worth
repeat

very
wealthy
people
have

that
the
250
rich

€
73.4

which
be
something
like
30

a
couple
of
week
before
that
,
the
Sunday
Independent
tell
we
the
rich
300
people
in
Ireland
have
a

we
know
from
the
Central

the
official

,
that
the
financial

of
the
wealthy

in

be

high
than
they
be
at

not
so
long
ago
,
the
minister
for
Finance
tell
I
that
the
high
pay
10000
people
each
have
€
595000
per

side

with
that

there

340000

unemployed
with
a

80000

there
be
thousand

some
400000

there
be
300000

almost
2

high
than

this
people
be
bail
out
the

a

.
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
government
,
which
include
the
Labour
Party
,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
into
the
constitution
when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense
social
dislocation
.
there
be
a
huge
sense
of
disappointment
,
particularly
among
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
and
the
various
non-governmental
organisation
which
promote
the
idea
of
put
this
basic
rights
into

I
commend
the
Bill
to
the

in
close
the

,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of

across
the
floor
of
the

.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the

might
agree
to
take
the

on

and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic

social

could
have
be
put

I
would
have
expect
the
Labour

,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the

of
the

give
the
view
of
that
party
's

,
James
Connolly

Jim

,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour

would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the

.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at

will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast

a
arrogant

the

and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the
constitution
.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Humphrey
,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order
Paper
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
's
speech
be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle
-
income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase
they
income
and
asset
during
the
recession
and
the
term
of
the
current
government
.
recently
,
the
Sunday
Times
tell
we
that
the
250
rich
people
have
€
73.4
billion
between
they
,
which
be
something
like
30
%
of
gross
domestic
product
.
a
couple
of
week
before
that
,
the
Sunday
Independent
tell
we
the
rich
300
people
in
Ireland
have
a
wealth
of
€
84
billion
.
we
know
from
the
Central
Statistics
Office
,
the
official
government
statistic
,
that
the
financial
asset
of
the
wealthy
people
in
society
be
now
high
than
they
be
at
the
height
of
the
boom
.
not
so
long
ago
,
the
minister
for
Finance
tell
I
that
the
high
pay
10000
people
each
have
€
595000
per
annum
.
side
by
side
with
that
,
there
be
approximately
100000
family
on
social
housing
waiting
list
and
340000
people
unemployed
with
a
further
80000
in
scheme
of
various
kind
.
there
be
thousand
of
people
on
trolley
in
we
hospital
and
that
figure
have
increase
since
last
year
.
some
400000
people
be
await
outpatient
appointment
and
35000
family
face
eviction
over
the
next
few
year
.
there
be
300000
mortgage
holder
pay
a
variable
rate
almost
2
%
high
than
the
European
average
.
this
people
be
bail
out
the
bank
a
second
time
.
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
government
,
which
include
the
Labour
Party
,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
into
the
constitution
when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense
social
dislocation
.
there
be
a
huge
sense
of
disappointment
,
particularly
among

of
the
constitutional
Convention
and
the
various
non-governmental
organisation
which
promote
the
idea
of
put
this
basic
rights
into
we
constitution
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well

some

in

,
various
expert
opinion
in
,
or
close
to
,
the
Central
Bank
be
forecasting
the
demise
of
the
Irish
credit
union
movement
.
this
expert
opinion
prove
to
be
well
wide
of
the
mark
.
only
four
credit
union
out
of
well
over
400
at
the
time
,
less
than
1
%
,
have
be
resolve
since
then
.
the
credit
union
sector
have
work
hard
at
build
up
reserve
which
be
the
envy
of
every
banking
institution
in
Europe
.
the
Irish
credit
union
sector
be
the
most
heavily
reserve
financial
sector
.
much
mention
be
make
of
the
commission
on
credit
union
.
to
be
fair
to
the
government
,
its
establishment
be
one
of
the
first
promise
on
which
it
deliver
.
the
commission
's
report
,
deliver
in
March
2012
,
be
a
comprehensive
and
balance
way
forward
.
it
seek
a
balance
of
measure
to
secure
the
future
of
credit
union
.
it
pain
I
,
however
,
to
say
the
commission
's
report
be
be
implement
in
a
selective
and
unbalanced
manner
,
cause
distress
to
the
sector
and
undo
many
of
the
positive
of
the
report
.
the
one
size
fit
all
regulatory
regime
be
propose
by
the
Central
Bank
in
Consultation
Paper
88
,
otherwise
know
as
CP88
,
be
a
exercise
in
suppressive
regulation
and
micro-management
,
in
which
it
propose
to
effectively
manage
the
very
same
credit
union
it
be
suppose
to
be
regulate
on
a
dispassionate
basis
.
sure
,
the
Central
Bank
consult
,
and
when
it
meet
with
unanimous
rejection
from
every
organisation
,
body
and
credit
union
in
the
sector
it
decide
to
go
ahead
regardless
.
this
be
consistent
with
a
pattern
that
be
now
well
establish
.
we
Central
Bank
have
the
most
extensive
power
of
any
regulatory
body
in
Europe
when
it
come
to
regulate
credit
union
and
yet
it
want
more
.
I
urge
review
and
caution
here
.
I
be
aware
of
credit
union
that
have
not
be
allow
to
hold
agm
for
two
,
four
or
more
year
but
the
credit
Union
Act
be
very
clear
.
section
78
(
4
)
state
the
bank
may
direct
the
credit
union
to
"
postpone
,
for
a
period
not
exceed
nine
month
,
the
hold
of
the
annual
general
meeting
of
the
credit
union
in
respect
of
the
financial
year
specify
in
the
direction
.
"
there
be
question
to
be
answer
as
to
why
exist
power
be
be
apply
in
this
way
.
remember
,
credit
union
be
the
member
's
union
,
and
member
have
the
right
to
know
what
be
go
on
.
very
legitimate
concern
have
be
raise
by
credit
union
in
recent
day
.
they
say
that
under
exist
regulation
they
effort
to
introduce
debit
card
be
be
frustrate
at
every
turn
by
the
regulatory
regime
.
even
the
most
basic
,
risk
free
,
prepay
debit
card
be
be
turn
down
.
now
,
the
regulator
want
to
limit
inflow
of
savings
and
loan
type
.
what
hope
have
we
of
develop
a
viable
third
force
capable
of
compete
with
the
banking
sector
?
the
lending
restriction
place
on
credit
union
by
this
self
-
same
regulator
have
do
profound
commercial
damage
.
it
be
commercially
naive
of
the
Central
Bank
to
think
it
can
switch
off
lending
for
four
year
and
not
damage
credit
union
and
they
credibility
in
the
local
market
.
this
be
not
a
wise
use
of
power
,
and
be
a
further
indicator
that
the
regulator
should
not
become
involved
in
the
day
to
day
run
of
the
body
they
regulate
.
will
the
Ceann
Comhairle
allow
I
another
ten
second
?
I
thank
deputy
Mulherin
and
I
appreciate
it
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
not
to
comment
on
the
government
's
very
welcome
initiative
on
microlending
.
let
we
be
honest
,
this
be
the
business
of
credit
union
.
they
have
be
restrict
from
operate
in
this
area
by
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
's
prudential
lending
circular
of
February
2013
.
this
circular
and
the
way
it
be
interpret
by
regulatory
inspector
will
make
it
impossible
for
the
new
scheme
to
be
a
success
.
credit
union
have
invest
in
compliance
and
in
improve
they
governance
arrangement
and
internal
control
.
that
structure
must
now
be
fund
because
they
come
with
additional
cost
.
the
reality
be
that
credit
union
need
to
be
give
the
tool
to
allow
they
to
compete
in
the
Ireland
of
2015
and
to
justify
the
cost
involve
in
comply
with
that
regulatory
structure
.
New
business
opportunity
,
product
and
service
be
not
be
sanction
.
not
a
single
new
credit
union
product
or
service
have
be
sanction
by
the
registrar
in
recent
year
.
credit
union
must
be
allow
to
lend
sensibly
.
of
course
they
lending
have
to
be
prudent
.
the
restriction
that
be
currently
in
place
be
simply
ridiculous
.
last
night
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
make
great
play
of
the
fact
that
credit
union
can
now
apply
for
a
review
of
they
lending
restriction
.
I
assure
the
House
that
the
review
process
be
extremely
onerous
and
expensive
and
involve
a
huge
amount
of
work
by
the
internal
auditor
of
the
credit
union
.
I
will
ask
a
fundamental
question
in
this
context
.
why
do
they
have
to
apply
?
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
have
be
crawl
all
over
Irish
credit
union
in
recent
year
.
there
have
be
on
-
site
inspection
.
they
have
be
through
the
book
upside
down
and
inside
out
.
credit
union
be
be
put
to
the
trouble
,
hassle
and
expense
of
make
formal
application
to
have
they
lending
restriction
review
.
that
should
be
do
as
part
of
the
normal
regulation
of
credit
union
.
the
minister
should
take
that
point
up
with
they
.
when
the
minister
speak
about
the
credit
Union
Advisory
Committee
last
night
,
he
do
not
mention
that
it
be
a
statutory
committee
that
have
to
be
establish
in
law
.
equally
,
he
do
not
mention
that
there
be
no
representative
of
the
credit
union
movement
on
the
advisory
committee
.
that
be
a
joke
and
should
be
amend
immediately
.
the
advisory
committee
's
term
of
reference
be
very
narrow
.
it
be
not
look
at
fundamental
issue
like
the
overall
business
model
,
the
need
to
modernise
the
structure
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
regulation
that
credit
union
be
face
.
why
have
some
credit
union
not
be
allow
to
hold
annual
general
meeting
for
four
year
?
if
the
issue
in
the
credit
union
be
so
serious
,
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
should
come
out
and
say
so
,
base
on
the
level
of
work
it
have
do
to
date
.
why
be
credit
union
be
leave
in
the
dark
?
as
I
say
last
night
,
the
healthy
credit
union
be
not
be
tell
that
they
be
healthy
and
that
they
should
continue
to
do
what
they
be
do
.
equally
,
credit
union
with
problem
be
not
be
tell
what
that
problem
be
and
how
they
can
be
fix
.
this
be
not
acceptable
.
while
the
situation
be

I

do

I

,
this

if

it
have
put
the

of

I
ask

to
have
a
fresh

the

the

be
not

I
commend

that

be

because
they
come
with
additional

.
the
reality
be
that

need
to
be
give
the
tool
to
allow
they
to
compete
in
the
Ireland
of

and
to

the

last
night
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
make
great
play
of
the
fact
that
credit
union
can
now
apply
for
a
review
of
they
lending
restriction
.
I
assure
the
House
that
the
review
process
be
extremely
onerous
and
expensive
and
involve
a
huge
amount
of
work
by
the
internal
auditor
of
the
credit
union
.
I
will
ask
a
fundamental
question
in
this
context
.
why
do
they
have
to
apply
?
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
have
be
crawl
all
over
Irish
credit
union
in
recent
year
.
there
have
be
on
-
site
inspection
.
they
have
be
through
the
book
upside
down
and
inside
out
.
credit
union
be
be
put
to
the
trouble
,
hassle
and
expense
of
make
formal
application
to
have
they
lending
restriction
review
.
that
should
be
do
as
part
of
the
normal
regulation
of
credit
union
.
the
minister
should
take
that
point
up
with
they
.
when
the
minister
speak
about
the
credit
Union
Advisory
Committee
last
night
,
he
do
not
mention
that
it
be
a
statutory
committee
that
have
to
be
establish
in
law
.
equally
,
he
do
not
mention
that
there
be
no
representative
of
the
credit
union
movement
on
the
advisory
committee
.
that
be
a
joke
and
should
be
amend
immediately
.
the
advisory
committee
's
term
of
reference
be
very
narrow
.
it
be
not
look
at
fundamental
issue
like
the
overall
business
model
,
the
need
to
modernise
the
structure
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
regulation
that
credit
union
be
face
.
why
have
some
credit
union
not
be
allow
to
hold
annual
general
meeting
for
four
year
?
if
the
issue
in
the
credit
union
be
so
serious
,
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
should
come
out
and
say
so
,
base
on
the
level
of
work
it
have
do
to
date
.
why
be
credit
union
be
leave
in
the
dark
?
as
I
say
last
night
,
the
healthy
credit
union
be
not
be
tell
that
they
be
healthy
and
that
they
should
continue
to

what
they
be

equally

that

how

this
be
not

.

the

front
.
deputy
Wallace
be
spend
too
much

I
thank
all
the
Deputy
who
have
contribute
.
I
do
not
agree
with
some
of
the
comment
but
I
accept
that
people
be
make
contribution
in
a
spirit
of
try
to
impact
on
what
the
outcome
of
the
White
Paper
will
look
like
.
I
will
do
what
I
can
to
take
on
board
as
many
suggestion
as
possible
that
we
have
hear
.
I
will
not
go
through
each
suggestion
because
if
I
do
that
I
would
only
get
through
two
or
three
.
we
have
write
down
some
the
individual
comment
and
we
will
try
to
look
at
they
in
the
context
of
the
overall
paper
.
I
will
,
however
,
make
a
few
general
comment
because
I
suspect
some
Defence
force
personnel
may
be
watch
this
debate
.
I
regard
be
a
Irish
soldier
as
one
of
the
most
significant
form
of
patriotism
that
be
leave
in
term
of
serve
the
State
.
this
be
a
White
Paper
of
which
Defence
force
personnel
,
whether
reservist
or
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
should
be
proud
and
in
which
they
should
see
a
future
for
themselves
and
they
career
as
member
of
the
Defence
Force
in
Ireland
.
they
should
view
with
pride
the
contribution
they
will
make
to
they
country
,
its
security
and
that
of
its
people
.
the
Defence
Force
be
a
hugely
important
part
of
we
national
infrastructure
.
they
would
be
the
last
line
of
defence
if
thing
be
to
take
a
significant
unexpected
negative
turn
,
which
may
happen
at
some
stage
in
the
future
and
which
we
cannot
predict
.
my
role
be
to
put
in
place
a
White
Paper
that
try
to
anticipate
all
future
risk
,
within
reason
,
and
to
try
to
put
together
a
infrastructure
involve
human
resource
,
equipment
,
knowledge
,
training
and
the
skillset
that
can
respond
to
the
list
of
threat
that
change
every
year
.
a
lot
of
the
commentary
in
the
debate
have
refer
to
how
quickly
some
of
the
threat
be
change
.
to
all
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
I
say
that
we
want
you
to
be
proud
of
who
you
be
and
the
career
you
have
choose
.
I
hope
that
you
will
see
,
like
so
many
other
in
the
public
sector
,
the
reward
for
the
sacrifice
you
have
make
in
recent
year
in
response
to
a
financial
crisis
in
this
country
as
we
see
improve
working
condition
and
pay
.
I
also
thank
that
personnel
for
they
commitment
and
loyalty
for
stay
in
the
Defence
Force
through
that
period
and
for
facilitate
the
reform
which
be
not
simply
a
cost
-
save
measure
but
a
reconfiguration
of
the
Defence
Force
to
ensure
we
get
the
maximum
effect
in
term
of
output
for
the
country
from
a
strength
of
9500
personnel
.
I
want
to
explore
some
new
opportunity
in
this
White
Paper
.
I
want
to
create
a
platform
for
international
education
and
understanding
of
peacekeeping
and
conflict
resolution
and
I
want
we
to
give
leadership
in
area
such
as
gender
-
base
violence
,
in
which
Ireland
have
some
credibility
,
and
other
skillset
in
which
we
have
prove
we
worth
in
international
peacekeeping
operation
,
particularly
in
place
like
the
Middle
East
and
Africa
.
we
have
the
capacity
to
build
a
international
piece
of
infrastructure
of
real
value
to
the
Unite
Nation
and
to
we
European
partner
.
I
also
think
we
can
do
more
in
term
of
corporate
social
responsibility
to
reach
out
to
young
people
who
have
be
fail
by
the
State
and
who
may
be
enter
a
permanent
state
of
disadvantage
in
they
life
.
the
Defence
Force
may
be
able
to
transform
a
life
by
reach
out
to
such
people
.
we
have
look
at
international
good
practice
to
learn
what
might
work
in
Ireland
and
I
look
forward
to
explore
that
concept
with
other
in
this
House
when
we
publish
the
White
Paper
.
there
must
be
a
sense
of
value
,
recognition
,
pride
and
self
-
esteem
from
be
a
member
of
the
Defence
Force
when
a
person
leave
,
as
well
as
when
he
or
she
be
there
.
for
this
reason
there
be
some
very
strong
statement
in
the
White
Paper
around
veteran
's
policy
.
it
be
totally
unacceptable
that
a
person
who
be
injure
severely
in
the
line
of
duty
may
have
to
go
to
court
to
secure
a
significant
compensation
package
.
we
be
look
at
put
new
structure
in
place
which
be
far
less
adversarial
and
which
recognise
the
respect
we
should
have
for
the
Defence
Force
,
for
the
work
they
do
and
the
risk
they
take
.
all
this
will
require
a
budget
which
will
necessitate
a
incremental
increase
over
time
,
and
we
be
commit
to
a
ten
-
year
period
for
this
.
I
recognise
the
constraint
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Howlin
,
and
he
Department
be
under
at
the
moment
and
we
be
realist
about
this
,
but
we
also
want
to
ensure
defence
be
part
of
the
medium
and
long
-
term
financial
planning
of
the
country
.
the
security
and
defence
of
the
State
be
not
just
about
soldier
and
defence
.
it
be
also
about
planning
and
management
across
Department
,
involve
foreign
affair
,
justice
,
transportation
and
the
Office
of
the
Taoiseach
,
in
order
that
we
can
have
a
defence
and
security
policy
for
Ireland
in
the
future
that
be
fit
for
purpose
in
the
modern
world
.
I
thank
everyone
for
they
contribution
and
we
will
do
we
good
to
accommodate
the
contribution
that
be
helpful
.
government
policy
on
neutrality
be
settle
and
this
be
reflect
in
the
recent
policy
document
that
come
from
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
we
do
not
propose
to
change
that
but
will
reinforce
it
in
the
White
Paper
by
the
maintenance
of
the
triple
lock
in
we
approach
towards
neutrality
.
this
do
not
mean
stay
out
of
trouble
all
the
time
.
it
mean
Ireland
be
independent
to
choose
what
we
do
and
what
we
do
not
do
in
term
of
international
peacekeeping
and
peace
support
.
that
be
what
we
will
continue
to
do
with
the
triple
of
lock
.
I
thank
that
work
in
the
House
for
facilitate
we
in
stay
here
for
a
extra
20
minute
.
I
thank
all
the
Deputy
who
have
contribute
.
I
do
not
agree
with
some
of
the
comment
but
I
accept
that
people
be
make
contribution
in
a
spirit
of
try
to
impact
on
what
the
outcome
of
the
White
Paper
will
look
like
.
I
will
do
what
I
can
to
take
on
board
as
many
suggestion
as
possible
that
we
have
hear
.
I
will
not
go
through
each
suggestion
because
if
I
do
that
I
would
only
get
through
two
or
three
.
we
have
write
down
some
the
individual
comment
and
we
will
try
to
look
at
they
in
the
context
of
the
overall
paper
.
I
will
,
however
,
make
a
few
general
comment
because
I
suspect
some
Defence
force
personnel
may
be
watch
this
debate
.
I
regard
be
a
Irish
soldier
as
one
of
the
most
significant
form
of
patriotism
that
be
leave
in
term
of
serve
the
State
.
this
be
a
White
Paper
of
which
Defence
force
personnel
,
whether
reservist
or
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
should
be
proud
and
in
which
they
should
see
a
future
for
themselves
and
they
career
as
member
of
the
Defence
Force
in
Ireland
.
they
should
view
with
pride
the
contribution
they
will
make
to
they
country
,
its
security
and
that
of
its
people
.
the
Defence
Force
be
a
hugely
important
part
of
we
national
infrastructure
.
they
would
be
the
last
line
of
defence
if
thing
be
to
take
a
significant
unexpected
negative
turn
,
which
may
happen
at
some
stage
in
the
future
and
which
we
cannot
predict
.
my
role
be
to
put
in
place
a
White
Paper
that
try
to
anticipate
all
future
risk
,
within
reason
,
and
to
try
to
put
together
a
infrastructure
involve
human
resource
,
equipment
,
knowledge
,
training
and
the
skillset
that
can
respond
to
the
list
of
threat
that
change
every
year
.
a
lot
of
the
commentary
in
the
debate
have
refer
to
how
quickly
some
of
the
threat
be
change
.
to
all
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
I
say
that
we
want
you
to
be
proud
of
who
you
be
and
the
career
you
have
choose
.
I
hope
that
you
will
see
,
like
so
many
other
in
the
public
sector
,
the
reward
for
the
sacrifice
you
have
make
in
recent
year
in
response
to
a
financial
crisis
in
this
country
as
we
see
improve
working
condition
and
pay
.
I
also
thank
that
personnel
for
they
commitment
and
loyalty
for
stay
in
the
Defence
Force
through
that
period
and
for
facilitate
the
reform
which
be
not
simply
a
cost
-
save
measure
but
a
reconfiguration
of
the
Defence
Force
to
ensure
we
get
the
maximum
effect
in
term
of
output
for
the
country
from
a
strength
of
9500
personnel
.
I
want
to
explore
some

that
all
issue
relate
to
hospital
waiting
list
be
resolve
.
the
deputy
mention
a
figure
of
4409
.
I
just
have
a
brief
chance
to
analyse
some
of
the
figure
.
a
figure
of
3066
be
related
to
ophthalmology
,
for
instance
.
this
be
a
significant
number
.
if
one
parse
out
ent
,
one
get
a
figure
of
approximately
556
,
assume
that
the
figure
I
have
be
right
up
to
date
.
with
regard
to
gastroenterology
,
breast
surgery
and
general
surgery
,
the
figure
seem
to
be
a
bit
more
manageable
.
further
investigation
be
definitely
need
into
why
the
vast
bulk
of
that
on
the
list
be
associate
with
ophthalmology
,
for
instance
.
we
must
determine
where
the
lag
be
in
this
regard
.
I
assume
the
administrator
in
the
HSE
and
hospital
group
be
watch
this
debate
.
I
do
know
that
they
tune
into
this
debate
.
I
would
be
very
surprised
if
they
be
not
in
a
position
to
provide
the
deputy
with
a
actual
breakdown
of
the
figure
and
where
the
time
lag
be
be
generate
across
the
discipline
.
certainly
,
the
matter
have
now
be
raise
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
could
tell
the
deputy
that
I
will
raise
it
directly
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Varadkar
,
but
the
facility
exist
for
deputy
Aylward
to
do
it
himself
.
the
matter
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
apologise
for
he
absence
.
it
be
significant
that
a
significant
figure
be
attributable
to
one
particular
discipline
.
that
need
to
be
interrogate
closely
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
it
be
raise
during
leader
's
question
by
deputy
Aengus
Ó
Snodaigh
when
the
Tánaiste
and
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
respond
to
he
query
.
I
have
be
supply
with
a
response
on
behalf
of
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
who
be
unavailable
.
I
should
say
at
the
outset
that
it
be
not
inconceivable
that
minister
be
unable
to
take
this
debate
in
the
House
from
time
to
time
.
the
deputy
,
as
a
former
minister
of
State
,
should
-----
I
mention
the
fact
that
this
issue
be
raise
on
the
Order
of
Business
merely
to
make
the
point
that
it
be
a
matter
that
be
before
the
House
already
today
not
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
with
all
due
respect
,
to
make
a
political
point
.
I
be
just
say
it
be
raise
by
Dublin
Deputy
and
be
state
that
for
the
record
.
if
you
will
grant
I
some
leniency
on
time
,
I
agree
absolutely
that
minister
should
be
present
,
but
a
further
charge
be
make
by
the
deputy
in
respect
of
the
relax
or
control
of
building
regulation
.
I
cannot
answer
for
that
charge
as
it
have
be
raise
here
as
a
adjournment
issue
.
perhaps
the
minister
should
answer
that
for
himself
but
,
nonetheless
,
the
charge
be
make
.
I
understand
that
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
have
no
plan
to
evacuate
resident
from
they
home
and
intend
,
rather
,
to
serve
a
enforcement
notice
require
that
a
schedule
of
work
be
carry
out
to
ensure
a
acceptable
level
of
fire
safety
provision
be
achieve
at
the
development
.
I
preface
my
further
remark
by
say
this
be
the
script
I
have
be
give
to
deliver
.
if
some
development
have
take
place
in
the
past
hour
or
so
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
I
be
not
aware
of
that
.
the
issue
which
have
emerge
in
Longboat
Quay
be
a
matter
for
the
Dublin
Docklands
Development
Authority
,
the
receiver
to
the
developer
,
resident
of
Longboat
Quay
and
they
management
company
as
well
as
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
to
resolve
collaboratively
.
I
cannot
answer
for
the
charge
that
have
be
make
by
the
deputy
in
respect
of
the
Dublin
Docklands
Development
Authority
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
understand
that
all
party
be
actively
engage
to
find
a
resolution
to
the
situation
that
have
arise
.
while
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
have
be
proactively
engage
with
all
concerned
for
several
month
it
cannot
wait
indefinitely
for
matter
to
be
resolve
and
have
,
accordingly
,
this
week
signal
its
intention
to
serve
a
enforcement
notice
.
I
do
not
know
if
event
today
have
overtake
that
.
local
authority
have
extensive
power
of
inspection
and
enforcement
under
the
Fire
Safety
Act
1981
,
the
Building
Control
Act
1990
and
the
Planning
and
Development
Act
,
all
of
which
may
be
relevant
in
relation
to
fire
safety
arrangement
in
residential
development
.
compliance
with
the
statutory
requirement
in
regard
to
a
building
be
,
first
and
foremost
,
a
matter
for
the
owner
,
designer
and
builder
concerned
.
a
charge
have
be
make
here
against
the
architect
and
the
designer
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
have
no
function
in
assess
or
check
compliance
,
or
otherwise
,
of
specific
work
or
development
,
nor
can
the
Department
or
the
Minister
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
influence
or
interfere
in
the
handling
of
specific
case
by
local
authority
who
be
at
all
time
independent
in
the
use
of
they
statutory
power
.
the
minister
have
a
role
in
ensure
that
adequate
arrangement
be
in
place
to
avoid
the
recurrence
of
such
problem
elsewhere
.
in
this
regard
a
number
of
legislative
reform
have
be
put
in
place
since
the
Longboat
Quay
development
be
build
which
greatly
strengthen
the
arrangement
in
place
for
the
regulation
and
oversight
of
such
development
.
the
statutory
registration
of
key
construction
professional
under
the
Building
Control
Act
2007
mean
that
such
professional
may
now
be
subject
to
professional
conduct
proceedings
where
instance
of
professional
misconduct
or
poor
professional
performance
arise
-
ultimately
this
may
lead
to
removal
from
the
statutory
register
which
would
affect
the
professional
's
ability
to
earn
they
livelihood
.
Building
control
regulation
be
amend
to
require
on
and
from
1
March
2014
great
accountability
in
regard
to
compliance
with
building
regulation
in
the
form
of
statutory
certification
of
design
and
construction
by
register
construction
professional
and
the
multi
-
unit
Development
Act
2011
further
require
developer
to
supply
a
certificate
of
compliance
with
fire
safety
from
a
register
construction
professional
in
each
such
development
.
it
be
also
worth
note
that
the
minister
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
in
the
interest
of
support
owner
and
resident
live
in
development
where
concern
regard
compliance
with
fire
safety
arise
,
recently
announce
a
review
by
a
independent
fire
safety
expert
to
develop
a
framework
for
general
application
in
such
situation
.
this
review
will
outline
general
advice
and
guidance
which
can
be
use
by
owner
-
resident
and
they
professional
adviser
,
to
ensure
that
a
adequate
level
of
safety
be
in
place
for
person
in
and
about
they
development
.
this
may
include
make
provision
for
appropriate
or
enhance
fire
detection
and
alarm
measure
;
check
that
appropriate
escape
route
from
the
premise
be
available
,
design
in
accordance
with
current
standard
;
and
ensure
evacuation
plan
be
rehearse
in
each
premise
in
the
event
of
a
fire
incident
.
the
review
be
be
overseen
by
a
steering
group
comprise
of
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
and
local
authority
representative
under
the
chair
of
Mr.
Martin
Riordan
,
former
manager
of
Cork
County
Council
.
the
steering
group
will
prepare
its
report
by
31
January
2016
.
may
I
conclude
by
say
I
do
not
want
to
give
political
platitude
to
anybody
.
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
like
and
I
cannot
imagine
what
it
be
like
for
the
resident
of
Longboat
Quay
except
to
say
that
there
be
widespread
sympathy
for
the
plight
in
which
they
find
themselves
at
this
time
.
have
the
deputy
a
suggestion
?
the
point
be
make
.
if
I
interpret
the
deputy
correctly
,
there
be
a
suggestion
that
the
DDDA
should
act
in
respect
of
the
common
area-----
-----
the
entire
development
-
and
that
the
€
2
million
outstanding
should
be
obtain
from
the
ddda
or
,
the
deputy
be
say
,
vicariously
from
the
minister
.
in
other
word
,
effectively
the
government
should
pay
the
€
2
million
.
if
I
interpret
the
deputy
correctly
,
that
be
essentially
what
she
be
suggest
.
for
clarity
and
in
the
interest
of
the
record
of
the
House
,
I
be
not
fully
across
this
issue
but
perhaps
the
deputy
could
clarify
if
that
be
what
she
be
seek
?
so
that
be
the
deputy
's
position
and
that
will
be
refer
to
the
minister
in
question
.
on

of

David
Donoghue
,
and
he
colleague
in
New
York
for
they
wonderful
work
in
achieve
that
agenda
.
we
be
very
conscious
that
we
make
this
commitment
in
the
context
of
progress
under
the
millennium
development
goal
but
we
also
recognise
current
setback
as
a
result
of
the
unprecedented
level
of
humanitarian
cris
and
suffering
across
the
Middle
East
and
Africa
,
which
have
create
the
appalling
refugee
crisis
in
the
Mediterranean
region
.
this
budget
be
a
vitally
important
signal
internationally
that
we
will
reverse
the
slide
in
the
percentage
of
we
GNP
which
we
provide
in
aid
.
we
expect
that
there
will
be
a
small
but
significant
increase
in
the
percentage
,
from
a
estimate
0.35
%
in
2015
to
0.36
%
.
we
know
it
be
modest
but
we
be
commit
to
make
progress
towards
the
UN
target
of
0.7
%
and
to
do
so
in
a
sustainable
and
effective
manner
.
Ireland
play
a
central
role
in
broker
agreement
among
the
EU
development
minister
in
May
to
recommit
to
the
target
and
to
reach
it
,
collectively
,
by
2030
.
I
visit
Jordan
last
week
to
see
for
myself
the
extent
of
the
refugee
crisis
as
a
result
of
the
conflict
in
Syria
.
we
be
fully
aware
of
the
burden
be
borne
by
neighbour
country
,
especially
Jordan
,
Lebanon
and
Syria
.
I
be
move
and
impressed
by
the
generosity
of
the
Jordanian
government
and
its
people
,
even
as
they
economy
be
squeeze
by
instability
and
conflict
on
they
border
,
in
provide
for
they
neighbour
in
they
time
of
need
.
Jordan
,
a
country
the
size
of
Ireland
with
a
population
of
6.3
million
,
many
of
they
refugee
themselves
,
be
now
host
some
1.3
million
Syrian
refugee
in
camp
and
in
the
community
.
the
challenge
for
Jordan
and
for
the
refugee
family
I
meet
be
immense
.
I
be
convinced
that
Ireland
and
we
EU
partner
can
do
more
to
assist
they
.
over
the
past
three
year
,
Ireland
have
provide
over
€300
million
to
address
humanitarian
cris
worldwide
.
this
include
over
€
100
million
for
the
Middle
East
and
the
Horn
of
Africa
,
over
€
40
million
of
which
have
be
for
victim
of
the
Syrian
conflict
.
we
have
not
forget
the
victim
of
other
humanitarian
cris
in
Europe
's
broad
neighbourhood
,
in
South
Sudan
,
Central
African
Republic
and
the
Sahel
.
we
have
also
deploy
we
naval
personnel
to
the
Mediterranean
to
rescue
people
drive
to
attempt
the
crossing
in
unseaworthy
boat
.
with
the
resource
provide
for
ODA
in
2016
,
we
will
do
more
.
I
be
determined
that
we
will
increase
we
direct
humanitarian
funding
for
the
refugee
crisis
,
which
be
a
crisis
for
Europe
also
.
Ireland
can
play
a
lead
role
in
a
comprehensive
European
response
,
address
the
immediate
need
of
the
victim
of
the
crisis
and
its
root
cause
in
poverty
,
underdevelopment
,
conflict
and
climate
change
.
we
will
review
all
aspect
of
we
aid
programme
to
ensure
that
the
Irish
people
's
funding
have
maximum
impact
for
vulnerable
community
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
we
will
use
we
humanitarian
aid
and
we
long
-
term
development
aid
,
especially
in
we
key
partner
country
,
in
a
more
co-ordinate
way
.
we
objective
will
be
to
respond
to
the
immediate
humanitarian
suffering
and
to
build
the
resilience
of
endangered
community
against
future
cris
.
we
will
work
closely
with
we
key
partner
country
,
with
the
Unite
Nation
and
with
we
ngo
to
do
so
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
Irish
ngo
and
we
multilateral
partner
who
be
work
so
hard
in
they
respective
field
to
deliver
on
the
global
development
agenda
.

the
government
be
strongly
commit
to
Ireland
's
overseas
aid
programme
and
to
its
place
at
the
heart
of
we
foreign
policy
.
''
one
World
,
one
Future
''
,
we
policy
for
international
development
,
clearly
articulate
the
government
's
commitment
to
the
UN
target
of
provide
0.7
%
of
GNP
for
official
development
assistance
,
ODA
.
this
commitment
be
reiterate
by
the
Taoiseach
at
the
UN
Summit
in
New
York
in
September
which
adopt
a
new
set
of
sustainable
development
goal
to
guide
international
development
policy
and
action
for
the
next
15
year
.
we
track
record
in
support
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
be
clear
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
protect
and
stabilise
budget
allocation
at
a
time
of
extraordinary
economic
difficulty
.
in
that
time
,
we
have
provide
over
€
3
billion
for
ODA
.
we
have
state
that
we
would
make
progress
towards
the
0.7
%
target
,
once
economic
condition
allow
.
now
,
as
we
economic
recovery
gain
momentum
and
become
more
widely
establish
,
we
can
begin
to
make
good
on
that
commitment
.
on
budget
day
,
the
government
announce
the
first
substantial
increase
in
the
aid
budget
in
over
seven
year
.
for
2016
,
we
have
provide
a
total
of
over
€
640
million
in
ODA
,
a
increase
of
€
40
million
or
almost
7
%
on
the
2015
level
.
we
estimate
this
will
entail
a
small
increase
in
we
oda
-
GNP
percentage
from
a
project
0.35
%
in
2015
to
a
project
0.36
%
in
2016
,
so
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
the
challenge
now
be
to
ensure
Ireland
continue
to
play
a
lead
role
in
the
comprehensive
response
to
the
unprecedented
humanitarian
cris
throughout
the
globe
,
especially
in
Europe
's
broad
neighbourhood
,
while
ensure
we
aid
programme
remain
effective
in
address
the
root
cause
of
poverty
and
hunger
.
we
continue
to
maintain
a
very
strong
relationship
with
the
ngo
,
which
be
partly
fund
by
the
taxpayer
through
Irish
Aid
.
the
issue
the
UN
and
the
multilateral
organisation
be
try
to
grapple
with
at
present
be
the
major
challenge
of
how
,
globally
,
government
be
go
to
be
able
to
fund
the
commitment
into
the
future
.
to
answer
the
deputy
's
question
,
one
of
the
issue
we
be
now
look
at
be
that
of
how
we
manage
the
dynamic
between
long
-
term
development
goal
,
such
as
the
eradication
of
poverty
and
hunger
,
and
the
numerous
humanitarian
cris
that
be
break
out
,
for
example
,
in
the
Mediterranean
,
as
well
as
how
we
manage
the
interoperability
between
long
-
term
development
goal
and
humanitarian
cris
.
there
be
also
the
question
of
how
we
leverage
the
opportunity
within
the
global
private
sector
.
the
private
sector
have
a
role
to
play
and
,
within
the
Department
,
we
be
try
to
get
a
great
degree
of
traction
in
that
relationship
which
go
beyond
mere
corporate
social
responsibility
.
at
the
multilateral
level
,
through
the
UN
and
other
organisation
,
Ireland
have
a
important
role
to
play
.
we
would
openly
encourage
organisation
to
interact
with
each
other
.
we
would
really
like
to
see
a
great
degree
of
consolidation
of
effort
and
we
do
not
want
to
see
any
duplication
of
effort
.
Irish
Aid
have
a
track
record
,
through
its
relationship
with
organisation
like
GOAL
,
of
provide
the
seed
funding
that
then
allow
goal
to
leverage
the
opportunity
,
such
as
in
its
response
in
Syria
.
if
we
can
encourage
a
great
degree
of
that
kind
of
leverage
effort
and
bring
in
the
private
sector
,
as
I
say
,
beyond
mere
corporate
social
responsibility
,
then
I
believe
that
pitch
Ireland
onto
a
great
global
stage
.
we
advocate
that
policy
and
we
be
work
towards
try
to
get
a
great
degree
of
traction
in
that
regard
.
I
thank
the
Tánaiste
for
share
she
time
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
will
set
out
to
the
House
the
development
regard
the
all
-
party
talk
in
Belfast
in
which
he
and
I
have
be
involve
over
the
past
several
week
.
beyond
the
talk
,
the
work
to
deliver
a
reconcile
and
peaceful
Northern
Ireland
as
part
of
a
prosperous
and
inclusive
island
of
Ireland
continue
every
day
across
government
.
nowhere
be
this
more
evident
than
in
we
work
to
promote
and
develop
North
-
South
co-operation
.
through
this
work
,
we
be
build
the
lasting
relationship
between
North
and
South
which
will
help
to
copperfasten
peace
and
stability
and
deliver
prosperity
for
all
we
people
.
the
success
of
North
-
South
body
like
Tourism
Ireland
and
InterTradeIreland
demonstrate
what
can
be
achieve
when
we
pool
we
resource
in
key
strategic
area
.
Building
on
this
success
be
now
we
focus
.
in
line
with
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
a
report
on
new
economically
-
focus
priority
be
bring
to
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
this
year
.
priority
area
of
co-operation
for
the
government
include
high
level
education
,
agri-food
,
energy
,
climate
change
,
creative
industry
,
sport
and
other
joint
initiative
.
the
overarching
aim
be
to
ensure
the
most
effective
use
of
scarce
public
fund
on
both
side
of
the
border
to
promote
economic
growth
and
create
job
in
all
we
community
.
the
government
's
commitment
to
North
-
South
economic
co-operation
therefore
remain
a
priority
.
as
the
Taoiseach
have
state
,
the
recently
announce
infrastructure
and
capital
investment
plan
have
a
dedicated
section
on
North
-
South
infrastructure
.
in
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
the
government
agree
to
a
financial
package
to
support
North
-
South
work
programme
as
well
as
measure
to
promote
reconciliation
and
INTERREG
programme
,
include
the
concept
of
the
Narrow
Water
Bridge
project
and
develop
the
Ulster
canal
.
in
this
agreement
,
we
also
reaffirm
we
commitment
to
provide
£
25
million
in
2015
and
2016
to
the
A5
project
.
this
be
the
source
of
some
discussion
in
Stormont
as
late
as
yesterday
.
research
and
innovation
,
one
of
the
key
driver
of
economic
growth
and
employment
,
have
be
a
key
area
for
North
-
South
co-operation
.
for
instance
,
the
development
of
the
North
West
Regional
Science
Park
,
co-locate
in
Derry
and
Letterkenny
,
have
deliver
new
hub
for
the
development
of
innovative
business
,
create
job
and
strengthen
the
cross-border
link
which
be
so
vital
to
the
economic
development
of
the
Border
region
.
there
have
be
very
good
progress
to
date
in
term
of
North
-
South
collaboration
under
the
EU'
€
80
billion
research
and
innovation
Horizon
2020
programme
,
which
be
negotiate
during
the
Irish
Presidency
.
the
first
year
have
deliver
over
€
19
million
of
EU
funding
to
support
North
-
South
project
.
we
need
now
to
build
on
the
excellent
collaborative
progress
to
date
and
to
work
on
we
allied
strength
in
area
such
as
ICT
,
health
and
agri-food
research
to
create
and
deliver
more
successful
partnership
project
.
the
expansion
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
remit
to
fund
researcher
in
the
North
will
enable
further
work
together
on
a
all
-
island
basis
and
will
create
a
further
leverage
opportunity
.
North
-
South
co-operation
also
bring
real
day
-
to
-
day
benefit
to
people
on
both
side
of
the
Border
.
for
example
,
when
open
next
summer
,
the
£
50
million
radiotherapy
unit
at
Derry
's
Altnagelvin
Hospital
will
provide
access
to
radiotherapy
service
to
over
a
half
million
people
across
the
north
-
west
region
,
share
service
and
maximise
limited
resource
.
this
co-operation
also
extend
to
the
field
of
sport
.
as
one
rugby
World
Cup
end
,
we
look
forward
to
2023
when
,
hopefully
,
Ireland
will
be
host
this
great
tournament
on
a
all
-
island
basis
.
this
joint
North
-
South
bid
have
tremendous
potential
to
drive
tourism
.
speak
personally
,
I
be
hopeful
that
all
of
the
stadia
will
be
ready
when
the
time
come
.
I
refer
to
Páirc
Uí
Chaoimh
in
that
respect
.
it
be
clear
that
North
-
South
co-operation
be
crucial
and
indeed
a
central
plank
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
.
I
hope
we
continue
to
fulfil
we
obligation
both
North
and
South
in
respect
of
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
.
I
welcome
the
announcement
by
the
Taoiseach
of
a
date
for
Armagh
.
it
be
important
all
political
persuasion
would
sign
up
to
that
and
that
the
executive
in
all
its
form
would
ensure
that
we
continue
to
give
that
the
energy
it
deserve
.
the
current
political
difficulty
should
not
get
in
the
way
of
vitally
important
North
-
South
co-operation
.
now
that
DUP
minister
have
return
to
they
desk
in
Stormont
,
I
hope
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
can
resume
its
work
,
which
have
deliver
so
much
benefit
for
citizen
across
the
island
.
whatever
the
difficulty
,
this
government
will
continue
to
work
to
support
North
-
South
cooperation
and
to
help
unlock
the
full
potential
of
the
island
society
and
economy
.
it
be
the
death
of
Jonathan
Corrie
that
bring
the
issue
of
housing
and
homelessness
onto
the
Dáil
agenda
in
a
stark
way
.
it
be
alarming
and
disturbing
that
it
take
another
terrible
tragedy
at
Carrickmines
,
for
the
Lynch
,
Gilbert
and
Connors
family
and
for
the
wide
Traveller
community
,
to
bring
about
a
debate
on
Traveller
issue
in
the
dáil
.
we
be
aware
of
the
statistic
which
show
the
inequality
experience
by
member
of
the
Traveller
community
in
term
of
life
expectancy
,
illness
,
rate
of
suicide
and
infant
mortality
.
we
be
also
aware
of
the
inequality
in
education
.
in
that
regard
,
I
ask
Traveller
parent
to
be
more
proactive
and
supportive
of
they
child
continue
in
school
beyond
leave
certificate
into
third
level
education
.
in
the
secondary
school
where
I
teach
,
too
often
I
see
very
bright
Traveller
girl
leave
school
at
the
end
of
first
year
.
we
have
become
complacent
with
regard
to
traveller
.
Successive
government
and
Irish
society
have
ignore
the
glaring
inequality
that
persist
.
what
be
common
at
the
briefing
today
from
the
Traveller
's
rights
activist
be
the
total
alienation
they
feel
when
they
enter
Leinster
House
.
Leinster
House
have
not
respect
they
culture
,
history
or
ethnicity
.
Irish
people
be
against
racism
and
discrimination
.
we
have
a
strong
voice
with
regard
to
human
rights
.
Ireland
be
a
member
of
the
Unite
Nation
human
Right
Council
.
we
believe
we
have
a
social
conscience
,
but
too
often
that
stop
when
it
come
to
traveller
.
the
academic
research
on
Traveller
over
recent
decade
support
the
case
for
recognition
of
they
ethnicity
,
which
be
support
by
the
majority
of
Traveller
.
accept
they
ethnicity
be
simply
respect
difference
and
diversity
.
if
what
have
happen
in
Carrickmines
and
its
aftermath
have
occur
in
another
country
,
we
would
have
be
horrify
.
while
there
be
great
support
and
sympathy
from
Irish
people
,
there
be
not
the
same
sense
of
outrage
and
horror
that
we
would
express
if
it
have
occur
somewhere
else

on
a
point
of
order
,
and
I
be
not
make
a
political
point
here
,
I
be
conscious
of
how
much
time
be
leave
on
the
clock
in
this
debate
and
I
be
anxious
to
be
able
to
contribute
.
we
have
time
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
statement
so
far
.
I
have
listen
with
interest
to
the
debate
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
agreement
be
entitle
a
Fresh
start
.
the
agreement
be
not
a
final
destination
but
represent
a
step
forward
towards
normalise
politics
and
society
in
Northern
Ireland
.
I
share
the
articulation
of
the
disappointment
on
the
issue
around
legacy
.
as
a
result
of
where
I
be
and
where
my
generation
be
in
relation
to
the
legacy
issue
,
we
bear
a
certain
responsibility
for
deal
with
the
past
.
be
it
go
to
take
another
generation
,
or
a
generation
beyond
that
?
when
I
look
at
the
pupil
and
student
who
be
here
as
visitor
today
,
I
wonder
whether
we
will
have
to
wait
for
someone
of
they
generation
to
finally
crack
the
legacy
issue
and
to
deal
with
the
past
.
Successive
Irish
government
,
regardless
of
they
political
persuasion
,
have
seek
to
lean
in
towards
the
British
government
on
this
issue
in
a
forceful
and
genuine
manner
.
if
we
be
go
to
talk
about
it
in
a
rhetorical
way
,
it
be
important
for
all
of
we
-
from
a
party
political
point
of
view
-
to
be
honest
with
each
other
about
just
what
that
will
mean
in
real
term
.
it
will
involve
the
British
Government
and
people
from
other
party
political
perspective
open
up
the
closet
and
see
where
the
skeleton
be
,
and
if
we
be
honest
with
ourselves
,
we
will
admit
that
it
be
incumbent
on
we
all
to
look
deeply
at
just
what
the
issue
of
disclosure
and
national
security
mean
.
be
they
use
as
mere
word
to
protect
entity
against
the
let
in
of
the
light
?
there
have
be
much
mention
in
this
chamber
of
the
campaign
that
be
be
run
by
U2
.
it
would
appear
that
many
member
of
this
House
have
be
at
the
U2
concert
that
have
take
place
in
recent
day
,
at
which
there
have
be
a
particular
articulation
in
relation
to
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
.
I
can
say
in
good
stead
with
a
degree
of
integrity
that
this
and
previous
government
have
consistently
seek
to
ensure
the
mandate
give
by
this
House
on
the
issue
of
disclosure
in
this
regard
be
fulfil
.
we
will
continue
to
do
that
.
the
agreement
be
incomplete
if
we
always
have
to
come
back
to
the
legacy
issue
and
the
need
to
deal
with
the
past
.
it
seem
to
be
a
iterative
process
on
this
island
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
ageist
when
I
say
that
my
generation
fail
to
understand
why
this
issue
cannot
be
surmount
.
we
need
to
deal
with
they
assuredly
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
speak
for
the
victim
.
if
we
can
get
beyond
this
issue
,
we
can
achieve
a
great
degree
of
transparency
.
when
I
talk
to
ordinary
citizen
in
the
six
County
of
the
North
,
it
do
not
appear
to
I
that
they
be
as
engage
as
they
might
be
with
the
issue
at
Stormont
.
the
constant
cry
I
hear
from
ordinary
people
of
all
persuasion
be
"
they
need
to
get
on
with
it
up
on
the
hill
"
.
that
be
what
people
seem
to
want
.
they
want
normal
,
normative
politics
and
a
real
economy
.
every
government
need
to
move
towards
assist
and
facilitate
that
,
and
cajole
for
it
,
in
every
possible
way
.
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
I
can
say
we
have
make
a
real
commitment
in
the
form
of
the
additional
£
25
million
that
be
be
provide
for
the
A5
project
.
it
be
important
that
we
unlock
the
potential
of
the
north
west
of
this
island
.
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
a
disparity
in
growth
and
economic
prosperity
between
the
region
to
the
east
and
the
west
of
the
River
Bann
.
we
need
to
do
more
to
unlock
the
potential
of
the
north
west
,
particularly
the
Donegal
-
Derry
region
.
that
be
what
we
be
work
towards
.
as
a
minister
of
State
with
a
economic
Ministry
,
it
be
no
harm
for
I
to
say
on
the
record
of
this
House
that
my
colleague
and
I
recently
visit
the
Bombardier
facility
in
Belfast
.
two
company
from
the
South
of
Ireland
-
Dawnlough
from
Galway
and
Takumi
from
Limerick
-
be
sub-
supply
part
and
component
for
the
aerospace
and
aeronautical
industry
into
Bombardier
.
that
be
the
island
or
the
Ireland
that
I
want
to
see
.
I
want
big
company
like
Bombardier
,
which
be
a
significant
player
in
the
global
aerospace
industry
,
to
source
they
material
from
as
near
as
possible
,
and
preferably
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
such
a
approach
will
sustain
job
in
the
North
and
the
South
,
sustain
a
real
economy
and
really
knit
the
two
part
of
this
island
together
in
the
way
that
need
to
happen
.
it
will
allow
we
to
move
beyond
some
of
the
empty
rhetoric
that
be
sometimes
employ
when
we
talk
about
the
North
,
the
South
or
North
-
South
co-operation
.
as
I
have
say
,
we
feel
that
this
be
a
iterative
process
.
we
feel
strongly
that
the
legacy
issue
remain
outstanding
.
we
feel
a
obligation
to
the
family
,
the
victim
and
that
people
who
want
to
deal
with
the
past
in
a
transparent
way
.
we
will
continue
to
feel
that
way
and
I
believe
that
who
step
into
the
breach
long
after
people
like
I
cease
to
inhabit
position
of
this
nature
will
continue
to
do
so
.
at
what
point
do
we
ask
ourselves
certain
question
?
do
a
certain
number
of
generation
have
to
pass
while
people
seek
justice
before
this
matter
be
forget
and
write
out
of
history
?
at
what
point
in
the
next
number
of
year
can
we
get
beyond
this
issue
or
deal
with
it
in
a
substantive
way
?
as
long
as
it
be
not
deal
with
,
it
will
continue
to
cast
a
shadow
over
everything
we
be
do
to
try
to
bring
about
the
normalisation
of
society
and
,
as
have
be
say
here
,
move
towards
a
society
that
be
beyond
conflict
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
first
Minister
,
Peter
Robinson
,
and
the
deputy
first
Minister
,
Martin
McGuinness
.
I
want
to
say
in
a
personal
way
that
they
be
tough
negotiator
and
formidable
politician
.
I
would
say
that
when
it
come
to
hammer
out
a
deal
on
real
economy
,
the
restoration
of
normal
politics
and
the
restoration
of
the
institution
,
they
have
the
good
interest
of
the
people
of
the
North
at
heart
.
there
be
still
many
flaw
and
issue
that
need
to
be
deal
with
,
however
.
I
be
not
go
to
critique
people
in
another
part
of
this
island
,
in
the
context
of
my
vision
for
a
great
degree
of
traction
on
the
issue
that
be
still
outstanding
,
other
than
to
say
that
this
deal
offer
the
potential
for
realpolitik
to
reign
supreme
within
the
Stormont
institution
.
it
have
to
be
record
for
historical
purpose
-
I
be
think
of
the
future
historian
who
will
parse
through
this
debate
-
that
the
issue
of
welfare
legislation
will
now
pass
to
Westminster
for
this
period
.
that
be
a
fact
.
I
will
conclude
by
respond
to
that
who
have
speak
about
sister
party
.
I
have
never
witness
a
debate
that
feature
so
many
reference
to
Westminster
,
George
Osborne
and
the
Tories
.
to
be
honest
,
maybe
it
be
time
for
we
to
look
at
the
abstentionist
policy
.
maybe
there
be
a
forum
-----
this
be
Dáil

.
person
have
receive
a
mandate
for
Westminster
.
I
be
be
honest
about
this
.
the
deputy
can
criticise
I
all
they
like
.
I
be
not
say
that
people
need
to
take
they
seat
.
I
be
say
that
there
be
a
debate
to
be
have
in
London
as
well
.
we
need
to
be
honest
about
where
we
be
go
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,

and

the

have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the

in
which
the

conduct

I

that

this

there
must
be
political

.
I
have
meet
representative
of

over
the

of

,
include
a
senior

the
Irish

,
last

,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit

Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite

I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as

of

recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from

and
the
Labour

remind
he
of
the

.
in
the

there
be
50000

-
make

my

and
I
will
remind

as
I

,
it
be

to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's

.
it
will
stand

in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this

.
this
time
last

,
it
make
a

a

4

over
five

,
whereby
there
would
be
7500

the
country
this

,
4000
of
which
would

.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per

.
my
county
must
have
be
the

because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over

the
credit

movement
have
at
its

investment
capacity
in
this

for
local

and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be

by
some

-
of

the

as
we

it
be
much

it

I

and
I
speak
to

as
well

it

that
this

as

,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent

,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a

,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the

,
and
with

from

and
the

remind
he
of
the

.
in

my

as
I

early
,
it
be

to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in

union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40

.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's

.
it

25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
the
deputy
be
display
a
nasty
streak
today
.
that
be
a
nasty
streak
come
out
.
it
be
unbecoming
of
the
deputy
.
it
be
be
deliver
.

I
thank
the
deputy
for
the
question
.
the
current
El
Niño
weather
event
be
one
of
the
strong
ever
measure
.
more
unpredictable
weather
condition
be
already

a
detrimental
effect
on
people
's
life
and
livelihood
across
Africa
,
particularly
in
the
Horn
of
Africa
and
the
great
Lake
region
.
in
the
next
six
month
humanitarian
need
will
increase
,
with
severe
drought
and
flooding
.
below
normal
rainfall
and
drought
condition
have
already
affect
part
of
Ethiopia
,
Sudan
,
Djibouti
and
Eritrea
,
reduce
agricultural
production
.
Excessive
rainfall
be
affect
part
of
Ethiopia
,
Somalia
and
other
country
,
cause
severe
and
sustain
flooding
,
loss
of
livelihood
and
disease
outbreak
.
Irish
Aid
,
the
government
's
overseas
development
assistance
programme
,
be
step
up
its
preparedness
to
respond
.
we
long
-
term
development
programme
in
country
such
as
Ethiopia
include
funding
for
a
large
social
protection
programme
for
the
most
vulnerable
household
.
we
be
also
scaling
up
humanitarian
response
to
reduce
the
impact
on
household
and
save
life
in
the
bad
affect
place
.
in
Ethiopia
alone
in
2015
,
Ireland
have
increase
its
bilateral
programme
to
nearly
€
28
million
in
response
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
.
we
be
provide
a
additional
€
1.8
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
through
non-governmental
organisation
,
ngo
,
partner
.
in
total
,
Ireland
have
provide
over
€
80
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
in
2015
and
this
budget
will
be
increase
to
over
€
100
million
for
2016
.
we
be
allocate
additional
resource
across
affect
country
to
support
programme
which
save
life
,
improve
food
security
,
protect
livelihood
and
build
the
resilience
of
people
to
withstand
the
effect
of
such
a
weather
event
across
Africa
.
we
will
continue
to
monitor
the
position
closely
and
scale
up
action
as
El
Niño
strengthen
and
condition
on
the
ground
wear
.
Ireland
's
bilateral
relationship
with
Ethiopia
be
very
strong
.
official
Ethiopian
government
figure
for
January
2016
indicate
that
10.2
million
people
will
require
food
assistance
,
in
addition
to
the
7.9
million
receive
food
and
cash
transfer
as
part
of
the
productive
safety
net
programme
.
Ireland
be
one
of
the
core
funder
of
the
programme
through
Irish
Aid
and
the
embassy
.
we
have
be
do
this
since
2005
.
there
be
financial
resource
require
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
this
be
the
third
large
humanitarian
emergency
globally
,
behind
that
in
Syria
and
Yemen
.
it
be
estimate
that
approximately
US
$
1.8
billion
be
require
to
cover
the
cost
of
emergency
intervention
.
we
will
continue
to
work
with
multilateral
partner
such
as
the
UN
agency
and
on
a
bilateral
basis
.
we
have
increase
the
commitment
to
Ethiopia
because
this
involve
protect
small
stakeholder
farmer
and
they
family
.
there
be
knock
-
on
consequence
in
term
of
in
utero
development
which
be
have
a
major
effect
on
malnutrition
and
under-nutrition
.
we
will
continue
to
monitor
the
position
.
there
be
due
to
be
a
meeting
of
development
minister
in
January
.
I
be
not
entirely
sure
if
it
be
raise
in
December
,
but
I
will
check
for
the
deputy
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
in
we
response
to
the
crisis
in
Ethiopia
we
be
punch
above
we
weight
.
through
the
bilateral
aid
programme
we
have
provide
€
3.8
million
to
help
meet
the
immediate
humanitarian
need

the
Tigray
region
two
week
ago
when
he
be
in
Ireland
and
I
have
visit
the

several
occasion
.
we
see
this
as
a
major
humanitarian
crisis
and
the
Irish
response
to
it
be
measure
up
.
we
be
work
hand

tripe
.
I
never
say
that
.
I
be
take
this
topical
issue
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Paschal
Donohoe
,
who
apologis
for
be
unable
to
attend
this
afternoon
.
the
Exchequer
provide
funding
support
to
the
four
regional
airport
in
Donegal
,
Kerry
,
Waterford
and
Knock
under
the
regional
airport
programme
operate
by
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
.
over
the
past
decade
,
Knock
have
receive
almost
€
21
million
in
Exchequer
support
in
operational
and
capital
grant
under
the
OPEX
and
Capex
funding
scheme
administer
by
the
Department
.
in
August
last
year
,
the
European
Commission
give
its
approval
for
the
Department
's
new
regional
airport
programme
,
which
take
account
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Knock
study
group
and
the
subsequent
decision
by
government
to
continue
funding
support
to
the
four
regional
airport
.
that
decision
recognise
that
the
regional
airport
should
be
give
the
opportunity
beyond
2014
to
grow
to
a
viable
,
self
-
sustain
position
,
particularly
consider
the
contribution
that
they
make
to
they
respective
regional
and
local
economy
.
this
be
also
acknowledge
in
the
new
national
aviation
policy
that
be
publish
last
August
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
,
under
new
EU
state
aid
guideline
of
2014
,
the
maximum
level
of
aid
permissible
for
capital
project
at
airport
with
few
than
1
million
passenger
per
annum
be
75
%
.
the
EU
guideline
recognise
,
however
,
that
airport
in
this
category
may
face
difficulty
in
sourcing
the
balance
of
at
least
25
%
.
subject
to
a
case
-
by
-
case
assessment
,
a
aid
rate
in
excess
of
75
%
may
be
justify
in
exceptional
circumstance
.
in
such
a
scenario
,
the
commission
have
indicate
that
a
business
case
justify
any

last
year
,
under
the
first
year
of
the
new
programme
,
Knock
receive
almost
€
1.2
million
in
grant
support
from
the
Department
and
the
latter
have
already
begin
engage
again
with
all
four
airport
on
they
future
requirement
for
capital
grant
assistance
.
the
minister
be
,
of
course
,
aware
that
Knock
have
indicate
that
it
will
require
a
high
grant
rate
than
the
maximum
75
%
permit
under
the
EU
guideline
for
certain
major
capital
project
that
be
plan
at
the
airport
over
the
come
year
.
the
ongoing
engagement
with
Knock
continue
to
address
this
issue
,
as
well
as
the
funding
available
to
the
airport
under
the
new
ppr
scheme
.
I
note
the
point
the
deputy
have
make
.
I
do
not
have
a
answer
to
that
question
,
but
I
be
sure
departmental
official
and
the
minister
's
staff
be
watch
proceedings
and
I
be
sure
the
deputy
will
approach
the
minister
directly
on
this
issue
.
for
the
purpose
of
reply
,
I
will
reiterate
that
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
case
of
rule
out
the
possibility
of
90
%
funding
.
I
do
not
think
that
be
explicitly
state
in
the
answer
I
give
.
I
will
read
again
from
the
answer
:
the
minister
be
,
of
course
,
aware
that
Knock
have
indicate
that
it
will
require
a
high
grant
rate
than
the
maximum
75
%
permit
under
the
EU
guideline
for
certain
major
capital
project
that
be
plan
at
the
airport
over
the
come
year
.
the
ongoing
engagement
with
Knock
continue
to
address
this
issue
,
as
well
as
the
funding
available
to
the
airport
under
the
new
ppr
scheme
.
in
my
interpretation
of
the
answer
,
that
do
not
necessarily
rule
out
the
possibility
of
the
potential
for
90
%
funding
.
I
do
not
have
a-----
I
be
take
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Paschal
Donohoe
.
I
understand
that
deputy
Dowds
have
be
very
proactive
on
this
issue
for
quite
some
time
and
I
thank
he
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
understand
that
the
background
to
this
issue
arise
from
the
concern
of
local
resident
live
in
the
immediate
area
in
relation
to
the
use
of
surround
residential
road
by
heavy
goods
vehicle
and
they
wish
to
see
a
3.5
tonne
vehicle
weight
restriction
apply
to
Kennelsfort
Road
for
traffic
management
purpose
.
while
I
cannot
comment
on
the
specifics
of
any
weight
restriction
currently
apply
to
the
Kennelsfort
Road
,
decision
in
respect
of
the
application
of
such
weight
restriction
be
entirely
a
matter
for
the
relevant
local
authority
.
in
this
instance
,
and
base
on
the
intervention
of
deputy
Dowds
,
that
would
appear
to
be
South
Dublin
County
Council
,
though
my
script
state
it
be
Dublin
City
Council
.
the
minister
do
not
have
any
role
to
play
in
such
decision
.
however
,
should
South
Dublin
County
Council
decide
to
apply
such
a
weight
restriction
on
Kennelsfort
Road
,
this
would
be
indicate
by
the
use
of
the
appropriate
vehicle
weight
limit
sign
.
the
legislative
basis
underpin
the
erection
of
such
regulatory
signage
be
provide
for
under
road
traffic
legislation
with
which
all
local
authority
must
comply
.
also
,
further
detail
relate
to
regulatory
vehicle
weight
signage
be
set
out
for
local
authority

apply
to

include

,
which

any
decision
by
a
local
authority
to
apply
such
restriction
would
have
to
take
account
of
whether
the
road
in
question
be
use
as
part
of

bus
route
.
in
conclusion
,
individual
local
authority
be
well
place
to
assess
the
particular
local
vehicle
weight
requirement
,
base
on
either
road
safety
or
traffic
management
grounds
,
which
should
apply
to
a
particular
individual
road
.
however
,
as
previously
mention
,
if
such
weight
limit
control
be
apply
,
local
authority
must
erect
signage
that
be
in
full
compliance
with
regulation
.
the
enforcement
of
road
traffic
regulation
govern
vehicle
weight
limit
on
any
particular
public
road
be
a
matter
for
a
Garda
Síochána
.
how
do
I
respond
with
a
negative
after
that
?
the
deputy
have
raise
some
question
which
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
will
endeavour
to
speak
directly
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
about
the
specific
question
pose
.
I
hope
official
in
the
minister
's
Department
be
listen
to
this
and
that
they
will
reply
directly
to
the
deputy
.
however
,
I
assure
the
deputy
that
I
will
raise
this
directly
with
the
minister
,
who
be
currently
in
the
Seanad
deal
with
the
Road
Traffic
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
the
great
work
of
deputy
Dowds
and
the
fastidious
and
meticulous
way
in
which
he
have
always
deal
with
issue
relate
to
he
constituent
.
we
all
hope
we
will
be
back
in
the
House
.
deputy
Dowds
have
make
a
outstanding
contribution
to
this
House
and
to
the
Parliamentary
Labour
Party
.
we
wish
he
the
good
on
he
next
path
in
life
,
whatever
pathway
that
be
.
I
have
already
say
this
.
I
have
examine
the
situation
around
the
country
and
be
shocked
by
what
I
find
.
what
I
be
say
be
nothing
new
.
there
have
be
a
60
%
increase
in
Waterford
,
where
up
to
504
people
be
homeless
.
last
week
I
make
the
point
on

station
that
37

there
be
a

that

everything

the

we

export

,
leave
this

particularly
concerned
about
a
UK
exit
from
the
European

.
this
be
not
the
only
industry
that
have
concern
.
Successive
study
have
show
that
a
UK
departure
from
the
EU
will
have
a
adverse
impact
across
the
economy
,
both
in
the
UK
and
in
Ireland
.
we
have
already
hear
today
that
the
British
Treasury
state
early
this
week
that
the
UK
economy
will
be
"
permanently
poorer
"
in
any
scenario
where
it
leave
the
EU
.
anything
that
negatively
impact
on
the
level
of
trade
between
we
two
country
be
not
to
be
welcome
.
while
this
decision
be
for
the
people
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
a
vote
to
leave
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
we
here
in
Ireland
.
the
position
of
the
Irish
government
be
clear
:
we
want
the
UK
to
remain
part
of
the
EU
for
three
main
reason
,
namely
,
the
clear
economic
business
case
which
favour
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
;
we
share
interest
in
sustain
stability
and
prosperity
in
Northern
Ireland
;
and
the
need
to
retain
the
UK
as
a
important
ally
in
the
EU
.
the
third
point
have
be
acknowledge
by
Member
across
this
House
today
during
this
debate
.
entirely
understandably
,
a
focus
of
many
intervention
in
this
debate
have
be
on
Ireland
's
preparedness
for
the
possibility
of
a
UK
decision
to
leave
the
EU
.
government
colleague
have
speak
on
this
issue
throughout
the
day
,
but
I
believe
it
be
useful
to
set
out
we
approach
.
if
the
vote
be
to
leave
the
EU
,
a
period
of
two
year
be
provide
for
under
the
EU
treaty
,
during
which
the
UK
's
exit
term
would
be
negotiate
.
although
negotiation
could
well
take
significantly
long
,
any
extension
would
need
to
be
agree
unanimously
by
the
remain
27
EU
member
state
.
Ireland
will
,
of
course
,
play
its
full
part
in
such
negotiation
.
the
Irish
government
will
continue
to
plan
for
any
contingency
so
that
we
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
potential
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
UK
vote
to
leave
.
a
eventual
agreement
between
the
UK
and
the
EU
,
as
well
as
anything
possible
to
be
agree
between
ourselves
and
the
UK
,
use
the
bilateral
structure
the
Taoiseach
outline
at
the
outset
of
this
debate
,
would
determine
a
overall
framework
and
set
out
the
arrangement
across
many
sector
.
we
hope
that
on
24
June
,
we
will
be
welcoming
a
vote
to
remain
.
if
this
be
not
the
choice
of
the
UK
electorate
,
then
we
will
be
as
prepared
as
possible
across
all
of
government
to
manage
the
consequence
and
deal
with
the
uncertainty
that
arise
.
whatever
the
outcome
,
we
will
maintain
strong
,
positive
and
productive
relationship
with
both
the
EU
,
of
which
we
will
remain
a
member
state
as
well
as
remain
in
the
euro
,
and
with
the
UK
.
nine
week
remain
to
polling
day
.
I
urge
all
of
that
with
family
and
friend
live
in
the
UK
to
encourage
they
to
register
to
vote
,
to
remind
they
of
the
unique
perspective
Ireland
have
on
this
debate
,
and
to
ask
they
to
cast
they
vote
on
23
June
,
when
voter
turnout
may
be
the
decide
factor
in
this
hugely
important
referendum
.
I
have
follow
today

great

government
colleague
have
speak
on
this
issue
throughout
the
day
,
but
I
believe
it
be
useful
to
set
out
we
approach
.
if
the
vote
be
to
leave
the
EU
,
a
period
of
two
year
be
provide
for
under
the
EU
treaty
,
during
which
the
UK
's
exit
term
would
be
negotiate
.
although
negotiation
could
well
take
significantly
long
,
any
extension
would
need
to
be
agree
unanimously
by
the
remain
27
EU
member
state
.
Ireland
will
,
of
course
,
play
its
full
part
in
such
negotiation
.
the
Irish
government
will
continue
to
plan
for
any
contingency
so
that
we
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
potential
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
UK
vote
to
leave
.
a
eventual
agreement
between
the
UK
and
the
EU
,
as
well
as
anything
possible
to
be
agree
between
ourselves
and
the
UK
,
use
the
bilateral
structure
the
Taoiseach
outline
at
the
outset
of
this
debate
,
would
determine
a
overall
framework
and
set
out
the
arrangement
across
many
sector
.
we
hope
that
on
24
June
,
we
will
be
welcoming
a
vote
to
remain
.
if
this
be
not
the
choice
of
the
UK
electorate
,
then
we
will
be
as
prepared
as
possible
across
all
of
government
to
manage
the
consequence
and
deal
with
the
uncertainty
that
arise
.
whatever
the
outcome
,
we
will
maintain
strong
,
positive
and
productive
relationship
with
both
the
EU
,
of
which
we
will
remain
a
member
state
as
well
as
remain
in
the
euro
,
and
with
the
UK
.
nine
week
remain
to
polling
day
.
I
urge
all
of
that
with
family
and
friend
live
in
the
UK
to
encourage
they
to
register
to
vote
,
to
remind
they
of
the
unique
perspective
Ireland
have
on
this
debate
,
and
to
ask
they
to
cast
they
vote
on
23
June
,
when
voter
turnout
may
be
the
decide
factor
in
this
hugely
important
referendum
.
one
more
second
.
do
not
be
so
partisan
on
this
.
I
be
not
expect
to
get
the
opportunity
to
speak
so
I
appreciate
that
the
Ceann
Comhairle
have
fit
I
in
.
we
have
all
speak
about
Irish
Water
in
the
House
today
and
have
all
highlight
the
concern
and
issue
relate
to
it
.
deputy
present
be
very
familiar
with
my
constituency
,
the
Acting
Chairman
and
I
represent
it
.
they
will
also
be
aware
of
the
same
concern
relate
to
the
establishment
of
Irish
Water
,
the
way
it
be
do
and
whether
there
be
a
need
for
it
.
most
people
accept
that
it
be
unnecessary
at
the
time
and
that
local
authority
be
do
a
good
job
and
provide
the
service
.
the
one
resource
that
they
have
be
miss
over
the
last
number
of
year
by
successive
government
be
,
perhaps
,
funding
.
there
be
different
reason
for
this
,
be
they
economic
or
whatever
they
be
at
the
time
,
but
local
authority
in
general
,
whether
water
or
waste
water
management
,
do
a
good
job
,
deliver
the
service
and
improve
the
infrastructure
.
as
we
all
know
,
if
there
be
a
issue
with
a
person
's
water
service
or
waste
water
service
and
he
or
she
ring
Irish
Water
,
it
ring
the
local
authority
.
they
employ
the
same
staff
who
be
there
before
Irish
Water
be
set
up
to
go
out
,
assess
the
problem
and
contact
Irish
Water
about
the
issue
.
Irish
water
then
issue
they
a
purchase
order
or
order
number
to
go
out
and
carry
out
the
work
.
this
be
a
completely
inefficient
way
of
do
business
because
another
completely
unnecessary
layer
of
bureaucracy
be
be
introduce
.
the
local
authority
staff
,
who
have
the
local
expertise
,
carry
out
the
work
to
a
high
standard
and
deliver
a
excellent
service
all
across
my
constituency
and
the
country
generally
,
be
still
do
the
work
,
but
they
be
now
do
it
under
a
new
management
regime
of
Irish
Water
.
everyone
would
accept
that
this
be
unnecessary
,
and
it
be
do
with
a
extra
capital
cost
that
be
not
need
previously
for
the
staff
.
indeed
,
we
now
learn
that
they
be
subsidise
somewhere
in
the
region
of
€
2500000000
per
annum
out
of
we
motor
tax
money
.
that
money
should
be
go
into
upgrade
the
infrastructure
that
we
all
need
for
road
,
commute
and
open
up
other
way
for
industry
around
the
country
,
where
it
would
be
much
well
spend
rather
than
spend
subsidise
a
agency
that
be
not
require
at
this
time
or
at
any
stage
.
I
be
not
in
favour
of
have
water
charge
currently
or
at
any
stage
.
they
need
to
be
suspend
.
we
also
need
to
look
at
a
waiver
system
,
which
should
have
be
consider
and
implement
for
that
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
.
there
be
many
people
,
whom
we
all
meet
at
we
clinic
every
week
and
whom
we
have
meet
canvass
,
who
simply
cannot
afford
to
pay
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
I
propose
to
outline
the
response
of
the
government
,
through
Irish
Aid
,
to
the
crisis
in
Syria
.
I
be
pleased
to
have
have
the
privilege
of
lead
Irish
Aid
's
response
in
the
past
two
year
,
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
development
and
trade
.
next
month
the
first
ever
world
humanitarian
summit
will
be
hold
in
Istanbul
.
it
be
call
by
the
Unite
Nation
Secretary
General
.
the
summit'
host
country
,
Turkey
,
have
also
become
host
to
the
world
's
large
refugee
population
in
the
past
five
year
,
with
more
than
2.7
million
Syrian
refugee
live
in
the
country
.
as
the
refugee
crisis
have
unfold
in
the
Middle
East
,
the
government
have
be
respond
,
on
behalf
of
the
Irish
people
,
through
Irish
Aid
.
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
we
will
have
provide
€
62
million
for
the
Syrian
crisis
alone
.
we
have
make
specific
effort
in
support
of
we
European
partner
,
in
particular
,
Greece
and
the
Balkans
.
we
provide
core
support
for
the
Red
Cross
and
the
UN
high
Commission
for
Refugee
which
have
be
particularly
active
in
meet
the
immediate
need
of
refugee
in
Europe
.
since
the
start
of
2015
Irish
Aid
have
provide
€
180000
specifically
to
support
the
work
of
non-governmental
organisation
,
NGO
,
partner
in
Macedonia
alone
.
under
Ireland
's
rapid
response
initiative
,
we
have
also
deploy
two
rapid
responder
to
Serbia
and
Macedonia
and
a
further
two
to
Greece
.
a
further
deployment
next
week
will
support
the
UNHCR
's
provision
of
water
and
sanitation
service
for
refugee
there
.
that
arrive
in
Europe
start
they
journey
in
many
place
.
in
the
past
decade
most
migrant
arrive
from
sub-Saharan
and
north
Africa
.
however
,
the
Syrian
conflict
have
dramatically
change
the
profile
of
migrant
flow
and
Syrian
be
now
the
large
group
arrive
in
Europe
,
accounting
for
almost
half
of
that
arrive
in
Greece
last
year
.
last
month
mark
the
fifth
anniversary
of
the
start
of
the
brutal
Syrian
conflict
which
the
United
Nation
estimate
have
cause
up
to
400000
death
.
the
continue
violence
and
war
crime
which
have
force
million
of
Syrian
to
flee
they
home
and
country
must
end
and
that
responsible
must
be
hold
accountable
.
to
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Brendan
Smith
,
Ireland
firmly
believe
the
UN
Security
Council
should
refer
the
situation
in
Syria
to
the
International
criminal
Court
.
Ireland
urge
all
side
in
the
Geneva
negotiation
to
support
a
political
resolution
of
the
conflict
and
the
formation
of
a
representative
transitional
government
.
while
a
political
solution
be
desperately
need
,
sadly
,
it
be
not
clear
that
one
will
be
achieve
soon
.
need
be
rise
to
the
point
at
which
the
global
humanitarian
response
cannot
keep
up
with
they
.
Ireland
have
be
provide
assistance
for
Syrian
since
2012
and
this
aid
have
be
scale
up
as
the
impact
of
the
conflict
have
worsen
.
more
than
4.8
million
people
have
already
have
to
leave
Syria
.
in
2015
Ireland
provide
more
than
€
13
million
in
assistance
for
the
country
.
in
February
,
at
the
London
pledging
conference
on
Syria
,
I
commit
Ireland
to
provide
a
further
€
20
million
in
2016
.
Irish
Aid
funding
be
support
Irish
non-governmental
organisation
,
include
concern
,
GOAL
and
Trócaire
,
in
they
work
with
refugee
in
Syria
and
the
surround
region
.
the
statistic
for
the
number
affect
by
the
Syria
crisis
and
the
amount
of
funding
need
to
meet
they
need
be
so
staggering
that
the
human
story
behind
the
number
be
often
forget
.
previous
speaker
articulate
detail
of
individual
case
.
last
October
I
visit
the
refugee
camp
in
Azraq
,
Jordan
.
in
one
of
the
shelter
I
meet
a
mother
who
have
give
birth
to
she
third
child
at
a
border
post
without
medical
assistance
.
she
and
she
child
subsequently
present
to
a
Red
Cross
hospital
in
the
UN
camp
in
Azraq
.
when
one
consider
that
the
average
displacement
period
of
refugee
child
be
17
year
,
one
wonder
what
the
future
hold
for
she
child
.
how
will
they
grow
up
?
if
the
family
leave
a
neighbourhood
in
Syria
where
school
have
be
bomb
before
present
in
highly
traumatic
circumstance
to
a
refugee
camp
in
a
place
such
as
Azraq
,
how
will
the
child
fulfil
they
destiny
,
if
one
will
,
if
they
have
be
traumatise
to
such
a
extent
that
they
cannot
present
to
the
local
school
in
the
refugee
camp
?
we
be
leave
a
whole
generation
behind
.
Irish
people
be
do
what
they
can
in
we
external
response
through
the
aid
agency
and
multilateral
organisation
.
we
be
ensure
daily
,
whether
through
diplomatic
channel
or
the
work
we
do
with
individual
aid
agency
,
that
we
influence
the
work
be
do
on
the
ground
in
order
that
the
people
we
be
try
to
help
can
at
least
have
some
semblance
of
hope
for
the
future
.
the
global
humanitarian
crisis
have
result
in
the
displacement
of
at
least
56
million
people
who
will
need
humanitarian
assistance
.
the
country
affect
include
Somalia
,
Sudan
,
Yemen
and
northern
Nigeria
.
this
conflict
may
not
yet
have
prick
the
consciousness
of
many
Irish
people
,
but
the
world
humanitarian
summit
present
we
with
a
opportunity
.
I
be
hopeful
the
next
Taoiseach
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
and
the
President
will
attend
to
give
voice
to
Ireland
's
position
on
the
need
for
global
leadership
to
prevent
and
end
conflict
of
this
nature
.
the
majority
of
global
cris
be
protract
and
last
over
a
decade
or
more
.
I
hope
we
can
continue
as
a
nation
to
play
we
role
and
hope
that
in
the
new
politics
of
this
House
,
we
can
find
mechanism
through
the
committee
to
enable
we
come
together
and
form
a
common
bond
regard
how
this
parliament
,
as
representative
of
the
people
,
can
well
represent
how
taxpayer
invest
they
hard
-
earn
money
in
meet
the
need
of
the
people
we
have
be
speak
for
here
today
.
we
have
a
opportunity
to
continue
in
that
vein
.
I
will
finish
with
the
word
of
W.H.
Auden
.
today
be
poetry
day
Ireland
and
this
word
be
from
Auden
's
poem
Refugee
Blues
:
once
we
have
a
country
and
we
think
it
fair
,
look
in
the
atlas
and
you
will
find
it
there
:
we
cannot
go
there
now
,
my
dear
,
we
can
not
go
there
now
.
in
the
village
churchyard
there
grow
a
old
yew
,
every
spring
it
blossom
anew
:
Old
passport
can't
do
that
,
my
dear
,
old
passport
can't
do
that
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Frances
Fitzgerald
,
and
the
government
,
I
thank
deputy
from
all
side
of
this
House
for
the
wide
range
of
contribution
that
have
be
make
throughout
this
debate
.
the
level
of
engagement
from
all
side
recognise
that
this
be
a
issue
on
which
there
be
cross
-party
concern
and
one
,
I
hope
,
on
which
we
can
generate
cross-party
consensus
in
term
of
how
this
country
,
the
EU
and
the
international
community
must
respond
to
the
humanitarian
refugee
crisis
.
that
be
what
it
be
:
a
humanitarian
crisis
.
I
agree
with
that
who
call
it
that
.
I
echo
the
point
make
by
many
that
we
be
well
-
serve
by
the
fact
that
this
house
,
traditionally
and
right
through
to
this
thirty
-
second
Dáil
,
have
always
be
one
which
have
agree
and
respond
positively
to
request
for
solidarity
and
action
in
assist
refugee
seek
protection
within
the
EU
.
I
be
strike
by
the
number
of
my
constituent
contact
my
office
by
telephone
and
e-mail
ask
that
more
be
do
,
that
this
country
must
do
more
and
that
they
want
Ireland
to
play
its
part
in
support
refugee
in
they
relocation
effort
.
that
be
a
message
we
have
all
receive
in
this
House
.
it
be
one
that
we
have
to
hear
very
clearly
.
we
citizen
want
Ireland
to
be
to
the
fore
in
push
for
solution
to
this
humanitarian
crisis
.
I
be
move
by
deputy
Brady
's
reference
to
the
poem
Home
by
Warsan
Shire
which
I
just
look
up
.
I
think
it
put
word
to
the
very
serious
humanitarian
crisis
which
can
be
all
too
often
dehumanise
in
the
media
and
in
politics
.
this
be
real
people
.
nobody
put
they
child
on
a
boat
or
into
a
awful
situation
should
they
not
feel
the
absolute
necessity
to
do
so
for
the
safety
and
well
-
being
of
they
family
.
in
response
to
deputy
McGrath
's
point
,
I
too
be
very
proud
,
as
I
presume
all
member
of
this
house
be
and
as
many
have
express
,
of
the
role
be
play
by
the
Irish
Navy
.
the
Minister
for
Defence
,
deputy
Simon
Coveney
,
confirm
early
today
in
this
House
that
the
Navy
will
continue
to
make
that
effort
and
that
there
will
be
a
further
deployment
this
Sunday
regard
member
of
the
Naval
Service
.
they
continue
assistance
and
involvement
be
something
we
all
welcome
.
I
refer
to
the
point
make
by
deputy
McGrath
and
other
about
the
importance
of
Ireland
in
help
the
resettlement
and
relocation
of
the
4000
people
that
we
have
commit
to
.
that
commitment
still
stand
from
this
government
and
this
State
.
the
difficulty
of
the
low
number
to
date
arise
from
external
issue
.
the
target
of
4000
people
be
still
very
much
the
commitment
of
the
State
.
it
be
a
number
that
could
increase
when
family
unification
be
take
on
board
.
Ireland
continue
,
and
will
continue
,
to
play
its
part
at
a
EU
level
to
implement
agree
solution
to
this
refugee
crisis
.
we
will
continue
to
ensure
that
all
measure
take
be
in
full
respect
of
human
dignity
and
in
line
with
we
EU
and
international
obligation
.
at
home
,
we
must
ensure
that
Ireland
remain
a
welcoming
and
inclusive
society
for
that
in
need
of
we
protection
.
this
House
have
a
role
to
play

and
respectful
treatment

that

this

have
introduce
reform
legislation
.
last
December
,
the
House
debate
and
pass
the
International
Protection
Bill
.
the
International

act
will
reform
the
system
for

determine
application
for
international

in
Ireland
through
the
introduction
of

under

,
a

will
make

this

will
replace

current
multi-layered

and
be
intend
to
achieve
the
desire

many
of
the
Deputy
raise
the
issue
of
direct
provision
.
the
report
of
the
working
group
which
be
publish
by
Government
last
June
make
a
total
of
173
recommendation
.
many
of
this
have
implication
for
a
number
of
government
Department
and
service
.
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
recently
complete
a
consultation
exercise
on
the
status
of
the
recommendation
across
all
the
responsible
division
,
Department
and
agency
.
the
exercise
have
show
that
90
of
the
recommendation
have
be
fully
implement
and
a
further
26
be
in
the
process
of
be
implement
.
some
116
recommendation
have
be
progress
since
the
report
's
publication
in
June
2014
and
a
further
46
recommendation
be
the
subject
of
ongoing
consideration
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
social
policy
.
this
represent
yet
another
need
to
form
a
government
so
that
we
can
progress
this
further
.
I
believe
it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
pursue
this
issue
and
that
we
do
not
simply
have
a
one
-
off
debate
.
this
be
something
that
be
go
to
require
work
from
all
Member
of

I
hope
it
be
something
on
which
we
can
continue
to

the
Labour
Party
recognise
the
central
place
of
the
Irish
language
in
we
heritage
,
we
history
and
as
a
rich
resource
for
daily
life
.
the
Constitution
explicitly
recognise
Irish
as
the
first
language
of
the
State
and
it
be
we
view
that
this
place
certain
responsibility
on
all
government
to
vigorously
support
the
protection
and
development
of
the
language
.
I
want
to
take
a
slightly
different
tack
today
.
I
speak
through
the
medium
of
English
.
I
feel
strongly
that
Irish
be
often
present
in
a
binary
fashion
,
typify
by
that
who
have
the
language
and
that
who
do
not
.
the
last
census
record
more
than
160
language
be
speak
in
this
country
and
we
have
a
multiplicity
of
nationality
here
now
.
I
believe
that
in
the
globalised
society
we
live
in
,
we
must
recognise
the
attempt
by
that
who
be
seek
to
encourage
bilingualism
and
multilingualism
within
this
island
.
it
be
not
about
one
language
be
good
than
another
but
about
use
language
efficiently
.
it
be
also
about
seek
to
encourage
great
awareness
of
the
critical
importance
of
language
learning
,
not
only
in
term
of
increase
employment
possibility
and
meet
industry
need
,
but
also
its
broad
value
in
the
sphere
of
education
,
the
art
and
in
the
context
of
support
social
cohesion
and
intercultural
understanding
.
in
that
context
,
Irish
have
a
significant
role
to
play
in
term
of
encourage
multilingualism
and
bilingualism
.

what
we
will
do
:
act
as
a
rallying
point
and
a
powerful
voice
for
all
interested
in
language
issue
.
globalisation
have
change
we
experience
of
language
diversity
.
there
be
now
few
place
in
the
world
in
which
multiple
language
be
not
present
and
in
which
people
do
not
make
use
of
repertoire
that
draw
on
several
different
language
.
as
a
former
minister
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
I
have
find
there
be
ample
research
evidence
regard
the
numerous
benefit
of
language
learning
.
for
example
,
in
the
Irish
context
research
have
demonstrate
that
bilingualism
in
Irish
and
English
enhance
mathematics
performance
and
that
the
Irish
language
lend
itself
to
the
good
understanding
of
mathematical
concept
.
there
have
be
repeat
statement
from
high
-
level
industry
leader
,
employment
specialist
,
advisory
body
and
experienced
linguist
on
the
deficit
in
appropriate
language
skill
and
the
important
role
the
learning
of
other
language
,
of
which
Irish
be
one
,
can
play
in
the
improvement
of
literacy
level
.
a
appreciation
need
to
be
foster
,
at
government
level
and
among
the
wide
public
,
on
the
significant
cognitive
,
social
,
developmental
,
cultural
and
linguistic
enhancement
that
can
be
attain
through
the
learning
of
Irish
or
other
additional
language
.
we
need
to
improve
the
teaching
and
learning
of
science
,
mathematics
and
engineering
and
research
show
that
where
student
be
educate
through
the
medium
of
Irish
,
and
where
they
live
in
bilingual
community
,
they
learning
outcome
be
a
lot
good
.
we
should
focus
more
on
that
opportunity
.
I
speak
for
thousand
of
people
throughout
this
country
when
I
say
I
do
not
know
if
I
will
ever
be
fluent
but
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
conduct
my
everyday
business
in
a
bilingual
way
.
perhaps
we
need
to
focus
more
on
the
opportunity
therein
.
I
be
glad
I
live
in
a
area
where
,
over
the
past
five
year
,
there
have
be
a
explosion
in
the
number
of
place
in
Gaelscoileanna
and
there
be
two
Gaelscoileanna
under
construction
in
my
constituency
,
in
Mainistir
Fhear
Maí
and
Mainistir
to
Corann
.
we
be
very
proud
of
that
and
we
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
continuum
between
what
student
learn
at
primary
level
and
what
they
learn
at
post
-
primary
level
.
we
need
to
do
more
to
encourage
people
in
community
like
Mallow
,
Fermoy
and
Midleton
,
where
we
have
this
Gaelscoileanna
,
to
use
the
language
in
they
everyday
transaction
on
the
street
or
through
interaction
with
government
agency
.
we
need
to
wide
the
debate
and
recognise
that
there
be
over
160
language
speak
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
target
resource
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
more
people
speak
the
language
or
,
at
least
,
be
inculcate
with
the
language
during
everyday
usage
,
and
this
be
a
big
challenge
.
we
be
all
wed
to
the
20
-
year
strategy
and
if
we
witness
economic
growth
we
need
to
ensure
the
resource
be
make
available
so
that
the
plan
bear
fruit
.
every
time
there
be
a
debate
on
the
Irish
language
somebody
get
up
and
say
somebody
have
such
a
amount
of
proficiency
and
somebody
else
do
not
.
let
we
get
away
from
that
binary
,
hackneyed
debate
and
broaden
it
out
so
that
we
can
get
more
people
actually
speak
Irish
.
let
we
encourage
people
to
speak
the
language
more
and
if
we
broaden
the
debate
we
can
also
encourage
the
use
of
bilingualism
in
everyday
life
.
that
be
a
very
reasonable
proposition
.
in
the
spirit
of
this
new
dispensation
and
new
politics
,
the
Labour
Party
intend
to
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
we
believe
the
Oireachtas
,
through
its
committee
,
have
the
requisite
capacity
to
interrogate
the
three
flaw
,
as
articulate
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
Bill
,
the
need
to
consult
the
ECB
before
the
intend
Bill
could
be
enact
and
the
statement
by
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
that
it
do
not
wish
to
regulate
interest
rate
.
if
it
be
the
will
of
the
House
that
this
Bill
be
consider
under
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
then
so
be
it
.
however
,
we
see
no
reason
that
be
necessary
.

section
5
of
the
Bill
,
which
deal
with
the
issuance
of
a
direction
by
the
Central
Bank
to
a
specific
lender
or
lender
,
deserve
further
scrutiny
.
the
issue
of
contract
law
loom
large
over
the
section
but
we
believe
that
this
be
something
that
can
be
examine
further
at
the
next
stage
of
the
Bill
.
we
recognise
that
bank
have
to
make
a
profit
but
there
be
a
fine
line
between
make
a
profit
and
profiteering
.
a
person
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
take
out
a
mortgage
in
2009
with
permanent
TSB
.
since
2009
,
that
person
have
be
pay
interest
,
in
one
specific
period
,
at
rate
of
up
to
6.5
%
.
the
borrower
estimate
that
over
the
lifetime
of
the
mortgage
he
could
end
up
pay
a
additional
€
100000
in
interest
payment
alone
and
what
grieve
that
person
be
the
fact
that
mortgage
product
that
be
offer
now
on
a
similar
property
of
similar
value
be
significantly
cheap
.
he
recognise
that
he
sign
a
contract
,
and
he
recognise
that
bank
must
make
a
profit
but
with
some
justification
he
feel
that
have
to
pay
up
to
€
100000
more
than
he
neighbour
for
the
same
amount
of
money
borrow
,
albeit
from
a
different
bank
,
be
unfair
.
on
committee
stage
my
party
intend
to
examine
more
closely
the
issue
of
marginal
interest
.
the
question
of
profitability
versus
profiteering
could
be
address
,
for
instance
,
through
the
capping
of
variable
interest
rate
such
that
,
for
instance
,
if
the
ECB
set
a
rate
at
2.5
%
,
a
margin
could
be
determine
,
for
instance
,
two
percentage
point
in
excess
of
that
,
which
would
allow
for
a
degree
of
profitability
and
competition
without
profiteer
in
that
bank
could
compete
within
the
two
percentage
point
margin
.
we
want
to
explore
that
at
a
further
stage
or
at
least
have
a
proper
discussion
in
a
collegiate
way
around
that
.
I
accept
it
be
interventionist
within
the
market
but
my
party
consider
it
be
worthy
of
further
examination
.
we
have
some
question
on
section
2
,
on
the
assessment
.
it
be
difficult
to
understand
how
the
Central
Bank
,
subject
to
the
11
"
factor
"
outline
in
the
assessment
in
the
Bill
,
could
reasonably
conclude
that
a
market
failure
exist
.
section
4
(
2
)
state
that
"
"
market
failure
"
shall
mean
a
situation
in
which
market
condition
be
such
that
a
lender
be
,
or
lender
be
,
charge
a
variable
interest
rate
or
variable
interest
rate
for
principal
dwelling
house
mortgage
loan
which
be
high
than
the
Central
Bank
consider
can
be
reasonably
and
objectively
justify
by
reference
to
the
factor
set
out
in
section
3
.
"
the
question
be
,
how
can
the
Central
Bank
,
even
when
the
11
factor
be
take
into
account
in
section
3
,
reasonably
intervene
to
make
a
direction
in
a
individual
or
collective
case
if
that
individual
have
,
in
the
first
instance
,
sign
a
contract
with
a
mortgage
provider
,
and
the
question
then
arise
,
do
the
law
of
contract
supersede
the
enactment
of
this
Bill
or
do
this
Bill
give
power
to
the
Central
Bank
that
may
be
subservient
to
the
law
of
contract
.
my
party
have
a
open
mind
in
term
of
explore
that
question
at
the
next
stage
and
while
we
may
differ
from
deputy
Paul
Murphy
in
regard
to
the
recognition
that
bank
must
make
a
profit
,
we
have
to
distinguish
between
make
a
profit
and
profiteering
.
in
the
spirit
of
the
new
paradigm
,
in
this
current
enlightenment
period
,
which
I
hope
will
last
,
we
will
explore
the
Bill
further
.
we
believe
that
there
be
not
necessarily
a
need
for
pre-legislative
scrutiny
because
we
all
have
the
wherewithal
within
this
House
to
be
able
to
interrogate
the
Bill
further
and
if
we
need
to
bring
in
expert
to
address
any
of
the
issue
or
the
question
that
may
be
outstanding
then
in
the
spirit
of
the
new
dispensation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
we
should
take
a
pragmatic
view
on
this
Bill
and
allow
it
to
proceed
to
the
next
stage
and
discuss
this
matter
further
.
I
thank
deputy
Lawless
for
he
kind
word
and
I
wish
to
reciprocate
they
.
I
hope
he
have
a
long
and
happy
period
in
this
House
.
as
he
have
be
a
constituent
of
mine
,
I
would
also
say
that
,
while
I
have
never
be
a
constituent
of
he
,
most
of
my
family
come
from
Kildare
and
there
be
many
constituent
leave
there
who
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
do
he
a
favour
in
the
future
.
I
be
not
sure
I
can
do
a
great
deal
for
he
today
,
but
I
can
certainly
give
he
a
reply
to
the
question
he
have
put
.

a

.
with
a
few
short
word
,
I
express
the
concern
of
the
people
of
Cobh
,
who
be
currently
read
a
recent
study
by
the
National
Cancer
Registry
of
Ireland
indicate
that
the
rate
of
prostate
cancer
there
be
71
%
high
than
the
national
average
,
with
female
breast
cancer
incidence
38
%
above
the
norm
.
the
people
of
Cobh
be
very
concerned
.
while
he
be
in
the
House
,
I
congratulate
my
constituency
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
David
Stanton
,
on
he
new
position
.
I
know
he
have
speak
on
this
issue
and
express
concern
about
it
in
the
past
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
when
the
National
Cancer
Registry
be
ask
for
a
reason
that
the
rate
be
high
in
Cobh
,
it
state
that
it
could
be
down
to
the
issue
of
social
deprivation
.
I
do
not
believe
that
be
a
proper
answer
when
ask
a
question
of
that
nature
.
we
know
that
Cobh
be
a
town
with
a
history
of
heavy
industry
,
that
there
be
a
remediation
programme
go
on
at
the
moment
in
a
area
in
which
heavy
industry
be
no
long
locate
and
that
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
be
monitor
the
pharmaceutical
or
pharmachem
industry
in
the
low
harbour
area
.
however
,
we
do
not
have
actual
clean
air
monitoring
at
specific
reference
point
throughout
the
Cobh
area
and
there
be
no
live
reporting
to
the
public
.
it
could
be
beneficial
if
a
baseline
study
be
instigate
for
Cobh
and
a
full
investigation
could
be
carry
out
.
this
could
be
do
without
necessarily
put
a
extra
charge
on
the
Exchequer
because
there
be
a
number
of
stakeholder
,
such
as
gps
and
ucc
,
in
particular
,
which
have
address
the
strategic
policy
committee
of
Cork
County
Council
,
that
be
,
the
environment
committee
.
the
department
of
chemistry
and
the
environmental
research
unit
have
state
that
they
would
be
happy
to
conduct
study
in
this
area
.
it
be
a
issue
that
affect
every
family
in
Cobh
.
Professor
Colin
Bradley
,
a
professor
of
general
practice
,
state
recently
:
"
I
have
see
more
cancer
in
surprisingly
young
people
than
I
would
in
previous
practice
"
.
he
be
refer
specifically
to
Cobh
.
I
believe
it
be
a
issue
that
be
worthy
of
further
investigation
.
I
do
not
accept
the
social
deprivation
answer
that
have
be
give
by
the
National
Cancer
Registry
.
we
lay
the
work
it
do
but
we
need
some
empirical
evidence
.
it
would
appear
that
there
be
a
intergenerational
increase
in
the
rate
of
cancer
,
not
only
prostate
and
female
breast
cancer
,
but
also
in
other
area
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
at
least
to
consider
facilitate
some
stakehold
engagement
on
this
issue
.
I
be
not
necessarily
look
for
a
cheque
for
a
baseline
study
but
if
we
can
get
a
favourable
response
from
the
minister
to
the
idea
of
put
together
some
sort
of
stakeholder
group
involve
ucc
,
which
have
state
that
it
would
be
willing
at
least
to
partake
in
further
study
on
this
issue
,
then
we
could
seek
to
deliver
something
for
the
people
in
Cobh
,
who
be
gravely
concerned
about
the
matter
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
to
have
a
open
mind
.
I
will
leave
he
with
one
metric
.
if
one
look
at
the
1994
to
2007
figure
,
the
urban
area
of
Cobh
have
a
37
%
high
incidence
than
other
part
of
the
country
.
that
would
mean
that
within
that
timeframe
,
someone
in
Cobh
be
diagnose
with
cancer
every
11
day
.
I
thank
the
Acting
Chairman
and
hope
I
will
receive
a
favourable
reply
.
I
thank
Deputy
O'Dowd
,
Breathnach
,
Adams
and
Munster
for
raise
this
issue
and
for
allow
I
to
address
the
House
on
the
matter
.
in
direct
response
to
deputy
Munster
's
question
,
the
first
thing
I
be
go
to
do
be
stop
play
party
politics
with
the
health
service
,
and
that
be
why
I
receive
cabinet
approval
today
to
move
ahead
with
the
motion
-
which
I
understand
deputy
Munster
's
own
party
and
indeed
every
party
in
this
House
feel
very
strongly
about
-
to
set
up
a
cross
-party
committee
to
meet
within
six
month
to
look
at
a
single
vision
for
a
single
tier
public
health
service
and
how
we
be
go
to
fund
that
.
I
look
forward
to
constructive
idea
on
that
measure
.
I
regret
that
a
decision
be
make
to
undertake
industrial
action
in
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
Hospital
,
Drogheda
follow
the
breakdown
of
talk
at
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
,
WRC
,
last
Friday
on
resolution
of
the
staffing
difficulty
at
the
hospital
.
I
believe
that
the
interest
of
patient
be
always
well
serve
through
negotiation
and
by
avoid
industrial
action
.
Industrial
action
,
even
if
it
be
limit
to
non-core
duty
,
be
not
in
the
good
interest
of
patient
care
and
cannot
resolve
the
staffing
issue
.
nonetheless
,
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Munster
about
care
professionalism
and
I
be
sure
it
be
not
a
decision
any
nurse
take
lightly
.
I
be
pleased
,
therefore
,
that
the
INMO
and
the
HSE
have
accept
a
invitation
from
the
WRC
to
attend
a
meeting
tomorrow
to
discuss
the
issue
.
I
welcome
this
progress
and
this
recommencement
of
talk
.
I
be
satisfied
that
the
issue
raise
by
the
INMO
can
be
well
address
through
engagement
at
the
WRC
.
meanwhile
,
the
hospital
be
implement
a
contingency
plan
to
minimise
,
in
so
far
as
be
possible
,
the
impact
of
the
industrial
action
on
patient
care
.
the
emergency
department
will
remain
open
over
the
course
of
the
industrial
action
in
a
effort
to
continue
to
meet
patient
's
emergency
medical
need
.
unfortunately
,
the
contingency
plan
include
cancel
all
plan
,
non-urgent
elective
procedure
today
other
than
cancer
related
care
.
patient
whose
appointment
be
affect
be
contact
directly
by
the
hospital
and
a
new
date
will
be
re-schedule
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
want
to
correct
the
impression
that
there
be
a
recruitment
embargo
at
present
.
this
be
not
the
case
and
there
be
no
blanket
embargo
on
recruitment
.
while
there
have
to
be
compliance
with
national
pay
structure
and
management
of
employment
number
within
budget
in
the
HSE
,
there
be
scope
for
hospital
to
continue
to
recruit
,
particularly
across
key
department
such
as
intensive
care
unit
,
theatre
and
emergency
department
.
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
recognise
the
need
for
ongoing
recruitment
drive
due
to
the
movement
of
staff
across
the
HSE
and
to
other
health
care
service
in
Ireland
and
abroad
.
to
date
,
34
nurse
and
midwive
have
be
recruit
to
the
hospital
this
year
and
21
staff
nurse
be
in
the
process
of
be
recruit
.
at
present
there
be
two
campaign
of
particular
relevance
:
a
Royal
College
of
Surgeons
in
Ireland
hospital
group
competition
and
a
initiative
to
offer
all
nursing
graduate
of
2016
the
opportunity
for
permanent
nursing
post
.
the
HSE
have
continually
increase
staffing
level
since
the
beginning
of
2015
.
by
the
end
of
March
2016
overall
health
service
employee
number
have
increase
by
58856
whole
-
time
equivalent
,
the
vast
majority
in
front
-
line
position
.
during
that
15
-
month
period
from
January
2015
,
the
number
employ
in
acute
hospital
increase
by
3500
whole
-
time
equivalent
,
with
nursing
number
up
by
more
than
1700
whole
-
time
equivalent
during
the
same
timeframe
.
I
assure
deputy
that
the
government
be
fully
aware
of
the
difficulty
and
challenge
.
I
be
due
to
meet
the
INMO
tomorrow
to
discuss
nursing
issue
in
general
and
I
look
forward
to
engage
constructively
with
it
and
to
continue
the
very
constructive
role
it
play
in
co-chair
the
emergency
department
task
force
as
we
all
work
together
as
stakeholder
to
try
to
address
the
issue
face
we
emergency
department
and
hospital
staff
,
include
nurse
and
midwive
,
in
deliver
care
.
it
be
my
intention
to
continue
to
grow
the
health
budget
as
the
economy
improve
and
to
obtain
the
resource
necessary
to
improve
working
condition
for
front
-
line
staff
to
enable
we
to
deliver
the
level
of
service
that
we
all
want
to
provide
to
we
patient
.
I
wish
to
put
the
health
service
employee
number
on
the
record
in
this
House
.
while
it
do
not
always
fit
the
political
narrative
,
the
number
be
the
number
.
I
absolutely
accept
there
be
still
some
way
to
go
to
get
back
to
the
number
of
front
-
line
staff
work
in
we
hospital
before
the
recession
but
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
number
have
continue
to
increase
since
December
2013
.
at
that
time
,
there
be
47,934
people
work
in
the
acute
sector
.
in
December
2014
,
that
figure
have
increase
to
49742
.
by
December
2015
,
it
have
increase
to
52539
.
in
March
2016
,
that
number
stand
at
53253
.
with
regard
to
nurse
,
include
midwive
,
at
the
end
of
2014
there
be
34211
,
which
rise
to
35036
in
March
2015
and
to
35918
in
March
2016
.
since
December
2014
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of
1,707
nurse
,
which
be
a
5
%
increase
.
since
March
2015
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of
825
,
which
be
a
2.5
%
increase
.
there
be
significantly
more
to
do
but
it
be
simply
not
correct
to
put
the
narrative
out
there
that
nursing
number
and
front
-
line
staff
be
decline
when
in
fact
the
opposite
be
true
.
deputy
O'Dowd
's
invitation
to
visit
we

be
absolutely

I
would
like
to
take
up

we
support
the
motion
before
the
House
and
acknowledge
wholeheartedly
that
after
42
year
we
seem
to
be
no
close
to
the
truth
,
despite
the
good
effort
of
Barron
and
MacEntee
and
the
good
effort
of
this
House
as
articulate
in
its
report
of
2004
and
the
subsequent
motion
of
2008
and
2011
.
now
,
here
we
be
again
seek
to
speak
for
the
victim
and
articulate
on
a
cross-
party
basis
and
in
a
manner
which
speak
for
all
of
the
people
within
the
26
county
that
we
want
to
assist
the
victim
and
they
family
in
seek
truth
.
I
worry
sometimes
when
I
stand
before
this
House
speak
on
this
issue
.
it
have
take
42
year
of
debate
,
cajoling
and
effort
on
the
part
of
the
victim
and
they
family
,
and
I
hope
we
will
not
let
another
generation
go
by
before
we
do
finally
seek
truth
on
this
matter
.
I
read
a
speech
by
the
UK
Secretary
of
State
,
Theresa
Villier
,
recently
.
it
be
give
on
11
February
2016
.
in
the
speech
she
state
,
"
the
government
fully
recognise
that
it
will
be
much
more
difficult
to
achieve
we
objective
of
build
a
genuinely
share
future
for
everyone
in
Northern
Ireland
unless
and
until
we
can
find
some
way
of
come
to
term
with
a
divide
past
.
"
she
go
on
to
say
:
where
there
be
evidence
of
wrongdoing
it
will
be
pursue
.
everyone
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
law
.
however
,
it
would
appear
that
not
everyone
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
law
.
why
be
it
that
we
be
still
talk
about
this
42
year
late
,
in
a
era
of
suppose
transparency
,
where
we
be
try
to
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
and
have
be
through
two
iteration
of
talk
?
I
be
party
to
that
talk
in
2014
and
2015
and
it
seem
to
I
that
there
be
a
hunger
among
the
victim
and
survivor
for
simple
truth
and
that
the
issue
of
reconciliation
and
move
on
as
a
society
will
never
be
attain
fully
until
such
time
as
truth
reign
supreme
.
in
this
era
,
when
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
be
extremely
positive
and
evolve
in
a
positive
sense
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
facilitate
people
who
want
that
basic
and
fundamental
right
to
justice
.
it
be
worth
note
that
the
Oireachtas
sub
-
committee
examination
of
the
Barron
report
,
which
date
back
to
2004
,
state
:
(
ii
)
...
in
all
probability
most
if
not
all
of
the
perpetrator
come
from
Northern
Ireland
.
(
iii
)
that
in
all
probability
information
which
identify
and
which
concern
the
perpetrator
still
exist
in
Northern
Ireland
and
great
Britain
.

)
that
in
all
probability
most
of
the
information
touch
on
collusion
in
relation
to
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
be
in
Northern
Ireland
and
/
or
in
great
Britain
.
they
be
three
very
pertinent
point
and
I
do
not
think
the
situation
have
change
between
2004
and
2016
in
that
regard
.
I
know
that
successive
government
have
raise
this
issue
with
successive
British
government
and
I
know
,
have
serve
as
minister
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
that
this
have
be
raise
very
recently
by
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Flanagan
.
I
also
know
,
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
that
he
constantly
raise
this
very
specific
issue
,
among
other
,
with
the
Secretary
of
State
.
I
believe
strongly
that
this
be
a
worthy
motion
.
diplomacy
be
very
effective
,
whether
it
be
economic
or
political
diplomacy
.
it
be
important
that
this
house
send
a
message
to
the
British
government
on
behalf
of
the
Irish
people
,
which
be
that
we
will
continue
to
press
for
justice
and
truth
and
that
we
will
allow
access
by
a
independent
international
judicial
figure
to
all
original
document
in
they
possession
pertain
to
this
bombing
.
this
issue
need
to
be
tackle
if
we
be
to
fulfil
good
relation
from
a
Anglo
-
Irish
and
North
-
South
perspective
.
I
believe
strongly
that
this
motion
be
worthy
of
support
on
a
cross
-party
basis
.
I
be
keen
to
acknowledge
the
work
of
justice
for
the
Forgotten
.
I
know
that
involve
be
in
constant
contact
with
official
in
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
I
wish
to
acknowledge
they
role
as
one
of
many
organisation
in
the
six
County
that
continue
to
advocate
for
victim
.
the
legacy
issue
be
not
deal
with
sufficiently
in
the
last
iteration
of
the
Stormont
talk
.
there
be
a
important
role
for
this
House
to
play
now
on
a
cross
-party
basis
.
we
must
ensure
that
we
continue
to
press
for
the
legacy
issue
to
be
deal
with
.
Society
,
North
and
South
,
will
not
fully
move
on
until
this
issue
be
deal
with
.
we
have
a
duty
of
care
to
people
within
the
six
County
to
continue
to
press
this
issue
with
the
British
government
.
I
be
happy
to
give
five
minute
to
my
colleague
if
he
want
to
eat
into
Labour
time
.
I
move
amendment
no.
1
to
amendment
no.
2
:
to
insert
the
follow
after
''
its
recommendation
by
the
Oireachtas
''
:
''
believe
that
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
in
accordance
with
law
should
not
now
be
unfairly
disadvantage
compare
to
that
who
have
not
;
consider
that
,
if
the
ongoing
liability
to
pay
be
suspend
,
there
would
be
no
practical
reality
to
pursue
outstanding
unpaid
charge
;
conclude
that
in
such
circumstance
the
only
fair
approach
would
be
to
make
a
full
refund
to
all
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
;
and
agree
in
principle
to
a
referendum
on
a
constitutional
amendment
that
commit
to
maintain
we
public
water
supply
and
treatment
system
,
and
we
electricity
and
gas
transmission
and
distribution
network
,
in
public
ownership
.
''
I
wish
to
reiterate
some
point
we
make
in
this
House
on
27
April
when
we
have
statement
on
Irish
Water
.
some
of
that
point
be
pertinent
to
tonight
's
debate
.
law
-
abide
people
who
do
pay
will
have
to
get
they
money
back
.
that
will
mean
Irish
Water
will
have
to
reprocess
well
in
excess
of
2
million
financial
transaction
.
regardless
of
whether
the
charge
be
to
be
suspend
or
abolish
,
the
Labour
Party
believe
the
government
must
tell
people
how
and
when
it
will
give
they
they
money
back
.
it
may
not
suit
political
discourse
at
present
but
it
be
a
matter
of
fact
that
Irish
Water
's
investment
have
deliver
34
new
treatment
plant
,
26
of
which
be
for
wastewater
and
eight
for
drinking
water
,
as
well
as
73
upgrade
involve
51
wastewater
and
22
drinking
water
facility
.
a
further
47
water
conservation
project
have
be
complete
and
452
kilometer
of
pipe
have
be
remediate
.
if
there
be
a
proposal
to
revert
to
the
local
authority
whereby
fund
would
be
divest
solely
through
the
Exchequer
through
that
local
authority
,
one
need
look
no
further
than
County
Roscommon
as
a
example
of
where
the
old
model
simply
do
not
work
.
I
believe
deputy
Fitzmaurice
already
have
make
reference
to
this
point
.
I
need
not
remind
member
of
the
improvement
it
have
make
the
life
of
more
than
17000
people
in
County
Roscommon
who
be
on
boil
water
notice
.
the
resident
of
Castlerea
,
for
example
,
be
subject
to
a
boil
water
notice
from
November
2009
to
June
2013
.
if
the
proposal
be
that
it
would
revert
to
the
local
authority
,
which
be
gain
credence
in
some
circle
,
and
that
funding
would
come
from
the
Exchequer
and
that
people
be
already
pay
for
water
through
they
taxation
,
why
then
be
it
that
this
issue
be
not
address
at
that
time
?
the
Labour
Party
amendment
and
the
addendum
seek
to
speak
for
that
who
do
pay
they
water
charge
.
we
believe
that
that
who
have
pay
they
charge
in
accordance
with
the
law
should
not
now
be
unfairly
disadvantage
compare
with
that
who
have
not
.
we
believe
that
if
the
ongoing
liability
to
pay
be
suspend
,
there
would
be
no
practical
reality
to
pursue
outstanding
unpaid
charge
and
that
in
such
circumstance
,
the
only
fair
approach
would
be
to
make
a
full
refund
to
all
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
.
moreover
,
the
Labour
Party
agree
in
principle
to
a
referendum
on
a
constitutional
amendment
that
commit
to
maintain
Ireland
's
public
water
supply
and
treatment
system
,
as
well
as
its
electricity
and
gas
transmission
and
distribution
network
in
public
ownership
.
the
Labour
Party
have
already
tab
a
Bill
in
this
regard
.
obviously
,
there
will
be
a
opportunity
for
the
hospital
,
through
the
hospital
group
structure
,
to
raise
whatever
issue
it
wish
to
raise
with
I
.
this
will
be
a
meeting
for
I
to
ascertain
the
priority
of
that
hospital
group
in
term
of
the
development
of
health
care
facility
in
the
region
.
the
deputy
also
make
a
valid
point
regard
the
ongoing
need
to
tackle
the
trolley
crisis
,
which
have
show
some
sign
of
improvement
this
month
although
,
overall
,
the
number
be
still
marginally
high
this
year
.
I
acknowledge
that
Galway
be
a
particular
area
of
difficulty
at
certain
time
.
I
will
attend
my
first
meeting
of
the
emergency
department
task
force
,
which
be
co-chair
by
the
INMO
and
the
HSE
,
with
relevant
stakeholder
next
Monday

I
certainly
will
seek
a
update
on
the
position
in
Galway
at
that

I
be
happy
to
keep
in

deputy
Connolly

I
hope
I
have
have
a

I
look

we
welcome
the
motion
to
develop
a
single
long
-
term
vision
or
plan
for
the
provision
of
health
care
.
I
add
my
congratulation
to
that
of
other
to
the
two
minister
and
acknowledge
deputy
Róisín
Shortall
's
singular
vision
in
create
the
motion
.
we
be
in
positive
mode
in
relation
to
the
potential
of
the
committee
and
will
engage
productively
with
it
.
I
welcome
the
tone
of
the
minister
's
speech
in
that
there
appear
to
be
a
genuine
willingness
to
engage
with
all
party
and
all
member
in
this
Dáil
in
seek
a
meeting
of
mind
on
how
we
can
figure
out
and
instigate
a
proper
vision
for
the
provision
of
health
care
into
the
future
.
if
we
be
honest
,
we
can
reasonably
assume
that
there
be
much
common
ground
between
we
on
the
need
of
citizen
.
there
have
to
be
a
particular
focus
on
the
continuum
of
care
as
between
primary
,
secondary
and
tertiary
care
.
the
one
question
I
have
on
the
creation
of
the
committee
be
how
it
will
dovetail
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
.
will
it
be
a
tool
of
government
policy
into
the
future
or
what
mandate
will
it
have
if
it
come
up
with
a
set
of
recommendation
that
do
not
tally
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
,
of
which
there
be
many
?
give
that
approximately
€
13
billion
be
to
be
spend
this
year
alone
in
the
health
sector
and
consider
the
many
commitment
make
in
the
programme
for
government
from
primary
care
through
to
secondary
and
tertiary
care
,
include
mental
health
,
the
issue
of
resource
will
have
to
be
address
within
the
remit
of
the
committee
.
if
we
be
to
aspire
to
have
a
comprehensive
continuum
of
care
between
primary
,
secondary
and
tertiary
care
,
include
community
care
and
mental
health
service
provision
,
it
will
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
and
clear
choice
will
have
to
be
make
.
to
be
fair
to
he
,
the
minister
mention
this
in
he
contribution
when
he
refer
to
the
trade
-
off
between
efficiency
and
equity
and
comprehensiveness
and
cost
control
.
this
be
something
that
will
merit
further
interrogation
.
I
welcome
the
document
good
health
because
it
provide
a
good
template
and
set
out
the
parameter
within
which
we
be
operate
.
some
of
the
challenge
in
health
care
provision
include
the
fact
that
the
number
of
people
aged
over
85
year
in
Ireland
be
,
accord
to
CSO
estimate
,
increase
by
approximately
3.3
%
each
year
.
this
present
a
major
challenge
for
all
of
we
in
the
management
of
demographic
.
some
38
%
of
Irish
people
over
the
age
of
50
year
suffer
from
one
chronic
disease
.
Chronic
disease
account
for
80
%
of
all
gp
visit
,
40
%
of
hospital
admission
and
75
%
of
hospital
bed
day
.
the
minister
speak
strongly
about
focus
on
primary
care
and
try
to
intervene
as
much
as
possible
at
that
level
.
that
be
something
on
which
we
all
agree
.
the
aim
of
such
a
policy
should
seek
to
ensure
people
be
keep
out
of
tertiary
care
facility
for
as
long
as
possible
and
that
intervention
be
make
at
community
level
.
that
would
have
a
major
impact
in
patient
care
and
would
also
create
the
ability
to
reduce
cost
and
be
more
efficient
in
the
use
of
resource
.
on
the
flipside
,
it
would
require
a
massive
injection
of
capital
into
the
primary
care
system
.
if
we
be
to
manage
the
demographic
challenge
and
the
ongoing
challenge
in
chronic
care
service
,
as
I
have
outline
,
in
that
paradigm
primary
care
facility
will
need
resource
.
speak
as
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
the
last
government
create
a
health
innovation
hub
.
we
create
a
demonstrator
model
whereby
we
seek
to
utilise
the
good
research
that
exist
from
a
geographical
perspective
in
term
of
medical
device
and
service
.
we
seek
to
inculcate
the
thinking
that
exist
base
on
the
research
that
be
ongoing
within
we
academic
institution
as
a
means
of
seek
to
ensure
that
great
efficiency
.
I
be
not
sure
where
the
health
innovation
hub
stand
at
present
now
that
there
be
a
new
government
form
.
however
,
I
believe
that
innovation
and
engagement
with
stakeholder
in
the
academic
space
be
go
to
be
vital
.
we
will
need
a
proper
analysis
of
population
figure
and
a
sense
of
inculcate
some
of
the
thinking
that
exist
within
academic
institution
to
determine
how
we
be
go
to
provide
the
vision
that
be
necessary
.
I
believe
that
the
primary
care
centre
be
one
mechanism
by
which
we
could
link
up
with
academic
institution
to
try
to
drive
innovation
and
to
ensure
,
as
deputy
Kelleher
state
early
,
that
more
diagnostics
take
place
within
the
primary
care
setting
so
as
to
prevent
people
from
present
to
secondary
and
tertiary
care
facility
and
to
keep
they
at
home
for
long
.
the
datum
that
be
use
can
then
be
analyse
and
partner
with
medical
device
company
,
innovator
in
the
health
care
provision
space
or
academic
to
try
to
analyse
the
datum
so
that
we
can
then
produce
policy
outcome
that
deliver
the
efficiency
that
be
necessary
for
the
system
.
we
need
more
of
that
within
the
system
.
it
be
a
case
of
mainstream
that
into
the
system
because
currently
it
be
peripheral
.
we
need
to
have
a
great
interrogation
of
the
relationship
between
the
HSE
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
there
be
still
some
siloed
thinking
in
how
the
HSE
,
this
House
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
minister
interact
.
we
need
a
great
interrogation
of
that
relationship
to
ensure
that
there
be
more
transparency
around
it
.
we
also
need
to
look
at
why
there
be
a
constant
need
for
a
Supplementary
estimate
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
I
say
that
objectively
.
take
this
year
for
example
,
if
there
be
provision
make
at
the
start
of
the
year
for
€
13
billion
,
will
this
committee
have
a
remit
to
examine
and
interrogate
the
deployment
of
resource
more
closely
?
we
need
to
look
at
it
in
term
of
seek
efficiency
for
the
system
in
order
that
the
citizen
can
have
confidence
that
he
or
she
will
have
access
to
the
service
that
be
necessary
,
whether
he
or
she
present
to
a
gp
,
a
secondary
care
facility
or
a
tertiary
care
facility
.
we
need
to
look
at
the
whole
issue
of
health
insurance
and
we
need
to
talk
to
the
health
insurance
provider
.
we
need
to
look
at
why
there
be
spare
capacity
within
secondary
care
facility
,
such
as
Mallow
or
Ennis
,
where
more
elective
surgery
could
be
do
.
we
could
take
much
of
the
constraint
that
be
in
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
Hospital
and
radiate
more
service
out
to
secondary
care
facility
.
with
regard
to
mental
health
,
we
need
to
have
a
proper
discussion
on
how
a
Vision
for
Change
be
implement
and
resource
.
I
thank
the

always

maybe
in

regards
this
be
a

.
I

much
of

stem
from
the
fact
that
point
apply

where
a

it
have
be
suggest
that
the

should
,
instead
,
be
combine
with
a
successful
prosecution
through
the
court
.
in
recent
week
,
there
have
be
a
number
of
meeting
between
I
,
my
predecessor
and
the
fishing
industry
with
regard
to
the
concern
raise
.
I
meet
with
representative
of
the
fishing
industry
this
morning
to
discuss
a
wide
range
of
issue
and
,
in
particular
,
they
concern
on
the
implementation
of
the
EU
point
system
.
on
take
office
,
I
request
that
the
Attorney
General
consider
whether
there
be
a
way
that
the
assignment
of
EU
point
for
the
licence
holder
can
await
the
completion
of
the
prosecution
process
while
at
the
same
time
ensure
Ireland
be
fully
in
compliance
with
its
obligation
under
EU
law
.
far
to
the
programme
for
government
commitment
pertain
to
the
assignment
of
point
,
I
quickly
seek
that
advice
from
the
Attorney
General
as
prescribe
in
the
document
.
have
receive
this
advice
,
I
be
satisfied
to
move
on
the
introduction
of
a
system
for
the
sequential
application
for
EU
point
in
conjunction
with
the
prosecution
process
,
thus
fulfil
the
ambition
outline
in
the
partnership
programme
and
go
to
the
heart
of
deputy
Pringle
's
concern
which
he
articulate
here
.
this
move
be
subject
to
address
some
important
legal
and
administrative
issue
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with
EU
law
.
I
have
listen
to
the
concern
of
industry
and
intend
to
report
back
to
the
Oireachtas
as
soon
as
I
have
finalise
a
way
forward
in
the
context
of
deal
with
the
legal
and
administrative
matter
that
arise
.
however
,
I
be
confident
that
this
matter
can
be
deal
with
in
a
collaborative
and
constructive
manner
with
all
stakeholder
.
Irish
fisherman
should
be
assure
that
the
State
be
take
seriously
they
concern
that
a
fishing
industry
can
be
maintain
for
they
and
that
come
after
they
.
the
conservation
of
fishing
resource
be
in
everyone
's
interest
and
be
vital
for
the
future
of
the
Irish
fishing
industry
.
I
be
confident
that
the
reform
point
system
that
I
have
announce
will
play
a
vital
role
in
act
as
a
effective
sanction
against
the
minority
who
break
the
rule
,
protect
the
vast
majority
of
we
law
abide
industry
and
preserve
the
fishing
resource
for
all
fisherman
and
for
future
generation
.
this
be
a
citizen
's
assembly
.
my
first
question
relate
to
procedural
matter
.
I
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Department
of
Health
last
week
and
I
have
be
tell
I
will
receive
a
response
from
the
HSE
within
15
day
.
I
be
always
give
to
understand
that
the
timeframe
be
ten
day
so
have
there
be
a
change
in
procedure
in
that
regard
?
I
will
do
so
but
I
be
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
House
today
.
when
will
we
see
the
consolidate
Book
of
estimate
?
have
the
revise
expenditure
benchmark
be
agree
with
the
European
Commission
?
there
be
a
issue
regard
the
working
of
the
House
.
I
will
take
that
on
board
.
I
thank
deputy
Haughey
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
I
note
neither
the
education
and
training
board
nor
the
Department
have
any
advance
notice
that
this
issue
be
likely
to
occur
.
the
City
of
Dublin
Education
and
Training
Board
have
be
work
with
target
for
a
long
time
and
,
as
the
deputy
note
,
it
have
be
provide
further
education
and
training
in
Donaghmede
for
more
than
20
year
.
it
be
locate
in
St.
Kevin
's
school
,
Newbrook
Road
,
Donaghmede
,
and
it
provide
a
wide
range
of
course
which
the
deputy
have
outline
and
I
do
not
believe
I
need
to
repeat
they
.
as
he
indicate
,
they
include
service
that
go
well
beyond
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
into
counselling
,
child
care
and
many
community
service
but
it
be
support
specifically
in
respect
of
adult
education
provision
by
the
CDETB
.
I
be
aware
of
the
pressure
of
school
enrolment
on
St.
Kevin
's
junior
school
because
it
have
experience
a
57
%
increase
in
the
period
between
2011
and
2015
and
that
trend
be
continue
.
in
that
context
,
the
school
submit
a
application
in
June
2015
to
provide
for
the
refurbishment
of
exist
space
to
create
two
classroom
-
size
space
to
create
a
mainstream
classroom
and
a
resource
room
for
special
education
.
my
Department
examine
and
approve
that
application
and
the
funding
be
provide
.
this
late
decision
by
St.

,
which
have
write

inform
it
that
the
school
be
not

,
have
come

and
obviously
create

.
I
have
be
in

and
it
will
make

discuss
the
possible
option
,
bear
in

the

exist

as
the

request
,
I
will
explore
what
solution
can
be
find
to
ascertain
whether
the

can
be
continue

as
it
have
be

a
valuable

for
a
considerable

the

receive
have
be
extremely
abrupt

as
news
and
obviously
create
difficulty
for
target
in
continue
its
work
.
I
have
be
in
touch
with
the
CDETB
and
it
will
make
contact
with
representative
of
target
to
discuss
the
possible
option
,
bear
in
mind
the
pressure
that
exist
.
as
the
deputy
request
,
I
will
explore
what
solution
can
be
find
to
ascertain
whether
the
service
can
be
continue
,
as
it
have
be
deliver
a
valuable
service
for
a
considerable
time
and
the
notice
receive
have
be
extremely
abrupt
.
I
undertake
to
pursue
this
matter
,
as
the
deputy
suggest
,
to
establish
whether
a
solution
can
be
find
that
would
allow
this
to
continue
.
while
I
do
not
have
a
specific
course
of
action
I
can
recommend
to
the
deputy
at
this
stage
,
I
thank
he
for
raise
the
matter
and
I
assure
he
I
will
give
it
attention
.
I
thank
deputy
Haughey
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
I
note
neither
the
education
and
training
board
nor
the
Department
have
any
advance
notice
that
this
issue
be
likely
to
occur
.
the
City
of
Dublin
Education
and
Training
Board
have
be
work
with
target
for
a
long
time
and
,
as
the
deputy
note
,
it
have
be
provide
further
education
and
training
in
Donaghmede
for
more
than
20
year
.
it
be
locate
in
St.
Kevin
's
school
,
Newbrook
Road
,
Donaghmede
,
and
it
provide
a
wide
range
of
course
which
the
deputy
have
outline
and
I
do
not
believe
I
need
to
repeat
they
.
as
he
indicate
,
they
include
service
that
go
well
beyond
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
into
counselling
,
child
care
and
many
community
service
but
it
be
support
specifically
in
respect
of
adult
education
provision
by
the
CDETB
.
I
be
aware
of
the
pressure
of
school
enrolment
on
St.
Kevin
's
junior
school
because
it
have
experience
a
57
%
increase
in
the
period
between
2011
and
2015
and
that
trend
be
continue
.
in
that
context
,
the
school
submit
a
application
in
June
2015
to
provide
for
the
refurbishment
of
exist
space
to
create
two
classroom
-
size
space
to
create
a
mainstream
classroom
and
a
resource
room
for
special
education
.
my
Department
examine
and
approve
that
application
and
the
funding
be
provide
.
this
late
decision
by
St.
Kevin's
,
which
have
write
to
target
inform
it
that
the
school
be
not
in
position
to
renew
the
lease
into
the
future
,
have
come
as
news
and
obviously
create
difficulty
for
target
in
continue
its
work
.
I
have
be

I

I

I

.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
time
have
be
devote
today
for
statement
on
the
summer
economic
statement
.
if
I
may
make
a
request
,
I
ask
that
at
some
stage
time
be
provide
in
the
finance
committee
or
the
budgetary
control
committee
so
we
can
have
a
more
iterative
process
and
a
question
and
answer
process
to
interrogate
the
point
make
heretofore
on
the
macroeconomic
piece
of
the
economic
statement
and
the
microeconomic
element
.
if
we
take
some
of
the
point
make
on
the
universal
social
charge
,
there
be
a
difference
in
emphasis
between
the
party
.
in
its
manifesto
,
my
party
make
a
commitment
to
abolish
the
universal
social
charge
for
the
first
€
72000
of
a
individual
's
income
.
a
school
of
thought
seem
to
be
emerge
here
,
and
whether
there
be
common
ground
to
be
find
on
the
treatment
of
the
universal
social
charge
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
remain
to
be
see
.
as
I
say
,
we
need
to
have
a
more
iterative
process
in
committee
to
discuss
how
we
can
find
some
common
ground
on
this
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
the
summer
economic
statement
as
it
relate
to
next
year
.
I
do
not
want
to
go
too
far
beyond
next
year
,
give
the
political
ferment
we
be
in
at
present
.
I
acknowledge
the
projection
,
but
the
net
message
of
the
summer
economic
statement
be
that
approximately
€300
million
be
to
be
make
available
for
additional
tax
cut
and
approximately
€600
million
be
to
be
make
available
for
additional
expenditure
in
2017
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
,
IFAC
,
have
describe
the
sum
as
a
contractional
one
.
the
ESRI
,
in
its
quarterly
economic
commentary
for
summer
2016
,
state
that
economic
growth
in
GNP
term
will
be
4.8
%
in
2016
and
4.3
%
in
2017
.
the
ESRI
have
report
a
indicative
slowdown
in
global
trade
and
point
to
the
uncertainty
surround
the
outcome
of
the
Brexit
referendum
as
have
a
adverse
impact
on
the
trade
sector
of
the
Irish
economy
.
the
ESRI
be
point
to
"
domestic
source
of
growth
,
investment
and
consumption
[
as
]
the
main
determinant
of
the
increase
expect
in
Irish
economic
activity
.
"
we
argue
at
the
last
election
for
a
ratio
of
2:1
between
investment
and
tax
reduction
.
this
seem
to
be
what
be
be
outline
in
the
summer
economic
statement
.
however
,
one
could
argue
for
a
good
ratio
in
order
to
deliver
on
the
indexation
of
welfare
payment
,
small
class
size
,
transport
infrastructure
,
health
care
and
so
on
.
consider
also
capital
investment
for
productive
purpose
,
be
they
broadband
,
school
or
road
.
if
the
government
set
up
a
rainy
day
fund
for
economic
downturn
or
externality
over
which
we
have
no
control
,
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
we
be
be
risk
averse
.
should
we
consider
invest
in
infrastructure
to
fund
economic
growth
instead
of
simply
leave
money
on
deposit
?
also
,
the
2:1
ratio
only
apply
after
the
rainy
day
fund
have
be
create
.
we
need
a
close
interrogation
of
what
the
fund
be
about
and
what
it
will
mean
.
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
the
issue
be
require
.
if
we
understand
the
proposal
of
the
rainy
day
fund
correctly
,
it
will
commit
€
1
billion
per
annum
between
2019
and
2021
.
when
will
proposal
be
tab
in
the
dáil
for
the
fund
's
creation
?
on
Tuesday
,
the
Taoiseach
tell
we
that
the
total
amount
available
to
the
government
over
the
next
five
year
be
a
estimate
cumulative
of
€
11.3
billion
.
the
space
for
2017
have
increase
to
approximately
€
1
billion
,
with
€
1.2
billion
available
in
2018
.
this
be
the
suppose
logic
for
bring
forward
spending
in
2017
for
"
infrastructure
and
social
issue
"
,
to
quote
the
Taoiseach
from
Tuesday
.
I
do
not
want
to
spend
too
much
time
discuss
the
projection
beyond
2017
,
but
we
welcome
that
relate
to
the
increase
in
capital
expenditure
.
we
wonder
whether
we
could
be
more
ambitious
in
that
regard
with
a
view
to
expansionary
economic
activity
.
since
my
colleague
have
discuss
the
public
sector
pay
element
and
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
,
I
do
not
want
to
dwell
too
much
on
they
,
but
we
in
the
committee
debate
the
2016
estimate
yesterday
and
it
be
we
view
that
,
if
the
promise
of
a
new
budgetary
architecture
be
to
mean
anything
in
term
of
a
truly
collaborative
approach
to
governance
where
the
primacy
of
this
House
superseede
that
of
the
executive
,
there
must
be
a
good
consultative
process
for
budget
2017
.
if
the
House
rise
in
July
and
return
in
the
autumn
,
the
space
for
such
a
discussion
be
limit
.
we
want
to
interrogate
further
whether
there
be
common
ground
to
be
have
between
party
on
budget
2017
,
particularly
regard
the
taxation
on
work
side
.
we
feel
that
there
be
great
scope
for
more
capital
expenditure
.
although
we
acknowledge
the
increase
,
there
be
a
positive
multiplier
effect
.
the
programme
for
government
include
clear
commitment
on
regional
economic
growth
and
target
for
the
number
of
job
that
it
seek
to
create
outside
of
the
Dublin
area
.
if
one
be
realistic
about
that
job
creation
,
though
,
one
need
a
Atlantic
corridor
strategy
that
link
the
three
main
city
beyond
Dublin
,
namely
,
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
.
issue
of
connectivity
between
the
three
must
be
consider
,
include
capital
expenditure
on
road
infrastructure
,
if
the
job
creation
target
of
130000
plus
outside
of
Dublin
be
to
be
achieve
during
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
we
need
to
get
away
from
the
anachronistic
policy
provision
whereby
there
be
a
increase
in
expenditure
every
year
via
a
revise
estimate
present
to
the
House
relate
to
,
for
instance
,
health
.
we
be
all
of
the
view
that
,
if
a
department
be
allocate
a
amount
of
money
for
a
year
,
justify
a
revise
estimate
for
same
should
be
difficult
if
the
people
within
the
Department
have
already
make
spending
projection
.
we
go
through
this
choreography
and
pageantry
around
revise
estimate
every
year
.
if
we
be
to
examine
performance
and
reform
within
the
public
sector
,
we
must
determine
how
to
move
away
from
the
architecture
of
revise
estimate
.
if
we
be
consider
budgetary
arithmetic
in
a
truly
collaborative
fashion
,
we
should
seek
to
ensure
that
Department
have
enough
money
to
do
the
job
that
they
need
to
do
.
we
must
be
a
bit
more
lateral
in
we
thinking
.
the
summer
economic
statement
be
a
point
-
in
-
time
assessment
of
where
we
stand
now
and
speak
to
the
challenge
ahead
.
we
must
devote
more
time
in
committee
to
delv
into
how
the
multi-annual
expenditure
ceiling
will
operate
,
how
the
publication
of
the
update
public
spending
code
will
operate
and
what
the
establishment
of
the
Irish
government
economic
and
evaluation
Service
,
IGEES
,
mean
to
the
allocation
of
public
money
in
term
of
great
level
of
transparency
and
efficiency
.
evidence
-
base
decision
making
so
as
to
ensure
that
we
spend
public
money
in
way
that
will
be
of
maximum
benefit
to
the
people
of
Ireland
be
vital
.
the
summer
economic
statement
make
reference
to
the
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.
it
be
propose
that
the
minimum
wage
be
increase
to
€
10.50
per
hour
over
the
next
five
year
.
I
hope
that
we
could
have
a
further
discussion
about
this
proposal
in
committee
.
for
example
,
how
be
the
low
pay
Commission
propose
to
operate
?
the
Labour
Party
have
argue
for
a
living
wage
and
have
clear
proposal
on
how
this
can
be
achieve
.
to
we
mind
,
the
sum
of
€
10.50
after
five
year
be
not
where
we
want
to
go
,
give
that
the
House
pass
a
motion
on
1
June
that
support
the
call
for
a
programme
of
incremental
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
until
it
be
peg
at
60
%
of
median
earnings
and
for
a
living
wage
of
€
11.50
per
hour
to
be
adopt
throughout
the
public
sector
.
there
be
a
clear
statement
by
the
House
,
agree
by
all
party
,
that
contradict
the
summer
economic
statement
.
if
we
be
in
the
paradigm
of
new
politics
,
we
must
respect
the
fact
that
there
be
a
clear
motion
that
be
the
majority
view
.
I
want
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
make
a
very
specific
reference
to
public
service
pay
.
he
remind
the
House
that
"
the
programme
for
government
contain
a
specific
commitment
to
establish
a
public
service
pay
commission
to
examine
pay
level
across
the
public
service
,
include
entry
level
of
pay
.
"
we
welcome
that
proposal
.
we
await
the
detail
of
the
establishment
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
it
be
fair
to
ask
when
the
commission
will
be
establish
.
what
will
its
exact
remit
be
?
how
will
it
be
constitute
?
will
it
include
member
of
the
trade
union
movement
?
how
be
it
propose
to
deal
with
entry
level
of
pay
?
I
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Calleary
early
with
regard
to
the
statement
make
today
by
gardaí
on
restoration
of
pay
for
new
entrant
.
it
be
important
that
we
deal
with
this
issue
and
find
a
mechanism
through
which
a
positive
outcome
can
be
achieve
for
new
entrant
.
I
would
welcome
a
further
discussion
on
the
local
investment
fund
at
the
relevant
line
committee
.
we
need
a
further
interrogation
of
what
this
€200
million
fund
will
deliver
in
2017
.
it
be
not
entirely
clear
how
individual
local
authority
will
compete
for
this
remarkable
pot
of
money
.
I
think
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
increase
in
capital
expenditure
.
we
would
like
to
interrogate
further
with
the
line
minister
each
of
the
point
raise
here
today
.
perhaps
that
can
happen
on
a
cross
-party
basis
as
part
of
a
iterative
process
.
we
need
to
move
beyond
the
tribe
.
if
the
paradigm
shift
in
relation
to
how
we
do
business
in
this
house
be
to
be
meaningful
,
we
must
take
a
collaborative
approach
to
reach
consensus
on
policy
provision
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
30
June
2016
.
the
deputy
be
on
the
same
side
as
the
Tories
.
my
question
be
on
the
same
issue
relate
to
Thursday
.
could
time
be
make
available
in
respect
of
the
obligatory
report
on
the
continuation
or
not
of
the
FEMPI
legislation
?
it
be
pertinent
at
this
time
.
in

I
raise
this
issue
yesterday
and
we
hope
to
get
a
answer
to
the
same
question
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
-----
that
be
fine
.
I
will
be
finish
well
before
then
.
I
start
by
congratulate
the
minister
on

appointment
as
I
have
not
yet
formally
do
so
.
the
Labour

welcome

Bill
,
which
be
introduce
by
the
minister
's
predecessor
in
the
Seanad
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
mandate
.
we
welcome
the
power
to
apply
administrative
sanction
which
it
be
propose
to
give
the
cer
so
as
to
reflect
change
in

.
we

.
we
also
acknowledge
the

so
as

we
have
some
minor
query
,
which
the
minister
might
address
.
will
the
minister
,
in
he
reply
,
give
we
some
insight
into
the
role
and
remit
of
the
CRU
after
water

have
be
suspend
?
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
regard
the
market
provision
regard
the
North
-
South
interconnector
?
where
do
the
North
-
South
interconnector
project
stand
?
will
the
integrate
single
energy
market
be
complete
by
the
end
of
2017
?
we
welcome
the
part
5
change
regard
the
restatement
in
primary
legislation
of
remit
penalty
.
the
harmonisation
of
penalty
on
a
par
with
neighbour
jurisdiction
be
desirable
.
although
it
be
not
within
the
remit
of
the
Bill
,
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
,
give
the
vagary
of
the
House
and
the
normal
course
of
action
whereby
we
take
some
indulgence
on
second
stage
speech
,
not
to
mention
Whitegate
oil
refinery
in
my
constituency
,
which
employ
approximately
155
worker
.
the
obligation
to
operate
the
refinery
end
in
July
and
we
be
all
very
conscious
of
the
potential
of
the
site
to
ensure
security
of
supply
.
we
be
very
conscious
of
the
need
for
decarbonisation
and
the
associate
target
.
we
obligation
under
transport
for
deliver
non-carbon
additive
,
for
example
,
could
be
realise
within
a
site
such
as
Whitegate
if
the
State
can
maintain
a
relationship
with
potential
buyer
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
keep
the
line
of
communication
open
and
see
if
there
be
possibility
to
partner
strategically
with
any
potential
buyer
of
the
site
in
the
future
to
ensure
we
meet
we
biofuel
obligation
.
this
be
just
one
element
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
maintain
a
strategic
site
on
this
island
for
the
provision
of
carbon
-
base
fuel
,
which
will
be
a
feature
of
we
economy
and
society
for
many
year
to
come
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
the
Bill
,
which
we
will
support
.
there
may
be
a
opportunity
for
we
in
the
House
with
the
new
minister
to
demystify
the
energy
market
and
try
to
distil
the
language
we
use
when
we
discuss
energy
production
into
language
that
be
easily
understandable
by
consumer
.
Consumer
,
myself
include
give
that
I
be
new
to
this
remit
,
see
the
public
service
obligation
,
PSO
,
on
they
bill
.
we
refer
to
the
market
mechanism
,
market
clear
mechanism
,
system
marginal
price
,
refit
scheme
and
pso
.
we
could
work
on
a
cross-party
basis
in
the
House
to
distil
the
language
down
,
particularly
regard
issue
where
there
be
sensitivity
regard
,
for
example
,
the
provision
of
pylon
,
wind
energy
and
,
now
,
solar
energy
,
which
be
gain
more
prevalence
in
we
landscape
.
if
we
can
distil
the
language
of
energy
production
,
we
can
assist
consumer
and
people
live
in
community
to
understand
well
the
dynamic
of
the
market
as
it
relate
to
they
as
consumer
.
there
be
a
job
of
work
to
be
do
and
a
challenge
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
and
will
support
it
.

it
be
Leinster
House
now
,
be
it
?
but
what
be
go
to
be
roll
out
be
.
finance
by
the
taxpayer
.
I
welcome
the
motion
before
the
House
.
I
have
some
technical
question
to
ask
and
will
also
request
a
further
discussion
on
this
issue
here
to
discuss
the
more
technical
aspect
of
this
plan
.
perhaps
that
could
be
do
outside
the
committee
structure
because
every
member
of
the
House
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
issue
and
,
while
not
necessarily
be
member
of
the
relevant
committee
,
they
may
be
spokesperson
in
that
area
.
that
be
the
new
paradigm
we
be
in
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
option
that
be
place
before
the
minister
be
whittle
down
to
two
.
the
first
,
which
the
government
choose
,
be
the
commercial
stimulus
or
gap
-
funding
model
whereby
the
private
sector
finances
,
design
,
build
,
own
and
operate
the
network
.
there
be
contractual
obligation
within
that
model
.
second
,
there
be
the
full
concession
model
whereby
the
private
sector
again
finances
,
design
,
build
and
operate
the
network
,
but
the
asset
be
hand
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
.
my
understanding
be
that
go
for
the
full
concession
model
,
involve
a
reversion
of
the
asset
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
,
would
have
have
implication
in
put
the
entire
cost
of
the
project
on
balance
sheet
.
there
would
therefore
have
be
a
impact
on
fiscal
space
.
I
do
not
hear
the
minister
's
open
remark
but
I
think
he
refer
to
deputy
Howlin
's
early
intervention
about
certain
choice
that
have
to
be
make
by
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
I
will
not
get
into
a
political
tit
for
tat
on
that
.
however
,
the
logic
of
opt
for
the
fully
privatise
or
gap
-
funding
model
be
that
the
fiscal
space
would
not
be
cover
by
the
Exchequer
's
capital
funding
envelope
.
I
be
seek
a
discussion
on
the
KPMG
report
which
advise
the
gap
-
funding
model
.
what
be
the
legal
advice
in
real
term
for
opt
against
the
full
concession
model
?
I
be
tell
-
and
,
to
be
fair
,
the
Department
have
be
open
about
this
-
that
the
full
concession
model
be
deem
to
be
significantly
more
complex
from
a
contractual
perspective
.
in
addition
,
it
would
take
six
month
or
possibly
long
to
negotiate
a
contract
.
one
try
to
be
as
factual
as
one
can
but
if
one
go
to
a
company
like
KPMG
,
or
another
external
adviser
in
the
private
sector
,
on
the
law
of
average
they
be
not
necessarily
go
to
say
that
one
should
come
back
with
a
model
that
revert
the
asset
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
.
that
be
why
I
want
to
have
a
further
discussion
on
this
matter
which
warrant
further
investigation
.
the
KPMG
report
present
argument
in
favour
of
the
commercial
stimulus
model
.
a
departmental
document
state
that
this
model
place
all
the
technology
and
demand
risk
on
the
private
sector
,
while
cost
the
Exchequer
less
.
in
addition
,
the
asset
will
rely
extensively
on
commercially
-
own
third
-
party
asset
which
will
not
be
within
the
control
of
government
.
that
be
one
of
the
consideration
which
warrant
further
discussion
.
there
be
cross-party
support
for
this
motion
and
we
all
have
myriad
example
in
we
own
constituency
.
however
,
anything
we
do
now
could
be
surpass
by
new
technology
in
the
provision
of
broadband
.
we
do
not
know
what
kind
of
technology
will
exist
in
25
year
's
time
.
I
be
not
breach
the
minister
's
confidence
in
say
that
we
have
a
discussion
on
this
matter
previously
;
it
be
a
open
conversation
.
if
new
infrastructure
be
be
create
and
the
State
be
invest
in
it
,
a
more
conservative
view
would
be
to
retain
the
network
in
State
ownership
because
we
do
not
know
what
will
happen
technologically
downstream
.
that
would
be
a
more
cautious
approach
.
be
there
be
a
mechanism
to
have
a
discussion
here
on
how
we
would
fund
the
cost
of
the
full
concession
model
over
a
long
period
than
the
five
or
six
year
we
be
talk
about
?
we
can
only
talk
in
limited
term
about
the
future
fiscal
space
but
if
the
capital
envelope
go
from
approximately
€
275
million
up
to
€600
million
,
which
may
be
the
true
cost
,
be
there
room
for
such
a
discussion
?
this
be
particularly
relevant
give
we
relationship
with
the
EU
at
present
and
give
the
new
political
reality
that
exist
with
the
EU
.
I
know
the
minister
will
say
that
this
would
slow
down
the
process
.
I
do
appreciate
that
point
and
I
be
not
try
to
score
political
point
.
I
note
deputy
Stanley
's
reference
to
a
Labour
U
-
turn
,
but
in
fact
there
be
no
U
-
turn
on
this
.
we
be
,
however
,
try
to
have
as
broad
a
discussion
as
possible
so
that
we
can
future
-
proof
what
we
be
create
now
.
in
that
way
,
we
will
not
give
something
away
which
we
might
have
be
able
,
with
foresight
,
to
retain
as
a
public
asset
.
that
be
the
logic
of
what
I
be
propose
.
however
,
we
will
support
the
amendment
.
give
that
the
scheme
have
now
be
announce
and
agree
at
cabinet
,
I
do
not
know
if
the
scheme
have
any
legal
standing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
Parliament
will
make
its
own
voice
hear
on
this
issue
.
the
scheme
will
proceed
as
agree
by
the
government
in
the
final
analysis
.
nonetheless
,
there
be
a
opportunity
to
have
a
more
detailed
discussion
about
the
KPMG
aspect
,
and
the
full
concession
model
versus
the
gap
-
funding
model
.
I
would
like
we
to
have
that
discussion
in
a
more
detailed
forum
.
the
select
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
have
complete
its
consideration
of
the
Paternity
leave
and
Benefit
Bill
2016
and
have
make
amendment
thereto
.

look

for
that
who
do
not

a

take

off
.
there
be
some
quizzical
glance
at
the
Taoiseach
when
he
mention
a
PTO
early
.
I
say
this
as
much
to
be
helpful
to
that
be
not
of
a
agricultural
disposition
.
I
wish
to
ask
a
question
on
promise
legislation
,
in
particular
,
the
Greyhound
Industry
(
amendment
)
Bill
,
the
Broadcasting
(

Bill
and
the
Geothermal
Energy
Bill
.
in
conclusion
-
I
be
within
the
timeframe
-
and
on
a
serious
note
I
wish
to
inform
the
House
that
there
be
a
fire
at
the
Patrician
Academy
post
-
primary
school
in
the
early
hour
of
this

.
will
the

the

Education
and
Skill
make
all
resource
available
to
ensure
that
temporary
accommodation
will
be
set
up
in
advance
of
the
school
year
in
September
and
that
all
resource
be
deploy
?
I
be
delighted
to
be
able
to
raise
this
matter
.
today
,
at
3
a.m.
,
a
serious
fire
engulf
the
Patrician
Academy
post
-
primary
boy
's
school
in
Mallow
,
County
Cork
.
it
cause
extensive
damage
to
the
administrative
block
,
science
lab
,
technical
draw
and
woodwork
room
and
computer
facility
.
the
building
date
from
1886
.
the
school
be
establish
by
the
Patrician
Brother
and
have
since
be
laicise
.
the
fire
cause
such
extensive
damage
that
adjoin
residential
premise
be
evacuate
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
.
in
the
meantime
the
Garda
have
confirm
that
a
technical
examination
of
the
site
be
under
way
.
in
raise
the
matter
I
recognise
that
it
will
take
considerable
time
to
move
to
construction
phase
and
that
people
be
still
get
over
the
shock
of
what
happen
last
night
.
the
school
community
still
feel
very
raw
about
it
,
but
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Education
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
once
the
school
community
,
the
principal
and
the
board
of
management
make
formal
contact
with
the
Department
,
if
emergency
accommodation
can
be
provide
in
advance
of
the
start
of
the
new
school
year
in
September
.
Parent
,
the
principal
,
the
teacher
and
the
community
be
very
anxious
not
to
be
leave
without
at
least
temporary
accommodation
,
particularly
for
that
student
who
will
be
face
into
state
examination
from
September
onwards
.
I
be
,
therefore
,
raise
the
issue
to
ask
that
this
resource
be
make
available
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
speak
to
I
today
about
the
matter
.
I
recognise
that
there
be
quite
a
number
of
issue
that
will
have
to
be
go
through
,
include
insurance
,
investigation
,
etc.
,
but
I
be
hopeful
the
Department
will
prioritise
this
project
.
we
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
a
considerable
degree
of
capital
investment
in
the
school
in
the
recent
past
,
include
the
provision
of
a
autism
unit
,
as
well
as
additional
classroom
.
I
be
hopeful
,
therefore
,
that
at
least
in
the
short
term
,
pend
further
planning
for
the
rebuild
and
future
-
proofing
of
the
school
,
emergency
accommodation
will
be
provide
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
,
once
the
school
make
formal
contact
with
the
Department
,
the
matter
will
be
expedite
.
I
be
very
grateful
to
the
minister
for
he
response
and
he
official
for
the
contact
that
have
be
make
with
the
school
authority
,
particularly
the
school
principal
,
Ms
Catherine
Fitzpatrick
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
fact
that
official
will
undertake
a
site
visit
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
proactive
response
and
I
be
assure
by
he
statement
that
provision
will
be
make
for
the
emergency
or
temporary
accommodation
that
will
be
necessary
from
September
onwards
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
if
the
unaligned
deputy
present
themselves
,
I
will
be
happy
to
share
time
with
they
.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
agree
that
au
pair
hosting
be
a
valuable
tradition
.
it
can
benefit
both
host
family
and
young
foreign
visitor
who
be
help
in
a
domestic
environment
to
improve
language
skill
and
enjoy
a
positive
cultural
experience
.
none
of
we
want
to
undermine
the
viability
of
genuine
au
pair
arrangement
,
but
we
must
recognise
there
be
two
side
to
this
story
.
not
all
experience
be
mutually
beneficial
.
we
must
also
recognise
that
this
Bill
,
no
matter
how
it
be
present
,
be
aim
at
remove
statutory
protection
that
be
currently
enjoy
.
until
now
,
au
pair
have
not
be
treat
as
a
separate
category
of
worker
in
we
employment
law
.
if
there
be
a
agreement
to
do
work
,
regardless
of
what
title
one
give
the
worker
,
he
or
she
be
entitle
to
the
benefit
of
we
employment
protection
law
,
include
on
the
national
minimum
wage
.
a
realistic
debate
on
this
issue
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
on
the
ground
.
it
seem
clear
that
in
many
case
au
pair
be
be
use
as
underpaid
domestic
worker
because
of
we
crisis
in
child
care
provision
.
for
example
,
last
year
's
survey
by
migrant
Right
Centre
Ireland
show
a
age
profile
for
au
pair
that
do
not
match
the
popular
perception
.
it
show
that
37
%
have
no
contract
at
all
and
40
%
a
verbal
contract
only
.
some
20
%
have
pay
a
fee
to
get
the
job
,
38
%
be
expect
to
work
more
than
originally
agree
,
31
%
have
be
ask
to
work
when
they
be
sick
,
58
%
be
pay
€
120
or
less
per
week
,
one
in
ten
do
not
have
she
own
bedroom
,
and
one
in
five
be
expect
to
be
on
call
at
night
.
a
balance
be
need
here
.
on
the
one
hand
,
au
pair
relationship
be
unique
and
deserve
to
be
foster
.
I
agree
that
the
allowance
for
provide
board
and
lodging
,
which
can
be
deduct
from
the
minimum
wage
but
which
be
last
properly
examine
in
2000
,
need
to
be
review
urgently
.
on
the
other
hand
,
I
do
not
believe
the
good
way
to
regularise
activity
in
the
sector
be
simply
to
exempt
individual
who
be
legally
employ
on
a
employer
–employee
basis
from
we
entire
suite
of
employment
rights
legislation
.
one
should
remember
that
,
traditionally
understand
,
au
pair
be
here
primarily
to
improve
they
English
.
they
stay
here
as
language
student
and
the
domestic
setting
be
a
adjunct
to
the
time
spend
in
a
language
school
or
college
.
it
be
important
to
bear
this
in
mind
when
consider
how
much
time
a
au
pair
should
be
require
to
devote
to
what
this
Bill
describe
as
"
light
domestic
duty
"
.
section
2
(
1
)
(
b
)
of
the
legislation
state
a
criterion
for
placement
be
that
one
''
be
a
non-citizen
of
the
EU
ordinarily
resident
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
with
a
student
entry
visa
as
prescribe
by
ministerial
Order
under
the
Immigration
Act
2004
.
"
we
immigration
law
restrict
part
-
time
student
to
work
no
more
than
20
hour
per
week
.
I
see
no
reason
we
should
expect
au
pair
to
work
long
than
other
student
for
less
pay
in
a
entirely
unprotected
statutory
environment
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
study
that
bring
they
here
in
the
first
place
.
the
objective
of
the
Bill
be
inadequate
.
for
example
,
it
propose
a
au
pair
accreditation
council
to
perform
important
statutory
function
but
it
do
not
make
any
provision
in
respect
of
the
membership
of
the
council
,
who
get
to
appoint
the
member
and
to
whom
they
be
accountable
.
the
Bill
do
not
explicitly
state
au
pair
be
exempt
from
minimum
wage
legislation
,
which
I
presume
be
its
central
purpose
and
the
reason
for
the
reference
to
''
pocket
money
''
.
there
be
so
many
question
raise
but
leave
unanswered
by
this
Bill
that
my
party
and
I
cannot
support
it
.
it
seem
to
we
to
be
design
more
to
meet
the
demand
of
that
in
the
au
pair
sector
who
want
light
alternative
regulation
rather
than
register
as
employment
agency
than
it
be
design
to
meet
the
need
of
family
or
au
pair
themselves
.
perhaps
the
deputy
who
be
propose
the
Bill
might
respond
to
that
.
I
do
not
make
that
point
as
a
charge
.
we
be
all
inherently
in
favour
of
what
the
sector
deliver
for
family
and
the
au
pair
themselves
in
term
of
the
experience
they
gain
.
however
,
we
want
to
ensure
we
have
the
right
motive
when
present
legislation
of
this
nature
.
it
may
be
that
wholesale
amendment
could
improve
the
Bill
but
we
would
not
in
any
circumstance
support
a
legislative
regime
bring
in
simply
to
ensure
foreign
au
pair
could
be
use
in
a
unprotected
way
as
a
resource
to
meet
a
need
that
be
not
be
meet
within
the
domestic
labour
market
.

in
the
few
minute
available
,
I
wish
to
crystallise
my
interpretation
of
this
issue
as
good
I
can
.
I
represent
part
of
the
county
of
Cork
and
many
of
my
constituent
work
for
Apple
.
there
be
no
doubt
,
base
on
the
feedback
I
have
receive
,
that
there
be
concern
for
the
long
-
term
future
of
Apple
and
other
FDI
company
locate
in
the
Cork
region
in
particular
.
there
be
concern
about
the
possible
effect
of
the
commission
's
ruling
on
long
-
term
investment
on
Irish
soil
and
on
we
ability
to
sustain
the
employment
that
already
exist
not
only
in
Cork
but
also
throughout
the
republic
as
a
whole
.
member
must
distinguish
between
what
be
interpret
as
a
breach
of
state
aid
rule
,
on
one
hand
,
and
a
overreaching
by
the
European
Commission
into
the
sovereign
affair
of
a
member
state
on
a
matter
of
taxation
policy
,
on
the
other
.
I
have
be
try
to
get
to
the
nub
of
the
issue
and
there
be
a
very
good
blog
post
by
Mr.
Tony
Connelly
of
RTE
which
outline
what
be
at
play
here
.
he
argue
that
for
a
tax
concession
such
as
that
give
to
Apple
to
qualify
as
illegal
state
aid
,
four
criterion
must
be
fulfil
.
the
aid
"
must
be
provide
by
the
state
and
finance
by
state
resource
"
-
that
be
questionable
.
it
must
"
grant
advantage
"
.
do
it
grant
advantage
to
other
company
in
a
similar
sector
?
the
advantage
must
be
"
selective
"
,
that
be
,
"
it
go
to
one
company
or
one
category
of
company
with
a
specific
commercial
activity
,
and
not
to
other
"
.
finally
,
it
must
"
distort
competition
and
trade
within
the
EU
"
.
if
it
do
not
meet
that
four
criterion
,
then
arguably
,
the
ruling
should
fall
and
there
be
question
around
whether
that
criterion
be
be
apply
objectively
as
they
relate
to
the
treaty
of
the
European
Union
.
I
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
US
Treasury
Department
's
white
paper
,
which
be
issue
on
24
August
and
which
be
entitle
,
the
European
Commission
's
Recent
State
Aid
Investigation
of
transfer
pricing
Rulings
.
this
document
make
the
follow
very
pertinent
point
:
there
be
the
possibility
that
any
repayment
order
by
the
commission
will
be
consider
foreign
income
tax
that
be
creditable
against
U.S.
tax
owe
by
the
company
in
the
Unite
State
.
if
so
,
the
company
'
U.S.
tax
liability
would
be
reduce
dollar
for
dollar
by
this
recovery
when
they
offshore
earnings
be
repatriate
or
treat
as
repatriate
as
part
of
possible
U.S.
tax
reform
.
to
the
extent
that
such
foreign
tax
be
impose
on
income
that
should
not
have
be
attributable
to
the
relevant
Member
State
,
that
outcome
be
deeply
troubling
,
as
it
would
effectively
constitute
a
transfer
of
revenue
to
the
EU
from
the
U.S.
government
and
its
taxpayer
.
it
go
on
to
say
:
adopt
new
enforcement
regime
with
retroactive
effect
will
hinder
company
's
ability
to
assess
risk
and
plan
for
the
future
,
and
set
a
unwelcome
precedent
for
tax
authority
around
the
world
to
take
similar
retroactive
action
that
could
affect
U.S.
and
EU
company
alike
.
it
also
undermine
the
G20
agenda
to
improve
tax
certainty
.
there
be
a
battleground
here
and
that
battleground
be
Ireland
.
this
country
be
be
use
as
a
battleground
between
the
European
Union
and
the
Unite
State
of
America
to
see
who
can

there
be
a
pertinent
political
point
here
as
to
whether
the
commission
be
perceive
to
be
reach
into
the
sovereignty
of
a

there

aid
tool

there

for

one
involve
the
Spanish
bank

Europe
be
move
to
the
extreme
right
at
present
and
while
Ireland
,
as
a
nation
,
have
always
be
vehemently
pro-European
,
there
be
a
perception
that
the
European
Commission
be
overreach
in
this
particular
case
.
the
Revenue
commissioner
have
state
clearly
that
there
be
no
departure
from
the
applicable
Irish
tax
law
.
there
be
some
in
this
House
who
do
not
want
to
believe
the
chairman
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
and
that
be
fair
enough
,
particularly
if
they
want
to
make
a
political
point
in
that
regard
.
I
accept
the
statement
by
the
Chairman
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
Revenue
be
a
independent
statutory
body

we

this

on
public
sector
pay
,
the
Minister
for
Public

incorrectly
state
:
"
today
's
budget
include
the
provision
of
€290
million
for
pay
increase
agree
under
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
.
"
I
would
like
to
nail
that
lie
.
the
provision
relate
to
the
restoration
of
pay
.
it
be
important
that
the
impression
not
be
convey
from
this
House
that
it
be
for
pay
increase
;
it
be
for
a
hard
fight
for
restoration
of
pay
by
the
former
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
.
this
be
a
budget
that
misdirect
resource
in
its
scatter
-
gun
approach
.
it
provide
a
additional
€
50
million
plus
for
child
care
service
and
over
€
25
million
for
a
sheep
scheme
.
it
do
very
little
by
way
of
a
impact
on
child
care
.
I
refer
to
deputy
Joan
Burton
's
contribution
and
what
could
have
be
do
in
that
regard
.
the
Labour
Party
's
budget
submission
be
cost
on
the
basis
of
the
parameter
provide
for
last
week
,
notwithstand
the
additional
€200
million
that
have
be
find
.
for
example
,
as
propose
in
the
Labour
Party
's
submission
,
for
a
additional
€
177
million
we
could
have
a
universal
child
care
scheme
for
child
under
12
year
,
at
a
cost
of
€
71
million
,
and
a
cap
on
the
cost
to
parent
at
€
4.25
per
hour
for
up
to
40
hour
a
week
.
this
would
have
a
real
impact
.
what
we
have
instead
be
a
opaque
scheme
,
subject
to
publication
of
the
detail
,
which
provide
for
subsidise
child
care
from
September
2017
for
parent
earn
under
€
47000
,
up
to
a
figure
of
€
8,000
for
child
from
six
month
to
15
year
old
,
and
a
€900
subsidy
for
that
on
a
combine
income
above
€
47000
.
if
the
budgetary
process
be
to
mean
anything
,
this
detail
should
have
be
furnish
to
we
.
if
we
be
about
ensure
a
more
collaborative
dáil
in
check
the
power
of
the
cabinet
,
we
should
have
have
the
real
detail
in
order
to
engage
in
a
critique
of
it
today
and
receive
a
early
response
in
that
regard
.
the
additional
spend
of
€
35
million
on
child
care
service
be
not
very
imaginative
when
one
consider
that
,
as
I
say
,
€
25
million
be
be
provide
for
the
sheep
sector
.
this
speak
to
the
imbalance
in
the
government
's
priority
.
the
minister
do
not
refer
to
upskil
that
involve
in
the
child
care
sector
.
within
the
envelope
of
€
177
million
he
could
,
for
example
,
have
create
a
living
wage
of
€
11.50
per
hour
for
all
child
care
worker
,
at
a
cost
of
€
62
million
approximately
.
he
could
also
have
provide
for
a
additional
four
week
of
paternity
leave
,
at
a
cost
of
€
42
million
.
the
Labour
Party
propose
a
set
of
measure
which
,
instead
of
provide
for
a
piecemeal
reduction
in
the
USC
that
will
have
no
real
knock
-
on
effect
in
quality
of
life
for
people
,
would
have
enable
the
government
to
invest
taxpayer
hard
earn
tax
in
the
delivery
of
a
more
comprehensive
child
care
sector
which
would
have
provide
for
the
upskilling
of
worker
,
proper
wage
for
that
within
the
sector
,
opportunity
to
engage
in
continue
professional
development
and
for
a
great
degree
of
universality
.
I
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
degree
of
universality
in
what
the
minister
be
propose
,
but
we
want
to
see
the
detail
.
it
would
have
be
good
to
have
have

when
one
weigh
up
the
increase
in

Christmas
bonus
and
look
at
the
€

increase
for
that
on
the
pension
,
it
amount
to
a
increase
over

full
52
week
of
€
271
.
person
from
Fianna
Fáil
go
out
and
do
battle
for
the
€5
increase
.
the
net
result
of
this
Fianna
Fáil
-
Fine
Gael
budget
will
be
a
total
net
increase
,
when
one
add
in
the
Christmas
bonus
and
the
€
5
from
1
March
,
of
€245
.
in
fact
,
the
cumulative
or
net
increase
in
2017
be
less
than
the
net
increase
in
2016
.
that
be
not
take
into
account
the
increase
in
the
fuel
allowance
last
year
,
which
I
see
no
evidence
of
this
year
.
let
we
look
at
health
.
where
be
the
money
that
will
follow
a
Vision
for
Change
?
where
be
the
money
for
mental
health
?
the
former
minister
of
State
,
Kathleen
Lynch
,
do
battle
internally
and
with
we
friend
in
Fine
Gael
to
protect
a
mental
health
budget
but
I
see
no
real
monetary
mention
of
in
this
budget
today
.
let
we
look
at
what
the
Labour
Party
would
have
provide
for
€375
million
.
we
would
have
reduce
prescription
charge
.
we
would
have
look
at
the
recruitment
of
early
intervention
team
for
all
child
with
disability
.
we
would
have
put
in
place
a
extra
780
staff
across
the
discipline
every
year
to
clear
the
backlog
.
we
would
have
employ
more
occupational
therapist
.
we
would
have
put
€
18.2
million
into
home
care
package
and
build
out
a
extra
1.3
million
home
help
hour
at
a
cost
of
€
20
million
.
we
see
no
evidence
of
real
increase
in
the
number
of
home
help
hour
provide
by
this
government
.
we
do
not
know
what
to
tell
people
who
be
care
for
other
.
if
they
look
at
the
budget
,
they
will
find
nothing
in
it
of
benefit
to
they
.
that
be
extremely
disappointing
.
I
refer
to
mental
health
early
.
we
would
have
provide
€
7
million
for
good
mental
health
,
which
would
have
provide
more
access
to
counselling
for
16
to
25
year
old
.
we
would
have
extend
the
Jigsaw
programme
to
five
further
location
at
a
cost
of
€
4
million
and
we
would
have
ring
-
fence
mental
health
funding
.
for
€
200000
,
the
government
could
have
hire
25
specialist
suicide
prevention
nurse
.
we
be
not
see
evidence
of
that
in
this
budget
today
.
we
do
not
even
see
a
nod
towards
the
issue
of
mental
health
in
term
of
real
and
concrete
proposal
.
do
we
have
to
wait
for
the
national
service
plan
,
of
which
the
HSE
have
ownership
through
the
Department
of
Health
,
for
that
?
what
we
would
have
love
to
have
see
be
some
degree
of
exploration
of
the
vision
around
mental
health
from
either
of
the
Minister
who
speak
.
deputy
Joan
Burton
refer
to
sport
,
which
be
inherently
tie
to
mental
health
.
if
one
look
at
the
figure
of
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
one
see
a
actual
net
decrease
in
the
investment
in
sport
.
the
minister
say
he
be
go
to
announce
a
sport
capital
scheme
.
while
such
a
scheme
would
be
very
welcome
in
most
community
throughout
the
country
,
it
can
only
go
so
far
.
we
must
align
a
great
degree
of
investment
in
sport
,
include
minority
sport
,
with
mental
health
.
we
must
also
ensure
that
a
vision
for
change
be
implement
in
full
.
let
we
look
at
health
in
the
round
.
there
be

million

which
be
a

figure

I
wonder
if
it
will
really
have
a
impact
on

that
will
not
clear
the
backlog
.
it
will
have
no
impact
at
all
in
real
term
and
it
go
to
the
point
I
make
at
the
outset
of
my
intervention
that
if
one
spread
oneself
too
thinly
and
try
to
be
all
thing
to
all
people
,
one
will
deliver
nothing
in
term
of
real
impact
for
the
vast
majority
on
the
ground
.
if
the
budget
have
focus
on
significant
investment
in
child
care
,
it
would
not
have
pleased
all
the
people
but
it
would
at
least
have
go
some
way
towards
effect
societal
change
.
it
would
have
go
back
to
the
idea
that
people
should
derive
some
benefit
from
the
hard

earn
tax
they
pay
.

we
look
at

there

that
be
not

as
such
,
I
would
not

as

I

how
the
figure
go
to

I
be
sure
there
will
be
some
engagement
on
it
in

.
for
the

we
be
go
to

we
would
,
inter

,
have

the

could
have

it

in

something
beyond
the
mere

be
require
.
we
all
recognise
that
every
budget
allow
for
demographic
change
but
it
be
necessary
to
be
a
little
bit
more
imaginative
than
that
.
that
be
why
there
be
a
sense
of
disappointment
on
this
side
of
the
House
in
regard
to
education
where
more
could
have
be
do
.
postgraduate
grant
could
have
be
reinstate

.
it
would
have
cost

40

and
have
a

,

could
have
be
provide
to

.
the
full
cost
of
that
measure
over
time
would
be
approximately
€
100
million
.
this
be
a
budget
which
have
fail
to
deliver
a
significant
impact
for
most
people
.
it
be
telegrap
to
we
early
this
morning
and
most
people
will
have
find
that
it
fail
to
deliver
much
by
way
of
a
societal
impact
.
it
be
not
deliver
a
whole
pile
in
term
of
they
income
.
they
will
not
feel
a
increase
in
they
income
as
a
result
of
the
budget
and
they
will
not
feel
a
increase
in
the
level
of
service
for
which
they
have
pay
heavily
through
taxation
.
that
be
why
we
be
say
it
lack
imagination
in
term
of
what
could
have
be
do
.
in
term
of
the
concept
of
decency
at
work
,
the
government
could
have
change
the
mandate
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
we
propose
a
target
of
a
minimum
wage
of
60
%
of
the
median
earnings
by
2021
to
deliver
a
living
wage
for
all
.
instead
,
what
we
get
be
a
10
cent
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
,
which
will
be
erode
by
inflation
in
2017
.
more
imagination
in
this
area
could
have
result
in
a
amendment
to
the
term
of
reference
of
the
low
pay
Commission
,
which
would
have
have
a
impact
.
we
want
to
do
more
in
regard
to
transport
.
the
government
have
announce
€
15
million
in
current
expenditure
and
€
55
million
in
capital
expenditure
to
increase
the
subvention
,
which
be
welcome
on
one
level
.
however
,
at
a
cost
of
€
1.2
million
,
the
government
could
have
deliver
a
2
%
increase
in
the
subvention
to
Dublin
Bus
,
to
Bus
Éireann
at
a
cost
of
€
1.8
million
and
to
Iarnród
Éireann
at
a
cost
of
€
2.2
million
.
in
term
of
the
immediate
approval
of
all
national
road
project
where
planning
have
commence
,
we
propose
a
spend
of
€
61
million
and
for
the
road
network
from
Cork
to
Limerick
and
Galway
,
a
additional
€
10
million
this
year
to
bring
the
project
to
a
planning
stage
.
if
the
government
be
serious
about
regional
development
-
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
state
it
want
to
create
350000
job
outside
of
Dublin
-
then
proper
infrastructure
be
require
.
we
need
to
develop
the
Atlantic
corridor
,
which
include
the
line
between
Sligo
,
Galway
,
Limerick
,
Cork
,
Tralee
and
Kerry
.
it
be
very
important
for
regional
development
and
nationally
as
well
.
in
my
remain
time
,
I
wish
to
discuss
the
help
-
to
-
buy
scheme
.
I
take
some
sounding
from
first
-
time
buyer
who
can
not
get
on
to
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
the
couple
to
whom
I
speak
be
young
.
they
come
into
we
constituency
office
and
tell
we
they
can
not
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
.
they
early
analysis
of
the
help
-
to
-
buy
scheme
be
that
if
a
sunset
clause
of
December
2019
be
apply
to
the
scheme
,
in
real
term
it
would
mean
that
more
people
would
seek
to
take
advantage
of
the
scheme
which
would
result
in
a
system
whereby
first
-
time
buyer
would
be
compete
against
each
other
.
it
be
a
Darwinian
theory
.
the
scheme
be
unworkable
and
unfair
on
that
couple
.
they
be
already
stress
to
the
hilt
by
virtue
of
the
fact
they
can
not
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
.
I
do
not
know
what
€
600,000
would
buy
in
term
of
a
starter
home
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
logic
of
that
figure
be
.
maybe
in
south
Dublin
or
in
the
bastion
of
Fine
Gael
,
there
be
such
price
range
.
the
people
we
represent
will
not
be
buy
starter
home
for
€
600,000
.
the
scheme
need
to
be
work
through
.
I
be
always
inherently
suspicious
when
I
hear
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
welcoming
a
scheme
.
one
could
argue
that
it
will
have
a
inflationary
effect
on
the
cost
of
housing
,
which
be
something
we
have
to
prevent
.
we
need
a
bit
of
equity
.
information
we
have
state
that
no
rebate
will
be
pay
on
house
purchase
in
excess
of
€
600,000
.
I
do
not
know
the
logic
of
the
minister
's
position
on
that
.
the
threshold
for
rental
income
in
the
rent
-
a
-
room
scheme
have
increase
by
€
2000
to
bring
it
from
€
12,000
to
€
14000
.
what
will
the
effect
of
that
be
?
it
will
increase
rent
for
people
who
be
rent
room
in
house
right
across
the
country
.
where
be
the
logic
in
that
?
this
be
a
do
nothing
budget
and
have
be
design
by
a
do
nothing
government
and
a
do
nothing
Dáil
.
it
will
not
provide
any
real
material
benefit
for
the
vast
majority
of
people
.
it
will
actually
work
against
a
large
swathe
of
people
,
in
particular
young
people
who
want
to
get
on
to
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
they
will
look
at
the
budget
and
say
there
be
nothing
here
for
they
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
inland
revenue
(
include
value
-
add
tax
and
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.

pose

I
be

conscious
of
the
scale
and
impact
on
the
indigenous

over
the
medium
to
long

,
exchange

highlight
the
importance
of

on
a
wide

of

in

we
can
just
tell

now

I
congratulate

on

knock
Fine

for

its

will
probably
sit
on

hand
and
support
it
very
shortly
.
this
be
not
a
good
budget
for
Ireland
.
it
be
certainly
not
a
good
budget
for
anybody
under
26
.
it
be
certainly
not
a
good
budget
for
pensioner
.
if
one
be
part
of
the
squeeze
middle
,
it
certainly
be
not
a
very
good
budget
.
it
be
mention
a
while
ago
that
it
be
not
appropriate
to
give
the
undereducated

26
's
the
extra
freaky
fiver
,
as
we
will
call
it
.
if
one
put
oneself
into
the
position
of
a
22

23
year
old
who
have
a

at

,
have
borrow
money
from

a

make
a
awful

it
have
not
be
put
into

.
I
have
a
phone
call
the
other
night
at
9.20
p.m.
from
a
83

old

who
be
so
disgusted
with
the
fiver
that
I
actually
think
it
be
my
fault
.
he
say
,
"
I
do
not
want
it
,
Pat
,
give
it
to
the
kid
.
"
there
be
a
sense
of
anger
.
I
do
not
think
deputy
in
the
Chamber
realise
what
damage
have
be
do
to
ordinary
work
people
and
to
real
working
family
.
there
have
to
be
a
reality
check
here
.
again
today
in
the
Chamber
I
listen
to
the
leader
of
Fianna
Fáil
criticise
the
Fine
Gael
leader
on
investment
in
health
and
mental
health
.
yet
,
a
number
of
week
ago
when
we
propose
to
do
something
about
it
,
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
sit
on
they
hand
.
there
be
no
political
will
in
this
Chamber
.
I
also
hear
the
Fianna
Fáil
leader
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
state
a
number
of
day
ago
when
we
be
discuss
the
budget
that
Fianna
Fáil
do
not
write
the
budget
.
I
can
certainly
say
that
Fianna
Fáil
coloured
it
in
because
it
have
the
hallmark
of
both
party
.
we
know
what
will
happen
in
a
couple
of
day
's
time
.
it
beggar
belief
that
there
could
not
have
be
a
good
way
on
this
budget
.
it
should
have
be
about
invest
in
we
country
by
invest
in
public
service
,
housing
,
road
,
broadband
and
school
.
establish
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
this
be
not
rocket
science
.
the
government
have
to
invest
in
real
job
,
give
people
a
opportunity
to
earn
real
money
and
improve
the
service
we
have
.
they
be
all
pay
tax
.
it
be
not
rocket
science
.
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
that
would
be
that
the
government
would
address
the
problem
in
housing
and
we
education
system
.
it
would
certainly
take
the
stress
off
the
health
service
by
invest
in
people
.
it
go
back
to
one
thing
.
each
and
every
one
of
this
people
would
actually
have
proper
,
pay
job
so
they
could
pay
tax
.
it
be
about
make
a
fair
and
more
affordable
system
for
we
citizen
.
the
government
have
a
opportunity
to
do
it
but
unfortunately
we
stick
to
the
status
quo
here
which
be
very
unfortunate
.
Big
bang
budget
be
also
mention
.
perhaps
it
be
not
a
big
bang
budget
for
Fine
Gael
or
Fianna
Fáil
but
it
be
certainly
a
big
bang
budget
for
under
-
26
,
pensioner
and
what
the
government
class
as
the
squeeze
middle
.
that
be
the
reality
of
this
budget
.
we
have
to
empathise
with
people
outside
this
Chamber
.
even
as
a
newly
elect
deputy
,
I
understand
the
notion
of
be
in
a
bubble
,
but
we
actually
leave
the
bubble
now
and
again
and
engage
with
real
people
.
we
be
here
as
elect
representative
to
work
on
behalf
of
the
people
we
represent
.
I
have
a
son
at
home
who
will
be
a
teenager
very
shortly
.
he
be
excited
about
try
to
go
out
and
get
a
job
and
save
up
for
he
first
car
.
this
budget
do
not
give
much
hope
to
the
young
people
of
today
.
it
have
deflate
the
people
we
should
probably
respect
the
most
in
this
country
,
that
be
we
ageing
population
,
which
be
on
the
rise
.
they
be
the
people
who
build
this
country
.
we
should
be
plan
ahead
for
this
but
we
be
not
.
we
be
go
back
to
the
same
old
status
quo
,
specifically
target
certain
area
.
deputy
Doherty
mention
the
figure
of
€
20
million
a
while
back
.
that
could
have
be
use
in
a
more
productive
way
.
we
can
discuss
figure
and
number
,
but
we
have
listen
to
the
debate
over
the
last
few
day
and
it
just
seem
to
be
repetitive
.
I
speak
to
a
gentleman
last
Friday
at
my
clinic
in
Midleton
.
he
ask
I
what
it
be
like
up
here
.
I
say
,
"
it
be
100
mph
,
it
be
difficult
but
it
can
be
rewarding
.
"
he
ask
I
to
do
he
a
favour
.
he
say
,
"
when
you
go
into
the
Chamber
,
will
you
speak
plain
English
?
do
not
be
intoxicated
by
the
exuberance
of
somebody
's
vocabulary
.
"
I
laugh
.
the
reason
I
laugh
be
the
people
do
not
need
fancy
term
.
they
do
not
need
all
of
this
colouring
in
and
shading
of
number
.
they
want
the
brass
-
tack
truth
,
and
the
brass
-
tack
truth
of
this
budget
be
that
it
be
not
good
for
the
young
people
of
this
country
and
be
certainly
not
good
for
this
country
's
sick
people
,
pensioner
or
the
squeeze
middle
.
when
there
be
another
election
,
I
hope
people
will
remember
what
have
happen
in
this
Chamber
.
we
can
debate
this
budget
at
length
,
but
at
time
one
feel
one
be
waste
time
because
the
outcome
will
not
be
good
for
the
people
who
put
they
faith
in
we
.
I
could
talk
for
long
,
but
it
be
very
difficult
.
we
in
this
chamber
will
be
judge
on
merit
.
when
the
next
election
be
hold
I
hope
and
pray
that
,
please
God
,
the
young
people
,
pensioner
and
the
squeeze
middle
of
this
country
will
remember
this
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
comprehensive
reply
detail
both
the
humanitarian
response
from
Ireland
's
perspective
and
the
multilateral
political
engagement
at
the
Unite
Nation
.
Ireland
have
,
through
its
taxpayer
,
significantly
invest
in
alleviate
the
humanitarian
crisis
since
2012
.
the
minister
reference
the
figure
of
€
62
million
commit
so
far
.
we
have
a
debate
on
this
issue
last
week
and
there
be
suppose
to
be
a
ceasefire
last
weekend
.
the
United
Nation
have
be
hope
to
use
it
to
evacuate
seriously
wound
people
and
deliver
aid
,
but
that
do
not
appear
to
have
happen
.
have
the
minister
give
consideration
to
the
fact
that
no
aid
have
be
deliver
in
Aleppo
since
7
July
?
the
UN
Secretary
General
say
food
would
run
out
,
possibly
by
the
end
of
this
month
.
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
this
stark
fact
?
what
Srebrenica
be
to
the
1990
,
Aleppo
be
to
the
2010s
and
the
western
world
,
in
particular
,
the
United
State
and
other
actor
in
the
field
,
despite
they
good
effort
from
a
humanitarian
aid
point
of
view
,
need
to
up
they
game
in
term
of
political
engagement
I
implore
the
minister
to
use
he
good
office
and
whatever
influence
he
have
through
the
EU
External
affair
Service
to
encourage
the
Arab
world
in
its
response
to
this
crisis
from
a
purely
humanitarian
aid
point
of
view
because
notwithstand
the
effort
of
the
western
world
in
the
Middle
East
and
everything
that
be
go
on
there
,
there
be
a
responsibility
on
the
Arab
world
to
meet
the
humanitarian
need
of
people
within
the
region
.

short
of
a
breakthrough
at
the
Labour
Court
today
,
we
be
all
now
expect
a
full
Garda
strike
on
Friday
.
a
total
of
564
Garda
station
throughout
the
country
will
lie
empty
.
Serious
question
about
the
safety
of
we
community
deserve
a
more
forthcoming
response
than
we
have
yet
receive
.
thing
look
no
good
on
the
school
front
with
the
possibility
that
507
second
level
school
will
lie
empty
from
next
week
,
potentially
for
a
indefinite
period
.
it
go
without
say
that
we
in
the
Labour
Party
hope
a
resolution
will
be
find
with
gardaí
today
.
we
believe
it
do
not
need
to
be
like
this
.
for
week
now
deputy
Howlin
have
propose
a
range
of
alternative
.
the
most
significant
of
this
be
the
establishment
of
a
social
dialogue
that
would
involve
public
servant
in
discussion
relate
to
public
service
provision
as
well
as
pay
.
that
proposal
be
now
receive
widespread
support
.
as
the
architect
of
the
Haddington
Road
and
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
,
the
deputy
have
also
argue
that
we
need
to
begin
negotiation
formally
for
a
successor
deal
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
.
that
would
accelerate
pay
restoration
for
all
public
servant
.
finally
,
yesterday
we
at
least
receive
confirmation
that
this
will
happen
during
2017
.
we
have
also
argue
,
and
the
Seanad
have
agree
to
this
,
that
a
employer
labour
conference
should
be
establish
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
government
have
wait
too
long
to
take
any
meaningful
action
.
we
keep
hear
the
mantra
that
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
be
the
only
show
in
town
.
as
I
have
make
clear
,
we
hope
that
a
resolution
will
be
find
with
gardaí
today
,
but
even
if
that
be
the
case
,
at
this
stage
it
be
abundantly
clear
that
the
government
's
mantra
be
not
good
enough
.
we
need
mechanism
that
will
avoid
such
dispute
from
become
increasingly
common
.
we
need
to
keep
teacher
in
classroom
,
nurse
in
hospital
and
gardaí
on
the
beat
.
the
more
than
300000
public
servant
who
work
in
various
sector
need
to
be
at
work
and
not
on
strike
.
during
the
bad
period
of
we
history
we
manage
to
preserve
industrial
peace
.
it
be
beyond
belief
how
the
government
have
allow
this
situation
to
regress
so
rapidly
.
this
week
the
impact
of
industrial
unrest
seem
likely
to
become
very
real
.
my
question
to
the
Taoiseach
be
as
follow
.
of
the
range
of
idea
propose
by
the
Labour
Party
to
prevent
grow
industrial
unrest
,
will
he
seriously
consider
any
of
they
?
will
he
explain
how
the
outworking
of
the
public
service
pay
commission
will
feed
into
the
potential
successor
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
,
if
at
all
?
will
he
provide
more
detailed
information
on
the
contingency
arrangement
that
be
be
put
in
place
in
the
event
of
a
strike
on
Friday
?
on
the
issue
of
the
contingency
arrangement
,
we
all
appreciate
there
be
only
so
much
information
the
Taoiseach
can
put
into
the
public
domain
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
information
the
Taoiseach
be
provide
we
with
today
be
not
enough
to
allay
the
fear
of
people
in
community
throughout
Ireland
.
person
need
to
know
if
the
phone
will
be
answer
on
Friday
and
by
whom
.
person
need
to
know
who
will
respond
if
someone
's
house
be
break
into
or
if
a
neighbourhood
watch
programme
report
a
local
crime
.
this
be
all
simple
question
be
ask
by
people
in
community
today
.
I
be
ask
the
Taoiseach
if
he
could
give
we
more
detailed
information
while
take
into
account
there
be
certain
security
issue
involve
,
if
he
could
make
available
to
the
House
the
range
of
contingency
arrangement
,
and
if
he
could
be
a
bit
more
generous
in
term
of
what
it
be
that
be
be
propose
in
this
regard
.
what
border
?
there
be
two
very
important
documentary
on
RTE
television
last
night
.
I
want
to
refer
to
the
more
important
one
.
I
refer
to
Louise
O'Neill
's
exploration
of
the
issue
of
consent
and
rape
culture
in
Ireland
.
it
be
extremely
harrowing
viewing
.
one
of
the
statistic
mention
be
that
80
%
of
rape
victim
know
they
attacker
.
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
,
in
the
context
of
the
publication
of
the
woman
's
Aid
2015
report
,
to
provide
a
update
on
when
the
criminal
justice
(
victim
of
crime
)
Bill
will
reach
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
understand
the
head
of
the
Bill
be
agree
well
over
a
year
ago
.

,

be
the
Tánaiste
aware
that
today
SIPTU
announce
it
be
set
a
deadline
for
next
Thursday
to
ballot
its
member
on
the
reconvening
of
talk
on
a
successor
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
?
be
the
government
agreeable
to
commence
that
talk
on
the
date
announce
?
I
again
pay
tribute
to
Senator
Mark
Daly
and
that
who
have
work
on
the
draft
of
this
legislation
.
I
have
no
doubt
many
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
have
work
closely
with
other
in
the
preparation
and
draft
of
the
proposal
before
we
.
we
be
12
year
on
from
the
recognition
of
Irish
sign
Language
in
the
six
County
and
I
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
would
be
of
exactly
the
same
view
as
myself
on
this
issue
.
it
be
to
we
shame
that
12
year
on
we
have
yet
to
officially
recognise
one
of
we
two
indigenous
language
on
this
island
,
while
north
of
the
Border
this
have
be
do
.
with
all
of
the
requirement
entail
in
the
good
Friday
agreement
,
this
failure
to
reach
a
point
of
equality
of
recognition
of
the
need
and
rights
of
section
of
we
society
be
a
indictment
of
we
political
system
and
of
successive
government
.
this
be
a
motion
on
a
report
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
and
all
expression
of
appreciation
be
due
to
all
the
member
of
that
committee
.
we
be
a
cohesive
and
hard
-
work
body
of
Member
of
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
.
we
be
industrious
and
intend
to
continue
to
so
be
.
it
be
important
to
reflect
on
the
Irish
deaf
Society
's
key
and
critical
point
.
I
want
to
pay
tribute
to
Eddie
Redmond
and
all
the
team
at
the
Irish
deaf
Society
.
in
its
small
publication
,
ten
main
reason
Irish
sign
language
must
be
recognise
by
the
State
as
a
language
of
this
country
,
it
cite
the
number
of
people
who
use
ISL
on
a
daily
basis
.
for
this
regular
ISL
user
,
it
be
a
innate
and
a
integral
part
of
they
personality
.
ISL
be
the
only
natural
and
fully
accessible
language
for
deaf
child
.
there
be
no
national
registry
of
ISL
interpreter
and
ISL
teacher
and
,
furthermore
,
there
be
no
accreditation
or
monitoring
system
.

be
in
use
for
century
,
as
we
have

the
motion
call
on
the
government
to
recognise
ISL
have
be
pass
by
more
than
40
local
authority
across
this
jurisdiction
,
which
be
a
important
point
that
have
not
yet
be
make
.
there
be
no
automatic
right
for
deaf
people
to
have
a
isl
interpreter
in
the
justice
system
.
no
deaf
child
can
fully
learn
Irish
sign
language

or
even

there
be
no
access
for
deaf
people
to

or

in
ISL
,
something
that
be
hugely
important
.
I
thank
the
Member

consequence
for
the
woman
and
they
family
in
the
region
serve
by
the
Cork
University
Hospital
and
CUMH
.
I
will
outline
some
fact
that
have
be
communicate
to
I
.
I
admit
to
be
quite
new
to
this
issue
.
the
matter
be
refer
to
I
by
a
consultant
gynaecologist
and
the
director
of
the
gynaecology
unit
at
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
.
she
tell
I
the
gynaecology
service
for
woman
in
Cork
have
be
neglect
in
the
past
decade
.
there
be
currently
4058
woman
wait
for
a
outpatient
appointment
.
it
be
the
long
wait
list
of
all
gynaecology
unit
nationwide
and
be
increase
by
approximately
1000
per
year
.
it
be
also
three
time
the
size
of
the
Cork
University
Hospital
general
surgery
outpatient
waiting
list
,
with
35
%
of
woman
wait
over
a
year
for
a
outpatient
appointment
and
many
wait
two
to
three
year
.
many
woman
arrive
in
emergency
room
in
crisis
due
to
long
waiting
time
.
I
have
be
tell
there
be
a
risk
of
delay
diagnosis
of
cancer
in
woman
who
be
force
to
wait
for
year
for
they
outpatient
assessment
,
and
this
be
a
clinical
assessment
of
that
.
there
be
518
woman
on
a
waiting
list
for
surgery
,
38
%
of
whom
have
be
wait
at
least
one
year
.
Cork
have
the
long
waiting
list
for
gynaecological
surgery
,
be
twice
that
of
the
Rotunda
Hospital
,
which
rank
second
.
in
the
past
decade
,
no
new
consultant
gynaecologist
post
have
be
create
in
Cork
,
despite
the
fact
that
26
such
post
have
be
advertise
nationwide
in
a
one
-
year
period
during
2015
and
2016
.
gynaecology
theatre
in
CUMH
be
function
at
only
40
%
of
they
originally
intend
capacity
.
CUMH
have
two
fully
commission
,
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
gynaecology
theatre
,
only
one
of
which
be
use
for
surgery
and
for
just
four
day
per
week
.
I
want
to
distinguish
between
gynaecology
and
maternity
service
.
I
anticipate
that
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
may
refer
specifically
to
maternity
service
.
I
hope
it
will
not
.
I
refer
specifically
to
gynaecology
service
and
the
lack
of
service
for
woman
's
health
.
this
be
not
a
call
for
additional
funding
.
the
issue
be
one
of
governance
and
ensure
the
HSE
make
a
great
effort
to
allow
the
service
to
be
put
in
place
.
I
do
not
believe
for
a
minute
that
it
be
due
to
a
lack
of
funding
.
it
be
due
to
a
lack
of
will
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
she
reply
.
she
speak
of
some
progress
in
the
appointment
of
a
sonographer
and
a
clear
schedule
to
clear
the
ultrasound
waiting
list
by
2016
.
in
that
sense
,
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
.
in
raise
the
issue
,
I
be
try
to
examine
the
governance
issue
regard
the
relationship
between
CUMH
and
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
.
although
the
HSE
will
examine
it
as
come
under
the
umbrella
of
CUH
,
it
must
be
recognise
as
a
separate
governance
procedure
similar
to
other
hospital
in
the
South
-
South
West
hospital
group
.
we
need
to
examine
how
we
provide
for
the
reduction
in
waiting
time
for
woman
who
have
be
wait
too
long
for
access
to
service
.
we
also
need
to
examine
the
risk
that
be
build
in
regard
the
potential
for
the
development
of
cancer
as
a
result
of
overly
long
waiting
time
.
I
acknowledge
the
response
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
deputy
Simon
Harris
,
he
colleague
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Marcella
Corcoran
Kennedy
to
interrogate
the
dynamic
between
that
who
manage
CUMH
from
a
HSE
perspective
and
that
who
be
clinical
lead
.
at
one
stage
,
when
we
be
go
through
a
reconfiguration
of
hospital
in
the
Cork
region
,
clinician
be
take
the
lead
and
decision
be
be
base
on
clinically
lead
practice
.
now
,
it
have
shif
back
to
the
HSE
.
while
I
will
speak
to
the
Minister
of
Health
myself
about
it
,
will
the
Minister
of
State
convey
to
the
minister
that
we
need
to
improve
the
gynaecological
service
in
CUMH
?
we
support
this
motion
.
there
be
aspect
of
it
worthy
of
further
interrogation
,
particularly
the
publication
by
grant
Thornton
of
its
report
predict
that
450
to
500
post
office
will
cease
to
exist
by
2017
.
I
question
that
figure
because
the
evidence
during
the
past
five
year
would
not
bear
it
out
.
it
would
take
a
major
diminution
in
service
for
that
figure
to
be
borne
out
in
real
term
.
notwithstanding
that
,
there
be
a
problem
.
be
people
in
rural
area
go
into
they
local
post
office
to
use
they
service
or
do
they
drive
past
they
and
go
to
the
near
town
,
urban
conurbation
or
city
?
when
I
be
a
county
councillor
,
I
advocate
strongly
for
young
couple
who
want
to
build
house
in
rural
area
.
between
2004
and
2007
,
I
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
help
young
people
to
obtain
planning
permission
in
rural
area
where
there
be
post
office
.
it
be
arguable
,
however
,
that
most
of
that
people
do
not
use
they
local
post
office
but
drive
to
the
near
town
to
avail
of
all
the
service
available
there
.
how
do
we
disrupt
that
behaviour
and
incentivise
people
to
develop
a
loyalty
to
they
own
local
office
?
that
will
be
challenging
.
it
will
require
behavioural
change
.
a
Post
make
a
submission
recently
to
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Art
,
Heritage
,
Regional
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
set
out
metric
.
it
have
introduce
the
court
fine
payment
system
.
it
will
extend
the
National
lottery
service
to
all
post
office
nationwide
.
the
State
savings
business
be
grow
and
be
worth
over
€
20
billion
.
it
be
talk
about
plan
to
enhance
that
service
but
will
that
translate
into
more
people
go
into
post
office
to
transact
that
business
or
will
people
prefer
to
do
it
online
?
since
March
2014
,
a
Post
have
experience
a
decline
of
over
11
%
in
core
mail
usage
.
since
the
peak
of
mail
reach
in
2007
,
it
have
experience
a
38
%
decline
.
there
be
behavioural
change
from
post
letter
to
online
transaction
,
particularly
for
government
service
.
I
do
not
see
the
State
directly
subsidise
individual
post
office
but
a
co-operative
model
for
community
where
the
local
post
office
be
under
threat
have
be
mention
.
we
have
and
still
have
a
strong
co-operative
etho
in
this
State
and
I
do
not
see
why
,
with
soft
or
hard
support
,
community
where
there
be
office
at
risk
of
closure
,
not
be
pass
on
to
the
next
generation
or
with
no
uptake
if
somebody
decide
to
retire
,
could
not
develop
a
social
enterprise
model
.
I
do
not
know
how
many
motion
about
rural
post
office
I
have
witness
in
the
past
ten
year
.
if
we
can
be
progressive
and
expansive
in
we
thinking
and
work
with
community
,
we
can
see
whether
,
short
of
direct
subsidisation
,
we
can
build
out
a
co-operative
model
.
it
be
only
one
suggestion
but
it
could
be
do
on
a
trial
basis
in
one
or
two
community
.
if
they
feel
strongly
enough
about
they
local
post
office
,
and
the
survey
tell
we
that
they
do
,
then
let
we
put
that
to
the
test
and
see
if
there
be
other
way
of
deal
with
this
issue
.
it
it
worth
read
into
the
record
again
that
which
be
state
by
a
Post
.
in
March
2014
,
a
Post
say
that
it
have
more
than
750000
weekly
Department
of
social
Protection
customer
.
I
know
this
have
be
mention
already
.
this
have
now
fall
to
625000
customer
,
a
decline
of
17
%
.
a
Post
have
say
that
it
be
cause
primarily
by
a
decline
of
30
%
in
the
number
of
jobseeker
payment
as
people
gain
employment
or
move
onto
scheme
.
a
post
then
experience
a
reduction
of
5
%
in
pension
payment
due
to
the
very
low
number
of
new
pensioner
choose
the
post
office
option
for
they
payment
.
I
know
that
there
be
some
tension
around
that
but
we
have
to
be
honest
:
if
people
decide
that
they
want
they
payment
pay
in
a
particular
way
,
that
be
the
choice
of
citizen
.
while
we
in
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
,
I
do
not
take
the
dystopian
view
that
post
office
will
be
wipe
out
.
we
have
see
a
growth
in
the
number
of
one
-
off
rural
house
and
we
have
see
investment
in
school
in
rural
area
.
what
we
need
to
do
now
be
see
how
we
can
help
community
,
particularly
that
in
sensitive
area
,
such
as
the
one
that
deputy
Pearse
Doherty
speak
about
in
he
own
native
Gweedore
.
if
we
take
that
as
a
example
,
and
there
have
be
public
meeting
around
this
,
perhaps
it
be
one
area
that
we
could
look
at
as
a
model
in
which
stakeholder
can
come
together
to
sustain
the
post
office
and
roll
in
other
service
,
not
just
post
office
-
related
service
but
other
social
service
,
to
create
the
kind
of
hub
that
be
so
vital
to
the
rural
community
to
which
we
refer
in
the
context
of
the
motion
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Bill
.
I
have
to
say
that
in
general
term
,
it
have
to
be
welcome
in
as
far
as
it
go
.
obviously
,
it
be
welcome
that
more
specific
provision
be
be
make
regard
the
admission
of
people
with
special
need
to
school
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
a
great
level
of
transparency
be
be
provide
in
relation
to
admission
policy
.
in
the
past
,
it
be
often
a
very
secretive
process
.
Parent
have
to
be
in
the
know
in
order
to
get
they
child
into
school
.
it
be
good
that
everything
will
be
deal
with
in
a
upfront
and
open
manner
from
now
on
.
I
refer
to
the
requirement
on
school
to
publish
they
admission
policy
.
it
be
deeply
ironic
and
incredible
that
the
minister
be
not
address
the
baptism
barrier
in
this
legislation
because
it
be
the
great
barrier
to
admission
to
school
and
it
be
the
cause
of
the
most
concern
with
regard
to
school
admission
.
give
the
stage
we
be
at
in
term
of
we
republic
and
we
democracy
,
it
be
utterly
unacceptable
that
parent
feel
they
have
no
choice
other
than
to
baptise
they
child
in
order
that
they
can
get
into
the
local
State
-
fund
school
.
by
any
yardstick
,
the
minister
be
preside
over
deep
discrimination
on
the
part
of
State
-
fund
school
towards
child
who
do
not
share
the
majority
faith
of
the
majority
of
school
in
the
State
.
he
cannot
stand
over
the
continuation
of
that
situation
.
the
minister
suggest
that
the
issue
of
the
baptism
barrier
will
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
a
Labour
Party
Bill
that
be
consider
in
this
House
some
time
ago
.
that
will
not
happen
.
it
be
not
possible
to
deal
with
this
issue
in
the
context
of
the
flawed
legislation
in
question
,
which
would
emb
a
discriminatory
regime
if
it
be
agree
in
this
House
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
stop
put
this
live
real
issue
,
which
be
affect
many
family
in
this
country
,
on
the
long
finger
and
to
stop
make
excuse
to
put
it
off
.
it
be
wrong
and
can
not
be
defend
.
how
can
four
year
old
be
deny
access
to
they
local
school
solely
on
the
grounds
of
religion
because
they
be
not
baptise
?
the
government
should
not
allow
this
discriminatory
situation
to
continue
.
one
of
the
excuse
we
have
hear
have
involve
question
whether
it
be
possible
to
amend
the
equal
Status
Act
2000
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
we
should
deal
with
this
area
of
discrimination
by
abolish
section
7
(
3
)
(
c
)
of
that
act
.
as
I
argue
in
this
House
last
year
,
I
strongly
believe
it
would
be
quite
constitutional
to
take
such
action
.
the
constitution
be
balance
.
we
have
to
balance
the
public
good
against
any
particular
protection
there
be
for
religion
.
I
be
not
go
to
go
into
all
the
detail
of
the
various
section
of
the
constitution
.
I
do
that
when
I
speak
on
this
issue
last
year
.
I
would
like
to
mention
some
of
the
various
organisation
work
in
this
area
.
equate
Ireland
have
produce
a
compelling
legal
opinion
from
three
senior
counsel
advise
that
it
be
possible
to
address
this
issue
without
amend
the
constitution
.
equally
,
the
Education
Equality
group
have
come
forward
with
suggest
amendment
that
it
believe
to
be
entirely
constitutional
.
while
I
do
not
intend
to
oppose
this
legislation
on
second
stage
,
I
appeal
strongly
to
the
Minister
and
Fianna
Fáil
to
give
a
commitment
to
take
a
serious
look
at
this
issue
when
this
legislation
be
consider
on
committee
stage
.
the
social
Democrat
will
be
tab
amendment
to
the
Bill
.
I
be
sure
other
party
will
do
likewise
.
in
the
interest
of
fairness
and
openness
,
and
for
the
sake
of
respect
many
family
in
this
country
who
feel
they
be
be
seriously
discriminate
against
in
term
of
the
option
that
be
open
to
they
for
they
child
's
schooling
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
rethink
he
position
on
this
matter
and
to
consider
the
argument
that
will
be
make
on
committee
stage
.
this
argument
be
not
just
be
make
by
member
of
this
House
or
by
parent
who
be
affect
by
this
problem
.
I
will
return
to
this
point
when
I
complete
my
contribution
tomorrow
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a

to

suggest
that
the
issue
of
the
baptism
barrier
will
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
a
Labour
Party
Bill
that
be
consider
in
this
House
some
time
ago
.
that
will
not
happen
.
it
be
not
possible
to
deal
with
this
issue
in
the
context
of
the
flawed
legislation
in
question
,
which
would
emb
a
discriminatory
regime
if
it
be
agree
in
this
House
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
stop
put
this
live
real
issue
,
which
be
affect
many
family
in
this
country
,
on
the
long
finger
and
to
stop
make
excuse
to
put
it
off
.
it
be
wrong
and
can
not
be
defend
.
how
can
four
year
old
be
deny
access
to
they
local
school
solely
on
the
grounds
of
religion
because
they
be
not
baptise
?
the
government
should
not
allow
this
discriminatory
situation
to
continue
.
one
of
the
excuse
we
have
hear
have
involve
question
whether
it
be
possible
to
amend
the
equal
Status
Act
2000
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
we
should
deal
with
this
area
of
discrimination
by
abolish
section
7
(
3
)
(
c
)
of
that
act
.
as
I
argue
in
this
House
last
year
,
I
strongly
believe
it
would
be
quite
constitutional
to
take
such
action
.
the
constitution
be
balance
.
we
have
to
balance
the
public
good
against
any
particular
protection
there
be
for
religion
.
I
be
not
go
to
go
into
all
the
detail
of
the
various
section
of
the
constitution
.
I
do
that
when
I
speak
on
this
issue
last
year
.
I
would
like
to
mention
some
of
the
various
organisation
work
in
this
area
.
equate
Ireland
have
produce
a
compelling
legal
opinion
from
three
senior
counsel
advise
that
it
be
possible
to
address
this
issue
without
amend
the
constitution
.
equally
,
the
Education
Equality
group
have
come
forward
with
suggest
amendment
that
it
believe
to
be
entirely
constitutional
.
while
I
do
not
intend
to
oppose
this
legislation
on
second
stage
,
I
appeal
strongly
to
the
Minister
and
Fianna
Fáil
to
give
a
commitment
to
take
a
serious
look
at
this
issue
when
this
legislation
be
consider
on
committee
stage
.
the
social
Democrat
will
be
tab
amendment
to
the
Bill
.
I
be
sure
other
party
will
do
likewise
.
in
the
interest
of
fairness
and
openness
,
and
for
the
sake
of
respect
many
family
in
this
country
who
feel
they
be
be
seriously
discriminate
against
in
term
of
the
option
that
be
open
to
they
for
they
child
's
schooling
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
rethink
he
position
on
this
matter
and
to
consider
the
argument
that
will
be
make
on
committee
stage
.
this
argument
be
not
just
be
make
by
member
of
this
House
or
by
parent
who
be
affect
by
this
problem
.
I
will
return
to
this
point
when
I
complete
my
contribution
tomorrow
.
I
be
glad
to
have
a
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
Bill
.
I
have
to
say
that
in
general
term
,
it
have
to
be
welcome
in
as
far
as
it
go
.
obviously
,
it
be
welcome
that
more
specific
provision
be
be
make
regard
the
admission
of
people
with
special
need
to
school
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
a
great
level
of
transparency
be
be
provide
in
relation
to
admission
policy
.
in
the
past
,
it
be
often
a
very
secretive
process
.
Parent
have
to
be
in
the
know
in
order
to
get
they
child
into
school
.
it
be
good
that
everything
will
be
deal
with
in
a
upfront
and
open
manner
from
now
on
.
I
refer
to
the
requirement
on
school
to
publish
they
admission
policy
.
it
be
deeply
ironic
and
incredible
that
the
minister
be
not
address
the
baptism
barrier
in
this
legislation
because
it
be
the
great
barrier
to
admission
to
school
and
it
be
the
cause
of
the
most
concern
with
regard
to
school
admission
.
give
the
stage
we
be
at
in
term
of
we
republic
and
we
democracy
,
it
be
utterly
unacceptable
that
parent
feel
they
have
no
choice
other
than
to
baptise
they
child
in
order
that
they
can
get
into
the
local
State
-
fund
school
.
by
any
yardstick
,
the
minister
be
preside
over
deep
discrimination
on
the
part
of
State
-
fund
school
towards
child
who
do
not
share
the
majority
faith
of
the
majority
of
school
in
the
State
.
he
cannot
stand
over
the
continuation
of
that
situation
.
the
minister
suggest
that
the
issue
of
the
baptism
barrier
will
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
a
Labour

I
move
:
that
leave
be
grant
to
introduce
a
Bill
entitle
Bill
a
act
to
prohibit
the
manufacture
,
sale
and
import
of
any
cosmetic
product
contain
micro-plastic
as
a
raw
material
,
and
to
provide
for
related
matter
.
I
will
put
the
House
back
on
track
timewise
.
I
will
finish
well
within
five
minute
.
I
seek
leave
to
introduce
the
Bill
.
it
be
introduce
by
the
Green
Party
and
roundly
reject
by
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
in
the
Seanad
last
week
.
the
argument
relate
to
the
transparency
directive
and
,
in
particular
,
in
respect
of
the
article
relate
to
the
free
movement
of
goods
and
service
on
which
the
Bill
be
reject
be
spurious
.
however
,
article
36
provide
the
protection
of
human
health
and
flora
and
fauna
and
protection
of
marine
life
.
we
believe
strongly
that
there
be
a
precedent
in
respect
of
this
type
of
legislation
.
when
the
smoking
ban
be
introduce
by
former
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
there
be
a
notification
period
of
three
month
but
it
do
not
prevent
the
legislation
from
go
through
the
House
.
it
get
fair
wind
and
a
fair
passage
.
this
legislation
be
similar
in
so
far
as
everybody
in
the
House
have
state
that
they
support
it
.
Fianna
Fáil
,
as
I
understand
it
,
be
on
record
as
say
that
it
would
introduce
its
own
Bill
because
it
feel
the
Green
Party
Bill
be
not
strident
enough
in
respect
of
the
penalty
it
propose
.
we
be
happy
to
have
this
Bill
amend
in
any
way
if
Fianna
Fáil
feel
strongly
enough
that
the
measure
we
propose
be
not
strident
enough
in
respect
of
the
banning
of
micro-plastic
.
we
also
feel
strongly
that
there
be
not
a
sufficient
momentum
on
the
part
of
the
European
Commission
to
legislate
in
this
area
.
give
the
important
role
of
member
state
,
it
be
appropriate
that
they
should
in
they
own
right
introduce
public
health
measure
that
they
deem
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
.
I
hope
there
will
be
cross
-party
support
for
this
.
this
be
a
opportune
Bill
because
it
seek
to
address
the
issue
raise
by
the
minister
for
Housing
,
Planning
,
Community
and
local
government
in
response
to
the
Green
Party
and
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
in
the
Seanad
last
week
.
it
be
opportune
without
be
opportunistic
.
I
move
:
"
that
the
Bill
be
take
in
private
Member
's
time
.
"
I
will
shortly
quote
a
article
write
by
Michael
Clifford
some
month
ago
when
he
describe
Mr.
Barry
.
I
can
relate
to
deputy
Martin
when
he
speak
about
the
use
of
"
mister
"
in
Mr.
Barry
.
I
do
not
know
he
personally
but
to
all
of
we
who
know
of
Mr.
Barry
,
he
be
hold
in
such
high
respect
.
Mr.
Clifford
use
the
follow
apposite
word
:
"
for
many
who
encounter
he
,
he
be
just
a
decent
man
who
do
he

the

I
be

I
be
happy

I
wish
to
refer
specifically
to
the
issue
of
flood
insurance
and
the
memorandum

in
March
2014
between
the

I
hail
from
Mallow
in

,
to
be
fair
to
the
OPW

the
programme
of
work
commence
some
year

in

town
of
Mallow
and
Fermoy
have
yield
benefit
and
success
through
the
intervention
of
a
number
of
minister
of
State
.
I
do
not
seek
to
be
overtly
partisan
on
this
because
good
work
have
be
carry
out
down
through
the
year
,
which
have
alleviate
the
flooding
problem
.
however
,
it
have
not
alleviate
the
issue
face
by
people
who
live
on
the
flood
plain
and
they
ability
to
obtain
flood
insurance
.
the
press

in
2014
regard
the
memorandum

the

the
principle

the
OPW
and

on
the
information

how
it
will
be

the

will
provide

will
show

within
this
area
from
1
June
2014
.
we
be
into
December
2016
and
somewhere
along
the
line
a
election
happen
and
since
the
election
,
that
memorandum
of
understanding
seem
to
carry
no
weight
at
all
.
I
see
my
constituency
colleague
deputy
O'Keeffe
be
here
and
he
will
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
there
be
people
within
the
curtilage
of
the
Munster
Blackwater
in
town
and
hamlet
along
that
river
who
be
be
refuse
flood
insurance
,
whether
business
or
domestic
.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
be
world
-
class
engineering
work
sign
off
,
the
insurance
company
be
point
-
blank
refuse
to
provide
the
risk
cover
for
business
and
resident
along
that
river
.
the
memorandum
of
understanding
seem
to
have
fall
by
the
wayside
and
do
not
have
the
weight
that
be
give
to
it
prior
to
this
election
or
as
far
back
as
2014
.
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
be
commit
to
this
issue
and
I
hope
he
will
revisit
that
memorandum
of
understanding
and
re-engage
with
Insurance
Ireland
with
a
view
to
ensure
we
find
solution
.
deputy
Rabbitte
say
it
be
a
question
of
find
solution
to
this
problem
in
a
apolitical
non-partisan
way
.
in
that
press
release
the
chief
executive
of
Insurance
Ireland
say
:
"
insurance
Ireland
be
pleased
to
announce
the
signing
of
a
memorandum
of
Understanding
(
MoU
)
with
the
Office
of
Public
Works
(
OPW
)
which
will
see
the
OPW
share
flood
defence
datum
with
Insurance
Ireland
so
that
insurance
company
can
take
this
datum
into
account
when
assess
flood
risk
.
"
the
sector
clearly
have
not
take
the
two
significant
project
in
Fermoy
and
Mallow
into
account
when
assess
flood
risk
.
the
big
international
insurance
company
in
place
such
as
Geneva
,
Bonn
or
Berlin
that
speak
through
Insurance
Ireland
have
decide
they
do
not
want
to
do
it
.
they
have
make
a
simple
corporate
decision
.
it
be
for
we
in
this
house
work
together
to
ensure
that
memorandum
of
understanding
get
the
status
it
deserve
and
that
we
try
to
work
with
Insurance
Ireland
.
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
that
will
come
before
the
finance
committee
,
we
should
bring
Insurance
Ireland
back
into
the
Oireachtas
to
find
some
resolution
of
this
issue
.
the
press
release
also
state
"
this
mou
be
the
start
of
a
process
which
will
help
we
member
[
this
be
Insurance
Ireland
]
make
flood
insurance
more
widely
available
in
area
benefit
from
flood
defence
build
to
the
desire
standard
of
1:100
year
.
"
it
have
throw
that
out
the
window
and
renege
on
its
own
public
utterance
about
provide
cover
.
it
be
a
absolute
disgrace
and
it
need
to
be
take
to
task
collectively
by
this
House
for
dereliction
of
duty
.
there
be
genuine
broker
and
insurance
house
which
will
provide
cover
in
bespoke
circumstance
but
it
be
unfair
of
anybody
in
the
industry
to
expect
a
few
player
to
cover
the
entire
risk
.
that
be
why
we
have
more
work
to
do
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Canney
,
will
do
everything
he
can
on
this
but
this
Bill
be
a
prism
through
which
we
can
work
together
to
provide
a
resolution
.

be

minister
of
state
distribute
copy
of
he
speech
?
thank
you
very
much
.
the
Labour
Party
's
support
for
this
legislation
be
conditional
on
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
be
take
seriously
and
the
role
of
ComReg
not
be
excise
into
the
future
to
that
of
a
regulatory
body
oversee
its
obligation
under
section
12
of
the
2002
Act
.
I
take
some
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
in
regard
to
the
recommendation
inherent
in
the
Kerr
report
.
if
one
have
regard
to
ComReg
's
postal
strategy
statement
2015
-
2017
,
there
be
a
statutory
remit
to
ensure
the
provision
of
a
affordable
universal
postal
service
that
meet
the
need
of
all
postal
service
user
.
there
be
legitimate
doubt
as
to
whether
this
legislation
,
as
propose
,
will
compromise
affordability
for
consumer
.
it
be
clear
to
anybody
that
the
proposal
in
this
legislation
in
term
of
the
increase
in
postage
charge
will
compromise
the
affordability
element
inherent
within
ComReg
's
remit
.
ComReg
have
limit
statutory
power
to
regulate
a
post
postal
service
that
be
not
universal
postal
service
.
we
know
from
ComReg
that
letter
volume
have
fall
by
32
%
since
2007
and
that
a
Post
be
forecasting
a
further
decline
of
approximately
4
%
per
annum
in
this
regard
.
as
the
universal
postal
service
provider
,
a
Post
be
the
market
leader
in
the
delivery
of
letter
and
it
must
take
the
necessary
step
to
address
this
decline
and
ensure
the
continuation
of
the
universal
postal
service
.
I
welcome
the
review
commence
by
the
company
.
we
be
all
agree
that
strategic
change
and
restructuring
must
be
real
and
that
there
must
be
definitive
timeline
on
that
action
.
if
a
Post
have
full
commercial
freedom
to
ensure
that
its
other
postal
service
be
viable
financially
then
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
it
have
achieve
this
historically
.
the
answer
be
that
clearly
it
have
not
do
so
.
if
it
have
,
we
would
not
be
here
now
.
that
place
a
significant
burden
on
the
Member
of
this
House
who
be
genuinely
try
to
ensure
a
future
for
a
Post
but
who
be
also
try
to
protect
consumer
against
undue
and
unfair
price
increase
.
there
be
something
of
a
Hobson
's
choice
.
the
2011
act
be
clear
in
respect
of
a
Post
's
obligation
to
the
universal
postal
service
and
compliance
with
price
affordability
,
as
I
have
say
.
a
post
must
comply
with
the
price
cap
.
it
be
very
tempting
to
ensure
such
a
regime
be
not
undermine
or
change
so
as
to
protect
consumer
and
speak
to
the
public
interest
.
price
increase
lead
to
flow
towards
electronic
means
of
communication
.
this
be
well
document
.
the
price
elasticity
affect
the
cost
of
postage
be
negative
,
as
we
know
.
where
one
keep
increase
the
price
,
one
reduce
the
demand
,
and
the
consequent
revenue
loss
put
a
post
in
a
even
more
precarious
position
.
the
price
cap
mechanism
employ
by
ComReg
be
arguably
a
protection
in
more
way
than
one
.
it
regulate
price
and
,
in
do
so
,
ensure
volume
be
theoretically
maintain
to
keep
a
post
viable
.
the
technical
challenge
face
by
a
Post
in
this
electronic
age
be
well
document
.
the
availability
of
electronic
substitute
have
result
in
diminish
mail
volume
,
thereby
affect
revenue
stream
.
corporate
behaviour
be
change
and
entity
such
as
bank
of
Ireland
be
increasingly
move
they
communication
with
client
to
a
online
format
.
social
welfare
contract
constitute
another
case
in
point
.
Public
finance
pressure
be
also
influence
behaviour
in
respect
of
funding
deficit
in
the
postal
sector
right
across
the
European
Union
.
the
recent
Kerr
report
and
post
office
network
business
development
group
recognise
the
worth
of
the
post
office
network
.
the
report
make
23
recommendation
.
one
must
ask
again
why
they
have
yet
to
be
implement
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
group
be
establish
on
foot
of
the
recommendation
of
a
cabinet
committee
on
social
policy
.
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
also
form
part
of
the
2016
programme
for
government
.
the
chairman
of
a
Post
address
the
Dáil
committee
last
July
.
he
speak
about
the
very
precarious
financial
position
of
a
Post
.
he
reiterate
that
in
the
past
24
hour
in
regard
to
the
universal
service
obligation
.
let
I
refer
to
the
2015
annual
report
of
a
Post
.
the
opinion
be
articulate
through
we
own
research
entity
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
report
state
mail
account
for
63.7
%
of
revenue
and
that
the
extent
of
the
decline
be
articulate
through
loss
of
over
€
340
million
.
it
be
state
that
,
of
the
580
million
item
handle
by
a
Post
in
2015
,
60
%
related
to
USO
product
while
letter
account
for
90
%
of
domestic
uso
volume
and
74
%
of
international
outbound
uso
volume
.
therefore
,
bear
in
mind
the
ComReg
report
,
to
which
I
have
refer
,
we
know
that
the
deteriorate
liquidity
of
a
Post
be
a
matter
of
grave
concern
.
the
amount
of
cash
in
hand
and
in
the
bank
fall
from
€350
million
to
€
50
million
between
2008
and
2015
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
be
sure
the
figure
have
diminish
even
further
.
ComReg
tell
we
that
80
%
of
postal
transaction
be
business
-
related
and
that
30
large
postal
service
user
,
include
bank
,
utility
and
government
,
account
for
the
vast
majority
of
mail
send
.
I
refer
to
Bank
of
Ireland
as
a
example
of
just
how
much
mail
have
reduce
in
such
a
short
period
.
if
volume
have
reduce
and
if
the
current
cap
be
change
or
go
,
there
will
be
a
serious
danger
of
rise
cost
for
customer
and
sme
,
in
particular
.
in
this
scenario
,
price
increase
will
result
in
a
further
decline
in
revenue
,
precipitate
the
demise
of
a
Post
over
a
long
period
.
if
we
do
not
arrest
this
decline
now
,
we
will
do
a
disservice
to
present
and
future
postal
service
user
because
the
service
will
not
exist
in
large
swathe
of
the
country
.
throughout
the
European
Union
,
there
be
example
of
where
the
universal
service
obligation
have
diminish
to
a
unsustainable
level
.
Monday
to
Friday
delivery
have
cease
in
some
instance
.
post

do
not
exist
anymore
in
Sweden
.
supermarket
and

act
as

agent
.
they
behave
like
post
office
and
act
as
collection
point
.
letter
be
deliver
but
package
and
parcel
have
to
be
collect
.
it
do
not
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
that
if
a
Post
's
cash
reserve
be
in
such
a
perilous
state
,
something
will
have
to
give
.
it
be
not
beyond
the
bound
of
possibility
to
envisage
a
time
when
the
Monday
-
to
-
Friday
delivery
as
we
know
it
may
become
a
thing
of
the
past
.
there
be
a
provision
in
EU
legislation
that
could
be
helpful
to
a
Post
.
it
refer
to
service
of
general
economic
interest
-
I
be
state
this
specifically
because
I
hope
the
minister
and
he
official
will
take
on
board
this
concept
,
which
be
real
-
or
economic
activity
that
allow
public
authority
,
namely
,
the
Irish
government
,
to
identify
as
be
of
particular
interest
or
importance
to
citizen
and
that
would
not
be
supply
if
there
be
no
public
intervention
.
example
be
transport
network
,
postal
service
and
social
service
.
in
practice
,
this
could
mean
that
the
government
could
specify
that
a
particular
service
be
provide
through
the
post
office
in
a
manner
that
be
require
by
citizen
and
argue
that
no
private
supplier
could
do
the
same
.
in
other
word
,
the
government
could
utilise
the
EU
provision
in
regard
to
service
of
general
economic
interest
to
channel
certain
government
service
through
the
post
office
,
thus
increase
footfall
and
revenue
to
the
post
office
.
opportunity
to
do
this
in
the
past
have
not
be
take
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
post
office
network
.
the
government
,
if
it
be
genuine
in
its
commitment
to
the
future
of
the
post
office
network
,
must
utilise
all
such
future
opportunity
to
use
the
service
of
general
economic
interest
.
if
one
marry
this
element
to
the
Kerr
report
recommendation
,
one
note
that
there
be
complementarity
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
mechanism
of
service
of
general
economic
interest
cannot
be
utilise
or
mobilise
in
this
instance
,
perhaps
the
minister
could
make
it
clear
in
he
response
,
or
at
some
other
stage
.
we
firmly
believe
,
however
,
it
be
a
mechanism
that
can
be
use
.
it
have
be
use
by
other
country
,
specifically
with
regard
to
postal
service
to
ensure
they
protection
.
there
be
a
stark
choice
for
this
House
to
make
.
we
note
the
concern
of
postmaster
and
Age
action
.
the
cash
reserve
of
a
Post
be
so
precarious
at
this
point
that
this
action
be
necessary
.
it
be
the
less
of
two
evil
.
I
do
not
believe
we
can
wait
for
a
review
of
a
Post
's
own
financial
position
to
take
place
and
for
a
report
to
be
issue
thereon
with
a
set
of
recommendation
.
we
be
up
against
the
clock
on
this
one
.
I
fear
that
if
we
do
not
support
this
legislation
,
the
cash
reserve
be
such
that
wage
will
not
be
pay
and
post
office
will
have
to
be
close
.
I
do
not
want
to
exaggerate
or
sound
alarmist
base
on
the
briefing
I
have
receive
on
this
issue
.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
I
to
state
that
we
have
to
protect
consumer
and
ensure
that
there
be
no
further
increase
in
the
cost
of
postage
stamp
.
however
,
most
deputy
be
of
the
view
that
,
if
it
be
a
choice
between
that
and
protect
worker
,
the
network
and
the
universal
service
obligation
,
USO
,
as
well
as
ensure
the
hundred
of
post
office
around
the
country
stay
open
,
and
notwithstand
the
attitudinal
issue
in
respect
of
rural
area
,
it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
maintain
the
infrastructure
and
not
risk
the
demise
of
the
service
as
we
know
it
.
if
that
mean
support
this
legislation
,
then
we
will
support
it
.
we
also
support
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
minister
will
be
proactive
in
term
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Kerr
report
,
will
explore
genuinely
further
cost
reduction
and
will
make
a
genuine
attempt
to
engage
on
the
matter
of
service
of
general
economic
interest
.
we
should
ensure
cash
reserve
be
bolster
in
order
that
everyone
can
continue
to
enjoy
,
if
I
may
use
that
word
,
or
use
the
service
and
there
be
no
risk
of
a
immediate
closure
of
certain
of
its
element
.
I
take
the
opportunity
to
wish
the
minister
,
deputy
Naughten
,
well
in
he
recovery
.
we
wish
he
a
speedy
return
to
the
workplace
.
I
thank
all
the
Deputy
who
contribute
to
the
debate
.
a
considerable
number
have
contribute
to
the
debate
on
this
very
important
Bill
and
stay
throughout
.
the
comment
make
be
reflective
of
the
high
regard
people
have
for
a
Post
,
the
work
it
do
,
its
workforce
and
its
role
in
rural
community
throughout
the
country
and
also
urban
community
,
as
point
out
by
a
number
of
deputy
.
a
number
of
Deputy
have
express
the
view
that
they
cannot
support
the
Bill
for
a
variety
of
reason
.
clearly
,
none
be
do
so
with
a
wish
to
see
a
post
collapse
or
run
out
of
money
or
to
see
worker
not
be
pay
or
service
withdraw
,
but
the
consequence
of
not
support
what
be
effectively
emergency
legislation
to
ensure
a
Post
can
continue
to
pay
its
worker
and
perform
its
duty
have
to
be
acknowledge
.
as

well

it

good
to
see
he
back
on

at

my
question
relate
to
the
universal

do
the

have
a
timeframe
and
what
be
he
detailed
plan
for
revise
the
current
universal
service
obligation
for
telephony

from
basic
copper
telephony
to
ensure
high
-
speed
broadband
connectivity

to
ensure

right

be
the

say
that
the
government
's
position
be
that
it
be
without
ambiguity
seek
a
uso
for
all
premise
and
citizen
?
how
many
people
in
the
minister
's
Department
be
work
on
the
national
broadband
plan
?
the
minister
speak
of
people
be
leave
behind
,
and
across
the
political
landscape
we
all
acknowledge
that
people
,
but
when
will
nobody
be
leave
behind
?
what
be
the
reasonable
expectation
of
people
who
do
not
have
adequate
coverage
for
the
roll
-
out
and
100
%
penetration
?
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
the
minister
could
revert
to
I
with
a
indicative
timeframe
.
it
be
also
important
that
we

how
many
staff
be
work
on
this
important
infrastructural
project
in
the
Department

Communication
,
climate
action

be
the
minister
plan
for
a
scenario
in
which
litigation
be
take
by
one
or
more
of
the
potential
bidder
for
the
national

be
the

make
plan
for
such
a

the

be
support

the
motion
seek
to
examine

of

,
evaluate
the
potential
impact
of
both
undergrounding

analyse

it
seek
to
ensure
no
further
work
be
do
until
this
analysis
and
a
full
community
consultation
take
place
.
nothing
in
what
be
be
ask
for
be
unreasonable
to
we
mind
.
there
be
a
decision
of
a
Bord
Pleanála
but
there
be
precedent
for
take
on
board
independent
advice
,
specifically
the
Grid
Link
project
which
be
a
report
for
the
independent
expert
panel
of
September
2015
.
this
look
at
the
Grid
Link
project
,
a
dogleg
project
link
Cork
,
Wexford
and
Kildare
,
and
make
a
recommendation
to
use
the
regional
option
.
with
series
compensation
,
a
process
of
use
smartgrid
technology
to
allow
more
power
to
flow
through
exist
line
,
it
eliminate
the
need
for
significant
new
transmission
circuit
,
mean
no
new
infrastructure
be
need
.
this
be
a
different
project
and
there
be
pre-exist
infrastructure
but
there
be
a
report
of
a
independent
expert
panel
which
look
at
the
option
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
no
new
infrastructure
be
need
on
Grid
Link
to
manage
the
400
kV
potential
that
be
come
down
the
line
.
if
new
information
come
before
we
and
new
technology
,
as
well
as
precedent
in
other
part
of
the
European
Union
,
we
should
take
they
on
board
if
we
can
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
Fianna
Fáil
motion
that
would
damage
the
long
-
term
potential
of
a
North
-
South
interconnector
.
I
note
the
correspondence
from
a
number
of
business
organisation
in
the
North
of
Ireland
such
as
the
Institute
of
director
,
Manufacturing
Northern
Ireland
,
the
Derry
Chamber
of
Commerce
and
other
who
be
seek
to
remove
the
constraint
in
the
current
market
and
be
seek
the
delivery
of
the
interconnector
because
it
will
place
downward
pressure
on
consumer
bill
.
I
be
quote
directly
from
they
correspondence
.
we
all
agree
on
the
need
for
a
great
degree
of
interoperability
between
North
and
South
across
so
many
different
sector
,
include
electricity
.
there
be
time
,
however
,
when
there
may
be
a
need
to
revise
one
's
opinion
on
issue
when
they
arise
.
if
it
be
have
such
a
impact
,
then
the
community
's
concern
,
as
articulate
by
the
vast
bulk
of
its
representative
,
should
be
hear
.
that
be
why
we
be
support
the
motion
.
I
want
to
refer
specifically
to
the
what
the
minister
say
.
he
indicate
that
there
be
a
report
from
he
chief
technical
adviser
.
it
would
be
appropriate
if
that
advice
be
publish
.
if
he
be
willing
to
place
the
chief
technical
adviser
's
advice
on
the
record
,
it
would
be
pertinent
for
this
House
to
have
sight
of
it
.
this
would
not
do
any
harm
and
it
would
inform
the
House
as
to
the
type
of
advice
the
minister
be
receive
.
I
respectfully
take
issue
with
the
use
of
Brexit
as
a
argument
against
support
the
motion
.
we
all
understand
the
complexity
of
Brexit
as
they
relate
to
the
UK
White
Paper
and
the
letter
issue
by
the
British
Prime
Minister
,
Theresa
May
,
assert
continue
support
for
the
single
electricity
market
.
we
all
understand
that
dynamic
,
but
if
one
of
the
signatory
to
that
market
be
no
long
a
member
of
the
European
Union
,
it
put
a
hole
in
the
minister
's
argument
.
we
must
now
question
the
status
of
the
project
of
common
interest
.
even
though
this
plan
clearly
state
that
energy
project
be
deem
by
the
European
Commission
to
be
of
strategic
cross-border
importance
,
we
must
question
what
the
status
of
that
project
of
common
interest
be
in
the
light
of
the
departure
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
from
the
European
Union
,
notwithstand
we
own
position
of
ensure
that
North
-
South
interconnectedness
should
continue
to
be
embed
in
every
way
,
both
societally
and
economically
.
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
minister
that
use
the
Brexit
argument
as
a
mechanism
to
support
he
position
will
not
cut
the
mustard
for
people
live
in
this
region
.
I
ask
he
to
consider
the
Fianna
Fáil
motion
which
we
be
support
.
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
16
February
2017
.
we
support
the
Bill
.
I
be
take
the
middle
ground
on
this
one
because
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
have
be
quite
generous
in
that
he
seek
to
consult
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
,
particularly
around
the
area
of
the
social
clause
.
when
one
look
at
section
4
of
the
Bill
,
there
be
legitimate
question
as
to
how
one
would
define
a
social
clause
and
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
's
critique
of
section
4
in
regard
to
the
community
benefit
.
I
have
a
question
as
to
whether
one
can
define
a
social
clause
in
a
legally
definitive
way
.
I
look
at
community
benefit
from
the
point
of
view
of
small
local
contract
.
take
the
Scottish
example
,
a
route
1
example
be
of
relatively
low
value
,
low
risk
and
non-repetitive
while
a
route
2
example
be
between
£
50000
and
the
EU
upper
tier
.
it
be
important
that
if
one
can
define
or
create
a
atmosphere
that
ensure
that
where
a
entity
be
go
to
tender
for
a
project
,
where
possible
,
it
would
seek
to
meet
the
need
of
the
community
benefit
requirement
around
training
and
recruitment
,
the
availability
of
subcontracting
opportunity
,
the
facilitation
of
involvement
of
sme
and
the
promotion
of
innovation
and
youth
unemployment
.
I
understand
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
when
he
ask
how
prescriptive
we
be
go
to
be
and
if
we
be
to
bring
it
down
to
a
geographical
area
,
use
the
example
of
Dublin
3
.
be
there
a
compromise
somewhere
in
between
that
allow
we
to
have
robust
legislation
that
stand
up
to
scrutiny
down
the
line
,
speak
to
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
I
speak
of
and
ensure
that
as
many
local
people
as
possible
can
bid
for
local
contract
,
thereby
maintain
regional
,
local
economic
growth
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
specifically
to
the
devolve
grant
scheme
.
I
contend
that
the
devolve
grant
scheme
as
it
relate
to
the
school
building
programme
be
largely
a
good
scheme
,
and
we
oversee
that
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
government
,
where
we
give
either
educational
and
training
board
,
etb
,
or
individual
school
a
degree
of
autonomy
over
building
project
.
however
,
in
one
instance
,
I
witness
a
scenario
where
small
subcontractor
under
that
scheme
be
leave
high
and
dry
have
complete
work
,
and
they
have
no
recourse
to
law
or
to
the
originator
of
the
scheme
,
that
be
,
the
school
board
,
and
this
represent
a
serious
flaw
in
that
scheme
.
I
can
see
the
merit
of
use
the
devolve
school
programme
as
a
pilot
project
administer
by
the
National
Development
Finance
Agency
.
the
project
be
worth
approximately
€
70
million
in
total
,
but
throw
up
some
exception
around
subcontractor
which
be
stiff
when
it
come
to
get
pay
for
work
that
they
have
carry
out
and
very
good
legitimate
company
in
that
context
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
offer
a
degree
of
consultation
and
he
have
say
that
a
copy
of
the
Bill
have
be
forward
to
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
with
a
request
for
view
on
the
text
to
see
if
it
comply
with
EU
directive
and
treaty
principle
.
that
be
worthwhile
and
we
would
agree
with
it
.
I
hope
that
consultation
could
be
widen
if
possible
.
I
commend
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
public
engagement
on
the
issue
of
public
procurement
.
he
have
travel
throughout
the
county
to
engage
with
business
and
the
SME
sector
.
I
believe
he
to
be
genuine
in
that
endeavour
.
I
hope
the
feedback
from
that
community
will
find
its
way
into
a
framework
that
ensure
the
local
business
that
sustain
we
community
,
include
intergenerational
family
-
own
business
which
be
compete
on
this
tender
,
will
feel
they
have
a
shot
at
tender
for
public
service
and
do
not
feel
sideline
because
they
be
not
operate
at
the
right
type
of
economy
of
scale
or
they
do
not
have
the
right
kind
of
in
-

we
need
to
ensure
they
do
not
have
to
expend
too
much
of
they
resource
when
it
come
to
tender
particularly
for
small
project
within
the
overall
procurement
offering
.
perhaps
when
the
Bill
go
to
its
next
stage
the
Minister
of
State
will
provide
a
critique
or
give
we
he
opinion
on
the
Scottish
model
of
procurement
,
which
be
reference
by
deputy
Dara
Calleary
.
it
have
three

route
.
it
have
gain
momentum
and
be
use
as
a
example
.
obviously
,
Ireland
be
a
similar
country
and
perhaps
it
could
be
use
as
a
potential
model
.
I
will
leave
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
in
due
course
.
I
be
hopeful
the
Minister
of
State
might
come
back
to
we
on
whether
it
be
possible
to
provide
a
robust
legal
definition
of
social
clause
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
already
critique
section
4
of
the
Bill
.
there
be
nothing
in
section
4
that
be
objectionable
in
try
to
get
the
good
of
the
procurement
process
back
into
the
community
that
we
serve
.
if
the
Bill
intend
to
improve
the
economic
,
social
and
environmental
well
-
being
of
community
,
it
be
not
bad
.
I
be
sure
there
can
be
a
meeting
of
mind
and
compromise
on
the
legislation
.
we
support
the
legislation
and
look
forward
to
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
finance
,
Public
expenditure
and
Reform
,
pursuant
to
standing
order

we
should
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
official
in
consolidate
this
legislation
.
it
be
legislation
that
go
back
to
the
1940s
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
it
be
no
easy
task
to
do
such
a
thing
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
work
the
official
have
do
on
this
.
I
will
be
very
brief
.
we
be
support
the
Bill
.
I
will
add
my
name
to
the
list
of
people
who
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
dolomite
and
dolomitic
limestone
.
I
have
a
submission
and
I
be
sure
other
member
have
the
same
submission
on
the
interpretation
of
mineral
.
the
Minister
of
State
deal
with
this
in
the
Seanad
.
there
be
a
definition
of
mineral
which
attempt
to
provide
clarity
on
where
limestone
end
and
where
dolomitic
limestone
start
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
give
some
indication
that
he
will
deal
with
this
on
Committee
stage
.
I
will
read
a
extract
from
correspondence
I
receive
:
section
2
Interpretation
"
Minerals
"
attempt
to
provide
clarity
on
the
definition
of
where
limestone
end
and
dolomitic

start

section

Interpretation
''

''
(
f
)
dolomitic
limestone
that
occur
in
association
with
dolomite
in
a
deposit
where
dolomite
be
less
than
85
per
cent
of
the
deposit
;
''
my
correspondent
state
there
be
a
difficulty
with
this
implementation
:
the
implementation
of
what
be
dolomitic
Limestone
and
what
be
limestone
be
subjective
.
inconsistent
implementation
under
the
current
mineral
act
have
be
very
subjective
where
large
scale
multi
National
company
have
exploit
deposit
of
dolomitic
limestone
...
this
section
have
the
potential
for
distortion
of
the
market
where
one
deposit
be
consider
limestone
and
another
dolomitic
Limestone
.
he
go
on
to
say
:
example
of
where
dolomite
product
compete
with
limestone
product
in
the
same
market
place
be
in
refractory
production
,
(
one
company
use
limestone
and
salt
water
in
the
production
of
high
end
refractory
for
furnace
without
contribute
any
royalty
,
yet
to
produce
similar
refractory
with
a
dolomitic
limestone
a
royalty
payment
would
be
compulsory
)
.
this
be
issue
that
be
familiar
to
the
official
.
they
be
familiar
to
the
minister
.
I
want
to
state
they
for
the
public
record
.
if
there
be
a
mechanism
to
deal
with
this
by
way
of
government
amendment
on
committee
stage
,
we
would
welcome
such
a
clarification
.
I
see
no
need
to
delay
proceedings
tonight
.
we
be
in
favour
of
the
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
official
and
if
the
issue
of
dolomite
and
dolomitic
extraction
be
deal
with
,
we
will
be
very
satisfied
.
or
at
some
further
date
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
he
latitude
.
the
question
that
arise
be
whether
a
pathway
can
be
provide
within
exist
legislation
.
we
need
a
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
be
the
case
that
a
medical
practitioner
can
apply
for
a
licence
to
administer
the
specific
medication
that
be
deem
to
be
require
in
this
case
.
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
the
family
in
question
-
the
Twomey
family
-
if
the
Taoiseach
could
clarify
the
position
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
innovation
pursuant
to
standing
order
84a
(
3
)
(
a
)
and
141
.
the
issue
I
be
raise
concern
the
pend
case
against
Ireland
by
the
European
Commission
at
the
European
Court
of
Justice
in
regard
to
the
failure
by
the
State
,
between
2000
and
2005
,
to
meet
deadline
set
for
the
upgrading
of
exist
sewage
treatment
plant
and
completion
of
new
plant
.
that
failure
be
affect
38
town
throughout
the
country
,
include
Cork
city
,
Fermoy
,
Mallow
,
Midleton
,
Ballincollig
,
Ringaskiddy
,
Youghal

and
Ballybofey
in

;

and
Thurles
in
County
Tipperary
;
as
well
as
,
among
other
,
Kilkenny
,
Dundalk
,
Enniscorthy
and
Killarney
.
Ireland
have
until
the
end
of
2005
to
ensure
any
urban
area
with
a
population
base
of
more
than
15000
have
adequate
sewage
treatment
facility
to
prevent
discharge
from
that
medium
-
size
town
into
river
,
lake
and
estuary
.
it
be
a
public
health
issue
.
we
be
experience
some
turmoil
in
this
house
at
the
moment
on
the
issue
of
water
charge
.
in
that
context
,
I
be
concerned
there
may
not
be
enough
capital
funding
available
to
complete
sewage
and
wastewater
treatment
plant
upgrade
.
Irish
Water
have
estimate
that
all
sewage
treatment
plant
will
be
upgrade
by
2021
,
at
a
slate
cost
of
€
1.2
billion
.
in
the
current
climate
,
however
,
with
the
ongoing
debate
on
water
charge
,
it
seem
likely
there
may
be
slippage
on
that
target
.
will
the
minister
give
a
assurance
to
the
affect
town
that
they
will
have
access
to
reliable
,
adequate
and
safe
wastewater
and
sewage
treatment
plant
?
will
he
further
guarantee
there
will
be
no
slippage
in
the
budget
line
and
that
the
target
which
need
to
be
meet
by
2021
will
continue
to
be
meet
?
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
engage
with
I
on
this
issue
and
I
recognise
that
blame
be
lay
at
successive
government
's
door
.
we
have
not
tackle
this
issue
as
a
country
in
as
proactive
a
way
as
we
should
have
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
debate
on
the
future
of
water
and
wastewater
treatment
service
,
I
be
not
convinced
that
the
current
investment
plan
will
be
follow
through
and
that
the
government
can
guarantee
that
capital
expenditure
will
be
make
available
to
meet
the
need
of
the
remain
38
town
and
agglomeration
identify
by
the
European
Commission
.
we
must
ensure
that
the
capital
expenditure
be
lock
down
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
committee
's
deliberation
when
it
report
to
the
House
.
this
be
a
public
safety
issue
,
one
in
which
the
health
of
we
citizen
come
into
play
,
and
we
need
to
maintain
a
investment
plan
.
there
have
never
be
a
more
opportune
time
to
do
so
.
I
worry
that
water
and
wastewater
investment
will
slip
down
the
agenda
.
if
it
compete
with
,
for
example
,
capital
expenditure
on
road
,
school
or
hospital
,
all
of
which
be
necessary
,
it
will
become
the
poor
relation
even
though
it
be
most
vital
to
we
need
.
I
hope
that
we
can
continue
to
ensure
that
the
budget
of
€
1
billion
plus
for
the
investment
plan
be
lock
down
so
that
the
2021
target
can
be
achieve
and
the
need
of
the
38
town
and
agglomeration
will
be
cater
for
.
be
the
€
1
billion
secure
?
regardless
of
the
charging
regime
?
we
support
the
motion
.

the
proceedings
before

allow
interested
party
to
hide
until
such
time
as
the
Supreme
Court
have
find
in
favour
of
one
side
or
the
other
.
the
government
may
also
be
hide
behind
the
Supreme
Court
decision
because
,
although
it
announce
the
extension
of
the
insurance
compensation
fund
in
July
2016
,
it
seem
the
minister
be
now
say
a
legislative
proposal
to
implement
the
report
will
be
bring
to
government
for
approval
in
the
come
month
.
he
do
not
use
the
word
"
head
of
a
Bill
"
and
there
seem
to
be
some
slippage
already
in
the
timeline
for
legislation
to
provide
certainty
in
this
matter
.
the
finance
committee
have
do
much
work
to
tackle
the
issue
articulate
by
Deputy
Neville
and
Ó
Laoghaire
on
the
particular
circumstance
in
which
motorist
find
themselves
,
particularly
that
who
have
be
price
out
of
the
market
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
have
to
emigrate
and
be
now
return
home
.
we
require
certainty
to
plug
the
glaring
lacuna
in
the
legislation
around
this
matter
.
if
it
be
not
address
,
there
be
the
prospect
of
motorist
have
loading
cost
on
they
premium
of
up
to
€
80
.
the
MIBI
documentation
contain
estimate
that
the
cost
of
claim
for
they
member
,
against
uninsured
and
untraced
driver
,
be
north
of
€
58.4
million
.
the
MIBI
state
that
Setanta
pose
a
liability
of
€
90
million
,
the
impact
of
which
be
a
additional
€
52
.
the
Supreme
Court
have
to
iron
out
how
Irish
law
understand
the
responsibility
of
MIBI
.
other
member
have
refer
to
timeline
but
this
go
back
to
September
2015
and
the
first
high
court
judgment
.
the
late
instalment
be
the
October
2016
reserve
judgment
.
I
be
delighted
that
the
government
be
abstain
on
the
motion
because
there
be
agreement
on
the
broad
principle
of
the
motion
.
the
consumer
demand
be
very
clear
.
they
want
transparency
and
easily
accessible
information
on
the
product
they
be
purchase
.
they
also
want
to
know
,
in
a
simple
format
,
if
the
liquidity
and
provisioning
arrangement
for
that
insurance
house
,
from
which
they
be
purchase
product
,
be
robust
so
as
to
offset
the
risk
of
non-payment
of
claim
in
the
future
.
Consumer
quite
simply
demand
transparency
and
easily
accessible
information
,
which
be
something
that
will
have
to
be
deal
with
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
minister
say
about
the
Central
Bank
conduct
a
thematic
review
and
inspection
of
manage
general
agent
or
mga
.
however
,
we
need
further
information
and
clarity
on
what
that
mean
.
while
we
support
the
motion
,
it
be
important
to
have
legal
certainty
on
the
Setanta
issue
and
other
insurance
house
.
motorist
with
legitimate
expectation
have
be
wait
too
long
for
justice
,
despite
have
judgment
in
they
favour
for
recognise
claim
.
with
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
and
the
minister
,
I
fully
support
and
welcome
the
publication
and
transposition
of
the
directive
.
it
be
interesting
,
when
we
read
the
background
information
,
to
note
that
it
begin
in
the
early
noughty
in
the
European
Union
with
a
Council
framework
decision
and
that
it
have
take
a
lengthy
period
for
it
to
be
properly
transpose
,
formalise
and
put
on
a
statutory
footing
in
Irish
law
.
what
be
unfortunate
-
this
be
something
we
see
too
often
-
be
how
long
it
take
to
have
positive
idea
at
EU
level
properly
transpose
or
agree
to
at
member
state
level
.
it
be
welcome
that
Directive
2012
/
29
/
EU
be
be
transpose
.
to
make
a
broad
point
,
it
be
important
that
we
have
a
framework
place
on
a
statutory
basis
to
put
the
victim
of
a
crime
at
the
centre
of
Irish
law
.
we
all
know
and
have
meet
victim
of
crime
.
we
have
all
be
victim
of
various
criminal
offence
at
various
time
in
we
life
.
it
be
important
that
victim
of
crime
have
rights
and
be
able
to
contact
,
and
have
positive
interaction
with
,
the
various
statutory
agency
.
as
outline
,
the
fundamental
tenet
be
communication
and
that
review
of
decision
can
be
make
at
the
various
stage
of
the
process
.
the
recent
O'Higgin
report
detailed
serious
deficiency
in
how
victim
be
provide
with
information
.
this
uncertainty
for
victim
be
worry
and
have
a
significant
effect
on
they
and
they
family
.
it
be
important
,
as
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
state
,
that
the
agency
of
the
State
be
accountable
to
victim
and
that
they
provide
a
proper
mechanism
and
review
process
as
a
crime
investigation
be
progress
.
this
morning
at
a
meeting
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
Ms
Maria
McDonald
speak
on
behalf
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
.
she
make
a
excellent
presentation
on
penal
reform
in
which
she
highlight
a
number
of
important
point
.
they
be
worth
note
.
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
be
very
positive
about
the
Bill
and
welcome
the
minister
's
work
in
that
regard
,
but
,
as
deputy
Jim
O'Callaghan
mention
,
there
be
question
about
restorative
justice
and
why
there
be
no
statutory
restorative
justice
scheme
in
place
.
the
strategic
review
of
penal
policy
acknowledge
that
the
directive
promote
the
appropriate
use
of
restorative
justice
service
.
this
be
in
line
with
the
delivery
of
such
service
in
the
State
.
the
directive
state
"
restorative
justice
"
mean
"
any
process
whereby
the
victim
and
the
offender
be
enable
,
if
they
freely
consent
,
to
participate
actively
in
the
resolution
of
matter
arise
from
the
criminal
offence
through
the
help
of
a
impartial
third
party
"
.
it
be
important
to
address
some
of
the
concern
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
.
while
it
welcome
the
centralising
of
the
victim
in
statutory
rights
,
it
be
concerned
that
restorative
justice
have
not
be
include
and
formalise
as
part
of
the
process
.
as
we
all
know
,
we
only
get
one
chance
in
the
short
to
medium
term
to
deal
with
legislation
to
transpose
a
directive
.
as
it
be
unlikely
that
we
will
revisit
this
option
properly
and
positively
in
the
year
to
come
,
we
,
therefore
,
need
to
get
this
right
and
ensure
we
do
not
dilute
the
potential
rights
of
victim
as
part
of
the
legislation
.
the
report
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance

deal
with
legislation
to
transpose
a
directive
.
as
it
be
unlikely
that
we
will
revisit
this
option
properly
and
positively
in
the
year
to
come
,
we
,
therefore
,
need
to
get
this
right
and
ensure
we
do
not
dilute
the
potential
rights
of
victim
as
part
of
the
legislation
.
the
report
of
the
Victim
Right
Alliance
state
72
%
of
victim
feel
they
have
be
revictimise
by
the
criminal
justice
system
,
while
more
than
40
%
feel
they
have
be
revictimise
by
the
accuse
.
I
hope
the
legislation
and
the
work
that
will
flow
from
it
will
reduce
this
alarming
rate
to
ensure
the
victim
will
be
put
at
the
centre
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
context
of
other
balancing
rights
.
this
be
important
legislation
which
I
hope
we
and
the
minister
will
get
right
.
I
wish
to
speak
to
section
5
,
le
do
thoil
.
I
receive
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
I
have
propose
a
amendment
to
section
70
of
the
Health
Act
1970
and
I
will
refer
specifically
to
that
section
.
my
propose
amendment
related
to
screen
test
for
foetal
anomaly
.
the
original
wording
go
back
to
1970
be
that
"
a
health
board
shall
make
arrangement
for
carry
out
test
on
person
without
charge
,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertain
the
presence
of
a
particular
disease
,
defect
or
condition
that
may
be
prescribe
"
.
I
have
propose
a
amendment
to
that
which
state
that
"
without
prejudice
to
the
generality
of
section
70
,
arrangement
make
under
that
section
shall
include
arrangement
for
carry
out
without
charge
ultrasound
and
other
standardise
prenatal
foetal
diagnostic
test
,
to
accurately
date
the
pregnancy
and
to
assess
the
foetus
for
diagnosable
anomaly
or
defect
,
during
the
antenatal
period
"
.
I
be
very
surprised
to
receive
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
which
state
that
he
regret
to
inform
I
that
my
amendment
tab
at
this
stage
have
be
rule
out
of
order
as
it
involve
a
potential
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
all
I
seek
to
do
be
to
make
a
amendment
to
ensure
that
the
language
of
the
1970
Act
be
update
to
ensure
that
,
as
of
right
,
every
woman
will
have
access
to
the
foetal
anomaly
scan
in
pregnancy
and
to
make
sure
there
be
some
degree
of
universality
around
that
.
I
do
not
understand
why
that
be
deem
to
be
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
I
speak
very
briefly
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
about
this
today
and
I
be
hopeful
this
can
be
address
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
HSE
's
national
woman
and
infant
health
programme
and
the
issue
around
the
recruitment
of
ultrasonographer
in
the
State
.
I
refer
specifically
to
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
where
not
every
woman
have
access
to
that
vital
scan
.
if
we
be
talk
about
positive
outcome
for
baby
and
mother
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
have
this
scan
so
we
can
ensure
the
good
outcome
for
both
mother
and
child
.
I
fail
to
understand
how
my
amendment
could
be
deem
to
potentially
put
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
when
the
1970
Act
already
state
that
the
health
board
"
shall
make
arrangement
for
carry
out
test
on
person
without
charge
,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertain
the
presence
of
a
particular
disease
,
defect
or
condition
that
may
be
prescribe
"
.
I
be
hopeful
at
this
late
hour
,
even
though
the
amendment
be
tab
in
good
time
,
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
address
the
issue
and
,
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
,
ensure
that
woman
who
do
not
have
access
to
this
scan
at
present
will
have
access
to
they
and
that
there
will
be
adequate
resource
deploy
through
the
national
maternity
strategy
.
it
be
the
language
of
the
national
maternity
strategy
I
be
use
here
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
access
be
not
deny
to
woman
and
that
the
resource
be
deploy
.
I
take
some
solace
from
the
fact
that
,
with
the
restructuring
of
hospital
group
,
a
new
clinical
director
of
the
woman
and
child
service
directorate
for
the
South
/
South
West
hospital
group
be
appoint
on
27
February
2017
.
I
understand
a
order
have
be
make
under
section
16
of
the
Health
Act
subdelegate
certain
function
in
maternity
service
to
a
person
.
I
understand
that
that
function
have
be
delegate
be
a
positive
move
.
the
question
be
whether
that
delegate
function
will
result
in
a
budget
line
that
will
ensure
every
woman
in
the
region
I
serve
will
have
access
to
the
scan
.
we
cannot
have
a
situation
in
this
country
where
some
woman
be
deny
access
to
scan
by
dint
of
geography
.
we
know
what
the
import
of
this
scan
be
in
term
of
the
good
outcome
for
mother
and
baby
.
it
be
a
public
health
issue
and
I
be
hopeful
the
Minister
of
State
will
address
the
point
I
make
in
a
non-partisan
way
.
it
be
something
that
affect
all
of
we
.
it
be
a
positive
move
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
inclined
to
accept
my
amendment
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
inclined
to
address
the
issue
before
we
it
would
be
very
beneficial
to
the
woman
and
child
of
the
Munster
region
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
position
be
contradictory
.
I
tab

question

254
on

February

effectively
,
I
ask
whether
all
pregnant
woman
in
Ireland
have
access
to
a
foetal
anomaly
scan
and
for
the
number
of
foetal
anomaly
scan
relative
to
actual
birth
for
every
individual
maternity
unit
in
the
State
for
the
year
2015
and
2016
in
tabular
form
.
I
will
cite
the
HSE
's
response
for
the
record
,
so
I
hope
the
departmental
official
and
the
minister
of
State
be
take
note
.
accord
to
the
response
,
foetal
anomaly
scanning
be
not
available
to
all
pregnant
woman
in
the
public
health
system
.
the
three
maternity
hospital
in
Dublin
and
the
unit
in
Galway
and
Waterford
provide
100
%
access
,
but
most
of
the
remain
unit
only
provide
some
access
to
scanning
,
usually
where
it
be
clinically
indicate
or
base
on
other
agree
criterion
.
in
the
context
of
the
1970
Act
,
every
woman
as
of
right
should
have
the
scan
available
to
she
regardless
of
whether
it
be
clinically
indicate
.
also
accord
to
the
response
,
the
NWIHP
do
not
currently
collect
the
information
that
I
have
request
.
we
do
not
even
have
proper
datum
on
the

of

in
Ireland
.

and

figure

that
approximately
23000
woman
,
accounting
for
36
%
of
all
birth
each
year
,
be
not
able
to
access
publicly
fund
anomaly
scan
.
the
consultant
be
happy
to
share
this
datum
.
this
be
a
matter
of
record
within
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
through
the
health
committee
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
contradict
what
the
HSE
and
,
base
on
they
datum
analysis
,
the
consultant
be
tell
I
.
as
a
matter
of
urgency
,
we
must
reach
the
point
whereby
woman
in
the
region
in
question
-
particularly
in
Cork
,
but
not
just
there
-
have
access
to
this
scan
,
not
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
nwihp
,
but
now
.
I
would
like
the
Minister
of
State
to
reply
to
the
effect
that
the
government
,
of
which
he
be
a
part
,
will
do
its
utmost
to
ensure
that
a
process
be
put
in
place
to
recruit
sonographer
within
the
first
or
,
at
the
late
,
second
quarter
of
this
year
.
we
be

.
be
I
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
would
not
rely
on
the
Fine
Gael
Minister
for
a
answer
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
point
about
take
this
debate
,
but
I
be
sure
that
he
have
a
position
on
the
matter
as
a
member
of
the
government
through
the
independent
Alliance
.
he
have
a
responsibility
for
this
issue
as
well
,
if
I
may
put
it
so
bluntly
.
it
be
not
just
a
Fine
Gael
responsibility
.
I
feel
strongly
about
this
matter
.
if
we
be
to
be
equal
in
we
treatment
of
patient
,
every
woman
and
child
must
,
as
a
right
and
a
public
health
issue
,
have
access
to
this
scan
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be

where
do
the
buck
stop
on
that
?
have
the
Tánaiste
faith
in
the
Policing
Authority
?
it
be
a
simple
question
.
if
the
Tánaiste
have
faith
in
the
Policing
Authority
and
if
she
have
know
about
this
since
June
2016
,
why
do
she
leave
it
until
yesterday
,
accord
to
she
statement
,
to
meet
Josephine

the

of
the
authority
,
to
state
that
she
be
formally
refer
this
issue
to
she
under
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
?
what
I
be
try
to
understand
be
the
internal
dynamic
that
exist
between
the
Tánaiste
,
the
Garda
Commissioner
,
the
Garda
Inspectorate
and
the
Policing
Authority
.
person
watch
this
proceedings
will
question
why
the
Policing
Authority
issue
a
statement
today
that
state
:
the
Authority
again
express
its
disappointment
at
not
be
advise
in
a
timely
manner
that
a
audit
into
the
breath
test
issue
be
underway
.
despite
question
over
several
month
,
the
Authority
have
not
[...]
be
provide
with
the
full
internal
report
or
indeed
a
clear
sense
of
how
this
matter
have
be
handle
to
date
within
the
Garda
Síochána
or
the
status
and
content
of
the
audit
which
have
be
undertake
.
the
Authority
consider
the
correspondence
receive
from
the
Garda
Commissioner
on
Friday
24
March
last
in
which
the
Commissioner
request
that
the
Authority
refer
a
number
of
matter
to
the
Garda
Inspectorate
.
what
I
be
try
to
get
at
be
the
reason
the
Policing
Authority
would
issue
a
statement
of
this
nature
.
one
can
only
surmise
,
and
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
to
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
that
the
government
do
not
have
enough
faith
in
the
Policing
Authority
due
to
its
not
engage
in
a
more
timely
fashion
with
the
Department
regard
the
modality
of
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
to
correct
I
then
.
whose
obligation
be
that
?
I
have
limited
time
.
this
speak
to
the
heart
of
the
culture
of
management
in
a
Garda
Síochána
.
again
,
there
be
a
inherent
weakness
in
this
regard
.
there
should
have
be
a
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
Garda
Síochána
,
surely
,
to
inform
the
Policing
Authority
in
a
timely
fashion
.
do
the
Tánaiste
agree
with
that
statement
?
this
be
very
serious
.
yes
,
but
,
a

I
appreciate
that
.
we
can
no

decision
must
be
take
as
to
how
the
force
be
manage
.
I
understand
the
predicament
in
which
the
Tánaiste
find
herself
,
but
we
need
to
hear
about
concrete
action
from
she
.
give
that
we
have
a
Garda
Inspectorate
,
a
Policing
Authority
and
a
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
when
can
we
expect
to
see
a
root
-
and
-
branch
change
,
and
why
do
a
external
service
need
to
do
this
when
we
have
two
state
entity
already
?
there
be
quite
a
number
of
quite
sensible
recommendation
in
the
Garda
inspectorate
report
.
we
should
now
see
the
implementation
of
this
and
a
political
willingness
to
do
so
.
that
be
the
message
we
need
to
hear
in
this
house
because
the
people
outside
this
wall
,
with
every
new
scandal
that
emerge
,
be
lose
faith
in
policing
in
this
country
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
I
refer
again
to
the
Tánaiste
's
statement
that
there
will
be
some
remedy
for
that
who
be
incorrectly
convict
.
I
wish
to
quote
directly
from
she
full
write
speech
again
.
it
state
,
"
letter
will
begin
issue
to
this
individual
on
3
April
.
"
it
also
state
,
"
all
of
this
case
will
be
appeal
by
a
Garda
Síochána
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
court
set
aside
this
conviction
,
all
fine
will
be
reimburse
and
penalty
remove
,
and
all
of
that
affect
will
be
contact
directly
by
a
Garda
Síochána
.
"
she
state
definitively
that
this
conviction
will
be
overturn
.
what
further
remedy
,
if
any
,
be
open
to
this
people
who
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
may
feel
as
if
they
good
name
be
tarnish
in
have
to
appear
before
judge
in
district
court
,
potentially
on
unsound
conviction
?
will
there
be
further
remedy
besides
the
issuing
of
the
letter
and
the
revocation
of
the
fine
so
that
that
affect
might
have
they
good

restore

today
mark
a

day
for

the
majority
of
people
there
vote
against

,
and
at
lunchtime
today
a
letter
from
Theresa
May
will
be
present
to
Donald
Tusk
as
the
UK
activate
article
50
to
begin
the
process
of
leave
the
EU
.
we
face
the
prospect
of
a
hard
border
with
at
least
some
,
possibly
major
,
change
to
trade
on
we
island
,
and
even
large
disruption
to
we
all
-
island
link
but
Northern
Ireland
have
no
power
share
executive
to
advocate
on
its
own
behalf
.
a
week
ago
Martin
McGuinness
be
lay
to
rest
and
I
pass
my
condolence
to
the
family
of
Martin
.
I
sit
across
the
table
from
he
when
I
accompany
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
during
the
Fresh
start
negotiation
and
I
develop
a
great
respect
for
he
on
a
personal
level
.
I
be
always
strike
by
the
fact
that
he
be
as
comfortable
travel
the
world
,
market
Northern
Ireland
as
a
place
to
invest
,
as
he
be
back
home
in
he
native
Derry
.
I
offer
my
personal
condolence
to
the
Sinn
Féin
Party
and
to
Mrs.
McGuinness
and
they
family
,
as
well
as
the
people
of
Derry
because
he
be
of
Derry
and
that
give
he
a
humility
.
he
always
have
a
sense
of
where
he
come
from
and
whether
he
be
in
Washington
or
elsewhere
he
always
feel
the
draw
of
he
native
Derry
.
he
will
be
sadly
miss
by
people
across
this
island
.
many
of
the
principal
actor
from
the
peace
process
gather
in
Derry
-
people
who
put
year
into
secure
a
lasting
legacy
of
peace
for
Northern
Ireland
.
it
be
nearly
two
decade
on
since
the
good
Friday
agreement
but
,
once
again
,
the
formation
of
a
power
-
share
executive
be
hold
the
future
of
Northern
Ireland
back
.
there
be
no
desire
for
another
election
nor
do
we
want
to
see
direct
rule
impose
.
a
London
Administration
distract
by
Brexit
be
not
in
a
position
to
secure
fully
the
future
of
Northern
Ireland
.
some
of
the
same
issue
that
arise
during
the
previous
negotiation
on
the
Fresh
start
agreement
and
at
Stormont
be
still
on
the
table
now
.
I
refer
to
the
Irish
language
Act
,
fiscal
matter
,
the
bill
of
rights
and
legacy
issue
include
equality
generally
and
marriage
equality
in
particular
.
New
election
will
not
achieve
anything
.
there
be
now
a
window
up
to
Easter
to
reach
agreement
and
I
hope
that
opportunity
can
be
seize
.
on
Brexit
and
the
North
-
South
relationship
,
the
Labour
Party
support
the
call
for
a
bespoke
deal
for
Northern
Ireland
to
address
the
follow
issue
post
-
Brexit
:
the
strengthening
of
exist
all
-
island
institution
,
continue
cross-border
co-operation
,
guarantee
of
funding
for
Northern
Ireland
beyond
2020
,
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
200000
person
resident
on
the
island
who
be
neither
Irish
nor
British
citizen
and
the
need
for
parity
of
esteem
in
human
rights
protection
across
the
island
.
this
week
we
publish
a
comprehensive
paper
on
Brexit
with
20
key
action
we
call
on
the
government
to
take
.
four
of
that
action
relate
directly
to
Northern
Ireland
and
another
three
relate
to
the
common
travel
area
.
there
be
no
simple
solution
to
resolve
the
problem
the
island
will
face
when
the
UK
exit
the
European
Union
and
the
potentially
devastating
impact
it
will
have
on
Northern
Ireland
and
the
peace
process
.
we
support
the
call
for
special
status
for
Northern
Ireland
within
the
European
Union
.
however
,
with
no
settle
position
among
the
Northern
Ireland
party
and
the
absence
of
a
power
-
share
executive
,
combine
with
the
state
intention
of
Prime
Minister
May
for
the
UK
to
exit
the
single
Market
,
a
possible
path
forward
have
be
outline
but
with
no
leader
from
the
region
in
a
position
to
advocate
within
the
European
Union
for
it
.
we
believe
there
should
be
a
separate
strand
to
the
article
50
negotiation
to
deal
specifically
with
Ireland
-
UK
issue
and
Northern
Ireland
.
fail
that
,
European
Union
consent
should
be
grant
for
a
bilateral
agreement
to
be
negotiate
between
the
two
jurisdiction
to
address
border
issue
.
that
must
be
address
when
Donald
Tusk
and
the
European
Council
provide
they
negotiating
priority
to
the
European
Commission
.
it
be
we
belief
that
a
new
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
must
be
include
follow
Brexit
.
such
a
protocol
would
acknowledge
and
recognise
the
special
circumstance
that
apply
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
we
support
special
status
for
Northern
Ireland
.
however
,
no
unite
position
have
emerge
in
Northern
Ireland
or
in
the
UK
that
could
or
would
negotiate
for
such
a
arrangement
.
a
Irish
protocol
must
also
provide
for
any
future
unite
Ireland
or
other
transitional
status
.
I
welcome
the
clarity
on
this
issue
secure
by
the
SDLP
yesterday
that
Northern
Ireland
,
if
unite
with
Ireland
,
would
not
be
oblige
to
reapply
to
join
the
European
Union
.
the
Labour
Party
have
also
call
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
in
future
negotiation
,
uphold
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
in
human
rights
protection
across
the
island
,
as
guarantee
under
the
good
Friday
agreement
.
of
particular
concern
to
we
be
how
the
rights
of
more
than
30000
cross-border
worker
will
be
accommodate
and
protect
in
the
future
.
employment
rights
should
be
protect
,
either
in
the
final
EU
-
UK
exit
agreement
,
in
a
new
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
or
in
a
separate
bilateral
agreement
between
Ireland
and
the
UK
.
again
,
that
overlap
with
the
common
travel
area
and
the
rights
provide
through
it
.
there
have
be
too
little
discussion
about
the
future
of
the
North
-
South
cross-Border
implementation
body
.
clarification
be
need
on
how
the
six
body
will
continue
to
operate
and
how
they
will
be
fund
into
the
future
.
there
will
be
specific
European
Union
fronty
border
issue
that
will
affect
the
operation
of
Waterways
Ireland
and
the
Loughs
Agency
.
New
cross-border
body
could
resolve
Brexit
issue
in
energy
and
the
agriculture
sector
.
there
be
a
number
of
policy
area
in
which
all
island
co-operation
have
intensify
and
strengthen
in
recent
year
through
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
.
co-operation
have
be
focus
in
six
area
,
namely
,
agriculture
,
education
,
environment
,
health
,
tourism
and
transport
.
integration
have
also
be
strong
in
many
specific
sector
and
area
,
for
example
in
animal
welfare
,
cross-border
trade
in
livestock
and
agricultural
product
such
as
milk
,
the
energy
sector
,
promotion
of
the
island
of
Ireland
and
accident
and
emergency
service
planning
for
hospital
catchment
area
.
there
be
also
now
the
potential
for
the
creation
of
new
North
-
South
body
to
address
the
problem
that
Brexit
and
a
hard
Border
could
create
.
the
SDLP
have
propose
a
number
of
new
structure
which
we
believe
deserve
strong
consideration
.
we
also
believe
a
new
body
to
oversee
the
all
-
island
energy
market
be
require
.
the
creation
of
that
would
require
extensive
consultation
and
detailed
technical
work
.
at
a
minimum
,
the
North
-
South
body
should
be
specifically
recognise
in
the
propose
Irish
protocol
to
the
European
Union
treaty
along
with
provision
for
the
creation
of
new
body
.
the
Labour
Party
also
believe
that
future
funding
should
be
guarantee
by
the
UK
government
beyond
2020
for
a
new
peace
V
programme
,
and
that
a
European
Union
contribution
could
be
channel
to
the
special
European
Union
Programmes
Body
,
SEUPB
,
through
the
Irish
government
.
we
view
be
that
the
UK
exite
the
EU
be
harmful
to
future
UK
and
Irish
joint
co-operation
regard
Northern
Ireland
and
the
peace
process
.
we
believe
we
must
now
redirect
we
effort
to
ensure
that
the
advance
for
Northern
Ireland
,
as
secure
through
and
within
European
Union
structure
,
be
maintain
and
to
ensure
that
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
not
undermine
by
the
UK
exite
the
European
Union
.
British
representative
must
take
the
unique
circumstance
of
Northern
Ireland
and
the
good
Friday
agreement
into
account
in
they
negotiation
with
European
Union
official
.
the
Labour
Party
consider
the
return
of
a
land
border
between
Ireland
and
Northern
Ireland
to
be
unacceptable
.
I
will
conclude
by
refer
to
the
RHI
scandal
,
which
I
have
not
intend
mention
.
it
have
cost
the
British
Exchequer
approximately
£
500
million
at
this
juncture
.
it
speak
to
the
need
to
ensure
the
budgetary
control
element
that
be
stitch
into
a
Fresh
start
,
the
Stormont
agreement
and
implementation
plan
.
I
refer
specifically
to
4.1
under
the
budget
control
head
.
the
UK
government
welcome
the
executive
's
plan
to
establish
a
independent
fiscal
Council
for
Northern
Ireland
.
the
Council
will
:
prepare
a
annual
assessment
of
the
executive
's
revenue
stream
and
spending
proposal
and
how
this
allow
the
executive
to
balance
they
budget
.
the
RHI
scandal
speak
volume
to
the
culture
of
governance
within
the
executive
.
in
my
short
time
there
I
observe
that
oversight
of
spending
be
perhaps
lack
due
to
it
be
a
political
system
where
people
operate
within
very
distinct
and
bespoke
political
silo
in
term
of
run
Department
.
far
be
it
from
I
to
comment
on
the
internal
affair
there
,
except
to
say
that
£
500
million
could
have
buy
a
lot
of
new
infrastructure
.
I
think
in
particular
of
the
A5
road
from
Derry
to
Dublin
,
in
respect
of
which
the
Irish
government
have
already
commit
money
.
if
we
be
to
move
forward
to
a
good
executive
,
which
be
something
I
be
hopeful
will
transpire
,
we
must
have
great
tyre
-
kick
on
the
way
money
be
expend
,
particularly
from
a
fiscal
point
of
view
.
there
be
a
piece
within
the
Stormont
House
agreement
and
the
Fresh
start
programme
on
the
creation
of
a
fiscal
council
.
I
be
not
sure
what
progress
have
be
make
on
a
council
,
but
if
it
be
establish
,
all
party
in
a
new
executive
could
buy
into
it
in
relation
to
budgetary
oversight
.
it
would
help
to
ensure
that
whatever
political
silo
operate
from
a
ministerial
point
of
view
and
which
party
be
run
what
,
matter
be
not
leave
to
special
adviser
and
minister
.
as
such
,
the
civil
service
framework
would
ensure
that
there
be
proper
tyre
-
kick
and
we
would
not
have
this
scandal
emerge
such
that
that
who
live
within
the
six
County
might
not
take
the
present
cynical
view
,
as
I
perceive
it
from
my
conversation
on
the
ground
,
of
how
the
executive
operate
at
time
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
make
the
provision
in
Irish
law
to
enable
the
State
to
ratify
the
1954
Hague
Convention
on
the
protection
of
cultural
property
in
the
event
of
a
armed
conflict
,
and
the
1999
protocol
to
the
convention
.
we
support
and
welcome
this
Bill
as
other
have
do
.
specifically
,
the
Bill
will
prohibit
the
destruction
,
damage
and
theft
of
cultural
property
in
specify
circumstance
during
the
course
of
a
armed
conflict
,
in
accordance
with
the
1999
protocol
,
and
will
provide
for
the
appropriate
penalty
upon
conviction
and
related
matter
.
the
1954
Hague
Convention
require
the
contracting
party
to
safeguard
and
respect
cultural
property
in
the
event
of
armed
conflict
.
the
1999
protocol
provide
for
a
high
level
of
enhance
protection
for
cultural
property
which
be
of
the
great
importance
to
humanity
and
have
exceptional
cultural
and
historical
value
.
the
1999
protocol
require
the
contracting
party
to
provide
penalty
in
domestic
law
,
which
be
what
we
be
do
through
this
Bill
,
for
person
who
intentionally
commit
serious
violation
of
the
convention
and
the
protocol
.
the
convention
require
contracting
party
further
to
safeguard
and
respect
cultural
property
.
party
to
the
convention
must
,
in
the
time
of
peace
,
take
such
measure
as
be
consider
appropriate
to
safeguard
cultural
property
within
they
territory
.
I
understand
that
the
Bill
also
confer
legal
protection
on
the
blue
shield
emblem
and
empower
the
Minister
for
Art
,
Heritage
,
Regional
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
to
authorise
its
use
in
this
State
,
which
I
welcome
.
we
welcome
that
property
of
important
cultural
heritage
will
be
protect
at
time
of
war
.
while
the
horror
of
war
be
first
and
foremost
about
human
suffering
,
we
know
how
destructive
it
can
be
in
term
of
cultural
property
,
most
of
which
can
never
be
replace
.
we
know
from
we
own
history
how
war
have
damage
we
cultural
heritage
,
sometimes
with
the
aim
of
destroy
we
identity
.
that
have
happen
throughout
the
world
.
in
recent
time
in
particular
,
some
of
that
party
at
war
have
specifically
target
the
cultural
heritage
of
a
area
,
country
or
people
to
try
to
obliterate
they
identity
.
I
be
aware
that
126
state
be
party
to
the
1954
Hague
Convention
,
and
that
just
four
state
,
namely
,
Andorra
,
Britain
,
Ireland
and
the
Philippines
,
have
sign
the
treaty
but
have
yet
to
ratify
it
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
we
be
give
effect
to
that
ratification
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
my
colleague
,
former
minister
Carál
Ní
Chuilín
,
MLA
,
in
this
regard
.
when
she
serve
as
Minister
of
Culture
,
Art
and
Leisure
in
the
six
County
,
she
support
the
passage
of
similar
legislation
through
the
Assembly
in
Stormont
.
as
regards
the
technical
aspect
of
the
Bill
,
I
broadly
welcome
the
definition
of
"
cultural
property
"
set
out
in
section
1
.
while
I
accept
that
the
Bill
involve
give
effect
to
the
term
of
the
Hague
convention
,
I
must
mention
the
appalling
treatment
of
we
cultural
heritage
at
different
stage
of
we
history
and
,
in
some
regards
,
by
the
current
government
,
specifically
in
respect
of
the
likes
of
Moore
Street
,
although
there
be
a
announcement
today
of
some
possible
progress
on
that
issue
.
it
be
not
fiction
.
no
.
the
Deputy
might
have
a
opportunity
to
move
they
amendment
on
Thursday
.
if
amendment
no.
2
be
carry
,
the
other
amendment
will
fall
.
if
amendment
no.
2
be
not
carry
,
amendment
Nosemcue
1
and
3
may
be
move
.
I
move
:
"
that
the
Bill
be
now
read
a
second
Time
.
"
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
prohibit
the
use
of
micro-plastic
,
particularly
for
particle
that
be
less
than
5
mm
in
diameter
.
micro-plastic
be
use
in
a

a

however
,

,
look
at
what

it
conclude
that
introduce
a

on

would
be
more
complicated
than
the

the

the

be

I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Green
Party
in
first
raise
this
matter
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
and
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
,
who
have
lead
the
way
on
this
issue
.
I
note
that
the
minister
respond
to
Senator
O'Sullivan
in
the
Seanad
while
not
accept
she
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
government
have
say
it
will
put
forward
its
own
legislative
proposal
in
this
regard
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
when
he
say
the
government
be
commit
to
legislate
on
this
issue
.
the
minister
say
in
he
speech
to
the
Seanad
:
I
see
advantage
in
Ireland
lead
by
example
on
microbead
.
with
this
in
mind
,
the
government
will
develop
proposal
to
ban
microbead
nationally
in
the
context
of
a
wide
marine
environmental
Bill
to
be
publish
[
this
]
year
[
that
be
,
2017
]
,
which
will
also
provide
the
legislative
basis
for
a
network
of
marine
protect
area
[
and
so
on
]
.
I
suppose
the
minister
will
provide
some
rebuttal
to
the
Labour
Party
Bill
.
the
Labour
Party
Bill
seek
to
build
on
the
aim
of
the
Green
Party
Bill
.
we
do
not
seek
to
be
partisan
in
any
way
.
we
believe
this
be
a
issue
that
affect
we
all
and
we
hope
there
be
a
non-partisan
solution
.
I
be
hopeful
today
that
we
will
move
to
a
position
whereby
we
Bill
,
at
least
,
be
accept
and
will
stay
on
the
Order
Paper
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
accept
we
Bill
.
I
doubt
that
will
be
the
case
but
I
hope
we
will
be
able
to
leave
it
on
the
Order
Paper
at
least
until
such
time
as
the
government
come
up
with
a
set
of
proposal
.
the
minister
will
tell
we
there
be
a
issue
of
EU
law
at
play
here
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
single
Market
.
the
minister
will
tell
we
that
Article
34
and
35
of
the
Treaty
have
a
bear
on
whether
or
not
this
legislative
proposal
can
bear
fruit
.
we
have
carefully
consider
the
question
on
EU
law
and
whether
or
not
that
would
prevent
member
state
from
take
action
on
the
issue
.
article
34
and
35
of
the
Treaty
on
the
Functioning
of
the
European
Union
set
out
the
principle
that
,
as
the
single
Market
be
a
area
without
internal
border
,
restriction
on
the
movement
of
goods
be
not
allow
and
that
the
free
movement
of
goods
should
be
guarantee
.
we
accept
this
.
undoubtedly
,
a
Irish
ban
on
the
sale
of
product
contain
microbead
would
have
the
effect
of
restrict
certain
import
.
however
,
article
36
of
the
treaty
go
on
to
state
that
article
34
and
35
do
not
preclude
prohibition
or
restriction
on
import
that
be
justify
on
grounds
of
the
protection
of
health
and
life
of
human
,
animal
or
plant
.
in
other
word
,
the
EU
treaty
directly
acknowledge
that
national
measure
can
be
take
to
protect
the
environment
.
microbead
,
as
we
know
,
enter
the
environment
,
be
not
catch
in
water
treatment
system
and
instead
be
release
into
river
and
the
sea
with
wastewater
outflow
.
micro-plastic
be
a
entirely
unnecessary
source
of
pollution
and
be
likely
to
have
environmental
impact
.
Study
have
show
they
be
ingest
by
marine
animal
,
lead
to
physical
harm
and
toxic
effect
,
and
there
be
evidence
to
suggest
they
be
enter
the
human
food
chain
.
in
December
2014
,
the
Netherlands
,
Austria
,
Luxembourg
,
Belgium
and
Sweden
issue
a
joint
statement
call
for
a
EU
ban
on
micro-plastic
in
cosmetic
and
detergent
to
EU
minister
with
responsibility
for
environmental
matter
.
in
January
2016
-
I
have
already
refer
to
this
research
report
-
they
examine
what
EU
mechanism
be
available
to
reduce
microbead
pollutant
from
cosmetic
.
in
light
of
the
hesitancy
at
EU
level
,
we
believe
domestic
action
-
that
be
,
action
within
we
own
parliament
-
be
both
necessary
and
appropriate
.
it
be
true
that
we
propose
legislation
amount
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
to
a
trade
barrier
,
but
there
be
a
well
-
establish
procedure
for
deal
with
this
.
the
EU
transparency
directive
set
up
a
procedure
oblige
the
member
state
to
notify
the
commission
of
all
draft
regulation
on
product
before
they
be
adopt
into
national
law
.
the
notification
trigger
a
standstill
period
of
three
month
.
the
commission
and
other
member
state
can
use
this
time
to
examine
the
notify
draft
regulation
to
determine
whether
it
comply
with
the
EU
treaty
and
the
principle
of
free
movement
of
goods
and
service
.
if
there
be
no
reaction
,
the
draft
can
be
adopt
after
the
three
-
month
standstill
period
have
expire
.
this
be
exactly
the
procedure
that
the
then
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
have
to
follow
when
he
introduce
the
ban
on
smoking
in
the
workplace
.
there
be
a
standstill
period
for
the
new
rule
and
then
they
come
into
full
force
and
effect
.
the
European
Commission
can
block
the
proposal
if
the
draft
legislation
concern
a
matter
on
which
the
EU
itself
propose
to
act
,
but
this
be
clearly
not
the
case
at
this
time
regard
micro-plastic
.
we
therefore
firmly
believe
that
the
option
of
unilateral
action
by
Ireland
on
this
issue
be
a
valid
one
under
the
European
Union
treaty
.
it
be
timely
that
we
would
legislate
for
this
very
important
public
health
and
environmental
issue
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
accept
the
legislative
proposal
before
the
House
.
I
anticipate
that
he
will
tell
we
there
will
be
a
government
legislative
proposal
on
this
very
issue
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
.
I
be
conscious
that
we
have
a
opportunity
here
to
collaborate
now
on
a
non-partisan
issue
,
a
issue
of
what
I
would
call
grave
concern
regard
public
health
.
as
I
say
,
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
accept
we
bona
fide
on
this
and
that
we
can
get
cross-party
support
on
the
issue
and
I
look
forward
to
hear
from
the
minister
on
this
matter
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
minister
propose
to
bring
forward
he
own
legislative
proposal
,
I
be
hopeful
that
will
not
be
tack
onto
or
attach
to
another
piece
of
legislation
.
I
be
hopeful
it
would
be
a
bespoke
,
stand
-
alone
legislation
because
I
believe
Ireland
should
take
leadership
on
this
issue
.
it
be
something
that
affect
we
all
.
again
,
I
note
that
the
minister
have
state
he
be
intent
on
legislate
for
this
issue
.
I
will
quote
again
from
the
minister
's
speech
to
the
Seanad
:
there
be
approximately
6.2
trillion
particle
of
litter
in
we
ocean
.
that
be
1000
particle
for
every
person
on
the
planet
.
the
Bill
be
therefore
tie
in
and
ally
to
many
other
issue
related
to
the
marine
environment
.
I
stand
before
the
House
as
a
former
minister
of
State
for
research
and
innovation
and
someone
who
be
commit
during
the
lifetime
of
the
previous
government
,
along
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
,
and
the
then
minister
,
deputy
Howlin
,
to
ensure
taxpayer
's
money
be
use
in
a
way
that
recognise
the
value
of
we
maritime
environment
and
the
potential
of
that
environment
to
deliver
marine
renewable
energy
.
we
want
to
see
clean
ocean
and
clean
sea
and
,
as
a
island
nation
,
we
need
to
take
a
global
leadership
position
on
this
.
would
it
be
possible
to
have
a
copy
of
the
minister
's
speech
circulate
?
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
I
thank
colleague
who
have
welcome
the
principle
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
very
clear
there
be
a
intention
on
the
part
of
the
House
,
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
,
to
legislate
for
the
issue
and
to
ensure
that
we
can
put
in
place
a
robust
mechanism
that
will
offset
the
dire
economic
cost
of
the
presence
of
microbead
and
micro-plastic
in
we
environment
.
I
thank
member
for
they
support
in
the
first
instance
when
the
legislation
be
introduce
.
the
Green
Party
Deputy
be
the
originator
of
the
Bill
and
I
acknowledge
they
role
.
we
hope
to
bring
this
legislation
a
step
further
in
seek
to
deal
with
the
legal
issue
pertain
to
the
European
Union
and
the
specific
treaty
provision
.
I
reiterate
that
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
and
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
on
the
government
's
intention
to
legislate
on
this
issue
.
since
proposal
will
come
before
the
government
in
June
,
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
I
would
hope
that
we
could
be
in
some
space
to
have
this
before
we
again
by
autumn
of
this
year
.
be
I
correct
in
understanding
that
there
may
be
a
proposal
to
bring
it
before
the
government
in
June
?
the
official
be
not
say
that
.
the
foreshore
Bill
will
be
bring
before
government
in
June
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
this
matter
could
be
attach
to
it
.
that
be
the
intention
.
I
raise
the
issue
of
have
a
bespoke
Bill
.
the
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
also
seek
to
have
one
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
could
deal
with
this
in
a
bespoke
fashion
.
that
would
be
the
good
way
.
indeed
.
I
want
absolute
clarity
about
this
.
if
the
foreshore
Bill
be
to
come
before
we
,
which
I
imagine
will
be
robust
and
detailed
legislation
,
I
be
fearful
that
legislation
deal
with
micro-plastic
or
microbead
could
get
lose
in
the
large
piece
.
that
be
fair
enough
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
about
the
June
deadline
.
in
any
event
,
I
be
hopeful
that
by
autumn
2017
when
we
come
back
from
the
summer
recess
we
will
at
least
be
in
a
position
to
have
a
Bill
or
the
head
of
a
Bill
before
we
.
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
at
he
word
when
he
say
there
will
be
a
consultation
period
with
all
interested
party
in
the
House
,
as
per
the
acting
Chairman
's
suggestion
,
so
that
we
can
proceed
in
a
non-partisan
way
to
give
effect
to
a
good
and
robust
piece
of
legislation
.
I
be
open
to
any
mechanism
that
can
be
use
to
-----
I
will
conclude
by
say
that
there
be
3000
submission
.
there
be
a
huge
demand
outside
of
this
house
for
this
issue
to
be
deal
with
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
Minister
of
State
for
they
openness
.
I
be
appreciative
of
the
fact
that
they
be
not
oppose
the
Bill
in
typical
partisan
fashion
.
we
Bill
will
remain
on
the
agenda
.
I
will
be
happy
to
take
it
off
the
agenda
as
soon
as
we
see
a
set
of
proposal
come
from
the
government
side
.
Fianna
Fáil
have
also
say
it
intend
to
bring
forward
a
set
of
proposal
.
we
will
keep
a
open
mind
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill

the
select
committee
on

there
be
no
attempt
by
the
Labour
Party
to
prevent
the
normalisation
of
the
banking
sector
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
allege
.
there
be
certainly
no
attempt
to
conflate
two
separate
and
discrete
policy
area
,
namely
,
banking
policy
and
capital
investment
constraint

the

it
be
at

this
be
the
third
successive

decline
from

the

we
may
even
reach

ratio

60

from
a
macroeconomic
point
of
view
,
the
minister
seek
to
sell
25
%
of
a
asset
ultimately
to
achieve
a
debt
to

of
45
%
by
the
mid-2020
when
the
current
target
under
the
stability
and

pact
be
60

what
be
flawed
be
the
idea
of
accelerate
unnecessarily
the
repayment
of
debt
when
the
country

cry
out

proceed

the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
Keynes
.
Keynes
would
have
something
to
say
about
the
establishment
of
a
rainy
day
fund
.
he
might
say
that
,
instead
of
have
just
€
2.5
billion
to
invest
in
school
,
transport
and
home
,
the
government
would
have
more
than
€
8.5
billion
in
the
come
year
without
any
negative
risk
to
we
economy
.
there
be
infrastructural
bottleneck

do
not
have
a
proper

link
Cork
to

we
call
it

anything

in

I
reach

copy

that
I

in

I
no

there
be
space
before

negotiate
for

there
be
no

between

by

the

be
the
time
for

leader
,
include
this
Taoiseach
and
the
incoming
one
,
whoever
that
may
be
,
to
make
the
political
case
for
a
relaxation
of
the
rule
so
as
to
ensure
that
whatever
dividend
be
ultimately
yield
be
use
for
productive
purpose
and
investment
in
infrastructure
.
even
if
we
accept
the
premise
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
argument
and
ceteris
paribus
,
or
all
thing
be
equal
,
he
have
still
not
make
a
compelling
argument
for
the
sale
from
a
macroeconomic
point
of
view
except
that
,
if
I
understand
he
correctly
,
the
State
should
not
be
vested
in
the
banking
system
and
it
should
be
a
function
purely
of
the
market
.
however
,
the
State
have
always
be
a
major
investor
-
in
fact
,
the
large
investor
-
in
job
creation
,
be
that
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
the
IDA
or
direct
subvention
of
the
very
business
that
depend
on
the
banking
sector
to
thrive
.
the
motion
before
the
House
be
to
ensure
that
we
can
relax
the
rule
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
and
use
dividend
from
the
banking
sector
productively
by
reinvest
in

economy
and
society
.
the
select
Committee
on
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
have
complete
its
consideration
of
the
Prohibition
of
the
Exploration
and
Extraction
of
Onshore
Petroleum
Bill
2016
and
have
make
amendment
thereto
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
we
will
be
support
it
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
to
be
genuine
in
he
attempt
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
if
we
have
one
criticism
,
it
would
be
that
some
of
the
deadline
should
be
soon
rather
than
in
quarter
three
and
four
of
this
year
.
I
wish
to
speak
briefly
to
some
of
the
issue
inherent
in
the
update
of

,
as
present
by
the
Minister

State
.
recommendation
no.

relate
to
ensure
great
consistency
of
treatment
for
return
immigrant
.
when
the
Minister
of
State
be
respond
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
he
could
let
we
know
whether
there
be
scope
within
the
recommendation
to
ensure
such
a
protocol
be
achieve
,
perhaps
by
the
end
of
quarter
two
or
three
,
because
it
be
such
a
vital
issue
.
I
do
not
need
to
rehearse
in
the
House
the
issue
that
affect
return
immigrant
but
if
the
protocol
could
be
design
in
a
way
to
ensure
it
may
be
implement
with
great
haste
,
it
would
provide
a
lot
of
confidence
for
people
who
be

from
abroad

no.

,
on
the
subjection
of
the
decline
case
agreement
to
ongoing
review
to
ensure
transparency
,
we
welcome
the
progress
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
exact
position
at
present
.
bear
in
mind
the
review
,
the
Minister
of
State
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
on
Insurance
Ireland
's
updating
of
its
website
.
my
understanding
from
the
report
of
3
May
be
that
Insurance
Ireland
have
actually
update
the
website
.
again
,
I
want
clarification
on
that
.
on
recommendation
no.
8
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
report
,
date
3
May
,
there
be
to
be
a
protocol
for
policyholder
to
be
notify
of
claim
make
against
they
before
settlement
date
.
I
seek
a
real
-
time
clarification
from
the
minister
of
State
on
that
.
that
be
a
matter
of
some
discussion
today
in
the
media
.
the
Minister
of
State
and
deputy
Michael
McGrath
refer
specifically
to
it
.
I
be
listen
to
the
discussion
in
passing
.
what
be
the
position
on
that
?
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
such
a
recommendation
should
be
much
strong
and
that
defendant
should
be
give
a
opportunity
to
mount
a
defence
instead
of
a
insurer
decide
that
it
be
uneconomic
to
defend
and
go
to
a
default
payment
mechanism
.
I
acknowledge
deputy
Michael
McGrath
on
that
point
because
he
raise
it
on
the
Sean
O'Rourke
show
early
today
.
we
all
want
to
ensure
the
cost
of
motoring
will
be
reduce
for
every
motorist
,
regardless
of
he
or
she
demographic
and
the
age
of
the
vehicle
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
that
report
on
this
issue
and
one
of
the
major
issue
be
related
to
old
vehicle
.
if
a
old
vehicle
pass
the
nct
,
the
owner
should
not
be
discriminate
against
because
of
its
age
.
that
do
not
make
a
ounce
of
sense
as
the
NCT
be
subject
to
the
law
of
the
land
.
I
have
serious
difficulty
with
the
issue
of
transparency
because
we
be
tell
all
along
that
the
reason
for
the
stark
increase
in
the
cost
of
premia
be
the
provisioning
that
be
necessary
on
the
part
of
insurance
company
to
cover
loss
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
report
about
this
,
but
I
have
a
great
difficulty
with
the
amount
provide
for
.
person
will
accept
a
increase
in
they
premia
,
but
they
cannot
sustain
the
increase
they
have
have
to
sustain
in
the
past
12
month
.
the
insurance
industry
be
tell
we
a
corrective
mechanism
be
in
place
whereby
premia
have
be
reduce
by
40
%
in
some
instance
.
a
component
have
to
be
pure
and
utter
profit
.
there
be
no
transparency
on
that
profit
making
.
another
issue
I
have
be
that
Insurance
Ireland
seem
to
speak
for
the
industry
at
the
committee
hearing
.
it
be
not
about
personality
,
but
I
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
one
person
with
one
voice
seem
to
represent
the
entire
industry
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
outline
whether
the
working
group
have
hear
from
voice
other
than
Insurance
Ireland
?
in
other
word
,
have
the
chief
executive
officer
of
insurance
company
deal
directly
with
he
?
what
have
be
the
nature
of
the
engagement
between
they
?
Consumer
would
not
necessarily
recognise
insurance
Ireland
as
the
sole
voice
of
the
sector
.
it
would
be
useful
for
we
to
have
some
insight
from
the
Minister
of
State
into
what
he
engagement
be
with
they
.
it
would
be
even
good
if
he
name
the
individual
company
.
I
doubt
that
he
will
,
but
I
make
the
request
respectfully
.
we
support
the
motion
.
I
recognise
the
work
the
minister
of
State
be
do
,
but
I
would
like
he
to
ensure
the
goal
to
be
attain
within
certain
quarter
be
fast
-
track
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
return
emigrant
.
perhaps
he
might
have
something
to
say
about
that
.
it
would
be
useful
and
send
a
signal
.
I
would
also
like
he
to
comment
on
the
issue
affect
old
driver
,
driver
of
old
vehicle
and
public
service
vehicle
and
the
distinction
between
taxi
and
so
on
and
sme
that
have
fleet
but
which
find
they
insurance
cost
have
go
through
the
roof
.
he
should
ensure
a
level
playing
field
in
respect
of
transparency
on
the
difference
between
the
provisioning
and
the
corrective
measure
he
have
say
be
be
introduce
and
the
profit
generate
.
person
want
to
feel
that
they
be
not
be
screw
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
word
"
screw
"
be
unparliamentary
language
,
but
I
be
speak
in
the
vernacular
.
it
be
unfair
that
consumer
find
themselves
in
this
position
at
this
time
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
will
receive
a
letter
if
the
word
be
deem
to
be
unparliamentary
.
I
read
the
list
of
prohibit
word
lately
and
the
term
"
corner
-
boy
"
be
proscribe
.
perhaps
that
be
now
anachronistic
,
but
it
be
appropriate
at
a
certain
time
.
we
do
not
want
the
insurance
industry
to
act
like
a
corner
-
boy
in
this
regard
.
we
be
prepared
to
withdraw
the
amendment
on
the
basis
that
we
all
agree
that
this
be
need
in
term
of
have
some
oversight
of
transport
and
land
use
planning
.

on
behalf
of
the
Irish
Labour
Party
,
I
wish
to
express
we
deep
sympathy
to
that
affect
by
the
Manchester
attack
,
which
be
appalling
.
it
be
probably
no
accident
that
the
attack
plan
for
maximum
carnage
,
target
young
woman
and
girl
mostly
and
occur
in
the
midst
of
a
general
election
.
it
be
a
attack
on
we
democratic
value
and
,
in
particular
,
on
the
innocence
of
youth
.
I
wish
to
echo
the
word
of
the
Manchester
Mayor
,
Andy
Burnham
,
who
say
today
:
this
be
child
,
young
people
and
they
family
that
that
responsible
choose
to
terrorise
and
kill
.
this
be
a
evil
act
.
I
offer
we
deep
sympathy
to
the
victim
,
they
family
and
the
people
of
Manchester
.
Ireland
have
always
have
strong
link
with
Manchester
.
today
,
more
than
ever
,
we
stand
alongside
the
community
there
as
they
mourn
the
needless
loss
of
so
many
young
life
.
it
be
in
this
spirit
that
the
lord
Mayor
of
Dublin
,
Brendan
Carr
,
have
open
a
book
of
condolence
,
as
have
he
counterpart
in
many
municipal
authority
throughout
the
country
.
I
wish
to
pay
tribute
to
the
emergency
worker
and
all
the
local
people
in
Manchester
who
have
be
do
all
they
can
to
help
in
the
aftermath
of
this
atrocity
.
the
strength
and
spirit
show
by
the
community
there
be
the
good
response
to
despicable
act
of
terror
.
it
be
great
to
see
collegiality
at
work
.
the
deputy
should
speak
to
a
representative
of
the
Business
Committee
.
this
be
childish
.
that
be
not
exactly
what
happen
.
I
welcome
the
contribution
of
all
the
Deputy
who
contribute
but
I
be
very
disappointed
not
more
group
take
time
to
speak
on
this
important
issue
.
not
only
in
the
context
of
my
motion
but
in
health
debate
in
general
,
there
have
always
be
a
strong
element
of
robust
debate
and
analysis
in
this
chamber
.
however
,
it
be
quite
incredible
that
we
could
not
fill
the
full
allocation
of
two
hour
this
evening
.
the
motion
be
tab
because
we
must
consistently
highlight
the
deficiency
and
inadequacy
in
we
health
service
.
deputy
Eamon
Scanlon
,
for
example
,
highlight
a
genuine
,
real
case
,
one
of
the
660000
people
out
there
on
waiting
list
.
the
motion
be
tab
with
that
purpose
in
mind
and
also
to
come
up
with
some
observation
and
solution
in
the
area
of
health
care
.
we
need
to
increase
the
time
during
which
diagnostic
test
be
available
across
hospital
.
we
must
move
to
a
system
of
provision
from
8
a.m.
to
8
p.m.
,
seven
day
a
week
.
we
need
to
ensure
the
ward
that
be
close
be
open
up
.
we
talk
about
a
lack
of
bed
and
bed
capacity
review
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
ward
close
simply
because
we
cannot
retain
or
recruit
enough
nursing
staff
to
populate
they
.
even
within
the
current
crisis
,
there
be
solution
that
may
resolve
some
of
the
problem
to
which
the
Deputy
refer
in
the
context
of
individual
wait
inordinate
period
for
diagnostics
,
operation
or
procedure
.
it
be
within
the
government
's
gift
to
do
this
thing
;
it
just
need
a
little
honest
commitment
,
a
bit
of
backbone
and
a
government
willing
to
consider
the
challenge
out
there
and
try
to
resolve
they
step
by
step
.
we
have
listen
to
lecture
from
that
who
oppose
the
National

purchase
Fund
.
I
have
no
ideological
view
as
to
whether
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
right

.
my
only
view
be
that
it
do
benefit
that
who
be
wait

period
on
the
public
waiting

.
it
drive
down
waiting
list
over

protracted
period
and
it
be
a
positive
initiative
.
that
who
support
Maduro
and
Stalinist
party
can
have
they
view
but
I
simply
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
while
we
public
hospital
system
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deal
with
what
be
present
to
it
daily
,
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
a
solution
in
the
short
and
medium
term
while
we
wrap
up
capacity
in
we
public
health
system
.
in
the
motion
,
we
highlight
the
deficiency
and
come
up
with
sensible
suggestion
which
,
I
believe
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
she
colleague
can
,
with
a
small
bit
of
imagination
and
grit
,
resolve
.
I
ask

to

for

,
the

I
join
in
wish
the
Taoiseach
and
the
new
cabinet
well
in
they
endeavour
.
I
particularly
wish
the
new
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
well
in
he
new
role
.
I
acknowledge
he
commitment
to
and
role
in
the
negotiation
in
Northern
Ireland
.
he
have
make
a
impact
and
the
party
in
Northern
Ireland
will
miss
he
solid
engagement
there
.
there
be
a
so
-
call
public
sector
pay
agreement
that
have
yet
to
be
ballote
upon
but
there
be
nothing
in
the
Taoiseach
's
speech
tonight
to
give
comfort
to
that
public
sector
worker
and
trade
union
about
who
now
have
political
responsibility
for
continue
the
work
.
I
wish
the
new
Minister
for
Finance
and
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
well
in
he
endeavour
.
if
he
be
to
continue
to
lead
in
this
it
will
be
a
onerous
task
in
addition
to
responsibility
for
finance
,
public
expenditure
and
reform
.
I
worry
that
the
government
will
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
that
important
talk
with
the
public
sector
union
.
in
respect
of
Innovation
2020
,
I
have
notice
in
the
past
year
that
the
foot
have
be
take
off
the
pedal
of
Ireland
's
research
,
development
and
innovation
agenda
.
the
innovation
agenda
be
a
key
pillar
of
the
last
government
and
continue
to
be
,
under
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
when
in
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Innovation
and
Enterprise
and
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
until
he
become
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
.
it
have
now
slip
off
the
agenda
.
Ireland
be
now
far
below
average
in
its
spending
on
research
and
development
and
the
number
of
phd
in
real
term
be
decrease
.
if
we
be
talk
about
become
a
innovative
island
on
the
western
periphery
of
Europe
,
Brexit
have
permutation
too
in
respect
of
we
ability
to
attract
world
class
researcher
to
we
shore
.
the
government
need
to
give
priority
to
that
and
we
must
ensure
that
we
spending
on
research
,
development
and
innovation
do
not
become
a
low
priority
.
it
need
to
be
give
great
weight
by
government
.
while
I
congratulate
the
new
minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Coveney
,
I
fear
that
we
be
go
to
lose
he
because
the
foreign
affair
agenda
will
perhaps
take
he
away
from
the
Cork
agenda
and
the
Munster
agenda
and
the
regional
economic
development
-----
-----
of
Cork
,
Limerick
,
Galway
and
Donegal
,
the
western
seaboard
of
this
island
,
and
the
investment
in
the
Cork
-
Limerick
bypass
.
Kerry
as
well
.
we
should
not
forget
Kerry
.
it
be
important
to
speak
to
the
action
plan
for
job
which
have
specific
target
in
respect
of
job
creation
beyond
the
pale
and
that
include
that
county
I
have
just
refer
to
.
that
need
proper
infrastructure
.
this
be
a
cabinet
and
a
Taoiseach
that
will
be
work
night
and
day
,
conscious
of
what
need
to
be
do
and
what
we
need
to
achieve
but
also
conscious
of
the
journey
that
we
country
have
make

I
be
hope
for
some
positive
message
on
the
regulation
of
the
sector
in
the
minister
's
speech
and
I
have
to
say
in
all
sincerity
that
I
be
not
see
anything
that
be
worthwhile
.
the
minister
state
that
he
be
acknowledge
the
concern
of
some
household
and
in
that
regard
he
will
introduce
a
pricing
watchdog
monitoring
unit
.
I
have
never
hear
of
a
"
pricing
watchdog
monitoring
unit
"
that
will
have
tooth
.
this
be
without
tooth
.
it
be
,
in
all
honesty
,
a
attempt
to
placate
the
Member
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
House
in
order
to
ensure
that
this
new
regime
will
get
as
smooth
a
political
passage
as
possible
.
the
monthly
report
on
pricing
development
involve
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
to
report
on
the
household
waste
collection
market
be
wholly
inadequate
.
in
fairness
,
the
minister
have
be
in
situ
for
a
year
.
this
be
announce
well
over
a
year
ago
.
what
be
the
minister
do
for
the
last
year
on
objectively
examine
how
the
market
for
waste
operate
in
Ireland
?
the
idea
that
the
minister
will
set
up
or
establish
a
regulator
on
the
basis
of
a
evidence
base
or
information
that
be
go
to
come
in
do
not
stand
up
.
we
be
now
into
July
2017
.
this
be
a
attempt
to
kick
the
can
further
down
the
line
.
I
be
make
the
argument
,
notwithstand
the
minister
's
rejection
of
we
proposal
,
to
give
more
power
to
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
to
set
up
a
pricing
division
in
the
agency
as
such
measure
would
ensure
the
State
have
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
market
.
there
would
be
no
major
cost
impediment
to
do
that
.
the
minister
would
have
goodwill
towards
the
idea
if
the
EPA
be
already
regulate
the
market
,
that
be
,
if
legislation
be
in
place
to
back
that
up
and
if
the
EPA
be
already
research
and
analyse
the
market
.
the
very
act
of
set
up
some
sort
of
watchdog
or
monitoring
unit
be
pointless
.
there
be
a
opportunity
in
the
past
year
to
set
up
something
that
have
real
tooth
and
that
could
have
really
look
at
the
market
.
I
do
not
accept
that
it
be
adequate
for
the
minister
to
say
we
be
provide
choice
in
the
market
in
respect
of
the
pricing
mechanism
,
that
be
,
the
per
kilo
charge
,
the
lift
and
per
kilo
charge
,
the
weight
band
charge
or
the
weight
allowance
plus
per
kilo
surcharge
for
excess
weight
.
all
this
different
product
be
already
in
existence
in
the
market
.
if
we
be
make
the
argument
on
the
basis
of
increase
competition
,
then
we
have
to
analyse
properly
the
exact
nature
of
the
market
at
the
moment
.
it
be
not
a
perfectly
competitive
market
in
spite
of
the
minister
's
contention
.
in
fact
,
the
minister
have
potentially
create
a
vacuum
within
a
short
space
of
time
whereby
the
waste
management
company
can
come
together
,
act
like
a
cartel
and
start
fix
price
in
a
manner
that
they
so
choose
,
thereby
adversely
affect
consumer
,
in
the
absence
of
any
proper
regulatory
regime
.
person
want
honesty
in
the
debate
.
if
one
consider
the
polluter
pay
principle
,
one
cannot
have
a
situation
whereby
that
who
recycle
every
week
to
the
tune
of
30
%
,
40
%
,
50
%
or
high
of
they
waste
be
subsidise
that
who
do
not
.
we
need
proper
analysis
of
how
the
market
actually
work
before
we
introduce
any
move
away
from
the
flat
charge
structure
.
there
be
still
a
lack
of
information
and
of
consumer
information
in
particular
with
regard
to
what
product
be
available
.
most
people
be
price
taker
because
depend
on
geography
,
they
have
no
choice
but
to
be
price
taker
.
if
they
live
in
large
conurbation
,
they
may
have
competition
.
however
,
if
a
person
live
in
rural
west
Cork
and
there
be
only
one
operator
there
,
that
person
be
subject
to
the
pricing
mechanism
.
let
we
not
call
that
competition
,
because
it
be
not
.
we
believe
there
could
be
a
role
for
the
local
authority
in
future
.
in
the
past
,
local
authority
guarantee
universal
service
but
that
universal
service
be
no
long
in
existence
.
as
some
people
do
not
have
access
to
waste
collection
,
there
be
apartheid
in
that
sense
.
the
new
structure
the
minister
propose
to
introduce
will
encourage
more
people
to
dispose
of
they
waste
illegally
.
it
be
not
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
come
back
to
the
House
after
a
year
with
this
temporary
quick
-
fix
solution
.
there
should
have
be
proper
analysis
during
the
past
year
.
we
will
stand
with
we
hand
up
if
the
minister
want
to
critique
we
position
-
that
be
fair
enough
.
however
,
in
politics
one
be
also
allow
to
evolve
and
advance
one
's
position
and
the
minister
have
be
in
situ
for
over
a
year
.
we
have
to
look
at
the
green
school
programme
.
we
all
agree
with
the
Repak
recycle
and
change
for
the
good
educational
programme
.
all
such
programme
be
have
a
positive
effect
on
behaviour
.
however
,
it
be
no
good
teaching
a
child
of
seven
,
eight
or
ten
year
of
age
about
the
need
to
recycle
if
the
family
of
the
child
do
not
have
the
bin
at
home
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
that
be
the
current
position
in
large
swathe
of
the
country
.
there
should
be
a
postponement
in
this
regard
.
there
be
a
role
for
the
EPA
and
we
need
to
look
at
Repak
because
while
there
may
be
a
industry
view
on
what
Repak
do
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
consumer
-
face
view
on
what
Repak
do
.
we
be
reach
dangerous
level
of
plastic
production
globally
.
the
amount
of
plastic
go
into
refuse
and
not
be
recycle
be
dangerous
at
this
stage
and
be
result
in
major
environmental
cost
.
there
be
no
need
to
rehash
the
evidence
on
what
be
happen
in
the
environment
vis
-à
-
vo
the
production
of
plastic
.
we
need
a
overview
and
proper
analysis
of
what
exactly
be
go
on
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
a
watchdog
monitoring
unit
be
not
a
sufficient
response
.
we
have
be
in
government
.
I
understand
that
the
government
have
to
respond
politically
and
try
to
get
the
motion
over
the
line
and
so
on
.
there
be
a
confidence
and
supply
arrangement
and
one
should
be
realistic
about
that
.
however
,
this
should
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
consumer
,
who
be
not
fool
.
as
for
part
of
the
minister
's
speech
,
for
he
to
stand
up
in
the
Dáil
and
state
no
one
leave
light
or
the
immersion
on
any
more
when
there
be
a
incentive
to
turn
they
off
be
schoolboy
stuff
.
it
be
unbecoming
of
the
minister
to
come
in
and
make
statement
like
that
.
the
people
be
educate
and
be
not
to
be
treat
like
fool
.
the
people
want
a
market
and
want
to
be
able
to
recycle
.
they
want
access
to
proper
service
.
however
,
the
regime
the
minister
be
propose
be
not
go
to
provide
this
because
it
be
not
a
perfectly
competitive
market
.
it
be
actually
go
to
be
more
of
the
same
.
the
people
who
have
the
flat
charge
at
the
moment
be
concerned
about
how
much
they
charge
be
go
to
increase
as
a
result
of
this
.
they
need
certainty
.
person
need
certainty
in
they
household
budget
.
the
minister
's
willingness
to
compromise
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
proposal
to
establish
a
regulator
be
welcome
and
,
as
such
,
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
however
,
there
obviously
be
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
regulator
must
be
establish
.
I
hope
that
in
tandem
with
he
work
with
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
which
will
provide
the
monthly
report
,
the
minister
will
begin
the
procedure
associate
with
the
establishment
of
the
regulator
.
he
may
rest
assure
that
if
this
do
not
happen
,
Fianna
Fáil
will
bring
its
own
Bill
to
the
House
.
notwithstanding
the
government
's
commitment
last
year
to
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
over
a
protracted
period
,
nothing
happen
.
I
accept
that
responsibility
transfer
from
one
minister
to
another
,
so
it
be
not
entirely
on
the
minister
's
shoulder
.
if
,
however
,
the
same
lethargy
be
hold
sway
again
,
we
will
proceed
and
move
to
bring
we
own
Bill
forward
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
use
he
contact
in
the
waste
collection
sector
to
seek
to
continue
the
moratorium
on
price
increase
for
that
period
of
time
.
the
Taoiseach
indicate
early
today
that
he
do
not
expect
to
see
any
change
in
the
charging
structure
for
the
next
15
to
18
month
.
this
give
adequate
time
for
the
report
the
minister
will
seek
to
be
compile
and
for
the
regulator
to
be
establish
.
unfortunately
,
Sinn
Féin
have
fail
to
understand
the
marketplace
that
exist
at
present
.
it
seem
to
think
the
decision
that
be
take
effectively
remove
the
capacity
of
waste
operator
to
increase
charge
.
a
number
of
the
68
waste
collection
operator
increase
they
price
over
the
past
12
month
.
Sinn
Féin
would
like
to
present
this
as
be
some
kind
of
cataclysmic
event
but
it
be
not
.
the
free
market
have
dictate
that
some
have
raise
they
price
.
if
Sinn
Féin
be
as
serious
about
protect
consumer
as
it
say
it
be
,
it
would
support
the
introduction
of
the
regulator
,
as
set
out
by
the
minister
,
because
it
be
in
the
long
-
term
interest
to
ensure
that
price
gouging
do
not
take
place
.
deputy
Danny
Healy
-
Rae
would
be
wise
to
look
at
the
record
of
what
be
say
.
no
one
refer
to
any
of
that
involved
in
the
waste
collection
sector
as
be
gouger
.
price
gouging
be
different
in
meaning
to
the
colloquial
term
"
gouger
"
.
what
be
say
be
that
there
be
some
unscrupulous
waste
collector
in
the
sector
.
nobody
ever
mention
the
deputy
's
local
operator
.
if
I
be
to
speak
about
promote
the
interest
of
party
in
this
regard
,
clean
Ireland
,
which
be
base
in
Clare
,
be
one
of
the
fine
in
term
of
embrace
modern
technology
,
collect
on
the
basis
of
pay
-
by
-
weight
and
spearhead
the
introduction
of
new
technology
.
it
be
outstanding
.
if
the
rest
of
the
sector
be
half
as
well
verse
in
the
development
of
technology
as
the
O'Donoghue
brother
be
in
develop
clean
Ireland
,
there
would
be
no
need
for
we
to
be
here
today
.
sadly
,
there
be
some
who
reside
outside
the
group
that
advocate
for
the
industry
and
do
not
participate
in
it
.
we
must
put
that
kind
of
a
structure
in
place
.
Sinn
Féin
would
also
be
wise
to
recognise
there
be
a
compromise
and
the
minister
propose
to
ensure
consideration
be
give
to
family
experience
financial
hardship
.
this
should
be
address
as
part
of
a
social
welfare
Bill
rather
than
attempt
to
do
it
through
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
action
and
environment
.
however
,
since
the
minister
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
this
be
a
government
amendment
,
I
be
pleased
we
achieve
this
level
of
success
.
in
so
far
as
be
possible
,
the
price
freeze
must
,
with
the
support
of
the
mainstream
industry
,
remain
in
place
.
we
must
ensure
that
,
in
tandem
with
the
work
the
minister
have
undertake
with
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
we
begin
the
process
to
establish
a
regulator
and
that
we
all
work
towards
the
main
objective
,
which
be
to
change
the
behaviour
of
how
we
dispose
of
we
waste
in
a
manner
that
give
certainty
to
consumer
so
that
if
they
make
this
shift
and
decide
to
participate
in
the
good
management
of
waste
,
they
will
not
be
penalise
and
goug
by
unscrupulous
operator
.
I
congratulate
the
Green
Party
on
bring
forward
this
proposal
.
the
Green
Party
itself
would
argue
that
this
be
a
iterative
process
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
,
in
particular
,
for
he
speech
.
while
there
may
be
a
healthy
degree
of
scepticism
,
concern
or
question
about
the
legislation
,
the
Minister
of
State
also
pose
a
particular
set
of
practical
and
reasonable
question
that
we
all
would
want
to
address
to
ensure
that
if
it
be
to
happen
,
such
a
scheme
would
be
devise
in
the
most
cost
-
effective
way
and
in
a
way
that
can
be
future
-
proof
.
to
go
back
to
some
basic
point
,
it
be
important
to
reiterate
what
we
be
try
to
do
on
this
little
island
be
respond
in
we
own
way
to
a
what
be
a
global
crisis
,
in
particular
in
term
of
the
production
of
plastic
.
a
article
by
journalist
Sandra
Laville
and
Matthew
Taylor
appear
on
the
online
version
of
the
Guardian
on
Wednesday
,
28
June
.
I
be
reiterate
some
of
what
deputy
Ryan
say
here
.
the
article
state
that
a
million
plastic
bottle
be
buy
around
the
world
every
minute
and
that
the
figure
will
jump
by
another
20
%
by
2021
.
it
state
that
more
than
480
billion
plastic
drinking
bottle
be
sell
in
2016
and
that
this
be
up
from
300
billion
a
decade
ago
.
as
we
know
,
most
bottle
use
for
soft
drink
and
water
be
make
from
polyethylene
terephthalate
,
which
be
recyclable
,
but
,
the
article
continue
,
as
they
use
soar
across
the
globe
,
it
be
impossible
to
keep
apace
with
that
use
by
collect
and
recycle
they
in
order
to
keep
they
from
pollute
in
the
way
that
they
do
,
in
particular
the
ocean
.
deputy
Catherine
Martin
refer
to
microplastic
and
plastic
work
they
way
into
the
food
chain
through
fish
and
so
on
.
the
article
note
Plymouth
University
have
report
that
plastic
be
find
in
one
third
of
UK
-
catch
fish
,
include
cod
,
haddock
,
mackerel
and
shellfish
,
and
that
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
have
call
for
urgent
research
,
cite
increase
concern
for
human
health
and
food
safety
.
therefore
,
it
be
not
just
a
environmental
issue
;
it
be
a
human
health
issue
too
.
the
authority
call
for
this
research
"
give
the
potential
for
microplastic
pollution
in
edible
tissue
of
commercial
fish
"
.
plastic
cannot
be
assimilate
into
the
food
chain
.
that
be
self
-
evident
.
we
know
that
.
where
they
be
ingest
,
they
carry
toxin
that
work
they
way
quite
literally
onto
we
plate
.
what
we
have
here
be
a
rare
outbreak
of
co-operation
and
we
should
embrace
it
.
I
understand
the
government
have
legitimate
question
about
the
inherent
cost
but
the
legislation
can
be
work
on
.
it
be
a
legislative
process
so
it
be
a
iterative
process
.
I
would
also
welcome
any
move
to
work
with
entity
such
as
retail
Ireland
and
Repak
.
it
be
time
for
we
,
as
a
parliament
,
to
re-engage
with
Repak
,
perhaps
through
the
committee
structure
,
because
we
have
legitimate
question
.
the
minister
refer
specifically
to
Repak
when
speak
about
the
producer
responsibility
compliance
scheme
.
there
be
a
review
in
2014
,
when
we
be
in
government
,
but
,
to
quote
the
minister
:
[
a
]
wide
examination
of
issue
within
the
packaging
sphere
be
undertake
and
consideration
be
give
to
the
introduction
of
a
bring
-
back
scheme
for
waste
,
include
beverage
container
.
the
review
report
do
not
recommend
the
introduction
of
a
deposit
and
refund
scheme
,
conclude
that
to
establish
such
a
scheme
be
inappropriate
.
I
be
perplex
by
the
use
of
the
word
"
inappropriate
"
in
view
of
the
operation
of
the
exist
packaging
scheme
and
policy
concern
household
waste
collection
plus
the
high
administrative
cost
of
introduce
such
a
scheme
.
both
the
minister
and
the
Minister
of
State
have
speak
to
the
potential
cost
,
which
be
something
we
have
to
grapple
with
in
a
pragmatic
way
.
however
,
it
be
worth
we
while
to
kick
the
tyre
,
if
one
will
,
on
the
work
that
Repak
do
.
this
be
very
positive
work
to
which
we
all
subscribe
but
a
close
examination
of
it
would
be
a
worthwhile
exercise
.
we
also
need
to
engage
with
the
beverage
company
.
I
nip
out
during
the
debate
for
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
Member
's
bar
.
while
there
I
notice
that
all
the
bottle
behind
the
bar
be
glass
bottle
.
they
be
all
reuse
and
recycle
.
I
be
not
sure
what
mechanism
or
economic
model
be
use
by
the
big
drink
company
in
term
of
they
pricing
but
I
be
sure
the
cost
of
recycling
and
reuse
be
price
into
the
product
for
the
end
user
.
for
the
record
,
I
be
drink
tea
.
if
one
go
into
a
bar
or
any
good
hostelry
and
look
behind
the
bar
,
alcoholic
or
non-alcoholic
beverage
be
not
be
sell
out
of
a
plastic
container
but
a
glass
container
.
if
that
can
be
do
in
all
the
bar
in
Ireland
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
move
towards
a
glass
-
base
approach
for
the
beverage
that
be
sell
by
what
I
call
the
multiple
in
this
country
,
that
be
,
by
the
supermarket
.
if
we
be
imaginative
and
think
laterally
about
how
we
want
to
proceed
,
we
can
achieve
a
lot
.
however
,
this
go
back
to
the
fact
it
be
impossible
at
the
moment
to
keep
apace
with
the
level
of
production
of
plastic
.
there
be
more
be
produce
than
be
be
recycle
.
we
need
to
do
something
.
there
need
to
be
some
positive
disruption
to
that
dynamic
.
we
be
a
maritime
nation
and
,
as
one
,
we
may
think
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
the
Irish
Sea
,
St.
George
's
Channel
and
the
Celtic
Sea
-
however
one
might
want
to
term
that
passage
of
water
-
be
pristine
.
however
,
as
someone
who
have
a
interest
in
sea-
kayaking
,
I
see
on
the
water
first
hand
the
amount
of
plastic
that
end
up
in
we
ocean
and
,
ultimately
,
in
we
food
chain
.
we
do
not
want
to
go
there
from
a
public
health
point
of
view
.
for
all
sort
of
environmental
reason
,
we
need
to
be
smart
about
this
.
this
type
of
co-operation
across
party
political
boundary
be
important
,
especially
on
a
issue
that
unite
we
all
.
I
reiterate
we
congratulation
to
the
Green
Party
on
bring
forward
this
proposal
.
excellent
.
excellent
.
there
be
a
need
to
ensure
that
certain
capital
expenditure
project
be
give
priority
.
I
refer
the
House
to
a
report
commission
by
Cork
and
Limerick
chamber
of
commerce
on
the
need
for
investment
in
the
M20
Limerick
-
Cork
motorway
,
entitle
gear
up
for
M20
:
a
Route
to
success
.
the
report
,
compile
by
Indecon
and
Red
C
,
be
a
detailed
assessment
and
contain
some
very
pertinent
figure
.
one
need
to
recognise
the
action
plan
for
job
,
the
need
for
balance
regional
investment
and
the
need
to
ensure
the
economy
grow
in
the
region
.
there
be
major
challenge
for
young
people
look
to
buy
house
in
the
east
of
the
country
where
a
lot
of
FDI
investment
be
take
place
and
there
be
major
capacity
constraint
in
transport
,
as
well
as
quality
of
life
issue
.
we
need
to
disrupt
the
balance
in
favour
of
the
region
and
this
report
be
very
apposite
and
timely
.
the
report
state
there
be
a
significant
role
for
the
M20
in
enhance
the
environment
for
foreign
direct
investment
and
indigenous
investment
and
that
it
have
the
potential
to
support
a
estimate
4000
-
5400
direct
job
in
the
region
.
it
state
,
"
in
gross
term
exclude
displacement
impact
,
this
additional
direct
job
could
provide
a
annual
gross
exchequer
impact
of
up
to
€
128
million
,
depend
on
the
nature
of
investment
attract
.
"
one
can
parse
that
figure
in
any
way
one
want
but
common
sense
tell
we
that
a
proper
regional
investment
in
infrastructure
will
bring
with
it
a
economic
multiplier
in
the
form
of
job
.
I
ask
the
government
to
consider
open
up
Kerry
,
Cork
,
Limerick
,
Galway
,
Sligo
and
Donegal
in
the
north
-
west
region
,
what
use
to
be
know
as
the
Atlantic
corridor
,
in
the
capital
plan
.
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Shane
Ross
,
tell
I
on
16
November
2016
there
have
be
approval
of
€
1
million
for
early
work
on
the
scheme
.
I
welcome
that
,
because
there
have
be
cross-party
lobbying
for
the
initial
funding
to
get
the
project
under
way
.
he
say
,
however
,
that
the
approval
to
commence
planning
and
design
and
statutory
order
would
cost
between
€
12
million
and
€
15
million
.
Stage
3
,
the
approval
of
the
business
case
by
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
will
not
cost
anything
while
stage
4
,
the
approval
to
submit
the
propose
development
to
a
Bord
Pleanála
,
will
cost
between
€
150
million
and
€
180
million
and
the
approval
to
commence
construction
will
cost
between
€600
million
and
€650
million
.
this
figure
be
from
late
2016
but
they
give
a
fair
indication
of
the
cost
of
the
project
and
I
be
make
the
pitch
for
it
today
.
I
recognise
that
I
be
in
the
presence
of
a
minister
from
the
same
region
and
from
the
county
which
devise
this
report
.
politically
,
if
we
can
all
get
to
stage
2
,
3
or
4
in
the
current
capital
plan
to
keep
it
on
the
agenda
,
it
have
the
potential
to
deliver
a
massive
economic
return
on
investment
in
that
region
.
there
be
cross
-party
support
for
it
and
I
hope
the
government
will
bring
it
a
step
further
in
the
current
capital
plan
.
there
be
no
point
in
try
to
hold
the
tide
back
.
the
digital
economy
be
grow
,
and
either
a
Post
will
be
a
part
of
that
or
it
will
not
.
more
State
and
non-State
service
will
go
online
.
if
we
intend
to
use
the
old
a
Post
model
,
then
a
Post
will
be
in
very
serious
difficulty
.
the
digital
economy
present
significant
opportunity
.
this
be
not
just
a
question
of
provide
service
,
include
digital
one
,
to
old
people
.
what
can
we
do
to
bring
young
people
into
post
office
?
it
should
not
be
the
case
that
the
only
time
any
of
we
go
to
a
post
office
be
at
Christmas
or
during
the
summer
for
foreign
exchange
or
passport
purpose
.
what
will
bring
the
next
generation
into
post
office
?
the
parcel
service
will
be
one
aspect
of
that
,
as
will
banking
and
other
financial
service
.
there
be
significant
opportunity
for
the
company
in
that
regard
.
thanks
to
the
commitment
agreement
that
I
have
pen
with
Eir
,
97
%
of
post
office
will
have
direct
access
to
high
-
speed
broadband
within
the
next
75
week
.
this
be
a
significant
opportunity
to
be
exploit
by
the
post
office
network
.
the
digital
economy
be
grow
.
currently
,
Irish
people
be
spend
€
14000
every
minute
.
the
sad
part
about
it
be
that
€
10000
of
that
be
be
spend
on
goods
and
service
from
outside
Ireland
.
this
year
,
the
digital
market
in
Europe
be
worth
€600
million
.
there
be
considerable
opportunity
for
business
at
every
crossroad
in
Ireland
to
exploit
that
situation
.
in
order
to
do
so
,
they
must
have
access
to
a
accessible
postal
service
.
that
can
be
available
.
the
front
office
be
the
local
post
office
and
the
back
office
be
the
parcel
service
through
the
mail
centre
across
the
country
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
it
seem
to
I
that
week
on
week
,
more
and
more
deputy
be
be
exclude
from
this
process
because
of
the
time
constraint
.
be
there
any
way
that
we
can
facilitate
time
in
this
house
for
this
very
important
segment
?
we
all
have
a
number
of
issue
to
raise
.
I
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
we
to
review
the
practice
and
procedure
of
this
House
.
it
would
allow
for
more

to
be

in
the

I
have
a
technical
question
.
the

Foreshore
(
amendment
)
Bill
be
on
the
long
list
.
the
government
have
give
some
indication

it

legislate
for
the
prohibition
of
micro-plastic
in
that
Bill
.
I
would
like
the

to
clarify
when
it
will
legislate
for
that
.
I
have
a
Bill
that
be
due
before

the
ten

long
since

.
I
have
say
to
the

I
be
willing
to
wait
for
the
publication
of
its

and
that
I
will
be
happy

this
project
over
the
line
,
and
I
believe
he
to
be
genuine
,
we
be
get
bombard
with
metric
,
statistic
and
the
use
of
a
language
that
for
many
people
who
do
not
have
broadband
be
indecipherable
in
term
of
the
political
rhetoric
around
this
.
the
first
question
I
have
be
very
simple
.
do
EU
rule
on
procurement
allow
the
minister
to
descope
or
make
a
tender
less
attractive
to
certain
vendor
,
thus
favour
other
while
the
tender
process
be
live
?
if
SIRO
have
pull
out
of
this
process
,
what
be
to
stop
it
or
any
other
bidder
,
who
might
not
partake
in
this
tender
,
from
look
at
the
legal
position
and
say
it
sign
up
to
a
process
and
the
minister
,
the
State
or
the
government
have
now
make
that
process
less
attractive
for
it
as
a
tenderer
or
bidder
and
why
should
it
not
take
legal
action
to
protect
the
investment
and
commitment
it
have
make
?
the
public
be
confused
and
I
be
confused
because
I
do
not
believe
that
the
transparency
and
the
information
that
we
require
on
this
be
adequate
at
this
time
.
I
do
not
believe
it
be
right
for
the
minister
to
use
the
cover
of
the
fact
that
this
be
a
competitive
tendering
process
.
as
deputy
Dooley
say
,
it
be
down
to
two
entity
at
this
stage
.
the
minister
can
hardly
use
the
cover
of
the
tendering
process
in
the
language
he
be
use
to
explain
the
process
itself
.
what
be
the
original
EU
rule
on
procurement
?
what
be
the
language
that
be
use
by
the
State
in
regard
to
the
EU
so
as
to
protect
that
people
who
have
now
come
out
of
the
process
on
the
basis
that
the
original
tender
be
less
than
what
be
articulate
and
advise
to
they
in
the
first
instance
?
the
minister
do
not
answer
the
question
about
