there
be
something

my
amendment
be
along

we
seek

allow

not
outdated

that
be
the
justification

I
would

be
to
make
clear
that
imprisonment

for
failure
to
pay

be
cause
by
the
inability

if

they

for

do

in
relation

however
,
in
we
view
there
would
be
many
people
who
would
find
it
difficult
to
pay
fine
of
€
100
or
less
at
one
time
and
may
require
that
the
payment
be
make
in
instalment
.
in
this
amendment
,
we
be
try
to
provide
for
that
people
who
be
issue
with
a
fine
of
€
100
or
less
to
pay
it
off
in
instalment
.
the
reason
we
tab
that
amendment
be
that
I
know
people
who
be
in
arrears
with
the
local
authority
for
refuse
charge
to
the
tune
of
€200
to
€300
,
which
on
the
grand
scale
of
thing
seem
quite
a
small
amount
,
but
who
be
pay
the
local
authority
as
little
as
€
5
per
week
to
reduce
that
debt
.
there
will
be
instance
where
fine
be
impose
on
people
in
similar
circumstance
who
be
most
likely
to
carry
multiple
debt
,
for
whom
€
100
will
be
a
significant
amount
.
I
understand
the
point
the
minister
make
about
strike
the
balance
between
the
fine
be
instigate
in
the
first
instance
and
the
need
to
pay
it
.
if
the
minister
would
look
at
this
issue
again
before
report
stage
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
for
fine
of
€
100
or
less
,
there
could
be
a
minimum
or
maximum
number
of
instalment
to
bear
out
the
point
he
make
about
the
number
of
transaction
vis-à
-
vo
the
Court
Service
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
the
minister
take
cognisance
of
the
very
small
proportion
of
people
for
whom
fine
of
€
100
or
less
will
be
quite
significant
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
look
at
it
again
and
come
back
to
we
with
the
exact
statistic
.
the
minister
cannot
say
the
vast
majority
of
fine
relate
to
road
traffic
offence
.

the
effect

if
accept
,
would
be
to
place
in

a
legal
requirement
on
the

to
how
control

at

do
not
contain
provision

to
the
control

the
control
of
vessel
and

be
,
however
,
contain
in
section

to

,
inclusive
.
it
be
the
intention
that
the
Revenue
commissioner
will
make
regulation
under
this
section
specify
the
arrangement
that
will
apply
to
different
type
and
class
of

however
,
on
the
substantive
point
in
both
amendment
,
namely
,
the
control
that
be
to
be
apply
to
foreign
military
naval
craft
and
foreign
military

land
in
the

,
such
aircraft
or
vessel
be
not
liable
to
inspection
or
search
due
to
internationally
accept
principle
and
customary
law
on
sovereign
immunity
.
essentially
,
there
be
no
right
in
international
law
for
any
state
's
military
aircraft
to
enter
the
sovereign
airspace
of
another
state
nor
be
there
a
right
of
naval
vessel
to
enter

territorial
water
of

state
.
entry
require
the
consent
of
the
state
concerned
and
,
of
course
,
there
be
no
obligation
to
grant
it
.
however
,
once
grant
,
the
vessel
or
aircraft
concern
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
consent
state
and
if
it
violate
any
condition
attach
to
that
consent
,
the
only
remedy
available
to
the
consent
state
be
to
require
it
to
leave
its
water
or
airspace
.
as
the
propose
amendment
would
impinge
upon
internationally
agree
principle
and
custom
law
,
the
government
cannot
accept
this
amendment
.
this
be
the
custom
Bill
2014
.
if
the
deputy
wish
to
bring
forward
a
Bill
or
a
amendment
to
other
legislation
to
address
the
issue
outline
by
he
there
be
appropriate
way
of
do
so
.
the
government
be
not
in
a
position
to
accept
this
two
amendment
because
,
as
I
have
state
,
this
be
a
custom
Bill
.
permission
for
foreign
military
aircraft
to

Irish
airport
be

,
include
that
the
aircraft

no
arm
,
ammunition

,
do
not
engage
in
intelligence
gathering
and
that
the
flight
in
question
do
not
form
part
of
any
military
exercise
or
operation
.
as
I
say
,
this
be
a
custom
Bill
.
arguably
,
it
be
a
consolidation
of
legislation
date
back
to
the
1800s
in
relation
to
the
issue
of
custom
.
there
be
a
more
appropriate
mechanism
available
through
which
the
deputy
can
address
the
issue
he
raise
.
for
clarity
,
in
regard
to
civil
aircraft
,
a
Garda
Síochána
have
statutory
power
of
entry
and
arrest
.
however
,
this
power
can
only
be
exercise
where
a
garda
know
or
reasonably
suspect
that
a
person
have
commit
a

.
there
be
no
legislative
basis
to
permit
random
or
routine
entry
to
or
a
search
of
civilian
aircraft
for
the
purpose
of
the
detection
of
any
offence
.
amendment

this

important
we
recognise

if

it
be
because
there
have

we
all
subscribe
to
the
rule
of

in

I
will
explain

the

the

explain

whether
the

section
33
(

provide
that
a
custom
officer
may
detain
any
goods
be
import
or
export
that
he
or
she
have
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
might
be
require
as

in

criminal
proceedings
under

enactment
other
than
the
custom
Act
and
to
place
such
goods
in
the
custody
of
the
Garda
Síochána
or
other
appropriate
authority
for
the
purpose
of

proceedings
.
section
33
(

be
a
new
power
and
be
be
propose
to
cover
instance
where
custom
and
excise
officer
,
in

course

duty
,
discover
item
that
,
while
not
in
contravention
of
custom
law
,
could
be
require

proceedings
involve
breach
of

law
.
a
example
would
be
false
passport
discover
in
a
postal
consignment
.
this
would
not
be
in
contravention
of
any
custom
law
but
would
clearly
be
evidence
of
wrongdoing
under
other
legislation
and
could
be
require
as
evidence
in
criminal
proceedings
.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
,
if
accept
,
would
be
to
limit
the
period
of
detention
of
such
goods
to
30
day
and
,
after
each
period
of
30
day
,
to
require
the
officer
to
seek
permission
from
a
District
Court
judge
to
continue
to
hold

goods
.
it
be
consider
that
a
determination
as
to
whether
goods
detain
under
this
provision
be
require
as
evidence
in
proceedings
would
,
in
the
vast
majority
of
case
,
be
make
without
undue
delay
and
certainly
within
the
30
-
day
period
propose
in
the
amendment
.
however
,
it
would
be
restrictive
and
time
-
consume
to
lay
down
in
legislation
a
requirement
to
return
to
the
court
on
one
or
more
occasion
while
inquiry
be
ongoing
.
on
this
basis
,
I
do
not
accept
the
amendment
.
if
the
deputy
examine
the
Bill
,
section
33
(
3
)
include
the
provision
that
if
,
within
30
day
of
the
detaining
goods
,
the
custom
official
do
not
have
any
good
reason
to
seize
the
goods
,
they
must
be
release
.
other
provision
be
include
in
the
paragraph
the
deputy
want
to
amend
,
section
33
(
4
)
,
which
be
for
case
where
other
goods
,
which
may
be
evidence
in
criminal
proceedings
,
be
detain
.
this
goods
will
be
hand
on
to
the
custody
of
the
Garda
Síochána
as
soon
as
possible
.
the
goods
will
no
long
be
in
possession
of
the
custom
authority
.
in
the
first
case
,
the
custom
authority
either
release
or
seize
within
30
day
and
in
the
second
case
the
Garda
Síochána
have
custody
of
the
goods
.
to
be
helpful
to
the
deputy
,
perhaps
we
need
to
distinguish
between
what
be
a
custom
issue
,
in
effect
,
and
what
be
a
excise
issue
.
if
this
amendment
be
accept
,
its
effect
would
be
to
introduce
a
new
section
in
the
Bill
under
which
the
Minister
for
Finance
would
be
statutorily
oblige
to

the

have
use

not

I
welcome
the
contributor
here
this
morning
.
I
want
to
start
with
the
18
May
deadline
.
that
be
the
deadline
that
be
fix
in
the
mind
of
all
of
we
here
in
term
of
the
expectation
that
childcare
for
healthcare
worker
would
be
provide
at
that
point
.
I
be
talk
about
the
roadmap
.
that
deadline
be
miss
.
what
I
find
extraordinary
,
and
this
what
I
would
like
to
get
a
view
on
from
both
SIPTU
and
the
INMO
,
be
the
litany
of
correspondence
between
the
INMO
,
in
particular
,
and
the
various
line
Department
.
I
have
the
date
here
in
the
INMO
's
submission
:
6
April
;
16
April
;
freedom
of
information
request
in
respect
of
8
April
and
9
April
;
again
two
more
on
9
April
;
on
27
April
;
and
even
on
6
May
.
there
seem
to
I
to
have
be
a
very
proactive
and
progressive
attempt
by
the
INMO
to
engage
with
the
HSE
and
through
the
ambit
of
NPHET
and
the
line
Department
in
respect
of
put
in
place
something
to
meet
the
deadline
of
18
May
.
if
I
look
at
the
evidence
base
here
,
base
on
the
litany
of
correspondence
,
I
would
have
to
conclude
objectively
that
there
be
never
go
to
be
a
serious
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
HSE
,
NPHET
or
even
any
of
the
line
Department
to
provide
any
kind
of
childcare
for
healthcare
worker
.
I
would
like
to
get
the
reaction
of
the
witness
to
that
.
it
seem
to
I
that
there
be
no
concerted
effort
.
there
be
maybe
a
bit
of
pageantry
be
go
through
,
a
bit
of
choreography
,
or
a
pretence
that
they
be
go
to
deal
with
that
issue
.
I
would
like
to
get
the
perspective
of
the
witness
on
whether
they
feel
they
be
take
seriously
as
healthcare
worker
in
respect
of
whether
the
government
be
actually
go
to
come
up
with
a
scheme
that
be
fit
for
purpose
and
to
which
everybody
would
subscribe
.
look
at
the
scheme
up
to
18
May
,
it
be
go
to
be
devise
along
the
line
of
childcare
professional
go
into
the
home
of
healthcare
worker
.
in
my
opinion
,
for
what
it
be
worth
,
and
I
would
love
to
hear
the
witness
's
opinion
,
they
have
never
fully
work
through
what
the
protocol
around
that
would
be
.
it
seem
to
I
that
what
we
be
at
here
be
the
government
be
go
through
a
charade
in
respect
of
take
the
issue
seriously
.
that
be
the
first
point
.
I
would
love
to
get
the
reaction
of
the
witness
to
that
in
the
short
time
that
I
have
.
I
appreciate
that
.
the
message
to
take
away
for
we
,
as
public
representative
and
Teachtaí
Dála
,
be
that
the
issue
of
the
clawback
of
parental
leave
need
to
be
address
.
there
have
to
be
recognition
of
healthcare
worker
in
respect
of
the
amount
of
parental
leave
and
other
leave
that
they
have
take
to
meet
they
childcare
need
.
the
State
owe
they
a
service
or
favour
in
that
respect
in
term
of
seek
to
claw
that
back
.
be
Ms
Ní
Sheaghdha
confident
that
all
of
she
colleague
will
have
access
to
childcare
on
29
June
?
I
join
other
in
thank
the
witness
for
they
contribution
today
and
for
the
clarity
of
thought
they
bring
to
this
proceedings
.
the
message
they
be
impart
to
we
be
well
rehearse
,
perhaps
,
in
that
they
have
speak
on
this
challenge
previously
.
my
first
question
relate
to
the
temporary
wage
subsidy
scheme
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
public
funding
account
for
approximately
58
%
of
wage
in
the
sector
,
be
it
now
time
to
consider
continue
with
the
temporary
wage
subsidy
scheme
for
the
provider
who
will
reopen
in
September
and
to
use
that
as
a
launch
pad
to
build
out
the
employment
rights
and
proper
wage
akin
to
people
's
qualification
,
so
we
can
get
the
wage
element
of
this
resolve
once
and
for
all
?
there
be
a
opportunity
,
which
be
articulate
very
well
to
I
by
Darragh
O'Connor
of
SIPTU
recently
,
whereby
this
could
have
be
a
launch
pad
for
resolve
the
wage
element
of
this
.
we
see
the
high
rate
of
attrition
and
the
fact
that
some
people
will
now
cease
to
avail
of
the
temporary
wage
subsidy
scheme
as
it
relate
to
the
childcare
sector
.
this
have
create
a
massive
amount
of
uncertainty
,
which
the
witness
have
just
articulate
.
perhaps
it
be
time
for
the
State
to
fund
pay
wage
in
a
way
that
be
do
in
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
.
I
have
only
two
minute
leave
.
I
thank
Ms
Byrne
and
gaibh
mo
leithscéal
for
intervene
.
be
that
share
by
the
other
witness
?
I
apologise
to
Ms
Daly
but
I
have
very
little
time
.
that
be
a
"
yes
"
.
I
take
it
that
be
a
"
yes
"
from
all
the
contributor
here
.
we
need
a
launch
pad
for
a
proper
wage
commensurate
with
people
's
qualification
across
the
sector
.
Public
funding
account
for
58
%
of
childcare
provider
's
income
.
this
be
what
we
will
be
tell
late
on
by
official
from
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
we
therefore
,
as
a
society
,
need
to
grasp
that
nettle
.
I
will
move
to
my
second
and
final
question
.
there
be
many
disparate
group
represent
childcare
interest
.
I
have
to
be
honest
;
they
be
all
excellent
people
but
there
be
many
different
voice
and
I
believe
that
now
be
the
time
for
the
sector
to
unite
as
one
voice
because
it
be
sometimes
difficult
for
we
,
as
politician
,
to
distinguish
which
group
represent
what
interest
.
I
put
it
to
the
witness
,
as
advocate
on
behalf
of
child
and
parent
and
as
provider
,
that
now
be
the
time
for
some
sort
of
citizen
's
assembly
to
look
at
the
future
of
childcare
provision
and
the
early
year
sector
in
Ireland
.
perhaps
it
be
time
to
consider
have
one
coherent
voice
in
that
regard
because
,
quite
frankly
,
if
I
be
not
spokesperson
for
child
,
I
would
be
largely
ignorant
of
the
childcare
model
.
I
be
tell
the
truth
in
that
.
I
be
a
father
of
two
young
smally
as
well
,
so
I
have
a
particular
interest
in
this
area
,
but
sometimes
speak
with
one
voice
be
more
coherent
and
can
strengthen
one
's
message
in
interact
with
government
.
I
will
gladly
take
the
balance
of
the
Green
Party
member
's
time
,
if
I
could
.
deputy
Costello
be
very
kind
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
appear
before
we
.
I
want
to
go
back
to
the
staff
ratio
.
there
be
two
story
here
;
there
be
the
29
June
scenario
and
the
September
onwards
scenario
.
what
be
the
Department
's
assessment
of
the
level
of
demand
in
percentage
term
for
29
June
onwards
with
regard
to
staff
?
will
50
%
or
40
%
be
back
?
I
ask
the
witness
to
give
we
a
picture
on
that
.
staff
and
parental
.
I
want
to
get
a
clear
picture
of
what
the
sector
will
look
like
.
if
that
be
50
%
,
and
if
we
be
look
at
the
new
pod
type
arrangement
,
because
we
have
a
considerable
discussion
on
this
in
the
Dáil
some
time
back
,
the
question
arise
as
to
how
staffing
will
be
apply
to
the
new
pod
arrangement
in
September
.
I
presume
it
will
go
back
up
to
100
%
.
can
the
new
pod
system
be
make
work
,
particularly
for
small
and
old
provider
that
have
be
provide
service
in
the
community
for
a
decade
or
two
or
even
long
,
if
a
serious
constraint
be
put
on
they
if
the
pod
system
be
to
be
adhere
to
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
reopening
grant
and
once
-
off
capital
grant
be
be
make
available
?
I
note
what
be
say
about
provider
feed
back
that
they
would
be
able
to
manage
it
,
but
even
if
€
18
million
be
put
in
place
for
additional
staffing
cost
,
training
and
staff
guideline
,
additional
resource
,
hygiene
and
cleaning
consumable
,
if
the
regulatory
regime
on
the
spatial
requirement
be
apply
uniformly
throughout
the
system
it
will
have
a
major
impact
on
provider
throughout
the
State
,
such
that
there
will
be
a
even
high
rate
of
attrition
in
the
number
of
provider
.
what
I
be
get
at
be
if
we
could
get
some
assurance
from
the
Department
and
Tusla
that
the
hammer
will
not
fall
too
hard
and
common
sense
will
be
apply
,
such
that
people
will
be
allow
to
survive
as
long
as
they
meet
,
by
and
large
,
the
requirement
expect
of
they
.
I
appreciate
that
.
we
have
a
good
engagement
with
the
INMO
and
SIPTU
early
regard
healthcare
worker
.
the
evidence
be
there
about
the
level
of
engagement
with
the
INMO
,
in
particular
,
in
respect
of
18
May
,
which
be
the
date
on
which
childcare
be
suppose
to
be
provide
for
front
-
line
worker
.
I
contend
that
there
be
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
State
to
live
up
to
its
promise
to
deliver
for
that
worker
.
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
failure
in
respect
of
that
people
.
do
the
witness
acknowledge
that
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
and
all
Department
fail
that
front
-
line
worker
?
there
be
a
major
issue
whereby
it
considerably
add
to
the
stress
and
strain
place
on
that
worker
in
try
to
do
they
job
.
this
people
have
a
legitimate
expectation
,
which
be
preannounce
in
the
context
of
the
Roadmap
for
Reopening
Society
and
Business
,
that
they
would
have
access
to
that
childcare
facility
but
this
never
happen
.
should
we
not
now
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
State
towards
that
people
?
do
they
not
deserve
a
apology
for
that
or
some
acknowledgement
of
the
failure
to
which
I
refer
?
I
apologise
for
cut
across
Dr.
Lynch
.
why
be
that
not
signal
at
a
early
stage
to
the
organisation
that
represent
that
worker
?
it
would
have
be
much
easy
for
people
to
digest
if
there
be
legitimate
issue
such
as
that
relate
to
insurance
.

at
one
level
that
the

maintain
there
be
substantive
amendment

he
have
rule
some
of

out

be
it
possible

to
reserve
the
right

then
come

the
logic

it

I
have
a
question
for
Mr.
Gunning
.
he
mention
the
issue
of
compliance
by
the
contractor
with
the
programme
.
presumably
this
be
a
programme
of
work
,
a
agree
workflow
chart
,
to
use
vernacular
,
non-technical
language
.
where
stand
the
work
programme
at
present
?
I
ask
Mr.
Gunning
to
please
answer
in
layman
's
term
,
not
in
technical
speak
.
what
be
the
work
programme
's
status
?
that
be
okay
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
turn
to
Mr.
Dempsey
,
the
next
question
be
for
the
Department
of
Health
.
be
there
a
representative
of
the
Department
on
the
board
?
that
be
the
first
simple
question
.
there
be
not
.
however
,
presumably
the
Department
of
Health
,
ergo
the
minister
,
ergo
the
taxpayer
,
have
some
mechanism
by
which
it
can
express
a
opinion
on
the
level
of
claim
.
I
refer
both
to
the
cost
of
that
claim
and
the
number
of
that
claim
.
in
other
word
,
have
there
ever
be
a
expression
of
worry
by
anybody
in
the
Department
of
Health
,
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
-
right
up
to
the
minister
-
in
respect
of
the
level
of
claim
?
a
expression
of
worry
or
-----
-----
or
fear
as
to
the
cost
of
claim
and
the
escalate
cost
of
claim
.
I
be
try
to
understand
why
we
be
at
the
position
we
be
at
now
.
without
put
word
in
the
witness
's
mouth
,
it
be
reasonable
for
I
to
assume
from
he
response
that
there
would
have
be
a
expression
of
worry
for
the
process
around
claim
.
this
lead
I
on
to
the
next
question
.
in
he
open
statement
,
Mr.
Dempsey
state
"
the
development
board
and
the
Department
be
near
finalisation
of
this
long
and
detailed
analysis
,
which
include
a
determination
of
potential
update
to
the
timeline
and
cost
of
the
project
.
"
to
what
extent
be
the
claim
process
map
onto
that
"
long
and
detailed
analysis
"
?
if
I
understand
the
previous
witness
correctly
,
it
seem
to
I
that
if
one
be
try
to
map
who
be
win
the
battle
of
the
claim
war
,
the
board
be
about
a
nose
ahead
at
present
but
in
the
long
-
term
analysis
,
it
could
be
that
the
contractor
might
come
out
on
top
from
a
financial
point
of
view
.
in
other
word
,
be
there
a
deep
analysis
of
this
take
place
around
the
claim
process
?
as
soon
as
the
finding
of
that
report
be
available
,
I
ask
that
they
be

I
join
in
welcoming
the
witness
this
morning
.
I
have
a
short
time
so
if
I
can
have
a
rapid
fire
round
of
question
,
I
would
be
grateful
for
that
opportunity
.
where
stand
the
conversation
with
the
government
about
the
resumption
of
point
-
to
-
point
racing
?
Mr.
Kavanagh
have
previously
make
the
point
about
run
meeting
on
racecourse
.
I
speak
specifically
for
Cork
.
I
do
not
think
it
would
be
practical
to
run
Kildorrery
,
Killeagh
or
Dromahane
point
-
to
-
point
meeting
in
Mallow
racecourse
at
this
point
in
time
.
Mr.
Kavanagh
might
have
a
view
on
that
.
we
would
like
to
see
a
resumption
of
point
-
to
-
point
race
in
they
natural
state
in
the
location
that
the
many
people
who
go
to
point
-
to
-
point
race
would
normally
visit
.
in
the
absence
of
people
be
able
to
go
to
point
-
to
-
point
race
,
can
this
race
be
run
in
original
location
like
Kildorrery
or
Dromahane
?
how
soon
will
that
happen
?
on
remuneration
,
be
I
give
to
understand
that
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
have
be
notify
of
the
remuneration
of
all
person
employ
by
HRI
or
its
subsidiary
?
in
essence
,
while
Mr.
Kavanagh
be
say
a
derogation
have
be
seek
—
I
refer
specifically
to
there
be
a
conflict
between
the
derogation
and
gdpr
requirement
in
respect
of
readily
identifiable
person
,
to
use
Mr.
Kavanagh
's
phrase
—
be
the
information
on
the
remuneration
of
the
relevant
person
or
all
person
still
hold
with
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
?
I
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this
.
if
we
can
not
get
the
information
from
HRI
directly
,
can
this
committee
,
in
this
era
of
transparency
,
seek
it
directly
from
the
Department
?
where
a
individual
be
serve
on
a
State
body
,
be
a
member
of
a
board
or
hold
a
executive
position
,
and
where
significant
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
be
be
give
to
the
board
or
organisation
in
question
,
the
least
we
should
expect
be
the
notification
of
the
remuneration
package
.
I
do
not
believe
it
be
fair
to
say
the
information
be
commercially
sensitive
because
HRI
be
,
de
facto
,
operate
a
monopoly
in
respect
of
the
horse
racing
industry
in
Ireland
.
do
Mr.
Kavanagh
agree
?
I
thank
Mr.
Kavanagh
.
my
last
point
be
on
third
party
event
hold
at
HRI
venue
,
such
as
Mallow
racecourse
.
I
still
call
it
Mallow
racecourse
because
I
be
a
proud
Mallowman
.
HRI
call
it
Cork
Racecourse
Mallow
.
there
be
a
fair
at
the
racecourse
,
a
home
and
garden
fair
.
be
it
anticipate
that
third
-
party
event
such
as
that
will
continue
or
will
be
pencil
into
the
calendar
?
I
would
imagine
such
event
provide
vital
revenue
stream
for
HRI
and
the
individual
racecourse
,
but
they
be
also
vital
to
the
non-horse
fraternity
or
confraternity
.
I
want
to
make
sure
there
be
proactive
engagement
to
ensure
as
many
people
as
possible
can
enjoy
the
venue
and
the
event
hold
in
they
.
I
be
put
my
hand
up
for
the
garden
fair
that
take
place
in
Mallow
every
year
.
can
we
expect
the
resumption
of
event
like
that
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
,
subject
to
public
health
guideline
?
I

I
thank

Gabhaim
None
buíochas
None
.
I
apologise
if
my
question
be
repetitive
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
existence
of
the
EU
procurement
directive
.
I
profess
to
be
somewhat
ignorant
on
this
issue
but
I
will
seek
the
witness
's
guidance
.
I
understand
that
article
20
of
the
directive
allow
for
reserve
contract
for
certain
type
of
entity
.
I
be
speak
specifically
about
social
enterprise
or
that
people
who
operate
within
the
disability
sector
.
my
understanding
be
that
this
provision
of
the
directive
be
not
be
operate
in
Ireland
.
I
be
seek
some
sort
of
appraisal
or
response
from
the
witness
from
the
OGP
with
regard
to
whether
it
be
be
operate
.
if
it
be
not
possible
to
answer
my
question
within
the
timeframe
allocate
to
I
today
,
could
there
be
a
report
of
some
write
correspondence
to
the
committee
about
whether
or
not
disability
-
focus
organisation
be
be
exclude
from
apply
for
reserve
contract
?
be
I
to
understand
that
the
OGP
be
not
oblige
to
police
,
a
word
which
I
use
lightly
,
whether
or
not
local
authority
or
public
body
be
actually
exercising
the
reserve
contract
or
the
article
20
provision
?
be
that
the
case
?
Mr.
Quinn
say
that
the
OGP
have
transpose
the
directive
faithfully
,
verbatim
,
if
I
understand
he
correctly
.
it
be
not
a
lead
question
but
it
would
be
worry
if
we
be
not
use
reserve
contract
to
encourage
certain
category
of
worker
who
be
able
to
access
they
.
one
would
hope
that
the
OGP
would
be
as
proactive
as
possible
,
especially
in
the
disability
sector
and
social
enterprise
.
I

front

at
we
next
public
meeting
we
will
meet
the
Strategic
Banking
Corporation
of
Ireland
and
I
ask
member
to
note
the
early
meeting
time
of
9.30
a.m
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
I
thank
Mr.
Black
and
he
colleague
for
attend
before
the
committee
today
.
I
want
to
start
with
the
situation
of
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
a
key
lender
in
the
SME
food
sector
.
in
my
analysis
,
it
have
be
see
as
the
key
bank
to
go
to
for
small
to
medium
-
size
food
company
seek
to
access
lending
for
productive
purpose
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
Mr.
Black
as
to
,
first
,
whether
there
be
now
a
high
level
of
exposure
for
that
sector
,
give
the
decision
of
Ulster
Bank
to
pull
out
of
the
market
,
and
,
second
,
whether
SBCI
be
aware
of
this
and
if
it
be
something
that
be
on
its
agenda
.
if
we
take
the
two
challenge
of
Covid
and
Brexit
,
as
well
as
the
importance
of
the
food
sector
and
the
recognition
of
Ulster
Bank
as
be
a
go
-
to
bank
for
small
to
medium
-
size
food
company
that
be
export
drive
,
be
there
a
consciousness
within
SBCI
of
the
need
to
plug
that
gap
in
lending
?
be
this
a
conversation
that
be
take
place
at
present
?
I
would
like
to
get
that
perspective
from
Mr.
Black
,
if
I
may
.
be
my
perception
right
and
be
my
research
solid
in
say
that
there
be
a
strong
relationship
between
food
company
and
Ulster
Bank
in
particular
?
I
accept
that
there
be
strong
relationship
with
other
bank
.
Ulster
Bank
be
,
however
,
the
go
-
to
bank
for
certain
entity
in
the
food
sector
.
I
refer
,
for
example
,
to
small
,
mainly
family
-
run
start
-
up
or
,
perhaps
,
high
potential
start
-
up
company
that
be
scaling
up
and
export
.
I
be
seek
comfort
from
the
SBCI
on
what
Mr.
Black
say
about
the
mou
.
be
that
Mr.
Black
's
view
,
insofar
as
he
can
speak
for
Ulster
Bank
and
insofar
as
we
be
still
go
through
a
process
here
?
I
do
not
want
to
see
a
chunk
of
lending
potential
slip
off
the
radar
and
a
chunk
of
a
sector
that
be
vital
to
Ireland
's
economic
interest
find
itself
in
a
position
where
it
have
no
go
-
to
bank
for
the
type
of
funding
the
SBCI
provide
to
the
on-lender
.
can
Mr.
Black
give
I
some
level
of
comfort
in
that
regard
?
a
signal
from
the
SBCI
in
respect
of
that
matter
would
give
some
assurance
to
people
who
live
,
breathe
and
work
in
this
sector
every
day
.
I
understand
that
the
agriculture
fund
set
up
by
the
SBCI
be
oversubscribe
.
be
it
the
view
of
the
SBCI
that
there
be
potential
for
a
new
funding
facility
in
that
sector
?
again
,
this
be
a
vital
sector
.
it
be
export
-
drive
and
face
the
headwind
of
Covid
-
19
.
obviously
,
Brexit
still
hang
above
many
company
and
producer
like
the
sword
of
Damocles
.
be
it
the
intention
of
the
SBCI
to
look
at
potential
funding
in
the
agriculture
sector
?
it
be
lend
for
productive
purpose
.
the
fund
in
question
be
oversubscribe
in
the
previous
round
.
Mr.
Black
might
also
give
we
he
perspective
on
that
.
can
Mr.
Black
talk
I
through
the
strategic
review
for
the
period
2020
to
2025
?
he
refer
to
new
sme
funding
for
the
energy
retrofit
sector
.
how
advanced
be
that
conversation
at
present
?
when
do
Mr.
Black
see
the
SBCI
move
into
that
sector
for
productive
lending
?
how
do
he
propose
that
that
money
will
be
disburse
?
reference
be
make
to
the
credit
union
.
to
what
extent
do
Mr.
Black
see
credit
union
as
a
viable
option
for
funding
into
this
sector
?
it
very
much
filter
down
to
the
local
economy
.
where
stand
the
conversation
in
that
regard
?
Mr.
Black
mention
the
Department
.
obviously
,
the
SBCI
be
in
discussion
with
the
parent
Department
.
detail
be
important
for
people
like
we
in
the
committee
.
be
that
money
propose
to
be
divest
through
the
SBCI
's
on
-
lending
partner
?
what
be
the
entity
through
which
Mr.
Black
be
talk
about
divest
money
?
I
will
move
very
briefly
on
to
the
issue
of
pay
.
be
pay
rate
for
employee
set
by
the
NTMA
?
they
be
performance
-
related
pay
rate
.
why
be
performance
-
related
payment
make
in
2019
,
for
instance
,
when
SBCI
have
a
loss
that
year
of
€
408000
?
if
I
may
please
Mr.
Black
,
as
I
have
limited
time
,
I
be
not
be
facetious
in
any
way
but
I
want
to
understand
the
dynamic
or
the
metric
Mr.
Black
use
when
determine
pay
rate
.
respectfully
,
I
fail
to
see
the
link
between
quantitative
ease
and
the
setting
of
pay
scale
.
there
be
some
mention
in
the
review
relate
to
the
abatement
and
pull
back
of
SBCI
.
I
would
read
that
language
as
withdraw
.
be
the
bank
's
existence
justify
at
the
present
time
?
I
appreciate
the
chair
for
let
I
back
in
.
I
have
a
example
of
a
sme
that
be
operate
in
the
tourism
,
leisure
and
outdoor
sector
.
the
owner
make
approach
to
Close
Brother
and
KBCI
in
respect
of
SBCI
funding
.
when
he
contact
KBCI
,
he
be
inform
that
it
be
use
the
SBCI
future
growth
loan
scheme
fund
,
but
it
be
,
and
I
quote
from
the
email
,
"
only
offer
loan
to
business
register
with
a
professional
body
"
.
I
ask
the
SBCI
to
carry
out
a
examination
of
that
interaction
internally
.
I
can
give
the
witness
the
name
of
the
company
follow
the
meeting
.
none
of
we
want
to
see
unnecessary
impediment
be
put
in
the
way
of
sme
if
they
happen
to
be
seek
funding
in
a
sector
of
the
economy
that
might
not
pass
muster
with
"
banking
type
"
.
I
might
be
a
little
unkind
in
my
use
of
language
.
the
application
be
somewhat
leave
field
,
but
nonetheless
,
it
be
worth
further
examination
.
the
owner
seem
to
have
to
jump
through
hoop
with
the
SBCI
in
order
to
pass
muster
.
the
main
point
that
I
be
make
be
that
certain
sector
of
the
economy
should
not
be
discount
on
the
basis
that
they
be
not
deem
to
be
fashionable
or
de
rigueur
.

I
join
in
welcoming
Ms
Forbes
and
she
team
before
we
today
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
RTÉ
have
do
throughout
the
pandemic
as
part
of
its
public
broadcasting
remit
,
particularly
in
reassure
people
and
relieve
they
anxiety
over
the
past
12
month
or
so
and
impart
information
base
on
science
and
fact
.
I
only
have
a
few
minute
.
there
be
so
many
thing
I
would
like
to
talk
about
but
I
will
focus
on
the
independent
sector
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
independent
production
sector
be
protect
under
the
Broadcasting
Act
2009
.
I
want
to
delve
a
little
deep
into
how
Ms
Forbes
propose
to
increase
that
funding
as
we
open
up
society
and
the
economy
.
what
reassurance
can
she
give
to
that
sector
that
it
will
be
the
beneficiary
of
increase
funding
for
output
for
the
next
12
to
24
month
?
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
she
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
there
be
a
obligation
on
RTÉ
as
per
the
legislation
and
she
have
confirm
that
it
will
fulfil
that
commitment
.
that
be
where
I
be
go
with
my
point
so
I
welcome
that
reply
.
I
wholeheartedly
agree
about
how
people
procure
they
content
now
and
the
multiplicity
of
device
that
be
available
to
people
.
we
have
not
be
strong
enough
politically
in
acknowledge
that
content
be
not
free
.
there
be
a
price
to
be
pay
and
a
cost
incur
in
create
content
.
we
will
all
watch
with
interest
what
happen
in
Australia
and
Ms
Forbes
make
a
point
about
how
that
might
permeate
through
to
Ireland
.
I
be
interested
in
whether
RTÉ
be
now
think
about
5g
and
thing
like
the
roll
-
out
of
enhance
fibre
broadband
.
Donnybrook
and
the
citadel
that
be
RTÉ
be
a
place
where
there
be
a
lot
of
production
go
on
but
surely
to
goodness
with
the
advent
of
5G
,
and
people
be
already
talk
about
6g
,
there
be
a
mechanism
to
use
more
geographical
location
to
produce
content
and
give
voice
to
the
region
in
how
we
produce
content
in
this
country
,
because
the
technology
would
allow
we
to
do
that
.
okay
.
I
thank
Ms

I
apologise

I
thank
the
chairman
for
facilitate
I
as
I
have
some
technical
issue
.
I
welcome
the
official
.
I
will
focus
on
programme
b
,
land
transport
,
which
be
80
%
of
the
overall
gross
expenditure
for
2019
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
the
2021
total
be
€
3.3
billion
.
arise
from
land
transport
,
there
be
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
.
the
Secretary
General
will
be
aware
that
there
be
a
serious
backlog
in
driver
theory
testing
and
driver
testing
.
approximately
100000
people
be
wait
for
driver
theory
testing
and
the
number
be
similar
for
the
other
test
.
today
's
issue
be
the
relationship
between
the
Department
of
Transport
and
the
RSA
in
work
through
the
backlog
of
list
.
I
wish
to
explore
further
that
relationship
in
how
resource
be
deploy
by
the
Department
to
the
RSA
.
the
reason
I
be
ask
specifically
about
the
rsa
be
that
notwithstand
the
positive
engagement
that
I
have
have
with
the
agency
on
driver
theory
testing
and
driver
test
backlog
,
the
announcement
in
the
past
number
of
day
of
a
interim
solution
to
be
provide
by
move
driver
theory
testing
online
do
not
get
off
to
a
great
start
because
the
number
of
people
who
will
be
test
under
that
online
system
will
be
4000
.
there
be
also
further
inherent
issue
then
as
to
how
the
technology
be
deploy
.
why
,
for
instance
,
be
only
4000
people
be
test
online
with
this
new
interim
solution
?
how
be
the
department
resource
that
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
rsa
with
the
Department
to
ensure
that
we
move
from
4000
be
test
up
to
the
full
cohort
and
backlog
be
test
,
which
be
the
full
100000
plus
of
people
who
be
wait
for
test
?
what
be
the
technological
issue
arise
from
this
interim
solution
where
we
be
be
tell
that
to
apply
for
the
online
driving
test
someone
have
to
have
a
window
8
personal
computer
,
PC
,
or
above
and
that
that
use
a
phone
,
tablet
or
Mac
computer
will
be
exclude
,
as
will
that
use
android
or
iOS
?
applicant
must
also
be
able
to
use
Google
Chrome
and
the
minimum
speed
have
to
be
5
mbp
.
I
want
to
explore
with
the
Department
its
relationship
with
the
rsa
on
the
basis
that
it
be
a
key
department
in
get
Ireland
move
again
in
a
post
Covid
-
19
society
.
if
we
be
to
get
people
off
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
,
pup
,
and
other
Department
of
social
Protection
payment
to
enable
they
to
move
,
we
need
driver
theory
and
driver
testing
to
be
fit
for
purpose
.
what
be
Mr.
Spratt
's
current
appraisal
on
when
the
Department
expect
that
full
cohort
of
people
to
be
test
and
what
resource
be
be
deploy
by
he
Department
to
ensure
that
the
rsa
be
fully
resource
so
that
people
can
get
back
on
the
road
?
I
welcome
that
assurance
.
the
100000
people
wait
for
the
driver
theory
test
and
the
100000
who
be
wait
for
the
full
test
may
take
some
comfort
from
that
word
.
for
the
cohort
who
be
wait
on
the
driver
theory
test
,
the
technology
need
to
be
user
-
friendly
and
fit
for
purpose
and
there
should
be
protocol
put
in
place
in
term
of
the
use
of
the
technology
,
in
that
when
camera
technology
be
be
use
,
assurance
be
give
to
the
person
who
be
be
test
that
any
datum
collect
be
collect
in
a
safe
and
appropriate
way
.
that
be
important
for
people
who
have
decide
to
put
trust
in
the
system
.
if
the
RSA
can
reach
a
target
of
50000
per
month
,
the
list
will
be
get
through
within
a
short
space
of
time
.
I
welcome
the
statement
by
the
Secretary
General
on
provide
we
with
a
update
and
commitment
in
respect
of
close
of
business
tomorrow
.
it
be
important
we
ensure
we
can
get
people
move
again
.
so
many
people
be
reliant
on
this
.
it
be
a
important
service
for
everybody
in
this
country
.
I
have
a
couple
of
thing
to
mention
to
Mr.
Spratt
before
we
close
up
.
I
do
not
want
Mr.
Spratt
to
give
I
a
answer
now
,
in
term
of
the
road
in
County
Offaly
.
there
be
a
special
case
for
north
County
Offaly
,
because
the
road
be
over
peat
.
Mr.
O'Leary
be
nod
in
agreement
.
there
be
a
serious
issue
there
,
in
term
of
road
safety
.
can
someone
please
have
a
look
at
the
R400
?
the
engineer
and
councillor
need
the
money
for
it
.
the
local
population
need
it
.
there
be
road
safety
issue
with
the
R400
in
the
area
where
the
old
Derrygreenagh
work
be
.
there
be
a
serious
situation
in
north
Offaly
,
because
it
be
go
over
peat
.
the
other
thing
I
want
to
briefly
mention
be
the
1951
cié
pension
scheme
.
I
do
not
want
to
go
into
it
in
detail
.
there
be
people
there
for
40
year
who
have
pay
into
a
pension
scheme
and
be
leave
in
a
precarious
situation
.
the
trustee
have
make
a
high
court
application
.
there
should
be
no
further
discussion
of
the
1951
scheme
,
until
that
happen
.
another
member
of
the
committee
have
already
raise
this
.
the
Department
need
to
keep
a
eye
on
it
,
because
there
be
people
who
have
pay
into
that
scheme
throughout
they
term
of
employment
with
CIÉ
.
the
last
thing
I
want
to
raise
with
the
witness
be
the
issue
of
bus
shelter
.
I
have
have
to
write
,
as
a
member
of
a
local
authority
and
as
a
deputy
,
to
the
chair
of
the
National
Transport
Authority
,
about
bus
stop
for
Mountrath
,
Castletown
,
Borris
-
in
-
Ossary
,
Doonane
,
Crettyard
and
Ballylynan
.
it
be
crazy
stuff
.
there
be
provision
under
the
local
authority
act
bring
in
by
the
former
minister
,
Mr.
Phil
Hogan
,
whereby
that
power
be
give
to
local
authority
.
I
do
not
agree
with
he
on
many
thing
,
but
one
of
the
thing
he
do
be
the
provision
in
that
act
.
there
be
huge
frustration
at
local
authority
level
,
because
they
feel
there
be
significant
micromanagement
by
the
Department
of
Transport
.
local
authority
have
excellent
engineer
.
there
be
good
local
authority
member
.
there
be
good
management
system
in
place
.
I
know
it
be
a
matter
for
the
minister
of
Transport
more
than
the
witness
,
but
I
do
not
want
to
let
the
opportunity
pass
.
we
need
to
allow
the
local
authority
to
breathe
.
we
need
to
breathe
a
bit
of
life
and
democracy
back
into
local
authority
.
can
the
issue
of
bus
shelter
be
delegate
back
to
local
authority
?
if
one
go
over
the
Border
,
into
the
six
County
,
there
be
bus
shelter
all
over
the
place
.
there
be
bus
shelter
at
every
half
-
mile
point
on
the
road
,
include
for
school
bus
.
we
cannot
seem
to
get
they
in
county
Laois
or
Offaly
and
every
other
deputy
here
will
concur
with
I
on
this
,
in
term
of
they
county
.
it
be
too
bureaucratic
.
it
be
the
local
authority
.
give
it
the
money
.
let
it
do
it
.
it
will
do
it
cheap
as
well
.
I
ask
Mr.
Spratt
to
come
back
to
I
with
a
note
on
that
.
I
be
say
that
in
a
constructive
way
.
it
be
good
news
about
the
driving
test
.
I
welcome
that
staff
number
be
be
increase
.
we
look
forward
to
that
be
expedite

Department
for

provide
on
a

of
issue

couple
of
thing
to

I
do
not

serious
issue
there

it
.
the

.
there
be
road
safety
issue
with
the
R400
in
the
area
where
the
old
Derrygreenagh

.
there
be
a
serious
situation
in
north
Offaly
,
because
it
be
go
over
peat
.
the
other
thing
I
want
to
briefly
mention
be
the
1951
cié
pension
scheme
.
I
do
not
want
to
go
into
it
in
detail
.
there
be
people
there
for
40
year
who
have
pay
into
a
pension
scheme
and
be
leave
in
a
precarious
situation
.
the
trustee
have
make
a
high
court
application
.
there
should
be
no
further
discussion
of
the
1951
scheme
,
until
that
happen
.
another
member
of
the
committee
have
already
raise
this
.
the
Department
need
to
keep
a
eye
on
it
,
because
there
be
people
who
have
pay
into
that
scheme
throughout
they
term
of
employment
with
CIÉ
.
the
last
thing
I
want
to
raise
with
the
witness
be
the
issue
of
bus
shelter
.
I
have
have
to
write
,
as
a
member
of
a
local
authority
and
as
a
deputy
,
to
the
chair
of
the
National
Transport
Authority
,
about
bus
stop
for
Mountrath
,
Castletown
,
Borris
-
in
-
Ossary
,
Doonane
,
Crettyard
and
Ballylynan
.
it
be
crazy
stuff
.
there
be
provision
under
the
local
authority
act
bring
in
by
the
former
minister
,
Mr.
Phil
Hogan
,
whereby
that
power
be
give
to
local
authority
.
I
do
not
agree
with
he
on
many
thing
,
but
one
of
the
thing
he
do
be
the
provision
in
that
act
.
there
be
huge
frustration
at
local
authority
level
,
because
they
feel
there
be
significant
micromanagement
by
the
Department
of
Transport
.
local
authority
have
excellent
engineer
.
there
be
good
local
authority
member
.
there
be
good
management
system
in
place
.
I
know
it
be
a
matter
for
the
minister
of
Transport
more
than
the
witness
,
but
I
do
not
want
to
let
the
opportunity
pass
.
we
need
to
allow
the
local
authority
to
breathe
.
we
need
to
breathe
a
bit
of
life
and
democracy
back
into
local
authority
.
can
the
issue
of
bus
shelter
be
delegate
back
to
local
authority
?
if
one
go
over
the
Border
,
into
the
six
County
,
there
be
bus
shelter
all
over
the
place
.
there
be
bus
shelter
at
every
half
-
mile
point
on
the
road
,
include
for
school
bus
.
we
cannot
seem
to
get
they
in
county
Laois
or
Offaly
and
every
other
deputy
here
will
concur
with
I
on
this
,
in
term
of
they
county
.
it
be
too
bureaucratic
.
it
be
the
local
authority
.
give
it
the
money
.
let
it
do
it
.
it
will
do
it
cheap
as
well
.
I
ask
Mr.
Spratt
to
come
back
to
I
with
a
note
on
that
.
I
be
say
that
in
a
constructive

on
9.30
a.m.
next
Tuesday
,
1
June
,
the
committee
will
meet
in
private
session
.
on
the
inspection
regime
in
respect
of
HAP
and
RAS
,
I
have
a
parliamentary
question
from
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
I
will
speak
specifically
about
the
local
authority
of
Cork
County
Council
and
Cork
City
Council
.
it
show
that
the
number
of
inspection
carry
out
to
September
2020
in
County
Cork
be
611
and
in
the
city
of
Cork
be
434
.
notwithstanding
the
public
health
restriction
,
we
can
take
out
all
of
the
last
12
month
in
term
of
the
inspection
regime
.
be
the
Secretary
General
satisfied
that
the
inspection
regime
be
properly
fund
-
we
all
speak
from
we
own
experience
as
public
representative
-
such
that
it
can
be
ensure
that
the
policy
and
legislation
be
work
effectively
and
we
do
not
have
family
live
in
absolute
slum
?
that
be
how
I
would
describe
some
of
the
property
I
have
see
that
be
beneficiary
of
ras
or
hap
payment
.
I
contend
that
the
inspection
regime
be
not
fit
for
purpose
.
I
do
not
want
to
put
the
blame
on
the
local
authority
.
what
be
the
link
between
the
Department
and
the
local
authority
in
respect
of
ensure
the
inspectorate
pass
muster
and
be
fit
for
purpose
?
I
put
the
question
to
the
Secretary
General
.
I
be
conscious
of
my
time
.
the
point
I
make
here
be
that
the
witness
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
issue
with
inspection
.
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
have
have
a
bear
in
term
of
the
number
of
inspection
.
I
ask
that
this
be
prioritise
,
so
that
the
Department
would
liaise
with
the
local
authority
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
inspection
regime
be
fit
for
purpose
,
robust
,
and
properly
resource
,
and
so
that
there
be
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
whole
-
time
equivalent
,
wte
,
that
would
be
task
with
this
.
that
be
the
only
ask
I
have
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
fair
to
ask
a
tenant
to
walk
around
with
a
mobile
phone
to
look
at
he
or
she
house
.
we
have
to
get
people
back
into
house
as
quickly
as
possible
.
this
be
about
taxpayer
's
money
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
if
we
be
talk
about
taxpayer
's
money
,
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
have
quite
literally
slum
landlord
.
this
be
the
outworking
and
the
resourcing
of
the
policy
.
family
with
child
with
respiratory
illness
be
come
to
I
because
they
be
not
in
proper
,
fit
-
for
-
purpose
accommodation
.
that
be
a
poor
day
for
Ireland
in
term
of
how
we
deal
with
family
under
that
scheme
.
I
thank
Mr.
Doyle
and
he
team
from
the
Department
for
join
we
today

of

,
I
will
start
by
wish
Niall
well
.
forgive
I
,
if
I
refer
to
you
in
a
informal
manner
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
in
that
Department
and
I
have
work
with
you
in
the
past
.
we
have
all
be
tremendously
impressed
by
the
leadership
that
you
have
give
in
such
challenging
time
.
I
note
that
you
say
you
be
retire
,
but
you
be
step
down
as
Secretary
General
.
we
hope
that
you
will
stay
within
the
service
in
some
way
,
shape
or
fashion
.
personally
,
I
wish
you
well
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
both
for
the
work
that
it
do
at
the
bilateral
level
in
term
of
its
bilateral
relation
with
country
throughout
the
globe
and
also
at
the
multilateral
level
where
it
deal
with
the
Unite
Nation
and
other
such
organisation
.
we
be
lucky
to
have
a
Department
of
foreign
affair
that
be
staff
by
what
I
would
I
call
the
A
team
in
term
of
the
work
that
it
do
as
a
department
throughout
the
globe
.
I
note
,
in
particular
,
the
reference
to
consular
service
.
for
we
,
as
tds
,
and
for
Senator
,
we
primary
interface
with
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
be
normally
through
either
consular
service
or
the
Passport
Office
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
that
that
often
hidden
and
silent
work
be
very
significant
and
that
it
have
help
so
many
of
we
constituent
throughout
the
country
,
particularly
where
bereavement
have
occur
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
role
because
it
be
vitally
important
,
and
also
that
it
would
be
resource
appropriately
.
let
I
start
with
that
.
on
passport
,
where
stand
the
foreign
birth
registration
process
?
that
might
be
one
that
the
Secretary
General
might
want
to
defer
to
he
colleague
.
I
be
happy
to
receive
a
note
after
this
meeting
,
if
that
be
possible
,
in
term
of
a
real
-
time
analysis
of
where
the
foreign
birth
registration
be
at
present
.
I
will
move
on
.
it
be
significant
that
today
we
have
a
British
-
Irish
intergovernmental
meeting
here
in
Dublin
.
the
organisation
of
that
will
consume
a
lot
of
the
resource
of
the
Department
.
where
be
the
priority
in
respect
of
the
reconciliation
fund
in
the
light
of
the
challenge
of
Brexit
and
Covid
and
be
there
a
clear
earmarking
of
fund
now
to
meet
that
challenge
?
I
would
like
a
understanding
of
where
the
thinking
be
on
how
that
resource
be
deploy
and
if
there
be
a
pivot
towards
the
challenge
of
Brexit
,
or
not
.
I
thank
Mr.
Burgess
.
I
will
move
now
the
Irish
Aid
programme
.
a
number
of
conflict
have
arise
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
particularly
in
Ethiopia
where
there
be
a
Irish
embassy
and
aid
programme
.
I
refer
to
the
Gambella
and
Tigray
region
.
I
be
concerned
about
Irish
citizen
who
be
work
in
that
region
.
I
be
concerned
on
the
one
hand
that
there
may
not
be
a
sufficient
deployment
of
resource
to
ensure
the
safety
and
security
of
Irish
citizen
and
,
on
the
other
,
that
the
programme
,
in
particular
what
be
know
as
the
safety
net
programme
to
ensure
food
security
,
be
be
hamper
by
the
conflict
.
can
Mr.
Burgess
reassure
we
that
there
be
sufficient
protection
of
Irish
citizen
,
in
particular
embassy
staff
,
Irish
,
non-Irish
and
local
,
and
of
that
work
in
ngo
in
the
conflict
area
in
order
that
they
can
carry
out
they
work
?
what
be
they
status
?
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
if
increase
resource
have
be
deploy
into
that
effort
in
real
time
.
that
be
reassuring
.
that
be
the
first
time
that
we
have
hear
that
.
we
have
read
about
the
conflict
in
Tigray
but
it
be
reassuring
that
there
be
clear
protocol
for
the
safety
of
both
embassy
staff
and
that
work
on
the
ground
.
I
cannot
let
the
opportunity
pass
to
ask
about
Bóthar
and
whether
there
be
any
financial
exposure
of
Irish
Aid
or
the
Department
to
the
recent
Bóthar
scandal
.
can
the
Secretary
General
tell
we
anything
about
any
exposure
that
the
taxpayer
have
have
?
I
be
conscious
of
what
the
chair
be
say
.
I
will
put
the
question
another
way
.
have
Irish
Aid
ever
fund
Bóthar
?
that
be
a
factual
yes
-
no
answer
.
I
want
to
get
a
perspective
without
prejudice
any
ongoing
case
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
occupy
territory
and
the
disbursement
of
funding
,
the
late
round
of
which
be
about
€
12.7
million
but
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
.
be
the
department
satisfied
that
this
disbursement
be
go
exactly
where
it
need
to
go
?
I
know
there
be
a
particular
emphasis
on
funding
education
within
the
occupy
territory
.
can
Mr.
de
Búrca
or
the
Secretary
General
provide
a
perspective
on
the
importance
of
funding
by
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
the
Irish
taxpayer
into
the
occupy
territory
?
I

to

the

in
Ramallah

understand
what
a
variation
be
?
I
have
six
minute
so
let
we
not

any
plámás
.
the
variation
would
be
make
at
the
behest
of
the
project
director
.
be
that
the
case
?
be
it
at
the
behest
of
the
design
team
?
Mr.
Devine
have
answer
the
question
and
I
thank
he
.
it
be
not
the
main
contractor
make
the
variation
,
it
be
the
board
make
the
variation
that
give
rise
to
the
claim
.
I
would
like
a
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
.
I
be
try
to
understand
this
correctly
.
I
thank
Mr.
Devine
.
so
who
be
the
employer
's
representative
in
this
process
?
the
architect
.
help
I
out
here
.
the
architect
be
the
designer
of
the
project
from
day
one
but
the
architect
be
also
the
arbiter
in
respect
of
the
decision
on
claim
.
be
this
correct
?
in
broad
term
I
be
correct
in
what
I
be
say
.
Mr.
Devine
be
say
a
independent
person
be
build
in
but
it
be
still
the
architect
and
it
be
still
come
from
the
project
board
side
.
that
be
the
point
.
that
be
fine
.
there
be
906
claim
notify
under
clause
10.3
for
determination
by
the
employer
's
representative
.
Mr.
Devine
have
send
we
the
document
on
the
10.3
clause
and
there
be
six
subheadings
.
person
will
be
able
to
interpret
they
quite
easily
.
if
I
understand
it
correctly
what
the
witness
have
state
today
be
the
value
of
that
906
claim
be
now
approximately
€
446
million
.
be
that
correct
?
there
be
nine
dispute
agree
and
no
long
in
dispute
management
to
the
value
of
€
2.9
million
.
that
be
correct
.
we
do
not
have
the
main
contractor
or
any
of
the
subcontractor
before
we
.
we
do
not
have
the
mechanical
,
electrical
or
lift
contractor
before
we
.
we
have
to
take
everything
Mr.
Devine
be
say
at
face
value
.
I
be
try
to
dig
a
little
bit
deep
on
this
.
it
seem
to
I
the
claim
arise
from
variation
make
.
notwithstanding
the
line
,
which
be
well
co-ordinate
,
that
have
be
put
forward
to
we
today
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Mr.
Gunning
that
external
cost
will
drive
this
project
well
beyond
whatever
figure
be
to
be
determine
and
well
beyond
the
initial
cost
and
the
state
public
cost
,
there
be
also
the
issue
that
the
development
board
,
and
I
be
try
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
,
be
part
of
the
process
of
drive
up
cost
because
of
the
variation
it
be
make
.
be
this
a
reasonable
statement
to
make
?
effectively
,
the
main
contractor
be
the
postbox
use
for
any
subcontracting
increase
or
variation
.
the
witness
explain
what
a
variation
or
claim
be
.
where
there
be
such
variation
to
the
order
outline
,
any
mechanical
,
electrical
or
lift
variation
have
to
come
from
the
subcontractor
to
the
main
contractor
through
that
postbox
to
the
board
.
be
this
correct
?
do
I
have
that
right
or
be
I
wrong
?
okay
.
okay
.
be
it
reasonable
in
a
normal
contractual
process
to
claim
for
time
?
be
this
Mr.
Devine
's
experience
as
a
project
director
?
the
project
be
run
into
billion
of
euro
at
this
stage
.
be
this
normal
practice
?
Mr.
Gunning
have
speak
about
a
inordinate
number
of
claim
.
he
refer
to
the
heat
of
the
battle
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
will
go
back
to
the
906
claim
notify
for
er
determination
under
the
10.3
clause
.
have
we
determine
that
the
estimate
cost
of
outstanding
claim
be
€
446
million
?
I
be
sorry
.
that
be
what
the
contractor
be
claim
.
can
Mr.
Devine
clarify
what
have
be
settle
from
that
€
446
million
?
this
lead
I
to
my
next
question
about
the
legal
process
.
this
be
a
matter
of
public
record
so
it
should
not
be
sensitive
information
.
can
the
witness
quantify
the
number
of
proceedings
that
have
end
up
in
the
high
Court
?
on
how
many
occasion
have
the
development
board
end
up
in
the
high
Court
?
who
have
instigate
that
proceedings
and
what
have
be
the
cost
to
the
taxpayer
,
ultimately
,
of
that
?
that
be
public
knowledge
-----
it
be
public
knowledge
so
please
give
a
straight
answer
.
it
be
not
commercially
sensitive
.
what
be
the
cost
so
far
?

practical
,
procedural
question
for
we

I
want
to
ask
Mr.
Reid
if
he
be
aware
there
be
a
proposal
by
the
HSE
to
close
the
Owenacurra
centre
in
Midleton
,
County
Cork
,
where
19
resident
will
be
rehouse
across
a
number
of
other
setting
throughout
the
county
and
possibly
beyond
.
I
have
two
point
.
first
,
we
still
do
not
have
sight
of
what
the
cost
of
refurbishment
would
be
.
second
,
it
be
we
understanding
that
it
be
propose
to
rehouse
or
rehome
some
people
in
institutional
setting
like
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
in
Glanmire
and
also
in
St.
Catherine'
,
and
possibly
on
the
site
of
St.
Finbarr
's
Hospital
in
Cork
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
HSE
be
propose
to
re-institutionalise
people
at
a
time
when
the
HSE
policy
and
government
policy
be
to
decongregate
,
I
think
that
would
be
take
very
seriously
.
I
ask
that
the
HSE
take
another
look
at
this
decision
on
the
basis
that
people
be
very
concerned
,
give
where
it
be
propose
that
people
will
be
send
to
,
in
that
this
further
institutionalise
they
.
all
I
be
ask
at
this
stage
be
that
Mr.
Reid
take
another
look
at
this
and
run
the
rule
over
it
,
as
chief
executive
officer
.
I
will
leave
it
there
.
SouthDoc
be
very
important
.
during
the
pandemic
,
a
number
of
cell
be
take
out
of
action
,
and
that
be
the
fact
of
the
matter
.
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
as
well
as
the
Cork
centre
,
be
take
out
.
this
mean
that
car
be
go
much
further
afield
to
cover
off
service
on
a
out
-
of
-
hour
basis
.
it
mean
that
doctor
be
much
more
stretch
,
if
they
be
do
home
visit
.
please
do
not
tell
we
how
the
service
work
.
we
know
how
the
service
work
.
there
be
a
fear
that
the
€
7.5
million
of
taxpayer
's
investment
in
this
service
be
not
buy
enough
scrutiny
of
the
service
that
be
be
provide
,
notwithstand
the
fact
it
be
a
separate
entity
.
there
be
a
presence
by
the
HSE
on
the
board
of
SouthDoc
.
to
my
mind
,
that
busy
the
taxpayer
and
the
HSE
great
scrutiny
of
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
on
deputy
Colm
Burke
's
point
,
which
he
run
out
of
time
on
,
I
share
he
view
.
more
and
more
people
be
now
go
to
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
on
a
accident
-
and
-
emergency
basis
and
bypass
SouthDoc
because
they
do
not
feel
confident
that
they
will
be
see
at
time
by
SouthDoc
.
we
need
to
deal
with
perception
in
the
public
mind
as
to
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
I
be
very
familiar
with
the
Mallow
service
and
the
Mitchelstown
-
Fermoy
service
.
they
be
excellent
service
staff
by
brilliant
people
.
I
could
not
say
enough
good
thing
about
they
.
however
,
we
do
not
have
a
service
in
Youghal
out
of
hour
.
someone
who
phone
from
Youghal
be
expect
to
go
to
Midleton
.
that
be
a
journey
of
about
half
a
hour
.
the
service
at
time
be
stretch
between
the
Waterford
border
and
the
Kerry
border
.
there
need
to
be
a
review
of
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
€
7.5
million
investment
of
taxpayer
's
money
busy
the
HSE
great
scrutiny
to
ensure
that
it
be
triage
and
build
out
a
public
message
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
if
people
can
avoid
the
accident
and
emergency
department
in
CUH
and
go
through
they
local
service
,
while
that
service
be
very
good
,
there
might
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
scrutiny
or
some
sort
of
review
as
to
how
the
service
operate
,
particularly
within
the
city
.
there
need
to
be
a
look
back
on
why
the
Blackpool
and
Fermoy
-
Mitchelstown
service
be
close
because
the
HSE
take
out
a
massive
geographical
area
there
.
they
be
take
out
during
the
pandemic
.
I
ask
-
this
be
my
only
ask
-
that
the
HSE
look
back
on
how
SouthDoc
operate
during
the
pandemic
.
a
little
report
could
be
furnish
to
member
of
the
Oireachtas
or
there
could
be
just
a
look
back
on
the
basis
of
what
lesson
can
be
learn
,
how
the
service
,
which
be
by
and
large
a
excellent
service
,
can
operate
more
efficiently
and
whether
it
can
cover
more
sufficiently
east
Cork
.
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
not
cover
the
Youghal
area
.
it
do
not
have
sufficient
resource
to
cover
the
Youghal
area
and
ensure
that
people
in
Youghal
or
further
afield
be
not
force
to
go
to
Midleton
or
onward
to
Cork
,
directly
to
a
accident
and
emergency
department
.
I
thank
the
witness
and
the
staff
of
the
HSE
for
they
work
.
it
be
a
big
organisation
with
a
lot
of
difficult
situation
and
there
be
obviously
always
room
for
improvement
.
I
also

the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General

Mr.
McCarthy
,
and
he
staff
for
attend

assist
in
we

I
remind
member
that
it
be
okay
to
come
back
into
the
committee
room
.
I
know
some
have
be
complain
for
the
last
year
about
not
be
able
to
come
into
the
room
.
they
can
come
into
the
parlour
if
they
feel
they
can
manage
thing
well
in
here
.
sometimes
we
talk
over
each
other
because
of
the
time
lag
that
arise
when
we
be
meet
remotely
.
that
be
difficult
for

committee
secretariat
.
be
it
agree
to
request
that
the
clerk
seek
any
follow
-
up
information
and
carry
out
any
action
agree
at
today
's
meeting
?
agree
.
be
be
also
agree
that
we
note
and
publish
the
open
statement
and
briefing
for
today
's
meeting
?
agree
.
I
remind
member
that
it
be
okay
to
come
back
into
the
committee
room
.
I
know
some
have
be
complain
for
the
last
year
about
not
be
able
to
come
into
the
room
.
they
can
come
into
the
parlour
if
they
feel
they
can
manage
thing
well
in
here
.
sometimes
we
talk
over
each
other
because
of
the
time
lag
that
arise
when
we
be
meet
remotely
.
that
be
difficult
for
witness
and
member
.
I
apologise
for
that
.
I
try
to
manage
it
as
good
I
can
.
I
will
start
with
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
.
my
understanding
of
this
be
that
in
2014
NAMA
adopt
a
secondary
objective
of
the
facilitation
of
the
development
of
office
accommodation
in
Dublin
and
have
a
interest
in
17
ha
of
the
22
ha
of
the
undeveloped
land
in
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
.
my
understanding
be
that
Mr.
McDonagh
's
board
approve
a
business
plan
for
that
site
in
September
2014
and
that
there
be
no
formal
target
set
out
in
that
business
plan
.
I
also
understand
that
by
the
end
of
2018
construction
be
under
way
or
have
be
complete
on
70
%
of
the
land
in
which
NAMA
have
a
interest
and
that
by
May
2020
construction
be
under
way
or
have
be
complete
on
site
accounting
for
86
%
of
the
land
in
which
NAMA
have
a
interest
.
regard
the
commercial
development
of
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
,
can
Mr.
McDonagh
confirm
for
I
what
percentage
of
the
NAMA
land
have
see
full
construction
to
date
?
may
I
hear
Mr.
McDonagh
's
understanding
of
the
impact
of
Covid
on
commercial
development
?
we
now
know
that
more
people
will
be
work
from
home
and
that
few
people
will
be
require
to
inhabit
,
if
you
will
,
commercial
development
.
can
Mr.
McDonagh
give
I
a
insight
into
NAMA
's
thinking
in
respect
of
the
future
of
commercial
development
,
such
as
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
in
particular
,
in
the
context
of
the
impact
of
Covid
on
commercial
space
into
the
future
?
what
I
be
get
at
be
whether
there
will
be
a
need
to
pivot
back
to
residential
.
that
be
ultimately
what
I
be
try
to
figure
out
.
we
understand
NAMA
's
remit
and
the
legislation
,
but
there
be
the
potential
for
3500
residential
unit
at
the
Poolbeg
West
site
.
that
be
clearly
understand
.
we
know
that
there
be
about
93000
sq.
m
of
commercial
development
.
will
Mr.
McDonagh
talk
I
through
where
Poolbeg
be
at
present
?
my
question
be
specific
.
have
a
prefer
bidder
be
identify
for
NAMA
's
venture
partner
in
the
old
glass
bottle
site
at
Poolbeg
West
?
at
what
stage
of
development
be
the
Poolbeg
West
SDZ
?
what
impact
have
Covid
have
on
the
development
of
Poolbeg
?
what
impact
,
if
any
,
have
increase
construction
cost
have
on
the
budget
for
the
development
of
Poolbeg
West
?
on
the
35000
residential
unit
,
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
breakdown
or
understanding
of
how
that
will
be
divide
between
social
,
affordable
and
commercial
development
.
if
social
house
be
to
be
develop
on
the
site
,
what
will
the
ownership
structure
of
the
land
be
?
will
it
be
lease
?
will
it
be
use
by
approve
housing
agency
?
I
ask
Mr.
McDonagh
to
give
a
more
in
-
depth
analysis
of
the
Poolbeg
site
.
I
will
conclude
.

I
thank
the
chairman
for
facilitate
I
in
this
.
I
be
very
grateful
.
I
want
to
understand
well
the
relationship
between
a
Taisce
and
various
Department
and
statutory
funding
body
.
we
all
understand
,
possibly
on
a
superficial
level
,
the
work
a
Taisce
do
in
respect
of
education
.
it
be
inherently
good
work
,
particularly
when
it
come
to
blue
flag
and
green
school
initiative
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
to
understand
the
financial
relationship
.
we
can
bear
in
mind
that
between
2018
and
2019
,
there
be
a
restatement
of
figure
.
I
wish
to
understand
that
good
and
how
the
Department
have
deal
with
that
matter
.
I
also
would
like
to
get
a
overview
of
the
relationship
that
exist
,
include
whether
there
be
service
level
agreement
in
place
.
if
there
be
,
how
do
they
operate
?
do
the
line
Department
that
be
funder
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
restrict
fund
,
have
a
expectation
about
the
governance
of
any
organisation
that
they
may
fund
,
even
if
it
be
a
charitable
organisation
?
I
be
seek
the
support
of
the
committee
for
we
to
write
to
the
line
Department
with
a
view
to
get
further
information
in
order
to
well
inform
ourselves
.
I

I
welcome
Mr.
Gloster
and
he
team
to
the
committee
.
a
article
appear
on
Monday
,
27
September
,
in
the
Irish
Examiner
where
Mr.
Gloster
speak
at
length
in
respect
of
private
provision
of
residential
care
.
the
article
state
:
Mr
Gloster
say
that
many
private
care
placement
be
work
well
but
add
:
''
the
big
risk
of
that
level
of
dependency
on
private
care
be
private
operator
can
leave
the
market
;
they
can
leave
quickly
,
they
can
sell
on
;
company
structure
can
become
very
complex
,
and
the
reality
be
that
if
you
have
a
private
provider
in
a
house
with
four
young
people
,
if
that
private
provider
leave
the
market
,
the
State
have
only
one
option
and
that
be
for
we
to
take
over
that
provision
there
''
.
be
there
a
shift
in
policy
in
Tusla
such
that
it
be
go
to
wind
down
private
care
provider
?
be
that
a
signalling
of
a
policy
shift
?
what
be
the
real
-
time
position
in
respect
of
that
?
the
witness
might
bear
in
mind
that
I
have
ten
minute
and
there
be
four
question
I
would
like
to
ask
.
I
have
a
couple
of
question
follow
on
from
that
.
as
I
understand
it
,
there
be
a
entity
call
Positive
Care
,
which
be
on
Tusla
's
list
of
private
provider
.
a
cursory
look
at
the
information
for
this
organisation
show
that
it
run
13
or
14
house
.
base
on
the
ratio
of
staff
to
child
,
I
conclude
that
there
could
be
anything
between
30
and
60
child
be
care
for
across
that
service
.
what
do
the
future
look
like
for
a
entity
like
Positive
Care
and
why
do
such
a
organisation
exist
in
the
first
instance
?
it
seem
obvious
that
Tusla
be
not
able
to
meet
the
provision
it
be
require
to
deliver
.
I
be
not
try
to
use
load
language
here
but
such
entity
would
not
exist
if
Tusla
,
objectively
speak
,
be
do
its
job
and
make
provision
for
that
place
within
its
own
system
.
I
acknowledge
that
and
I
appreciate
Mr.
Gloster
's
response
.
Tusla
provider
be
inspect
by
HIQA
but
Tusla
inspect
the
private
provider
on
its
list
.
at
what
stage
do
Mr.
Gloster
anticipate
there
will
be
a
change
in
that
regime
such
that
the
private
provider
be
inspect
by
HIQA
?
I
appreciate
the
frankness
of
that
response
.
it
be
about
as
frank
as
one
can
get
.
I
hope
the
regime
will
change
to
reflect
it
.
historically
,
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
have
report
significantly
on
the
cost
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
.
we
be
all
mindful
that
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
be
about
provide
care
for
child
and
ensure
,
in
a
court
hearing
or
any
judicial
process
,
that
the
voice
of
the
child
be
hear
.
I
be
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
.
we
have
go
some
way
towards
legislate
for
change
in
that
area
during
the
lifetime
of
the
previous
dáil
.
what
be
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
's
understanding
of
the
status
of
the
draft
head
of
a
Bill
to
make
change
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
and
what
engagement
have
it
have
with
the
Department
in
that
respect
?
Mr.
Gloster
say
in
he
open
statement
:
"
the
agency
receive
referral
to
its
child
protection
and
welfare
service
in
2020
at
just
below
70000
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
in
the
early
stage
of
the
Covid
-
19
response
,
we
see
a
concerning
decrease
.
"
have
all
of
that
70000
referral
be
expedite
?
be
Tusla
on
time
and
ahead
of
the
curve
in
term
of
all
referral
that
come
to
it
in
respect
of
any
child
or
family
?
it
be
propose
to
note
and
publish
the
correspondence
.
we
will
also
forward
it
to
the
health
committee
and
include
the
question
from
deputy
Carthy
as
to
whether
,
in
that
committee
's
opinion
,
this
committee
be
require
to
examine
the
matter
further
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
the
next
business
be
the
work
programme
.
the
Dáil
be
not
schedule
to
sit
next
week
.
that
bring
we
to

November

when
we

when
we
agree
we

I
mention
that
we
might
need
to

last
week
,
we
agree
to
revisit
the
work
programme
for
the
new
year
in
late
November
or
early
December
.
I
suggest
that
we
do
so
at
the
end
of
November
rather
than
let
it
go
on
too
long
.
the
list
of

have
be

do

as
no

have
be
raise
,
that
conclude
we
consideration
of

finally
,
under
any
other

,
I
note
that
we
have
work
to
do
on
a
number
of
report
,
which
we
will
discuss
in
private

.
do
member
want

?
as
there
be
no

,
we
will
,
as
agree
,
go
into

after
which
we
will
adjourn
until
4
November
,
when
we
will
engage
with
representative
of
RTÉ
on
Exchequer
funding
.
I
would
like
to
echo
deputy
McAuliffe
's
comment
in
seek
to
request
that
the
NTA
would
come
before
we
.
it
would
be
vital
,
if
at
all
possible
,
that
we
would
hear
from
it
on
this
issue
.
I
will
be
brief
.
as
be
usual
on
a
Thursday
there
be
sometimes
conflict
diary
requirement
.
I
want
to
seek
reassurance
in
respect
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
special
report
113
on
procurement
to
vehicle
by
the
Irish
Coast
Guard
,
that
there
be
a
clear
matching
up
between
the
four
recommendation
that
be
aim
at
strengthen
.
I
be
quote
from
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
report
that
they
be
aim
,
''
at
strengthen
the
Department
's
procurement
procedure
for
the
future
''
.
can
we
be
assure
of
the
follow
for
each
of
the
recommendation
for
the
strategic
plan
for
equipment
requirement
:
that
all
procurement
of
equipment
should
involve
technical
and
user
input
at
the
planning
stage
;
that
all
significant
procurement
should
be
base
on
formal
assessment
of
operational
need
;
and
that
the
Department
would
carry
out
regular
review
of
its
procurement
procedure
and
process
?
I
want
a
short
reassurance
from
the
Secretary
General
that
that
be
all
now
under
way
.
the
Secretary
General
state
that
the
Department
have
strengthen
its
analytical
tool
for
procurement
analysis
.
I
remain
to
be
assure
that
we
have
a
robust
and
fit
-
for
-
purpose
system
.
can
the
Secretary
General
give
we
that
assurance
?
that
be
my
first
question
.
I
will
ask
three
question
specifically
and
then
I
will
take
my
leave
.
the
second
question
be
about
national
secondary
route
.
major
construction
project
begin
in
2020
be
under
way
.
I
believe
strongly
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
policy
intervention
by
the
Department
in
respect
of
that
national
secondary
route
that
be
in
a
deplorable
state
,
such
as
the
N73
,
in
such
a
way
that
would
ensure
that
TII
,
fund
project
like
that
relate
to
the
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
road
.
the
latter
be
,
arguably
,
one
of
the
bad
national
secondary
route
in
the
country
,
even
though
it
be
a
vital
artery
for
commercial
and
domestic
traffic
in
the
north
Cork
area
and
a
vital
route
between
Kerry
and
Dublin
.
I
continue
to
make
the
case
for
funding
for
this
road
.
I
ask
that
the
N73
project
remain
on
the
agenda
,
and
I
make
no
bone
about
raise
the
matter
at
this
forum
.
on
the
Leap
card
,
the
Secretary
General
inform
we
that
"
year
-
on
-
year
increase
in
fare
revenue
mean
that
PSO
funding
requirement
be
relatively
stable
.
"
I
be
seek
to
expand
Leap
card
service
in
my
county
of
Cork
,
specifically
on
route
between
Mallow
and
Cork
,
where
there
a
massive
number
of
commuter
on
a
daily
basis
and
where
there
be
still
not
a
Leap
card
service
,
even
though
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
a
viable
route
.
I
can
travel
from
Bray
to
Pearse
Station
use
a
Leap
card
,
but
I
cannot
go
from
Mallow
to
Cork
.
there
be
a
inequality
between
service
on
the
eastern
seaboard
and
that
in
the
region
.
I
ask
that
,
as
a
policy
,
the
Department
look
at
the
roll
-
out
of
Leap
card
service
for
the
town
that
service
big
city
,
such
as
Cork
.
it
be
vitally
important
.
it
be
propose
to
note
and
publish
that
correspondence
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
that
conclude
we
consideration
of
correspondence
for
today
.
the
next
item
on
we
agenda
be
the
work
programme
.
last
week
,
we
agree

programme
to
the
end
of
the

and

I

in
welcoming
the
Secretary
General
and
she
official
.
it
be
nice
to
see
some
familiar
face
from
my
old
Department
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
pose
some
question
.
I
will
stay
on
the
Covid
-
19
restart
grant
scheme
.
in
that
context
,
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
state
:
a
grant
scheme
that
rely
on
self
-
declaration
should
have
a
number
of
key
control
.
one
of
this
be
the
completion
of
post
payment
check
to
ensure
that
claimant
have
satisfied
the
condition
of
the
scheme
and
be
accordingly
entitle
to
the
payment
they
receive
.
the
Secretary
General
state
:
"
I
should
emphasise
that
any
consideration
of
the
oversight
of
the
restart
scheme
must
have
due
regard
to
the
circumstance
in
which
that
scheme
be
design
and
launch
"
.
we
have
to
try
to
reconcile
the
two
.
it
would
be
useful
to
articulate
in
concise
term
how
the
Department
intend
to
answer
the
question
pose
by
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
.
it
be
widely
acknowledge
that
money
flow
into
business
quickly
and
it
be
a
responsive
scheme
in
that
regard
.
however
,
question
have
be
pose
and
it
would
be
useful
to
understand
the
timeline
for
any
review
or
what
such
a
review
would
look
like
.
we
understand
what
the
scheme
be
and
how
it
be
operate
.
I

for
that
.

a
timeline
for
the
conclusion
of
the
review
?

back
be

I
thank
the
Secretary
General
and

colleague
for
appear
before
the
committee

I
wish
to
focus
in
the
first
instance
on

institution
,

b
,
specifically

the
entire
budget
of
the
Department
be
rapidly
nudge
up
to
€
1
billion
.
as
a
result
,
I
assume
that
will
give
rise
to
many
new
challenge
.
under
the
project
2040
national
development
plan
,
NDP
,
there
be
€460
million
allocate
to
the
national
cultural
institution
investment
programme
.
the
project
incorporate
into
that
programme
include
the
conversion
of
the
Bishop
Street
warehouse
into
a
secure
,
environmentally
control
archival
repository
for
the
National
Archive
,
the
National
Library

redevelopment
,
the
development
of
the
Crawford
Art
Gallery
in
my
native
Cork
and
the
proposal
to
renovate
the
National
Gallery
of
Ireland
,
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
,
the
National
Concert
Hall
,
the
Abbey
Theatre
and
the
Chester
Beatty
Library
.
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
be
prepare
a
design
procurement
of
the
history
of
Ireland
gallery
.
all
be
laudable
project
and
be
to
be
support
.
however
,
they
will
all
bring
challenge
for
the
Department
.
the
big
shift
in
the
spending
capacity
of
the
Department
in
respect
of
this
cultural
institution
under
the
NDP
give
rise
to
a
number
of
specific
question
.
first
,
what
expertise
and
system
have
increase
at
Department
level
to
ensure
the
efficient
disbursement
of
funding
for
approve
capital
development
project
?
if
I
may
,
I
have
further
specific
question
that
may
assist
the
process
before
Ms
Licken
defer
to
she
colleague
.
they
be
very
specific
question
.
first
,
who
will
be
responsible
for
procurement
and
project
management
for
the
capital
development
project
in
the
cultural
institution
?
what
be
the
precise
role
of
the
Department
,
the
cultural
institution
and
,
where
applicable
,
the
opw
in
this
?
who
ultimately
manage
that
relationship
?
who
undertake
the
procurement
and
daily
project
oversight
?
who
sign
off
on
procurement
and
spending
,
the
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
if
overspend
occur
and
if
the
Legislature
,
through
this
committee
,
need
to
interrogate
certain
issue
,
who
will
appear
before
this
committee
?
look
at
the
project
I
refer
to
,
it
be
statistically
possible
there
might
be
issue
that
may
arise
in
respect
of
overspend
and
public
procurement
that
may
give
rise
to
question
that
have
to
be
answer
.
if
overspend
occur
,
who
would
appear
before
this
committee
?
would
it
be
the
Secretary
General
and
she
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
furthermore
,
what
additional
resource
and
expertise
have
be
make
available
to
the
cultural
institution
to
deal
with
this
increase
oversight
and
workload
?
that
be
just
one
parcel
of
question
.
there
be
further
question
on
this
issue
.
who
will
sign
off
on
the
procurement
?
I
want
to
understand
the
process
.
will
it
be
the
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
the
context
in
which
I
ask
this
question
be
that
I
worry
that
the
voluntary
board
of
the
institution
that
be
earmark
for
capital
development
project
,
notwithstand
they
expertise
on
cultural
and
governance
matter
,
might
not
have
expertise
on
procurement
matter
.
with
this
money
come
down
the
track
to
this
laudable
project
,
I
worry
that
there
might
not
be
the
capacity
within
the
institution
to
be
able
to
have
that
expertise
.
I
be
try
to
tease
out
whether
it
be
the
intention
of
the
Department
to
buttress
that
institution
with
additional
skill
set
as
befit
the
specific
project
as
it
arise
.
the
Secretary
General
say
a
dedicated
team
have
be
establish
comprise
economist
.
I
would
like
to
be
assure
whether
there
be
team
of
procurement
specialist
and
governance
specialist
be
ready
for
the
delivery
of
this
project
.
there
be
a
gap
there
and
it
be
give
rise
to
concern
.
I
do
not
feel
assure
by
the
answer
so
far
,
if
I
may
say
that
.
I
thank
Ms
Licken
.
I
appreciate
that
.
we
will
examine
the
matter
further
as
time
go
on
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
that
.
I
want
to
move
on
to
a
quite
bespoke
issue
,
namely
,
that
of
storage
within
the
cultural
institution
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
a
storage
facility
for
the
National
Museum
which
be
house
in
Swords
.
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
's
collection
resource
centre
in
Swords
house
4
million
object
.
this
be
a
extraordinary
figure
.
what
do
the
future
hold
for
the
storage
of
the
key
object
in
we
national
collection
,
regardless
of
the
institution
?
I
understand
that
,
in
the
case
of
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
,
there
be
only
eight
year
remain
on
the
exist
lease
and
that
a
rent
review
that
be
due
in
September
2020
have
still
not
be
conclude
.
if
we
be
seek
to
animate
any
of
the
project
I
outline
,
we
will
have
to
decont
many
of
the
artefact
or
piece
,
be
they
artistic
or
otherwise
,
to
other
site
.
how
be
the
witness
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
storage
of
this
precious
item
within
we
national
collection
,
specifically
in
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
?
what
be
the
witness
do
to
ensure
there
be
a
sustainable
storage
facility
for
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
and
other
cultural
institution
?
may
I
intervene
?
I
have
40
second
leave
in
my
slot
so
I
ask
Mr.
Falvey
not
to
tick
down
the
clock
on
I
.
I
would
like
a
very
specific
answer
in
the
30
second
I
have
leave
.
that
be
not
a
answer
,
with
all
due
respect
.
I
ask
a
specific
question
about
rent
review
.
what
be
the
outcome
of
the
rent
review
?
can
the
witness
assure
this
committee
and
the
people
of
Ireland
that
there
will
be
,
from
2030
onwards
,
a
fit
-
for

purpose
,
modern
storage
facility
for
any
collection
within
the
national
collection
,
be
it

or

remains
of
a

I
happen
to
be
from
Cork
.
I
might
have
a
different
view
to
deputy
McAuliffe
on
the
amount
of
content
that
people
in
the
region
perceive
that
be
attribute
to
Dublin
.
I
will
begin
by
say
"
well
do
"
to
RTÉ
on
its
late
partnership
with
Virgin
Media
Television
in
respect
of
the
six
Nation
Championship
.
that
be
a
wonderful
example
of
collaboration
.
speak
as
a
proud
Munster
man
and
a
Munster
rugby
supporter
,
I
also
commend
RTÉ
,
TG4
and
the
independent
sector
on
the
provision
of
Unite
rugby
Championship
,
URC
,
output
.
I
strongly
believe
that
model
have
provide
excellent
content
for
the
average
punter
sit
at
home
who
want
to
view
rugby
or
sport
output
at
the
high
level
through
the
terrestrial
channel
.
the
URC
be
a
great
example
of
where
the
licence
payer
see
the
good
of
the
utilisation
of
that
fund
.
be
there
plan
to
expand
that
further
?
can
we
expect
to
see
more
of
that
?
do
the
director
general
perceive
that
RTÉ
will
do
more
collaboration
of
that
nature
and
exploit
further
opportunity
so
that
more
and
more
people
can
enjoy
-
because
that
be
what
it
be
about
-
the
output
that
be
come
through
collaboration
of
that
nature
?
be
there
anything
in
the
pipeline
at
present
that
Ms
Forbes
can
tell
we
about
in
respect
of
that
collaborative
model
?
she
speak
about
the
diversification
of
sport
and
,
specifically
,
gender
,
which
be
absolutely
vital
,
but
what
be
in
pipeline
that
will
emb
that
model
further
?
from
the
ordinary
punter
's
point
of
view
,
and
I
be
a
ordinary
punter
in
this
regard
,
when
I
look
at
the
URC
coverage
I
see
the
good
of
RTÉ
,
TG4
and
the
independent
sector
collaborate
.
look
at
the
Irish
examiner
model
of
deliver
sport
at
the
most
local
level
through
a
stream
package
,
I
can
tune
in
to
my
local
team
at
a
county
final
from
the
comfort
of
my
living
room
.
should
we
go
down
to
that
level
of
granularity
?
should
the
national
broadcaster
be
get
on
that
wagon
to
see
where
the
opportunity
lie
to
further
emb
itself
into
that
collaborative
model
so
that
there
be
more
output
and
RTÉ
be
take
feed
from
a
more
diverse
range
of
venue
across
a
more
diverse
range
of
sport
?
the
technology
allow
we
to
do
that
now
.
presumably
,
RTÉ
do
not
need
to
have
a
outside
broadcast
unit
at
every
single
venue
because
it
can
implant
technology
at
the
venue
and
take
the
feed
from
that
.
I
would
love
to
see
more
of
that
from
we
national
broadcaster
:
more
localised
,
more
regionalised
and
more
diverse
output
.
if
Ms
Forbes
can
tell
I
it
be
now
part
of
a
policy
in
RTÉ
to
continue
with
that
,
it
will
give
many
people
a
lot
of
confidence
.
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
I
will
move
on
to
the
independent
sector
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
a
statutory
requirement
for
RTÉ
to
spend
in
respect
of
it
.
for
instance
,
in
2020
,
the
statutory
requirement
be
to
spend
approximately
€
40.2
million
-
Ms
Forbes
might
correct
I
if
that
be
wrong
.
my
understanding
be
that
RTÉ
spend
approximately
€
36.5
million
,
which
be
about
€
3.7
million
under
target
.
I
understand
that
the
Covid
pandemic
be
a
decide
factor
in
that
because
of
cancel
production
and
so
on
,
but
the
underspend
be
then
require
to
be
spend
within
two
year
.
will
Ms
Forbes
elaborate
,
or
educate
we
,
on
how
RTÉ
plan
to
spend
that
underspend
?
again
,
I
speak
specifically
for
the
independent
sector
,
which
be
starve
of
funding
at
present
,
have
plan
afoot
to
deliver
content
and
be
anxious
to
get
go
again
.
what
word
of
assurance
can
Ms
Forbes
give
we
that
that
will
be
spend
?
what
plan
be
afoot
in
that
regard
?
I
ask
the
witness
to
please
forgive
I
if
they
have
answer
a
question
on
this
matter
before
but
I
have
to
attend
another
meeting
.
I
seek
assurance
on
the
future
of
the
Cork
radio
and
television
study
.
can
Ms
Forbes
give
we
a
guarantee
that
there
be
a
sustainable
future
for
Cork
specifically
?
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
if
I

or
have
the

can
I

to
no.
978B
?
I
be
a
little
bit
concerned
.
I
welcome
and
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
Department
have
correspond
with
we
in
respect
of
a
Taisce
.
however
,
I
be
a
little
confused
about
question
Nosemcue
3
and
4
,
specifically
the
reply
to
question
no.
4
,
which
state
:
on
5th
August
2021
,
a
Taisce
respond
to
the
Department
's
letter
note
the
concern
express
therein
and
confirm
that
they
be
"
fully
in
compliance
with
the
DPER
circular
13/2014
.
"
that
still
do
not
answer
the
question
about
the
issue
of
restrict
fund
and
whether
or
not
the
Department
be
fully
satisfied
that
there
should
have
be
,
within
the
final
account
,
specific
reference
to
Circular
13/2014
and
that
same
restrict
fund
.
I
be
wonder
if
,
with
the
agreement
of
my
colleague
and
the
chairman
,
we
can
ask
the
Department
for
further
clarification
on
question
Nosemcue
3
and
4
and
whether
there
be
a
obligation
for
specific
reference
to
the
department
of
Public
expenditure
and
Reform
Circular
13/2014
.
we
should
ask
how
the
Department
have
ask
question
and
satisfied
itself
that
a
Taisce
be
fully
compliant
with
that
circular
.
it
seem
that
the
Department
have
merely
say
it
accept
the
response
from
a
Taisce
.
that
be
my
interpretation
and
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
and
to
guidance
from
the
chairman
.
I
would
like
to
interrogate
that
further
to
satisfy
my
mind
.
can
we
work
on
a
response
to
this
correspondence
from
the
Secretary
General
ask
for
a
further
articulation
of
Circular
13/2014
and
what
happen
when
the
Department
be
engage
with
a
Taisce
in
respect
of
that
circular
?
the
Secretary
General
state
:
there
be
robust
arrangement
in
place
to
monitor
funding
from
the
Department
to
a
Taisce
and
to
ensure
that
such
funding
be
in
compliance
with
the
condition
of
Circular
13/2014
.
this
include
service
level
agreement
,
ongoing
engagement
,
reporting
and
vouch
expenditure
.
I
be
still
not
satisfied
that
the
2019
account
be
as
they
should
have
be
.
if
the
Secretary
General
come
back
to
we
and
state
the
Department
be
absolutely
satisfied
it
have
do
everything
,
then
fair
enough
,
but
I
would
like
to
pursue
the
issue
a
little
further
,
if
I
may
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek

we

we

we
will
seek

.
we
will
seek

.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
apologise
profusely
for
miss
the
entirety
of
the
meeting
thus
far
but
that
be
unavoidable
.
I
apologise
also
if
some
of
my
question
have
be
ask
and
answer
.
if
they
have
,
that
be
fine
.
I
can
take
the
answer
from
the
record
afterwards
.
I
want
to
talk
about
the
Cork
-
Dublin
line
.
there
be
a
announcement
of
approximately
€
91
million
,
as
I
understand
it
,
for
the
upgrading
of
that
line
to
ensure
that
the
speed
at
which
commuter
could
travel
between
Cork
and
Dublin
and
vice
versa
be
speed
up
.
I
want
to
get
a
deep
understanding
of
where
that
spend
be
go
and
how
it
be
propose
to
spend
the
money
.
I
understand
that
signal
upgrade
be
a
component
part
of
that
,
and
possibly
new
intercity
railcar
,
icr
.
I
could
be
wrong
but
Ms
Graham
will
clarify
that
for
I
.
the
reason
I
ask
be
because
,
while
I
be
a
weekly
traveller
on
the
Cork
to
Dublin
line
and
I
be
a
regular
DART
user
,
I
wonder
whether
the
Mark
4
engine
be
fit
for
purpose
in
a
modern
railway
infrastructure
and
whether
there
be
a
proposal
to
replace
that
with
more
energy
-
efficient
carriage
and
train
set
.
where
be
the
NTA
in
term
of
that
conversation
with
Irish
Rail
?
that
be
my
first
question
.
I
thank
Ms
Graham
.
the
other
issue
relate
to
correspondence
that
we
would
have
receive
in
relation
to
bus
shelter
.
person
may
ask
why
be
I
ask
a
question
about
bus
shelter
.
bus
shelter
be
important
to
people
who
do
not
have
they
own
transport
,
particularly
if
they
live
in
intermediate
town
.
for
instance
,
if
you
be
live
between
Cork
and
Limerick
in
a
town
such
as
Buttevant
,
which
have
be
wait
for
a
bus
shelter
for
a
number
of
year
,
it
be
entirely
appropriate
for
I
to
ask
where
the
NTA
be
in
term
of
the
provision
of
such
shelter
and
why
they
be
not
be
roll
out
at
a
quick
pace
to
ensure
that
we
encourage
more
people
to
use
public
transport
.
I
thank
Mr.
Creegan
.
I
appreciate
the
answer
.
I
use
Buttevant
as
one
example
and
I
be
unashamedly
parochial
in
this
sense
.
Buttevant
be
a
example
of
where
infrastructure
be
not
be
roll
out
in
town
and
village
that
depend
on
intercity
route
.
if
some
attention
could
be
give
specifically
to
Buttevant
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
for
that
.
my
final
question
relate
to
fare
structure
.
I
have
a
mountain
of
correspondence
with
the
NTA
in
respect
of
fare
structure
between
Mallow
and
Cork
.
Mallow
be
a
typical
example
of
a
town
that
be
within
commute
distance
of
a
big
city
and
where
I
perceive
that
there
be
a
inequality
as
between
the
commuter
who
commute
to
Cork
from
Mallow
and
the
person
who
travel
,
for
instance
,
from
Greystone
to
Pearse
Station
in
term
of
fare
structure
.
I
note
and
welcome
the
correspondence
that
I
have
receive
from
the
NTA
in
relation
to
the
introduction
of
commuter
fare
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
commuter
fare
because
there
be
thousand
upon
thousand
of
people
who
will
make
the
modal
shift
from
car
to
train
if
the
fare
structure
be
right
throughout
the
country
.
Mallow
be
a
typical
example
of
that
.
the
soon
we
get
that
new
fare
structure
this
year
,
the
good
.
overnight
,
you
will
see
a
demand
for
that
service
among
student
,
worker
and
citizen
in
general
.
that
be
why
I
ask
the
question
about
the
Cork
-
Dublin
upgrade
in
relation
to
speed
.
if
we
can
get
more
rolling
stock
on
that
line
between
Cobh
,
Midleton
,
Cork
,
Mallow
and
Charleville
,
for
instance
,
and
open
up
new
intermediate
station
as
well
,
you
will
create
demand
.
quite
frankly
,
that
be
where
the
minister
be
at
.
that
be
where
the
citizen
be
at
.
the
more
the
NTA
can
influence
that
and
bring
that
about
,
the
more
positive
the
impact
it
will
have
for
citizen
.
if
there
be
a
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
commuter
fare
will
be
introduce
,
as
per
the
NTA
's
correspondence
to
I
already
,
I
would
welcome
that
.
that
be
my
final
question
.
can
I
get
a
response
to
that
?
I
thank
Ms
Graham
.
I
appreciate
that
.
yes
.
that
will
be
do
.
when
we
return
in
February
,
we
will
engage
with
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
.
yes
.
that
will
be
do
.
when
we
return
in
February

we
will

we

that

when
we
return
in

I
welcome
the
refreshingly
honest
answer
to
the
question
we
be
pose
,
even
if
they
be
not
necessarily
the
answer
we
want
to
receive
.
I
will
continue
in
the
vein
of
ask
very
straight
question
.
I
will
start
by
ask
about
the
N73
,
especially
the
stretch
between
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
.
have
Mr.
Walsh
ever
travel
that
road
?
may
I
cordially
invite
Mr.
Walsh
to
travel
that
road
as
soon
as
he
possibly
can
?
it
be
only
then
that
he
would
realise
just
how
awful
a
stretch
of
road
it
be
.
it
be
arguably
one
of
the
bad
national
secondary
route
in
the
country
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
welcome
that
there
be
a
allocation
in
respect
of
Annakisha
South
,
Clogher
Cross
and
Waterdyke
.
I
be
disappointed
,
however
,
that
the
parcel
for
2022
be
only
€
900000
.
I
be
seek
reassurance
that
a
notification
will
be
send
by
TII
to
Cork
County
Council
to
give
formal
notice
that
Cork
County
Council
can
move
to
go
to
tender
on
that
project
.
be
that
the
case
?
have
formal
notification
be
issue
to
Cork
County
Council
?
Mr.
Walsh
will
appreciate
the
point
I
be
make
.
if
TII
be
only
allocate
€
900000
this
year
out
of
a
budget
line
of
approximately
€
10
million
,
the
fear
be
that
Cork
County
Council
will
get
stuck
in
the
gap
.
let
I
just
finish
the
point
,
which
I
be
make
in
good
faith
and
respectfully
.
if
Cork
County
Council
get
stuck
in
the
gap
,
have
spend
€
900000
,
but
cannot
go
to
tender
,
it
cannot
proceed
to
spend
up
to
the
figure
of
€
10
million
.
I
be
seek
a
commitment
that
follow
2022
,
we
will
see
the
tender
issue
,
boot
on
the
ground
,
a
shovel
-
ready
project
and
that
TII
be
proceed
with
the
commitment
.
that
be
what
I
be
seek
here
.
let
I
reiterate
that
.
TII
be
issue
the
notice
to
Cork
County
Council
to
go
to
tender
and
there
will
be
a
budget
line
for
2022
to
2024
that
will
absolutely
deliver
that
project
.
I
thank
Mr.
Walsh
.
he
could
not
be
any
clear
than
that
,
which
I
appreciate
.
that
give
we
great
hope
.
I
refer
again
to
the
N73
and
other
such
project
.
have
TII
give
consideration
to
the
budget
line
for
major
scheme
in
relation
to
County
Cork
?
for
instance
,
the
Ballyvourney
to
Macroom
project
be
come
in
this
year
at
approximately
€
60
million
,
or
€
61
million
if
one
want
to
round
it
up
.
the
perception
hold
by
people
like
I
be
that
the
effect
of
all
of
the
money
go
into
the
Dunkettle
and
Macroom
bypass
of
this
world
,
which
be
the
subject
of
national
priority
,
be
to
suck
the
marrow
out
of
the
bone
for
other
small
project
.
I
acknowledge
that
they
be
small
road
and
less
priority
,
but
this
mean
that
people
like
I
be
fight
on
we
back
for
project
that
be
in
abeyance
for
five
,
ten
,
15
or
20
year
.
be
it
not
incongruous
that
,
if
a
road
be
a
national
priority
under
a
national
development
plan
and
so
on
and
it
be
politically
prioritise
at
government
level
,
it
should
have
a
negative
bear
on
a
local
authority
's
ability
,
in
partnership
with
TII
,
to
deliver
on
national
secondary
route
,
tertiary
route
and
so
forth
?
do
Mr.
Walsh
believe
that
there
should
be
a
rebalancing
of
priority
so
that
Exchequer
funding
for
national
secondary
route
,
which
be
usually
the
main
route
serve
county
,
do
not
get
catch
up
in
a
Samson
versus
Goliath
struggle
where
,
for
example
,
the
N73
be
complete
with
the
Macroom
bypass
?
the
perception
be
that
the
rest
of
the
county
be
pay
for
this
project
.
that
be
the
perception
.
fair
enough
.
I
will
move
on
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
have
make
mention
of
the
efficacy
of
relief
road
.
I
hail
from
the
great
town
of
Mallow
.
there
be
a
budget
allocation
of
€
900000
for
the
Mallow
relief
road
,
which
be
welcome
and
we
be
delighted
.
it
have
be
a
long
-
run
campaign
,
as
have
the
N73
campaign
.
this
be
decade
-
old
campaign
.
what
will
the
€
900000
that
TII
have
allocate
for
the
Mallow
relief
road
get
we
?
once
spend
,
will
it
buy
a
further
commitment
that
the
relief
road
will
actually
be
deliver
?
this
be
a
bit
like
my
N73
.
I
thank
Mr.
Walsh
for
he
response
.
I
welcome
the
commitment
he
have
give
on
the
N73
.
it
give
I
some
hope
,
but
we
will
have
to
keep
a
eye
on
it
.
if
he
could
please
give
I
a
commitment
that
he
will
travel
that
road
himself
-----
do
that
will
absolutely
and
utterly
change
Mr.
Walsh
's
perception
or
give
he
first
-
hand
knowledge
of
just
how
bad
that
road
be
.
I
hope
it
might
cause
the
situation
to
move
more
rapidly
.
no
,
but
Mr.
Walsh
be
the
chief
executive
and
he
carry
a
great
deal
of
influence
.
I
raise
a
matter
with
the
Department
at
we
meeting
.
I
be
still
try
to
understand
what
the
future
of
art
and
antiquity
storage
will
look
like
for
the
State
.
we
be
give
chapter
and
verse
on
the
current
regime
in
north
County
Dublin
,
but
what
I
be
fail
to
understand
be
where
future
-
proofing
be
take
place
,
give
the
involvement
of
local
authority
,
local
museum
,
national
museum
,
national
collection
and
so
on
.
be
there
anything
in
the
language
of
the
letter
that
give
we
,
as
per
we
question
,
comfort
in
respect
of
the
future
-
proofing
of
what
I
euphemistically
call
the
national
collection
,
be
that
art
and
antiquity
,
statue
or
anything
else
?
I
be
not
sure
that
we
have
be
give
the
answer
,
but
I
remain
-----
as
the
Chairman
can
tell
,
I
be
ask
he
advice
and
I
thank
he
for
that
,
but
how
would
it
be
articulate
in
practical
term
short
of
bring
someone
back
to
the
committee
?
I
presume
it
would
be
do
via
further
correspondence
from
this
committee
to
the
line
department
.
I
be
in
the
late
fossilised
stage
myself
now
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
we
can
anticipate
that
there
will
be
a
exponential
increase
in
the
type
of
work
.
New
technology
be
constantly
emerge
,
which
may
necessitate
the
need
for
a
permanent
and
fix
venue
or
venue
,
but
we
do
not
have
a
permanent
and
fix
venue
now
.
it
be
on
a
leasehold
basis
.
I
will
take
advice
from
the
Chairman
and
the
secretariat
,
as
I
wish
to
pursue
this
matter
further
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
slightly
ignorant
of
the
fact
in
this
case
,
but
what
do
a
sustainable
stand
-
alone
site
that
be
in
the
ownership
of
the
State
and
be
future
-
proof
and
cost
effective
look
like
?
I
raise
the
issue
in
the
context
of
seek
to
understand
how
each
of
the
line
Department
operate
its
relationship
with
a
Taisce
.
I
thank
the
committee
for
hold
this
item
over
until
this
week
.
I
want
to
get
a
deep
understanding
of
how
the
service
level
agreement
operate
between
nine
Department
that
be
funder
through
the
education
silo
of
a
Taisce
.
when
I
look
at
the
2019
account
and
the
various
circular
relate
to
the
operation
of
the
relationship
between
the
line
Department
and
a
Taisce
,
the
correspondence
come
back
to
we
reflect
a
concern
in
respect
of
seek
clarification
regard
the
2019
account
.
a
Taisce
's
2019
financial
statement
state
that
a
change
in
a
Taisce
policy
will
result
in
a
stipulation
for
a
small
allowance
for
organisational
cost
and
innovation
in
all
funding
agreement
go
forward
.
that
set
off
a
alarm
bell
in
my
mind
because
I
be
not
sure
whether
some
of
the
funding
that
be
specifically
for
programme
that
be
well
notify
to
we
,
such
as
the
Green
Flag
,
investigate
Forest
,
clean
Coast
and
the
Blue
Flag
,
be
be
bring
out
of
the
educational
silo
of
a
Taisce
,
which
deliver
many
of
the
programme
,
and
into
the
main
a
Taisce
body
.
that
be
the
concern
I
have
and
I
want
to
seek
clarification
.
base
on
the
correspondence
we
receive
back
,
it
seem
there
be
very
specific
engagement
between
the
funder
and
a
Taisce
in
respect
of
buttress
or
strengthen
service
level
agreement
or
review
current
service
level
agreement
or
contract
in
respect
of
that
funding
.
that
provide
one
with
a
degree
of
confidence
.
in
the
case
of
one
Department
,
which
I
think
be
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
the
Department
clarify
this
be
not
compatible
with
public
financial
procedure
,
state
the
grant
money
must
be
spend
entirely
on
the
programme
the
Department
have
agree
to
fund
within
the
specific
condition
of
that
grant
and
that
failure
to
adhere
to
this
condition
could
result
in
funding
be
withdraw
and
possibly
the
recoupment
of
unapproved
expenditure
seek
or
other
legal
enforcement
.
the
impression
I
have
be
that
,
quite
literally
,
a
Taisce
be
take
a
bit
of
a
tranche
of
some
of
that
funding
-----
-----
and
allocate
it
to
a
Taisce
,
which
I
understand
be
essentially
a
membership
organisation
.
when
we
look
at
the
delivery
of
the
programme
I
reference
,
we
can
see
they
be
excellent
programme
and
we
be
very
lucky
to
have
a
organisation
like
a
Taisce
to
deliver
they
.
I
just
want
to
seek
clarity
on
that
.
base
on
the
correspondence
,
it
seem
individual
line
Department
be
take
a
rigorous
approach
to
interrogate
that
relationship
and
the
2019
account
.
I
be
not
a
financial
or
management
accountant
.
if
a
Taisce
be
a
membership
organisation
,
from
a
public
purse
and
financial
probity
point
of
view
,
do
each
of
that
line
Department
,
the
State
,
the
government
or
,
ultimately
,
the
taxpayer
have
a
right
to
look
at
the
financial
strength
or
otherwise
of
the
parent
organisation
when
they
be
fund
that
organisation
?
in
other
word
,
do
the
parent
organisation
have
to
be
in
a
solvent
position
before
it
can
receive
fund
?
that
be
just
a
curiosity
of
mine
.
the
reason
I
be
curious
about
that
be
because
if
,
on
a
Taisce
's
previous
year
's
financial
account
,
auditor
be
say
that
-
and
I
be
quote
from
its
financial
account
-
for
organisational
cost
and
innovation
and
all
funding
agreement
,
that
a
allowance
would
be
make
and
there
would
be
a
movement
of
some
of
the
money
then
,
one
wonder
,
why
that
be
the
case
if
a
Taisce
be
a
financially
robust
organisation
.
hopefully
,
that
can
be
clarify
for
I
.
it
may
not
be
within
the
remit
of
this
committee
to
have
that
clarify
.
again
,
I
seek
the
chair
's
wisdom
on
that
.
it
serve
a
vital
function
in
term
of
the
delivery
of
its
excellent
programme
,
and
it
permeate
out
with
citizen
proactively
involved
in
deliver
that
programme
.
it
have
build
a
consciousness
and
awareness
and
set
of
programme
that
have
have
a
massive
impact
in
community
at
the
most
local
level
.
it
be
important
that
we
preserve
that
and
protect
it
in
every
way
that
we
can
.
it
do
a
vital
piece
of
work
.
however
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
imagine
that
we
should
satisfy
ourselves
that
everything
that
be
be
do
be
absolutely
with
financial
probity
in
mind
.
I
would
like
to
hear
other
member
's
perspective
.
I
have
no
political
agenda
to
undermine
any
organisation
.
I
feel
I
have
to
put
that
on
the
record
.
clean
Coast
Ballynamona
be
in
my
constituency
.
I
raise
many
a
green
flag
myself
when
I
be
a
minister
of
State
.
the
chairman
will
know
from
the
tone
of
the
language
of
my
question
that
it
be
not
with
a
view
to
seek
to
undermine
any
organisation
.
I
state
very
clearly
on
the
record
the
great
work
that
a
Taisce
do
in
respect
of
the
delivery
of
the
programme
but
since
I
be
not
a
financial
or
forensic
accountant
,
I
have
to
rely
on
the
guidance
we
receive
from
the
secretariat
and
the
correspondence
we
receive
from
the
Department
.
we
be
fully
entitle
,
as
I
understand
it
,
to
ask
a
question
of
any
organisation
.
I
be
merely
pose
the
question
and
be
entitled
to
do
that
.
however
,
I
do
not
want
it
infer
that
,
because
I
have
ask
the
question
,
there
be
a
certain
political
motivation
.
I
take
grave
exception
to
that
.
it
be
wrong
that
it
should
be
infer
from
my
question
;
it
be
unfair
.
I
feel
aggrieved
by
the
fact
that
I
would
be
impugn
in
that
way
consequent
to
my
line
of
question
.
my
question
be
ask
with
a
view
to
seek
clarification
.
absolutely
not
.
absolutely
not
.
I
use
the
word
"
solvency
"
because
I
be
seek
to
find
fact
in
regard
to
the
process
as
to
how
this
organisation
be
fund
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
deputy
be
load
the
basis
by
ask
that
question
.
it
be
merely
with
the
purpose
of
find
fact
.
for
that
word
to
be
weaponise
now
,
in
some
fashion
,
I
think
be
quite
patently
wrong
.
it
do
I
a
disservice
when
all
I
be
seek
to
do
be
find
fact
.
in
fairness
to
the
secretariat
,
it
have
put
together
a
very
comprehensive
response
.
I
want
to
state
for
the
record
that
the
response
we
get
from
the
Department
have
also
be
extremely
comprehensive
.
we
accept
that
.
I
ask
member
to
be
helpful
on
this
.
I
will
return
to
it
soon
,
give
it
will
not
take
very
long
if
we
allow
it
to
happen
.
there
be
a
suggestion
that
we
would
have
two
meeting
but
that
would
add
a
further
complication
.
I
ask
member
to
bear
with
I
while
we
nail
this
down
conclusively
.
I
qualify
this
by
say
that
,
if
we
decide
to
take
10
March
as
the
meeting
on
mental
health
and
if
we
accept
the
deputy
's
suggestion
to
hold
a
further
meeting
on
24
March
,
that
will
push
other
issue
a
week
or
two
down
the
road
.
I
reiterate
what
have
be
agree
.
last
week
,
we
agree
we
would
schedule
a
meeting
with
the
University
of
Limerick
,
UL
,
and
include
in
we
invitation
a
request
that
the
chancellor
,
Mary
Harney
,
would
attend
,
give
the
nature
of
she
position
and
the
duration
of
she
tenure
,
along
with
the
president
,
who
be
the
accountable
person
.
that
be
on
7
April
.
UL
's
financial
statement
for
the
year
2019
-
20
should
be
available
to
we
at
that
point
.
in
accordance
with
we
work
programme
,
we
would
then
engage
with
the
Department
of
Finance
on
14
April
and
with
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
after
the
Easter
break
,
on
5
March
.
I
ask
member
to
agree
to
that
on
the
basis
that
we
will
sort
out
late
what
we
will
do
about
the

and
the

,
Climate

Communication
in

.
the
articulation
of
all
of
this
for
deputy
like
I
,
who
represent
both
urban
and
rural
constituency
,
be
that
we
have
village
and
townland
that
be
be
split
down
the
middle
.
the
only
way
I
can
articulate
my
point
be
by
give
a
practical
example
and
that
be
the
village
of
Ballyhooly
,
in
north
County
Cork
.
typical
of
every
small
village
throughout
the
country
,
it
be
quite
literally
be
split
down
the
middle
in
that
part
of
it
be
to
be
provide
with
broadband
through
the
national
broadband
plan
and
the
other
part
be
to
be
provide
for
by
the
market
.
in
the
case
of
Ballyhooly
,
there
be
a
housing
estate
that
quite
literally
be
be
split
down
the
middle
in
this
regard
.
while
we
accept
that
the
market
be
provide
and
that
there
be
a
entity
call
NBI
,
as
public
representative
who
spend
a
lot
of
we
time
advocate
on
issue
such
as
access
to
broadband
,
particularly
in
the
current
climate
of
remote
working
,
we
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
there
be
not
a
great
degree
of
interoperability
or
connectivity
between
NBI
and
the
private
operator
to
solve
problem
and
ensure
provision
of
service
to
people
in
village
.
it
be
extremely
frustrating
.
can
Mr.
Hendrick
provide
any
reassurance
to
public
representative
like
I
that
people
in
Ballyhooly
and
every
village
like
it
throughout
the
country
who
want
to
get
connect
and
have
a
right
to
be
connect
will
be
guarantee
access
,
that
they
will
not
be
deny
access
in
the
time
we
live
in
?
I
appreciate
and
understand
all
of
that
.
when
the
national
broadband
plan
be
roll
out
there
be
a
expectation
-
Mr.
Hendrick
can
tell
I
if
it
be
not
a
legitimate
expectation
-
that
there
would
be
a
more
timely
intervention
in
that
area
where
there
be
serious
gap
.
I
refer
again
to
Ballyhooly
,
because
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
it
be
a
ground
zero
for
every
village
of
a
similar
type
.
there
be
a
expectation
that
there
would
be
a
realisation
of
the
commercial
reality
,
but
also
a
realisation
of
the
corporate
social
responsibility
of
ensure
that
where
there
be
gap
,
right
down
to
micro-
level
,
NBI
would
be
the
responsible
partner
in
ensure
that
where
public
representative
like
I
make
representation
through
we
broadband
officer
in
the
local
authority
or
directly
to
NBI
,
there
would
be
a
understanding
of
that
dynamic
and
there
would
be
move
to
fast
-
track
or
,
at
least
,
recognise
the
fact
that
there
be
household
wherein
there
be
two
parent
work
remotely
and
a
post
-
primary
or
third
level
student
who
be
quite
literally
take
turn
use
the
broadband
such
be
the
lack
of
capability
.
Mr.
Hendrick
speak
about
a
offering
by
nbi
of
minimum
speed
of
100
mbp
,
a
1g
product
and
a
new
2g
product
.
be
NBI
guarantee
that
speed
or
be
it
,
as
set
out
in
the
small
print
,
"
up
to
"
that
speed
.
there
be
a
big
difference
between
"
up
to
1g
"
and
actually
guarantee
1g
.
the
term
"
up
to
"
could
mean
anything
up
to
that
level
.
that
be
the
issue
that
we
be
try
to
deal
with
here
and
that
,
as
public
representative
,
we
be
try
to
navigate
.
we
be
quite
literally
reflect
back
to
NBI
what
we
be
hear
on
the
ground
from
countless
number
of
citizen
in
the
type
of
village
mention
,
who
be
deeply
frustrated
that
there
be
no
intervention
that
appear
to
be
serve
they
.
Mr.
Hendrick
be
tell
I
about
something
that
be
go
to
happen
in
the
future
,
the
future
be
now
as
far
as
that
people
be
concerned
.
the
pandemic
have
fast
-
track
remote
work
and
they
want
result
now
.
what
can
I
tell
the
people
of
Ballyhooly
arise
from
my
engagement
with
the
witness
today
that
would
give
they
some
hope
that
there
will
be
a
intervention
to
meet
they
need
and
they
will
get
a
service
?
thank
you
.
it
be
a
nice
segue
that
we
be
talk
about
the
reliance
on
external
advice
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Griffin
correctly
,
he
be
talk
about
25
consultant
assign
to
the
roll
-
out
of
the
national
broadband
plan
.
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
for
write
answer
on
19
January
of
this
year
ask
how
much
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
be
spend
on
external
consultancy
service
.
the
figure
I
get
back
be
€
14.3
million
,
of
which
€
10.1
million
,
approximately
,
be
be
spend
on
external
service
for
this
very
project
.
if
I
break
that
down
further
-
and
the
reply
be
a
matter
of
public
record
-
Analysys
Mason
receive
€
3.9
million
,
EY
business
advisory
service
receive
€
5.3
million
and
William
Fry
legal
advisory
service
receive
€
846000
.
that
add
up
to
approximately
€
10.1
million
.
be
it
possible
to
give
a
further
breakdown
of
the
spend
between
the
three
entity
I
have
just
mention
?
the
reason
I
ask
the
question
be
that
I
perceive
that
in
latter
year
government
Department
have
be
hollow
out
and
there
be
a
increase
dependency
on
external
advice
.
none
of
we
be
against
the
idea
of
external
advice
.
it
need
to
be
procure
if
and
when
a
certain
skill
set
or
a
specific
project
need
to
be
deliver
.
that
be
understand
.
however
,
€
10.1
million
seem
to
I
to
be
a
extraordinary
figure
.
what
be
EY
's
business
advisory
service
,
for
example
?
the
consultancy
,
the
PQ
reply
state
,
be
for
financial
and
commercial
advisory
service
,
but
it
amount
to
€
5.3
million
,
which
be
not
a
insignificant
amount
of
money
.
be
it
possible
to
provide
the
committee
with
a
further
breakdown
of
that
cost
in
term
of
,
to
use
the
vernacular
phrase
,
billable
hour
?
what
be
the
department
get
for
€
5.3
million
?
what
be
it
get
from
Analysys
Mason
for
€
3.9
million
and
what
be
it
get
from
William
Fry
for
€
846000
so
far
?
that
be
only
for
2021
.
it
would
be
very
useful
if
this
committee
have
a
further
understanding
of
just
how
much
money
be
be
spend
on
consultancy
service
,
not
only
for
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
-
official
from
that
Department
be
here
today
-
but
for
every
Department
of
State
,
for
that
matter
.
I
thank
Mr.
Griffin
.
I
have
only
four
minute
and
Mr.
Griffin
have
take
a
fair
chunk
of
time
.
I
be
conscious
he
want
to
develop
the
point
but
I
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.
I
appreciate
that
.
what
I
would
like
be
a
deep
understanding
of
the
breakdown
of
this
cost
.
we
need
that
for
every
single
line
department
that
rely
on
external
service
and
consultancy
.
I
be
not
sure
we
have
a
deep
understanding
of
that
.
certainly
,
I
speak
for
myself
in
that
regard
.
the
question
then
,
and
Mr.
Griffin
can
fold
this
all
into
the
reply
in
two
minute
,
be
do
I
take
it
from
he
reply
that
the
Department
will
continue
to
require
the
service
of
external
consultant
for
this
?
if
the
answer
to
that
be
"
yes
"
,
which
I
think
it
be
,
for
how
long
more
will
it
require
they
?
it
have
spend
€
10.1
million
so
far
.
what
do
Mr.
Griffin
anticipate
the
future
spend
will
be
on
external
service
for
the
lifetime
of
this
project
?
with
respect
,
I
have
a
very
short
time
available
to
I
.
I
think
we
all
appreciate
that
there
be
a
reliance
on
external
service
.
we
have
all
acknowledge
that
.
I
be
merely
ask
at
this
juncture
-
I
think
Mr.
Griffin
be
about
to
defer
to
he
colleague
on
the
matter
-
about
the
breakdown
of
cost
and
to
have
sight
of
the
breakdown
of
that
cost
.
if
I
could
come
away
in
the
short
time
I
have
with
some
understanding
of
that
and
a
commitment
that
the
Department
will
write
to
the
committee
in
that
regard
,
I
would
be
grateful
for
that
.
on
the
legal
side
-----
with
respect
,
Mr.
Mulligan
should
understand
that
we
be
at
the
front
line
in
understand
people
's
need
.
we
be
the
people
who
run
constituency
office
.
we
understand
full
well
the
significance
of
the
nbp
.
we
also
understand
the
deficit
which
exist
in
respect
of
the
provision
of
the
broadband
service
.
I
think
that
be
self
-
evident
,
and
I
do
not
think
we
need
to
be
remind
of
it
.
I
be
,
however
,
concerned
about
the
standard
of
reply
that
my
office
receive
when
contact
be
make
via
the
dedicated
email
address
for
representation
to
NBI
.
I
would
like
to
see
a
great
degree
of
transparency
regard
the
number
of
representation
make
through
that
email
channel
and
how
many
of
that
representation
from
the
office
of
Deputy
and
Senator
be
actually
resolve
.
I
refer
to
a
broadband
connection
ultimately
be
make
.
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
and
whatever
about
the
commercial
consideration
and
the
cost
,
the
fact
remain
that
a
expectation
be
create
that
a
service
would
be
roll
out
.
the
advent
of
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
have
increase
or
fast
-
track
that
expectation
.
I
think
we
would
all
agree
on
that
point
.
therefore
,
a
demand
and
a
expectation
exist
for
this
service
,
which
I
think
be
a
legitimate
one
.
I
refer
to
people
in
particular
circumstance
of
which
we
be
all
aware
,
whether
down
dale
or
up
glen
,
where
there
be
a
expectation
of
be
able
to
work
remotely
.
sometimes
there
be
a
perception
that
people
in
rural
Ireland
have
particular
type
of
job
and
fulfil
particular
type
of
function
.
I
want
to
remind
everyone
that
the
people
in
rural
Ireland
be
the
people
with
phd
,
mba
,
master
,
and
they
be
work
remotely
across
pharma
and
academia
,
and
that
need
to
be
understand
.
they
need
the
access
;
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
they
be
professional
people
live
in
this
community
and
they
have
a
legitimate
expectation
.
if
there
be
one
thing
arise
from
today
it
be
that
the
quality
of
engagement
with
Oireachtas
Member
should
improve
such
that
we
can
expect
legitimately
that
,
when
we
make
representation
on
behalf
of
this
very
people
whom
I
be
talk
about
and
there
be
some
sort
of
priority
give
to
that
.
very
often
we
be
the
door
of
last
resort
for
this
people
because
they
have
try
every
other
option
,
give
they
be
more
than
capable
of
engage
with
the
commercial
provider
themselves
and
they
have
do
so
,
but
they
be
come
to
we
because
they
have
no
other
place
to
go
.
they
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
we
that
we
would
interface
with
representative
at
Nbi.ie
and
they
would
then
expect
,
and
we
would
expect
,
that
we
would
receive
some
sort
of
a
return
,
and
a
deliverable
.
the
deliverable
in
this
case
be
a
connection
ultimately
.
that
be
why
I
be
concerned
by
the
amber
map
from
day
one
.
I
do
not
profess
to
be
a
expert
in
;
I
be
a
layman
in
all
of
this
,
not
a
financial
wizard
.
I
have
no
technical
knowledge
in
respect
of
network
or
telephony
,
but
I
do
know
what
the
need
of
my
constituent
be
.
I
do
not
see
how
,
in
this
day
and
age
,
there
be
not
some
blend
of
service
that
could
be
provide
that
be
a
solution
for
each
household
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
that
be
insurmountable
by
way
of
a
solution
for
every
household
give
the
paradigm
shift
that
have
take
place
.
that
be
where
people
like
be
come
from
,
quite
simply
.
we
need
to
get
information
back
to
this
committee
in
respect
of
how
many
representation
have
be
receive
by
Oireachtas
Member
and
how
many
of
that
have
be
resolve
whereby
a
connection
be
make
.
we
need
some
qualitative
and
quantitative
analysis
of
that
representation
in
term
of
whether
they
be
succeed
through
we
intervention
.
my
second
point
relate
to
the
bcp
.
how
many
bcp
be
up
and
run
and
live
as
we
speak
?
what
I
raise
with
NBI
be
a
outworking
of
this
very
issue
.
I
would
like
Mr.
Griffin
to
go
away
from
this
meeting
understanding
that
there
be
a
little
village
in
north
County
Cork
call
Ballyhooly
,
and
I
deliberately
use
the
example
of
Ballyhooly
because
he
will
remember
that
name
.
there
be
a
new
estate
in
Ballyhooly
call
Lios
Ard
,
people
by
the
professional
I
be
talk
about
from
all
walk
of
life
,
and
one
half
of
the
village
can
get
broadband
and
the
half
other
cannot
.
this
be
why
I
be
frustrate
by
this
amber
mapping
.
we
all
buy
into
it
and
now
it
seem
that
this
amber
map
have
become
such
a
arbitrary
tool
that
we
be
go
to
end
up
with
a
situation
where
there
will
be
that
people
who
will
have
and
that
who
will
not
all
because
of
a
mapping
exercise
,
ultimately
.
I
do
not
know
what
can
be
do
about
that
.
the
question
be
:
what
can
I
tell
the
people
in
Lios
Ard
,
Ballyhooly
,
tomorrow
morning
?
they
be
representative
of
thousand
of
people
throughout
this
State
.
what
hope
can
I
give
they
tomorrow
morning
that
they
be
go
to
be
guarantee
a
connection
?
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
that
be
ultimately
what
people
want
to
hear
.
like
my
colleague
,
deputy
O'Connor
,
we
will
be
have
a
chat
after
this
meeting
.
I
thank
Mr.
Griffin
for
that
clarification
.
sometimes
in
the
back
and
forth
,
in
particular
in
this
hybrid
situation
,
it
can
be
a
little
difficult
for
both
member
and
witness
to
get
they
point
across
and
there
can
sometimes
be
a
communication
breakdown
.
I

Expenditure
and
Reform

join

the

be

adjourn
until
9.30
a.m.
on
Thursday
,
17
February
,
when
we
will
engage
with
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
.
I
will
follow
on
from
my
colleague
,
deputy
Dillon
,
regard
the
inspection
regime
.
I
understand
there
be
a
set
of
regulation
go
back
to
2019
relate
to
standard
in
private
rent
accommodation
,
which
be
very
clearly
delineat
.
I
be
strike
by
the
fact
,
notwithstand
Covid
-
19
and
the
inability
of
people
to
inspect
private
rent
accommodation
that
be
subject
to
housing
assistance
payment
,
or
even
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
as
we
use
to
know
it
,
of
the
dramatic
drop
-
off
in
the
number
of
inspection
take
place
.
the
minister
's
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
pose
on
25
January
clearly
show
that
up
to
quarter
3
of
2021
,
11731
inspection
take
place
.
that
be
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
I
have
.
there
may
have
be
a
advance
on
that
since
then
.
it
be
2021
.
we
be
factor
in
Covid
-
19
.
we
know
there
will
be
a
drop
-
off
so
the
official
do
not
need
to
respond
to
that
.
that
be
a
give
and
that
be
understand
,
but
the
number
of
prohibition
notice
that
have
be
serve
out
of
that
inspection
be
15
.
even
if
we
track
back
,
take
into
account
Covid
-
19
,
in
2018
,
approximately
28000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
99
prohibition
notice
serve
.
in
2019
,
40000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
106
notice
serve
.
in
2020
,
approximately
26000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
57
notice
serve
and
,
as
I
say
,
there
be
11700
inspection
up
to
quarter
3
of
2021
with
15
notice
serve
.
do
the
official
agree
that
the
number
of
prohibition
notice
serve
be
extremely
low
?
I
ask
that
because
I
have
visit
people
of
late
who
be
in
receipt
of
the
housing
assistance
payment
.
to
describe
the
condition
they
be
live
in
as
Dickensian
would
be
to
put
it
mildly
.
I
understand
the
local
authority
have
a
tough
job
to
do
,
but
I
would
like
to
see
some
language
come
from
the
Department
in
respect
of
buttress
the
inspection
regime
by
way
of
ensure
there
be
a
clear
policy
that
the
regulation
,
which
be
lay
down
in
law
,
be
adhere
to
such
that
people
have
the
right
to
live
in
some
sort
of
decent
accommodation
.
I
invite
the
official
to
visit
some
of
this
dwelling
for
themselves
.
they
will
see
just
how
poor
the
level
of
accommodation
be
.
this
people
be
catch
in
a
major
bind
because
they
cannot
go
back
to
they
landlord
to
ask
he
or
she
to
fix
this
or
that
as
they
would
be
out
on
they
ear
before
they
know
it
.
this
be
a
major
issue
right
across
society
when
we
be
pay
€
465
million
on
the
housing
assistance
payment
.
we
should
look
at
the
rent
supplement
figure
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
2021
.
under
what
we
call
provisional
expenditure
under
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
2021
,
the
Department
of
social
Protection
pay
out
€
122957,0
in
rent
supplement
.
we
be
pay
out
a
massive
amount
of
money
.
I
can
understand
why
we
be
do
so
.
we
need
to
keep
people
in
housing
in
the
private
rent
sector
until
supply
be
sufficiently
provide
for
,
but
the
inspection
regime
be
just
not
work
.
I
ask
the
official
to
please
not
come
back
to
I
with
Covid
-
19
as
a
reason
.
a
regime
need
to
be
put
in
place
such
that
the
inspectorate
be
robust
and
local
authority
be
resource
commensurate
with
the
number
of
property
in
they
purview
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
urgently
.
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
have
give
we
the
metric
of
60000
tenancy
and
€
465
million
,
which
be
come
in
at
,
give
or
take
,
€
7,800
per
tenancy
.
obviously
,
there
have
be
no
provision
to
revise
upwards
the
rent
provision
to
reflect
the
market
in
2017
.
the
Secretary
General
will
tell
I
there
be
a
working
group
on
that
but
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
urgency
.
if
I
could
have
a
answer
to
that
in
two
minute
or
less
,
I
would
be
delighted
because
there
be
one
other
issue
I
would
like
to
cover
as
well
.
to
be
very
clear
so
there
be
no
ambiguity
,
what
I
actually
say
be
that
there
need
to
be
great
resourcing
of
the
local
authority
to
provide
for
personnel
to
carry
out
the
inspection
.
that
be
the
key
point
.
the
question
be
:
will
additional
resource
be
provide
to
local
authority
to
carry
out
more
inspection
?
it
be
on
the
Department
's
agenda
as
a
priority
.
I
thank
Ms
Timmons
.
I
appreciate
the
answer
.
with
regard
to
water
service
,
as
a
typical
deputy
try
to
get
scheme
up
off
the
ground
in
regard
to
wastewater
treatment
plant
and
sewage
treatment
plant
,
and
generally
improve
the
condition
of
service
,
in
particular
water
service
,
I
recognise
that
some
very
good
project
be
under
way
right
across
the
country
under
the
ambit
of
Irish
Water
.
however
,
I
be
try
to
understand
what
be
the
dynamic
that
be
inform
the
relationship
between
Irish
Water
and
the
local
authority
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
service
level
agreement
that
be
in
place
between
the
two
entity
will
be
set
aside
,
such
that
all
staff
be
now
to
transfer
across
to
Irish
Water
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
what
be
the
status
of
that
process
?
that
be
the
first
question
.
the
second
question
relate
to
whether
a
scheme
will
be
provide
where
there
be
small
settlement
or
village
where
the
local
authority
be
ready
to
go
on
a
project
,
but
it
be
not
necessarily
on
a
priority
list
for
Irish
Water
.
be
there
scope
for
the
Department
to
step
in
to
provide
funding
for
local
authority
for
small
scheme
that
be
shovel
-
ready
and
that
could
get
off
the
ground
?
it
would
have
tremendous
impact
.
if
we
do
not
have
that
type
of
scheme
,
people
be
subject
to
a
Irish
Water
list
and
they
could
be
wait
until
kingdom
come
to
get
they
little
village
or
settlement
sort
out
.
will
the
Department
devise
a
new
scheme
for
small
settlement
and
village
where
project
be
shovel
-
ready
and
where
the
local
authority
say
it
be
ready
to
go
and
would
like
to
bid
for
a
scheme
that
might
be
devise
?
we
will
request
the
secretariat
to
issue
that
correspondence
as
a
matter
of
priority
to
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
HSE
in
respect
of
the
matter
raise
.
we
will
see
what
come
back
and
we
will
make
a
final
decision
next
week
regard
24
March
.
on
31
March
,
we
will
commence
a
series
of
justice
-
related
meeting
.
the
secretariat
have
establish
availability
as
follow
:
a
Garda
Síochána
on
31
March
and
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
on
7
April
.
we
discuss
engage
with
the
Policing
Authority
as
well
,
so
I
propose
that
the
secretariat
seek
to
schedule
the
Policing
Authority
on
the
afternoon
of
31
March
,
the
same
date
on
which
we
will
be
engage
with
a
Garda
Síochána
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
alternatively
,
we
could
schedule
it
for
7
April
.
there
be
then
two
non-sitting
week
schedule
for
Easter
which
mean
the
next
meeting
will
be
on
28
April
,
with
the
Department
of
Justice
.
there
will
be
a
run
of
justice
issue
together
.
we
will
then
look
to
engage
with
the
Department
of
Finance
,
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
and
the
University
of
Limerick
.
I
know
the
committee
be
anxious
to
get
the
university
back
before
we
.
fairly
early
on
,
we
may
look
to
ascertain
the
availability
of
the
chancellor
.
we
should
do
that
in
good
time
.
be
it
agree
that
the
secretariat
will
work
to
make
this
arrangement
?
agree
.
be
there
any
other
matter
member
wish
to
raise
relate
to
the
work
programme
?
that
conclude
consideration
of
the
work
programme
for
today
.
the
last
item
be
any
other
business
.
apology
be
receive
from
deputy
Verona
Murphy
.
unfortunately
,
she
have
a
bereavement
in
the
family
.
I
convey
the
condolence
of
the
committee
and
the
staff
to
Verona
on
the
loss
of
she
mother
.
I
know
she
have
be
ill
in
recent
week
.
we
pass
on
we
sympathy
to
Verona
.
the
meeting
be
adjourn
until
24
February
,
when
we
will
engage
with
the
residential
Tenancy
board
on
its
2020
financial
statement
.
we
will
request
the
secretariat
to
issue
that
correspondence
as
a
matter
of
priority
to
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
HSE
in
respect
of
the
matter
raise
.
we

to

in

national

its

with

,
be
Mr.

aware

the
report
commission
by
the
Parliamentary

?
Mr.

will
be
aware
that
the
report
state
,
''
the
programming
of
expenditure
under
the
Health
vote
be
another
priority
of
future
Health
and
alig
the
programme
of
vote
38
with
the
HSE
's
internal
allocation
would
make
the
relationship
between
what
the
Oireachtas
approve
and
what
be
spend
on
the
ground
more
direct
.
''
the
key
word
there
be
''
what
the
Oireachtas
approve
''
.
we
be
elect
by
the
people
and
we
approve
the
expenditure
,
and
the
HSE
spend
the
money
and
have
that
relationship
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
line
minister
of
the
day
.
ultimately
,
there
be
a
accountability
mechanism
here
.
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
hold
a
constitutional
position
.
if
he
be
make
reference
in
he
open
remark
to
that
specific
report
,
that
report
have
to
be
take
seriously
by
the
HSE
.
it
be
important
.
let
we
not
make
light
of
it
.
it
be
a
vital
transparency
mechanism
.
on
the
accountability
mechanism
,
consider
what
happen
when
a
mere
mortal
like
I
,
who
represent
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
submit
a
parliamentary
question
on
CAMHS
,
as
I
do
in
January
when
I
seek
information
on
the
number
of
person
wait
to
be
see
by
CAMHS
by
local
health
office
,
in
tabular
form
,
and
the
length
of
time
person
be
wait
to
be
see
.
it
be
a
very
simple
question
and
the
response
I
get
be
comprehensive
,
which
be
to
the
credit
of
Mr.
Ryan
.
the
response
be
that
the
total
number
of
person
wait
for
CAMHS
nationally
be
3,357
.
when
I
submit
a
further
parliamentary
question
,
ask
for
a
breakdown
of
service
provide
by
CAMHS
,
specifically
the
number
present
to
CAMHS
who
be
wait
for
psychology
service
,
the
reply
,
which
be
from
Mr.
O'Regan
,
the
head
of
operation
,
give
a
universal
figure
of
9554
for
psychology
service
alone
.
if
I
break
it
down
further
in
relation
to
CHO
4
,
the
CHO
I
be
most
familiar
with
,
I
get
a
total
of
682
people
wait
.
for
psychology
service
,
I
get
a
figure
of
approximately
3000
for
CHO
4
.
what
be
deeply
frustrating
for
we
in
represent
family
and
child
await
appointment
or
try
to
get
into
the
system
of
CAMHS
be
that
it
be
very
hard
to
get
accurate
information
in
real
time
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
when
we
table
parliamentary
question
,
it
be
very
hard
to
give
family
real
-
time
information
base
on
they
child
's
need
and
they
expectation
.
I
have
no
criticism
whatsoever
of
the
individual
who
work
in
CAMHS
,
who
be
try
to
do
they
good
and
work
through
all
the
need
of
family
daily
,
but
Mr.
Reid
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
serious
issue
in
respect
of
CAMHS
and
he
dataset
in
respect
of
interrogate
figure
in
that
regard
.
it
be
Kafkaesque
that
system
within
the
HSE
organisation
be
not
talk
to
each
other
properly
.
if
Mr.
Reid
cannot
even
come
up
with
proper
figure
for
I
when
there
be
glaring
contradiction
,
how
can
we
expect
to
have
confidence
in
he
approach
?
in
fairness
to
he
,
he
have
take
a
national
lead
on
the
Covid
pandemic
,
but
we
want
he
to
devote
the
same
energy
to
deal
with
CAMHS
,
its
management
and
,
ultimately
,
the
delivery
of
service
to
family
.
we
remain
to
be
convince
that
appropriate
resource
be
be
deploy
.
from
Mr.
Reid
's
level
of
management
down
,
more
need
to
be
do
.
how
do
he
answer
this
critique
-
I
do
not
call
it
a
criticism
-
of
how
we
as
politician
interface
with
the
service
?
I
accept
the
response
and
the
distinction
Ms
O'Connor
be
make
,
but
the
universal
and
most
important
point
be
that
we
still
have
3000
child
wait
.
what
be
the
current
status
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
?
do
Ms
O'Connor
consider
they
to
be
work
?
be
Ms
O'Connor
aware
that
parent
be
come
to
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
say
they
feel
like
they
be
now
go
through
another
process
of
incessant
form
-
fill
and
that
the
service
be
move
further
and
further
away
from
they
?
again
,
it
be
almost
Kafkaesque
that
they
be
in
this
vortex
of
constant
form
-
fill
.
they
feel
extremely
frustrated
.
can
Ms
O'Connor
sympathise
and
empathise
with
they
experience
of
child
's
disability
network
team
so
far
?
absolutely
.
I
be
not
a
specialist
in
this
field
so
I
rely
on
the
information
be
impart
to
I
by
the
HSE
.
would
person
-
to
-
person
intervention
not
have
be
the
starting
point
anyway
as
oppose
to
send
people
into
a
assessment
process
that
some
family
describe
as
nightmarish
?
I
be
go
to
leave
it
at
that
because
I
have
three
minute
leave
in
my
slot
.
I
ask
we
guest
to
have
regard
to
that
and
to
be
conscious
of
the
point
we
be
make
as
we
reflect
they
for
we
constituent
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
Owenacurra
Centre
?
I
be
tell
it
be
a
approve
centre
.
will
we
guest
explain
what
,
in
HSE
speak
,
a
"
approve
centre
"
be
?
the
Mental
Health
Commission
be
clear
in
its
definition
.
it
state
a
approve
centre
be
intend
"
to
provide
in
-
patient
treatment
to
people
suffer
from
mental
illness
.
the
MHC
maintain
a
register
of
all
approve
centre
.
"
the
chief
executive
state
the
HSE
be
go
to
move
to
close
the
Owenacurra
Centre
.
will
Mr.
Reid
reconsider
that
position
?
I
be
not
convinced
,
and
I
imagine
I
speak
comfortably
for
all
the
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
who
represent
the
Cork
East
constituency
,
there
be
a
proper
,
fit
-
for
-
purpose
local
alternative
solution
to
respond
to
the
centre
's
closure
.
Mr.
Reid
make
reference
in
he
open
remark
to
Glenwood
,
but
from
what
I
can
see
in
the
planning
application
,
that
be
not
to
be
designate
as
a
approve
centre
.
in
fact
,
there
be
no
mention
of
the
fact
it
would
become
a
approve
centre
.
right
now
,
there
be
11
people
who
do
not
know
where
they
be
suppose
to
go
,
yet
they
have
express
a
clear
will
and
preference
.
Mr.
Reid
use
the
expression
"
will
and
preference
"
.
I
would
contend
that
as
long
as
they
continue
to
express
a
will
and
preference
to
stay
at
the
Owenacurra
Centre
,
they
should
be
allow
to
do
so
for
as
long
as
be
necessary
,
in
accordance
with
they
will
and
preference
.
I
do
not
believe
we
guest
have
present
to
we
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
and
local
alternative
for
they
.
send
they
30
kilometer
up
the
road
be
not
a
solution
.
that
be
not
how
we
treat
people
in
this
day
and
age
.
if
they
continue
to
express
a
will
and
preference
not
to
move
,
that
must
be
respect
.
furthermore
,
the
money
the
HSE
have
spend
on
improve
the
Owenacurra
Centre
have
to
be
take
into
account
.
I
understand
more
than
€
359000
have
be
spend
there
since
2016
.
there
be
no
alternative
for
the
resident
at
present
.
we
guest
have
present
the
Carrigaline
centre
as
a
alternative
,
but
it
be
not
a
approve
centre
.
the
resident
-
11
soul
-
be
almost
be
cast
out
.
I
ask
Mr.
Reid
to
please
reconsider
and
to
have
a
bit
of
heart
in
respect
of
this
people
.
we
cannot
compel
it
to
come
because
it
be
not
accountable
to
the
committee
of
Public
Account
.
the
request
can
be
make
.
that
can
be
do
but
,
certainly
,
there
can
be
no
means
of
compelling
its
representative
to
attend
because
it
be
a
private
company
.
once
upon
a
time
,
it
be
a
semi-State
but
even
commercial
semi-State
be
not
compel
,
although
if
that
be
the
case
,
there
would
be
a
great
level
of
expectation
that
it
would
attend
.
at
this
stage
,
however
,
Eir
have
be
a
private
company
since
1999
.
I
suggest
,
to
be
fair
to
deputy
Dillon
,
that
we
put
it
off
until
the
next
meeting
of
the
committee
and
we
deal
with
it
then
,
finally
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
I
do
not
want
to
defer
it
any
long
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
the
next
item
on

Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
Finance
.
we
will
leave
that
with
the
secretariat
and
ask
it
to
get
date
that
be
suitable
for
all
involve
and
that
fit
in
with
we
work
programme
.
be
there
any
other
matter
member
wish
to
raise
regard
the
work
programme
?
if
not
,
that
conclude
we
consideration
of
the
work
programme
for
today
.
the
final
item
be
any
other
business
.
do
any
member
wish
to
raise
any
other
matter
?
no
.
the
committee
will
now
go
into
private
session
before
adjourn
until
24
March
2022
,
when
it
will
engage
with
the
Sustainable
Energy
Authority
of
Ireland
regard
its
2020
financial
statement
.
I
welcome
the
witness
and
acknowledge
the
presence
of
we
former
colleague
,
Mary
Harney
.
she
be
very
welcome
.
any
dealing
I
have
have
with
she
have
always
be
honourable
,
honest
and
straightforward
.
although
very
rarely
have
I
agree
with
she
from
a
politically
ideological
position
,
I
have
to
say
that
my
dealing
with
she
have
always
be
honest
,
straightforward
and
forthright
.
could
I
focus
on
the
funding
position
in
respect
of
the
hea
?
base
on
correspondence
we
have
receive
,
we
be
give
to
understand
that
core
funding
amount
to
€
1.7
million
have
be
withheld
to
date
.
be
that
the
current
position
?
so
contrary
to
media
report
,
no
further
money
have
be
withheld
.
the
reason
I
be
ask
Professor
Mey
this
question
be
because
right
now
,
the
educational
landscape
within
the
State
be
such
that
there
be
employee
of
university
or
technological
university
on
precarious
contract
.
to
my
knowledge
,
there
be
not
enough
people
in
proper
career
progression
.
many
lecturer
be
still
below
the
bar
and
be
go
from
contract
to
contract
.
I
speak
for
staff
within
the
University
of
Limerick
.
it
seem
to
I
that
if
there
be
a
withdrawal
or
hold
back
of
funding
,
it
stymy
the
ability
of
the
university
to
fulfill
its
mission
and
obligation
to
its
own
staff
but
also
its
wide
mission
to
the
mid-
and
Munster
region
.
I
say
this
as
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
work
of
EPI
-
STEM
,
Lero
and
other
such
entity
and
the
translational
effect
of
the
research
provide
by
the
University
of
Limerick
.
I
worry
that
if
the
HEA
be
withhold
funding
,
it
will
have
a
downstream
effect
on
the
university
's
ability
to
allow
staff
to
progress
from
below
the
bar
to
above
the
bar
position
or
to
allow
the
university
to
ensure
that
people
progress
and
that
there
be
a
career
path
for
employee
within
the
university
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
hold
back
of
this
funding
be
affect
staff
's
ability
to
progress
?
why
have
this
money
be
pause
?
what
reason
be
give
in
that
conversation
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
and
the
president
?
move
on
then
to
what
be
reasonably
modest
but
significant
sum
nonetheless
in
respect
of
what
have
be
spend
on
external
consultancy
cost
and
adviser
fee
,
the
university
spend
nearly
€
600,000
on
project
management
service
,
total
legal
expenditure
be
€
926000
,
estate
planning
be
€
250000
,
brand
refresh
and
implementation
be
€
87000
,
and
public
relation
be
€
33000
.
this
be
all
money
that
have
be
spend
on
external
service
.
will
the
president
tell
I
why
the
university
spend
€
595000
on
project
management
service
and
what
be
this
service
?
that
be
my
first
question
for
she
.
also
,
in
respect
of
the
brand
refresh
and
implementation
,
€
87000
would
pay
the
fee
for
one
lecturer
above
the
bar
,
if
I
can
put
it
that
way
.
my
focus
here
be
on
staff
and
student
,
on
what
they
be
receive
and
on
what
I
would
call
they
rights
and
entitlement
.
it
seem
to
I
the
amount
of
money
,
which
be
approximately
€
3.1
million
and
be
a
significant
amount
,
be
all
money
that
have
be
in
spend
on
external
service
that
could
reasonably
have
be
expect
to
be
plough
into
invest
in
staff
,
educational
output
,
and
research
output
.
will
the
president
speak
specifically
to
the
legal
expenditure
,
because
this
be
by
far
the
great
amount
at
€
926000
?
in
2019
,
the
university
spend
€
1.04
million
on
legal
expenditure
alone
.
it
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
on
legal
fee
.
that
be
fine

Murphy

the

's
reply
have
be
hear
many
time
before
.
he
do
not
answer
the
question
as
I
pose
it
and
as
it
pertain
to
the
Greencore
site
specifically
.
although
he
meet
the
Taoiseach
and
other
in
March
2006
,
much
progress
have
be
make
since
,
in
so
far
as
a
special
local
area
plan
have
be
adopt
for
Mallow
.
I
be
glad
to
participate
in
draw
up
the
plan
,
in
which
we
designate
30
acre
within
the
site
to
be
use
as
a
high
environmental
,
quality
enterprise
and
employment
zone
.
the
question
on
everyone
's
lip
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
be
whether
a
enterprise
will
be
locate
on
the
site
.
the
north
Cork
and
wide
east
Cork
region
have
be
deal
a
savage
blow
in
term
of
job
loss
and
the
people
of
Mallow
have
high
expectation
for
the
site
.
the
minister
should
state
whether
there
be
a
specific
proposal
because
before
the
general
election
a
government
backbencher
make
a
announcement
to
the
effect
that
a
American
company
would
make
a
announcement
on
job
creation
.
be
the
minister
aware
of
this
so
-
call
announcement
?
if
such
negotiation
take
place
,
do
they
bear
fruit
?
as
for
the
government
's
support
for
the
worker
when
the
redundancy
argument
be
ongoing
,
it
wash
its
hand
of
the
issue
.
be
it
not
for
the
intervention
of
Mallow
Town
Council
and
the
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
I
believe
strongly
they
would
not
have
receive
they
redundancy
payment
.
a
statement
be
make
by
a
government
backbencher
prior
to
the
election
to
the
effect
that
a
announcement
on
job
creation
at
that
site
be
imminent
.
the
minister
have
not
answer
this
question
adequately
.
the
people
of
Mallow
would
like
to
know
whether
the
job
be
come
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
they
be
indeed
.
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
to
discuss
the
follow
urgent
matter
:
the
proposal
under
the
national
cancer
strategy
to
close
13
cancer
service
locate
throughout
the
country
,
particularly
breast
cancer
service
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
there
be
two
aspect
to
the
question
put
down
by
the
deputy
.
the
first
relate
to
siltation
at
the
harbour
and
in
this
regard
a
dumping
at
Sea
Permit
be
issue
to
the
council
on
22
December
2006
to
facilitate
maintenance
dredging
.
the
second
aspect
relate
to
the
draft
and
acceptance
by
the
relevant
party
of
a
lease
in
respect
of
the
propose
breakwater
at
Buncrana
.
the
council
request
a
reduction
or
total
waiver
of
foreshore
charge
on
the
basis
that
the
facility
be
to
be
use
by
the
RNLI
.
follow
extensive
discussion
and
as
a
exceptional
matter
,
the
Department
,
with
the
agreement
of
the
Department
of
Finance
,
inform
the
council
that
it
would
consider
waive
the
rental
charge
if
the
council
could
confirm
that
the
propose
facility
would
be
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
RNLI
.
in
addition
,
the
council
be
also
inform
that
if
it
be
unable
to
confirm
that
the
facility
would
be
use
exclusively
by
the
RNLI
,
the
Department
be
prepare
to
apply
a
reduce
rental
charge
base
on
the
ratio
of
usage
of
the
facility
by
the
RNLI
.
on
20th
December
last
the
council
confirm
that
the
work
be
propose
at
Buncrana
Harbour
be
be
construct
solely
for
the
use
of
the
RNLI
and
be
not
be
construct
for
the
benefit
of
any
other
party
.
on
foot
of
this
confirmation
the
Department
enter
into
detailed
discussion
and
correspondence
with
the
Chief
State
Solicitor
's
Office
with
a
view
to
prepare
a
appropriate
draft
lease
,
which
will
well
facilitate
the
council
's
proposal
and
also
safeguard
the
State
's
ongoing
interest
in
the
management
and
protection
of
the
foreshore
in
the
public
interest
.
the
draft
lease
will
involve
the
insertion
of
specific
condition
,
which
will
reflect
the
fact
that
the
arrangement
involve
be
unusual
and
be
base
on
the
need
to
provide
a
permanent
location
for
the
RNLI
,
which
will
enable
the
launch
of
they
boat
on
a
24
-
hour
basis
.
the
Department
's
discussion
with
the
Chief
State
Solicitor
's
Office
have
focus
on
the
public
interest
provision
of
the
Foreshore
Act
,
the
propose
arrangement
which
the
Council
will
need
to
make
with
the
RNLI
and
other
legal
issue
design
to
protect
the
interest
of
all
party
.
the
lease
,
when
draft
,
will
require
the
agreement
of
all
relevant
party
.
every
effort
be
be
make
to
expedite
the
completion
of
the
draft
lease
and
,
to
that
end
,
a
further
meeting
have
be
schedule
between
my
Department
and
the
County
Council
to
further
clarify
outstanding
issue
.
I
raise
this
question
in
the
context
that
Ireland
have
up
to
€
8.1
billion
in
food
export
on
a
annual
basis
.
recently
we
see
that
approximately
1.3
million
tonne
of
pigmeat
be
import
from
outside
the
EU
into
Ireland
and
then
brand
and
package
here
.
my
question
be
base
on
the
fact
that
Irish
pig
producer
be
rapidly
go
into
decline
because
long
-
establish
brand
be
be
market
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
impression
that
they
use
Irish
pig
meat
.
the
European
Union
be
currently
review
the
condition
and
I
understand
the
issue
may
be
only
within
the
competence
of
the
Union
.
however
,
the
government
have
a
certain
responsibility
in
the
issue
.
if
there
be
no
provision
in
we
law
to
amend
legislation
,
I
call
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
labelling
,
through
marketing
and
Bord
Bia
,
be
do
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
that
where
a
consumer
purchase
a
product
perceive
to
be
Irish
,
a
clear
label
be
attach
to
the
product
attest
to
that
fact
.
this
have
serious
implication
for
pig
producer
and
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
clarify
whether
the
government
be
make
provision
in
that
regard
.
be
the
minister
aware
that
Galtee
Foods
in
Mitchelstown
,
a
company
that
have
sustain
people
in
the
area
for
many
year
,
recently
close
?
one
of
the
main
reason
be
the
clear
perception
among
consumer
that
,
though
its
product
be
brand
as
Irish
,
they
be
import
and
the
Galtee
brand
have
diminish
in
stature
as
a
result
.
it
be
a
result
of
a
certain
degree
of
government
intransigence
on
the
issue
that
we
now
see
the
demise
of
a
traditional
company
and
the
government
need
to
do
more
to
ensure
the
industry
,
which
have
sustain
many
farming
family
for
a
long
time
,
be
support
.
I
preface
my
question
by
state
the
strong
belief
within
my
party
that
the
loss
of
a
industry
that
sustain
many
farm
family
and
industrial
worker
throughout
the
land
for
generation
be
a
travesty
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
Indecon
report
,
on
which
the
government
base
its
recommendation
,
be
incorrect
.
the
government
,
therefore
,
cost
taxpayer
untold
sum
of
money
and
put
they
through
the
process
of
go
to
the
high
court
which
subsequently
reverse
the
decision
.
it
be
utterly
needless
and
a
waste
of
taxpayer
's
money
.
will
the
minister
respond
on
that
issue
?
the
fundamental
question
be
when
the
restructuring
package
will
be
introduce
and
the
grower
pay
.
what
level
of
consultation
have
there
be
with
grower
on
the
issue
?
have
there
be
final
and
full
agreement
on
the
matter
?
the
Indecon
report
be
important
.
I
want
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
the
Indecon
report
cost
the
taxpayer
,
how
much
it
cost
to
go
to
the
high
Court
.
the
issue
here
concern
the
public
purse
and
how
money
be
expend
on
behalf
of
taxpayer
.
can
the
minister
guarantee
that
Greencore
will
not
challenge
this
decision
which
,
although
it
have
be
take
at
a
political
level
,
have
yet
to
go
through
the
board
of
Greencore
?
it
should
be
state
that
the
minister
be
a
shareholder
or
have
a
golden
share
in
that
company
.
we
have
hear
the
quintessential
civil
servant
's
answer
.
every
farmer
take
responsibility
for
ragwort
or
any
noxious
weed
.
nevertheless
,
it
exist
extensively
throughout
the
country
.
one
can
have
all
the
public
awareness
and
information
campaign
in
the
world
,
but
action
be
need
.
would
the
minister
consider
fund
local
authority
to
ensure
this
blight
be
wipe
out
,
particularly
on
roadside
verge
?
farmer
and
landowner
take
responsibility
for
noxious
week
when
they
occur
on
they
land
.
I
take
the
view
that
the
glass
be
half
full
but
there
be
a
trend
in
Irish
agriculture
of
flight
from
the
land
.
this
be
largely
due
to
global
trend
.
the
WTO
be
influence
mainly
by
global
corporation
and
that
have
a
effect
on
small
Irish
family
farm
.
will
the
minister
bear
that
in
mind
when
she
attend
WTO
talk
or
Council
of
Minister
's
meeting
?
the
information

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
to
discuss
the
follow
urgent
matter
of
public
interest
:
the
serious
economic
and
employment
implication
for
the
Cork
East
constituency
and
Cork
in
general
follow
the
announcement
that
the
Amgen
project
which
be
to
deliver
more
than
1000
job
be
not
to
proceed
,
the
need
for
the
Minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
to
outline
the
background
to
the
decision
and
the
step
he
intend
to
take
to
ensure
the
project
proceed
or
be
replace
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
considerable
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
have
be
expend
on
attract
this
industry
to
Cork
East
and
the
people
of
the
region
—
—
—
—
want
to
know
exactly
how
much
be
spend
.
we
be
seek
to
bring
the
minister
before
the
House
so
that
we
can
have
a
opportunity
to
ask
he
that
relevant
question
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
the
announcement
by
Amgen
have
come
as
a
body
-
blow
to
the
east
Cork
region
.
the
economic
loss
to
Carrigtwohill
and
surround
area
be
unquantifiable
.
I
empathise
with
that
people
who
have
lose
they
job
in
the
company
.
while
global
corporate
entity
like
Amgen
be
subject
to
the
vagary
of
international
market
,
the
people
of
the
region
accept
in
good
faith
statement
make
by
the
company
in
April
that
a
delay
of
two
year
in
the
project
would
not
amount
to
a
complete
cessation
of
it
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
a
second
announcement
yesterday
to
the
effect
that
the
project
be
indefinitely
postpone
be
nothing
more
than
spin
and
a
deliberate
attempt
to
play
down
the
decision
not
to
proceed
.
anyone
with
common
sense
must
conclude
that
two
postponement
in
six
month
be
tantamount
to
a
cessation
.
the
government
have
serious
question
to
answer
.
question
arise
as
to
whether
Amgen
or
IDA
Ireland
be
the
beneficial
owner
of
the
site
at
which
the
project
be
to
proceed
.
we
must
also
ask
what
will
happen
to
the
site
in
the
event
of
a
further
postponement
or
acknowledgement
of
cessation
.
the
project
be
to
be
the
mainstay
of
the
region
and
Middleton
,
Youghal
and
other
centre
of
population
have
place
they
bet
on
it
.
many
young
people
invest
in
housing
in
the
region
on
foot
of
the
promise
of
foreign
direct
investment
by
Amgen
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
we
have
be
deal
a
hammer
blow
and
that
people
be
extremely
disappointed
.
expectation
in
this
context
have
not
be
manage
well
by
the
government
,
which
now
have
a
serious
case
to
answer
.
the
minister
have
a
responsibility
to
deliver
to
the
people
of
the
region

I
allow
to
make
a
point

on

congratulation

with

Ferris
and
Mary
Upton
.
if
Deputy
Doyle
and
Connaughton
be
sell
that
calve
,
they
might
give
I
a
shout
because
I
be
think
of
increase
my
herd
by
200
%
.
I
speak
in
support
of
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
between
2005
and
2006
,
the
agrifood
sector
account
for
163400
job
,
or
8.1
%
of
the
working
population
.
Irish
agrifood
export
account
for
more
than
€
8
billion
.
as
a
country
we
discount
the
importance
of
this
sector
of
the
economy
at
we
peril
.
at
a
time
when
increase
consolidation
of
the
agrifood
sector
be
drive
the
market
,
we
must
not
forget
the
importance
of
ensure
that
consumer
interest
be
maintain
.
we
must
also
continue
to
ensure
that
the
protection
of
consumer
health
lie
at
the
core
of
agriculture
and
food
policy
.
in
recent
time
,
the
standard
set
for
Irish
farmer
in
the
production
of
beef
and
pig
meat
be
not
be
subscribe
to
by
producer
from
third
country
who
have
access
to
Irish
and
European
market
.
in
essence
,
Irish
farmer
be
be
ask
to
ensure
that
they
produce
be
of
the
high
standard
before
go
to
market
while
they
counterpart
in
country
outside
the
European
Union
can
compete
on
a
uneven
playing
field
.
the
regulatory
framework
be
clearly
not
work
in
this
instance
.
the
EU
legislative
framework
,
as
it
stand
,
work
against
the
Irish
farm
family
and
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
be
compromise
as
a
result
.
more
important
,
the
health
of
the
Irish
consumer
be
compromise
if
there
be
so
much
as
the
slight
doubt
about
the
standard
of
produce
be
import
into
Irish
market
from
third
country
.
Brazilian
beef
be
a
case
in
point
.
Brazilian
producer
in
many
instance
produce
to
the
high
standard
but
there
be
legitimate
concern
about
the
traceability
and
production
method
of
some
Brazilian
beef
which
find
its
way
on
to
Irish
table
.
this
motion
rightly
call
for
a
regulatory
framework
to
ensure
that
all
operator
produce
to
the
high
standard
.
as
a
country
,
we
must
ensure
we
competitive
advantage
in
the
production
of
beef
.
if
third
country
producer
be
not
operate
to
the
same
standard
as
ours
and
if
there
be
a
risk
to
the
Irish
and
European
consumer
,
the
EU
food
and
Veterinary
Office
must
be
give
the
legislative
tooth
to
expedite
a
ban
or
other
such
mechanism
within
a
reasonable
timeframe
to
address
the
concern
of
Irish
farm
family
and
consumer
.
government
policy
on
the
protection
of
consumer
in
so
far
as
it
pertain
to
guard
against
health
risk
in
food
importation
be
too
weak
at
present
.
on
substantial
transformation
,
I
realise
that
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
labelling
legislation
rest
with
the
food
Safety
Authority
of
Ireland
.
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
,
whereby
a
primary
product
can
enter
Ireland
,
be
process
in
some
way
and
subsequently
be
brand
as
Irish
,
be
govern
by
EU
legislation
.
however
,
it
be
not
good
enough
that
the
government
would
hide
behind
EU
legislation
in
tackle
this
problem
,
nor
be
it
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
say
it
can
only
be
amend
at
EU
level
.
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
on
3
October
last
,
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
deputy
Sargent
,
express
the
follow
concern
:
...
this
arrangement
could
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
be
use
to
mislead
the
consumer
as
to
the
origin
of
the
raw
material
use
in
certain
product
.
I
be
not
satisfied
with
the
current
legal
position
and
the
minister
have
raise
we
concern
at
EU
Council
level
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
share
my
concern
,
we
need
to
know
how

will
address
they
and
what
proactive
measure
he
will
take
to
ensure
the
viability
of
producer
and
confidence
of
consumer
,
who
should
be
the
primary
concern
.
it
be
not
sufficient
for
he
to
say
:
"
the
concept
of
substantial
transformation
need
to
be
more
clearly
define
and
I
will
continue
to
urge
the
commission
to
address
this
problem
.
"
a
weak
legislative
base
on
labelling
allow
consumer
to
be
dup
into
believe
product
of
the
kind
in
question
be
of
Irish
origin
.
the
government
's
primary
concern
must
be
to
protect
the
health
of
consumer
and
ensure
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
farming
.
in
seek
to
be
proactive
on
this
matter
,
we
must
work
with
the
farming
organisation
and
processor
to
ensure
that
the
quality
assurance
mark
take
pride
of
place
on
every
packet
leave
the
factory
floor
.
a
clear
marketing
strategy
,
with
a
strengthening
of
legislation
,
be
the
key
to
solve
this
problem
.
on
3
October
last
I
ask
the
minister
if
she
would
amend
legislation
to
ensure
that
foodstuff
of
foreign
origin
would
not
be
label
as
"
produce
in
Ireland
"
,
"
process
in
Ireland
"
or
"
source
and
produce
in
Ireland
"
.
I
ask
the
question
to
remedy
the
circumstance
whereby
consumer
and
producer
interest
be
not
be
protect
and
to
ensure
that
we
comparative
advantage
as
a
nation
would
be
maintain
.
I
realise
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
have
overall
responsibility
for
the
general
food
labelling
legislation
and
that
food
labelling
be
govern
by
directive
2000
/
13
/
EC
.
the
government
state
in
response
to
the
commission
paper
labelling
,
competitiveness
,
consumer
information
and
good
regulation
for
the
EU
,
publish
in
2002
,
that
there
be
a
unsatisfactory
practice
at
play
regard
substantive
transformation
.
the
government
make
certain
recommendation
in
this
regard
but
they
have
not
come
to
fruition
.
why
have
the
commission
not
act
on
the
Irish
recommendation
to
date
and
why
have
the
minister
not
be
more
proactive
on
the
matter
?
the
commission
be
now
prepare
to
forward
proposal
but
I
understand
this
involve
a
co-decision
procedure
.
we
could
be
back
in
this
house
in
12
month
still
with
no
resolution
to
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
.
I
urge
the
minister
to
fast
-
track
the
process
,
where
possible
.
on
29
September
last
,
the
Irish
Farmers
Journal
report
that
Reox
Holding
,
a
subsidiary
of
Dairygold
,
be
in
the
process
of
sell
Breeo
Foods
.
Breeo
Foods
carry
top
brand
such
as
Dairygold
,
Shaws
,
Galtee
meat
,
Roscrea
,
Mitchelstown
,
Calvita
and
Sno
.
this
brand
be
long
-
establish
in
the
mind
of
consumer
and
be
perceive
to
be
Irish
in
origin
and
content
.
the
truth
be
otherwise
and
some
of
this
brand
be
market
in
a
way
that
suggest
they
be
Irish
.
in
the
mind
of
pig
producer
and
worker
in
Mitchelstown
and
beyond
,
the
closure
of
Galtee
Foods
be
as
a
direct
result
of
substantial
transformation
.
if
there
be
to
be
no
provision
in
Irish
law
to
amend
legislation
in
the
short
term
,
the
government
should
ensure
that
labelling
,
through
a
proper
marketing
strategy
by
Bord
Bia
,
will
be
implement
clearly
.
the
government
must
also
allow
open
access
to
that
plant
that
be
be
market
by
Bord
Bia
to
ensure
that
the
content
of
all
produce
be
as
it
say
on
the
packet
or
tin
.
I
be
not
ashamed
to
say
we
must
protect
we
national
interest
.
we
have
a
comparative
advantage
over
other
country
and
we
must
maintain
this
competitive
edge
.
the
future
of
Irish
agriculture
depend
upon
it
.
it
be
not
my
job
to
criticise
the
government
for
the
sake
of
criticism
but
it
be
necessary
to
critically
assess
its
response
to
agricultural
issue
as
they
arise
.
the
Labour
Party
be
not
against
the
science
of
genetic
modification
and
do
not
adopt
a
fundamentalist
view
thereon
.
we
believe
biotechnology
can
coexist
with
natural
biodiversity
without
compromise
the
latter
.
it
be
in
this
context
that
we
seek
to
ensure
that
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
be
maintain
.
with
that
in
mind
,
it
be
beyond
we
comprehension
that
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
choose
to
abstain
from
a
crucial
vote
on
genetically
modify
animal
feed
at
a
meeting
of
the
European
Council
of
Minister
in
Brussels
last
month
.
the
minister
's
logic
for
this
abstention
,
that
be
,
that
it
do
not
affect
the
eventual
outcome
,
be
beyond
belief
.
we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
European
Commission
will
move
to
approve
genetically
modify
feed
import
.
the
internal
party
machination
of
the
Green
Party
be
of
no
concern
to
we
.
what
be
of
concern
to
we
be
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
EU
scientific
committee
move
at
a
pace
that
be
in
keeping
with
the
market
and
provide
for
a
level
playing
pitch
for
Irish
agriculture
.
the
government
's
intransigence
on
this
issue
,
by
way
of
abdicate
its
responsibility
,
be
grossly
negligent
and
undermine
we
ability
to
negotiate
on
further
matter
of
this
nature
.
we
support
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
it
mark
a
pragmatic
approach
to
the
good
means
of
maintain
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
while
protect
the
right
of
consumer
to
perfect
knowledge
of
they
purchase
and
ensure
that
Irish
farming
family
can
compete
on
a
level
playing
pitch
.

member
on
this
side
of

House

not
seek
to
play
politics
with
this
issue

we
question
,
as
be
we
right
,
the
decision
by
Amgen
and
the
government
's
response
to
it
.
the
company
have
have
two
postponement
.
on
15
October
,
the
Minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
meet
with
Amgen
.
the
people
of
Carrigtwohill
and
the
region
want
to
find
out
what
the
future
hold
for
Amgen
.
be
it
in
a
position
to
state
whether
it
will
proceed
with
the
plant
?
if
anybody
be
to
be
accuse
of
play
politics
with
this
issue
it
be
the
member
of
the
minister
's
party
and
he
backbencher
.
what
about
the
€4
million
?
we
all
accept
the
vagary
of
the
international
market
,
that
negotiation
be
delicate
and
that
landmark
project
of
this
nature
sometimes
do
not
proceed
.
if
Amgen
be
retain
ownership
of
the
site
,
the
people
of
the
region
will
want
to
know
why
it
be
do
so
when
they
have
postpone
the
project
twice
.
be
the
minister
continue
negotiation
with
Amgen
?
will
Amgen
make
a
final
decision
on
its
intention
in
a
reasonable
time
?
the
people
of
the
region
want
to
know
where
Amgen
be
go
?
if
it
do
not
locate
within
the
site
will
someone
else
do
so
?
give
that
€
4
million
have
be
expend
to
attract
this
industry
,
a
legitimate
question
hang
over
the
use
of
taxpayer
's
money
to
attract
industry
.
the
Amgen
project
could
be
use
as
a
benchmark
for
foreign
direct
investment
project
throughout
the
country

for
global
trend

that
nature

if
the
global
financial
and
economic
infrastructure
be
change
and
Amgen
can
make
a
sudden
decision
of
this
nature

question
must
be
pose

the
nature

that
be
why
we

this

first
step
in
implement
the
Programme
for
government
commitment
,
in
relation
to
micro-generation
,
be
the
facilitation
of
a
'
net
metering
'
system
whereby
local
producer
can
sell
surplus
electricity
they
generate
back
to
the
grid
.
this
will
be
facilitate
by
the
introduction
of
smart
meter
to
all
micro-generation
site
.
my
department
be
work
closely
with
the
Commission
for
Energy
Regulation
,
Sustainable
Energy
Ireland
,
ESB
Network
and
the
Electro
-
technical
Council
of
Ireland
,
to
put
in
place
this
and
all
other
administrative
,
technical
and
safety
standard
and
practice
to
underpin
the
widespread
deployment
of
micro-generation
technology
.
any
development
of
distribute
generation
on
a
all
-
island
basis
would
be
undertake
in
full
consultation
with
the
Northern
Ireland
authority
in
the
context
of
the
all
-
island
energy
framework
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Broughan
.
I
will
speak
for
approximately
two
minute
.
I
thank
deputy
Broughan
for
share
he
time
.
he
would
have
give
I
more
time
but
I
be
sure
he
will
address
the
salient
point
in
the
argument
.
there
be
a
gross
disparity
result
from
the
outsource
of
driver
testing
to
private
company
.
the
list
of
centre
on
the
on
-
line
driving
application
form
on
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
,
website
do
not
include
every
centre
to
which
driver
may
apply
.
I
know
of
people
who
wait
month
for
they
test
only
to
be
inform
by
telephone
that
it
have
be
outsource
to
a
private
company
at
a
test
centre
other
than
the
one
to
which
they
have
apply
.
they
receive
no
notification
of
this
change
in
writing
.
applicant
who
move
to
live
in
another
part
of
the
country
encounter
serious
difficulty
in
transfer
they
application
to
test
centre
at
they
new
location
.
I
know
a
man
who
apply
for
a
driving
test
in
Tallaght
where
he
be
live
but
who
late
move
permanently
to
Mallow
.
he
seek
in
writing
to
do
he
test
at
the
Mallow
test
centre
.
since
then
he
have
receive
two
test
date
from
SGS
in
Tallaght
.
he
have
receive
no
correspondence
acknowledge
he
request
to
change
test
centre
.
SGS
management
tell
he
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract
for
testing
in
Cork
.
he
will
soon
have
to
move
to
he
third
provisional
licence
before
receive
a
driving
test
date
.
the
testing
system
be
farcical
and
until
this
be
sort
out
,
the
rate
of
fully
qualified
driver
will
increase
only
marginally
,
not
at
the
rate
the
government
and
the
RSA
anticipate
,
certainly
not
in
the
ten
week
timescale
determine
by
the
minister
or
,
as
he
put
it
,
"
on
demand
"
.

I
thank
the
minister
for
she
reply
.
the
timeline
be
as
we
anticipate
and
I
welcome
the
establishment
of
the
consultative
committee
.
I
refer
the
minister
to
a
speech
give
by
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
in
Paris
last
month
.
she
refer
to
the
Health
check
,
the
strengthening
of
competitiveness
,
support
rural
society
and
so
on
.
it
be
all
very
aspirational
in
its
aim
.
farmer
be
worried
about
the
issue
of
cross-compliance
and
modulation
under
the
single
payment
scheme
and
,
particularly
,
whether
the
commission
will
place
upper
or
low
limit
on
payment
to
they
under
the
scheme
in
the
context
of
the
Health
check
.
they
be
worried
about
the
nature
of
cross
compliance
and
the
stringent
control
under
which
they
be
place
.
have
the
government
define
a
clear
negotiating
position
on
that
issue
because
farmer
have
strong
view
on
they
?
the
government
be
now
discriminate
against
that
people
who
get
they
application
in
on
time
and
who
will
now
be
cut
off
as
a
result
of
this
action
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
verbose
answer
and
he
advertising
blurb
for
RTE
.
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
Bord
Bia
and
the
Department
of
Community
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
through
the
leader
programme
be
do
much
to
encourage
farmer
's
market
.
however
,
on
the
ground
,
many
farmer
's
market
be
striving
—
I
will
not
say
they
be
struggle
—
to
boost
they
popularity
locally
.
much
of
this
work
be
do
through
voluntary
effort
.
while
programme
be
in
place
through
leader
to
help
they
,
if
some
sort
of
direct
support
be
make
available
to
they
for
advertising
through
local
media
,
it
would
be
of
great
assistance
to
they
.
judge
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
,
he
be
not
tell
I
that
he
Department
necessarily
will
be
directly
responsible
for
that
and
I
accept
this
point
.
I
also
accept
the
fact
that
there
be
serious
potential
within
this
country
for
the
growth
of
local
market
.
will
the
minister
of
State
consider
the
idea
of
direct
finance
for
marketing
and
advertising
?
I
be
aware
of
the
time
constraint
.
give
that
the
legislation
be
at
the
stage
of
a
first
reading
at
the
Council
of
Minister
,
be
the
minister
aware
of
the
range
of
pesticide
that
will
come

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
construct
a
relief
road
at
Mallow
,
County
Cork
and
the
urgent
need
to
serve
notice
to
land
owner
within
the
vicinity
of
the
project
before
the
period
expire
,
beyond
which
the
compulsory
purchase
order
process
cannot
take
place
,
thus
jeopardise
the
project
's
future
.
as
previously
state
,
most
recently
in
my
reply
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
530
on
9
October
2007
,
the
approach
to
determine
the
hardship
payment
be
fair
and
reasonable
and
there
be
no
plan
to
revise
the
scheme
.
the
€
25
m
salmon
Hardship
scheme
adopt
by
government
be
intend
to
provide
a
measure
of
relief
to
individiual
in
line
with
the
level
of
hardship
likely
to
be
experience
on
foot
of
the
cessation
of
mix
stock
fishing
for
wild
salmon
.
the
overall
sum
take
account
of
the
level
of
payment
recommend
by
the
independent
Group
and
the
record
catch
history
of
the
eligible
licensee
.
a
additional
€
5
million
be
be
provide
under
a
Community
support
scheme
,
the
focus
of
which
primarily
will
be
that
community
where
commercial
salmon
fishing
have
be
a
well
-
establish
activity
and
where
its
withdrawal
demonstrably
impact
on
the
economic
and
social
fabric
of
the
area
.
the
transfer
of
function
to
the
Department
of
Transport
seem
logical
and
laudable
in
some
respects
.
it
can
only
be
effective
if
it
deal
with
a
certain
range
of
issue
.
I
can
only
speak
for
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
for
the
general
Cork
area
,
where
funding
for
non-national
road
have
be
absolutely
derisory
.
if
this
Bill
be
to
mean
anything
,
it
must
ensure
funding
be
effective
and
will
trickle
down
through
the
various
division
within
Cork
County
Council
and
its
engineering
area
.
what
we
have
see
to
date
be
that
road
prioritise
under
Transport
21
receive
funding
,
which
be
welcome
,
but
non-national
road
or
secondary
road
receive
no
funding
whatsoever
.
the
N72
and
N73
be
particular
example
.
if
we
be
to
take
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
which
be
on
that
route
,
one
will
serve
the
main
tourist
route
between
Waterford
and
Killarney
and
the
other
will
serve
the
main
route
from
Kanturk
,
west
of
Mallow
and
through
to
Dublin
.
Mallow
currently
have
hub
-
town
status
but
we
be
not
get
the
trickle
-
down
effect
of
financial
incentive
to
create
the
northern
relief
road
,
which
be
vital
to
a
town
like
Mallow
and
its
surround
area
in
term
of
its
attractiveness
for
inward
investment
and
the
creation
of
infrastructure
around
the
town
.
we
need
a
change
in
policy
and
funding
for
road
such
as
this
.
they
be
vital
artery
for
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
but
they
have
become
dangerous
road
because
of
a
lack
of
proper
funding
.
to
travel
the
road
from
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
on
a
day
such
as
today
,
in
some
instance
one
be
take
one
's
life
in
one
's
hand
.
two
lorry
cannot
pass
each
other
comfortably
on
some
part
of
the
road
without
stop
or
slowing
down
to
speed
of
5
km/h
or
10
kilometer
/h
.
that
speak
volume
about
the
government
not
invest
properly
in
such
infrastructure
.
deputy
Ferris
speak
of
community
involvement
and
local
improvement
scheme
.
there
be
almost
a
begging
-
bowl
mentality
in
this
regard
for
public
representative
such
as
myself
.
I
have
to
go
cap
in
hand
to
local
area
engineer
to
seek
funding
or
to
have
certain
road
prioritise
within
divisional
engineering
area
,
which
be
completely
ludicrous
in
this
day
and
age
.
if
people
pay
road
tax
and
a
development
contribution
for
the
building
of
a
house
in
a
rural
part
of
the
county
,
I
do
not
see
why
they
should
have
to
pay
extra
to
have
a
road
include
in
a
local
improvement
or
community
involvement
scheme
.
this
people
should
have
the
same
rights
and
entitlement
as
any
other
citizen
of
this
State
to
have
the
road
outside
they
house
in
a
acceptable
condition
.
the
Cork
to
Limerick
road
also
speak
volume
about
government
policy
,
as
we
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
have
be
wait
for
this
northern
relief
road
but
be
almost
at
the
mercy
of
Transport
21
and
the
funding
stream
of
the
NRA
.
there
be
also
the
question
of
whether
the
NRA
will
get
the
requisite
funding
to
be
able
to
create
the
Atlantic
corridor
between
Cork
and
Limerick
,
and
whether
a
spur
will
be
create
for
the
northern
relief
road
.
this
be
policy
issue
as
to
how
funding
be
implement
at
the
local
level
but
they
have
a
great
effect
on
people
's
life
.
that
be
what
we
be
speak
to
in
debate
this
legislation
.
will
a
change
in
legislation
bring
about
a
mark
increase
in
the
quality
of
people
's
life
,
as
we
must
ensure
it
do
?
I
speak
about
development
contribution
and
the
current
funding
of
local
government
be
completely
inequitable
.
if
a
young
couple
apply
for
planning
permission
today
,
they
will
be
levy
at
exorbitant
rate
for
contribution
on
the
building
of
they
house
.
it
add
to
the
cost
of
building
and
they
do
not
see
a
return
in
term
of
increase
lighting
or
improvement
in
the
road
surface
outside
the
house
.
the
money
be
centralise
within
the
county
council
and
then
divvy
out
through
the
division
.
the
northern
division
of
a
county
council
would
compete
with
the
southern
division
for
funding
into
specific
area
.
the
entire
area
of
government
policy
as
it
pertain
to
road
must
be
look
at
.
if
we
be
to
enhance
the
quality
of
people
's
life
,
any
effect
or
change
in
the
legislation
must
ensure
this
happen
.
if
the
government
's
proposal
succeed
,
there
will
be
dire
consequence
for
the
provision
of
not
-
for
-
profit
child
care
and
the
significant
contribution
make
by
this
sector
to
we
community
will
be
roll
back
.
any
change
to
the
subvention
structure
under
the
national
child
care
investment
programme
that
result
in
a
reduction
in
staffing
level
will
mean
a
reduction
in
fund
available
to
pay
staff
in
many
community
-
base
child
care
centre
.
this
possibility
contradict
the
commitment
in
the
national
development
plan
to
provide
a
additional
28000
child
care
place
and
8,000
job
in
child
care
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
subvention
be
be
introduce
in
reverse
.
that
be
to
say
,
the
high
rate
of
subvention
be
be
suggest
for
parent
who
be
in
receipt
of
full
social
welfare
.
if
a
parent
stop
receive
social
welfare
and
take
up
employment
that
parent
's
subvention
for
child
care
be
reduce
.
this
reduce
the
incentive
to
take
up
employment
.
the
government
,
through
its
action
,
be
contradict
its
own
state
policy
.
at
present
,
community
child
care
facility
serve
a
mix
of
family
reflective
of
the
local
community
.
if
this
subvention
scheme
be
implement
accord
to
the
current
proposal
,
community
child
care
facility
may
be
see
as
centre
at
which
only
the
child
of
social
welfare
recipient
be
facilitate
.
this
be
contrary
to
any
social
inclusion
remit
.
how
will
work
family
on
marginal
income
who
be
not
entitle
to
any
form
of
State
support
have
access
to
affordable
child
care
?
community
child
care
facility
which
have
be
in
receipt
of
staffing
grant
since
2002
will
now
be
oblige
to
consider
increase
they
fee
as
a
result
of
this
measure
.
where
be
the
commitment
to
quality
child
care
centre
and
to
the
benefit
of
early
childhood
education
and
socialisation
?
where
be
the
commitment
to
the
volunteer
all
over
the
country
who
have
give
of
they
time
,
and
be
still
do
so
,
to
find
site
,
apply
for
funding
,
fill
in
form
,
set
up
service
and
become
employer
?
I
call
on
the
government
to
rethink
its
proposal
and
let
common
sense
prevail
.
the
provision
of
telecomumication
service
,
include
next
generation
broadband
be
a
matter
for
the
private
sector
operate
in
a
liberalise
market
,
regulate
by
the
Commission
for
Communication
Regulation
(
ComReg
)
.
my
Department
be
currently
draft
a
policy
paper
on
next
Generation
Network
(
NGNs
)
.
the
paper
will
consider
the
extent
and
impact
of
government
investment
in
broadband
infrastructure
to
date
and

in
the
light
of
the
publication
yesterday
of
the
European
Commission
's
proposal
on
cap
reform
and
of
the
health
check
and
give
that
this
be
a
legislative
proposal
to
which
the
government
will
be
a
party
and
which
will
have
serious
permutation
for
Ireland
and
bring
about
significant
change
with
regard
to
how
the
farming
community
and
the
rural
economy
develop
,
will
the
government
make
time
available
to
debate
the
matter
in
the
House
?
although
no
specific
legislative
proposal
be
due
to
come
before
the
House
,
will
the
government
,
in
view
of
the
serious
nature
and
importance
of
the
issue
,
make
arrangement
for
such
a
debate
?
I
accept
the
Taoiseach
's
point
.
the
matter
will
obviously
be
discuss
by
the
joint
committee
.
however
,
in
view
of
its
serious
nature
,
it
be
worthy
of
a
debate
in
the
House
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Wall
.
in
speak
to
this
motion
one
wonder
what
be
the
government
's
primary
motivation
in
put
it
before
the
House
.
it
be
not
a
legislative
proposal
.
it
contain
no
concrete
provision
.
it
be
short
on
detail
and
long
on
aspiration
and
therein
lie
the
rub
.
the
government
be
high
on
aspiration
but
low
on
delivery
.
the
motion
be
so
broad
that
one
sense
there
be
a
clear
agenda
by
the
government
to
pay
lip
service
to
the
idea
of
address
the
young
people
's
issue
throughout
this
island
.
what
young
people
want
be
concrete
legislative
proposal
that
will
speak
directly
to
they
concern
.
this
concern
be
well
document
and
have
be
bring
to
government
through
representative
body
such
as
the
National
Youth
Council
of
Ireland
,
NYCI
.
the
NYCI
be
a
social
partner
and
the
genuineness
of
this
motion
will
be
measure
by
the
government
's
response
to
concern
outline
by
group
such
as
the
NYCI
.
I
fear
,
however
,
that
this
motion
be
meaningless
and
full
of
platitude
and
that
young
people
have
become
use
to
hear
from
a
government
about
the
provision
of
service
.
in
the
limited
time
afford
to
I
I
wish
to
address
a
number
of
specific
area
.
the
first
relate
to
the
health
of
child
and
we
young
people
.
the
NYCI
,
in
its
budget
submission
,
call
on
the
government
to
deliver
on
its
promise
to
double
the
income
threshold
for
full
medical
card
entitlement
for
parent
of
child
under
six
year
of
age
in
this
year
's
budget
.
I
believe
this
be
attainable
.
the
government
must
look
positively
on
this
proposal
.
approximately
1.1
million
child
and
young
people
under
the
age
of
18
live
in
Ireland
.
accord
to
the
NYCI
,
only
305000
of
they
be
cover
under
the
medical
card
scheme
.
access
to
a
gp
be
vital
to
ensure
that
a
young
person
can
avail
of
service
to
assist
he
or
she
through
this
difficult
year
.
a
young
person
need
to
be
able
to
do
this
without
incur
a
financial
cost
.
this
service
would
serve
as
a
positive
move
that
would
give
young
people
the
confidence
and
independence
to
avail
of
vital
service
but
in
a
way
that
would
ensure
confidentiality
.
Young
people
live
in
rural
area
in
particular
where
counselling
and
other
service
be
not
readily
available
would
benefit
in
particular
.
the
government
must
also
look
favourably
on
family
with
child
over
the
age
of
seven
and
under
the
age
of
18
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
income
threshold
be
raise
to
allow
more
child
to
avail
of
primary
and
secondary
health
care
.
the
second
issue
that
need
to
be
address
be
the
lack
of
adequate
facility
and
service
for
young
people
who
be
in
need
of
counselling
and
require
access
to
mental
health
facility
.
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
the
organisation
Let
get
together
be
set
up
to
help
other
affect
by
suicide
and
to
examine
way
of
prevent
it
.
in
2005
the
Let
get
together
Foundation
link
up
with
a
number
of
similar
organisation
throughout
the
country
to
set
up
a
all
-
Ireland
suicide
prevention
strategy
,
thereby
raise
awareness
of
the
issue
and
speak
to
local
and
national
media
.
if
this
motion
be
to
mean
anything
,
the
government
must
assist
organisation
of
this
nature
.
the
high
rate
of
suicide
be
find
among
young
man
aged
under
35
—
this
age
group
account
for
40
%
of
all
Irish
suicide
.
there
be
a
clear
lack
of
a
coherent
government
policy
to
encourage
young
people
who
be
experience
difficulty
in
they
life
to
talk
to
other
about
it
.
the
lack
of
available
fact
on
a
range
of
health
and
lifestyle
issue
link
potential
user
to
relevant
help
service
throughout
the
country
be
exacerbate
the
travesty
of
suicide
which
have
reach
epidemic
proportion
throughout
this
land
.
we
have
the
fifth
high
suicide
rate
in
Europe
among
the
15
to
25
year
age
group
and
death
by
suicide
be
the
number
one
cause
of
death
among
young
Irish
man
.
the
government
,
if
it
be
serious
about
this
motion
,
need
to
fund
more
campaign
of
representative
organisation
such
as
the
NYCI
,
through
the
primary
care
strategy
,
to
reduce
the
large
number
of
death
by
suicide
.
awareness
must
be
raise
.
Young
people
need
option
and
to
be
able
to
access
they
in
a
safe
and
non-judgmental
manner
.
we
have
all
experience
tough
time
.
many
of
we
have
be
fortunate
in
that
we
have
family
and
friend
to
support
we
.
not
every
young
person
have
that
luxury
.
issue
such
as
come
out
to
parent
,
unexpected
pregnancy
,
low
self
-
esteem
and
depression
need
to
be
tackle
in
a
non-judgmental
way
.
on
the
issue
of
unwanted
pregnancy
,
now
that
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
,
deputy
Harney
,
have
admit
that
vat
on
condom
can
be
cut
to
as
low
as
5
%
,
will
she
not
bring
a
proposal
to
cabinet
that
the
minister
for
Finance
should
cut
the
tax
from
21
%
to
5
%
,
as
be
do
in
the
UK
and
other
EU
member
state
?
the
crisis
Pregnancy
Agency
have
state
that
32
%
of
people
have
indicate
that
the
cost
of
contraception
be
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
not
to
use
condom
,
result
in
a
rise
incidence
of
sexually
transmit
disease
and
unintended
pregnancy
.
I
could
go
on
as
there
be
many
issue
.
however
,
since
I
be
share
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Wall
,
I
be
happy
to
do
so
and
will
leave
it
at
that
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
the
Defence
Force
camp
at
Kilworth
,
County
Cork
,
have
be
designate
as
the
location
for
a
prison
cover
Munster
and
it
will
replace
facility
at
Cork
Prison
in
particular
.
the
propose
location
of
the
prison
will
be
within
the
1200
acre
camp
locate
close
to
the
M8
motorway
between
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
and
it
be
destine
to
house
up
to
450
prisoner
.
on
Monday
last
,
the
resident
of
the
immediate
area
call
public
representative
to
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
proposal
and
to
air
they
genuine
concern
.
in
seek
this
adjournment
debate
,
I
wish
to
speak
about
a
number
of
that
concern
.
give
that
this
prison
will
be
construct
under
the
term
of
the
strategic
infrastructure
legislation
,
there
be
genuine
concern
that
local
resident
's
fear
will
not
be
address
.
the
construction
of
such
a
large
prison
within
a
very
rural
area
raise
a
number
of
fear
.
for
example
,
landowner
who
lease
land
from
the
Department
of
Defence
for
agricultural
purpose
now
wonder
where
they
future
lie
.
they
have
a
long
-
standing
arrangement
and
have
ask
will
they
be
able
to
stay
on
the
land
or
will
this
scenario
change
.
person
have
also
ask
whether
the
land
acquisition
process
for
the
prison
have
be
complete
.
if
not
,
there
be
a
strong
school
of
thought
within
the
community
that
the
footprint
of
the
prison
should
be
move
to
a
more
suitable
location
within
the
overall
landholding
.
the
community
also
believe
the
prison
should
be
construct
within
contour
that
make
it
more
suitable
.
it
be
strongly
perceive
that
the
current
proposal
,
as
we
understand
it
,
be
a
site
within
162
acre
.
if
the
land
acquisition
be
not
complete
,
resident
believe
that
the
case
could
be
make
for
the
prison
to
be
move
,
even
if
that
be
beyond
the
current
162
-
acre
footprint
.
from
a
environmental
point
of
view
,
there
be
concern
that
three
stream
within
the
footprint
of
the
proposal
will
be
compromise
.
the
area
in
question
be
serve
by
the
Killally
,
Ballinrush
and
Graigue
group
water
scheme
.
the
source
of
this
scheme
be
approximate
to
the
footprint
of
the
site
.
the
minister
,
in
response
to
a
question
I
tab
on
Thursday
last
,
state
that
normal
planning
provision
do
not
apply
to
a
prison
development
.
there
be
a
understanding
that
for
security
reason
one
do
not
broadcast
or
make
know
the
exact
plan
.
we
all
acknowledge
that
fact
,
but
further
concern
have
be
raise
about
the
transport
provision
to
and
from
the
prison
.
person
in
the
nearby
village
of
Kilworth
,
where
at
time
traffic
cause
a
bottleneck
,
be
seek
,
through
they
community
council
,
assurance
on
the
traffic
management
provision
of
the
proposal
.
they
also
seek
a
buffer
zone
around
the
prison
from
a
aesthetic
and
security
point
of
view
.
that
who
live
in
Cork
city
be
use
to
the
presence
of
a
prison
within
they
city
.
the
construction
of
a
prison
of
this
nature
in
a
very
rural
area
would
give
rise
to
genuine
cause
for
concern
and
anxiety
.
if
the
proposal
be
be
present
as
a
fait
accompli
and
be
not
subject
to
normal
planning
consideration
,
I
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
ensure
any
provision
relate
to
public
safety
and
environmental
concern
be
address
.
to
assist
the
community
further
,
I
respectfully
request
of
the
minister
and
he
official
that
he
would
meet
a
deputation
of
resident
and
public
representative
in
the
area
so
they
can
have
they
concern
address
at
a
early
stage
.

the
Taoiseach
be
acknowledge
that
the
Labour
Party
position
be
correct
.
we
have
now
reach
a
point
where
people
have
lose
confidence
in
the
system
of
deliver
cancer
care
.
that
people
's
confidence
in
the
system
have
be
shake
to
its
foundation
be
put
it
mildly
.
that
thousand
of
woman
who
be
at
risk
of
breast
cancer
face
a
cloud
of
uncertainty
be
a
sad
indictment
of
the
government
.
that
a
committee
of
this
House
be
inform
by
the
HSE
that
97
woman
would
have
to
be
recall
for
test
before
the
woman
themselves
be
inform
speak
volume
.
that
this
woman
have
not
be
contact
personally
within
24
hour
be
nothing
short
of
a
scandal
.
when
Dr.
Peter
Naughton
tell
the
minister
in
2005
that
breast
cancer
service
at
Portlaoise
be
a
shamble
,
do
she
listen
to
he
concern
?
yes
,
she
do
.
do
she
act
in
a
manner
that
be
reflective
of
she
position
as
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
?
the
answer
be
"
no
"
.
if
the
answer
be
"
yes
"
,
the
minister
would
not
only
have
refer
the
matter
to
the
HSE
,
she
would
have
follow
this
issue
to
its
proper
conclusion
and
take
total
responsibility
.
that
conclusion
should
have
be
the
restoration
of
confidencein
a
system
upon
which
thousand
of
woman
rely
.
what
be
the
culture
that
now
pervade
the
politics
of
health
?
it
be
one
where
responsibility
be
pass
from
the
executive
to
the
bureaucracy
and
where
political
accountability
be
non-existent
.
the
minister
be
wrong
to
adopt
a
hand
-
off
approach
.
that
be
plainly
and
simply
wrong
.
a
minister
for
Health
and
Children
cannot
adopt
a
hand
-
off
approach
.
otherwise
,
Angola
will
surely
follow
.
if
this
motion
achieve
nothing
else
,
it
will
have
put
down
a
clear
marker
to
the
government
that
the
issue
of
political
accountability
must
be
place
at
centre
stage
in
term
of
health
care
facility
and
delivery
.
that
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
have
be
force
to
give
a
account
of
she
action
be
a
victory
for
political
accountability
and
for
that
woman
who
tonight
live
in
fear
for
they
future
and
that
of
they
family
.
no
long
will
the
people
of
this
country
endure
a
system
that
leave
no
person
or
organisation
accountable
for
the
lack
of
delivery
of
cancer
care
and
other
service
.
we
role
as
public
representative
of
the
people
must
be
respect
.
if
we
seek
answer
,
we
must
get
answer
,
not
carefully
word
attempt
to
dodgeball
the
issue
.
the
minister
should
not
take
we
for
fool
.
nor
should
she
take
the
woman
we
represent
for
fool
.
if
we
deem
it
necessary
to
seek
answer
on
behalf
of
the
countless
victim
of
the
current
health
care
regime
,
the
minister
must
respect
that
and
must
respond
in
kind
.
we
can
no
long
accept
a
lack
of
political
accountability
.
the
question
tonight
be
whether
the
minister
act
with
due
diligence

she
do
not

I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
.
in
recent
time
,
November
have
be
one
of
the
good
month
of
the
year
for
the
Minister
for
Finance
.
today
,
of
all
day
,
will
tell
a
different
story
.
the
serious
decline
in
the
housing
construction
market
clearly
confirm
the
continue
fall
in
Exchequer
receipt
from
tax
such
as
stamp
duty
.
exchequer
figure
for
November
show
that
total
tax
receipt
be
almost
€
2
billion
behind
the
target
set
out
in
last
year
's
budget
.
the
Department
of
Finance
signal
last
Friday
that
tax
collect
this
year
would
be
approximately
€
1.7
billion
below
target
.
what
will
today
's
budget
bring
and
what
will
be
the
minister
for
Finance
's
priority
for
the
economy
for
the
year
ahead
?
with
inflation
run
at
4.8
%
—
among
the
high
rate
in
Europe
—
the
scope
for
a
expansive
budget
be
limit
.
the
budget
be
very
relevant
to
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
there
be
not
a
great
deal
in
that
motion
with
which
I
disagree
.
the
issue
of
competitiveness
and
rise
labour
cost
be
key
driver
for
any
economic
outlook
.
the
budget
will
determine
whether
the
call
within
the
motion
will
bear
fruit
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Penrose
,
outline
a
number
of
fundamental
point
relate
to
the
lack
of
investment
in
infrastructure
and
issue
of
public
sector
pay
.
it
be
true
that
infrastructural
spending
in
this
country
be
well
below
par
.
there
may
have
be
serious
spending
on
inter-
urban
route
such
as
that
between
Cork
and
Dublin
,
but
there
be
still
regional
disparity
which
have
not
be
sort
out
.
how
long
do
it
take
a
train
to
get
from
Dublin
to
Sligo
?
if
a
burst
water
pipe
can
turn
Dublin
's
principal
motorway
into
a
car
park
for
eight
hour
,
then
what
can
we
seriously
expect
from
a
government
that
be
lung
from
one
crisis
to
another
?
there
be
secondary
and
non-national
road
throughout
this
island
that
be
rarely
travel
by
minister
,
and
that
eminent
backbencher
from
south
Kerry
himself
admit
that
if
there
be
a
pothole
to
be
fill
in
the
absence
of
the
Ceann
Comhairle
,
he
would
look
after
it
.
should
we
be
live
on
a
island
as
prosperous
as
this
with
even
one
pothole
to
we
name
in
this
day
and
age
?
the
fact
they
exist
at
all
be
a
testament
to
the
lack
of
investment
in
non-national
road
throughout
the
country
.
in
regard
to
broadband
,
there
be
part
of
north
Cork
where
people
be
still
diall
-
up
to
access
the
Internet
.
diall
up
in
2007
be
a
joke
.
data
publish
by
the
European
Commission
show
that
in
2007
,
74
%
of
household
in
the
Netherlands
have
broadband
access
compare
with
31
%
in
Ireland
.
who
be
responsible
for
ensure
that
Ireland
meet
its
goal
of
become
what
the
government
call
a
"
world
-
class
knowledge
economy
"
in
just
over
five
year
?
how
can
we
compete
on
a
global
scale
if
the
roll
-
out
of
broadband
be
at
such
a
paltry
level
?
the
Fine
Gael
motion
call
on
the
government
to
take
necessary
action
on
public
sector
pay
.
it
be
difficult
to
comprehend
just
exactly
what
this
mean
.
the
vast
bulk
of
both
public
sector
and
private
sector
worker
be
operate
at
wage
level
that
keep
they
and
they
family
's
head
just
above
the
water
-
line
.
a
total
of
1.5
million
people
have
salary
worth
less
than
€
38000
.
to
survive
on
a
wage
of
€
38000
in
today
's
term
be
a
difficult
task
.
Real
people
operate
and
survive
within
this
bracket
,
but
they
be
under
pressure
in
this
society
.
they
mortgage
have
increase
and
they
have
borrow
to
meet
the
demand
of
day
to
day
living
.
they
be
overwork
,
overcharge
for
child
care
and
overstretched
.
they
average
basket
of
food
item
be
increase
at
a
rate
of
4
%
to
5
%
per
annum
.
person
on
this
income
bracket
can
ill
afford
to
absorb
such
increase
,
yet
they
be
the
back
-
bone
of
this
economy
.
today
the
minister
will
present
the
usual
budget
of
tax
and
social
welfare
change
.
he
must
look
at
this
income
bracket
and
provide
some
measure
of
relief
to
increase
real
income
to
offset
the
increase
cost
of
living
.
Fianna
Fáil
make
generous
election
promise
on
health
,
education
and
justice
with
more
teacher
,
more
gardaí
and
more
consultant
promise
.
today
will
tell
whether
the
minister
intend
to
fulfil
that
promise
.
there
be
a
nervousness
about
Ireland
's
economic
prospect
,
and
much
talk
of
a
tight
budget
.
this
motion
largely
address
that
concern
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
we
should
not
play
politics
with
the
economy
.
I
do
not
wish
to
score
point
,
but
I
do
want
to
remind
this
government
that
its
handling
of
the
economy
have
a
bear
on
people
's
job
and
they
mortgage
and
how
they
provide
for
they
family
.
in
support
the
spirit
of
this
motion
,
but
not
the
full
tenet
of
it
,
we
believe
it
be
the
role
of
a
opposition
to
contribute
constructively
on
how
to
maintain
economic
prosperity
and
further
economic
development
.
there
be
serious
issue
about
we
competitiveness
and
we
have
to
face
up
to
that
.
however
,
there
be
also
a
lot
that
be
positive
about
the
economy
.
in
that
respect
,
as
a
nation
we
need
to
focus
on
opportunity
.
the
economic
review
and
outlook
,
produce
by
the
Department
of
Finance
last
month
,
predict
that
the
economy
will
grow
by
about
3
%
next
year
.
it
be
not
what
we
would
want
but
it
be
growth
and
we
should
acknowledge
that
.
we
still
need
to
focus
on
the
possibility
.
growth
in
the
economy
be
no
long
drive
by
the
export
of
goods
.
however
,
growth
of
service
export
be
very
healthy
.
we
need
to
continue
the
focus
on
sector
such
as
sale
,
research
and
development
and
high
-
value
trade
service
.
we
need
to
ensure
,
not
just
that
we
invest
in
research
in
we
university
,
but
that
the
knowledge
be
generate
be
turn
into
commercial
activity
and
that
young
indigenous
company
survive
.
the
agricultural
sector
be
a
mainstay
of
we
economy
.
food
and
drink
export
account
for
over
€
8
billion
.
we
must
also
look
to
we
rural
economy
and
ensure
that
investment
continue
in
the
agri
-food
sector
.
we
ignore
the
potential
of
the
rural
economy
at
we
peril
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
must
continue
to
ensure
we
can
attract
foreign
investment
.
it
do
not
include
spending
on
non-national
road
either
.
the
measure
will
probably
have
a
positive
effect
in
so
far
as
it
will
discourage
potential
new
smoker
.
if
the
price
of
cigarette
be
prohibitive
,
it
would
probably
have
that
effect
.
however
,
if
one
be
a
commit
smoker
,
it
will
not
change
one
's
behaviour
at
all
.
if
it
be
propose
as
a
health
measure
,
the
government
must
look
at
the
issue
of
smoking
cessation
.
if
some
of
this
money
could
be
divert
to
smoking
cessation
measure
,
then
perhaps
it
would
be
see
as
a
more
productive
move
.
I
also
urge
the
government
to
look
at
nicotine
replacement
substance
,
such
as
gum
and
patch
,
which
be
very
prohibitively
price
.
they
sale
be
also
restrict
in
that
they
be
only
available
in
pharmacy
,
although
they
be
widely
available
in
supermarket
and
multiple
in
other
mainland
European
country
.
if
one
be
to
discourage
people
from
smoking
,
one
need
to
look
at
the
distribution
of
that
product
as
well
.
that
be
absolute
rubbish
.
will
deputy
Curran
please
stop
talk
rubbish
?
it
be
merely
talk
for
talk
's
sake
.
what
be
the
human
and
social
implication
?
there
be
a
generational
issue
at
play
here
.
if
people
only
recently
become
use
to
deal
with
cheque
transaction
,
they
can
not
now
be
penalise
.
it
be
easy
for
people
of
my
generation
and
that
which
immediately
precede
it
because
we
be
use
to
electronic
banking
,
on
-
line
banking
,
use
ATM
card
etc.
,
but
not
everybody
be
in
a
position
to
carry
on
they
affair
in
this
way
,
particularly
when
one
take
into
consideration
issue
such
as
numeracy
skill
and
people
's
ability
to
deal
with
technology
.
if
the
government
be
determined
to
encourage
people
to
begin
hide
cash
under
they
mattress
again
—
—
—
—
this
be
the
way
to
do
it
.
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
people
to
return
to
act
in
this
way
.
we
want
to
make
it
easy
for
they
to
make
transaction
.

the

not

by
pharmacist
in
a
manner
that
be
not
in
keep
with
the
law
.
he
must
clarify
he
opinion
.
the
current
impasse
between
the
IPU
and
the
HSE
be
characterise
by
the
latter
seek
to
enforce
its
will
on
the
former
without
even
the
courtesy
or
corporate
social
responsibility
of
allow
negotiation
.
the
very
nature
of
this
unilateral
decision
to
slash
the
payment
make
by
the
HSE
to
pharmacist
for
the
purchase
of
medicine
will
undermine
the
viability
of
pharmacy
everywhere
.
I
do
not
speak
for
the
large
multiple
which
will
soak
up
the
reduction
in
margin
without
pain
but
for
community
base
and
family
run
pharmacy
which
have
a
wealth
of
knowledge
of
they
client
and
be
acutely
aware
of
the
intergenerational
health
issue
that
run
within
family
.
the
vast
majority
of
this
pharmacy
be
locate
in
rural
and
marginal
area
.
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
,
Mitchelstown
,
Youghal
,
Carrigtwohill
,
Cobh
and
Midleton
be
characterise
by
the
presence
of
independently
own
pharmacist
who
rely
heavily
on
the
general
medical
scheme
.
I
speak
for
that
who
may
have
take
over
a
pharmacy
from
a
parent
and
be
carry
on
a
proud
tradition
.
they
deserve
the
opportunity
to
at
least
negotiate
they
position
.
this
move
by
the
HSE
be
doll
up
as
reform
but
we
can
see
it
for
the
bullying
tactic
it
be
.
if
the
HSE
have
the
reform
zeal
it
purport
to
have
,
it
would
have
consult
the
pharmacist
prior
to
any
unilateral
move
.
that
be
why
we
be
seek
to
ensure
that
by
amend
the
Competition
Act
,
organisation
such
as
the
IPU
will
at
least
have
the
right
to
negotiate
a
position
that
will
not
leave
they
strand
on
this
or
any
other
issue
.
if
the
concept
of
engagement
and
social
partnership
be
to
mean
anything
,
the
government
will
at
least
afford
they
that
right
.
this
unilateral
action
by
the
Health
Service
executive
,
HSE
,
run
contrary
to
long
-
hold
belief
that
the
primacy
of
negotiation
with
any
representative
body
be
paramount
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
defend
that
right
.
it
extend
to
Blackpool
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
afford
I
this
opportunity
to
raise
this
matter
.
I
wish
to
speak
about
the
urgent
need
for
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Science
to
address
the
serious
delay
in
grant
permission
to
St.
Mary
's
community
school
,
Buttevant
,
County
Cork
,
to
build
a
new
school
to
provide
for
a
increase
in
the
student
population
.
this
issue
have
be
ongoing
for
more
than
ten
year
.
it
be
last
raise
by
my
predecessor
and
late
father
in
April
2007
.
as
yet
,
no
progress
have
be
make
in
this
regard
.
the
staff
and
pupil
,
as
well
as
the
people
of
Buttevant
,
have
be
wait
for
ten
year
for
this
project
to
be
expedite
and
I
now
call
on
the
minister
to
tell
the
people
of
Buttevant
when
she
intend
to
notify
County
Cork
vocational
Education
Committee
of
she
approval
of
the
new
school
.
when
I
be
a
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
it
take
a
proactive
decision
to
rezone
land
for
the
purpose
of
designate
a
educational
site
to
provide
for
this
school
.
at
present
,
the
school
principal
and
that
who
be
involved
in
the
school
only
seek
the
appointment
of
a
design
team
to
enable
they
at
least
to
move
to
a
stage
from
which
progress
can
be
make
on
this
issue
.
the
school
itself
be
characterise
by
building
which
in
some
instance
date
back
to
pre-Famine
time
.
as
the
enrolment
have
increase
from
182
last
year
to
194
this
year
,
be
set
to
rise
by
at
least
a
further
ten
next
year
and
be
increase
on
a
yearly
basis
,
the
people
of
Buttevant
and
the
school
authority
wonder
when
the
Department
will
expedite
this
matter
.
the
layout
of
the
building
be
of
a
very
poor
standard
and
design
because
the
building
be
not
a
purpose
-
build
school
.
the
staffroom
be
very
cramped
and
there
be
no
sport
facility
.
the
school
be
oblige
to
use
the
local
GAA
facility
for
physical
education
and
other
sport
use
.
as
the
site
have
be
purchase
on
foot
of
the
rezoning
,
that
step
of
the
process
have
be
undertake
.
I
call
for
some
progress
on
this
matter
and
for
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Science
at
least
to
deliver
on
a
promise
and
commitment
to
the
people
of
Buttevant
because
the
population
of
Buttevant
and
the
school
's
catchment
area
be
increase
yearly
.
it
be
anticipate
that
Buttevant
's
location
on
a
main
national
primary
route
will
make
it
a
far
more
attractive
place
to
live
in
future
and
the
need
of
the
local
secondary
school
on
a
new
greenfield
site
must
be
meet
in
that
context
.
this
issue
have
be
ongoing
for
more
than
ten
year
and
the
people
of
Buttevant
and
of
north
Cork
wish
to
see
some
progress
in
this
regard
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
this
on
board
and
expedite
the
matter
and
bring
it
to
design
stage
in
2008
.
I
will
conclude
by
wish
the
Acting
Chairman
,
the
staff
and
member
all
the
good
for
the
season
and
for
2008
.
that
be
a
virtual
cut

of

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
debate
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
construct
a
northern
relief
road
at
Mallow
,
County
Cork
,
and
the
urgent
question
why
the
notice
to
treat
be
not
serve
to
landowner
within
the
vicinity
of
the
project
and
why
the
NRA
have
postpone
this
project
again
.
today
I
receive
three
piece
of
correspondence
from
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
office
regard
four
question
I
put
down
to
minister
,
three
of
which
,
relate
to
the
upkeep
of
the
N72
and
N73
road
in
County
Cork
,
be
disallow
on
the
basis
that
the
minister
have
no
official
responsibility
to
Dáil
Éireann
for
this
matter
,
which
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
National
Road
Authority
.
I
also
pose
a
question
to
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
about
Lombardstown
Post
Office
and
the
continuance
of
its
operation
and
,
again
,
I
be
tell
that
the

have
no

when
be
it
deem
possible
for

House
to
ask

he
or

feel
be
pertinent

the
running
of

constituency
and
be
important
enough
to
raise
on
the
floor
of
the
House
by
way
of
a
parliamentary
question
,
without
be
tell
it
be
a
operational
matter
not
for

for

be
it
now
the
case
that
the

that
the

as

there
be
measure
in
the
Finance
Bill
that
be
laudable
,
such
as
the
welcome
measure
to
encourage
company
to
invest
in
environmentally
-
friendly
equipment
.
the
measure
under
the
save
as
you
earn
scheme
be
also
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
the
health
measure
,
such
as
the
vat
reduction
on
non-oral
contraceptive
,
include
condom
,
do
not
go
far
enough
.
it
be
we
contention
that
the
minister
should
have
further
reduce
the
rate
to
5
%
,
in
line
with
the
EU
vat
directive
.
I
will
specifically
refer
to
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
.
the
minister
should
fix
indefinitely
2003
as
the
base
year
for
avail
of
the
tax
credit
.
the
Bill
,
as
I
understand
it
,
extend
the
base
year
of
2003
for
the
purpose
of
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
for
a
further
four
year
to
31
December
2013
.
however
,
the
Bill
provide
that
the
subsequent
year
's
expenditure
,
for
calculate
the
incremental
spend
,
will
be
the
ten
year
before
the
end
of
the
relevant
accounting
period
.
for
example
,
2014
will
have
a
base
year
of
2004
.
one
can
compare
this
to
the
UK
position
,
which
be
base
not
on
a
incremental
position
but
on
all
research
and
development
spend
.
this
give
the
UK
a
comparative
advantage
so
we
should
consider
adopt
this
approach
.
if
there
be
a
new
minister
of
State
responsible
for
innovation
policy
,
I
assume
the
government
be
give
the
notion
of
intellectual
policy
and
innovation
some
degree
of
stature
.
a
gesture
such
as
this
would
assist
many
company
and
enterprise
throughout
the
country
which
be
increasingly
endeavour
to
heighten
research
and
development
spend
.
consider
the
matter
vis
-à
-
vis
foreign
direct
investment
and
its
current
unstable
nature
,
we
will
have
to
rely
on
many
indigenous
industry
.
much
work
be
be
do
within
university
and
third
level
institution
,
and
many
spin
-
off
company
be
establish
from
that
and
through
venture
capital
.
research
and
development
will
increasingly
be
a
component
of
this
process
so
we
should
incentivise
it
where
possible
.
fix
2003
as
the
base
year
rather
than
just
limit
the
credit
to
2013
would
have
provide
increase
certainty
and
would
have
be
a
more
favourable
measure
.
I
will
comment
on
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
and
the
relevance
of
this
Bill
to
such
a
constituency
,
where
unemployment
figure
be
rise
.
it
have
be
prove
that
in
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
,
Mitchelstown
,
Cobh
and
Midleton
,
the
figure
be
go
up
year
on
year
.
the
current
Amgen
issue
—
—
I
have
a
answer
to
a
parliamentary
question
which
clearly
prove
the
unemployment
figure
be
rise
.
I
can
make
they
available
to
the
Minister
of
State
if
he
so
wish
.
we
be
currently
lose
job
in
Cork
East
.
we
have
lose
traditional
industry
and
,
for
example
,
the
food
industry
be
not
what
it
once
be
and
be
go
into
decline
.
Irish
Sugar
be
no
long
with
we
and
Dairygold
be
downsizing
its
operation
.
there
be
increase
uncertainty
about
Amgen
.
in
try
to
be
positive
about
how
we
proceed
economically
and
take
north
and
east
Cork
as
a
region
,
if
a
similar
situation
become
evident
,
we
will
have
to
rely
on
indigenous
industry
.
the
government
must
proactively
seek
to
upskill
that
people
work
within
exist
industry
and
introduce
some
measure
for
employer
to
enable
they
to
upskill
and
grow
exist
company
.
there
be
many
family
-
base
company
in
this
town
and
I
be
sure
they
could
do
with
some
incentivisation
to
grow
.
the
government
should
consider
the
issue
give
the
current
global
economic
climate
.
I
be
not
advocate
look
inward
but
we
can
start
think
more
locally
about
how
to
provide
incentive
to
grow
job
.
this
be
the
essential
point
I
have
seek
to
cover
.
I
would
have
like
the
Finance
Bill
to
provide
for
some
composite
scheme
like
the
town
renewal
or
urban
renewal
scheme
.
towns
such
as
Mitchelstown
,
Mallow
and
,
to
a
less
extent
,
Fermoy
be
still
characterise
by
certain
area
where
development
have
not
keep
pace
with
corresponding
development
on
the
outskirt
of
town
.
the
government
could
be
in
a
position
to
consider
some
urban
renewal
scheme
or
a
adjunct
to
the
exist
programme
.
I
realise
a
Goodbody
report
on
the
performance
of
the
urban
renewal
scheme
be
publish
which
indicate
a
slow
take
-
up
in
some
aspect
of
the
scheme
.
the
climate
be
right
for
town
such
as
Mallow
,
Fermoy
and
Mitchelstown
to
benefit
from
that
scheme
so
we
could
get
rid
of
some
of
the
dereliction
still
exist
within
the
town
.
I
have
probably
use
much
less
than
11
minute
but
I
do
not
believe
in
fill
time
for
the
sake
of
it
.
I
have
cover
the
point
I
wish
to
make
and
other
which
I
could
expand
have
be
expound
upon
by
we
finance
spokesperson
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
take
my
comment
on
board
.
I
will
be
very
happy
to
make
the
figure
available
to
the
Minister
of
State
which
prove
beyond
any
doubt
that
unemployment
figure
have
increase
exponentially
in
this
town
.

I
thank
deputy
McManus
for
share
she
time
.
how
can
I
speak
for
Paul
Quinn
in
a
way
that
do
not
patronise
he
family
or
politicise
he
memory
?
how
can
I
,
who
do
not
know
he
personally
,
possibly
speak
in
a
manner
that
will
pay
adequate
tribute
to
he
independence
and
single
-
mindedness
that
ultimately
cost
he
he
life
?
I
can
only
speak
to
the
fact
that
neither
he
or
he
family
nor
the
community
of
Cullyhanna
have
receive
justice
.
if
we
be
to
subscribe
to
the
ideal
of
the
republic
and
all
the
belief
go
with
it
,
we
must
speak
up
for
Paul
Quinn
.
we
must
condemn
,
without
equivocation
,
he
murder
,
and
that
condemnation
must
come
from
all
facet
of
the
political
spectrum
.
if
there
be
that
who
seek
to
equivocate
,
they
must
reverse
they
position
.
if
this
island
,
which
have
leave
so
many
family
bereft
of
justice
,
be
to
move
on
we
must
hold
Paul
Quinn
up
as
a
example
that
justice
can
prevail
.
in
order
for
this
to
happen
,
that
in
the
shadow
must
be
root
out
and
take
responsibility
for
they
action
.
decision
on
any
necessary
action
to
be
take
by
the
Department
and
/
or
the
Commission
for
Energy
Regulation
as
a
consequence
of
any
change
to
the
UK

will
be
take
in
the
context
of
the
publication
by
the
Office
of
Gas
and
electricity
Market
(
OFGEM
)
,
of
revise
proposal
to
the
current
regime
.
the
publication
of
such
proposal
be

.
OFGEM
be
the
Office
of
the

Market
,
which
support
the
Gas
and
electricity
Market
Authority
(
GEMA
)
,
the
regulator
of
the
gas
and
electricity
industry
in
great
Britain
.
on
10
July
2007
,
the
U.K.
's
Competition
Commission
(
CC
)
quash
a
decision
by
the
GEMA
to
reform
the
gas
offtake
regime
for
great
Britain
's
high
-
pressure
National
Transmission
System
.
the
principal
initiative
behind
OFGEM
's
proposal
be
the
creation
of
a
"
user
commitment
"
model
,
require
all
shipper
who
offtake
at
a
UK
gas
transmission
network
exit
point
to
secure
sufficient
capacity
to
meet
they
need
3
-
7
year
in
advance
.
this
would
have
result
in
a
number
of
change
to
the
Irish
market
with
regard
to
the
booking
of
gas
capacity
from
the
Moffat
exit
point
of
the
interconnector
between
Scotland
and
Ireland
.
the
decision
be
currently
be
reconsider
by
OFGEM
,
have
regard
to
the
Competition
Commission
's
view
,
and
I
be
advise
that
revise
exit
reform
proposal
be
likely
to
be
publish
in
the
near
future
.
in
the
meantime
,
while
await
OFGEM
's
final
decision
,
the
cer
,
support
by
my
Department
,
have
take
a
proactive
approach
to
this
matter
,
and
both
be
in
regular
contact
with
Bord
Gáis
Éireann
and
with
we
UK
counterpart
in
relation
to
it
.
I
be
always
willing
to
allow
deputy
Perry
some
latitude
.
I
will
address
my
remark
specifically
to
domiciliary
care
allowance
.
the
timeframe
for
deal
with
application
for
the
allowance
be
too
lengthy
and
cause
undue
hardship
for
that
apply
in
respect
of
minor
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
in
the
HSE
south
area
expenditure
on
supplementary
welfare
allowance
which
form
part
of
the
rent
supplement
scheme
amount
to
€
43.56
million
in
2005
,
€
46.30
million
in
2006
and
€
49.21
million
in
2007
.
annual
increase
in
expenditure
in
this
area
would
be
unwarranted
if
the
government
be
do
its
job
and
deliver
a
adequate
social
housing
programme
.
every
year
the
number
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
who
contact
I
grow
exponentially
.
Rent
supplement
be
directly
link
to
the
increase
in
the
number
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
and
continue
to
cost
the
State
exorbitant
amount
every
year
.
the
money
expend
under
the
scheme
be
pocket
by
landlord
.
if
a
adequate
programme
for
deal
with
social
housing
be
in
place
,
the
expenditure
allocate
to
rent
supplement
could
be
redirect
to
more
needy
section
of
society
.
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
be
one
way
of
supplant
the
rent
supplement
scheme
.
my
party
advocate
a
"
begin
to
buy
"
approach
which
would
allow
more
people
to
move
from
social
housing
onto
the
housing
ladder
.
we
need
more
join
-
up
think
on
this
issue
.
while
the
supplementary
welfare
scheme
may
be
a
necessary
mechanism
in
the
short
term
,
we
must
examine
the
reason
expenditure
on
it
be
increase
every
year
.
more
and
more
people
be
be
force
onto
social
housing
waiting
list
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
I
have
be
inform
by
my
Department
that
compulsory
purchase
order
power
have
not
be
use
in
the
Department
from
2005
to

in

to
question
I
have
pose
to

respond
with
generality
which
leave
we
none
the
wise
.
I
have
tab
numerous
question
to
the
minister
on
the
future
of
the
hospital
,
the
appointment
of
a
executive
management
structure
,
the

,
and

scanner
that

in

room
for

on
the
issue
of
casemix
,
I
refer
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
400
on
30
January
2008
,
where
the
HSE
in
response
to
my
question
on
the
€
500000
cut
to
the
hospital
budget
state
:
Mallow
General
Hospital
have
receive
a
negative
casemix
adjustment
of
€
571233
for
2008
(
which
be
base
on
2006
activity
)
.
management
at
the
hospital
be
examine
the
underlying
cause
of
the
negative
casemix
adjustment
for
2008
and
a
rigorous
scrutiny
of
the
hospital
's
base
cost
will
be
carry
out
.
MGH
's
budget
have
be
cut
because
the
workload
of
the
hospital
have
be
under
measure
through
casemix
because
of
a
lack
of
clerical
staff
,
but
it
do
not
suit
the
HSE
to
admit
this
.
I
have
it
on
good
authority
that
only
95
%
of
MGH
's
workload
be
capture
.
the
HSE
's
official
line
be
that
the
budget
be
cut
because
of
"
inefficiency
"
.
nobody
dispute
that
MGH
's
budget
be
the
low
in
the
country
or
that
its
workload
be
great
than
many
comparable
hospital
.
how
be
it
then
that
its
budget
be
cut
?
I
refer
to
the
appointment
of
a
executive
management
board
.
why
have
Bantry
hospital
,
with
a
small
catchment
area
than
Mallow
,
a
emb
?
I
applaud
Bantry
hospital
in
this
regard
but
it
be
lucky
.
the
answer
I
receive
be
a
insult
to
the
people
I
represent
.
I
refer
to
Parliamentary
question
no.
119
of
31
January
2008
,
in
which
I
ask
about
the
make
up
and
reintroduction
of
the
executive
management
structure
.
in
its
reply
,
the
HSE
state
that
management
of
both
the
Cork
University
Hospital
group
and
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
keen
to
enhance
the
management
structure
at
the
hospital
and
have
over
the
past
several
month
be
work
with
the
HSE
's
performance
and
development
unit
to
facilitate
the
process
of
establish
a
executive
management
board
at
Mallow
hospital
.
it
continue
that
key
stakeholder
have
be
meet
on
a
one
-
to
-
one
basis
to
explore
concern
,
expectation
,
vision
for
the
future
and
development
need
,
that
discussion
be
ongoing
and
that
a
proposal
to
re-establish
the
executive
management
board
at
the
hospital
be
currently
be
finalise
.
accord
to
the
HSE
,
the
review
have
take
slightly
long
than
anticipate
because
its
scope
be
broaden
to
incorporate
community
-
base
service
and
to
allow
wide
consultation
with
key
stakeholder
,
include
medical
staff
from
the
Mallow
catchment
area
.
again
,
the
HSE
speak
in
generality
but
be
short
on
specifics
.
it
fail
to
acknowledge
that
a
executive
management
board
be
in
place
Mallow
General
Hospital
which
cease
to
operate
and
be
never
replace
.
as
for
its
assertion
that
there
be
a
consultation
with
key
stakeholder
,
this
be
stretch
the
truth
.
I
can
name
95
gps
who
be
key
stakeholder
in
the
area
but
be
never
consult
.
I
know
of
nobody
in
community
-
base
service
who
be
consult
.
which
key
stakeholder
and
medical
staff
from
the
Mallow
catchment
area
be
consult
?
what
do
the
HSE
regard
as
the
Mallow
catchment
area
?
in
the
same
reply
,
the
HSE
state
that
the
acute
hospital
service
review
in
HSE
south
will
determine
overall
governance
arrangement
.
to
whom
have
the
proposal
for
a
executive
management
board
for
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
send
?
on
the
issue
of
the
ct
scanner
,
which
be
also
address
in
the
reply
,
if
the
HSE
see
the
benefit
of
the
scanner
,
why
do
it
not
put
a
proper
management
plan
in
place
in
2005
?
we
be
concerned
for
the
future
of
the
hospital
and
that
the
acute
hospital
review
will
seek
to
downgrade
we
accident
and
emergency
service
,
postpone
further
appointment
when
current
surgical
term
of
employment
end
and
further
delay
the
building
of
a
day
procedure
unit
.
we
want
to
see
the
appointment
of
a
radiographer
because
we
have
wait
too
long
for
one
.
we
want
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
be
a
centre
of
excellence
for
secondary
care
.
we
be
proud
of
we
Hospital
.
if
the
HSE
persist
in
downgrade
the
hospital
by
stealth
,
we
will
protest
vigorously
.

in
the
five
minute
allocate
to
I
I
will
do
my
good
to
cover
the
issue
I
feel
be
pertinent
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
motion
and
to
support
it
unequivocally
.
I
wish
to
address
a
number
of
general
point
relate
to
the
national
broadband
scheme
,
the
lack
of
roll
-
out
of
broadband
to
rural
area
and
the
need
for
the
government
to
adopt
a
universal
service
obligation
similar
to
that
which
exist
for
postal
and
telephony
service
.
with
regard
to
a
universal
service
obligation
,
on
7
February
last
I
receive
a
letter
from
the
Commission
for
Communication
Regulation
follow
representation
by
I
on
the
issue
of
inadequate
or
no
broadband
provision
in
village
such
as
Ballyhooly
and
Glanworth
.
I
speak
of
this
village
because
they
be
typical
of
many
rural
area
throughout
the
country
.
I
be
tell
in
this
letter
that
ComReg
impose
certain
obligation
on
Eircom
but
this
obligation
stretch
only
to
the
rights
of
a
citizen
to
a
functional
telephone
line
,
capable
of
carry
voice
and
datum
over
28.8
kbit
.
while
this
obligation
might
have
satisfied
the
Ireland
of
20
or
even
ten
year
ago
,
it
no
long
go
far
enough
in
term
of
provide
adequate
telecomumication
to
the
Ireland
of
today
.
Universal
service
obligation
broadband
must
be
enshrine
in
legislation
as
a
entitlement
.
the
politician
of
my
parent
's
generation
make
representation
on
matter
relate
to
the
provision
of
telephone
when
no
one
could
get
access
to
a
telephone
line
.
politician
of
my
generation
make
representation
on
the
issue
of
broadband
,
when
part
of
this
country
be
bereft
of
what
be
now
consider
a
essential
service
.
that
people
of
my
generation
be
be
tell
that
next
generation
network
be
be
roll
out
when
people
live
beyond
the
Pale
be
still
use
dial
-
up
and
can
only
rely
on
that
narrow
bandwidth
be
a
joke
when
the
average
modem
for
a
computer
be
56
kbit
.
a
regional
disparity
exist
and
it
have
a
negative
effect
both
socially
and
economically
for
that
live
in
rural
area
which
be
not
cover
.
the
admission
by
ComReg
that
a
universal
service
obligation
apply
under
EU
regulation
only
for
the
provision
of
telephone
and
not
in
respect
of
broadband
bely
a
serious
flaw
in
the
system
.
every
citizen
should
have
a
entitlement
to
broadband
in
the
same
way
they
have
entitlement
to
a
operational
phone
line
.
consequently
,
I
propose
a
review
similar
to
that
carry
out
by
the
European
Commission
in
2005
which
would
result
in
a
legislative
change
and
give
a
voice
to
the
thousand
of
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
deny
access
to
what
be
a
essential
service
by
today
's
standard
.
the
broadband
availability
map
find
on
the
Department
's
website
simply
do
not
reflect
the
situation
on
the

St.

the

obviously
have
not

the
two
objective
be
not

exclusive
.
I
will
bring
the

to
some
rural
school
in
my
constituency
.
why
do
parent
constantly
have
to
fund
-
raise
to

cost
of

child
?
capitation
grant
be
be

water
and

.
the
deputy
should
visit
rural
area
to
see
how
real
people
live
and
parent
struggle
.
I
thank
deputy
Lynch
for
she
excellent
time
keep
.
I
hope
what
I
have
to
say
will
be
equally
and
not
more
important
than
what
she
say
in
she
contribution
.
the
government
state
last
night
,
in
the
course
of
this
debate
,
that
in
2008
the
Department
of
Education
and
Science
will
pay
€
167
million
to
primary
school
to
cover
day
-
to
-
day
running
cost
and
that
a
€
21
increase
to
€330
per
pupil
mean
primary
school
receive
unprecedented
level
of
funding
per
pupil
to
meet
running
cost
.
this
bely
a
fundamental
lack
of
understanding
of
the
true
nature
of
educational
provision
as
we
citizen
understand
it
,
as
the
parent
understand
it
,
and
as
the
principal
and
teacher
understand
it
.
when
a
parent
send
a
child
to
school
,
a
unwritten
social
contract
that
be
enshrine
within
the
Irish
psyche
be
enter
into
that
the
child
will
receive
the
good
education
possible
.
that
social
contract
be
not
on
the
basis
that
the
parent
must
also
fundraise
,
take
part
in
raffle
,
sing
karaoke
,
hillwalk
,
play
bingo
and
join
in
pub
quizze
so
that
the
child
can
have
the
benefit
of
water
,
electricity
and
a
myriad
other
service
within
they
school
.
in
real
economic
term
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
school
have
increase
considerably
in
recent
year
and
the
burden
now
face
by
school
to
meet
this
additional
cost
ultimately
place
a
further
financial
strain
on
parent
of
child
who
find
themselves
fundraising
for
school
on
a
constant
basis
.
Educational
provision
should
not
have
to
be
subject
to
this
form
of
pressure
.
it
be
enough
for
any
school
in
this
time
to
have
to
educate
and
educate
alone
.
that
in
itself
remain
the
fundamental
challenge
and
,
arguably
,
it
should
be
the
only
challenge
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
government
have
increase
the
capitation
grant
since
1997
.
however
,
by
double
the
capitation
grant
now
,
it
do
not
have
to
come
at
the
expense
of
provide
extra
teacher
,
a
theory
which
have
be
posit
elsewhere
in
this
debate
,
and
somewhat
disingenuously
.
the
logic
of
we
position
be
to
ensure
that
the
headache
of
maintenance
and
run
cost
be
take
away
from
all
school
so
that
they
can
concentrate
on
provide
education
and
continue
,
in
certain
instance
,
to
do
battle
with
the
minister
on
the
capital
programme
for
the
provision
of
adequate
school
building
in
place
such
as
Castlelyons
,
Rahan
,
Grange
and
Midleton
where
no
proper
building
have
be
provide
for
considerable
period
.
not
only
have
school
to
raise
fund
,
they
also
be
operate
in
substandard
building
.
this
be
the
reason
the
Labour
Party
be
raise
this
issue
.
if
the
capitation
grant
be
increase
,
it
will
at
least
take
some
of
that
pressure
away
.

I
welcome
the
reply
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
my
response
will
be
very
brief
.
do
the
feps
encourage
the
growth
of
native
woodland
?
will
the
minister
of
State
potentially
consider
a
additional
premium
for
that
farmer
,
landowner
or
forestry
owner
who
wish
to
grow
more
forestry
on
the
basis
that
it
would
reduce
co2
emission
for
this
country
?
perhaps
a
additional
premium
could
be
give
to
that
farmer
who
be
not
already
grow
forestry
but
who
may
potentially
embark
on
grow
it
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
but
there
be
potential
to
give
a
further
premium
purely
on
the
basis
there
be
room
to
have
carbon
off
-
setting
,
for
want
of
a
good
expression
.
there
be
major
scope
for
the
private
sector
to
become
involved
in
forestry
.
as
I
understand
it
,
to
date
there
be
less
than
20
%
involvement
of
the
private
sector
in
forestry
and
it
be
a
area
of
agribusiness
that
have
even
more
potential
.
I
be
not
convince
the
€
7600
per
hectare
payment
,
the
maximum
,
be
adequate
give
that
one
would
have
to
operate
on
large
economy
of
scale
in
order
to
get
some
sort
of
a
decent
return
.
many
small
forestry
owner
do
not
currently
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
thin
back
forest
to
allow
for
great
potential
.
the
cost
of
thinning
and
maintenance
would
eat
into
the
premium
.
we
be
try
to
make
a
case
,
in
essence
,
for
more
grant
aid
or
financial
incentive
to
be
provide
.
will
the
minister
of
State
consider
that
?
perhaps
we
should
consult
the
church
on
this
matter
.
it
be
a
ecumenical
matter
.
that
be
a
cod
if
I
ever
hear
one
.
it
be
rubbish
.
I
suppose
the
Minister
of
State
's
next
press
release
will
be
expound
the
virtue
of
organic
manure
.
the
chicken
be
come
home
to
roost
follow
the
loss
of
IFI
,
which
have
result
in
increase
cost
for
import
fertiliser
.
we
do
not
know
the
exact
content
of
fertiliser
import
from
third
country
because
there
be
no
policing
of
urea
and
other
content
.
the
Department
should
put
in
place
some
policing
mechanism
to
ensure
the
content
be
what
it
say
on
the
tin
.
this
have
permutation
for
grower
and
crop
production
generally
.
what
about
third
country
?
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
proposal
to
reduce
to
two
from
three
the
number
of
consultant
operate
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
result
in
a
dramatic
reduction
in
surgical
service
from
seven
day
to
five
day
with
the
further
increase
in
the
workload
of
Cork
University
Hospital
;
and
the
need
to
debate
the
fact
that
this
decision
be
take
without
prior
consultation
with
staff
at
either
hospital
,
the
net
result
be
a
increase
in
number
present
to
CUH
,
which
be
ill
-
equip
to
deal
with
the
increase
throughput
,
and
the
potential
increase
in
the
danger
to
that
serve
in
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
the
provision
of
broadband
service
be
,
in
the
first
instance
,
a
matter
for
the
private
sector
.
Broadband
service
provider
operate
in
a
fully
liberalise
market
,
regulate
,
where
appropriate
,
by
the
independent
Commission
for
Communication
Regulation
,
ComReg
.
the
role
of
the
government
be
to
formulate
regulatory
and
infrastructure
policy
to
facilitate
the
provision
of
high
quality
telecomumication
service
by
compete
private
sector
service
provider
.
the
widespread
provision
of
broadband
service
continue
to
be
a
priority
for
the
government
.
in
that
regard
my
Department
have
undertake
initiative
to
address
the
gap
in
broadband
coverage
.
this
include
provide
grant
-
aid
under
the
recently
conclude
Group
Broadband
Scheme
(
GBS
)
and
investment
in
Metropolitan
Area
Network
(
MANs
)
.
although
broadband
be
now
widely
available
in
Ireland
there
be
still
some
part

I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Ó
Caoláin
and
Bannon
.
in
response
to
the
Minister
present
,
it
be
fair
to
say
that
we
all
have
this
country
's
interest
at
heart
.
in
term
of
the
debate
that
have
be
facilitate
by
this
House
,
it
be
right
,
proper
and
pertinent
that
Opposition
Member
would
hold
the
government
to
account
on
its
position
vis-à
-
vo
the
WTO
negotiation
and
that
the
government
would
not
take
any
pertinent
question
from
this
side
of
the
House
as
a
slight
,
give
that
we
all
have
as
we
good
interest
the
future
interest
of
Irish
agriculture
and
Irish
agribusiness
.
by
way
of
response
to
the
speech
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Coughlan
,
I
wish
to
clear
up
the
notion
that
she
seem
to
convey
on
the
issue
of
the
single
farm
payment
.
it
be
we
clear
understanding
that
to
convey
the
impression
somehow
that
the
single
farm
payment
will
be
undermine
and
that
she
be
endeavour
to
save
they
under
the
WTO
agreement
under
the
green
box
issue
,
be
something
of
a
misnomer
.
my
understanding
be
that
they
be
not
part
of
the
WTO
negotiation
in
any
event
and
to
say
they
be
convey
the
wrong
impression
.
the
fundamental
question
that
we
must
ask
ourselves
today
be
what
the
Doha
Round
will
mean
for
Irish
agriculture
and
for
farm
family
who
form
the
bedrock
of
we
rural
society
.
the
WTO
be
inform
by
a
modus
operandi
that
seek
,
with
the
World
Bank
and
the
IMF
,
a
global
market
devoid
of
trade
barrier
.
since
2001
,
at
Doha
,
the
WTO
have
embark
on
a
strategy
of
liberalisation
of
global
trade
result
in
a
view
,
by
country
such
as
we
own
and
,
I
might
add
,
poorer
country
,
that
the
indiscriminate
liberalisation
agenda
will
be
detrimental
to
we
interest
and
the
interest
of
poorer
country
seek
to
raise
they
economic
output
.
for
the
purpose
of
analyse
the
government
's
amendment
to
this
motion
,
there
be
absolutely
nothing
in
its
response
that
would
give
solace
to
the
thousand
of
farmer
who
today
have
to
leave
they
homestead
in
the
quest
to
have
they
voice
hear
.
we
critique
of
the
current
Doha
round
be
simple
.
the
WTO
be
not
on
the
correct
path
to
deliver
worldwide
economic
prosperity
.
it
will
not
raise
the
economic
tide
of
all
comer
and
,
from
this
island
's
point
of
view
,
will
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
rural
economy
and
agricultural
sector
.
moreover
,
it
will
decimate
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
to
which
we
all
subscribe
and
which
have
be
negotiate
by
a
process
of
pool
sovereignty
of
EU
member
state
through
many
year
of
diplomacy
.
all
of
we
recognise
the
primacy
of
agricultural
negotiation
and
this
sector
have
become
a
easy
target
for
the
EU
Commission
in
its
quest
to
gain
concession
on
a
neoliberal
trade
agenda
because
of
the
subsidisation
of
agriculture
.
we
view
be
simple
.
to
use
develop
country
as
a
bargain
chip
to
unravel
CAP
be
a
disingenuous
argument
and
one
to
which
we
do
not
subscribe
.
it
be
we
analysis
that
concession
will
be
fight
for
on
agricultural
issue
as
a
substitute
for
agreement
on
the
liberalisation
of
service
.
develop
country
rightly
argue
that
it
be
unfair
to
expect
they
to
open
they
market
on
service
while
clear
barrier
to
entry
exist
amongst
developed
country
on
the
provision
of
service
.
the
key
worry
for
service
liberalisation
be
what
it
mean
for
the
ability
to
regulate
foreign
service
-
base
company
operate
in
less
developed
region
.
furthermore
,
the
availability
of
micro-credit
in
Africa
have
have
the
positive
effect
of
lift
ten
of
million
of
small
farmer
out
of
poverty
.
a
agrarian
revolution
be
take
place
in
Africa
about
which
one
will
not
hear
on
radio
or
tv
.
we
concern
be
that
the
growth
of
urban
population
in
Africa
,
which
be
feed
through
the
rural
African
economy
,
may
be
compromise
in
the
quest
to
achieve
a
rate
of
liberalisation
,
which
may
be
detrimental
to
they
economic
interest
.
therein
lie
the
comparison
with
the
Irish
farmer
.
while
the
Irish
farmer
rely
on
the
subsidisation
of
agriculture
,
the
African
farmer
rely
on
a
new
system
of
micro-credit
which
may
allow
he
to
survive
,
and
even
in
time
,
flourish
.
in
that
context
,
Ireland
and
develop
country
be
unite
in
they
opposition
to
the
Doha
round
,
albeit
for
differ
reason
.
to
state
that
we
interest
be
somehow
detrimental
to
that
of
develop
country
be
a
naked
lie
which
must
be
firmly
nail
.
to
say
that
we
be
be
protectionist
and
self
-
interested
be
true
.
we
should
not
be
afraid
to
state
that
we
as
a
nation
must
ensure
the
primacy
of
agriculture
as
a
integral
part
of
we
society
and
any
attempt
to
diminish
hard
-
fight
gain
on
CAP
must
be
resist
at
ministerial
level
.
a
fair
global
trading
system
be
something
we
all
want
.
any
agreement
should
also
encompass
bilateral
deal
in
which
the
EU
be
engage
,
particularly
with
the
poor
and
most
vulnerable
economy
through
economic
partnership
agreement
.
as
we
in
Ireland
look
at
the
potential
cost
of
cut
in
tariff
,
the
poor
country
be
be
ask
to
eliminate
more
than
80
%
of
they
tariff
by
the
EU
.
there
be
no
equity
in
that
proposal
which
signal
a
bad
deal
for
both
develop
country
and
developed
country
such
as
Ireland
.
Global
food
security
be
a
issue
that
not
only
effect
that
who
be
more
prone
to
adverse
weather
condition
but
also
this
island
.
if
it
advance
,
this
deal
will
compromise
the
food
security
of
this
nation
.
the
African
farmer
may
also
be
leave
with
a
stark
choice
if
this
process
be
to
succeed
as
envisage
by
the
EU
Commission
.
the
African
farmer
may
find
himself
at
the
end
of
a
trade
liberalisation
agenda
that
force
he
to
buy
he
seed
from
a
conglomerate
such
as
Monsanto
,
thereby
risk
he
livelihood
,
chain
he
to
another
form
of
bond
labour
and
potentially
compromise
he
biodiversity
.
Doha
and
the
WTO
fail
to
consider
the
cultural
and
societal
permutation
of
ram
this
deal
down
we
throat
.
if
it
succeed
,
we
can
wave
goodbye
to
a
traditional
way
of
live
.
that
farmer
who
be
able
to
acquire
more
land
and
develop
economy
of
scale
will
flourish
and
the
traditional
farm
family
will
no
long
exist
.
I
may
be
accuse
of
expound
rhetoric
but
the
implication
of
this
deal
will
be
a
flight
from
the
land
.
this
will
be
due
to
the
influx
of
cheap
import
devoid
of
any
control
,
standard
or
traceability
.
the
Doha
round
be
predicate
on
a
globalisation
agenda
.
it
rely
on
unrestricted
global
market
force
.
in
this
scenario
,
transnational
corporation
will
commandeer
advantageous
term
of
trade
.
small
local
interest
will
no
long
be
able
to
secure
,
control
or
protect
market
share
.
co-operative
will
be
swallow
up
by
large
food
multiple
and
the
"
tescofication
"
of
agriculture
will
become
the
norm
.
when
this
large
food
multiple
control
the
means
of
production
,
they
will
control
the
price
the
consumer
pay
and
the
price
the
producer
derive
.
we
have
already
arrive
at
this
scenario
,
albeit
on
a
small
scale
.
the
structure
of
a
unaccountable
WTO
rule
-
make
militate
against
the
small
producer
,
be
he
or
she
European
or
African
.
the
structure
give
a
advantage
to
large
corporation
and
foreign
direct
investor
at
the
cost
of
weaken
the
traditional
equity
-
orientate
economic
programme
such
as
CAP
,
from
which
we
as
a
island
have
benefit
.
if
the
rule
govern
ownership
of
company
be
change
,
we
will
not
see
a
company
from
a
less
developed
region
acquire
a
firm
from
a
developed
country
.
I
think
I
have
15
minute
.
have
I
already
reach
the
15
-
minute
mark
?
I
be
only
at
ten
minute
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
in
reality
,
this
shoddy
proposal
will
bring
major
change
in
the
market
structure
of
develop
country
in
term
of
ownership
.
it
be
we
view
that
trade
liberalisation
will
transform
subsistence
farming
into
arid
export
monoculture
,
stifle
the
power
of
micro-credit
and
put
poor
country
at
the
mercy
of
western
country
such
as
the
US
.
furthermore
,
the
price
sensitivity
of
market
will
be
more
keenly
feel
.
in
essence
,
the
WTO
proposal
as
they
currently
stand
be
overly
ambitious
in
term
of
trade
liberalisation
and
rule
implementation
.
develop
country
,
as
well
as
this
country
,
rightly
fear
that
they
have
nothing
to
gain
from
this
deal
.
we
feel
that
we
have
make
enough
concession
and
have
gain
nothing
in
return
.
if
this
be
the
case
,
it
be
then
clear
that
the
process
have
fail
both
ourselves
and
less
developed
country
and
be
,
therefore
,
unworkable
in
its
current
term
.
contiguous
to
the
analysis
arrive
at
in
recent
week
be
the
notion
that
perhaps
no
deal
be
good
than
a
bad
deal
.
this
be
something
that
need
to
be
tease
out
in
great
detail
.
the
EU
Commission
agenda
be
detrimental
to
both
Irish
agriculture
and
agriculture
in
develop
country
.
the
Irish
farming
position
be
one
which
have
genuine
fear
about
cut
to
beef
and
dairy
tariff
.
the
question
be
whether
enough
support
be
evident
at
Council
of
Minister
level
for
such
a
cut
.
if
this
be
the
case
,
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
have
question
to
answer
about
whether
she
feel
this
be
a
tenable
position
and
if
not
,
what
she
counter
argument
be
and
if
there
be
a
sufficient
block
minority
to
force
a
rethink
on
this
deal
.
there
be
no
grounds
for
believe
that
Pascal
Lamy
can
push
through
a
deal
ahead
of
the
meeting
of
Agriculture
Minister
on
19
May
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
Doha
agenda
be
unpopular
and
there
be
question
mark
over
whether
the
end
of
the
Bush
regime
in
the
US
will
signal
any
mood
for
a
deal
in
advance
of
a
new
president
be
appoint
.
it
be
we
view
that
,
while
guarantee
food
security
for
EU
citizen
be
a
priority
and
this
can
well
be
achieve
through
a
combination
of
support
EU
food
production
and
through
import
set
in
the
framework
of
the
WTO
rule
,
this
food
security
also
depend
on
the
EU
's
contribution
to
the
building
up
of
world
stock
,
which
be
today
dramatically
low
.
this
allow
the
EU
not
only
to
protect
itself
against
shortage
but
also
to
take
responsibility
with
regards
to
global
food
security
.
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
need
to
protect
the
farmer
of
Europe
,
include
Irish
farmer
,
against
a
liberalisation
agenda
that
will
ultimately
compromise
Irish
comparative
advantage
in
both
the
beef
and
dairy
sector
and
will
add
nothing
of
value
to
develop
country
's
term
of
trade
.
we
view
be
one
which
unashamedly
seek
to
protect
the
national
interest
.
in
seek
to
do
so
,
we
be
protect
we
economy
,
particularly
the
rural
economy
,
and
a
way
of
life
that
be
under
threat
.
Commissioner
Mandelson
have
a
agenda
which
be
incongruous
with
the
found
principle
of
the
European
Union
on
issue
of
subsidiarity
and
its
position
as
a
community
-
base
trading
bloc
.
we
be
now
leave
with
a
appalling
scenario
whereby
the
Mandelson
agenda
be
totally
at
variance
with
that
of
certain
member
of
the
Council
of
Minister
,
include
we
minister
.
the
commission
must
take
its
mandate
from
the
Council
of
Minister
.
it
must
not
exceed
its
mandate
.
it
be
a
supra-national
organisation
and
it
must
derive
its
negotiating
stance
from
the
minister
and
she
colleague
.
the
minister
have
a
hard
task
,
therefore
,
in
build
the
alliance
of
interest
that
be
necessary
to
protect
we
interest
.
we
cannot
and
must
not
trade
away
the
rural
economy
at
a
time
when
other
sector
of
the
economy
have
be
undermine
.
the
agribusiness
sector
be
the
one
that
have
remain
constant
through
thick
and
thin
throughout
the
history
of
the
State
.
it
be
the
sector
that
will
always
be
there
.
if
we
be
to
trade
away
the
concession
that
have
be
hard
win
through
tough
negotiation
and
diplomacy
,
all
that
concession
will
have
be
in

no
confidence
''
would
be
place
in
the
management
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
the
management
would
have
proceed
with
the
decision
without
a
''
by
you
leave
''
.
because
of
the
action
,
the
furore
,
and
the
amount
of
public
protest
as
a
result
of
the
decision
,
the
HSE
have
state
that
it
be
in
a
position
to
fill
the
post
with
a
locum
consultant
until
the
end
of
May
.
we
have
no
commitment
in
write
that
the
HSE
be
intent
on
the
continuation
of
a
third
surgical
position
at
Mallow
.
we
fear
the
intention
of
the
HSE
and
the
minister
to
downgrade
we
hospital
and
reduce
by
stealth
the
number
of
surgical
post
in
the
hospital
,
thereby
reduce
the
accident
and
emergency
service
and
funnel
everything
to
CUH
which
,
if
one
believe
the
HSE
,
be
the
new
Jerusalem
in
the
south
and
will
solve
all
we
ill
.
we
believe
the
process
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
life
of
the
100000
people
in
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
have
a
adverse
effect
on
medical
outcome
.
CUH
be
ill
-
equip
to
deal
with
the
extra
work
load
this
development
will
entail
.
I
call
on
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
guarantee
in
writing
that
Mallow
,
as
a
secondary
care
facility
,
will
continue
as
the
centre
of
excellence
that
it
be
,
that
the
100
gps
refer
patient
to
the
hospital
will
have
the
accident
and
emergency
cover
they
need
and
that
there
will
be
three
surgeon
or
more
to
provide
the
service
to
more
than
100000
people
who
require
it
.
we
also
want
to
ensure
that
the
hospital
—
a
excellent
facility
—
go
from
strength
to
strength
and
will
not
be
downgrade
any
further
.
we
demand
a
clear
commitment
in
writing
from
the
HSE
,
that
it
will
ensure
the
continuation
of
a
third
surgical
position
so
that
we
can
deliver
service
to
we
people
on
the
ground
.
we
have
no
confidence
in
the
current
management
system
because
we
have
listen
to
promise
on
the
roll
-
out
of
a
ct
scanner
,
which
have
be
idle
for
more
than
three
year
.
we
have
no
radiologist
in
the
hospital
,
which
be
promise
.
we
have
no
executive
management
board
,
which
be
promise
and
for
which
the
HSE
state
it
would
embark
on
a
consultation
process
.
the
dog
on
the
street
know
that
a
15
minute
consultation
with
one
or
two
gps
do
not
constitute
a
consultation
in
we
book
.
we
call
for
the
instigation
of
a
executive
management
board
so
that
we
can
call
into
question
any
decision
on
the
future
of
the
hospital
and
examine
and
provide
a
audit
report
of
any
accounting
procedure
relate
to
the
hospital
.
we
want
to
see
a
centre
of
excellence
at
Mallow
.
it
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
outcome
of
patient
in
the
region
and
we
will
oppose
vehemently
any
attempt
by
the
HSE
to
downgrade
service
.
we
want
to
see
firm
commitment
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
to
see
the
third
post
instigate
in
perpetuity
so
that
the
people
of
the
region
can
have
a
proper
standard
of
care
,
and
excellent
care
at
that
.
the
Minister
of
State
do
not
address
one
point
that
I
raise
and
it
be
a
insult
to
the
people
of
the
region
that
a
minister
of
State
can
give
such
a
bland
reply
in
the
House
.
it
make
a
mockery
of
the
House
,
with
all
due
respect
.
my

I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Broughan
.
most
of
the
argument
in
this
debate
have
be
well
thrash
out
and
I
will
not
repeat
point
that
have
already
be
make
and
that
I
support
.
I
be
in
favour
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
and
will
vote
for
it
.
I
work
in
the
European
Parliament
for
three
year
and
,
though
it
be
a
august
institution
,
the
first
12
month
of
my
time
there
be
spend
seek
to
interpret
the
Byzantine
language
that
emanate
from
it
.
this
be
a
issue
for
ordinary
citizen
of
the
European
Union
who
find
it
hard
to
interpret
national
legislation
at
the
good
of
time
,
never
mind
European
treaty
and
some
of
the
language
use
therein
.
this
have
negative
consequence
for
the
relationship
citizen
have
with
the
European
Union
and
term
like
"
co-decision
"
and
"
subsidiarity
"
may
be
example
of
language
use
in
a
manner
that
be
sometimes
deliberately
design
to
obfuscate
or
confuse
people
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
my
experience
of
the
European
Union
have
lead
I
to
see
it
as
a
positive
force
.
I
grow
up
in
Ireland
in
the
1980
and
1990
and
transfer
from
the
European
Union
help
member
of
family
like
mine
to
attend
college
and
benefit
from
the
European
social
Fund
.
I
be
able
to
get
a
grant
for
third
level
education
.
the
investment
in
education
through
the
fund
help
thousand
of
people
of
my
age
who
,
otherwise
,
may
not
have
benefit
from
a
third
level
education
.
neither
would
we
have
see
the
resultant
economic
benefit
derive
by
this
country
.
this
be
,
however
,
more
of
a
historic
context
.
what
be
need
be
a
simplification
of
the
language
use
in
EU
document
.
the
treaty
should
be
vote
for
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
incorporate
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
,
a
simplify
document
that
codify
the
rights
of
EU
citizen
.
whether
one
be
from
Ballyhooly
or
Budapest
,
one
be
a
citizen
of
the
European
Union
and
,
therefore
,
one
's
rights
be
guarantee
by
this
provision
.
the
problem
encounter
by
people
in
this
country
be
exactly
the
same
as
by
that
in
other
country
.
we
rights
should
be
as
inalienable
as
that
in
other
member
state
.
I
speak
as
a
Republican
and
subscribe
to
the
ideal
of
this
republic
.
no
provision
in
the
treaty
be
at
variance
with
any
of
this
ideal
.
everything
enshrine
in
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
give
succour
to
that
ideal
of
egalitarian
principle
and
seek
to
ensure
every
citizen
have
a
define
set
of
rights
.
that
be
the
most
important
issue
.
the
farming
organisation
have
state
a
position
on
the
referendum
ves
-à
-
vo
the
WTO
negotiation
.
while
I
be
sympathetic
to
they
argument
,
I
would
not
advocate
a
vote
against
the
Lisbon
treaty
on
the
basis
of
a
argument
over
the
WTO
negotiation
.
the
treaty
will
broaden
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
through
enhance
co-decision
procedure
.
the
Council
of
Minister
it
would
seem
have
sway
over
agricultural
decision
affect
this
country
.
if
the
power
of
the
agricultural
committee
of
the
European
Parliament
be
broaden
and
national
parliament
be
give
a
great
say
in
transpose
EU
legislation
,
the
voice
of
Irish
agriculture
will
be
strengthen
and
have
more
power
on
decision
affect
it
.
it
be
important
to
note
we
have
have
little
in
transparency
on
the
decision
make
at
EU
ministerial
council
level
.
I
would
bet
any
money
that
if
the
attendance
record
for
EU
Council
meeting
be
check
,
Irish
minister
would
be
note
for
a
fair
degree
of
absenteeism
.
Little
information
be
available
publicly
as
to
what
go
on
at
this
meeting
.
return
to
the
demise
of
the
Irish
sugar
industry
,
a
deal
be
hammer
out
at
European
level
yet
we
do
not
know
what
happen
on
that
fateful
night
in
November
2005
at
the
relevant
EU
Council
meeting
.
we
do
not
know
what
minister
take
what
decision
or
what
be
say
.
the
treaty
will
make
every
Council
of
Minister
meeting
more
transparent
.
I
welcome
this
and
it
will
allow
we
to
know
what
we
minister
and
the
permanent
representation
be
do
in
Brussels
.
when
the
Convention
on
the
Future
of
Europe
be
hold
first
,
the
imposition
of
Valéry
Giscard
d'Estaing
probably
set
a
negative
tone
.
there
be
a
large
-
state
view
on
how
the
propose
EU
constitution
should
proceed
with
the
large
member
state
seek
to
control
the
agenda
.
I
do
not
blame
small
member
state
for
kick
over
the
trace
.
there
be
a
clear
modus
operandi
of
seek
to
impose
a
certain
set
of
value
in
the
constitution
.
I
be
glad
this
have
be
roll
back
and
its
replacement
be
a
treaty
.
the
ideal
of
the
constitution
have
be
simplify
in
the
treaty
.
if
the
treaty
give
more
power
to
the
European
Parliament
,
it
give
more
power
to
the
people
of
Europe
.
if
it
give
more
to
national
parliament
,
it
give
more
power
to
we
as
Irish
citizen
to
have
a
say
in
how
the
European
Parliament
proceed
on
any
legislative
matter
,
which
can
only
be
welcome
.
the
treaty
also
put
in
place
further
check
and
balance
against
the
commission
,
a
necessary
mechanism
.
EU
commissioner
such
as
Frit
Bolkestein
have
be
hell
-
bend
on
a
liberalisation
agenda
.
some
from
a
left
-
wing
perspective
will
oppose
the
Lisbon
treaty
because
of
that
very
agenda
.
I
contend
we
should
agree
with
the
treaty
so
that
check
and
balance
can
be
put
in
place
against
that
neoliberal
agenda
.
it
be
also
a
agenda
for
which
we
own
commissioner
,
Charlie
McCreevy
,
have
be
a
strong
advocate
and
have
do
we
no
favour
in
that
regard
.
I
support
the
Lisbon
treaty
.
while
it
be
not
perfect
,
on
balance
we
will
derive
far
more
benefit
than
negative
from
it
.
I
welcome
this
debate
and
I
wholeheartedly
support
the
motion
,
which
call
for
some
simple
,
pragmatic
solution
to
a
problem
that
afflict
the
10000
and
more
people
who
be
affect
by
acquire
brain
injury
.
the
motion
also
request
the
establishment
of
a
regional
network
of
rehabilitation
facility
and
service
to
be
establish
in
the
context
of
a
national
rehabilitation
strategy
.
the
response
from
the
government
side
offer
nothing
that
would
provide
comfort
or
encouragement
to
that
suffer
from
acquire
brain
injury
in
the
context
of
address
they
need
.
there
be
a
regional
disparity
in
the
delivery
of
health
care
.
if
one
live
in
Cork
,
Kerry
,
Galway
or
Donegal
,
one
be
already
at
a
disadvantage
if
one
suffer
with
a
acquire
brain
injury
.
the
disparity
to
which
I
refer
must
be
address
as
a
matter
of
urgency
.
not
only
do
this
disparity
exist
in
the
area
of
health
,
it
be
also
prevalent
in
the
economy
and
in
the
government
's
regional
policy
.
I
recently
make
representation
to
a
neurologist
on
behalf
of
a
person
with
a
acquire
brain
injury
.
he
confide
in
I
that
if
he
be
to
close
the
door
of
he
practice
tomorrow
,
he
would
have
sufficient
client
to
deep
he
in
business
for
the
next
two
year
.
that
illustrate
the
seriousness
of
this
issue
.
that
on
the
government
side
state
that
the
development
of
a
new
rehabilitation
centre
be
at
the
planning
stage
and
that
this
will
hopefully
be
up
and
run
by
2012
.
that
assertion
do
not
provide
any
grounds
for
confidence
.
the
motion
before
the
House
call
for
a
increase
in
the
number
of
approve
post
for
consultant
neurologist
from
24
to
42
.
such
a
development
would
almost
,
if
not
quite
,
bring
we
up
to
a
standard
which
obtain
in
other
European
country
and
would
represent
a
immeasurable
improvement
on
the
exist
position
.
what
we
be
ultimately
concerned
with
be
people
's
dignity
.
there
be
that
who
have
no
access
to
the
service
of
which
they
should
be
able
to
avail
as
a
matter
of
right
.
this
individual
will
gain
no
comfort
from
what
be
be
say
by
that
on
the
government
side
because
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
sense
of
urgency
about
this
matter
.
the
Labour
Party
be
request
that
there
be
such
a
sense
of
urgency
in
order
to
preserve
people
's
dignity
and
give
they
the
right
to
a
standard
of
health
care
they
tax
euro
should
afford
they
.
be
they
resident
in
Dublin
or
the
region
,
they
should
be
treat
as
equal
.
that
be
what
we
be
call
for
in
this
debate
.
I
monitor
current
expenditure
in
my
Department
on
a
ongoing
basis
to
ensure
it
remain
within
the
parameter
allocate
in
my

's

and
to
ensure
that
efficient

.
at
the
end
of
March
current
expenditure
be
in

with

I
expect

in
my

I
note
the
Taoiseach
's
use
of
the
expression
"
departmental
silo
"
,
which
be
new
to
I
.
the
legislative
silo
,
as
it
pertain
to
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
be
fairly
empty
.
the

feature
three
Bills
for

,

of
which
be
the
animal

and

Bill
.
I
have
be
inundate
recently
—
—
I
ask
for
a
little
latitude
.
I
be
come
to
the
question
.
I
have
be
inundate
with
correspondence
from
representative
of
Compassion
in
World
Farming
on
the
defeat
Fur
Farming
(
Prohibition
)
Bill
2004
,
which
be
,
I
understand
,
introduce
by
the
Green
Party
during
the
previous
government
's
term
in
office
.
will
the
relevant
provision
feature
in
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
?
when
will
the
legislation
come
before
the
House
?
on
the
scarcity
of
global
food
supplies
,
give
the
lack
of
government
initiative
in
this
area
,
it
would
be
pertinent
to
have
a
debate
on
the
issue
.
the
delivery
of
commitment
by
a
Post
in
regard
to

issue
at

in
the
past
24
hour
we
have
hear
much
from
the
government
side
about
the
ESRI
report
.
if
I
be
a
construction
worker
or
a
manufacturing
worker
who
have
lose
he
job
in
the
past
three
month
,
the

report
would

pile
to
I

I
would

bring
home
the

report
on
Thursday
evening
instead
of
a
cheque

the

have
engage
in
a
degree
of
spin
on
the
issue
in
the
past
24
hour
.
there
be
a
state
of
denial
on
this
issue
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
lobby
the
government
to
examine
this
issue
positively
,
take
in
hand
certain
aspect
of
the
economy

re-jig
its
thinking
on

to

outline

report

to
arrest
the
decline
in
the
construction
industry
the
government
must
come
out
in
favour
of
infrastructural
spending
.
it
be
not
sufficient
that
the
NRA
and
other
agency
concentrate
spending
on

the

must
be
adequately

regional
development
,
which
should
be
a
main
plank
of
a

such
as
this
,
be
to
mean
anything
,
then
the
national
spatial
strategy
must
be
return
to
the
forefront
of
economic
thinking
.
a
typical
hub

such
as
Mallow
must
benefit
from
government
policy
that
deliver

,
as
should
town
such
as

,
Midleton
and
Fermoy
.
this
town
have
not
benefit
from
the
boom
except
in
the
area
of
construction
.
investment
in
the
infrastructure
of

will
encourage

the

must
also
find

to
take
a
punt
on

the

welcome

it
must
go

the

the

be
a
testament
to
the

there
must

I
be
advise
that
certain
protection

on

Shannon
catchment
be
manage
on

of
the
esb
by
the
Shannon
Regional
Fishery
Board

copy
be
also
available
from
the

on

.
on
behalf
of
my
party
I
join
in
congratulate
the
minister
on
he
appointment
and
also
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Killeen
.
the
reason
for
the
question
be
the
degree
of
uncertainty
which
be
have
a
mark
result
in
this
country
in
that
we
be
now
pay
more
for
food
.
family
be
pay
much
more
for
staple
item
and
that
give
rise
to
the
question
.
if
the
WTO
deal
go
through
as
it
be
constitute
,
that
will
have
a
further
uncertainty
for
food
production
throughout
the
European
Union
into
the
future
.
many
people
be
ask
whether
the
government
have
a
coherent
policy
.
Irish
farmer
and
food
producer
will
be
ask
whether
that
€
8.6
billion
in
export
will
be
compromise
in
any
way
if
global
trend
continue
as
they
be
.
we
be
try
to
elicit
whether
,
notwithstand
the
CAP
health
check
and
the
FAO
agenda
on
a
global
basis
,
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
have
a
coherent
strategy
on
the
way
forward
for
Irish
producer
to
attain
some
degree
of
self
-
sufficiency
—
and
ensure
we
take
a
long
-
term
view
on
food
production
in
Ireland
.
that
be
the
premise
of
the
question
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
if
the
WTO
deal
go
through
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
,
this
will
have
a
further
adverse
effect
for
producer
in
develop
country
—
as
well
as
for
Irish
producer
?
ultimately
,
and
this
hark
back
to
what
the
Fine
Gael
spokesman
be
say
as
regards
the
current
WTO
deal
,
there
be
political
consideration
,
both
domestically
and
internationally
.
Irish
farmer
want
to
hear
that
there
will
be
no
dismantling
of
the
long
-
term
achievement
of
cap
into
the
future
.
it
be
clearly
the
case
that
the
WTO
deal
,
as
it
stand
,
will
compromise
that
gain
and
indeed
,
diminish
and
destroy
they
.
they
want
to
hear
a
firm
voice
from
the
government
as
to
its
intention
on
the
WTO
deal
.
I
refer
to
the
Malone
report
and
the
basis
of
the
five
hectare
limit
.
be
this
over
-
prescriptive
and
be
there
scope
for
further
reduction
in
this
regard
?
a
ministerial
prerogative
be
available
to
reduce
it
further
,
if
necessary
,
in
certain
location
.
as
with
any
regime
change
,
one
would
hope
there
be
plan
for
force
majeure
event
.
this
have
be
ten
year
in
the
making
.
I
welcome
the
clear
statement
and
,
frankly
,
I
hope
it
be
true
.
this
legislation
be
on
the
Order
Paper
when
I
come
into
this
House
,
then
it
be
take
off
and
it
have
appear
again
.
the
confusion
relate
to
this
be
genuine
and
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
spokesperson
on
agriculture
,
there
have
be
no
legislation
on
agriculture
,
fishery
,
forestry
or
food
in
the
past
12
month
.
for
this
reason
I
hope
the
statement
be
genuine
and
I
look
forward
to
the
legislation
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
parochial
but
this
matter
relate
to
the
office
in
north
Cork
,
specifically
Mallow
,
where
structural
issue
have
exist
for
some
time
that
make
it
difficult
for
staff
to
process
grant
claim
.

to

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
by
the
HSE
to
appoint
more
occupational
therapist
in
order
that
people
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
be
not
wait
for
period
of
up
to
six
month
and
beyond
to
receive
a
occupational

report
for
the
purpose
of
apply
for
a
housing

where

be

without

they
would

or
a
missal
.
Transport
be
one
of
the
fast
grow
sector
in
term
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
it
be
widely
acknowledge
that
transport
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
area
in
which
to
affect
a
reduction
in
co2
emission
.
biofuel
offer
one
potential
means
to
counter
rise
emission
level
in
the
transport
sector
.
the
recent
EU
proposal
set
the
biofuel
obligation
target
for
5.75
%
in
2010
and
10
%
by
2020
have
include
the
provision
that
any
new
fuel
have
at
least
a
35
%
emission
reduction
and
have
to
show
that
they
come
from
sustainable
source
which
do
not
destroy
natural
habitat
.
biofuel
production
and
use
will
enhance
security
of
supply
and
contribute
to
a
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
in
addition
to
direct
co2
benefit
,
biofuel
offer
opportunity
for
waste
recycling
as
biofuel
production
can
use
this
waste
oil
as
a
feedstock
.
the
development
of
a
supply
line
of
alternative
fuel
supplies
which
would
still
be
available
should
there
be
a
disruption
to
essential
oil
supplies
be
essential
so
that
we
can
continue
to
provide
basic
service
in
such
circumstance
.
Recent
event
have
show
we
that
biofuel
be
not
without
they
complexity
.
the
diversion
of
food
crop
into
biofuel
production
have
be
one
factor
in
the
recent
rise
in
world
fuel
price
.
there
have
also
be
concern
that
new
biofuel
production
have
lead
to
the
conversion
of
natural
forest
system
into
crop
production
.
it
be
for
this
reason
that
we
will
ensure
that
we
expand
use
of
biofuel
must
take
place
within
the
context
of
the
EU
sustainability
criterion
regime
,
currently
under
negotiation
.
the
European
target
will
not
be
pursue
in
a
manner
which
threaten
the
long
-
term
food
security
of
the
develop
world
.
by
establish
the
long
-
term
target
early
,
and
announce
we
intention
to
move
to
a
biofuel
obligation
,
we
aim
to
create
a
level
of
long
-
term
certainty
for
potential
investor
,
particularly
in
second
-
generation
biofuel
.
this
new
technology
offer
the
potential
to
generate
fuel
from
a
number
of
feedstock
which
would
not
be
compete
with
fuel
supplies
.
a
public
consultation
on
Ireland
's
biofuel
obligation
will
be
launch
shortly
and
we
will
be
encourage
all
stakeholder
to
input
into
this
process
.

level
in

transport
sector
.
the
recent
EU
proposal
set
the
biofuel
obligation
target
for
5.75
%
in
2010
and
10
%
by
2020
have
include
the
provision
that
any
new
fuel
have
at
least
a
35
%
emission
reduction
and
have
to
show
that
they
come
from
sustainable
source
which
do
not
destroy
natural
habitat
.
biofuel
production
and
use
will
enhance
security
of
supply
and
contribute
to
a
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
in
addition
to
direct
co2
benefit
,
biofuel
offer
opportunity
for
waste
recycling
as
biofuel
production
can
use
this
waste
oil
as
a
feedstock
.
the
development
of
a
supply
line
of
alternative
fuel
supplies
which
would
still
be
available
should
there
be
a
disruption
to
essential
oil
supplies
be
essential
so
that
we
can
continue
to
provide
basic
service
in
such
circumstance
.
Recent
event
have
show
we
that
biofuel
be
not
without
they
complexity
.
the
diversion
of
food
crop
into
biofuel
production
have
be
one
factor
in
the
recent
rise
in
world
fuel
price
.
there
have
also
be
concern
that
new
biofuel
production
have
lead
to
the
conversion
of
natural
forest
system
into
crop
production
.
it
be
for
this
reason
that
we
will
ensure
that
we
expand
use
of
biofuel
must
take
place
within
the
context
of
the
EU
sustainability
criterion
regime
,
currently
under
negotiation
.
the
European
target
will
not
be
pursue
in
a
manner
which
threaten
the
long
-
term
food
security
of
the
develop
world
.
by
establish
the
long
-
term
target
early
,
and
announce
we
intention
to
move
to
a
biofuel
obligation
,
we
aim
to
create
a
level
of
long
-
term
certainty
for
potential
investor
,
particularly
in
second
-
generation
biofuel
.
this
new
technology
offer
the
potential
to
generate
fuel
from
a
number
of
feedstock
which
would
not
be
compete
with
fuel
supplies
.
a
public
consultation
on
Ireland
's
biofuel
obligation
will
be
launch
shortly
and
we
will
be
encourage
all
stakeholder
to
input
into
this
process
.
on
the
day
deputy
Brian
Cowen
become
Taoiseach
,
he
say
to
this
House
that
the
status
quo
as
it
pertain
to
the
county
hospital
structure
could
no
long
be

I
be
sure
the
Taoiseach
mean
to
use
the
term
''
general
hospital
structure
''
.
give
that
there
be
countless
thousand
of
people
—
—
if
the
Ceann
Comhairle
will
allow
I
to
finish
,
I
will
come
to
it
.
I
bow
to
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
superior
knowledge
as
I
be
a
new

.
I
be
seek
a
little
bit
of
latitude
to
raise
a
issue
which
be
very
important
for
the
constituent
I
serve
.
the
county

be
be

the
Taoiseach
make
comment
to
this
House
that
the
status
quo
could
no
long
be
retain
.
I
ask
that
a
debate
be
hold
in
this
house
so
that
we
can
—
—
I
appreciate
that
but
we
be
now
face
with
situation
where
the
county

structure
be
be
undermine
in

we

the
NBS
will
provide
broadband
service
to
area
that
be
currently
unserved
and
will
ensure
that
all
reasonable
request
for

Home

that

consequently
,
it
be
expect
that
all
home
and
premise
in
currently
unserved
area
will
be
offer
a
broadband
service
.
it
be

that
a

.
as
regards

a
value
for
money
and
policy
review
of
Phase
i
of
the
MANs
Programme
be
currently
be
finalise
in
my
Department
.
I
be
also
finalise
a
consultation
paper
on
next
generation
broadband
.
both
document
will
be
publish
shortly
and
will
inform
future
government
investment
in
broadband
.
the
language
use
by
the
institution
of
the
European
Union
be
not
understand
by
the
general
populace
or
politician
.
a
practical
example
of
this
would
be
to
ask
any
member
what
the
co-decision
procedure
mean
.
I
be
sure
the
majority
would
find
it
difficult
to
explain
.
if
one
cannot
explain
the
co-decision
procedure
,
how
can
one
explain
what
the
Lisbon
treaty
mean
for
enhance
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
?
how
can
one
explain
that
the
treaty
would
give
more
power
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
?
if
that
language
deficit
exist
,
it
be
difficult
for
the
general
populace
to
latch
on
to
a
idea
of
what
the
treaty
mean
.
I
support
the
treaty
because
it
aim
to
enhance
the
power
of
the
European
Parliament
,
make
the
European
Council
more
transparent
in
its
dealing
and
give
,
by
extension
,
more
power
to
the
people
.
it
would
address
the
issue
that
turf
cutter
,
fisherman
,
farmer
and
other
have
because
the
European
Parliament
,
and
by
extension
the
people
,
would
have
extend
power
.
however
,
we
vote
"
no
"
to
that
.
therefore
,
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
how
we
should
start
to
educate
ourselves
as
to
how
the
European
Union
work
and
what
be
the
inter-
relationship
between
the
Council
of
Minister
,
the
European
Commission
and
the
European
Parliament
and
how
this
inter-relationship
and
pooling
of
sovereignty
affect
we
as
citizen
of
the
European
Union
.
the
argument
of
sovereignty
be
use
against
the
treaty
.
when
we
join
in
1973
,
we
do
so
on
the
basis
not
that
we
be
give
up
we
sovereignty
but
that
we
be
pool
we
sovereignty
and
become
part
of
a
decision
-
making
process
of
which
we
be
also
member
and
stakeholder
.
this
treaty
be
go
to
enhance
that
very
provision
but
,
as
other
speaker
have
say
,
we
find
ourselves
on
the
back
foot
,
rebut
argument
that
be
spurious
in
the
main
.
I
respect
people
's
decision
to
vote
"
no
"
.
I
have
to
respect
that
decision
because
if
there
be
a
fundamental
lack
of
understanding
as
to
how
the
institution
work
,
how
can
a
person
buy
into
and
believe
in
the
process
?
the
question
be
how
we
be
go
to
address
this
attitude
and
make
people
believe
in
the
process
.
will
there
now
be
a
complete
recasting
of
we
relationship
with
the
European
Union
?
do
we
now
proceed
backwards
into
a
process
of
intergovernmentalism
or
do
we
enhance
and
deepen
the
process
by
means
of
inter-institutionalism
?
this
be
the
question
that
need
to
be
ask
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
explain
that
very
relationship
to
people
on
the
doorstep
.
we
must
wait
for
the
time
when
the
people
of
Ireland
understand
the
positive
aspect
of
that
relationship
and
we
begin
to
use
a
language
that
do
not
regard
Brussels
as
some
foreign
entity
but
merely
as
a
city
in
which
decision
be
take
by
we
as
equal
partner
to
a
decision
-
making
process
that
be
the
European
Union
.
until
we
begin
to
decipher
the
language
and
change
the
language
we
use
and
make
it
more
amenable
and
understandable
to
people
,
we
will
continue
to
have
this
deficit
.
my
sojourn
here
for
the
past
year
have
be
one
during
which
there
have
be
a
dearth
of
legislation
and
a
proliferation
of
statement
on
everything
under
the
sun
.
on
a
personal
level
,
I
could
say
I
have
enjoy
the
experience
but
I
expect
when
I
come
to
this
House
that
I
would
be
up
to
my
oxter
in
legislation
and
debate
but
the
contrary
have
be
the
case
.
I
sense
a
malaise
and
a
lack
of
appetite
for
the
issue
which
relate
to
the
governance
of
this
country
from
the
government
side
of
the
House
.
today
we
debate
the
Lisbon
treaty
referendum
and
I
,
as
a
deputy
for
Cork
East
,
have
five
minute
to
discuss
and
put
forward
the
idea
I
have
but
I
could
not
do
so
in
the
time
available
.
the
time
available
in
this
house
for
political
discourse
and
debate
be
become
short
all
the
time
.
that
send
a
message
to
the
people
that
politician
could
not
care
one
fig
about
the
issue
relate
to
they
everyday
life
.
we
be
now
go
to
extend
this
session
by
one
week
.
that
will
feed
into
that
increase
cynicism
which
exist
beyond
this
wall
about
political
discourse
in
Ireland
.
the
Labour
Party
have
many
idea
and
positive
contribution
to
make
in
work
with
this
government
,
in
constructively
oppose
idea
which
this
government
put
forward
and
in
offer
good
solution
,
if
it
can
.
however
,
the
space
for
discourse
and
debate
have
be
cut
to
shred
.
that
be
what
exist
in
the
country
at
present
and
it
need
to
be
address
.
I
have
a
particular
competence
as
Labour
spokesperson
for
food
provision
and
agriculture
.
I
have
idea
that
I
could
put
forward
that
would
,
I
hope
,
lead
to
expand
the
base
for
agricultural
production
and
for
deal
with
the
issue
of
increase
food
price
.
however
,
I
be
not
able
to
do
this
because
the
government
and
the
leader
of
the
country
will
not
allow
I
the
opportunity
to
do
so
,
thereby
deny
I
the
opportunity
to
represent
the
people
who
put
I
here
.
this
House
have
primacy
in
term
of
its
democratic
function
but
this
be
not
recognise
.
the
government
be
run
scared
from
any
kind
of
debate
and
be
not
face
up
to
its
responsibility
.
it
need
to
start
do
so
straight
away
.

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
why
Mallow
General
Hospital
do
not
yet
have
a
ct
scanner
that
be
operational
,
despite
the
budgetary
provision
be
make
in
2004
and
despite
its
subsequent
installation
;
to
ask
why
the
person
who
be
appoint
radiographer
will
not
now
take
up
the
post
;
and
,
further
,
to
ask
the
minister
for
Health
and
Children
when
it
be
propose
that
this
post
will
be
fill
.
they
will
be
ask
we
to
run
the
country
next
.
I
propose
to
share
time
with
deputy
Tommy
Broughan
and
Brendan
Howlin
,
if
I
may
.
I
receive
the
same
e-mail
as
deputy
Creed
and
I
believe
it
have
sum
up
the
situation
as
it
relate
to
a
family
that
be
completely
reliant
on
fishing
for
its
livelihood
.
a
husband
and
wife
re-mortgage
a
house
to
invest
in
a
boat
,
employ
a
crew
of
five
people
and
take
to
the
sea
.
in
one
instance
,
it
spend
ten
day
,
or
240
hour
,
at
sea
for
a
return
of
€
725
per
man
before
tax
.
basically
,
they
be
earn
€
3
per
hour
.
moreover
,
the
same
fisherman
then
be
oblige
to
incur
the
stringent
regulation
apply
by
the
authority
in
Ireland
,
while
French
,
Spanish
and
fisherman
from
other
country
be
look
on
and
laugh
at
the
regime
here
.
this
pertain
to
realise
that
a
group
of
people
exist
within
we
society
who
,
because
of
climactic
and
bureaucratic
condition
,
incur
serious
loss
of
income
.
however
,
they
wish
to
sustain
they
livelihood
and
they
coastal
community
because
they
have
do
so
for
generation
.
as
the
lady
who
write
the
e-mail
state
,
when
they
hit
bad
time
they
want
a
leg
up
and
not
a
handout
.
moreover
,
they
do
not
wish
to
incur
the
bureaucratic
nightmare
that
relate
to
fishery
policy
.
however
,
they
want
to
see
put
in
place
a
realistic
mechanism
that
would
assist
they
through
,
if
one
pardon
the
pun
,

water
.
during
time
when
crewmen
and
woman
be
not
bring
in
catch
and
they
income
be
be
seriously
deplet
—
they
be
deem
to
be

—
they
should
not
be

to
go

in

to
the
local
community
welfare
officer
to
beg
to
supplement
they
income
.
a
form
of
tax
incentive
or
tax
break
could
be
put
in
place
on
the
basis
they
be
sustain
community
in
coastal
region
.
moreover
,
the
government
should
consider
a
form
of
social
welfare
mechanism
to
assist
such
man
and
woman
on
the
basis
that
they
income
fluctuate
between

of
the

and
the
other

I
ask
the

to
let
I
know
when

I
be

I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
and
I
propose
to
speak
for
two
minute
.
Cork
County
Council
announce
last
week
that
it
would
be
cut
a
range
of
grant
design
to
help
people
to
make
modification
to
they
home
,
namely
,
the
essential
repair
grant
,
the
mobility
aid
grant
,
the
housing
adaptation
grant
and
the
housing
aid
for
the
elderly
grant
.
the
reason
be
that
it
be
not
in
a
budgetary
position
to
deal
with
the
number
of
application
be
make
.
the
county
council
have
state
that
where
possible
it
will
try
to
process
the
disabled
person
's
grant
.
that
specifically
relate
to
Cork
County
Council
's
northern
division
.
we
be
ask
that
the
minister
consider
a
increase
in
the
funding
stream
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Finneran
,
will
tell
the
House
there
have
be
a
increase
year
on
year
in
the
overall
allocation
for
2008
and
the
total
amount
disburse
in
2007
.
the
announcement
in
February
by
the
then
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
housing
,
deputy
Batt
O'Keeffe
,
cause
the
other
scheme
announce
to
become
so
successful
that
hundred
of
people
apply
for
they
.
that
create
a
expectation
.
we
now
find
in
the
northern
division
of
Cork
County
Council
that
there
be
a
lack
of
funding
to
meet
the
scheme
of
which
many
vulnerable
and
old
people
be
in
need
to
carry
out
necessary
modification
to
they
home
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
see
if
there
be
any
way
to
provide
a
increase
in
the
funding
stream
.
the
local
Government
Computer
Service
Board
(
LGCSB
)
,
a
body
under
the
aegis
of
my
Department
,
be
schedule
to
move
to
Drogheda
under
the
decentralisation
programme
.
progress
in
relation
to
that
relocation
,
which
be
a
matter
for
the
body
itself
,
be
report
on
to
the
Decentralisation
Implementation
Group
.
I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
discuss
the
follow
specific
and
important
matter
of
public
interest
require
urgent
attention
,
namely
,
the
urgent
need
for
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
to
make
a
comprehensive
statement
to
the
House
on
the
threat
to
health
and
safety
pose
by
the
estimate
half
a
million
tonne
of
hazardous
material
contain
chromium
6
and
other
toxin
still
on
site
at
the
former
Irish
steel
site
at
Haulbowline
,
County
Cork
;
the
reason
the
removal
of
the
material
be
stop
by
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
and
the
contractor
be
instruct
to
cap
the
material
;
and
the
need
for
the
minister
to
outline
what
step
be
now
plan
to
remove
this
material
to
ensure
that
any
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
resident
be
remove
.
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
request
,
I
hope
the
Ceann
Comhairle
will
agree
to
it
be
take
.
I
wish
to
share
my
time
with
deputy
Ó
Snodaigh
.
I
echo
the
sentiment
of
we
spokesperson
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
on
this
Bill
.
the
legislation
,
as
it
be
put
to
we
,
and
the
subsequent
statement
by
the
minister
,
would
leave
one
wonder
what
be
the
purpose
and
content
of
this
legislation
.
there
be
few
meaningful
section
in
the
Bill
.
the
culture
and
sale
of
alcohol
in
this
country
would
probably
be
well
deal
with
in
the
sale
of
alcohol
Bill
.
however
there
be
some
good
provision
in
the
Bill
that
be
worthy
of
support
.
in
this
country
we
cannot
talk
about
alcohol
without
its
have
some
very
deep
cultural
meaning
.
we
relationship
with
alcohol
have
be
ambiguous
and
we
have
speak
about
it
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
in
my
research
I
come
across
a
study
in
the
Journal
of
statistical
and
social
Inquiry
Society
of
Ireland
entitle
issue
for
Irish
Alcohol
Policy
:
a
historical
perspective
with
some
Lesson
for
the
Future
,
publish
in
1991
.
the
author
of
that
report
,
Mr.
Daniel
McCoy
,
cite
a
quotation
:
''
no
one
can
be
competent
to
discuss
the
drink
question
unless
he
have
think
over
it
sufficiently
to
realise
how
complicated
the
subject
necessarily
be
.
''
on
page
21
of
that
study
the
author
refer
to
historical
view
of
the
relationship
we
have
with
alcohol
in
this
country
:
Irish
drinking
be
see
as
convivial
rather
than
ritual
and
be
use
as
a
bonding
with
people
of
the
same
or
other
group
.
Irish
people
...
have
a
"
social
acceptance
"
of
drunkenness
something
that
be
completely
opposite
to
the
Islamic
view
.
while
I
do
not
advocate
that
we
all
turn
to
Islam
,
neither
do
I
advocate
some
of
the
point
raise
in
this
piece
of
legislation
that
seek
to
modify
behaviour
.
for
example
,
I
do
not
believe
the
provision
on
sale
of
wine
in
supermarket
be
good
.
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
see
fit
to
reverse
that
trend
.
the
vast
majority
of
people
drink
responsibly
and
like
to
imbibe
and
share
a
bottle
of
wine
in
they
home
.
the
notion
that
somebody
would
have
to
go
to
a
supermarket
that
have
a
off
-
licence
and
ask
for
a
bottle
to
be
hand
out
by
a
member
of
staff
so
that
he
or
she
could
handle
it
before
purchase
be
ludicrous
.
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
reverse
that
provision
.
I
want
to
speak
briefly
on
theatre
licence
.
there
should
not
be
uniform
closing
time
for
nightclub
.
have
hundred
of
people
spill
out
onto
the
street
at
one
give
time
be
not
a
effective
method
of
regularise
alcohol
consumption
,
if
that
be
the
modus
operandi
of
the
Bill
.
by
modify
or
regulate
closing
time
in
a
very
uniform
way
one
will
not
modify
behaviour
.
the
core
of
the
legislation
should
be
to
seek
to
change
the
culture
.
by
staggering
closing
time
,
particularly
for
nightclub
with
theatre
licence
,
there
would
be
more
of
a
drip
-
feed
onto
the
street
and
it
would
be
easy
to
control
.
the
legislation
propose
to
have
cctv
camera
install
and
that
would
be
a
good
way
to
monitor
the
behaviour
of
clientele
exite
onto
street
at
night
time
.
however
restrict
licence
,
particularly
theatre
licence
,
will
not
be
a
good
way
of
modify
alcohol
consumption
.
the
two
do
not
correlate
.
I
have
attend
the
Gaiety
Theatre
,
which
have
a
late
licence
,
on
a
number
of
occasion
.
accord
to
its
website
,
this
weekend
four
different
event
will
take
place
simultaneously
in
the
theatre
's
four
bar
.
there
will
be
a
live
band
play
indie
and
retro
music
,
on
another
stage
there
will
be
northern
soul
and
there
will
also
be
some
hip
hop
.
in
a
city
the
size
of
Dublin
one
be
catering
for
a
wide
range
of
musical
taste
and
a
clientele
that
like
to
go
out
clubbing
.
this
people
do
not
necessarily
see
themselves
as
deviant
in
any
way
when
they
have
take
alcohol
and
will
go
home
after
enjoy
a
responsible
night
out
.
curb
that
person
's
behaviour
through
legislation
will
not
necessarily
create
a
panacea
for
how
alcohol
be
consume
in
this
country
.
the
vast
majority
of
people
behave
responsibly
,
like
to
go
out
and
have
a
varied
night
,
such
as
the
night
provide
by
a
facility
such
as
the
Gaiety
Theatre
.
restrict
that
type
of
licence
will
not
necessarily
change
the
culture
.
although
the
alcohol
advisory
group
make
recommendation
with
regard
to
closing
time
,
not
all
of
its
recommendation
be
necessarily
contain
in
the
Bill
,
from
what
I
have
read
.
I
repeat
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
's
point
that
the
sale
of
alcohol
Bill
must
deal
with
the
cultural
aspect
of
alcohol
consumption
in
this
country
by
modify
closing
time
and
the
right
to
be
able
to
purchase
alcohol
in
a
supermarket
or
off
-
licence
.
make
provision
whereby
a
certain
aspect
of
a
supermarket
have
to
be
close
off
and
all
alcohol
move
behind
a
counter
be
totally
ludicrous
.
I
welcome
the
change
announce
in
the
minister
's
speech
and
the
overtone
in
that
regard
.
with
regard
to
early
morning
house
,
while
I
understand
the
Bill
must
go
through
committee
stage
,
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
it
almost
criminalise
that
who
have
early
morning
licence
and
seek
to
convey
a
impression
that
anyone
with
such
a
licence
be
the
purveyor
of
all
sort
of
iniquity
.
many
people
,
some
of
they
constituent
of
mine
,
have
work
either
as
docker
or
have
work
night
shift
all
they
life
.
due
to
they
pattern
of
sleeping
follow
a
night
shift
,
they
will
enjoy
a
pint
in
the
morning
in
the
early
house
and
will
then
proceed
home
in
a
proper
and
orderly
fashion
.
of
course
,
there
have
be
instance
where
early
house
have
probably
have
some
degree
of
anti-social
behaviour
but
this
be
not
outside
the
norm
of
any
other
establishment
hold
a
normal
licence
.
the
advisory
group
do
not
undertake
any
quantitative
or
qualitative
study
.
I
do
not
know
of
one
licensee
in
the
early
morning
trade
to
whom
I
speak
who
have
a
visit
from
any
departmental
official
during
the
framing
of
this
legislation
.
I
believe
this
measure
be
include
as
a
afterthought
and
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
make
some
concession
in
this
regard
.
in
conclusion
,
I
be
glad
the
minister
have
see
sense
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
cultural
aspect
of
alcohol
consumption
,
the
link
between
the
cultural
aspect
and
education
have
to
be
expound
more
vociferously
by
the
government
.
the
only
way
we
will
change
the
culture
be
by
a
process
of
education
.
I
do
not
believe
some
of
the
provision
in
the
Bill
would
necessarily
change
that
culture
and
,
in
fact
,
they
would
drive
alcohol
more
into
a
underground
mode
.
while
I
welcome
the
Bill
in
some
respects
,
I
be
glad
the
change
the
minister
have
propose
will
now
be
make
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
the
project
cost
of
fully
clean
up
the
site
be
estimate
to
be
in
the
region
of
€300
million
and
that
this
be
a
determine
factor
in
the
government
's
decision
to
send
a
letter
to
the
contractor
on
18
April
,
as
report
in
today
's
Irish
Examiner
,
state
that
the
require
course
of
action
would
be
to
''
cap
the
lagoon
with
inert
slag
material
(
or
other
such
suitable
available
material
)
,
pend
a
detailed
risk
assessment
of
the
entire
site
''
?
the
government
find
out
how
much
it
would
cost
to
clean
up
the
site
and
be
now
seek
to
spin
the
matter
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
the
subcontractor
on
the
site
be
act
outside
they
station
or
ultra
vire
and
be
now
seek
to
put
the
blame
on
they
.
when
the
government
realise
that
it
have
unearth
such
a
problem
,
it
refuse
to
acknowledge
it
and
seek
to
cover
it
up
.
its
intention
,
in
the
first
instance
,
be
never
to
fully
assess
and
continue
the
work
that
be
necessary
on
the
site
.
this
be
a
bombshell
to
the
people
who
reside
in
the
vicinity
of
the
site
.
they
think
that
the
government
be
act
in
good
faith
when
it
decide
that
the
Haulbowline
site
would
be
clear
.
for
the
government
to
state
that
the
contract
only
cover
above
-
surface
work
and
not
sub
-
surface
work
be
a
attempt
to
cover
up
the
problem
that
exist
from
a
subterranean
point
of
view
.
its
intention
be
never
to
expend
the
fund
necessary
to
clean
up
the
site
and
make
it
safe
for
that
who
reside
and
work
in
its
vicinity
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
specifically
address
the
point
in
the
letter
date
18
April
2008
because
it
be
the
most
pertinent
point
relate
to
this
issue
.
the
local
authority
have
wash
its
hand
of
the
matter
.
it
say
it
be
with
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
195
to
197
,
inclusive
,
together
.
since
2002
,
the
Commission
for
Energy
Regulation

CER
)
,
which
be
a
statutory
independent
body
,
have
be
charge
with
all
aspect
of

assessment
and
licensing
of
prospective
operator
who
wish
to
develop

in

CER
direct
Bord

to
implement
a
new
Gas
connection
policy
,
which
determine
the
economic
viability
of

the
new
policy
allow
for
the
appraisal
of
a

on
its
own
or
as
part
of
a
regional
group
of

.
BGÉ
be
carry
out
a
comprehensive
review
of
town

consider
for
connection
to
the
national

.
the
review
be
be
carry
out
in
three
phase
,
with
phase
3
of
the
study
have
commence
late
last
year
.
this
phase
include
Boyle
,
Roscommon
,
Ballaghaderreen
and
Strokestown
in
County
Roscommon
and
Carrick

on

Shannon
in
County
Leitrim
.
the
final
report
be
due
to
be
publish
in
late
2008
and
it
will
outline
what
town
or
group
of

be
economically
viable
for

within

I
wish
to
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
need
for
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
to
confirm
if
material
,
which
be
remove
from
slag
heap
at
Haulbowline
,
be
use
in
road
construction
or
for
other
use
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
the
quantity
of
material
remove
,
whether
the
material
be
examine
for
toxicity
and
,
if
necessary
,
treat
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
the
name
of
the
company
or
company
that
extract
the
material
;
the
need
for
he
to
indicate
where
the
material
be
use
and
if
the
requisite
licence
be
in
place
;
and
the
need
for
he
to
confirm
that
all
potentially
hazardous
material
remove
from
the
site
can
be
account
for
.
in
light
of
the
revelation
by
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
,
we
know
material
be
move
from
this
site
to
the
mainland
.
the
current
investigation
,
therefore
,
must
also
examine
material
carry
off
site
.
we
need
to
know
where
the
material
be
transport
to
and
how
it
be
transport
.
be
a
licence
grant
to
transport
it
?
be
only
inert
material
transport
?
be
the
material
form
part
of
a
slag
heap
somewhere
in
County
Cork
?
give
the
material
be
transport
by
a
company
base
in
Mallow
,
when
do
it
transfer
to
Mallow
?
be
the
material
still
in
Mallow
or
have
it
be
deposit
in
municipally
license
dump
in
north
Cork
?
be
material
deposit
in
non-licensed
facility
?
can
the
minister
confirm
whether
some
material
have
end
up
in
other
location
in
north
Cork
?
will
the
minister
,
on
foot
of
this
revelation
,
consider
a
further
investigation
and
use
the
power
vested
in
he
to
seek
to
ensure
complete
traceability
of
all
material
?
will
he
wide
the
remit
of
the
current
assessment
of
the
site
to
ensure
all
traceable
material
,
both
on
and
off
site
,
come
within
the
remit
of
that
investigation
?
in
light
of
this
revelation
,
I
also
call
on
the
minister
to
meet
the
elect
representative
of
east
Cork
and
the
harbour
area
and
,
in
particular
,
the
mayor
of
Cobh
immediately
to
listen
to
they
concern
.
in
the
time
available
,
it
have
not
be
possible
to
identify
and
assemble
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
.
my
department
be
in
the
process
of
identify

I
will
revert

that
this
government
would
expect
we
to
come
into
this
house
,
take
the
Bill
that
be
before
we
and
accept
it
as
a
fait
accompli
without
any
critical
assessment
be
a
gross
underestimation
and
a
gross
insult
to
that
we
represent
.
the
amendment
that
have
be
put
forward
by
the
Labour
Party
be
sensible
because
they
seek
to
give
a
parliamentary
oversight
to
the
process
that
be
about
to
be
undertake
here
.
the
amendment
on
the
financial
aspect
—
I
refer
specifically
to
amendment
no.
24
—
to
the
effect
that
a
equity
stake
could
be
take
by
the
State
in
the
event
of
a
call
on
one
of
the
loan
be
something
that
should
be
consider
.
the
people
of
this
country
would
then
have
some
sort
of
a
stake
and
say
in
the
control
of
the
banking
system
into
the
future
.
the
other
issue
relate
to
the
power
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
in
any
parliamentary
democracy
there
must
be
check
and
balance
.
what
be
be
propose
by
the
government
in
its
current
form
give
undue
power
to
the
Minister
for
Finance
and
the
amendment
that
we
have
put
forward
would
seek
to
keep
that
in
check
.
I
do
not
want
to
engage
in
a
rhetorical
speech
here
about
the
nature
of
global
financial
capitalism
,
but
what
we
need
in
this
country
,
which
we
can
bring
about
only
through
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
,
be
a
great
degree
of
regulation
that
will
ensure
that
the
confidence
that
have
always
be
in
the
banking
sector
will
continue
.
unlike
deputy
Gogarty
,
I
do
not
envisage
that
we
should
return
to
the
gold
standard
.
confidence
be
all
important
but
if
the
taxpayer
of
this
country
be
be
ask
to
underwrite
this
,
there
should
be
some
pain
for
the
bank
,
there
should
be
some
quid
pro
quo
,
and
there
should
be
a
possibility
that
the
State
would
at
some
future
date
have
a
degree
of
equity
in
the
banking
system
,
if
necessary
.
that
be
what
be
be
propose
,
and
that
there
would
be
complete
transparency
in
that
process
as
well
.
we
amendment
be
reasonable
and
should
be
take
on
board
.

but
we
have
not
have
any
from

we
also
deserve

explanation

.
we
go

charade
every

do

we
need
to
have
some
light
on
the
rule
and
regulation
because
this
be
a
archaic
institution
in
the
way
it
be

operate

in
reference
to
the
minister
's
speech
,
particularly
where
he
deal
with
the
principle
of
taxation
,
he
say
the
imposition
of
tax
must
be
fair
and
equitable
and
that
a
high
rate
must
apply
to
that
on
high
income
.
that
sound
familiar
in
that
it
read
exactly
like
my
old
leave
certificate
economics
Folens
textbook
and
whoever
write
that
probably
do
the
leave
certificate
around
the
same
time
as
myself
.
however
,
I
always
understand
from
my
leave
certificate
economics
that
taxation
should
be
progressive
,
not
regressive
.
in
this
instance
,
the
1
%
levy
be
regressive
.
that
on
the
margin
and
people
who
predominantly
probably
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
be
be
punish
for
they
loyalty
.
they
be
the
people
who
do
not
benefit
extensively
during
the
boom
year
.
instead
,
they
go
out
every
day
to
do
as
they
always
do
and
now
they
be
be
punish
.
it
be
the
wrong
strategy
and
a
regressive
measure
.
when
one
take
account
of
the
increase
in
vat
and
other
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
,
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
they
real
income
.
the
real
income
of
that
in
the
low
income
bracket
will
be
severely
affect
and
for
that
reason
we
oppose
this
measure
.
on
the
price
of
tobacco
,
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
measure
on
the
basis
that
it
will
act
as
a
deterrent
.
however
,
in
a
effort
to
curb
tobacco
consumption
,
we
should
encourage
people
to
use
substitute
product
and
allow
that
product
to
be
free
of
vat
.
product
such
as
Nicorette
should
be
delist
—
as
currently
they
can
only
be
sell
in
pharmacy
—
and
allow
to
be
sell
in
supermarket
and
to
a
wide
range
of
people
.
I
call
for
such
a
measure
in
the
previous
budget
.
I
suspect
one
of
the
thing
at
play
here
be
that
the
Irish
Pharmaceutical
Union
be
firmly
in
control
of
that
issue
.
I
take
the
measure
at
face
value
if
it
be
a
question
of
equity
but
it
should
be
consider
in
a
wide
context
if
it
be
consider
as
a
health
measure
.
if
I
be
a
average
Fianna
Fáil
voter
,
a
male
,
who
like
to
back
a
horse
,
maybe
enjoy
a
glass
of
wine
—
—
—
—
and
drive
a
petrol
car
—
—
—
—
and
I
be
a
low
or
middle
income
earner
,
I
would
be
apoplectic
when
study
this
budget
.
many
people
who
fit
that
demographic
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
in
the
last
election
and
now
they
will
think
seriously
about
how
they
will
vote
the
next
time
.
I
be
also
pleased
that
the
government
do
not
put
any
vat
on
child
's
clothes
or
footwear
because
,
by
God
,
if
it
do
,
we
would
definitely
be
go
back
to
the
1980
.
I
refer
to
the
stamp
duty
on
cheque
and
bill
of
exchange
.
while
many
people
engage
in
on
-
line
banking
and
make
electronic
payment
,
we
have
not
reach
the
stage
where
the
bulk
of
people
make
such
payment
by
that
means
.
the
facility
do
not
exist
in
the
community
or
the
commercial
sector
.
for
example
,
if
one
go
to
a
builder
's
provider
it
be
not
always
possible
to
make
electronic
payment
.
this
be
a
unfair
measure
,
especially
for
old
people
who
still
rely
on
the
use
of
a
cheque
book
.
this
be
a
sneaky
way
to
raise
a
few
bob
.
let
we
suppose
a
person
have
a
mortgage
and
there
be
a
life
assurance
policy
tack
on
to
that
mortgage
.
be
that
person
susceptible
to
the
propose
increase
vis
-à
-
vis
life
assurance
and
investment
fund
?
this
would
have
the
net
effect
of
increase
the
cost
of
mortgage
for
a
certain
sector
.
it
be
propose
that
this
would
yield
€
13
million
per
year
.
I
seek
clarification
on
this
matter
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
ask
a
question
.
on
a
point
of
order
—
—
I
ask
a
question
that
be
not
answer
.
I
ask
about
life
assurance
attach
to
mortgage

I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
O'Shea
and
Ferris
.
I
wish
to
speak
about
the
subject
of
this
motion
.
I
will
stick
to
the
point
of
this
debate
,
which
have
go
all
over
the
shop
,
quite
frankly
.
the
purpose
of
the
motion
be
to
seek
a
extension
to
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
.
the
Labour
Party
would
support
such
a
extension
,
not
for
political
expediency
or
point
-
scoring
,
but
because
we
realise
that
a
certain
number
of
farmer
will
not
be
able
to
make
the
deadline
.
we
support
such
farmer
for
reason
of
common
sense
and
pragmatism
,
some
of
which
have
already
be
outline
.
I
be
aware
of
farmer
who
have
not
be
able
to
get
contractor
to
do
the
work
which
be
require
under
the
scheme
.
the
poor
weather
we
have
endure
this
year
have
delay
some
building
work
.
many
farmer
will
not
be
able
to
meet
the
deadline
as
a
consequence
of
a
myriad
of
other
circumstance
,
which
I
will
not
repeat
.
there
be
merit
in
raise
,
in
a
genuine
way
,
the
possibility
of
a
extension
to
the
deadline
.
some
people
will
be
adversely
affect
if
a
change
be
not
make
.
the
valid
point
make
early
by
deputy
Deenihan
,
which
have
also
be
raise
by
the
Irish
Creamery
Milk
Suppliers
Organisation
,
ICMSA
,
deserve
further
examination
.
I
refer
to
the
interpretation
of
State
aid
and
the
interpretation
of
the
scheme
.
I
wish
to
quote
from
a
letter
send
by
the
president
of
the
ICMSA
to
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
on
25
August
last
.
the
letter
,
which
get
to
the
heart
of
the
debate
on
this
motion
,
read
:
dear
minister
I
wish
to
refer
again
to
the
31
December
2008
deadline
under
the
Farm
Waste
Management
Scheme
.
while
we
be
all
aware
of
the
background
to
the
scheme
and
the
setting
of
the
December
2006
and
December
2008
deadline
,
there
be
clearly
a
major
problem
for
a
grow
number
of
farmer
if
the
31
December
2008
deadline
be
to
be
interpret
as
mean
that
the
work
must
be
complete
and
approve
by
you
Department
on
or
before
that
date
.
we
do
not
accept
that
this
be
the
only
interpretation
.
I
believe
,
base
on
the
EC
Guideline
for
State
Aid
in
the
Agriculture
and
Forestry
Sector
,
that
Ireland
should
propose
that
the
31
December
2008
deadline
can
be
meet
by
a
individual
farmer
where
the
building
work
be
to
be
complete
or
commence
after
the
31
December
2008
if
that
farmer
have
a
legally
bind
contract
for
the
construction
of
the
building
and
or
supply
of
material
in
place
on
or
before
31
December
2008
.
this
procedure
,
reliance
on
a
legally
bind
contract
,
be
use
quite
often
for
the
phase
introduction
or
termination
of
tax
relief
measure
.
I
believe
that
this
procedure
can
be
readily
adopt
by
you
Department
and
would
meet
the
requirement
set
down
in
the
EC
Guideline
for
State
Aid
in
the
Agriculture
and
Forestry
Sector
.
that
proposal
,
which
be
base
on
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
state
aid
guideline
,
represent
common
sense
.
I
echo
deputy
Deenihan
's
comment
on
it
.
in
he
response
to
this
motion
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Smith
,
do
not
respond
to
deputy
Deenihan
's
point
.
I
call
on
one
of
the
government
deputy
to
respond
to
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
in
a
honest
manner
.
be
this
interpretation
of
the
guideline
valid
?
I
do
not
wish
to
play
politics
with
this
issue
.
a
balance
and
reasonable
view
be
be
put
forward
by
a
group
of
farmer
who
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
submit
the
card
a
due
to
genuine
reason
.
it
be
reasonable
for
we
to
echo
the
view
of
that
farmer
,
notwithstand
what
deputy
Conlon
and
other
have
say
in
support
of
the
scheme
.
we
have
have
superfluous
speech
by
government
backbencher
,
but
there
be
a
genuine
issue
that
need
to
be
address
.
before
the
clock
run
down
on
this
debate
,
I
hope
that
the
government
will
come
back
with
a
response
to
the
point
that
I
and
deputy
Deenihan
have
raise
.
there
be
a
genuine
concern
among
a
small
minority
of
farmer
and
that
must
be
address
.
my
Department
have
no
such
investment
and
be
not
aware
of
any
such
investment
hold
by
body
under
its
aegis
.

in
bring
forward
this
draconian
measure
the
government
have
alienate
the
most
vulnerable
section
of
we
society
.
that
who
have
reach
the
autumn
year
of
they
life
once
have
the
cushion
,
the
safety
and
the
peace
of
mind
of
know
they
could
go
to
a
gp
in
a
hour
of
need
,
but
that
luxury
be
no
long
afford
to
they
.
we
have
lecture
last
week
from
the
Taoiseach
about
he
Republican
and
egalitarian
ideal
.
what
be
do
and
visit
upon
this
people
last
week
be
neither
Republican
nor
truly
egalitarian
.
it
run
counter
to
anything
that
be
Republican
or
egalitarian
.
in
the
short
time
I
have
,
I
implore
the
government
to
reverse
this
decision
.
if
the
thousand
of
people
who
come
onto
the
street
of
Dublin
today
be
anything
to
go
by
in
term
of
deliver
a
short
sharp
message
to
the
government
,
today
be
the
day
it
happen
.
the
government
must
listen
to
that
people
who
have
reach
they
autumn
year
and
be
now
worried
and
full
of
angst
about
this
measure
.
if
we
be
truly
to
be
a
republic
in
the
pure
sense
of
that
word
,
we
must
reverse
this
measure
.
the

I
can

will
be
provide
to
the
school
to
which
the

refer
to
make
good
the
damage
to

in
the
meantime
the
Department
be
work
with
the
school
to
find
a
solution
to
the
school
immediate
accommodation
need
and
the
Department
expect
to
have
a
satisfactory
solution
in
place
when
the
school
return
for
mid
term
break
.
in
relation
to
progression
of
the
school
permanent
project
,
the
Department
be
cognisant
of
the
site
restriction
which
would
impede
further
expansion
of
the
exist
school
.
Greenfield
provision
for
this
school
will
be
consider
in
the
context
of
the
Department
's
on
-
go
multi-annual
school
building
and
modernisation
programme
.
every
time
I
walk
into
this
Chamber
,
I
pass
a
statue
of
Thomas
Davis
,
a
fellow
Mallow
man
famous
for
the
quote
,
"
educate
that
you
may
be
free
"
.
the
government
,
by
its
action
in
recent
week
,
have
seek
to
curb
this
freedom
.
when
Davis
speak
of
freedom
,
he
may
have
speak
in
the
context
of
political
liberation
but
he
also
speak
in
the
context
of
the
freedom
of
idea
,
thought
and
consciousness
.
if
we
be
to
educate
we
child
in
this
nation
in
the
context
that
Davis
speak
about
we
must
give
they
all
the
tool
we
can
.
the
government
,
by
its
action
last
week
,
seek
to
limit
that
freedom
and
limit
the
give
of
that
tool
to
that
child
and
it
should
be
ashamed
of
its
action
.
when
I
look
across
the
bench
of
this
house
I
see
certain
member
of
the
Green
Party
play
the
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
and
run
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
the
hound
.
I
say
to
they
that
if
they
be
true
to
they
political
conscience
and
cree
they
will
vote
with
the
Labour
Party
on
this
motion
and
vote
for
the
child
of
the
nation
and
for
the
proper
education
policy
that
we
wish
to
see
in
this
land
.
in
speak
to
this
motion
I
speak
for
the
school
in
my
constituency
.
I
speak
for
the
child
of
Ballyhooley
national
school
and
the
people
in
Carrigtwohill
,
Fermoy
,
the
Mercy
national
school
in
Cobh
,
Midleton
College
and
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
this
be
among
many
who
make
representation
to
I
about
the
swingeing
cutback
that
will
be
implement
and
the
adverse
effect
they
will
have
on
the
day
to
day
operation
of
they
school
.
it
must
be
admit
that
great
stride
have
be
make
in
many
aspect
of
education
during
the
past
ten
year
,
although
not
at
a
pace
we
would
wish
to
see
.
however
,
it
be
wrong
for
any
government
to
roll
back
that
achievement
in
one
fall
swoop
and
send
we
headlong
back
to
where
we
be
in
the
1980
.
this
be
not
the
mark
of
a
nation
make
progress
.
I
urge
the
government
to
think
hard
about
its
action
.
if
we
be
go
to
flourish
as
a
nation
we
must
look
to
future
generation
.
the
way
we
can
flourish
,
socially
and
economically
,
be
by
ensure
every
child
bar
none
have
the
good
chance
in
life
he
or
she
can
have
and
have
a
education
system
that
be
world
class
.
anything
else
be
not
what
we
want
.
this
motion
be
reasonable
.
it
speak
to
the
genuine
fear
the
people
have
about
the
way
they
see
the
education
system
go
.
the
people
beyond
this
wall
,
the
people
of
this
land
,
who
have
shout
loudly
,
and
thank
God
for
they
voice
,
do
not
want
to
see
they
child
treat
this
way
nor
should
the
Legislature
treat
they
child
this
way
.
we
want
to
give
they
a
fair
chance
and
a
fair
opportunity
.
this
be
what
we
seek
through
this
motion
.
on
Friday
,
as
I
walk
down
the
main
street
of
Mallow
I
be
approach
by
transition
year
student
from
St.
Mary
's
secondary
school
.
they
flock
around
I
to
tell
I
they
will
not
be
able
to
carry
out
many
of
the
project
and
aspiration
they
have
for
they
transition
year
because
of
the
cut
.
they
ask
I
to
let
they
voice
be
hear
in
Dáil
Éireann
when
next
I
speak
on
the
subject
.
I
speak
for
that
girl
and
for
the
aspiration
they
have
.
I
speak
for
the
aspiration
I
have
when
I
be
they
age
and
for
the
educational
opportunity
I
have
which
be
limit
because
of
the
time
I
grow
up
in
during
the
1980
.
do
not
send
the
education
system
back
to
the
1980
.
let
we
think
forward
and
consider
the
investment
that
can
be
make
now
and
the
payoff
in
the
long
run
as
a
result
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
National
Council
for

be
the
Taoiseach
's

come
into
play
?
when
do
deputy
Dooley
believe
that
will
be
?
how
many
thousand
of
house
be
empty
now
?
I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Broughan
,
Morgan
and
Costello
.
I
will
begin
with
a
quotation
from
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
report
entitle
Innovation

Ireland

in
2008
:
Ireland

and
on

...
I
repeat
the
second
sentence
:
"

to
respond

of

a

"
.
I
listen
carefully
to
the
minister
and
it
be
hard
to
disagree
with
what
have
be
say
in
that
one
sense
there
be
a
proactive
approach
and
a
continuation
of
strategy
to
maintain
employment
.
however
,
be
I
one
of
the
32000
plus
person
make
redundant
and
thus
have
to
apply
between
1
January
and
the
end
of
this
month
for
assistance
under
the
redundancy
scheme
,
this
would
not
provide
I
with
too
much
solace
.
I
know
of
a
particular
apprentice
—
there
be
hundred
like
he
—
who
,
even
if
he
want
,
could
not
return
to
complete
he
course
because
there
be
no
job
in
he
particular
field
.
the
construction
industry
have
dry
up
.
the
proof
of
this
be
the
current
lack
of
house
building
.
give
this
trend
,
apprentice
be
reluctant
to
continue
they
training
.
I
know
of
a
apprentice
who
,
have
complete
he
leave
certificate
examination
in
2006
,
decide
to
embark
on
a
few
year
'
travelling
.
when
he
return
home
he
take
up
a
apprenticeship
as
a
cabinet
maker
but
be
subsequently
lay
off
.
he
then
decide
,
give
the
trend
that
be
emerge
,
to
do
a
public
relation
course
.
when
the
person
concern
,
who
be
in
receipt
of
jobseeker
's
allowance
,
approach
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
in
respect
of
a
place
on
a
public
relation
course
he
be
tell
he
would
have
to
be
sign
on
for
156
day
before
he
would
quality
for
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
.
this
be
wherein
the
nub
of
the
problem
lie
.
I
refer
early
to
the
thousand
of
people
already
laid
-
off
and
make
redundant
,
many
of
whom
want
to
get
back
into
the
education
sphere
.
I
acknowledge
the
€
1.5
billion
allocation
for
FÁS
and
the
investment
in
sme
.
however
,
many
of
the
people
who
previously
work
in
research
and
development
and
high
-
end
it
job
now
want
to
do
mba
and
to
upskill
but
there
be
no
mechanism
through
which
they
can
re-enter
the
FÁS
or
SME
framework
without
they
incur
serious
economic
hardship
.
this
people
do
not
qualify
for
third
level
grant
or
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
as
they
be
already
in
receipt
of
the
jobseeker
's
allowance
.
be
I
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
House
I
would
be
re-examine
the
demographic
of
this
situation
in
term
of
where
the
lay
-
off
have
take
place
and
the
educational
attainment
of
that
involve
.
I
would
also
be
much
more
flexible
in
my
approach
,
which
be
what
the
government
will
have
to
be
if
unemployment
continue
to
rise
.
a
person
who
be
eligible
for
jobseeker
's
allowance
for
12
month
should
also
be
eligible
for
a
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
if
he
or
she
wish
to
upskill
by
re-enter
the
education
system
.
the
22500
people
currently
engage
in
community
employment
scheme
do
exceptional
work
.
however
,
many
of
this
people
be
hamper
after
a
few
year
by
the
principle
of
progression
,
of
which
we
hear
so
much
.
I
would
also
be
a
little
more
flexible
in
respect
of
the
requirement
to
quit
a
community
employment
scheme
after
a
specify
period
.
I
would
allow
for
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
in
term
of
permit
this
people
,
where
possible
,
to
continue
to
work
in
they
community
and
would
pay
they
the
allowance
require
in
this
regard
.
this
would
help
to
sustain
community
and
would
provide
this
people
with
employment
.
there
have
be
lay
-
off
in
a
wide
range
of
area
,
include
agriculture
,
banking
,
finance
and
insurance
.
a
wide
array
of
people
will
not
necessarily
fit
into
the
training
scheme
envisage
by
government
.
many
people
work
in
the
energy
,
manufacturing
,
building
and
civil
engineering
area
have
be
lay
-
off
and
will
not
get
work
any
time
soon
.
many
of
they
be
reliant
on
the
construction
industry
and
on
the
it
sector
,
in
particular
the
research
and
development
component
of
the
it
sector
,
a
area
almost
always
hit
first
during
a
downturn
.
this
people
be
unable
to
return
to
the
education
system
unless
they
pay
for
it
themselves
.
while
a
unemployed
single
person
with
savings
have
a
good
chance
of
access
a
third
level
course
,
a
unemployed
person
within
a
family
structure
will
need
to
put
aside
every
penny
to
meet
he
or
she
family
circumstance
.
the
government
need
to
apply
some
lateral
thinking
in
this
area
.
it
do
not
appear
to
have
internalise
the
full
extent
of
the
problem
face
unemployed
people
in
the
future
.
instead
of
quote
chapter
and
verse
in
this
house
on
that
which
we
know
already
—
one
have
only
to
look
at
the
Department
's
website
to
learn
what
be
be
spend
—
it
should
bring
forth
fresh
idea
in
regard
to
how
we
people
can
upskill
.
I
acknowledge
the
investment
in
fás
training
for
installation
scheme
and
so
on
.
it
be
once
say
to
I
that
the
next
boom
might
result
from
we
have
to
fix
some
of
the
faulty
and
dodgy
house
construct
in
haste
during
the
past
ten
year
.
it
may
be
that
such
a
scheme
will
be
require
.
however
,
we
must
also
cater
for
high
end
job
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
hundred
,
if
not
thousand
,
of
people
be
currently
unemployed
.
we
need
to
look
after
that
people
who
will
not
necessarily
fit
into
the
mechanism
prescribe
by
the
two
minister
in
they
response
.
I
reiterate
the
government
's
word
that
individual
need
to
respond
.
individual
want
to
respond
to
the
change
market
and
to
this
downturn
.
however
,
they
may
want
to
diversify
into
completely
different
area
of
education
.
this
,
for
some
people
,
be
a
opportunity
to
re-assess
from
where
they
come
.
if
we
be
talk
about
entrepreneurial
spirit
in
this
country
,
the
only
way
it
can
be
reinvigorate
be
if
the
€
179
million
allocate
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
or
€
90
million
spend
on
encourage
FDI
be
re-examine
and
perhaps
apportion
at
least
in
part
to
localised
scheme
for
people
who
have
that
kind
of
spirit
and
who
wish
to
create
indigenous
and
sme
-
type
industry
.
the
2009
budget
require
difficult
choice
to
be
make
across
all
area
of
public
expenditure
.
this
decision
be
make
to
control
public
expenditure
and
to
ensure
sustainability
in
the
long
run
.
in
this
respect
education
while
protect
to
a
much
great
extent
than
most
other
area
of
public
expenditure
could
not
be
totally
spare
.
prudent
management
of
the
government
finances
be
particularly
important
at
this
time
of
global
economic
uncertainty
when
tax
revenue
have
fall
so
significantly
and
when
world
economic
condition
be
so
serious
.
even
with
the
budget
measure
in
place
there
will
still
be
a
significantly
increase
borrowing
requirement
in
2009
.
the
government
's
commitment
to
education
be
clear
both
from
its
track
record
over
the
past
decade
in
provide
substantial
additional
resource
,
most
notably
extra
teacher
to
meet
previously
unmet
need
and
from
the
programme
the
government
set
for
itself
when
it
come
into
office
.
a
lot
have
change
in
the
past
year
and
the
first
and
foremost
imperative
be
that
we
stabilise
the
public
finances
.
it
be
only
by
do
so
that
we
can
shelter
gain
make
and
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
be
able
to
make
improvement
in
the
future
.
what
we
be
do
in
primary
school
from
September
next
be
staff
they
on
the
same
basis
as
they
be
staff
just
over
one
school
year
ago
.
in
term
of
the
position
in
respect
of
any
one
school
for
September
2009
,
school
be
currently
return
datum
to
my
Department
in
relation
to
they
enrolment
as
of
30
September
last
.
my
Department
have
commence
process
this
datum
although
all
school
have
not
yet
make
they
return
.
the
allocation
process
include
notification
to
school
will
commence
early
in
the
New
Year
.
the
allocation
process
include
appellate
mechanism
under
which
school
can
appeal
against
the
allocation
due
to
they
under
the
staffing
schedule
.
the
final
allocation
to
a
school
be
also
a
function
of
the
operation
of
the
redeployment
panel
which
provide
for
the
retention
of
a
teacher
in
a
exist
school
if
a
new
post
be
not
available
within
the
agree
term
of
the
scheme
.
there
be
a
need
to
focus
target
resource
on
the
school
in
most
need
and
this
be
in
line
with
the
broad
thrust
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
which
be
set
out
in
he
report
on
primary
Disadvantage
of
2006
which
,
inter
alia
,
suggest
that
my
Department
should
focus
its
educational
disadvantage
measure
on
that
school
serve
the
most
disadvantaged
community
.
therefore
,
while
have
to
make
difficult
decision
for
the
2009
estimate
,
particularly
in
the
current
financial
climate
,
my
main
focus
have
be
to
retain
resource
in
the
school
target
under
the
deliver
Equality
of
opportunity
in
Schools
(
DEIS
)
initiative
.
DEIS
,
the
action
plan
for
educational
inclusion
,
provide
for
a
standardise
system
for
identify
level
of
disadvantage
and
a
integrate
school
support
Programme
.
as
a
result
of
the
identification
and
review
process
,
876
school
have
be
include
in
the
programme
.
this
comprise
673
primary
school
(
urban
and
rural
)
and
203
second
-
level
school
.
in
the
case
of
that
school
that
have
not
be
identify
for
inclusion
in
DEIS
it
will
now
be
necessary
to
withdraw
disadvantaged
post
and
additional
financial
resource
from
they
with
effect
from
31
August
2009
.
this
resource
have
be
historically
provide
to
school
under
previous
disadvantage
scheme
.
as
the
school
refer
to
by
the
deputy
be
not
identify
for
inclusion
in
the
DEIS
programme
it
be
now
necessary
to
withdraw
its
disadvantaged
area
scheme
post
and
additional
financial
resource
with
effect
from
31

2009

in
light
of
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
report
on
vulnerable
adult
and
the
law
,
which
have
be
publish
for
some
time
,
when
will
the
mental
capacity
Bill
be
publish
?
will
that
Bill
make
provision
to
make
a
person
a
ward
of
court
?
my
second
question
relate
to
the
animal
welfare
Bill
.
before
I
ask
about
the
date
for
publication
,
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
what
constitute
a
consultation
in
anticipation
of
she
answer
.
within
DEIS
,
the
commitment
give
to
early
year
education
be
that
"
the
Department
will
work
in
partnership
with
other
department
and
agency
to
complement
and
add
value
to
exist
childcare
programme
in
disadvantage
community
,
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
the
overall
care
and
education
need
of
the
child
concerned
be
meet
in
a
integrated
manner
.
"
my
department
be
work
with
agency
fund
through
the
Office
of
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
to
improve
the
quality
of
childcare
and
education
in
DEIS
pre-school
area
and
to
work
with
this
agency
on
prioritise
disadvantaged
area
.
one
question
need
to
be
address
regard
this
banking
crisis
,
namely
whether
the
government
guarantee
will
result
in
the
writing
off
of
private
debt
and
turn
that
into
public
debt
for
which
the
Irish
citizen
will
ultimately
pay
.
in
that
context
,
should
we
be
contemplate
the
writing
off
of
private
debt
to
avoid
a
probable
recourse
to
the
taxpayer
?
in
September
of
this
year
,
the
Central
Bank
publish
datum
show
that
the
M1
money
supply
—
the
physical
currency
circulate
in
the
economy
and
the
money
hold
on
deposit
account
—
be
shrink
rapidly
.
what
do
the
11
%
year
-
on
-
year
decrease
in
the
M1
money
supply
tell
we
?
Irish
business
have
less
money
in
they
account
.
they
have
become
stifle
,
they
cannot
repay
they
debt
and
they
cannot
access
credit
.
if
Irish
business
be
not
able
to
repay
they
debt
or
access
credit
,
the
bank
will
incur
further
loss
.
who
will
cover
such
loss
?
the
bank
guarantee
scheme
provide
for
the
Irish
taxpayer
to
cover
loss
to
bank
through
shrinkage
in
the
economy
.
if
banking
activity
be
shrink
,
then
bank
loss
be
inevitable
.
the
Labour
Party
be
propose
a
set
of
practical
measure
,
as
outline
by
deputy
Penrose
,
to
stimulate
the
economy
.
the
European
investment
Bank
,
rather
than
the
private
equity
capitalist
,
have
to
become
we
saviour
.
private
equity
capitalist
do
not
care
about
the
future
of
the
Irish
economy
.
as
soon
as
they
get
they
pound
of
flesh
,
they
move
on
to
the
next
target
.
it
should
be
note
that
the
Carlyle
Group
,
which
be
currently
flirt
with
one
of
this
country
's
bank
,
be
fund
by
Osama
bin
Laden
's
family
at
one
stage
of
its
history
.
I
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
we
be
deal
with
people
of
that
kind
.
we
should
be
very
careful
about
who
we
flirt
with
when
we
be
look
for
people
to
invest
in
the
Irish
economy
and
the
Irish
banking
infrastructure
.
the
Labour
Party
be
in
favour
of
sustainable
and
responsible
investment
.
that
have
not
be
a
mainstream
feature
of
this
country
's
banking
culture
.
have
a
sustainable
and
responsible
approach
to
investment
be
not
part
of
Irish
banking
culture
.
there
be
no
proper
risk
assessment
of
lending
and
there
be
no
proper
model
of
corporate
social
responsibility
.
as
deputy
Penrose
have
say
,
we
need
to
change
the
culture
of
banking
in
this
country
so
that
we
begin
to
lend
in
the
real
economy
.
Irish
business
should
not
continue
to
be
stifle
,
as
they
have
be
stifle
to
date
.
the
new
type
of
lending
we
advocate
will
,
inter
alia
,
champion
social
capital
.
the
former
Taoiseach
,
deputy
Bertie
Ahern
,
use
to
speak
about
Mr.
Putnam
's
book
,
Bowling
Alone
,
in
the
context
of
the
need
for
volunteerism
and
investment
in
social
capital
.
why
should
we
not
use
the
banking
guarantee
scheme
that
the
government
be
sponsor
as
a
means
of
ensure
that
we
enforce
change
in
this
country
's
banking
culture
and
thereby
enhance
investment
in
social
capital
?
why
should
preferential
lending
rate
,
below
the
ECB
rate
,
not
be
offer
to
community
organisation
,
sport
club
and
school
for
any
measure
that
involve
effort
that
enhance
we
community
?
the
banking
crisis
have
give
we
a
opportunity
to
set
up
a
ecological
loan
book
,
whereby
preferential
lending
rate
can
be
make
available
to
commercial
and
domestic
project
that
seek
to
reduce
we
dependence
on
carbon
.
such
loan
would
be
offer
in
respect
of
everything
from
residential
solar
panel
to
biodiesel
plant
.
such
a
system
would
help
we
to
offset
some
of
the
obligation
we
have
under
the
Kyoto
Protocol
.
we
need
to
be
imaginative
in
we
approach
to
lending
and
get
out
of
this
crisis
.
nothing
I
have
see
from
the
government
bench
give
I
confidence
,
as
a
member
of
this
House
and
as
a
citizen
,
that
this
country
be
in
safe
hand

that

infrastructure
be
secure

the
future

when
will
the
animal
welfare
Bill
be
publish
?
have
the
consultation
period
end
yet
?
I
support
the
request
make
last
week
for
a
debate
in
the
House
on
the
implication
of
the
CAP
health
check
,
which
will
have
far
-
reach
effect
on
Irish
agriculture
and
the
way
we
do
business
within
the
rural
economy
.
with
regard
to
the
mental
capacity
Bill
,
the
Law
Reform
Commission
report
have
be
in
existence
since
2006
.
when
will
the
Bill
be
publish
?
the
Taoiseach
have
previously
say
it
will
be
introduce
in
mid-2009
.
I
ask
that
it
be
publish
forthwith
.
that
be
a
imply
acknowledgement
of
the
cowboy
.
the
minister
for
Finance
make
a
call
to
patriotic
action
.
it
be
more
of
a
cull
in
term
of
patriotic
action
because
despite
the
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
the
current
difficulty
we
face
and
the
external
factor
that
have
affect
this
economy
,
there
be
no
imagination
in
term
of
the
framing
of
this
budget
.
there
be
little
by
way
of
provide
a
economic
stimulus
that
would
create
job
and
build
a
foundation
on
which
we
could
climb
out
of
this
morass
if
not
in
the
short
term
at
least
in
the
medium
term
.
instead
of
put
in
place
some
inventive
measure
,
the
government
decide
to
slash
and
burn
across
the
divide
.
to
take
one
sector
,
agriculture
be
a
primary
producer
.
food
and
drink
export
amount
to
€
8.2
billion
to
€
8.6
billion
every
year
but
at
a
time
when
production
be
go
on
in
that
sector
and
in
the
face
of
a
global
food
scarcity
,
the
government
decide
to
take
money
out
of
that
productive
part
of
the
economy
by
way
of
cut
in
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
not
extend
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
.
it
have
be
prove
that
every
euro
spend
within
the
rural
economy
have
a
multiply
effect
and
it
stay
within
the
rural
economy
.
in
cut
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
other
such
scheme
,
the
government
be
automatically
reduce
that
multiplier
effect
and
the
potential
within
what
be
a
productive
sector
.
that
do
not
make
economic
sense
.
I
ask
the
minister
,
when
reply
,
to
address
that
particular
aspect
because
we
need
to
be
imaginative
about
the
direction
in
which
this
country
be
go
in
this
tough
economic
climate
.
the
issue
of
vat
be
one
on
which
I
would
like
the
minister
to
respond
.
if
we
be
in
a
inflationary
period
and
if
there
be
less
money
in
the
economy
,
and
public
and
consumer
sentiment
be
non-existent
,
why
would
the
minister
increase
vat
at
a
time
when
people
be
not
spend
money
?
the
return
to
the
Exchequer
will
be
significantly
reduce
anyway
.
if
the
minister
could
stimulate
such
demand
by
reduce
vat
he
would
,
by
extension
,
increase
return
to
the
Exchequer
.
that
seem
to
be
the
most
logical
approach
.
he
should
not
increase
vat
but
maintain
it
at
the
current
rate
or
reduce
it
marginally
but
he
certainly
should
not
increase
it
in
the
current
climate
.
I
do
not
understand
the
reason
the
minister
have
do
that
,
and
perhaps
we
could
get
a
answer
as
to
he
logic
in
that
regard
.
on
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act
1997
relate
to
research
and
development
activity
,
we
all
agree
that
foreign
direct
investment
have
be
very
good
for
this
country
.
that
be
something
that
have
be
a
bedrock
of
policy
for
a
number
of
year
but
we
need
to
consider
whether
we
should
continue
to
rely
on
foreign
direct
investment
.
I
welcome
the
tax
credit
for
research
and
development
but
I
again
question
the
reason
for
the
base
year
of
2003
.
if
a
company
be
involved
in
research
and
development
there
be
a
good
possibility
that
its
research
could
predate
that
date
.
I
would
have
favour
2000
as
a
base
year
to
try
to
exercise
a
credit
of
that
nature
but
perhaps
there
be
a
logic
to
the
minister
's
position
on
that
.
he
might
respond
to
that
when
reply
.
on
the
issue
of
banking
,
we
need
some
consistency
.
bank
,
by
they
very
nature
,
have
be
profligate
in
the
way
they
have
loan
in
that
much
of
it
be
developer
lead
.
there
be
a
opportunity
now
through
this
state
guarantee
to
enforce
a
new
culture
on
banking
.
I
argue
last
night
in
we
private
Member
's
motion
that
a
ecological
loan
book
could
be
set
up
.
at
a
time
when
not
everybody
will
be
eligible
for
the
national
insulation
scheme
we
could
set
up
a
system
of
preferential
rate
that
would
allow
people
to
borrow
for
improvement
to
they
home
that
would
offset
carbon
.
as
I
understand
that
scheme
,
the
State
have
the
control
to
enforce
that
type
of
lending
and
I
do
not
understand
why
it
do
not
do
that
.
that
would
have
a
knock
-
on
multiplier
effect
in
term
of
job
creation
.
if
preferential
loan
could
be
give
to
people
who
be
not
eligible
for
grant
aid
for
home
improvement
,
it
would
have
a
positive
knock
-
on
effect
for
the
local
economy
.
we
need
a
little
more
imagination
.
while
we
all
acknowledge
the
position
we
be
in
,
four
minister
be
involved
in
the
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
brief
and
surely
many
action
can
be
take
to
stimulate
the
economy
.
this
party
have
give
many
idea
about
what
we
would
do
if
we
be
on
that
side
of
the
House
and
there
be
scope
for
that
to
be
take
on
board
.
there
have
be
much
battering
of
the
public
sector
of
late
.
I
know
umpteen
local
authority
outdoor
staff
on
Cork
County
Council
's
northern
division
who
have
be
let
go
.
they
be
either
on
temporary
contract
or
have
tender
for
job
.
one
of
they
have
work
for
the
council
as
a
JCB
operator
for
more
than
30
year
of
he
life
,
be
out
on
call
at
2
a.m.
,
5
a.m.
or
whenever
the
council
want
he
and
give
a
good
service
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
argument
in
this
House
about
cull
the
public
service
we
must
be
careful
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
worker
of
that
nature
on
the
front
line
,
who
serve
they
local
authority
well
and
have
great
loyalty
to
they
and
to
the
people
they
serve
,
be
be
let
go
.
there
be
people
work
in
FÁS
office
throughout
this
country
with
whom
I
deal
on
a
daily
basis
through
community
employment
scheme
.
I
support
that
people
who
deliver
for
they
community
.
I
distinguish
between
the
work
they
do
and
some
of
the
profligacy
that
may
have
take
place
at
the
top
.
like
the
people
of
Dromakeenan
,
the
people
of
Buttevant
be
proud
of
where
they
come
from
.
they
have
a
equally
dire
need
for
a
new
school
.
they
have
be
campaign
for
such
a
school
for
over
11
year
.
when
I
be
a
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
we
co-ordinate
with
the
local
vec
on
the
rezoning
of
a
specific
parcel
of
land
to
allow
the
new
school
to
be
develop
.
that
site
be
purchase
over
12
month
ago
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
schedule
of
accommodation
be
submit
in
September
of
this
year
.
nothing
have
come
back
from
the
Department
yet
.
the
school
authority
be
seek
the
appointment
of
a
design
team
.
such
a
appointment
should
not
incur
a
undue
cost
.
on
behalf
of
the
community
,
I
want
the
next
stage
of
the
process
to
be
reach
.
like
they
counterpart
in
hundred
of
school
throughout
the
State
,
the
pupil
and
teacher
of
the
vocational
school
in
Buttevant
be
have
to
work
in
dire
circumstance
.
the
building
in
question
date
back
to
pre-Famine
time
.
its
structure
be
not
in
line
with
what
one
would
expect
to
see
in
a
modern
school
.
notwithstanding
the
financial
circumstance
the
State
find
itself
in
,
if
it
be
to
be
progressive
it
need
to
move
this
project
onto
the
next
stage
.
that
would
not
involve
a
major
outlay
.
all
I
be
call
for
at
this
stage
be
the
progression
of
the
project
—
it
should
not
be
stall
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
because
I
have
sum
up
my
point
.
I
have
tab
parliamentary
question
on
this
matter
in
the
past
and
have
raise
it
on
the
adjournment
previously
.
I
will
continue
to
raise
this
issue
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
give
I
a
pro
forma
reply
.
I
appeal
to
the
official
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Science
who
will
be
responsible
for
read
the
transcript
of
this
debate
to
take
up
this
case
and
try
to
move
it
on
to
the
next
stage
.
the
2009
budget
require
difficult
choice
to
be
make
across

area
of

.
this

various
impact
at

be
include

I
will
share
time
with
Deputy
Penrose
and
Ferris
.
I
wish
to
begin
by
reply
to
deputy
Collins
.
not
every
farmer
in
the
country
want
to
build
house
or
become
a
developer
on
he
or
she
land
-
hold
.
that
people
be
in
the
minority
.
I
remind
the
deputy
that
the
arrangement
he
speak
about
be
only
guideline
and
that
the
county
development
plan
of
each
county
take
precedence
over
that
guideline
.
in
response
to
deputy
Brady
,
the
government
in
question
be
not
a
Democratic
Left
-
lead
government
.
there
be
three
party
in
that
particular
arrangement
.
I
represent
a
party
that
traditionally
would
not
be
align
to
the
farming
community
.
however
,
in
term
of
my
wholehearted
support
for
this
motion
,
I
can
give
a
analysis
that
be
unfettered
and
devoid
of
political
expediency
.
I
do
not
intend
to
be
politically
expedient
tonight
,
but
to
speak
of
the
fact
.
we
reside
in
a
European
Union
where
UK
young
farmer
represent
5.6
%
of
the
total
farming
workforce
and
Irish
young
farmer
represent
10.5
%
.
this
percentage
be
from
a
report
from
the
European
Parliament
issue
in
May
2008
and
represent
farmer
under
the
age
of
35
.
if
we
be
to
be
innovative
in
the
manner
we
create
job
during
the
current
downturn
,
we
need
to
create
incentive
.
the
only
way
to
create
incentive
be
to
ensure
that
coterie
of
the
population
—
the
under
35
—
who
be
interested
in
become
involved
in
agriculture
get
the
financial
incentive
to
do
so
.
there
be
a
economic
rationale
for
ensure
the
early
retirement
scheme
and
installation
aid
scheme
for
young
farmer
be
maintain
.
by
allow
this
new
farmer
to
enter
the
sector
,
which
be
a
productive
sector
and
generate
revenue
of
€
8.6
billion
per
annum
in
food
and
drink
export
about
which
the
minister
speak
,
we
encourage
innovation
.
however
,
by
cull
the
scheme
,
we
create
a
disincentive
.
at
a
time
when
,
for
example
,
FÁS
have
a
budget
of
€
1.05
billion
,
we
have
spend
€
48.4
billion
on
the
indigenous
sector
through
Enterprise
Ireland
and
we
be
spend
€
90
million
on
capital
expenditure
for
IDA
Ireland
,
all
of
which
be
for
job
creation
,
there
be
a
ratio
of
that
kind
of
investment
for
every
job
create
.
therefore
,
every
job
create
cost
the
economy
a
certain
amount
,
a
specific
figure
which
I
have
not
be
able
to
ascertain
.
therefore
,
by
create
,
allow
or
facilitate
the
installation
aid
scheme
and
by
invest
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
young
farmer
new
to
the
sector
,
the
government
be
progress
the
sector
and
create
a
job
,
or
in
economic
term
a
multiplier
effect
,
that
ensure
the
rural
economy
will
continue
to
be
maintain
.
this
be
a
rational
,
objective
and
cold
view
that
be
devoid
of
any
political
expediency
.
this
scheme
be
essential
if
we
be
to
maintain
we
comparative
advantage
within
the
rural
economy
.
if
the
government
continue
to
remove
fund
from
the
rural
economy
,
the
rural
depopulation
we
have
witness
,
the
lack
of
proper
infrastructure
and
the
lack
of
expenditure
within
that
economy
will
have
a
further
detrimental
effect
.
any
person
who
avail
of
a
scheme
such
as
the
young
farmer
installation
aid
do
not
spend
the
money
in
Santa
Ponsa
,
but
invest
it
in
he
or
she
own
farmholding
,
generally
in
a
way
that
be
innovative
and
will
increase
the
yield
or
return
to
that
farm
.
to
return
to
the
demographic
,
the
bulk
of
farmer
be
within
a
certain
age
group
and
there
be
a
certain
wisdom
that
come
with
that
intergenerational
solidarity
that
occur
within
the
sector
.
however
,
with
every
new
influx
of
blood
,
there
come
new
idea
.
we
talk
about
issue
such
as
carbon
off
-
setting
and
the
possibility
of
micro-energy
production
,
but
if
we
talk
about
innovative
idea
,
we
need
to
ensure
the
incentive
be
there
to
allow
young
people
come
into
the
sector
.
what
the
minister
have
do
by
cull
the
scheme
be
to
disincentivise
they
and
that
be
not
the
way
to
go
.
I
represent
a
rural
-
urban
mix
of
a
constituency
.
my
constituency
traditionally
have
large
agribusiness
interest
,
but
this
have
decline
over
a
period
of
time
.
there
be
now
a
real
opportunity
for
people
of
my
generation
to
come
into
the
sector
.
this
people
will
have
a
farming
mix
that
will
involve
energy
creation
and
a
different
type
of
product
mix
that
will
yield
benefit
to
the
country
in
the
long
run
.
therefore
,
I
urge
the
minister
to
rethink
the
change
.
I
conclude
by
quote
from
Macra
to
Feirme
,
which
have
a
rational
position
on
this
issue
:
Macra
be
demand
the
complete
reopening
of
the
young
farmer
installation
aid
scheme
.
this
scheme
be
agree
under
the
social
Partnership
for
2007
-
2013
and
be
co-fund
by
the
EU
.
if
it
be
a
co-fund
procedure
devise
under
social
partnership
pillar
,
we
must
honour
the
agreement
,
just
as
we
honour
all
the
other
pillar
of
the
social
partnership
arrangement
in
the
country
.

on
the
basis
that
the
debate
will
take
place
forthwith
,
I
wish
to
withdraw
my
submission
,
with
the
permission
of
the
chair
.
I
will
share
time
with
deputy
Willie
Penrose
.
I
express
solidarity
with
all
pig
producer
in
the
organic
and
non-organic
sector
,
craft
butcher
,
processor
and
every
worker
who
have
be
adversely
affect
by
this
crisis
.
Public
health
and
consumer
confidence
must
be
restore
immediately
.
this
will
be
the
indicator
of
the
future
viability
of
the
pigmeat
industry
.
Producer
have
be
unfairly
plunge
into
a
crisis
which
be
not
of
they
making
.
farm
which
purchase
contaminate
feed
do
so
in
good
faith
and
on
the
basis
that
the
product
be
license
.
the
pork
industry
be
the
fourth
large
in
the
agriculture
sector
and
be
worth
approximately
€400
million
per
annum
.
I
understand
export
of
pigmeat
be
worth
€
212
million
in
2007
.
in
that
context
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
only
ten
of
a
possible
400
producer
have
be
affect
by
contaminate
feed
.
I
understand
the
producer
in
question
produce
less
than
10
%
of
the
overall
kill
.
the
minimal
number
of
producer
affect
should
help
restore
public
confidence
because
if
the
figure
I
cite
be
correct
,
90
%
of
the
pig
kill
be
beyond
reproach
and
scientific
evidence
will
show
that
the
risk
to
human
health
diminish
significantly
.
we
cannot
underestimate
the
importance
of
the
meat
industry
.
have
listen
carefully
to
the
Taoiseach
and
Minister
,
I
note
that
neither
of
they
refer
to
a
timeline
for
the
return
of
pork
to
the
shelf
.
I
understand
from
the
Taoiseach
that
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
must
make
this
call
from
a
scientific
perspective
.
I
call
on
the
authority
and
European
Commission
to
make
allowance
for
the
importance
of
the
meat
industry
to
this
State
.
this
institution
must
act
as
soon
as
possible
to
ensure
product
be
place
on
the
shelf
again
and
public
confidence
restore
.
if
the
European
Union
will
not
provide
a
compensation
package
,
at
least
Commissioner
Kuneva
and
the
EFSA
should
issue
a
statement
within
24
to
48
hour
indicate
that
production
can
commence
again
.
the
true
test
of
patriotism
,
if
I
may
use
that
word
,
be
to
stand
in
solidarity
on
this
issue
.
we
should
not
use
it
to
score
political
point
off
the
minister
.
we
all
know
family
farmer
or
worker
in
processing
plant
whose
livelihood
depend
on
a
viable
pig
and
beef
industry
.
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
fundamental
question
must
be
ask
of
the
Department
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
act
with
great
urgency
and
to
implore
the
European
Commission
to
make
a
statement
forthwith
to
enable
the
industry
to
start
work
again
.
while
the
government
be
correct
to
introduce
a
total
recall
of
pork
product
,
if
the
problem
affect
less
than
10
%
of
producer
and
90
%
of
pork
product
be
thereby
deem
to
be
safe
and
fit
for
human
consumption
,
the
minister
should
have
make
a
statement
in
the
24
to
48
hour
period
follow
the
total
recall
indicate
that
production
could
recommence
.
he
should
clarify
the
reason
this
have
not
be
do
.
if
the
traceability
system
be
work
adequately
and
the
one
-
step
-
up
,
one
-
step
-
back
principle
be
be
adhere
to
,
it
would
have
be
possible
to
isolate
the
relevant
producer
and
stop
they
production
.
this
would
have
allow
other
producer
who
never
use
this
material
to
continue
to
provide
product
for
the
market
.
this
issue
must
also
be
address
.
the
national
feed
inspection
programme
be
a
rigorous
regime
apply
to
all
primary
producer
,
whether
pig
or
beef
farmer
.
everything
which
reach
the
farm
gate
be
subject
to
the
most
stringent
inspection
control
in
the
world
.
why
do
the
inspection
process
for
feedstuff
fail
in
respect
of
the
producer
in
question
?
the
system
failure
which
occur
have
significantly
diminish
the
potential
of
the
pig
and
pigmeat
industry
.
the
sector
will
take
a
long
time
to
claw
its
way
back
to
its
previous
position
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
this
issue
.
we
need
to
show
solidarity
with
all
the
player
in
the
industry
.
this
be
a
national
issue
on
which
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
minister
in
every
step
of
the
process
.
nevertheless
,
the
problem
must
be
handle
with
a
great
sense
of
urgency
.
I
have
three
question
.
will
there
be
a
new
regulatory
framework
deal
with
non
-food
grade
oil
,
as
I
understand
it
?
my
second
question
relate
to
the
routine
sample
of
pork
fat
.
the
minister
state
on
28
November
that
a
routine
sample
of
pork
fat
take
as
part
of
he
Department
's
national
residue
monitoring
programme
be
show
to
be
positive
for
the
presence
of
non-dioxin
-
like
marker
pcb
.
be
there
routine
testing
for
pcb
on
a
ongoing
basis
throughout
the
food
industry
?
on
Friday
,
28
November
we
be
tell
that
this
indicative
testing
take
place
.
on
4
December
the
Department
issue
a
press
release
confirm
a
investigation
into
the
source
of
a
contaminant
in
animal
feed
and
the
restriction
of
a
number
of
farm
.
the
dutch
authority
contact
the
Department
and
the
FSAI
regard
they
independent
investigation
.
when
they
communicate
that
,
how
long
have
the
dutch
authority
's
investigation
be
in
train
?
when
be
the
rapid
alert
system
kick
into
action
?
this
be
also
a
important
point
.
the
minister
have
tell
we
this
all
happen
on
this
island
,
effectively
.
however
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
the
rapid
alert
kick
in
long
before
this
process
and
we
need
some
clarification
on
that
point
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
if
that
trade
notice
go
out
and
the
product
be
verifiable
,
why
be
stock
not
back
on
the
shelf
in
pork
butcher
throughout
the
country
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
we
have
only
have
one
question
from
this
side
of
the
House
so
far
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Willie
Penrose
and
I
propose
to
take
seven
minute
.
something
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
to
the
Agriculture
and
Fishery
Council
,
give
that
we
do
not
have
many
opportunity
to
discuss
fishery
be
the
additional
funding
emergency
measure
be
agree
in
July
.
it
be
still
urgent
that
progress
be
make
to
make
fund
available
at
the
early
possible
date
.
I
understand
that
the
Federation
of
Irish
Fishermen
,
FIF
,
have
make
submission
and
there
be
a
ongoing
campaign
.
we
all
know
that
fuel
price
have
decrease
dramatically
but
the
cost
input
for
fisherman
during
that
period
be
significant
as
be
loss
incur
during
that
period
.
we
should
support
that
measure
.
will
that
€
37
million
expenditure
be
expedite
?
perhaps
the
official
could
revert
to
we
in
due
course
on
this
matter
.
with
the
pend
December
Council
of
Minister
meeting
due
on
18
and
19
December
,
it
be
important
that
this
house
give
time
to
debate
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
have
have
some
significant
briefing
today
from
the
FIF
,
more
specifically
from
the
Irish
South
and
West
Fish
Producer
's
Organisation
,
on
the
issue
.
it
be
worth
reiterate
some
of
the
point
they
make
.
they
state
that
the
decision
take
at
the
December
Council
meeting
will
be
vital
to
the
future
of
the
industry
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
say
he
support
the
appropriate
conservation
measure
for
Celtic
Sea
cod
such
as
spawn
area
closure
which
be
originally
propose
by
fisherman
and
be
deliver
positive
effect
on
stock
level
in
that
area
.
the
organisation
's
position
be
such
that
it
propose
that
the
creation
of
a
sub
-
divide
management
area
separate
the
English
Channel
from
the
rest
of
the
exist
Celtic
Sea
,
have
certain
implication
for
Ireland
.
the
organisation
's
briefing
paper
state
:
the
separation
of
Area
VIId
,
the
English
Channel
,
from
the
remainder
of
Area
VIIb
-k
for
the
purpose
of
management
,
and
the
establishment
of
a
separate
total
allowable
catch
for
that
area
have
significant
implication
for
the
Irish
fishing
industry
.
while
the
measure
be
not
objectionable
in
itself
,
the
subdivision
of
the
stock
must
not
disadvantage
Irish
fisherman
by
directly
divide
the
quota
,
give
Ireland
quota
in
a
area
(
VIId
)
where
Irish
fisherman
do
not
fish
.
Irish
fisherman
catch
most
of
the
Cod
in
the
west
of
the
exist
management
area
,
to
the
south
of
Ireland
.
this
must
be
reflect
in
the
new
subdivision
of
quota
between
the
management
area
.
I
could
not
have
put
the
argument
any
good
.
with
regard
to
the
proposal
on
the
fishing
effort
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
suggest
that
the
European
Commission
be
effectively
re-write
,
after
the
fact
,
the
decision
reach
by
the
Council
.
the
FIF
state
that
the
commission
be
re-write
the
text
of
the
decision
on
fishing
effort
in
the
Irish
Sea
and
the
north
west
which
be
reach
at
last
month
's
EU
Agriculture
and
Fishery
Council
.
this
can
not
be
allow
as
it
would
mean
a
immediate
25
%
cut
in
fishing
possibility
in
2009
,
from
what
be
in
the
decision
which
be
in
itself
misguided
,
draconian
and
punitive
.
the
November
Council
of
Fishery
minister
reach
a
decision
on
a
new
and
intensify
series
of
measure
for
fishery
in
the
Irish
Sea
and
the
north
west
.
I
also
understand
that
the
Irish
government
and
industry
succeed
in
thwart
the
effort
to
have
this
approach
extend
to
the
south
and
west
coast
.
the
FIF
have
state
this
to
I
today
.
the
measure
agree
which
affect
the
Irish
Sea
and
north
west
,
clearly
curtail
fishing
effort
in
the
form
of
kilowatt
-
day
to
the
amount
of
effort
in
previous
base
year
.
it
have
only
come
to
light
in
recent
day
that
the
commission
be
go
significantly
beyond
what
be
agree
and
it
now
propose
in
2009
to
impose
a
further
25
%
cut
from
the
base
effort
.
this
be
contrary
to
all
understanding
of
what
be
agree
.
I
understand
the
minister
may
share
this
position
but
he
need
to
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
House
at
some
stage
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
on
the
Hague
Preference
,
that
they
be
a
integral
part
of
the
tac
,
total
allowable
catch
and
quota
allocation
system
and
they
must
continue
to
be
allocate
or
formally
incorporate
into
the
tac
and
quota
system
and
not
perhaps
subject
to
the
annual
approval
which
they
must
undergo
.
I
understand
the
point
make
by
the
Minister
of
State
when
he
state
that
certain
member
state
would
seek
to
denigrate
or
downgrade
that
agreement
.
the
position
adopt
by
the
FIF
in
continue
to
ensure
that
the
Hague
issue
be
maintain
,
be
paramount
to
the
industry
in
the
future
.
more
recently
there
have
be
positive
interplay
between
the
fisherman
's
organisation
and
the
minister
.
the
emergency
package
agree
in
July
,
however
,
need
to
be
expedite
.
it
be
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
the
industry
.
the
position
be
that
application
have
be
receive
from
three
high
education
institution
for
designation
as
university
.
this
application
raise

the
amendment
in
the
Bill
that
replace

45
(

)
(

)
of
the
Health
Act
1970
,
couple
with
the
fair
deal
legislation
on
nursing
home
,
by
they
very
nature
,
seek
to
destroy
any
semblance
of
public
provision
and
universality
in
the
health
care
system
,
as
it
relate
to
old
people
.
the
research
indicate
that
20000
people
who
have
have
access
to
a
medical
card
will
no
long
have
such
a
entitlement
.
this
send
the
wrong
message
about
how
the
country
deal
with
public
health
to
that
who
be
in
they
autumn
year
.
notwithstanding
the
pre-exist
deal
do
with
general
pracititioner
,
whereby
the
payment
per
patient
would
be
significantly
more
than
it
be
today
,
the
health
outcome
for
patient
in
that
category
be
significantly
good
as
a
result
of
have
a
universal
right
to
a

for
man
,
in

,
have
the
medical
card
mean
a
much
great
likelihood
that
they
would
go
to
they

to

health
.
I
know
of
people
in

who
be
more
inclined
to
go
because
they
have
the
medical

from

I
also
know
that
they
achieve
far
good
outcome
for
they
patient
owe
to
the
entitlement
to
a
medical

.
when
we
talk
about
public
health
and
primary
care
provision
which
be
woefully
inadequate
in
the
part
of
the
country
that
I
represent
,
I
do
not
understand
why
the
minister
would
row
back
on
a
decision
make
to
provide
a
medical
card
when
the
net
benefit
to
the
Exchequer
be
positive
in

speak
about
hysteria
and
the
media
frenzy
whip
up
over
this
issue
.
the
people
who
march
on
Leinster
House
be
not
whip
up
into
a
frenzy
of
hysteria
.
at
the
time
they
take
the
rational
view
that
they
rights
be
be
undermine
.
they
be
rightfully
fearful
of
the
possibility
that
they
entitlement
would
be
take
from
they
in
one
fall
swoop
.
I
be
glad
they
decide
to
organise
and
exercise
they
right
to
protest
.
if
they
have
not
do
so
,
we
would
not
be
here
today
and
the
government
would
not
have
row
back
on
the
position
it
take
on
this
issue
on
budget
day
.
if
we
be
to
exercise
public
health
policy
correctly
,
it
be
clear
that
the
campaign
to
maintain
the
automatic
right
to
a
medical
card
will
need
to
have
a
positive
outcome
.
we
need
to
continue
in
that
vein
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
minister
will
be
able
to
garner
savings
in
this
instance
.
it
seem
that
she
intend
to
reallocate
resource
from
that
whose
automatic
entitlement
be
be
withdraw
to
other
who
might
be
able
to
avail
of
a
medical
card
.
person
on
low
income
will
not
receive
a
medical
card
in
the
current
climate
because
the
threshold
have
not
be
increase
sufficiently
.
I
propose
to

the

give
a
breakdown
of
the

.
the
budget
measure
announce
recently
will
mean
that
the
level
of
language
support
will
be
reduce
from
a
maximum
of
six
extra
teacher
per
school
to
a
maximum
of
two
teacher
per
school
,
as
be
the
case
before
2007
.
as
I
announce
on
budget
day
we
will
provide
for
some
alleviation
for
the
position
of
that
school
where
there
be
a
significant
concentration
of
newcomer
pupil
as
a
proportion
of
the
overall
enrolment
.
this
will
be
do
on
a
case
by
case
basis
.
at
this
time
the
priority
for
my
department
within
the
resource
available
to
it
be
to
carry
out
the
allocation
process
for
2009
/

in
a
timely
manner
.
divert
resource
in
order
to
create
staffing
profile
for
individual
school
or
list
of
school
could
not
be
justify
and
would
actually
impede
this
process
.
moreover
,
OECD
research
in
this
field
(
PISA
2006
)
show
that
Ireland
be
the
OECD
country
with
the
high
distribution
of
newcomer
across
school
mean
that
school
with
high
concentration
of
newcomer
child
be
relatively
unusual
.
ESRI
datum
also
show
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
school
have
high
concentration
of
newcomer
child
.
I
realise
that
standard
be
not
simply
achieve
by
supply
teaching
resource
and
that
the
quality
of
the
support
that
the
child
receive
and
the
inclusive
atmosphere
cultivate
in
school
be
important
factor
influence
the
quality
of
learning
achieve
by
migrant
child
.
my
Department
recognise
that
we
must
monitor
and
review
the
educational
experience
that
be
provide
to
migrant
student
so
that
we
can
improve
the
quality
and
effectiveness
of
we
provision
.
the
Department
be
undertake
a
range
of
research
to
consider
the
question
of
integration
in
school
and
how
good
to
deploy
we
resource
to
ensure
that
all
the
child
in
we
school
can
benefit
from
learning
in
a
intercultural
Ireland
.
my
department
be
provide
support
and
training
for

however
we
be

the

have
a

duty
to
respond
to
this
and
to
take
very
difficult

in
do
this
we
have
attempt

afford
some

give
the

even

I

that

that
they
can
only
be
justify
by
the
imperative
of

I
have
call

both

I
respectfully
ask
that
time
be
make
available
for
a
debate
on
the
2009
allocation
make
by
the
National
Road
Authority
for
non-national
road
.
the
reason
I
seek
a
debate
be
that
County
Cork
have
receive
a
allocation
of
€
61
million
,
the
27th
low
of
the
29
local
authority
.
the
county
have
more
than
11000
kilometer
of
roadway
.
the
reason
I
ask
for
a
debate
be
that
it
be
important
to
examine
the
allocation
make
by
the
NRA
in
relative
term
and
in
the
context
of
Exchequer
expenditure
on
road
,
particularly
in
County
Cork
.
be
it
not
in
order
to
ask
for
a
debate
?
why
?
I
wish
to
record
my
utter
disgust
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
staff
and
patient
of
the
Heatherside
Hospital
in
north
Cork
,
at
the
HSE
's
unilateral
decision
to
close
the
facility
which
have
house
42
patient
for
many
year
.
the
decision
be
illogical
and
without
any
common
sense
basis
.
it
be
take
without
any
consultation
with
the
stakeholder
,
the
nursing
staff
or
the
patient
.
this
be
a
facility
that
have
look
after
patient
with
mental
health
issue
for
several
year
.
what
be
happen
in
society
be
disgusting
.
this
42
patient
will
be
move
into
a
facility
that
be
already
close
down
,
unfit
for
human
habitation
and
with
Dickensian
condition
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
government
or
the
HSE
be
at
,
particularly
when
they
give
we
much
rhetoric
on
how
well
they
look
after
mentally
ill
patient
.
I
be
call
on
they
to
put
a
stay
of
execution
on
this
decision
until
such
time
as
there
be
consultation
with
the
patient
's
representative
,
the
family
and
the
community
to
ensure
everyone
's
rights
and
entitlement
be
vindicate
.
if
we
have
any
sense
of
decency
,
this
issue
will
be
re-examine
.
I
call
on
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
to
intervene
directly
with
the
HSE
to
ensure
the
rights
and
entitlement
of
the
affect
patient
be
protect
and
common
decency
prevail
.
that
be
factually
incorrect
.

the

Bill

with
all
due
respect
that
be
a
inadequate
answer
.
we
have
be
ask
this
question
for
the
past
year
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
people
on

side
of

that
we
be
not
get
the
right
answer

in
light
of
the
Taoiseach
's
announcement
on
Tuesday
,
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
Financial
Regulator
's
proposal
to
examine
a
specific
code
on
mortgage
.
can
the
minister
provide
a
clear
picture
as
to
what
that
entail
?
the
vast
bulk
of
expenditure
by
that
in
the
private
and
public
sector
be
on
mortgage
.
when
will
the
government
introduce
some
scheme
to
grant
relief
to
mortgage
holder
who
lose
they
job
?
while
the
current
rate
of
home
repossession
be
quite
low
,
it
can
be
reasonably
assume
that
the
rate
will
increase
seriously
in
the
next
few
year
.
I
would
like
to
get
some
response
from
the
minister
in
that
regard
.
the
Taoiseach
's
statement
also
refer
to
tax
credit
available
to
company
and
exemption
on
capital
gain
tax
.
if
the
exemption
be
significantly
increase
beyond
€
40000
it
would
give
a
further
incentive
for
people
to
come
into
that
sector
.
the
back
-
to
-
education
allowance
should
be
amend
to
allow
people
who
be
go
to
become
unemployed
to
avail
of
educational
training
,
include
how
to
start
up
they
own
company
,
without
lose
they
entitlement
.
we
need
to
be
a
bit
more
imaginative
.
if
we
be
go
to
create
tax
exemption
base
on
production
in
the
smart
economy
,
one
must
create
incentive
for
people
to
get
into
that
sector
in
the
first
instance
.
I
ask
about
tax
exemption
,
but
get
no
reply
.

on
eligibility
for

the
minister
neglect
to
mention
that
before
the
common
position
be
reach
,
it
be
propose
to
reduce
the
quantity
of
pesticide
supply
or
use
by
50
%
.
that
proposal
do
not
take
into
account
the
national
plant
health
requirement
to
have
certain
substance
available
.
similarly
,
it
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
property
of
the
substance
concerned
.
will
a
list
of
the
specific
pesticide
that
be
to
be
prohibit
as
a
result
of
the
directive
,
or
the
common
position
that
have
be
reach
,
be
provide
?
the
minister
mention
that
people
will
have
to
be
train
to
use
pesticide
.
will
such
training
comprise
another
layer
of
bureaucracy
to
be
deal
with
by
landowner
and
farmer
before
they
can
set
about
they
daily
business
of
grow
crop
?
what
be
the
Irish
position
on
this
directive
?
I
accept
that
the
directive
be
specifically
aim
at
protect
human
and
animal
health
,
which
be
laudable
.
we
need
to
find
out
,
within
the
remit
of
question
Time
,
what
impact
the
directive
will
have
on
farmer
and
landowner
.
will
a
list
of
pesticide
be
prescribe
?
when
minister
speak
about
EU
legislation
,
they
have
a
tendency
to
use
word
like
"
lacuna
"
.
the
minister
's
response
be
somewhat
confusing
.
I
will
try
to
interpret
it
as
good
I
can
when
I
read
the
official
report
.
if
there
be
a
common
position
and
a
framework
for
community
action
,
there
will
be
a
prescribe
set
of
pesticide
use
or
function
.
will
there
be
a
define
list
?
will
pesticide
user
be
require
to
undertake
training
?
do
the
minister
envisage
that
this
will
be
implement
within
a
certain
timeframe
?
the
minister
have
say
that
Ireland
have
a
alliance
with
Britain
and
Hungary
on
this
issue
,
but
what
position
do
the
three
country
take
?
do
Ireland
abstain
when
the
vote
be
take
on
the
final
common
position
?
do
Ireland
vote
against
it
?
I
understand
the
target
set
by
the
EU
Commission
for
the
production
of
biofuel
be
10
%
by
2020
.
the
European
Parliament
and
its
environment
committee
,
which
consist
of
member
from
across
the
political
divide
,
vote
to
scale
down
the
propose
EU
-
wide
target
of
10
%
by
2020
to
4
%
by
2015
.
notwithstanding
the
1800
hectare
of
miscanthus
plant
,
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
,
we
have
move
from
the
planting
of
137
hectare
of
energy
crop
in
2003
to
just
more
than
9000
hectare
in
2007
,
which
represent
approximately
0.02
%
of
all
agricultural
land
.
Teagasc
have
estimate
that
potentially
75000
to
100000
hectare
of
land
could
be
devote
to
energy
crop
in
Ireland
without
impact
negatively
on
food
production
.
be
the
target
that
have
be
set
realistic
?
be
the
government
do
enough
to
encourage
farmer
to
get
into
the
business
of
grow
crop
for
fuel
?
how
will
the
food
versus
fuel
debate
impact
on
Ireland
?
what
be
the
government
do
to
encourage
more
farmer
to
diversify
into
such
production
?
be
there
a
ready
market
available
for
fuel
crop
?
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
it
be
hardly
a
bureaucratic
target
,
it
be
a
political
target
that
be
reach
partly
with
the
agreement
of
the
green
movement
throughout
the
European
Union
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
when
I
say
that
.
we
be
currently
at
a
point
where
fuel
price
have
decrease
due
to
the
fall
in
oil
price
.
the
government
have
a
tendency
to
take
its
foot
off
the
pedal
with
regard
to
develop
a
coherent
and
long
-
term
policy
.
post
CAP
reform
,
there
will
be
a
abyss
into
which
many
Irish
farmer
will
fall
.
there
will
be
significant
loss
of
revenue
.
this
be
one
way
in
which
the
slack
can
be
take
up
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
government
must
come
back
to
the
House
with
a
define
government
policy
on
how
farmer
can
look
to
the
future
with
regard
to
alternative
energy
production
and
the
creation
of
market
.
the
question
be
whether
there
will
be
a
loss
of
money
to
farmer
.
the
point
of
modulation
,
as
the
minister
have
state
,
be
to
contribute
towards
environmental
measure
such
as
water
conservation
.
will
the
money
involve
be
control
by
the
Department
?
will
they
be
pay
directly
to
farmer
,
or
will
they
be
pay
to
other
agency
as
determine
by
the
Department
to
administer
that
scheme
?
the
point
be
whether
farmer
will
lose
money
through
the
measure
that
be
suppose
to
be
incorporate
within
modulation
.
to
what
extent
do
the
minister
believe
that
the
commodification
of
dairy
product
and
the
fact
that
they
be
tradeable
commodity
have
a
effect
on
the
market
and
on
the
price
of
milk
for
Irish
farmer
?
this
should
be
take
into
account
.
be
there
discussion
at
EU
level
or
within
the
WTO
framework
to
tackle
the
fact
that
commodification
be
cause
great
vagary
in
price
?
that
be
have
a
impact
on
the
market
here
.
I
anticipate
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
spend
some
time
in
the
air
to
visit
some
of
the
event
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
there
be
a
significant
budget
for
Bord
Bia
.
it
be
money
well
spend
when
one
think
of
the
return
.
the
€
8
billion
to
€9
billion
in
food
export
will
be
one
of
the
saviour
if
this
economy
be
to
lift
itself
out
of
recession
.
the
emphasis
on
food
production
will
be
vital
in
that
sense
.
have
there
be
a
full
restoration
of
the
market
in
light
of
the
pork
dioxin
scare
?
I
refer
to
the
market
prior
to
6
December
.
as
I
understand
it
,
we
have
lose
some
market
share
to
the
UK
because
of
the
sterling
differential
,
which
be
a
major
factor
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
answer
but
we
need
to
step
up
we
effort
in
term
of
the
potential
of
continental
Europe
give
that
we
have
33
%
of
export
there
currently
.
there
be
a
great
potential
in
continental
Europe
.
I
do
not
necessarily
expect
the
Minister
of
State
to
come
back
with
a
reply
on
that
one
give
the
timeframe
—
it
be
just
by
way
of
a
general
comment
.
we
wish
to
support
the
motion
on
the
basis
that
the
permutation
of
the
HSE
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
for
the
delivery
of
care
for
people
in
the
mid-west
will
have
untold
consequence
for
that
who
do
not
live
in
the
region
serve
by
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
in
address
this
motion
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
for
the
southern
region
,
where
the
national
service
plan
have
be
publish
.
we
have
also
recently
receive
a
document
from
the
HSE
state
that
new
efficiency
to
the
value
of
€
80
million
be
seek
in
its
operation
.
the
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
have
not
be
publish
in
the
south
.
have
read
the
Fine
Gael
motion
and
the
prescription
of
the
Teamwork
-
Howarth
report
for
the
mid-west
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
delivery
of
service
in
the
combine
Munster
region
,
as
espouse
in
this
document
,
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
hospital
in
Nenagh
,
Ennis
and
Mallow
.
while
I
might
be
accuse
of
be
parochial
,
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
hospital
in
Mallow
be
like
that
in
Ennis
and
Mallow
,
and
to
address
this
as
a
Munster
-
wide
issue
.
there
have
be
no
politically
accountable
,
coherent
analysis
of
the
HSE
's
proposal
.
this
be
the
first
time
that
the
House
have
have
a
opportunity
to
properly
debate
they
implication
and
it
be
happen
on
Opposition
time
.
the
government
should
make
time
available
to
debate
the
issue
adequately
so
that
we
can
go
through
the
implication
of
this
proposal
euro
by
euro
,
and
hospital
by
hospital
.
we
have
witness
the
erosion
by
stealth
of
service
at
the
former
county
hospital
in
Mallow
.
a
ct
scanner
be
put
in
place
a
few
year
ago
and
become
operational
last
year
for
approximately
ten
to
15
hour
per
week
,
but
now
run
for
between
four
and
six
hour
per
week
.
last
week
,
we
find
out
that
the
ear
,
nose
and
throat
service
will
be
take
away
in
one
fall
swoop
.
we
have
also
be
notify
that
no
child
under
the
age
of
16
will
be
treat
within
the
hospital
and
that
the
long
-
term
plan
be
to
replace
the
accident
and
emergency
unit
with
a
nurse
-
lead
minor
injury
clinic
.
the
motion
note
that
between
15
and
30
people
be
regularly
on
trolley
for
over
24
hour
in
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
if
service
in
Mallow
be
further
reduce
the
same
will
apply
to
Cork
University
Hospital
.
we
in
the
Munster
region
be
argue
for
a
re-think
of
the
policy
.
clinician
who
advise
I
,
and
the
120
gps
who
serve
the
hospital
,
say
that
there
should
be
no
diminution
in
service
in
Mallow
general
hospital
until
the
HSE
can
guarantee
that
the
service
be
available
in
Cork
University
Hospital
.
that
be
the
logic
of
the
argument
be
apply
to
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
and
to
the
hospital
in
Nenagh
and
Ennis
.
there
be
a
complete
lack
of
foresight
in
the
approach
to
this
.
every
time
I
raise
the
issue
with
the
upper
echelon
of
the
HSE
management
in
the
southern
region
,
I
meet
vague
answer
and
lack
of
specifics
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
minister
can
dress
up
the
service
plan
for
the
southern
region
as
a
configuration
,
or
a
reconfiguration
,
because
it
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
the
service
be
deliver
to
the
catchment
area
of
Mallow
,
Ennis
and
Nenagh
.
that
who
reside
in
the
catchment
area
will
have
to
travel
further
to
get
into
Cork
University
Hospital
and
Limerick
Regional
which
will
force
more
people
through
a
narrow
bottleneck
.
the
service
and
capacity
do
not
exist
within
that
hospital
.
there
be
no
logic
in
seek
to
further
downgrade
the
satellite
hospital
that
serve
Cork
University
and
Limerick
Regional
Hospital
.
we
want
a
proper
debate
on
this
and
I
ask
that
the
government
make
time
available
for
it
.
I
appreciate
that
Fine
Gael
raise
this
issue
and
we
support
it
.
how
much
time
do
I
have
leave
?
why
be
Fianna
Fáil
deputy
elect
by
this
constituency
allow
this
to
happen
?
why
do
that
deputy
constantly
move
to
blame
it
on
the
HSE
?
be
we
to
believe
that
Professor
Drumm
,
by
virtue
of
he
management
of
the
HSE
,
be
the
de
facto
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
?
be
there
no
voice
on
the
government
backbench
from
the
Munster
region
serve
by
the
hospital
at
Mallow
,
Ennis
and
Nenagh
that
will
call
a
halt
to
what
the
HSE
be
try
to
do
?
if
we
proceed
with
the
degradation
of
service
at
this
hospital
there
be
no
way
that
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
and
Limerick
Regional
will
be
able
to
deal
with
the
capacity
.
that
will
have
untold
consequence
.
the
hospital
in
Mallow
serve
over
100000
people
in
four
county
.
I
speak
to
the
staff
in
Cork
University
hospital
and
if
one
visit
it
on
any
give
day
,
one
will
see
that
the
accident
and
emergency
unit
cannot
cope
with
the
number
come
through
.
why
would
the
government
seek
to
further
diminish
service
to
the
satellite
hospital
?
we
support
the
motion
and
believe
that
if
the
government
backbencher
who
represent
constituency
serve
by
the
hospital
at
Ennis
,
Nenagh
and
Mallow
have
any
backbone
they
will
support
such
motion
because
in
that
way
they
will
support
the
people
.
currently
there
be
282
prefabricate
unit
be

I
wish
to
share
my
time
with
Deputy
Morgan
and
Ó
Caoláin
.
I
propose
to
take
ten
minute
.
the
Bill
be
be
present
to
we
against
a
backdrop
of
a
announcement
today
that
AIB
be
to
write
off
€
1.8
billion
in
bad
loan
for
2008
.
the
minister
be
ask
the
House
to
support
a
Bill
that
will
recapitalise
that
same
bank
to
the
tune
of
€
3.5
billion
.
that
be
laudable
but
only
if
it
result
in
provision
of
credit
line
to
business
and
borrower
in
general
.
the
Labour
Party
must
critically
assess
the
proposal
bring
before
we
in
the
Bill
.
as
I
understand
it
,
€
4
billion
of
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
's
current
resource
will
be
use
as
part
of
that
recapitalisation
,
out
of
the
total
of
€
7
billion
.
bear
in
mind
that
the
global
market
be
not
touch
Irish
stock
currently
,
I
wonder
whether
that
be
a
wise
move
and
whether
the
methodology
the
minister
propose
in
the
Bill
be
not
without
its
flaw
.
we
be
tell
by
the
minister
that
he
have
consult
widely
with
financial
and
property
expert
in
draft
this
Bill
.
I
would
like
to
know
who
be
that
financial
and
property
expert
.
I
become
a
little
afraid
when
I
hear
of
minister
take
the
advice
of
property
expert
give
the
culture
we
have
be
use
to
in
recent
year
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
nature
of
that
advice
and
whether
there
be
a
alternative
advice
to
that
on
which
he
have
base
he
Bill
.
for
example
,
what
be
the
alternative
advice
,
if
any
,
on
devolve
more
power
to
the
minister
with
regard
to
direct
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
Commission
"
to
make
investment
in
such
institution
and
to
underwrite
they
share
issue
"
?
such
a
concentration
of
power
must
be
question
and
the
minister
must
tell
we
whether
there
be
scope
for
this
power
to
be
abuse
.
it
be
a
theoretical
question
but
in
term
of
the
enactment
of
a
law
it
be
worthy
of
answer
by
the
minister
in
he
reply
.
for
instance
,
if
the
minister
determine
,
for
political
expediency
,
that
a
investment
should
be
make
in
a
specific
financial
institution
,
and
if
the
NPRF
determine
that
this
be
contrary
to
any
responsible
investment
policy
,
it
be
powerless
to
act
against
such
a
move
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
responsible
investment
policy
be
one
of
the
key
component
underpin
the
governance
of
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
.
furthermore
,
invest
such
power
in
the
minister
bypass
this
House
and
any
scrutiny
we
may
wish
to
pursue
in
this
regard
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
address
that
point
when
reply
to
the
debate
.
in
he
contribution
the
minister
tell
we
that
the
State
will
get
a
direct
return
for
its
investment
.
in
the
current
climate
,
and
in
the
context
of
AIB
's
write
-
down
of
€
1.8
billion
today
,
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
any
return
to
the
taxpayer
any
time
soon
.
I
understand
that
if
we
take
the
long
-
term
view
a
alternative
view
could
be
argue
but
the
fundamental
principle
underpin
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
be
the
responsible
investment
policy
.
that
be
a
state
policy
that
give
rise
to
the
need
to
meet
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
of
social
welfare
pension
and
public
service
pension
to
be
pay
from
the
year
2025
to
2055
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
the
Bill
should
,
ceteris
paribus
,
yield
a
return
to
the
Exchequer
over
a
long
-
term
period
if
a
number
of
assumption
be
take
.
if
we
assume
there
be
no
restructuring
of
the
banking
regime
in
this
country
within
that
period
of
time
,
that
be
,
that
no
bank
will
merge
or
there
will
be
no
rationalisation
or
consolidation
of
banking
,
then
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
taxpayer
will
see
a
return
on
he
or
she
investment
but
I
question
the
minister
's
strategy
in
that
regard
.
that
we
invest
with
the
possibility
of
a
return
be
fair
enough
but
the
manner
in
which
the
minister
have
pitch
the
propose
return
on
the
investment
speak
to
I
of
a
ill
-
think
out
strategy
that
allow
the
bank
to
dictate
the
term
by
which
they
will
be
recapitalise
and
not
the
people
,
through
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
whose
money
will
be
use
for
this
purpose
.
the
minister
propose
to
get
a
preference
share
with
a
fix
dividend
of
8
%
or
ordinary
share
in
lieu
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
explain
the
reason
he
be
propose
to
take
preference
share
in
the
first
instance
instead
of
ordinary
share
.
if
the
minister
be
buy
preference
share
with
a
fix
dividend
at
today
's
price
,
what
will
be
the
total
yield
to
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
if
that
share
be
buy
back
by
the
bank
within
the
five
year
period
?
I
understand
they
have
a
provision
to
do
so
or
they
be
allow
to
do
so
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
minister
have
allow
the
bank
a
provision
to
buy
back
share
within
the
five
year
period
at
today
's
price
.
I
question
the
validity
of
such
a
strategy
and
wonder
if
it
would
have
be
more
expedient
for
the
taxpayer
's
money
,
through
the
NPRF
,
to
be
use
to
buy
ordinary
share
.
that
would
have
be
a
more
responsible
strategy
.
if
the
two
bank
report
loss
within
the
next
five
year
,
what
will
be
the
status
of
the
8
%
yield
on
that
preference
?
also
,
what
will
happen
to
the
yield
?
if
there
be
a
return
of
8
%
,
where
will
that
yield
be
invest
?
will
it
be
award
to
the
NPRF
?
I
would
also
like
to
know
what
the
minister
mean
,
in
layman
's
term
,
when
he
state
that
he
will
allow
the
commission
to
set
up
a
special
purpose
investment
vehicle
.
notwithstanding
that
I
have
a
degree
in
economics
,
I
admit
with
a
degree
of
humility
that
I
do
not
have
a
clue
what
a
special
purpose
investment
vehicle
be
.
when
we
be
write
legislation
in
this
house
,
and
if
we
be
use
taxpayer
's
money
to
underpin
a
strategy
of
recapitalisation
,
we
must
have
it
set
out
to
we
in
clear
term
what
exactly
that
mean
.
if
the
minister
be
to
be
give
devolve
power
and
if
we
be
set
up

we
must
know
for
exactly
what
purpose
they
be
design
and
,
if
there
be
a
return
on
such
a
vehicle
,
the
nature
of
that
return
and
how
that
investment
will
be
pitch
.
will
they
be
for
philanthropic

will
they
be

will
there

what
will
be
the
nature
of

the
people
be
entitle
to
know
that
and
it
must
be
set
out
clearly
in
any
legislation
that
be
bring
before
the
House
.
I
wish
to
address
some
point
make
by
deputy
Gogarty
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
personal
in
my
response
to
he
contribution
early
but
I
wish
to
state
for
the
record
that
I
have
never
take
a
bribe
or
a
red
cent
from
any
corporate
entity
,
except
through
a
fund
-
raising
race
event
I
hold
whereby
local
company
buy
in
to
a
race
night
I
run
when
I
be
raise
fund
to
try
to
get
elect
to
this
House
.
there
be
a
desire
by
deputy
Gogarty
to
impugn
certain
member
of
this
House
and
develop
a
language
that
state
that
we
be
not
credible
to
critically
analyse
any
measure
that
come
forth
from
this
government
in
respect
of
any
tract
of
legislation
because
somehow
we
respective
party
in
opposition
be
dirty
by
the
fact
that
they
may
have
take
corporate
donation
.
I
wish
to
state
for
the
record
that
I
have
never
take
corporate
donation
in
that
sense
of
the
word
.

the
financial
crisis
be
due
to
both
external
and
internal
factor
,
external
in
that
the
belief
we
hold
regard
the
behaviour
of
bank
and
financial
market
as
actor
in
a
real
economic
setting
have
be
challenge
like
never
before
.
it
must
be
say
that
somewhere
in
the
recess
of
we
mind
there
be
a
nebulous
idea
that
the
global
financial
economic
structure
be
base
on
a
false
premise
but
we
never
realise
just
how
much
the
Irish
banking
sector
be
tie
to
that
false
premise
.
we
be
now
leave
with
a
new
rhetoric
from
the
centre
leave
and
centre
right
about
the
role
of
the
State
.
the
question
for
all
of
we
be
how
to
construct
a
new
narrative
for
the
position
we
be
in
and
a
solution
for
the
next
generation
.
this
country
be
over
-
reliant
on
tax
receipt
from
stamp
duty
.
that
issue
will
be
analyse
until
kingdom
come
and
there
be
nothing
that
I
can
bring
to
that
analysis
that
be
new
.
the
question
now
be
how
we
get
ourselves
out
of
this
morass
and
restore
we
economic
well
-
being
,
and
what
we
can
do
to
ensure
a
sustainable
economic
and
social
model
into
the
future
.
the
restoration
of
the
economy
must
be
base
on
strong
government
intervention
and
co-decision
making
with
we
European
Union
partner
.
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
have
vanish
and
the
question
remain
as
to
what
will
replace
it
.
this
country
be
nowhere
near
a
fiscal
stimulus
plan
and
all
talk
of
change
,
President
Obama
style
,
be
futile
.
what
we
need
now
be
a
new
definition
of
the
role
of
market
and
the
role
of
the
State
regard
market
behaviour
.
I
be
encourage
by
the
fact
that
the
European
Commission
publish
proposal
last
week
that
would
set
up
a
pan-European
regulatory
body
with
strong
power
to
intervene
in
national
regulation
.
unfortunately
,
that
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
Ireland
's
soft
attitude
in
regulate
the
behaviour
of
financial
institution
.
we
await
the
political
outcome
of
such
proposal
and
I
hope
the
government
will
support
that
initiative
.
it
be
necessary
if
it
be
to
send
a
message
to
global
market
that
Ireland
be
get
its
house
in
order
.
if
the
government
be
to
restore
public
finances
it
must
also
restore
confidence
.
the
restoration
of
confidence
will
ensure
that
investor
will
once
again
begin
to
look
at
Ireland
.
give
that
we
be
a
open
economy
,
it
be
vital
that
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
be
see
in
a
positive
light
.
I
be
encourage
by
the
fact
that
the
EU
monetary
affair
Commissioner
have
state
publicly
that
any
country
in
crisis
will
receive
financial
assistance
in
advance
of
the
International
Monetary
Fund
knock
on
we
door
.
we
must
be
encourage
by
that
signal
.
in
term
of
the
motion
before
we
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
any
government
strategy
have
to
incorporate
we
European
Union
partner
.
without
they
,
we
be
doom
.
in
put
forward
this
idea
I
be
conscious
that
a
new
language
must
emerge
,
which
be
one
of
social
solidarity
.
this
government
have
seek
to
pitch
sectional
interest
against
each
other
.
we
need
a
new
language
that
do
not
put
the
private
sector
against
the
public
sector
or
the
urbanite
against
the
rural
dweller
.
any
intervention
make
by
government
must
be
base
on
equity
and
on
the
basis
that
each
bear
the
pain
in
accordance
with
they
ability
to
pay
.
we
all
have
idea
.
we
membership
of
this
house
be
base
on
the
notion
that
we
put
forward
idea
to
get
elect
here
.
I
suggest
we
examine
the
notion
of
social
capital
.
amidst
this
economic
storm
there
be
practical
solution
that
would
put
thousand
to
work
if
the
government
think
more
laterally
about
its
policy
intervention
.
many
community
be
in
need
of
serious
investment
in
term
of
public
work
that
could
be
carry
out
at
a
extra
marginal
cost
but
that
would
yield
a
massive
return
in
term
of
add
to
the
quality
of
this
country
's
citizen
's
life
.
we
need
a
proactive
government
intervention
at
the
most
basic
and
community
level
to
ensure
we
community
can
survive
.
in
that
light
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
in
the
past
six
month
my
colleague
within
the
Labour
Party
have
put
forward
some
concrete
proposal
,
we
wish
to
work
in
a
positive
sense
to
try
to
do
what
we
can
to
get
this
country
up
and
run
again
.
today
I
speak
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
Róisín
Shortall
,
who
put
forward
proposal
on
the
inclusion
of
certain
person
within
the
tax
net
.
in
the
past
two
week
or
so
,
we
have
hear
many
social
commentator
speak
about
the
fact
that
38
%
of
the
population
be
currently
outside
the
tax
net
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
mini
-
budget
in
the
come
month
and
if
we
be
talk
about
change
the
tax
code
or
increase
personal
taxation
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
there
be
large
number
within
that
38
%
bracket
who
be
pensioner
and
low
pay
.
if
the
government
propose
to
bring
more
people
into
the
tax
net
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
of
equity
and
not
on
the
basis
of
make
sure
that
that
people
on
marginal
or
low
income
be
not
tax
unfairly
.
I
wish
to
advise
the
deputy
that
a
new
Community
College
be
under
construction
in
Adamstown
,
which
will
cater
for
1000
pupil
.
this
school
building
be
plan
to
come
on
stream
in
2009
and
will
operate
under
the
patronage
of
County
Dublin
vec
.
base
on
current
demographic
trend
,
my
Department
anticipate
that
there
will
be
a
need
for
a
further
post
-
primary
school
in
Lucan
in
the
medium
term
to
cater
for
a
long
-
term
project
enrolment
of
1000
pupil
.
my
Department
have
be
in
contact
with
South
Dublin
County
Council
regard
a
potential
site
for
future
educational
provision
in
the
area
,
and
have
arrange
a
technical
inspection
of
the
various
site
option
identify
by
South
Dublin
County
Council
.
this
option
be
currently
be
consider
and
the
Department
will
be
in
further
contact
with
South
Dublin
County
Council
in
the
come
week
regard
the
matter
.
I
thank
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
for
share
time
with
I
.
I
will
start
with
a
simple
question
—
will
the
minister
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
?
I
want
a
clear
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
from
she
.
if
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
keep
the
hospital
open
,
people
want
to
know
the
extent
of
its
service
in
future
.
we
have
be
meet
with
nothing
but
confusion
and
obfuscation
concern
the
provision
of
service
in
the
HSE
south
region
in
recent
month
.
we
have
have
the
national
service
plan
2009
,
the
reconfiguration
of
hospital
report
for
the
HSE
south
region
,
which
be
also
publish
this
year
,
and
we
have
also
have
the
teamwork
report
and
the
Howarth
report
.
now
we
be
be
tell
that
Professor
John
Higgins
will
examine
proposal
on
savings
that
will
be
garner
as
a
result
of
the
cut
to
be
implement
.
the
people
of
the
HSE
south
region
want
to
know
what
will
happen
by
way
of
fact
,
figure
and
timeline
.
we
be
sick
of
this
culture
that
exist
whereby
the
only
person
who
will
answer
publicly
for
HSE
decision
be
Professor
Drumm
.
we
want
to
know
why
people
in
the
hospital
network
office
of
the
HSE
south
region
,
and
other
such
high
-
rank
figure
,
be
not
speak
publicly
and
answer
in
proper
,
public
fora
for
the
decision
they
be
take
.
there
be
a
positive
alternative
to
the
scenario
that
be
currently
provide
by
the
HSE
south
region
.
the
minister
must
listen
to
gps
who
be
refer
to
hospital
like
Mallow
and
Cork
University
Hospital
.
she
must
listen
to
people
work
at
the
coalface
.
if
we
listen
more
to
doctor
and
other
health
professional
and
less
to
the
coterie
of
managerial
mandarin
,
we
would
be
able
to
effect
a
proper
system
that
could
guarantee
health
service
to
the
public
.
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
I
want
to
know
today
if
she
intend
to
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
on
behalf
of
that
region
's
taxpayer
,
I
also
want
to
know
what
future
scenario
she
envisage
for
the
hospital
.
we
can
rotate
far
more
discipline
from
Cork
University
Hospital
through
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
in
addition
,
we
can
enhance
the
service
at
Mallow
and
add
value
to
they
.
that
case
be
also
be
make
by
health
professional
who
be
operate
in
that
catchment
area
.
we
need
proper
answer
without
obfuscation
.
early
,
I
ask
whether
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
close
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
would
like
a
clear
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
.
I
understand
the
minister
reply
by
state
it
would
be
subject
to
revise
service
plan
.
in
the
event
that
the
subject
plan
do
not
adhere
to
standard
lay
down
by
the
Department
,
what
do
she
envisage
for
the
future
of
the
hospital
?
we
need
clarity
on
this
once
and
for
all
.
the
school
refer
to
by
the
deputy
be
approve
funding
of
€
120000
for
the
provision
of
a
additional
classroom
.
the
management
seek
a
increase
grant
toward
the
provision
of
additional
accommodation
over
and
above
that
approve
.
the
school
be
advise
that
in
the
context
of
the
funding
available
and
the
number
of
application
for
that
funding
,
they
application
be
not
successful
.
a
appeal
from
the
school
management
be
under
consideration
and
a
decision
will
be
convey
in
due
course
.
I
have
consistently
say
that
the
2009
budget
require
difficult
choice
to
be
make
across
all
area
of
public
expenditure
.
this
decision
be
make
to
control
public
expenditure
and
to
ensure
sustainability
in
the
long
run
.
in
this
respect
education
,
while
protect
to
a
much
great
extent
than
most
other
area
of
public
expenditure
,
could
not
be
totally
spare
.
the
various
impact
at
school
level
be
include
in
the
budget
day
announcement
.
even
with
the
budget
measure
in
place
there
will
still
be
a
significantly
increase
borrowing
requirement
in
2009
.
the
budget
measure
will
impact
on
individual
school
in
different
way
depend
on
whether
enrolment
be
rise
or
decline
and
the
degree
to
which
any
one
school
have
more
teacher
than
it
be
entitle
to
under
the
allocation
process
.
in
term
of
the
position
at
individual
school
level
the
key
factor
for
determine
the
level
of
resource
provide
by
my
Department
be
the
pupil
enrolment
at
30
September
2008
.
the
annual
process
of
seek
this
enrolment
datum
from
school
take
place
in
the
autumn
and
the
datum
have
since
be
receive
and
process
in
my
department
enable
the
commencement
of
the
process
by
which
teaching
resource
be
allocate
to
school
for
the
school
year
that
begin
next
September
.
my
Department
have
write
to
the
primary
school
that
be
project
to
have
a
net
loss
or
gain
in
classroom
teaching
post
in
September
,
2009
.
as
part
of
my
effort
to
ensure
that
relevant
information
be
openly
available
to
the
public
detailed
information
on
the
open
position
for
primary
school
be
now
publish
on
my
Department
's
website
.
this
provisional
list
set
out
the
detail
on
individual
school
that
,
take
collectively
,
be
project
to
gain
128
post
and
to
lose
382
post
—
a
net
reduction
of
254
post
.
it
be
my
intention
to
have
this
information
update
and
ultimately
to
set
out
the
final
position
when
the
allocation
process
be
complete
.
the
above
allocation
be
provisional
at
this
stage
and
reflect
the
initial
allocation
position
.
the
final
position
for
any
one
school
will
depend
on
a
number
of
other
factor
such
as
additional
post
for
school
that

the

until

at
that
stage
the
allocation

will
be
fully

for
mainstream
classroom

and
any

to
the

Board
will
have

in

of

from

be
under

and
a
decision
will
be
convey
in

.
I
have
consistently
say
that
the
2009
budget
require
difficult
choice
to
be
make
across
all
area
of
public
expenditure
.
this
decision
be
make
to
control
public
expenditure
and
to
ensure
sustainability
in
the
long
run
.
in
this
respect
education
,
while
protect
to
a
much
great
extent
than
most
other
area
of
public
expenditure
,
could
not
be
totally
spare
.
the
various
impact
at
school
level
be
include
in
the
budget
day
announcement
.
even
with
the
budget
measure
in
place
there
will
still
be
a
significantly
increase
borrowing
requirement
in
2009
.
the
budget
measure
will
impact
on
individual
school
in
different
way
depend
on
whether
enrolment
be
rise
or
decline
and
the
degree
to
which
any
one
school
have
more
teacher
than
it
be
entitle
to
under
the
allocation
process
.
in
term
of
the
position
at
individual
school
level
the
key
factor
for
determine
the
level
of
resource
provide
by
my
Department
be
the
pupil
enrolment
at
30
September
2008
.
the
annual
process
of
seek
this
enrolment
datum
from
school
take
place
in
the
autumn
and
the
datum
have
since
be
receive
and
process
in
my
department
enable
the
commencement
of
the
process
by
which
teaching
resource
be
allocate
to
school
for
the
school
year
that
begin
next
September
.
my
Department
have
write
to
the
primary
school
that
be
project
to
have
a
net
loss
or
gain
in
classroom
teaching
post
in
September
,
2009
.
as
part
of
my
effort
to
ensure
that
relevant
information
be
openly
available
to
the
public
detailed
information
on
the
open
position
for
primary
school
be
now
publish
on
my
Department
's
website
.
this
provisional
list
set
out
the
detail
on
individual
school
that
,
take
collectively
,
be
project
to
gain
128
post
and
to
lose
382
post
—
a
net
reduction
of
254
post
.
it
be
my
intention
to
have
this
information
update
and
ultimately
to
set
out
the
final
position
when
the
allocation
process
be
complete
.
the
above
allocation
be
provisional
at
this
stage
and
reflect
the
initial
allocation
position
.
the
final
position
for
any
one
school
will
depend
on
a
number
of
other
factor
such
as
additional
post
for
school
that
be
develop
rapidly
and
post
allocate
as
a
result
of
the
appeal
process
.
the
operation
of
redeployment
arrangement
also
impact
on
the
final
position
as
a
teacher
can
remain
in
he
or
she
exist
school
where
a
suitable
redeployment
position
do
not
exist
.
the
final
staffing
position
for
all
school
will
therefore
not
be
know
until
the
autumn
.
at
that
stage
the
allocation
process
will
be
fully
complete
for
mainstream
classroom
teacher
and
any
appeal
to
the
Staffing
appeal
Board
will
have
be
consider
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
statement
.
this
be
the
second
time
in
a
short
period
that
the
minister
have
clarify
the
situation
in
respect
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
when
will
the
Teamwork
report
be
publish
?
the
reconfiguration
document
be
publish
on
15
January
and
lay
before
the
regional
health
forum
.
the
document
state
that
the
only
service
rotate
through
Mallow
General
Hospital
would
be
outpatient
and
obstetrics
and
gynaecology
service
and
no
other
service
be
envisage
.
ENT
service
be
now
be
cut
,
which
do
not
tally
with
the
minister
's
statement
.
will
the
minister
further
clarify
what
day
procedure
service
she
envisage
would
rotate
through
Mallow
General
Hospital
in
future
?
there
be
a
number
of
centre
of
excellence
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
also
.
do
the
minister
not
acknowledge
that
a
lack
of
investment
in
a
day
procedure
unit
,
which
have
be
moot
for
the
past
ten
year
,
be
the
reason
that
statistic
be
low
?
if
there
have
be
such
investment
,
Mallow
General
Hospital
would
be
punch
even
further
above
its
weight
than
it
do
at
present
.

I
welcome
this
opportunity
to
speak
on
the
Bill
.
how
do
we
arrive
at
a
stage
in
the
country
's
development
where
thousand
of
people
be
on
local
authority
waiting
list
yet
thousand
of
house
throughout
the
land
be
unoccupied
?
when
do
we
,
economically
and
socially
speak
,
decide
that
a
house
would
become
a
tradeable
commodity
to
be
use
as
a
instrument
for
investment
primarily
and
not
as
a
place
of
refuge
or
to
raise
a
family
?
until
such
time
as
we
legislate
in
this
area
with
people
in
mind
and
give
up
we
obsession
with
the
property
market
we
be
doom
to
repeat
the
same
mistake
.
we
have
,
through
this
legislation
,
a
opportunity
to
provide
decent
housing
for
all
that
who
need
it
,
if
only
we
can
embark
on
a
little
lateral
thinking
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ciarán
Lynch
,
state
that
recent
figure
publish
show
a
massive
jump
from
43700
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
to
nearly
60000
in
just
three
year
.
how
do
we
come
to
this
point
when
so
many
house
be
be
build
during
this
period
?
with
the
right
thinking
,
this
legislation
provide
a
golden
opportunity
to
address
the
imbalance
that
exist
within
the
social
housing
sector
.
the
relationship
between
the
Department
and
the
local
authority
need
to
reflect
the
reality
on
the
ground
.
for
instance
,
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
there
be
a
local
authority
scheme
at
Stag
Park
in
Mitchelstown
where
affordable
house
remain
unsold
and
be
board
up
.
I
have
queue
out
the
door
of
my
clinic
in
Mitchelstown
with
people
on
the
social
housing
list
who
would
dearly
love
to
obtain
one
of
this
modern
,
well
-
appoint
and
fantastically
design
house
.
however
,
they
will
remain
unsold
until
such
time
as
the
Department
free
up
the
financial
obligation
of
the
local
authority
to
the
department
with
regard
to
they
sale
.
the
current
market
condition
dictate
that
they
will
remain
unsold
because
they
have
be
board
up
for
so
long
that
a
certain
stigma
be
attach
to
they
.
the
Department
must
become
more
flexible
in
its
approach
.
a
house
which
be
designate
as
a
affordable
house
and
which
be
unsold
within
a
specific
period
must
be
allow
to
be
occupy
at
the
discretion
of
the
local
authority
if
the
local
authority
have
make
a
decent
attempt
to
sell
the
house
.
the
Minister
of
State
must
examine
this
.
countless
thousand
of
affordable
house
throughout
the
State
could
be
use
for
social
housing
but
this
cannot
be
do
because
of
certain
constraint
place
upon
they
.
generally
,
I
be
in
favour
of
voluntary
housing
association
but
I
have
certain
reservation
about
trend
that
I
have
see
within
this
sector
.
I
be
anxious
that
voluntary
housing
association
would
not
supplant
the
role
of
the
local
authority
in
term
of
the
provision
of
social
housing
.
it
be
true
that
they
fulfil
a
need
in
term
of
catering
to
a
certain
demographic
.
however
,
I
have
document
case
and
have
representation
from
quite
a
number
of
constituent
who
find
that
once
they
occupy
a
voluntary
housing
association
property
,
they
find
they
have
no
recourse
to
eventual
purchase
or
to
a
independent
arbiter
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
they
tenancy
.
in
one
case
I
encounter
,
the
rent
of
a
couple
on
a
fix
social
welfare
income
be
increase
substantially
by
the
voluntary
housing
association
and
they
have
no
recourse
to
a
independent
arbiter
when
they
seek
to
question
the
increase
.
this
issue
must
be
address
.
Irish
people
will
always
want
to
own
they
own
home
.
this
be
ingrain
within
we
psyche
.
this
trait
must
inform
how
we
formulate
policy
.
if
one
provide
a
social
house
it
must
be
on
the
basis
that
it
will
become
available
for
purchase
in
the
medium
to
long
term
.
this
choice
and
right
must
exist
even
if
it
be
not
exercise
.
the
current
tenant
purchase
scheme
be
woefully
inadequate
,
in
that
there
would
be
a
golden
opportunity
to
sell
off
old
housing
stock
if
it
be
discount
at
a
more
favourable
rate
.
most
local
authority
house
I
visit
which
have
long
-
term
tenancy
have
so
much
invest
in
they
by
the
occupier
that
the
valuation
they
get
when
they
seek
to
purchase
the
house
have
no
bear
on
the
original
real
cost
of
construction
and
the
amount
invest
in
the
intervene
period
.
if
one
wish
to
purchase
one
's
home
in
the
current
climate
there
be
a
discount
rate
but
it
have
become
a
instrument
of
the
market
by
virtue
of
a
valuation
which
must
be
seek
.
this
be
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
people
have
build
community
around
they
home
and
have
ensure
the
upkeep
of
the
house
for
the
duration
of
they
tenancy
.
if
we
be
to
incentivise
the
ownership
of
house
we
must
create
good
condition
to
allow
old
people
to
purchase
they
home
.
there
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
State
in
that
it
would
yield
a
massive
dividend
and
would
provide
a
opportunity
in
term
of
significantly
reduce
maintenance
cost
to
local
authority
.
section
16
provide
that
make
a
draft
plan
be
require
.
the
country
be
face
a
pension
nightmare
for
the
future
.
on
several
occasion
,
I
recall
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
remind
we
that
life
expectancy
have
risen
dramatically
since
the
government
come
into
office
.
I
question
she
claim
to
fame
in
this
respect
,
but
if
we
be
live
long
,
then
any
draft
plan
must
be
formulate
on
the
basis
that
housing
provision
for
old
people
in
the
future
be
encapsulate
within
such
plan
.
we
cannot
keep
shove
people
into
nursing
home
,
and
shelter
housing
be
only
part
of
the
solution
.
where
a
draft
plan
be
formulate
on
foot
of
a
county
development
plan
,
land
must
be
zone
specifically
for
housing
for
the
elderly
.
there
must
be
some
degree
of
forward
planning
which
must
start
now
to
deal
with
that
issue
.
if
people
be
currently
reside
in
quite
large
house
,
they
will
want
to
downsize
in
the
future
.
it
be
probable
that
there
will
be
a
demand
for
small
unit
.
County
development
plan
—
by
extension
,
the
draft
housing
plan
—
must
take
account
of
that
kind
of
planning
.
we
cannot
just
plan
for
the
next
two
or
three
year
,
but
for
20
year
hence
.
we
need
a
little
bit
of
foresight
in
that
respect
.
in
my
experience
,
I
have
find
that
planning
policy
unit
lack
the
necessary
resource
to
carry
out
demographic
study
of
population
trend
for
future
housing
provision
.
the
government
must
take
cognisance
of
this
.
the
CSO
could
be
a
viable
instrument
in
assist
local
authority
in
that
respect
.
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
with
which
I
be
most
familiar
be
in
north
Cork
,
and
it
have
be
well
deploy
.
this
be
the
case
because
the
staff
have
use
the
scheme
to
good
effect
,
which
be
a
tribute
to
people
who
be
use
limited
resource
.
how
do
we
get
to
a
stage
where
we
would
use
taxpayer
's
money
—
approximately
€450
million
—
to
pay
a
rental
subsidy
to
a
landlord
with
a
second
or
third
home
,
to
ensure
housing
provision
for
people
on
the
housing
list
?
there
be
a
economic
fallacy
to
that
argument
.
it
defy
any
kind
of
logic
or
common
sense
.
we
need
to
wean
ourselves
off
this
dependence
on
rent
allowance
.
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
rental
accommodation
scheme
if
resource
be
be
allocate
to
provide
house
for
people
in
need
.
if
we
take
approximately
€450
million
per
annum
,
there
be
a
multiplier
from
that
which
would
adequately
provide
capital
spending
for
all
of
the
social
housing
need
.
I
be
not
rail
against
the
scheme
as
it
currently
exist
,
because
it
have
do
well
in
the
circumstance
in
which
it
operate
,
but
there
must
be
more
lateral
thinking
about
how
we
provide
social
housing
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
examine
.
the
over
-
supply
of
housing
in
large
part
of
the
country
in
the
recent
past
must
teach
we
that
the
relationship
between
demand
and
supply
must
be
a
qualitative
one
and
not
base
on
quantity
alone
.
we
must
re-jig
we
thinking
in
this
area
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
antisocial
behaviour
in
this
respect
.
we
have
a
scheme
on
Mallow
Town
Council
whereby
the
council
and
other
source
fund
a
tenant
liaison
officer
.
since
that
officer
's
contract
of
employment
have
to
be
terminate
because
there
be
not
adequate
funding
to
meet
the
need
the
qualitative
relationship
between
the
tenant
and
the
local
authority
have
deteriorate
.
the
work
the
person
in
question
carry
out
on
a
three
year
contract
be
so
valuable
that
the
relationship
between
tenant
and
the
local
authority
improve
dramatically
during
that
period
and
the
incidence
of
antisocial
behaviour
reduce
dramatically
.
one
way
to
deal
with
antisocial
behaviour
be
to
build
relationship
by
ensure
that
a
tenant
liaison
officer
be
appoint
under
statutory
provision
in
every
local
authority
jurisdiction
.
the
relationship
building
process
in
this
instance
be
do
over
time
and
with
a
very
meticulous
approach
and
it
yield
result
.
that
need
to
be
examine
in
this
Bill
.
section
30
state
that
the
housing
authority
can
delegate
some
or
all
of
its
management
and
control
function
in
respect
of
its
dwelling
to
a
designate
body
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
expand
on
that
provision
.
I
have
a
certain
reservation
that
if
we
move
to
code
power
to
the
voluntary
housing
association
,
we
would
code
exclusive
control
of
social
housing
policy
to
non-statutory
body
.
the
minister
should
speak
about
this
in
he
response
.
there
be
land
zone
in
Mallow
that
be
own
by
the
town
council
,
in
which
a
plan
for
more
than
100
house
be
formulate
.
the
entrance
to
that
site
be
currently
no
wide
than
the
width
of
two
car
.
there
be
a
lack
of
join
up
thinking
where
land
own
by
a
council
be
zone
for
local
authority
housing
.
there
must
be
proper
access
to
the
site
.
the
land
adjoin
a
private
estate
and
if
one
consider
the
multiplier
of
100
house
for
car
and
traffic
movement
,
then
without
any
rectification
of
the
access
,
we
be
store
up
difficulty
for
the
future
.
we
cannot
speak
about
antisocial
behaviour
or
about
build
community
unless
we
have
proper
zoning
and
proper
access
to
local
authority
housing
site
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
as
well
.
for
too
long
,
social
housing
have
be
a
poor
relation
in
long
-
term
planning
.
Successive
government
have
build
house
with
the
sole
aim
of
get
people
off
the
list
.
that
in
itself
be
worthwhile
,
but
we
have
never
think
about
the
implication
of
crowd
hundred
of
house
into
one
area
without
any
thought
for
the
implication
of
lack
of
proper
space
,
amenity
space
and
proper
access
to
the
site
.
that
be
why
so
many
problem
exist
.
there
will
be
a
great
opportunity
presently
for
the
government
to
ensure
social
housing
provision
in
a
way
that
provide
for
everyone
in
need
of
housing
.
we
must
have
some
foresight
in
we
thinking
in
that
regard
.
under
the
current
term
of
the
third
level
student
grant
scheme
,
maintenance
grant
be
not
payable
to
candidate
who
already
hold
a
qualification
and
be
pursue
a
second
qualification
at
the
same
level
.
this
restriction
apply
to
every
student
who
already
hold
a
qualification
at
the
same
level
,
irrespective
of
where
that
qualification
be
obtain
or
whether
or
not
funding
be
previously
award
.
the
objective
of
the
student
grant
scheme
be
to
assist
as
many
student
as
possible
in
obtain
one
undergraduate
degree
and
in
progress
,
where
appropriate
,
to
postgraduate
study
.
there
be
no
plan
at
present
to
change
the
current
arrangement
.
any
such
proposal
would
have
to
be
consider
in
the
light
of
exist
resource
and
other
compete
demand
in
the
education
sector
.
the
statement
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
to
the
effect
that
the
government
have
take
care
"
to
ensure
that
the
measure
be
equitable
and
highly
progressive
"
be
incorrect
.
base
on
a
initial
analysis
of
the
figure
,
today
's
budget
will
create
a
large
demographic
sector
of
the
working
poor
.
when
the
income
levy
and
health
levy
be
factor
in
as
well
as
the
fact
that
most
people
work
in
the
private
sector
have
have
to
endure
pay
cut
across
the
board
,
the
real
income
they
will
be
leave
with
will
be
so
marginal
that
it
will
not
enable
they
to
have
a
adequate
standard
of
living
.
we
all
appreciate
that
measure
have
to
be
take
.
however
,
they
should
have
be
take
on
the
basis
that
they
would
not
be
regressive
.
there
be
now
a
large
demographic
cohort
of
ordinary
working
family
who
will
be
devastate
financially
by
the
proposal
within
this
document
.
with
regard
to
income
tax
,
we
be
always
tell
that
the
canon
of
taxation
dictate
it
should
be
progressive
.
I
do
not
see
anything
in
the
budget
that
ensure
high
net
worth
individual
will
pay
a
proportionate
amount
of
they
income
towards
get
we
out
of
the
mess
we
be
in
.
I
do
not
see
why
the
Minister
for
Finance
could
not
have
introduce
a
high
tax
rate
at
this
time
so
as
to
cushion
the
blow
against
middle
and
low
income
earner
.
it
be
completely
regressive
and
when
people
wake
up
to
the
fact
of
what
this
document
contain
,
it
will
make
they
even
more
angry
at
the
government
than
they
already
be
.
that
be
why
I
will
not
support
this
resolution
.
the
information
seek
be
not
readily
available
.
I
have
request
official
of
my
Department
to
compile
the
information
available
and
this
will
be
forward
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
explain
the
process
.
the
building
project
for
the
school
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
currently
at
a
early
stage
of
architectural
planning
.
the
progression
of
all
large
scale
building
project
,
include
this
project
,
from
initial
design
stage
through
to
construction
phase
will
be
consider
in
the
context
of
my
Department
's
multi-annual
School
Building
and
Modernisation
Programme
.
however
,
in
light
of
current
compete
demand
on
the
capital
budget
of
the
Department
,
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
indicative
timeframe
for
the
progression
of
the
project
at
this
time
.
we
be
right
.
be
it
not
a
very
cynical
move
to
introduce
such
a
measure
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
know
it
would
not
affect
people
until
the
winter
?
it
speak
volume
about
how
this
government
treat
old
people
that
it
do
not
have
the
gut
to
try
this
in
December
,
during
normal
budgetary
time
,
because
if
that
who
march
when
the
government
try
to
take
medical
card
from
the
over
-
70
number
thousand
,
they
would
be
out
in
they
hundred
of
thousand
during
December
.
we
now
live
in
a
society
with
a
breakdown
in
the
intergenerational
solidarity
that
always
sustain
the
community
in
this
country
.
that
a
government
would
take
away
a
economic
measure
that
give
comfort
to
old
people
,
at
a
time
when
people
spend
extra
on
they
family
and
themselves
,
be
miserly
and
unbelievable
.
no
Fianna
Fáil
leader
,
such
as
Lemass
or
de
Valera
,
would
have
countenance
such
a
move
during
they
tenure
.
it
be
a
measure
of
how
far
right
this
government
have
move
in
distance
itself
from
the
very
people
who
would
ordinarily
have
support
it
.
the
philosopher
Bertrand
Russell
state
,
"
to
be
happy
in
this
world
,
especially
when
youth
be
past
,
it
be
necessary
to
feel
oneself
not
merely
a
isolated
individual
whose
day
will
soon
be
over
,
but
part
of
the
stream
of
life
flow
on
from
the
first
germ
to
the
remote
and
unknown
future
"
.
this
government
be
increasingly
isolate
we
old
people
,
take
measure
that
be
dump
people
in
nursing
home
who
cannot
get
nursing
home
subvention
,
put
old
people
into
penury
in
respect
of
how
they
pay
for
care
in
they
autumn
and
winter
year
and
now
the
government
be
take
away
a
measure
that
give
some
small
assistance
to
see
they
through
the
winter
month
.
that
who
I
represent
be
not
upper
middle
class
people
live
in
urban
conurbation
.
they
be
live
in
rural
area
,
in
old
housing
stock
,
have
modest
pension
and
must
have
the
fire
lighting
all
day
every
day
to
keep
the
back
boiler
go
to
run
the
radiator
to
ensure
there
be
heat
in
the
house
.
by
reduce
this
payment
,
the
minister
be
tell
we
this
people
can
pay
for
they
heating
cost
but
when
they
go
to
the
community
welfare
officer
to
ask
for
a
supplementary
payment
they
will
not
be
give
it
.
they
would
ordinarily
have
use
the
bonus
to
pay
for
the
extra
bag
of
coal
or
other
such
simple
measure
that
sustain
they
through
the
hard
winter
month
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
think
of
the
intergenerational
solidarity
we
always
have
in
this
country
,
the
social
solidarity
to
which
previous
Fianna
Fáil
government
adhere
,
and
I
ask
she
to
reverse
this
miserly
,
mean
measure
.
to
introduce
it
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
when
it
be
not
so
high
on
the
political
agenda
,
be
a
cynical
move
.
it
be
symptomatic
of
the
cynical
politics
that
inhabit
this
country
.
I
represent
a
rural
constituency
where
many
people
live
in
isolated
area
and
this
scheme
allow
they
to
have
the
peace
of
mind
and
feeling
of
security
bring
about
by
have
a
monitor
alarm
system
.
they
relative
be
also
reassure
by
the
scheme
.
I
do
not
understand
,
therefore
,
why
the
scheme
be
be
suspend
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
be
true
to
he
word
when
he
say
it
will
be
reinstate
in
September
.
this
signify
a
further
erosion
of
service
,
particularly
for
old
people
.
tonight
we
debate
the
loss
of
the
Christmas
bonus
for
pensioner
and
we
all
remember
the
fiasco
of
the
medical
card
for
the
over
70
.
now
many
old
people
who
live
independently
in
isolated
area
no
long
feel
safe
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
this
scheme
.
it
also

a
certain
degree
of
comfort

people
who
might
embark
on

the
reduction
in

help
hour
mean
there
be
few
caller
to

so
the
lack
of

will
have
a
effect

of
Cork

a

in
particular
,
in
seek
to
interpret
the
legislation
.
the
basis
on
which
we
would
support
the
legislation
be
the
morass
that
exist
in
Irish
society
today
.
this
be
exemplify
by
the
spate
of
ruthless
killing
we
have
borne
witness
to
over
a
number
of
year
.
the
question
outside
this
wall
be
whether
the
tipping
point
have
be
reach
—
and
whether
this
legislative
proposal
will
facilitate
that
tipping
point
to
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
,
again
,
on
we
street
.
we
be
previously
tell
that
the
murder
of
Veronica
Guerin
be
the
turning
point
in
the
context
of
gangland
killing
.
that
point
come
and
go
and
now
we
be
be
tell
that
the
murder
of
Shane
Geoghegan
in
Limerick
be
the
turning
point
.
I
hope
it
be
,
and
I
continue
to
hope
that
this
legislation
,
while
it
will
not
be
a
panacea
,
will
facilitate
a
process
that
will
allow
the
Garda
Síochána
to
have
the
necessary
tool
to
allow
it
to
carry
out
its
work
in
this
regard
.
as
deputy
Rabbitte
have
say
recently
,
in
outline
the
Labour
Party
position
on
this
,
the
fundamental
question
be
whether
the
response
by
way
of
legislation
be
reasonable
,
legitimate
and
proportionate
.
I
believe
that
it
be
and
that
the
Garda
must
be
give
power
to
respond
in
a
manner
that
facilitate
a
preventative
mechanism
.
the
power
within
this
legislation
,
on
first
reading
,
would
deem
that
to
be
the
case
.
I
be
encourage
,
also
,
by
the
statement
on
17
April
by
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
,
which
give
a
cautious
welcome
to
the
Bill
.
its
statement
say
that
intelligence
-
lead
policing
and
not
the
restriction
of
fair
trial
rights
be
the
most
effective
way
to
tackle
gangland
crime
.
I
refer
specifically
to
Mr.
Mark
Kelly
,
the
ICCL
's
director
who
state
that
the
Bill
would
at
last
place
Garda
surveillance
on
a
lawful
basis
that
broadly
conform
to
article
8
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
he
go
on
to
say
that
the
need
for
judicial
authorisation
of
most
form
of
surveillance
be
welcome
.
however
,
it
remain
unclear
why
it
be
feel
unacceptable
to
allow
tracking
device
to
be
place
on
people
's
vehicle
on
Garda
authority
alone
.
while
the
ICCL
have
reservation
,
I
be
sure
many
of
they
can
be
work
through
on
the
late
Stage
of
the
Bill
.
Mr.
Kelly
say
that
in
the
interest
of
protection
of
privacy
,
the
ICCL
be
urge
the
minister
to
publicly
disclose
before
the
Bill
become
law
the
propose
content
of
the
regulation
foreseen
in
section
8
(
2
)
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
will
be
a
human
rights
framework
for
the
use
by
gardaí
of
tracking
device
.
I
understand
that
deputy
Rabbitte
state
early
that
this
would
also
be
tease
out
on
late
Stage
.
however
,
I
welcome
the
ICCL
's
support
while
appreciate
its
concern
in
relation
to
article
8
under
the
European
Convention
of
human
Right
2003
,
and
the
recognition
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
be
maintain
,
or
not
compromise
in
any
way
.
I
hope
that
put
into
effect
a
explicit
statutory
provision
in
relation
to
surveillance
will
assuage
any
fear
regard
the
rights
of
a
individual
and
the
need
to
reduce
crime
.
I
believe
that
iccl
support
for
this
,
while
qualified
,
be
significant
.
my
interpretation
of
this
support
be
that
there
be
no
danger
such
a
act
would
contravene
article
40.3
of
the
constitution
in
term
of
the
personal
rights
of
the
citizen
.
such
article
40.3
rights
be
germane
to
the
tipping
point
or
the
turning
point
I
speak
of
early
.
what
Shane
Geoghegan
's
murder
teach
we
be
that
at
some
crucial
point
the
personal
rights
of
a
citizen
must
not
be
unqualified
.
that
be
to
say
,
they
be
not
absolute
.
if
we
be
to
pursue
he
killer
and
that
of
other
,
then
the
constitutional
rights
of
some
must
be
subservient
to
the
common
good
,
and
as
the
late
Mr.
Justice
Hamilton
previously
state
,
subject
to
the
requirement
of
public
order
and
morality
.
I
believe
that
be
what
this
legislation
be
about
.
it
be
about
ensure
that
we
can
reach
a
stage
where
a
person
's
personal
rights
be
vindicate
but
that
the
common
good
and
the
desire
for
the
rule
of
law
be
maintain
or
restore
within
this
country
.
we
need
to
get
to
a
point
where
we
can
have
some
confidence
that
the
power
the
Garda
have
will
be
use
to
such
a
extent
.
if
I
be
never
involved
in
the
legislative
process
,
I
would
still
take
the
view
that
it
be
necessary
for
the
Garda
to
have
such
power
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
its
function
.
that
this
Bill
will
provide
a
statutory
framework
for
carry
out
such
surveillance
by
gardaí
and
other
be
the
right
approach
at
this
time
.
in
fact
,
it
be
overdue
and
if
the
gardaí
be
not
give
such
power
,
then
the
morass
that
this
society
find
itself
in
,
which
incorporate
the
slaughter
of
innocent
,
will
continue
and
go
unpunished
in
some
case
.
in
address
the
specific
provision
of
the
Bill
,
there
be
a
number
of
question
to
which
I
seek
answer
.
section
5
provide
that
"
a
authorisation
may
be
madeex
parte
and
shall
be
hear
otherwise
than
in
public
''
.
I
hope
that
the
power
to
seek
authorisation
for
surveillance
in
such
circumstance
be
balance
against
the
power
of
the
judge
to
grant
a
specific
authorisation
.
if
I
interpret
that
provision
correctly
,
there
be
no
onus
on
the
superior
officer
to
state
a
particular
offence
and
I
hope
that
this
power
will
be
use
wisely
.
however
,
I
be
satisfied
the
specification
in
regard
to
the
authorisation
leave
no
grounds
for
a
potential
abuse
of
power
.
section
5
outline
that
where
a
authorisation
be
seek
,
there
be
specifics
in
regard
to
the
particular
of
the
surveillance
device
authorise
to
be
use
,
the
person
who
or
the
place
or
thing
to
be
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
,
the
name
of
the
superior
officer
to
whom
it
be
issue
,
the
condition
subject
to
which
the
authorisation
be
issue
and
the
date
of
expiry
.
it
be
necessary
that
there
be
specific
provision
within
that
authorisation
which
will
ensure
there
be
no
vagueness
about
the
authorisation
and
,
therefore
,
it
will
not
be
potentially
open
to
abuse
.
I
welcome
that
provision
in
regard
to
the
authorisation
and
I
hope
it
will
be
stringently
adhere
to
when
implement
.
in
regard
to
section
5
and
6
,
where
a
authorisation
be
seek
,
it
may
authorise
the
superior
officer
name
in
it
or
any
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
,
member
of
the
Defence
Force
or
officer
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
designate
by
that
superior
officer
.
there
be
a
provision
where
a
superior
officer
may
seek
the
authorisation
but
that
any
other
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
can
also
be
subject
to
that
authorisation
.
if
another
garda
who
be
not
a
superior
officer
be
subject
to
that
provision
,
be
he
or
she
name
in
it
?
if
we
be
to
grant
new
power
of
surveillance
,
will
there
be
specific
training
or
will
resource
be
allocate
to
train
junior
officer
under
the
legislation
?
if
the
legislation
be
to
work
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
that
every
officer
,
whether
in
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
the
Garda
Síochána
or
the
Defence
Force
,
be
give
specific
training
which
will
ensure
there
be
no
scope
to
challenge
the
provision
of
the
legislation
thereafter
where
criminal
proceedings
be
bring
.
will
the
minister
address
that
in
he
reply
?
I
refer
to
section
8
.
what
do
the
minister
interpret
as
a
"
tracking
device
"
?
I
have
watch
many
cop
show
and
we
all
know
what
a
tracking
device
be
.
in
practical
term
,
how
will
this
play
out
?
I
know
it
provide
for
specific
vehicle
to
be
track
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
take
on
that
section
when
he
respond
to
the
debate
.
I
refer
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
the
power
vested
in
section
11
.
there
be
a
complaint
procedure
in
the
legislation
which
state
specifically
that
recommendation
can
be
make
and
that
a
matter
can
be
report
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
.
what
be
the
power
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
in
regard
to
the
legislation
?
there
be
a
reporting
procedure
but
be
there
a
power
of
intervention
or
recommendation
which
must
be
act
upon
where
a
complaint
be
make
?
I
understand
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
power
of
a
circuit
Court
judge
and
the
complaint
referee
.
that
be
very
clear
.
however
,
the
power
in
regard
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
be
unclear
to
I
and
I
would
like
a
more
specific
interpretation
of
that
.
I
hope
from
a
societal
point
of
view
,
that
we
have
reach
a
tipping
point
where
we
can
now
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
on
we
street
and
that
once
this
legislation
be
enact
,
there
will
be
a
pressure
on
people
who
have
act
with
impunity
which
will
stymie
they
activity
and
put
they
out
of
business
for
a
long
time
to
come
.
it
be
necessary
to
enact
this
legislation
and
in
that
sense
,
I
welcome
it
.
it
will
not
provide
a
panacea
for
all
we
ill
but
it
will
provide
the
start
of
a
real
process
which
will
restore
some
semblance
of
peace
.
the
animal
health
problem
on
the
farm
refer
to
by
deputy
White
have
be
ongoing
for
several
year
and
relate
mainly
to
ill
-
thrift
and
stunt
growth
of
cattle
on
the
farm

to
reduce

yield
.
I
thank

of
Mr.
Dan
Brennan

apart
from
this
report
my
Department
and
other
have
also
be
involved
in
several
initiative
on
this
farm
.
for
example
,
a
herd
health
programme
be
develop
by
the
farmer
's
private
veterinary
practitioner
and
support
by
my
Department
,
to

other
initiative
include

management
plan
,
monitor

and
check
source
of
water
to
the
farm
.
follow
finalisation
of
the
Department
's
veterinary
laboratory
service
report
in
2006
,
the
then
minister
meet
a
delegation
of
interest
,
include
the
farmer
,
in
July
2006
and
confirm
that
the
authority
be
more
than
willing
to
pursue
the
investigation
further
and
to
seek
to
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem
on
the
farm
.
the
minister
also
meet
with
the
director
of
the
EPA
to
discuss
a
report
it
have
produce
on
the
environmental
impact
of
emission
.
arise
from
this
process
,
in
2006
the
then
minister
ask
the
centre
for
veterinary
epidemiology
and
risk
analysis
to
conduct
a
further
thorough
and
comprehensive
study
.
the
centre
for
veterinary
epidemiology
and
risk
analysis
study
be
design
to
complement
the
work
to
date
and
use
some
different
approach
to
investigate
the
production
problem
on
the
farm
.
the
study
entail
a
major
sampling
and
testing
programme
,
include
investigation
of
various
metabolic
pathway
,
as
well
as
epidemiological
study
.
in
addition
,
a
comprehensive
and
detailed
soil
survey
be
include
in
the
remit
of
the
study
.
a
draft
report
arise
from
this
work
have
now
be
send
for
peer
review
and
when
this
be
complete
the
report
will
be
finalise
and
publish
.
the
article
in
the
Kilkenny
People
refer
to
a
report
.
however
,
I
be
not
aware
to
which
document
the
newspaper
refer
and
I
trust
the
deputy
would
agree
,
therefore
,
that
it
be
inappropriate
for
I
to
comment
in
detail
upon
it
.
I
emphasise
that
my
Department
and
I
,
along
with
the
other
agency
involve
,
be
determined
to
establish
the
underlying
cause
of
the
problem
on
this
farm
.
it
be
inappropriate
at
this
stage
to
make
any
further
comment
on
the
centre
for
veterinary
epidemiology
and
risk
analysis
investigation
until
the
report
be
finalise
and
publish
,
which
will
take
place
shortly
.
we
broadly
welcome
the
legislation
,
which
be
long
overdue
,
and
wonder
why
the
draft
Bill
from
2007
have
not
be
introduce
before
now
.
however
,
it
be
now
before
we
.
it
be
ludicrous
that
a
significant
number
of
people
be
incarcerate
on
the
basis
that
they
be
unable
to
pay
fine
.
it
be
expeditious
and
proper
that
the
State
put
in
place
a
system
to
allow
people
to
pay
they
fine
by
instalment
or
other
means
,
thus
negate
the
need
to
go
to
prison
.
the
case
be
already
make
by
my
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
that
the
problem
that
persist
in
prison
as
a
result
of
overcrowding
be
in
no
small
way
attributable
to
the
fact
that
people
be
in
prison
due
to
non-payment
of
fine
.
this
be
lead
to
a
undue
burden
on
the
State
and
must
be
rectify
.
there
be
a
previous
judgment
in
this
regard
.
I
believe
it
be
Mr.
Justice
Henchy
who
state
that
in
no
circumstance
should
a
court
impose
imprisonment
as
a
alternative
to
a
fine
solely
on
the
grounds
that
the
defendant
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
fine
consider
by
the
court
to
be
appropriate
.
imprisonment
be
the
most
serious
punishment
,
and
if
it
be
not
appropriate
because
the
case
be
not
sufficiently
serious
,
a
fine
should
be
impose
as
a
less
penalty
.
if
the
defendant
cannot
afford
a
appropriate
fine
,
the
amount
should
be
lower
,
and
if
he
or
she
cannot
afford
any
fine
,
imprisonment
should
not
be
consider
as
a
alternative
solely
on
the
grounds
that
the
fine
cannot
be
pay
.
this
be
a
important
point
.
accord
to
that
judgment
,
it
be
good
for
someone
to
walk
free
without
punishment
rather
than
be
punish
by
imprisonment
just
because
he
or
she
have
no
money
to
pay
a
fine
.
otherwise
we
be
imprison
people
on
grounds
of
poverty
rather
than
accord
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offence
they
commit
.
this
legislation
will
facilitate
a
process
whereby
that
people
who
be
unable
to
pay
they
fine
in
one
fall
swoop
will
be
able
to
pay
by
instalment
.
this
result
in
great
equity
in
that
somebody
who
be
convict
of
a
crime
but
be
not
a
criminal
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
word
now
have
a
opportunity
to
pay
the
fine
in
small
instalment
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
do
not
understand
why
,
when
the
Law
Reform
Commission
introduce
recommendation
—
which
in
this
instance
date
back
to
1991
—
the
legislature
do
not
come
forward
with
proposal
in
a
more
timely
fashion
to
rectify
matter
or
make
the
law
good
.
this
Bill
be
first
publish
in
2007
and
the
Law
Reform
Commission
have
be
speak
on
this
issue
since
1991
.
any
function
democracy
should
have
within
its
remit
the
ability
to
enact
law
in
a
timely
fashion
.
if
one
consider
the
cost
factor
alone
,
base
on
the
number
of
people
who
have
serve
prison
sentence
for
non-payment
of
fine
,
we
could
have
save
the
State
countless
thousand
of
euro
if
good
legislation
have
be
introduce
early
.
the
Law
Reform
Commission
,
from
any
document
I
have
see
,
have
be
far
-
reach
in
its
approach
to
this
issue
.
this
be
a
matter
that
need
to
be
address
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
fair
that
the
limit
above
which
instalment
can
be
pay
be
€
100
.
this
limit
should
be
remove
so
that
fine
of
less
than
€
100
can
be
also
pay
in
instalment
.
there
be
many
people
out
there
who
survive
on
subsistence
wage
or
rely
solely
on
income
from
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
,
and
to
whom
literally
every
penny
count
.
to
that
people
a
fine
of
as
little
as
€
50
would
be
a
considerable
burden
.
provision
should
be
make
in
the
Bill
so
that
a
fine
of
less
than
€
100
can
be
pay
by
instalment
.
daily
,
I
deal
with
people
who
find
themselves
in
difficulty
over
the
non-payment
of
refuse
charge
,
for
example
.
local
authority
have
system
whereby
€
5
per
week
could
be
pay
.
in
many
such
instance
,
the
outstanding
debt
could
be
as
little
as
€
70
or
€
80
.
the
same
type
of
principle
should
apply
to
this
provision
,
a
matter
I
hope
can
be
address
.
the
legislation
's
net
effect
should
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
impecunious
offender
be
sentence
to
imprisonment
.
there
should
be
careful
monitoring
of
sentencing
practice
across
the
board
to
ensure
the
objective
be
achieve
.
for
this
reason
,
the
Bill
should
provide
for
some
form
of
statistical
analysis
whereby
its
net
effect
can
be
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
measure
in
order
that
we
can
see
the
knock
-
on
effect
in
term
of
any
reduction
in
the
number
of
people
present
to
prison
and
the
success
or
otherwise
of
the
legislation
as
enact
.
if
the
legislation
be
update
in
future
,
it
be
important
that
there
be
a
statistical
analysis
.
in
this
context
,
the
Court
Service
would
be
a
important
actor
.
I
refer
to
the
Bills
Digest
.
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
issue
a
good
document
from
which
it
be
worth
quote
.
it
state
:
a
problem
inherent
in
a
system
of
penalty
base
on
fine
be
the
change
value
of
money
over
time
.
this
can
deprive
a
fine
of
its
punitive
nature
and
reduce
its
deterrent
effect
.
in
term
of
indexation
,
the
schedule
be
clearly
set
out
in
section
2
,
but
we
will
submit
some
amendment
that
will
be
of
a
semantic
nature
as
oppose
to
a
substantive
one
.
a
good
job
have
be
do
in
the
legislation
's
draft
in
term
of
the
change
monetary
effect
that
will
persist
in
future
.
this
be
welcome
.
the
issue
of
a
statement
of
means
should
be
address
.
if
someone
present
himself
or
herself
before
the
court
and
claim
a
inability
to
pay
a
fine
despite
possess
sound
financial
means
,
by
what
mechanism
can
the
judge
determine
whether
the
person
have
the
ability
to
pay
?
while
there
be
provision
in
the
legislation
,
should
it
be
more
prescriptive
?
as
mention
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
section
13
create
a
offence
of
knowingly
or
recklessly
make
a
statement
"
that
be
false
or
misleading
in
any
material
respect
to
a
court
conduct
a
inquiry
into
a
person
's
financial
circumstance
"
.
should
the
section
be
more
prescriptive
in
seek
a
statement
of
means
by
the
convict
person
to
prevent
that
with
means
from
claim
otherwise
?
as
there
be
scope
for
someone
to
misrepresent
he
or
she
position
to
the
court
,
it
might
be
desirable
that
a
statement
of
means
be
swear
by
the
offender
who
be
seek
a
abatement
of
the
fine
by
reason
of
he
or
she
circumstance
.
two
issue
be
not
provide
for
in
the
Bill
,
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
might
respond
.
under
the
Bill
,
could
judge
be
train
to
analyse
the
type
of
scenario
that
appear
before
they
and
to
work
with
the
Court
service
to
ensure
efficiency
be
build
into
the
system
?
there
seem
to
be
no
specific
provision
regard
revenue
offence
.
be
there
such
a
provision
?
I
do
not
wish
to
repeat
the
point
make
by
my
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
,
although
I
could
.
I
would
like
to
see
specific
issue
address
.
the
Labour
Party
be
broadly
in
favour
of
the
Bill
and
strongly
believe
that
it
be
high
time
to
reduce
the
number
present
to
prison
for
,
in
many
instance
,
be
unable
to
pay
fine
.
it
be
proper
that
legislation
be
introduce
to
prevent
such
occurrence
.
the
government
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
many
people
find
it
difficult
to
pay
fine
of
less
than
even
€
100
.
we
also
believe
that
,
since
some
people
might
try
to
misrepresent
they
true
financial
position
before
judge
,
the
Bill
should
have
a
prescriptive
provision
vis
-à
-
vis
the
presentation
of
a
statement
of
means
.
judge
should
be
train
on
the
Bill
's
mechanism
and
its
effect
should
be
monitor
by
the
Court
service
to
ensure
its
intend
impact
because
only
by
means
of
a
statistical
analysis
can
we
measure
the
Bill
's
true
impact
.
