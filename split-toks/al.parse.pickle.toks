amendment
no.

can
be
address
in
the
context
of
the
guidance
documentation
provide
with
the
Bill
.
on
the
other
point
regard
the
august
body
of
employment
legislation
and
the
system
of
joint
labour
committee
and
register
employment
agreement
,
it
be
a
surreal
experience
to
hear
a
Fianna
Fáil
Party
Senator
—
—
—
—
whose
former
leader
,
the
great
Seán
Lemass
,
be
the
architect
of
some
of
the
joint
labour
committee
and
register
employment
agreement
.
Senator
will
forgive
I
if
I
sound
a
little
confused
.
we
should
not
dismantle
or
raze
to
the
ground
the
employment
protection
in
place
for
worker
on
the
basis
of
the
current
economic
climate
.
we
must
strike
a
balance
,
which
be
what
we
seek
to
do
in
the
legislation
.
to
be
fair
,
the
government
be
do
its
good
to
create
employment
and
the
condition
for
employment
.
while
I
note
the
point
make
by
Senator
,
I
respectfully
suggest
they
should
be
make
on
the
basis
of
the
amendment
under
discussion
.
if
someone
start
speak
about
dismantle
the
joint
labour
committee
architecture
,
that
be
another
issue
.
for
the
purpose
of
the
discussion
of
this
amendment
—

on
amendment
no.

,
the
guidance
document
could
clarify
the
matter
raise
by
Senator
Walsh

with

respect

have
make
know
my
view
.
that
be
one
of
the
most
patronising
comment
I
have
hear
in
a
long
time
.
I
be
a
Labour
Party
minister
of
State
who
share
my
department
with
a
senior

the
Fine

I
thank
Senator
Ó
Domhnaill
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
the
Senator
refer
to
a
announcement
last
December
that
the
means
test
for
student
grant
will
be
amend
to
take
account
of
the
value
of
certain
capital
asset
as
well
as
income
for
the
2013
-
14
academic
year
.
a
considerable
body
of
report
over
a
number
of
year
have
strongly
recommend
the
introduction
of
a
capital
test
for
student
grant
,
particularly
on
the
grounds
of
equity
and
fairness
.
the
introduction
of
such
a
test
would
create
a
more
equitable
basis
for
means
testing
through
a
more
complete
analysis
of
a
family
's
capacity
to
support
they
child
in
pursue
further
or
high
education
.
the
Senator
will
appreciate
that
in
the
context
of
the
current
financial
climate
,
the
importance
of
accurately
target
increasingly
scarce
resource
to
that
who
need
they
most
have
become
a
high
priority
.
give
the
increase
cost
of
provide
student
maintenance
grant
,
the
potential
for
this
proposal
to
deliver
cost
savings
on
the
student
grant
budget
be
also
a
critical
consideration
at
this
time
.
while
the
introduction
of
a
capital
asset
test
for
student
grant
may
traditionally
have
be
perceive
as
be
likely
to
affect
the
farming
community
in
particular
,
this
be
not
the
object
of
the
proposal
.
I
emphasise
that
the
proposal
be
not
design
to
target
any
one
group
.
the
Senator
be
aware
that
a
dedicated
capital
asset
test
implementation
group
have
be
establish
,
as
he
refer
to
this
in
he
speech
.
the
group
have
be
charge
with
introduce
detailed
implementation
proposal
on
new
means
testing
arrangement
for
student
grant
,
to
include
the
value
of
asset
,
for
new
applicant
from
the
2013
-
14
academic
year
.
the
group
have
meet
on
three
occasion
and
its
deliberation
be
ongoing
.
I
expect
the
group
to
report
to
the
minister
by
the
summer
and
to
make
recommendation
on
the
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
various
class
of
asset
.
any
proposal
will
require
further
government
agreement
and
necessitate
legislative
amendment
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
the
point
make
.
I
respectfully
suggest
to
he
that
not
all
farm
income
be
necessarily
a
matter
of
public
record
.
we
would
both
agree
on
that
.
however
,
I
understand
the
Senator
's
point
about
double
-
count
farm
income
.
that
be
clearly
set
out
in
the
application
form
.
the
minister
will
be
receive
a
report
on
this
,
and
I
will
certainly
convey
to
he
the
concern
outline
by
the
Senator
.
he
need
have
no
doubt
about
that

I
be
delighted
to
be
here
to
speak
about
this
important
year
for
Irish
science
and
,
most
particularly
,
the
Euroscience
Open
Forum
,
ESOF
,
2012
,
which
be
be
hold
in
we
capital
city
this
summer
.
the
programme
for
Dublin
City
of
Science
2012
have
be
up
and
run
since
its
launch
on
26
January
.
this
be
very
much
a
historic
year
for
science
in
Ireland
.
we
have
already
see
the
science
theme
to
the
fore
during
the
St.
Patrick
's
Festival
in
Dublin
.
the
centrepiece
of
the
year
will
be
the
large
science
meeting
in
Europe
,
the
ESOF
,
which
we
will
be
privileged
to
host
from
11
to
15
July
in
the
new
convention
centre
in
Dublin
.
preparation
for
the
prestigious
ESOF
be
at
a
very
advanced
stage
as
we
seek
to
showcase
Ireland
and
we
scientific
prowess
to
the
very
good
of
we
ability
.
as
London
be
prepare
to
host
the
summer
Olympic
Game
shortly
,
Dublin
be
essentially
host
the
European
scientific
equivalent
.
ESOF
2012
will
place
Dublin
and
Ireland
at
the
centre
of
world
science
for
a
period
next
month
,
with
last
positive
consequence
for
Ireland
's
scientific
reputation
.
it
will
connect
with
the
people
of
Dublin
and
the
rest
of
Ireland
via
the
Science
in
the
City
event
,
in
addition
to
the
many
initiative
run
country
-
wide
as
part
of
the
public
engagement
programme
.
the
ESOF
be
a
biennial
,
pan-European
meeting
,
dedicate
wholly
to
scientific
research
and
innovation
.
it
be
the
large
and
most
prestigious
general
science
meeting
in
Europe
and
it
be
hold
in
a
European
city
every
two
year
.
it
be
first
hold
in
Stockholm
in
2004
,
follow
by
Munich
in
2006
,
Barcelona
in
2008
and
Turin
in
2010
.
the
esof
can
be
describe
as
a
multidisciplinary
,
general
science
meeting
and
it
aim
to
showcase
the
late
advance
in
science
and
technology
and
promote
dialogue
on
they
role
in
society
and
public
policy
.
it
aim
to
stimulate
and
provoke
public
interest
,
excitement
and
debate
about
this
subject
.
the
ESOF
conference
be
unique
in
that
it
be
both
international
and
multidisciplinary
.
it
present
breakthrough
in
many
discipline
as
vary
as
mathematics
,
music
,
geography
and
genetics
through
a
range
of
format
,
include
lecture
,
workshop
and
lunch
.
moreover
,
the
ESOF
present
and
discuss
the
frontier
of
scientific
and
technological
research
in
Europe
,
contribute
to
the
development
of
a
tangible
European
scientific
identity
.
it
also
bridge
the
gap
between
science
and
society
and
stimulate
policy
to
support
scientific
research
.
the
ESOF
be
the
brainchild
of
the
Euroscience
organisation
which
be
found
in
1997
by
member
of
Europe
's
research
community
to
provide
a
open
forum
for
debate
on
science
and
technology
and
research
policy
in
Europe
,
strengthen
the
link
between
science
and
society
and
contribute
to
the
creation
of
a
integrate
space
for
science
and
technology
in
Europe
.
it
also
aim
to
link
research
organisation
and
policy
at
national
and
EU
level
,
strive
for
a
great
role
for
the
European
Union
in
research
and
influence
science
and
technology
policy
.
when
it
be
first
propose
in
2007
that
Ireland
should
compete
to
bring
the
ESOF
to
Dublin
,
the
motivation
be
very
much
to
highlight
,
on
the
international
stage
,
the
benefit
and
fruit
of
Ireland
's
decade
-
long
programme
of
significant
investment
in
science
and
research
.
beginning
in
the
late
1990
,
Ireland
begin
to
invest
considerable
resource
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
as
a
means
of
pursue
economic
development
.
in
the
ensue
decade
public
investment
in
research
through
the
High
Education
Authority
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
the
other
research
-
funding
agency
increase
by
approximately
14
%
per
year
,
which
be
twice
the
rate
of
growth
in
gdp
at
the
time
.
in
total
,
some
3200
new
scientific
post
have
be
add
to
we
third
level
institution
.
in
the
past
five
year
publication
rate
have
almost
double
and
the
rate
of
citation
of
Irish
science
output
,
the
standard
measure
of
quality
,
be
now
above
US
and
European
Union
average
level
.
moreover
,
business
research
and
development
investment
have
increase
in
parallel
.
figure
from
IDA
Ireland
indicate
that
,
last
year
alone
,
nearly
half
of
foreign
direct
investment
be
in
research
and
development
project
,
which
be
most
encouraging
and
promising
.
we
research
and
science
infrastructure
,
in
term
of
the
physical
capital
and
the
equipment
in
we
laboratory
,
in
addition
to
the
intellectual
capital
in
we
scientist
,
be
a
key
legacy
from
the
boom
year
.
this
investment
have
create
real
and
endure
value
and
will
now
play
a
central
role
in
we
economic
recovery
.
with
this
in
mind
,
a
coalition
of
public
and
private
group
,
include
the
government
,
third
level
institution
and
industry
,
work
together
for
six
month
,
begin
in
2007
,
to
prepare
a
bid
to
bring
the
large
-
scale
esof
event
to
Dublin
for
2012
.
this
bid
be
subsequently
submit
to
Euroscience
and
the
good
news
that
Dublin
be
successful
in
the
face
of
stiff
competition
from
the
compete
city
of
Vienna
be
receive
in
Strasbourg
in
autumn
2008
.
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
chief
scientific
adviser
to
the
government
,
Professor
Patrick
Cunningham
,
and
he
diligent
team
by
reason
of
they
important
work
in
the

.
the
main
ESOF
programme
will
be
hold
in
the

in
Dublin
and
it
be
hope
will
attract

the
science

-
business
programme
promise
to
be
a
excellent
one
and
the
14
workshop
over
the
course
of
four
day
will
be
extremely
informative
and
valuable

and
outcome
.
the
programme
will
enable
and
facilitate
delegate
of
all
background
to
obtain
knowledge
and
advice
,
as
well
as
to
make
valuable
contact
,
relevant
to
whatever
stage
of
the
journey
from
scientific
discovery
to
business
formation
they
currently
be
on
.
the
marketplace
exhibition
be
another
exciting
element
of
the
science
-
2
-
business
programme
and
it
will
provide
a
meeting
point
for
the
different
element
of
the
business
start
-
up
ecosystem
,
such
as
venture
capital
and
a

this
marketplace
will

biomedical
and
engineering
sector
.
I
consider
this
to
be
a
key
element
of
the
programme
because
ultimately
,
we
great
economic
challenge
be
to
create
job
and
ensure
we
have
people
who
be
adequately
skilled
to
take
up
that
job
.
the
benefit
to
Ireland

ESOF
be
numerous
.
there
will
be
a
immediate
economic
impact
from
the
approximately

Fáilte
Ireland
estimate
that
each
delegate
at
a
business
conference
contribute
approximately
€
1500
to
the
economy
.
at
a
strategic
level
,
the
event
will
provide
a
platform
to
showcase
the
good
of
Irish
science
and
research
across
all
discipline
and
reinforce
the
international
image
of
Ireland
as
a
lead
centre
of
scientific
and
research
excellence
.
domestically
,
it

Dublin
get
ready
to
assume
the
centre
stage
of
European
science
and

I
thank
Senator
for
they
good
wish
.
there
be
always
a
great
welcome
in
the
Seanad
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
patronising
,
but
there
be
a
eclectic
knowledge
in
the
House
,
give
its
economist
,
musician
,
food
technologist
and
educator
.
the
debate
be
more
lateral
and
sometimes
more
interesting
.
we
have
all
buy
into
the
concept
of
ESOF
and
everyone
acknowledge
the
positive
role
it
can
play
.
give
we
aim
for
research
and
innovation
,
we
need
to
be
able
to
measure
impact
more
accurately
.
the
prioritisation
action
group
follow
on
from
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
be
instigate
by
Mr.
Jim
O'Hara
.
it
be
conclude
that
the
State
would
focus
its
research
on
14
key
area
to
create
the
requisite
economic
impact
without
take
we
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
fund
basic
science
education
.
through
the
action
group
,
we
be
in
the
process
of
bring
all
of
the
funder
of
research
in
this
country
to
the
table
so
that
we
can
measure
the
impact
of
science
,
investment
and
output
.
we
will
move
the
conversation
towards
bring
science
close
to
industry
so
that
we
university
and
institute
of
technology
will
be
able
to
create
the
type
of
Irish
company
we
desire
.
this
path
have
evolve
from
the
situation
to
which
Senator
Power
allude
and
that
obtain
under
previous
government
.
Initial
investment
to
build
capacity
come
through
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
.
we
be
move
into
a
phase
of
measure
impact
more
accurately
.
this
be
a
major
challenge
.
there
have
be
a
significant
realisation
of
the
fact
that
the
scientific
community
have
the
wherewithal
,
human
capital
and
skill
set
to
be
able
to
deliver
for
Ireland
a
tranche
of
new
type
of
company
.
we
have
not
even
begin
to
scratch
the
surface
of
what
be
possible
.
it
be
a
question
of
mining
people
's
creativity
,
but
I
do
not
know
whether
one
can
measure
the
bound
of
that
.
there
be
boundless
opportunity
.
the
government
's
job
be
to
ensure
we
be
either
on
the
money
or
ahead
of
the
curve
in
term
of
realise
that
opportunity
.
Senator
O'Keeffe
mention
creativity
.
I
meet
the
Craft
Council
of
Ireland
last
month
.
consider
its
creativity
and
product
.
if
that
creativity
could
be
marry
with
what
be
be
produce
in
the
Tyndall
National
Institute
,
we
institute
of
technology
and
so
on
,
one
could
create
the
type
of
company
we
need
.
it
be
significant
that
today
Mr.
James
Whelton
,
a
co-founder
of
CoderDojo
,
be
in
New
York
at
the
founder
's
conference
.
along
with
Mr.
Bill
Liao
he
be
roll
out
programming
course
to
child
outside
of
school
setting
on
Saturday
morning
in
centre
throughout
the
country
.
that
be
the
type
of
platform
we
be
create
but
there
be
a
inventory
that
have
yet
to
be
measure
with
the
disparate
initiative
happen
around
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
,
or
stem
.
Senator
O'Keeffe
have
bring
a
new
initiative
to
my
attention
and
I
hope
I
will
be
able
to
assist
she
and
lend
a
hand
if
I
can
as
a
minister
of
State
.
we
must
create
the
inventory
of
what
exactly
be
go
on
with
regard
to
stem
subject
so
we
can
bring
it
together
and
co-ordinate
that
effort
.
CoderDojo
be
one
example
but
it
only
happen
in
certain
geographical
area
.
we
should
see
how
we
can
replicate
that
across
the
system
,
which
be
require
.
what
be
happen
be
inherently
positive
but
it
be
quite
disparate
.
my
role
as
a
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
be
to
try
to
map
what
we
be
do
and
replicate
it
across
the
system
.
I
do
not
want
the
government
to
take
control
and
become
hierarchical
,
as
much
of
it
be
a
organic
process
of
creativity
.
it
will
,
by
itself
,
create
the
type
of
job
and
enterprise
we
so
badly
need
.
create
the
inventory
be
important
in
assist
the
various
process
.
I
have
responsibility
for
the
STEM
subject
with
my
role
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
we
have
move
to
create
a
fund
that
will
upskill
out
-
of
-
field
teacher
on
the
mathematics
side
in
particular
.
that
will
be
do
through
the
National
Centre
for
Excellence
in
Mathematics
and
Science
Teaching
and
learning
in
the
University
of
Limerick
.
it
will
have
a
vital
impact
in
ensure
that
the
deficit
that
exist
in
STEM
subject
will
be
address
.
it
be
only
a
first
step
.
I
visit
Finland
lately
and
we
have
a
very
positive
engagement
with
the
Finns
about
they
system
.
we
aim
must
be
to
move
up
the
food
chain
.
Senator
Barrett
make
the
point
about
mathematics
teacher
have
a
suitable
qualification
and
that
would
not
be
lose
on
I
.
we
should
meanwhile
ensure
we
teacher
have
the
skill
set
and
availability
of
continue
professional
development
that
be
vital
to
the
system
.
I
be
strike
by
the
point
make
by
Senator
Power
about
boxer
Katie
Taylor
.
arise
from
the
suggestion
,
perhaps
we
could
engage
with
the
National
Council
for
Curriculum
and
Assessment
,
NCCA
,
in
a
way
to
try
to
introduce
a
short
course
in
the
junior
certificate
as
a
potential
staging
post
for
that
kind
of
engagement
.
there
should
be
no
reason
the
NCCA
cannot
engage
on
the
most
blue
sky
think
and
how
to
roll
this
back
to
the
education
system
.
there
may
be
a
way
to
do
this
through
the
short
course
on
the
junior
cycle
.
that
be
one
possibility
.
with
regard
to
the
public
and
political
engagement
with
science
,
we
be
talk
about
a
apolitical
space
,
which
I
mention
before
.
Professor
Mark
Ferguson
,
the
new
director
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
have
engage
with
the
Oireachtas
through
breakfast
briefing
.
if
there
be
specific
idea
that
must
come
from
this
forum
,
we
should
try
to
facilitate
it
.
that
be
one
idea
.
if
a
representative
group
from
this
House
want
to
explore
some
of
that
possibility
,
I
would
more
than
gladly
meet
that
involve
.
with
regard
to
woman
and
science
,
I
attend
the
woman
and
science
event
at
the
European
Commission
quite
recently
.
I
agree
with
Senator
Power
's
comment
.
it
be
fascinating
that
the
National
Institute
for
Bioprocessing
Research
and
Training
,
NIBRT
,
in
UCD
have
a
significant
gender
balance
but
when
we
move
up
the
science
food
chain
,
we
be
more
likely
to
find
man
in
pinstripe
suit
.
there
must
be
a
mechanism
to
allow
great
involvement
by
woman
in
key
decision
making
programme
.
how
can
a
man
like
myself
talk
about
this
without
sound
patronising
?
that
be
the
other
challenge
.
I
can
say
I
be
from
a
generation
of
man
with
no
issue
of
gender
;
my
colleague
be
female
and
if
my
boss
be
a
woman
,
so
be
it
.
I
do
not
know
how
to
speak
about
this
with
authority
except
to
say
there
be
initiative
through
programme
involve
woman
in
science
and
mathematics
.
there
be
the
question
of
break
the
glass
ceiling
and
if
policy
instrument
or
quota
can
be
use
,
and
I
do
not
know
if
that
be
possible
.
it
be
a
conversation
I
be
willing
to
have
.
Senator
Quinn
refer
to
Watson
and
Crick
and
I
be
envious
that
Mr.
James
Watson
be
go
to
the
Senator
's
house
for
dinner
.
I
would
love
to
be
there
.
Senator
Quinn
and
Barrett
be
correct
in
that
we
must
create
a
space
in
this
country
for
debate
about
issue
like
genetically
modify
organism
,
nuclear
fission
and
food
security
.
in
my
constituency
there
be
Teagasc
at
Moorepark
,
and
there
be
a
deep
engagement
,
for
example
,
between
food
science
,
the
dairy
industry
and
food
technology
through
ucc
and
place
like
it
.
with
regard
to
the
Teagasc
facility
at
Moorepark
and
elsewhere
,
I
would
very
much
like
to
create
a
space
where
Teagasc
would
have
some
degree
of
autonomy
to
try
to
spin
out
its
own
company
.
that
would
create
huge
opportunity
.
I
be
schedule
to
meet
with
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
Coveney
,
to
explore
the
possibility
.
Teagasc
be
a
entity
which
face
enterprise
and
I
know
people
like
Mr.
Paul
Ross
at
Moorepark
in
Fermoy
,
who
be
part
of
a
research
cluster
in
ucc
.
there
be
a
engagement
through
Moorepark
technology
limit
.
I
be
not
be
too
parochial
about
this
but
it
be
a
microcosm
of
what
be
happen
.
perhaps
further
possibility
should
be
explore
around
that
and
I
hope
to
have
further
engagement
on
that
also
.
it
be
a
key
point
that
we
do
not
know
the
amount
of
intellectual
property
that
have
be
create
through
the
decade
or
what
be
to
come
.
that
be
why
we
create
the
intellectual
property
protocol
and
the
idea
of
have
a
central
technology
transfer
office
.
every
academic
institution
or
research
facility
will
be
plug
into
a
technology
transfer
system
and
a
intellectual
property
protocol
,
and
that
will
at
least
give
guidance
to
scientist
,
industry
and
the
public
with
regard
to
funding
of
science
and
research
.
many
other
issue
have
be
raise
and
I
would
be
happy
to
engage
further
with
Senator
on
that
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
debate
.

let
I
first
state
that
I
apologise
for
not
be
able
to
engage
with
the
Senator
as
proficiently
as
possible
through
the
medium
of
Irish
.
perhaps
that
be
a
reflection
on
the
rota
of
minister
who
reply
and
perhaps
he
should
have
be
afford
the
opportunity
of
a
full
reply
as

.
I
be
pleased
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
the
Senator
about
DEIS
status
for
Pobal
Scoil
Gaoth
Dobhair
,
County
Donegal
and
scholarship
for
Gaeltacht
student
.
the
process
of
identify
school
for
participation
in
DEIS
be
manage
by
the
Educational
Research
Centre
on
behalf
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
support
by
quality
assurance
work
co-ordinate
through
the
Department
's
regional
office
and
inspectorate
.
second

school
be
select
by
reference
to
centrally
hold
datum
from
the
post
-
primary
pupil
and
the
State
Examination
Commission
database
.
the
identification
process
be
in
line
with
international
good
practice
and
have
regard
to
,
and
employ
,
the
exist
and
most
appropriate
datum
source
available
.
the
school
refer
to
by
the
Senator
be
not
select
for
inclusion
in
DEIS
.
a
review
mechanism
be
put
in
place
that
do
not
quality
for
inclusion
in
the
school
support
programme
under
DEIS
.
a
appeal
by
the
school
to
the
independent
review
body
confirm
that
the
level
of
disadvantage
do
not
warrant
its
inclusion
in
the
DEIS
process
.
none
of
the
exist
school
that
be
unsuccessful
in
the
initial
identification
and
subsequent
review
process
be
ever
admit
to
the
DEIS
programme
.
a
key
priority
for
the
Department
be
to
prioritise
and
target
resource
in
school
with
the
most
concentrate
level
of
educational
disadvantage
.
that
challenge
be
significant
give
the
economic
climate
and
the
target
to
reduce
public
expenditure
.
it
also
reduce
the
capacity
for
any
addition
to
the
DEIS
programme
,
include
the
selection
of
further
school
.
as
announce
in
the
2012
budget
,
five

the
Donogh

scholarship
scheme
will
be
replace
with
a
new
single
scheme
of
bursary
base
on
merit
and
financial
need
.
this
early
scholarship
,
with
one
exception
,
be
award
without
the
application
of
socio-economic
criterion
.
the
new
bursary
be
specifically
design
to
target
student
attend
DEIS
school
in
disadvantaged
area
and
also
indicate
a
level
of
personal
or
family
disadvantage
by
virtue
of
have
qualify
for
a
medical
card
.
the
bursary
will
be
a
extra
support
and
incentive
to
recognise
high
achievement
for
student
from
disadvantaged
family
and
attend
DEIS
school
.
the
change
be
make
to
make
the
good
use
of
the
limited
fund
we
have
available
for
bursary
in
order
to
focus
on
the
good
perform
student
in
the
cohort
of
that
who
be
most
in
need
of
financial
help
.
it
be
envisage
that
60
student
will
receive
a
bursary
this
September
and
the
number
will
rise
over
each
of
next
three
year
with
more
than
350
student
per
year
benefit
by
2015
.
this
change
will
not
impact
on
that
who
already
hold
scholarship
under
the
exist
scheme
and
the
principal
financial
support
make
available
by
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
to
facilitate
access
to
third
level
education
continue
to
be
the
means
test
student
grant
.
other
financial
measure
to
support
broad
access
and
participation
include
the
provision
of
the
special
rate
of
maintenance
grant
for
student
from
welfare
dependent
family
and
the
availability
of
the
student
assistant
fund
at
college
level
to
assist
student
in
particular
financial
difficulty
.
from
the
academic

2012

Department
.
a
new
online
-
only
grant
application
system
have
also
be
introduce
to
facilitate
application
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
but
there
cannot
be
a
geographical
bias
for
bursary
either

to
differentiate
between

—
and
that
make

order
.
section
5
set
out
more
detailed
principle
and
policy
than
under
the
1946
Act
.
this
be
the
principle
and
policy
to
which
the
Labour
Court
must
have
regard
before
register
a
employment
agreement
.
the
2011
high
Court
judgment
confirm
that
the
Oireachtas
may
devolve
certain
law
-
make
power
to
other
body
such

it
clear
that
where
the
Oireachtas
devolve
a
law

make

to
some
other
body
,
it
must
give
that
body
guidance
on
how
the

be
to
be
use
.
that
guidance
should
be
set

.
a
key
element
of
the
reform
provide
for
in

be
the
introduction
of

the

do
not
provide

of
the
phrase
"

,
nor
do
it
provide
any
guidance
on
how
it
be
to
be
measure
.
the
Labour

have
draw
attention
to
the
limitation
of
the
original
statutory

during

in

on

,
there
be
some
suggestion
that

the

a
number
of
amendment
to
replace
provision
strike
down
by
the
high

judgment
in
the
John

the
high

highlight
how

about

of

exacerbate
concern
about
the

of

the

that
a

contraven

in

.
the
minister
do
not
consider
that
this
alternative
to
the
original
enforcement
provision
in
section
45
,
which
be
strike
down
by
the
high

,
should
be
the
only

mechanism
to
ensure
that

be
not

than

set
out

the
minister
intend
,
by
means
of
the
propose
workplace

reform
programme
,
to
develop
a
new
and
comprehensive
system
of
supervision
and
sanction
within
the
framework
of

.
it
will
bring
together
the

of

as
Senator
will
be
aware
,
last
week
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
announce
he
proposal
for
the
workplace
relation
reform
programme
.
one
of
the
feature
of
the
programme
be
to
ensure
a
more
proportionate
,
efficient
and
effective
enforcement
of
all
employment
law
,
include
the
national
minimum
wage
,
register
employment
agreement
and
employment
regulation
order
.
the
minister
will
present
he
proposal
to
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Jobs
,
social
Protection
and
Education
this
week
.
he
intend
to
seek
approval
for
draft
the
workplace
relation
(
reform
)
Bill
,
which
will
give
statutory
effect
to
the
reform
,
include
strengthen
the
enforcement
of
award
.
he
intend
to
make
provision
in
the
Bill
for
a
range
of
enhance
compliance
measure
,
include
the
use
of

notice
,
fix
charge
notice
and
a
new
mechanism
for
enforce
award
of
the
workplace
relation
commission
adjudicator
and
Labour
court
determination
.
I
be
sure
Senator
will
agree
on
the
importance
of
ensure
there
be
a
consistent
approach
to
enforcement
mechanism
across
the
range
of
employment
rights
legislation
.
section
14
provide
for
a
derogation
from
the
scope
of
employment
regulation
order
,
ero
,
for
company
in
case
of
financial
difficulty
.
as
I
have
mention
,
this
provision
mirror
the
mechanism
for
claim
a
exemption
from
the
requirement
to
pay
the
rate
of
remuneration
in
a
register
employment
agreement
,
REA
,
at
section
9
.
the
basis
for
claim
a
exemption
on
grounds
of
inability
to
pay
be
less
restrictive
than
the
equivalent
measure
under
the
National
minimum
Wage
Act
2000
,
which
have
never
be
use
to
date
.
the
objective
of
the
provision
in
the
act
of
2000
be
that
the
relief
seek
by
a
employer
would
be
available
in
case
in
which
a
majority
of
employee
so
agree
.
the
new
provision
cover
situation
in
which
a
majority
of
employee
may
not
necessarily
agree
but
it
can
be
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
Labour
Court
that
there
be
a
genuine
—
albeit
temporary
—
inability
to
pay
and
that
appropriate
safeguard
can
be
assure
.
the
maximum
period
of
a
exemption
will
be
24
month
,
with
a
minimum
of
three
month
.
a
amendment
to
the
Bill
as
present
provide
that
two
consecutive
exemption
will
be
permit
within
the
overall
two
-
year
time
limit
rather
than
a
single
one
under
the
Bill
as
introduce
,
where
this
be
necessary
to
safeguard
employment
.
a
amendment
to
the
Bill
as
present
provide
that
a
employer
's
application
for
a
exemption
on
grounds
of
inability
to
pay
should
not
rest
solely
on
the
declare
support
of
the
majority
of
worker
.
the
key
criterion
should
hinge
upon
the
survival
of
the
employer
and
the
preservation
of
the
job
of
the
individual
concerned
.
the
Labour
Court
must
also
have
regard
to
whether
grant
a
exemption
might
have
a
adverse
effect
on
employment
level
and
cause
a
distortion
of
competition
in
the
sector
to
the
detriment
of
employer
not
party
to
the
particular
application
.

and
constitutional
footing

a
significant
commitment
by
the
government
to
protect

low

.
the
overall
effect
of
this
reform
will
be
to
help
reduce
the
cost
burden
of

compliance
and
will
make

to

.
this
measure
,
in

will
enhance
competitiveness
and
preserve

in

affect
sector
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
as
a
Corkman
,
I
be
look
forward
to
the
game
against
Wexford
.
no
one
should
pre-empt
the
outcome
of
that
match
.
while
I
accept
the
point
Senator
have
make
,
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
Bills
introduce
by
Sinn
Féin
and
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
be
not
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
address
the
issue
be
address
in
this
legislation
.
they
be
too
weak
to
provide
the
robust
and
comprehensive
response
require
by
the
high
court
ruling
.
provision
be
need
that
will
withstand
a
future
challenge
.
that
address
two
of
the
point
.
I
do
not
believe
we
should
forget
the
fact
that
Sinn
Féin
vote
against
the
reversal
of
the
reduction
in
the
minimum
wage
when
we
seek
to
restore
it
to
€
8.65
from
€
7.65
.
while
I
say
this
respectfully
,
I
do
not
think
any
of
we
,
particularly
a
Labour
Party
minister
,
will
take
lecture
in
regard
to
the
rights
of
low
-
pay
worker
.
I
know
there
be
no
lecture
,
but
we
should
give
the
lie
to
the
impression
there
be
only
one
party
in
this
house
that
have
concern
—
a
new
-
find
,
affect
concern
—
for
the
rights
of
low
-
pay
worker
.
Sinn
Féin
be
be
a
little
disingenuous
in
that
regard
.
with
regard
to
Senator
Barrett
's
point
,
if
we
roll
back
the
machinery
that
have
exist
for
a
considerable
period
,
I
contend
we
be
then
in
danger
of
effect
a
regressive
regime
vis-à
-
vo
the
relationship
between
worker
and
employee
.
I
believe
the
State
have
a
role
to
play
in
industrial
relation
.
I
take
the
point
that
one
can
have
a
minimum
wage
and
leave
it
at
that
,
and
the
market
can
determine
anything
thereafter
.
what
we
have
in
this
country
,
which
Senator
Landy
have
espouse
,
be
a
system
in
which
there
be
a
balance
between
the
two
side
.
for
certain
type
of
work
,
there
be
a
market
and
one
can
command
a
certain
price
but
,
also
,
the
State
have
a
machinery
through
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
to
allow
for
robust
protection
of
worker
where
they
feel
they
have
be
malign
in
any
way
.
that
be
the
system
that
exist
,
arguably
,
Europe
-
wide
.
we
should
be
look
towards
country
such
as
Germany
in
term
of
the
model
that
exist
.
there
be
a
wide
philosophical
debate
in
the
point
make
by
Senator
Barrett
.
there
be
a
specific
question
in
regard
to
the
workplace
relation
Bill
,
and
I
can
ask
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
to
speak
on
that
point
when
he
come
to
the
House
on
report
stage
.
what
we
be
try
to
do
here
be
to
respond
responsibly
to
the
result
of
the
high
Court
.
we
want
to
ensure
we
do
not
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water
,
so
that
we
still
have
a
system
that
ensure
the
rights
of
low
-
pay
worker
,
in
which
there
be
redress
and
recourse
for
worker
where
there
be
a
slight
or
perceive
slight
.
we
also
want
to
ensure
there
be
sufficient
flexibility
in
the
system
and
a
statutory
code
in
place
to
ensure
both
side
can
at
least
come
to
the
table
to
hammer
out
some
sort
of
agreement
,
and
do
so
through
a
process
of
consensus
.
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
this
.
I
believe
it
be
a
sensible
solution
,
which
be
what
we
be
try
to
achieve
in
the
Bill
.
we
can
report
significant
progress
have
be
achieve
.
I

of
Mr.

in
the
Visitor
Gallery
.
I
thank
each
of
the
speaker
who
contribute
so
passionately
to
the
debate
on
this
Bill
.
I
will
outline
some
of
the
historical
aspect
of
the
Bill
.
on
Friday
,
31
August
2012
,
Mr.
Justice
Gerard
Hogan
of
the
high
Court
reverse
a
Labour
Court
award
of
€
92000
to
Mr.
Mohammad
Younis
,
a
Pakistani
chef
,
despite
find
that
he
might
have
be
"
the
victim
of
the
most
appalling
exploitation
by
he
employer
"
.
the
judge
find
that
the
contract
of
employment
be
illegal
due
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Younis
do
not
have
a
employment
permit
.
the
judge
note
that
the
employment
permit
Act
make
it
a
offence
for
certain
employee
to
work
without
a
employment
permit
.
the
act
do
not
provide
for
any
defence
for
a
employee
,
which
suggest
to
the
judge
he
could
not
take
into
account
mitigating
circumstance
-----
-----
and
have
little
discretion
but
to
consider
the
contract
of
employment
as
illegal
.
the
result
be
that
,
arguably
,
the
employer
benefit
from
the
illegal
contract
.
the
issue
raise
by
the
high
court
judgment
be
one
which
have
important
policy
and
legal
implication
in
the
area
of
employment
permit
and
also
in
term
of
employment
rights
.
as
Mr.
Justice
Hogan
note
in
he
judgment
,
"
the
Oireachtas
must
,
of
course
,
regulate
the
labour
market
by
specifically
deter
illegal
immigrant
from
take
up
employment
,
as
failure
to
do
so
could
have
serious
medium
term
implication
for
both
employment
and
immigration
policy
.
"
the
relevant
provision
of
the
employment
permit
Act
of
2003
and
2006
hold
that
where
a
employee
who
be
require
to
hold
a
employment
permit
have
fail
to
do
so
,
he
or
she
be
guilty
of
a
offence
and
the
act
do
not
provide
for
a
defence
for
a
employee
in
this
regard
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
judge
take
the
view
that
this
lack
of
defence
affect
the
court
's
scope
to
interpret
the
statutory
provision
and
compel
the
court
to
hold
that
the
legislation
have
create
a
absolute
offence
in
so
far
as
a
employee
be
concerned
.
importantly
,
Mr.
Justice
Hogan
indicate
that
it
must
,
therefore
,
be
take
that
the
Oireachtas
intend
that
,
as
such
,
a
non-national
employee
automatically
commit
a
offence
if
he
or
she
do
not
have
a
work
permit
,
irrespective
of
the
reason
for
that
failure
,
and
that
this
have
implication
so
far
as
the
civil
law
be
concerned
in
that
such
a
contract
of
employment
must
also
be
take
to
be
void
.
the
judgment
identify
something
which
appear
to
be
inherently
unfair
,
that
a
employee
who
have
unwittingly
enter
into
a
illegal
contract
of
employment
may
not
assert
rights
under
that
contract
of
employment
.
that
have
be
acknowledge
.
I
note
that
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
upon
receive
the
judgment
,
quickly
state
he
aim
to
ensure
a
employer
should
not
benefit
from
use
a
illegal
contract
of
employment
where
he
or
she
be
a
willing
party
to
its
creation
.
I
also
know
that
the
minister
meet
Mr
Younis
and
representative
of
the
migrant
Right
Centre
of
Ireland
and
repeat
he
assurance
that
he
would
make
change
to
the
legislation
.
the
Senator
's
Bill
be
to
be
welcome
and
it
should
be
note
that
Senator
Quinn
have
go
to
great
length
in
bring
forward
this
legislation
.
it
provide
we
all
with
a
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
judgment
and
to
identify
a
means
of
rectify
the
legal
position
.
the
Senator
's
Bill
make
two
proposal
.
first
,
it
propose
the
introduction
of
a
defence
for
the
employee
similar
to
that
currently
provide
for
the
employer
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
this
seem
to
be
a
reasonable
proposition
.
however
,
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
current
legislation
be
that
it
be
generally
illegal
for
third
country
national
to
be
employ
in
Ireland
without
a
employment
permit
.
such
national
,
therefore
,
require
the
State
to
give
its
approval
to
the
creation
of
the
contract
of
employment
.
consequently
,
this
proposition
may
mean
,
in
certain
case
,
that
the
State
would
not
have
have
a
opportunity
to
approve
of
the
employment
in
advance
.
this
be
not
a
fundamental
legal
obstacle
but
require
to
be
understand
and
acknowledge
.
second
,
the
Bill
provide
for
a
foreign
national
,
so
long
as
it
be
establish
that
the
person
take
all
such
step
as
be
reasonably
open
to
ensure
compliance
,
to
enforce
the
contract
of
employment
and
any
other
employment
related
rights
under
any
other
enactment
.
this
may
include
any
employment
related
right
,
and
not
only
that
rights
under
what
would
generally
be
consider
to
be
employment
rights
legislation
but
also
that
rights
under
other
legislation
.
arguably
,
a
wide
spectrum
of
legislation
give
rights
relate
to
employment
.
again
,
this
require
careful
consideration
as
many
rights
can
be
deem
to
be
employment
related
.
we
want
to
ensure
unintended
consequence
do
not
arise
.
the
employment
permit
regime
be
a
manage
system
in
that
both
third
country
national
and
they
prospective
employer
must
seek
permission
from
the
State
to
work
legally
in
the
State
and
also
provide
detail
to
the
State
concern
the
propose
work
.
a
key
deterrent
be
the
legal
assumption
,
with
certain
exception
,
that
not
have
a
employment
permit
create
a
offence
for
the
employer
and
the
employee
.
the
question
that
arise
for
policymaker
be
the
extent
to
which
such
worker
should
be
dissuade
from
work
illegally
in
Ireland
by
virtue
of
there
be
a
statutory
offence
to
do
so
versus
the
extent
to
which
certain
employment
rights
should
protect
vulnerable
migrant
who
find
themselves
unwittingly
in
such
employment
position
.
I
understand
my
Department
be
advise
that
the
judgment
raise
matter
that
be
particularly
complex
and
that
this
matter
be
receive
priority
attention
with
a
view
to
identify
the
good
way
in
which
the
legislation
may
be
amend
.
the
challenge
be
to
meet
the
objective
of
the
Senator
's
Bill
in
a
manner
which
do
not
affect
the
careful
balance
of
interest
between
employer
and
employee
across
the
employment
rights
legislation
as
well
as
other
rights
under
other
act
.
in
particular
,
attention
be
be
give
to
the
way
legislation
can
be
draft
to
ensure
the
particular
outcome
in
the
case
to
which
the
high
Court
refer
can
be
prevent
in
future
in
a
manner
which
do
not
result
in
any
unintended
consequence
.
decision
on
the
legal
option
will
be
make
in
light
of
further
legal
advice
and
in
consultation
with
other
Department
.
I
stress
that
the
judgement
relate
only
to
the
consideration
of
a
employee
's
rights
.
it
do
not
mean
that
unscrupulous
employer
can
employ
unauthorised
third
country
national
without
run
the
risk
of
significant
legal
consequence
.
I
emphasise
that
a
employer
who
engage
in
this
type
of
activity
be
open
to
prosecution
under
the
employment
permit
legislation
and
could
be
find
guilty
of
a
offence
,
and
liable
on
conviction
on
indictment
to
a
fine
not
exceed
€
250000
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
not
exceed
ten
year
or
both
.
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
to
amend
the
employment
permit
legislation
in
a
precise
manner
to
ensure
a
employer
may
not
benefit
from
the
illegality
of
the
contract
of
employment
where
they
be
find
culpable
in
not
ensure
a
valid
employment
permit
be
in
place
for
the
employee
concerned
.
to
this
end
,
the
minister
will
propose
the
necessary
provision
in
a
new
employment
permit
Bill
currently
be
draft
and
which
be
anticipate
to
be
introduce
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
.
this
would
be
the
most
appropriate
method
of
deal
with
such
a
technically
specific
matter
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
that
reply
.
as
it
seem
to
be
geographically
specific

perhaps
there
be
more

of

I
be
delighted
to
be
back
in
the
Seanad

I
watch
the
Order
of
Business
outside
and
could
not
but
be
take
by
the
vim
and
vigour
of
that
who
contribute
.
I
applaud
they
for
they
energy
,
give
the
work
they
have
have
to
do
in
the
past
24
hour
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
extend
the
remit
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
to
enable
it
to
fund
apply
research
in
addition
to
its
exist
remit
to
fund
orient
basic
research
.
the
Bill
also
provide
for
other
amendment
to
the
function
of
the
foundation
,
include
the
refocusing
of
the
research
theme
to
be
fund
by
it
,
cover
both
orient
basic
research
and
apply
research
,
towards
area
that
have
the
great
potential
to
deliver
a
sustainable
economic
return
through
enterprise
development
,
employment
creation
and
quality
of
life
.
the
Bill
provide
for
certain
amendment
to
exist
legislation
relate
to
Forfás
,
Shannon
Development
and
Enterprise
Ireland
.
this
be
unrelated
to
the
propose
change
to
the
remit
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
but
be
include
as
they
be
all
within
the
framework
of
the
Industrial
Development
Act
.
the
amendment
relate
to
Shannon
Development
be
a
necessary
one
to
the
Industrial
Development
Act
to
provide
for
new
arrangement
for
the
promotion
of
enterprise
opportunity
in
the
mid-
region
.
before
I
describe
the
provision
of
the
Bill
in
more
detail
,
I
propose
to
outline
the
background
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
its
role
in
the
national
research
and
innovation
system
and
the
broad
role
of
research
and
innovation
in
the
overall
strategy
for
economic
recovery
and
growth
.
I
will
also
outline
the
rationale
for
the
change
propose
in
the
Bill
and
they
contribution
to
this
strategy
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
be
establish
under
the
Industrial
Development
(
Science
Foundation
Ireland
)
Act
2003
.
under
that
act
,
the
main
function
of
the
foundation
be
to
"
promote
,
develop
and
assist
the
carry
out
of
orient
basic
research
in
strategic
area
of
scientific
endeavour
that
concern
the
future
development
and
competitiveness
of
industry
and
enterprise
in
the
State
"
.
the
Act
specify
information
and
communication
technology
and
biotechnology
as
"
strategic
area
of
scientific
endeavour
"
.
Sustainable
energy
and
energy
-
efficient
technology
be
subsequently
specify
,
by
means
of
regulation
,
as
comprise
a
additional
strategic
area
of
scientific
endeavour
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
provide
grant
to
researcher
and
research
group
that
be
base
in
high
education
institution
on
the
basis
of
competitive
call
for
proposal
with
selection
on
the
basis
of
international
peer
review
.
the
foundation
's
funding
programme
support
research
team
lead
by
principal
investigator
,
the
clustering
of
research
team
with
industry
engagement
and
large
-
scale
group
of
research
team
to
address
a
more
limited
number
of
strategic
thematic
area
in
collaboration
with
industry
partner
.
the
preparation
of
this
legislation
provide
the
opportunity
to
remind
ourselves
of
and
articulate
the
reason
the
government
fund
research
and
development
.
it
be
accept
internationally
that
the
private
sector
do
not
fund
research
and
development
at
the
optimum
level
for
economic
and
societal
benefit
.
the
reason
for
this
include
the
fact
that
research
and
development
,
particularly
basic
research
,
be
inherently
risky
.
the
commercial
return
be
often
insufficiently
clear
for
the
private
investor
.
another
reason
be
that
the
societal
return
from
investment
in
research
and
development
sometimes
outweigh
the
direct
return
to
the
private
investor
.
if
the
private
investor
do
not
capture
all
of
the
return
generate
from
the
investment
,
this
may
act
as
a
disincentive
for
the
private
sector
.
this
reason
apply
in
Ireland
as
they
do
elsewhere
.
it
could
be
argue
that
Ireland
,
as
a
small
,
open
economy
,
can
take
advantage
of
discovery
make
elsewhere
and
avoid
significant
investment
in
research
and
development
,
particularly
basic
research
.
however
,
if
we
be
to
absorb
and
take
advantage
of
externally
generate
new
knowledge
,
we
must
have
the
capability
to
understand
and
use
it
.
therefore
,
the
economy
must
conduct
research
and
development
itself
.
as
the
global
economy
and
society
be
constantly
change
and
develop
,
there
be
a
ongoing
need
to
address
societal
,
environmental
and
economic
challenge
.
if
Ireland
be
to
maintain
and
enhance
its
position
in
the
global
economy
,
we
economy
need
to
keep
pace
.
we
past
and
current
economic
success
provide
no
guarantee
of
success
in
the
future
.
therefore
,
we
must
continue
to
invest
appropriately
in
creation
and
innovation
if
we
be
to
be
able
to
compete
in
the
global
marketplace
.
there
have
be
significant
public
investment
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
in
Ireland
since
the
late
1990
.
this
be
initiate
from
a
low
base
.
before
then
,
Ireland
have
not
invest
significantly
in
research
and
development
and
we
international
rank
for
quality
of
scientific
research
be
well
below
OECD
standard
,
on
a
par
with
some
third
World
country
.
the
lack
of
high
-
quality
research
personnel
perform
industrially
relevant
research
be
deem
to
be
a
impediment
to
attract
large
-
scale
knowledge
-
intensive
industrial
project
to
Ireland
and
to
develop
indigenous
internationally
competitive
,
high
-
growth
firm
.
while
the
economy
have
grow
substantially
during
the
1990
,
with
substantial
employment
growth
and
improvement
in
prosperity
,
there
be
a
concern
in
the
late
1990
that
Ireland
be
no
long
a
low
-
wage
economy
.
the
movement
of
manufacturing
to
low
cost
economy
be
evident
.
it
be
clear
that
Ireland
have
to
make
the
transition
to
high
add
value
product
and
service
that
allow
we
to
sustain
and
increase
income
.
a
key
part
of
this
process
involve
recognise
the
importance
of
knowledge
creation
and
innovation
in
sustain
and
enhance
competitiveness
.
National
policy
be
develop
to
focus
on
build
new
source
of
competitive
advantage
with
a
view
to
sustain
growth
and
job
in
the
long
term
.
this
involve
reposition
Irish
enterprise
high
in
the
value
chain
,
thereby
require
more
highly
skilled
and
knowledge
-
base
employment
.
the
key
to
Ireland
's
continue
success
be
to
ensure
the
enterprise
development
agency
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
successfully
promote
the
establishment
and
development
of
firm
with
a
competitive
advantage
base
on
knowledge
,
technology
,
innovation
and
related
skill
rather
than
on
maintain
traditional
activity
and
approach
.
in
1998
the
Irish
Council
for
Science
,
Technology
and
Innovation
undertake
a
technology
foresight
initiative
which
seek
to
identify
emerge
technology
that
would
be
central
to
national
economic
development
in
future
year
.
the
report
of
the
initiative
recommend
that
the
government
establish
a
fund
to
enable
Ireland
to
become
a
centre
for
world
-
class
research
excellence
in
strategically
important
area
such
as
ICT
and
biotechnology
and
they
underlying
science
.
the
government
accept
this
recommendation
and
subsequently
establish
Science
Foundation
Ireland
to
administer
this
fund
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
investment
in
human
capital
in
strategic
area
of
scientific
endeavour
be
complement
by
investment
under
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
,
which
be
administer
by
the
High
Education
Authority
.
this
investment
be
aim
at
develop
high
-
quality
research
capability
in
high
education
institution
,
include
research
building
,
facility
and
equipment
.
this
public
investment
have
have
a
significant
impact
in
the
past
decade
or
more
.
the
human
capital
,
infrastructure
and
system
that
have
be
develop
from
this
investment
be
feed
through
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
and
commercialisation
.
in
2012
more
than
40
%
of
IDA
Ireland
's
job
announcement

of
we
research

.
this
represent
a
improvement
on
we
rank
of
36th
in
2003
.
we
be
perform
very
well
in

field
.
we

both
of
which
be
key
to

's

this

such

be
see
as
a

element
in

of

for

the
impact
of

can
be

in

they

we
have
see
a
almost
sixfold
increase
in
this
regard
,
to
the
point
at
which
the
comparable
figure
for
2011
be
€700

the
area
around

orient
to

be
appropriate
for

a
broad
base

Ireland
be
now
look
to
build
on
the
strength
that
have
emerge
from

to
target
future
investment
in
area
that
link
directly
to
current
and
likely
future
economic
and

need
.
it
be
appropriate
for
Ireland
to
define
more
precisely
the
area
where
critical
mass
and
concentration
of
effort
will
maximise
return
.
as
a
small
country
which
be
very
dependent
on
the
global
market
,
it
make
strategic
sense
that
we
should
,
to
a
significant
but
not
exclusive
extent
,
focus
on
that
area
of
research
with
the
great
potential
for
development
of
application
to
generate
economic
growth
and
address
problem
in
we
society
.
in
addition
,
give
the
harsh
reality
of
we
current
fiscal
and
economic
crisis
,
there
be
compete
and
equally
compelling
demand
for
Exchequer
investment
and
we
need
to
ensure
now
,
more
than
ever
,
that
we
achieve
the
optimum
impact
from
we
investment
.

to
identify
priority

for
the

this
exercise
be
comprehensive
,
involve
extensive
research
,
analysis
and
stakeholder
consultation
.
the
report
of
the
group
be
approve
by
government
in
February
2012
.
the
group
identify
14
priority
area
of
opportunity
for
Ireland
and
six
underpin
technology
and
infrastructure
to
support
this
priority
area
,
on
the
basis
of
exist
strength
of
the

,
opportunity
in
term
of
the
global
marketplace
and
that
which
be
most
likely
to
deliver
economic
and
societal
impact
,
and
,
ultimately
,
job

the
aim
be
to
align
the
majority
of

,
sti
,
investment
with
the
14
area
of
opportunity
identify
in
the
report
,
as
well
as
the
underpin

.
the
report
also
acknowledge
the
important
role
of
research
for
policy
and
research
for
knowledge
and
recommend
that
the
remain
funding
be
channel
to
support
this
two
area
.
a
number
of
measure
be
also
recommend
to
improve
the

effectiveness
of

it
be
in
this
context
that
the
Bill
provide
for
the
refocusing
of
the
research
theme
to
be
fund
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
towards
the
priority
area
of
opportunity
.
in
the
context
of
consider
how
to
accelerate
the
impact
of
public
investment
in
research
,
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
we
have
the
mechanism
in
place
to
maximise
the
opportunity
arise
from
the
research
fund
by
SFI
and
which
be
carry

currently
,
SFI
's

be
to
carry
out
"

"
.
the
definition
of
orient

in
the
2003
act
which
establish
SFI
follow
a
internationally
recognise
categorisation
as
set
out
in

know
as
the

manual
.
it
be
define
as

that
be

.
in
other
word
,
this
research
be
expect
to
produce
result
that
form
the
basis
for

.
apply
research
mean
"

to

the

further
from
where
many
researcher
find
themselves
as
the
possible

not
yet

.
consequently
,
the
propose
addition
to
the
SFI
remit
be
intend
to
fill
this
gap
.
the
extension
of
SFI
's
remit
to
include
apply

will
take
the
outcome
of
orient

fund
by
SFI
close
to

,
which
in
turn
increase
the
potential
of
research
to
yield
commercial
opportunity
and

,
as
well
as
other
societal
benefit
.
the

also
include
a
new
function
to
enable

to
promote
and
support
awareness
and
understanding
of

transfer
responsibility
for
delivery
of
the
Discover
Science
and
Engineering
programme
from
Forfás
to
SFI
on
a
administrative
basis
with
effect
from
1
March
2012
.
since
its
establishment
in
2003
,
the
Discover
Science

Engineering
programme
have
be
actively
work
with
company
and
high
education
institution
,
as
well
as
representative
body
such
as
Engineer
Ireland
to
heighten
the
awareness
of
science
and
engineering
and
to
raise
the
level
of
student
uptake
of
the
physical
science
at
second
and
third
level
.
the
objective
of
Discover
Science
and
Engineering
be
to
promote
awareness
and
understanding
of
the
importance
of
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and

,
to
increase
the
number
of

and
to
foster
a
great
public
understanding
of
the
physical

and
they
value
to
Irish
society
.
there
be
many
synergy
and
mutual
complementarity
between
Discover

and
Engineering
and
SFI
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
outreach
programme
run
through
the
SFI

.
this
transfer
enable
synergy
between
the
Discover
Science

Engineering
programme
and
SFI
funding
to
be
maximise
and
will
increase
the
impact
of
this
programme
.
the
Bill
provide
power
for
SFI
to
provide
funding
for
research
group
base
in
Northern
Ireland
and
also
to
enable
participation
by
SFI
in
international

programme
.
SFI
do
not
currently
have
the
power
to
fund
research
group
outside
the
State
.
in
regard
to
Northern
Ireland
,
the
Bill
enable
SFI
to
provide
funding
for
research
group
in
Northern
Ireland
under
a
exist
scheme
,
know
as
the

follow
the
extension
of
SFI

in
2008
,
the
Minister
for
Enterprise

and
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
agree
in
2008
that
responsibility
for
the
Charles

scheme
would
transfer
to
the
then
Department
of
Enterprise

,
with
management
of
the
award
undertake
by
SFI
.
this
transfer
be
complete
in
November
2009
.
under
the
scheme

.
while
responsibility
for
the
management
of
all
of
the
award
have
be
transfer
to
SFI
,
for
the
time
being
,
any

the
Department
of

subject
to
performance
under
the
term
of
the
award
,
the
final
payment
be
due
to
be
make
to
the
awardee
in
2013
.
this
change
will
enable
SFI
to
fund
this
award
directly
,
as
be
already
the
case
regard
the
awardee
base
in
the
State
.
the
more
general
power
for
SFI
to
fund
research
group
in
Northern
Ireland
will
enhance
opportunity
for
collaboration
between
research
group
both
North
and
South
.
to
leverage
good
value
from
Ireland
's
research
investment
it
be
propose
to
enable
SFI
,
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
minister
,
to
enter
cost
-
share
arrangement
with
international
partner
in
area
link
with
its
mandate
priority
area
and
where
Irish
researcher
have
real
potential
to
achieve
add
value
from
such
arrangement
.
it
be
important
for
Ireland
,
through
SFI
,
to
be
ready
to
participate
in
international
programme
in
area
where
Ireland
have
research
strength
when
the
opportunity
arise
.
it
open
up
access
to
external
non-Exchequer
funding
opportunity
and
facility
for
Irish
researcher
which
would
not
be
available
otherwise
.
it
be
generally
accept
that
international
collaboration
on
research
bring
together
resource
and
the
pooling
of
knowledge
,
enhance
scientific
excellence
and
thus
achieve
great
success
in
address
research
problem
,
as
well
as
great
efficiency
.
participate
in
international
research
programme
facilitate
inward
and
outward
mobility
of
researcher
,
access
to
transnational
collaborative
network
,
access
to
research
facility
not
available
in
Ireland
and
commercialise
idea
and
know
-
how
.
there
be
a
increase
trend
at
European
level
towards
research
funding
scheme
which
involve
pooling
of
funding
by
member
state
,
with
or
without
additional
European
funding
.
SFI
's
participation
in
this
scheme
be
restrict
due
to
the
limitation
of
the
2003
act
in
respect
of
funding
project
outside
the
State
.
while
some
form
of
pooling
of
funding
can
be
carry
out
under
the
exist
legislation
,
other
form
of
pooling
be
outside
its
scope
.
the
European
Commission
's
proposal
for
research
and
innovation
funding
for
the
period
2014
to
2020
,
Horizon
2020
,
include
the
allocation
of
co-funding
for
member
state
collaboration
,
subject
to
"
clear
financial
commitment
of
the
participate
country
,
include
prior
commitment
to
pool
national
and
/
or
regional
investment
for
transnational
research
and
innovation
"
.
in
this
circumstance
,
unless
Ireland
participate
in
such
fund
-
pooling
arrangement
,
Irish
researcher
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
compete
for
the
fund
,
include
the
matching
fund
be
make
available
from
the
European
Union
.
therefore
,
as
part
of
Ireland
's
effort
to
maximise
we
drawdown
from
EU
research
funding
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
be
in
a
position
to
engage
in
"
common
pot
"
arrangement
,
where
appropriate
.
it
be
also
appropriate
that
Ireland
leverage
research
be
fund
by
other
state
and
share
the
economic
impact
.
in
addition
,
scientific
and
engineering
equipment
and
facility
be
become
more
and
more
expensive
to
build
and
maintain
.
globally
,
particularly
in
Europe
,
the
solution
be
to
share
development
and
operational
cost
.
researcher
in
participate
state
can
use
such
infrastructure
and
machinery
.
if
Ireland
cannot
contribute
to
such
infrastructure
,
access
to
it
by
we
researcher
may
be
restrict
to
the
detriment
of
research
here
and
the
intend
enterprise
consequence
.
in
some
of
this
programme
there
may
be
no
guarantee
"
juste
retour
"
in
respect
of
a
Irish
contribution
,
but
participation
in
such
programme
would
be
evaluate
on
the
basis
of
Irish
research
strength
in
the
specific
area
.
I
will
now
turn
to
the
other
matter
deal
with
in
the
Bill
.
I
will
deal
first
with
the
reorganisation
of
enterprise
development
function
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
.
on
27
November
last
the
government
agree
to
implement
the
decision
take
in
principle
last
May
to
merge
Shannon
Development
with
Shannon
Airport
in
order
to
create
a
new
aviation
-
focus
entity
with
a
commercial
mandate
in
public
ownership
.
the
government
agree
a
number
of
action
which
would
be
implement
to
give
effect
to
this
decision
.
this
include
the
separation
of
Shannon
Airport
from
the
Dublin
Airport
Authority
and
the
decision
to
transfer
Shannon
Development
's
function
in
respect
of
indigenous
enterprise
and
foreign
direct
investment
to
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
respectively
.
the
latter
decision
will
act
as
a
catalyst
for
economic
development
and
job
creation
as
it
will
ensure
indigenous
and
multinational
industry
already
in
the
Shannon
region
or
consider
locate
there
will
have
access
to
a
comprehensive
range
of
support
.
by
merge
a
strong
independent
Shannon
Airport
with
the
extensive
property
holding
,
experience
and
expertise
of
Shannon
Development
,
we
will
create
a
strong
new
state
company
which
will
work
with
IDA
Ireland
and
Enterprise
Ireland
on
develop
a
international
aviation
service
centre
in
the
region
.
the
implementation
of
this
decision
represent
a
new
start
for
enterprise
and
job
creation
in
the
Shannon
region
.
in
order
to
bring
about
the
transfer
of
enterprise
function
,
it
be
necessary
to
remove
the
restriction
which
prevent
IDA
Ireland
and
Enterprise
Ireland
from
provide
enterprise
function
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
.
section
8
of
the
Bill
provide
for
the
repeal
of
section
11
(
2
)
of
the
Industrial
Development
Act
1986
which
prevent
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
from
provide
and
administer
grant
and
other
financial
facility
for
industry
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
.
the
subsection
also
prevent
the
agency
from
provide
,
develop
,
construct
,
alter
,
adapt
,
maintain
and
administer
industrial
estate
and
factory
building
,
together
with
the
associate
facility
of
such
estate
and
building
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
.
it
can
be
see
,
therefore
,
that
this
provision
be
require
to
give
full
effect
to
the
government
's
decision
of
last
November
.
it
be
without
prejudice
to
future
legislative
development
require
to
place
the
new
organisational
arrangement
on
a
statutory
basis
.
Enterprise
Ireland
,
IDA
Ireland
and
Shannon
Development
be
in
regular
contact
to
ensure
there
will
be
a
smooth
transfer
of

,
with
no

the
level
of

on
the
wide
issue
of
establish
the

a

the
Secretary
General
of

Shannon

and

of
the

's
decision
on

.
the
Bill
provide
for
reform
of
the
legislation
govern
the
collection
of
research
and
development
datum
by
Forfás
.
the
Science
and
Technology
Act
1987
provide
for
the
preparation
by
Forfás
of
a
science
budget
on
a
periodic
basis
.
it
oblige
body
fund
under
the
science
budget
to
supply
to
Forfás
such
information
in
such
form
and
at
such
time
as
it
may
require
.
the
datum
,
collate
and
publish
biennially
by
Forfás
as
the
"
science
budget
"
,
measure
overall
expenditure
on
science
and
technology
in
the
government
sector
.
the
area
of
expenditure
measure
be
much
broad
than
and
do
not
align
with
current
international
practice
in
monitor
science
,
technology
and
innovation
expenditure
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
consider
that
the
result
survey
be
neither
a
useful
policy
tool
nor
a
effective
use
of
staff
resource
.
the
deletion
of
this
provision
be
,
therefore
,
propose
as
a
administrative
efficiency
measure
.
the
tone
of
my
speech
suggest
one
be
a
bridge
to
another
,
but
it
be
another
part
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
not
a
continuation
of
the
Shannon
Development
piece
but
a
new
part
.
however
,
Forfás
will
continue
to
compile
on
a
annual
basis
a
major
component
of
the
science
budget
,
know
as
"
government
budget
appropriation
or
outlay
on
research
and
development
"
,
GBAORD
,
a
internationally
comparable
metric
carry
out
use
harmonise
concept
and
definition
under
OECD
definition
.
this
be
require
under
a
commission
regulation
relate
to
statistic
for
science
and
technology
.
the
Bill
require
a
institution
to
supply
information
to
Forfás
from
time
to
time
for
the
purpose
of
the
commission
regulation
and
in
respect
of
research
and
development
fund
wholly
or
partly
from
money
provide
by
the
Oireachtas
.
this
will
give
statutory
back
for
the
collection
of
datum
by
Forfás
for
the
GBAORD
survey
and
other
purpose
.
the
opportunity
be
be
take
in
the
Bill
to
align
the
legislation
govern
SFI
and
Enterprise
Ireland
with
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
SFI
and
Enterprise
Ireland
be
body
to
which
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
apply
.
however
,
section
16
of
the
Industrial
Development
Act
1998
in
respect
of
Enterprise
Ireland
and
section
17
of
the
2003
act
in
respect
of
SFI
prohibit
disclosure
of
confidential
information
by
board
member
,
staff
and
other
specify
person
.
it
be
propose
to
make
this
section
subject
to
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
and
thereby
allow
for
disclosure
of
confidential
information
in
accordance
with
that
act
.
I
will
now
summarise
the
section
of
the
Bill
.
section
1
set
out
the
definition
of
term
use
in
the
Bill
.
section

Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
be
pay
out
of
money
provide
by
the
Oireachtas
.
section
3
provide
for
further
definition
of
term
use
in
the
Bill
,
include
the
definition
of
"
apply

"
.
section
4
set
out
the
revise
function
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
section
5
deal
with
the
provision
by
the
foundation
of
funding
to
institution
base
in
Northern
Ireland
and
to
international
project
.
section
6
provide
for
a
consequential
amendment
to
the
original
Act
govern
Science
Foundation
Ireland
arise
from
the
extension
of
its
remit
to
apply
research
.
the
2003
Act
provide
that
the
foundation
should
comment
in
its
annual
report
on
the
orient
basic
research
fund
by
it
.
this
requirement
be
now
extend
to
encompass
all
research
fund
by
the
foundation
.
section
7
provide
for
the
repeal
of
provision
relate
to
compilation
of
the
science
budget
by
Forfás
.
section
8
repeal
the
restriction
on
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
in
respect
of
the
Shannon

section
11
provide
for
the
short
title
to
the
Bill
,
the
collective
citation
provision
and
the
commencement
of
the
provision
relate
to
the
legislation
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
I
be
very
grateful
.
I
genuinely
thank
every
member
who
have
contribute
to
the
debate
.
I
will
respond
as
good
I
can
and
some
very
valid
point
have
be
raise
.
if
I
do
not
respond
to
all
of
they
,
I
will
be
happy
to
respond
again
on
another
day
,
with
the
permission
of
the
House
.
let
I
begin
with
the
dialogue
that
have
emerge
on
basic
research
as
oppose
to
apply
research
.
it
have
be
say
we
cannot
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
with
regard
to
basic
research
.
the
Higgs
boson
analogy
be
draw
upon
regularly
,
but
it
be
somewhat
tired
at
this
stage
.
to
be
blunt
,
it
be
normally
inform
by
that
who
have
not
really
read
the
fine
print
.
there
be
no
danger
that
we
will
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
fund
basic
research
.
we
must
provide
context
.
on
25
January
SFI
announce
a
fund
worth
€
60
million
cover
basic
research
,
computer
-
assist
neurosurgery
,
animation
,
inflammatory
disease
,
hepatitis
c
,
ICT
,
tissue
engineering
,
chemistry
,
biofilm
,
microbiology
,
carbon
sequestration
,
farm
waste
for
bioenergy
,
etc
.
it
be
incorrect
to
imply
we
be
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
this
regard
.
the
remit
of
SFI
be
very
clear
.
it
be
important
,
however
,
that
when
the
country
be
go
through
a
period
of
economic
turmoil
,
we
seek
to
ensure
taxpayer
's
money
be
invest
to
achieve
the
great
societal
and
economic
output
.
that
be
what
we
be
try
to
achieve
.
advance
the
remit
of
SFI
be
part
of
what
I
call
the
stage
-
gate
process
.
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
Dr.
Harris
and
previous
government
in
this
area
.
it
be
a
apolitical
space
.
it
be
a
space
in
which
the
only
difference
of
emphasis
might
pertain
to
whether
one
fund
,
with
taxpayer
's
money
,
basic
or
apply
research
.
in
the
past
ten
or
15
year
emphasis
be
place
on
building
capacity
,
human
capital
and
put
brick
and
mortar
in
place
through
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
.
it
be
now
a
question
of
be
in
the
top
ten
in
the
area
I
outline
in
my
open
remark
.
it
be
a
question
of
recognise
that
we
must
now
move
to
a
new
stage
of
excellence
.
we
must
not
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
;
rather
,
we
must
prioritise
the
relevant
area
.
it
must
be
remember
that
funding
for
Science
Foundation
Ireland
be
approximately
€
150
million
.
the
High
Education
Authority
budget
be
approximately
€
1.02
billion
.
Senator
Clune
speak
about
the
14
key
area
of
research
prioritisation
.
I
chair
the
prioritisation
action
group
whose
purpose
be
to
provide
action
plan
for
the
key
area
of
priority
in
order
that
we
can
fund
that
area
and
bring
industry
engagement
into
new
area
of
opportunity
to
maximise
economic
and
societal
output
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
budget
line
for
the
14
area
be
approximately
€
440
million
.
there
be
a
large
tranche
of
money
available
for
research
from
other
source
.
I
agree
with
Senator
Barrett
that
we
must
have
a
degree
of
flexibility
.
that
be
why
as
the
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
,
I
be
lead
a
conversation
whose
end
point
be
a
well
round
view
of
the
landscape
such
that
the
Irish
Research
Council
talk
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
to
the
Health
Research
Board
and
the
HEA
and
that
everybody
be
move
in
one
direction
with
consensus
.
we
can
then
ensure
that
there
be
flexibility
build
into
the
system
such
that
we
find
mechanism
or
small
pot
of
money
to
fund
the
perceive
outlier
who
be
do
niche
,
blue
-
sky
or
esoteric
research
which
be
no
less
important
to
,
and
legitimate
in
,
we
society
.
Impact
be
the
key
factor
.
we
no
long
fund
for
the
sake
of
funding
but
on
the
basis
that
the
people
in
that
area
can
prove
that
there
be
a
impact
,
whether
economic
or
societal
.
that
do
not
exclude
the
basic
research
scientist
.
for
example
,
I
do
not
think
there
be
a
over
-
emphasis
on
fund
stem
cell
research
,
but
we
must
ensure
we
fund
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
have
a
throughput
start
at
primary
level
to
bring
a
cadre
of
young
bright
Irish
mind
to
fuel
the
tertiary
sector
.
that
be
in
line
with
SFI
's
Agenda
2020
document
whose
philosophy
and
vision
be
that
Ireland
become
one
of
the
good
country
in
the
world
at
achieve
excellence
.
I
be
over
time
.
yes
.
in
respect
of
stem
cell
research
,
it
be
important
to
recognise
the
importance
of
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
.
we
must
take
the
recent
TIMSS
and
PIRLS
exercise
which
show
that
we
be
do
well
on
literacy
and
be
above
average
on
mathematics
and
science
subject
at
primary
level
.
this
be
extrapolate
from
fourth
class
student
.
it
be
vital
that
we
make
a
great
investment
in
continue
professional
development
in
that
area
.
with
regard
to
pure
mathematics
,
I
find
it
interesting
that
people
raise
this
point
when
there
be
a
clear
public
record
and
proof
that
in
the
last
round
of
SFI
funding
we
give
more
than
€
2
million
to
MSSI
at
the
University
of
Limerick
for
the
examination
of
pure
mathematics
.
we
be
cover
all
the
basis
.
we
be
still
in
a
period
of
transition
but
we
be
mindful
that
we
be
not
go
to
be
too
hemm
in
about
how
we
approach
funding
for
science
.
I
refer
the
Member
to
SFI
's
document
about
SFI
research
impact
,
publish
in
January
2013
.
it
ask
what
be
mean
by
impact
,
impact
and
output
and
impact
statement
.
it
be
a
very
good
,
clear
,
concise
document
explain
how
impact
will
be
measure
and
so
on
and
so
forth
.
I
be
happy
to
come
back
to
the
House
to
address
the
other
point
at
a
late
stage
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
she
contribution
.
in
the
minister
's
absence
,
I
will
bring
it
to
he
attention
and
ask
he
,
if
necessary
,
to
get
in
touch
with
the
Senator
on
this
matter
.

I
thank
the
Senator
.
I
will
respond
in
general
to
some
of
the
point
raise
by
he
.
his
point
be
valid
and
we
be
conscious
of
they
because
we
want
to
ensure
we
have
the
good
research
landscape
in
the
world
.
that
be
we
ambition
and
with
the
meagre
resource
we
have
,
give
we
be
borrowing
€300
million
per
week
,
we
want
to
prioritise
.
I
take
the
Senator
's
point
on
the
word
"
strategic
"
but
the
sense
of
the
word
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
that
we
have
a
strategy
that
be
map
out
through
the
national
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
the
steering
group
have
report
on
14
key
area
the
State
will
fund
.
that
be
not
the
end
.
the
State
's
resource
that
be
apply
to
this
be
a
portion
of
the
overall
spend
on
research
and
innovation
.
we
need
to
have
context
.
the
HEA
block
grant
be
€
1.02
billion
and
research
prioritisation
amount
to
€
440
million
.
there
be
other
research
funder
through
private
enterprise
and
entity
such
as
the
Health
Research
Board
,
Teagasc
and
the
Irc
.
if
we
send
a
signal
about
this
legislation
to
the
research
community
,
it
must
say
that
in
time
of
economic
constraint
,
we
have
build
up
the
capacity
in
recent
year
and
now
we
want
to
sharpen
the
focus
.
that
do
not
mean
that
botanist
,
for
instance
,
cannot
be
fund
within
the
Irish
landscape
.
it
be
not
true
to
say
that
if
they
be
not
within
research
prioritisation
,
they
will
not
be
fund
.
it
be
unfair
for
anyone
to
make
that
assumption
.
there
be
imaginative
way
where
if
people
can
prove
a
economic
or
social
impact
,
and
there
be
clear
metric
set
out
by
SFI
in
the
area
,
I
see
no
reason
that
area
of
research
can
not
be
fund
.
if
a
project
do
not
fit
into
prioritisation
,
it
do
not
mean
the
area
will
be
a
outlier
in
the
system
.
Talk
of
mathematics
,
which
underpin
all
of
the
good
science
,
there
be
no
reason
that
mathematician
cannot
map
on
to
the
prioritisation
exercise
.
there
be
a
mechanism
for
they
to
do
that
.
we
be
think
long
term
and
in
term
of
the
next
generation
.
we
want
to
come
up
with
a
research
infrastructure
to
ensure
that
we
can
attract
the
sort
of
world
class
researcher
who
be
so
necessary
for
the
system
we
have
and
to
measure
up
to
that
excellence
and
have
a
long
-
term
goal
of
excellence
.
this
legislation
be
part
of
that
process
and
be
necessary
.
there
be
within
the
prioritisation
exercise
a
clear
pathway
to
measure
output
.
we
be
in
the
midst
of
complete
a
metric
paper
with
the
assistance
of
Forfás
,
which
I
thank
for
its
work
so
far
,
that
will
measure
output
and
impact
.
it
be
important
to
measure
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
where
funding
be
be
funnel
and
the
impact
it
be
have
.
that
process
be
ongoing
and
I
be
conscious
of
the
Senator
's
point
.
I
also
agree
with
the
Senator
about
the
role
of
industry
.
sometimes
we
get
stark
message
from
industry
but
we
be
engage
in
a
process
whereby
we
be
put
together
a
group
of
people
,
some
from
the
HEI
and
some
from
industry
,
in
order

out
what

there
be
two
aspect
to
that

we
must
ensure
we
have
the
continue
professional
development
that
be
so
vital
at
primary
and
secondary
level
so
we
have
the
through

put
into
the
tertiary
education
sphere

we
also
must
ensure
that
where
disparate
initiative
be
take
place
in
industry
,
if
there
be
a
way
to
map
they
,
we
will
do
so
to
see
how
they
can
be
replicate
across
the
system
.
every
child
at

should
have
access
to

industrial
engagement
in

all
of
this
inhabit
the
educational

regard
the
legislation
,
section

will
insert
a

of
"

to

this
amendment
be
necessary
to
enable
Science
Foundation
Ireland
to
support
apply
research
,
as
well
as
continue
to
support
orient
basic
research
.
the
other
amendment
to
section
3
will
help
to
refocus
the
foundation
's
effort
in
area
of
opportunity
by
add
the
term
"
strategic
area
of
opportunity
for
the
State
"
.
this
revise
definition
relate
to
the
revision
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
function
provide
for
in
section
4
.
the
amendment
relate
to
strategic
area
of
opportunity
will
allow
for
Science
Foundation
Ireland
to
realign
its
programme
portfolio
in
line
with
the
recommendation
arise
from
the
national
research
prioritisation
steering
group
,
which
be
chair
by
Mr.
Jim
O'Hara
,
formerly
of
Intel
.
the
group
identify
14
priority
area
of
opportunity
for
Ireland
and
six
underpin
technology
and
infrastructure
.
to
support
this
priority
area
on
the
basis
of
exist
strength
of
the
enterprise
base
,
opportunity
in
the
global
market
place
and
that
most
likely
to
deliver
economic
and
societal
impact
and
,
ultimately
,
job
,
the
government
approve
the
recommendation
arise
from
the
group
's
recommendation
.
the
aim
be
to
align
the
majority
of
public
sti
investment
with
14
area
of
opportunity
identify
in
the
report
,
as
well
as
the
underpin
technology
and
infrastructure
.
the
report
also
acknowledge
the
important
role
of
research
for
policy
and
research
for
knowledge
,
and
recommend
the
remain
funding
be
channel
to
support
this
two
area
.
a
number
of
measure
be
also
recommend
to
improve
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
sti
system
.
it
be
in
the
context
that
the
Bill
provide
for
the
refocusing
of
the
research
theme
to
be
fund
by
the
SFI
towards
the
priority
area
of
opportunity
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
in
speak
of
the
importance
of
education
.
without
wish
to
be
pedantic
,
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
reasonably
clear
.
nevertheless
,
I
note
the
point
the
Senator
make
on
the
importance
of
the
teaching
role
and
function
in
education
.
this
area
be
also
part
of
current
deliberation
in
the
restructuring
of
high
education
and
its
teacher
training
component
.
should
I
speak
to
the
amendment
give
that
the
Senator
propose
to
withdraw
it
?
I
do
not
support
the
amendment
.
the
main
purpose
of
section
7
(
1
)
(e
)
be
to
ensure
a
co-ordinate
approach
to
research
among
body
in
the
State
by
extend
the
scope
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
consultation
to
body
anywhere
.
the
amendment
would
dilute
this
purpose
and
could
increase
cost
.
on
amendment
no.

,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
objective
be
,
as
set
out
in
the
legislation
,
to
promote
and
assist
the
development
and
competitiveness
of
industry
,
enterprise
and
employment
in
the
State
.
it
be
fund
by
the
State
through
the
Department
's
vote
.
the
purpose
of
the
power
of
the
minister
to
issue
direction
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
be
to
specify
particular
action
relate
to
the
carry
out
by
the
foundation
of
its
function
in
line
with
this
objective
and
ensure
public
funding
be
use
in
accordance
with
this
objective
.
allow
external
body
to
influence
this
policy
direction
would
not
be
appropriate
.
I
note
Senator
Barrett
's
reference
to
consultation
with
learn
society
such
as
the
Royal
Irish
Academy
and
Royal
Dublin
Society
.
while
I
do
not
wish
to
be
facetious
,
there
be
a
number
of
learn
society
,
include
many
with
the
designation
"
Royal
"
.
this
long
list
include
the
Royal
Academy
of
Medicine
in
Ireland
,
the
Royal
Anthropological
Institute
of
great
Britain
and
Ireland
,
the
Royal
College
of
Surgeons
,
the
Royal
College
of
physician
,
the
Royal
Geological
Society
of
Ireland
,
the
zoological
Society
of
Ireland
,
chartered
Accountants
Ireland
,
the
honorable
Society
of
King
's
Inns
,
the
Irish
Association
of
Physicist
in
Medicine
,
the
Irish
record
Music
Association
and
the
Irish
Texts
Society
.
while
I
be
aware
the
Senator
be
not
be
prescriptive
,
the
role
of
determine
science
policy
be
predicate
on
a
stakeholder
engagement
.
last
year
the
Royal
Irish
Academy
host
a
good
seminar
on
prioritisation
and
its
impact
.
the
Irish
Research
Council
have
a
strong
role
in
the
humanity
and
social
science
.
in
shape
any
new
strategy
on
science
,
technology
and
innovation
,
I
must
have
a
clear
vision
,
follow
the
prioritisation
exercise
,
that
proceeding
with
a
new
strategy
for
the
country
require
a
clear
role
for
the
high
education
institute
and
all
funder
of
research
in
the
Irish
landscape
.
we
must
also
pay
due
regard
to
the
institution
to
which
the
Senator
refer
.
however
,
for
the
reason
I
have
outline
,
we
should
not
be
prescriptive
in
term
of
how
Science
Foundation
Ireland
conduct
its
business
give
that
the
prioritisation
be
only
one
proportion
of
expenditure
on
research
in
the
country
as
a
whole
.
I
be
not
sure
I
agree
with
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
.
this
process
on
prioritisation
and
this
legislation
be
not
about
propagate
a
system
,
rather
it
be
about
create
a
new
system
.
the
legislation
be
design
in
the
first
instance
to
create
more
job
and
in
the
second
to
create
a
system
of
knowledge
that
can
be
support
.
it
be
eminently
sensible
that
the
government
via
the
taxpayer
would
prioritise
that
area
.
there
be
a
number
of
institution
relate
to
the
research
landscape
in
this
country
,
for
example
,
transport
,
as
mention
by
the
Senator
.
it
be
not
true
to
say
that
the
transport
community
be
not
in
some
way
,
shape
or
form
consult
in
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
for
example
,
the
core
issue
in
respect
of
priority
area
K
,
which
relate
to
smart
grid
and
smart
city
,
be
transport
in
large
urban
conurbation
such
as
Dublin
,
Cork
or
Limerick
.
work
in
the
research
community
around
this
challenge
be
ongoing
.
there
be
no
reason
the
discipline
of
economics
cannot
map
onto
any
area
of
the
research
landscape
.
it
be
for
the
economist
who
be
house
within
the
individual
high
education
institution
to
think
more
laterally
about
how
they
can
engage
with
other
entity
and
research
cluster
in
term
of
the
creation
of
a
impact
around
that
.
what
we
be
try
to
do
be
to
force
the
breakdown
of
silo
from
a
interdepartmental
point
of
view
.
for
instance
,
we
have
have
some
measure
of
success
through
the
creation
of
a
health
innovation
hub
in
Cork
.
there
be
ongoing
engagement
between
the
Department
of
Health
and
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
on
how
to
push
further
innovation
through
that
demonstrator
model
.
Ireland
be
a
small
community
and
it
be
now
time
for
people
who
traditionally
operate
within
they
own
landscape
or
silo
to
consider
how
they
can
collaborate
and
create
new
area
of
opportunity
in
term
of
how
they
carry
out
they
research
.
there
be
nothing
prevent
they
do
so
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
provide
opportunity
in
its
output
statement
for
people
across
the
research
landscape
.
where
good
idea
,
which
potentially
have
a
economic
and
societal
impact
become
apparent
,
there
will
be
a
mechanism
for
they
.
it
be
for
the
researcher
to
start
think
more
laterally
about
how
they
engage
.
there
be
a
challenge
for
researcher
within
the
community
.
this
section
provide
Science
Foundation
Ireland
with
the
power
to
devise
and
administer
research
grant
scheme
use
fund
authorise
and
provide
by
the
minister
with
the
agreement
of
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
I
consider
the
propose
amendment
as
tab
by
Senator
Barrett
unnecessary
as
all
public
body
be
require
to
comply
with
public
financial
procedure
which
be
aim
at
ensure
the
most
effective
use
possible
of
public
fund
.
there
be
rigorous
examination
in
the
annual
estimate
programme
of
all
area
of
expenditure
and
the
Oireachtas
have
significant
involvement
in
this
process
.
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
.
it
be
clear
that
research
be
deliver
.
more
and
more
of
we
foreign
direct
investment
win
be
predicate
on
the
research
and
development
infrastructure
available
in
this
country
.
the
Irish
medical
device
sector
be
rank
ninth
of
ten
in
the
world
.
the
number
of
social
media
and
ICT
related
company
locate
here
and
the
performance
of
we
research
and
development
sector
during
the
past
decade
have
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
economy
.
as
part
of
the
national
research
prioritisation
exercise
,
which
involve
all
state
funder
of
research
come
together
,
we
must
now
measure
that
impact
,
which
be
vital
in
term
of
ensure
transparency
for
the
taxpayer
in
the
context
of
the
research
we
choose
to
fund
.
I
accept
the
Senator
's
point
,
but
it
raise
the
issue
of
the
culture
surround
high
education
institution
and
ask
whether
this
be
a
matter
for
that
institution
in
term
of
they
contractual
arrangement
with
employee
.
I
agree
that
this
issue
need
to
be
raise
.
it
be
not
strictly
within
the
remit
of
this
legislation
but
I
will
undertake
to
discuss
it
further
with
the
Senator
at
a
future
date
,
give
the
fact
that
it
have
be
raise
in
the
House
.
in
March
2012
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
transfer
responsibility
for
delivery
of
the
discover
science
and
engineering
,
dse
,
programme
from
Forfás
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
on
a
administrative
basis
.
since
its
establishment
in
2003
,
the
programme
have
be
actively
work
with
company
and
high
education
institution
as
well
as
representative
body
,
such
as
Engineer
Ireland
,
to
heighten
awareness
of
science
and
engineering
and
to
raise
the
level
of
student
uptake
of
the
physical
science
at
second
and
third
level
.
the
programme
also
run
a
range
of
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
,
stem
,
initiative
at
primary
level
.
the
objective
of
the
dse
programme
be
to
promote
awareness
and
understanding
of
the
importance
of
STEM
,
to
increase
the
number
of
student
study
the
physical
science
and
mathematics
,
to
promote
a
positive
attitude
to
career
in
STEM
and
to
foster
a
great
public
understanding
of
the
physical
science
,
engineering
and
mathematics
and
they
value
to
Irish
society
.
there
be
many
synergy
and
mutual
complementarity
between
the
programme
and
SFI
,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
outreach
programme
run
through
SFI
-
fund
research
centre
.
the
transfer
underpin
by
this
Bill
will
enable
synergy
between
the
programme
and
SFI
funding
to
be
maximise
,
will
increase
the
programme
's
impact
and
will
further
enhance
SFI
's
science
outreach
activity
.
include
subparagraph
(
iii
)
of
amendment
no.
12
would
be
superfluous
,
as
specify
in
legislation
the
recipient
of
funding
through
SFI
's
awareness
programme
be
unnecessary
.
if
only
certain
potential
recipient
of
funding
be
identify
,
it
would
raise
question
as
to
the
eligibility
of
other
body
.
we
can
accept
subparagraph
(
iv
)
of
the
amendment
in
principle
.
I
agree
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
SFI
to
consult
,
as
appropriate
,
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
where
SFI
's
activity
in
a
area
be
relevant
to
that
department
.
however
,
I
propose
to
insert
the
amendment
in
subparagraph
(
i
)
,
as
set
out
in
amendment
no.
11
.
Subaragraph
(
v
)
appear
to
dilute
the
Bill
's
objective
of
enable
SFI
to
support
stem
awareness
.
it
also
may
go
beyond
the
scope
of
SFI
's
function
.
I
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
sentiment
express
by
the
Senator
.
it
be
important
to
state
for
the
record
that
the
Department
have
,
via
a
tender
win
by
the
National
Centre
for
Excellence
in
Mathematics
and
Science
Teaching
and
learning
,
NCE
-
MSTL
,
out
of
the
University
of
Limerick
and
NUIG
,
spend
more
than
€
2
million
in
the
past
year
through
a
professional
diploma
,
which
be
be
deliver
as
we
speak
,
for
out
-
of
-
field
math
teacher
.
there
be
a
clear
recognition
by
the
Department
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
we
have
a
coterie
of
teacher
who
be
properly
skilled
in
STEM
.
I
refer
briefly
to
the
recent
TIMMS
and
PIRLS
result
,
which
map
out
literacy
,
numeracy
and
scientific
skill
among
a
fourth
class
coterie
at
primary
school
level
.
that
result
clearly
show
that
in
the
area
of
literacy
we
be
do
very
well
and
that
we
be
above
average
in
the
area
of
mathematics
and
science
,
but
my
vision
be
that
we
could
do
much
well
.
my
personal
vision
be
that
I
would
like
to
see
the
teacher
education
college
-
which
be
go
through
a
restructuring
process
,
which
be
ongoing
at
high
education
level
-
devise
programme
with
master
's
in
stem
education
or
stem
advocate
which
could
be
create
at
primary
school
level
,
perhaps
at
district
level
.
we
could
engage
,
for
instance
,
the
people
who
roll
out
SciFest
.
I
take
the
point
that
be
make
that
there
be
a
annual
pilgrimage
to
the
RDS
and
the
Young
Scientist
Exhibition
have
do
marvellous
work
in
raise
the
people
's
consciousness
about
science
but
there
be
other
player
in
that
field
such
as
SciFest
.
this
be
where
industry
have
a
role
to
play
in
raise
awareness
and
consciousness
around
the
need
to
ensure
we
have
advocate
for
science
at
primary
level
.
we
need
to
start
think
of
more
long
-
term
objective
as
well
,
instead
of
the
five
-
year
electoral
cycle
.
my
vision
be
that
we
move
into
five
-
year
,
ten
-
year
and
15
-
year
horizon
.
if
we
start
to
look
at
primary
school
now
in
term
of
the
way
stem
education
be
teach
,
we
will
see
the
long
-
term
result
of
that
in
due
course
.
we
be
conscious
of
this
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
,
technically
speak
,
this
be
in
the
area
of
education
and
would
be
do
through
the
high
education
strategy
,
which
be
a
function
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
it
be
in
that
context
,
although
I
agree
with
the
sentiment
express
,
that
I
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
accept
the
amendment
.
I
state
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
that
SFI
's
objective
be
as
set
out
in
the
legislation
,
to
promote
and
assist
the
development
and
competitiveness
of
industry
,
enterprise
and
employment
in
the
State
.
it
be
fund
by
the
State
through
the
Department
's
vote
.
the
power
of
the
minister
to
issue
direction
be
for
the
purpose
of
specify
particular
action
related
to
the
carry
out
by
SFI
of
its
function
in
line
with
this
objective
and
to
ensure
that
public
funding
be
use
in
accordance
with
this
objective
.
allow
external
body
to
influence
this
policy
direction
would
not
be
appropriate
.
I
agree
with
the
sentiment
of
the
amendment
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
and
in
term
of
change
or
evolve
the
remit
of
SFI
,
I
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
accept
it
.
I
address
this
point
in
my
last
intervention
where
I
speak
about
the
power
of
the
minister
to
issue
direction
.
that
be
for
the
purpose
of
specify
particular
action
.
the
direction
relate
to
general
policy
.
I
do
not
think
that
we
be
be
in
any
way
draconian
in
that
sense
.
there
be
a
strong
culture
in
this
country
of
successive
government
,
regardless
of
they
political
hue
,
have
endeavour
to
engage
with
stakeholder
in
this
area
.
I
point
to
the
evidence
of
the
research
prioritisation
steering
group
where
we
ask
Mr.
Jim
O'Hara
to
chair
that
process
.
we
bring
in
all
the
State
's
funder
of
research
and
that
in
industry
and
academia
-
a
myriad
of
people
involve
in
this
area
.
we
try
to
arrive
at
the
good
policy
outcome
through
a
process
of
stakeholder
engagement
.
it
be
important
to
state
the
power
of
the
minister
give
the
democratic
mandate
that
he
or
she
or
the
government
have
.
it
be
not
heavy
-
handed
or
draconian
to
state
SFI
be
fund
through
the
Department
's
vote
and
,
in
that
sense
,
must
be
direct
ultimately
by
the
will
of
the
people
.
therefore
,
I
would
not
support
the
acceptance
of
the
amendment
.
SFI
's
objective
be
set
out
in
legislation
and
it
be
design
to
promote
and
assist
the
development
and
competitiveness
of
industry
,
enterprise
and
employment
in
the
State
,
and
that
be
a
worthy
endeavour
.
a
thorough
reading
of
the
research
prioritisation
steering
group
document
will
reveal
a
clear
statement
about
research
for
knowledge
and
for
policy
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
be
not
the
only
game
in
town
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
be
one
of
a
number
of
research
funder
within
the
State
.
there
be
entity
like
the
Health
Research
Board
,
the
High
Education
Authority
,
Teagasc
,
the
Irish
Research
Council
and
other
such
body
.
it
be
important
that
we
have
perspective
.
research
for
knowledge
be
a
key
component
of
government
policy
and
that
be
embed
in
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
steering
group
documentation
.
it
be
a
fundamental
principle
and
there
be
no
move
away
from
that
.
there
be
also
a
adherence
to
the
idea
that
if
research
do
not
measure
up
to
excellence
,
have
no
impact
or
be
find
to
be
futile
and
go
nowhere
,
there
will
be
enough
people
within
the
system
and
externally
,
who
will
measure
its
impact
and
if
it
be
deem
not
to
be
fit
for
purpose
the
State
can
roll
back
its
investment
in
specific
area
.
this
be
not
write
on
tablet
of
stone
.
no
research
community
in
the
world
,
where
the
state
have
a
active
part
to
play
,
be
so
inflexible
that
it
will
continue
to
research
in
area
where
it
be
clear
that
there
be
no
economic
or
societal
impact
or
where
the
research
do
not
measure
up
to
the
principle
of
excellence
.
I
can
understand
where
Senator
Barrett
be
come
from
.
he
speak
about
the
enhancement
of
knowledge
in
the
wide
society
.
it
be
not
only
take
as
a
give
that
we
be
try
to
enhance
knowledge
.
it
be
set
out
clearly
in
the
documentation
relate
to
the
prioritisation
exercise
.
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
whatsoever
.
I
always
accept
the
Senator
's
intervention
in
the
spirit
in
which
he
make
they
.
we
must
be
clear
,
however
.
prioritisation
be
not
the
entire
funding
game
.
there
be
a
myriad
of
source
.
if
the
principle
of
excellence
be
adhere
to
and
impact
measure
there
should
be
no
reason
any
researcher
who
be
do
excellent
research
with
impact
within
Irish
society
could
not
derive
funding
from
some
source
.
I
wonder
if
some
of
the
researcher
who
have
approach
Senator
Barrett
or
be
write
letter
to
the
Irish
Times
or
tweet
on
this
issue
have
read
the
steering
group
document
.
the
document
be
give
birth
to
14
action
plan
and
the
13
systemic
change
that
be
necessary
.
the
document
also
contain
a
chapter
give
example
of
policy
research
.
this
example
include
climate
change
,
related
environmental
research
,
bio-energy
,
population
health
research
and
health
service
research
.
that
be
mere
example
.
there
be
a
funding
mechanism
for
everybody
,
so
long
as
the
research
measure
up
to
the
principle
of
excellence
and
impact
.
the
late
€
60
million
round
of
investment
funding
announce
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
two
week
ago
include
many
recipient
of
funding
who
be
carry
out
orient
basic
research
.
there
be
clear
evidence
of
that
across
a
myriad
of
landscape
which
map
on
to
prioritisation
,
but
more
than
€
2
million
be
give
to
MACSI
,
a
pure
mathematics
entity
operate
out
of
the
University
of
Limerick
.
if
we
be
imaginative
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
continue
to
fund
such
researcher
.
they
need
to
start
think
more
laterally
about
engage
and
collaborate
in
a
interdisciplinary
fashion
,
think
about
they
own
output
as
it
stand
at
present
and
find
new
area
of
opportunity
for
themselves
.
some
of
they
need
to
read
the
documentation
before
make
false
assumption
.
I
say
this
with
respect
,
have
read
some
of
the
public
discourse
on
this
issue
.
the
section
amend
section
9
of
the
Industrial
Development
Act
1993
by
require
a
institution
engage
in
research
and
development
fund
wholly
or
partly
from
money
provide
by
the
Oireachtas
to
supply
information
to
Forfás
from
time
to
time
.
this
be
require
by
a
commission
regulation
relate
to
statistic
on
science
and
technology
.
Forfás
compile
datum
on
a
yearly
basis
regard
government
budget
appropriation
and
outlay
on
research
and
development
,
as
require
under
the
commission
regulation
,
and
the
Bill
provide
statutory
power
for
Forfás
to
collect
the
datum
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
comply
with
the
regulation
.
the
commission
regulation
have
recently
be
replace
by
a
new
regulation
but
retain
the
same
requirement
regard
the
collection
of
government
budget
appropriation
and
outlay
on
research
and
development
and
other
research
datum
.
the
amendment
reflect
the
new
regulation
.
I
thank
the
Member
for
the
time
afford
to
I
and
for
the
opportunity
to
debate
the
issue
.
I
be
grateful

the
insight
of
Senator
Barrett

tab
and
for

with
the
opportunity
to

the
current
position
on

the

have
apply

the
school

over
a

of
year
in
a
effort
to
identify
suitable
site
for
the
construction
of
permanent
accommodation
for
the

the

might
find
it
helpful
if
I
set
out
the
context
within
which
decision
relate
to
meet
the
demographic
challenge
face
the

system
in

-
more
than
45,000
at

and
25,000
at

level
.
to
ensure
that
every
child
have
access
to
a
physical
school
place
,
it
be
vital
that
there
be
sufficient
school
accommodation
available
to
cater
for
this
pupil
enrolment
.
the
delivery
of
building
project
to
meet
the
increase
demographic
demand
will
be
the
main
focus
for
capital
investment
over
the

in

in

,
Kinsale
have
not

for

.
official
from
the
Department
's
building
unit
meet
with
Summercove
school
authority
in
January
2013
,
as
Senator
O'Donovan
explain
,
to
explore
the
option
that
might
be
open
to
the
school
to
improve
its
exist
accommodation
.
subsequently
,
a
member
of
the
Department
's
technical
staff
visit
the
school
to
examine
the
possibility
of
address
the
school
's
most
urgent
need
.
however
,
the
option
of
provide
some
permanent
accommodation
to
replace
the
school
's
temporary
accommodation
and
to
address
traffic
management
on
the
site
do
not
appear
possible
due
to
the
restrict
nature
of
the
site
.
the
Department
accept
therefore
that
a
new
site
be
require
.
however
,
give
the
need
to
meet
demographic
growth
,
the
delivery
of
new
school
,
together
with
extension
project
to
meet
future
demand
will
be
the
main
focus
of
the
Department
's
budget
for
the
come
year
.
in
this
regard
,
it
be
not
possible
to
indicate
at
this
point
when
a
building
project
for
the
school
will
be
progress
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
allow
I
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
position
.
I
appreciate
where
Senator
O’Donovan
be
come
from
.
it
do
I
no
good
to
say
that
a
school
in
my
own
county
cannot
have
a
definitive
timeframe
for
the
provision
of
a
new
school
.
the
government
be
face
with
Hobson
's
choice
at
the
moment
because
demographic
do
come
into
play
.
we
be
now
face
with
a
situation
in
this
country
where
there
be
pocket
in
metropolitan
and
urban
area
where
school
place
will
not
be
available
in
the
future
.
one
must
make
provision
in
constrain
economic
time
to
allow
for
the
necessity
of
people
to
be
able
to
go
to
school
.
that
be
the
Hobson
's
choice
that
face
we
.
I
be
willing
to
speak
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
about
the
issue
again
.
I
be
aware
of
the
history
of
the
case
,
date
back
to
1999
,
and
some
of
the
difficulty
that
arise
between
some
of
the
State
agency
involve
.
it
be
not
possible
at
this
stage
to
state
exactly
when
a
new
school
will
be
build
.
one
could
argue
that
we
be
put
it
on
the
long
finger
.
I
accept
the
point
that
have
be
make
against
the
government
but
it
must
prioritise
that
area
where
school
place
will
not
be
available
and
make
provision
for
they
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
.
the
question
pose
by
she
as
to
whether
there
be
any
plan
to
introduce
legislation
to
tackle
high
price
charge
by
trader
in
this
jurisdiction
as
compare
with
price
charge
in
the
neighbour
UK
jurisdiction
seem
to
presume
that
price
control
measure
can
protect
consumer
from
what
may
be
perceive
as
high
or
unjustified
price
.
in
so
far
as
the
general
issue
of
tackle
high
price
be
concerned
,
price
control
measure
be
not
a
effective
means
of
reduce
price
.
during
the
1970
and
1980
price
control
be
use
as
one
of
the
primary
tool
for
combate
increase
consumer
price
and
inflation
.
various
analysis
of
that
period
have
show
that
price
control
be
a
ineffective
way
of
tackle
high
price
,
as
in
many
instance

the
result
that

in

to
fail
to

also
effectively

from

it
be
for
that
reason
that
the
consumer
Protection
Act
2007
essentially
repeal
the
legislation
which
allow
for
price
control
and
there
be
no
plan
to
revisit
the
matter
.
as
regards
differential
in
price
for
goods
in
this
jurisdiction
when
compare
with
price
in
the
neighbour
UK
jurisdiction
,
there
can
be
legitimate
reason
for
price
to
differ
,
such
as
exchange
rate
movement
,
different
distributional
cost
,
etc
.
notwithstanding
this
,
I
do
not
doubt
there
may
be
instance
where
the
level
of
the
differential
in
price
charge
for
the
same
goods
in
the
two
jurisdiction
cannot
be
justify
by
reason
such
as

movement
.
in
such
instance
,
it
be
important
that
consumer
use
they
discretion
.
I
read
the
article
to
which
the
Senator
refer
and
it
be
interesting
to
note
a
comment
make
by
Mr.
Mark
Gould
of
MG
Consulting
who
state
:
everyone
be
on
the
web
,
you
can
see
what
a
retailer
be
charge
in
Britain
versus
the
Republic
,
so
why
everyone
have
not

to
that
transparency
I
do
not
really
understand
.
retailer
that
get
catch
on
this
only
have
themselves
to
blame
.
we
all
have
access
to
the
Internet
and
consumer
can
exercise
they
power
.
they
price
sensitivity
can
determine
purchase
behaviour
,
particularly
as
it
relate
to
conspicuous
consumption
.
in
contrast
to
the
price
control
era
of
the
1970
and
the
1980
,
government
policy
in
the
area
of
price
have
be
focus
on
the
promotion
of
competition
and
consumer
awareness
,
give
that

more

.
in
so
far
as

consumer
awareness
of

concerned
,
the
consumer
Protection
Act
2007
specifically
mandate
the
National
consumer
Agency
to
promote
public
awareness
and
conduct
public
information
campaign
on
issue
such
as
price
.
the
agency
have
be
very
active
in
raise
awareness
of
price
in
a
number
of
different
area
.
evidence
available
to
it
show
that
consumer
be
become
more
price
conscious
and
change
they
shopping
habit
to
achieve
good
value
for
they
money
.
it
be
the
case
,
therefore
,
that
competition
and
price
awareness
among
consumer
be
more
effective
tool
to
tackle
high
price
than
the
price
control
policy
of
the
past
.
as
regards
general
price
trend
,
the
consumer
price
index
publish
by
the
Central
Statistics
Office
show
that
price
in
Ireland
rise
by
1.2
%
in
the
12
month
to
January
2013
,
whereas
the
corresponding
index
in
the
UK
,
the
retail
price
index
,
show
that
price
there
increase
by
3.3
%
in
the
same
period
.
at
the
European
level
,
the
harmonise
index
of
consumer
price
,
which
be
the
accept
measure
for
compare
price
trend
across
the
European
Union
,
show
that
price
in
Ireland
increase
by
1.7
%
in
2012
as
compare
with
a
increase
of
2.3
%
across
the
Union
and
2.7
%
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
in
the
same
period
.
I
be
firmly
of
the
view
that
consumer
,
by
exercising
the
power
they
command
,
be
well
place
to
ensure
they
get
a
fair
deal
than
any
legislative
intervention
that
would
seek
to
regulate
the
price
trader
charge
for
goods
and
service
.
accordingly
,
by
inform
themselves
as
to
the
different
offering
in
the
marketplace
and
be
strategic
in
they
shopping
decision
,
consumer
can
help
to
ensure
they
achieve
the
good
value
for
they
money
,
which
be
all
the
more
important
in
the
current
economic
climate
.
I
note
the
article
in
the
Sunday
Business
Post
of
24
February
state
that
a
shift
dress
on
sale
in
the
monsoon
chain
be
price
at
£
129
in
Britain
,
which
convert
to
just
under
€
150
,
whereas
the
Irish
price
be
€
199
.
the
word
"
shift
"
in
Cork
parlance
have
completely
different
connotation
.
perhaps
the
Senator
will
enlighten
I
on
the
matter
afterwards
.
I
thank
Senator
Higgins
for
raise
this
matter
and
convey
the
minister
's
regret
that
he
cannot
attend
this
debate
in
person
.
to
set
the
context
,
the
position
be
that
payment
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
under
the
agri-environment
option
scheme
,
or
AEOS
as
it
be
commonly
know
,
be
well
advance
at
this
stage
.
before
discuss
the
detail
,
I
emphasise
the
commitment
of
the
minister
and
government
to
the
agri-environment
scheme
,
namely
,
AEOS
and
the
rural
environmental
protection
scheme
,
as
operate
by
the
Department
.
the
scheme
put
environmentally
friendly
farming
to
the
forefront
and
recognise
the
vital
role
farmer
play
in
deliver
public
goods
in
protect
the
environment
and
natural
heritage
for
the
benefit
of
society
as
a
whole
.
this
commitment
be
evident
in
the
fact
that
despite
serious
budgetary
pressure
face
he
Department
,
the
minister
open
AEOS
to
new
applicant
last
year
.
in
this
regard
,
a
additional
€
20
million
be
make
available
annually
for
five
year
to
fund
new
application
under
the
scheme
.
this
ongoing
commitment
be
also
evident
in
the
fact
that
more
than
€750
million
be
spend
by
the
Department
on
agri-environment
scheme
in
the
past
three
year
alone
,
with
a
further
€
200
million
available
in
2013
under
both
REPS
and
AEOS
.
there
be
currently
almost
30000
participant
in
reps
and
they
contract
will
continue
until
expiry
of
the
five
year
contract
period
in
each
case
.
the
successor
to
REPS
,
the
agri-environment
option
scheme
,
be
a
more
target
agri-environment
scheme
for
which
funding
be

as

that
have

the

approach
,
as
distinct
from
the
whole
farm
approach

under

.
it
consist
of
action
which
can
be
demonstrably
link
to
the
three
important
challenge
target
.
there
be
approximately
15000
participant
in
AEOS
1
and
2
,
which
be
open
to
new
participant
in
2010
and
2011
,
respectively
.
the
EU
regulation

the
scheme
and
other
area

scheme
require
that
a
full
and
comprehensive
administrative
check
,
include
cross-check

,
be
complete
before
any

previous

make
it
clear
that

must
be

all

this

be
a
significant
administrative

albeit
one
that
the

the
current

additional

have

the

in

approximately
1000
farmer
have

of

a

high

on
the

as
I
have
mention
,
AEOS

the
end
of

the
funding
of
€
20
million

that
the

have
provide
will
allow
for
approximately
4000
new

the

be
currently
process
the

with
a
view
to

approval
in
the
next
few
week
.
it
be
expect
that

will
commence
towards
the
end
of
the
year
.
I
reaffirm
the
government
's
commitment
to
the
agri-environment
scheme
.
the
minister
be
at
all
time
conscious
of
the
importance
of
the
payment
to
farmer
's
income
.
he
ask
I
to
convey
that
he
will
ensure
that
he
Department
continue
to
make

with

Cathaoirleach
's
permission
,
I
welcome
the

I
thank
the
Member
for
they
constructive
and
positive
approach
to
the
consideration
of
this
Bill
.
to
preface
my
report
to
the
House
on
the
two
amendment
make
to
the
Bill
by
Dáil
Éireann
,
which
be
group
together
for
the
purpose
of
this
debate
,
I
will
note
briefly
that
the
principal
change
extend
the
remit
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
through
this
legislation
relate
back
to
section
7
of
the
Industrial
Development
(
Science
Foundation

)
Act
2003
.
the
latter
deal
with
the
function
of
SFI
and
set
out
the
strategic
scientific
area
in
which
it
be
require
to
operate
.
while
section
4
of
the
Bill
provide
for
a
number
of
amendment
to
SFI
's
function
,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
to
extend
the
foundation
's
remit
to
enable
it
to
fund
apply
research
in
addition
to
its
exist
remit
to
fund
orient
basic
research
.
two
amendment
be
accept
in
Dáil
Éireann
in
respect
of
section
4
of
the
Bill
,
which
amend
section
7
(
1
)
(
gram
)
of
the
principal
act
.
a
entirely
new
provision
be
be
introduce
to
enable
SFI
to
fund
research
aim
at
enhance
the
evidence
base
for
the
effectiveness
of
its
investment
.
in
this
context
,
section
7
(
1
)
(
gram
)
,
as
originally
frame
,
provide
for
SFI
to
undertake
:
(
i
)
the
development
of
research
to
assess
the
impact
of
research
activity

or
partly
by
the
Foundation
,
(
ii
)
the
assessment
of
research
activity
fund
wholly
or
partly

the
Foundation
.
the
amendment
accept
in
Dáil
Éireann
introduce
the
word
"

publication
"
into
both
sub-clause
,
thereby
provide
for
the
publication
of
the
finding
of
any
such
research
the
foundation
conduct
into
the
impact
of
its
research
activity
.
the
two
amendment
present
no
difficulty
because
publication
of
such
research
finding
be
always
intend
and
so
both
be
accept
.
that
Senator
who
be
familiar
with
the
operation
of
SFI
will
be
aware
that
it
be
a
very
open
and
progressive
organisation
that
regularly
publish
a

of
the

who
have
be
unavoidably
detain

the
availability
of

a

I
preface
my
remark
by
say
I
know
my
good
neighbour
in
County
Kerry
to
be
a
neighbourly
and
affable
bunch
.
one
would
never
be
stuck
for
a
lift
to
any
part
of
the
county
at
any
give
time
of
the
day
or
night
.
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Defence
,
deputy
Alan
Shatter
,
be
unable
to
be
here
and
have
ask
I
to
convey
he
thanks
to
the
Senator
for
raise
the
matter
.
as
the
Senator
may
be
aware
,
under
the
provision
of
the
Court
Service
Act
1998
,
management
of
the
court
be
the
responsibility
of
the
Court
Service
.
the
1998
Act
provide
that
the
Court
Service
be
independent
in
the
performance
of
its
function
,
which
,
of
course
,
include
the
provision
,
maintenance
and
management
of
court
building
.
decision
about
court
venue
be
entirely
a
matter
for
the
Court
service
board
and
the
minister
have
no
role
in
the
decision
.
in
the
current
financial
climate
,
the
service
have
be
oblige
to
review
all
aspect
of
its
organisational
and
operational
structure
throughout
the
country
with
the
specific
objective
of
ensure
that
it
can
continue
to
maintain
the
delivery
of
front
-
line
court
service
and
a
appropriate
level
of
service
to
court
user
.
the
minister
have
be
inform
that
no
court
venue
have
be
single
out
or
indeed
exempt
from
the
review
process
.
a
comprehensive
review
of
all
venue
throughout
the
country
have
recently
be
complete
,
the
purpose
of
which
be
to
establish
a
general
framework
within
which
venue
could
be
consider
for
closure
take
into
account
a
range
of
criterion
such
as
case
load
,
proximity
to
a
alternative
venue
,
physical
condition
of
the
building
,
availability
of
hold
cell
facility
,
etc
.
the
likely
impact
on
other
justice
agency
,
such
as
a
Garda
Síochána
and
the
Irish
Prison
Service
,
be
also
take
into
account
.
the
minister
be
inform
that
the
review
identify
a
range
of
venue
nationwide
,
which
,
base
on
the
criterion
apply
,
could
be
consider
for
closure
subject
to
a
detailed
assessment
and
the
preparation
of
a
business
case
in
respect
of
each
identify
venue
.
since
its
establishment
in
1999
,
the
Court
Service
have
amalgamate
nearly
160
venue
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
service
have
benefit
from
a
very
substantial
capital
investment
to
upgrade
court
accommodation
around
the
country
.
the
policy
have
be
very
successful
,
result
in
a
more
efficient
use
of
time
for
the
Judiciary
,
court
user
and
gardaí
.
rather
than
short
sitting
in
the
small
venue
,
a
full
day
's
list
can
be
deal
with
which
lead
to
reduction
in
delay
in
the
District
Court
.
the
Senator
have
inquire
,
in
particular
,
about
courthouse
in
County
Kerry
.
the
Court
Service
have
inform
I
that
Kenmare
,
Cahersiveen
,
Killorglin
and
Dingle
have
be
identify
as
venue
to
be
consider
for
closure
subject
to
a
detailed
assessment
and
the
preparation
of
a
business
case
as
mention
early
.
Standard
courthouse
requirement
include
basic
facility
such
as
consultation
room
,
victim
support
facility
and
hold
cell
for
prisoner
which
be
essential
to
ensure
public
safety
and
efficient
use
of
Irish
Prison
service
resource
.
the
Senator
should
note
that
the
service
have
advise
that
the
identification
of
venue
as
part
of
the
review
process
do
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
identify
venue
will
close
,
as
each
identify
venue
will
be
subject
to
a
rigorous
examination
.
the
Court
Service
board
will
take
no
decision
on
the
future
of
Kenmare
,
Cahersiveen
,
Killorglin
and
Dingle
as
District
Court
venue
without
full
prior
consultation
with
local
interested
party
and
court
user
.
the
minister
have
be
advise
that
the
consultation
on
the
identify
venue
be
under
way
.
submission
be
seek
from
a
range
of
local
interest
and
the
closing
date
for
receipt
of
submission
be
25
September
2013
.
the
Court
Service
have
indicate
that
it
have
meet
local
interested
party
and
the
service
have
assure
the
minister
that
the
view
express
in
the
consultation
process
will
be
take
into
account
in
the
decision
-
making
process
.
as
I
mention
,
the
final
decision
on
the
closure
of
any
venue
be
a
matter
for
the
board
of
the
Court
Service
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
matter
and
appreciate
he
interest
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
County
Kerry
.
I
know
the
Senator
will
understand
the
need
for
the
Court
service
to
take
the
necessary
measure
to
promote
great
efficiency
in
the
court
and
hope
the
constructive
engagement
involve
the
Court
service
will
result
in
reasoned
and
appropriate
decision
be
make
on
the
venue
concerned
.
I
acknowledge
the
statement
of
the
Senator
.
if
we
be
to
make
statement
in
public
fora
such
as
this
,
we
should
try
to
extrapolate
a
little
more
from
the
datum
.
the
datum
go
back
to
2006
and
suggest
some
3000
house
do
not
have
access
to
a
motor
vehicle
.
we
can
extrapolate
from
they
the
number
of
people
who
will
present
before
the
justice
system
and
it
would
be
fair
to
say
the
figure
would
be
minuscule
,
but
if
they
do
have
to
present
at
a
venue
which
be
a
little
further
away
,
to
reiterate
a
early
point
I
make
,
I
imagine
they
access
to
justice
would
not
be
prevent
in
any
way
.
I
imagine
the
neighbourly
people
of
County
Kerry
would
facilitate
they
in
any
way
they
could
.
as
I
have
state
,
the
Court
Service
operate
independently
and
make
independent
decision
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
Court
Service
have
identify
venue
which
should
be
consider
,
as
the
Senator
have
outline
,
but
subject
to
a
detailed
assessment
and
the
preparation
of
a
business
case
.
the
response
I
be
give
from
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
be
clear
in
that
sense
.
I

Kerry
would
facilitate
they
in
any
way
they
could
.
as
I
have
state
,
the
Court
Service
operate
independently
and
make
independent
decision
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
Court
Service
have
identify
venue
which
should
be
consider
,
as
the
Senator
have
outline
,
but
subject
to
a
detailed
assessment
and
the
preparation
of
a
business
case
.
the
response
I
be
give
from
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
be
clear
in
that
sense
.
I
acknowledge
the
statement
of
the
Senator
.
if
we
be
to
make
statement
in
public
fora
such
as
this
,
we
should
try
to
extrapolate
a
little
more
from
the
datum
.
the
datum
go
back
to
2006
and
suggest
some
3000
house
do
not
have
access
to
a
motor
vehicle
.
we
can
extrapolate
from
they
the
number
of
people
who
will
present
before
the
justice
system
and
it
would
be
fair
to
say
the
figure
would
be
minuscule
,
but
if
they
do
have
to
present
at
a
venue
which
be
a
little
further
away
,
to
reiterate
a
early
point
I
make
,
I
imagine
they
access
to
justice
would
not
be
prevent
in
any
way
.
I
imagine
the
neighbourly
people
of
County
Kerry
would
facilitate
they
in
any
way
they
could
.
as
I
have
state
,
the
Court
Service
operate
independently
and
make
independent
decision
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
Court
Service
have
identify
venue
which
should
be
consider
,
as
the
Senator
have
outline
,
but
subject
to
a
detailed
assessment
and
the
preparation
of
a
business
case
.
the
response
I
be
give
from
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
be
clear
in
that
sense
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
issue
.
a
flood
relief
scheme
for
the
town
of
Skibbereen
be
be
advance
by
Cork
County
Council
,
as
the
contracting
authority
,
in
partnership
with
the
OPW
,
which
be
provide
the
funding
.
the
development
and
progression
of
the
scheme
be
be
overseen
by
a
steering
committee
with
representative
of
the
council
,
the
OPW
and
RPS
,
the
engineering
consultant
for
the
scheme
.
a
public
exhibition
of
the
prefer
scheme
proposal
take
place
in
April
this
year
and
last
for
four
week
.
the
main
proposal
of
the
scheme
include
the
construction
of
new
wall
and
embankment
along
the
River
Ilen
and
some
of
its
tributary
in
the
town
,
new
pump
station
,
localised
channel
regrading
and
improvement
to
the
local
drainage
system
.
approximately
60
submission
be
receive
from
member
of
the
public
on
the
propose
scheme
during
the
exhibition
.
some
of
this
submission
raise
concern
over
the
level
of
protection
to
be
provide
in
certain
area
,
base
on
past
experience
of
local
people
.
the
OPW
and
Cork
County
Council
recognise
that
local
knowledge
can
make
a
valuable
contribution
to
fine
-
tuning
scheme
proposal
.
therefore
,
the
consultant
undertake
the
study
be
ask
to
undertake
further
survey
and
analysis
to
alleviate
the
concern
raise
at
the
exhibition
before
a
decision
could
be
make
regard
the
next
step
in
take
the
scheme
forward
.
this
survey
have
now
be
complete
and
some
change
have
be
make
to
the
propose
scheme
.
a
exhibition
report
which
will
deal
in
depth
with
all
the
issue
raise
by
each
submission
be
expect
to
be
complete
soon
.
when
that
report
have
be
receive
,
response
will
be
issue
by
the
OPW
to
all
party
who
make
submission
.
the
OPW
,
in
consultation
with
the
council
,
will
decide
on
the
appropriateness
of
move
forward
with
the
project
as
propose
.
it
be
expect
that
the
scheme
will
be
move
to
detailed
design
once
the
response
be
issue
.
it
be
envisage
that
the
detailed
design
process
will
commence
before
the
end
of
November
.
it
be
hope
to
complete
that
process
,
and
the
process
of
procure
a
civil
work
contractor
,
by
the
middle
of
next
year
.
this
would
allow
construction
to
commence
in
the
third
quarter
of
2014
.
to
mitigate
delay
on
the
scheme
,
the
OPW
and
Cork
County
Council
agree
early
this
year
to
bring
forward
the
site
investigation
work
in
advance
of
the
detailed
design
process
.
this
work
,
which
commence
in
September
,
be
due
for
completion
in
December
.
this
will
greatly
aid
the
progression
of
the
detailed
design
.
the
OPW
's
consultant
and
staff
from
Cork
County
Council
have
be
on
the
ground
collect
datum
from
the
flood
event
which
occur
on
24
and
25
October
.
when
all
the
datum
have
be
collect
,
they
will
need
to
be
analyse
.
while
it
be
possible
that
the
analysis
will
identify
issue
that
will
necessitate
some
modification
of
the
proposal
,
early
indication
suggest
that
no
significant
change
to
the
scheme
will
be
require
.
while
it
be
unfortunate
for
the
town
to
experience
this
late
flooding
event
,
the
datum
collect
should
bring
some
additional
certainty
regard
the
robustness
of
the
propose
scheme
that
will
be
undertake
in
the
come
year
.
I
be
pleased
to
confirm
that
the
OPW
have
make
provision
for
the
cost
of
implement
a
scheme
in
Skibbereen
in
its
financial
profile
for
the
2014
-
16
period
.
I
look
forward
to
the
work
commence
towards
the
end
of
next
year
.
I
sympathise
with
what
Senator
O'Donovan
have
say
about
the
hardship
this
have
cause
to
the
people
of
Skibbereen
.
as
I
come
from
Mallow
and
also
represent
Fermoy
and
Midleton
,
I
be
fully
cognisant
of
the
flooding
issue
local
people
have
have
to
endure
in
the
absence
of
a
flood
relief
scheme
.
I
assure
the
Senator
that
Skibbereen
will
benefit
from
the
scheme
as
soon
as
work
on
it
commence
.
Mallow
have
cease
to
have
instance
of
flooding
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Park
Road
area
,
which
do
not
have
any
resident
.
this
scheme
have
be
quite
successful
.
I
look
forward
to
a
successful
resolution
of
this
issue
also
.
I
thank
the
Senator
.
the
Central
Bank
be
responsible
for
the
regulation
and
supervision
of
credit
union
.
that
role
include
the
implementation
of
resolution
action
under
the
Central
Bank
and
credit
Institution
(
Resolution
)
Act
2011
,
where
require
.
on
13
January
2012
,
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
secure
a
high
court
order
for
the
appointment
of
a
special
manager
to
Newbridge
credit
Union
.
further
high
court
application
be
make
to
extend
the
term
of
appointment
of
the
special
manager
,
the
late
be
in
June
2013
.
high
court
order
be
secure
for
a
six
-
month
extension
period
on
each
occasion
.
the
special
manager
appointment
be
make
because
of
Central
Bank
concern
about
the
high
level
of
loan
loss
incur
by
the
credit
union
which
impact
on
the
level
of
its
reserve
.
there
be
also
concern
about
some
of
the
lending
make
,
which
go
beyond
the
traditional
type
of
lending
normally
provide
by
credit
union
.
the
extent
of
the
problem
at
Newbridge
mean
that
it
be
not
sustainable
for
it
to
continue
as
a
stand
-
alone
entity
.
as
a
resolution
case
with
financial
difficulty
and
viability
concern
,
it
also
do
not
meet
the
statutory
condition
for
stabilisation
support
.
the
Central
Bank
undertake
a
process
under
the
Central
Bank
and
credit
Institution
(
Resolution
)
Act
2011
involve
the
examination
of
possible
combination
with
other
credit
union
.
it
be
in
the
context
of
this
process
that
the
Naas
proposal
come
on
to
the
table
.
it
be
important
to
set
out
the
minister
's
role
in
this
process
.
the
Central
Bank
have
the
statutory
role
of
"
resolution
authority
"
under
the
2011
Act
.
the
role
of
the
minister
under
this
process
be
essentially
twofold
.
first
,
consultation
with
the
minister
be
a
requirement
under
the
intervention
condition
.
this
mean
that
the
minister
be
consult
in
respect
of
the
special
management
order
and
the
associate
extension
but
do
not
provide
for
the
minister
to
have
a
decision
-
make
role
or
a
veto
.
the
minister
would
also
be
a
consultee
in
respect
of
any
propose
transfer
order
.
second
,
in
the
event
that
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
request
the
payment
of
a
incentive
for
a
transfer
,
the
minister
's
approval
be
need
for
the
Central
Bank
to
provide
that
financial
incentive
from
the
resolution
fund
.
senator
will
appreciate
that
,
notwithstanding
the
extent
of
media
coverage
on
the
situation
,
the
Central
Bank
process
remain
subject
to
strict
confidentiality
requirement
under
the
high
court
order
and
the
act
.
that
confidentiality
restriction
apply
equally
to
the
minister
as
it
do
to
other
party
and
,
therefore
,
there
be
a
limit
to
what
the
minister
be
permit
to
say
on
the
matter
.
however
,
I
want
to
take
the
opportunity
to
emphasise
once
again
that
the
minister
's
core
objective
be
to
ensure
that
member
's
savings
be
protect
notwithstand
the
extent
of
the
very
real
problem
of
Newbridge
credit
Union
.
this
will
be
the
first
case
where
the
taxpayer
be
be
call
upon
to
cover
the
loss
at
a
credit
union
and
to
ensure
that
member
's
savings
will
be
protect
.
the
money
will
come
from
the
resolution
fund
to
which
the
government
have
contribute
€
250
million
of
taxpayer
's
money
,
which
be
recoupable
over
time
from
credit
institution
via
a
levy
.
the
minister
be
fully
aware
of
the
strength
of
feel
locally
about
the
situation
at
Newbridge
credit
Union
,
which
have
also
be
raise
by
public
representative
in
recent
month
.
the
minister
meet
the
Newbridge
Action
Group
on
19
September
to
hear
its
concern
about
the
process
and
to
afford
the
group
a
opportunity
to
outline
its
alternative
proposal
.
follow
that
meeting
,
the
agree
next
step
be
for
the
Newbridge
Action
Group
to
submit
its
proposal
to
the
minister
expeditiously
.
as
agree
at
the
meeting
with
the
action
group
,
on
receipt
of
its
alternative
proposal
,
the
minister
forward
it
to
Professor
Honohan
,
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
,
with
a
view
to
a
meeting
between
the
Central
Bank
and
the
action
group
.
this
be
now
a
matter
for
the
Central
Bank
and
I
understand
the
meeting
with
the
group
take
place
last
week
.
the
Central
Bank
continue
to
work
under
the
provision
of
the
high
Court
Order
and
the
act
to
bring
a
conclusion
to
the
intervention
at
Newbridge
.
the
focus
of
the
minister
in
he
limited
role
under
the
act
be
to
secure
the
protection
of
member
's
savings
and
he
have
encourage
the
Central
Bank
to
progress
this
issue
with
a
view
to
a
expeditious
conclusion
.

I
cannot
over
-
emphasise
how
important
it
be
as

it
be
a
exciting
collaboration

throughout

.
science

have
become
a
important
event
in
many
people
's
calendar
and
it
be
truly
inspirational
to
see
the
number
who
turn
out
and
support
all
of
the

each

and
it
be
they
dedication
and

that
make
the

the
success
that
it
be
.
this

there
be
new

a

evidence
from
research
carry

by

,
now
the

,
suggest
the
18
-
24
year
age
cohort
still
do
not
consider

interesting
.
last
year
science
week
set
out
to
change
that
perception
and
follow
on
,
like
for
like
research
show
that
among
that
age
group
interest
have
increase
by
7
%
in
science
and
8
%
in

.
most
of
we
child
's
career
opportunity
will
be
build
around
harness
new
and
evolve
technology
that
be
only
now
establish
themselves
.
it
be
critically
important
that
we
give
student
a
window
into
this
industry
and
the
experience
of
people
work
in
they
.
it
be
also
vital
that
we
ensure
student
be
engage
in
science
and
scientific
thinking
at
a
early
age
.
we
must
continue
to
encourage
young
school
student
to
engage
with
scientific
learning
and
thinking
which
,
in
turn
,
will
encourage
they
to
consider
study
stem
subject
at
second
and
third
level
.
science
week
serve
as
a
magnet
that
continue
to
attract
inquire
young
student
to
the
world
of
science
and
it
stimulate
they
awareness
of
the
many
possibility
and
pathway
that
study
in
this
area
will
offer
they
.
therefore
,
I
urge
all
Senator
to
check
out
scienceweek
.ie
and
attend
or
promote
as
many
event
as
possible
.
not
only
will
they
be
pleasantly
surprise
by
the
huge
voluntary
effort
that
have
go
into
the
organisation
of
the
week
,
but
I
also
guarantee
that
they
will
,
as
I
have
do
,
learn
and
be
entertain
at
the
same
time
.
I
be
already
on
a
bed
of
nail
.
may
I
clarify
something
?
I
do
not
quite
understand
what
the
Senator
be
refer
to
when
he
speak
about
some
people
be
one
page
ahead
of
other
.
I
will
endeavour
to
respond
in
the
good
way
I
can
to
the
point
raise
.
I
genuinely
acknowledge
the
contribution
of
my
fellow
member
of
the
Oireachtas
.
hopefully
I
will
be
able
to
respond
,
and
if
I
be
not
,
member
should
not
hesitate
to
follow
up
with
I
.
Senator
Mary
White
refer
to
a
dual
education
system
,
and
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
the
point
she
make
.
the
example
of
the
University
of
Limerick
be
the
good
national
example
of
industry
engagement
by
undergraduate
where
accreditation
be
give
to
the
student
for
participation
in
industry
,
enterprise
or
on
a
community
basis
.
that
model
should
be
replicate
.
other
university
or
institute
of
technology
should
take
it
as
a
example
.
it
be
for
university
to
do
so
,
but
I
be
in
favour
of
the
model
.
I
will
contact
Senator
Deirdre
Clune
about
a
review
of
the
ICT
action
plan
after
two
year
.
I
want
to
give
a
accurate
picture
of
it
.
the
same
apply
to
the
PhD
candidate
to
whom
Senator
Clune
refer
.
a
PhD
candidate
be
a
student
,
technically
speak
,
and
I
be
happy
to
liaise
with
the
Senator
on
that
issue
.
I
agree
with
Senator
Feargal
Quinn
on
the
potential
of
the
agricultural
and
food
sector
.
it
be
one
of
the
14
sector
outline
early
.
we
be
look
at
food
,
food
innovation
and
,
particularly
,
food
for
health
.
Teagasc
and
SFI
have
sign
a
memorandum
of
understanding
to
try
to
leverage
new
opportunity
within
the
sector
,
something
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
Coveney
,
and
I
sign
off
on
some
time
ago
.
it
present
a
opportunity
in
term
of
mapping
area
opportunity
onto
the
food
sector
and
the
agricultural
sector
.
this
be
particularly
true
in
respect
of
ICT
and
dairy
expansion
,
where
the
employment
of
new
ICT
technology
will
be
necessary
for
success
.
that
be
where
we
see
a
natural
synergy
between
SFI
and
Teagasc
.
with
regard
to
gmo
,
research
on
genetically
modify
organism
be
already
be
carry
out
by
Teagasc
.
a
potato
trial
be
under
way
within
Teagasc
.
at
this
juncture
,
if
we
look
at
the
trend
in
term
of
global
population
growth
,
we
must
be
pragmatic
about
the
approach
we
take
.
I
be
express
a
personal
opinion
.
sometimes
the
issue
of
GMO
get
tangle
up
with
the
biotechnology
company
and
the
control
of
seed
and
intellectual
property
.
we
must
have
a
rational
and
reasonable
debate
on
the
issue
in
a
proper
forum
,
devoid
of
some
of
the
emotion
that
exist
around
the
topic
.
I
would
welcome
a
rational
,
coherent
and
objective
debate
.
there
be
potential
for
map
ICT
onto
agriculture
and
develop
high
-
end
food
product
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
probiotic
and
functional
food
.
the
taxpayer
,
through
SFI
,
have
fund
a
alimentary
pharma-biotic
centre
in
Cork
through
Professor
Fergus
Shanahan
,
who
be
refer
to
by
Senator
O'Keeffe
.
last
week
,
Professor
Shanahan
be
nominate
as
researcher
of
the
year
.
that
be
the
kind
of
excellence
in
research
that
we
be
carry
out
in
the
area
of
food
,
and
it
will
map
onto
dairy
expansion
and
the
potential
of
the
agricultural
economy
.
we
recognise
its
importance
.
the
feedback
on
Science
Week
will
be
about
capture
what
the
broadcaster
and
researcher
Aoibhinn
Ní
Shúilleabháin
call
the
Zeitgeist
.
she
call
this
a
Zeitgeist
space
where
learning
take
place
,
through
event
such
as
Science
Week
,
for
parent
and
teacher
as
well
as
for
the
child
and
student
involve
.
it
be
about
implant
new
idea
in
teacher
to
apply
some
of
the
learning
from
individual
event
in
the
classroom
.
in
term
of
feedback
,
the
expectation
be
that
teacher
will
take
something
from
the
event
and
implant
that
learning
in
the
teaching
experience
within
the
classroom
.
there
be
no
reason
,
in
the
current
system
,
they
can
not
do
so
.
the
topic
of
religion
in
school
concern
management
and
patronage
structure
.
it
be
arguably
for
a
board
of
management
to
determine
the
particular
etho
of
the
school
.
that
be
why
,
in
certain
instance
,
religion
become
a
important
topic
,
depend
on
the
etho
in
a
school
.
I
agree
that
we
need
more
primary
school
teacher
engage
with
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
subject
at
primary
school
.
we
must
help
teacher
.
all
too
often
,
it
be
easy
to
be
critical
of
teacher
and
say
that
they
spend
too
much
time
teach
English
or
art
and
not
enough
time
on
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
subject
.
we
must
create
a
supportive
framework
for
teacher
and
give
they
the
tool
to
do
so
.
Senator
Thomas
Byrne
refer
to
physical
science
and
hard
science
.
look
at
the
result
in
physics
and
chemistry
,
one
can
see
there
be
no
difference
between
the
gender
at
national
level
.
with
regard
to
the
school
in
question
,
I
do
not
know
the
fact
of
the
situation
,
but
I
imagine
it
may
be
a
geographical
issue
or
a
localised
issue
.
there
be
opportunity
for
people
to
be
teach
physics
or
chemistry
no
matter
where
they
be
in
the
country
.
if
there
be
exception
,
I
would
like
to
hear
about
it
.
it
may
be
a
local
variation
.
if
we
examine
the
breakdown
of
physics
and
chemistry
in
the
leave
certificate
,
we
find
that
,
broadly
speak
,
there
be
no
gender
imbalance
.
I
be
happy
to
talk
to
the
Senator
about
that
point
.
I
be
delighted
to
meet
Senator
Colm
Burke
at
the
medical
research
charity
group
conference
this
morning
.
we
be
a
small
country
and
we
be
still
borrowing
more
than
€
1
billion
per
month
.
it
be
not
possible
for
a
small
country
in
this
economically
constrain
time
to
try
to
be
all
thing
to
all
people
in
term
of
we
research
funding
.
it
be
appropriate
to
smartly
specialise
in
a
area
in
which
we
can
get
a
societal
and
economic
return
.
person
may
have
a
rational
critique
of
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
,
but
I
do
not
believe
they
cannot
be
fund
through
other
source
if
they
feel
they
be
leave
outside
of
the
process
.
there
be
source
of
funding
other
than
research
prioritisation
.
in
the
health
area
,
in
drug
synthesis
and
drug
formulation
,
Ireland
be
invest
heavily
through
the
solid
state
pharmaceutical
centre
,
SSPC
,
cluster
at
the
University
of
Limerick
,
which
bring
in
the
pharmaceutical
company
so
vital
to
we
industrial
landscape
.
we
be
partner
with
they
through
SFI
to
examine
the
concept
of
manufacturing
from
molecule
to
medicine
,
as
the
saying
go
.
we
must
be
smart
about
how
we
specialise
.
drug
discovery
be
a
area
of
importance
.
we
recognise
that
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
emphasis
on
this
,
we
will
be
move
towards
a
manufacturing
and
processing
synthesis
crystallisation
space
.
we
be
absolutely
right
to
prioritise
in
that
area
.
there
be
comment
about
0
%
corporation
tax
.
consider
the
foreign
direct
investment
win
we
have
have
in
2012
,
approximately
45
%
be
predicate
on
research
and
development
.
I
have
a
open
mind
on
the
corporate
tax
rate
and
,
as
a
minister
of
State
,
that
type
of
designation
be
probably
beyond
my
pay
grade
.
we
should
debate
the
matter
and
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
Senator
Barrett
on
how
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
be
utilise
.
the
last
budget
set
down
clear
marker
on
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
designation
and
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
.
Senator
Crown
mention
religion
and
I
speak
about
governance
in
response
to
that
.
science
be
a
core
subject
,
which
I
agree
with
,
and
the
metric
would
probably
indicate
that
science
be
teach
at
post
-
primary
level
in
approximately
85
%
to
90
%
of
school
.
I
could
stand
to
be
correct
on
the
exact
percentage
,
and
although
it
be
a
option
,
science
be
still
take
by
the
vast
majority
of
student
right
up
to
leave
certificate
level
.
I
agree
with
the
Senator
that
this
be
about
people
have
a
basic
conceptual
understanding
of
science
because
of
its
translational
impact
across
a
number
of
sector
,
include
solicitor
and
the
other
profession
mention
.
I
agree
with
the
Senator
's
comment
about
a
core
module
.
I
do
not
see
how
the
junior
cycle
could
not
provide
for
that
kind
of
model
,
especially
in
short
course
,
and
junior
cycle
student
on
short
course
should
be
engage
in
that
kind
of
scientific
inquiry
.
the
idea
might
be
grow
from
the
conceptual
perspective
of
"
put
the
finger
on
the
hot
plate
"
,
as
people
should
have
such
a
conceptual
understanding
of
scientific
endeavour
.
there
would
be
a
important
outcome
for
people
downstream
in
term
of
how
they
grow
,
effectively
,
as
people
.
with
regard
to
the
food
space
,
the
Alimentary
Pharmobiotic
Centre
in
Cork
be
work
with
Teagasc
,
and
it
be
one
of
the
foremost
probiotic
research
entity
in
the
world
.
it
carry
out
research
on
functional
food
,
gut
health
and
map
the
gut
"
genome
"
.
Ireland
be
at
the
forefront
of
that
scientific
endeavour
,
and
downstream
permutation
will
include
medicinal
potential
for
food
as
a
delivery
mechanism
.
that
be
long
-
term
thinking
,
with
people
like
Professor
Fergus
Shanahan
lead
that
kind
of
research
.
I
will
never
forget
the
name
Nicholas
Callan
as
long
as
I
live
.
the
next
time
I
step
on
the
locomotive
to
Mallow
or
into
the
car
,
I
will
be
think
of
Reverend
Professor
Nicholas
Callan
.
I
take
that
as
a
learning
point
and
acknowledge
the
comment
of
Senator
Moran
in
that
respect
.
Senator
Barrett
always
provoke
challenging
thought
and
I
like
come
to
the
Seanad
because
it
facilitate
such
debate
.
Senator
Barrett
draw
on
the

analogy
with
regard
to
Project
Maths
and
the
State
be
expend
considerable
resource
on
bring
teacher
of
mathematics
-
out
of
field
math
teacher
-
through
a
professional
diploma
which
be
be
deliver
by
the
National
Centre
for
Excellence
in
Mathematics
and
Science
Teaching
and
learning
,
in
collaboration
with
other
entity
like
the
National
University
of
Ireland
,
Galway
.
we
have
invest
heavily
in
bring
in
that
teacher
and
the
taxpayer
be
fund
this
professional
diploma
in
order
to
upskill
the
teacher
and
enable
they
to
teach
mathematics
at
post
-
primary
level
.
I
would
be
very
surprised
if
the
vast
majority
of
teacher
graduate
from
that
course
would
not
leap
-
frog
some
of
the
exist
pure
mathematics
teacher
in
the
system
.
that
may
sound
controversial
but
it
be
what
the
evidence
indicate
,
although
we
have
not
yet
have
a
full
analysis
of
how
the
course
pan
out
.
in
fairness
to
teacher
in
the
post
-
primary
sector
,
they
have
have
to
embrace
serious
challenge
in
deal
with
project
Maths
and
some
of
the
teacher
have
be
resistant
to
it
.
I
be
confident
that
give
the
right
level
of
continue
professional
development
and
support
for
that
teacher
,
as
well
as
introduce
the
out
of
field
mathematics
teacher
into
the
equation
,
some
of
the
issue
with
the
State
Examination
Commission
will
be
solve
.
everybody
acknowledge
the
turmoil
create
but
we
must
still
acknowledge
that
project
Maths
be
still
in
its
early
day
,
so
there
be
work
to
be
do
.
there
be
still
pocket
of
resistance
by
some
teacher
involve
with
Project
Maths
and
we
be
try
to
work
with
they
as
good
we
can
in
order
to
get
through
the
exist
issue
,
recognise
the
challenge
they
face
.
a
teacher
have
to
go
from
"
chalk
and
talk
"
base
on
a
model
of
past
paper
to
a
process
of
collaborative
problem
solve
with
student
,
and
some
teacher
may
have
be
teach
for
20
or
25
year
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
such
a
change
can
be
difficult
for
teacher
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
can
get
through
that
challenge
and
I
acknowledge
the
point
.
I
do
not
agree
with
the
Senator
's
comment
about
a
culture
of
amateurism
.
he
be
speak
specifically
about
pyrite
issue
and
so
forth
.
I
will
stand
up
for
the
official
with
whom
I
interface
in
the
public
service
on
a
daily
basis
.
one
can
consider
the
negotiation
around
Horizon
2020
,
and
although
they
have
political
leadership
,
the
team
on
the
working
group
be
all
public
official
.
this
be
civil
servant
who
do
a
excellent
job
in
negotiate
this
programme
on
behalf
of
Ireland
.
I
know
the
Senator
be
not
paint
with
a
broad
brush
with
regard
to
public
administration
but
sometimes
we
must
acknowledge
that
there
be
excellent
people
within
we
public
administration
who
have
a
very
strong
sense
of
policy
outcome
and
deliver
base
on
government
objective
,
etc
.
I
do
not
know
if
I
miss
a
issue
when
the
Senator
mention
the
culture
of
amateurism
,
and
I
stand
to
be
correct
if
I
have
miss
a
point
.
some
45
%
of
we
foreign
direct
investment
win
last
year
be
predicate
on
research
and
development
.
the
challenge
for
we
be
to
start
examine
the
primary
school
system
now
to
ensure
we
can
have
a
throughput
.
there
be
intermediate
measure
at
post
-
primary
level
,
and
I
argue
there
be
a
certain
responsibility
on
high
education
institution
to
start
remodelling
how
they
offer
particular
course
.
perhaps
there
be
a
onus
on
the
institution
to
consider
the
possibility
of
more
industrial
engagement
by
undergraduate
.
if
that
be
do
there
will
be
a
positive
consequence
on
the
number
of
people
stay
here
rather
than
emigrate
,
and
particularly
with
people
under
24
who
be
freshly
graduate
.
at
this
stage
,
if
that
people
have
some
sort
of
industrial
experience
or
could
interface
with
industry
in
some
way
at
a
undergraduate
level
,
receive
accreditation
for
they
effort
,
many
might
take
up
opportunity
at
a
early
career
stage
.
I
remain
open
to
challenge
on
that
point
also
at
some
stage
.
I
do
not
agree
with
the
Senator
.
I
have

comprehensively
the
widespread
consultation
that
take
place
with

amendment
no.
1
provide
that
a
company
be
to
be
treat
as
a
small
company
if
it
qualify
as
a
small
company
for
the
most
recent
financial
year
end
before
the
application
for
examinership
.
under
section
8
of
the
company
(
amendment
)
act
1986
a
company
qualify
as
a
small
company
if
it
meet
the
qualifying
condition
in
respect
of
a
financial
year
.
in
the
Bill
,
as
initiate
,
the
subsection
do
not
reflect
that
and
refer
instead
to
"
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
of
the
petition
"
.
there
be
no
reference
to
a
financial
year
.
I
will
respond
first
to
Senator
Sean
D.
Barrett
's
remark
and
thank
he
for
he
kind
word
of
welcome
.
the
cost
of
a
examinership
will
depend
not
only
on
the
capitalisation
or
book
value
of
the
asset
of
a
company
but
also
on
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
company
's
liability
and
the
complexity
of
a
particular
case
.
hence
,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
estimate
the
cost
of
a
typical
examinership
on
which
to
base
annual
estimate
of
savings
.
to
draw
robust
estimate
would
require
information
from
the
individual
company
who
apply
for
circuit
Court
examinership
and
require
they
to
estimate
the
savings
from
choose
the
circuit
Court
option
over
the
high
court
route
.
this
would
be
a
hypothetical
exercise
and
necessarily
subjective
.
to
compel
company
to
co-operate
in
such
a
process
would
require
legislation
,
which
would
also
add
to
the
administrative
burden
on
company
.
as
the
House
may
be
aware
,
stand
order
141a
of
the
Dáil
provide
that
12
month
after
the
enactment
of
a
Bill
,
the
minister
or
Minister
of
State
,
who
be
officially
responsible
for
implementation
of
a
act
,
shall
provide
a
report
,
which
shall
review
the
functioning
of
the
act
and
which
shall
be
lay
in
the
Oireachtas
Library
.
a
report
on
the
implementation
of
the
Bill
before
the
House
today
will
be
require
12
month
after
its
enactment
.
therefore
,
the
amendment
be
not
practical
or
necessary
and
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
it
.
other
Senator
speak
about
the
cost
of
legal
service
and
the
top
four
that
Senator
Denis
O'Donovan
mention
.
notwithstanding
the
valid
point
make
,
I
respectfully
suggest
that
this
issue
should
be
deal
with
under
the
legal
Service
Regulation
Bill
,
which
be
before
the
Dáil
.
I
note
the
point
make
and
they
will
certainly
be
reflect
back
to
the
relevant
minister
.
I
return
to
my
response
to
the
amendment
.
the
30
%
figure
mention
in
public
discourse
on
the
issue
refer
to
the
estimate
circuit
Court
cost
be
30
%
low
than
a
examinership
process
through
the
high
Court
owe
to
the
legal
fee
element
.
if
we
do
not
know
how
many
company
will
go
into
examinership
from
today
and
12
month
hence
,
how
can
we
reasonably
expect
to
create
a
estimate
of
the
cost
save
?
it
be
a
hypothetical
exercise
.
while
greatly
respect
the
Senator
's
view
on
the
issue
,
we
would
create
a
enormous
administrative
burden
-
another
administrative
layer
-
in
compile
the
estimate
.
know
the
Senator
as
I
do
,
I
know
he
would
not
stand
over
create
another
administrative
layer
in
the
system
that
would
result
in
Department
go
out
to
individual
company
which
apply
for
circuit
Court
examinership
and
then
put
a
requirement
on
they
to
estimate
the
savings
from
choose
one
court
over
another
.
in
a
individual
company
's
case
it
would
mean
in
practical
term
that
company
have
to
get
two
separate
piece
of
legal
advice
which
would
create
a
administrative
burden
for
it
.
it
be
not
reasonable
to
compel
company
to
engage
in
such
a
exercise
because
we
would
need
to
create
a
legislative
framework
for
that
.
furthermore
,
as
I
have
say
in
the
response
,
a
report
on
the
functioning
of
the
act
will
need
to
be
compile
and
lay
in
the
Oireachtas
Library
,
which
should
be
sufficient
.
the
estimate
savings
of
30
%
derive
from
the
potential
difference
in
the
legal
cost
between
the
circuit
Court
and
a
high
court
.
that
be
where
that
figure
come
from
.
I
respect
the
Senator
's
view
on
the
issue
,
but
the
government
be
unable
to
accept
the
amendment
.
this
amendment
relate
to
the
power
of
seizure
.
it
be
more
of
a
semantic
explanation
.
the
new
section
will
provide
for
a
officer
of
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
to
be
able
to
take
over
the
statutory
duty
set
out
under
section
20
(
2e
)
and
20
(
2f
)
of
the
company
Act
1990
in
circumstance
where
the
incumbent
designate
officer
be
no
long
in
a
position
to
carry
they
out
.
the
duty
under
section
20
(
2e
)
and
20
(
2
F
)
arise
if
a
name
officer
of
the
director
have
be
issue
with
a
section
20
search
warrant
under
which
"
extend
power
of
seizure
"
be
exercise
.
the
propose
new
section
will
provide
that
if
a
designate
officer
name
in
a
search
warrant
have
cease
to
be
a
officer
of
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
or
be
otherwise
unable
to
act
,
then
another
designate
officer
may
apply
to
a
judge
of
the
District
Court
for

first
,
let
I
speak
on
the
amendment
before
we
and
be
clear
about
the
government
's
position
on
it
.
other
point
have
be
make
by
Senator
Sean
D.
Barrett
and
we
could
have
a
very
long
debate
on
the
morass
in
society
.
I
do
not
think
it
be
only
the
accountant
who
be
part
of
the
morass
.
many
other
be
part
of
it
also
.
for
the
purpose
of
deal
with
some
of
the
point
the
Senator
raise
,
it
be
important
to
address
the
issue
in
relation
to
investigation
and
proceedings
against
particular
member
of
that
accountancy
body
.
investigation
and
proceedings
against
member
of
accountancy
body
in
relation
to
event
at
the
former
Anglo
Irish
Bank
be
suspend
at
the
request
of
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
in
order
that
such
move
would
not
prejudice
forthcoming
criminal
trial
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
in
response
to
quite
a
large
component
of
the
Senator
's
contribution
.
the
Senator
critique
section
6
in
its
entirety
,
but
that
section
give
effect
to
a
European
commission
recommendation
on
external
quality
assurance
for
statutory
auditor
and
audit
firm
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
may
have
address
this
issue
during
the
second
stage
debate
,
but
I
want
to
state
again
that
if
we
be
talk
about
quality
assurance
in
relation
to
section
6
,
it
be
important
we
note
that
quality
assurance
be
the
regular
inspection
of
statutory
auditor
and
audit
firm
to
ensure
system
be
in
place
that
will
allow
for
consistently
high
quality
audit
.
the
transfer
of
the
important
quality
assurance
function
to
a
independent
oversight
body
such
as
IAASA
will
strengthen
oversight
of
the
audit
process
in
Ireland
as
regard
this
public
interest
entity
.
this
should
help
to
restore
confidence
in
audit
in
Ireland
,
which
have
be
dent
as
a
result
of
the
so
-
call
clean
audit
opinion
give
to
the
financial
statement
of
systemically
important
credit
institution
,
which
as
the
Senator
rightly
point
out
,
late
prove
to
be
near
or
actually
insolvent
.
the
transfer
of
the
function
to
IAASA
be
to
be
fully
fund
by
the
relevant
statutory
auditor
and
audit
firm
with
no
cost
to
the
Exchequer
,
apart
from
once
-
off
start
-
up
cost
such
as
office
equipment
and
so
on
.
this
be
in
line
with
exist
practice
where
statutory
auditor
and
audit
firm
pay
for
this
function
.
the
only
difference
be
that
this
payment
will
be
to
IAASA
and
not
the
recognise
accountancy
body
of
which
they
be
a
member
.
the
cost
of
such
review
under
the
propose
system
be
likely
to
be
great
because
the
quality
assurance
process
will
be
more
thoroughgoing
than
heretofore
.
this
be
understand
not
to
be
a
difficulty
for
the
statutory
audit
firm
concerned
and
they
do
not
have
a
problem
with
it
.
if
IAASA
be
to
undertake
this
additional
quality
assurance
function
,
significant
additional
resource
will
be
require
by
that
entity
.
again
in
June
last
year
,
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation

to

of
Public

staff

Senator
Sean
D.
Barrett
refer
to
that
issue
.
I
hope
this
address
the
substantive
wording
of
the
amendment
as
propose
by
the
Senator
.
as
I
neglect
to
respond
to
Senator
Denis
O'Donovan

query
,
I
shall

the
matter

will

to

on

matter
?
I
thank
the
Senator
.
I
wish
to
clarify
that
the

will
not
be
accept
the

propose
by
Senator

Barrett
.
we
all
need
to
restore

the
point
make
by
the
Senator
be
necessary
and
we
be
try
to
restore
confidence
in
accounting
,
auditing
and
oversight
procedure
.
the
legislation
provide
that
the
IAASA
will
have
a
independent
oversight
of
the
process
which
be
a
step
towards
restore
confidence
.
we
need
to
ensure
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
the
quality
of
the
audit
and
that
they
stand
up
to
rigorous
and
independent
scrutiny
.
essentially
,
that
be
what
the

relationship
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
cannot
be
here
today
to
contribute
to
the
debate
as
he
be
on
a
important
trade
mission
to
India
.
he
send
he
apology
.
I
welcome
the
publication
of
the
committee
's
report
,
which
consider
a
wide
range
of
issue
and
make
a
series
of
13
recommendation
which
primarily
fall
for
consideration
by
two
minister
,
namely
,
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
and
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
as
the
report
itself
note
,
it
focus
on
four
key
area
.
this
be
the
propose
code
of
conduct
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
,
pricing
and
its
impact
on
primary
and
secondary
supplier
,
support
for
local
produce
,
and
labelling
.
in
my
contribution
I
will
concentrate
on
the
issue
of
regulate
certain
practice
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
,
which
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
I
will
also
briefly
address
some
of
the
issue
raise
in
the
report
relate
to
policy
responsibility
of
other
minister
,
namely
,
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
and
the
Minister
for
Health
.
the
government
be
strongly
of
the
view
that
it
be
important
to
ensure
there
be
a
balance
in
the
relationship
between
the
various
player
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
,
with
a
view
to
ensure
Ireland
continue
to
have
robust
agrifood
and
retail
sector
.
this
be
a
particular
priority
give
the
importance
of
this
sector
to
the
national
economy
.
regulation
of
certain
practice
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
be
intend
to
achieve
such
a
balance
,
take
into
account
the
interest
of
all
stakeholder
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
,
include
the
consumer
,
and
the
need
to
ensure
there
be
no
impediment
to
the
passing
on
of
low
price
to
consumer
.
as
the
joint
committee
's
report
note
,
the
issue
of
regulate
certain
practice
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
have
be
on
the
table
for
several
year
.
the
central
issue
have
be
the
question
of
whether
a
voluntary
code
of
conduct
be
require
or
,
on
the
other
hand
,
whether
a
statutory
response
should
be
pursue
.
view
differ
on
this
aspect
,
as
the
report
note
.
in
May
2011
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
publish
the
Traver
report
,
which
address
the
issue
of
attempt
to
seek
a
voluntary
code
of
conduct
.
the
report
find
that
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
likelihood
of
such
a
voluntary
code
be
agree
.
to
this
end
,
a
draft
statutory
code
of
conduct
be
prepare
as
the
basis
of
a
public
consultation
process
.
the
unlikelihood
of
a
voluntary
code
be
agree
be
also
recognise
by
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
to
regulate
-
I
emphasise
the
word
"
regulate
"
-
for
certain
practice
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
.
at
the
time
of
the
publication
of
the
Traver
report
,
the
minister
recognise
that
regulation
of
the
grocery
goods
sector
be
a
highly
contentious
issue
and
there
be
a
inevitable
strain
in
the
relationship
between
supplier
and
retailer
.
this
relationship
should
be
build
on
solid
principle
of
mutual
opportunity
and
fair
competition
,
which
do
not
always
happen
.
the
minister
express
he
disappointment
that
there
have
be
no
agreement
on
a
voluntary
code
,
regulation
by
government
be
always
the
option
of
last
resort
.
he
add
that
where
regulation
be
contemplate
,
it
should
be
forensically
design
to
avoid
unnecessary
cost
for
consumer
and
business
and
ensure
a
fair
balance
between
they
.
as
the
report
of
the
joint
committee
show
,
this
view
remain
as
valid
today
as
in
2011
.
the
committee
's
report
note
development
at
EU
level
on
the
issue
of
the
relationship
between
various
part
of
the
food
supply
chain
.
in
September
2013
,
a
voluntary
initiative
on
principle
of
good
practice
in
the
food
supply
chain
be
launch
and
adopt
by
certain
European
association
.
however
,
not
all
element
of
the
supply
chain
sign
up
to
this
initiative
,
mirror
the
different
view
on
the
value
of
a
voluntary
system
that
emerge
in
Ireland
from
the
Traver
report
process
.
in
a
parallel
exercise
,
the
European
Commission
publish
its
Green
Paper
on
unfair
Trading
practice
in
the
business
-
to
-
business
food
and
Non-Food
supply
chain
in
Europe
early
this
year
.
the
Commission
also
commence
a
public
consultation
process
to
gather
the
view
of
market
participant
on
the
occurrence
of
this
practice
,
they
possible
effect
and
the
most
effective
remedy
,
if
require
.
that
consultation
process
be
guide
by
a
range
of
question
to
respondent
,
include
query
as
to
whether
they
consider
unfair
trading
practice
to
be
pervasive
and
whether
there
be
consumer
detriment
in
the
presence
of
such
unfair
commercial
practice
.
give
the
diversity
of
respondent
involve
in
the
exercise
,
there
be
little
consensus
on
any
of
the
range
of
question
.
the
commission
be
consider
the
result
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
will
initiate
any
proposal
in
this
area
.
however
,
none
of
this
preclude
any
member
state
from
take
measure
it
consider
necessary
.
such
complementarity
between
EU
work
and
national
work
be
recognise
by
the
commission
.
obviously
,
we
will
all
take
a
interest
in
the
implementation
of
the
voluntary
initiative
and
the
impact
of
its
development
over
the
forthcoming
month
.
it
will
not
,
however
,
halt
the
implementation
of
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
.
to
give
effect
to
that
commitment
,
work
be
at
a
advanced
stage
on
the
draft
of
the
consumer
protection
and
competition
Bill
.
that
legislation
will
provide
for
the
amalgamation
of
the
Competition
Authority
and
the
National
consumer
Agency
,
implementation
of
the
recommendation
of
the
advisory
group
on
media
merger
,
and
amendment
to
both
competition
and
consumer
legislation
.
it
will
also
contain
enable
provision
to
allow
the
minister
to
regulate
certain
practice
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
.
it
be
hope
the
Bill
will
be
publish
by
the
end
of
the
year
for
debate
in
the
Oireachtas
in
early
2014
.
while
the
exact
wording
of
the
legislation
be
not
yet
be
agree
by
the
government
,
I
propose
to
address
several
of
its
propose
provision
that
be
germane
to
the
issue
raise
in
the
joint
committee
's
report
.
the
first
point
to
make
be
that
the
government
,
in
accordance
with
its
programme
for
government
commitment
,
will
not
be
legislate
for
a
voluntary
code
of
conduct
.
Statutory
regulation
of
certain
practice
will
be
introduce
.
although
not
finalise
,
it
be
likely
that
this
will
take
the
form
of
a
series
of
regulation
,
with
associate
sanction
,
rather
than
a
code
of
conduct
.
this
link
in
with
the
main
recommendation
of
the
committee
.
second
,
the
report
call
for
the
appointment
of
a
independent
ombudsman
to
oversee
and
enforce
the
regulation
.
as
the
House
will
appreciate
,
the
establishment
of
a
new
stand
-
alone
State
body
to
oversee
this
issue
would
,
in
the
current
economic
climate
,
not
be
feasible
for
reason
of
scarce
financial
resource
,
duplication
with
enforcement
of
exist
legislation
in
the
competition
(
amendment
)
act
2006
on
activity
that
prevent
,
restrict
or
distort
competition
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
,
and
the
need
to
ensure
there
be
no
unnecessary
proliferation
of
public
service
body
.
hence
,
as
have
already
be
note
in
previous
comment
on
this
matter
in
the
Oireachtas
,
the
amalgamate
Competition
Authority
and
National
consumer
Agency
,
NCA
,
will
be
the
independent
body
assign
the
responsibility
for
oversee
and
enforce
this
regulation
.
this
new
body
will
be
give
the
power
to
enforce
the
regulation
.
however
,
in
enforce
any
regulation
,
the
basic
tenet
of
fair
procedure
and
natural
and
constitutional
justice
must
be
upheld
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
introduction
of
any
regulation
do
not
,
and
cannot
,
guarantee
anything
regard
the
price
receive
by
any
give
link
in
the
supply
chain
.
negotiation
on
price
will
remain
a
issue
between
the
contracting
party
,
as
happen
in
any
commercial
relationship
.
the
intention
of
the
new
regulation
will
be
to
regulate
certain
practice
,
not
set
price
.
on
the
issue
of
disclosure
of
margin
by
retailer
,
the
content
of
the
financial
statement
of
company
be
govern
by
relevant
EU
company
law
directive
and
regulation
and
by
the
applicable
accounting
standard
.
the
requirement
regard
the
preparation
and
publication
of
the
account
of
limited
company
and
group
be
determine
by
the
first
,
fourth
and
seventh
EU
company
law
directive
and
by
the
EU
IFRS
regulation
.
this
requirement
be
largely
reflect
in
the
company
Act
1963
,
the
company
(
amendment
)
Act
1986
and
the
European
Community
(
company
:
Group
Account
)
regulation
1992
,
as
amend
.
the
EU
11th
company
law
directive
,
implement
as
the
European
Community
(
branch
Disclosures
)
Regulation
1993
,
address
the
requirement
applicable
to
branch
of
EEA
company
.
Irish
subsidiary
of
EEA
company
can
submit
the
audite
group
account
of
they
parent
to
the
Registrar
of
company
instead
of
they
own
individual
account
,
provide
certain
condition
be
meet
.
EEA
company
that
have
a
Irish
branch
be
require
to
submit
only
the
company
account
to
the
Registrar
of
company
.
Irish
company
that
be
subsidiary
of
EEA
company
and
which
be
themselves
parent
company
need
not
produce
consolidate
account
provide
certain
condition
be
meet
.
there
be
similar
provision
for
subsidiary
of
non-eea
company
.
in
such
case
the
consolidate
account
of
the
EEA
or
non-eea
group
must
be
submit
to
the
Registrar
of
company
.
there
be
no
plan
to
amend
this
disclosure
regime
in
respect
of
specific
sector
in
the
economy
as
this
would
be
open
to
accusation
of
discrimination
and
,
be
it
to
be
require
generally
in
the
economy
,
it
could
have
implication
in
term
of
business
cost
and
attract
foreign
direct
investment
.
most
of
the
other
issue
such
as
a
all
-
Ireland
market
for
contract
winter
milk
and
close
relationship
between
the
multiple
and
local
producer
be
policy
matter
for
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
.
however
,
on
the
first
point
,
I
understand
that
the
supply
of
milk
for
processing
,
North
or
South
,
be
be
monitor
with
the
ending
of
milk
quota
in
2015
.
on
the
second
point
,
I
understand
the
development
agency
have
be
active
in
promote
close
link
between
multiple
and
local
producer
.
on
the
issue
of
minimum
price
for
alcohol
,
the
House
will
be
aware
that
the
Minister
for
Health
have
propose
such
a
move
in
he
recent
initiative
on
the
issue
of
misuse
of
alcohol
.
the
Minister
for
Health
also
have
a
role
in
food
labelling
.
I
be
sure
both
minister
will
take
note
of
the
point
raise
today
in
respect
of
they
area
of
responsibility
.
I
look
forward
to
hear
the
reaction
of
the
House
to
the
report
and
its
view
on
its
recommendation
.
I
will
relay
this
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
on
he
return
from
India
to
allow
do
not
forget
the
cocoa
market
.
milk
,
chocolate
,
wine
and
rose
,
pink
lady
chocolate
-
where
do
I
start
?
I
have
to
declare
a
interest
.
I
have
taste
Senator
Mary
White
's
chocolate
and
recently
take
receipt
of
two
wonderful
box
of
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
's
chocolate
-----
-----
and
they
be
fantastic
.
I
will
go
through
the
issue
very
quickly
.
regulation
will
be
base
on
the
draft
code
publish
by
the
Minster
in
2011
.
the
main
issue
for
competition
in
the
grocery
goods
sector
be
entry
into
the
market
.
in
this
context
,
the
retail
planning
guideline
be
one
of
the
main
issue
identify
.
that
be
from
a
early
contribution
.
there
be
a
commitment
in
a
action
plan
for
Jobs
to
examine
consumer
price
issue
.
a
report
on
that
will
be
issue
by
Forfás
in
the
come
month
which
will
examine
the
reason
price
level
be
so
high
in
certain
area
within
the
market
.
the
EU
measure
be
a
voluntary
set
of
principle
,
not
a
code
.
they
be
adopt
in
September
2013
.
there
be
many
player
in
the
chain
who
have
not
sign
up
to
that
principle
,
which
be
similar
to
that
behind
the
draft
code
publish
by
the
minister
in
2011
.
if
a
retailer
or
a
supplier
be
not
engage
in
any
prohibitive
practice
,
they
will
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
new
regulation
.
the
issue
of
dominance
in
the
market
come
up
in
the
debate
.
dominance
in
the
market
be
not
illegal
but
a
abuse
of
that
dominance
be
illegal
.
I
listen
carefully
to
Senator
Feargal
Quinn
and
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
on
the
issue
of
hello
money
and
the
subtle
practice
around
try
to
get
a
product
place
on
the
shelf
.
we
all
appreciate
that
there
be
well
establish
practice
one
engage
in
when
one
try
to
get
a
product
onto
the
shelf
,
but
the
competition
(
amendment
)
act
2006
prohibit
hello
money
be
demand
.
Natural
justice
demand
,
however
,
that
defendant
hear
from
they
accusers
.
I
be
a
former
Labour
Party
spokesperson
on
agriculture
and
have
deal
with
the
issue
of
hello
money
and
sharp
practice
,
but
we
appear
to
have
a
culture
here
where
people
be
unwilling
to
challenge
the
type
of
paradigm
that
exist
regard
pressure
put
on
by
certain
multiple
.
if
it
be
happen
,
somebody
should
come
forward
.
there
be
legislation
to
deal
with
the
issue
but
until
somebody
come
forward
,
what
do
we
do
?
that
be
a
rhetorical
question
.
that
explain
the
issue
of
profit
in
respect
of
some
of
the
large
multiple
to
which
the
Senator
refer
.
it
be
well
know
that
some
large
retailer
be
private
company
and
be
not
cover
by
some
company
law
requirement
.
when
I
be
spokesperson
on
agriculture
,
I
regularly
meet
the
IFA
which
always
state
it
be
a
price
-
taker
.
the
IFA
be
the
most
powerful
lobby
in
this
country
and
I
have
always
fail
to
understand
how
it
be
a
price
-
taker
.
I
have
tell
the
current
and
previous
president
of
the
IFA
and
other
across
the
spectrum
that
I
do
not
understand
why
the
most
powerful
lobby
in
this
country
be
a
price
-
taker
for
the
purpose
of
its
interaction
.
I
understand
what
happen
inside
the
farm
gate
and
the
relationship
with
a
co-op
and
we
do
not
know
what
the
dynamic
of
the
market
will
be
after
2015
.
as
a
personal
opinion
,
I
imagine
that
price
level
will
rise
on
the
global
market
and
will
then
stream
off
but
I
imagine
there
will
be
arrangement
by
which
milk
producer
will
strike
a
price
with
they
individual
co-op
to
achieve
stability
within
the
price
range
for
a
guarantee
period
.
I
be
not
on
top
of
that
matter
as
we
speak
but
I
take
the
point
make
about
milk
.
I
pay
tribute
to
deputy
Andrew
Doyle
,
Chairman
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
because
the
committee
's
recommendation
no.
9
,
which
be
very
interesting
,
speak
to
a
all
-
Ireland
market
for
contract
winter
milk
and
that
should
be
encourage
.
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
Simon
Coveney
,
should
take
that
on
board
.
as
there
be
legislation
pend
in
this
area
my
official
who
be
here
and
I
will
take
on
board
the
point
make
today
,
and
the
issue
pertain
to
agriculture
and
the
food
sector
will
be
convey
to
the
minister
.
I
hope
I
have
interpret
correctly
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
's
point
about
the
nanny
state
.
I
agree
with
the
point
.
the
retail
sector
be
robust
and
if
one
have
a
good
product
it
will
make
it
onto
the
shelf
but
there
be
a
subtlety
about
how
that
happen
and
how
high
up
or
low
down
the
product
will
be
.
there
be
no
sharp
practice
there
.
we
all
understand
that
but
we
have
to
distinguish
between
that
practice
,
which
be
inherent
to
the
retail
trade
,
and
hello
money
.
I
have
not
even
begin
to
address
all
of
the
Senator
's
point
.
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
only
one
adjudicator
be
appoint
.
there
be
no
full
-
time
staff
,
the
staff
be
send
in
as
require
.
the
estimate
cost
be
€
5
million
and
I
understand
the
point
make
about
that
but
we
propose
include
the
role
within
the
new
nca
competition
area
and
there
will
be
a
suite
of
resource
available
to
enforce
the
role
as
require
.
on
the
issue
of
enforceability
abroad
,
this
apply
to
all
member
state
that
have
code
or
regulation
.
this
be
one
of
the
issue
raise
in
the
EU
Green
Paper
which
the
commission
be
consider
.
it
remain
to
be
see
how
that
will
emerge
because
I
understand
that
it
would
not
be
part
of
the
co-decision
procedure
but
will
be
a
function
of
whether
member
state
take
it
on
board
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
two
oppose
lobby
within
some
of
the
employer
and
business
representative
organisation
,
to
which
member
pay
subscription
.
there
be
no
specific
recommendation
on
own
brand
,
but
I
hail
from
a
town
that
be
once
the
bastion
of
the
Irish
sugar
industry
and
during
my
college
year
I
work
in
Irish
Sugar
.
I
recall
one
day
take
off
the
Irish
Sugar
label
,
place
it
on
the
ground
and
put
on
another
own
-
brand
label
.
the
price
differential
be
10
p
at
the
time
.
two
packet
of
the
same
product
sit
beside
each
other
in
the
same
shop
.
be
that
a
consumer
issue
?
be
it
a
marketing
issue
?
be
it
a
question
of
the
psychology
of
market
?
if
I
buy
a
packet
of
SuperValu
tea
it
be
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
brand
that
be
synonymous
with
Cork
.
do
that
come
off
the
same
line
?
I
do
not
know
.
as
a
consumer
,
I
be
conscious
of
it
,
that
be
the
point
I
be
make
.
Consumer
be
very
intelligent
about
they
choice
and
we
have
to
allow
for
that
dynamic
and
not
necessarily
legislate
for
it
.
that
be
a
personal
opinion
but
we
will
see
what
the
legislation
will
bring
.
I
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question
for
sure
,
but
to
the
good
of
my
knowledge
,
we
do

relevant
approve

for

process

one
of
three
new
debt
resolution
process
in
the

Act

,
subject
to
relevant
criterion
,
for
the
write
-
off
of
qualifying
debt
up
to
€
20000
,
subject
to
a
three
year
supervision
period
for
debtor
with
essentially
"
no
income
and
no
asset
"
.
the
first
amendment
be
to
section
25
of
the
personal
Insolvency
Act
2012
where
it
be
propose
to
delete
the
reference
in
the
definition
of
debt
that
the
debt
must
be
payable
within
three
year
from
the
date
of
application
.
the
effect
of
this
deletion
will
be
to
allow
the
debtor
to
propose
the
inclusion
of
debt
which
do
not
become
due
until
future
date
such
as
term
loan
in

the
primary
objective
of
the
propose
amendment
be
to
assist
the
MABS
and
its
approve
intermediary
in
operate
the
debt
relief
notice
process
.
the
amendment
be
intend
to
respond
to
the
follow
operational
difficulty
:
first
,
calculate
the
exact
amount
owe
under
term
loan
,
hire
purchase
and
lease
arrangement
and
instalment
order
which
may
have
more
than
three
year
to
run
;
and
second
,
that
a
certain
interpretation
of
the
previous
definition
would
appear
to
allow
settlement
of
up
to
three
year
of
such
debt
but
then
allow
continuation
of
payment
to
creditor
to
resume
in
year
four
onwards
.
such
a
outcome
would
run
counter
to
the
policy
intention
that
all
of
the
debt
,
other
than
the
four
category
of
exclude
debt
,
owe
by
the
debtor
must
be
include
in
a
potential
debt
relief
notice
.
neither
be
there
a
intention
of
allow
differential
payment
to
creditor
,
as
all
must
be
treat
equally
.
the
change
to
the
definition
of
debt
would
capture
all
of
the
debt
owe
by
the
debtor
.
if
this
debt
total
less
than
€
20000
,
the
debtor
should
qualify
for
a
debt
relief
notice
which
,
if
approve
by
the
court
,
be
effective
immediately
.
at
the
end

141
of
the

be
similar
and
have
the
objective
of
seek
to
reduce
the
cost
associate
with
bankruptcy
.
the
Insolvency
Service
of
Ireland
have
propose
that
it
would
provide
cost
free
a
facility
on

for
a

fact
,

currently
,

and
a
daily
newspaper
circulate
in
the
State

permit
.
this
change
in
regard
to
the
give
of
notice
could
save
a
bankrupt
person
a
considerable
amount
.
the
amendment
to
this
section
of

will
allow
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
to
prescribe
how
notice
of
the
adjudication
be
to
be
give
by
the

the
essential
change
be
to
now
include
the
option
of
use
the
website
of
the
insolvency
service
for
the
notice
,
in

can
help
to
allay
some
of
the
concern
about
the
cost
of
bankruptcy
which
have
be
raise
in
recent
time
.
the
propose

in
regard
to
the
register
of
insolvency

in
electronic
format
,
allow
for
it
to
be
open
to
public
inspection
and
a
inspection
fee
to
be
charge
.
essentially
,
this
be
a
technical
amendment
.
the
amendment
to
bankruptcy
law
provide
for
in
the
Bill
will
complete
the
current
reform
of
bankruptcy
legislation
.

with
the
high
court
procedure
as
a
reason
many
sme
do
not
currently
avail
of
examinership
.
it
be
not
possible
,
as
a
result
of
the
number
of
variable
attach
to
the
examinership
process
,
to
quantify
estimate
of
the
savings
which
might
accrue
.
for
example
,
there
may
be
different
level
of
legal
representation
in
different
case
.
in
addition
,
the
number
of
application
to
the
court
during
the
examinership
process
may
-
depend
on
the
complexity
involve
-
vary
between
case
.
in
every
examinership
there
be
two
essential
hearing
before
the
court
.
the
first
of
this
relate
to
seek
the
appointment
of
the
examiner
and
the
second
to
seek
confirmation
of
he
or
she
report
in
which
he
or
she
will
set
out
he
or
she
proposal
for
a
compromise
or
scheme
of
arrangement
.
there
may
also
be
a
need
for
a
hearing
in
order
that
creditor
might
have
they
say
before
the
appointment
of
a
interim
examiner
be
confirm
.
however
,
in
the
course
of
the
examinership
-
and
depend
of
the
complexity
of
the
circumstance
in
a
particular
case
-
there
may
be
a
need
for
the
examiner
to
seek
either
direction
from
the
court
on
various
issue
or
permission
to
exercise
certain
power
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
impossible
to
estimate
the
number
of
occasion
on
which
there
will
be
recourse
to
the
court
during
a
examinership
.
there
be
no
typical
examinership
.
the
level
of
legal
and
other
cost
will
be
determine
by
the
simplicity
or
complexity
of
a
particular
case
.
in
light
of
the
finding
of
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
to
the
effect
that
"
in
the
form
currently
available
to
small
private
company
(
SPCs
)
,
be
inadequate
by
reason
of
the
cost
involve
which
be
prohibitive
"
and
the
acknowledgement
that
examinership
be
generally
not
a
possibility
for
such
company
because
of
the
cost
associate
with
the
high
court
procedure
,
it
would
be
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
establish
a
base
from
which
to
measure
future
cost
savings
for
other
small
company
arise
from
the
use
of
the
circuit
Court
route
instead
.
there
be
no
exist
group
which
can
be
use
for
comparative
purpose
.
attempt
to
compare
the
cost
relate
to
a
examinership
in
the
high
court
in
respect
of
a
large
company
with
the
possible
cost
for
a
small
company
in
the
circuit
Court
would
not
be
a
meaningful
exercise
.
there
be
no
standard
or
comparator
against
which
assessment
can
be
make
.
furthermore
,
the
datum
relate
to
the
cost
of
a
examinership
may
not
be
publicly
available
and
would
need
to
be
source
from
company
.
this
would
impose
a
additional
administrative
burden
on
company
,
which
could
not
be
compel
to
provide
the
necessary
information
without
the
introduction
of
legislation
.
the
Senator
's
amendment
do
address
this
particular
issue
.
it
be
not
unreasonable
to
assume
,
however
,
that
take
a
examinership
case
in
the
circuit
court
should
be
less
costly
than
do
so
in
the
high
court
,
particularly
as
the
legal
cost
relate
to
the
former
and
low
than
that
which
obtain
in
respect
of
the
latter
.
access
should
also
be
improve
by
the
proximity
of
the
circuit
Court
to
the
company
seek
to
avail
of
the
examinership
process
.
there
may
also
be
less
of
a
need
to
resort
to
the
court
during
the
examinership
process
if
a
particular
case
be
less
complex
.
this
be
all
factor
which
should
result
in
low
cost
for
small
company
use
the
examinership
process
in
the
future
.
however
,
in
the
absence
of
datum
on
the
cost
currently
incur
by
small
company
in
the
examinership
process
because
they
do
not
seek
examinership
,
it
would
be
less
than
robust
to
attempt
to
estimate
savings
by
a
comparison
of
speculative
cost
in
a
unused
high
court
process
and
the
propose
circuit
court
process
give
the
variable
I
have
outline
.
I
assure
the
Senator
that
we
have
give
this
matter
consideration
and
study
he
contribution
on
a
similar
amendment
on
Committee
stage
.
I
have
outline
all
of
the
difficulty
that
arise
in
attempt
to
calculate
savings
that
would
accrue
under
this
proposal
.
on
a
general
level
,
I
remind
Senator
that
government
policy
on
business
be
to
provide
for
a
operating
environment
in
which
obstacle
that
could
impede
its
development
be
remove
,
where
possible
,
and
it
be
encourage
to
develop
and
flourish
.
the
proposal
before
we
be
firmly
locate
in
this
category
.
the
granting
of
the
possibility
of
direct
access
to
the
circuit
court
to
small
business
in
the
manner
propose
offer
business
the
opportunity
to
restructure
they
affair
and
return
to
a
even
keel
at
a
cost
that
be
likely
to
prove
more
affordable
than
be
require
to
take
the
high
court
route
.
this
be
,
therefore
,
a
intrinsically
laudable
proposal
and
on
that
basis
alone
,
it
merit
the
support
of
the
House
.
with
respect
to
Senator
Barrett
,
I
cannot
help
but
feel
that
he
propose
amendment
have
overtone
of
a
measure
to
police
legal
cost
.
I
do
not
consider
that
a
company
law
measure
such
as
this
be
the
appropriate
medium
in
which
to
pursue
such
a
objective
.
perhaps
he
will
consider
approach
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
on
the
issue
as
the
amendment
be
not
appropriate
to
the
legislation
before
the
House
.
on
that
basis
,
and
with
respect
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
it
.
I
object
to
the
Senator
's
statement
.
person
do
not
put
word
into
minister
's
mouth
.
with
due
respect
,
we
take
advice
and
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
we
accept
it
.
as
the
minister
of
State
who
be
take
this
legislation
,
have
take
due
regard
,
I
will
not
accept
the
amendment
.
the
issue
the
Senator
raise
regard
cost
and
oversight
be
a
policy
matter
and
not
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
.
I
do
not
propose
to
say
anything
further
.
I
thank
the
Acting
Chairman
,
Senator
Paul
Coghlan
,
for
allow
I
to
intervene
.
on
a
point
of
order

to

thank
you
.
I
do
not
believe
anybody
in
the
House
disagree
with
the
spirit
of
the
submission
make
by
the
Senator
.
all
of
we
agree
there
be
a
malaise
and
a
morass
regard
auditing
and
accountancy
in
a
particular
period
but
in
deal
with
the
specific
amendment
I
must
be
cognisant
of
whether
they
be
applicable
to
the
legislation
before
we
and
I
would
say
that
the
last
amendment
be
certainly
not
.
on
this
amendment
,
notwithstand
the
robust
case
make
by
Senator
Barrett
which
be
a
commentary
on
the
lack
of
robust
auditing
and
accountancy
proceedings
,
the
case
we
would
make
be
that
it
be
unnecessary
and
I
do
not

it
be
important
to
distinguish
between
the

itself
and
the

a

to
ensure
that

that
will

the

function
from
the
recognise
accountancy
body
to
the
IAASA
in
respect
of
the
audit
of
public

entity
be
in
line
with
good
international
practice
.
for
example
,
the
United
State
have
such
a
system
under
the
Sarbanes
-
Oxley
Act
,
to
which
Senator
Barrett
refer
on
Committee
Stage
,
as
have
Canada
,
Japan
and
Australia
.
within
the
European

at

six
member
state
have
move
to
this
independent
quality
assurance
system
,
include
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
Germany
and
France
,
and
small
one
such
as
Belgium
and
the
Netherlands
.
this
system
be
acknowledge
as
the
good
way
of
ensure
the
necessary
independence
of
the
quality
assurance
process
.
a
system
where
the
professional
body
execute
the
quality
assurance
function
on
its
member
auditor
and
audit
firm
of
public
interest
entity
be
consider
to
lack
the
requisite
degree
of
independence
.
in
the
EU
new
legislative
proposal
on
audit
be
currently
at
a
advanced
stage
of
consideration
and
this
proposal
include
a
mandatory
requirement
for
member
state
to
have
the
quality
assurance
of
auditor
and
audit
firm
which
conduct
audit
of
public

entity
carry
out
by
public
oversight
body
such
as
the
IAASA
.
the
US
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight
Board
be
understand
as
not
consider
that
it
can
place
the
same
level
of
reliance
on
audit
report
of
public
interest
entity
produce
in
jurisdiction
which
do
not
have
a
independent

system
of

that
which
do

among
the
additional
function
that
will
be
confer
on
the
IAASA
to
enable
it

undertake
the

quality

function
be
power
to
take
disciplinary
action

firm

the
intention
be
that
this
power
of
sanction
and
penalty
will
be
proportionate
and
dissuasive
.
be
it
appropriate
for
I
to
ask
Senator
Barrett
to
flesh
out
some
of
the
point
he
make
regard
the
amendment
he
wish
to
press

perhaps
he
could
send
I
a
note
on
any
practical
mechanism
through
which
we
could
look
at
this
again
,
without
prejudice

I
refer
to
the
question
raise
by
Senator
Barrett
on

a
amendment
today

in

I
propose
incorporate
the
measure
into
the

the
intention
be
that
the

amendment
will
be
include
as

I
hope
Senator
Barrett
understand
we
will
not
accept
he
amendment
.
in
response
to
a
point
Senator
Barrett
raise
previously
on
the
substantive
Bill
,
the
committee
power
through
1400
section
in
two
day
in
a
efficient
manner
.
I
acknowledge
the
role
of
official
and
public
servant
involve
in
the
process
.
while
the
Senator
have
make
a
point
about
the
number
of
year
it
have
take
,
it
move
through
the
committee
expeditiously
,
because
it
be
very
much
a
cross-party
Bill
.
it
be
a
consolidate
piece
of
legislation
and
there
be
agreement
from
all
political
side
on
the
need
to
ensure
we
deal
with
it
efficiently
.
we
probably
set
a
record
in
deal
with
1400
section
in
24
hour
,
not
a
bad
way
to
do
business
in
the
House
.
I
ask
Senator
Barrett
to
take
on
board
the
point
I
have
make
in
regard
to
amendment
no.

I
be
confident
he
concern
will
be
cover
in
a
amendment
to
the
company
Bill

this
be
a
draft
amendment
to
section

be
recommend
by
the
Parliamentary

design
to
correctly
reference

come
into

enactment
of
the

Aran

in

also
subsidise

management
service

aerodrome
base
on

in
all
,
the

the
quality
of
life

community
as
well
as
promote
island
tourism
.
expenditure
on
this
service
be
€
5.9
million
in
2013
.
the
same
allocation
be
available
in
2014
.
the
contract
for
the
subsidise
passenger
ferry
service
for
Inis
Mórch
come
to
a
end
on
31
January
2013
.
the
Department
seek
tender
through
a
public
tendering
process
,
as
it
do
with
all
its
subsidise
service
,
for
a
further
five
year
contract
until
31
January
2018
,
but
receive
no
tender
within
the
deadline
set
.
in
the
absence
of
a
tender
,
official
from
the
Department
hold
discussion
with
the
ferry
operator
that
have
be
provide
the
contract
service
to
explore
the
possibility
of
enter
into
a
new
contract
for
the
service
on
the
same
term
as
the
previous
contract
.
unfortunately
,
this
discussion
be
unsuccessful
as
the
Department
could
not
accept
the
operator
's
claim
for
a
substantial
subsidy
increase
on
a
service
that
be
,
by
all
account
,
profitable
without
a
subsidy
.
the
Department
understand
that
the
operator
continue
to
provide
the
service
at
the
same
level
since
the
end
of
the
contract
with
the
State
but
that
the
fare
payable
by
island
resident
be
increase
.
I
understand
tsome
uncertainty
have
recently
arise
regard
the
continuation
of
the
service
at
the
current
level
.
a
representative
of
the
operator
meet
my
Department
and
indicate
that
circumstance
for
the
company
have
alter
and
that
it
cannot
guarantee
it
will
be
able
to
continue
operate
as
previously
.
official
also
meet
representative
of
the
island
co-op
and
the
Minister
of
State
be
aware
of
they
concern
about
the
current
situation
.
the
Minister
of
State
would
like
to
make
it
clear
to
the
Senator
that
he
be
open
to
undertake
any
reasonable
step
that
would
assist
in
find
a
resolution
to
meet
with
the
requirement
of
all
party
.
any
step
the
Department
might
take
must
fall
within
public
procurement
regulation
and
be
achievable
within
the
resource
available
to
it
.
there
be
no
plan
at
present
to
readvertise
this
contract
as
the
Department
do
not
have
in
its
possession
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
outcome
of
another
public
tendering
process
would
differ
dramatically
from
that
which
take
place
towards
the
end
of
2012
.
as
the
Senator
will
appreciate
,
it
be
incumbent
on
the
Minister
of
State
to
ensure
public
money
be
spend
in
the
most
cost
-
effective
manner
and
achieve
the
maximum
return
for
the
State
.
the
Department
cannot
justify
subsidise
a
service
if
such
subsidy
be
not
warrant
.
I
assure
the
Senator
that
effort
will
continue
to
ensure
there
will
be
a
regular
passenger
ferry
service
to
the
island
at
reasonable
cost
throughout
the
year
and
Department
personnel
be
always
available
for
discussion
.
I
acknowledge
the
Senator
's
contribution
.
I
know
the
minister
will
make
himself
available
to
seek
a
resolution
to
the
matter
.
I
will
convey
to
he
the
Senator
's
contribution
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
.
as
a
minister
of
State
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
be
from
Cork
,
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
matter
as
it
offer
we
the
opportunity
to
clarify
the
current
position
on
the
propose
amalgamation
and
reconfiguration
of
primary
school
on
the
north
side
of
Cork
city
.
I
advise
the
Senator
that
we
be
aware
that
a
consultation
process
have
be
initiate
involve
North
Presentation
primary
school
,
St.
Vincent

's
primary
school
,
Scoil
Mhuire
Fatima
-
or
North
Monday
primary
school
-
and
Gaelscoil
Pheig
Sayers
.
as
the
Senator
may
be
aware
,
the
initiative
for
any
amalgamation
or
reconfiguration
of
school
may
come
from
a
variety
of
source
,
such
as
parent
,
staff
,
board
of
management
and
patron
.
any
such
proposal
must
involve
consultation
with
all
of
the
relevant
stakeholder
and
follow
decision
take
at
local
level
.
in
that
regard
,
any
propose
change
must
be
well
plan
and
manage
in
a
manner
that
accommodate
the
interest
of
parent
,
teacher
and
local
community
,
which
be
a
key
point
,
and
contribute
to
a
inclusive
education
system
.
it
be
a
matter
for
the
relevant
school
authority
,
include
the
parent
and
school
community
,
to
arrive
at
a
satisfactory
outcome
.
I
confirm
that
although
the
decision
make
authority
for
the
amalgamation
of
any
school
belong
to
the
patron
of
the
school
concerned
,
such
a
proposal
be
then
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
.
with
regard
to
the
primary
school
amalgamation
and
reconfiguration
be
propose
,
I
understand
detail
of
this
proposal
have
recently
be
send
to
the
board
of
management
,
staff
and
parent
of
the
four
school
involve
.
it
be
understand
that
when
the
consultation
process
be
conclude
,
the
trustee
of
the
school
concerned
will
make
a
recommendation
to
the
patron
for
he
decision
in
the
matter
.
in
that
regard
,
I
confirm
that
to
date
the
minister
have
not
receive
any
proposal
from
the
patron
or
trustee
in
the
matter
.
I
again
thank
the
Senator
for
give
I
the
opportunity
to
clarify
the
current
position
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
as
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
theory
involve
.
if
no
proposal
have
be
receive
by
the
minister
to
date
,
this
be
still
very
much
a
localised
process
.
with
regard
to
who
be
the
patron
,
I
would
have
think
the
answer
could
be
divine
through
the
various
school
involve
in
the
process
.
in
the
absence
of
any
application
,
correspondence
or
proposal
to
the
Department
or
minister
,
it
could
be
argue
that
we
be
blind
to
any
proposal
.
therefore
,
notwithstand
the
level
of
public
sentiment
express
at
the
public
meeting
about
the
process
,
no
clarification
or
correspondence
have
be
provide
to
we
either
at
a
political
or
departmental
level
.
we
await
such
correspondence
,
should
it
arise
.
the
question
of
the
patron
remain
to
be
answer
and
perhaps
I
can
provide
assistance
to
the
Senator
in
due
course
.
I
hope
the
matter
will
be
sort
out
.
I

I

the
establishment
of
a

as
a
positive
step
forward
.
that
it
be
underpin
by
a

agreement
,
ultimately
with
Enterprise
Ireland
,
give
it
a
very
firm
foundation
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
issue
.
while
dementia
can
bring
many
challenge
both
for
the
person
with
the
condition
and
people
care
for
they
,
thankfully
there
be
a
increase
recognition
that
people
can
live
and
live
well
with
dementia
for
a
number
of
year
as
long
as
the
right
support
be
in
place
.
I
be
pleased
to
advise
the
Senator
that
the
first
ever
comprehensive
strategy
that
be
specifically
dedicate
to
dementia
in
Ireland
be
at
a
advanced
stage
of
development
.
we
overarching
policy
be
commit
to
support
people
to
live
in
dignity
and
independence
in
they
own
home
and
community
for
as
long
as
possible
and
to
support
access
to
quality
long
-
term
residential
care
where
appropriate
.
we
will
continue
to
develop
health
service
around
the
country
,
wherever
possible
,
to
enhance
quality
provision
and
patient
safety
.
the
HSE
have
operational
responsibility
for
the
delivery
of
health
and
social
service
,
include
that
at
facility
such
as
St.
Joseph
's
Hospital
,
Ennis
.
St.
Joseph's
Hospital
be
predominantly
a
old
person
's
public
residential
unit
that
provide
a
range
of
care
include
long
stay
,
short
stay
,
respite
,
palliative
and
consultant
-
lead
rehabilitative
care
.
I
must
stress
that
the
facility
cater
for
people
with
vary
level
of
dementia
also
.
in
County
Clare
consultant
-
lead
mental
health
bed
for
old
person
be
use
at
Cappahard
Lodge
and
in
the
acute
psychiatric
unit
.
without
question
,
the
service
be
well
aware
that
a
more
appropriate
environment
be
desirable
.
in
this
context
,
bed
use
by
the
old
person
's
service
at
St.
Joseph
's
Hospital
be
refurbish
for
the
intend
takeover
by
the
mental
health
service
.
the
refurbish
bed
be
not
operate
by
the
mental
health
service
,
but
they
be
open
and
be
use
to
very
good
effect
.
the
HSE
be
explore
every
opportunity
to
redirect
exist
mental
health
resource
to
move
the
refurbish
bed
under
the
direction
of
that
service
.
a
sub
-committee
be
put
in
place
this
year
and
will
shortly
determine
if
such
be
possible
.
it
must
be
stress
that
it
be
never
intend
or
indicate
that
new
additional
resource
would
be
available
for
such
bed
,
as
they
be
intend
to
replace
exist
bed
and
,
therefore
,
would
be
resource
neutral
.
the
HSE
will
have
a
definitive
position
on
the
matter
by
the
summer
.
this
be
one
part
of
a
multidisciplinary
response
by
mental
health
service
to
dementia
in
County
Clare
.
in
the
wide
context
of
development
of
old
age
psychiatry
,
Clare
Mental
Health
Service
have
a
dedicated
consultant
-
lead
team
for
psychiatry
of
old
age
which
cater
for
a
potential
population
of
approximately
14500
old
people
aged
over
65
year
.
this
be
base
in
Cappahard
Lodge
,
Ennis
and
consist
of
a
non-consultant
hospital
doctor
,
nursing

psychology
,
social

and
occupational
therapy
care
.
as
part
of
development
funding
allocate
to
the
mid-west
,
a
additional
five
staff
be
allocate
and
be
in
place
in
psychiatry
of
late
life
in
County
Clare
.
there
be
advanced
plan
to
develop
a
day
care
centre
on
the
St.
Joseph
's
Hospital
site
specifically
for
people
with
dementia
,
and
the
HSE
be
in
the
final
stage
of
negotiation
on
this
matter
.
the
need
of
old
people
be
and
will
remain
a
very
high
priority
.
the
resource
that
be
available
will
be
apply
to
provide
the
good
possible
mix
of
support
and
service
in
a
way
that
most
effectively
match
the
need
and
preference
of
old
people
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
enable
people
to
live
as
independently
as
possible
within
they
own
community
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
he
response
.
I
will
certainly
raise
this
issue
,
not
only
with
the
minister
for
Health
but
also
with
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
who
have
a
specific
area
of
responsibility
in
this
regard
and
I
be
take
the
adjournment
on
she
behalf
.
I
note
the
Senator
say
he
would
raise
this
matter
again
on
the
adjournment
in
the
Seanad
within
the
next
six
to
eight
week
.
if
I
may
advise
,
if
the
Senator
be
in
a
position
to
approach
the
Minister
of
State
directly
,
I
be
sure
she
would
be
more
than
delighted
to
discuss
this
in
person
with
he
.
I
also
note
the
manner
in
which
the
issue
be
raise
with
the
Senator
by
a
constituent
of
he
whose
family
member
be
acutely
affect
by
the
provision
of
this
service
.
we
want
to
ensure
we
supply
this
service
appropriately
and
,
as
I
say
,
bear
in
mind
at
all
time
the
dignity
of
the
people
who
need
this
service
.
it
be
take
time
.
there
be
a
timeline
and
we
would
be
very
hopeful
of
stick
to
that
timeline
.
I
will
certainly
speak
to
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
directly
.
I
thank
the
minister
of

I
thank
Senator
Colm
Burke
for
raise
this
adjournment
matter
which
I
be
take
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
.
we
should
clarify
that
the
selection
criterion
and
process
for
admission
to
medical
school
be
a
matter
for
the
medical
school
and
university
in
line
with
they
statutory
autonomy
in
respect
of
academic
affair
.
I
genuinely
take
the
point
raise
by
Senator
Colm
Burke
and
John
Crown
in
respect
of
the
culture
around
admission
to
medicine
.
I
be
not
deliver
the
script
entirely
in
that
sense
.
a
international
tender
process
be
undertake
by
the
medical
school
and
the
Australian
Council
for
Educational
Research
,
ACER
,
be
choose
to
administer
the
new
entry
process
to
medicine
,
which
we
know
as
HPAT
.
the
introduction
of
HPAT
in
2009
have
regard
to
the
finding
of
"
Medical
Education
in
Ireland
:
a
New
Direction
.
report
of
the
work
Group
on
Undergraduate
Medical
Education
and
Training
"
or
the
Fottrell
report
.
it
recommend
that
leave
certificate
result
should
no
long
be
the
sole
selection
method
for
entry
to
medical
education
at
undergraduate
level
.
it
recommend
that
a
two
-
stage
mechanism
should
be
apply
consist
of
the
result
obtain
in
the
leave
certificate
and
a
standardise
admission
test
which
would
assess
non-academic
skill
and
attribute
regard
as
important
for
the
practice
of
medicine
.
in
2012
the
group
undertake
a
comprehensive
evaluation
of
HPAT
to
determine
the
educational
impact
,
reliability
,
validity
and
stakeholder
acceptability
of
the
new
entry
and
selection
approach
.
it
make
the
follow
recommendation
.
HPAT
-
Ireland
score
should
be
valid
for
a
period
of
one
year
only
instead
of
two
year
.
a
redistribution
should
be
apply
to
the
weighting
of
HPAT
-
Ireland
section
to
reduce
the
contribution
of
section
3
score
to
the
overall
score
in
order
to
reduce
the
impact
of
repeat
effect
.
further
practice
material
should
be
make
available
to
all
HPAT
-
Ireland
applicant
,
which
also
include
some
example
of
correct
response
and
the
rationale
to
this
to
ensure
adequate
opportunity
for
all
to
become
familiar
with
the
test
format
and
sample
item
.
it
be
agree
that
due
consideration
would
be
give
to
the
need
to
ensure
student
be
give
adequate
notice
of
the
change
propose
by
the
expert
group
.
a
investigation
be
under
way
by
ACER
amid
allegation
that
student
who
attend
a
HPAT
preparation
course
have
see
and
be
coach
in
how
to
answer
certain
question
that
appear
in
this
year
's
HPAT
examination
.
ACER
take
very
seriously
the
integrity
of
candidate
's
result
in
HPAT
.
the
reliability
and
validity
of
its
test
be
therefore
of
paramount
importance
to
ACER
.
the
investigation
will
first
attempt
to
establish
the
degree
,
if
any
,
of
similarity
between
the
test
question
and
that
allegedly
believe
to
have
be
provide
by
the
coaching
college
in
question
.
I
be
give
to
understand
that
base
on
the
briefing
we
have
receive
that
this
process
be
extremely
thorough
.
candidate
's
optical
mark
recognition
have
to
be
scan
and
re-scann
.
data
analysis
have
to
be
carry
out
by
a
minimum
of
two
psychometrician
.
there
be
many
area
of
analysis
involve
;
the
detection
of
anomaly
be
just
one
part
of
the
standard
analysis
process
.
the
result
of
the
investigation
may
lead
to
some
test
unit
be
remove
from
all
candidate
's
score
obtain
in
the
2014
examination
.
the
Department
have
ask
that
it
be
keep
inform
by
the
High
Education
Authority
of
progress
on
address
this
issue
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
.
however
,
I
do
not
wish
to
be
pedantic
but
the
Senator
's
question
do
not
speak
to
cost
specifically
,
rather
it
speak
to
the
current
operation
of
the
HPAT
medical
school
entrance
exam
amid
recent
claim
that
student
who
attend
a
certain
revision
course
have
prior
knowledge
of
several
of
the
question
that
appear
in
the
examination
.
I
be
happy
to
revisit
the
issue
of
cost
and
the
admission
system
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
about
the
grind
school
effect
.
this
be
endemic
in
Irish
education
and
should
not
happen
if
one
wish
to
have
a
completely
equal
system
for
all
.
it
be
one
of
the
quirk
of
the
education
system
that
there
be
a
way
of
game
the
system
,
so
to
speak
.
I
do
not
mean
"
gaming
"
in
any
kind
of
underhand
way
,
but
there
will
always
be
a
market
for
a
grind
methodology
.
I
agree
with
the
Senator
in
that
regard
because
this
exclude
many
citizen
who
simply
cannot
afford
grind
but
who
have
more
than
adequate
ability
to
become
wonderful
physician
.
it
be
a
aspect
we
need
to
address
.
I
will
raise
the
matter
with
the
hea
.
with
regard
to
the
Senator
's
second
point
,
I
will
undertake
to
provide
clarification
for
he
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
take
the
point
he
make
about
Letterfrack
.
the
building
be
be
use
as
a
furniture
and
craftwork
school
.
I
have
visit
the
village
of
Letterfrack
.
sometimes
out
of
misery
and
turmoil
come
something
that
be
creative
.
the
folk
memory
of
people
who
live
in
the
area
of
Letterfrack
will
ensure
what
happen
there
will
never
be
forget
.
I
note
he
point
about
the
creation
of
a
physical
memorial
in
that
region
.
the
provision
of
a
memorial
to
victim
of
institutional
abuse
be
one
of
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
to
inquire
into
child
abuse
.
the
Ryan
report
note
the
importance
of
the
State
's
formal
recognition
of
the
abuse
that
occur
and
the
suffering
of
victim
be
preserve
in
a
permanent
place
.
a
committee
be
appoint
in
October
2009
to
oversee
the
design
and
commissioning
of
the
memorial
and
a
budget
of
€
500000
be
set
aside
.
the
committee
be
chair
by
Sean
Benton
,
a
former
chairman
of
the
OPW
.
the
committee
consult
widely
during
2010
and
it
then
pursue
a
two
stage
international
competition
in
conjunction
with
the
OPW
.
the
competition
be
launch
in
July
2011
and
the
design
brief
note
that
there
be
no
preconceived
idea
regard
the
design
of
the
memorial
.
the
OPW
agree
to
make
the
site
adjacent
to
the
Garden
of
Remembrance
available
as
a
permanent
location
for
the
memorial
in
the
event
of
it
take
the
form
of
a
physical
artefact
.
however
,
entrant
be
not
limit
to
this
site
and
could
make
a
submission
for
other
State
-
own
site
.
six
of
the
32
submission
receive
in
the
first
stage
of
the
competition
be
short
list
;
four
of
this
short
-
list
entry
be
proposal
for
the
site
in
Parnell
Square
.
have
meet
with
the
short
list
entrant
and
assess
they
detailed
,
specific
proposal
,
the
competition
jury
unanimously
decide
to
award
the
commission
to
Studio
Negri
and
Hennessy
&
associate
,
for
the
Journey
of
Light
memorial
.
the
jury
feel
that
the
manner
in
which
the
propose
memorial
integrate
with
the
Garden
of
Remembrance
would
provide
a
endure
symbol
of
lose
innocence
to
inspire
future
generation
to
ensure
the
protection
of
all
child
.
follow
the
announcement
of
the
competition
winner
in
July
2012
,
the
OPW
seek
and
receive
planning
permission
from
Dublin
City
Council
,
subject
to
a
range
of
condition
,
in
May
2013
.
the
grant
of
permission
be
appeal
by
a
third
party
and
a
Bord
Pleanála
refuse
planning
permission
for
the
proposal
in
November
,
as
the
Senator
outline
in
he
submission
.
the
board
believe
that
the
propose
memorial
would
have
have
a
adverse
impact
on
the
setting
,
character
and
function
of
the
Garden
of
Remembrance
.
we
seek
the
view
of
the
memorial
committee
on
the
decision
's
implication
.
the
committee
have
advise
that
the
journey
of
light
proposal
be
not
transferable
to
another
site
,
as
it
be
inextricably
link
with
the
Garden
of
Remembrance
.
neither
do
it
consider
that
the
board
's
decision
should
be
appeal
,
as
it
would
be
divisive
and
not
in
the
good
interest
of
the
project
.
it
believe
that
any
new
competition
should
be
open
to
conceptual
and
site
-
specific
proposal
and
that
a
central
Dublin
location
should
be
identify
as
a
cost
neutral
basis
with
appropriate
zoning
.
the
official
in
my
Department
be
consult
the
OPW
on
the
identification
of
a
suitable
central
Dublin
location
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
which
I
be
take
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Health
.

the

a
key
part
of

be

(

Bill
2013

publication
of
the
Bill
represent
a
partial
response
to
the
commitment
we
make
in
the
programme
for
government
regard
co-operative
,
when
we
say
we
would
"
work
to
promote
a
great
appreciation
of
the
co-operative
model
as
a
distinct
form
of
organisation
,
ensure
a
level
playing
field
between
co-operative
and
the

option

enterprise
activity
,
and
provide
a
conducive
framework
for
the
full
potential
of
the
co-operative
model
to
be
realise
''
.
we
begin
this
process
of
level
the
playing
field
with
the
introduction
of
a
statutory
instrument
in
late
2012
which
reduce
the
fee
charge
by
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
to
co-operative
society
by
between
33
%
and
80
%
,
bring
they
into
line
in
so
far
as
possible
with
that
charge
to
company
.
the
commitment
be
also
encompass
in
a
action
plan
for
Jobs
for
2013
,
when
we
promise
to
publish
legislation
aim
at
ease
the
regulatory
burden
on
co-operative
society
and
make
it
easy
to
run
a
co-operative
as
a
alternative
form
of
enterprise
organisation
.
the
Bill
be
the
crystallisation
of
this
promise
,
and
I
be
happy
to
commend
it
to
the
House
.
the
Bill
also
propose
a
number
of
modification
to
the
friendly
Society
Act
.
before
I
get
into
the
detail
of
what
be
contain
in
the
Bill
,
I
would
like
to
elaborate
a
little
on
the
background
to
its
development
and
the
legislative
regime
under
which
friendly
society
and
co-operative
society
operate
.
friendly
society
and
industrial
and
provident
society
develop
as
part
of
the
mutual
self
-
help
movement
of
the
19th
century
,
which
include
co-operative
,
building
society
,
savings
bank
,
credit
union
and
trade
union
.
give
Ireland
's
rural
economy
,
the
emphasis
be
on
farming
co-operative
and
agricultural
bank
,
with
friendly
society
largely
be
a
urban
phenomenon
,
many
offer
a
insurance
-
type
service
,
make
payment
and
offer
support
at
time
of
death
,
illness
or
inability
to
work
.
in
the
intervene
year
many
of
this
sector
have
become
regulate
as
they
develop
-
for
example
,
insurance
and
credit
union
-
or
be
replace
by
State
-
provide
welfare
system
.
the
modernisation
of
this
legislation
for
the
remain
group
have
lag
behind
.
friendly
and
co-operative
society
operate
under
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
who
be
responsible
for
carry
out
the
statutory
function
and
duty
confer
on
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
under
they
respective
separate
and
independent
system
of
legislation
,
namely
,
the
friendly
Society
Act
1896
to
1977
and
the
Industrial
and
provident
Society
Act
1893
to
2005
.
the
subject
matter
of
this
act
be
broadly
comparable
to
that
of
the
company
Act
.
they
deal
,
albeit
in
a
rudimentary
and
less
detailed
manner
,
with
topic
such
as
registration
,
liability
,
account
and
audit
,
public
enforcement
,
rule
,
inspection
and
dissolution
.
they
provide
a
type
of
company
law
for
co-operative
society
and
friendly
society
.
there
be
already
some
direct
linkage
between
the
two
body
of
legislation
deal
with
company
law
and
co-operative
society
,
particularly
on
wind
up
,
auditor
and
the
conversion
of
society
into
company
and
vice
versa
,
and
a
number
of
company
law
provision
be
cross-apply
to
co-operative
society
.
while
it
may
be
argue
that
the
legislation
have
stand
the
test
of
time
well
in
many
respects
,
there
be
no
doubt
or
argument
that
the
legislation
be
outdated
,
and
in
other
respects
be
in
need
of
a
fundamental
overhaul
.
a
simple
example
of
this
be
that
while
co-operative
generally
operate
under
the
Industrial
and
Provident
Society
Act
,
although
some
register
as
company
,
the
term
"
co-operative
society
"
do
not
appear
in
law
.
on
the
friendly
society
side
,
it
be
less
clear
that
there
be
a
need
to
maintain
this
category
of
society
.
only
three
new
society
have
be
register
in
the
past
nine
year
,
and
certain
limitation
have
already
be
place
on
the
activity
and
functioning
of
friendly
society
by
other
legislation
,
such
as
the
Health
Insurance
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
act
2009
,
which
introduce
restriction
on
new
body
register
for
the
purpose
of
the
provision
of
health
insurance
.
no
new
body
may
register
as
restrict
membership
undertaking
.
the
Charity
Act
2009
introduce
a
new
Charity
Regulatory
Authority
and
registration
requirement
,
to
which
a
number
of
the
benevolent
-
type
society
will
be
subject
when
they
be
commence
.
the
consumer
credit
act
bring
a
small
number
of
society
under
the
supervision
of
the
Central
Bank
for
loan
purpose
.
the
question
of
why
we
be
tab
a
amending
act
rather
than
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
legislation
can
be
pose
.
when
the
government
decide
in
June
2011
to
proceed
with
a
interim
Bill
to
make
a
number
of
amendment
to
exist
legislation
,
the
reason
for
the
decision
be
twofold
.
this
be
to
avoid
divert
effort
and
resource
away
from
work
on
the
company
Bill
,
which
be
the
priority
in
this
area
,
and
because
when
the
company
Bill
be
enact
it
will
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
have
a
impact
on
how
related
issue
in
the
co-operative
area
will
operate
.
there
be
no
principled
reason
the
approach
take
by
that
Bill
on
matter
such
as
registration
and
financial
reporting
should
not
also
apply
to
friendly
society
and
co-operative
in
due
course
.
the
interim
Bill
be
aim
primarily
at
ease
the
regulatory
burden
on
co-operative
society
and
make
it
easy
to
start
up
and
run
a
co-operative
as
a
alternative
form
of
enterprise
organisation
.
it
will
address
particular
problem
that
have
be
identify
in
the
co-operative
sector
and
help
ensure
this
model
can
thrive
and
grow
to
its
potential
in
line
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
to
promote
appreciation
of
the
co-operative
as
a
form
of
enterprise
organisation
.
the
Bill
will
also
deal
with
certain
issue
regard
friendly
society
which
the
minister
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
think
it
be
timely
to
address
.
it
be
the
minister
's
intention
,
when
the
company
Bill
be
enact
,
to
prepare
new
modern
legislation
to
cater
for
the
co-operative
sector
and
for
exist
friendly
society
.
I
will
elaborate
on
the
policy
consideration
of
the
measure
propose
in
some
detail
in
the
individual
section
.
the
Bill
be
set
out
in
four
part
.
part
1
deal
with
preliminary
and
general
matter
such
as
the
short
ritle
,
collective
citation
,
construction
,
commencement
,
definition
and
expense
.
part
2
provide
for
various
amendment
to
the
friendly
Society
Act
1896
,
principally
the
cessation
of
registration
of
new
society
under
the
act
and
a
prohibition
on
exist
society
from
establish
a
loan
fund
.
part
3
provide
for
a
number
of
amendment
to
the
Industrial
and
Provident
Society
Act
1893
,
include
provide
for
the
removal
of
limit
on
individual
shareholding
,
increase
the
amount
a
society
may
raise
in
fund
without
the
write
permission
of
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
,
provide
for
appeal
against
a
decision
of
the
registrar
to
be
make
to
the
circuit
Court
rather
than
the
high
court
as
at
present
and
allow
great
flexibility
to
society
regard
they
financial
year
for
the
purpose
of
submission
of
annual
return
.
part
4
provide
for
the
application
of
the
exist
law
on
examinership
as
apply
by
the
company
Act
to
industrial
and
provident
society
which
at
present
cannot
avail
of
the
examinership
process
.
section
1
to
3
,
inclusive
,
which
make
up
part
1
be
general
section
only
,
deal
with
citation
,
construction
and
commencement
,
definition
and
provide
that
any
expense
incur
by
the
minister
in
the
administration
of
the
Bill
may
be
pay
out
of
money
provide
by
the
Oireachtas
.
section
4
to
8
,
inclusive
,
which
make
up
part
2
relate
to
the
operation
of
the
friendly
society
legislation
.
section
5
provide
for
a
significant
change
to
that
act
regard
the
cessation
of
registration
of
new
society
under
this
legislation
.
only
a
relatively
small
number
of
society
remain
in
existence
-
just
47
-
and
,
as
I
state
,
there
have
be
just
three
new
entrant
in
the
past
nine
year
,
give
a
clear
indication
that
the
friendly
society
model
be
no
long
favour
by
newly
establish
organisation
.
this
change
will
mean
,
in
effect
,
that
the
friendly
society
model
will
continue
only
as
a
close
group
of
society
-
that
be
,
the
exist
society
will
continue
in
operation
but
no
new
society
will
be
permit
to
be
establish
.
the
current
legislation
do
not
provide
for
prudential
supervision
of
friendly
society
by
any
public
authority
,
which
be
a
source
of
some
concern
in
that
there
be
some
potential
risk
to
the
interest
of
certain
member
of
the
public
,
and
the
minister
consider
that
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
restrict
the
operation
of
new
entity
in
this
area
.
section
6
place
a
restriction
on
exist
society
establish
a
loan
fund
as
provide
for
in
section
46
of
the
principal
friendly
Society
act
of
1896
where
they
do
not
already
have
such
a
fund
in
place
.
this
change
will
not
affect
exist
society
that
have
a
fund
in
place
.
as
I
mention
early
,
such
activity
be
not
subject
to
prudential
supervision
by
any
public
authority
,
and
while
the
European
Community
(
consumer
credit
agreement
)
regulation
2010
,
in
amend
the
consumer
credit
Act
1995
,
bring
a
small
number
of
society
under
the
supervision
of
the
Central
Bank
for
loan
purpose
,
the
minister
be
of
the
opinion
that
society
not
already
active
in
this
field
should
not
be
permit
to
extend
they
remit
.
section
7
and
8
be
two
technical
amendment
which
will
facilitate
the
operation
of
the
friendly
Society
Act
.
section
7
remove
the
role
of
the
minister
in
cancellation
of
friendly
society
.
under
the
current
legislation
,
the
registrar
must
receive
the
prior
approval
of
the
minister
-
formerly
the
Treasury
-
before
cancel
society
on
certain
grounds
.
such
a
role
for
a
political
authority
be
something
of
a
anachronism
in
modern
time
;
for
example
,
the
minister
have
no
role
in
company
strike
-
off
.
it
be
propose
to
remove
this
role
with
regard
to
friendly
society
,
and
also
,
in
section
10
of
the
Bill
,
to
industrial
and
provident
society
.
section
8
remove
the
restriction
in
the
current
act
provide
that
the
registrar
must
be
absent
for
the
power
,
function
and
duty
to
be
exercise
and
perform
by
such
other
person
as
the
minister
may
authorise
,
and
allow
another
person
to
act
alongside
the
Registrar
.
this
change
be
necessary
as
for
the
past
few
year
the
role
of
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
have
not
be
a
dedicated
role
but
have
be
fulfil
by
the
Registrar
of
company
in
addition
to
she
exist
duty
.
section
9
to
12
,
inclusive
,
which
make
up
part
3
relate
to
the
operation
of
the
industrial
and
provident
society
legislation
.
section
10
set
out
a
number
of
amendment
to
the
principal
act
,
relate
to
issue
identify
through
a
consultation
process
as
be
practical
and
immediate
difficulty
be
experience
by
co-operative
society
in
relation
to
the
current
legislation
.
the
minister
consider
that
the
propose
amendment
would
ease
the
administrative
burden
for
the
co-operative
sector
.
paragraph
(
a
)
provide
for
the
removal
of
the
upper
limit
on
the
interest
in
a
society
that
a
individual
society
member
may
hold
,
where
a
society
so
specify
in
its
rule
.
the
exist
upper
limit
-
that
be
,
€
150000
,
or
1
%
of
the
total
asset
of
the
society
,
which
be
insert
in
2005
,
remain
specify
so
that
society
which
wish
to
retain
this
limit
may
do
so
without
have
to
change
they
exist
rule
.
this
limit
be
generally
suitable
for
all
category
of
society
at
present
.
there
be
,
however
,
some
risk
that
it
may
deter
the
formation
of
new
society
with
small
membership
but
high
capital
requirement
-
for
example
,
in
the
wind
farming
sector
.
the
original
rationale
for
have
a
statutory
limit
on
individual
shareholding
-
a
limit
have
be
in
place
since
the
early
act
in
1852
-
be
believe
to
be
connect
with
the
notion
of
equal
participation
by
the
member
of
a
co-operative
enterprise
.
this
objective
,
however
,
can
be
fully
achieve
by
co-operative
themselves
through
the
medium
of
they
own
rule
without
the
need
for
legislative
intervention
.
all
of
the
submission
receive
in
the
course
of
the
consultation
process
that
address
this
issue
have
call
for
the
removal
of
the
limit
.
accordingly
,
it
be
propose
to
avail
of
the
present
legislative
opportunity
to
remove
the
statutory
limit
altogether
as
a
unnecessary
regulatory
restriction
serve
no
useful
purpose
.
the
number
of
society
likely
to
raise
equity
fund
from
a
individual
shareholder
in
excess
of
the
current
statutory
limit
be
not
expect
to
be
many
.
paragraph
(
b
)
provide
that
a
appeal
of
a
refusal
by
the
Registrar
to
register
a
society
,
or
to
register
any
rule
or
amendment
of
rule
,
may
be
make
to
the
circuit
Court
.
under
the
current
legislation
,
where
a
society
,
the
registration
of
which
have
be
cancel
by
the
registrar
-
for
example
,
for
non-submission
of
return
-
wish
to
be
restore
to
the
register
the
society
must
apply
to
the
high
Court
.
it
be
propose
to
amend
the
relevant
provision
to
permit
such
application
to
be
deal
with
by
the
circuit
Court
.
this
should
reduce
cost
for
society
.
paragraph
(
c
)
make
two
technical
amendment
,
provide
for
the
cancellation
of
registration
of
a
society
to
be
"
in
writing
"
rather
than
"
under
he
hand
or
seal
"
,
and
as
I
explain
in
the
case
of
the
similar
provision
in
relation
to
friendly
society
,
provide
for
the
removal
of
the
requirement
for
the
registrar
to
have
the
approval
of
the
minister
for
the
cancellation
.
paragraph
(
would
)
restrict
the
requirement
on
society
to
provide
a
copy
of
its
rule
to
member
only
,
on
payment
of
such
a
fee
as
the
society
may
set
in
its
rule
.
this
will
not
disempower
the
general
public
,
as
the
rule
of
a
society
be
require
to
be
submit
to
the
Registrar
and
so
remain
accessible
to
the
general
public
on
demand
to
the
registrar
on
payment
of
the
appropriate
fee
.
this
will
reduce
the
administrative
burden
on
individual
co-operative
society
to
provide
copy
of
they
rule
to
that
without
a
direct
interest
in
the
society
.
paragraph
(
email
)
provide
that
annual
return
to
the
registrar
may
be
submit
on
one
of
two
date
during
the
year
,
depend
on
the
date
of
a
society
's
financial
year
-
that
be
,
the
date
to
which
its
balance
sheet
be
make
up
.
this
allow
society
freedom
regard
they
choice
of
year
end
and
extend
the
timeframe
for
the
submission
of
the
return
.
the
current
system
be
quite
restrictive
in
that
return
must
be
make
up
to
a
date
fall
within
the
five
-
month
period
from
September
to
January
and
all
annual
return
must
be
submit
by
the
follow
31
March
to
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
.
this
statutory
timing
requirement
,
introduce
in
1893
and
1913
,
cause
difficulty
for
society
whose
annual
business
cycle
do
not
accord
with
that
requirement
such
as
dairy
society
,
which
wish
to
bring
they
reporting
year
into
line
with
the
dairy
production
year
end
March
or
April
,
depend
on
what
part
of
the
country
one
be
from
.
there
be
no
principled
reason
for
not
provide
great
freedom
for
society
to
determine
they
financial
year
-
end
,
as
be
the
case
with
company
.
paragraph
(
f
)
extend
the
right
of
member
or
person
have
a
interest
in
the
fund
of
the
society
to
inspect
the
book
contain
the
name
of
member
to
include
they
holding
in
the
society
,
whether
in
share
or
loan
.
I
understand
this
be
already
the
practice
among
many
co-operative
society
.
this
adjustment
be
be
make
to
facilitate
the
removal
of
the
requirement
for
society
to
submit
a
triennial
return
where
this
information
be
currently
available
,
which
be
be
abolish
.
I
will
provide
detail
on
this
issue
when
I
outline
the
provision
in
section
11
.
paragraph
(
gram
)
provide
for
a
right
for
non-member
to
inspect
the
book
contain
the
name
of
member
and
they
holding
in
share
at
reasonable
hour
at
the
register
office
of
the
society
.
the
section
be
model
on
the
similar
section
in
the
company
Act
.
without
this
amendment
,
non-member
would
have
no
ability
to
access
the
membership
or
hold
detail
of
a
society
in
the
absence
of
the
triennial
return
,
the
requirement
for
which
be
,
as
I
have
just
mention
,
be
abolish
.
paragraph
(
h
)
be
purely
a
technical
amendment
provide
for
a
minor
rewording
of
the
requirement
in
the
rule
to
provide
for
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
interest
in
a
society
a
member
may
hold
.
the
amendment
be
require
consequent
to
the
removal
of
the
upper
limit
in
place
.
section
11
abolish
a
requirement
introduce
by
the
Industrial
and
Provident
Society
(
amendment
)
act
1913
which
require
society
to
submit
at
least
once
in
every
three
year
a
return
of
the
member
and
they
holding
to
the
registrar
.
the
co-operative
sector
have
seek
the
abolition
of
this
requirement
and
argue
that
the
information
be
out
of
date
too
quickly
to
be
useful
and
impose
a
unnecessary
administrative
burden
on
society
.
there
be
general
agreement
that
this
return
serve
no
useful
purpose
and
accordingly
,
it
be
propose
to
remove
the
requirement
.
as
mention
,
section
10
(
gram
)
provide
that
both
member
and
non-member
will
now
be
able
to
access
information
relate
to
member
and
they
shareholding
directly
through
the
co-operative
society
.
section
12
provide
for
a
number
of
amendment
to
the
Industrial
and
Provident
Society
(
amendment
)
Act
1978
.
it
provide
for
a
increase
in
the
amount
that
a
society
may
raise
by
way
of
subscription
for
share
without
the
write
permission
of
the
registrar
from
€
12,697
-
that
be
,
£
10000
-
to
€
30000
.
it
also
extend
the
provision
whereby
certain
funding
source
be
exclude
from
the
requirement
to
obtain
the
write
permission
of
the
registrar
to
include
money
advance
by
a
public
body
to
a
register
society
.
this
will
remove
the
need
for
society
to
seek
the
prior
permission
of
the
registrar
before
they
can
accept
fund
from
a
public
body
or
where
the
amount
of
share
capital
raise
in
any
period
of
six
month
do
not
exceed
€
30000
.
the
change
meet
the
concern
of
some
society
affect
,
particularly
build
co-operative
,
that
the
present
restriction
be
excessive
.
the
section
also
define
"
public
body
"
for
this
purpose
.
section
13
to
24
,
inclusive
,
make
up
the
fourth
and
final
part
of
the
Bill
which
provide
for
the
examinership
provision
of
the
company
(
amendment
)
act
1990
,
as
amend
,
to
be
make
available
to
co-operative
society
.
examinership
be
a
mechanism
use
to
enable
company
that
be
in
financial
difficulty
to
be
put
back
on
a
sound
footing
and
avoid
liquidation
.
currently
,
this
mechanism
be
not
available
to
industrial
and
provident
society
.
the
practical
effect
of
this
be
to
limit
the
restructuring
option
that
be
available
to
a
co-operative
society
in
the
event
of
its
get
into
financial
difficulty
.
while
the
minister
be
not
aware
of
any
particular
instance
in
which
the
examinership
mechanism
may
be
require
by
co-operative
society
,
he
consider
it
desirable
,
particularly
in
the
present
economic
climate
,
that
this
mechanism
should
be
available
for
use
by
any
society
that
might
need
it
.
the
co-operative
movement
also
have
signal
that
it
consider
this
matter
should
be
address
as
a
priority
.
the
intention
be
that
the
law
on
examinership
,
as
it
apply

.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
propose
this
amendment
.
to
be
fair
to
the
government
side
,
we
address
many
of
that
question
on
second
stage
and
give
that
this
be
committee
stage
,
I
will
begin
by
give
the
rationale
for
section
5
and
then
give
a
brief
overview
of
some
of
the
issue
raise
by
the
Senator
.
section
5
provide
for
a
very
significant
change
to
the
friendly
Society
Act
1896
,
that
be
,
the
cessation
of
registration
of
any
new
society
under
this
legislation
.
only
a
few
society
,
47
,
remain
in
existence
.
there
have
be
only
three
new
entrant
in
the
past
nine
year
give
a
clear
indication
that
the
friendly
society
model
be
no
long
favour
by
newly
establish
organisation
.
the
current
legislation
do
not
provide
for
prudential
supervision
of
friendly
society
by
any
public
authority
.
this
be
a
source
of
some
concern
in
that
there
be
some
potential
risk
to
the
interest
of
certain
member
of
the
public
and
I
consider
that
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
restrict
the
operation
of
new
entity
in
this
area
.
that
be
the
justification
for
section
5
.
furthermore
,
certain
limitation
be
already
be
place
on
the
activity
and
functioning
of
friendly
society
by
other
body
of
legislation
.
for
example
,
the
Health
Insurance
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
act
2009
introduce
restriction
on
new
body
register
for
the
purpose
of
the
provision
of
health
insurance
,
that
be
,
no
new
body
may
register
as
restrict
membership
undertaking
;
the
Charity
Act
2009
introduce
a
new
charity
regulatory
authority
and
registration
requirement
to
which
several
of
the
benevolent
type
society
may
be
subject
;
and
the
consumer
credit
Act
1995
bring
a
small
number
of
society
under
the
supervision
of
the
Central
Bank
for
loan
purpose
.
I
assure
the
Senator
that
there
be
no
disadvantage
foreseen
to
any
would
-
be
society
in
that
they
can
register
,
either
under
the
Industrial
and
provident
Society
or
the
company
Act
,
in
both
instance
with
the
add
protection
of
body
corporate
status
.
the
friendly
Society
act
do
not
confer
full
corporate
status
on
society
or
limited
liability
on
member
.
the
evidence
in
recent
year
be
that
this
have
become
common
practice
for
many
charity
and
club
which
register
as
limited
company
.
this
change
will
mean
in
effect
that
the
friendly
society
model
will
continue
only
as
a
close
group
of
society
,
that
be
,
the
exist
society
will
continue
in
operation
but
no
new
society
will
be
permit
to
establish
.
the
Central
Bank
regulate
savings
,
loan
and
insurance
activity
carry
out
by
entity
involve
in
the
provision
of
financial
service
with
a
view
to
protect
the
financial
interest
of
member
of
the
public
do
business
with
the
provider
of
the
financial
service
but
not
where
this
activity
be
carry
out
by
friendly
society
.
this
be
a
source
of
some
concern
to
the
government
in
that
there
be
some
potential
risk
to
the
interest
of
certain
member
of
the
public
and
we
consider
that
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
restrict
the
operation
of
new
entity
in
this
area
.
there
be
no
expertise
in
this
area
in
the
registry
of
friendly
society
and
no
exist
legal
basis
for
such
supervision
and
it
would
not
be
practical
give
the
number
of
society
involve
to
develop
a
supervisory
regime
within
the
registration
of
a
friendly
society
,
RFS
.
the
most
realistic
institutional
option
for
introduce
a
appropriate
system
of
supervision
be
the
Central
Bank
,
which
be
at
the
centre
of
financial
supervision
and
financial
stability
oversight
and
have
a
responsibility
to
provide
,
in
a
fully
integrated
and
co-ordinate
manner
,
for
the
prudential
supervision
and
stability
of
all
type
of
financial
service
within
the
financial
system
as
a
whole
.
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
other
body
move
into
this
unregulated
space
,
it
be
decide
to
close
registration
to
new
friendly
society
.
I
hope
that
address
the
concern
raise
by
the
Senator
in
he
amendment
.
only
a
few
society
,
some
47
,
remain
in
existence
.
there
have
be
only
three
new
entrant
in
the
past
nine
year
and
that
must
indicate
that
newly
-
establish
organisation
no
long
favour
the
friendly
society
model
.
we
strongly
believe
no
new
society
may
register
in
the
future
as
friendly
society
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
he
comment
.
the
Senator
be
effectively
oppose
the
proposal
to
prohibit
the
establishment
of
new
loan
fund
where
a
society
do
not
currently
operate
a
loan
fund
,
and
the
government
do
not
agree
that
this
section
should
be
omit
.
section
6
place
a
restriction
on
exist
society
establish
a
loan
fund
as
provide
for
in
section
46
of
the
principal
friendly
Society
act
1896
where
they
do
not
already
have
such
a
fund
in
place
.
this
change
will
not
impact
exist
society
which
currently
have
a
fund
in
place
.
as
I
mention
previously
,
such
activity
be
not
subject
to
prudential
supervision
by
any
public
authority
,
and
whereas
the
European
Community
(
consumer
credit
agreement
)
regulation
2010
,
in
amend
the
consumer
credit
Act
1995
,
bring
a
small
number
of
society
under
the
supervision
of
the
Central
Bank
for
loan
purpose
,
I
be
of
the
opinion
that
society
not
already
active
in
this
field
should
not
be
permit
to
extend
they
remit
.
it
be
very
important
from
a
consumer
protection
view
that
the
provision
of
loan
to
individual
should
be
a
regulate
activity
.
it
be
not
desirable
that
society
should
be
in
the
business
of
make
loan
without
reasonable
protection
be
afford
to
the
individual
accept
the
loan
,
and
this
be
generally
accept
by
society
themselves
,
as
only
three
of
the
47
currently
operate
loan
fund
.
the
section
effectively
provide
that
where
a
friendly
society
do
not
at
the
time
of
the
passing
of
this
Bill
operate
a
loan
fund
as
provide
under
section
46
of
the
friendly
Society
Act
1896
,
such
a
society
may
not
establish
a
loan
fund
after
the
come
into
operation
of
the
Bill
.
it
do
not
affect
the
operation
of
a
exist
society
currently
operate
a
loan
fund
.
the
Senator
mention
the
supervisory
regime
or
lack
thereof
.
nobody
in
this
house
of
the
Oireachtas
would
disagree
with
the
Senator
's
critique
of
the
lack
of
supervision
.
there
be
no
question
or
ambiguity
about
that
but
for
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
it
be
important
to
note
that
we
be
seek
to
move
to
a
situation
whereby
one
recognise
the
47
that
be
in
existence
and
that
that
have
loan
fund
,
but
one
ensure
that
the
change
to
the
legislation
be
be
make
as
a
preliminary
step
in
the
process
of
establish
a
system
of
the
most
appropriate
supervision
of
certain
exist
society
,
especially
operate
in
the
area
of
financial
service
provision
.
that
be
the
etho
under
which
we
be
try
to
introduce
the
legislation
.
it
be
intend
that
the
group
of
society
would
be
subject
to
Central
Bank
supervision
and
that
this
would
be
the
close
group
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
.
I
do
not
think
anybody
in
the
House
would
disagree
with
he
on
he
critique
of
the
system
up
to
now
but
what
we
be
seek
to
do
be
to
ensure
the
system
be
fit
for
purpose
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
this
friendly
society
go
back
to
the
19th
century
and
there
be
a
particular
etho
around
they
.
the
Senator
speak
to
my
own
geographical
area
of
north
Cork
.
I
remember
name
such
as
Nora
Herlihy
and
Horace
Plunkett
among
other
that
be
synonymous
with
movement
such
as
this
.
we
do
not
seek
to
lose
sight
of
that
either
but
what
we
want
to

provide
for
the

year
a

it
be
know

the

have
seek
the
abolition
of

argue
that
the

be
out
of

too
quickly
to
be
useful
,
and
impose
a
unnecessary
administrative
burden
on

there

general
agreement
that
the

,
accordingly
,
it

propose
to

the
removal
of
the

be
balance
by
the

this

information
be
therefore
available

basis
,
which
would
render

unnecessary
.

and
deliver
power
-
share
government
for
the
people
of

.
without
doubt
,
there
have
be
significant
political
challenge
over

include

.
as

the

be

take
together
with
the
other
institution
establish
under
the
agreement
,
include
the
North
-
South
ministerial

and
the
British

Irish

,
this
be
the
appropriate
fora
in
which
to
further
lasting
peace
,
stability
and
reconciliation
,
as
the
Forum
for
Peace
and

have
do
previously
over
a
number
of

.
the
good

set
out
the
guide
principle
for

in

,
namely
,
devolution
,
power

share
,
agreement
on

,
support
for
the
rule
of

and
the
continue
share
responsibility
of

principle
.
however
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
full
potential

as
be

in

in
particular
,
many

share
the
view
that
the
establishment
of
such
a
forum
would
stimulate
more
inform
public

on

,
North

.
for
that
reason
,
the

the
political

institutional

have
change
significantly
since
.
since

,
the
Northern

executive
and
the
Northern
Ireland
Assembly
have
be
operate
and
deliver
power
-
share
government
for
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
.
without
doubt
,
there
have
be
significant
political
challenge
over
the
period
since
,
include
in
recent
week
and
month
.
as
we
commit
to
at
the
time
of

,
the
responsibility
and
priority
of

,

,
be
to
support

share

face
the
challenge
of

the
additional
challenge
of
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
trouble
.
take
together
with
the
other
institution
establish
under
the
agreement
,
include
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
and
the
British
-
Irish
Council
,
this
be
the
appropriate
fora
in
which
to
further
lasting
peace
,
stability
and
reconciliation
,
as
the
Forum
for
Peace
and
Reconciliation
have
do
previously
over
a
number
of
year
.
the
good
Friday
agreement
set
out
the
guide
principle
for
peace
,
stability
and
reconciliation
in
Northern
Ireland
,
namely
,
devolution
,
power
-
share
,
agreement
on
sovereignty
,
human
rights
,
parity
of
esteem
,
support
for
the
rule
of
law
and
the
continue
share
responsibility
of
the
two
government
to
guarantee
this
principle
.
however
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
full
potential
of

have
yet
to
be
reach

as
be
the
case
in

a
Irish
language
Act

.
in

of
the
North

South

in
particular
,
many
member
will
share
the
view
that
the
establishment
of
such
a
forum
would
stimulate
more
inform
public
debate
on
key
societal
challenge
,
North
and
South
.
for
that
reason
,
the
government
will
continue
to
press
for
its
establishment
as
a
essential
part
of
the
framework
to
deliver

,
there

,
this
be
the

,
as
the

the

reason
,
the

to

however
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
full
potential
of

agreement
have
yet
to
be
reach
.
as
be
the
case
in

comprehensive
political
agreement
,
full

be
essential
to
the
integrity
and

in

would
stimulate

the

while
I
greatly
appreciate
the
sentiment
and
concern
behind
Senator

the

believe
the

the

have
be
hard

will

rather
than
deliver
the
speech
circulate
,
I
will
cut
straight
to
the
point
with
regard
to
St.
Paul
's
secondary
school
.
Gabhaim
míle
buíochas
leis
a
Seanadóir
as
a
gcuireadh

I

this
issue

I

replace
its

permanent

,
which
will

the

I
also
wish

scheme
,
with

.
this
work

should
ensure
the
medium

meet
.
I
thank
the
Senator
again
for

I
a
opportunity
to
clarify
the
current
position
on
St.
Paul
's
secondary
school

I
thank
the
Senator
for
put
forward
the
amendment
.
section
5
,
which
the
Senator
be
propose
to
amend
,
provide
for
a
significant
change
to
the
friendly
Society
Act
1896
.
that
be
the
cessation
of
registration
of
any
new
society
under
section
8
of
the
legislation
.
the
rationale
for
the
change
,
as
I
set
out
on
second
and
Committee
Stage
,
be
twofold
.
first
,
the
lack
of
demand
for
the
friendly
society
model
,
evidence
by
the
fact
that
there
have
be
just
three
new
entrant
in
the
past
nine
year
.
that
give
a
clear
indication
that
the
friendly
society
model
be
no
long
favour
by
newly
-
establish
organisation
.
second
,
current
legislation
do
not
provide
for
prudential
supervision
of
friendly
society
by
any
public
authority
.
this
be
a
source
of
some
concern
because
there
be
some
potential
risk
to
the
interest
of
certain
member
of
the
public
where
society
offer
financial
service
.
section
8
the
1896
act
set
out
the
type
of
society
that
may
be
register
.
there
be
currently
nothing
in
the
section
which
would
preclude
a
society
from
seek
the
authorisation
of
the
Central
Bank
,
under
the
Central
Bank
and
Financial
Service
act
2003
,
to
carry
on
a
regulate
business
as
define
in
that
act
.
the
Central
Bank
act
provide
specific
exemption
for
friendly
society
from
the
requirement
that
relate
to
banking
.
under
section
7
and
8
of
the
Central
Bank
Act
1971
a
friendly
society
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
hold
a
banking
licence
.
under
section
29
(
a
)
of
the
Central
Bank
Act
1997
,
a
friendly
society
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
hold
a
authorisation
as
a
retail
credit
firm
.
I
believe
,
therefore
,
that
the
amendment
be
unnecessary
,
and
do
not
add
to
the
act
in
term
of
clarity
.
there
be
no
reference
to
a
"
regulate
business
"
in
the
friendly
Society
Act
and
no
definition
of
what
be
intend
by
the
term
.
introduce
such
a
concept
in
the
manner
propose
by
the
amendment
be
not
practical
.
far
,
the
amendment
as
draft
refer
to
"
a
person
who
wish
to
carry
on
a
regulate
business
"
when
the
act
refer
to
society
,
not
person
.
in
the
circumstance
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
because
I
do
not
believe
it
to
be
a
workable
amendment
,
as
currently
constitute
.
section
6
,
which
the
Senator
be
propose
to
amend
,
place
restriction
on
exist
society
establish
a
loan
fund
,
as
provide
for
in
section
46
of
the
principal
friendly
Society
act
1896
where
they
do
not
already
have
such
a
fund
in
place
.
the
change
will
not
have
a
impact
on
exist
society
that
have
a
fund
in
place
.
this
amount
to
three
society
at
present
.
the
rationale
behind
the
change
,
as
mention
on
Committee
Stage
and
on
second
Stage
,
be
that
such
activity
where
it
be
operate
by
any
other
body
,
be
subject
to
prudential
supervision
by
the
Central
Bank
.
there
be
no
prudential
supervision
by
any
public
authority
in
the
case
of
a
friendly
society
.
while
the
number
of
friendly
society
operate
a
loan
fund
be
very
small
,
it
be
not
in
the
interest
of
the
member
of
friendly
society
that
new
fund
be
permit
to
be
establish
without
appropriate
prudential
supervision
.
I
hope
that
address
the
essential
spirit
of
the
overarching
point
make
by
Senator
Barrett
.
in
section
6
,
we
aim
be
to
prevent
friendly
society
-
apart
from
the
small
number
already
engage
in
such
activity
-
from
operate
a
loan
fund
that
be
not
subject
to
prudential
supervision
.
the
exception
provide
be
to
allow
any
application
that
may
be
in
hand
,
where
a
application
to
register
a
rule
change
have
be
pass
by
the
society
and
lodge
with
the
registrar
by
the
operative
date
,
to
progress
under
the
current
rule
so
that
it
will
not
disadvantage
a
exist
society
.
give
the
general
lack
of
interest
,
even
among
exist
society
,
in
operate
in
the
area
,
a
influx
of
society
seek
to
establish
loan
fund
be
not
anticipate
.
the
Senator
's
proposal
be
word
to
amend
section
6
and
to
require
that
"
the
formation
of
a
separate
loan
fund
"
should
receive
authorisation
under
the
Central
Bank
and
Financial
Service
Act
2003
.
this
be
not
a
workable
amendment
because
the
act
authorise
the
carry
on
of
the
financial
activity
itself
,
namely
,
the
granting
of
loan
,
not
formation
of
the
fund
.
on
that
basis
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
.
section
8
,
which
the
Senator
be
propose
to
amend
,
remove
the
restriction
in
the
current
act
provide
that
the
registrar
must
be
absent
for
the
power
,
function
and
duty
to
be
exercise
and
perform
by
such
other
person
as
the
minister
may
authorise
,
and
allow
another
person
to
act
alongside
the
registrar
.
the
change
be
necessary
as
,
for
the
past
number
of
year
,
the
role
of
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
have
not
be
a
dedicated
role
,
but
have
be
fulfil
by
the
Registrar
of
company
in
addition
to
she
exist
duty
.
the
amendment
propose
by
the
Senator
,
which
I
understand
seek
to
transfer
power
of
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
to
the
Central
Bank
,
will
not
operate
as
intend
by
the
Senator
because
section
5
of
the
1977
Act
set
out
power
of
the
minister
with
regard
to
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
and
not
the
power
of
the
registrar
.
there
be
a
reference
to
the
power
,
function
and
duty
of
the
registrar
in
section
5
but
it
relate
to
who
may
be
authorise
by
the
minister
to
perform
this
power
,
rather
than
set
out
the
power
themselves
.
section
6
of
the
1977
act
do
relate
to
a
specific
power
regard
cancellation
of
the
registration
of
society
but
,
as
I
do
not
believe
it
to
be
the
intention
of
the
Senator
in
draft
this
amendment
to
transfer
power
solely
relate
to
cancellation
of
society
to
the
Central
Bank
,
I
do
not
accept
the
amendment
.
it
be
intend
to
examine
further
with
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Department
of
Finance
the
issue
of
appropriate
prudential
supervision
for
friendly
society
.
at
present
the
power
to
exercise
such
supervision
do
not
exist
under
the
friendly
society
legislation
and
therefore
appropriate
power
must
be
put
in
place
.
no
exist
power
can
be
simply
transfer
.
it
be
consider
that
the
good
place
to
address
the
matter
be
under
the
Central
Bank
Act
rather
than
the
friendly
Society
Act
.
I
wish
to
restate
what
I
say
on
previous
stage
.
the
friendly
Society
act
do
not
confer
corporate
status
on
society
or
limited
liability
on
member
.
the
evidence
in
recent
year
be
that
it
have
become
common
practice
for
many
charity
and
club
to
register
as
limited
company
.
I
hope
to
give
some
confidence
to
Senator
Barrett
in
address
the
point
he
have
make
by
reiterate
that
the
most
realistic
institutional
option
for
introduce
a
appropriate
system
of
supervision
be
the
Central
Bank
,
which
be
at
the
centre
of
financial
supervision
and
financial
stability
oversight
.
it
have
a
responsibility
to
provide
in
a
fully
integrated
and
co-ordinate
manner
for
the
prudential
supervision
and
stability
of
all
financial
service
within
the
financial
system
as
a
whole
.
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
other
body
move
into
this
unregulated
area
it
be
decide
to
close
registration
to
new
friendly
society
.
I
wish
to
take
a
few
brief
moment
to
thank
the
Member
for
they
contribution
to
the
debate
.
in
particular
,
I
thank
that
Senator
who
put
down
amendment
.
I
assure
they
that
the
area
of
financial
prudential
supervision
be
something
that
be
be
take
seriously
.
this
be
well
carry
out
through
the
Central
Bank
Act
.
while
I
be
not
accept
the
amendment
I
hope
we
have
address
adequately
the
substantive
issue
in
the
legislation
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
they
co-operation
and
they
time
.
I
be
speak
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
who
be
unable
to
be
present
as
she
be
attend
a
meeting
of
EU
justice
and
Home
affair
minister
in
Luxembourg
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
important
matter
and
acknowledge
the
consistency
with
which
he
have
advocate
on
it
.
as
the
minister
recently
announce
,
a
independent
review
group
have
be
establish

undertake

of
the
Department
's
current
structure
,
system
,
management
and
capability
.
in
make
its
recommendation
the
group
will
have
regard
to
the
policy
,
legal
,
institutional
and
resource
framework
within
which
the
Department
work
.
it
will
also
draw
on
international
good
practice
regard
the
organisational
structure
,
skill
,
training
and
level
require
by
the
Department
in
order
that
it
can
fulfil
its
role
and
responsibility
.
it
may
engage
additional
expertise
to
help
with
its
work
,
as
it
see
fit
.
base
on
the
conclusion
and
lesson
draw
from
this
assessment
,
it
will
make
recommendation
to
the
minister
who
have
already
comment
that
she
believe
the
report
will
be
a
important
signpost
on
the
path
to
reform
and
enable
the
Department
to
build
on
its
considerable
strength
and
fully
address
area
that
need
improvement
.
before
I
comment
on
the
specific
case
refer
to
by
the
Senator
,
I
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
the
minister
do
not
wish
in
any
way
to
pre-empt
the
work
of
the
independent
review
group
or
how
it
will
focus
its
effort
in
the
light
of
its
term
of
reference
.
at
this
stage
,
she
would
simply
reflect
that
it
be
not
anticipate
that
the
independent
review
group
would
necessarily
be
the
good
means
to
address
the
detail
of
specific
case
such
as
the
one
refer
to
,
although
its
finding
will
,
of
course
,
be
relevant
to
how
the
range
of
the
Department
's
function
be
deliver
.
the
Department
be
not
aware
of
any
question
have
arise
relate
to
the
Department
in
the
context
of
the
case
refer
to
by
the
Senator
.
it
,
of
course
,
be
not
involved
in
the
investigation
of
criminal
offence
.
the
Garda
Commissioner
previously
direct
that
a
examination
be
carry
out
of
the
procedure
surround
the
handling
of
the
complaint
against
the
person
in
question
.
the
minister
be
advise
by
the
Garda
authority
that
a
review
have
be
complete
of
a
number
of
complaint
make
against
the
person
concerned
.
however
,
further
information
have
recently
be
provide
for
the
Garda
and
this
have
necessitate
further
examination
by
gardaí
before
the
review
can
be
finalise
.
the
minister
be
advise
that
this
process
be
ongoing
.
the
minister
wish
to
assure
the
Senator
that
the
need
to
learn
from
past
child
protection
failure
be
a
priority
for
she
and
the
government
.
this
be
reflect
in
the
transformation
of
child
protection
arrangement
which
have
take
place
since
the
government
take
office
.
in
particular
,
the
Senator
will
be
aware
of
the
recent
publication
by
the
minister
when
she
be
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
of
the
Children
first
Bill
2014
which
will
,
for
the
first
time
,
provide
for
key
element
of
the
Children
first
guideline
to
be
put
on
a
statutory
basis
.
this
build
on
other
significant
legislative
and
administrative
measure
which
have
be
put
in
place
in
recent
year
to
well
protect
child
.
in
the
light
of
the
minister
's
clear
commitment
in
this
regard
,
she
will
be
ask
the
acting
Garda
Commissioner
to
ensure
the
review
in
question
be
complete
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
again
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
issue
.
I
will
convey
he
comment
during
this
debate
to
the
minister
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
.
I
will
convey
this
concern
to
the
minister
on
he
behalf
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
issue
.
as
a
minister
of
State
in
the
relevant
Department
,
I
be
acutely
aware
of
the
predicament
in
which
that
school
community
find
itself
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
inform
the
House
that
I
be
not
go
to
read
directly
from
the
prepare
script
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
Firhouse
Educate
together
school
be
establish
to
service
a
specific
demographic
demand
within
the
Firhouse
area
.
the
Senator
refer
to
the
South
Dublin
County
Council
plan
,
etc.
,
and
in
that
context
,
the
school
should
ideally
have
a
permanent
home
within
or
as
close
to
the
geographical
area
in
which
it
be
currently
locate
as
possible
in
order
to
meet
people
's
need
.
a
process
be
ongoing
whereby
official
from
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
be
work
with
they
counterpart
in
South
Dublin
County
Council
in
order
to
acquire
a
suitable
site
.
in
the
context
of
the
Department
's
geographical
information
system
and
analysis
,
the
Ballycullen
-
Oldcourt
area
be
consider
a
separate
and
distinct
geographical
area
.
the
local
area
plan
for
Ballycullen
-
Oldcourt
refer
to
the
plan
future
additional
population
.
this
mean
that
the
area
will
have
educational
infrastructural
requirement
in
its
own
right
should
the
plan
housing
development
for
it
materialise
.
I
be
give
to
understand
that
the
process
relate
to
identify
and
acquire
a
site
for
Firhouse
Educate
together
be
ongoing
.
the
Senator
indicate
that
she
previously
raise
this
matter
last
November
.
it
have
be
my
experience
that
the
process
of
acquire
land
tend
to
be
open
-
end
in
nature
.
it
be
very
difficult
,
for
example
,
to
put
in
place
sunset
clause
in
respect
of
the
acquisition
of
land
or
to
disregard
the
commercial
sensitivity
involve
.
the
process
be
ongoing
and
due
to
the
kind
of
commercial
sensitivity
to
which
I
refer
,
it
be
not
possible
to
provide
further
information
at
this
time
.
I
be
sure
the
Senator
have
hear
that
before
and
I
do
not
wish
to
offer
she
any
platitude
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
I
be
aware
,
however
,
from
my
dealing
with
the
official
in
the
Department
,
that
when
interact
with
local
authority
,
there
be
a
process
which
must
be
undergyne
.
the
process
be
not
seamless
and
can
involve
many
twist
and
turn
.
that
will
come
as
no
comfort
to
Senator
Keane
in
the
context
of
she
attempt
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
people
who
make
representation
to
she
.
I
assure
she
that
I
will
raise
the
matter
with
the
relevant
official
in
the
Department
and
that
I
will
exert
as
much
pressure
as
possible
in
the
context
of
establish
the
current
position
.
I
accept
that
point
and
I
recognise
that
Firhouse
Educate
together
be
currently
occupy
temporary
accommodation
,
which
be
certainly
not
ideal
.
I
have
come
across
situation
such
as
this
previously
whereby
schoolchild
be
be
oblige
to
learn
in
what
can
only
be
describe
as
Dickensian
condition
while
they
await
the
provision
of
permanent
accommodation
.
I
wish
to
give
Senator
Keane
a
undertaking
to
the
effect
that
I
will
raise
this
matter
within
the
Department
.
I
must
point
out
,
however
,
that
it
be
not
only
in
respect
of
the
acquisition
of
privately
-
own
land
that
sensitivity
arise
.
I
take
the
Senator
's
point
regard
the
upward
trajectory
of
property
price
in
the
Dublin
area
.
however
,
sensitivity
also
arise
when
land
be
be
transfer
from
one
public
body
,
local
authority
or
state
entity
to
another
.
there
be
many
legality
which
must
be
deal
with
in
that
context
.
regardless
of
whether
it
be
a
private
or
public
entity
involve
,
the
process
be
not
seamless
.
as
a
result
,
the
acquisition
of
a
suitable
site
be
take
some
time
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
.
I
will
bring
the
point
make
by
Senator
Keane
to
the
attention
of
the
official
within
the
Department
.
I
thank
Senator
Bradford
for
raise
this
issue
.
the
criterion
use
for
the
allocation
of
teacher
to
school
be
publish
annually
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
in
regard
to
budget
2012
,
whereby
as
part
of
that
budget
there
be
a
phase
increase
in
the
number
of
pupil
require
to
gain
and
retain
a
classroom
teaching
post
in
small
primary
school
with
four
teacher
or
less
.
the
current
system
operate
on
the
basis
of
a
general
average
of
one
classroom
teacher
for
every
28
pupil
,
with
low
threshold
for
DEIS
band
1
school
.
I
have
not
see
the
correspondence
Senator
Bradford
refer
to
,
but
I
acknowledge
pressure
be
be
bring
to
bear
in
term
of
the
classroom
experience
,
both
for
pupil
and
for
teacher
.
I
acknowledge
also
that
budgetary
measure
take
in
2012
bring
pressure
,
a
result
of
macro-economic
factor
.
the
Department
have
expand
the
exist
appeal
process
so
that
it
be
accessible
to
the
school
that
be
affect
by
the
budget
measure
.
small
school
will
not
lose
they
classroom
post
if
they
project
sustainable
increase
enrolment
in
September
2014
that
would
be
sufficient
to
allow
they
to
retain
they
exist
classroom
post
over
the
long
term
.
we
be
all
aware
of
the
appeal
process
and
the
staffing
circular
and
the
process
involve
.
I
acknowledge
the
general
point
be
make
by
the
Senator
that
we
must
ensure
there
be
a
role
for
small
school
within
rural
community
.
both
he
and
I
hail
from
the
same
region
and
such
community
.
the
Department
have
take
a
conscious
decision
to
ensure
that
school
which
have
no
inward
investment
for
many
year
,
for
example
,
in
regard
to
capital
expenditure
and
brick
and
mortar
,
be
see
investment
.
project
be
now
go
on
throughout
we
region
and
the
country
to
replace
prefab
with
brick
and
mortar
.
this
be
part
of
try
to
make
the
experience
for
student
and
school
community
good
.
in
rural
area
,
this
school
be
the
institution
underpin
the
community
.
the
Senator
will
be
aware
that
a
value
for
money
review
be
conduct
on
small
primary
school
.
the
review
take
account
of
the
etho
of
school
and
of
they
location
relative
to
other
similar
school
.
we
be
currently
consider
the
value
for
money
review
,
in
consultation
with
government
colleague
,
and
it
be
intend
to
publish
the
report
on
completion
of
the
consideration
process
.
we
be
very
mindful
of
the
point
raise
by
Senator
Bradford
in
regard
to
the
budget
2012
measure
.
we
seek
to
ensure
we
have
a
sustainable
model
for
the
future
,
but
I
acknowledge
there
be
challenge
in
that
regard
.
the
minister
have
have
initial
discussion
with
the
Catholic
primary
Schools
Management
Association
,
CPSMA
,
and
the
Irish
National
teacher
Organisation
in
regard
to
they
proposal
on
the
issue
of
primary
school
consolidation
and
reorganisation
.
we
acknowledge
that
some
48
small
school
have
have
a
reduction
in
enrolment
,
which
mean
that
for
September
2014
they
will
lose
a
teacher
.
we
acknowledge
this
loss
would
not
have
occur
if
the
pre-budget
2012
enrolment
threshold
still
apply
and
if
the
threshold
for
a
two
-
teacher
school
have
remain
at
12
pupil
.
we
acknowledge
the
constraint
that
exist
currently
.
however
,
the
value
for
money
review
be
under
consideration
and
will
be
publish
.
speak
personally
,
I
will
advocate
strongly
for
assurance
to
be
give
on
the
future
of
school
and
for
consultation
and
engagement
with
stakeholder
in
a
meaningful
process
of
dialogue
which
will
ensure
a
future
for
this
school
.
then
we
can
begin
to
address
the
dynamic
the
Senator
outline
in
regard
to
the
new
pressure
that
exist
in
particular
school
and
classroom
as
economic
circumstance
improve
.

.
I
be
pleased
to
bring
the
company
Bill
2012
before
the
Seanad
today
.
the
Bill
as
present
represent
a
landmark
legislative
project
,
which
be
the
result
of
many
year
of
detailed
and
comprehensive
work
by
official
in
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
and
the
Office
of
the
Parliamentary
counsel
to
the
government
.
it
be
the
large
substantive
Bill
in
the
history
of
the
State
,
spread
out
over
25
part
,
17
schedule
and
comprise
1436
section
.
we
get
through
this
in
two
day
on
Committee
Stage
in
the
Dáil
,
and
I
hope
that
signal
how
it
might
be
deal
with
in
this
House
.
it
be
recognise
at
a
early
stage
of
the
process
that
a
mere
consolidation
of
the
exist
company
act
would
be
too
limit
in
light
of
the
reform
necessary
to
sustain
Irish
competitiveness
with
respect
to
company
law
.
instead
,
a
overhaul
and
restructuring
of
the
company
law
framework
be
embark
upon
.
the
result
be
a
Bill
that
provide
a
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
framework
for
all
business
operate
in
Ireland
,
whether
domestic
or
foreign
and
irrespective
of
size
.
the
principal
objective
of
the
Bill
be
to
restructure
,
consolidate
,
simplify
and
modernise
company
law
in
Ireland
and
in
do
so
improve
Ireland
's
competitive
position
as
a
location
for
business
investment
.
this
reform
seek
to
ensure
a
balance
between
simplify
the
day
-
to
-
day
running
of
a
business
,
maintain
the
necessary
protection
for
that
deal
with
company
,
such
as
creditor
and
investor
,
and
put
in
place
a
effective
corporate
governance
regime
to
ensure
compliance
.
any
modernisation
and
reform
of
company
law
must
be
view
against
the
backdrop
of
the
fact
that
limited
liability
itself
be
a
concession
by
the
State
to
business
,
and
must
therefore
be
temper
by
robust
regulation
to
protect
creditor
's
interest
.
in
make
company
law
more
accessible
,
more
coherent
and
more
reflective
of
actual
business
practice
,
Ireland
's
international
competitiveness
will
improve
and
ordinary
business
and
company
throughout
the
country
will
find
it
easy
to
establish
and
operate
.
however
,
by
simplify
the
law
and
make
it
more
intelligible
,
it
be
not
intend
to
water
down
compliance
.
in
fact
if
the
law
be
more
accessible
,
it
be
more
likely
to
ensure
respect
and
compliance
.
it
be
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
last
major
review
and
consolidation
of
Irish
company
law
be
in
the
lead
-
up
to
the
company
Act
1963
,
more
than
50
year
ago
.
since
then
there
have
be
17
amending
act
and
15
statutory
instrument
,
which
be
require
to
be
read
as
one
with
the
principal
act
.
in
that
time
,
Ireland
have
take
on
EU
obligation
on
the
harmonisation
of
law
,
and
this
have
inevitably
add
to
the
volume
and
complexity
of
Irish
company
law
.
therefore
,
the
Bill
seek
to
break
company
law
down
into
distinct
principle
and
area
and
to
remove
or
lessen
the
administrative
burden
where
possible
and
appropriate
,
bear
in
mind
that
the
public
interest
will
sometimes
require
the
introduction
of
additional
regulation
.
this
development
will
bring
Irish
company
law
into
the
21st
century
and
ensure
Ireland
maintain
a
competitive
edge
as
one
of
the
good
place
in
Europe
,
and
indeed
the
world
,
in
which
to
do
business
.
the
Bill
be
the
culmination
of
14
year
of
work
by
my
Department
and
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
,
CLRG

such

have
be

each

have

many
of
this

form
the
basis
of
the
amendment
put
forward
during
the
Bill
's
passage
through
the
Dail
.
in
all
,
more
than
400
amendment
be
carry
during
Committee
and
report
Stage
.
while
this
be
a
large
volume
,
it
be
worth
note
that
this
amendment
do
not
seek
to
change
either
the
policy
or
the
structure
of
the
Bill
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
generally
to
bring
about
technical
and
practical
improvement
.
it
be
clear
that
the
development
of
this
Bill
have
,
at
every
stage
,
involve
extensive
input
from
a
wide
variety
of
source
and
I
thank
sincerely
the
member
of
the
CLRG
,
as
well
as
the
many
other
individual
and
group
,
who
have
contribute
to
this
hugely
collaborative
project
.
turn
now
to
the
Bill
itself
,
one
of
the
strike
feature
be
the
general
structure
it
have
adopt
.
for
the
first
time
in
Irish
company
law
,
the
most
common
company
type
,
the
private
company
limit
by
share
,
be
place
at
the
core
of
the
legislation
as
the
default
company
.
by
adopt
this
structure
the
Bill
acknowledge
the
practical
reality
that
almost
90
%
of
the
company
currently
register
at
the
company
Registration
Office
be
private
company
limit
by
share
.
in
addition
the
Bill
rectify
the
anomaly
in
the
current
legislation
that
presuppose
that
the
public
limited
company
,
PLC
,
be
at
the
centre
of
corporate
life
in
Ireland
.
in
reality
few
than
1
%
of
company
be
register
as
plc
.
the
result
be
that
the
architecture
of
the
company
law
code
be
now
recalibrate
to
reflect
the
true
landscape
of
enterprise
in
the
State
.
there
be
world
of
difference
between
the
one
person
private
company
form
by
a
tradesperson
and
the
large
publicly
list
limited
company
.
to
ensure
great
accessibility
to
the
new
company
law
code
,
the

the
private

the
new
limited
company
,
as
it
be
.
in

with
the
objective
of
ensure
the
law
be
clearly
accessible
,
the

the
life
cycle
of
the
company
,

with
the
incorporation
of
a
company
,

to
its

and
finally

Volume

,
which
contain

16
to
25
,
inclusive
,
and
the
Schedules
,

out
the
other
type
of

and
how
the
law

this

be
the
designate

company
,
DAC
,
the
public
limited
company
,
PLC
,
the
guarantee
company
,
CLG
,
the
unlimited
company
,
the
unregistered
company
and
the
investment
company
.
there
be
legitimate
user
of
all
the
different
company
type
set
out
in
the
Bill
and
it
be
imperative
that
Irish
company
law
should
facilitate
all
type
of
enterprise
and
the
wide
commercial
community
by
make
appropriate
provision
for
this
different
company
type
.
return
to
the
new
model
private
limited
company
,
the
Bill
contain
a
number
of
significant
innovation
and
reform
for
this
company
type
.
first
,
this
company
type
will
have
the
same
legal
capacity
as
a
natural
person
.
the
current
ultra
vire
rule
do
not
apply
to
this
new
company
type
.
the
ultra
vire
rule
be
the
legal
doctrine
whereby
a
company
must
have
what
be
know
as
a
object
clause
in
its
memorandum
of
association
.
remove
the
need
for
a
object
clause
will
both
ease
the
administrative
burden
on
company
and
provide
certainty
to
third
party
,
such
as
lender
,
who
will
no
long
have
to
examine
extensive
object
clause
to
determine
whether
a
company
be
act
within
its
power
.
this
company
type
will
be
allow
to
have
only
one
director
.
under
the
current
law
,
a
company
must
have
at
least
two
director
and
even
if
one
person
wish
to
establish
a
business
as
a
company
on
he
or
she
own
,
he
or
she
need
to
find
a
additional
person
to
act
as
the
second
director
.
remove
this
requirement
will
make
it
easy
to
start
a
new
business
.
the
new
limited
company
can
have
a
minimum
of
one
member
and
a
maximum
of
149
member
.
the
149
member
upper
limit
be
link
to
the
requirement
of
EU
prospectus
law
,
which
govern
the
offer
of
share
to
the
public
.
the
new
limited
company
will
have
a
single
document
constitution
,
in
contrast
to
the
current
law
whereby
every
company
must
have
two
document
,
a
memorandum
of
association
and
separate
article
of
association
.
the
new
limited
company
will
no
long
be
oblige
to
go
through
the
formality
of
hold
a
physical
annual
general
meeting
,
AGM
,
where
all
the
member
have
to
convene
in
one
location
at
the
same
time
on
a
annual
basis
.
instead
the
member
will
be
able
to
hold
a
write
agm
,
whereby
all
the
matter
which
must
be
deal
with
at
the
agm
can
be
approve
by
write
procedure
.
the
Bill
contain
a
codify
version
of
the
fiduciary
duty
to
which
director
be
currently
subject
by
a
combination
of
the
common
law
and
statutory
provision
.
this
bring
all
of
this
duty
together
in
a
single
identifiable
place
,
make
it
easy
for
director
to
understand
they
responsibility
and
more
difficult
to
deny
they
existence
.
this
also
address
one
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Moriarty
report
on
company
law
.
the
Bill
contain
what
be
know
as
a
summary
approval
procedure
,
which
be
applicable
to
a
number
of
activity
,
for
example
,
the
reduction
of
capital
,
which
under
the
current
law
might
require
the
company
to
undertake
the
burdensome
and
expensive
process
of
secure
court
approval
.
the
new
summary
approval
procedure
incorporate
safeguard
on
director
's
liability
in
circumstance
where
the
procedure
be
use
without
proper
justification
.
additionally
,
there
be
a
number
of
innovation
which
will
apply
to
other
company
type
.
for
example
,
part
20
enable
any
company
to
convert
from
its
exist
company
type
to
any
other
company
type
that
can
be
form
under
the
Bill
.
this
be
in
contrast
to
the
current
law
which
contain
restriction
on
conversion
.
this
provide
flexibility
and
great
option
to
company
which
face
a
change
in
they
circumstance
.
for
the
first
time
,
guarantee
company
will
be
able
to
avail
of
the
audit
exemption
.
this
innovation
will
be
of
significant
benefit
to
the
sector
which
tend
to
use
the
guarantee
company
structure
,
for
example
company
in
the
voluntary
sector
,
charity
and
residential
management
company
,
while
at
the
same
time
recognise
the
particular
circumstance
apply
to
guarantee
company
in
allow
a
single
member
to
object
.
move
on
from
the
key
innovation
,
I
now
turn
to
the
amendment
pass
by
Dáil
Éireann
.
as
I
mention
early
,
a
large
number
of
amendment
have
be
pass
and
,
due
to
the
volume
,
it
be
not
possible
to
cover
each
one
.
however
,
I
will
briefly
touch
on
some
of
the
more
significant
.
there
be
now
a
explicit
prohibition
on
bearer
share
.
this
will
enhance
Ireland
's
reputation
as
a
country
which
be
play
its
part
in
the
international
movement
against
money
-
laundering
.
in
a
wind
-
up
,
company
book
and
paper
must
be
retain
for
six
year
,
rather
than
three
year
,
after
the
dissolution
of
the
company
.
this
bring
Ireland
in
line
with
good
practice
internationally
.
it
also
make
it
easy
for
authority
such
as
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
or
the
ODCE
,
to
investigate
potentially
fraudulent
or
criminal
activity
.
there
have
be
a
significant
increase
in
the
minimum
share
capital
threshold
for
company
that
wish
to
appoint
restricted
person
as
a
director
.
in
addition
to
that
measure
design
to
reduce
white
-
collar
crime
,
other
amendment
have
focus
on
the
modernisation
and
efficiency
of
company
law
.
such
change
include
permit
company
to
use
cloud
computing
solution
for
keep
record
;
modernise
some
provision
regard
service
of
notice
;
and
clarify
certain
power
of
director
upfront
in
the
Bill
in
order
to
avoid
every
company
have
to
change
they
constitution
individually
.
I
now
turn
to
the
substance
of
the
Bill
.
due
to
the
unprecedented
size
of
the
Bill
,
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
detailed
explanation
for
each
of
the
1436
section
.
instead
,
I
will
give
a
overview
of
the
25
constituent
part
,
along
the
way
highlight
any
significant
change
to
the
law
and
explain
the
policy
behind
this
change
.
the
supplementary
information
provide
to
the
Senator
contain
a
more
detailed
overview
at
chapter
-
by
-
chapter
level
.
part

of

and
be
largely

to
housekeeping
.
it
set
out
the
structure
and
define
term
which
be
use
throughout
the
Bill
.
part
2
make
provision
for
the
incorporation
and
registration
of
the
new
model
private
company
limit
by
share
-
the
new
LTD
company
-
and
provide
that
any
one
or
more
person
may
form
such
a
company
.
the
most
significant
aspect
of
this
part
be
the
provision
for
the
conversion
of
a
exist
private
company
limit
by
share
to
a
new
model
private
company
limit
by

.
if
the
company
choose
to
opt
for
the
new
regime

company
that
do
not
elect
to

will
not
be
able
to
avail
of
the
many
advantage
associate
with
the

such
as
the
ability
to
have
only
one

,
the

constitution
and
the
possibility
to
avoid
have
a
physical
agm
.
however
,
the
new
limited
company
will
not
suit
all
business
activity
.
therefore
,
a
company
be
entitle
to
opt
out
of
the
new
regime
and
can
do
so
by
convert
to
a
designate

company
,
or
other

type

part

Senator
hear
it
here
first
.
the
primary
define
feature
of
a
dac
will
be
the
continue
existence
of
a
object
clause
in
the
constitution
of
the
company
.
it
be
envisage
that
entity
which
would
welcome
the
dac
include
special
purpose
company
,
for
example
,
that
incorporate
for
joint
venture
or
for
use
in
a
financing
transaction
.
however
,
the
Bill
do
not
restrict
the
availability
of
dac
to
person
engage
in
such
activity
.
part
17
be
concerned
with
public
limited
company
,
plc
.
the
key
difference
between
public
limited
company
and
private
company
be
that
only
plc
will
be
permit
to
list
they
share
on
a
stock
exchange
and
offer
they
to
the
public
.
a

be
now

have
as
little

there
be
no
maximum
number
on
the
membership
of
such
a

a

part
.
part
18
provide
for

,
CLG
,

capital
.
since
guarantee
company

not

a
share
capital
,
they
be
a
popular
type
of
company
for
charity
,
sport
and
social
club
and
management
company
.
a
CLG
may
be
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
use
such
a
suffix
to
its
name
,
for
example
,
if
it
have
a
charitable
object
.
the
audit
exemption
be
now
be
extend
to
guarantee
company
under
the
Bill
,
if
it
fulfil
the
criterion
for
a
small
company
.
it
be
expect
that
this
will
benefit
the
many
guarantee
company
that
be
charity
or
sport
club
,
etc
.
however
,
to
ensure
probity
,
any
one
member
of
the
company
be
entitle
to
object
to
the
exemption
and
thus
force
a
company
to
carry
out
a
audit
.
part
19
provide
for

this
part
be
structure
in

by

I
commend

in
particular
with

Senator
White

to
the
importance
of
ensure
awareness
of
the
new
legislation
and
provide
education
to
the
business
community
on
the
change
and
new
requirement
.
the
company
Registration
Office
,
CRO
,
will
have
a
particularly
pivotal
role
to
play
in
the
implementation
phase
of
the
new
Bill
and
considerable
progress
be
already
under
way
in
this
regard
.
this
include
company
owner
,
formation
agent
,
company
secretarial
software
vendor
and
legal
and
accounting
practitioner
to
name
but
a
few
that
would
be
impact
by
this
reform
in
the
corporate
code
.
they
have
be
identify
and
specific
and
relevant
communication
and
update
in
preparation
for
implementation
will
be
target
by
the
cro
to
each
of
this
group
.
in
particular
,
the
CRO
be
work
with
representative
body
for
major
stakeholder
,
such
as
the
accounting
and
audit
professional
body
,
to
ensure
that
clear
and
early
information
on
this
new
code
be
available
.
Senator
White
also
refer
to
receivership
and
examinership
.
the
government
be
supportive
of
the
examinership
process
and
bring
forward
legislation
last
year
to
give
more
small
company
access
to
it
and
try
to
save
as
many
job
as
possible
.
Senator
Quinn
raise
concern
about
the
regulation
of
the
title
"
accountant
"
.
in
2007
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
,
CLRG
,
recommend
the
regulation
of
this
title
in
the
interest
of
consumer
protection
.
on
foot
of
this
the
Department
consider
the
matter
and
note
the
view
of
the
Office
of
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
and
the
Competition
Authority
.
the
Competition
Authority
take
the
strong
view
that
there
be
no
clear
public
interest
case
that
would
warrant
the
legal
protection
of
the
term
"
accountant
"
.
the
authority
note
the
statutory
regulation
of
a
title
automatically
create
barrier
to
entry
and
market
rigidity
that
can
have
negative
impact
for
service
user
.
base
on
this
consideration
,
the
fact
the
title
be
not
protect
in
the
UK
,
with
which
we
be
closely
associate
in
all
matter
relate
to
accounting
,
the
lack
of
datum
quantify
the
detriment
to
the
consumer
and
the
ongoing
discussion
of
the
EU
professional
qualification
directive
,
it
be
consider
that
the
evidence
do
not
support
the
regulation
of
the
term
"
accountant
"
.
while
it
be
clear
that
there
be
a
benefit
to
consumer
in
know
that
professional
be
fully
qualified
and
hold
appropriate
level
of
indemnity
insurance
,
consideration
must
also
be
give
to
the
potential
for
adverse
consequence
such
as
add
cost
to
business
,
increase
cost
of
regulation
and
compliance
,
barrier
to
entry
and
to
competitiveness
,
inhibition
of
the
market
and
a
threat
to
the
continue
existence
of
good
practitioner
that
do
not
meet
the
new
requirement
.
the
government
be
also
oblige
to
consider
the
principle
of
good
regulation
and
the
Competition
Authority
consider
the
issue
specifically
in
light
of
the
principle
of
necessity
,
proportionality
and
effectiveness
.
under
each
of
this
heading
the
authority
find
that
the
proposal
do
not
meet
the
requirement
of
good
regulation
.
however
,
in
light
of
the
concern
express
by
the
accounting
body
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
have
ask
official
in
we
department
to
undertake
a
assessment
of
the
issue
by
consult
with
key
stakeholder
such
as
professional
body
,
consumer
representative
,
small
business
representative
,
regulator
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
the
company
Registration
Office
and
other
official
body
with
a
interest
in
this
matter
.
member
of
the
Oireachtas
have
also
meet
the
minister
to
discuss
this
issue
.
Senator
Quinn
and
Michael
D'Arcy
speak
of
make
life
easy
for
small
business
.
we
all
wholeheartedly
support
this
and
the
Bill
be
intend
to
do
exactly
that
.
in
term
of
reduce
administrative
burden
the
Bill
will
implement
a
number
of
reform
on
red
tape
that
will
make
it
easy
and
cheap
to
run
a
company
in
Ireland
and
this
will
make
a
real
difference
to
we
international
competitiveness
.
the
Bill
will
make
company
law
more
accessible
for
the
end
user
and
reduce
the
complexity
of
do
business
with
company
.
the
main
savings
will
come
from
the
ease
of
set
up
a
company
,
the
write
agm
,
the
streamlining
of
corporate
governance
procedure
and
reduce
professional
fee
.
for
example
,
the
provision
relate
to
examinership
allow
small
private
company
apply
directly
to
the
local
circuit
Court
,
rather
than
the
high
Court
.
Senator
Bacik
speak
of
redundancy
payment
and
they
be
now
manage
by
the
Department
of
social
Protection
under
the
insolvency
scheme
.
however
,
official
from
my
Department
be
work
with
that
department
to
find
a
solution
in
case
where
employee
be
abandon
by
a
company
that
do
not
formally
wind
up
.
this
work
be
ongoing
and
we
all
share
the
concern
raise
here
relate
to
the
Paris
Bakery
,
though
this
issue
go
beyond
that
business
and
apply
on
a
wide
scale
.
Senator
Bacik
also
raise
the
matter
of
the
deem
provision
and
it
be
correct
that
a
private
limited
company
will
be
a
dac
during
the
transition
period
.
it
be
also
correct
that
such
a
company
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
new
limited
structure
,
even
if
it
do
not
actively
change
to
allow
itself
to
be
deem
at
the
end
of
the
transition
period
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
Senator
Barrett
express
concern
about
company
not
have
a
physical
agm
.
it
be
worth
note
that
a
company
can
,
of
course
,
hold
a
AGM
and
there
be
no
barrier
to
do
this
.
it
be
up
to
the
company
whether
the
agm
be
in
writing
or
in
person
and
it
be
a
private
matter
for
the
member
of
a
private
company
.
Senator
Cullinane
refer
to
the
financial
crisis
,
as
have
other
Senator
,
and
ask
what
action
have
be
take
to
deal
with
its
effect
.
the
draft
of
the
company
Bill
begin
before
the
financial
crisis
but
it
have
not
be
a
static
process
.
the
CLRG
have
produce
15
report
since
2000
and
its
recommendation
be
generally
reflect
in
this
Bill
.
most
recently
action
be
immediately
take
on
foot
of
a
recommendation
that
small
company
be
permit
to
initiate
examinership
proceedings
in
the
circuit
court
as
a
less
costly
way
to
facilitate
small
company
in
difficulty
.
the
Bill
also
incorporate
the
2009
Act
,
which
increase
and
clarify
the
power
of
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
and
increase
the
disclosure
requirement
relate
to
loan
make
by
company
to
director
.
this
be
just
a
few
example
of
how
the
Bill
have
be
adapt
to
take
account
of
current
economic
circumstance
.
I
want
it
to
be
on
the
record
of
this
House
that
the
Irish
Congress
of
Trade
Union
,
ICTU
,
be
include
in
the
deliberation
of
the
CLRG
.
if
a
document
be
to
be
quote
verbatim
on
the
record
of
this
house
I
would
like
to
know
what
it
be
.
perhaps
it
could
be
circulate
to
all
of
we
.
Senator
Cullinane
be
concerned
that
the
full
rights
,
power
and
privilege
of
a
company
under
section
38
of
the
Bill
will
confer
human
rights
on
company
to
the
detriment
of
worker
.
that
be
wonderfully
rhetorical
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
say
so
.
the
full
and
unlimited
capacity
refer
to
in
section
38
have
be
include
because
under
exist
law
a
company
have
no
capacity
to
carry
on
business
except
in
so
far
as
its
constitution
allow
.
this
rule
have
result
in
enormous
object
clause
that
name
every
activity
conceivable
to
its
drafter
.
it
have
prove
ineffective
in
protect
the
rights
of
creditor
and
member
.
as
a
result
it
have
be
abandon
in
other
common
law
jurisdiction
,
most
notably
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
under
the
Bill
,
although
director
can
still
be
make
liable
for
participation
in
certain
activity
by
the
constitution
,
section
38
mean
that
all
contract
properly
make
on
behalf
of
the
company
will
be
bind
.
it
do
not
give
a
company
human
rights
such
as
the
unlimited
capacity
to
enter
into
civil
partnership
,
adopt
child
,
to
be
elect
to
public
office
nor
even
become
the
sole
director
of
another
company
.
all
of
this
thing
be
reserve
to
human
person
.
in
term
of
rights
,
it
be
well
establish
jurisprudence
of
the
European
Court
of
human
Right
that
human
rights
may
be
engage
with
regard
to
the
activity
of
company
.
for
example
,
it
have
hold
that
the
right
to
free
speech
under
article
10
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
protect
advertising
,
include
advertising
by
company
.
rights
to
privacy
,
property
and
fair
trial
have
also
be
successfully
argue
for
company
at
the
European
Court
of
human
Right
.
this
rights
be
now
well
establish
and
be
unrelated
to
change
in
this
Bill
.
Senator
Mooney
ask
which
company
be
the
non-plc
.
they
be
mostly
small
private
company
limit
by
share
and
a
small
portion
be
company
limit
by
guarantee
,
CLG
,
which
be
mainly
sport
club
and
charity
.
regard
get
rid
of
the
"
place
of
business
"
,
it
be
intend
that
this
provision
will
tighten
up
matter
as
company
will
not
be
allow
operate
without
make
appropriate
annual
return
-
they
will
be
require
to
do
so
.
the
issue
of
multinational
and
tax
minimisation
scheme
have
be
raise
today
.
while
I
understand
the
genuinely
hold
concern
of
the
Senator
,
this
be
a
matter
that
be
well
address
within
tax
law
.
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
be
very
clear
on
he
objective
of
make
Ireland
part
of
the
solution
to
global
tax
challenge
,
and
not
part
of
the
problem
.
International
company
be
in
a
position
to
avail
of
the
difference
in
tax
law
between
jurisdiction
in
order
to
minimise
they
tax
to
the
great
extent
possible
.
therefore
,
the
most
effective
way
to
address
this
international
issue
be
for
country
to
work
together
.
Ireland
be
play
a
active
role
in
the
OECD
base
erosion
and
profit
shifting
process
,
BEPS
,
and
be
fully
supportive
of
international
effort
in
this
regard
.
I
be
aware
that
the
draft
of
this
Bill
have
involve
a
hugely
collaborative
effort
to
date
and
I
know
that
we
can
maintain
that
approach
as
it
move
through
the
House
.
to
return
to
Senator
White
's
point
,
the
legislation
have
transcend
many
mandate
,
political
party
and
stakeholder
.
I
be
not
say
that
it
be
apolitical
but
there
have
be
a
degree
of
collegiality
about
the
approach
.
I
look
forward
to
that
further
collegiality
in
term
of
listen
to
the
Senator
's
amendment
when
they
bring
they
forward
.
I
thank
the
Senator
who
contribute
to
this
debate
.
I
look
forward
to
engage
again
with
they
on
committee
and
report
Stage
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
on
the
adjournment
.
I
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
when
a
relevant
offence
be
detect
,
the
register
owner
of
the
vehicle
involve
receive
a
fix
charge
notice
.
I
know
that
be
state
the
obvious
but
I
wish
to
set
out
the
process
.
the
address
to
which
the
fix
charge
notice
be
post
be
either
the
one
supply
by
the
driver
,
when
intercept
by
a
Garda
Síochána
,
or
the
address
list
on
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
's
national
vehicle
and
driver
file
or
,
NVDF
.
the
minister
have
be
inform
by
the
Garda
authority
,
who
be
responsible
for
enforcement
of
the
legislation
,
that
ordinary
post
be
utilise
to
serve
fix
charge
notice
,
in
accordance
with
section
25
of
the
Interpretation
Act
2005
.
this
provide
that
service
of
a
document
may
be
effect
by
post
and
that
such
service
be
deem
to
have
be
effect
at
the
time
at
which
a
letter
would
ordinarily
have
be
deliver
,
unless
the
contrary
be
prove
.
the
minister
be
also
advise
that
road
traffic
legislation
provide
that
,
in
a
prosecution
relate
to
a
unpaid
fix
charge
notice
,
it
shall
be
presume
that
the
relevant
fix
charge
notice
have
be
serve
,
or
cause
to
be
serve
,
and
that
a
payment
pursuant
to
the
relevant
notice
have
not
be
make
,
unless
the
contrary
be
show
.
in
so
far
as
the
use
of
register
post
be
concerned
,
the
minister
will
convey
the
Senator
's
view
on
this
matter
to
the
Garda
authority
and
to
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
.
however
,
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
would
note
that
use
of
register
post
would
not
overcome
objection
that
notice
be
receive
by
person
other
than
that
for
whom
they
be
intend
,
or
that
person
would
seek
to
avoid
service
by
decline
to
accept
such
register
notice
.
there
would
also
be
logistical
and
cost
implication
associate
with
issue
what
could
be
more
than
400000
register
letter
annually
,
in
circumstance
where
a
majority
of
person
receive
and
pay
the
fix
charge
notice
under
current
arrangement
with
no
difficulty
.
the
Senator
will
also
be
aware
that
section
44
of
the
Road
Traffic
act
2010
will
introduce
what
be
commonly
refer
to
as
a
"
third
payment
option
"
into
the
fix
charge
system
.
under
this
mechanism
a

I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
issue
.
again
,
I
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
in
term
of
the
current
recruitment
competition
,
any
member
of
the
Garda
Reserve
be
entitle
to
apply
for
a
position
for
the
full
-
time
service
,
provide
they
meet
the
statutory
requirement
.
I
can
advise
Senator
that
,
furthermore
,
the
admission
and
appointment
regulation
provide
that
,
as
part
of
the
competitive
selection
process
organised
by
the
Public
Appointments
Service
for
full
-
time
membership
of
a
Garda
Síochána
,
"
due
recognition
to
any
satisfactory
service
by
the
person
as
a
reserve
member
"
shall
be
give
to
such
candidate
,
this
provision
be
introduce
in
order
to
acknowledge
the
beneficial
experience
and
skill
gain
by
a
reserve
member
and
to
allow
they
,
at
assessment
and
at
interview
,
the
opportunity
to
highlight
that
experience
and
skill
.
in
February
2008
the
Garda
Commissioner
establish
a
group
to
review
training
and
development
for
Garda
and
civilian
staff
in
the
Garda
Síochána
.
the
report
of
the
review
group
be
publish
in
May
2009
and
the
content
be
note
by
the
then
government
.
the
objective
of
the
review
group
be
to
make
recommendation
to
improve
and
reinvigorate
Garda
training
in
line
with
good
practice
in
order
to
meet
the
new
challenge
of
a
change
society
.
one
of
the
key
recommendation
identify
by
the
group
be
that
the
student
-
probationer
training
programme
should
be
radically
restructure
.
the
course
for
Garda
trainee
be
a
high
level
BA
course
,
which
necessitate
a
certain
academic
capability
.
the
revise
training
programme
stem
from
the
recommendation
of
the
review
group
be
devise
in
order
to
well
prepare
recruit
for
the
modern
policing
environment
.
the
main
difference
between
the
new
and
the
previous
programme
be
that
the
new
programme
carry
a
great
emphasis
on
operational
policing
and
focus
on
real
life
scenario
which
in
turn
prepare
student
for
the
policing
challenge
they
will
face
.
the
new
programme
will
also
instil
a
lifelong
learning
philosophy
for
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
,
with
a
suite
of
mandatory
and
elective
course
make
available
.
I
will
now
outline
the
stage
of
the
process
.
the
interview
stage
allow
reserve
candidate
to
demonstrate
they
experience
,
have
a
deep
understanding
of
the
work
involve
as
a
fully
-
fledge
member
.
by
virtue
of
they
exposure
to
work
in
the
Garda
Síochána
,
they
be
in
a
position
to
perform
well
at
the
structure
competency
base
interview
and
offer
highly
relevant
example
of
how
they
demonstrate
the
key
competency
require
.
interview
board
have
be
brief
in
the
work
of
the
reserve
and
they
experience
in
this
context
.
it
be
important
that
all
person
wish
to
join
the
full
-
time
force
undergo
the
same
competitive
selection
and
recruitment
process
.
in
do
so
the
integrity
of
the
process
be
maintain
.
however
,
the
mechanism
mention
give
the
reserve
member
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
they
on
-
the
-
job
learning
acquire
as
member
of
the
reserve
.
this
allow
they
some
advantage
in
the
recruitment
process
.
I
can
advise
Senator
that
there
be
currently
1192
attest
reserve
gardaí
with
a
further
89
at
various
stage
of
training
.
to
date
,
40
reserve
member
have
become
full
Garda
member
,
and
we
will
,
no
doubt
,
see
more
join
the
rank
from
this
recruitment
competition
.
Garda
reserve
member
make
a
real
and
tangible
contribution
to
policing
right
across
the
country
and
we
be
all
fully
supportive
of
its
continue
development
.
in
this
regard
,
recruitment
to
the
reserve
and
training
of
new
reserve
member
be
ongoing
.
the
minister
would
like
to
assure
the
Senator
that
the
government
be
and
will
continue
to
be
,
fully
commit
to
the
Garda
Reserve
.
the
minister
would
also
encourage
reserve
member
to
apply
for
the
full
-
time
force
if
they
be
interested
in
and
commit
to
be
a
full
-
time
member
.
the
assessment
process
will
ensure
that
that
who
be
successful
have
the
capability
both
to
pass
the
BA
course
in
applied
Policing
,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
important
function
of
a
full

time
member
.
I

to
he
and
he
betroth
on
they

in

this

I
do
not
support
the
amendment
.
the
primary
objective
of
the
company
Bill
be
to
be
business
-
friendly
and
to
reduce
red
tape
or
unnecessary
regulation
where
possible
.
support
this
amendment
would
result
in
the
introduction
of
a
onerous
regulation
which
would
disproportionately
affect
business
and
will
fail
to
adequately
address
the
cardinal
problem
which
the
accountancy
body
allude
to
.
New
regulation
should
only
be
introduce
where
there
be
clear
evidence
of
market
failure
or
very
damaging
consumer
harm
.
that
have
not
be
establish
factually
as
be
the
position
here
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
be
also
possible
that
new
layer
of
regulation
could
also
stultify
further
growth
and
innovation
.
when
the
matter
be
review
by
the
Department
at
the
time
of
draft
,
the
conclusion
be
there
be
no
case
for
introduce
a
system
of
regulation
for
the
profession
generally
.
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
feel
that
introduce
such
a
system
would
put
at
risk
the
flexibility
of
the
profession
and
its
ability
to
respond
to
client
need
,
be
it
in
traditional
area
such
as
tax
advice
or
management
account
,
or
in
emerge
field
such
as
succession
planning
.
regulation
could
also
stultify
further
growth
and
innovation
.
have
examine
the
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
the
principle
of
good
regulation
,
the
Competition
Authority
conclude
there
be
no
public
interest
case
require
legal
protection
of
the
term
"
accountant
"
.
that
be
the
government
position
.
for
the
record
of
this
House
,
we
note
the
concern
express
by
accountancy
body
.
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
have
agree
to
undertake
a
assessment
of
the
issue
by
consult
with
key
stakeholder
such
as
the
professional
body
mention
by
Senator
Quinn
,
consumer
representative
,
small
business
representative
,
regulator
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
the
company
Registration
Office
and
other
official
body
with
a
interest
.
it
be
not
as
if
we
be
ignore
issue
,
it
be
merely
the
case
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
Bill
we
do
not
support
the
amendment
.
this
be
not
to
say
that
there
be
not
a
ongoing
consultation
process
with
the
very
body
Senator
Quinn
mention
.
I
will
take
the
section
together
.
I
have
previously
advocate
the
view
that
it
be
within
the
remit
of
the
accountancy
profession
to
engage
in
a
awareness
campaign
inform
the
public
of
the
advantage
of
engage
the
service
of
only
fully
qualified
and
properly
regulate
accountant
.
similar
public
awareness
campaign
have
be
run
,
for
instance
,
in
relation
to
electrical
contractor
,
and
they
have
prove
successful
.
it
be
worth
restate
that
the
primary
objective
of
the
company
Bill
be
to
ensure
that
Ireland
have
a
company
law
code
that
will
enhance
its
international
competitiveness
,
help
improve
ordinary
business
and
make
it
easy
for
company
throughout
the
country
to
establish
and
operate
.
on
a
technical
draft
matter
,
this
amendment
would
be
ineffective
,
as
it
would
impact
on
other
-
for
example
,
as
the
Senator
have
mention
,
that
practise
as
accounting
technician
or
as
turf
accountant
.
it
also
fail
to
cover
all
detail
which
would
be
require
in
term
of
qualification
,
standard
and
so
on
.
for
that
reason
,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
support
the
amendment
.
the
accountancy
profession
be
in
general
adaptable
and
agile
,

I
note
the

point
.
there
be

agreement
that

we

there
be
a
recognition

the
need
to

read

it

that

in
the
case
of
a

of
"
rights

"
,
a
natural

take

company
be
legal
person
and
,
as
such
,
have
a
number
of
rights
that
must
be
protect
.
therefore
,
I
be
not
in
favour
adopt
this
amendment
.
I
will
avail
of
this
opportunity
to
clarify
that
section
38
grant
private
limit
company
the
full
legal
capacity
to
enter
into
transaction
and
undertake
business
activity
.
section
39
provide
that
a
company
,
should
it
wish
to
do
so
,
may
authorise
a
person
to
bind
it
,
that
be
,
act
on

of
its
board
of
director
.
the
provision
contain
in
section
38
be
new
while
section
39
be
draw
from
section
6
(
3
)
of
the
European
Community
(
company
)
regulation
1973
,
although
this
be
not
a
direct
re-enactment
.
section
38
be
model
on
section
16
(
1
)
of
the
New
Zealand
company
Act
1993
.
the
rationale
for
the
innovation
in
section
38
be
to
prevent
its
use
in
the
avoidance
of
corporate
contractual
responsibility
to
the
detriment
of
a
particular
creditor
.
under
current
law
,
if
a
company
do
something
outside
the
scope
of
its
object
,
it
have
commit
a
ultra
vire
act
.
this
mean
that
,
if
a
company
have
enter
into
a
contract
and
be
subsequently
find
to
have
act
outside
its
power
,
that
contract
will
be
deem
to
have
never
exist
.
this
section
reflect
the
reality
that
90
%
of
Irish
company
be
closely
hold
one
,
that
be
,
company
in
which
the
shareholder
and
management
often
consist
of
the
same
people
.
thus
,
in
circumstance
where
the
demarcation
of
management
and
shareholder
be
virtually
non-existent
,
the
doctrine
of
ultra
vire
have
little
meaning
.
I
be
satisfied
that
section
38
will
add
certainty
to
the
law
and
be
to
be
welcome
.
as
a
result
of
this
provision
,
any
contract
that
a
company
enter
into
will
be
legally
bind
on
that
company
.
therefore
,
I
be
satisfied
that
the
introduction
of
section
38
do
not
mean
that
the
company
somehow
can
usurp
the
human
rights
of
any
person
or
ignore
its
legal
obligation
.
a
company
be
a
legal
person
that
have
rights
and
duty
of
its
own
.
it
be
not
possible
or
proper
to
insert
a
provision
that
would
undermine
this
rights
.
in
regard
to
amendment
no.
10
,
suggest
we
ought
to
set
out
in
statute
that
a
person
's
rights
would
,
regardless
of
circumstance
,
always
take
precedence
over
a
company
's
rights
be
misconceive
in
law
.
like
human
being
,
company
have
rights
which
must
be
protect
.
for
example
,
a
company
can
enjoy
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
be
afford
a
nationality
.
while
I
appreciate
that
this
section
have
be
interpret
as
somehow
strengthen
the
corporate
personality
at
the
expense
of
human
being
,
that
simply
be
not
the
case
.
it
be
not
appropriate
to
attempt
to
introduce
a
hierarchy
between
various
rights
in
statute
law
.
it
be
a
matter
for
the
court
to
interpret
the
fact
of
a
particular
case
and
apply
the
law
.
it
ought
to
be
appreciate
that
rights
be
not
limit
and
that
it
be
normal
that
different
rights
conflict
with
one
another
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
I
cannot
accept
amendment
no.
10
.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
this
section

to
bring
it
into

"
initial
"
and
"
interim
"
financial
statement
.
the
amendment
amend
the
definition
of
"
distribution
"
by
eliminate
as
a
exception
the
reduction
of
the
liability
of
shareholder
.
the
reduction
in
the
liability
of
shareholder
will
,
therefore
,
now
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
"
distribution
"
and
be
subject
to
the
normal
rule
of
require
distributable
reserve
.
this
be
consistent
with
section
117(3
)
which
provide
that
a
company
shall
not
apply
a
unrealised
profit
in
pay
up
debenture
or
any
amount
unpaid
on
any
of
its
issue
share
.
the
purpose
of
amendment
Nosemcue
26
and
27
be
to
include
all
revaluation
reserve
in
the
definition
of
"
relevant
sum
"
.
this
be
consistent
with
EU
directive
which
provide
that
revaluation
reserve
may
be
capitalise
.
the
purpose
be
to
correct
a
inconsistency
in
the
Bill
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
clarify
that
a
company
secretary
have
the
skill
or
resource
necessary
to
discharge
he
or
she
statutory
and
other
duty
.
as
the
provision
stand
,
it
could
be
interpret
incorrectly
to
prevent
the
outsource
of
legal
service
.
this
be
not
intend
.
I
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
the
amendment
which
propose
unduly
oppressive
condition
on
legitimate
business
.
the
suggestion
that
a
majority
of
director
be
EEA
resident
might
particularly
dissuade
foreign
direct
investment
company
from
do
business
in
Ireland
.
this
be
bad
for
Ireland
and
Irish
commerce
generally
.
second
,
section
137
,
which
re-enact
exist
law
,
ensure
that
company
that
do
not
have
at
least
one
director
who
be
resident
in
a
EEA
state
must
put
in
place
a
bond
in
the
prescribe
form
that
become
payable
to
a
person
nominate
by
the
registrar
or
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
the
purpose
of
the
bond
be
to
discharge
any
fine
impose
on
the
company
in
respect
of
a
offence
commit
by
it
and
prosecutable
by
the
registrar
and
-
or
for
the
purpose
of
discharge
certain
fine
and
penalty
impose
on
it
by
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act
1997
.
the
money
can
also
be
use
to
cover
expense
that
be
reasonably
incur
in
the
collection
of
say
penalty
.
the
bond
can
not
be
use
for
any
other
purpose
.
therefore
,
the
amendment
propose
do
not
achieve
any
legitimate
policy
goal
.
they
sole
effect
be
to
create
a
arbitrary
restriction
on
non-eea
company
try
to
do
business
in
Ireland
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
I
do
not
support
the
amendment
.
this
amendment
propose
to
insert
the
word
"
manage
and
control
"
into
this
section
of
the
Bill
.
the
objective
appear
to
be
to
cause
all
company
register
in
Ireland
to
be
tax
-
resident
in
Ireland
.
as
Minister
of
State
in
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
consider
the
full
impact
or
consequence
of
any
change
to
tax
law
.
such
a
exercise
be
within
the
function
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
additionally
,
the
propose
amendment
be
illegal
both
under
EU
and
international
law
.
the
provision
would
fall
foul
of
the
EU
law
on
freedom
of
establishment
,
which
be
a
core
aspect
of
EU
law
.
compliance
with
this
be
closely
monitor
by
the
European
Commission
.
Ireland
have
recently
be
require
by
the
commission
to
change
a
provision
of
Irish
law
which
require
that
at
least
one
director
of
a
Irish
company
be
resident
in
Ireland
.
this
provision
would
go
much
further
,
effectively
require
all
management
activity
to
occur
within
the
State
.
this
be
clearly
a
hindrance
to
cross
-
border
trade
within
the
EU
and
significantly
trammel
the
ability
of
a
company
from
another
EU
member
state
to
establish
in
Ireland
.
furthermore
,
this
proposal
would
put
Ireland
in
breach
of
obligation
under
double
taxation
agreement
with
other
country
.
this
be
completely
unprecedented
and
would
be
highly
prejudicial
to
Irish
commerce
and
Ireland
's
reputation
internationally
so
it
be
on
that
basis
that
I
be
not
in
favour
of
accept
the
amendment
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
delete
language
which
could
be
interpret
in
a
discriminatory
manner
.
this
refer
to
the
somewhat
outdated
term
''
unsound
mind
''
.
while
the
term
be
legally
sound
,
it
do
not
represent
everyday
language
and
understanding
of
situation
where
a
director
be
no
long
,
for
medical
reason
,
capable
of
fulfil
he
or
she
function
as
a
company
director
.
the
wording
propose
be
more
in
line
with
the
wording
use
in
the
employment
Equality
Act
.
this
section
provide
that
the
office
of
director
be
vacate
if
a
director
become
bankrupt
or
disqualify
and
,
unless
the
constitution
provide
otherwise
,
where
the
director
resign
,
can
no
long
be
reasonably
regard
as
possess
a
adequate
decision
making
capacity
,
be
restrict
,
sentence
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
a
indictable
offence
,
or
be
absent
for
six
month
without
permission
.
this
section
substantially
import
model
regulation

of
part
i
of

of
the
first
schedule
to

Act

a
new
requirement
that
the
conviction
must
give
rise
to
a
sentence
and
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
-
actual
or

-
have
be
insert
.
I
pay
tribute
to
Mr.
Jim
Breen
from
Cycle
against
suicide
,
who
bring
the
issue
to
we
attention
.
on
foot
of
representation
make
specifically
by
he
and
people
close
to
he
,
we
seek
to
change
the
wording
and
reflect
language
that
be
more
caring
and
apt
for
the
society
we
live
in
.
on
the
basis
of
some
consciousness
-
raising
,
we
introduce
this
amendment
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
we
official
in
bring
it
forward
.
it
represent
a
positive
change
in
how
we
use
language
about
issue
such
as
this
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
grant
the
Minister
power
to
make
regulation
in
regard
to
the
non-disclosure
of
residential
address
on
the
public
register
keep
by
the
registrar
.
in
certain
limited
circumstance
,
company
officer
will
be
grant
a
exemption
from
list
they
residential
address
on
the
public
register
.
such
address
will
be
keep
separately
by
the
registrar
who
,
in
turn
,
will
be
grant
power
to
release
such
address
to
relevant
authority
,
for
example
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
and
a
Garda
Síochána
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
ensure
competitiveness
as
certain
company
officer
may
be
reluctant
to
locate
in
Ireland
unless
they
be
,
for
legitimate
reason
,
give
a
exemption
in
respect
of
publication
of
they
residential
address
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
reflect
exist
law
and
to
provide
certainty
.
as
the
Bill
stand
,
the
word
''
unless
the
contrary
be
prove
''
could
lead
to
uncertainty
and
could
be
interpret
as
permit
deem
service
of
notice
to
be
set
aside
at
a
late
date
,
which
could
cause
uncertainty
in
respect
of
business
conduct
at
every
relevant
meeting
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
address
any
ambiguity
as
to
the
part
to
which
this
provision
apply
.
this
section
concern
unanimous
write
resolution
and
be
partially
new
.
unanimous
write
resolution
be
permit
as
the
default
,
that
be
to
say
,
there
be
no
need
for
the
constitution
to
allow
they
.
the
section
implement
the
recommendation
in
the
first
report
of
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
with
regard
to
write
resolution
and
procedure
for
they
execution
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
clarify
that
there
can
be
a
sole
member
company
notwithstand
a
stipulation
in
the
constitution
that
there
be
two
member
or
a
great
number
.
this
will
ensure
any
confusion
be
avoid
.
the
purpose
of

where
a
provision
of

to

but
also
where
the
constitution
so
require
.
as
the

,
the

would
have
to
be
amend
to
provide
for
this
and
this
be

this
section
contain
the
form
of
director
compliance
statement
as
recommend
by
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
.
have
analyse
the
provision
contain
in
the
2003
act
,
the
group
determine
that
such
extra
duty
as
set
out
would
do
little
to
increase
compliance
and
merely
result
in
a
increase
in
red
tape
at
considerable
cost
to
Irish
business
.
the
set
-
up
cost
for
a
business
be
estimate
at
€
90000
and
the
ongoing
annual
cost
at
€
40000
.
a
streamlined
version
of
the
director
compliance
statement
propose
by
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
remove
the
requirement
that
the
statement
include
a
declaration
that
the
company
have
comply
with
all
other
enactment
which
could
affect
its
financial
performance
.
this
be
find
to
be
the
most
burdensome
aspect
of
the
statement
and
also
the
least
relevant
since
company
be
already
legally
oblige
to
comply
with
all
Act
of
the
Oireachtas
and
they
inclusion
in
the
director
compliance
statement
do
not
add
substantive
duty
.
a
wide
majority
of
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
,
that
be
,
more
than
80
%
of
the
member
,
include
member
represent
the
Financial
Regulator
and
other
public
body
,
agree
to
a
more
balance
version
of
the
director
compliance
statement
.
there
be
a
strong
European
Union
impetus
towards
less
unnecessary
regulation
to
make
EU
business
more
competitive
.
the
amendment
would
create
unjustifiable
and
disproportionate
cost
for
Irish
business
without
add
value
in
term
of
protection
.
it
would
disadvantage
Ireland
competitively
as
it
would
move
beyond
other
country
.
the
director
compliance
statement
,
as
it
stand
,
have
broad
support
.
for
this
reason
,
it
be
intend
to
preserve
the
director
compliance
statement
as
it
stand
within
the
Bill
.
on
this
basis
,
I
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
the
amendment
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
remove
the
unintended
requirement
in
the
Bill
for
the
disclosure
of
director
's
interest
in
share
option
grant
by
parent
company
.
when
a
1
%
or
less
share
option
be
grant
,
it
be
not
require
that
it
be
report
to
the
company
.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
this
section
on
report
stage
in
order
to
bring
it
into
line
with
exist
law
.
I
be
also
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
Chapter
15
on
report
stage
in
order
to
bring
the
audit
exemption
criterion
in
line
with
article
52
of
Directive
2013
/
34
/
EU
.
the
aim
of
this
directive
be
to
simplify
the
accounting
requirement
for
small
company
and
improve
the
clarity
and
comparability
of
company
's
financial
statement
within
the
Union
.
the
new
directive
take
the
small
company
or
group
as
the
starting
point
and
impose
additional
requirement
on
medium
-
size
company
and
group
and
even
further
requirement
on
large
company
and
group
,
as
well
as
on
public

entity
.
essentially
,
the
latter
be
list
company
,
bank
and
insurance
undertaking
,
whether
list
or
not
,
regardless
of

.
this
be
describe
as
a
"
think
small
first
"
approach
.
directive
2013/34
/
EU
must
be
transpose
into
national
law
by
July
2015
.
I
have
sympathy
for
the
situation
of
the
person
to
whom
the
Senator
refer
but
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
what
be
propose
would
not
be
a
logical
inclusion
in
company
's
financial
statement
.
such
statement
relate
to
company
's
financial
performance
and
not
to
they
tax
obligation
.
fiscal
accounting
address
tax
obligation
.
if
the
government
be
to
consider
a
requirement
to
oblige
business
to
obtain
and
publish
certificate
of
tax
compliance
,
the
appropriate
place
to
do
so
would
be
in
tax
law
rather
than
company
law
in
order
that
both
company
and
non-company
business
,
which
also
pay
tax
,
would
be
contemplate
.
the
introduction
of
the
suggest
requirement
would
be
entirely
without
precedent
across
the
European
Union
.
it
be
on
this
basis
that
I
be
not
in
favour
of
accept
the
amendment
.
I
shall
take
the
two
amendment
together
,
if
I
may
.
I
be
unclear
as
to
why
the
Senator
have
propose
the
deletion
of
subsection
(
2
)
and
(
6
)
,
particularly
as
the
proposal
do
not
include
any
replacement
text
.
I
can
only
surmise
that
he
be
oppose
to
the
Bill
make
provision
for
alternative
method
for
the
store
and
manage
of
accounting
record
,
rather
than
the
requirement
to
keep
accounting
record
on
a
continuous
and
consistent
basis
.
perhaps
he
will
clarify
the
matter
.
the
purpose
of
subsection
(
2
)
and
(
6
)
be
,
respectively
,
to
ensure
that
accounting
record
must
be
keep
on
a
continuous
and
consistent
basis
,
and
that
they
must
be
available
for
inspection
in
the
State
.
this
stem
from
exist
law
,
specifically
section
202
of
the
1990
company
Act
.
it
ought
to
be
note
that
the
requirement
to
keep
proper
book
be
not
a
obligation
to
act
as
a
passive
custodian
of
book
,
but
rather
a
positive
and
continue
obligation
to
create
book
and
record
in
a
particular
form
and
with
specify
content
.
the
provision
have
to
be
general
in
some
respects
because
technology
may
change
and
one
cannot
be
over
-
prescriptive
at
the
same
time
.
subsection
(
2
)
in
the
Bill
be
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
ledger
exist
in
electronic
form
and
,
therefore
,
require
that
such
ledger
must
also
be
update
and
safeguard
from
falsification
,
in
a
positive
manner
.
it
be
important
that
the
Bill
reflect
the
reality
of
the
majority
of
modern
company
practice
.
I
be
not
in
favour
of
delete
exist
law
from
this
section
,
on
that
basis
.
the
company
Bill
anticipate
that
where
such
record
be
keep
,
other
than
book
form
,
safeguard
shall
be
take
to
guard
against
falsification
.
subsection
(
6
)
,
subject
to
the
provision
of
subsection
(
7
)
,
ensure
that
where
accounting
record
,
other
information
and
return
be
keep
on
a
computer
that
the
computer
shall
be
keep
in
the
State
.
this
be
another
positive
duty
that
recognise
that
many
modern
company
no
long
rely
on
ledger
and
paper
when
maintain
or
record
any
transaction
.
I
cannot
support
a
proposal
to
remove
reference
and
safeguard
relate
to
technological
innovation
from
this
section
.
this
Bill
aim
to
strike
a
balance
between
good
regulation
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
operating
environment
for
company
in
Ireland
be
inform
by
the
reality
of
modern
company
.
record
management
be
a
crucial
aspect
for
modern
company
.
the
rationale
behind
this
provision
be
to
ensure
that
the
company
avail
of
modern
technology
shall
take
certain
precaution
to
ensure
that
say
record
be
accessible
and
authentic
.
with
regard
to
the
second
point
make
about
record
,
we
could
take
a
look
at
that
on
report
stage
.
I
also
take
the
point
that
the
Senator
make
in
relation
to
cloud
computing
which
be
something
we
must
have
due
regard
for
.
perhaps
we
could
come
back
to
it
at
a
late
stage
in
the
proceedings
,
if
that
be
okay
with
the
Senator
.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
section
286
on
report
stage
to
provide
for
a
more
precise
penalty
for
not
maintain
adequate
accounting
record
.
I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
to
this
section
on
report
stage
.
it
be
consider
that
further
refinement
of
the
wording
,
regard
the
penalty
,
may
be
require
as
it
may
not
be
specific
enough
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
delete
the
reference
to
a
"
bank
"
and
replace
with
the
word
"
institution
"
.
this
will
result
in
a
uniformity
of
language
throughout
the
Bill
and
be
in
line
with
EU
law
.
it
be
a
technical
draft
amendment
.
this
be
a
significant
amendment
and
arise
as
a
consequence
of
the
CLRG

recommendation
in
2013
that
company

be
amend
to
allow
company
that
meet

of
the

criterion
relate
to

sheet
total

and

the
intention
here
be
to
use
the
available

the
three
criterion
and
they
current
threshold
be
:
the

this
legislation
transpose

when
introduce

this
also
propose
the

the

the
purpose

be
to
align
the
Bill
with
exist
legislation
.
the
word
"

in
the
State
"
be
redundant
and
do
not
serve
any
useful
purpose
,
particularly
in

of
the
fact
that
subsection
99

and
99
(

)
of
the
company
Act
1963
be
not
repeat
here
.
section
410
and
411
agree
to
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
provide
for
a
modification
of
the
rule
govern
priority
of
charge
.
"
priority
of
charge
"
refer
to
where
two
or
more
successive
mortgage
be
create
over
the
same
property
.
the
current
rule
of
priority
be
that
the
first
mortgage
have
priority
over
the
subsequent
mortgage
,
subject
to
a
exception
where
the
second
mortgagee
give
notice
to
the
first
of
the
creation
of
the
second
mortgage
,
in
which
case
the
second
mortgage
will
have
priority
over
amount
secure
by
the
first
mortgage
advance
after
the
date
of
such
notice
.
this
be
know
as
the
tacking
of
further
advance
.
as
far
as
charge
on
land
be
concerned
,
the
exemption
be
contain
in
section
111
of
the
Land
and
Conveyancing
Law
Reform
Act
2009
and
section
75
of
the
Registration
of
title
Act
1964
.
however
,
there
be
no
equivalent
legislation
which
govern
asset
other
than
land
,
rather
the
same
result
be
arrive
at
under
common
law
.
as
the
Bill
stand
,
section
412
provide
that
unless
they
priority
be
otherwise
govern
by
another
enactment
,
charge
will
rank
in
priority
in
accordance
with
they
date
of
registration
in
the
cro
and
make
no
provision
for
the
tacking
of
further
advance
.
accordingly
,
if
the
section
be
enact
in
its
current
form
,
the
position
on
the
tacking
of
further
advance
will
vary
,
accord
to
whether
the
asset
charge
be
land
or
asset
other
than
land
.
the
holder
of
a
second
charge
over
land
will
be
able
to
get
priority
over
further
advance
,
whereas
the
holder
of
a
second
charge
on
other
asset
will
not
as
there
be
no
legislative
provision
for
it
.
this
would
not
be
a
desirable
outcome
.
the
purpose
of
the
further
amendment
be
to
bring
the
chapter
in
line
with
the
recommendation
make
in
the

the

be
to

the
section
define
a
number
of

for
the
purpose
of
this
part
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
remove
the
obligation

I
be
consider
introduce
a
amendment
on
report
stage
to
cater
for
the
consequence
of
a
merger
on
real
or
immovable
property
.
it
may
be
possible
to
improve
the
language
of
this
provision
to
increase
certainty
with
respect
to
the
property
transaction
and
thus
reduce
the
paperwork
and
cost
to
business
associate
with
a
merger
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
correct
a
subsection
reference
.
the
amendment
merely
purport
to
insert
a
female
pronoun
into
this
section
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
adopt
this
amendment
.
the
Bill
be
concerned
with
company
law
only
.
in
general
term
,
company
law
concern
itself
with
the
fiduciary
duty
that
a
director
owe
to
the
company
alone
while
recognise
that
a
director
ought
to
"
have
regard
to
the
interest
"
of
he
or
she
employee
.
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
include
the
propose
provision
in
the
Bill
.
legislation
govern
employee
rights
should
be
consider
in
the
context
of
employment
law
.
by
address
such
a
matter
in
a
company
Bill
,
the
provision
be
not
provide
protection
for
all
employee
such
as
sole
trader
and
that
work
in
partnership
.
second
,
employment
law
already
provide
for
redress
in
less
cumbersome
and
costly
fora
than
the
high
Court
.
equally
important
,
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
company
law
must
balance
the
rights
of
all
creditor
,
many
of
whom
be
employer
in
they
own
right
,
in
wind
up
situation
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Senator
be
attempt
to
achieve
laudable
goal
here
but
the
simple
fact
be
that
company
law
be
not
the
correct
vehicle
for
this
ambition
and
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
be
not
in
favour
of
the
amendment
.
in
addition
to
the
general
objection
previously
note
,
amendment
no.
104
would
fail
in
substance
as
prosecution
thereunder
would
be
doom
to
fail
due
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
phrase
"
breach
of
employment
law
"
.
there
be
no
indication
as
to
what
be
mean
by
this
.
no
such
provision
be
workable
but
only
in
the
context
of
a
specific
and
appropriate
enactment
where
the
transgression
be
clearly
identify
or
identifiable
.
finally
,
the
amendment
propose
that
the
separate
legal
personality
of
the
company
would
be
breach
for
a
transgression
of
civil
law
rather
than
criminal
law
.
in
all
the
other
circumstance
where
this
phrase
be
use
,
for
example
,
in
health
and
safety
legislation
,
it
require
a
criminal
offence
.
amendment
no.

suggest
that
a
company
may
be
wind
up
in
court
where
it
owe
a
employee
or
a
group
of
employee
more
than
€
1500
.
the
Bill
set
a
limit
at
€
10000
as
it
be
consider
that
great
balance
and
proportionality
must
be
achieve
in
circumstance
where
the
sanction
of
wind
up
be
potentially
so
severe
.
the
section
do
not
distinguish
between
a
employee
and
any
other
creditor
.
in
the
circumstance
,
any
creditor
be
entitle
to
issue
a
letter
demand
payment
and
if
after
21
day
,
such
payment
have
not
be
receive
,
the
creditor
be
entitle
to
petition
the
high
Court
.
I
be
sure
the
Senator
present
appreciate
that
petition
the
high
Court
be
not
a
simple
or
low
-
cost
exercise
.
it
would
have
to
be
question
whether
wind
up
be
really
the
most
effective
way
to
settle
a
debt
for
€
1500
.
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
be
provision
in
both
employment
and
health
and
safety
law
alongside
common
law
remedy
that
already
provide
for
the
type
of
situation
describe
.
for
example
,
the
payment
of
Wage
Act
1991
provide
more
efficient
remedy
for
employee
who
have
not
be
pay
they
wage
than
a
attempt
to
have
the
company
wind
up
in
the
high
court
with
all
of
the
associate
cost
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
clarify
the
court
's
discretionary
power
in
circumstance
where
a
company
fail
to
comply
with
a
requirement
to
deliver
within
14
day
after
the
commencement
of
the
member
's
voluntary
wind
up
a
copy
of
the
declaration
to
the
registrar
.
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
be
to
ensure
that
the
minister
may
prescribe
the
most
cost
-
effective
manner
in
which
the
Court
Service
can
maintain
unclaimed
dividend
and
balance
.
the
amendment
be
typographical
in
nature
and
do
not
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
Bill
.
I
will
bring
the
Senator
's
concern
to
the
minister
's
attention
.
as
I
say
,
it
be
a
area
I
know
very
well
and
which
I
would

to

have
in

,
for

,
at
Kylemore

in

to
do
that
.
I
will
bring
the
Senator
's
concern
to
the
minister
's
attention
.
as
I
say
,
it
be
a
area
I
know
very
well
and
which
I
would
like
to
see
develop
.
while
make
progress
,
however
,
we
have
to
retain
its
natural
beauty
.
person
in
the
area
depend
on
tourism
and
the
job
it
bring
.
the
one
thing
we
have
in
the
area
be
its
natural
beauty
,
for
example
,
at
Kylemore
and
in
the
Connemara
National
Park
-
one
could
go
on
and
on
.
we
also
need
to
develop
infrastructure
and
road
,
however
,
and
I
would
like
to
see
that
happen
.
if
the
minister
have
anything
to
correspond
to
the
Senator
in
this
regard
,
I
will
ask
he
to
do
that
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
introduce
second
Stage
of
the
Radiological
Protection
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
Bill
2014
.
the
Bill
have
two
main
objective
:
to
provide
for
the
dissolution
of
the
Radiological
Protection
Institute
of
Ireland
,
RPII
,
and
transfer
its
function
to
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
;
and
to
introduce
the
necessary
statutory
provision
to
enable
Ireland
to
ratify
the
2005
amendment
to
the
Convention
on
the
physical
Protection
of
Nuclear
Material
,
CPPNM
.
the
Bill
also
provide
for
the
updating
of
certain
fine
under
the
Radiological
Protection
Act
,
update
the
definition
of
"
ionise
radiation
"
to
the
late
international
standard
and
make
provision
to
enable
the
RPII
and
the
EPA
to
hold
radioactive
substance
or
irradiate
apparatus
,
necessary
for
the
fulfilment
of
they
function
,
without
require
a
licence
.
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
spending
review
of
all
area
of
public
expenditure
,
the
programme
for
government
include
a
policy
of
reduce
the
number
of
State
agency
.
a
government
decision
of
15
November
2011
provide
for
the
rationalisation
of
48
State
body
and
agency
,
and
the
critical
review
of
46
other
body
by
the
end
of
June
2012
.
the
merger
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
,
and
the
Radiological
Protection
Institute
of
Ireland
,
RPII
,
be
consider
as
part
of
this
critical
review
process
.
follow
completion
of
the
critical
review
in
October
2012
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
announce
that
the
EPA
and
the
RPII
be
to
merge
,
with
a
target
date
of
summer
2014
for
the
merger
.
to
meet
this
target
,
enable
legislation
need
to
be
in
place
before
the
summer
recess
.
I
want
to
place
on
the
record
that
there
will
be
no
diminution
in
the
function
of
either
agency
,
or
of
the
level
of
service
provide
by
they
,
arise
from
this
merger
.
in
fact
,
the
synergy
and
great
linkage
between
environmental
and
radiological
function
will
enhance
the
capacity
of
both
organisation
.
it
be
conclude
that
the
most
efficient
and
economic
means
of
merge
the
two
body
be
to
dissolve
one
and
transfer
all
its
function
,
staff
and
asset
to
the
other
,
rather
than
to
dissolve
both
and
create
a
completely
new
entity
.
this
approach
require
significantly
simple
legislation
,
less
cost
and
less
potential
disruption
to
service
delivery
.
accordingly
,
it
be
decide
to
dissolve
the
RPII
and
transfer
its
function
,
power
,
staff
and
asset
to
the
EPA
,
as
the
large
of
the
two
organisation
.
the
merger
will
take
the
follow
approach
which
be
reflect
in
the
Bill
.
first
,
on
a
day
appoint
by
ministerial
order
,
the
RPII
will
be
dissolve
and
its
function
,
power
and
staff
will
transfer
to
the
EPA
.
it
will
become
the
Office
of
Radiological
Protection
within
the
agency
,
head
up
by
a
director
,
take
the
number
of
office
in
the
agency
to
five
.
the
other
four
office
be
environmental
enforcement
;
climate
,
licensing
,
research
and
resource
use
;
environmental
assessment
;
and
communication
and
corporate
service
.
the
Bill
will
make
the
necessary
repeal
and
amendment
to
all
relevant
enactment
and
statutory
instrument
to
ensure
the
EPA
have
the
requisite
power
to
assume
the
radiological
protection
role
.
in
this
regard
,
all
current
function
of
the
RPII
become
function
of
the
EPA
from
the
date
of
transfer
.
the
second
principal
objective
of
the
Bill
be
to
enable
Ireland
to
ratify
the
2005
amendment
to
the
Convention
on
the
physical
Protection
of
Nuclear
Material
,
CPPNM
.
the
convention
be
sign
in
March
1980
and
include
all
EU
member
state
as
signatory
.
Ireland
ratify
the
convention
in
September
1991
,
the
term
of
the
treaty
be
provide
for
through
the
Radiological
Protection
Act
1991
.
the
convention
require
that
the
international
community
afford
certain
level
of
physical
protection
to
nuclear
material
,
include
during
international
transportation
.
the
CPPNM
establish
a
framework
for
co-operation
among
state
that
be
party
to
it
for
the
protection
,
recovery
and
return
of
steal
nuclear
material
.
it
also
set
out
a
range
of
serious
criminal
offence
involve
the
misappropriation
or
harmful
use
of
nuclear
material
which
participate
state
be
to
make
punishable
in
national
law
or
for
which
offender
could
be
subject
to
extradition
.
in
July
2005
,
the
state
that
be
party
to
the
CPPNM
agree
the
text
of
a
amending
treaty
to
strengthen
its
provision
,
primarily
by
extend
the
provision
to
require
ratify
state
to
protect
nuclear
facility
and
material
in
peaceful
domestic
use
,
storage
and
transport
.
it
also
provide
for
extend
co-operation
between
and
among
state
to
enable
rapid
measure
to
locate
and
recover
steal
or
smuggle
nuclear
material
and
to
mitigate
any
radiological
consequence
of
sabotage
.
the
original
CPPNM
require
that
state
introduce
a
series
of
offence
relate
to
nuclear
material
.
this
include
unlawfully
obtain
or
demand
nuclear
material
or
use
or
threaten
to
use
such
material
in
a
manner
that
would
cause
death
or
serious
injury
to
a
person
or
substantial
damage
to
property
.
the
2005
amendment
to
the
CPPNM
extend
the
range
of
criminal
offence
to
include
also
offence
relate
to
sabotage
of
nuclear

;
smuggling

,
conspire
or
direct
offence
that
could
lead
to
deliberate

it
also

,
in
a
manner
that
cause
significant
harm
to
the
environment
.
this
amending
treaty
,
when
ratify
,
will
create
the
Convention
on
the
physical
Protection
of
Nuclear
Material
and
Nuclear
Facility
,
CPPNMNF
.
it
be
a
important
milestone
in
international
effort
to
improve
the
physical
protection
of
nuclear
material
and
facility
.
it
be
regard
internationally
as
be
significant
for
nuclear
security
and
be
expect
to
have
a
major
impact
in
reduce
the
vulnerability
of
state
to
nuclear
terrorism
.
it
also

Dr.
Yukiya

express
the
strong
hope
that
Ireland
would
ratify
the
treaty
soon
,
as
it
require
96
ratifying
nation
to
enable
it
to
come
into

.
Ireland
have
commit
to

as
soon
as
possible
.
Ireland
have
be
a
key
driver
of
non-proliferation
since
the
1960
.
the
then

,
Frank
Aiken
,
be
the

it
be
important
that
Ireland
do
so
to
maintain
we
good
standing
as
a
state
party
to
the
NPT
and
at
the
IAEA
.
Ratification
of
the
CPPNMNF
be
also
regard
by
the
EU
as
a
key
element
of
Europe
's
nuclear
security
policy
.
at
present
,
26
of
the
28
EU
member
state
have
ratify
the

the
EU
,
through
the
EURATOM
treaty
,
cannot

the
treaty
until

it
first
.
in
this
context
,
we
EU
partner
have
also
communicate
they
concern
to

at
the
early
possible
juncture

everyone
agree
on
the
danger

.
we
have
be
implement
a

source
reduction
programme
over
the

which
have
involve
several
Department
and
agency
.
the
number
of

,
CPPNM
?
the
Attorney

have
provide

as
to
how
the

require

all
of
this

either
have
be
include
in

or
will
be
provide

other
aspect
to
the

will
be
give
effect
after
Ireland

.
the
irony
of
Senator

the
point
about
this
not
be

be
not
lose
on

the

then
advise
that
legislative

commence
the
process
of
draft
a
memorandum
for
government
with
the
general
scheme
for
the
legislation
at
the
end
of
2012
.
there
be
a
delay
of
some
month
because
we
be
wait
to
receive
observation
on
the
memorandum
.
it
be
decide
to
draft
the
legislation
to
merge
the
EPA
and
the
RPII
because
it
would
not
have
be
appropriate
to
have
two
bill
go
through
the
house
at
the
same
time
amend
the
same
legislation
.
it
be
decide
to
combine
the
merger
Bill
with
that
to
incorporate
the
term
of
the
CPPNM
.
I
sympathise
with
Senator
Denis
Landy
's
point
on
the
merger
's
impact
on
the
national
radon
control
strategy
.
I
hail
from
Mallow
which
have
one
of
the
high
incidence
of
radon
in
the
country
.
the
control
strategy
be
prepare
by
a
interagency
group
and
publish
in
February
this
year
,
set
out
48
recommendation
with
the
ultimate
aim
of
reduce
the
number
of
radon
-
related
lung
cancer
case
from
250
per
annum
.
successful
implementation
of
the
strategy
will
require
action
from
a
range
of
Department
,
public
body
and
other
stakeholder
.
a
co-ordination
group
,
chair
by
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
have
be
establish
to
monitor
implementation
of
the
strategy
which
will
report
annually
on
progress
.
in
2018
,
at
the
end
of
the
four
year
cover
by
the
action
plan
,
it
will
make
recommendation
to
the
government
on
what
further
action
it
consider
necessary
.
the
comprehensive
action
plan
which
be
be
implement
will
not
be
adversely
affect
by
this
merger
.
I
understand
Senator
Cáit
Keane
be
prepare
a
Bill
to
implement
the
recommendation
of
the
national
radon
control
strategy
and
have
be
in
contact
with
the
minister
in
this
respect
.
Senator
Mac
Conghail
raise
the
RPII
's
monitoring
of
UK
nuclear
power
plant
.
there
be
a
mechanism
by
which
we
monitor
Sellafield
which
this
legislation
will
not
change
.
he
also
refer
to
other
specific
nuclear
site
and
they
proximity
to
Ireland
which
the
government
should
also
monitor
.
there
be
open
-
end
engagement
with
the
UK
government
on
all
nuclear
-
related
matter
which
the
Department
have
work
on
in
recent
year
.
this
will
continue
and
the
merger
of
the
two
body
will
in
no
way
lessen
the
high
level
of
scrutiny
apply
to
the
Sellafield
issue
.
a
visit
by
the
Department
,
EPA
and
RPII
representative
to
the
Sellafield
site
be
be
arrange
.
whether
it
can
be
expand
to
include
other
site
can
be
discuss
at
another
stage
.
the
aim
of
the
government
's
agency
rationalisation
programme
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
state
body
while
integrate
they
role
and
responsibility
with
that
of
other
exist
body
.
there
be
no
intention
whatsoever
to
diminish
the
function
or
role
of
either
agency
.
any
reasonable
assessment
of
this
legislation
will
acknowledge
that
.
it
be
envisage
that
there
would
be
cost
savings
of
up
to
€
260000
per
annum
from
2016
onwards
while
there
be
other
savings
in
the
intervene
period
in
staff
efficiency
of
€
100000
per
annum
.
further
workforce
planning
,
include
a
review
of
structure
,
role
and
responsibility
,
will
be
complete
late
this
year
.
that
will
further
clarify
and
identify
future
need
and
capacity
as
well
as
scope
for
further
efficiency
.
Senator
Mullen
raise
the
issue
of
conveyancing
.
conveyance
datum
to
inform
purchaser
in
respect
of
radon
level
be
one
of
the
48
recommendation
of
the
national
radon
control
strategy
.
as
I
say
early
,
the
co-ordination
group
be
monitor
the

of
the
NRCS
and
it
will
be
make
recommendation
to
government
.
I
do
not
have
the

timeframe
for
that
but
perhaps
we
can
come
back
to
Senator
Mullen
on
the
matter
before
the
end
of
this
legislative
process
.

apologise
on

of
the

,

,
who
be
in

Chamber
.
it
be
on

basis
that
I
be
take
this
adjournment
debate
.
when
the
Senator
reply
,
she
might
clarify
whether
it
be
the
family
's
wish
to
have
the
person
care
for
in
they
home
or
a
residential
setting
.
accord
to
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
,
she
have
be
advise
by
the
HSE
that
it
be
very
aware
of
the
family
's
wish
to
care
for
the
young
person
in
question
in
they
own
home
.
we
might
obtain
some
clarification
,
not
necessarily
in
the
Senator
's
reply
today
.
I
acknowledge
she
point
on
the
potential
to
seek
residential
care
.
for
obvious
reason
,
we
all
want
to
protect
the
identity
of
the
person
concerned
and
I
will
not
give
the
official
answer
,
except
to
say
the
HSE
's
disability
service
in
the
local
area
have
arrange
a
case
review
meeting
in
early
December
with
she
family
and
the
relevant
service
provider
.
I
understand
a
previous
meeting
with
the
family
be
postpone
as
the
HSE
disability
service
manager
have
not
have
a
opportunity
to
discuss
she
circumstance
with
the
consultant
neurologist
.
every
effort
be
be
make
in
the
girl
's
good
interest
to
meet
the
complex
need
articulate
by
she
advocate
,
the
Senator
.
I
hope
the
meeting
which
will
take
place
in
early
December
will
provide
clarity
.
absolutely
.
the
Senator
can
be
assure
that
I
will
be
talk
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
this
evening
.
I
will
ensure
the
concern
raise
by
the
Senator
be
transfer
directly
to
the
person
in
question
in
order
that
they
can
pick
up
on
the
point
make
.
please
be
assure
that
I
will
meet
the
Minister
of
State
and
convey
to
she
the
request
make
by
the
Senator
,
as
the
advocate
for
the
girl
in
question
,
to
meet
she
to
discuss
the
case
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
.
that
be
a
give
.
I
acknowledge
the
issue
raise
by
the
Senator
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
the
adjournment
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
who
be
in
the
Dáil
Chamber
.
I
will
not
deliver
the
script
provide
.
the
issue
raise
by
the
Senator
arise
from
a
exceptional
set
of
circumstance
.
I
do
not
wish
to
say
it
be
a
complete
outlier
in
case
present
to
the
HSE
.
I
think
anybody
with
a
degree
of
fairness
would
acknowledge
the
individual
in
this
case
be
not
deal
with
properly
.
it
be
obvious
that
there
be
a
system
breakdown
.
I
have
be
give
a
script
,
but
I
do
not
wish
to
state
there
be
no
role
for
the
minister
for
Health
in
this
case
,
about
which
I
will
speak
from
the
script
that
I
have
be
give
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Senator
about
the
fact
that
in
the
period
from
2012
to
date
,
the
individual
in
question
be
lock
out
of
the
medical
card
system
through
no
fault
of
they
own
.
the
question
be
why
that
happen
.
I
be
aware
that
the
HSE
have
a
protocol
in
place
for
a
review
process
and
that
every
effort
be
make
to
provide
for
ongoing
engagement
with
client
during
this
process
.
that
obviously
do
not
happen
in
this
case
.
each
month
the
HSE
analysis
the
medical
card
register
to
identify
that
medical
card
and
gp
visit
card
schedule
for
review
within
three
month
.
that
obviously
do
not
happen
in
this
instance
.
now
all
customer
schedule
for
review
be
notify
and
a
balance
of
either
full
review
or
self
-
assessment
be
conduct
.
that
do
not
happen
either
in
this
instance
.
in
this
case
,
the
HSE
have
confirm
that
the
medical
card
lap
.
however
,
the
person
's
medical
need
be
provide
for
by
a
resident
doctor
,
which
the
Senator
have
state
and
expense
arise
from
medical
appointment
or
drug
be
fund
by
the
service
provider
.
I
understand
from
the
HSE
that
a
application
have
be
make
,
as
the
Senator
have
state
,
to
reinstate
the
person
's
medical
card
in
2014
.
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
have
ask
the
HSE
to
remind
service
provider
of
they
responsibility
to
ensure
such
matter
be
attend
to
promptly
in
respect
of
resident
in
they
care
.
I
do
not
have
a
answer
for
the
Senator
on
what
happen
in
this
case
,
but
I
fully
support
she
plea
on
behalf
of
the
client
that
there
be
a
review
of
the
structure
that
lead
to
a
situation
where
that
person
be
not
in
receipt
of
a
medical
card
if
that
person
be
entitle
to
one
for
a
particular
period
.
if
I
understand
the
Senator
correctly
,
the
medical
card
be
cancel
but
the
family
be
not
inform
or
be
not
in
receipt
of
any
documentation
to
that
effect
.
to
be
frank
,
I
think
the
very
least
the
person
be
entitle
to
in
this
instance
be
some
acknowledgement
of
that
fact
,
but
as
Oireachtas
Member
we
all
,
include
I
,
have
experience
of
circumstance
where
documentation
have
slip
through
the
crack
.
I
do
not
want
to
lay
the
blame
on
any
particular
entity
,
but
a
number
of
Oireachtas
member
have
send
in
documentation
to
the
service
on
behalf
of
various
client
or
constituent
and
it
have
get
lose
somewhere
in
the
ether
.
I
know
from
my
own
experience
that
service
have
be
clean
up
considerably
to
be
fair
to
the
HSE
and
I
be
confident
that
this
will
continue
,
give
today
's
announcement
,
for
instance
,
but
the
case
the
Senator
raise
be
worthy
of
further
examination
.
I
hope
the
most
positive
outcome
would
be
a
assurance
that
the
person
's
medical
card
would
be
restore
if
that
person
be
so
entitled
,
as
seem
to
be
the
case
,
but
also
that
medical
need
,
most
importantly
,
be
take
care
of
.
I
beg
the
Chair's
and
the
Senator
's
indulgence
to
acknowledge
that
point
.
I
acknowledge
the
distinction
the
Senator
have
make
.
at
the
same
time
,
historically
there
be
a
situation
where
the
client
-
I
know
it
be
a
awful
word
-----
I
apologise
if
I
be
use
inappropriate
terminology
,
but
I
do
not
mean
to
offend
anybody
.
a
system
or
a
protocol
must
be
put
in
place
.
that
be
the
essential
point
that
be
be
make
by
the
Senator
.
where
family
member
be
inform
.
that
be
the
key
.
from
a
HSE
perspective
,
it
generate
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
,
but
in
this
instance
there
be
a
certain
responsibility
on
the
HSE
.
that
be
my
view
.
I
will
relay
this
matter
to
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
,
on
behalf
of
the
Senator
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Frances
Fitzgerald
,
who
send
she
apology
,
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
the
issue
today
.
as
he
may
be
aware
,
in
the
light
of
public
safety
concern
highlight
by
a
Garda
Síochána
and
difficulty
in
the
interpretation
of
the
legislation
express
by
member
of
the
Judiciary
,
a
joint
working
group
of
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
and
the
Garda
be
establish
to
review
the
firearm
licensing
process
.
I
appreciate
that
state
the
obvious
,
but
it
be
important
to
record
it
in
the
House
.
the
report
of
the
working
group
be
publish
on
13
November
and
submission
on
the
report
have
be
seek
from
stakeholder
and
the
public
.
the
deadline
for
the
receipt
of
submission
be
31
January
2015
.
the
consultation
process
provide
individual
and
group
with
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
firearm
policy
and
legislation
and
will
enable
consideration
to
be
give
to
the
future
direction
of
such
legislation
.
the
minister
have
already
give
a
commitment
not
to
make
any
decision
until
she
have
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
all
the
submission
which
be
make
and
meet
the
key
stakeholder
,
include
the
organisation
who
represent
that
who
use
firearm
for
sport
purpose
.
the
minister
urge
all
concerned
to
engage
with
this
process
so
that
they
view
can
be
consider
before
final
decision
be
make
in
relation
to
this
matter
.
in
so
far
as
the
issue
of
the
Garda
Commissioner
's
guideline
be
concerned
,
I
understand
the
Senator
be
refer
to
annex
F
of
same
on
the
practical
application
and
operation
of
the
Firearms
Act
.
the
Garda
Commissioner
have
make
a
decision
with
ministerial
consent
to
issue
new
Garda
guideline
on
the
Firearms
Act
which
exclude
the
former
annex
F
.
the
interpretation
of
the
previous
annex
F
have
cause
difficulty
and
confusion
in
regard
to
application
for
firearm
certificate
for
.22
calibre
handgun
and
have
result
in
more
than
30
judicial
review
application
to
date
.
the
Senator
have
make
reference
to
this
state
of
affair
.
there
have
be
no
change
to
either
primary
or
secondary
legislation
as
a
result
of
amend
the
guideline
.

of
the

coalition
,
be
notify
early
this
month
of
both
the
new
Garda

F
and
the
current
position
that
,
in
effect
,
a
negative
decision
for
a
licence
for
.22
calibre
handgun
be
a
refusal
of
the
application
which
allow
for
a
appeal
of
that
decision
to
the
District
Court
.
to
summarise
a
key
point
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
I
note
that
no
decision
will
be
make
on
the
matter
until
such
time
as
she
have
have
a
opportunity
to
consider
the
submission
and
have
meet
the
key
stakeholder
.
I
concur
with
the
point
be
make
by
the
Senator
.
I
represent
a
urban
-
rural
constituency
and
have
hold
a
shotgun
in
my
time
for
the
same
purpose
as
many
people
who
live
in
rural
Ireland
in
respect
of
countryside
pursuit
.
while
I
concur
with
the
view
that
the
perception
within
the
lobby
that
there
have
be
a
heavy
-
handed
approach
must
be
address
,
I
take
in
good
faith
the
word
of
the
minister
when
she
say
she
will
sit
down
with
the
stakeholder
.
it
be
something
everyone
on
the
government
side
of
the
House
have
advocate
.
in
fairness
,
the
Senator
have
mention
Mr.
Des
Crofton
.
Mr.
Crofton
's
organisation
be
prodigious
and
consist
of
upstanding
citizen
.
I
know
this
people
and
have
engage
and
interact
with
they
.
the
Senator
mention
the
2006
Act
and
if
one
look
at
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Crofton
and
company
have
interact
with
the
2009
Act
,
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
they
have
act
absolutely
in
good
faith
and
continue
to
do
so
.
it
be
in
all
of
we
interest
to
chart
a
course
that
will
ensure
there
be
a
successful
outcome
and
that
we
recognise
the
value
of
this
lobby
within
Irish
society
.
it
be
prudent
that
the
community
be
involved
in
the
negotiation
and
whatever
consultation
process
be
take
place
,
it
be
very
important
that
the
community
be
aware
of
it
.
I
understand
the
concern
of
landowner
about
CPO
.
it
cause
consternation
in
community
when
we
do
very
large
infrastructural
project
.
however
,
have
listen
to
all
the
consider
opinion
of
the
local
on
the
greenway
,
it
be
in
the
main
a
positive

much
-
desire
tourist
project
which
will
be
a
win
-win
for
everybody
in
the
community
.
I
encourage

Senator

get
they
on

it
will
be
a

I
be
delighted
to
have
the

to
address
the
Seanad
today
at
the
beginning
of
what
may
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
year
in

this

will

will
I
proceed
?
however
,
before
we
look
forward
to
the
event
of
2015
,
I
would
like
to
take
a
look
back
at
some
of
the
key
achievement
and
process
of
Irish
Aid
in
the
past
year
.

I
encourage
all

to
read
the
document
,
which
be

because
it
be
easily
digestible

think
through

this
consider
the
challenge
and
opportunity
for
Ireland
in
a
new
globalised
world
under
five
closely
link
theme
:
we
value

,
we

and
we

out
Ireland

more

through

,
and
we
engagement
with

such
as

.
the
Global
Island
again
reaffirm
the
centrality
of
the
Irish
Aid
programme
to
we
foreign
policy
,
and
recognise
the
aid
programme
as
a
vital
tool
in
address
the
complex
factor
behind
poverty
,
hunger
and
inequality
.
we
will
continue
to
promote
development
as
a
key
part
of
we
value
and
we
foreign
policy
.
last
year
,
2014
,
be
also
a
year
which
present
massive
humanitarian
challenge
.
the
Ebola
crisis
and
a
unprecedented
refugee
crisis
arise
from
conflict
and
natural
disaster
cause
untold
suffering
and
put
a
heavy
strain
on
international
humanitarian
architecture
.
Ireland
play
a
strong
role
in
the
international
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
through
we
embassy
in
Sierra
Leone
and
we
support
to
partner
base
in
affect
country
.
almost
9000
people
have
die
from
infection
with
the
Ebola
virus
and
more
than
22000
people
be
report
to
have
be
infect
.
Ireland
provide
funding
of
almost
€
18
million
in
2014
directly
and
to
organisation
work
on
the
Ebola
response
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
,
which
be
both
partner
country
for
Ireland
.
the
funding
support
Ebola
treatment
facility
,
community
awareness
raising
,
contact
tracing
and
child
nutrition
programme
.
Ireland
also
dispatch
42
tonne
of
essential
household
item
as
part
of
we
rapid
response
initiative
,
to
be
distribute
to
affect
community
.
this
include
blanket
,
tent
,
mosquito
net
,
soap
and
water
tank
.
I
travel
to
Sierra
Leone
in
October
last
year
and
witness
the
difference
be
make
by
the
work
of
we
embassy
staff
and
Irish
Aid
's
support
to
we
partner
organisation
on
the
ground
.
I
meet
Irish
aid
worker
in
organisation
such
as
Goal
and
concern
,
as
well
as
the
Sierra
Leone
Government
and
UN
partner
.
while
the
challenge
be
overwhelming
,
I
be
hugely
impressed
with
the
dedication
of
that
work
to
alleviate
the
crisis
,
and
with
the
effectiveness
of
we
response
.
I
pay
particular
tribute
to
we
key
personnel
on
the
ground
,
include
we
ambassador
,
Ms
Sinead
Walsh
,
and
she
team
,
and
acknowledge
the
influential
role
she
have
have
in
ensure
a
adequate
and
proactive
international
response
to
the
crisis
.
there
appear
to
have
be
a
welcome
slowdown
in
infection
rate
in
recent
week
,
though
there
be
fluctuation
from
country
to
country
.
it
be
critical
,
however
,
that
we
be
not
complacent
as
a
international
community
.
Ireland
will
continue
to
support
the
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
and
its
secondary
impact
on
community
in
2015
.
the
ongoing
conflict
in
Syria
and
the
region
have
create
a
deeply
troubling
humanitarian
crisis
.
more
than
200000
people
have
die
,
with
12.2
million
people
in
need
of
immediate
life
-
save
support
within
Syria
.
due
to
the
violence
and
the
lack
of
access
to
aid
,
3.8
million
people
have
leave
Syria
for
neighbour
country
.
many
of
that
in
need
of
humanitarian
assistance
be
beyond
reach
,
with
both
the
Syrian
government
and
rebel
faction
use
siege
tactic
and
heavy
weaponry
in
populate
area
.
the
target
of
humanitarian
worker
by
Islamic
State
also
prevent
million
from
receive
the
help
they
desperately
need
.
the
UN
have
respond
by
deliver
cross
-
border
aid
,
even
where
the
Assad
regime
have
withheld
permission
.
since
2011
,
Ireland
have
provide
nearly
€
29
million
in
humanitarian
support
,
deliver
through
UN
partner
,
the
Red
Cross
and
Irish
ngo
.
Ireland
's
support
have
be
focus
on
support
people
displace
within
Syria
and
that
across
the
wide
region
.
in
December
2014
,
the
UN
release
its
2015
Syria
crisis
appeal
plan
,
request
more
than
$
8.4
billion
to
meet
the
need
of
18
million
people
in
Syria
and
across
the
region
.
we
be
consider
how
Ireland
can
well
respond
to
the
need
for
additional
assistance
in
2015
.
Ireland
be
also
continue
to
respond
to
acute
cris
in
South
Sudan
,
the
Central
African
Republic
and
Iraq
,
which
have
witness
displacement
of
huge
number
of
people
due
to
ongoing
violence
.
most
recently
,
we
have
mobilise
emergency
supplies
to
respond
to
the
devastating
flood
in
Malawi
,
as
part
of
we
rapid
response
initiative
and
in
co-ordination
with
we
embassy
in
Lilongwe
.
if
the
past
year
be
fill
with
important
milestone
for
Irish
aid
policy
and
programming
,
2015
promise
to
see
key
milestone
in
the
global
development
agenda
.
with
agreement
expect
on
a
set
of
sustainable
development
goal
and
a
intergovernmental
climate
change
deal
,
this
year
have
be
compare
to
1945
in
term
of
its
importance
to
world
development
.
the
sustainable
development
goal
will
be
a
set
of
universally
applicable
goal
and
target
negotiate
and
agree
by
the
world
's
193
country
.
they
be
aim
at
eradicate
poverty
,
address
environmental
degradation
and
climate
change
as
well
as
build
a
more
peaceful
,
fair
and
sustainable
world
.
the
goal
will
cover
such
diverse
area
as
agriculture
,
education
,
gender
equality
,
health
,
justice
,
employment
and
environmental
degradation
.
this
have
never
be
attempt
before
and
will
be
a
huge
achievement
for
humanity
if
successful
.
this
year
,
2015
,
will
also
see
agreement
on
how
to
finance
this
goal
at
the
financing
for
development
conference
in
Ethiopia
in
July
.
Ireland
be
privileged
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
sustainable
development
goal
process
follow
we
appointment
as
co-facilitator
with
Kenya
of
the
inter
-
governmental
negotiation
to
agree
the
goal
.
we
appointment
be
testament
to
the
reputation
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
,
Irish
Aid
,
we
proud
record
of
promote
human
rights
and
we
participation
in
peacekeeping
right
across
the
globe
.
this
final
phase
of
negotiation
officially
begin
on
19
January
and
will
culminate
in
a
summit
of
world
leader
in
September
2015
.
agreement
on
a
legally
bind
climate
change
treaty
will
be
another
critical
achievement
.
climate
change
have
already
negatively
affect
the
life
of
million
of
people
in
the
world
,
from
small
farmer
in
Africa
to
that
in
the
small
island
state
of
the
Pacific
.
if
we
fail
to
act
quickly
and
radically
,
we
be
on
course
to
make
we
own
planet
uninhabitable
for
vast
number
of
people
.
that
may
sound
verbose
but
that
be
the
scenario
we
be
face
.
indeed
,
recent
weather
pattern
be
testament
to
that
fact
.
I
be
proud
that
Ireland
be
play
such
a
key
role
in
establish
this
new
global
agenda
and
I
look
forward
to
ensure
that
we
contribute
to
a
new
era
of
global
development
where
poverty
and
hunger
be
consign
to
history
.
I
thank
the
acting
chairman
and
member
for
the
opportunity
to
address
the
Seanad
this
afternoon
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
work
we
have
do
in
the
past
year
and
to
highlight
some
of
the
important
upcoming
issue
for
this
year
.
I
look
forward
to
we
discussion
and
any
feedback
or
question
Senator
may
have
.
there
be
eight
country
in
Africa
and
Vietnam
.
just
for
the
record
,
it
be
important
that
I
correct
that
assertion
utterly
.
I
be
happy
to
address
it
in
my
reply
and
I
be
aware
that
the
Senator
only
have
five
minute
,
but
we
do
not
tie
we
aid
.
we
have
a
Africa
strategy
as
well
as
the
Africa
Ireland
economic
Forum
.
I
would
be
happy
to
address
the
Senator
's
point
but
,
for
the
record
,
we
do
not
use
we
Irish
Aid
budget
for
trade
promotion
.
I
thank
all
of
the
Senator
for
they
contribution
.
I
will
start
with
oda
and
percentage
target
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
target
be
set
in
1973
.
since
then
,
there
have
not
be
a
government
that
have
reach
they
.
the
high
point
be
reach
in
2008
when
we
hit
approximately
0.59
%
,
or
a
monetary
figure
of
€
920.6
million
.
I
regard
this
as
a
apolitical
space
because
,
throughout
successive
government
,
every
political
party
and
Independent
in
the
House
have
acknowledge
the
need
to
ensure
that
,
in
the
first
instance
,
we
recognise
how
official
development
assistance
play
a
key
role
in
we
foreign
policy
and
impact
on
the
poor
country
.
while
there
have
be
a
30
%
decrease
in
ODA
since
2008
across
a
number
of
political
mandate
,
there
be
a
recognition
that
,
in
the
past
two
year
,
we
have
try
to
stabilise
it
.
we
do
stabilise
it
last
year
,
and
increase
it
.
while
a
point
be
raise
about
a
decrease
in
some
of
the
bilateral
funding
and
a
increase
in
multilateral
funding
,
the
fact
remain
that
,
through
we
multilateral
arrangement
and
relationship
with
the
World
food
Programme
or
the
UN
agency
,
it
still
continue
to
create
the
necessary
impact
.
the
tyre
be
kick
on
this
policy
by
virtue
of
the
dac
or
the
OECD
report
which
give
we
a
clean
bill
of
health
.
there
be
one
further
point
on
the
ODA
as
a
percentage
of
GNP
figure
.
Ireland
be
rank
ninth
of
OECD
country
and
seventh
of
EU
country
.
the
country
ahead
of
we
in
the
OECD
list
of
country
include
Norway
.
its
figure
be
1.07
.
Norway
,
Sweden
,
Luxembourg
,
Denmark
and
the
UK
be
ahead
of
we
in
the
sense
that
they
have
reach
or
surpass
the
target
.
however
,
we
be
ninth
in
the
ranking
.
the
Netherlands
,
Finland
and
Switzerland
be
ahead
of
we
but
have
not
have
reach
the
target
and
they
be
comparatively
rich
country
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
by
any
objective
standard
,
do
quite
well
in
term
of
seek
to
reach
the
target
.
however
,
we
have
not
take
we
eye
off
the
ball
.
it
have
to
be
remember
that
the
target
be
set
and
successive
minister
,
across
the
political
spectrum
,
have
reinforce
the
commitment
to
it
.
it
be
in
the
programme
for
government
,
but
what
we
have
seek
to
do
in
the
programme
for
government
be
increase
we
level
of
assistance
in
monetary
term
.
however
,
we
be
not
go
to
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
this
be
clear
.
furthermore
,
the
next
government
,
whatever
its
make
-
up
in
term
of
party
politics
,
will
also
not
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
try
to
stabilise
the
monetary
element
of
it
and
increase
it
if
we
can
.
it
would
be
necessary
to
pay
out
more
than
€
1
billion
in
the
current
year
if
we
be
to
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
this
be
not
attainable
give
other
demand
on
education
and
health
service
and
so
on
.
on
compliance
and
governance
issue
in
respect
of
how
we
dispense
the
funding
,
the
Ugandan
experience
be
mention
.
we
meet
the
select
Committee
on
foreign
affair
and
Trade
last
week
as
part
of
the
estimate
process
.
I
have
outline
previously
at
that
committee
that
we
be
very
satisfied
that
all
of
the
check
and
balance
be
in
place
on
how
we
funding
be
disperse
.
although
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
Uganda
,
there
have
be
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
funding
we
have
give
to
it
.
we
be
currently
review
the
programme
.
since
that
event
take
place
,
we
have
recover
the
money
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
and
very
clear
check
and
balance
have
be
put
in
place
.
we
do
not
tie
we
aid
,
as
other
country
do
,
to
the
purchase
of
Irish
goods
and
service
.
we
deliberately
do
not
do
this
.
when
disburse
aid
through
,
for
instance
,
we
ngo
,
Irish
Aid
or
the
UN
for
stock
,
we
do
not
stipulate
that
particular
Irish
stock
must
be
buy
.
we
require
transparency
and
a
chain
of
event
to
ensure
we
know
where
the
money
be
go
.
we
be
satisfied
with
this
approach
.
if
we
start
tie
aid
to
particular
action
,
we
be
leave
ourselves
open
to
become
a
hostage
to
fortune
.
the
reason
it
have
work
so
well
for
we
historically
,
since
Garrett
FitzGerald
first
instigate
a
Irish
aid
programme
,
be
because
we
have
have
a
honesty
in
we
approach
to
people
.
we
have
never
come
with
a
agenda
.
at
the
same
time
,
this
do
not
mean
that
we
cannot
look
at
Africa
as
a
continent
with
1.1
billion
people
with
which
we
can
trade
.
we
trade
with
country
such
as
Japan
,
where
we
have
a
ambassador
and
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
representative
.
we
have
bilateral
relationship
with
eight
partner
country
in
Africa
.
if
we
take
one
of
the
eight
partner
country
,
for
instance
,
Sierra
Leone
,
Kenya
or
Nigeria
,
there
be
no
reason
we
cannot
,
through
ambassadorial
or
bilateral
relationship
,
seek
to
trade
with
this
country
as
well
.
we
have
a
Africa
strategy
.
every
year
we
have
a
Ireland
-
Africa
economic
forum
.
I
will
dig
out
the
statistic
which
I
write
down
early
.
we
have
increase
trade
.
in
2010
,
we
trade
on
a
Ireland
-
Africa
basis
be
approximately
€
1.7
billion
.
in
2013
,
it
go
up
to
€
2.3
billion
.
I
may
be
pluck
this
figure
from
the
air
,
but
by
2020
there
be
the
potential
for
€
20
billion
in
trade
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
it
be
€
24
billion
.
we
be
absolutely
right
to
examine
and
set
this
as
a
target
.
there
be
not
a
senator
in
this
House
who
have
not
have
some
experience
of
a
humanitarian
visit
to
various
country
.
when
at
this
refugee
camp
or
when
visit
particular
area
where
Irish
Aid
be
involved
,
one
might
see
a
mother
who
may
have
travel
200
mile
with
she
child
from
south
Sudan
to
Gambella
.
look
at
the
child
,
one
cannot
but
wonder
how
we
can
help
to
educate
this
child
in
order
that
they
can
become
entrepreneur
and
have
access
to
health
and
educational
service
similar
to
ours
.
how
can
they
become
entrepreneur
?
one
way
of
look
at
this
be
to
share
what
we
do
well
,
through
we
innovation
system
,
with
that
grow
number
of
people
.
the
figure
be
more
than
1.1
billion
.
there
have
be
a
increase
of
2
million
year
on
year
in
the
number
of
people
live
in
Ethiopia
.
it
be
about
trading
service
as
well
as
assist
in
capacity
building
.
the
two
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
Senator
Higgins
mention
the
Alan
Kerins
project
.
Irish
people
be
deliver
excellent
people
on
the
ground
through
the
Alan
Kerins
project
and
through
GOAL
,
Gorta
,
self
help
Africa
and
concern
.
we
will
continue
to
be
commit
to
the
development
agenda
and
the
humanitarian
agenda
.
however
,
we
must
also
focus
on
how
we
can
trade
more
efficiently
,
that
be
,
through
mutually
beneficial
trade
in
a
non-tied
way
in
order
that
we
can
trade
with
what
be
a
sleeping
giant
of
a
continent
.
we
be
lucky
that
we
do
not
look
at
it
from
a
homogenous
point
of
view
.
we
do
not
say
that
Africa
be
one
continent
with
one
people
.
we
recognise
the
fact
that
Sierra
Leone
be
different
from
South
Africa
which
be
different
from
Nigeria
.
we
be
lucky
that
we
have
relationship
with
all
three
of
this
country
and
we
must
continue
to
look
for
trading
opportunity
with
they
.
I
take
the
point
Senator
Burke
make
on
humanitarian
cris
.
to
be
fair
to
we
,
if
one
take
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
Syria
-
I
have
outline
some
of
the
figure
-
or
the
Ebola
crisis
in
west
Africa
as
example
,
we
have
be
able
,
in
a
very
reflexive
way
,
to
pivot
towards
this
cris
when
they
occur
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
have
people
on
the
ground
.
if
one
take
Gaza
,
for
instance
,
which
be
mention
,
it
be
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
relationship
through
we
office
in
Ramallah
that
we
have
be
able
to
fund
the
humanitarian
cris
there
.
on
Syria
,
much
of
the
funding
be
divest
through
multilateral
organisation
because
we
do
not
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
it
.
a
flexibility
have
be
build
into
the
Irish
system
by
successive
government
to
ensure
Irish
Aid
be
adequately
fund
in
order
that
it
can
pivot
its
funding
opportunity
as
the
cris
arise
.
the
issue
of
human
rights
be
raise
and
I
appreciate
the
point
be
make
in
respect
of
Nigeria
,
for
instance
.
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
Nigeria
.
it
would
be
easy
for
we
to
say
we
should
not
fund
particular
country
because
of
a
human
rights
or
governance
record
,
or
a
lack
thereof
.
we
view
have
always
be
that
if
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
we
ensure
the
funding
get
to
that
people
who
be
most
in
need
.
the
people
who
be
most
in
need
be
sometimes
not
well
serve
by
they
own
government
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
depend
on
we
.
the
governance
we
have
,
the
honesty
we
bring
as
a
country
to
we
relationship
with
various
country
and
we
lack
of
a
colonial
history
or
baggage
,
by
which
I
mean
we
have
not
go
out
to
colonise
,
allow
we
to
influence
human
rights
in
a
very
subtle
and
discreet
way
,
which
we
do
over
time
.
Ethiopia
be
one
of
we
long
-
stand
key
partner
country
,
and
Addis
Ababa
be
the
diplomatic
capital
of
Africa
.
a
recent
visit
by
President
Michael
D.
Higgins
,
who
address
the
African
Union
,
serve
as
a
opportunity
to
impart
message
to
the
African
Union
that
for
the
relationship
to
be
equal
they
must
be
such
that
human
rights
become
a
key
function
or
pillar
in
any
African
nation
's
governance
.
we
do
not
do
it
with
a
sledgehammer
but
through
subtle
diplomacy
,
and
this
have
allow
we
to
make
progress
over
time
.
the
issue
of
climate
change
have
be
raise
as
have
the
sustainable
development
goal
.
recently
I
visit
Africa
.
if
one
look
at
the
work
Irish
Aid
be
do
there
,
through
key
partner
on
the
ground
and
specifically
at
the
work
be
do
to
assist
farmer
in
Tigre
,
which
be
the
scene
of
the
famous
famine
of
the
early
to
mid-1980
,
one
can
see
how
agricultural
system
have
come
on
greatly
.
one
of
the
programme
in
the
area
be
on
potato
generation
.
this
could
all
be
compromise
by
climate
change
if
there
be
a
2
°c
rise
in
temperature
globally
.
we
take
very
seriously
we
role
in
negotiate
the
sustainable
development
goal
in
co-facilitation
with
Kenya
.
the
reason
we
do
so
be
because
we
be
mindful
of
the
relationship
we
have
in
the
country
which
be
most
affect
by
climate
change
.
we
know
we
people
who
work
with
people
there
,
which
bring
a
honesty
,
openness
and
transparency
to
how
we
will
approach
the
negotiation
.
we
be
not
weigh
down
with
the
baggage
of
have
be
a
coloniser
.
we
know
exactly
what
it
be
like
in
the
first
instance
and
we
be
able
to
speak
for
that
country
which
will
need
Ireland
to
be
at
they
back
and
be
a
honest
broker
in
this
association
throughout
2015
.
rather
than
specifically
address
every
member
I
have
address
general
point
.
I
hope
I
have
adequately
address
the
point
on
the
percentage
of
GNP
target
and
the
issue
of
compliance
and
transparency
with
regard
to
Uganda
and
tie
aid
.
I
ask
Senator
O'Reilly
to
forgive
I
for
interrupt
she
speech
.
I
be
conscious
that
Senator
must
leave
to
attend
other
meeting
,
and
I
want
to
ensure
I
be
able
to
clarify
the
point
in
case
she
need
to
leave
,
but
she
be
still
here
.
I
hope
I
have
generally
speak
to
the
issue
of
climate
change
and
the
sustainable
development
goal
.
it
be
not
for
I
to
speak
specifically
to
the
point
on
population
control
in
specific
country
.
we
be
very
strong
on
gender
equality
and
extremely
strong
on
the
issue
of
maternal
health
and
nutrition
as
it
be
one
of
we
priority
.
one
can
see
this
in
action
in
country
such
as
Sierra
Leone
and
Ethiopia
in
particular
.
we
be
also
extremely
strong
on
issue
such
as
fistula
which
,
I
be
shocked
to
stay
,
still
exist
.
Ethiopia
have
set
target
for
itself
.
the
idea
that
in
instance
a
pregnant
woman
cannot
get
to
a
centre
in
enough
time
to
be
able
to
give
birth
in
a
safe
environment
be
,
to
my
mind
,
shocking
.
we
be
work
very
hard
with
we
partner
to
try
to
tackle
this
issue
.
with
regard
to
Syria
specifically
,
we
have
allocate
€
29
million
since
2011
to
the
crisis
there
.
in
geopolitical
term
it
be
a
major
challenge
.
we
all
acknowledge
this
and
it
be
self
-
evident
.
through
we
investment
we
have
ensure
we
be
work
with
the
Irish
ngo
on
the
ground
,
the
Red
Cross
in
particular
,
and
the
Unite
Nation
through
multilateral
arrangement
.
we
be
now
see
a
situation
arise
in
Lebanon
where
certain
tension
be
begin
to
emerge
between
Lebanese
people
and
the
Syrian
refugee
there
.
we
be
monitor
it
and
I
know
for
a
fact
we
will
retain
a
focus
on
Syria
.
we
continue
to
monitor
it
proactively
.

I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
have
fund
men’
shed
project
under
both
the
rural
development
fund
and
the
leader
element
of
the
2007
to
2013
rural
development
programme
.
funding
have
be
provide
to
renovate
building
to
house
this
type
of
initiative
and
also
for
tool
and
equipment
.
since
the
downturn
in
the
construction
industry
in
particular
,
some
man
have
find
themselves
become
unemployed
and
,
in
some
rural
area
such
as
Boyle
and
Dysart
,
County
Roscommon
,
this
have
lead
to
situation
of
isolation
for
individual
.
man
's
shed
project
have
play
a
important
part
in
address
this
situation
,
support
initiative
where
new
friendship
have
be
develop
and
community
have
benefit
from
the
product
and
service
provide
.
there
be
almost
220
men'
shed
in
Ireland
with
over
7000
member
.
some
wonderful
project
have
grow
from
this
initiative
such
as
the
restoration
of
old
farm
machinery
to
the
production
of
some
fantastic
wooden
piece
.
they
have
help
man
in
several
community
to
come
together
to
work
on
initiative
which
they
might
not
have
do
otherwise
.
the
government
,
through
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
provide
support
and
funding
to
community
,
urban
and
rural
,
which
enable
they
to
identify
and
address
issue
and
priority
for
action
in
they
own
area
.
community
have
identify
men'
shed
project
as
a
priority
for
funding
in
they
area
.
many
project
of
this
nature
have
be
fund
under
the
Leader
element
of
the
rural
Development
Programme
2007
-
2013
.
on
future
funding
of
this
project
,
€
250
million
will
be
provide
under
the
forthcoming
leader
element
of
the
rural
Development
Programme
2014
-
2020
to
support
the
sustainable
development
of
rural
community
across
the
country
.
this
funding
will
be
deliver
use
a
community
-
lead
local
development
approach
base
on
local
development
strategy
.
this
strategy
will
be
design
and
implement
by
local
action
group
.
it
should
be
note
that
all
decision
relate
to
funding
for
specific
project
,
include
that
relate
to
men'
shed
will
be
a
matter
for
the
local
action
group
and
will
be
make
base
on
the
need
and
priority
that
the
group
have
identify
in
they
local
development
strategy
.
this
type
of
decision
-
making
be
at
the
heart
of
sustainable
development
in
rural
community
.
we
be
all
firm
believer
in
leave
decision
in
the
hand
of
the
people
who
know
they
community
well
.
I
can
assure
the
Senator
that
funding
for
this
type
of
activity
will
be
eligible
under
the
programme
,
provide
that
it
be
include
in
the
relevant
area
's
leader
strategy
.
I
will
relay
the
issue
raise
by
Senator
Kelly
to
the
minister
.
there
be
also
a
opportunity
for
the
national
men'
shed
umbrella
organisation
to
potentially
use
its
leverage
to
attain
membership
of
the
local
action
group
.
I
believe
that
the
stakeholder
model
,
in
term
of
the
funding
that
have
be
espouse
by
Senator
Kelly
,
in
which
the
HSE
be
a
actor
,
could
become
a
major
influencer
for
fund
this
activity
.
I
do
not
see
any
reason
the
umbrella
organisation
could
not
become
part
of
the
local
area
group
and
thereby
influence
funding
decision
at
the
most
democratic
level
.
I
will
certainly
relay
the
Senator
's
concern
to
the
minister
.
I
fully
endorse
the
concern
express
by
Senator
Power
.
the
Syrian
conflict
have
be
a
litany
of
unimaginable
horror
.
more
than
half
the
population
have
be
displace
by
violence
and
almost
two
third
of
Syrian
,
12
million
people
,
be
in
need
of
humanitarian
assistance
.
less
than
half
of
Syria
's
hospital
be
fully
function
and
around
one
quarter
of
school
have
be
damage
,
destroy
or
convert
into
shelter
.
this
have
leave
more
than
2
million
child
without
full
-
time
education
,
jeopardise
the
future
of
the
next
generation
.
the
Assad
regime
's
permissive
approach
to
the
rise
of
jihadist
terrorist
group
like
ISIS
prove
that
the
regime
be
indifferent
to
the
safety
of
its
own
people
and
to
the
survival
of
minority
,
include
the
ancient
Christian
and
other
religious
minority
across
Syria
.
counter
the
horrific
brutality
and
extremist
ideology
of
this
group
be
essential
to
the
protection
of
vulnerable
minority
across
the
Middle
East
.
Ireland
have
call
on
the
Security
Council
to
refer
the
Syrian
conflict
to
the
International
criminal
Court
.
in
2014
,
Ireland
provide
€
14.9
million
in
funding
to
address
the
Syria
crisis
via
NGO
partner
,
the
Unite
Nation
and
the
Red
Cross
and
Red
Crescent
.
this
include
€
2.4
million
provide
in
2014
to
the
World
food
Programme
for
food
assistance
.
this
bring
the
total
funding
we
have
provide
since
the
beginning
of
the
crisis
to
almost
€
30
million
.
the
need
be
enormous
.
it
be
not
just
a
matter
of
provide
aid
but
also
of
ensure
that
it
can
get
through
to
the
people
who
most
need
it
.
this
be
particularly
difficult
inside
Syria
due
to
government
bureaucracy
,
the
hazard
of
the
ongoing
conflict
and
the
threat
to
humanitarian
personnel
,
which
make
it
all
but
impossible
to
work
in
ISIS
-
control
area
.
the
UN
have
authorise
the
delivery
of
cross
-
border
assistance
even
without
Syrian
government
permission
,
as
well
as
delivery
across
conflict
line
,
in
a
effort
to
reach
as
many
people
as
possible
.
Ireland
use
a
number
of
different
partner
to
deliver
we
aid
in
order
to
ensure
the
great
access
possible
and
to
support
refugee
and
host
community
in
neighbour
country
.
due
to
the
violence
and
the
lack
of
access
to
aid
,
huge
number
of
people
have
leave
Syria
,
primarily
overland
into
neighbour
country
.
some
3.8
million
Syrian
have
fly
they
country
and
that
number
grow
every
day
.
Essential
service
such
as
health
,
education
and
access
to
water
be
under
pressure
in
Lebanon
,
Jordan
and
Turkey
.
one
in
three
people
in
Lebanon
be
refugee
,
place
the
entire
country
under
great
strain
.
Syria
's
neighbour
be
also
suffer
security
incident
from
the
spillover
of
the
conflict
.
Ireland
and
its
EU
partner
have
consistently
support
the
core
principle
of
a
end
to
violence
and
a
political
transition
to
a
representative
government
represent
Syrian
from
all
community
,
as
set
out
in
the
2012
Geneva
communiqué
.
we
have
also
express
we
support
for
the
conflict
freeze
initiative
propose
by
UN
special
envoy
,
Staffan
di
Mistura
,
who
meet
with
EU
foreign
minister
in
December
.
despite
the
failure
of
past
effort
to
negotiate
a
end
to
the
violence
,
we
have
a
duty
to
continue
work
for
a
political
resolution
to
the
conflict
and
will
continue
to
work
towards
that
end
.
I
agree
with
everything
the
Senator
be
say
.
in
fairness
to
Ireland
,
from
a
humanitarian
point
of
view
the
commitment
of
€
30
million
since
2011
be
significant
.
there
be
a
major
challenge
in
get
that
through
to
the
people
who
need
it
the
most
.
the
Senator
will
be
aware
that
there
be
a
donor
pledge
conference
,
Kuwait
iii
,
come
up
on
31
March
to
seek
support
for
the
UN
's
humanitarian
response
.
we
be
currently
consider
we
pledge
in
respect
of
that
conference
.
on
the
security
situation
,
the
no-fly
zone
and
the
conflict
on
the
ground
,
Ireland
be
play
its
part
and
it
have
to
be
state
that
the
Unite
Nation
,
and
in
particular
the
Security
Council
,
have
to
address
the
failure
to
uphold
international
humanitarian
assistance
in
Syria
.
it
have
to
look
at
the
deliberate
target
of
civilian
and
minority
group
.
there
be
a
function
there
for
the
Security
Council
and
,
through
its
own
diplomatic
channel
,
Ireland
have
also
be
seek
a
resolution
.
Syria
have
now
move
from
be
the
world
's
second
-
large
refugee
hosting
country
to
be
the
large
refugee
produce
country
within
a
span
of
just
seven
year
.
as
a
government
and
as
a
nation
,
we
fully
recognise
the
extent
of
this
crisis
.
I
believe
strongly
that
we
can
deliver
a
further
commitment
of
funding
towards
the
humanitarian
element
through
work
with
the
ngo
on
the
ground
.
I
note
the
point
that
have
be
make
on
the
bond
and
the
no-fly
zone
and
will
certainly
relay
they
back
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
and
the
Senator
might
want
to
check
what
I
say
against
delivery
.
under
section
60
(
3
)
of
the
Waste
Management
Act
1996
,
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
be
preclude
from
exercising
any
power
or
control
regard
the
performance
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
or
a
local
authority
in
particular
circumstance
of
a
statutory
function
vested
in
it
,
include
enforcement
function
.
issue
concern
the
enforcement
of
waste
management
legislation
in
particular
case
,
therefore
,
fall
to
be
pursue
with
the
EPA
or
the
relevant
local
authority
,
as
appropriate
.
the
treatment
and
management
of
waste
material
be
subject
to
a
registration
and
permitting
system
by
local
authority
or
licensing
by
the
EPA
,
depend
on
the
circumstance
.
the
particular
facility
the
Senator
refer
to
be
license
by
the
EPA
and
it
be
understand
that
the
EPA
,
in
the
context
of
its
role
as
the
licensing
authority
,
be
prepare
a
report
which
will
be
make
available
on
completion
.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
licensing
,
permitting
and
registration
system
be
to
facilitate
appropriate
control
on
waste
facility
and
activity
so
as
to
ensure
good
and
consistent
waste
management
practice
and
the
implementation
of
high
standard
of
environmental
protection
.
I
refer
to
the
government
's
waste
policy
publish
in
2012
,
a
resource
opportunity
-
waste
management
policy
in
Ireland
.
I
acknowledge
there
be
a
group
comprise
of
representative
from
local
authority
also
and
that
this
group
have
make
recommendation
for
the
rationalisation
of
waste
enforcement
function
.
however
,
for
the
purpose
of
address
the
concern
of
the
Senator
it
be
acknowledge
on
the
record
that
the
former
minister
direct
the
EPA
to
carry
out
a
report
and
that
the
report
would
be
make
available
on
completion
.
I
be
reinforce
that
message
today
.
I
do
not
have
a
definitive
timeframe
as
to
when
it
will
occur
but
I
would
be
happy
to
engage
further
with
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
to
see
if
we
can
get
further
information
as
to
when
we
could
expect
the
publication
of
the
report
.
speak
on
behalf
of
the
government
,
we
fully
expect
the
report
to
be
publish
.
I
accept
the
Senator
be
not
suggest
that
we
should
exercise
undue
influence
.
the
legislation
be
very
clear
in
that
regard
.
however
,
it
could
be
pertinent
to
ask
when
we
might
expect
the
report
to
be
publish
.
to
my
mind
,
that
would
be
entirely
appropriate
.

I

a
extremely
difficult

which
have

by
the

in

from
a
administrative
point
of

.
they
expectation
be

only
to

,
a
issue
that
must
be
deal
with
by
the
HSE
.
I
be
deal
with
this
matter
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Health
and
have
be
provide
with
the
follow
information
.
scoliosis
in
child
and
young
people

at
we
Lady

Children
's
Hospital
,
Crumlin
.
it
be
acknowledge
that
wait
time
for
scoliosis
service
be
unsatisfactory
.
demand
have
be
increase
,
with
result
pressure
on
capacity
.
in
2014
the
hospital
have
agree
capacity
to
carry
out
58
full
spinal
case
per
year
as
part
of
its
annual
service
level
agreement
with
the
HSE
,
in

to
treat

at

in

for
the
appointment
of
a

a

this
will
maximise
the

at
the

.
recruitment
be
under
way
to
fill
this
post
,
which
be
expect
to
allow
for
a
additional
25
case
to
take
place
in
the
hospital
in
2015
.
despite
this
additional
capacity
in
2015
,
the
number
of
surgery
in
the
hospital
will
still
fall
short
of
what
be
require
to
deal
with
demand
.
the
HSE
,
the
child
's
hospital
group
and
Crumlin
hospital
be
work
together
on
a
ongoing
basis
to
identify
all
option
to

further
.
in
the
short
term
this
include
utilise

where
clinically
appropriate
.
in
the
medium
term
additional
laminar

theatre
capacity
will
be
develop
at
Crumlin
hospital
.
follow
a
appraisal
of
option
to
increase
theatre
capacity
,
the
HSE
have
recently
allocate
funding
for
this
development
.
while
it
be
not
appropriate
for
I
to
discuss
the
detail
of
a
particular
case
,
I
emphasise
,
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Health
,
we
determination
to
address
undue
waiting
time
for
all
that
require
scoliosis
service
.
the
minister
be
confident
that
the
increase
investment
I
have
outline
to
the
House
will
deliver
significant
improvement
in
scoliosis
service
capacity
.
the
case
raise
by
the
Senator
be
particularly
difficult
and
I
do
not
want
to
give
platitude
to
the
family
by
say
we
sympathise
and
empathise
with
they
.
there
be
a
particular
issue
concern
the
manner
in
which
they
be
deal
with
in
term
of
the
way
they
expectation
have
be
raise
.
perhaps
direct
intervention
by
the
minister
might
lead
to
further
light
be
shed
on
the
matter
for
the
young
man
concerned
.
as
a
member
of
the
Oireachtas
,
the
Senator
have
the
facility
to
make
a
direct
approach
to
the
line
minister
.
I
absolutely
sympathise
with
this
teenager
in
he
predicament
and
,
in
fairness
to
the
Senator
,
she
have
protect
he
anonymity

his
case
need
to
be
take
up
directly
with
the

or
a

of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
.
as
the
Senator
point
out
,
several

have
be
cancel
and
the
boy

expectation
and
that
of
he
family
have
be

that

must

the

today
form

of
measure

by
consensus
by
member
state
in
July
and
Ireland

the
proposal
.
since
the
July
meeting
,
with
the
influx
of
refugee
through
the
western
Balkans
in
particular
increase
dramatically
,
it
become
clear
that

the
distribution
of
the
person
to
be

across
member
state
be
set
out
in
the
annex
to
the
decision
.
Ireland
have
not
be
include
in
the
annex
because
we
do
not
opt
in

the
proposal
before
it

.
it
be
estimate
that
Ireland
's
allocation
under
this
decision
will
be
in

people
.
in

to
the

.
the
make
-
up
of
the
balance
be
yet
to
be
decide
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
person

here
under
this
programme
will
also
have
a
entitlement
,
once
they

a

.
the
Minister

first
meeting
on

by
all
of

the
Office

the

also
show
great
generosity
,
offer
support
and
assistance
,
include
accommodation
,
to
that
who
may
be
relocate

of
draw
together
this
offer
of

manner
.
on
Monday
,
the
Red

launch
its
website
to
enable
member
of
the
public
to
formally
register
they
pledge
.
on
my
own
behalf
and
that
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
and
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
I
express
sincere
gratitude
to
the
Red
Cross
for
agree
to
take
on
this
substantial
role
.
the
government
also
approve
the
establishment
of
a
network
of
emergency
reception
and
orientation
centre
for
the
initial
acceptance
and
processing
of
that
in
need
of
international
protection
who
be
accept
into
Ireland
under
the
EU
programme
.
in
view
of
the
profile
of
the
relocation
applicant
,
it
be
expect
they
application
for
protection
will
be
process
in
a
matter
of
week
and
many
will
be
grant
refugee
status
.
we
have
all
be
shocked
and
upset
at
the
scene
witness
in
southern
and
central
Europe
and
the
distressing
scene
during
rescue
in
the
Mediterranean
.
Ireland
have
always
live
up
to
its
international
humanitarian
obligation
,
as
be
evidence
by
we
resettlement
programme
which
have
see
almost
500
people
resettle
here
since
2009
,
we
send
of
naval
vessel
to
assist
in
search
and
rescue
operation
in
the
Mediterranean
and
the
introduction
of
a
Syrian
humanitarian
admission
programme
last
year
which
involve
114
people
be
grant
permission
to
come
here
.
by
opt
into
this
decision
we
will
not
only
provide
a
safe
haven
for
family
and
child
who
be
force
to
leave
they
home
due
to
war
and
conflict
but
will
also
show
solidarity
with
other
EU
member
state
whose
protection
system
be
under
enormous
pressure
due
to
the
large
influx
of
migrant
.
I
reassure
the
House
that
from
a
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
perspective
,
through
Irish
Aid
,
we
will
continue
to
work
with
international
and
Irish
ngo
in
the
particular
geography
affect
by
the
crisis
to
try
to
support
people
in
they
home
country
.
I
commend
the
motion
to
the
House
.
not
true
.
we
do
more
than
that
,
which
I
shall
explain
late
to
the
Senator
.
it
be
not
just
about
the
number
of
people
we
be
take
.
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
what
do
the
Senator
mean
by
say
the
United
Nation
have
not
do
enough
?
the
Senator
should
clarify
the
point
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
I
thank
Senator
for
what
have
be
a
extensive
interaction
about
this
issue
.
if
I
read
the
room
,
so
to
speak
,
I
imagine
that
in
the
main
the
Seanad
support
the
opt-in
or
the
protocol
that
be
to
be
provide
in
term
of
the
Council
decision
.
I
acknowledge
this
message
of
support
from
individual
member
of
the
Seanad
.
so
many
point
be
raise
today
and
I
will
do
my
good
to
address
they
.
I
want
to
nail
the
lie
that
the
government
have
respond
inadequately
to
this
crisis
.
it
and
,
by
extension
,
the
people
have
be
involved
in
it
since
2011
.
if
one
factor
out
Syria
,
one
realise
the
people
,
through
Irish
Aid
and
Irish
and
international
ngo
,
have
actually
commit
over
€
100
million
in
funding
.
this
have
be
achieve
through
multilateral
organisation
such
as
UNHCR
,
the
World
food
Programme
,
the
Unite
Nation
Office
for
the
Coordination
of
Humanitarian
affair
,
OCHA
,
and
international
ngo
.
in
this
regard
,
Ireland
have
commit
a
considerable
amount
of
funding
,
€
100
million
in
total
,
to
seek
to
ensure
there
be
in
-
country
or
in
-
region
solution
and
that
aid
be
disburse
in
a
way
in
which
it
reach
that
most
in
need
.
member
will
know
the
UN
General
Assembly
be
in
session
last
week
and
have
be
in
session
for
part
of
this
week
.
Ireland
continue
to
support
a
referral
by
the
UN
Security
Council
of
the
case
of
Syria
to
the
International
criminal
Court
.
it
also
seek
accountability
for
the
multiple
war
crime
commit
during
the
conflict
.
however
,
we
all
have
to
recognise
that
Irish
foreign
policy
be
absolutely
or
partly
tie
into
a
EU
position
,
as
Senator
Paul
Bradford
state
,
but
we
continue
to
lobby
and
hold
bilateral
meeting
with
other
country
on
the
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
political
solution
to
this
crisis
within
the
region
.
the
need
for
political
stability
be
paramount
.
owe
to
the
political
instability
,
there
be
a
humanitarian
crisis
.
it
be
sad
and
shocking
that
it
take
the
image
of
a
small
boy
on
a
beach
for
a
political
response
to
emerge
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
Senator
on
the
European
Union
response
.
I
have
state
at
development
minister
's
meeting
that
the
establishment
of
a
EU
trust
fund
still
raise
many
question
about
the
response
.
sometimes
at
EU
level
,
there
be
a
legitimate
critique
of
the
tardiness
of
the
response
and
of
the
potential
to
create
duplication
in
the
pan-European
response
where
there
be
no
need
for
it
.
last
week
I
have
bilateral
meeting
with
Mr.
Stephen
O'Brien
from
OCHA
and
Mr.
António
guterres
from
the
UNHCR
on
the
need
of
they
organisation
.
with
regard
to
Ireland
's
foreign
affair
response
,
the
scarce
resource
we
have
be
be
deploy
increasingly
to
deal
with
humanitarian
cris
and
we
have
to
focus
on
the
long
-
term
development
goal
that
actually
lead
to
political
stability
or
enhance
political
stability
in
the
very
region
that
we
be
talk
about
.
therefore
,
there
be
a
major
challenge
for
the
world
.
Ireland
be
seek
to
do
what
it
can
multilaterally
and
bilaterally
,
politically
,
developmentally
and
in
term
of
humanitarian
assistance
,
to
bring
about
great
involvement
by
the
very
country
that
have
be
refer
to
,
particularly
that
in
the
Middle
East
,
which
be
not
devoid
of
resource
.
this
be
to
ensure
they
assist
people
within
they
own
region
.
a
global
political
response
be
require
.
I
acknowledge
absolutely
the
point
that
have
be
make
in
that
regard
.
there
be
a
cross
-
departmental
and
agency
task
force
.
its
role
be
to
co-ordinate
and
implement
the
logistical
and
operational
aspect
of
the
Irish
refugee
protection
programme
,
which
I
outline
early
.
I
cannot
name
all
40
stakeholder
on
the
task
force
because
I
just
do
not
have
that
information

the
reception
.
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
have
not
yet
pass
the
actual
motion
,
but
we
be
work
as
a
state
with
all
the
stakeholder
to
try
to
organise
all
the
dynamic
that
obtain
when
4000
additional

be
bring
into

there
will
be
a
increase
in

say
.

with

the

represent
on

we
have
to
think
of
this
in

of

also
.

I
would
love

see
a
great

of
visibility
in

Northern

response
to
this
very
issue
.
we
be
do
we
good
to

we
have
a

that
include

the

and
the

of

be
currently
carry
out
a

the
Irish
Red
Cross
have
be
give
the
task
of
communicate
with
the
public
and
assess
,
profiling
and
co-ordinate
offer
of
public
support
and
accommodation
.
this
have
be
refer
to
by
quite
a
few
Senator
,
especially
that
from
the
west
.
early
this
week
the
Irish
Red
Cross
set
up
a
dedicated
website
to
enable
member
of
the
public
to
formally
register
they
pledge
.
the
Department

Health
,
Education

Protection
and
relevant
agency
such
as
the
HSE
and
Tusla
will
provide

support
.
once
the
4000
people
be
grant
status
,
they
will
be
able
to
apply
for
family
reunification
.
that
be
one
of
the
issue
raise
.
as
I
say
,
Tusla
be
engage
with
the
HSE
to
ensure
the
well
-
being
of
child
be
protect
.
the
international
protection
Bill
be
expect
to
be
publish
in
the
come
week
and
enact
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
this
new
legislation
will
significantly
improve
arrangement
for
the
processing
of
asylum
application
and
greatly
reduce
the
time
person
spend
in
the
direct
provision
system
.
today
be
about
get
permission
to
opt-in
.
we
have
no
indication
as
to
whether
we
arrival
will
be
single
person
or
family
and
,
therefore
,
there
be
still
a
way
to
go
on
that
issue
.
the
task
force
have
a
specific
committee
chair
by
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
to
liaise
directly
with
ngo
to
provide
support
service
,
on
which
I
can
provide
further
clarification
.
a
total
of
180
additional
staff
have
be
allocate
to
support
the
programme
.
that
who
come
here
have
a
strong
likelihood
of
qualifying
for
status
and
the
government
have
approve
additional
staff
resource
for
processing
which
should
lead
to
a
fast
granting
of
status
,
possibly
week
after
arrival
.
the
issue
of
the
wording
"
to
the
benefit
of
Italy
and
Greece
"
be
raise
.
that
be
the
wording
of
the
Council
agreement
.
we
all
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
serious
deficiency
in
the
direct
provision
system
,
but
it
have
not
fail
to
provide
accommodation
,
food
and
other
support
for
all
asylum
seeker
who
have
come
to
the
State
in
the
past
15
year
,
which
should
be
acknowledge
.
from
a
cross-party
point
of
view
,
we
all
openly
acknowledge
that
the
government
be
try
to
rectify
the
position
and
,
by
any
objective
standard
,
we
have
do
a
good
job
.
I
have
just
acknowledge
the
deficiency
.
I
understand
the
need
for
rhetoric
and
histrionics
also
.
we
will
seek
to
preserve
the
dignity
of
the
person
who
come
to
this
island
and
make
sure
matter
be
expedite
,
utilise
all
the
stakeholder

,
include

I
welcome
the
additional
allocation
for
Bord
Bia
.
on
a
technical
level
,
do
the
minister
have
complete
discretion
on
allocate
funding
in
this
manner
?
could
the
funding
have
be
allocate
elsewhere
if
she
so
decide
?
be
there
a
danger
that
the
funding
allocate
could
be
use
to
market
pigmeat
that
be
not
of
Irish
origin
?
to
elaborate
on
deputy
Creed
's
contribution
,
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
have
quality
-
assure
bacon
,
but
if
the
labelling
regime
be
not
back
up
adequately
by
legislation
to
ensure
it
be
know
what
meat
be
of
Irish
origin
,
there
be
a
danger
that
non-Irish
produce
will
be
market
.
be
there
scope
to
define
clearly
what
be
of
Irish
origin
?
there
be
no
doubt
about
the
merit
of
the
work
do
by
Bord
Bia
when
one
consider
the
amount
of
food
Ireland
export
annually
.
however
,
the
pigmeat
industry
would
probably
like
great
support
or
increase
funding
from
the
Department
to
ensure
the
labelling
regime
be
strengthen
legislatively
to
guarantee
that
brand
cannot
be
pass
off
as
Irish
if
they
do
not
contain
Irish
produce
.
if
this
be
achieve
,
consumer
would
be
fully
aware
of
what
they
be
buy
.
the
beef
industry
be
grow
but
must
cope
with
the
cost
of
feed
and
the
increase
in
grain
price
worldwide
.
be
it
within
the
minister
's
remit
to
reduce
the
cost
of
feedstuff
in
addition
to
implement
measure
to
ensure
the
competitiveness
of
the
Irish
beef
industry
?
the
cost
be
have
a
impact
on
the
market
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
a
fairly
comprehensive
response
.
with
regard
to
the
food
and
Veterinary
Office
report
,
one
Dane
,
one
Briton
,
one
Italian
and
one
Irish
do
not
make
a
ban
.
be
this
a
realistic
proposition
?
will
the
ban
take
place
?
no
matter
how
much
lobbying
one
do
,
a
minister
negotiate
at
the
Council
of
Minister
will
always
have
a
view
,
whether
on
or
off
the
record
,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
ban
will
be
enforce
.
the
minister
's
reply
seem
to
indicate
that
there
be
no
appetite
for
a
ban
.
Irish
beef
farmer
want
to
hear
if
the
ban
will
be
impose
.
since
the
enlargement
of
the
European
Union
,
we
influence
on
issue
such
as
this
have
wane
,
as
have
traditional
alliance
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
give
a
more
definitive
answer
.
do
she
think
a
ban
will
be
put
in
place
?

I
too
welcome
the
minister
,
the
Minister
of
State
and
departmental
official
to
today
's
meeting
.
I
share
some
of
the
concern
of
deputy
Creed
.
I
be
a
novice
in
this
process
.
it
would
have
be
very
beneficial
for
someone
like
I
to
have
have
a
pre-briefing
on
the
mechanism
,
without
necessarily
have
have
sight
of
the
figure
.
that
would
have
provide
some
assistance
in
understand
the
process
.
that
be
not
a
criticism
but
a
observation
.
I
have
a
number
of
issue
of
concern
from
a
global
perspective
regard
the
state
of
play
vis
-à
-
vis
global
agriculture
.
there
be
a
increase
in
food
price
.
there
be
issue
regard
food
safety
and
there
be
serious
issue
on
where
Irish
agribusiness
will
be
in
20
year
.
I
be
not
satisfied
,
notwithstand
the
increase
in
output
,
that
there
be
enough
of
a
political
imperative
with
regard
to
food
labelling
.
nothing
in
the
minister
's
statement
give
I
solace
in
that
regard
,
give
that
that
involve
in
Irish
agriculture
be
operate
at
the
high
standard
.
there
have
still
be
no
substantive
political
movement
towards
ensure
the
labelling
regime
.
ultimately
that
have
a
bear
on
agricultural
output
and
should
have
be
provide
for
in
today
's
statement
.
I
know
I
be
jump
from
a
very
general
point
to
a
very
specific
one
.
regard
installation
aid
to
bring
more
young
farmer
into
the
loop
,
the
fact
that
land
need
to
be
own
or
lease
for
a
maximum
of
ten
year
be
very
restrictive
and
should
be
consider
in
one
of
the
specific
programme
mention
by
the
minister
.
as
we
go
through
the
programme
,
this
issue
will
become
more
apparent
and
I
hope
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
address
specific
issue
in
that
regard
.
there
be
major
potential
for
Irish
agriculture
.
more
than
230000
people
be
employ
,
whether
through
agrifood
or
directly
in
production
.
it
represent
approximately
11
%
of
total
employment
in
the
State
.
it
be
a
vital
component
of
the
economy
.
while
I
be
glad
that
output
be
increase
,
I
would
like
to
see
more
forward
planning
or
long
-
term
strategic
thinking
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
address
some
of
that
issue
.
what
be
the
state
of
play
on
expenditure
on
TB
and
brucellosis
eradication
?
be
the
result
as
desire
by
the
minister
?
will
she
comment
on
the
effect
of
expenditure
to
promote
animal
welfare
in
general
?
if
we
be
talk
about
the
ultimate
output
for
agriculture
,
it
could
be
argue
that
that
will
be
affect
by
country
of
original
labelling
.
it
may
be
join
-
up
government
but
I
understand
the
initial
proposal
be
make
in
January
.
it
be
a
major
political
imperative
and
someone
need
to
grasp
the
nettle
,
so
to
speak
.
it
make
total
sense
.
on
subhead
H
,
I
refer
to
horticulture
,
organic
capital
expenditure
and
organic
current
expenditure
.
there
have
be
dramatic
increase
under
this
heading
and
I
assume
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
with
responsibility
for
food
and
horticulture
,
deputy
Trevor
Sargent
,
have
be
influential
in
this
regard
.
the
minister
should
explain
exactly
what
this
increase
relate
to
,
particularly
in
respect
of
organic
capital
expenditure
and
horticulture
.
while
everyone
welcome
increase
in
this
regard
,
I
seek
a
breakdown
in
term
of
the
expenditure
for
the
aforementioned
three
item
.
member
appreciate
the
target
and
I
do
not
believe
anyone
would
oppose
the
setting
of
a
target
in
the
first
instance
.
however
,
I
refer
to
the
current
climate
in
which
the
price
of
staple
for
ordinary
working
people
,
such
as
potato
and
bread
,
be
increase
year
on
year
as
food
inflation
increase
.
as
for
the
Department
's
thinking
,
will
a
point
be
reach
at
which
the
focus
of
spending
would
be
towards
ensure
the
staple
be
maintain
at
affordable
level
?
I
appreciate
the
minister
be
seek
to
strike
a
balance
—
—
I
appreciate
there
be
a
organic
market
and
a
local
food
economy
that
must
be
support
.
however
,
a
balance
also
must
be
strike
to
ensure
the
great
majority
of
the
population
can
have
staple
at
a
affordable
price
.
I
appreciate
that
.
the
Exchequer
's
contribution
to
forestry
in
2008
be
€
113
million
,
if
I
be
read
the
capital
output
figure
correctly
.
a
sum
of
€98
million
of
that
will
cover
the
afforestation
grant
.
there
be
a
provision
of
€
10
million
for
structural
initiative
and
€
5.6
million
for
bio-fuel
,
include
willow
and
miscanthus
,
and
the
bio
-
fuel
national
top
-
up
grant
,
as
well
as
biomass
.
be
there
scope
for
increase
the
provision
for
biomass
and
bio-fuel
to
encourage
great
growth
in
that
sector
?
give
the
Kyoto
target
and
the
scope
for
forestry
to
reduce
carbon
emission
,
should
we
be
do
more
in
term
of
marketing
initiative
to
get
more
people
into
the
forestry
sector
?
I
be
not
convinced
that
enough
be
be
do
in
that
regard
.
forestry
be
potentially
a
major
growth
industry
.
I
thank
the
minister
but
I
raise
a
point
on
—
—
I
do
not
want
to
go
through
it
now
.
I
can
talk
to
one
of
the
official
at
some
stage
.
I
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
the
minister
visit
the
committee
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
aquaculture
sector
.

I
welcome
the
minister
and
he
official
.
the
€
3.4
billion
spend
on
agriculture
be
sizeable
.
we
have
hammer
out
many
of
the
issue
on
milk
quota
,
the
farm
waste
management
scheme
and
other
scheme
in
this
committee
.
I
will
not
speak
specifically
to
that
matter
.
the
Teagasc
budget
have
be
on
my
mind
for
some
time
.
I
seek
information
on
the
research
component
of
Teagasc
's
operation
.
I
understand
€
182
million
be
allocate
for
that
purpose
.
be
a
value
for
money
mechanism
build
into
research
spend
?
what
be
the
return
on
investment
?
for
instance
,
when
there
be
a
call
for
a
proposal
which
be
fund
by
the
taxpayer
via
Teagasc
for
a
specific
scientific
proposal
,
what
be
the
success
rate
for
that
proposal
within
Teagasc
?
what
be
the
failure
rate
?
how
much
money
be
spend
on
research
?
how
be
that
target
?
be
there
a
economic
return
on
that
investment
down
the
line
?
what
have
be
the
return
to
the
Exchequer
on
Department
investment
in
co-operative
for
the
purpose
of
microbiological
research
,
particularly
into
derivative
of
milk
product
?
while
I
do
not
suggest
it
be
a
black
hole
and
that
the
money
be
ill
spend
,
I
would
like
to
understand
more
about
how
that
system
work
,
particularly
when
it
come
to
scientific
call
for
proposal
under
the
Teagasc
heading
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
elaborate
on
programme
5
because
it
be
state
that
the
cost
in
this
area
relate
entirely
to
the
administrative
budget
and
that
there
be
a
ongoing
review
of
operation
to
improve
efficiency
and
effectiveness
in
the
delivery
of
service
.
be
it
the
minister
's
view
that
the
staff
component
in
the
Department
be
currently
operate
at
capacity
throughout
the
State
?
should
there
be
few
staff
and
what
action
be
be
take
to
make
savings
in
this
regard
?
I
also
want
to
discuss
the
€200
million
in
increase
in
fishing
quota
in
2008
secure
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Killeen
.
I
may
have
miss
it
but
be
there
a
statement
on
the
fishery
output
for
2009
to
2010
,
as
a
result
of
that
increase
in
quota
?
I
be
try
to
get
a
idea
as
to
whether
fisherman
will
get
more
money
over
the
next
period
.
what
be
the
state
of
play
for
fishery
?
I
would
like
to
respond
to
the
last
point
the
minister
make
,
which
relate
to
the
need
to
secure
value
for
money
when
review
and
form
of
research
be
undertake
.
I
take
the
point
he
make
about
Moorepark
.
we
be
all
very
proud
of
Moorepark
.
the
minister
be
state
the
obvious
in
that
regard
.
I
say
that
with
respect
to
the
minister
's
position
.
how
much
money
be
the
taxpayer
spending
on
agricultural
research
?
what
be
the
rate
of
return
on
that
investment
?
it
might
not
be
possible
to
answer
that
question
today
.
the
scientific
community
can
respond
to
call
for
proposal
and
can
benefit
from
funding
stream
from
source
like
the
European
Union
,
private
equity
,
the
co-operative
movement
and
industry
.
how
much
money
do
the
Irish
taxpayer
spend
on
fund
that
research
?
what
be
the
return
on
that
investment
to
the
Irish
taxpayer
?
I
appreciate
that
the
minister
might
not
be
able
to
answer
that
specific
question
today
.
perhaps
he
can
provide
that
information
at
a
future
meeting
of
this
committee
.
he
may
be
able
to
arrange
for
I
to
get
a
briefing
on
the
matter
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
it
.
that
be
my
point
.
it
must
have
commercial
value
.

if
the
minister
have
a
white
beard
I
would
probably
call
he
Santa
Claus
because
of
the
timing
of
this
Supplementary
estimate
.
perhaps
I
be
a
little
cynical
about
the
timing
.
if
there
be
savings
already
in
the
Department
's
vote
when
be
that
savings
identify
and
could
this
money
have
be
discharge
early
?
the
experience
on
the
ground
be
such
that
farmer
be
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
and
if
this
funding
be
available
soon
and
could
have
be
discharge
soon
,
it
would
have
alleviate
much
of
the
hardship
.
I
be
cynical
about
the
fact
that
the
payment
be
be
process
on
3
December
.
the
manner
in
which
the
estimate
be
present
to
we
be
confusing
.
I
have
some
degree
of
intelligence
but
we
be
be
bamboozl
with
a
set
of
figure
which
be
difficult
to
wide
through
and
analyse
exactly
what
be
at
play
.
in
he
press
release
the
minister
say
:
this
be
not
additional
exchequer
money
,
but
discharge
liability
early
than
previously
plan
and
be
possible
because
of
savings
arise
on
the
Department
's
vote
and
the
use
of
EU
receipt
and
will
improve
the
cashflow
situation
of
farmer
due
to
reps
payment
and
fwm
grant
early
next
year
.
when
be
this
identify
?
be
it
only
identify
in
the
last
few
day
?
if
it
have
be
identify
early
I
would
like
to
know
exactly
when
because
it
could
have
alleviate
much
hardship
.
I
will
not
repeat
the
question
pose
by
deputy
Creed
?
however
,
I
do
have
a
specific
question
in
regard
to
the
humanitarian
aid
scheme
.
I
be
concerned
as
to
how
it
will
filter
down
to
farmer
who
be
experience
hardship
.
I
look
at
the
criterion
for
the
scheme
and
I
find
they
be
suitably
vague
.
have
any
liaising
take
place
between
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
will
a
set
of
strict
criterion
be
outline
for
individual
farmer
in
order
that
there
be
no
confusion
as
to
they
entitlement
.
if
a
farmer
in
dire
financial
strait
be
eligible
under
the
term
of
the
scheme
and
present
to
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
,
I
be
concerned
that
no
bureaucratic
barrier
would
be
put
in
place
.
I
want
to
ensure
the
scheme
be
simplify
in
such
a
way
that
people
can
avail
of
it
.
the
minister
have
say
the
amount
available
be
€
10
million
and
I
understand
there
be
a
additional
€
2
million
.
I
would
like
to
know
a
little
more
about
how
the
minister
propose
to
administer
the
scheme
.
I
apologise
for
cut
across
the
minister
.
the
humanitarian
aid
scheme
be
important
.
I
know
it
be
administer
by
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
.
a
person
who
would
normally
present
to
a
community
welfare
officer
would
be
someone
who
would
not
have
mean
.
if
farmer
have
to
present
,
they
would
be
deem
ordinarily
to
have
means
and
therefore
the
criterion
by
which
they
will
be
judge
by
the
CWO
will
be
much
different
than
,
for
example
,
a
normal
person
who
would
apply
.
that
be
why
there
must
be
some
liaison
between
the
Department
to
ensure
that
where
farmer
present
to
a
community
welfare
officer
there
be
clear
guideline
which
do
not
make
it
a
stringent
affair
or
that
the
rule
be
not
overly
bureaucratic
for
the
person
who
appear
.
that
be
really
my
point
.
can
we
get
a
note
as
to
where
this
savings
have
be
achieve
?

it
be
amazing
how
a
consideration
of
a
combine
budget
from
the
European
Union
and
from
we
own
resource
of
€
3
billion
can
come
down
to
a
debate
about
Mallow
.
I
be
initially
of
the
view
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
move
the
office
from
Mallow
to
Fermoy
,
there
be
only
a
few
mile
in
the
distance
.
however
,
there
be
issue
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
will
cause
difficulty
for
farmer
who
use
the
service
in
term
of
how
far
they
will
have
to
travel
if
the
office
move
to
Fermoy
.
there
be
no
question
that
it
be
a
source
of
concern
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
so
one
might
argue
that
I
be
bound
to
say
that
.
I
be
initially
in
favour
of
the
Fermoy
proposal
but
I
ask
that
the
minister
consider
the
difficulty
it
will
pose
for
service
user
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
will
present
difficulty
for
some
.
through
the
chair
,
the
minister
be
describe
a
scenario
whereby
the
capacity
within
Cork
city
will
be
reduce
.
while
the
Department
will
be
move
out
of
Cork
city
,
it
will
build
capacity
wherever
it
move
to
and
its
overall
capacity
will
not
be
reduce
.
absolutely
.
a
lot
of
office
space
in
Mallow
already
have
be
build
and
be
in
turnkey
condition
.
it
also
would
facilitate
that
process
.
Subhead
b
provide
for
research
and
training
and
I
refer
to
Teagasc
.
read
the
minister
's
overall
statement
,
one
get
the
sense
there
be
a
focus
on
Bord
Bia
and
I
note
the
Department
's
provision
for
a
investment
in
graduate
training
there
.
while
I
acknowledge
this
be
provide
for
in
a
late
subhead
,
I
be
try
to
discern
the
overall
picture
.
be
I
sit
in
the
Minister
's
seat
,
the
question
would
be
what
would
I
do
.
one
thing
I
would
strive
towards
would
be
to
ensure
that
the
research
and
training
budget
,
particularly
that
of
Teagasc
,
would
be
maintain
.
I
would
fight
any
proposal
,
such
as
that
contain
in
the
McCarthy
report
,
to
consolidate
the
overall
national
science
budget
,
whereby
proposal
would
be
draw
from
a
single
pool
.
I
believe
that
Teagasc
have
major
potential
to
bring
up
by
a
peg
or
two
the
8
%
of
employment
in
this
sector
because
of
the
work
it
do
and
because
of
the
potential
that
lie
within
its
organisation
.
food
-
base
research
be
where
Ireland
will
deliver
in
respect
of
export
market
.
while
I
acknowledge
there
have
be
a
increase
in
the
allocation
of
resource
in
this
regard
,
I
would
argue
that
broadly
speak
,
it
should
be
fight
for
tooth
and
nail
at
cabinet
level
to
ensure
that
Teagasc
be
not
compromise
in
any
way
.
I
understand
that
a
examination
of
the
scientific
community
in
its
entirety
could
lead
one
to
conclude
there
be
a
argument
that
duplication
of
effort
may
be
take
place
.
however
,
Teagasc
's
capacity
should
not
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
it
have
the
capability
to
deliver
add
value
to
this
economy
.
I
make
this
remark
as
a
broad
statement
.
what
be
this
reduce
from
and
to
what
amount
?
if
the
minister
reduce
it
,
he
know
the
figure
.
can
the
minister
break
that
down
into
a
hourly
rate
?
with
regard
to
the
agri-environment
option
scheme
,
if
I
may
respectfully
say
so
,
the
minister
put
a
little
spin
on
it
when
he
state
that
he
be
pleased
to
report
to
the
committee
that
more
than
8,000
application
have
be
receive
for
this
new
scheme
.
it
be
well
under
-
subscribe
.
if
it
be
see
as
a
partial
replacement
for
reps
then
—
and
I
state
this
without
any
political
charge
—
it
have
not
work
.
I
wonder
whether
the
minister
need
to
go
back
to
the
draw
board
on
this
.
the
minister
should
consider
whether
it
be
so
vastly
under
-
subscribe
and
a
tranche
of
money
be
leave
sit
there
for
want
of
a
good
or
modify
scheme
.
it
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
my
humble
opinion
.
initially
I
think
it
be
a
very
good
scheme
but
the
feedback
I
get
be
that
it
be
really
design
only
for
people
who
want
to
tip
away
at
a
little
hobby
farming
here
and
there
.
the
person
dependent
on
farming
to
put
bread
on
the
table
have
no
interest
whatsoever
in
get
involved
in
this
scheme
because
give
the
amount
of
input
and
effort
that
must
be
make
,
the
return
be
negligible
.
there
be
a
issue
of
scale
in
some
aspect
where
the
amount
of
effort
be
not
worth
the
time
for
what
one
get
in
return
.
will
the
minister
consider
return
to
it
and
modify
it
in
some
way
?
it
speak
volume
that
only
8,000
application
be
make
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
that
be
one
analysis
,
but
what
be
the
analysis
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
I
take
the
point
the
minister
have
make
on
the
fact
that
8,000
have
subscribe
.
what
do
he
envisage
will
be
the
average
payment
for
each
of
that
8,000
farmer
?
do
he
think
it
will
be
the
maximum
amount
?
will
it
be
a
fraction
of
that
?
with
all
due
respect
,
and
I
apologise
for
cut
across
the
minister
,
then
the
Irish
Farmers
's
Journal
analysis
be
a
theoretical
analysis
.
until
we
see
the
figure
from
the
Minister
and
Department
we
do
not
know
how
successful
this
will
be
.
to
support
deputy
Aylward
's
comment
,
if
we
be
try
to
encourage
a
young
generation
into
farming
,
great
flexibility
in
respect
of
late
application
to
the
early
retirement
scheme
would
be
beneficial
.
it
would
create
incentive
for
people
to
become
involved
.

.
I
welcome
the
official
.
what
be
the
relationship
between
Coillte
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
decide
on
the
payment
of
a
grant
of
€
45
per
linear
metre
?
be
it
possible
to
determine
how
much
Coillte
have
benefit
?
do
the
forest
road
scheme
have
regard
to
thinning
?
I
note
the
definition
of
"
thinning
"
include
in
the
introductory
statement
.
there
be
a
reference
to
outcome
.
I
can
only
surmise
that
the
outcome
have
be
negative
in
term
of
thinning
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
however
,
I
may
be
wrong
and
may
be
hit
the
wrong
angle
and
,
if
so
,
I
stand
to
be
correct
.
what
we
have
in
the
south
,
particularly
in
my
constituency
,
be
hgv
traffic
operate
on
Coillte
land
.
while
access
to
the
forest
at
certain
point
be
extremely
good
,
certain
road
be
substandard
as
a
result
of
the
excessive
volume
of
hgv
traffic
.
hgv
should
not
go
near
this
road
,
but
they
be
be
use
as
rat-run
to
gain
access
to
the
forestry
.
do
the
Department
have
a
role
in
this
regard
or
be
it
a
matter
for
the
local
authority
?
if
it
be
a
matter
for
the
local
authority
,
I
hope
this
will
be
take
into
account
when
allocation
be
be
make
under
the
scheme
.
in
Ballyhoura
in
north
Cork
certain
road
be
in
a
atrocious
state
,
but
beyond
a
certain
point
,
the
standard
of
the
surface
be
good
than
on
the
Cork
to
Dublin
road
.
there
be
a
inconsistency
I
would
like
the
issue
to
be
address
.
forgive
I
because
my
early
question
may
have
be
long
-
winded
and
could
have
be
misunderste
.
some
80
%
of
the
eligible
cost
be
subject
to
€
45
per
linear
metre
,
and
with
a
budget
of
€
18
million
,
by
how
much
do
Coillte
benefit
from
that
?
how
much
will
Coillte
earn
potentially
?
be
Ms
Nolan
say
that
be
far
as
it
can
go
?
I
could
table
a
parliamentary
question
,
but
could
I
have
a
breakdown
of
by
how
much
Coillte
have
benefit
from
this
scheme
,
include
the
geographical
location
involve
?
I
would
also
like
to
know
the
geographical
location
where
private
entity
have
benefit
from
this
scheme
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
the
scheme
.
forgive
I
if
we
be
not
totally
au
fait
with
the
working
of
the
scheme
;
maybe
we
should
be
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
facetious
,
but
forestry
road
scheme
be
not
on
top
of
the
list
.
now
that
the
official
be
here
,
however
,
I
would
like
to
get
the
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
of
where
the
money
be
go
.
yes
.
that
be
a
good
question
.
on
behalf
of
the
select
committee
,
I
thank
Ms
Nolan
,

Moore

Mr.
Conway

I
like
the
original
wording
on
line
29
,
which
state
,
"
two
person
who
be
married
to
each
other
"
.
perhaps
the
minister
will
clarify
the
reason
for
this
change
as
the
section
as
draft
seem
reasonable
and
in
keep
with
the
idea
of
simplify
the
language
around
legislation
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
forgive
my
ignorance
on
this
one
if
I
have
miss
something
in
the
discourse
or
in
the
minister
's
second
stage
speech
but
who
do
the
minister
anticipate
will
be
the
body
to
administer
the
scheme
?
okay
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
that
.
I
wish
to
give
notice
that
I
may
submit
a
amendment
to
this
section
on
report
stage
.
on
the
wide
section
,
I
wish
to
give
notice
that
I
may
submit
a
amendment
on
report
stage
.
before
the
minister
respond
,
I
would
like
to
ask
whether
this
provision
would
have
cost
implication
for
the
administration
of
the
scheme
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
and
the
chair
.
the
vote
have
be
call
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
will
come
in
after
deputy
Rabbitte
.
I
be
just
go
to
suggest
that
if
the
minister
could
revert
to
we
with
she
own
amendment
or
additional
wording
regard
the
schedule
in
term
of
the
income
element
,
it
might
be
helpful
to
we
.
I
,
too
,
reserve
the
right
to
introduce
a
amendment
on
report
stage
on
this
issue
.
I
have
a
question
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
out
of
order
.
the
chairman
or
clerk
can
correct
I
.
it
strike
I
that
in
article
13
(
3
)
state
"
in
make
the
regulation
under
subsection
(
2
)
,
the
minister
shall
have
regard
to
the
availability
of
resource
.
"
it
say
"
shall
have
regard
to
availability
"
,
so
it
will
not
be
a
demand
-
lead
scheme
at
all
,
will
it
?
it
will
not
be
a
demand
-
lead
scheme
.
in
other
word
,
the
budget
will
be
available
to
meet
the
demand
.
we
be
propose
to
accept
this
but
with
the
proviso
that
we
may
revisit
the
amendment
on
report
stage
.
it
be
on
the
record
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
support
the
amendment
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
second
stage
speech
where
she
say
that
the
legislation
be
design
to
"
improve
outcome
for
child
by
provide
access
to
quality
,
affordable
child
care
...
help
parent
transition
from
welfare
to
employment
,
"
as
well
as
support
lifelong
learning
,
advance
gender
equality
and
so
on
.
I
support
the
amendment
.
we
might
seek
to
get
a
assessment
from
the
minister
as
to
how
she
herself
plan
to
kick
the
tyre
of
the
scheme
,
one
might
say
,
use
quantitative
and
qualitative
method
to
ensure
the
legislation
be
work
.
I
be
not
sure
but
I
suggest
that
six
month
might
be
too
short
a
timeframe
,
although
I
have
a
open
mind
on
that
.
will
the
minister
give
we
a
idea
how
she
plan
to
kick
the
tyre
on
she
own
legislation
?
yes
.
I
support
deputy
Rabbitte
.
I
be
aware
of
one
facility
in
my
constituency
where
child
be
admit
to
the
after
-
school
care
programme
when
they
be
only
a
few
month
old
and
right
up
to
the
age
of
nine
.
the
deputy
want
to
ensure
that
such
care
be
continue
and
that
any
transition
be
as
seamless
as
possible
,
which
I
support
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
idea
,
knowledge
or
wisdom
on
the
matter
.
it
would
very
useful
to
make
the
transition
less
onerous
for
the
people
concerned
.
the
minister
will
forgive
I
if
I
do
not
fully
understand
what
she
have
say
.
in
term
of
section
14
(
1
)
and
schedule
2
,
the
agreement
will
be
make
with
each
of
the
follow
entity
:
the
local
authority
;
the
HSE
;
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
,
CFA
;
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
;
and
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
.
the
Minister
for
Children
and
Youth
affair
have
say
that
the
flexibility
which
need
to
be
add
to
the
scheme
will
be
negotiate
with
the
list
entity
.
have
I
interpret
what
she
say
correctly
?
I
may
go
a
bit
off
message
now
but
I
be
sure
that
the
chairman
will
let
I
know
if
I
go
too
far

I
have
some
general
,
broad
-
stroke
question
.
be
now
a
appropriate
time
to
ask
they
?
I
have
to
ask
some
hard
question
.
do
I
have
the
floor
,
Chairman
?
I
be
happy
to
yield
to
deputy
Rabbitte
if
she
have
a
question
.
I
have
it
.
not
on
that
issue
.
I
have
a
number
of
question
.
there
be
a
couple
of
key
policy
issue
.
I
want
to
comment
on
how
that
policy
output
map
across
the
appropriation
.
my
first
question
relate
to
the
affordable
child
care
scheme
.
we
know
there
be
significant
staff
turnover
in
child
care
facility
;
some
estimate
put
the
figure
at
as
high
as
30
%
.
how
do
we
address
this
high
rate
of
turnover
?
the
overhead
and
administrative
burden
in
individual
facility
be
increase
.
can
anything
be
do
about
that
?
do
the
minister
have
a
perspective
on
how
we
can
address
the
high
rate
of
turnover
,
give
the
high
level
of
qualification
within
the
sector
?
be
there
a
mechanism
to
build
in
possible
budget
for
individual
facility
to
account
for
the
increase
overhead
as
a
result
of
administrative
cost
?
could
the
minister
allow
for
some
provision
to
be
make
for
continuous
professional
development
?
it
be
a
key
factor
in
any
career
.
I
understand
some
segment
within
the
sector
be
ask
for
up
to
five
day
for
some
provision
to
be
make
for
that
.
I
ask
for
a
perspective
from
the
minister
on
where
the
policy
be
go
in
respect
of
all
of
this
challenge
.
another
issue
be
communication
.
there
have
be
some
controversy
-
if
I
can
use
that
term
-
about
the
SCU
.
it
be
report
by
Hugh
O'Connell
in
the
Sunday
Business
Post
that
on
July
9
the
Taoiseach
,
deputy
Varadkar
,
respond
to
a
memo
state
that
the
child
care
subsidy
scheme
be
announce
by
the
government
late
in
the
summer
should
be
a
key
campaign
run
by
the
SCU
.
he
be
quote
as
say
,
"
again
,
should
be
a
thing
the
govt
be
do
for
you
,
not
the
Dept
of
Children
&
Youth
...
I
think
there
should
be
a
campaign
run
on
this
throughout
August
.
"
I
note
the
minister
have
make
some
comment
in
the
public
domain
about
possible
interaction
with
the
Taoiseach
on
this
.
I
want
to
glean
from
the
minister
who
be
in
control
of
the
Department
's
communication
.
be
it
now
a
function
of
the
SCU
?
will
it
become
a
function
of
the
SCU
if
it
be
not
currently
such
a
function
or
be
the
minister
in
control
of
she
budget
line
which
,
as
I
understand
it
,
total
approximately
€
113000
if
the
foi
figure
be
to
be
believe
?
I
can
not
see
the
specific
figure
in
the
estimate
.
perhaps
the
minister
might
assist
we
with
that
.
I
would
make
the
case
that
the
minister
and
she
Department
should
be
in
control
of
the
communication
strategy
.
if
the
interaction
between
the
sector
and
all
of
its
constituent
part
be
close
to
the
minister
in
term
of
relationship
I
do
not
see
the
need
for
that
to
be
elevate
to
the
Department
of
the
Taoiseach
which
be
at
another
remove
.
there
be
a
political
issue
in
term
of
control
and
it
be
more
of
a
political
question
for
the
minister
.
I
refer
to
the
allocation
for
Tusla
.
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
she
have
secure
some
€
754
million
for
Tusla
,
a
increase
of
€
40
million
.
in
my
mind
I
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
increase
in
the
budget
for
Tusla
and
the
number
of
HIQA
report
come
into
the
public
domain
across
a
wide
range
of
issue
.
I
be
try
to
glean
whether
the
HIQA
report
be
be
act
upon
on
a
regional
basis
and
when
we
can
expect
success
in
respect
of
the
recommendation
in
each
of
the
HIQA
report
.
I
tab
a
parliamentary
question
seek
information
on
the
number
of
social
worker
in
the
system
.
the
response
I
get
be
that
there
be
a
average
of
ten
year
duration
in
career
length
.
it
be
a
tough
job
and
I
can
understand
that
there
be
a
high
rate
of
attrition
in
the
sector
for
all
sort
of
reason
.
be
there
something
in
the
minister
's
vision
which
will
speak
to
the
budget
line
before
we
and
address
the
decline
in
number
over
a
long
-
term
period
?
be
the
minister
liais
with
other
Department
to
see
how
we
can
encourage
more
people
to
become
social
worker
and
social
care
worker
?
they
be
key
personnel
and
act
as
a
interface
between
the
challenge
the
sector
face
and
output
.
how
do
the
individual
provider
bid
for
the
€
18
million
to
help
with
the
administrative
burden
?
the
minister
have
push
back
on
that
issue
.
I
also
ask
about
the
high
turnover
of
staff
,
especially
social
worker
.
three
month
be
a
quarter
of
a
year
in
effect
.
I
would
like
further
clarification
of
the
figure
of
45
,
57
,
nine
and
53
.
I
think
the
minister
mention
45
social
worker
,
57
-----
with
regard
to
the
figure
of
nine
,
I
do
not
quite
pick
up
the-----
that
be
the
key
one
I
want
to
zone
in
on
.
with
regard
to
the
nine
nursing
staff
,
the
minister
may
be
aware
of
Barnardos
's
"
lose
"
campaign
,
which
be
quite
a
impactful
campaign
.
one
of
its
ask
arise
from
that
be
that
there
would
be
a
dedicated
child
and
family
public
health
system
with
guarantee
home
visit
.
I
know
that
technically
this
be
not
the
minister
's
area
but
I
ask
for
some
engagement
between
the
Department
and
the
Department
of
Health
on
this
issue
.
yes
,
because
we
all
know
the
value
of
public
health
nurse
,
we
know
exactly
what
they
do
and
we
know
they
be
extremely
good
at
pick
up
sign
within
a
family
home
.
if
there
be
a
facility
whereby
there
be
more
home
visit
,
it
would
have
a
very
strong
longitudinal
effect
because
we
know
that
sometimes
home
visit
stop
after
a
certain
period
of
time
once
a
child
be
bear
.
starting
off
at
home
,
Barnardos
ask
what
can
do
to
ensure
all
child
have
a
good
start
and
suggest
introduce
a
dedicated
child
and
family
public
nurse
system
with
guarantee
home
visit
.
I
do
not
give
the
minister
notice
of
my
intention
to
ask
this
question
but
I
would
like
to
hear
she
perspective
,
whether
she
feel
that
this
be
something
that
be
worth
pursue
and
whether
she
might
engage
with
the
Department
of
Health
or
the
Minister
for
Health
with
a
view
to
see
whether
work
could
be
carry
out
between
the
two
Department
on
this
issue
.
will
the
minister
report
back
to
we
on
the
progress
on
that
?
I
thank
the
minister
and
she
official
for
attend

I
thank
everybody
for
they
attendance
.
I
hope
the
chairman
will
forgive
I
if
my
question
do
not
relate
directly
to
the
subhead
.
the
additional
increase
of
4
%
,
give
a
total
net
increase
of
8
%
,
be
welcome
.
my
question
relate
to
the
sanctioning
by
Tusla
of
privately
provide
service
for
family
such
as
occupational
or
speech
and
language
therapy
.
my
understanding
be
Tusla
have
put
in
place
a
new
central
procurement
process
for
the
provision
of
this
service
and
that
it
be
manage
in
Dublin
.
will
the
minister
clarify
whether
the
timeline
in
the
provision
of
this
service
and
be
pay
for
they
be
short
?
I
have
hear
of
one
case
and
I
be
try
to
determine
whether
it
be
systematic
where
service
have
be
provide
for
a
family
but
Tusla
be
return
to
court
to
seek
a
determination
on
whether
the
service
should
continue
.
not
only
be
there
legal
cost
involve
,
there
be
also
a
delay
in
make
payment
for
the
supply
of
service
such
as
occupational
and
speech
and
language
therapy
.
there
be
the
issue
of
whether
the
tendering
and
procurement
process
have
become
overly
centralise
,
lead
to
people
and
family
live
in
the
region
-
I
refer
to
Cork
in
this
instance
-
be
affect
by
a
new
structure
that
have
result
in
service
not
be
provide
for
child
.
on
the
subhead
,
the
issue
concern
the
cost
of
procurement
and
the
provision
of
service
,
the
delay
in
pay
the
service
provider
and
the
fact
that
Tusla
be
seek
a
court
direction
on
a
case
by
case
basis
on
the
continuity
of
service
such
as
occupational
and
speech
and
language
therapy
.
be
the
case
to
which
I
refer
systematic
?
what
be
the
consequence
for
service
provision
for
individual
child
?
I
seek
a
insight
from
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
legal
cost
that
accrue
to
Tusla
for
family
service
and
the
family
support
programme
,
whether
service
be
be
provide
in
a
timely
fashion
,
whether
payment
to
that
provide
the
service
be
process
efficiently
,
whether
the
add
legal
layer
be
eat
into
the
Department
's
overall
budget
and
the
necessity
of
seek
court
direction
in
certain
case
as
that
aspect
be
confusing
to
I
.
I
seek
a
insight
from
the
minister
and
a
understanding
of
the
process
.
I
must
be
very
careful
about
the
language
I
use
.
if
I
refer
to
seek
court
direction
,
whether
one
interpret
that
as
challenging
------
I
be
refer
to
a
court
determine
the
continuity
of
that
service
.
a
child
may
have
access
to
certain
service
but
Tusla
may
intervene
and
decide
to
seek
a
direction
from
a
court
in
that
regard
.
such
court
hearing
would
involve
solicitor
's
fee
have
to
be
pay
by
both
side
.
I
be
seek
to
determine
whether
Tusla
be
go
to
court
on
a
case
-
by
-
case
basis
to
determine
the
continuity
of
service
such
as
the
occupational
therapy
and
speech
and
language
therapy
intervention
I
mention
.
if
it
be
,
that
pose
a
massive
question
.
I
be
give
voice
to
a
family
of
which
I
be
aware
.
I
seek
clarity
as
to
whether
that
be
happen
in
the
case
of
one
family
or
on
a
systematic
basis
.
I
realise
the
minister
may
not
be
able
to
provide
the
answer
today
but
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
clarify
.
why
would
-----
I
be
raise
a
potential
delaying
tactic
in
the
provision
of
a
service
for
a
child
.
I
be
try
to
couch
my
language
but
perhaps
I
ought
to
be
more
direct
.
I
be
try
to
give
the
minister
every
opportunity
to
clarify
the
situation
.
allow
I
to
be
blunt
.
if
a
service
be
sanction
for
a
child
but
the
professional
with
the
requisite
skill
to
provide
the
service
be
not
pay
for
that
in
a
timely
manner
because
he
or
she
be
a
private
provider
,
that
be
a
serious
issue
for
the
service
in
general
.
if
Tusla
be
now
seek
court
direction
,
I
question
the
efficacy
of
its
do
so
in
respect
of
intervention
for
individual
family
because
that
place
a
massive
onus
on
the
taxpayer
in
term
of
the
legal
cost
inherent
in
that
process
.
it
be
particularly
questionable
if
it
have
already
be
determine
from
professional
advice
that
the
child
should
benefit
from
very
specific
service
.
there
be
something
wrong
here
and
we
need
to
lift
the
lid
on
it
and
get
more
transparency
.
the
other
issue
I
raise
regard
the
reason
for
Tusla
centralise
all
procurement
service
.
yes
.
why
be
there
no
local
agency
to
fulfil
that
need
with
the
requisite
professional
who
be
well
able
to
provide
the
service
?
I
also
raise
the
issue
of
cost
.
that
be
the
reason
for
this
meeting
.
why
would
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
seek
to
go
to
court
to
determine
the
continuity
of
a
service
?
on
the
law
of
average
,
if
that
be
be
do
in
the
case
of
one
child
,
it
be
happen
systematically
.
I
be
ask
whether
it
be
happen
systematically
.
I
be
try
to
shed
some
light
on
that
.
I
appreciate
that
.
my
question
be
simple
:
be
Tusla
centralise
procurement
service
for
the
provision
of
occupational
therapy
and
speech
and
language
therapy
?
must
speech
and
language
therapist
now
tender
to
provide
service
?
the
provision
of
the
child
and
adolescent
mental
health
service
,
CAMHS
,
be
a
in
-
house
service
------
to
be
clear
,
CAMHS
be
a
in
-
house
service
with
professional
staff
.
from
time
to
time
or
systematically
-
again
,
that
must
be
clarify
-
it
will
procure
service
,
but
the
procurement
process
seem
to
be
centralise
in
Dublin
.
I
seek
enlightenment
from
the
minister
as
to
what
be
the
process
.
if
it
impact
on
the
delivery
of
service
to
the
child
,
we
need
close
scrutiny
of
that
and
what
exactly
be
the
service
.
if
the
minister
do
not
have
time
to
come
back
to
I
today
on
that
,
I
be
happy
to
engage
with
she
or
she
official
at
some
future
date
.
I
think
I
be
clear
about
that
.
it
come
back
to
cost
.
if
one
be
talk
about
a
cost
reduction
or
a
cost
efficiency
in
the
provision
of
service
and
if
one
be
tender
for
the
provision
of
service
in
Cork
through
a
process
carry
out
in
Dublin
,
I
be
modest
enough
to
say
that
I
do
not
understand
the
process
.
I
be
not
afraid
to
ask
a
seemingly
stupid
question
.
it
be
unclear
to
I
whether
there
be
a
centralised
tendering
process
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
do
that
have
a
impact
on
the
provision
of
service
?
do
every
single
provider
that
be
not
a
statutory
provider
like
CAMHS
,
for
instance
,
have
to
tender
for
the
service
it
provide
?
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
response
on
bring
Tusla
before
the
committee
,
but
I
be
ask
the
Department
and
the
minister
-----
the
minister
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
be
I
wrong
?
be
I
misinterpret
the
system
?
the
minister
will
tell
I
if
I
be
.
the
minister
need
to
be
clear
with
we
on
whether
this
happen
or
not
.
the
question
be
come
from
a
genuine
place
.
I
raise
it
because
of
issue
with
service
that
I
encounter
on
the
ground
.
that
be
why
I
be
ask
.
I
be
couch
my
language
.
I
know
I
be
repeat
myself
.
I
do
not
understand
the
process
,
and
if
somebody
could
tell
I
definitively
whether
there
be
local
autonomy
on
the
provision
of
service
like
occupational
therapy
and
speech
and
language
therapy
or
whether
people
have
to
go
through
procurement
-----
I
have
not
have
a
sufficient
answer
to
that
question
.

I
seek
advice
on
the
issue
.
amendment
in
my
name
and
that
of
Deputy
Rabbitte
and
Funchion
have
be
rule
out
of
order
.
they
be
tab
in
good
faith
.
to
my
mind
we
have
not
receive
a
comprehensive
justification
as
to
why
they
have
be
rule
out
of
order
.
I
seek
permission
to
hear
from
the
minister
as
to
that
justification
.
I
understand
from
the
minister
's
second
stage
speech
that
the
Bill
contain
a
presumption
in
favour
of
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
.
if
so
,
I
do
not
see
how
from
a
resource
point
of
view
of
put
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
we
amendment
run
contrary
to
that
.
what
we
be
seek
to
do
through
we
amendment
be
buttress
the
exist
system
.
I
beg
the
Chairman
's
indulgence
before
the
minister
reply
.
the
other
issue
I
have
be
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislation
under
article
42a.4.1o
,
which
read
:
(
i
)
bring
by
the
State
,
as
guardian
of
the
common
good
,
for
the
purpose
of
prevent
the
safety
and
welfare
of
any
child
from
be
prejudicially
affect
,
or
(
ii
)
concern
the
adoption
,
guardianship
or
custody
of
,
or
access
to
,
any
child
,
the
good
interest
of
the
child
shall
be
the
paramount
consideration
.
I
know
that
the
minister
be
act
in
good
faith
in
respect
of
this
provision
,
but
we
fear
be
that
the
postcode
lottery
will
be
a
issue
.
for
instance
,
it
be
not
always
the
case
that
a
guardian
ad
litem
may
be
appoint
.
it
depend
on
the
judge
and
where
he
or
she
sit
.
it
be
at
the
judge
's
discretion
.
this
be
a
issue
that
have
be
-----
it
be
important
.
this
issue
have
be
highlight
by
the
Child
Care
Law
Reporting
Project
.
in
some
area
of
the
country
,
guardian
be
only
appoint
in
a
small
number
of
case
.
the
justification
for
we
amendment
have
to
do
with
the
prediction
that
the
current
iteration
of
the
Bill
will
have
no
significant
impact
on
that
phenomenon
.
that
be
we
worry
.
I
wish
to
declare
at
this
stage
that
,
if
we
do
not
resolve
the
issue
today
,
I
will
seek
to
have
it
address
on
report
stage
.
I
want
to
put
down
that
marker
.
I
be
seek
for
the
minister
to
speak
to
the
issue
,
but
I
be
also
-----

I

the

not

we

this
be
not
a

I
merely
wish
to
ask
why
we
be
be
tell
that
we
amendment
be
out
of

and
that
there
be
advice
to
that
effect
but
we
have
not
physically

I
have
not

the

the

say
he
would
make
available
to

quite
frankly
,
we
need
that
advice

I
do

the

in

people

I

regard

in
one
case

a
solicitor
of
long
standing
who

in
Cork
,
Mr.
Colm
Roberts
,
be
on
the
public
record
as
part
of
process
of
interrogate
and
examine
the
role
of
guardian
ad
litem
.
he
state
in
a
recent
presentation
:
in
2009
I
raise
my
concern
in
another
child
care
case
before
the
District
Court
in
Cork
as
I
believe
that
as
a
legal
advisor
for
parent
,
I
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
case
where
the
extent
and
role
of
the
Gal
be
unclear
,
and
particularly
the
extent
and
role
of
he
/
she
legal
representation
be
even
more
unsettling
as
it
seem
to
move
the
Gal
into
a
more
adversarial
role
.
this
particularly
become
more
acute
in
circumstance
where
the
Gal
be
support
the
application
for
care
order
by
the
Child
&
Family
Agency
(
previously
HSE
)
.
this
be
very
problematic
for
the
court
to
balance
the
right
of
the
gal
to
fully
participate
in
proceedings
that
he
/
she
have
be
appoint
in
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
natural
justice
and
fairness
to
all
party
be
protect
and
vindicate
.
this
issue
be
deal
with
in
detail
[
in
]
a
judgment
by
District
judge
Mitchell
.
in
put
forward
the
amendment
to
delete
,
we
want
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
presumption
in
favour
of
the
appointment
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
and
the
discretion
of
the
District
Court
in
the
absence
of
a
fully
fledge
family
court
infrastructure
,
while
seek
to
give
a
voice
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
,
which
be
the
voice
of
the
child
before
the
court
.
I
do
not
see
what
be
so
injurious
about
we
intention
to
delete
this
line
.
I
be
not
a
lawyer
and
I
have
never
be
a
witness
before
a
court
,
in
particular
proceedings
before
the
family
court
,
so
I
be
a
layman
in
this
respect
.
we
be
seek
to
ensure
that
voice
be
absolutely
robust
in
the
absence
of
there
be
a
fully
fledge
family
court
infrastructure
.
again
,
this
go
back
to
the
geographical
disparity
that
exist
between
certain
party
where
,
without
be
disrespectful
to
District
Court
judge
,
not
every
District
Court
judge
have
the
training
in
respect
of
this
type
of
case
that
come
before
they
.
be
there
a
formula
of
word
that
would
copperfasten
the
importance
of
the
role
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
without
necessarily
call
for
they
not
to
be
a
party
?
the
minister
would
say
that
be
in
other
section
and
be
already
inherent
within
the
legislation
.
we
be
effectively
try
a
belt
and
brace
approach
but
I
have
a
open
mind
about
how
the
minister
might
respond
to
that
.
I
have
sympathy
for
Mr.
Roberts
if
he
represent
a
parent
.
I
mention
Mr.
Roberts
in
particular
because
he
be
on
the
public
record
have
make
submission
to
this
process
and
Bill
but
he
could
be
any
solicitor
around
the
country
.
this
be
a
adversarial
system
.
I
have
sympathy
for
the
minister
when
she
state
that
the
guardian
ad
litem
be
not
automatically
a
party
to
proceedings
.
however
,
we
be
try
to
strike
a
balance
and
recognise
the
fact
that
the
system
operate
differently
in
different
part
of
the
country
.
deputy
Rabbitte
mention
a
child
with
intellectual
disability
or
a
child
with
no
voice
and
there
be
any
number
of
type
of
case
to
which
we
can
refer
but
in
certain
part
of
this
country
,
there
be
no
automatic
entitlement
,
right
or
prospect
of
a
child
have
a
guardian
ad
litem
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
be
the
case
?
I
want
to
confer
with
my
colleague
for
a
moment
,
if
I
may
.
it
be
like
be
on
a
quiz
show
.
subject
to
the
agreement
of
my
colleague
,
that
seem
to
be
a
reasonable
proposal

I

it
will
be
clear
to
the
minister
that
we
be
also
engage
with
the
relevant
stakeholder
in
respect
of
this
amendment
.
we

we

we

discussion
with
the
various
stakeholder
with
whom
we
have
be
engage

in
support
of
that
,
the
reasoning
for
we
amendment
be
that
guardian
could
and
would
have
the
time
to
engage
with
child
in
a
way
that
social
worker
would
not
.
we
have
borne
witness
to
the
infrastructure
that
exist
in
this
country

the
shortage
of
social
worker
,
the
constraint
and
so
on

where
there
be
court
proceedings
,
the
guardian

would
fulfil
a
specific
role

I
do
not

on

we
find
ourselves
slightly
constrain
with

what
we

we
be
not

that

my

instinct
in

what

have

however
,
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
examine
that
proposal
further
on

.
I
would
like
to
speak
to
section

I
accept
what
the
minister
say
.
I
will
withdraw
the
amendment
,
while
reserve
the
right
to
reintroduce
it
on

but
I
do
not
understand
why
the
minister
cannot
accept
it
.
in
light
of
what
the
minister
say
subsequent
to
speak
to
my
amendment
-----
my
understanding
of
what
the
minister
say
be
that
she
propose
to
bring
forth
a
amendment
to
allow
she
official
to
attend
judicial
proceedings
.
I
be
worried
about
the
propose
new
section
35
d
(
2
)
of
the
Child
Care
Act
1991
,
as
insert
by
the
section
of
the
Bill
we
be
discuss
,
which
state
:
follow
the
making
of
a
order
under
section
35
b
(
3
)
,
the
minister
may
at
the
request
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
appoint
for
the
child
provide
,
or
arrange
for
the
provision
,
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
of
such
legal
advice
or
legal
representation
,
or
both
,
as
the
minister
consider
appropriate
have
regard
to
the
matter
specify
in
subsection
(
3
)
.
the
propose
new
section
35
b
(
3
)
state
:
in
proceedings
under
part
iv
,
IVB
or
VI
the
District
Court
,
of
its
own
motion
or
on
the
application
of
any
party
to
the
proceedings
,
shall
consider
whether
to
direct
that
a
guardian
ad
litem
be
appoint
for
a
child
and
the
court
may
by
order
so
direct
.
I
wonder
where
the
minister
be
go
with
the
creation
of
this
entity
within
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
.
I
may
have
inadvertently
and
incorrectly
state
on
second
stage
that
responsibility
for
this
entity
will
be
give
to
Tusla
.
that
be
a
error
on
my
part
.
we
be
now
create
a
entity
that
will
come
under
the
remit
of
the
minister
of
the
day
.
obviously
,
the
minister
will
have
control
of
its
budget
.
while
the
minister
will
not
become
a
party
to
court
proceedings
,
he
or
she
will
be
able
to
go
into
court
.
could
that
put
the
minister
into
conflict
with
the
child
law
report
project
,
for
instance
?
we
have
only
just
receive
this
information
.
I
be
speak
for
myself
as
a
opposition
spokesperson
when
I
say
that
all
stakeholder
continue
to
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
the
independence
of
the
Child
Care
Law
Reporting
Project
.
any
recommendation
make
arise
from
the
work
of
the
project
have
the
confidence
of
everybody
who
be
involved
in
the
whole
area
of
childcare
law
.
will
it
be
leave
to
the
discretion
of
the
District
Court
judge
?

I
ask

I
appreciate
that

I

the
fact

how
about

I
be

absolutely
civil

I
merely
wish

I
be
just
make
the
point

it
would
have
be
useful

have

because
it
would
have
give

a
good
chance

it
would
have
be
useful
to
have
hear
from

on

perhaps
the
minister
-----
on
the
issue
of
the
role
of
the
ombudsman
in
respect
of
the
legislation
before
we
and
whether
that
could

could
the

I
to

I
welcome
the
minister
.
on
the
figure
of
€
6000
per
week
,
I
would
welcome
a
further
breakdown
.
the
minister
state
it
be
the
average
cost
of
each
residential
place
and
that
it
be
across
voluntary
,
statutory
and
private
provider
.
it
would
be
very
useful
if
the
minister
could
provide
to
we
a
breakdown
.
how
be
the
metric
of
€
6000
arrive
at
?
what
percentage
of
it
be
attributable
to
insurance
?
what
proportion
of
the
cost
be
attributable
to
the
cost
of
rent
private
property
?
what
be
the
real
-
time
metric
for
staffing
cost
?
I
have
some
sympathy
in
that
there
be
quite
a
number
of
child
with
very
complex
need
but
the
figure
of
€
6000
,
or
€
312000
per
annum
,
seem
extremely
high
.
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
breakdown
or
a
further
perspective
from
the
minister
on
the
justification
for
that
cost
.
one
would
always
appreciate
that
.
one
always
appreciate
that
there
be
a
ratio
of
staff
to
child
.
that
be
a
give
and
it
be
widely
understand
in
every
context
where
one
be
deal
with
child
.
if
in
parse
a
figure
of
€
6000
,
the
minister
be
say
it
be
across
residential
,
voluntary
,
statutory
and
private
provider
,
and
if
a
certain
number
of
private
company
be
offer
the
service
,
how
much
of
the
€
6000
be
for
profit
in
private
facility
?
the
private
provider
be
obviously
offer
the
service
because
the
State
be
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
how
much
do
the
private
company
have
the
State
over
a
barrel
-
I
do
not
mean
that
in
a
pejorative
way
-
because
of
the
lack
of
supply
of
state
-
fund
facility
for
the
provision
of
service
to
child
with
complex
need
and
child
who
need
residential
placement
?
I
do
not
deny
that
we
need
to
use
private
company
where
there
be
a
lack
of
supply
in
the
public
sector
but
I
be
worried
that
it
be
always
possible
to
make
a
charge
that
private
company
can
profiteer
in
provide
such
a
service
.
that
be
my
worry
.
a
figure
of
€
6000
per
week
,
or
€
312000
per
annum
,
be
a
extraordinary
amount
of
money
.
that
be
why
I
ask
the
question
about
the
breakdown
in
the
first
instance
.
if
we
be
involved
in
a
estimate
programme
here
—
it
be
one
of
the
few
power
we
have
as
deputy
in
term
of
interrogate
the
estimate
,
especially
where
a
Supplementary
estimate
be
seek
from
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
—
it
be
vital
that
we
have
a
breakdown
of
the
€
6000
and
that
we
have
more
oversight
in
respect
of
how
much
the
private
provider
be
actually
earn
as
private
provider
of
what
be
essentially
a
vital
service
that
nobody
would
deny
to
any
child
.
all
I
want
to
know
be
-----
that
be
accept
.
we
need
transparency
around
this
process
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
might
I
say
-----
but
we
be
entitle
to
expect
that
the
minister
would
come
before
we
with
a
breakdown
of
the
€
6000
per
week
,
and
that
she
official
would
have
anticipate
that
we
would
have
interrogate
that
figure
of
€
6000
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
child
care
(
amendment
)
Bill
2019
,
which
pertain
to
guardian
ad
litem
?
it
seem
to
have
go
to
ground
.
I
be
not
be
facetious
but
we
be
go
great
gun
on
Committee
stage
.
we
have
robust
exchange
,
as
we
tend
to
have
,
which
be
good
.
it
appear
,
however
,
to
have
just
drop
off
the
face
of
a
cliff
.
it
have
be
long
.
we
come
out
of
the
recess
and
out
of
the
starting
block
.
it
be
publish
.
fair
enough
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
Bill
?
I
thank
the
minister
and
I
appreciate
that
.

he
say
that
it
will
happen
within
the
next
number
of
week
but
I
ask
he
to
provide
certainty
on
when
exactly
the
transfer
will
happen
and
what
budget
line
will
transfer
across
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
National
Disability
Authority
will
come
across
and
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
will
be
fully
engage
in
the
Department
of
child
,
disability
,
equality
and
integration
and
will
have
delegate
function
as
well
.
we
do
not
have
a
sense
yet
of
when
or
how
that
will
happen
and
what
it
entail
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
this
committee
to
have
a
good
insight
into
the
status
of
the
transfer
of
power
.
what
way
do
the
chairman
want
to
conduct
this
meeting
?
be
a
question
and
answer
session
with
the
minister
appropriate
for
now
?
okay
.
that
be
my
first
question
because
the
minister
say
the
transfer
will
happen
in
the
next
number
of
week
but
before
we
know
it
,
December
will
be
upon
we
.
we
need
great
certainty
on
that
matter
.
the
National
Disability
Authority
will
be
come
under
the
minister
's
ambit
but
where
be
the
demarcation
between
child
and
adult
in
that
?
this
issue
be
raise
early
in
the
context
of
the
work
programme
of
this
committee
.
where
be
the
demarcation
between
child
and
adult
?
will
the
Department
be
deal
with
adult
too
?
the
minister
speak
about
childcare
.
very
serious
issue
arise
in
the
provision
of
childcare
service
during
Covid
-
19
.
some
of
we
be
understandably
angry
and
we
be
reflect
the
anger
of
we
constituent
.
it
be
only
fair
to
acknowledge
that
the
minister
and
he
departmental
official
have
do
they
level
good
to
work
through
a
lot
of
the
issue
,
notwithstand
some
big
philosophical
issue
around
the
rights
of
worker
within
that
sector
and
its
funding
.
we
will
get
to
all
that
in
due
course
.
I
want
to
pin
the
Minister
down
on
what
the
budget
line
will
look
like
after
the
new
responsibility
come
through
.
that
be
the
first
theme
.
second
,
I
seek
assurance
on
whether
the
estimate
will
lead
to
more
social
worker
or
a
assurance
that
no
person
who
be
front
-
line
worker
will
be
deploy
to
contact
tracing
and
testing
if
it
result
in
the
loss
of
service
to
a
child
.
there
be
26000
child
wait
on
occupational
therapy
here
.
that
figure
be
from
a
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
put
to
the
Minister
for
Health
.
it
be
unconscionable
that
child
would
still
be
wait
for
service
and
the
list
be
get
long
in
a
whole
range
of
area
.
I
want
the
minister
to
succeed
in
he
role
and
for
he
Department
to
be
successful
but
the
evidence
suggest
we
be
go
slightly
backwards
because
of
Covid
.
while
the
Department
will
be
big
and
have
a
large
budget
,
it
look
as
though
front
-
line
service
be
be
retrench
to
a
degree
which
be
have
a
effect
on
family
.
I
think
we
be
all
feel
that
as
public
representative
.
I
will
be
happy
to
support
the
minister
in
any
effort
to
stem
that
tide
.
a
previous
meeting
of
this
committee
consider
the
child
care
(
amendment
)
Bill
2019
,
which
deal
with
guardian
ad
litem
.
it
go
to
ground
,
have
reach
Committee
stage
.
it
have
disappear
into
the
ether
.
I
do
not
want
to
see
the
ten
propose
Bills
which
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
committee
put
on
the
never
-
never
.
I
refer
to
bill
like
the
parental
leave
and
benefit
Bill
,
the
adoptive
benefit
Bill
and
the
assist
decision
-
making
(
capacity
)
Bill
,
many
of
which
have
be
do
the
round
for
some
time
.
if
some
energy
be
give
to
this
bill
it
will
have
a
tremendous
impact
.
I
be
not
assure
by
heading
such
as
"
revise
head
of
Bill
in
preparation
of
preparatory
work
underway
"
in
relation
to
the
child
care
(
amendment
)
Bill
,
for
instance
.
the
committee
have
come
a
long
way
on
this
and
invest
a
lot
of
time
.
it
be
all
about
resource
and
money
.
there
be
a
certain
narrative
about
social
worker
and
where
they
sit
in
the
wide
landscape
.
the
recruitment
of
social
worker
be
a
long
-
standing
issue
for
this
committee
.
the
question
of
whether
there
be
resource
to
recruit
more
now
arise
.
perhaps
the
minister
can
guarantee
,
in
the
context
of
the
estimate
process
-
to
hang
it
on
its
hook
and
remain
on
message
-
that
there
will
be
more
social
worker
recruit
.
we
be
already
see
the
negative
effect
of
the
insufficient
number
of
social
worker
,
particularly
during
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
.
the
question
be
whether
something
within
the
estimate
process
can
give
we
grounds
for
hope
there
.

''
.
I
welcome
the
minister
.
this
be
a
complex
Bill
and
,
to
be
fair
to
he
,
there
be
a
honest
attempt
to
promulgate
legislation
for
what
be
a
complex
area
.
in
this
amendment
,
I
wish
to
ensure
that
the
language
around
the
UN
Convention
on
the
rights
of
Person
with
Disability
,
UNCRPD
,
which
be
conclude
in
2006
,
be
firmly
embed
in
the
principal
act
.
now
that
we
have
ratify
the
convention
,
I
seek
to
emb
a
explicit
requirement
for
court
to
interpret
the
act
in
a
manner
that
give
effect
to
the
convention
,
thereby
strengthen
the
potential
for
it
to
be
interpret
in
a
manner
compatible
with
the
human
rights
obligation
under
that
convention
.
I
be
speak
specifically
to
my
amendment
.
I
take
it
from
the
minister
that
he
be
not
minded
to
accept
my
amendment
.
on
that
basis
,
I
seek
leave
to
withdraw
my
amendment
and
submit
it
again
on
report
stage
.
my
rationale
for
propose
it
be
that
the
open
line
in
the
Bill
's
explanatory
memorandum
read
:
"
the
Bill
give
further
effect
to
the
Unite
Nation
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
(
UNCRPD
)
.
"
I
would
have
think
that
it
be
entirely
appropriate
for
we
to
give
effect
to
that
in
a
explicit
way
so
as
to
ensure
that
the
court
"
shall
construe
this
act
"
in
a
manner
that
give
effect
to
the
UNCRPD
.
human
rights
law
be
constantly
evolve
.
by
add
the
amendment
,
there
would
be
recognition
of
what
be
good
practice
within
the
field
and
a
reaffirmation
of
Ireland
's
commitment
to
refine
and
interpret
the
law
in
a
manner
consistent
with
we
human
rights
obligation
.
while
the
minister
and
I
will
not
depart
from
the
necessity
of
ensure
that
we
promulgate
in
a
way
that
be
consistent
with
we
human
rights
obligation
,
I
remain
hopeful
that
he
will
revert
to
this
matter
on
report
stage
.
if
he
be
determined
not
to
accept
the
amendment
,
be
there
a
wording
that
the
government
side
could
come
up
with
for
a
specific
provision
in
the
legislation
to
ensure
that
the
court
"
shall
construe
this
act
"
in
a
manner
that
give
effect
to
the
UNCRPD
?
it
be
important
to
beal
this
provision
into
the
legislation
in
a
way
that
it
have
not
be
heretofore
.
I
hold
to
my
position
of
withdraw
the
amendment
.
I
want
to
think
about
what
the
minister
have
say
regard
he
intervention
in
respect
of
the
amendment
.
I
would
like
to
return
to
it
on
report
stage
.
I
want
to
tease
it
out
a
little
more
in
my
mind
.
I
will
withdraw
it
but
I
formally
seek
leave
to
resubmit
it
on
report

.
I
move
amendment
no.

I
accept
the
argument
make
by
the
minister
in
respect
of
press
reportage
of
the
issue
and
the
sensitivity
therein
.
I
be
out
of
practice
procedurally
.
what
be
the
strict
rule
with
regard
to
amendment
that
be
rule
out
of
order
where
one
have
receive
correspondence
from
the
committee
chair
but
one
wish
to
push
back
on
that
correspondence
?
I
be
not
try
to
put
the
chair
on
the
spot
but
one
of
my
own
amendment
,
no.
24
,
be
rule
out
of
order
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
impose
a
charge
on
the
Revenue
.
I
accept
that
but
what
if
we
want
to
speak
more
broadly
in
the
hope
that
the
minister
would
respond
to
the
content
of
a
amendment
?
I
accept
that
amendment
no.
18
have
be
rule
out
of
order
but
I
would
love
the
minister
to
engage
on
the
issue
inherent
in
the
amendment
.
thank
you
chair
.
I
accept
that
.
I
move

no.

the
follow
:
''
(5
)
where
a
temporary
prohibition
order
be
make
,
the
director
shall
,
as
soon
as
be
practicable
,
serve
a
copy
of
the
order
and
of
the
affidavit
refer
to

the
attorney
concerned
,
and
on
any
other
person
identify
by
the
director
and
approve
by
the
court
.
''
.
the
rationale
for
this
amendment
be
to
ensure
that
the
order
and
affidavit
be
not
only
serve
on
the
decision
supporter
but
also
on
the
relevant
person
to
whom
the
matter
relate
.
this
be
essential
to
ensure
the
relevant
person
's
right
to
know
about
matter
concern
they
be
respect
.
the
relevant
person
be
ultimately
the
person
who
be
most
impact
by
such
a
order
and
have
a
right
to
the
information
contain
in
the
director
's
affidavit
,
which
have
give
rise
to
the
temporary
prohibition
order
,
as
well
as
to
be
inform
personally
of
the
order
make
by
the
court
.
I
see
that
the
minister
be
scratch
he
beard
.
he
be
think
about
it
.
I
be
try
to
beal
on
a
amendment
here
that
give
a
absolute
right
because
I
be
fearful
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
the
director
and
the
staff
of
the
dss
will
be
beyond
reproach
,
of
a
system
failure
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
a
look
at
this
before
report
stage
and
consider
provide
a
more
firm
underpin
of
the
relevant
person
's
right
to
know
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
response
.
it
would
be
great
if
it
could
be
tease
out
before
report
stage
.
I
will
withdraw
my
amendment
,
with
leave
to
resubmit
.
if
the
minister
come
up
with
a
good
wording
,
I
will
be
very
happy
to
accept
that
on
report
stage
.
I
move
amendment
no.

that
who
campaign
for
this
legislation
argue
specifically
that
a
comprehensive
review
clause
be
necessary
to
ensure
it
would
remain
under
ongoing
review
at
regular
interval
,
give
the
pace
of
change
in
this
area
globally
and
advance
in
practice
.
this
amendment
would
ensure
the
legislation
be
review
regularly
and
can
be
amend
in
light
of
the
fast
-
pace
rate
of
worldwide
legislative
change
on
legal
capacity
law
.
the
amendment
also
clarify
the
central
role
disabled
people
and
the
organisation
lead
and
govern
by
they
should
play
in
every
review
of
the
legislation
.
I
will
withdraw
my
amendment
with
leave
to
resubmit
they
.
I
have
a
impression
that
when
we
legislate
,
we
create
obligation
on
institution
and
agency
like
IHREC
.
my
concern
be
that
we
have
another
piece
of
legislation
here
and
the
minister
be
say
IHREC
will
have
a
key
role
in
monitor
the
working
of
that
legislation
.
what
we
do
not
have
sight
of
be
whether
the
decision
support
service
or
IHREC
will
see
a
comparative
increase
in
resource
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
the
work
.
we
all
acknowledge
it
be
a
increase
workload
.
we
need
to
receive
some
comfort
that
the
minister
,
in
he
engagement
with
IHREC
in
respect
of
this
legislation
and
the
legislation
that
be
come
down
the
track
,
would
give
some
signal
of
additional
capacity
by
way
of
whole
-
time
equivalent
for
that
organisation
to
meet
they
increase
demand
in
term
of
monitor
legislation
.
I
would
welcome
some
favourable
comment
from
the
minister
in
that
regard
if
he
be
in
a
position
to
give
that
now
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I

yes

it

with

one
try
try

put
oneself

position
of
people

find
themselves

the
victim
of
domestic
violence
,
but
one
cannot
possibly
internalise
that
experience
.
from
a
practical
point

view
,
what
step
could
someone
who
want
to
take
action
take
and
will
the
five
day
within
a
12
-
month
period
be
sufficient
to
do
so
?
for
instance
,
if
someone
be
seek
medical
attention
,
that
person
may
make
multiple
visit
to
a
gp
or
consultant
in
that
12
-
month
period
.
it
be
easy
to
anticipate
that
seek
the
service
of
a
victim
support
organisation
would
occur
over
quite
a
number
of
day
.
Psychological
or
professional
counselling
would
occur
over
quite
a
number
of
day
.
very
often
,
such
visit
be
make
within
work
hour
.
what
about
relocation
,
either
temporarily

permanently
?
when
we
start
add
up
all
of
the
day
that
the
minister
codify
in

when
a
person
can
take
leave

circumstance

for
example
,
visit
a
legal
practitioner
,
seek
legal
advice

even
seek

assistance

Garda
Síochána
-
I
would
contend
that

day
within

be
not
enough
.
I
ask
the

find
themselves
in
this
circumstance
to
get
access
to
the
service
,
we
know
how
long
it
take
.
deputy
Cairn
have
just
outline
this
from
a
rural
point
of
view
in
particular
.
I
represent
a
broadly
similar
type
of
constituency
in
that
regard
.
I
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
might
revisit
this
,
if
at
all
possible
.
in
my
experience
,
employer
have
be
understand
and
they
allow
for
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
.
my
second
point
on
that
propose
new
section
pertain
to
domestic
violence
leave
where
there
be
a
prescribe
daily
rate
of
pay
.
the
minister
will
make
regulation
under
subsection
6
and
will
assess
''
the
potential
impact
,
include
the
potential
for
any
disproportionate
or
other
adverse
impact
,
that
the
rate
of
domestic
violence
leave
pay
to
be
prescribe
will
have
on
the
economy
generally
,
specific
sector
of
the
economy
,
employer
or
employee
"
.
to
enable
we
to
support
this
amendment
,
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
from
the
minister
of
what
exactly
this
will
mean
in
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
.
where
be
the
thinking
in
the
Department
on
that
element
of
this
government
amendment
?
who
the
minister
be
talk
to
about
this
?
what
be
deem
to
be
a
standard
rate
of
pay
?
be
there
think
around
that
?
I
be
not
aware
of
what
the
standard
would
be
.
who
will
the
minister
liaise
with
on
that
?
will
the
minister
liaise
with
employer
,
employee
's
representative
,
trade
union
and
so
on
in
that
regard
?
to
I
,
it
seem
to
be
quite
vague
.
I
be
argue
two
point
,
the
first
of
which
be
that
the
five
day
be
not
enough
and
the
second
of
which
be
that
we
need
more
detail
in
respect
of
the
prescribe
daily
rate
of
pay
.
it
would
be
invariably
for
woman
and
let
I
not
put
a
tooth
in
that
.
woman
will
primarily
be
ask
I
what
the
prescribe
daily
rate
of
pay
will
be
.
I
think
they
be
entitle
to
some
degree
of
clarity
around
that
.
I
be
go
to
speak
to
the
generality
of
section
6
but
be
happy
to
come
back
in
if
other
member
want
to
stay
on
the
point
be
raise
.
on
section
6
,
we
put
forward
a
amendment
,
which
be
rule
out
of
order
,
in
respect
of
the
right
of
a
employee
to
seek
leave
without
pay
-
it
be
important
to
stress
it
be
without
pay
-
from
he
or
she
employment
for
the
purpose
of
obtain
service
around
reproductive
health
.
we
be
prescriptive
about
it
be
where
a
employee
have
miscarry
a
child
have
a
gestational
age
of
28
week
or
less
or
in
order
to
receive
treatment
from
a
register
medical
practitioner
in
the
State
in
relation
to
pregnancy
,
childbirth
or
assist
human
reproduction
.
I
receive
a
letter
from
the
chair
state
that
amendment
no.
7
could
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
and
must
be
rule
out
of
order
in
accordance
with
stand
order
212(
3
)
.
let
we
for
the
public
record
state
that
,
absolutely
,
chair
within
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
find
themselves
in
the
invidious
position
of
have
to
sign
off
on
this
letter
when
somebody
somewhere
deem
committee
amendment
be
disallow
because
there
be
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
as
proposer
of
the
amendment
,
nobody
come
to
I
to
say
they
think
the
amendment
will
impose
such
a
charge
.
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
I
see
why
the
Labour
Party
amendment
should
be
disallow
.
we
clearly
state
the
entitlement
be
leave
without
pay
.
how
could
that
impose
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
?
it
cut
out
a
raft
of
debate
on
meaningful
issue
on
a
range
of
legislative
proposal
put
forward
by
the
Government
and
the
Opposition
.
that
be
a
philosophical
point
,
one
could
argue
,
but
I
would
have
think
a
amendment
of
this
nature
would
be
pertinent
to
the
Bill
.
the
name
of
the
Bill
be
the
work
life
Balance
and
Miscellaneous
provision
Bill
2022
and
we
merely
seek
to
put
in
place
something
that
would
speak
to
thousand
of
woman
.
there
be
a
attitudinal
issue
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
regard
reproductive
health
-
related
leave
where
woman
encounter
massive
opposition
from
a
small
minority
of
employer
.
I
know
of
woman
who
use
90
%
of
they
annual
leave
for
ivf
treatment
.
I
know
of
woman
who
describe
they
humiliation
when
they
seek
unpaid
leave
after
a
miscarriage
and
be
turn
down
by
a
employer
who
say
miscarriage
be
common
and
most
people
just
get
on
with
it
.
if
we
can
find
a
mechanism
to
legislate
for
that
under
the
ambit
of
this
legislation
,
we
would
support
that
,
but
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
I
see
why
we
amendment
be
disallow
.
I
appreciate
what
the
chair
be
go
to
say
.
I
appreciate
that
and
thank
the
chair
for
she
latitude
.
be
it
not
a
awful
indictment
that
we
receive
that
answer
?
it
be
a
indictment
of
the
system
we
operate
in
this
country
.
it
be
not
the
case
.
that
be
a
fair
point
.
be
this
not
premature
cut
-
off
point
give
the
nature
of
society
and
that
child
have
to
be
look
after
into
they
teenage
year
as
well
?
the
number
use
be
quite
arbitrary
.
be
it
possible
to
include
that
age
as
part
of
the
two
-
year
review
?
it
would
be
great
to
hear
from
the
minister
after
two
year
how
that
period
have
work
.
the
present
minister
may
be
in
situ
in
two
year
's
time
or
it
may
be
he
successor
.
I
would
not
mind
have
a
opportunity
to
look
back
at
this
legislation
in
two
year
's
time
to
see
how
this
provision
work
in
real
term
.
I
only
want
to
speak
to
the
minister
's
own
language
where
he
state
,
in
section
13
b
(
4
)
,
"
a
employee
's
approve
flexible
working
arrangement
shall
not
commence
before
a
time
when
the
employee
concerned
have
complete
6
month
continuous
employment
with
the
employer
concerned
.
"
if
I
be
to
look
at
that
from
a
employer
's
perspective
,
be
the
employer
to
adhere
to
the
law
,
say
he
or
she
cannot
give
the
employee
this
flexible
working
arrangement
because
the
six
month
have
not
elapse
?
I
think
I
understand
the
minister
.
I
suppose
there
may
be
circumstance
in
which
a
kindly
employer
may
wish
to
be
flexible
towards
he
or
she
employee
and
within
the
six
month
,
notwithstand
that
the
employee
be
temporary
or
whatever
the
employee
's
status
be
,
there
may
be
circumstance
in
which
a
employer
would
say
that
it
be
within
the
six
month
,
he
or
she
would
like
to
give
the
leave
to
the
employee
but
he
or
she
have
look
at
the
legislation
and
it
state
the
employer
cannot
.
the
legislation
be
be
prescriptive
by
my
interpretation
.
maybe
I
be
wrong
in
my
interpretation
.
perhaps
it
could
be
look
at
again
.
if
it
be
overly
prescriptive
and
if
there
be
circumstance
where
a
employer
want
to
give
a
employee
within
the
six
month
some
flexibility
,
maybe
there
be
scope
to
do
that
or
else
maybe
I
be
misread
the
entirety
of
the
section
.
I
might
come
back
to
it
on
report
stage
.
we
might
tease
it
out
further
,
if
that
be
okay
.
I
will
press
it
too
.
before
we
move
on
to
section
9
,
can
we
go
backwards
for
one
second
?
in
respect
of
the
insertion
of
a
new
section
7
,
there
be
reference
to
leave
for
medical
care
purpose
.
a
question
arise
as
to
what
constitute
medical
care
purpose
.
perhaps
the
minister
could
come
back
with
a
more
detailed
explanation
in
that
regard
.
how
liberal
or
strident
be
that
interpretation
?
that
be
all
I
want
to
say
.
the
chair
be
move
proficiently
through
the
Bill
.
I
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
chair
.
the
definition
of
leave
for
medical
care
purpose
be
unclear
in
my
mind
.
how
liberally
will
that
be
apply
?
be
that

''
.
that
be
all
self
-
explanatory
.
I
be
not
sure
what
the
minister
's
position
be
;
we
will
hear
from
he
shortly
.
we
feel
certain
issue
be
not
contain
within
the
legislative
proposal
before
we
.
I
have
be
tell
that
the
amendment
be
in
order
.
one
of
the
limited
tool
we
in
opposition
have
be
to
seek
report
on
the
issue
that
be
pertinent
to
the
many
people
who
feel
leave
out
and
feel
that
they
should
be
include
in
the
Bill
.
the
amendment
would
at
least
allow
for
a
report
on
that
issue
affect
that
people
who
see
themselves
as
be
exclude
by
the
Bill
.
we
need
to
delve
further
into
what
the
minister
be
say
as
to
what
he
will
return
with
on
report
stage
.
the
question
be
now
whether
I
withdraw
or
press
my
amendment
.
I
be
of
a
mind
to
press
it
.
before
I
do
,
however
,
I
will
signal
my
intention
to
propose
another
such
amendment
on
report
stage
.
I
will
say
that
for
the
record
.
we
will
wait
and
see
what
the
minister
have
to
offer
on
report
stage
.
on
the
issue
of
the
180
day
,
the
reason
for
we
amendment
be
that
we
feel
strongly
that
the
issue
of
temporary
absence
and
the
180
day
under
section
13
be
hang
like
the
sword
of
Damocles
.
there
need
to
be
some
reporting
mechanism
to
speak
for
that
people
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
come
back
on
report
stage
with
some
language
in
that
regard
because
what
the
minister
be
propose
in
section
13
seem
too
strident
or
prescriptive
.
it
refer
to
a
person
who
"
be
resident
in
a
relevant
institution
for
not
less
than
180
day
,
shall
be
entitle
to
a
general
payment
in
respect
of
the
number
of
day
,
refer
to
in
column
2
of
schedule
2
at
any
reference
number
,
during
which
the
person
be
so
resident
"
.
what
we
be
try
to
do
be
to
speak
for
that
people
who
leave
,
come
back
again
and
leave
again
.
they
do
not
seem
to
be
encompass
by
what
the
minister
have
bring
before
we
.
as
my
colleague
,
Deputy
Funchion
and
Cairn
,
state
,
more
than
60
%
of
child
be
not
deem
to
be
eligible
for
redress
and
not
cover
by
this
legislation
.
we
have
to
find
some
way
to
address
that
.
I
feel
that
my
question
during
the
second
stage
debate
as
to
the
modelling
or
cost
permutation
the
Department
have
consider
with
regard
to
the
exclusion
of
the
category
of
people
who
spend
less
than
six
month
in
a
home
have
still
not
be
definitively
answer
.
the
justification
for
not
include
that
people
have
not
be
provide
.
I
do
not
think
that
people
can
be
exclude
.
whatever
the
reporting
mechanism
look
like
,
it
have
to
include
that
people
as
well
because
they
have
a
voice
.
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
I
appreciate
the
point
the
minister
make
about
the
180
day
.
I
may
have
misinterpret
that
initially
so
I
take
that
point
.
speak
to
the
amendment
,
however
,
the
question
be
merely
whether
the
180
day
's
residence
requirement
provide
for
should
be
amend
or
repeal
.
first
,
I
hold
to
the
view
that
a
report
into
that
be
still
a
reasonable
ask
.
second
be
the
question
as
to
whether
the
requirement
impose
on
applicant
by
section
27
(
3
)
should
be
remove
.
the
logic
of
where
I
be
come
from
here
be
that
if
somebody
be
resident
in
a
relevant
institution
for
up
to
and
include
89
day
,
the
general
payment
be
€
5000
.
that
be
accord
to
schedule
3
.
the
total
amount
,
therefore
,
be
€
5000
.
the
minister
's
subsection
(
3
)
state
that
if
one
receive
a
payment
of
€
5000
,
one
"
shall
not
[
and
I
stress
"
shall
not
"
]
institute
civil
proceedings
,
and
shall
discontinue
any
other
proceedings
institute
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
applicant
"
.
my
worry
about
that
be
that
there
be
the
compensation
,
which
in
this
instance
be
small
,
but
there
be
also
the
issue
of
the
seek
of
justice
,
whereby
a
person
will
seek
to
have
recourse
to
the
court
.
I
just
wonder
what
the
legal
basis
of
sign
a
waiver
will
be
to
that
end
.
by
dint
of
this
legislation
,
I
cannot
help
but
feel
that
the
minister
be
restrict
people
from
be
able
to
seek
recourse
to
the
court
in
seek
to
have
justice
apply
to
themselves
,
which
be
a
fundamental
right
that
people
have
.
be
the
minister
take
that
right
away
from
they
if
they
sign
this
waiver
state
they
have
receive
they
€
5000
and
can
no
long
institute
or
take
any
further
proceedings
?
I
be
not
a
lawyer
.
I
would
defer
to
legal
expert
on
this
one
.
be
the
minister
entitle
to
do
that
?
obviously
,
he
feel
he
be
because
,
otherwise
,
he
would
not
legislate
for
it
,
but
what
be
the
legal
strength
of
such
a
waiver
?
how
be
it
to
be
write
?
be
it
a
contract
?
be
it
a
pro
forma
form
that
will
be
handle
by
a
administrator
within
the
Department
?
how
do
the
minister
envisage
that
this
would
be
deal
with
?
finally
,
and
I
thank
you
for
you
latitude
,
chair
,
that
be
why
I
seek
to
have
a
report
into
how
this
will
operate
.
if
a
hundred
people
come
forward
,
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
at
€
5000
per
person
,
some
of
that
people
may
feel
that
they
would
like
recourse
to
the
court
on
this
and
that
,
while
they
have
sign
a
waiver
,
they
still
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
court
.
I
do
not
think
we
should
disbar
that
people
from
go
to
the
court
.
that
be
where
I
be
come
from
.
I
refer
to
have
some
regard
to
the
role
that
public
representative
,
deputy
,
Senator
and
other
,
will
have
in
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
people
they
represent
who
will
interface
with
this
new
office
.
what
be
be
create
here
seem
similar
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
and
it
be
normal
practice
for
we
to
interface
with
that
Department
and
the
HSE
on
regular
payment
be
pay
out
by
the
State
.
this
be
particularly
the
case
regard
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
I
hope
the
role
of
deputy
,
Senator
and
other
would
be
recognise
and
that
we
would
not
be
hamper
by
the
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
gdpr
,
if
permission
and
consent
be
give
to
we
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
we
constituent
.
I
refer
to
we
be
recognise
as
public
representative
to
some
degree
in
interface
with
such
a
body
.
I
say
this
because
not
everybody
will
be
able
to
make
they
own
case
in
this
context
.
I
be
stretch
this
,
so
I
beg
the
acting
chair
's
indulgence
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
show
some
caution
.
there
be
a
time
when
we
could
approach
Irish
Water
with
representation
and
that
would
go
into
a
central
repository
,
where
they
would
be
handle
by
a
third
party
and
so
on
.
there
be
issue
around
that
.
I
will
be
so
bold
as
to
make
a
suggestion
.
I
take
the
minister
's
point
that
it
should
not
necessarily
be
put
on
a
statutory
basis
,
but
there
have
to
be
recognition
of
the
role
of
the
public
representative
.
person
need
to
have
advocate
on
they
behalf
,
and
that
be
largely
a
role
that
we
all
have
as
public
representative
.
I
would
not
like
to
see
the
organisation
write
back
to
the
person
who
be
make
the
representation
on
the
basis
of
the
length
of
time
he
or
she
spend
in
a
institution
say
that
the
organisation
will
not
speak
to
deputy
Sherlock
on
the
matter
and
he
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
the
system
and
culture
of
the
organisation
must
be
one
of
interface
with
the
public
and
must
recognise
we
as
public
representative
act
on
behalf
of
people
.
this
be
where
I
be
come
from
-
I
should
have
be
clear
about
it
.
we
will
take
a
look
at
it
again
,
but
a
thought
occur
to
I
in
respect
of
payment
that
accrue
to
person
who
be
deem
eligible
for
a
payment
.
have
there
be
a
discussion
with
the
Department
of
social
Protection
on
how
this
payment
be
deal
with
when
assess
means
for
other
payment
under
that
Department
's
rule
?
be
that
clearly
state
in
the
legislation
?
up
to
and
include
all
payment
under
the
schedule
.
the
minister
be
allow
for
payment
of
up
to
€
125000
.
I
seek
further
clarification
concern
the
chief
decide
officer
.
we
be
talk
about
a
enhance
medical
card
.
there
be
physiological
element
to
that
.
be
psychological
element
take
into
account
?
I
be
try
to
get
the
minister
on
the
record
say
they
be
,
so
that
if
issue
arise
down
the
line
,
we
can
refer
back
to
committee
debate
.
this
be
thought
that
be
occur
to
I
as
be
seek
to
legislate
here
in
situ
.
I
be
try
to
think
of
the
person
who
present
with
trauma
or
psychological
issue
where
there
be
psychiatric
or
psychological
report
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
misinterpret
the
circumstance
in
which
the
enhance
medical
card
will
be
grant
.
and
that
be
it
.
I
suppose
I
be
so
culturally
entwine
in
Department
of
social
Protection
scheme
,
where
you
seek
to
fight
case
on
behalf
of
people
,
that
it
be
hard
to
decouple
myself
from
that
.

marketing

also

Fish

it

that
.
I
move

no.

out

it

argue
that

there
could

that
be
the
basis
of

in

of
the
Minister

State
's
response
,
I
will
be
happy
to
examine
this
again
on
report
stage
.
I
will
withdraw
my
amendment
.
it
be
a
question
of
recognise
the

of

stakeholder
in

and
find
some
formula
for
they
to
have

voice

this
be
the
primary
aim
of
the
amendment
.
in
support
of
the
amendment
,
I
take
the
view
that
if
what
we
be
talk
about
here
be
a
natural
resource
,
then
we
need
to
hold
the
research
up
to
public
scrutiny
.
if
that
mean
it
be
contested
,
so
be
it
.
that
be
the
nature
of
research
,
whether
social
or
scientific
.
research
should
be
contestable
and
hold
up
to
public
scrutiny
.
I
support
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
the
provision
state
the
minister
may
"
specify
by
order
alternative
means
"
.
that
wording
be
too
vague
.
it
would
be
helpful
if
there
be
a
more
qualitative
interpretation
of
what
it
mean
on
report
stage
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I

perhaps
