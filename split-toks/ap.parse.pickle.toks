I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
reporting
by
the
Irish
Examiner
today
that
Cork
University
Hospital
be
set
to
become
the
only
acute
hospital
in
Cork

Victoria
University
Hospital
in
Cork
city
,
and
Kerry
General

,
all
of
which
currently
provide
acute
care
.
I
seek
such
a
debate
in
the
House
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
to
explain
how
she
propose
that
Cork
University
Hospital
will
become
the
sole
provider
of
acute
care
.
I
also
seek
a
explanation
as
to
how
people
's
life
in
the
catchment
area
of
this
hospital
will
be
affect
as
a
result
of
this
reconfiguration
.
be
it
in

to
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
to
come
before
the

to
discuss
the
reconfiguration
of

in
the

I
thank
the

for

the

on

to
the

in

be
there

within

and
will
the

ask
at

Fishery
Council
for

be
abolish
in
2015
.
notwithstanding
that
we
cannot
foretell
what
will
happen
in

market
,
the
government
must
take
responsibility
for
the
question
that
be
on

farmer
's
lip
.
will
farmer
be
able
to
produce
milk
after

,
notwithstand
the

difficulty
?
it
would
appear
the
government
have
no
coherent
policy
regard
the
potential
loss
of
many
farm
and
a
outflow
from
farming
because
we
do
not
know
what
will
happen
in
2015
.
there
be
no
sense
of
direction
from
the
government
in

of
plan
for
that
eventuality
.
farmer
need
to
get
such

do
the

acknowledge
that
approximately

occur
in
2007
in
addition
to
approximately
30000

do
he
also
acknowledge
that
the
suspension
of
this
scheme
will
result
in
a
increase
in
on

farm
burial
without
prior
notification
and
potential

?
on

it

in

what
be
the
nature

the

between
the

Department
and
the

?
the
difference
in

be
significant
at
present
and
even
if
the

be

it
will
remain
high
when
one
look
at
the
various

between

the

can
be
as

have

what
be
the

come
from
this

currently
in

of

?
if
the
rate
of

be
fall
,
can
we
deduce
that
there
be
a
reduce
political
priority
?
will
this
arise
as
part
of
the
review
of
the
programme

imminent

what

if
I
be
be
a
little
cynical
I
would
say
that
it
probably
cost
approximately

200000
to

up

here

answer

I
tab
this

with

the

I
welcome
the

of

Member

Bill
and
I
congratulate
deputy
Flanagan
on
the
work
he
have
do
on
it
.
it
be
worthy
of
support
.
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
sum
up
the
basis
of
the
Bill
last
night
when
he
state
that
this
be
a
growth
industry
for
the
time
in
which
we
live
.
person
find
themselves
indebted
for
whatever
reason
and
in
some
case
they
be
extremely
vulnerable
,
stress
and
unable
to
discharge
debt
,
not
because
of
recklessness
on
they
part
but
because
of
the
economic
circumstance
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
only
a
small
number
of
debtor
plunge
themselves
knowingly
and
recklessly
into
this
circumstance
.
in
so
far
as
recklessness
be
involved
,
it
be
not
merely
on
the
side
of
the
consumer
,
but
be
frequently
share
by
the
lender
where
money
be
recklessly
loan
in
circumstance
where
question
might
reasonably
have
be
raise
about
ability
to
repay
.
honest
,
decent
,
law

citizen
find
themselves
in
this
circumstance
,
and
one
have
hear
the
case
be
make
that
they
be
be
subject
to
debt
collection
method
of
which
the
House
could
not
approve
.
it
be
important
to
speak
about
the
culture
surround
instance
where
people
find
themselves
subject
to
inordinate
amount
of
debt
.
it
have
be
state
previously
that
the
level
of
financial
literacy
in
this
country
still
leave
a
lot
to
be
desire
.
if
I
look
at
the
socio-
economic
group
that
find
itself
largely
at
the
mercy
of
debt
collector
,
I
note
they
be
invariably
person
who
may
not
have
a
degree
of
financial
literacy
that
would
pervade
throughout
all
of
the
socio-economic
strata
.
in
1997
,
the
OECD
conduct
a
international
audit
literacy
survey
.
it
find
that
25
%
of
Irish
adult
have
difficulty
with
simple
everyday
numeracy
and
literacy
task
,
such
as
add
up
a
bill
,
understand
a
payslip
or
fill
in
a
building
society
form
.
the
National
adult
literacy
Association
and
MABS
have
do
much
work
in
this
regard
,
but
it
be
important
that
if
this
Bill
be
take
on
board
,
we
should
look
at
the
overall
context
of
people
get
themselves
into
increase
debt
.
a
proportion
of
that
people
will
find
themselves
in
that
situation
because
they
may
not
have
read
the
fine
print
.
it
should
be
acknowledge
that
IFSRA
have
do
much
work
in
make
the
language
of
financial
service
much
clear
for
people
,
and
the
campaign
for
plain
English
have
achieve
much
in
that
respect
.
however
,
there
be
people
who
be
still
get
into
debt
,
either
through
debt
collection
agency
or
debt
collector
,
and
a
portion
of
that
be
due
to
a
inability
to
understand
the
process
on
which
they
embark
in
the
first
instance
.
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
.
when
it
come
to
the
issuance
of
a
licence
for
the
purpose
of
undertake
debt
collection
,
it
be
important
that
something
be
build
into
the
legislation
that
protect
the
consumer
.
the
licence
holder
should
be
make
take
cognisance
of
a
certain
set
of
criterion
.
although
they
be
not
deal
with
specifically
within
the
legislation
,
perhaps
they
could
be
deal
with
in
section
5
and
section
6
.
where
debt
be
be
collect
,
it
should
be
collect
where
there
be
a
assignment
of
wage
.
this
be
refer
to
in
the
Bill
.
there
must
be
safeguard
to
prevent
a
assignment
of
wage
from
adversely
affect
the
debtor
's
ability
to
maintain
a
basic
standard
of
live
for
themselves
and
they
family
.
in
particular
,
the
level
of
a
assignment
should
not
undermine
the
debtor
's
access
to
the
basic
such
as
food
,
clothing
,
housing
and
basic
utility
,
so
there
be
a
social
inclusion
component
build
into
the
Bill
in
order
for
people
to
have
they
basic
rights
.
there
also
need
to
be
more
regulation
of
the
cost
of
debt
collection
in
order
to
protect
the
debtor
and
he
or
she
family
.
there
be
often
penalty
charge
for
late
payment
build
into
debt
,
and
the
interest
payment
on
that
alone
be
significant
and
sometimes
can
be
a
multiple
of
the
original
debt
.
that
be
something
that
should
be
examine
.
in
welcoming
the
Bill
,
we
also
need
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
be
a
basic
EU
model
.
deputy
Rabbitte
state
last
night
that
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
regulatory
framework
for
debt
collector
across
the
EU
.
my
research
tell
I
that
there
be
no
such
framework
but
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
.
we
need
to
have
some
kind
of
overarching
regulation
of
debt
collection
,
so
that
every
citizen
know
he
or
she
rights
and
entitlement
.
there
should
be
a
effective
right
of
redress
in
the
Bill
for
the
debtor
in
respect
of
harassment
,
excess
debt
recovery
cost
and
the
wrongful
removal
of
goods
.
if
a
regulator
be
empower
to
look
at
this
issue
,
there
should
be
some
framework
to
give
a
right
of
redress
to
the
debtor
.
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
most
unregulated
debt
,
it
be
very
often
at
the
hand
of
moneylender
.
it
remain
a
difficulty
as
to
how
we
can
regulate
moneylender
who
operate
in
the
black
market
,
but
for
that
who
be
incorporate
and
be
collect
debt
,
then
harassment
issue
should
allow
for
a
certain
right
of
redress
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
where
action
be
prove
to
be
excessive
.
the
default
consumer
should
have
a
statutory
right
to
be
advise
on
who
be
authorise
to
collect
the
debt
so
that
there
be
complete
transparency
in
the
process
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
use
of
multiple
debt
collection
agency
to
collect
debt
simultaneously
should
be
prohibit
.
we
deal
with
the
Fines
Bill
last
week
in
the
House
.
we
be
witness
a
sea
change
in
government
thinking
,
so
that
we
be
try
to
keep
people
out
of
prison
and
facilitate
they
by
allow
for
payment
of
fine
by
instalment
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
it
could
be
argue
that
a
similar
type
of
facility
should
exist
for
people
who
find
themselves
in
debt
;
they
should
not
be
subject
to
the
same
offence
.
we
have
have
report
from
Horwath
,
Wrixon
,
Teamwork
and
Professor
John
Higgins
and
today
's
Irish
Examiner
claim
that
all
acute
service
other
than
that
provide
at
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
will
be
do
away
with
.
subsequently
,
a
HSE
press
release
state
that
Kerry
General
Hospital
will
be
exclude
from
the
process
.
what
will
be
the
position
of
acute
service
in
hospital
other
than
Kerry
General
Hospital
and
CUH
from
9
June
?
the
people
of
the
region
have
be
through
the
mill
,
give
the
obfuscation
on
simple
question
on
the
future
location
of
acute
service
for
the
countless
thousand
serve
by
hospital
in
,
for
example
,
Mallow
,
Bantry
and
Cork
.
we
want
a
little
bit
of
decency
and
for
people
to
tell
we
they
intention
with
regard
to
acute
service
.
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
efficient
and
at
the
top
of
its
league
in
term
of
cleanliness
and
the
other
hiqa
statistic
.
it
need
its
acute
service
,
give
its
catchment
area
of
more
than
150000
people
.
on
a
point
of
order
—
—
we
be
tell
it
be
9
June
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
state
it
be
mid
June
.
I
would
like
to
seek
a
clarification
on
that
.
there
be
no
area
value
set
down
in
primary
or
secondary
legislation
or
on
a
administrative
basis
for
minimum
classroom
size
.
however
,
my

have
guideline
in

this

rather

in

it
be
the
current
practice
of
my

to
use
a
guideline
of

of

the

will
the

admit
the
existence
of
a
political
,
social
and
economic
morass
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lie
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
?
the
culture
create
and
nurture
over
the
past
ten
year
have
do
much
damage
to
this
country
's
reputation
abroad
and
have
create
a
cynicism
about
politics
and
the
political
class
.
it
will
take
year
for
any
restoration
of
the
notion
of
public
service
or
for
the
notion
that
democracy
be
fundamentally
good
and
should
be
cherish
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
the
rating
agency
,
Standard
&
Poor's
,
have
change
we
designation
from
aa
+
to
aa
.
one
may
have
certain
view
on
the
nature
of
rating
agency
and
they
methodology
,
but
that
rating
send
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
Ireland
be
not
a
place
in
which
to
do
business
or
in
which
to
invest
,
but
a
country
where
the
political
and
economic
circumstance
be
such
that
inherent
or
structural
economic
flaw
mean
it
be
not
conducive
to
investment
.
the
reason
for
this
be
that
the
political
and
economic
situation
be
currently
so
negative
that
nobody
want
to
touch
the
country
with
a
barge
pole
.
until
there
be
a
change
of
the
guard
and
the
political
regime
,
we
cannot
hope
to
restore
some
semblance
of
confidence
,
internationally
,
economically
and
politically
.
that
be
the
reason
the
Labour
Party
support
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
government
.
will
the
government
admit
that
over
the
past
decade
the
economy
be
build
on
a
false
edifice
that
have
now
come
tumble
down
like
a
ton
of
brick
?
the
architect
of
this
false
edifice
be
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
.
Ireland
need
to
recover
economically
and
to
recover
faith
in
the
political
system
.
the
people
cast
they
vote
in
the
local
and
European
election
to
send
a
message
to
Fianna
Fáil
that
its
regime
and
day
be
number
.
the
people
have
register
they
disgust
with
the
government
not
only
because
they
feel
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
model
of
governance
have
fail
we
,
but
because
they
now
want
a
change
of
the
guard
.
they
want
to
see
a
restoration
of
a
model
of
governance
that
be
base
on
the
fundamental
principle
of
service
to
all
of
the
people
,
not
just
the
few
.
it
will
take
a
new
political
reality
to
restore
the
notion
of
public
service
.
the
past
ten
year
have
see
the
unhinging
of
economics
from
society
.
my
colleague

Michael
D.
Higgins
,
sum
it
up
when
he
say
the
public

be
reduce
to
the
level
of
spectator
as
the
economy
be
analyse
as
something
separate
from
society
.
it
will
take
a
new
,
centre
of
left
government
to
have
a
new
discourse
and
make
thing
different
.
that
be
the
reason
we
support
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
government
.
we
seek
change
and
to
inject
a
new
positivism
into
the
political
sphere
.
the
government
will
,
probably
,
defeat
we
with
its
motion
,
but
it
be
vital
that
we
in
opposition
lay
down
a
marker
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
vote
in
recent
day
to
get
the
government
out
.
it
be
right
that
that
people
have
they
voice
echo
by
we
on
this
motion
.
the
Labour
Party
leader
,
deputy
Eamon
Gilmore
,
state
yesterday
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
allow
we
economy
to
become
so
reliant
on
the
construction
sector
that
in
2006
one
in
every
four
man
in
the
labour
force
be
work
in
it
.
now
,
almost
one
in
eight
people
in
we
labour
force
be
on
the
dole
,
a
massive
rise
in
unemployment
which
have
ripple
out
of
the
collapse
construction
sector
.
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
at
well
turn
a
blind
eye
,
while
the
bank
and
big
developer
grow
the
property
bubble
to
burst
point
.
the
people
have
pay
for
this
type
of
cynical
politics
.
they
will
no
long
continue
down
this
path
.
they
be
sick
of
the
current
regime
.
it
be
a
ail
and
fail
regime
and
we
must
restore
a
proper
one
.
by
they
action
this
past
weekend
,
the
people
have
send
a
message
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
way
be
no
long
the
way
to
run
a
country
.
that
way
be
no
long
tenable
and
we
can
no
long
afford
it
.
Fianna
Fáil
have
move
to
a
situation
where
it
have
almost
bankrupt
the
country
.
it
can
no
long
be
trust
on
the
economy
.
it
have
not
get
a
clue
.
with
some
€
64
billion
in
deposit
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
,
the
Irish
taxpayer
,
not
the
government
,
be
now
the
lender
of
last
resort
.
that
be
the
regime
create
by
Fianna
Fáil
,
but
it
have
no
shame
about
it
.
it
come
out
day
in
and
out
and
defend
its
position
.
that
in
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
will
no
long
take
responsibility
for
they
action
.
they
will
not
confess
to
the
fact
that
they
could
not
run
the
economy
properly
and
have
run
it
into
the
ground
.
that
have
always
be
the
Fianna
Fáil
way
.
they
be
interested
in
power
for
the
sake
of
power
and
not
in
public
service
or
the
people
.
we
want
a
changing
of
the
guard
so
that
we
can
inject
positivity
into
politics
once
more
,
restore
some
degree
of
what
it
mean
to
be
a
public
servant
and
walk
through
this
hall
with
pride
,
know
the
people
outside
know
we
be
do
something
good
and
perform
a
public
service
.
they
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
.
as
the
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
(
NCSE
)
,
through
local
special
educational
need
organiser
(
SENOs
)
,
be
responsible
for
process
application
from
primary
and
post
primary
school
for
special
educational
need
support
include
application
for
the
establishment
of
special
class
in
various
geographical
area
as
require
.
official
in
my
Department
have
be
in
contact
with
the
NCSE
regard
the
matter
refer
to
by
the
deputy
and
I
understand
that
the
NCSE
have
receive
a
application
for
the
establishment
of
a
special
class
in
the
school
.
the
NCSE
have
advise
that
the
application
will
be
consider
as
quickly
as
possible
and
a
decision
will
be
convey
directly
to
the
school
by
the
NCSE
as
soon
as
this
process
have
be
complete
.
all
school
have
the
name
and
contact
detail
of
they
local
seno
.
Parent
may
also
contact
the
SENO
directly
to
discuss
they
child
's
special
educational
need
,
use
the
contact
detail
available
on
www.ncse.ie.
it
be
vital
that
we
view
this
legislation
in
the
context
of
directive
2009
/
14
/
EC
.
the
change
incorporate
within
this
directive
form
the
basis
of
the
Bill
before
we
.
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
to
mitigate
risk
,
the
risk
face
by
small
depositor
or
work
people
who
rely
heavily
on
the
banking
system
to
assist
they
in
they
daily
life
.
it
be
vital
at
this
time
that
we
insure
depositor
against
a
run
on
a
bank
or
financial
institution
.
therefore
,
the
provision
within
the
Bill
that
increase
the
statutory
limit
from
€
20000
to
€
100000
be
to
be
welcome
and
necessary
,
give
that
a
vast
number
of
depositor
within
a
certain
age
bracket
who
have
contribute
to
the
economy
throughout
they
work
life
would
have
deposit
within
this
range
.
the
fact
that
the
guarantee
scheme
be
to
be
extend
to
include
the
credit
union
be
also
to
be
welcome
.
however
,
I
too
have
question
about
the
credit
union
movement
because
the
minister
state
the
current
level
of
contribution
be
set
at
0.2
%
of
the
prescribe
deposit
base
.
he
go
on
to
say
there
would
be
further
discussion
with
the
credit
union
movement
as
regards
admission
to
the
scheme
from
a
administrative
perspective
.
will
the
minister
,
please
,
tell
the
House
what
the
nature
of
the
discussion
with
the
credit
union
movement
have
be
so
far
?
will
he
inform
we
how
this
will
pan
out
in
practical
term
for
the
credit
union
movement
?
because
of
the
disparate
nature
of
credit
union
,
some
practical
difficulty
will
emerge
and
I
be
sure
they
have
question
about
the
Bill
which
they
will
expect
we
,
as
legislator
,
to
reflect
.
it
be
easy
to
forget
,
too
,
that
a
considerable
amount
of
money
be
hold
within
credit
union
.
it
would
not
be
equitable
,
therefore
,
to
exclude
they
from
the
ambit
of
the
Bill
.
the
current
economic
environment
be
uncertain
.
thankfully
,
thus
far
we
have
not
see
a
stampede
by
ordinary
depositor
to
extract
they
savings
from
financial
institution
.
we
must
guard
against
this
possibility
as
the
last
thing
the
State
need
be
a
run
on
the
banking
system
.
it
be
vital
,
therefore
,
that
a
measure
of
guarantee
be
provide
by
the
State
so
as
to
ensure
ordinary
people
who
be
normally
casualty
in
any
downturn
do
not
stop
put
money
into
the
bank
.
by
increase
the
deposit
protection
limit
from
€
20000
to
€
100000
we
be
at
least
ensure
individual
savings
will
not
be
split
disproportionately
between
a
wide
range
of
institution
.
liquidity
must
be
preserve
within
the
system
.
the
only
way
to
do
this
be
to
ensure
there
be
sufficient
money
on
deposit
.
on
the
matter
of
moral
hazard
,
the
movement
of
responsibility
for
this
area
from
the
Financial
Regulator
to
the
Central
Bank
have
to
be
explain
in
great
detail
.
I
have
certain
reservation
about
the
role
of
the
Central
Bank
in
the
last
12
month
in
oversee
the
banking
crisis
.
I
remain
to
be
convince
that
its
warning
,
issue
in
quarterly
report
,
be
adequately
articulate
.
perhaps
it
be
the
case
that
it
be
just
not
be
listen
to
,
or
perhaps
it
be
not
shouting
loudly
enough
about
what
be
go
on
.
some
,
more
cynically
minded
,
might
suggest
there
be
a
air
of
complicity
in
term
of
what
be
happen
throughout
the
economy
for
a
number
of
year
.
the
Central
Bank
,
with
the
Financial
Regulator
,
have
be
diminish
in
its
role
in
oversee
the
banking
structure
.
however
,
I
be
hopeful
the
minister
will
ensure
they
role
in
the
future
will
involve
vigorous
policing
of
the
scheme
once
it
come
into
being
.
I
refer
to
the
take
into
public
ownership
of
Eircom
.
it
be
report
in
the
newspaper
at
the
weekend
that
yet
another
private
equity
firm
,
Permira
,
have
express
a
interest
in
take
over
Eircom
.
the
other
be
CVC
Capital
Partners
Limited
and
STT
.
the
ask
price
for
Eircom
be
approximately
€
100
million
but
the
debt
mountain
be
in
the
region
of
€
3.8
billion
.
if
a
private
equity
firm
take
over
Eircom
lock
,
stock
and
barrel
,
I
be
not
convinced
we
will
see
a
increase
rate
of
broadband
penetration
in
this
country
.
I
be
not
convinced
this
would
be
the
most
effective
way
of
ensure
the
broadband
provision
and
capacity
require
in
order
to
make
this
country
competitive
with
regard
to
rate
available
in
Japan
.
a
private
equity
firm
will
not
ensure
the
rate
of
penetration
will
allow
we
to
compete
with
other
country
.
they
would
concentrate
on
the
most
profitable
area
and
would
not
ensure
the
rural
economy
or
society
would
be
serve
in
such
a
scenario
.
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
take
Eircom
into
public
ownership
to
ensure
there
be
another
suitable
platform
for
investment
in
broadband
.
if
we
be
to
bail
out
bank
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
will
not
enter
the
fray
and
take
Eircom
in
charge
to
ensure
all
rural
exchange
that
need
to
be
upgrade
be
upgrade
.
there
would
be
a
multiplier
effect
and
a
positive
net
benefit
to
the
rural
economy
.
it
would
ensure
some
income
be
derive
from
other
user
through
the
unbundling
of
the
local
loop
.
it
be
important
to
debate
this
.
it
be
not
right
to
hand
it
over
to
private
equity
firm
.
the
current
taxation
regime
have
include
increase
to
taxation
and
some
will
argue
they
be
necessary
.
as
a
short
,
sharp
solution
we
be
increase
taxation
on
income
and
that
be
also
stifling
the
economy
because
people
be
not
spend
.
be
we
not
concentrate
on
ensure
great
efficiency
in
public
expenditure
?
today
I
receive
the
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
on
the
amount
spend
by
the
HSE
on
legal
fee
between
2006
and
2009
,
inclusive
.
the
response
be
that
,
between
barrister
and
solicitor
bill
,
approximately
€
8.6
million
have
be
spend
in
legal
fee
by
the
HSE
to
date
.
the
reason
I
be
prompt
to
put
down
the
question
be
because
of
a
young
couple
who
have
to
send
a
child
to
hospital
and
think
they
be
cover
under
private
health
insurance
.
it
transpire
that
they
be
not
cover
and
they
be
pursue
vigorously
for
€
5000
.
I
would
hazard
a
guess
that
it
probably
cost
the
State
a
multiple
of
that
€
5000
to
pursue
the
family
for
that
cost
.
the
point
be
that
there
must
be
a
great
analysis
of
how
we
can
achieve
great
savings
without
adversely
affect
people
on
low
income
.
it
can
be
achieve
with
a
little
lateral
thinking
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
280
to
282
,
inclusive
,
together
.
the
number
of
school
project
at

and

time
available
to
answer
this
question
it
be
not
possible
to
compile

verify

information

2007
.
the
proportion
of
the
2009
capital
allocation
which
will
be
expend
on

will
depend
on
the
progress

in
yesterday
's
edition
of
the
Irish
Examiner
,
the
Limerick
State
solicitor
welcome
the
provision
of
the
criminal
justice
(
amendment
)
Bill
but
say
that
it
would
face
difficulty
.
when
ask
whether
the
new
law
represent
a
good
day
's
work
,
he
reply
:
it
remain
to
be
see
,
but
it
be
a
attempt
to
address
a
very
serious
problem
.
and
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
challenge
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
there
will
be
difficulty
ahead
for
this
legislation
.
but
something
have
...
to
be
do
and
we
just
can't
roll
over
and
let
this
people
take
over
we
city
and
we
country
.
he
go
on
to
state
"
the
contract
be
be
rewritten
by
the
State
on
its
term
,
and
I
think
rightly
so
"
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
sentiment
express
by
the
State
solicitor
and
everyone
want
this
matter
to
be
deal
with
.
the
Labour
Party
differ
on
this
legislation
,
not
on
the
sentiment
regard
the
need
to
tackle
organised
crime
,
but
on
whether
the
proposal
before
the
House
present
a
solution
to
get
society
out
of
the
morass
in
which
it
find
itself
.
one
's
natural
instinct
be
to
ensure
that
every
innocent
victim
will
get
justice
.
one
's
human
instinct
be
that
the
only
way
to
handle
this
criminal
be
with
a
short
,
sharp
shock
.
the
question
remain
,
however
,
of
whether
the
proposal
before
we
will
result
in
a
crack
down
on
organised
crime
or
in
legal
challenge
to
the
legislation
on
a
number
of
front
.
that
question
be
not
ideological
,
it
be
practical
.
will
this
legislation
assist
in
the
pursuit
of
criminal
in
Limerick
and
west
Dublin
or
will
it
be
challenge
by
they
legal
representative
at
every
turn
?
be
we
make
good
law
or
law
that
will
be
challenge
due
to
loophole
?
in
the
criminal
Justice
Act
2006
,
there
be
already
a
considerable
body
of
law
that
should
adequately
deal
with
organised
crime
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
government
be
hell
-
bend
on
swamp
we
with
more
law
,
common
sense
must
prevail
.
we
all
want
to
see
this
criminal
behind
bar
,
and
no
one
in
this
House
would
advocate
a
soft
approach
that
would
not
see
the
blight
of
organised
criminal
activity
wipe
out
once
and
for
all
,
but
we
differ
on
how
this
can
well
be
achieve
.
it
can
not
be
achieve
only
through
increase
legislation
,
the
dog
in
the
street
will
tell
the
minister
that
the
shortage
of
resource
for
the
gardaí
at
the
coalface
be
the
most
significant
impediment
to
progress
in
bring
criminal
to
trial
.
the
idea
that
we
apply
more
legislation
without
a
comprehensive
spend
on
overtime
,
surveillance
and
other
enable
mechanism
that
would
allow
gardaí
to
get
on
with
the
job
raise
serious
question
about
this
government
's
strategy
to
tackle
gangland
crime
.
if
common
sense
be
use
,
the
gardaí
would
have
all
of
the
necessary
intelligence
gathering
and
surveillance
mechanism
at
they
disposal
to
hinder
any
attempt
at
a
crime
.
the
fact
remain
that
the
cutting
of
overtime
for
gardaí
and
the
likelihood
that
there
will
be
a
massive
cull
of
more
experience
gardaí
near
the
end
of
they
tenure
due
to
the
possible
taxation
of
pension
lump
sum
will
further
exacerbate
the
situation
.
we
can
have
all
the
law
we
want
but
if
the
experience
do
not
exist
in
the
Garda
Síochána
to
break
down
this
criminal
element
,
it
be
all
for
nothing
.
law
such
as
that
propose
today
will
matter
not
one
jot
if
the
resource
to
match
be
not
in
place
.
the
first
thing
that
strike
I
be
that
there
have
be
very
little
change
to
the
definition
of
a
criminal
organisation
from
the
2006
act
except
to
include
a
requirement
that
two
of
the
gang
can
be
involve
with
a
view
to
act
in
concert
in
the
commission
of
a
offence
.
have
anyone
be
convict
under
section
72
of
the
2006
act
that
make
it
a
offence
for
a
person
to
participate
in
or
contribute
to
any
activity
of
such
a
organisation
?
it
be
a
distraction
to
introduce
a
new
offence
under
section
71
(
a
)
of
direct
the
activity
of
a
criminal
organisation
if
it
have
not
be
possible
to
prove
that
a
person
be
a
member
of
a
gang
.
to
introduce
a
provision
to
establish
the
requisite
intent
be
a
gimmick
.
the
new
section
72
(
6
)
provide
that
it
shall
be
presume
,
until
the
contrary
be
show
,
that
participation
or
contribution
be
make
with
the
requisite
state
of
mind
if
the
circumstance
under
which
the
relevant
act
be
commit
involve
the
possession
by
the
defendant
in
the
presence
of
one
or
more
other
person
of
a
balaclava
,
boiler
suit
or
other
means
of
disguise
.
I
hope
the
plumber
and
handyman
of
the
country
know
that
wear
a
boiler
suit
be
now
proof
of
requisite
criminal
intent
of
membership
of
a
criminal
organisation
.
the
minister
have
argue
this
legislation
be
necessary
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
.
instead
,
by
introduce
a
system
whereby
instead
of
seek
out
evidence
and
put
it
before
a
jury
,
a
garda
's
opinion
will
suffice
to
convict
and
this
can
be
do
before
a
court
sit
without
a
jury
.
grant
,
this
be
not
the
first
time
the
opinion
of
a
garda
have
be
use
to
replace
the
obligation
to
obtain
evidence
and
allow
a
court
to
decide
on
guilt
,
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1972
provide
that
in
prosecution
for
membership
of
a
paramilitary
organisation
,
the
evidence
of
a
chief
superintendent
as
to
that
membership
could
be
admissible
.
at
least
the
fact
that
only
a
very
senior
garda
could
give
such
evidence
give
a
indication
of
the
seriousness
of
the
matter
.
now
,
however
,
a
prosecution
can
rest
on
the
opinion
of
any
garda
who
have
the
appropriate
expertise
.
this
be
a
meaningless
criterion
because
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
a
court
refuse
to
hear
the
opinion
evidence
of
a
train
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
do
not
know
enough
about
gang
.
the
garda
's
opinion
can
be
base
on
the
fact
that
the
individual
in
question
have
previous
conviction
.
again
,
the
minister
have
already
ask
we
to
support
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
,
which
will
allow
gardaí
to
plant
listening
device
where
there
be
a
suspicion
of
any
arrestable
offence
.
I
have
no
issue
with
this
.
the
state
purpose
of
that
legislation
be
to
obtain
evidence
with
which
to
pursue
gangland
crime
but
now
we
find
we
be
not
even
go
to
rely
on
such
evidence
and
instead
all
we
will
require
be
the
opinion
of
a
garda
.
the
minister
state
that
such
evidence
will
not
go
to
the
guilt
of
the
person
in
question
but
there
must
be
a
further
clarification
on
that
point
.
section
71
onwards
deal
with
the
special
criminal
Court
,
the
main
issue
here
.
if
the
perceive
problem
be
that
witness
be
afraid
to
give
evidence
,
and
we
distinguish
between
witness
and
that
who
be
member
of
a
jury
,
surely
the
minister
should
be
look
at
great
support
for
witness
?
any
Bill
that
state
that
"
it
be
hereby
declare
that
the
ordinary
court
be
inadequate
to
secure
the
effective
administration
of
justice
and
the
preservation
of
public
peace
and
order
in
relation
to
a
offence
under
each
of
the
follow
provision
"
convey
the
impression
that
the
current
legal
remedy
be
inadequate
and
must
be
overhaul
.
be
we
in
a
de
facto
state
of
emergency
?
the
minister
in
this
legislation
expressly
state
that
the
ordinary
court
be
inadequate
to
deal
with
criminal
organisation
.
that
be
a
serious
contention
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
common
law
system
and
must
be
further
analyse
.
no
evidence
have
be
present
to
demonstrate
why
the
current
operation
of
the
court
be
inadequate
.
the
provision
in
section
8
amend
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1939
to
allow
certain
offence
to
be
try
at
the
non-jury
special
criminal
Court
,
include
the
offence
of
direct
a
criminal
organisation
,
participation
in
or
contribution
to
certain
activity
,
and
the
commission
of
a
offence
for
a
criminal
organisation
.
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
special
criminal
Court
in
that
context
and
its
power
have
be
extend
in
this
regard
.
the
protection
of
jury
member
and
witness
have
be
suggest
as
the
reason
for
extend
the
remit
of
the
special
criminal
Court
.
however
,
as
recently
as
last
month
,
speak
at
the
annual
prosecutor
's
conference
,
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
raise
a
important
point
about
the
participation
of
the
ordinary
citizen
in
the
criminal
justice
system
through
service
on
jury
.
this
,
he
say
,
"
import
a
degree
of
democratic
legitimacy
into
the
system
"
.
this
be
a
point
that
be
worth
bear
in
mind
.
one
can
infer
from
this
statement
that
it
be
in
question
whether
the
reality
of
the
dpp
refer
a
case
to
the
special
criminal
Court
will
actually
play
out
,
give
the
potential
doubt
as
to
whether
this
legislation
will
stand
on
its
own
two
foot
and
withstand
any
legal
challenge
down
the
line
.
the
issue
of
witness
intimidation
will
not
be
solve
simply
by
the
use
of
the
special
criminal
Court
,
as
witness
will
still
need
to
give
evidence
in
court
.
the
common
sense
point
of
view
be
that
witness
protection
should
be
deal
with
by
instigate
measure
design
to
protect
witness
's
identity
,
if
necessary
,
in
addition
to
Garda
protection
operation
.
this
be
a
more
rational
approach
.
the
decision
on
whether
to
prosecute
a
case
in
the
special
criminal
Court
come
down
to
one
law
officer
,
the
dpp
.
the
existence
of
total
discretion
on
he
or
she
part
as
to
whether
to
prosecute
and
to
prosecute
in
the
special
criminal
Court
or
otherwise
be
a
significant
power
and
must
be
exercise
with
great
caution
.
perhaps
the
Bill
could
be
amend
to
put
this
power
on
a
statutory
footing
.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
approach
.
could
we
not
instead
enact
a
provision
within
that
section
along
the
line
of
the
UK
practice
whereby
the
prosecution
may
apply
for
a
non-jury
trial
in
case
in
which
it
can
show
evidence
of
a
real
danger
of
jury
tampering
?
this
would
ensure
a
robust
response
where
there
be
proof
of
jury
tampering
.
the
question
for
this
legislature
be
whether
the
provision
be
a
new
departure
from
the
norm
compare
to
other
common
law
jurisdiction
.
at
what
point
should
we
depart
from
a
principle
enshrine
in
we
constitution
for
the
pursuance
of
a
goal
that
can
be
achieve
by
means
other
than
fundamentally
change
the
basis
of
a
criminal
trial
,
namely
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
?
the
minister
should
think
long
and
hard
about
this
provision
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
provision
contain
within
exist
legislation
should
be
adequate
to
deal
with
the
fundamental
premise
of
this
Bill
;
namely
,
the
eradication
of
organised
crime
.
there
be
some
presumption
that
the
new
provision
be
base
on
the
threat
pose
by
criminal
gang
.
it
convey
a
impression
that
the
people
engage
in
such
criminal
activity
possess
a
malevolent
influence
that
be
beyond
the
power
of
normal
court
procedure
to
pursue
.
I
do
not
buy
into
this
.
it
presume
that
we
in
this
house
—
representative
of
the
people
—
no
long
have
the
confidence
to
curb
criminal
activity
within
the
normal
legal
parameter
and
must
embark
on
some
pretence
at
emergency
provision
to
placate
certain
viewpoint
.
we
have
develop
a
new
language
and
rhetoric
with
regard
to
organised
crime
and
it
need
to
be
deconstruct
.
this
people
be
mere
individual
.
they
do
not
live
in
location
that
be
beyond
the
power
of
surveillance
.
the
high
Chaparral
in
Limerick
be
not
a
remote
location
.
person
can
be
photograph
and
track
and
they
movement
can
be
trace
.
they
be
not
possess
of
special
power
and
the
exist
judicial
system
and
corpus
of
law
,
couple
with
the
provision
of
adequate
Garda
resource
,
should
be
robust
enough
to
bring
they
to
justice
.
I
wonder
whether
term
such
as
"
organised
crime
"
would
ever
have
creep
into
we
lexicon
and
would
need
to
be
legislate
for
if
the
State
have
provide
adequate
funding
for
Garda
operation
such
as
Anvil
,
which
allow
the
development
of
surveillance
and
checkpoint
and
act
as
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
criminal
.
the
ability
of
the
Garda
to
tackle
crime
be
severely
hamper
by
a
cut
in
Garda
overtime
from
approximately
€
120
million
last
year
to
€
80
million
this
year
.
a
total
of
€
21
million
have
be
set
aside
this
year
for
Operation
Anvil
,
yet
the
State
be
spend
approximately
€
12
million
on
policing
north
Mayo
.
do
the
minister
not
see
a
inherent
contradiction
in
he
own
policy
in
this
regard
?
I
doubt
if
one
extra
gangland
boss
or
minion
will
be
bring
to
justice
as
a
result
of
the
measure
contain
within
the
Bill
.
we
do
not
argue
against
any
provision
that
address
the
increase
level
of
violence
and
intimidation
direct
at
witness
and
jury
,
or
the
use
of
the
special
criminal
Court
for
the
hearing
of
particular
organised
crime
offence
,
but
I
would
like
to
see
some
proof
of
the
fact
that
jury
be
systematically
be
intimidate
.
do
it
really
happen
?
it
be
one
thing
to
suggest
that
witness
be
be
intimidate
,
but
the
suggestion
that
jury
be
be
systematically
intimidate
and
that
this
require
a
seismic
shift
away
from
trial
by
jury
should
not
be
entertain
without
further
analysis
.
that
a
country
of
this
size
,
which
be
not
densely
populate
,
must
resort
to
such
measure
suggest
that
the
successful
tackle
of
crime
should
be
predicate
on
the
application
of
resource
and
not
necessarily
on
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law
.
if
there
be
proof
beyond
doubt
that
jury
be
be
tamper
with
and
intimidate
,
there
be
protective
instrument
that
can
be
apply
which
be
practical
and
base
on
a
common
sense
approach
.
this
be
well
document
.
under
section
7
of
the
Bill
,
the
opinion
of
any
garda
who
appear
to
the
court
to
possess
the
appropriate
expertise
will
be
admissible
as
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
criminal
organisation
.
under
this
section
,
expertise
mean
experience
,
specialise
knowledge
or
qualification
.
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
draft
a
paper
prior
to
the
instigation
of
this
legislation
from
which
I
will
quote
.
I
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
all
the
view
espouse
by
the
various
civil
society
organisation
and
I
have
my
own
view
about
the
rule
of
law
.
however
,
there
be
certain
point
of
law
address
by
the
ICCL
which
should
be
read
into
the
record
.
it
point
out
that
the
opinion
of
the
garda
can
be
inform
by
the
existence
of
previous
conviction
of
the
accuse
.
the
Supreme
Court
have
consider
the
use
of
belief
evidence
and
its
compatibility
with
article
38
of
the
constitution
and
article
6
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
,
which
deal
with
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
.
while
a
garda
may
claim
privilege
as
to
he
or
she
source
when
be
cross-examine
about
belief
evidence
,
the
Supreme
Court
be
clear
that
a
conviction
cannot
take
place
without
supportive
or
corroborative
evidence
in
recognition
of
the
disadvantage
that
accrue
to
the
defence
in
a
trial
.
moreover
,
in
regard
to
the
rank
of
garda
who
be
entitle
to
provide
belief
evidence
,
the
court
have
state
that
the
relevant
provision
of
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
1939
be
carefully
craft
to
ensure
belief
evidence
must
come
from
a
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
not
below
the
rank
of
chief
superintendent
.
this
,
the
Supreme
Court
state
,
be
with
a
view
to
establish
trust
and
credibility
as
far
as
possible
.
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
regard
to
the
provision
contain
within
this
Bill
.
the
UN
human
rights
committee
have
refer
to
decision
of
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
in
assign
case
to
the
court
not
be
make
public
.
to
confer
further
power
on
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecution
for
the
hearing
of
particular
organised
crime
offence
in
the
special
criminal
Court
on
the
basis
of
he
or
she
total
discretion
beg
the
question
as
to
whether
the
application
of
increase
Garda
resource
might
be
a
more
reasonable
solution
to
the
problem
which
would
negate
the
need
for
this
provision
.
on
the
matter
of
secret
detention
hearing
,
under
part
4
of
the
Bill
,
procedure
of
District
Court
detention
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
extend
the
detention
of
person
under
the
Offences
against
the
State
Act
be
alter
.
one
legal
opinion
suggest
it
be
contrary
to
the
principle
of
fair
trial
that
the
Bill
allow
for
the
hearing
to
take
place
in
private
if
the
judge
consider
there
may
be
a
risk
of
prejudice
.
in
justify
this
,
it
be
claim
that
member
of
organised
criminal
gang
be
attend
the
detention
hearing
and
decipher
the
direction
of
the
investigation
from
the
evidence
give
in
court
.
however
,
this
provision
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
criminal
justice
in
this
State
,
allow
for
the
judge
to
hear
evidence
from
a
garda
of
any
rank
,
in
private
and
without
legal
representation
.
this
include
answer
to
question
and
a
cross-examination
without
either
the
defendant
,
he
or
she
legal
representative
or
the
prosecutor
present
.
in
essence
,
this
mean
a
person
can
be
hold
without
knowledge
of
the
grounds
on
which
the
judge
be
justify
he
or
she
continue
detention
.
that
detention
can
be
justify
by
secret
information
from
any
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
,
irrespective
of
he
or
she
expertise
or
experience
.
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we
be
convinced
of
the
necessity
for
such
provision
,
the
reality
be
that
any
criminal
lawyer
worth
he
or
she
salt
will
most
likely
be
able
to
identify
any
number
of
potential
loophole
and
,
thus
,
the
prospect
of
a
legal
challenge
.
we
must
also
look
at
we
obligation
under
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
even
where
we
be
seek
to
make
provision
for
heinous
crime
such
as
murder
,
we
obligation
under
the
convention
remain
clear
.
we
must
avoid
a
situation
where
a
person
detain
on
a
murder
charge
ultimately
walk
free
as
a
consequence
of
a
challenge
to
this
law
under
a
article
40
provision
.
it
do
not
matter
whether
or
not
we
be
in
favour
of
waive
article
40
rights
in
emergency
situation
.
my
point
be
that
we
must
avoid
make
bad
law
or
law
that
will
be
discover
by
a
good
criminal
lawyer
to
have
all
type
of
loophole
.
that
be
how
the
State
have
typically
deal
with
issue
relate
to
criminality
heretofore
.
criminal
lawyer
have
always
be
able
to
find
loophole
that
have
allow
people
to
walk
free
in
certain
circumstance
.
if
we
be
to
tackle
this
problem
once
and
for
all
,
we
must
make
robust
and
effective
law
that
will
not
be
subject
to
future
challenge
at
a
supranational
court
,
as
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
observe
.
we
intend
to
propose
several
amendment
to
the
Bill
on
Committee
stage
.
practical
change
can
be
make
that
will
not
alter
the
minister
's
modus
operandi
in
seek
to
tackle
organised
crime
.
in
particular
,
we
must
ensure
there
be
protection
for
witness
and
that
jury
tampering
do
not
take
place
.
I
understand
the
court
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
have
find
that
the
state
be
oblige
to
take
particular
step
to
protect
certain
vulnerable
category
of
people
such
as
witness
.
we
be
not
so
naive
as
to
suggest
there
be
a
onus
on
the
State
to
prevent
every
possibility
of
violence
,
but
where
individual
be
expose
to
threat
to
they
life
,
the
State
will
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
be
oblige
to
provide
police
protection
.
in
order
to
fulfil
this
obligation
,
we
must
ensure
effective
measure
be
take
to
thwart
attempt
to
trace
witness
and
collaborator
of
justice
by
criminal
organisation
.
several
procedure
can
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
jury
be
not
tamper
with
and
that
witness
be
afford
adequate
protection
.
this
must
be
bring
forward
as
practical
measure
in
line
with
the
implementation
of
this
legislation
.
any
procedural
rule
that
be
enact
to
protect
the
rights
of
witness
must
be
formulate
take
into
account
the
need
to
safeguard
the
criminal
trial
process
.
measure
which
could
be
make
available
to
assist
witness
include
anonymity
before
,
during
and
after
the
criminal
trial
.
however
,
this
should
be
a
exceptional
measure
and
should
be
set
down
in
law
so
that
procedure
be
available
for
the
defence
to
challenge
the
need
for
anonymity
.
a
cause
of
concern
in
the
criminal
justice
system
be
the
considerable
delay
in
court
proceedings
in
the
State
.
if
court
proceedings
could
be
expedite
in
a
timely
fashion
,
this
would
offset
the
risk
of
any
potential
tampering
with
jury
.
we
should
not
set
about
fundamentally
change
we
common
law
system
when
we
could
instead
tackle
criminal
with
robust
measure
through
adequately
fund
and
effective
policing
mechanism
.
while
we
agree
with
the
tenor
of
the
Bill
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
achieve
,
we
be
of
the
view
that
it
require
amendment
.
no
.
it
be
not
what
I
say
.
I
could
clarify
it
for
the
Minister
of
State
.
the
special
criminal
Court
can
be
use
under
the
exist
framework
.
how
will
witness
be
deal
with
in
the
special
criminal
Court
?
if
we
need
to
sit
every
day
of
July
and
right
through
the
summer
we
should
do
that
.
the
reality
be
that
the
minister
have
outline
a
timetable
.
I
wish
to
conclude
because
I
be
take
the
indulgence
of
the
chair
.
it
would
be
wrong
if
I
,
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
European
affair
,
do
not
make
a
few
comment
on
the
importance
of
Europe
to
we
and
where
we
be
.
in
12
or
13
week
we
will
face
another
referendum
.
it
be
more
critical
than
any
decision
we
make
in
any
previous
referendum
other
than
the
decision
the
people
make
to
jump
into
the
dark
and
join
the
European
economic
Community
in
1972
.
if
there
be
ever
a
time
when
Europe
need
to
be
strong
and
focus
,
this
be
that
time
.
the
world
face
remarkable
challenge
and
not
just
the
economic
challenge
or
global
warming
.
late
this
year
Europe
will
face
a
major
energy
crisis
.
we
need
a
strong
Europe
that
be
fit
for
purpose
.
the

people
in

of
the
500

be
the

the

I
do
not
know
why
and
what
failure
on
we
part
encourage
the
people
to
be
timorous
on
12
June
2008

it
be
temerity
ally
to
considerable
misleading

that
force

about

a

,
do
not
make
a
few
comment
on
the
importance
of
Europe
to
we
and
where
we
be
.
in
12
or
13
week
we
will
face
another
referendum
.
it
be
more
critical
than
any
decision
we
make
in
any
previous
referendum
other
than
the
decision
the
people
make
to
jump
into
the
dark
and
join
the
European
economic
Community
in
1972
.
if
there
be
ever
a
time
when
Europe
need
to
be
strong
and
focus
,
this
be
that
time
.
the
world
face
remarkable
challenge
and
not
just
the
economic
challenge
or
global
warming
.
late
this
year
Europe
will
face
a
major
energy
crisis
.
we
need
a
strong
Europe
that
be
fit
for
purpose
.
the
only
people
in
Europe
of
the
500
million
citizen
that
can
make
Europe
strong
now
be
the
Irish
people
.
the
Irish
people
have
show
great
perspicacity
and
extraordinary
courage
in
the
past
in
take
decision
.
I
do
not
know
why
and
what
failure
on
we
part
encourage
the
people
to
be
timorous
on
12
June
2008
.
it
be
temerity
ally
to
considerable
misleading
propaganda
that
force
people
to
say
they
do
not
know
enough
about
Europe
.
we
have
a
combine
responsibility
.
we
all
make
mistake
during
the
last
referendum
campaign
.
there
be
snip
on
different
side
in
this
House
and
we
be
all
culpable
.
on
this
occasion
we
really
must
work
together
.
it
will
not
be
easy
to
get
it
over
the
line
and
it
should
not
be
take
for
grant
.
we
should
never
take
the
people
for
grant
.
a
honest
effort
to
address
the
concern
of
the
people
be
make
.
that
concern
be
really
well
recognise
by
a
committee
of
both
house
.
we
should
now
have
the
courage
to
lead
.
we
be
elect
not
just
to
be
follower
but
also
to
lead
and
to
make
certain
the
people
take
a
decision
that
be
inform
,
focus
and
right
.
they
will
do
that
by
voting
"
yes
"
.
I
will
say
goodnight
at
that
.
I
already
make
a
contribution
to
the
debate
on
the
Bill
on
second
Stage
and
,
therefore
,
I
will
speak
specifically
to
section
3
.
the
minister
indicate
that
the
amend
definition
be
merely
a
simple
formulation
but
that
they
will
nonetheless
make
it
easy
to
charge
person
with
the
offence
in
question
.
the
Bill
do
not
substantially
change
the
definition
of
what
constitute
a
criminal
organisation
which
be
contain
in
the
2006
Act
.
if
it
be
never
deem
practicable
to
bring
the
2006
definition
into
play
and
if
no
conviction
be
secure
on
the
basis
of
it
,
we
must
ask
whether
conviction
can
be
secure
on
the
basis
of
that
which
be
contain
in
the
legislation
before
the
House
.
be
there
a
requirement
that
sufficient
evidence
to
be
provide
to
allow
a
judge
,
of
the
special
criminal
Court
or
any
other
court
,
to
decide
to
convict
someone
on
the
basis
of
he
or
she
membership
of
a
organisation
?
this
be
particularly
relevant
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
provision
in
the
2006
act
have
not
be
implement
.
further
consideration
must
be
give
to
this
matter
.
I
be
of
the
view
that
section
3
be
not
practical
.
it
be
so
vague
that
if
one
be
a
criminal
lawyer
of
some
standing
,
one
could
pick
hole
in
it
.
on
a
point
of
clarification
,
the
minister
have
state
that
the
evidence
of
a
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
with
the
appropriate
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
a
criminal
organisation
will
not
go
to
the
guilt
or
otherwise
of
the
defendant
.
be
that
not
a
point
of
law
that
be
already
well
establish
?
this
legislation
do
not
give
a
new
voice
to
it
because
it
be
a
establish
principle
.
what
do
"
sufficiently
positive
"
mean
?
the
minister
have
to
give
he
that
one
.
I
question
the
criterion
by
which
appropriate
expertise
can
be
define
.
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
a
court
refuse
to
hear
the
evidence
of
a
train
garda
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
do
not
know
enough
about
gang
.
I
be
prompt
to
raise
this
issue
in
response
to
call
to
my
office
and
to
deputy
Brian
O'Shea
's
office
with
regard
to
the
probable
cessation
of
the
rural
bus
service
between
Waterford
and
Cork
.
this
be
a
service
which
specifically
serve
the
town
of
Dungarvan
,
Cappoquin
,
Lismore
,
Curraglass
,
Ballynoe
,
Conna
,
Castlelyons
,
Fermoy
,
Castletownroche
,
Killavullen
and
Mallow
.
there
be
a
concern
that
if
the
mid-day
service
which
be
provide
by
Bus
Éireann
be
stop
,
because
in
the
company
's
word
it
be
deem
to
be
"
not
profitable
"
,
this
will
have
a
untold
consequence
for
that
people
who
be
old
,
who
do
not
have
they
own
transport
and
who
would
normally
use
this
service
to
access
general
day
to
day
service
such
as
medical
,
post
office
and
other
service
that
generally
keep
life
and
limb
together
.
I
be
concerned
because
if
it
be
the
case
that
Bus
Éireann
decide
to
terminate
this
service
,
then
in
the
current
economic
climate
,
there
be
no
guarantee
that
the
rural
transport
programme
would
be
sufficiently
fund
to
replace
the
route
and
provide
the
service
to
what
I
would
call
a
vulnerable
section
or
we
society
who
do
not
have
the
means
to
provide
they
own
transport
and
be
not
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
get
taxi
if
they
be
live
in
rural
area
to
the
town
I
have
mention
.
we
see
in
1967
that
the
railway
line
between
Mallow
and
Dungarvan
or
Cork
and
Waterford
through
Mallow
be
stop
and
it
be
replace
by
a
bus
service
.
I
be
argue
now
,
along
with
my
colleague
,
deputy
O'Shea
,
that
there
would
be
a
public
service
obligation
to
ensure
that
that
people
would
continue
to
be
serve
by
some
form
of
public
transport
and
ideally
through
the
auspices
of
Bus
Éireann
.
it
be
my
view
that
if
we
be
to
go
down
the
line
in
this
country
of
stop
route
which
be
deem
to
be
not
profitable
,
then
it
will
be
another
nail
in
the
coffin
for
rural
society
.
at
a
time
when
we
be
talk
about
the
sustainability
of
the
rural
economy
and
rural
society
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
we
would
ensure
that
Bus
Éireann
and
other
provider
would
continue
to
have
some
obligation
to
provide
service
,
particularly
during
the
week
when
it
be
predominantly
elderly
people
who
avail
of
this
service
.
it
be
not
only
so
that
they
can
go
into
town
to
purchase
grocery
but
it
be
also
a
form
of
social
interaction
for
they
they
may
not
otherwise
have
without
the
service
.
if
government
policy
be
one
that
assure
that
rural
transport
would
be
well
cater
for
,
particularly
in
more
isolated
area
,
and
if
it
be
the
case
that
government
policy
be
such
that
there
be
a
service
in
existence
,
I
call
on
the
minister
to
ensure
that
the
service
be
maintain
,
preferably
by
Bus
Éireann
,
but
if
not
,
that
the
minister
would
intervene
directly
with
Bus
Éireann
to
ensure
that
it
be
maintain
.
that
will
ensure
that
if
we
get
rid
of
the
railway
we
do
not
also
get
rid
of
the
rural
bus
route
.
person
use
this
service
and
it
be
vital
that
they
have
access
to
the
service
that
maintain
they
in
they
everyday
life
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
intervene
directly
with
Bus
Éireann
on
this
issue
and
ensure
we
maintain
that
service
and
other
such
service
that
be
be
threaten
.
Bus
Éireann
be
undergo
a
process
of
review
its
route
and
that
deem
to
be
not
profitable
could
cease
in
the
future
.
that
would
be
a
bad
day
for
rural
society
and
the
rural
economy
in
particular
.

we
look
forward
to
that
enlightenment
.
the
date
2
October
2009
will
be
a
seminal
moment
in
we
relationship
with
the
European
Union
.
if
we
pass
the
Lisbon
treaty
,
we
will
say
to
we
EU
neighbour
that
we
be
on
board
and
intend
to
proceed
in
partnership
with
they
.
by
pass
it
,
we
will
say
to
we
EU
partner
that
we
want
to
see
the
establishment
of
area
of
co-operation
or
share
competence
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
internal
market
,
energy
and
economic
and
social
cohesion
.
this
be
the
area
on
which
we
must
focus
if
we
be
to
be
assist
in
put
we
economy
back
together
and
get
people
back
to
work
.
without
this
area
of
co-operation
,
we
will
be
force
to
proceed
alone
.
we
cannot
afford
such
a
policy
.
we
rely
,
from
this
juncture
,
on
we
EU
partner
to
assist
we
in
get
back
on
track
.
this
provision
be
build
into
the
treaty
and
if
we
reject
it
for
a
second
time
,
any
assistance
to
be
garner
from
we
EU
partner
will
be
nullify
.
we
be
a
shrewd
people
and
have
build
we
country
on
the
management
of
relationship
,
either
socially
,
politically
or
from
a
business
perspective
.
adopt
the
treaty
will
assist
that
relationship
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
foreign
direct
investment
and
EU
research
programme
,
two
area
that
be
vital
to
we
economic
growth
and
which
be
encompass
by
the
treaty
.
I
hope
we
can
continue
to
play
a
qualitative
role
as
a
member
of
the
European
Union
in
this
regard
and
that
we
can
continue
what
have
be
a
long
and
fruitful
relationship
.
I
be
grateful
for
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
because
mine
be
the
generation
that
have
benefit
most
therefrom
.
membership
of
the
Union
and
protection
of
we
national
interest
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
in
spite
of
the
economic
constraint
upon
we
now
,
it
will
be
through
a
deepen
relationship
with
we
EU
partner
that
we
will
restore
we
economic
vitality
.
at
the
EU
foreign
Minister
meeting
hold
after
the
last
referendum
,
we
Minister
for
foreign
affair
speak
on
the
diverse
nature
of
the
Irish
debate
and
the
overlap
in
that
debate
between
issue
that
be
relevant
to
the
treaty
and
other
that
be
not
.
some
of
that
extraneous
issue
,
which
have
no
part
in
the
debate
on
treaty
revision
,
have
now
be
put
to
bed
.
the
guarantee
be
secure
and
we
should
acknowledge
that
.
we
national
interest
be
a
strong
Ireland
within
a
strong
European
Union
and
one
that
be
concerned
with
job
,
family
and
social
solidarity
.
the
Union
consist
of
27
country
and
490
million
people
and
I
make
no
apology
for
contend
we
should
be
part
of
a
integrated
union
that
challenge
the
hegemony
of
the
Unite
State
,
China
and
Russia
.
we
view
in
the
Labour
Party
have
be
always
temper
by
a
belief
in
social
solidarity
,
as
espouse
in
the
European
social
model
.
that
model
of
social
solidarity
have
come
under
attack
from
people
such
as
we
own
commissioner
.
that
who
argue
in
favour
of
the
retention
of
a
commissioner
should
ask
themselves
if
the
incumbent
Irish
Commissioner
have
act
in
the
good
interest
of
this
country
or
propagate
a
agenda
that
be
contrary
to
we
largely
social
democratic
principle
.
I
hope
we
next
commissioner
will
possess
the
egalitarian
Republican
ideal
once
espouse
by
the
Taoiseach
.
I
be
glad
to
note
we
have
retain
we
commissioner
nonetheless
.
the
EU
Commission
,
by
its
composition
,
have
shif
to
the
right
.
that
provide
clear
evidence
of
the
need
for
the
Union
to
reform
its
structure
.
the
primacy
of
inter-institutionalism
,
that
be
,
of
a
all
-
powerful
commission
,
must
be
challenge
.
I
be
not
espouse
intergovernmentalism
per
say
because
there
must
be
a
finely
tune
balance
between
the
two
.
the
treaty
provide
such
a
compromise
.
that
balance
,
as
contain
within
this
treaty
,
be
provide
for
by
extend
the
decision
-
make
power
of
the
European
Parliament
,
a
institution
that
reflect
the
wish
of
the
people
of
Europe
.
we
,
the
people
of
Europe
,
must
understand
that
the
model
underpin
the
working
of
the
European
Union
have
be
dominate
by
that
who
have
seek
to
de-regulate
every
aspect
of
we
life
,
especially
within
the
realm
of
public
service
or
service
of
general
interest
,
as
they
be
refer
to
in
the
treaty
.
I
be
glad
we
have
make
progress
on
that
matter
and
that
this
service
be
recognise
within
the
treaty
.
we
have
see
the
fruit
of
the
commission
's
labour
—
a
European
financial
structure
that
be
in
tatter
and
a
EU
economy
that
be
flounder
.
this
be
unsustainable
and
unbalanced
.
the
way
to
redress
the
imbalance
be
to
give
more
power
to
the
European
Parliament
.
this
will
shift
the
power
back
to
the
people
,
the
same
people
who

suspicious
of
they
government
and
want
to
see
job
and
the
economy
put
to
the
forefront
of
the
political
agenda
.
the
European
Parliament
will
at
least
provide
a
counter
-
weight
that
will
be
more
reflective
of
the
wish
of
the
European
people
,
even
if
it
be

by
the

.
the
Parliament
,
by
its
nature
,
because
it
do
not
govern
unilaterally
,
be
close
to
the
people
and
will
reflect
they
concern
.
it
will
ensure
that

throughout

remain
the

priority
.
that
be
provide
for
within
the

.
the
Lisbon
treaty
provide
that
the
"
ordinary
legislative
procedure
"
involve
co-decision
between
the
Council
of
Minister
and
the
European
Parliament
,
with
qualified
majority
voting
in
the
Council
of
Minister
.
this
mechanism
,
by
its
nature
,
increase
democratic
control
over
legislation
.
this
concept
,
however
,
be
not
debate
widely
because
there
be
still
a
serious
deficit
of
knowledge
among
legislator
and
the
public
as
to
the
general
power
of
the
European
Parliament
.
until
every
citizen
have
as
much
knowledge
of
how
the
Union
work
as
they
do
of
they
local
council
or
even
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
,
treaty
revision
will
be
dominate
by
issue
such
as
that
on
which
legal
guarantee
have
be
obtain
and
which
form
no
part
of
the
treaty
.
the
fact
remain
that
we
still
do
not
understand
how
the
whole
mechanism
work
.
before
I
be
accuse
of
patronise
anybody
,
I
must
state
every
single
person
to
whom
I
speak
prior
to
the
last
referendum
state
he
or
she
do
not
understand
the
treaty
or
how
it
work
.
that
be
a
fact
.
how
can
I
sell
this
treaty
to
anyone
if
the
majority
of
we
do
not
understand
qualified
majority
voting
or
co-decision
or
know
the
difference
between
a
directive
,
a
regulation
and
a
decision
?
we
must
inculcate
we
fellow
citizen
with
knowledge
of
the
working
of
the
institution
in
a
positive
way
.
this
must
start
in
every
school
and
from
a
young
age
.
until
such
time
as
this
be
achieve
,
there
always
will
be
opportunity
for
government
and
self
-
interested
group
to
take
advantage
of
people
's
lack
of
knowledge
.
there
be
still
a
dearth
of
knowledge
.
it
be
not
sufficient
for
the
government
to
suggest
it
have
deliver
the
goods
in
term
of
legal
guarantee
or
solemn
declaration
.
there
be
many
who
be
never
exercise
by
this
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
most
be
exercise
by
the
fact
that
they
do
not
know
what
be
in
the
treaty
.
there
be
many
who
be
never
exercise
by
this
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
we
,
in
this
house
,
be
to
blame
for
this
.
we
have
never
set
out
to
have
a
meaningful
educational
dialogue
with
we
fellow
citizen
on
the
fundamental
of
how
the
European
Union
work
.
that
be
partly
why
the
referendum
fall
the
last
time
.
it
could
do
so
again
unless
we
engage
in
a
meaningful
way
with
we
fellow

it

I
oppose
the
guillotine
of

.
the
legislation
be
base
on
a
challenge
to
section
6
of
the
Enforcement
of
Court
order
Act
1940
,
which
provide
that
where
a
debtor
have
a
instalment
plan
to
pay
a
debt
and
fail
to
discharge
that
obligation
,
the
creditor
may
apply

District
Court
for
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
the

.
the
Free
legal
Aid
Centre
,
FLAC
,
in
its
opinion
,
state
the
enforcement
of
court
order
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
confines
itself
to
remedy
the
constitutional
deficiency
identify
by
the
high
Court
in
the
McCann
case
and
this
be
the
most
fundamental
point
.
political
and
legal
argument
be
well
make
by
my
colleague
,
Senator
Alex
White
,
on
the
Bill
in
question
and
particular
reference
be
make
to
the
instigation
of
a
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
when
case
come
before
the
court
for
non-payment
of
debt
.
I
have
make
provision
for
this
argument
by
way
of
propose
amendment
to
the
Bill
to
reflect
that
view
.
we
should
also
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
have
indicate
that
the
Department
will
await
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
consultation
paper
on
debt
enforcement
before
take
any
further
action
in
this
area
.
will
the
minister
give
a
commitment
to
legislate
for
this
and
,
in
particular
,
that
aspect
of
the
Laffoy
judgment
on
attachment
of
earnings
?
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
report
will
be
most
welcome
but
if
it
do
not
give
voice
to
legislation
almost
immediately
then
I
suggest
the
inherent
problem
will
continue
.
I
acknowledge
FLAC
's
comment
in
that
regard
and
it
should
also
be
note
that
its
report
,
to
no
one
's
credit
,
publish
on
6
July
,
propose
a
wide
range
of
recommendation
for
change
in
this
area
.
the
FLAC
position
paper
state
:
"
this
be
welcome
change
to
the
exist
legislation
but
it
must
be
say
that
they
only
address
the
last
step
in
what
be
a
complex
and
less
than
user
friendly
procedure
that
take
place
in
open
court
and
be
in
need
of
comprehensive
reform
generally
.
"
the
report
point
out
that
while
the
Bill
contain
welcome
change
necessitate
by
the
McCann
judgment
,
it
do
not
go
far
enough
in
that
it
still
contemplate
imprisonment
as
a
sanction
for
debtor
.
although
it
will
improve
the
current
position
,
it
be
akin
to
place
a
stick
plaster
on
a
open
wound
,
namely
,
we
shameful
policy
of
continue
to
imprison
people
who
for
genuine
reason
cannot
pay
they
debt
as
oppose
to
refuse
to
do
so
.
we
must
make
the
distinction
between
that
who
cannot
and
that
who
simply
will
not
pay
they
debt
.
FLAC
suggest
that
the
State
move
towards
the
removal
of
imprisonment
as
a
option
in
debt
case
and
instead
employ
effective
non-penal
remedy
to
enforce
compliance
with
civil
debt
judgment
.
I
hope
the
Law
Reform
Commission
would
give
great
voice
to
this
aspiration
.
there
be
merit
to
this
argument
but
the
complete
removal
of
the
sanction
of
prison
be
not
a
vista
that
we
would
support
at
present
,
particularly
with
regard
to
family
law
matter
.
in
introduce
the
Bill
in
the
Seanad
,
the
Minister
of
State
say
:
the
high
Court
find
that
the
exist
legislation
lack
a
number
of
necessary
safeguard
in
circumstance
where
a
person
be
at
risk
of
imprisonment
.
the
judgment
state
that
,
while
this
process
have
traditionally
be
regard
as
a
civil
matter
,
its
effect
be
akin
to
a
criminal
one
and
the
debtor
be
entitle
to
similar
protection
.
there
be
particular
concern
that
the
1940
Act
do
not
appear
to
require
a
person
to
be
hear
by
a
court
before
be
imprison
.
follow
a
default
on
a
instalment
order
make
by
the
District
Court
,
a
creditor
could
apply
to
the
court
for
a
committal
order
and
even
in
the
case
of
the
non-appearance
of
a
debtor
,
committal
order
could
be
,
and
be
,
grant
by
the
District
Court
.
the
new
section
6
address
this
and
we
will
not
seek
to
amend
it
in
that
regard
.
I
believe
we
must
give
voice
to
the
McCann
judgment
and
deal
with
it
immediately
.
however
,
whether
the
legislation
deal
with
the
Laffoy
judgment
in
its
entirety
be
another
matter
.
in
the
debate
in
the
Seanad
,
my
colleague
rightly
ask
how
a
debtor
could
be
imprison
without
any
requirement
that
the
District
Court
would
first
have
to
decide
whether
the
non-payment
be
due
to
a
inability
to
pay
or
a
refusal
to
pay
.
this
seem
a
fundamental
point
,
but
it
be
not
a
area
of
the
law
with
which
many
of
we
be
familiar
until
the
judgment
be
make
in
this
case
.
the
judgment
probably
surprise
people
in
that
it
deem
the
area
unconstitutional
,
which
necessitate
legislation
.
I
could
not
understand
how
it
could
be
justify
as
a
law
.
it
seem
to
require
a
change
.
it
seem
basic
that
fair
procedure
should
be
available
for
a
hearing
before
the
court
deal
with
the
possible
imprisonment
of
a
debtor
.
the
Labour
Party
acknowledge
this
be
serious
legislation
,
as
it
involve
the
potential
imprisonment
of
people
for
non-payment
of
debt
.
we
also
acknowledge
that
serious
issue
be
raise
in
the
judgment
of
Laffoy
in
the
McCann
case
.
we
need
to
discuss
that
issue
in
great
detail
.
the
question
for
the
House
be
whether
this
legislation
be
draft
to
take
cognisance
of
the
difference
between
that
who
cannot
pay
and
that
who
will
not
pay
and
whether
the
application
of
criminal
procedure
against
debtor
who
fail
to
discharge
they
debt
be
reasonable
.
the
fact
that
the
imprisonment
order
make
against
Ms
McCann
would
have
be
carry
out
if
she
have
not
take
the
action
show
that
a
person
could
be
deprive
of
he
or
she
freedom
,
regardless
of
whether
he
or
she
be
deliberately
flout
the
law
or
could
not
simply
pay
they
debt
.
in
that
case
,
the
respondent
have
inform
the
court
that
they
would
vary
the
instalment
,
but
that
the
debt
would
still
stand
.
this
be
widely
report
in
the
media
at
the
time
and
the
Irish
Times
of
27
June
state
that
Judge
Neilan
say
he
would
remand
all
committal
and
many
enforcement
matter
to
the
end
of
November
,
when
it
might
be
clear
if
the
Laffoy
decision
would
be
appeal
to
the
Supreme
Court
or
if
legislator
would
take
action
.
we
be
take
action
today
,
but
it
still
remain
unclear
whether
the
government
have
adequately
deal
with
the
Laffoy
judgment
as
it
pertain
to
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
the
question
remain
as
to
whether
we
should
vote
against
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
the
finding
within
the
Laffoy
judgment
be
not
implement
in
they
entirety
in
this
legislation
or
whether
we
should
revert
to
the
1940
Act
.
I
suggest
we
should
not
revert
to
the
1940
Act
but
that
a
response
be
require
.
I
feel
the
response
be
deliver
in
the
legislation
,
although
the
Labour
Party
still
find
the
legislation
somewhat
flawed
.
it
remain
to
be
see
whether
the
lack
of
a
provision
in
this
regard
will
be
challenge
once
the
Bill
be
pass
.
we
must
legislate

ensure
that

and
upheld

that
the
threat
and
potential
for
imprisonment
remain

be
affect
adversely
and
whether
the
order
will
be
enforce
.
they
want
to
know
what
direction
the
minister
will
give
to
the
Attorney
General
with
regard
to
advice
to
court
clerk
on
the
matter
of
what
they
should
do
next
about
that
order
once
the
legislation
be
pass
.
there
be
significant
confusion
and
concern
in
this
regard
.
I
understand
that
in
one
area
in
the
west
up
to
200
maintenance
order
have
be
put
in
abeyance
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
implementation
of
the
legislation
.
will
the
minister
address
that
in
he
response
?
I
may
be
miss
the
point
,
but
if
Judge
Neilan
make
a
judgment
he
would
not
do
anything
until
such
time
as
the
legislation
be
pass
,
we
need
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
effect
the
passing
of
the
legislation
will
have
on
the
issuing
of
maintenance
order
.
we
must
legislate
to
ensure
that
maintenance
order
be
enforce
and
that
the
minister
maintain
the
potential
threat
of
imprisonment
where
they
be
not
pay
.
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
could
still
be
incorporate
in
the
Bill
.
the
change
in
the
Bill
will
,
in
some
circumstance
,
put
a
end
to
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
a
debtor
in
he
she
absence
and
alter
the
onus
of
proof
in
this
case
so
that
it
be
now
for
the
creditor
to
establish
that
the
debtor
's
failure
to
pay
instalment
be
either
due
to
wilful
refusal
or
culpable
neglect
.
this
be
as
suggest
by
FLAC
.
this
shift
the
balance
away
from
the
debtor
to
the
creditor
but
allow
for
the
possibility
for
the
creditor
to
reclaim
the
debt
or
part
of
it
.
this
concept
,
however
,
give
rise
to
some
difficulty
for
the
Labour
Party
.
we
seek
to
amend
the
legislation
to
reflect
the
fact
that
in
she
judgment
Judge
Laffoy
speak
specifically
about
the
issue
of
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
the
Minister
of
State
in
he
response
to
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
move
in
the
Seanad
state
that
the
question
of
attachment
of
earnings
—
the
substantive
basis
of
the
amendment
—
and
of
the
whole
area
of
attachment
of
earnings
to
social
welfare
payment
have
be
consider
by
the
government
,
both
in
this
Bill
and
in
the
Fines
Bill
.
the
conclusion
,
however
,
be
that
it
would
be
problematic
and
difficult
to
operate
fairly
.
the
amendment
also
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
include
attachment
to
social
welfare
payment
,
but
that
this
might
not
be
the
good
time
to
try
to
do
that
.
there
would
also
be
practical
difficulty
that
would
need
to
be
overcome
where
person
in
temporary
employment
be
concerned
.
I
question
the
logic
of
such
a
approach
.
if
the
Law
Reform
Commission
be
go
to
consider
the
issue
of
debt
and
seek
solution
by
way
of
legislation
,
we
must
consider
the
range
of
option
available
.
I
contend
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
be
one
such
option
.
this
already
operate
within
the
family
law
system
and
I
see
no
reason
that
it
cannot
operate
within
other
area
of
civil
debt
.
in
the
Seanad
the
Minister
of
State
say
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
present
a
difficulty
.
if
the
difficulty
be
due
to
the
cost
factor
or
if
it
be
a
administrative
difficulty
,
what
be
the
logic
of
he
argument
?
if
the
ultimate
aim
be
to
keep
people
out
of
prison
,
the
cost
of
administration
of
such
a
scheme
would
be
far
less
than
the
cost
of
imprisonment
.
there
be
logic
in
consider
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
and
include
it
in
the
legislation
.
that
would
be
the
way
to
go
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
people
have
be
imprison
for
not
adhere
to
maintenance
order
,
but
with
regard
to
civil
debt
,
one
could
instigate
such
procedure
.
Senator
Bacik
,
when
speak
in
the
Seanad
and
address
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
say
it
be
eminently
sensible
since
it
propose
a
different
regime
as
a
alternative
to
the
sanction
of
imprisonment
be
impose
upon
a
debtor
,
and
rather
than
imprisonment
,
it
envisage
a
attachment
of
income
or
welfare
order
that
would
be
make
to
address
circumstance
where
somebody
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
pay
debt
.
we
agree
with
this
approach
and
have
tab
amendment
to
that
effect
.
we
still
need
to
go
back
to
the
judgment
of
Ms
Justice
Laffoy
,
who
refer
to
article
11
of
the
UN
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
political
Right
.
it
state
:
"
no
one
shall
be
imprison
merely
because
of
they
inability
to
fulfil
a
contractual
obligation
.
"
the
principle
in
international
law
that
people
should
not
be
imprison
merely
because
of
they
inability
to
fulfil
a
contractual
obligation
be
clear
and
we
be
in
breach
of
it
.
although
there
be
improvement
to
the
current
situation
in
this
Bill
,
which
be
necessitate
by
the
McCann
judgment
,
the
fundamental
principle
upon
which
the
current
system
be
premise
,
namely
,
that
people
can
be
imprison
for
non-payment
of
debt
remain
in
place
.
what
be
the
point
of
imprison
Ms
McCann
?
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
the
vast
majority
of
that
before
the
court
be
people
with
little
or
no
means
or
without
the
necessary
life
skill
,
in
some
instance
,
to
manage
household
income
.
the
idea
that
someone
would
be
subject
to
a
committal
order
without
have
engage
in
any
process
before
a
judge
speak
volume
about
the
arcane
,
archaic
and
outmode
and
borrow
common
law
procedure
which
form
part
of
this
system
.
even
when
someone
receive
documentation
regard
the
discharging
of
a
debt
,
the
chance
be
that
they
be
intimidate
by
a
language
that
be
far
from
simple
and
be
typical
of
a
bygone
age
.
I
be
glad
this
be
be
deal
with
in
the
Bill
.
the
State
must
immediately
begin
the
process
of
change
the
arcane
procedure
regard
the
discharging
of
debt
.
it
be
one
thing
for
we
to
change
the
legislation
,
but
the
question
then
arise
as
to
when
the
section
6
provision
will
kick
in
and
whether
we
will
see
a
revolution
in
the
court
regard
they
arcane
procedure
and
the
type
of
language
they
use
,
and
whether
they
will
change
overnight
.
I
suggest
they
will
not
and
that
many
people
who
present
themselves
to
the
court
will
be
as
confused
as
ever
.
until
we
develop
a
language
for
the
law
that
reflect
modernity
—
if
I
can
use
that
word
—
we
will
still
have
situation
like
the
McCann
case
.
we
still
await
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
paper
in
that
regard
and
hope
it
will
lead
to
the
overhaul
of
the
system
.
we
need
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
rights
of
the
debtor
before
the
court
and
the
rights
of
the
creditor
to
obtain
payment
.
the
minister
state
there
be
4300
application
for
enforcement
order
to
the
District
Court
and
that
186
people
be
imprison
so
far
this
year
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
figure
will
rise
.
when
one
take
into
account
that
in
prison
for
non-payment
of
fine
,
we
have
more
trouble
than
be
worth
it
inside
we
prison
,
where
people
be
there
for
civil
rather
than
criminal
issue
.
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
.
this
bring
I
back
to
FLAC
.
why
not
look
seriously
at
the
proposal
launch
on
Monday
call
to
no
one
's
credit
and
engage
on
that
issue
in
a
meaningful
way
?
I
suggest
the
government
,
particularly
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
deputy
Dermot
Ahern
,
have
its
face
set
against
any
idea
that
seek
to
look
more
laterally
at
the
issue
.
the
fact
remain
that
since
Adam
be
a
boy
people
have
renege
on
they
debt
and
no
government
,
no
matter
how
well
-
intentioned
,
will
be
able
to
legislate
for
human
behaviour
.
I
suggest
a
little
bit
of
common
sense
and
the
accommodation
of
new
idea
would
be
the
way
to
go
.
we
can
no
long
afford
the
notion
that
people
would
be
jail
for
debt
where
it
be
prove
that
they
genuinely
cannot
pay
.
Ms
Justice
Laffoy
,
on
page
82
of
the
judgment
,
state
that
the
application
of
element
of
the
test
to
section
6
illustrate
that
it
be
disproportionate
interference
with
the
constitutionally
protect
right
to
liberty
because
the
objective
of
imprison
a
debtor
for
failure
to
comply
with
a
instalment
order
be
to
procure
the
discharge
of
arrears
of
instalment
.
she
refer
specifically
to
a
statutory
procedure
under
which
a
debtor
who
be
unable
to
discharge
the
arrears
be
imprison
because
of
the
absence
therein
of
procedure
,
include
procedure
which
give
effect
to
the
debtor
's
right
to
fair
procedure
under
the
constitution
,
which
ensure
that
the
judge
ascertain
that
the
debtor
be
unable
to
discharge
the
arrears
,
cannot
be
say
to
be
rationally
connect
with
the
objective
.
this
speak
to
point
we
make
on
the
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
.
she
state
such
a
procedure
be
arbitrary
,
unfair
and
not
base
on
rational
consideration
,
and
be
a
unreasonable
and
unnecessary
interference
with
the
debtor
's
right
to
personal
liberty
.
the
question
be
whether
this
aspect
of
she
judgment
have
be
remedy
by
the
new
section
6
.
I
be
a
layman
;
I
be
not
solicitor
,
as
be
my
two
learn
colleague
,
but
perhaps
the
minister
could
respond
and
let
we
know
whether
that
aspect
of
she
judgment
have
be
remedy
.
could
the
statutory
scheme
she
refer
to
be
apply
by
way
of
a
attachment
of
earnings
procedure
?
she
state
that
in
circumstance
where
a
debtor
have
some
resource
to
meet
a
debt
,
a
statutory
scheme
which
do
not
require
the
creditor
to
seek
redress
by
attach
that
resource
do
not
impair
the
debtor
's
right
to
liberty
as
little
as
possible
.
we
wish
to
speak
to
that
issue
by
way
of
the
amendment
we
have
tab
.
ultimately
,
the
question
for
we
be
whether
we
need
to
amend
the
legislation
to
give
voice
to
Ms.
Justice
Laffoy
's
judgment
so
as
to
offset
the
risk
that
the
Bill
may
be
strike
down
again
on
foot
of
a
legal
challenge
in
this
strange
time
.
where
we
guillotine
at
will
,
we
risk
the
prospect
of
a
challenge
when
the
space
for
proper
debate
be
curb
.
proper
space
and
time
have
not
be
allocate
for
debate
on
this
matter
.
it
should
be
state
,
for
historical
purpose
,
that
guillotining
legislation
such
as
this
do
the
legislature
no
good
.
I
often
think
that
when
we
legislate
in
haste
,
it
may
come
back
to
haunt
we
.
we
welcome
section
6
.
it
will
get
the
minister
over
the
hump
,
so
to
speak
,
regard
the
McCann
judgment
,
but
there
be
other
issue
which
need
to
be
address
.
if
we
have
more
time
and
debate
,
a
great
allowance
for
amendment
and
more
expert
opinion
on
this
matter
,
perhaps
we
could
have
address
it
more
fruitfully
.
before
the
minister
embark
on
a
story
,
I
ask
he
to
address
the
point
on
the
District
Court
where
there
be
outstanding
issue
in
regard
to
maintenance
order
.
this
be
fully
address
in
the
Seanad
.
my
party
would
agree
with
the
principle
of
attachment
of
earnings
be
add
to
this
legislation
for
obvious
reason
.
it
would
provide
a
way
towards
off
-
set
the
risk
against
imprisonment
.
it
would
set
in
place
a
clearly
define
procedure
within
the
legislation
on
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
afterwards
.
on
that
basis
,
we
would
support
the
principle
of
attachment
of
earnings
as
use
in
maintenance
order
,
which
could
be
extend
here
.
it
would
address
the
Laffoy
judgment
also
.
I
move
amendment
no.

the
recent
scandal
at
FÁS
have
take
the
organisation
to
such
new
low
that
its
name
alone
evoke
any
number
of
negative
connotation
.
its
unfortunate
association
with
the
Fianna
Fáil
Party
have
cast
a
further
shadow
over
its
reputation
.
whether
one
argue
that
this
patronage
be
real
or
perceive
,
it
be
now
time
to
end
the
era
of
the
nod
and
the
wink
and
sever
the
long
association
with
the
Fianna
Fáil
movement
.
it
be
time
to
break
this
unofficial
link
and
rebuild
the
organisation
so
that
FÁS
can
re-ignite
a
sense
of
trust
in
that
who
avail
of
its
service
.
let
we
be
sure
that
people
will
from
now
on
be
100
%
confident
that
FÁS
be
apolitical
in
its
approach
to
everything
it
do
.
we
must
strive
to
bring
FÁS
back
from
the
brink
and
excise
from
its
employment
anyone
who
be
be
carry
unnecessarily
.
its
upper
echelon
have
tarnish
the
authority
's
standing
in
the
public
eye
.
the
reason
for
this
be
well
document
and
have
be
cover
extensively
by
my
colleague
,
deputy
Shortall
.
however
,
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
there
be
much
to
praise
in
FÁS
.
the
Labour
Party
be
determined
to
assist
in
the
restoration
of
its
reputation
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
the
good
work
that
currently
go
on
in
FÁS
,
which
have
a
network
of
66
regional
office
and
20
training
centre
across
the
country
.
the
majority
of
its
work
be
carry
out
at
a
grass
-
root
level
through
the
hard
work
of
its
training
and
education
supervisor
,
employment
scheme
participant
,
business
adviser
and
recruitment
specialist
.
it
have
specifically
cater
for
the
marginalised
in
we
society
.
through
initiative
aim
at
people
with
disability
and
member
of
the
Traveller
community
,
FÁS
have
always
seek
to
empower
and
include
all
citizen
of
we
country
at
a
grass
-
root
level
.
its
wide
horizon
initiative
aim
at
increase
understanding
among
young
people
north
and
south
of
the
Border
,
reconcile
the
two
tradition
while
increase
work
skill
for
every
participant
.
at
ground
level
,
the
work
carry
out
by
FÁS
help
people
from
all
walk
of
life
to
find
job
and
obtain
training
,
and
promote
work
throughout
we
community
.
we
must
not
ignore
this
.
my
experience
of
FÁS
at
a
local
level
have
be
positive
,
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
associate
the
local
worker
with
the
shenanigan
of
that
within
the
hierarchy
.
what
this
people
on
the
ground
represent
be
far
remove
from
what
the
hierarchy
have
come
to
embody
.
where
it
represent
neglect
,
the
work
of
that
on
the
ground
be
characterise
by
a
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
to
the
people
they
be
supervise
through
the
community
employment
scheme
and
in
the
various
office
throughout
the
66
centre
.
where
waste
be
widespread
among
a
minority
at
the
upper
level
,
the
majority
have
come
to
represent
a
significant
investment
in
we
community
.
this
can
not
be
overlook
in
we
effort
to
reform
the
organisation
.
FÁS
have
give
hope
to
many
in
term
of
they
own
personal
circumstance
and
that
of
they
neighbourhood
.
I
be
representative
of
a
largely
rural
constituency
and
I
have
see
first
hand
the
benefit
yield
by
the
community
scheme
,
spearhead
by
FÁS
and
manage
by
local
people
work
within
that
community
.
as
with
all
State
-
fund
body
,
cutback
have
affect
the
service
offer
to
people
in
both
rural
and
urban
community
.
the
idea
that
the
waste
at
the
top
level
of
FÁS
run
parallel
with
the
reduction
of
valuable
service
to
community
have
anger
the
public
and
the
body
politic
alike
.
we
have
every
right
to
be
angry
but
we
must
differentiate
between
the
person
in
the
board
room
and
the
worker
on
the
street
.
we
anger
must
be
channel
appropriately
.
this
anger
lament
the
fact
that
this
fine
institution
should
have
become
a
vessel
for
such
waste
when
it
have
be
a
force
for
good
.
I
believe
it
can
be
a
force
for
good
again
,
but
we
must
bring
about
the
necessary
change
.
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
government
to
revise
the
fee
of
non-executive
chairperson
and
member
of
board
of
state
body
my
Department
contact
the
agency
where
a
fee
be
payable
to
the
chairperson
and
member
of
the
board
request
they
to
reduce
fee
payable
by
10
%
effective
from
1st
May
2009
.
the
relevant
agency
be
also
inform
that
the
revise
fee
be
to
be
apply
in
accordance
with
instruction
provide
by
the
Department
of
Finance
.
I
can
confirm
that
the
agency
concern
comply
with
the
request
.
I
do
not
want
to
raise
any
hackles
,
but
I
ask
the
Tánaiste
whether
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
will
be
publish
any
time
soon
.
that
we
be
only
now
transpose
a
directive
which
be
agree
in
2006
be
typical
of
the
manner
in
which
the
government
have
be
remiss
in
its
obligation
vis
-à
-
vo
the
transposition
of
EU
directive
in
general
.
Ireland
be
behind
the
curve
again
because
we
European
counterpart
,
in
some
instance
,
be
already
prepare
to
undertake
a
review
of
the
directive
that
we
have
yet
to
transpose
.
this
House
,
for
the
first
time
,
will
bring
about
legislation
specifically
charge
with
the
retention
of
communication
datum
.
this
legislation
be
so
flawed
that
it
will
have
to
be
completely
rewritten
if
the
Labour
Party
be
to
support
it
.
it
be
bad
for
business
,
too
costly
to
implement
,
undemocratic
and
the
oversight
provision
be
too
weak
.
I
hope
it
will
be
significantly
amend
to
make
it
more
realistic
and
not
the
sham
we
have
before
we
.
the
reason
for
Ireland
's
delay
in
follow
we
EU
counterpart
in
introduce
such
a
Bill
be
well
document
.
a
attempt
by
previous
administration
to
exclude
the
European
Parliament
and
the
European
Court
of
Justice
delay
the
adoption
of
the
directive
here
.
thankfully
,
with
the
exception
of
Slovakia
,
the
overzealous
and
restrictive
measure
favour
by
the
former
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
Michael
McDowell
,
curry
little
favour
in
Europe
.
this
directive
be
see
as
the
less
of
two
evil
by
the
party
of
European
Socialist
in
the
European
Parliament
,
in
2004
-
05
.
this
be
where
we
differ
with
the
minister
's
interpretation
in
term
of
the
historical
perspective
of
the
directive
.
follow
the
Madrid
bombing
in
2005
the
Irish
,
British
and
two
other
government
come
forward
with
proposal
for
a
third
pillar
intergovernmental
decision
on
datum
retention
.
such
a
measure
would
have
be
adopt
by
the
Justice
Council
with
consultation
rights
only
for
the
European
Parliament
and
no
oversight
role
for
the
European
Court
of
Justice
afterwards
.
this
course
of
action
be
oppose
by
the
Commission
and
the
European
Parliament
,
largely
on
the
grounds
that
such
a
measure
should
be
approve
by
the
European
Parliament
.
the
Commission
then
issue
a
proposal
for
a
draft
directive
in
September
2005
and
the
socialist
group
negotiate
amendment
in
the
European
Parliament
and
adopt
it
December
.
one
of
that
amendment
concern
a
full
review
of
the
measure
in
September
2010
.
my
colleague
in
the
European
Parliament
,
Mr.
Proinsias
de
Rossa
,
MEP
,
vote
in
favour
of
the
compromise
and
the
four
Fianna
Fáil
MEPs
at
that
time
abstain
.
the
directive
be
approve
by
the
Council
in
2006
and
be
to
have
be
transpose
into
Irish
law
by
September
2007
.
however
,
the
then
minister
,
Mr.
McDowell
,
take
a
case
to
the
European
Court
of
Justice
,
argue
that
the
Council
have
no
authority
to
adopt
the
directive
and
that
only
a
third
pillar
initiative
be
permit
.
the
government
refuse
to
transpose
the
directive
while
this
case
be
ongoing
.
in
response
the
European
Commission
begin
legal
proceedings
over
Ireland
's
failure
to
transpose
.
last
February
the
European
Court
of
Justice
reject
the
government
's
argument
and
upheld
the
directive
.
my
understanding
be
that
civil
liberty
group
do
not
have
a
opinion
about
the
four
country
's
initiative
in
2005
,
but
have
write
in
opposition
to
the
draft
directive
.
if
there
be
no
directive
,
it
could
be
argue
,
it
be
likely
that
the
four
country
's
initiative
would
have
be
adopt
.
in
that
context
there
be
two
view
that
can
be
take
on
the
directive
,
and
consequently
this
Bill
.
one
be
that
we
transpose
and
thereby
pass
the
Bill
into
law
without
question
and
accept
it
as
a
fait
accompli
.
the
second
be
that
we
seek
to
amend
the
Bill
and
ground
it
in
reality
by
address
the
cost
of
its
implementation
for
business
and
the
issue
of
oversight
.
the
Labour
Party
take
the
view
that
there
be
circumstance
in
which
datum
retention
be
need
and
useful
.
however
,
there
be
some
many
flaw
in
the
propose
legislation
that
it
would
have
to
be
considerably
amend
before
we
could
be
satisfied
with
its
passing
into
law
.
if
we
take
the
historical
perspective
and
the
context
in
the
which
the
directive
be
fashioned
,
then
we
must
speak
of
the
Madrid
bombing
and
the
Omagh
atrocity
,
which
occur
prior
to
the
instigation
of
the
directive
.
however
,
much
water
have
pass
under
the
bridge
and
the
need
to
transpose
and
legislate
remains
.
we
have
a
obligation
in
that
respect
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
legislation
have
be
supersede
in
some
respects
by
the
surveillance
Bill
in
its
use
as
a
crime
prevention
measure
.
whether
this
Bill
be
a
complement
to
recently
adopt
legislation
be
open
to
question
.
generally
speak
,
the
provision
within
the
Bill
must
be
such
that
they
be
only
allow
in
clearly
prescribe
circumstance
and
we
must
guard
against
any
nefarious
use
of
the
act
when
it
come
into
force
.
the
provision
must
be
subject
to
democratic
review
.
they
must
also
be
subject
to
proper
judicial
review
.
a
criticism
of
the
Bill
relate
to
its
timing
.
I
have
already
state
that
we
be
behind
the
curve
and
Ireland
should
now
be
prepare
for
the
2010
review
of
the
directive
.
it
should
also
be
point
out
that
the
European
Court
of
Justice
will
now
be
bind
by
the
datum
protection
article
of
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
because
of
Lisbon
.
if
there
be
claim
from
any
quarter
that
this
represent
excessive
interference
from
Brussels
,
it
would
be
my
view
that
Mr.
McDowell
's
alternative
be
far
more
draconian
and
that
the
Fianna
Fáil
-
Progressive
Democrat
arrangement
originally
seek
to
extend
this
measure
to
the
entire
EU
.
if
one
argue
this
Bill
from
the
civil
libertarian
perspective
,
then
I
respectfully
suggest
that
the
only
alternative
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
original
proposal
.
it
be
good
that
,
rather
than
have
"
a
intergovernmental
measure
"
,
we
have
a
"
community
measure
"
that
give
a
voice
to
the
European
parliament
,
and
give
the
European
Court
of
Justice
a
meaningful
role
.
concern
have
previously
arise
as
to
the
nature
and
specifically
the
volume
of
request
make
for
retain
datum
.
previously
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
highlight
how
,
in
2006
,
there
be
10000
Garda
request
for
access
to
personal
telephone
record
under
power
arise
from
the
amendment
to
the
criminal
Justice
(
Terrorist
Offences
)
Act
.
this
amount
to
almost
30
request
for
every
day
in
2006
,
and
it
be
evident
that
a
review
of
the
practice
have
be
long
require
.
that
we
be
finally
to
address
this
directive
with
a
Bill
be
positive
but
it
be
not
without
its
peril
.
the
Labour
Party
fully
support
datum
retention
but
only
for
specific
circumstance
.
with
this
power
,
there
be
a
responsibility
,
and
it
be
we
hope
that
through
the
legislative
process
we
will
address
some
of
the
ambiguity
and
issue
arise
from
what
have
be
present
in
the
Bill
.
I
be
concerned
with
the
provision
in
the
Bill
in
regard
to
the
timeframe
within
which
datum
will
be
retain
by
service
provider
.
there
be
concern
also
in
regard
to
cost
undertake
by
that
service
provider
to
adhere
to
such
a
provision
.
it
be
we
consider
view
that
the
minimum
period
of
six
month
may
be
sufficient
.
however
,
we
will
take
this
under
advisement
and
speak
about
this
on
committee
stage
.
I
fear
that
if
the
maximum
allowable
retention
period
will
be
two
year
,
then
we
will
open
this
process
to
a
abuse
and
the
cost
to
business
will
reduce
competitiveness
and
will
ultimately
affect
the
consumer
.
I
fail
to
see
how
10000
request
per
annum
could
possibly
be
pertinent
to
a
serious
crime
investigation
.
far
,
the
lack
of
a
role
for
the
Garda
Ombudsman
be
of
itself
a
cause
for
concern
.
where
a
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
be
investigate
a
complaint
against
a
Garda
that
may
involve
a
criminal
offence
,
the
officer
of
the
commission
have
all
the
power
,
immunity
and
privilege
of
a
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
.
this
include
common
law
power
and
power
under
any
act
,
whether
pass
before
or
after
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
.
so
,
it
seem
that
officer
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
will
have
the
power
vested
in
the
Garda
under
this
Bill
.
while
this
be
reasonable
,
it
raise
the
question
as
to
why
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
its
officer
have
be
specifically
exclude
from
exercising
the
power
to
be
vested
in
gardaí
under
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
.
consistency
in
application
would
require
that
the
ombudsman
commission
should
have
investigative
power
equivalent
to
that
of
gardaí
under
both
this
piece
of
legislation
.
what
be
the
reason
for
exclude
the
ombudsman
commission
under
one
Bill
and
include
it
in
the
other
?
I
hope
the
minister
will
address
this
point
.
on
the
issue
of
oversight
,
I
must
ask
whether
the
minister
be
seriously
ask
this
legislature
to
accept
section
11
as
it
be
word
at
present
.
if
we
speak
specifically
to
the
issue
of
oversight
,
section
11
would
have
to
be
modify
to
give
a
more
structure
role
for
judicial
oversight
other
than
that
which
be
propose
.
the
wording
in
section
11
and
12
be
as
weak
as
water
and
pay
lip
service
to
the
notion
of
oversight
.
there
be
no
provision
for
redress
for
a
person
who
have
be
investigate
inappropriately
under
this
provision
.
there
be
no
provision
for
a
Revenue
officer
,
member
of
the
Garda
Síochána
or
member
of
the
permanent
Defence
Force
to
be
bring
to
book
where
a
misuse
or
abuse
of
the
process
be
prove
.
the
oversight
process
must
investigate
a
adequate
number
of
file
and
this
must
be
on
a
random
basis
.
the
question
again
arise
as
to
what
real
power
a
judge
have
in
regard
to
any
abuse
of
process
.
there
be
none
that
I
can
see
in
the
Bill
.
I
refer
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
to
the
Bills
Digest
produce
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
,
which
produce
a
excellent
paper
on
this
matter
,
and
I
acknowledge
its
invaluable
service
in
this
respect
.
on
the
matter
of
judicial
supervision
,
the
paper
state
:
"
in
carry
out
he
-
she
duty
the
judge
may
investigate
any
case
in
which
a
disclosure
request
be
make
,
communicate
with
the
Taoiseach
or
the
minister
concern
disclosure
request
,
and
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
in
connection
with
the
Commissioner
's
function
under
the
data
Protection
Act
1988
and
2003
.
"
while
this
oversight
broadly
echow
similar
approach
use
in
,
for
example
,
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Bill
2009
,
Mr.
Tom
McIntyre
,
speak
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
Justice
(
Terrorist
Offences
)
act
2005
,
raise
concern
about
the
effectiveness
of
this
form
of
supervision
scheme
.
he
state
:
.
.
.
this
oversight
system
have
be
almost
entirely
opaque
from
the
outset
.
the
annual
report
of
the
designate
judge
—
since
the
position
be
create
in
1993
—
have
consist
every
year
of
no
more
than
a
single
line
state
that
the
operation
of
the
act
have
be
keep
under
review
and
its
provision
have
be
comply
with
.
there
have
be
for
example
no
discussion
of
what
step
have
be
take
to
keep
the
operation
of
the
act
under
review
;
whether
the
individual
file
be
review
;
the
volume
of
surveillance
be
carry
out
;
and
whether
mistake
be
make
in
carry
out
surveillance
(
such
as
target
of
the
wrong
individual
or
number
)
and
,
if
so
,
what
step
be
take
to
safeguard
against
such
mistake
in
future
.
there
be
similarly
no
publicly
available
report
of
the
complaint
referee
indicate
what
complaint
,
if
any
,
have
be
make
and
-
or
upheld
.
this
may
be
contrast
with
the
most
recent
annual
report
of
the
UK
Chief
Surveillance
Commissioner
which
reveal
,
amongst
other
thing
,
that
23628
authorisation
for
direct
surveillance
be
grant
to
law
enforcement
agency
;
and
60
different
law
enforcement
agency
be
inspect
during
the
year
.
.
.
the
report
of
the
designate
judge
be
not
exactly
what
one
would
call
model
of
transparency
.
there
be
no
reason
that
we
should
not
have
a
provision
in
the
Bill
which
would
guarantee
that
statistical
datum
be
make
available
.
there
be
a
irony
in
that
because
,
if
one
examine
section
9
of
the
Bill
,
one
will
see
there
be
provision
for
a
annual
statistical
report
to
the
European
Commission
,
as
require
by
the
directive
,
but
not
to
the
Oireachtas
or
to
Irish
citizen
.
at
least
this
report
should
be
lay
before
the
Oireachtas
.
the
opaque
nature
of
the
Irish
oversight
system
also
become
obvious
when
compare
with
the
equivalent
report
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
the
relevant
official
in
the
UK
be
the
Interception
of
Communication
Commissioner
.
that
individual
be
a
retire
judge
who
have
similar
function
to
we
designate
judge
.
however
,
he
most
recent
annual
report
run
to
24
page
in
total
,
nine
of
which
be
devote
to
datum
retention
issue
.
grant
,
the
UK
system
be
on
a
much
large
scale
,
but
one
key
difference
be
that
the
UK
commissioner
do
not
see
he
role
as
limited
to
the
narrow
question
of
legality
—
instead
he
report
go
into
detail
about
mistake
which
be
make
and
explain
what
be
be
do
to
prevent
further
mistake
.
it
would
be
desirable
to
establish
a
great
role
for
the
designate
judge
along
this
line
.
I
hope
we
can
address
that
issue
on
committee
stage
.
the
function
of
the
designate
judge
and
complaint
referee
be
too
limited
.
one
of
the
problem
with
the
role
of
the
designate
judge
under
section
12
be
that
it
envisage
he
or
she
as
be
engage
in
a
largely
paper
-
base
exercise
.
section
12
give
the
designate
judge
"
the
power
to
investigate
any
case
in
which
a
disclosure
request
be
make
"
.
let
we
suppose
however
that
a
junior
garda
informally
pressurise
a
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
employee
to
hand
over
information
—
perhaps
for
some
private
purpose
.
in
that
case
no
"
disclosure
request
"
,
as
define
in
section
6
,
would
have
be
make
,
thus
leave
a
question
mark
as
to
whether
the
judge
have
any
power
to
investigate
.
it
might
be
possible
to
read
section
12
widely
to
find
such
a
power
—
but
it
would
be
desirable
for
it
to
be
make
clear
.
the
judge
's
role
under
section
12
be
also
limit
to
"
ascertain[ing
]
whether
the
Garda
Síochána
,
the
permanent
Defence
Force
and
the
Revenue
commissioner
be
comply
with
"
the
act
.
as
such
,
the
judge
do
not
appear
to
enjoy
any
power
to
,
for
example
,
make
sure
that
isp
and
telco
be
store
this
information
securely
or
be
respond
appropriately
to
request
.
similarly
,
the
role
of
the
complaint
referee
under
section
10
hing
on
there
be
a
"
disclosure
request
"
.
as
such
,
he
or
she
would
have
no
power
to
investigate
if
,
for
example
,
a
newspaper
be
to
bribe
a
telecom
employee
for
access
to
information
.
I
refer
to
a
recent
case
where
a
red
top
,
which
I
will
not
name
,
be
recently
implicate
in
a
similar
phone
tapping
scandal
.
that
problem
be
to
some
extent
mitigate
by
the
fact
that
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
might
investigate
that
situation
but
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
will
not
have
the
same
oversight
power
.
the
act
should
clarify
the
function
of
the
designate
judge
and
complaint
referee
and
make
clear
what
be
to
happen
in
borderline
case
.
there
be
uncertainty
about
to
whom
the
Bill
will
apply
.
the
Bill
take
,
essentially
verbatim
,
the
loose
language
of
the
directive
and
in
section
1
define
a
service
provider
as
"
a
person
who
be
engage
in
the
provision
of
a
publicly
available
electronic
communication
service
or
a
public
communication
network
by
means
of
fix
line
or
mobile
telephone
or
the
Internet
"
.
that
be
wide
,
and
imprecise
definition
and
give
that
specific
statutory
obligation
be
create
a
element
of
doubt
can
arise
.
there
be
many
various
application
and
we
do
not
know
how
the
provision
would
apply
to
or
affect
that
who
use
webmail
,
webmail
-
like
application
,
open
wifi
,
and
voice
internet
messaging
.
the
list
be
endless
.
there
be
such
a
broad
scope
and
range
of
technology
that
it
be
we
view
that
the
definition
need
to
be
clear
.
that
will
cause
panic
and
confusion
across
the
sector
and
will
have
seriously
damaging
consequence
for
Ireland
's
ability
to
promote
itself
as
a
destination
for
high
-
tech
industry
.
I
wish
to
read
into
the
record
a
copy
of
a
letter
receive
by
the
Minister
from
the
ICT
division
of
Engineer
which
speak
further
to
the
concern
they
have
about
the
Bill
:
we
first
observe
that
electronic
datum
be
diverse
,
and
increase
in
its
diversity
.
telephone
,
mobile
phone
and
text
messaging
be
well
establish
,
along
with
electronic
email
messaging
.
however
,
in
many
community
it
be
now
more
common
to
use
social
networking
site
—
such
as
Facebook
,
Bebo
,
and
LinkedIn
—
for
direct
person
to
person
,
and
person
to
group
communication
.
such
communication
use
a
different
technology
than
email
,
and
cannot
necessarily
be
detect
by
software
which
specifically
track
email
.
far
,
direct
internet
messaging
—
such
as
AIM
,
MSN
,
Yahoo
Messenger
and
skype
messaging
—
be
also
extremely
common
.
finally
of
course
Twitter
be
also
now
perhaps
the
most
prevalent
of
they
all
,
and
can
be
use
both
for
instant
person
to
person
communication
,
as
well
as
person
to
group
communication
.
no
doubt
next
year
,
there
will
be
another
new
communication
technology
..
we
concern
be
that
as
criminal
become
aware
of
the
legislation
pertain
in
Ireland
,
they
may
well
be
able
to
displace
they
electronic
communication
mode
to
new
one
for
which
legislation
have
yet
to
be
pass
.
[
that
issue
need
to
be
raise
as
well
.
]
on
a
different
track
,
we
would
note
that
in
today
's
world
,
much
electronic
communication
be
international
in
nature
.
correspondent
(
of
instant
messaging
,
email
,
social
networking
,
twitter
and
so
)
may
not
always
be
within
the
Irish
jurisdiction
,
and
not
even
within
the
EU
.
we
gently
draw
this
to
you
attention
,
and
assume
you
legal
advisor
be
consider
the
consequence
of
capture
information
relate
to
citizen
and
company
from
outside
the
EU
who
may
not
be
cover
by
Irish
legislation
.
[
that
point
must
be
address
by
the
minister
in
response
to
this
debate
.
]
with
today
's
falling
cost
of
storage
,
there
be
no
particular
great
concern
over
the
cost
of
the
physical
hardware
.
however
,
safely
and
securely
store
and
then
retrieve
(
perhaps
after
several
year
)
increase
quantity
of
information
do
have
implication
on
the
business
process
of
the
service
provider
concerned
.
there
be
the
aspect
of
capture
the
information
in
the
first
instance
,
base
on
the
number
of
mode
of
communication
.
that
will
run
into
billion
if
one
take
the
two
year
retention
period
into
account
.
that
issue
will
have
to
be
address
.
follow
that
,
there
be
a
significant
cost
implication
for
business
as
a
result
of
that
.
in
this
country
we
be
talk
about
the
possibility
of
a
smart
economy
.
what
the
legislation
do
be
incur
a
further
cost
on
business
by
virtue
of
the
datum
retention
period
.
Wide
issue
arise
in
term
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
legislation
vis-à
-
vis
the
fact
that
we
trade
internationally
and
message
pass
internationally
.
that
be
something
that
must
be
address
by
the
legislation
.
no
justification
have
be
give
for
a
two
-
year
retention
period
for
phone
datum
.
under
the
directive
,
member
state
be
free
to
choose
a
datum
retention
period
between
six
month
and
two
year
.
the
UK
adopt
a
standard
12
month
period
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
justification
as
to
why
the
Bill
opt
for
the
maximum
two
year
for
telephone
datum
.
the
European
Commission
's
own
research
on
police
request
for
datum
have
show
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
request
be
for
datum
which
be
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
Garda
experience
be
different
then
some
evidence
to
that
effect
would
be
desirable
.
as
to
the
budgetary
implication
of
this
legislation
,
I
have
serious
reservation
about
the
undue
cost
that
would
be
borne
by
business
as
a
result
of
that
measure
.
again
,
I
refer
to
the
Oireachtas
research
service
that
focus
on
the
budgetary
implication
.
it
state
the
Bill
be
silent
on
the
likely
cost
to
be
involve
in
implement
and
comply
with
the
provision
of
the
directive
.
accord
to
the
status
report
on
the
transposition
of
the
directive
by
EU
member
states
and
EFTA
and
the
regulatory
impact
assessment
prepare
by
the
Department
of
Justice
,
Equality
and
Law
Reform
,
the
State
will
not
reimburse
service
provider
the
cost
involve
in
comply
with
the
obligation
under
the
Bill
,
even
though
"
service
provider
have
complain
that
management
of
datum
would
impose
heavy
cost
that
they
would
in
turn
have
to
pass
on
to
business
and
consumer
"
.
the
net
effect
of
the
legislation
,
arguably
,
be
that
we
will
retain
all
sort
of
datum
,
99.9
%
of
which
will
be
superfluous
message
that
pass
between
ordinary
citizen
.
this
will
be
store
by
the
service
provider
.
there
will
be
a
cost
for
that
storage
and
the
consumer
will
end
up
pay
that
cost
.
I
accept
the
principle
that
there
must
be
datum
retention
.
however
,
there
must
be
balance
in
term
of
how
long
it
be
retain
and
whether
it
be
necessary
to
retain
datum
for
two
year
.
I
believe
it
be
unnecessary
.
it
be
impractical
and
in
the
context
of
crime
prevention
measure
,
I
be
not
convinced
that
retain
datum
,
particularly
internet
datum
,
for
a
period
of
two
year
will
catch
more
criminal
or
undo
a
terrorist
organisation
.
we
must
exercise
a
little
common
sense
in
we
approach
to
the
legislation
.
with
that
in
mind
,
we
will
seek
to
amend
the
legislation
significantly
to
reflect
we
view
.
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
be
be
collate
by
my
official
,
but
unfortunately
it
have
not
be
possible
to
fully
gather
all
the
relevant
datum
in
the
time
available
.
I
will
reply
directly
to
the
deputy
as
soon
as
the
information
have
be
fully
collate
.

if
the
original
reps
plan
be
a
agri-environment
measure
,
why
be
it
necessary
to
do
away
with
the
scheme
and
reintroduce
a
agri-environment
measure
which
will
have
the
same
aim
?
why
do
the
minister
not
refer
to
biodiversity
?
it
will
be
argue
the
scheme
be
use
as
a
supplementary
income
measure
in
some
case
.
the
scheme
's
closure
will
result
in
more
applicant
for
farm
assist
,
which
be
already
happen
in
some
area
.
consider
the
biodiversity
measure
already
contain
under
the
exist
scheme
and
its
success
,
it
seem
illogical
that
a
new
scheme
need
to
be
introduce
when
the
old
scheme
could
be
continue
.
will
the
new
scheme
—
we
can
call
it
the
agri-environment
measure
for
the
time
being
—
be
administer
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
what
be
the
average
pay
out
to
farmer
under
reps
?
there
be
too
much
consultation
.
that
be
fine
.
I
be
used
to
that
.
I
ask
this
question
,
give
that
Teagasc
's
procedure
and
operation
have
already
be
review
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
recommendation
will
be
implement
.
however
,
the
McCarthy
report
state
that
there
be
scope
for
reduce
Teagasc
's
staff
number
by
a
minimum
of
250
in
the
short
term
by
rationalisation
of
agricultural
college
and
location
,
reduce
low
priority
advisory
and
research
activity
,
reduce
administration
and
advisory
service
,
the
latter
by
50
%
,
reduce
education
and
training
function
by
30
%
and
20
%
,
respectively
,
by
2011
and
review
the
network
of
office
.
if
the
economy
be
to
get
back
on
its
foot
,
the
research
,
administrative
and
support
service
provide
by
Teagasc
will
be
necessary
to
ensure
people
operate
in
the
rural
economy
have
the
advantage
they
require
.
I
strongly
suggest
that
the
Minister
of
State
should
defend
the
service
operate
by
Teagasc
,
particularly
scientific
research
where
McCarthy
propose
that
all
research
should
be
codify
in
one
body
.
this
will
not
necessarily
assist
in
agricultural
or
agribusiness
-
related
research
and
this
should
be
revise
and
review
.
with
regard
to
that
people
who
be
employ
by
Teagasc
in
the
agricultural
college
,
a
question
arise
about
they
future
if
this
report
be
implement
.
I
agree
there
be
a
budgetary
process
in
train
but
I
ask
that
this
area
be
defend
.
if
it
be
not
defend
,
and
we
see
post
-
budget
in
2009
and
2010
a
further
reduction
or
diminution
in
the
service
operate
by
Teagasc
,
it
will
have
untold
consequence
for
the
rural
economy
which
we
will
not
stand
over
.
I
tab
a
question
on
the
public
service
number
and
expenditure
programme
.
this
report
be
sanction
by
government
and
make
specific
recommendation
.
when
I
ask
about
this
specific
recommendation
,
with
all
due
respect
to
that
minister
,
I
get
blasé
,
bland
answer
about
the
wonderful
role
of
Teagasc
.
my
question
be
pertinent
to
what
be
in
the
report
.
I
want
to
know
whether
that
service
will
be
defend
;
I
do
not
want
a
answer
that
hide
behind
the
budgetary
process
which
be
still
a
long
way
off
.
we
want
definitive
answer
.
I
ask
that
question
on
behalf
of
that
people
who
live
in
rural
Ireland
,
who
live
beyond
the
so
-
call
Pale
,
and
who
depend
on
this
service
.
the
Agriculture
Council
will
meet
next
week
.
will
that
meeting
give
rise
to
a
new
regulation
regard
a
CMO
,
common
market
organisation
,
for
milk
or
dairy
,
or
will
the
status
quo
remain
for
political
intervention
in
the
market
,
give
that
there
be
a
slight
increase
in
the
price
and
a
slight
recovery
at
present
?
be
the
strategy
within
the
European
Union
to
do
nothing
at
present
?
it
be
possible
a
logical
strategy
would
be
to
wait
to
see
if
there
will
be
a
further
recovery
,
or
will
there
be
further
intervention
?
I
do
not
quite
understand
the
minister
's
original
reply
.
Environmental
measure
,
such
as
water
management
,
will
become
more
prevalent
under
the
CAP
in
future
.
the
question
concern
the
administrative
function
.
there
be
a
suggestion
afoot
that
we
will
move
from
pillar
one
to
pillar
two
and
that
,
instead
of
direct
payment
to
farmer
for
management
of
the
economy
,
it
will
be
administer
through
various
local
organisation
.
that
danger
be
there
,
so
the
question
need
to
be
address
.
it
may
not
be
a
real
fear
,
but
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
minister
's
view
on
that
in
the
first
instance
.
second
,
as
regards
carbon
reduction
,
at
some
stage
there
will
have
to
be
a
internal
debate
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Smith
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sargent
,
as
to
whether
methane
reduction
will
become
a
issue
if
the
process
of
carbon
reduction
become
part
of
the
CAP
regime
.
the
climate
change
agenda
be
also
on
the
card
,
give
the
forthcoming
UN
conference
in
Copenhagen
in
December
.
how
will
we
get
to
a
situation
where
we
do
not
compromise
production
or
market
share
,
while
meet
future
demand
for
food
,
as
well
as
other
target
?
there
will
be
a
internal
battle
within
the
government
on
that
issue
.
it
be
something
that
will
arise
in
the
context
of
the
CAP
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
opinion
from
the
minister
on
this
question
.
I
wish
to
assure
the
deputy
that
the
provision
of
appropriate
educational
intervention
and
support
for
child
with
special
educational
need
continue
to
be
a
key
government
priority
.
this
be
reflect
in
the
fact
that
my
Department
be
the
only
department
other
than
social
Welfare
that
get
a
increase
this
year
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
of
my
commitment
to
ensure
that
all
pupil
,
include
that
with
special
educational
need
,
can
have
access
to
a
education
appropriate
to
they
need
preferably
in
school
setting
through
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
network
.
there
have
be
unprecedented
investment
in
provide
support
for
pupil
with
special
need
in
recent
year
.
there
be
now
about
19000
adult
in
we
school
work
solely
with

.
this
include
over
10000

over

as
well
as
this
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
additional
teacher
and
snas
directly
provide
appropriate
education
and
care
support
for

have
take
place
in
the
provision
of
transport
,
specialist

,

,
assistive

and

.
I
assume
that
the
reference
in
the
correspondence
to
special

be
cut
relate
to
my
Department
's
decision
early
this
year
to
suppress
a
number
of
special
class
for
pupil
with
a
mild
general
learning
disability
(
MGLD
)
.
I
would
like
to
assure
the
deputy
that
there
will
be
no
pupil
with
a
special
educational
need
who
will
be
without
access
to
a
special

teacher
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
apply
the
normal
rule
which
govern
the
appointment
and
retention
of

of

my

examine
the

in

and
find
that
a

of

do
not
have
the

the

all

all

will
be
able
to

the
correspondence
also
refer
to
the
Education
for
Person
with
special
Educational
need
(
Epsen
)
Act
,
2004
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
this
government
be
commit
to
the
full
implementation
of
Epsen
at
the
early
possible
date
.
a
significant
number
of
section
of
the
act
have
already
be
commence
,
principally
that
establish
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
(
NCSE
)
and
that
promote
a
inclusive
approach
to
the
education
of
child
with
special
educational
need
.
in
the
light
of
the
current
financial
circumstance
,
it
be
not
possible
to
proceed
with
full
implementation
in
2010
as
originally
envisage
.
notwithstanding
this
,
a
commitment
have
be
make
in
the
renew
programme
for
government
to
develop
,
in
consultation
with
stakeholder
,
a
cost
multi-annual
plan
to
implement
some
priority
aspect
of
the
Epsen
Act
,
focus
on
measurable
and
practical
progress
in
education
and
health
service
for
child
with
special
need
.
furthermore
,
as
announce
in
the
renew
Programme
for
Government
,
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
(
NEPS
)
will
be
provide
with
funding
for
28
additional
post
to
bring
the
number
of
NEPS
psychologist
to
210
.
this
mean
that
every
school
in
the
country
will
have
access
to
NEPS
which
provide
assessment
and
psychological
advice
for
school
to
enable
they
to
provide
appropriate
support
and
programme
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
renew
Programme
also
commit
the
government
to
no
further
increase
in
the
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
primary
and
second
level
school
for
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
under
the
renew
programme
we
will
provide
500
teaching
post
between
primary
and
second
level
over
the
next
three
year
.
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
emphasise
that
child
with
special
educational
need
will
continue
to
receive
a
education
appropriate
to
they
need
.
I
intend
to
build
on
the
progress
that
have
be
achieve
in
recent
year
which
have
see
a
huge
increase
in
resource
for
special
need
.
the
NCSE
will
continue
to
support
school
,
parent
and
child
and
teacher
and
special

assistant
will
continue
to
be
deploy
to
school
to
meet
child
's

my

the
correspondence
also
refer
to
the
Education
for
Person
with
special
Educational
need
(
Epsen
)
Act
,
2004
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
this
government
be
commit
to
the
full
implementation
of
Epsen
at
the
early
possible
date
.
a
significant
number
of
section
of
the
act
have
already
be
commence
,
principally
that
establish
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
(
NCSE
)
and
that
promote
a
inclusive
approach
to
the
education
of
child
with
special
educational
need
.
in
the
light
of
the
current
financial
circumstance
,
it
be
not
possible
to
proceed
with
full
implementation
in
2010
as
originally
envisage
.
notwithstanding
this
,
a
commitment
have
be
make
in
the
renew
programme
for
government
to
develop
,
in
consultation
with
stakeholder
,
a
cost
multi-annual
plan
to
implement
some
priority
aspect
of
the
Epsen
Act
,
focus
on
measurable
and
practical
progress
in
education
and
health
service
for
child
with
special
need
.
furthermore
,
as
announce
in
the
renew
Programme
for
Government
,
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
(
NEPS
)
will
be
provide
with
funding
for
28
additional
post
to
bring
the
number
of
NEPS
psychologist
to
210
.
this
mean
that
every
school
in
the
country
will
have
access
to
NEPS
which
provide
assessment
and
psychological
advice
for
school
to
enable
they
to
provide
appropriate
support
and
programme
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
renew
Programme
also
commit
the
government
to
no
further
increase
in
the
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
primary
and
second
level
school
for
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
under
the
renew
programme
we
will
provide
500
teaching
post
between
primary
and
second
level
over
the
next
three
year
.
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
emphasise
that
child
with
special
educational
need
will
continue
to
receive
a
education
appropriate
to
they
need
.
I
intend
to
build
on
the
progress
that
have
be
achieve
in
recent
year
which
have
see
a
huge
increase
in
resource
for
special
need
.
the
NCSE
will
continue
to
support
school
,
parent
and
child
and
teacher
and
special
need
assistant
will
continue
to
be
deploy
to
school
to
meet
child
's
need
in
line
with
my
Department
's
policy
.

that
we

the
only
other

avenue
open

the

be
consider

the

on

arise
will
be
a
matter
for
the
government
.
while
I
will
have
to
await
the
outcome

deliberative
process
,
I
can
confirm
that
there
be
no
plan
to
close
small
school
at
the
moment
other
than
that
that
would
arise
in
the
normal
course

I
fully
acknowledge
the
attachment
of
local
community
to
they
school
and
the
association
of
the
school
with
a
sense
of
place
.
however
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
my
Department
will
have
to
examine
the
implementation
of
more
strict
guideline
in
relation
to
the
number
of
pupil
require
for
the
sustainability
of
school
.
the

may

of

attract

within

Schools

I
seek
a

House

issue

I
support

in

it
be
a
fundamental

for

time

I
would
like
to
quote
from
a
academic
analysis
that
suggest
a
additional
unit
of
income
earn
or
gain
by
a
female
be
more
likely
to
be
spend
on
child
care
,
or
child
's
clothing
,
than
a
additional
unit
of
income
earn
or
gain
by
a
male
.
the
report
in
question
,
the
kid
be
alright
:
who
benefit
from
child
benefit
?
a
analysis
use
Irish
data
,
which
be
publish
by
Dr.
David
Madden
in
March
2000
,
state
:
child
benefit
in
Ireland
be
unlike
most
other
transfer
payment
in
two
respects
.
first
,
it
be
a
universal
non
means
-
test
payment
make
to
all
family
with
child
.
the
second
unusual
feature
regard
child
benefit
be
that
it
be
normally
pay
to
the
child
's
mother
or
step
-
mother
.
if
the
child
do
not
live
with
the
mother
or
step
-
mother
,
then
it
may
be
pay
to
the
child
's
father
or
step
-
father
.
the
report
continue
:
the
combination
of
this
two
factor
imply
that
analysis
of
child
benefit
and
the
pattern
of
expenditure
from
child
benefit
can
throw
light
on
a
number
of
feature
of
interest
.
the
first
of
this
concern
the
issue
of
within
household
allocation
.
much
economic
analysis
treat
the
family
as
the
unit
of
measurement
and
little
attention
be
pay
to
the
allocation
of
resource
within
the
household
.
since
child
benefit
be
pay
to
the
mother
then
analysis
of
how
it
be
spend
may
shed
light
on
the
degree
to
which
ownership
of
a
source
of
income
may
affect
its
use
.
Dr.
Madden
's
analysis
refer
to
a
report
publish
in
the
UK
,
which
show
how
:
a
change
in
the
payment
of
child
benefit
from
father
to
mother
lead
to
increase
expenditure
on
child
's
clothing
.
in
a
similar
vein
[
another
report
show
]
the
different
influence
of
male
and
female
income
on
pattern
of
household
expenditure
.
they
find
that
a
extra
unit
of
female
income
be
more
likely
to
be
spend
on
childcare
or
child
's
clothing
than
be
a
extra
unit
of
male
income
.
the
Madden
report
continue
:
if
the
propensity
to
consume
"
child
-
intensive
"
goods
such
as
food
or
child
's
clothing
be
high
from
child
benefit
than
other
source
of
income
then
it
seem
reasonable
to
infer
that
child
do
gain
disproportionately
from
child
benefit
.
the
universality
of
child
benefit
lend
itself
in
particular
to
the
analysis
of
this
issue
since
it
imply
that
apart
from
the
obvious
difference
of
have
child
,
family
receive
child
benefit
should
be
reasonably
representative
of
the
population
at
large
.
Dr.
Madden
also
refer
to
the
1994
Rottman
report
,
which
examine
some
of
this
issue
.
although
it
relate
to
a
original
survey
from
1987
,
I
suggest
that
the
same
principle
continue
to
apply
.
the
report
state
:
he
use
a
sample
of
625
household
who
be
part
of
a
follow
-
up
to
a
major
survey
carry
out
by
the
economic
and
social
Research
Institute
in
1987
.
he
find
that
the
source
of
income
appear
to
be
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
share
of
resource
.
household
with
income
derive
mainly
from
social
welfare
source
share
about
33
%
of
they
income
compare
with
a
average
of
about
63
%
for
other
household
.
with
regard
to
child
benefit
household
appear
to
divide
fairly
evenly
between
that
who
use
it
for
general
household
spending
and
that
who
use
it
for
child
specific
goods
.
that
breakdown
be
sensitive
however
to
who
control
the
spending
of
child
benefit
.
where
it
be
jointly
control
there
be
a
significantly
low
proportion
spend
on
child
's
goods
as
oppose
to
the
case
where
the
wife
[
I
assume
he
mean
"
partner
"
]
control
child
benefit
.
he
also
find
that
when
ask
how
a
windfall
increase
of
£
20
per
month
in
household
income
would
be
spend
,
18
%
of
wife
list
child
's
clothing
as
a
priority
as
oppose
to
10
%
of
husband
.
a
total
of
18
%
of
wife
list
child
's
clothing
as
a
priority
,
as
oppose
to
10
%
of
husband
.
the
fundamental
point
here
be
that
this
a
payment
to
woman
for
they
child
.
it
be
use
in
household
for
child
,
be
protect
by
woman
for
they
child
and
go
directly
towards
the
welfare
of
child
.
although
this
study
may
be
date
,
I
believe
it
stand
the
test
of
time
.
if
the
payment
go
to
woman
for
the
welfare
of
child
,
then
there
be
a
logical
case
for
it
to
be
preserve
,
as
have
already
be
elucidate
by
my
colleague
.
that
be
we
central
point
.
my
Department
's
primary
role
in
the
promotion
of
international
education
be
co-ordination
and
policy
development
,
and
Departmental
official
be
not
second
to
Irish
embassy
for
this
purpose
.
under
the
new
arrangement
which
I
have
recently
put
in
place
to
promote
Ireland
as
a
centre
for
international
education
,
Enterprise
Ireland
have
be
give
operational
responsibility
,
under
my
authority
,
for
the
marketing
and
promotion
of
the
"
Education
Ireland
"
brand
overseas
and
the
development
,
promotion
and
marketing
of
international
high
education
.
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
include
Ireland
's
network
of
diplomatic
mission
,
also
play
a
key
role
in
promote
international
education
,
include
through
awareness
-
raising
,
support
ministerial
visit
,
maintain
contact
with
overseas
government
ministry
and
education
agency
and
lend
support
and
assistance
to
visit
Irish
institution
;
it
work
very
closely
with
Enterprise
Ireland
in
this
regard
.
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
be
represent
on
the
inter-agency
group
on
international
education
which
my
Department
chair
,
and
will
also
be
represent
on
the
high
-
level
group
on
international
education
.
in
order
to
ensure
full
awareness
of
the
issue
involve
in
international
education
,
my
Department
provide
a
full
briefing
to
Irish
Ambassador
and
other
diplomat
prior
to
they
departure
on
overseas
post
.
Proinsias
de
Rossa
never
take
money
off
the
poor
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
speech
where
he
say
that
recent
CSO
datum
show
that
44
%
of
cross
-border
shopper
buy
alcohol
.
this
assume
that
56
%
do
not
buy
alcohol
and
it
presuppose
that
some
people
's
motivation
for
go
across
the
Border
be
primarily
to
buy
alcohol
.
I
do
not
think
it
warrant
the
measure
produce
here
.
there
be
other
way
of
tackle
the
tide
or
stem
the
flow
across
the
Border
.
as
my
colleague
have
also
mention
,
regard
the
cut
in
public
sector
pay
,
5
%
on
a
salary
of
€
35000
,
will
reduce
the
salary
by
€
1500
.
how
in
the
name
of
God
will
that
kind
of
a
reduction
allow
anybody
—
—
—
—
with
a
mortgage
and
child
to
be
able
to
live
any
kind
of
a
decent
life
in
this
country
?
be
this
what
this
republic
have
be
reduce
to
?
it
be
a
absolute
shame
.
it
be
a
bit
surreal
to
see
—
—
—
—
Fianna
Fáil
so
silent
on
this
matter
.
I
refer
to
the
effect
the
carbon
tax
will
have
on
a
public
sector
employee
earn
€
30000
a
year
whose
income
will
be
reduce
by
€
1500
.
the
effect
of
the
carbon
tax
on
vulnerable
,
low
pay
people
will
be
more
pronounce
as
a
result
of
the
cut
that
have
be
effect
.
we
want
the
government
to
do
something
in
real
term
for
they
.
the
budget
be
predicate
on
reduce
the
income
of
the
low
pay
.
the
introduction
of
the
carbon
tax
without
mitigating
its
effect
on
that
on
low
income
be
inequitable
.
I
would
like
the
minister
to
address
this
.
this
have
to
be
address
in
concrete
term
,
not
in
nebulous
or
airy
-
fairy
term
.
this
be
about
real
people
whose
income
be
minuscule
and
the
minister
be
further
marginalise
they
and
cut
they
off
through
imposition
of
this
tax
.
the
Green
Party
minister
do
not
realise
it
because
they
be
on
another
planet
.
they
do
not
inhabit
the
real
world
.
there
be
people
in
the
real
world
outside
this
wall
who
have
be
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
by
minister
who
be
off
save
the
planet
.
they
should
have
a
reality
check
.
we
do
not
oppose
the
carbon
tax
but
we
do
not
want
people
on
low
income
to
be
screw
to
the
wall
.

that
be
not
what
the
minister
indicate
.
I
wish
to
be
helpful
to
the
minister
and
in
no
way
to
appear
facetious
,
but
the
process
be
instigate
by
the
former
Minister
for
social
Welfare
,
Proinsias
de
Rossa
.
a
sum
of
€
400000
plus
.
if
that
on
jobseeker
's
benefit
aged
under
24
be
reside
with
they
parent
,
will
there
be
a
pro
rata
cut
to
reflect
the
parent
's
mean
?
I
have
receive
more
and
more
call
from
parent
whose
son
or
daughter
recently
leave
college
and
be
live
at
home
.
they
have
a
high
dependency
on
the
parental
income
to
give
they
spending
power
.
how
will
they
be
affect
?
the
reduction
in
income
for
claimant
in
this
category
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
because
the
minister
's
announcement
about
additional
training
place
have
not
be
set
out
in
concrete
form
.
we
do
not
know
what
shape
the
place
will
take
or
whether
a
demographic
or
qualitative
study
have
be
conduct
as
to
who
in
this
category
would
sloot
into
the
place
.
we
do
not
know
how
they
will
sloot
in
or
what
type
of
course
they
will
take
up
.
this
be
ill
think
out
.
the
overarching
philosophy
of
the
minister
be
to
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
that
who
most
need
that
marginal
income
without
any
thought
or
lateral
view
of
how
this
might
impact
on
they
.
will
the
minister
outline
how
this
cut
will
affect
that
people
if
they
parent
's
income
be
above
a
certain
level
?
I
fear
for
they
.
for
example
,
if
a
parent
who
work
in
the
public
sector
have
a
income
up
to
€
40000
per
annum
and
have
a
son
or
daughter
who
have
just
graduate
,
it
be
most
likely
that
son
or
daughter
be
now
live
at
home
because
he
or
she
can
not
get
a
job
.
if
that
graduate
son
or
daughter
cannot
find
a
adequate
training
place
because
,
as
have
be
state
,
he
or
she
be
over
qualified
for
the
training
position
,
will
he
or
she
now
be
penalise
through
a
reduce
payment
because
of
refuse
a
training
place
?
what
negative
effect
will
this
have
on
they
income
if
they
live
at
home
.
this
be
issue
of
concern
.
in
talk
about
active
labour
market
mechanism
for
people
who
be
under
the
age
of
25
,
the
minister
should
have
think
a
little
more
laterally
about
put
some
well
think
out
scheme
in
place
before
effect
a
cut
.
deputy
Gogarty
have
now
acquire
a
God
complex
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
if
one
be
shove
somebody
—
—
there
be
approximately
69500
people
aged
under
24
on
the
live
register
.
the
minister
for
Finance
claim
in
he
speech
that
he
will
make
26000
training
place
available
.
therefore
,
we
cannot
force
all
of
that
people
into
training
scheme
because
there
be
simply
not
enough
place
.
many
of
that
be
graduate
who
will
be
over
qualified
for
the
type
of
training
place
I
imagine
will
be
envisage
under
this
proposal
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
parent
,
especially
that
in
the
public
sector
who
be
in
the
€
30000
-
45,000
income
bracket
and
who
have
see
they
income
reduce
,
will
see
a
further
squeeze
on
they
finances
if
they
have
child
who
have
recently
graduate
live
at
home
who
may
not
fit
the
type
of
training
scheme
that
be
envisage
.
under
section
3
,
the
minister
have
already
acknowledge
there
will
be
a
pro
rata
decrease
,
depend
on
means
.
I
understand
that
the
minimum
amount
for
which
somebody
live
at
home
could
be
eligible
be
about
€
30
.
that
be
pocket
money
and
it
reduce
the
dignity
of
people
who
qualify
from
third
level
education
and
who
continue
to
live
at
home
.
there
be
over
69000
people
aged
under
24
on
the
live
register
and
a
significant
number
of
they
be
graduate
who
can
not
get
a
job
.
the
logical
conclusion
—
I
say
this
rationally
and
without
emotion
—
be
that
many
of
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
will
be
oblige
to
migrate
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
to
obtain
employment
.
in
the
past
ten
year
,
Australia
be
the
new
Klondike
and
it
be
a
good
place
for
people
in
they
early
20
to
go
.
however
,
this
choice
be
no
long
available
because
the
employment
situation
in
Australia
be
not
as
good
as
previously
.
it
appear
Canada
be
the
new
Klondike
for
many
people
.
however
,
employment
opportunity
there
will
also
soon
dry
up
.
as
a
result
,
a
significant
number
of
people
under
the
age
of
25
will
be
oblige
to
reside
at
home
with
they
parent
.
this
individual
will
be
oblige
to
survive
on
income
of
€
30
or
€
40
per
week
and
this
will
place
a
increase
burden
on
they
parent
.
what
we
need
in
the
budget
be
some
degree
of
programming
which
would
ensure
that
people
would
not
be
oblige
to
take
up
position
on
Mickey
Mouse
course
in
order
to
maintain
they
social
welfare
payment
.
the
government
should
have
put
in
place
a
proper
,
well
think
out
,
structure
programme
of
internship
.
this
would
have
allow
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
to
use
the
knowledge
and
qualification
they
possess
.
the
minister
should
think
about
thing
in
a
more
lateral
fashion
.
if
she
be
go
to
put
in
place
scheme
,
this

out

person
's
entitlement
should
not
be
cut
until
they
can
be
give
position
on
meaningful
course
or
be
provide
with

.
if
they
be
afford
such
opportunity
,
it
will
assist
they
in

back
into
the

.

what
about

this

generation
of
politician

mandarin
who
have
they
mortgage
pay
and
have
,
for
the
most
part
,
rear
they
child

it
show
blatant
disregard
for
people
of
my
generation
who
will
end
up

saddle
with
the
burden
of
the
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
for
the
rest
of
they
work
life
.
if
we
be
to
inject
some
equity
into
the
process
of
economic
recovery
,
it
must
be
do
on
the
basis
that
everybody
will
take
the
pain
equally
.
one
cannot
take
€
1500
from
somebody
in
the
public
sector
who
be
earn
€
30000
or
€
1,875
from
somebody
who
be
earn
€
35000
,
while
introduce
a
carbon
tax
which
will
affect
the
ability
of
such
people
to
get
to
and
from
they
place
of
work
on
a
daily
basis
.
such
people
will
also
be
affect
by
the
impact
on
they
of
the
potential
mortgage
increase
they
may
incur
in
the
future
.
I
have
a
short
time
in
which
to
speak
on
this
issue
.
it
be
a
sad
indictment
of
this
Parliament
that
we
cannot
debate
this
measure
in
a
proper
fashion
with
real
discourse
.
the
strike
by
the
public
sector
be
ill
-
time
,
in
that
we
all
have
to
buy
into
the
idea
that
there
would
be
a
reduction
in
the
public
sector
pay
bill
.
I
also
believe
in
the
bona
fide
of
a
government
and
a
trade
union
hierarchy
to
hammer
out
a
deal
that
would
ensure
that
earn
income
of
less
then
€
50000
would
not
incur
any
further
pain
as
a
result
of
measure
which
might
have
to
be
implement
and
that
earn
between
€
50000
and
€
100000
,
would
have
a
minuscule
percentage
cut
in
they
salary
and
they
would
be
benchmark
against
cut
in
the
private
sector
.
we
have
a
situation
whereby
a
single
person
who
earn
€
52000
per
annum
in
the
private
sector
incur
no
cut
to
he
or
she
salary
,
but
somebody
who
earn
€
50000
in
the
public
sector
will
incur
a
cut
of
€
3000
or
6
%
.
there
be
no
equity
in
such
a
situation
.
if
anybody
in
the
government
tell
we
that
everybody
have
to
incur
pain
,
the
proof
of
that
view
be
not
evident
in
such
budgetary
measure
.
I
be
quote
from
the
very
document
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Lenihan
,
lay
before
the
House
when
he
announce
he
budget
last
week
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
a
review
of
the
cut
to
people
on
the
low
end
of
the
public
sector
wage
scale
.
one
cannot
expect
a
single
female
clerical
officer
who
work
in
a
local
authority
,
have
take
out
a
mortgage
in
the
past
three
year
and
now
have
to
pay
increase
charge
for
she
petrol
to
get
to
work
to
incur
a
cut
of
€
1500
to
€
2200
in
she
salary
.
it
be
completely
inequitable
.
I
know
it
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Mansergh
,
in
he
heart
of
heart
,
know
it
.
I
believe
he
word
be
correct
,
he
tell
we
to
reverse
the
cut
would
cost
the
Exchequer
€
500
million
.
he
never
examine
the
quasi-autonomous
non-governmental
organisation
.
he
do
not
adequately
examine
that
earn
more
than
€
250000
.
it
be
time
the
government
look
equitably
at
that
who
will
now
bear
the
brunt
.
the
new
poor
now
exist
in
we
society
.
a
person
who
incur
a
cut
of
€
1500
will
not
be
able
to
survive
in
real
term
and
the
government
should
not
patronise
such
people
by
tell
they
it
have
reduce
the
cost
of
live
by
6
%
because
that
will
not
wash
.

perhaps
I
be
a
product
of
my
agrarian
or
peasant
root
,
but
—
—
—
—-
I
believe
we
need
to
start
slaughter
a
few
sacred
cow
in
this
great
republic
of
ours
.
when
somebody
in
the
public
service
have
to
incur
a
cut
of
€
1
,
500
in
he
or
she
salary
and
a
member
of
the
Judiciary
be
exempt
by
virtue
of
a
constitutional
arrangement
,
that
speak
volume
about
the
nature
of
the
society
in
the
Republic
.
if
Ireland
,
as
a
republic
,
be
to
treat
and
cherish
everybody
equally
,
and
if
we
subscribe
to
the
French
principle
of
liberté
,
None
and
fraternité
of
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
of
State
be
aware
,
then
we
should
have
no
qualm
in
this
troubling
time
about
reduce
the
salary
of
the
member
of
the
Judiciary
.
I
believe
we
be
unduly
deferential
to
people
who
hold
such
position
.
while
we
be
respectful
of
the
role
they
have
and
of
the
constitutional
arrangement
as
regards
the
separation
of
power
,
I
do
not
believe
they
should
be
exempt
from
such
cut
by
virtue
of
a
legal
advice
that
have
be
give
to
the
government
.
we
rely
too
much
on
such
legal
advice
matter
and
hold
they
in
too
great
a
stock
,
because
sometimes
they
supersede
what
be
fair
and
equitable
in
term
of
how
the
common
man
or
woman
might
perceive
such
question
.
I
gladly
support
the
amendment
that
have
be
tab
on
the
basis
of
it
be
equitable
and
right
for
this
country
at
this
time

the
Bill
allow
Coillte
to
increase
its
requirement
significantly
.
in
that
light
,
the
amount
of
time
designate
for
the
Bill
be
far
too
short
.
we
need
a
proper
and
lengthy
debate
on
the
nature
and
working
of
Coillte
.
on
the
same
issue
,
what
credence
do
this
house
give
to
a
ombudsman
's
report
?
if
we
do
not
respond
to
the
ombudsman
's
report
,
it
would
be
a
dereliction
of
duty
.
it
be
right
and
proper
that
this
house
give
some
time
to
debate
the
issue
at
least
.
she
be
very
expensive
.
I
find
myself
in
a
ludicrous
situation
in
that
I
must
thank
deputy
Creed
for
allow
I
some
of
he
time
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
allow
some
of
my
time
to
deputy
Ferris
,
with
whom
I
be
to
share
my
time
.
why
do
we
find
ourselves
in
circumstance
where
I
have
merely
two
or
three
minute
to
discuss
a
princely
sum
that
could
potentially
amount
to
€400
million
?
I
do
not
have
adequate
time
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
ceo
of
Coillte
be
be
pay
over
€
400000
at
a
time
when
the
subsidiary
under
Coillte
be
completely
under
-
perform
,
nor
do
I
have
time
to
analyse
properly
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
,
in
which
he
state
€
1.89
billion
,
or
just
under
1
%
of
gdp
,
be
attribute
to
forestry
.
that
figure
be
from
2008
but
it
will
be
reduce
significantly
in
the
future
give
that
the
subsidiary
be
under-
perform
.
I
want
time
to
discuss
this
in
great
detail
.
I
also
want
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
Forest
Stewardship
Council
audite
Coillte
in
2006
and
that
this
be
not
mention
in
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
.
the
result
of
the
audit
cast
a
poor
light
on
some
of
Coillte
's
practice
that
be
worthy
of
consideration
in
respect
of
this
Bill
.
I
want
to
discuss
the
fact
that
Coillte
be
currently
be
audite
by
the
Forest
Stewardship
Council
.
will
the
minister
expound
on
that
process
?
if
there
be
time
,
I
will
allow
some
to
deputy
Ferris
.
the
Bill
seek
the
permission
of
the
House
to
afford
to
Coillte
the
opportunity
to
increase
its
statutory
borrowing
requirement
from
€
101.5
million
to
€400
million
.
in
he
second
stage
speech
,
the
Minister
of
State
point
out
that
inflation
alone
would
allow
a
increase
in
the
borrowing
limit
to
€
182.5
million
.
this
be
base
on
inflate
the
€
101.5
million
limit
in
1988
by
Ireland
's
inflation
rate
up
to
October
2009
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
we
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
that
assertion
?
Coillte
's
borrowing
to
the
end
of
1988
be
€
161.2
million
and
it
have
approval
to
borrow
up
to
€
260
million
under
section
24
(
1
)
and
(
2
)
of
the
Forestry
Act
1988
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
a
good
overview
of
Coillte
's
working
,
the
direction
it
want
to
take
in
corporate
planning
and
the
working
group
establish
to
review
its
operation
.
there
be
no
mention
,
however
,
of
the
pension
deficit
,
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
company
's
operation
,
or
the
chief
executive
officer
's
and
the
board
's
remuneration
.
there
be
also
question
surround
a
Forestry
Stewardship
Council
report
which
indict
some
aspect
of
Coillte
's
operation
.
the
Labour
Party
would
be
reluctant
to
support
any
mechanism
to
allow
for
a
increase
in
a
company
's
borrowing
requirement
unless
there
be
some
degree
of
transparency
in
its
operation
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
second
Stage
speech
do
not
sufficiently
address
this
matter
.
the
company
's
report
and
account
also
do
not
address
this
issue
.
when
Coillte
attend
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
October
,
one
get
the
impression
everything
be
rosy
in
the
garden
.
there
be
,
however
,
some
difficulty
for
ancillary
firm
such
as
Mediate
and
other
with
the
downturn
in
the
construction
industry
and
this
be
reflect
in
they
result
.
what
be
the
future
for
this
firm
?
I
do
not
see
enough
report
back
to
this
House
on
how
this
operation
will
proceed
and
they
individual
financial
position
.
be
the
new
borrowing
requirement
to
facilitate
any
of
this
offshoot
company
?
what
will
the
nature
of
they
financial
position
be
as
a
result
of
this
amending
legislation
?
before
the
House
be
request
to
up
Coillte
's
borrowing
requirement
,
it
require
more
information
as
to
how
it
do
business
.
person
tend
to
look
favourably
on
Coillte
's
operation
because
of
the
recreational
and
amenity
value
of
its
work
.
I
have
benefit
from
they
myself
in
the
Ballyhouras
and
there
be
a
certain
pride
in
how
Coillte
have
develop
amenity
well
.
with
the
Copenhagen
summit
agenda
,
there
be
the
political
consideration
of
the
role
of
forestry
in
reduce
or
offset
co2
emission
.
will
the
increase
in
permissible
borrowing
go
towards
facilitate
this
process
?
if
so
,
will
Coillte
have
a
significant
role
in
that
process
?
I
would
also
like
the
Minister
of
State
to
address
the
issue
of
the
role
of
the
Forestry
Stewardship
Council
.
it
be
hope
,
give
the
2006
report
and
the
audit
under
way
,
that
there
would
be
significant
improvement
in
corporate
social
responsibility
and
the
role
of
corporate
governance
in
respect
of
how
Coillte
perform
its
function
.
fundamentally
,
we
need
a
little
more
transparency
in
regard
to
the
operation
of
Coillte
.
while
we
all
believe
that
it
be
a
force
to
do
good
,
there
be
aspect
of
its
operation
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
leave
doubt
in
one
's
mind
.
be
the
agency
to
be
a
little
more
transparent
there
would
be
a
great
deal
more
goodwill
towards
measure
such
as
this
.
I
refer
to
the
issue
of
inflation
,
the
1988
Act
and
the
minister
's
response
to
question
put
.
my
understanding
of
the
Forestry
Act
1988
be
that
at
any
one
time
the
aggregate
borrowing
of
the
company
should
not
exceed
£
80
million
or
€
101.5
million
in
today
's
money
.
the
Minister
of
State
state
borrowing
have
reach
€
182.5
million
in
October
2009
and
that
this
be
account
for
by
inflation
.
perhaps
I
misunderste
the
legislation
or
I
be
naive
but
my
understanding
be
the
figure
set
out
in
the
1988
act
be
finite
and
definitive
and
that
there
be
no
allowance
for
inflation
within
the
1988
Act
.
perhaps
my
interpretation
be
wrong
and
,
if
so
,
I
will
stand
correct
.
if
borrowing
increase
beyond
the
limit
at
any
time
between
1988
and
2009
there
should
have
be
a
amendment
to
the
1988
act
to
facilitate
such
a
change
long
before
now
.
the
importance
of
the
point
be
that
if
the
Minister
of
State
allow
for
inflation
or
if
such
a
measure
be
not
in
the
1988
Act
,
then
the
government
should
have
amend
the
legislation
long
before
now
and
this
raise
a
question
over
any
borrowing
in
excess
of
€
101.5
million
in
the
intervene
period
.
will
the
minister
of
State
clarify
this
for
my
satisfaction
and
understanding
?
I
refer
to
the
Fine
Gael
amendment
,
which
be
reasonable
because
the
tone
of
the
debate
from
the
Opposition
side
of
the
House
have
be
such
to
ensure
Coillte
be
subject
to
a
great
degree
of
scrutiny
.
as
we
state
,
Coillte
be
before
the
committee
and
there
be
no
mention
of
potential
for
increase
its
borrowing
requirement
at
that
stage
.
that
throw
up
a
question
about
the
role
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
when
witness
from
the
semi-State
sector
report
to
the
committee
,
be
they
oblige
,
in
the
interest
of
transparency
,
to
let
member
know
what
they
strategic
requirement
be
,
particularly
with
regard
to
borrowing
?
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
.
question
regard
the
remuneration
of
the
chief
executive
officer
and
other
high
-
rank
staff
be
not
answer
adequately
by
the
Minister
of
State
.
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
the
borrowing
be
for
the
purpose
of
remuneration
or
to
meet
deficit
in
the
pension
.
I
understand
the
Minister
of
State
say
this
would
be
deal
with
in
further
legislation
but
it
be
also
pertinent
to
this
Bill
,
in
particular
,
to
the
amendment

down
by
Fine
Gael

Party

I
seek
the
adjournment
of
the
Dáil
under
Standing
Order
32
to
raise
a
matter
of
national
importance
,
namely
,
the
current
appalling
condition
of
road
in
County
Cork
;
and
to
ask
the
Minister
for
Transport
to
increase
funding
for
the
maintenance
of
county
and
non-national
road
in
that
county
,
and
to
examine
why
the
road
network
in
County
Cork
be
severely
under
-
fund
and
why
funding
for
roadway
in
Cork
be
considerably
low
per
kilometre
compare
to
most
other
county
in
the
State
.
the
net

make

,
after
the
deduction

I
understand
from

that
the

be
currently
be
finalise
.
no
further
payment
be
make
directly
by
my
Department
's
School
Transport
section
to
any
subsidiary
of
cie
.
that
be
extremely
disingenuous
.
where
else
in
the
world
would
a
government
hide
behind
a
Supreme
Court
judgment
and
use
it
as
a
excuse
for
not
hold
a
open
and
inform
inquiry
?
in
no
other
liberal
democracy
would
a
minister
for
finance
stand
before
the
legislature
and
,
in
address
he
justification
for
a
inquiry
behind
close
door
,
refer
in
one
form
or
another
and
on
no
less
than
six
occasion
to
the
global
international
crisis
,
while
omit
to
refer
to
the
political
climate
underpin
the
anatomy
of
the
crisis
or
the
political
decision
make
that
be
inherent
to
its
very
character
.
it
be
extraordinary
that
the
commission
of
investigation
will
not
reach
into
the
domestic
political
decision
which
give
rise
to
the
crisis
.
that
minister
for
Finance
will
not
be
subject
to
examination
or
hold
accountable
for
they
action
be
ludicrous
.
I
be
not
sure
if
deputy
on
the
government
bench
be
aware
of
how
ridiculous
this
sound
to
people
.
the
Labour
Party
do
not
seek
retribution
,
a
issue
allude
to
by
other
,
but
it
be
entitle
to
seek
to
have
answer
provide
in
public
to
question
surround
the
role
of
the
Financial
Regulator
.
why
be
the
regulator
able
to
ride
out
of
"
Dodge
City
"
with
a
€
600,000
pay
-
out
without
be
subject
to
a
analysis
of
he
performance
or
at
least
some
scrutiny
of
he
decision
?
we
also
seek
a
answer
in
public
to
the
question
as
to
why
Anglo
Irish
Bank
continue
to
exist
.
we
want
to
know
the
reason
analyst
in
the
city
of
London
be
bay
for
a
kill
when
a
substantial
shareholder
in
the
bank
could
no
long
cover
he
position
.
how
could
one
individual
build
up
a
stake
of
28
%
in
Anglo
Irish
Bank
through
numerous
contract
for
difference
?
the
hedge
fund
have
a
field
day
on
that
issue
and
no
one
in
the
Office
of
the
Financial
Regulator
call
time
on
the
madness
.
I
be
sure
we
will
never
know
the
reason
because
a
open
inquiry
will
not
allow
we
to
ask
this
very
question
.
instead
,
we
will
have
to
continue
to
read
the
business
page
of
the
broadsheet
newspaper
to
glean
the
knowledge
we
so
desperately
need
to
make
honest
appraisal
.
if
there
be
a
sound
economic
logic
for
the
continuance
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
,
let
the
case
be
make
publicly
in
order
that
that
who
elect
we
can
adjudicate
for
themselves
.
as
a
society
we
need
to
learn
valuable
lesson
from
this
period
in
we
economic
history
.
we
want
minister
for
finance
to
be
subject
to
rigorous
question
in
the
public
interest
.
the
only
way
we
can
achieve
this
be
through
a
transparent
process
that
stand
up
to
political
scrutiny
.
by
not
have
this
inquiry
in
public
we
add
to
the
moral
turpitude
that
have
underpin
this
society
for
too
long
.
we
want
the
fact
to
fit
the
preconception
.
as
long
as
a
veil
of
secrecy
exist
,
we
will
not
make
the
change
that
be
necessary
to
move
on
in
a
real
sense
.
I
be
pleased
to
inform
the
deputy
that
the
board
of
management
be
recently

when

how
will
the
pothole
be
fix
?
the
minister
have
not
yet
declare
Cork
a
independent
republic
,
so
we
be
reassure
.
I
raise
this
matter
to
highlight
the
potential
for
exploitation
within
the
work
placement
programme
.
I
call
on
the
Tánaiste
and
minister
for
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
,
deputy
Mary
Coughlan
,
to
instigate
a
review
of
the
programme
to
ensure
this
do
not
take
place
.
I
understand
that
many
employer
have
sign
up
for
this
scheme
,
under
which
they
can
employ
a
full
-
time
worker
for
free
.
it
do
not
cost
the
employer
a
penny
;
the
Department
foot
the
bill
by
offer
that
who
secure
a
place
on
the
programme
a
weekly
payment
of
approximately
€
200
,
which
be
considerably
less
than
the
minimum
wage
.
the
aim
of
the
scheme
be
to
allow
graduate
and
other
person
to
learn
a
new
skill
and
gain
experience
,
which
be
important
in
the
current
climate
.
however
,
many
of
the
job
advertisement
under
the
work
placement
programme
specify
that
the
candidate
must
be
experience
and
,
in
some
case
,
that
he
or
she
must
be
able
to
work
unsupervised
.
this
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
programme
.
there
be
currently
over
800
work
placement
programme
job
list
in
the
FÁS
job
bank
.
among
this
position
be
sale
representative
,
receptionist
,
caretaker
,
laundry
operative
and
construction
worker
.
there
be
a
six
-
to
nine
-
month
training
period
for
each
of
this
job
.
the
question
arise
of
whether
work
in
a
laundry
for
six
to
nine
month
will
offer
any
real
progression
and
thus
whether
such
job
be
of
any
real
value
for
graduate
.
this
be
why
I
be
seek
the
review
.
it
be
evident
to
I
that
the
work
placement
programme
could
be
use
as
a
means
of
exploit
well
-
qualified
employee
by
provide
work
that
offer
no
real
opportunity
for
advancement
.
for
graduate
who
have
no
previous
experience
of
they
choose
field
and
who
do
not
qualify
for
a
social
welfare
payment
,
the
work
placement
programme
have
its
merit
.
for
other
,
this
programme
offer
absolutely
no
benefit
but
actually
come
at
a
cost
when
travelling
expense
be
deduct
from
the
already
meagre
payment
of
€
200
per
week
.
the
only
winner
here
be
the
employer
,
who
get
a
worker
for
up
to
nine
month
for
nothing
.
the
minister
must
revisit
this
scheme
urgently
,
as
FÁS
be
give
the
green
light
to
employ
staff
for
work
under
the
guise
of
a
training
scheme
for
which
candidate
be
grossly
overqualified
.
she
should
also
consider
require
the
employer
to
pay
some
salary
or
expense
so
the
person
be
at
least
earn
a
living
wage
while
work
a
full
week
.
we
argue
that
they
should
at
least
be
earn
the
minimum
wage
,
if
that
be
possible
.
a
testimonial
on
the
scheme
be
post
on
w
''
I
think
the
work
placement
programme
be
a
good
idea
but
a
person
would
only
be
earn
the
€
196
(
pay
by
the
social
welfare
)
for
a
full
week
's
work
.
while
I
agree
that
any
kind
of
work
look
good
on
you
CV
this
small
amount
of
money
have
make
the
uptake
of
this
programme
very
slow
''
.
in
essence
we
be
seek
to
prevent
the
exploitation
of
worker
.
if
the
scheme
be
design
so
that
people
can
progress

in
furtherance
of
the
last
point
make
by
deputy
Rabbitte
,
the
fact
this
be
a
windfall
tax
on
landowner
whose
son
or
daughter
may
seek
to
build
a
house
near
the
family
home
in
a
rural
area
,
base
on
a
genuine
housing
need
,
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
re-examine
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
to
the
issue
of
the
carbon
tax
and
the
permutation
of
that
tax
for
the
agricultural
sector
.
speak
as
a
deputy
of
the
Labour
Party
,
a
party
with
no
apparent
natural
tie
with
the
agricultural
sector
,
it
could
be
argue
that
anything
we
may
say
on
this
subject
will
not
always
be
take
seriously
by
that
who
operate
within
the
rural
economy
.
I
want
to
put
on
record
that
what
be
vital
to
the
recovery
of
this
economy
be
how
the
rural
economy
will
thrive
.
the
imposition
of
the
carbon
tax
,
for
example
,
particularly
as
it
pertain
to
mark
gas
oil
or
agricultural
diesel
,
will
have
a
severe
impact
in
term
of
the
cost
input
for
that
who
operate
within
the
agricultural
sector
.
be
they
primary
producer
or
agricultural
contractor
,
the
very
fact
a
tax
of
this
nature
be
be
levy
at
8.7
%
when
road
diesel
be
at
4.4
%
will
cause
a
undue
cost
impact
for
that
who
be
operate
within
this
sector
,
and
it
need
to
be
revise
.
there
be
a
irony
to
the
situation
.
for
the
multiple
such
as
Tesco
,
they
lorry
on
the
road
be
subject
to
a
tax
of
4.4
%
whereas
the
primary
producer
such
as
the
farmer
who
be
produce
for
the
multiple
be
be
levy
at
8.7
%
,
which
will
put
a
further
squeeze
on
that
primary
producer
in
term
of
they
ability
to
supply
goods
into
the
market
.
this
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
take
on
board
,
particularly
by
the
Green
wing
of
the
government
,
who
have
herald
this
carbon
tax
as
the
dawn
of
a
new
age
.
in
principle
,
we
be
all
in
favour
of
the
tax
,
but
it
have
to
be
on
the
basis
that
it
be
levy
with
some
degree
of
equity
and
fairness
.
I
do
not
believe
a
proper
analysis
be
undertake
of
this
measure
before
it
be
decide
upon
.
it
should
be
revise
and
revisit
because
it
have
not
be
cost
and
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
very
recovery
that
be
necessary
for
this
economy
,
particularly
in
term
of
how
the
rural
economy
weigh
into
that
recovery
.
I
would
like
a
response
from
the
minister
on
this
issue
when
he
be
reply
to
the
debate
.
I
wish
to
refer
the
chair
to
a
e-mail
I
receive
from
a
farmer
who
be
directly
impact
as
a
result
of
this
proposal
.
he
state
:
I
too
have
no
problem
with
ct
[
carbon
tax
]
but
only
if
it
be
deal
out
in
fair
way
.
to
I
it
seem
that
this
tax
at
nearly
double
the
road
%
be
a
tax
on
production
.
...
another
concern
I
would
have
be
that
see
new
engine
in
tractor
be
go
to
cost
on
average
between
20
%
-
50
%
more
than
now
,
this
tax
would
be
a
barrier
to
clean
and
new
emission
target
machine
be
use
in
agriculture
,
as
people
will
just
make
do
[
that
be
to
say
,
make
do
with
exist
machinery
]
.
it
be
a
fact
that
this
new
tractor
burn
more
fuel
due
to
the
nature
of
the
emission
recycling
that
go
on
.
...
by
hook
or
crook
everyone
in
agriculture
will
be
affect
by
the
rise
,
any
contractor
will
just
have
to
pass
it
on
to
customer
,
and
they
be
find
it
hard
enough
to
get
pay
as
it
be
.
we
need
to
take
a
more
lateral
view
as
to
how
the
carbon
tax
will
be
implement
.
from
a
agricultural
perspective
,
it
be
prove
that
agricultural
income
be
down
significantly
in
2009
—
the
figure
be
there
for
everybody
to
see
.
if
one
be
operate
a
large
-
scale
farm
unit
,
the
chance
be
one
will
be
able
to
absorb
the
extra
cost
because
one
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
however
,
in
the
case
of
a
small
farmer
,
such
as
a
hillside
farmer
or
sheep
farmer
on
a
small
margin
,
any
increase
in
cost
of
this
nature
could
have
the
potential
to
put
that
farmer
out
of
business
.
we
need
to
revise
this
mechanism
on
that
basis
alone
.
I
keep
come
back
to
the
idea
that
if
the
agricultural
sector
be
to
form
a
part
of
we
economic
recovery
,
what
we
must
not
do
be
place
a
undue
burden
on
the
cost
of
production
.
the
cost
of
production
,
if
one
consider
the
overall
economy
,
have
to
be
the
same
for
agriculture
as
they
be
for
the
lorry
that
supply
Tesco
and
the
other
multiple
,
which
take
they
primary
product
from
that
same
primary
producer
.
we
need
equity
in
this
regard
.
I
also
refer
the
chair
to
the
proposal
by
the
Irish
Farmers
's
Association
,
which
state
:
Farm
diesel
have
excise
duty
charge
at
a
low
rate
than
road
diesel
or
petrol
.
furthermore
,
the
rate
of
vat
apply
be
the
low
rate
of
13.5
%
as
compare
with
21
%
for
normal
automotive
fuel
.
the
low
rate
of
excise
duty
also
apply
to
farm
diesel
in
other
EU
country
.
this
demonstrate
recognition
by
government
and
at
EU
level
that
a
low
rate
of
taxation
be
appropriate
for
farm
diesel
,
which
be
exclusively
use
in
agricultural
production
,
than
be
apply
to
other
motor
fuel
.
again
,
we
need
to
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
agricultural
diesel
,
by
its
very
nature
,
be
use
on
-
farm
and
primarily
for
agricultural
related
purpose
—
or
it
should
be
—
and
,
therefore
,
if
its
cost
to
the
farmer
be
increase
,
many
farmer
will
be
wipe
out
,
particularly
that
in
marginal
area
.
I
ask
the
government
to
revise
this
provision
.
my
Department
have
not
receive
a
application
for
home
tuition
on
behalf
of
the
child
in
question
.
I
have
arrange
for
a
application
form
to
issue
to
he
parent
at
the
address
supply
by
the
deputy
.
the
spectre
of
Abbeylara
have
hang
over
this
house
for
some
time
,
predate
my
membership
.
this
Bill
represent
a
honest
approach
to
deal
with
the
legality
surround
that
judgment
,
which
would
put
the
issue
to
bed
once
and
for
all
in
order
that
the
legislative
function
we
have
relative
to
the
executive
can
be
deal
with
in
a
meaningful
way
.
it
be
about
time
—
I
say
this
as
somebody
who
enter
the
Dáil
for
the
first
time
in
2007
—
this
issue
be
deal
with
in
a
substantive
way
.
I
wish
to
outline
some
of
the
principal
feature
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
worth
read
this
into
the
record
because
they
be
so
clear
it
be
difficult
to
fathom
why
they
would
not
be
accept
by
the
government
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
address
a
press
need
to
restore
the
status
of
the
Oireachtas
vis
-à
-
vis
the
executive
.
in
particular
,
we
need
to
address
the
view
that
the
Supreme
Court
decision
in
the
Abbeylara
case
have
put
a
end
to
any
possibility
of
inquiry
by
a
Oireachtas
committee
.
we
reject
the
view
that
,
short
of
constitutional
change
,
there
be
now
no
lawful
means
of
hold
a
parliamentary
inquiry
.
we
do
accept
,
however
,
that
legislation
be
require
to
address
the
defect
identify
by
the
court
in
that
case
,
hence
this
Bill
.
I
stand
before
you
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
as
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
and
Regulatory
affair
,
which
have
deal
with
a
number
of
banker
in
recent
year
.
we
have
have
the
spectre
of
Abbeylara
hang
over
we
in
that
every
time
a
witness
come
before
the
committee
we
need
to
be
careful
about
how
we
question
he
or
she
.
the
issue
of
compellability
also
loom
large
over
the
proceedings
,
as
member
will
see
if
they
check
the
record
of
the
committee
from
the
past
number
of
year
.
let
we
fast
forward
to
the
announcement
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
that
a
private
inquiry
would
be
hold
.
it
beggar
belief
that
the
government
would
hide
behind
a
Supreme
Court
judgment
as
a
excuse
for
not
hold
such
a
inquiry
in
public
.
that
be
a
affront
to
any
member
of
this
House
who
put
he
or
she
name
on
a
ballot
paper
and
seek
to
represent
the
people
.
it
allow
for
the
possibility
that
people
who
may
have
be
responsible
for
undermine
we
banking
system
and
we
very
economic
structure
will
hide
behind
such
a
judgment
as
a
attempt
not
to
answer
question
in
a
public
forum
—
what
I
would
call
the
tribune
of
the
people
.
the
people
demand
that
the
issue
be
deal
with
in
a
meaningful
way
,
and
this
Bill
do
so
.
I
ask
that
the
government
seriously
consider
accept
the
Bill
.
it
be
right
and
proper
—
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
banking
crisis
—
that
minister
for
finance
,
they
official
,
and
various
actor
within
the
banking
sector
should
be
subject
to
rigorous
question
in
the
public
interest
and
within
the
public
domain
on
the
basis
that
the
taxpayer
have
bail
out
some
of
that
very
institution
,
which
have
receive
a
guarantee
under
the
auspices
of
the
State
.
it
be
only
right
that
we
have
such
proceedings
in
public
.
any
excuse
that
might
be
put
forward
by
minister
that
they
be
restrict
in
do
so
by
virtue
of
a
Supreme
Court
decision
will
be
deal
with
by
this
legislation
,
which
will
prevent
any
excuse
for
not
have
such
public
inquiry
.
it
be
not
right
or
proper
that
somebody
who
be
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
,
which
have
a
particular
remit
in
respect
of
the
banking
sector
,
would
need
to
glean
he
information
from
the
business
page
of
the
Sunday
paper
.
when
I
read
the
Sunday
Times
or
the
Sunday
Tribune
on
any
Sunday
,
the
amount
of
leakage
on
issue
surround
Anglo
Irish
Bank
tell
I
that
the
government
be
selectively
talk
to
journalist
.
that
subvert
the
very
role
of
a
committee
such
as
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
—
or
any
other
committee
of
the
House
.
the
government
,
if
it
adopt
a
historical
perspective
—
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
conscious
of
this
—
will
admit
that
it
must
be
see
by
the
people
to
be
do
right
,
and
the
only
way
it
can
do
this
be
by
conduct
its
affair
in
a
public
fashion
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
a
meeting
of
the
northern
committee
of
Cork
County
Council
take
place
yesterday
at
which
a
decision
be
announce
to
dispose
of
up
to
106
affordable
unit
,
under
the
auspices
of
Cork
County
Council
,
51
of
which
be
to
be
dispose
of
through
local
auctioneer
and
the
remain
55
through
the
social
leasing
scheme
announce
by
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Michael
Finneran
,
some
time
ago
.
I
be
concerned
that
this
house
will
not
sell
on
the
open
market
.
there
be
not
a
snowball
's
chance
in
hell
that
they
will
sell
on
the
open
market
.
there
be
a
over
supply
of
affordable
house
within
local
authority
and
,
particularly
,
within
the
northern
division
of
Cork
County
Council
.
I
be
sceptical
about
any
attempt
by
Cork
County
Council
to
use
the
social
leasing
scheme
because
that
will
come
under
the
ambit
of
the
housing
association
.
anybody
who
take
up
residence
in
any
of
that
55
house
which
come
under
the
social
leasing
scheme
will
never
have
a
opportunity
to
purchase
that
house
.
any
person
who
may
be
on
a
affordable
housing
list
and
who
may
be
eligible
for
financing
will
not
consider
go
down
that
road
if
it
mean
that
for
the
duration
of
that
lease
he
or
she
cannot
own
the
house
.
I
be
also
of
the
view
that
the
51
house
it
be
propose
to
sell
on
the
open
market
will
not
be
sell
.
I
propose
that
there
must
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
on
the
part
of
the
minister
when
deal
with
local
authority
in
respect
of
housing
issue
.
if
the
106
house
to
which
I
refer
be
advertise
as
rent
-
to
-
buy
type
letting
,
they
could
then
be
occupy
,
which
be
extremely
important
.
after
two
or
three
year
,
the
occupant
could
then
decide
whether
they
wish
to
purchase
that
house
.
in
one
estate
in
the
Mitchelstown
area
there
be
20
house
,
ten
of
which
will
be
dispose
of
through
the
social
leasing
scheme
while
the
other
ten
will
be
dispose
of
through
the
affordable
housing
scheme
.
for
every
day
this
house
remain
unoccupied
,
problem
arise
in
the
estate
to
which
I
refer
.
if
its
be
leave
to
auctioneer
to
try
to
sell
this
house
in
a
market
in
which
no
one
be
buy
,
I
contend
that
they
will
remain
unoccupied
for
some
time
.
I
put
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
a
degree
more
flexibility
and
lateral
thinking
would
provide
people
who
be
live
in
the
area
with
the
opportunity
to
rent
that
house
.
they
could
do
so
through
the
social
housing
scheme
or
through
a
rent
-
to
-
buy
scheme
,
under
which
they
could
eventually
decide
to
buy
if
the
opportunity
arise
.
this
would
constitute
a
more
common
-
sense
and
practical
approach
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
unoccupied
house
in
certain
estate
.
since
2008
my
Department
have
undertake
a
number
of
measure
as
part
of
the
government
's
programme
for
the
rationalisation

most

in

I
should

to

the

it
be

occur

.
however
,
the
amalgamate

not
be

as
the

I
be
make
the
same
argument
here
as
I
do
on
Committee
stage
.
look
at
the
legislation
in
the
main
,
it
be
about
the
transposition
of
a
directive
which
be
complete
in
2006
.
we
have
to
look
at
the
historical
perspective
and
the
fact
that
the
directive
be
initiate
as
a
result
,
in
particular
,
of
the
Madrid
bombing
.
it
be
a
counter
-
terrorism
response
relate
to
that
period
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
a
number
of
year
have
past
and
we
be
move
towards
the
final
transposition
of
that
directive
now
.
we
view
be
that
some
of
the
provision
in
the
Bill
be
excessive
,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
length
of
time
for
which
datum
must
be
retain
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
justification
for
the
government
's
position
vis
-à
-
vis
the
two
-
year
retention
period
for
telephony
and
the
one
-
year
retention
period
for
Internet
datum
be
on
the
basis
of
security
and
counter
-
terrorism
measure
,
as
well
as
the
detection
of
crime
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
understand
that
rationale
and
would
not
argue
against
it
.
in
principle
,
we
be
not
against
the
retention
of
datum
and
believe
that
the
directive
must
be
transpose
.
however
,
we
take
issue
with
the
manner
in
which
it
be
be
transpose
and
the
length
of
time
for
which
datum
must
be
retain
,
particularly
in
relation
to
isp
and
telephone
record
,
because
we
believe
this
will
place
a
undue
burden
on
business
and
that
the
cost
could
be
prohibitive
and
reduce
any
future
comparative
advantage
Ireland
might
gain
through
the
Internet
and
telecomumication
sector
.
I
refer
to
the
historical
context
of
the
transposition
of
a
directive
date
back
to
2006
and
any
subsequent
legislation
enact
that
have
deal
with
counter
-
terrorism
or
crime
prevention
measure
more
than
adequately
,
include
the
criminal
justice
(
surveillance
)
act
and
the
recently
pass
criminal
justice
(
amendment
)
act
.
the
Labour
Party
be
examine
the
permutation
of
the
government
's
position
,
especially
vis-à
-
vo
the
cost
implication
.
I
submit
that
place
on
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
and
telephony
company
a
obligation
to
store
datum
for
two
year
would
result
in
a
undue
cost
burden
and
would
not
have
a
impact
on
crime
prevention
in
real
term
or
in
term
of
detection
.
I
refer
to
the
minister
's
submission
on
Committee
stage
.
he
state
that
the
12
month
detention
period
for
Internet
datum
be
very
much
in
the
mainstream
and
this
be
significant
because
the
Internet
be
a
relatively
new
technology
.
he
further
state
that
it
be
accept
that
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
which
would
arise
as
a
result
of
the
legislation
relate
to
datum
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
request
for
datum
be
,
to
use
the
word
of
the
minister
on
Committee
stage
,
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
,
then
I
submit
that
the
Labour
Party
amendment
,
which
seek
to
substitute
two
year
for
one
year
and
one
year
for
six
month
,
would
be
in
line
with
he
thinking
in
respect
to
the
prosecution
of
a
crime
or
any
investigation
pertinent
to
commit
a
crime
.
I
further
submit
that
if
the
legislation
be
pass
and
datum
be
to
be
retain
for
two
year
hence
,
then
on
this
day
in
two
year
time
,
that
be
,
on
23
February
or
24
February
2012
,
if
someone
be
to
be
investigate
for
a
crime
then
I
suggest
any
telephone
call
make
on
today
's
date
,
the
content
of
which
be
unknown
,
or
if
a
person
log
on
to
a
website
in
the
intervene
period
of
one
year
hereafter
,
it
would
impact
in
no
way
on
whether
one
could
suitably
detect
that
any
such
communication
be
pertinent
to
any
crime
commit
.
the
approach
of
the
government
in
term
of
transpose
the
directive
be
that
of
a
sledge
-
hammer
be
use
to
crack
a
nut
.
I
reiterate
that
we
be
not
against
the
principle
of
datum
storage
.
we
agree
the
directive
must
be
transpose
but
we
maintain
the
time
period
be
excessive
and
,
contrary
to
the
minister
's
statement
on
Committee
state
to
the
effect
that
the
legislation
be
in
line
with
the
mainstream
,
we
believe
it
be
against
the
European
mainstream
and
that
other
country
have
transpose
the
directive
on
the
basis
of
time
period
more
in
line
with
the
proposal
contain
in
the
Labour
Party
amendment
.
I
be
aware
of
one
Defence
force
member
who
miss
he
opportunity
for
promotion
because
he
final
medical
examination
could
not
take
place
for
reason
beyond
he
control
.
the
former
minister
for
Defence
be
well
aware
of
the
case
.

Minister
of
State

,
perhaps
the
case
could
be
re-examine
.
article
6
of
the
directive
allow
for
telephone
and
internet
datum
to
be
retain
for
a
minimum
of
six
month
and
a
maximum
of
two
year
.
we
all
accept
the
principle
of
the
retention
of
datum
and
each
state
be
at
liberty
to
choose
where
on
that
scale
it
pitch
its
obligatory
datum
retention
provision
.
the
norm
be
as
per
the
Labour
Party
position
set
down
in
this
amendment
.
there
be
no
contradiction
between
be
in
favour
of
the
principle
of
the
retention
of
datum
and
be
against
what
the
government
propose
.
if
one
put
a
onus
on
Internet
service
provider
and
telephony
company
to
retain
datum
,
they
must
retain
all
Internet
related
traffic
for
a
period
of
two
year
.
if
one
be
investigate
a
crime
,
one
cannot
speak
to
the
content
of
the
datum
.
if
I
use
my
Gmail
account
to
e-mail
someone
,
who
be
subsequently
charge
with
a
crime
,
one
can
only
state
that
correspondence
take
place
between
I
and
the
other
person
but
one
do
not
have
access
to
the
content
.
why
would
one
impose
a
cost
beyond
12
month
on
a
telephony
company
or
a
internet
service
provider
if
one
can
merely
deduce
that
communication
take
place
without
have
access
to
the
content
?
let
we
consider
the
example
of
social
networking
site
such
as
Bebo
,
Facebook
and
Twitter
and
web
-
base
e-mail
account
such
as
Hotmail
.
the
Minister
of
State
cannot
argue
that
this
measure
will
not
place
a
cost
burden
on
this
provider
because
every
single
piece
of
traffic
must
be
store
somewhere
.
I
imagine
the
vast
bulk
of
it
will
be
store
outside
the
confines
of
the
State
because
many
of
this
Internet
service
provider
be
international
company
and
have
specific
storage
facility
.
however
,
it
will
increase
the
cost
burden
for
that
who
operate
in
Ireland
,
such
as
Irish
company
with
storage
facility
here
.
by
increase
the
cost
burden
,
one
must
consider
whether
it
will
be
pertinent
to
the
solving
of
a
crime
thereafter
.
the
argument
of
the
Labour
Party
be
that
it
will
not
.
on
Committee
Stage
,
the
Minister
of
State
comment
:
the
significance
of
this
be
that
Internet
be
a
relatively
new
technology
.
it
be
accept
that
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
[
the
request
that
will
arise
from
the
vested
officer
]
be
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
.
if
the
vast
majority
of
disclosure
request
be
for
datum
less
than
three
month
old
,
the
position
of
the
Labour
Party
be
that
the
measure
exceed
that
which
the
Minister
of

state
on

the
logic
behind
the

in

again
,
with
reference
to
the
cost
burden
,
if
,
for
instance
a
designate
officer
should
make
a
disclosure
request
,
there
have
to
be
a
reasonable
approach
to
this
.
if
,
for
instance
,
the
request
trawl
so
wide
as
to
be
entirely
non-specific
and
take
up
a
large
amount
of
time
,
then
this
will
obviously
place
a
burden
on
the
relevant
isp
or
telephone
company
.
if
a
disclosure
request
be
as
wide
-
range
as
a
chief
superintendent
determine
it
should
be
,
then
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
cost
to
the
service
provider
in
yield
up
that
information
.
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
will
argue
to
the
effect
that
disclosure
request
be
need
and
there
have
to
be
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
chief
superintendent
.
nonetheless
,
I
believe
the
request
have
to
be
target
and
some
degree
of
scope
must
be
allow
for
as
regards
the
isp
or
telephone
company
.
that
be
fundamentally
what
I
be
address
here
.
to
my
mind
,
the
memorandum
of
understanding
refer
to
by
the
Minister
of
State
on
Committee
Stage
be
not
on
a
statutory
footing
.
section
7
state
that
service
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
they
.
it
be
important
the
view
of
the
telco
and
the
isp
,
internet
service
provider
,
be
acknowledge
.
one
of
the
party
to
the
memorandum
of
understanding
be
the
ISPAI
,
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
.
it
make
a
submission
on
the
Bill
and
state
section
7
be
far
too
wide
and
unwieldy
and
take
no
account
of
what
be
reasonable
,
technically
possible
and
not
very
expensive
.
its
recommendation
be
that
a
service
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
it
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
.
I
take
on
board
the
view
expound
by
the
Minister
of
State
but
the
reality
be
that
we
do
not
know
for
sure
how
many
request
will
be
make
by
a
designate
officer
.
we
do
not
know
for
what
purpose
such
request
will
be
make
,
against
whom
they
will
be
make
or
the
reason
why
they
may
be
make
.
if
we
accept
in
good
faith
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
,
then
we
deduce
request
will
only
be
make
in
respect
of
taxation
or
a
investigation
by
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
a
chief
superintendent
or
a
officer
of
the
law
.
I
refer
to
the
Bills
's
digest
,
a
very
good
document
publish
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
service
.
it
state
that
under
the
Bill
a
individual
can
only
find
out
that
datum
relate
to
he
or
she
be
access
on
foot
of
a
disclosure
request
by
first
make
a
request
on
the
basis
that
they
believe
the
datum
have
be
access
.
this
veer
somewhat
from
the
point
of
the
amendment
but
I
seek
to
nail
down
the
idea
that
there
be
a
clear
focus
in
respect
of
how
the
legislation
be
use
.
we
may
agree
that
one
must
retain
datum
and
that
such
datum
can
be
pertinent
to
solve
a
crime
but
we
have
no
wish
for
anyone
to
flout
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
for
they
own
end
.
we
have
no
wish
for
anyone
to
make
nefarious
request
for
disclosure
and
trawl
with
the
net
so
wide
such
that
it
would
put
a
cost
on
the
isp
and
such
that
a
service
provider
be
spend
resource
for
something
that
may
not
be
for
the
detection
of
a
crime
or
for
which
the
legislation
be
design
.
I
wish
to
put
down
a
marker
in
this
respect
and
I
intend
to
press
the
amendment
.
do
we
know
who
the
responsible
judge
would
be
in
respect
of
this
oversight
?
how
have
that
system
be
use
?
have
the
judge
use
this
provision
in
respect
of
other
legislation
?
my
understanding
be
that
provision
be
also
relate
to
the
interception
of
postal
packet
and
telecomumication
message
and
the
oversight
be
pertinent
with
regard
to
that
legislation
.
I
be
give
to
understand
report
be
rubber
-
stamp
in
respect
of
how
that
provision
work
,
without
any
qualitative
analysis
of
the
provision
in
question
.
I
be
unconvinced
that
the
oversight
mechanism
in
this
legislation
would
be
use
as
designate
.
I
suspect
that
the
oversight
provision
will
end
up
simply
be
rubber
-
stamp
as
per
other
legislation
and
that
we
will
not
know
in
real
term
whether
the
legislation
will
be
flout
or
abuse
by
certain
person
.
it
be
open
to
abuse
regardless
of
whether
one
accept
the
bona
fide
of
a
chief
superintendent
or
any
other
designate
officer
.
that
be
the
point
we
want
the
Minister
of
State
to
clarify
.
I
want
to
ensure
disclosure
request
be
make
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
and
reasonable
and
that
the
oversight
mechanism
will
be
subject
to
proper
scrutiny
.

the

Act

,
the
current
reporting
format
be
inadequate
,
even
if
there
be
judicial
oversight
.
if
one
examine
some
of
the
report

the

one
will
see
they

a

that

all
they
state

we
do
not

similar
circumstance

the
legislation
under
discussion

we
would
like
to
have
include
a
provision
seek
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
disclosure

if
a
request
be

there

if

no
correlation

it

there
be
always
a
need
for
some
form
of
qualitative
analysis
to
ensure
legislation
be
work
properly
and
fit
for
purpose
.
that
be
why
the
Labour
Party
be
say
a
detailed
report
should
be
make
.
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
documentation
state
a

can
only
find
out
if
datum
relate
to
he
or
she
have

by
first
make
a
request
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
believe
the
datum
have
be
access
.
that
be
a
fairly
serious
provision
.
the
reporting
procedure
could
redress
such
a
disparity
in
the
Bill
.
if
one
do
not
know
that
a
disclosure
request
have
be
make
about
one
,
one
have
no
way
to
access
the
referee
or
other
such
designate
person
.
perhaps
the
minister
have
a
view
on
that
.
if
my
understanding
of
the
provision
be
wrong
,
I
will
openly
acknowledge
it
but
the
amendment
will
ensure
that
the
legislation
be
not
use
for
nefarious
purpose
,
that
it
be
fit
for
purpose
and
that
it
be
use
in
a
manner
to
ensure
that
somebody
cannot
trawl
widely
for
a
disclosure
request
and
do
so
for
purpose
other
than
expedit
justice
.
the
Minister
of
State
offer
the
example
of
a
Mr.
Ryan
,
so
I
will
continue
to
use
that
example
.
he
also
refer
to
the
requirement
of
the
directive
and
the
term
under
which
datum
must
be
submit
to
the
commission
.
I
accept
that
point
.
however
,
if
we
be
discuss
the
rights
of
this
Mr.
Ryan
in
respect
of
whom
disclosure
be
request
,
under
the
Bill
Mr.
Ryan
can
only
find
out
if
a
disclosure
request
have
be
make
by
first
make
a
request
to
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
on
the
basis
that
he
believe
that
personal
datum
have
be
access
.
if
the
datum
relate
to
Mr.
Ryan
have
be
access
,
there
be
no
analysis
after
the
fact
.
if
nothing
arise
from
the
disclosure
and
Mr.
Ryan
be
innocent
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
analysis
thereafter
that
allow
Mr.
Ryan
to
know
that
a
disclosure
request
be
make
about
he
by
one
of
the
designate
officer
.
the
reporting
mechanism
to
the
commission
do
not
allow
for
that
either
.
we
be
try
to
ensure
that
if
Mr.
Ryan
be
not
prosecute
,
a
report
under
this
section
will
contain
detail
of
the
number
of
prosecution
actually
commence
as
a
result
of
investigation
to
which
request
related
and
detailed
justification
for
any
significant
excess
in
number
of
request
.
if
no
prosecution
be
take
against
Mr.
Ryan
,
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
a
excess
.
that
must
be
quantifiable
as
well
.
I
know
I
be
repeat
myself
but
I
be
try
to
strike
a
balance
between
what
be
appropriate
and
inappropriate
use
of
the
disclosure
request
in
the
first
instance

ensure
that

case

the
State

because
of

procedure
,
12
month
after
the
enactment
of
the
Bill
would
be
able
to
note
a
inordinately
large
amount
of
disclosure
request
from
a
particular
source
about
a
certain
person
where
no
action
have
arise
from
they
.
it
be
right
to
have
a
method
by
which
we
can
question
that
process
.
I
might
be
overly
pedantic
about
this
but
we
must
prevent
nefarious
use
of
the
law
.
that
be
my
objective
.
perhaps
the
Minister
of

could
clarify
and
acknowledge
whether
the

state
a

can
already
find
out
if

it

whichever
be
the
great
"
.
the
basis
of
this
amendment
be
that
the
2007
version
of
the
Bill
,
in
section
7
(
5
)
,
set
forth
a
minimum
fine
on
indictment
of
€
10000
for
fine
set
prior
to
the
commencement
date
.
this
have
disappear
from
the
Bill
,
although
it
seem
a
appropriate
provision
to
maintain
the
hierarchy
of
penalty
between
summary
conviction
and
conviction
on
indictment
.
we
suggest
that
this
be
re-insert
.
I
will
not
delay
proceedings
except
to
say
that
I
agree
with
the
tenor
and
tone
of
the
amendment
tab
by
the
minister
.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
to
ensure
that
people
who
be
not
criminal
but
who
transgress
or
make
mistake
will
not
be
imprison
as
a
result
of
not
pay
fine
.
the
legislation
be
also
design
to
put
in
place
a
process
to
ensure
that
people
will
have
every
avenue
open
to
they
in
order
that
they
might
pay
fine
.
will
the
minister
clarify
the
position
with
regard
to
people
's
financial
circumstance
?
do
I
understand
that
there
be
some
degree
of
sympathy
for
person
who
may
have
transgress
and
who
might
find
themselves
subject
to
fine
?
will
the
new
process
take
into
account
a
individual
's
inability
to
pay
in
the
context
of
both
they
outgoing
and
they
overall
earnings
?
the
minister
refer
,
in
some
sympathy
,
to
person
who
may
have
unintentionally
transgress
and
indicate
that
,
for
obvious
reason
,
he
want
to
keep
they
out
of
prison
.
be
it
the
case
that
a
appoint
receiver
will
be
in
a
position
to
recover
property
from
someone
who
do
not
pay
a
fine
?
the
amendment
before
the
House
improve
the
legislation
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
citizen
must
be
give
every
means
and
opportunity
possible
to
pay
fine
and
avoid
prison
.
in
addition
,
the
legislation
must
contain
a
mechanism
which
ensure
that
no
one
will
take
advantage
of
any
perceive
softening
in
the
approach
of
put
in
place
a
system
of
fine
in
the
first
instance
.
I
welcome
the
amendment
.
I
presume
the
clock
start
now
.
on
the
recovery
order
in
section
16
,
subsection
2
state
:
"
before
make
a
recovery
order
,
the
court
shall
conduct
a
inquiry
into
the
financial
circumstance
of
the
person
who
have
fail
to
pay
the
fine
concerned
and
may
require
the
person
to
provide
the
court
with
such
information
as
it
may
specify
relate
to
that
circumstance
.
"
although
I
be
not
speak
specifically
to
the
amendment
we
be
deal
with
now
—
I
wish
to
give
notice
that
I
will
not

they
do

with
this

.
we

to
ensure
that
all
possibility
be
exhaust
concern
a
person
's

of
financial

.
that
person
's
outgoing
should
potentially
be
take
into
account
also
in
adjudicate
on
the
issue
before
go
to
a
recovery
order
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
a
person
who
be
not
a
serial
offender
or
a
hardy
perennial
before
the
court
,
and
who
may
have
transgress
but
who
ordinarily
be
a
very
good
citizen
,
would
have
every
opportunity
to
pay
the
fine
if
they
do
not
have
the
means
immediately
at
they
disposal
.
I
would
like
to
get
further
clarity
on
that
.
I
move

no.

''
.
I
take
on
board
what
the
minister
have
say
.
this
amendment
seek
to
ensure
a
sense
of
appropriateness
in
each
individual
case
.
I
be
satisfied
that
the
minister
's
position
on
this
amendment
have
already
be
deal
with
by
the
early
amendment
.
therefore
I
intend
to
withdraw
the
amendment
.
I
be
not
against
the
amendment
per
se
,
but
it
state
that
the
Court
Service
''
may
''
from
time
to
time
,
publish
in
such
a
manner
as
it
consider
appropriate
,
include
on
the
Internet
,
a
list
of
the
name
and
address
of
person
who
have
fail
to
pay
fine
impose
on
they
by
the
due
date
of
payment
.
I
assume
,
since
the
word
''
may
''
be
use
that
there
be
no
obligation
on
the
Court
service
to
publish
the
name
.
without
be
sarcastic
,
when
somebody
present
himself
or
herself
before
the
court
,
there
be
a
good
chance
the
court
reporter
from
the
Corkman
or
the
Leitrim
Observer
or
any
other
local
newspaper
will
publish
the
person
's
name
in
the
follow
edition
.
I
suggest
the
person
concerned
will
have
be
subject
to
enough
embarrassment
through
that
.
there
may
be
circumstance
where
this
impose
another
administrative
cost
on
the
Court
service
.
I
do
not
think
the
minister
have
set
out
how
much
this
will
cost
to
administer
.
by
virtue
of
use
of
the
word
''
may
''
,
I
wonder
if
it
will
ever
be
use
at
all
.
that
be
a
question
,
by
the
way
.
I
support
this
Bill
which
should
have
the
effect
of
fundamentally
change
we
culture
by
ensure
that
everyone
who
get
behind
the
wheel
of

so
in

full
knowledge
that

driving
behaviour

as
a
result
of

legislation
,
that
who
drink
will
have
to
significantly
change
they
behaviour
.
we
need
to
modify
how
we
,
as
a
society
,
deal
with
the
issue
of
alcohol
and
the
only
way
to
achieve
this
objective
be
to
ensure
there
be
no
ambiguity
about

with

,
I
have
the
great
respect
for
the
previous
speaker
,
deputy
Christy
O'Sullivan
.
I
,
too
,
be
only
too
well
aware
of
the
condition
experience
by
rural
dweller
who
be
frequently
disadvantage
by
virtue
of
they
rural
isolation
and
experience
a
lack
of
access
to
service
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
listen
to
government
deputy
deplore
the
state
of
rural
road
and
the
problem
of
rural
isolation
.
if
people
be
to
have
access
to
the
service
they
will
require
as
a
result
of
the
measure
provide
for
in
the
Bill
,
we
must
ensure
ancillary
service
be
in
place
to
meet
they
demand
and
need
.
for
instance
,
in
my
area

decide
to
withdraw
the

route
which
serve
a
rural
area
and
individual
live
in
rural
isolation

they
include
old
people
who
travel
to
town
such
as
Fermoy
,
Ballyhooly
and
Castletownroche
to
enjoy
a
drop
before
take
a
bus
home
late
in
the
evening
.
many
of
this
people
do
not
drive
and
will
no
long
have
access
to
the
service
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
close
the
route
.
this
problem
be
a
function
of
government
policy
because
a
ancillary
rural
transport
programme
be
not
in
place
to
pick
up
the
slack
arise
from
the
loss
of
the
service
.
in
particular
,
a
night
time
bus
service
be
not
in
place
to
facilitate
that
who
want
to
act
responsibility
but
be
unable
to
avail
of
a
bus
service
.
government
policy
militate
against
the
very
people
who
experience
rural
isolation
.
we
need
to
be
clear
about
the
implication
of
the
legislation
.
if
we
support
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
driver
behaviour
must
change
significantly
,
we
must
also
take
into
account
that
some
people
,
by
virtue
of
reside
in
rural
area
and
decide
to
behave
responsibly
as
require
under
the
legislation
,
will
no
long
have
access
to
the
local
pub
.
current
policy
do
not
meet
they
need
.
if
Bus
Éireann
drop
route
at
a
rate
of
knot
and
the
rural
transport
programme
be
not
roll
out
quickly
enough
to
pick
up
the
slack
,
particularly
with
regard
to
night
time
service
,
that
who
live
in
the
rural
area
obviously
will
be
affect
.
this
issue
need
to
be
tease
out
in
great
detail
.
on
the
commencement
of
the
section
which
will
become
operational
before
mid-2011
,
I
refer
to
the
Bills
digest
produce
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
unit
.
it
state
:
.
.
.
different
section
may
become
operational
before
other
.
some
of
the
provision
of
the
Bill
will
not
come
into
force
until

what
be
the
current
state
of
play
with
regard
to
the
Garda
's
capacity
to
recalibrate
the
ebt
machine
as
require
?
I
understand
the
legislation
reduce
blood
alcohol
limit
and
introduce
mandatory
alcohol
testing
for
driver
who
be
involved
in
traffic
collision
as
well
as
roadside

testing
to
detect
driver
who
be
under
the
influence

or

.
one
would
expect
the
government
to
have
ensure
all
necessary
technology
be
available
prior
to
or
in
parallel
with
the
implementation
of
the
legislation
.
will
the
minister
provide
a
update
on
the
Garda
's
capacity
to
use
the
require
technology
?
on
road
collision
statistic
,
while
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
I
have
a
healthy
scepticism
about
some
of
the
statistic
produce
on
road
traffic
accident
.
the
government
have
state
its
commitment
to
improve
road
safety
and
the
number
of
death
on
Irish
road
decline
to
240
in
2009
.
it
be
estimate
that
25
%
of
road
accident
and
33
%
of
fatal
road
accident
be
attributable
to
alcohol
.
I
often
wonder
how
such
statistic
be
measure
and
what
process
be
use
by
the
Road
Safety
Authority
or
Garda
Síochána
to
produce
they
statistic
,
particularly
that
relate
to
road
fatality
.
I
be
not
sceptical
about
the
figure
but
I
question
the
qualitative
method
use
to
compile
the
statistic
use
for
make
a
argument
for
a
particular
proposal
.
I
ask
for
a
response
in
that
regard
.
I
welcome
the
provision
on
new
driver
.
we
cannot
disregard
the
link
between
driver
impairment
and
alcohol
consumption
.
it
have
be
prove
scientifically
and
be
support
by
anecdotal
evidence
.
common
sense
say
that
if
a
person
imbib
,
they
ability
to
operate
a
machine
or
vehicle
will
be
impair
.
the
Vintner
's
Federation
of
Ireland
oppose
the
reduction
in
the
limit
and
I
can
see
its
point
.
Anecdotal
evidence
suggest
that
they
regular
rural
customer
might
drink
a
pint
and
a
drop
before
amble
home
.
they
never
go
beyond
they
usual
level
of
imbibing
,
which
be
a
social
outlet
for
they
.
we
must
be
able
to
provide
for
that
who
use
the
pub
as
a
social
outlet
.
if
they
be
not
able
to
drive
,
how
will
we
facilitate
they
?
some
of
they
will
be
able
to
get
taxi
while
other
will
travel
with
neighbour
.
however
,
do
we
now
have
to
tell
they
that
there
be
no
other
alternative
?
in
implement
the
legislation
,
we
need
to
strike
a
balance
and
speak
for
that
people
as
well
.
the
section
create
a
distinction
between
newly
qualified
and
other
full
licence
holder
.
Novice
driver

subject
to
a
low
bac
and
will

month
if

or

if

after
a
court
hearing

other
licence

disqualification

a

.
can
the
Minister
of
State
clarify
if
this
be
a
age
-
related
distinction
,
or
do
it
merely
distinguish
between
novice
and
experienced
driver
?
be
any
qualification
bring
into
play
concern
a
old
person
who
may
have
transgress
?
it
be
not
that
I
be
advocate
a
particular
position
on
that
,
but
I
be
seek
clarification
in
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
on
balance
we
be
experience
a
serious
erosion
of
service
in
rural
area
.
some
argue
that
the
decline
of
the
rural
pub
reflect
a
decline
in
overall
infrastructure
,
particularly
road
.
as
someone
who
meet
member
of
the
public
every
day
,
I
hold
that
view
myself
,
because
they
be
find
it
increasingly
difficult
to
access
service
.
that
be
particularly
the
case
for
old
people
.
I
would
distinguish
between
old
and
elderly
people
,
because
the
use
of
the
word
"
elderly
"
sometimes
imply
a
certain
infirmity
.
many
old
people
be
mobile
,
although
they
may
not
drive
.
we
always
have
a
sense
of
inter-generational
solidarity
in
this
country
,
but
it
be
be
undermine
by
stealth
.
when
draft
legislation
we
must
,
therefore
,
ensure
that
if
it
impact
on
one
service
we
should
try
to
replace
it
with
another
service
if
possible
.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
ensure
that
life
be
save
and
one
cannot
qualify
that
.
while
it
be
a
black
and
white
issue
,
there
be
grey
area
where
some
public
service
will
be
diminish
.
government
policy
on
rural
transport
should
be
structure
in
such
a
way
that
people
can
access
community
centre
or
pub
outside
normal
office
hour
if
they
wish
to
do
so

we

at
yesterday
's
meeting
of
the
agriculture
committee
,
a
motion
be
put
before
it
concern
the
Lost
at
Sea
scheme
and
a
decision
be
take
on
the
ombudsman
's
report
.
the
Labour
Party
have
circulate
a
motion
for
the
House
to
seek
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
would
discuss
this
matter
.
the
House
have
the
power
to
refer
it
to
the
committee
in
a
bid
to
seek
that
a
report
be
send
back
to
the
House
by
a
set
date
.
I
be
ask
that
the
Ombudsman
be
afford
a
opportunity
to
present
she
finding
on
the
Lost
at
Sea
scheme
.
she
have
not
be
afford
such
a
opportunity
to
date
.
yesterday
's
vote
by
the
committee
deny
she
that
opportunity
,
but
we
be
seek
to
table
the
matter
before
the
wide
House
so
as
that
the
Oireachtas
allow
she
a
opportunity
.
it
be
vital
—
—
the
motion
will
be
tab
before
the
House
.
the
issue
be
whether
the
House
will
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
the
recommendation
in
the
ombudsman
's
report
have
be
reject
.
this
be
a
serious
matter
.
if
the
House
decide
that
it
will
reject
a
report
place
before
it
,
then
—
—
it
be
a
serious
matter
.
I
be
ask
whether
it
could
be
take
—
—
—
—
on
government
time
.
it
be
a
important
matter
and
I
be
ask
that
it
be
take
during
government
time
.
on
the
same
issue
,
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
matter
,
which
be
apolitical
—
—
the
fact
remain
that
,
if
any
citizen
of
the
State
make
a
complaint
,
he
or
she
will
have
no
confidence
that
the
complaint
will
be
hear
—
—
——
if
the
report
be
reject
.

on
a
point
of
order
—
—
with
all
due
respect
,
I
indicate
on
this
issue
.
there
be
a
motion
before
the
House
and
all
the
Labour
Party
want
be
to
provide
the
ombudsman
with
a
opportunity
to
present
the
finding
of
she
report
before
a
designate
committee
,
preferably
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
that
be
on
the
Order
Paper
and
we
be
ask
that
there
be
some
degree
of
common
sense
in
term
of
how
this
be
approach
.
we
do
not
want
further
statement
in
the
dáil
on
this
matter
and
,
as
deputy
Gilmore
say
,
it
can
be
do
without
debate
if
we
facilitate
the
person
in
question
.
that
be
all
we
be
ask
.
it
be
a
very
reasonable
request
and
it
be
all
we
be
ask
.
I
note
what
the
Taoiseach
have
say
about
the
Ombudsman
's
act
be
silent
on
the
matter
.
again
,
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
Taoiseach
allow
the
Ombudsman
a
opportunity
to
present
she
finding
.
I
believe
that
be
a
reasonable
approach
.
this
can
be
do
in
a
non-partisan
way
.
I
be
sure
this
House
could
facilitate
such
a
process
.
I
support
the
amendment
on
the
basis
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Health
and
Children
report
on
primary
care
publish
last
month
.
there
be
a
view
that
the
primary
care
strategy
will
be
vital
in
term
of
health
care
provision
in
the
future
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
primary
care
centre
should
be
license
by
the
HSE
and
subject
to
the
rule
of
HIQA
.
if
one
adhere
to
the
goal
in
the
primary
care
strategy
,
one
would
encourage
more
people
to
be
treat
in
primary
care
centre
and
move
away
from
accident
and
emergency
centre
.
if
more
people
be
to
be
treat
in
primary
care
centre
,
then
it
be
obvious
that
we
need
more
such
centre
and
,
therefore
,
one
must
provide
some
degree
of
stimulus
to
bring
about
more
of
they
.
I
be
aware
of
one
such
centre
in
north
Cork
which
will
bring
together
approximately
17
general
practitioner
.
the
HSE
have
buy
in
as
a
active
stakeholder
in
that
process
and
the
PCCC
,
primary
,
community
and
continue
care
,
programme
will
arise
from
the
process
.
there
be
beneficial
social
outcome
as
a
result
of
facilitate
specific
relief
by
regulation
.
I
anticipate
the
minister
will
speak
to
the
issue
of
property
-
base
relief
and
there
be
general
agreement
in
respect
of
they
future
.
however
,
specific
relief
can
be
make
in
respect
of
capital
investment
or
equipment
.
we
must
be
far
-
reach
in
this
regard
.
I
admire
the
wording
put
forward
because
it
allow
the
minister
a
degree
of
latitude
.
we
should
consider
the
amendment
laterally
and
take
a
lateral
view
of
how
we
proceed
with
primary
care
centre
,
which
the
amendment
facilitate
.
it
take
a
regime
change
.
may
I
tease
out
the
figure
that
the
minister
place
before
we
and
seek
a
clarification
on
the
number
of
contract
that
be
under
negotiation
presently
?
I
may
have
misheard
the
minister
.
I
think
she
state
30
be
under
negotiation
.
I
want
to
get
a
more
qualitative
analysis
of
the
present
state
of
negotiation
.
the
reason
I
ask
that
be
because
I
believe
it
be
pertinent
to
the
amendment
.
the
current
state
of
negotiation
could
be
influence
by
whether
or
not
further
stimulus
be
give
to
primary
care
centre
that
may
be
under
negotiation
presently
or
that
person
may
be
think
of
set
up
where
they
may
have
start
cursory
negotiation
with
the
HSE
or
the
Department
of
Health
and
Children
.
give
the
present
state
of
the
economy
,
the
state
of
that
negotiation
will
be
predicate
on
whether
there
be
a
stimulus
provide
and
a
amendment
such
as
this
will
definitely
have
a
influence
in
bring
more
of
they
to
fruition
.
that
would
be
my
party
's
view
.
I
listen
with
interest
to
the
argument
put
forward
by
Government
deputy
,
particularly
from
the
Green
Party
Member
from
Carlow
,
because
I
never
hear
such
patronising
drivel
in
all
my
life
.
to
suggest
that
we
be
give
business
a
false
hope
by
bring
forward
this
Bill
reflect
the
unreality
of
Green
Party
Deputy
.
this
legislation
try
to
find
positive
solution
to
the
real
problem
that
people
face
in
village
,
town
and
city
throughout
the
country
because
they
cannot
renegotiate
they
rent
.
we
be
take
a
realistic
approach
to
the
problem
,
back
by
a
sound
body
of
legal
opinion
.
deputy
Kennedy
's
demand
that
we
put
we
legal
opinion
before
the
House
be
merely
a
digression
from
the
issue
at
hand
.
Fianna
Fáil
and
the
Green
Party
be
aware
that
we
be
offer
a
genuine
solution
but
they
will
not
even
entertain
we
attempt
to
build
a
positive
outcome
.
I
remind
deputy
White
that
the
Bill
seek
to
address
the
emergency
that
have
arise
in
regard
to
upward
-
only
rent
review
and
the
substantial
economic
havoc
that
such
provision
be
wreak
on
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
.
Rent
review
,
which
normally
occur
every
five
year
,
be
result
in
the
wind
up
of
a
large
number
of
company
.
in
many
case
,
liquidator
be
have
to
exercise
special
statutory
power
to
disclaim
onerous
lease
and
the
effective
abandonment
of
business
result
in
substantial
employment
loss
.
this
Bill
attempt
to
find
a
solution
to
this
serious
issue
.
we
be
not
give
anybody
false
hope
when
we
seek
to
find
a
way
to
help
this
business
survive
and
flourish
.
I
do
not
know
if
deputy
White
receive
as
many
e-mail
on
this
issue
as
I
do
.
I
wish
to
share
with
she
one
such
e-mail
I
receive
from
a
lady
in
Mallow
who
operate
a
small
niche
business
call
Fountain
of
Angel
.
her
rent
be
€
8500
per
annum
.
she
tell
I
in
she
e-mail
that
the
upward
-
only
rent
review
clause
be
unfair
and
discriminate
against
tenant
.
it
be
put
she
under
significant
pressure
and
call
into
question
the
viability
of
she
business
.
if
she
try
to
leave
,
however
,
the
landlord
be
entitle
to
pursue
she
for
loss
of
income
for
the
remainder
of
she
lease
,
which
happen
to
have
a
term
of
11
year
.
this
situation
be
not
help
by
auctioneer
who
give
misleading
information
and
it
reflect
every
e-mail
we
have
receive
on
this
issue
.
this
be
a
real
issue
and
it
must
be
deal
with
in
a
real
political
sense
and
that
be
what
we
seek
to
do
tonight
.
other
matter
that
must
be
tackle
include
the
hold
on
legal
opinion
and
the
hold
that
auctioneer
,
landlord
and
property
owner
have
over
people
.
we
should
think
more
laterally
about
how
to
allow
business
to
survive
,
a
purpose
at
the
heart
of
the
Bill
.
the
proposal
be
perfectly
realistic
for
people
who
live
in
the
real
world
.
we
do
not
contend
that
we
be
give
people
false
hope
.
we
be
serious
enough
to
put
forward
a
Bill
of
this
nature
because
we
wish
to
tackle
this
issue
realistically
such
that
we
can
give
small
business
a
opportunity
to
flourish
.
that
be
the
motive
from
which
this
Bill
emanate
.
the
minister
would
be
good
react
to
deputy
Gilmore
's
proposal
.

the
reason
I
ask
the
question
be
because
we
have
a
opportunity
in
this
country
to
phase
out
such
fuel
as
coal
and
they
can
quite
easily
be
replace
by
miscanthus
.
farmer
tell
I
that
the
establishment
cost
be
quite
high
and
that
the
grant
could
be
improve
,
if
possible
,
to
assist
in
that
regard
.
do
I
hear
the
Minister
of
State
correctly
when
he
state
that
he
be
preclude
by
European
Union
rule
from
expand
or
increase
that
level
of
grant
aid
?
I
ask
he
to
expand
on
that
point
.
once
the
crop
have
be
establish
,
be
there
any
scope
to
improve
the
increment
for
weed
control
,
the
control
of
pest
and
also
plough
and
cultivation
?
if
he
be
unable
to
increase
the
grant
for
the
establishment
of
the
crop
,
perhaps
he
could
consider
a
increase
on
the
embed
side
,
if
I
could
use
that
expression
.
will
the
minister
of
State
agree
there
be
many
company
facilitate
farmer
in
establish
the
crop
in
the
first
instance
and
that
the
expertise
exist
?
will
he
acknowledge
the
potential
for
this
crop
and
that
perhaps
the
government
be
under
-
value
the
potential
of
this
crop
in
meet
a
alternative
energy
need
?
will
he
also
acknowledge
that
there
may
be
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
farmer
to
switch
into
this
crop
because
the
scheme
itself
be
understld
?
the
government
need
to
do
a
marketing
job
to
encourage
more
farmer
to
diversify
into
this
crop
,
give
the
level
of
expertise
,
particularly
in
the
east
Cork
and
west
Limerick
region
where
two
company
that
be
market
leader
be
only
itching
to
get
more
farmer
under
they
ambit
but
they
need
a
great
financial
incentive
.
I
be
unsure
whether
the
question
related
to
competition
policy
or
food
labelling
,
but
I
will
address
both
matter
while
I
have
the
opportunity
.
I
appreciate
that
.
will
the
Minster
acknowledge
in
respect
of
food
labelling
that
there
be
no
willingness
on
the
part
of
certain
EU
country
to
proceed
with
a
change
to
the
country
of
origin
label
regime
in
operation
at
present
,
because
it
would
materially
affect
they
trade
and
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
?
if
there
be
a
real
political
initiative
at
EU
level
in
respect
of
this
issue
,
the
Government
and
the
Green
Party
would
be
shouting
about
it
from
the
rooftop
.
let
we
not
be
disingenuous
about
it
.
I
refer
to
the
Competition
Act
.
I
appreciate
the
Spanish
EU
Presidency
be
take
initiative
in
respect
of
this
issue
but
there
be
already
a
considerable
body
of
law
on
the
Irish
Statute
Book
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
the
Competition
Act
2002
,
which
incorporate
the
treaty
on
the
functioning
of
the
EU
,
prohibit
agreement
and
concerted
practice
which
have
as
they
"
object
or
effect
the
prevention
,
restriction
or
distortion
of
competition
in
trade
on
any
goods
"
?
will
the
minister
further
acknowledge
that
upon
the
abolition
of
the
grocery
order
in
December
2005
it
be
state
that
certain
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
non-dominant
undertaking
in
the
grocery
trade
would
effectively
be
legislate
for
—
—
the
dearth
of
legislation
be
cause
the
situation
we
have
at
the
moment
.
have
the
Minister
of
State
a
opinion
on
the
fact
that
the
committee
take
a
unanimous
decision
across
all
of
the
political
party
boundary
and
across
the
political
spectrum
,
and
that
such
decision
be
base
on
hear
a
corpus
of
evidence
from
all
side
?
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
he
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
it
be
a
unanimous
view
,
which
should
be
take
seriously
by
he
in
determine
the
final
outcome
,
and
that
when
the
committee
take
the
view
,
it
do
so
on
the
basis
that
the
aim
of
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
be
not
mutually
exclusive
from
that
of
HSI
and
that
there
would
be
no
threat
to
HSI
by
cede
the
studbook
to
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
——
—
—
I
respect
the
view
of
the
Minister
of
State
but
the
line
minister
be
sit
right
beside
he
.
be
it
in
order
for
I
to
ask
whether
the
senior
minister
in
the
Department
would
have
a
view
on
this
or
would
proffer
a
view
to
the
House
on
this
?
this
be
very
much
a
case
of
"
yes
,
Minister
"
.
I
be
amazed
at
how
we
operate
this
parliament
,
which
need
to
be
seriously
modernise
and
overhaul
.
it
be
ludicrous
.
I
just
have
a
surreal
moment
.
I
feel
I
have
a
bit
-
part
in
"
yes
,
minister
.
"
I
appreciate
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle's
—
—
—
—
weighty
advice
but
we
need
to
speak
to
a
little
bit
of
common
sense
as
well
.
be
there
a
final
position
on
the
EU
's
position
in
term
of
this
negotiation
or
be
there
continuous
bilateral
talk
on
the
Irish
position
at
the
WTO
?
the
decline
in
farm
employment
have
be
stark
.
the
loss
of
employment
in
the
construction
industry
,
as
acknowledge
by
the
minister
,
be
also
have
a
major
bear
on
off
-
farm
employment
.
a
report
by
David
Meredith
of
Teagasc
's
rural
economy
research
centre
in
Kinsealy
,
County
Dublin
,
highlight
that
70
%
of
farmer
record
low
secondary
education
as
they
high
qualification
,
mean
they
be
more
vulnerable
to
a
economic
downturn
.
if
only
6
%
of
farmer
have
a
third
level
degree
,
will
the
minister
agree
more
have
to
be
do
to
encourage
young
farmer
to
up
-
skill
so
if
they
need
a
off
-
farm
income
they
will
have
good
employment
choice
and
still
be
able
to
part
-
time
farm
?
will
he
also
agree
it
be
important
to
provide
proper
resource
to
the
agricultural
college
?
the
rate
of
decline
be
from
115000
in
2008
to
98000
in
2009
.
not
all
of
the
agricultural
college
will
be
able
to
take
up
that
slack
to
re-educate
this
farmer
.
while
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
response
,
he
will
have
to
wide
the
scope
of
the
exist
education
policy
.
in
support
of
deputy
McGinley
's
point
,
will
the
government
extend
a
invitation
as
per
the
Labour
Party
request
to
facilitate
the
ombudsman
in
one
of
the
committee
to
allow
she
to
present
the
finding
in
she
report
?

(

)
of
the
Bill
,
which
seek

amend
section
35

the
credit
Union
Act
,
will
make
it
impossible
for
credit
union
to
undertake
reschedule
and
pay
a
dividend
to
member
.
this
be
because
the
cost
to

additional
reserve
arise
from
the
reschedule
would
leave
nothing
to
be
pay
out

could
cause

withdraw

.
I
understand
that
the
expert
committee
establish
by
the
Minister
's
Department
be
limit
originally
in
its
membership
and
meet
infrequently
.
the
propose
regulatory
requirement
underpin
this
legislation
will
result
,
to
my
mind
,
in
the
opposite
to
what
be
intend
by
the
minister
unless
amendment
be
make
on
committee
stage
.
if
not
amend
,
it
will
mean
a
more
restrictive
regime
around
credit
union
,
deny
they
the
ability
to
meet
the
need
of
some
member
impact
by
unemployment
,
wage
cut
and
even
public
service
levy
.
I
be
sure
this
be
not
what
the
minister
have
intend
when
the
legislation
be
first
draft
.
it
be
impossible
and
unwise
to
look
at
the
Central
Bank
Bill
as
it
relate
to
a
ease
of
restriction
on
credit
union
loan
duration
limit
,
without
look
at
what
the
registrar
propose
as
the
underlying
requirement
and
operational
guideline
.
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
view
the
propose
legislative
change
as
a
opportunity
to
impose
yet
more
stringent
reserve
and
liquidity
requirement
upon
credit
union
,
it
could
be
argue
.
this
have
to
be
see
in
the
context
that
credit
union
be
the
most
reserve
-
rich
financial
institution
in
the
State
.
the
registrar
introduce
a
regulatory
or
non-distributable
minimum
capital
reserve
requirement
of
10
%
for
credit
union
in
2009
—
a
very
stringent
reserve
requirement
,
give
that
the
bank
at
present
be
baulk
at
they
new
standard
of
8
%
.
it
should
also
be
measure
against
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
credit
union
benefit
from
a
additional
layer
of
protection
in
the
form
of
a
self
-
fund
mutual
stabilisation
fund
,
the
savings
protection
scheme
,
under
the
auspices
of
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
.
there
be
a
very
real
danger
of
over
-
egg
the
cake
in
this
particular
instance
.
the
registrar
propose
to
apply
he
section
35
requirement
to
all
credit
union
regardless
of
whether
a
credit
union
wish
to
avail
of
the
extension
to
the
section
35
limit
.
this
be
something
that
must
be
address
on
committee
stage
.
the
registrar
be
propose
a
liquidity
requirement
of
25
%
to
30
%
where
the
section
35
exemption
be
avail
of
.
even
the
current
20
%
liquidity
requirement
be
very
onerous
when
measure
against
the
standard
the
regulator
currently
apply
against
banking
.
there
be
every
danger
here
that
the
combination
of
the
registrar
's
and
minister
's
proposal
will
have
the
impact
of
rendering
it
impossible
for
credit
union
to
pay
a
dividend
to
they
member
.
if
all
surplus
fund
must
be
plough
into
additional
reserve
,
credit
union
dividend
will
suffer
,
drive
fund
out
of
responsible
credit
union
and
into
irresponsible
bank
.
it
must
be
state
,
and
the
minister
must
accept
,
that
no
credit
union
have
need
to
be
bail
out
by
the
State
.
no
taxpayer
's
money
have
be
pour
into
a
single
credit
union
,
to
my
knowledge
,
and
the
vast
majority
of
credit
union
be
part
of
a
voluntary
mutual
stabilisation
fund
which
act
as
a
backstop
to
the
State
deposit
guarantee
scheme
.
there
be
ongoing
call
for
this
stabilisation
scheme
to
be
regulate
by
the
registry
of
credit
Union
and
extend
to
all
credit
union
in
the
State
.
the
registrar
seem
to
be
take
the
view
that
every
reschedule
loan
be
a
at
-
risk
loan
.
this
be
a
false
assumption
.
many
credit
union
member
be
take
the
responsible
route
when
confront
by
a
drop
in
income
and
approach
they
credit
union
immediately
,
before
arrears
occur
,
to
renegotiate
they
payment
.
this
must
also
be
consider
on
committee
stage
.
the
proposal
before
the
House
today
,
if
unaltered
,
will
tie
the
hand
of
credit
union
behind
they
back
.
it
be
inconsistent
of
the
regulator
to
encourage
bank
to
reschedule
loan
for
they
borrower
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
financially
penalise
credit
union
that
seek
to
accommodate
they
member
.
practical
amendment
need
to
be
agree
on
committee
stage
.
a
balance
must
be
strike
between
the
need
of
borrower
and
saver
and
the
requirement
to
supplement
already
strong
reserve
.
I
understand
the
credit
union
representative
association
,
include
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
,
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
the
National
Supervisor
's
Forum
and
the
credit
union
themselves
,
have
be
in
negotiation
with
the
regulator
and
the
Department
of
Finance
on
this
issue
.
I
look
forward
to
the
introduction
of
positive
amendment
that
will
add
strength
to
the
credit
union
movement
,
which
be
one
of
the
few
bright
light
on
the
financial
horizon
.
the
minister
for
Finance
set
out
,
in
April
2009
,
to
make
it
easy
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
the
need
of
member
experience
unemployment
and
reduce
income
by
afford
great
flexibility
to
credit
union
to
extend
loan
term
,
where
necessary
,
beyond
five
year
.
his
Department
enter
into
limited
consultation
on
this
matter
and
it
be
the
registrar
of
credit
union
and
not
the
Department
that
become
the
driver
in
this
reform
.
the
result
be
legislation
that
make
it
more
difficult
—
that
be
,
more
expensive
—
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
member
request
for
reschedule
loan
.
I
be
not
say
credit
union
should
not
have
strong
reserve
.
nobody
be
argue
that
.
I
fully
support
the
registrar
's
introduction
of
the
regulatory
reserve
requirement
in
2009
and
commend
credit
union
on
build
up
they
capital
reserve
to
10
%
as
a
result
of
this
requirement
.
this
compare
favourably
with
the
equivalent
figure
for
bank
,
which
be
8
%
.
however
,
this
house
should
pause
for
thought
when
we
see
yet
another
reserve
-
drive
initiative
from
the
registrar
that
have
not
be
the
subject
of
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
.
credit
union
representative
association
be
responsible
body
and
be
warning
against
the
financial
impact
of
this
late
—
dare
I
say
it
—
hurry
imposition
by
the
registrar
.
it
be
unwise
for
this
House
to
consider
such
a
imposition
when
the
registrar
and
the
Department
have
clearly
not
undertake
a
impact
analysis
.
Impact
model
produce
by
credit
union
body
show
many
credit
union
face
nil
dividend
return
to
member
as
a
result
of
the
minister
's
proposal
.
the
propose
change
will
not
address
the
need
of
unemployed
credit
union
member
but
will
make
it
impossibly
expensive
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
the
need
of
they
member
.
in
addition
,
and
equally
importantly
,
the
measure
will
jeopardise
the
ability
of
many
credit
union
to
pay
dividend
to
they
member
,
which
will
drive
money
out
of
credit
union
over
time
and
ultimately
damage
this
great
not
-
for
-
profit
resource
.
ultimately
,
the
only
body
that
will
gain
from
the
weaken
of
the
credit
union
movement
will
be
bank
and
moneylender
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
be
a
hurry
and
ill
-
conceive
measure
.
it
merit
careful
scrutiny
before
damage
be
inflict
on
the
credit
union
sector
.
this
sector
have
not
demand
any
bailout
at
taxpayer
's
expense
and
it
have
act
with
probity
at
all
time
,
although
there
be
some
notable
exception
.
look
at
the
credit
union
movement
,
one
must
be
convince
that
it
have
act
for
the
common
good
at
all
time
.
it
be
a
responsible
sector
with
its
own
stabilisation
fund
.
when
we
hear
warning
from
the
credit
union
representative
association
of
the
damage
that
this
so
-
call
reform
will
bring
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
this
and
act
cautiously
.
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
have
extensive
power
of
regulation
and
be
currently
oversee
a
review
of
the
credit
union
sector
on
behalf
of
the
Department
of
Finance
.
Radical
proposal
to
heap
additional
reserve
requirement
on
a
already
reserve
-
rich
credit
union
sector
need
careful
consideration
.
I
urge
that
this
take
place
and
that
there
be
plenty
of
dialogue
with
the
representative
association
.
I
hope
they
concern
will
be
reflect
in
the
minister
's
response
and
in
amendment
introduce
to
the
Bill
on
Committee
stage
.
I
ask
the
Acting
Chairman
how
much
time
I
have
leave
.
I
understand
the
Fine
Gael
speaker
be
next
.
I
have
make
my
point
.
if
there
be
a
government
speaker
in
the
House
,
I
will
yield
to
she
,
if
that
be
in
order
.
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Lenihan
,
in
response
to
a
Parliamentary
question
today
in
regard
to
the
Mazar
review
of
lending
to
small
and
medium
enterprise
state
:
the
third
Mazar
report
on
lending
to
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
which
cover
the
period
from
October
to
December
2009
,
show
that
credit
application
in
number
and
value
term
rise
slightly
in
the
last
quarter
of
2009
over
the
previous
quarter
,
which
be
encouraging
.
the
level
of
application
for
credit
appear
to
be
stabilise
and
Mazar
also
report
a
small
improvement
in
the
overall
credit
approval
rate
.
however
,
the
reduction
in
the
stock
of
credit
,
as
repayment
exceed
new
credit
,
and
in
credit
quality
report
by
the
bank
remain
a
concern
for
the
government
.
to
address
this
concern
,
I
announce
early
this
month
that
AIB
and
Bank
of
Ireland
be
to
make
available
a
minimum
of
€
3
billion
each
for
new
or
increase
credit
facility
,
include
work
capital
target
at
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
in
the
real
economy
in
each
of
the
next
two
year
.
the
small
and
medium
enterprise
group
appear
before
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
and
Regulatory
affair
yesterday
.
its
member
constitute
more
than
98
%
of
all
business
entity
in
Ireland
and
number
more
than
240000
in
term
of
the
number
of
business
they
represent
and
employ
just
under
one
million
people
.
in
response
to
question
on
the
Mazar
report
,
Mr.
Fielding
,
the
representative
,
state
that
,
with
regard
to
access
to
credit
,
the
Mazar
report
publish
last
week
have
be
hijack
by
the
bank
.
in
the
first
two
Mazar
report
there
be
major
input
from
the
Department
of
Finance
,
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
and
small
business
.
we
do
not
even
know
the
third
report
be
come
out
and
it
be
launch
at
a
joint
press
conference
by
Mazar
and
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
with
no
Department
of
Finance
,
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
or
small
to
medium
enterprise
.
it
be
very
disappointing
from
we
point
of
view
.
in
further
deliberation
on
the
difficulty
face
small
business
we
speak
about
the
employment
subsidy
scheme
.
Mr.
Fielding
go
on
to
state
that
last
summer
the
Tánaiste
introduce
the
employment
subsidy
scheme
.
initially
,
it
be
for
exporter
only
but
it
be
extend
to
all
company
.
I
direct
the
follow
comment
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
.
however
,
Mr.
Fielding
go
on
to
state
that
in
the
small
print
one
see
it
be
extend
to
all
company
except
that
employ
few
than
ten
people
,
immediately
exclude
90
%
of
all
business
.
therefore
,
government
policy
on
employment
relate
to
firm
employ
ten
or
more
employee
.
it
give
a
unfair
advantage
to
that
employ
11
as
against
a
firm
employ
nine
people
.
the
government
do
not
have
bottomless
pocket
but
one
would
think
more
could
be
do
when
one
see
the
amount
of
money
be
invest
in
the
bank
.
this
be
the
word
of
the
person
who
represent
98
%
of
business
in
the
country
.
this
be
he
view
in
respect
of
funding
and
the
role
of
bank
in
this
society
at
the
moment
.
there
be
a
vacuum
at
present
.
it
be
the
view
of
ISME
that
there
remain
a
significant
lending
deficit
which
undermine
competitiveness
,
constrain
productivity
,
threaten
recovery
and
put
at
risk
the
ability
of
sme
to
gain
access
to
working
capital
and
growth
capital
.
that
be
what
this
motion
be
about
.
the
banking
crisis
have
seriously
impair
the
capacity
of
Irish
bank
to
lend
to
the
SME
sector
.
I
refer
to
the
answer
I
receive
to
my
question
on
the
Mazar
report
.
the
minister
state
that
a
letter
be
send
to
both
Bank
of
Ireland
and
AIB
on
7
April
of
this
year
require
they
to
prepare
a
sme
lending
plan
,
break
down
by
sector
and
geography
for
submission
to
the
Department
by
12
May
.
what
do
this
tell
we
about
the
government
's
response
to
lending
in
the
SME
sector
in
the
first
instance
and
the
bank
response
since
the
guarantee
be
put
in
place
in
September
2008
in
respect
of
lending
in
the
SME
sector
?
it
be
non-existent
;
it
be
not
happen
.
the
evidence
of
a
letter
on
7
April
this
year
do
not
inspire
confidence
into
the
process
be
undertake
in
respect
of
the
systemic
bank
and
other
bank
at
present
.
the
minister
also
state
both
bank
be
expect
to
make
credit
available
.
both
bank
be
expect
to
make
credit
available
immediately
and
be
not
to
wait
until
plan
be
submit
.
the
bottom
line
be
we
have
a
viable
plan
here
,
one
which
will
facilitate
lending
to
the
SME
sector
.
we
can
do
this
post
haste
,
which
be
what
need
to
be
do
to
effect
growth
in
this
economy
again
.
the

with
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
I
,
too
,
wish
to
warmly
congratulate
deputy
Connick
on
he
accession
to
the
position
of
Minister
of
State
.
I
wish
he
well
and
look
forward
to
work
with
he
.
I
be
disappointed
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
if
the
scheme
be
design
with
biodiversity
in
mind
,
will
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
hedgerow
in
particular
and
road
margin
and
the
biodiversity
within
be
be
threaten
by
the
illegal
dumping
of
plastic
,
which
,
in
turn
,
will
have
a
effect
on
biodiversity
over
time
?
will
he
also
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
a
opportunity
,
through
this
scheme
,
for
farmer
to
work
in
partnership
with
the
local
authority
to
ensure
drainage
mechanism
be
put
in
place
?
we
could
potentially
have
a
arterial
drainage
type
scheme
at
a
local
level
and
could
also
,
by
incentivise
farmer
to
maintain
the
hedge
row
,
create
from
this
some
degree
of
income
.
I
believe
this
be
a
miss
opportunity
.
if
the
scheme
be
so
diverse
,
be
not
a
whole
farm
scheme
and
relate
to
issue
such
as
tree
planting
,
moor
land
grazing
,
lake
catchment
,
mix
grazing
and
conservation
of
wild
bird
habitat
then
I
honestly
believe
a
opportunity
have
go
abeg
to
do
something
to
stem
the
tide
of
illegal
dumping
and
to
bring
farmer
and
landowner
into
partnership
in
term
of
seek
to
alleviate
that
problem
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
be
glad
the
Minister
of
State
mention
the
word
"
flooding
"
because
one
can
have
all
the
nitrate
alleviation
measure
in
the
world
,
but
if
one
do
not
tackle
the
issue
of
flooding
it
do
not
amount
to
anything
.
would
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
since
the
serious
flooding
last
year
nothing
have
be
do
,
in
concrete
term
,
to
instigate
measure
which
would
prevent
such
flooding
happen
again
,
in
particular
in
the
Shannon
basin
region
?
the
consultation
process
be
lag
behind
the
need
for
direct
action
on
flooding
event
,
such
as
that
we
see
in
the
west
and
throughout
the
Shannon
region
.
action
be
now
need
and
it
precede
the
consultation
process
.
we
should
not
envisage
a
situation
in
the
come
month
like
that
which
we
see
previously
,
in
term
of
its
effect
on
agriculture
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
in
a
position
to
change
the
system
now
.
I
be
also
reassure
by
the
minister
's
reply
.
give
the
allege
breach
of
contract
,
will
a
mechanism
be
introduce
to
facilitate
the
compensation
of
farmer
for
loss
of
contract
?
potentially
,
the
company
have
abuse
its
dominant
position
by
allegedly
breach
contract
.
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
that
?
not
if
one
be
loyal
to
Beamish
.
we
all
have
to
be
see
to
be
do
something
when
it
come
to
the
dairy
sector
but
it
appear
that
every
mechanism
that
could
be
put
in
place
have
be
put
in
place
.
I
refer
to
the
market
management
regime
,
the
export
refund
scheme
and
intervention
stock
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
until
such
time
as
there
be
a
pick
-
up
in
global
demand
that
the
system
will
remain
as
it
be
for
some
time
?
perhaps
I
be
wrong
but
it
appear
that
not
much
more
can
be
do
in
term
of
intervene
to
facilitate
a
recovery
until
such
time
as
global
demand
for
milk
and
milk
-
base
product
pick
up
.
I
do
not
have
access
to
the
tabular
information
.
however
,
I
accept
the
minister
's
reply
.
in
pose
the
question
I
be
interested
in
find
out
why
farmer
be
become
liable
for
penalty
and
what
be
the
source
of
the
non-compliance
.
if
we
have
a
record
of
that
information
,
matter
could
be
rectify
in
future
.
how
many
do
not
submit
payment
claim
or
do
so
late
?
the
minister
state
the
problem
in
Kerry
be
sort
today
.
what
exactly
do
he
mean
by
that
?
when
?
when
can
the
farmer
expect
they
payment
?
I
should
say
at
the
outset
that
Cobh
community
hospital
be
a
facility
that
be
very
well
-
regard
by
the
people
of
Cobh
.
I
have
be
ask
by
my
Labour
Party
colleague
on
Cobh
Town
Council
to
raise
this
issue
as
a
matter
of
urgency
because
there
be
a
situation
whereby
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
have
take
over
the
fair
deal
scheme
as
it
relate
to
Cobh
hospital
.
that
will
have
serious
permutation
for
the
cost
per
patient
per
week
in
that
it
be
state
that
the
possible
drop
in
fee
from
€
1200
to
€
800
per
bed
per
week
could
result
in
a
serious
deficit
.
obviously
a
deficit
in
funding
would
have
a
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
patient
to
remain
within
the
hospital
in
the
first
instance
,
but
also
severely
impact
on
the
hospital
's
ability
to
take
in
new
patient
.
it
be
a
38
-
bed
hospital
and
there
be
approximately
40
staff
.
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
be
the
issue
whereby
care
for
we
old
people
who
be
in
community
-
base
facility
be
be
erode
by
this
government
through
a
process
of
stealth
.
the
government
's
model
of
health
care
be
about
roll
back
the
State
and
this
wonderful
community
-
base
facility
so
that
they
may
be
completely
and
utterly
subsume
into
a
private
nursing
home
model
,
thereby
roll
back
the
stakesholding
that
community
have
within
this
hospital
which
make
they
the
excellent
facility
they
be
.
it
be
all
be
do
under
the
wonderful
guise
of
HIQA
rule
and
the
fact
that
this
institution
be
old
.
anything
that
be
deem
to
be
old
in
this
new
paradigm
we
have
with
this
government
be
deem
not
to
be
of
sufficient
standard
.
I
want
to
speak
for
hospital
such
as
Cobh
,
the
welfare
home
in
Youghal
and
Nazareth
House
in
Mallow
,
all
of
which
provide
a
excellent
standard
of
care
,
but
be
now
under
threat
because
of
the
new
rule
that
have
come
into
play
through
the
fair
deal
scheme
and
the
new
punish
hiqa
standard
.
all
I
want
to
do
here
be
make
the
case
for
Cobh
community
hospital
,
in
that
it
be
a
excellent
facility
.
there
be
a
significant
buy
-
in
from
the
people
of
Cobh
into
this
hospital
.
the
staff
coterie
be
very
loyal
to
the
hospital
.
the
patient
there
be
happy
,
and
I
would
hope
the
government
ensure
the
continuation
of
this
hospital
in
perpetuity
,
especially
for
the
old
people
of
Cobh
who
will
use
it
,
hopefully
,
into
the
future
.

if

change

,
can
he
or
she
plead
a
certain
degree
of
ignorance

that
he
or
she
do
not

document
?
should
there
be
a
provision
whereby
the
onus
be
place
on
the
person
to
notify
change
of
address
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
comment
in
regard
to
the
assess
means
in
a
balance
fashion
and
I
support
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
it
be
a
cause
for
concern
that
there
may
be
industrious
and
imaginative
people
who
see
this
provision
as
a
potential
mine
for
economic
gain
.
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
have
sum
up
the
issue
well
.
we
must
prevent
situation
where
the
cost
of
recovery
of
the
fine
exceed
the
fine
itself
.
it
would
be
dangerous
to
allow
that
type
of
culture
to
emerge
.
Seanad
amendment
no.
35
be
quite
vague
in
this
regard
,
indicate
that
the
minister
may
specify
the
"
rate
at
which
fee
that
may
be
so
deduct
shall
be
calculate
"
.
there
must
be
clarity
in
order
to
prevent
the
system
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
in
fairness
,
we
must
acknowledge
a
decent
Bill
when
it
come
before
we
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
ensure
that
the
minister
would
take
into
account
a
person
's
earnings
and
means
when
make
a
decision
on
imprisonment
.
I
be
glad
that
have
happen
.
I
take
the
minister
's
point
about
the
small
percentage
of
that
who
be
in
prison
as
a
result
of
non-payment
of
fine
.
however
,
this
Bill
be
only
one
part
of
a
jigsaw
that
need
to
be
examine
,
because
the
overall
prison
service
must
also
be
examine
.
the
recent
departure
of
Kathleen
McMahon
and
John
Lonergan
be
significant
and
we
must
take
cognisance
of
what
Ms
McMahon
be
say
in
respect
of
the
governance
procedure
that
dictate
how
the
prison
system
be
run
.
there
be
a
issue
of
overcrowding
and
there
be
scenario
where
we
have
three
or
four
people
in
a
cell
.
the
former
governor
of
Mountjoy
Prison
have
speak
extensively
about
the
humane
treatment
of
prisoner
.
the
idea
of
a
prisoner
slop
out
in
this
day
and
age
be
ludicrous
.
if
we
take
the
Fines
Bill
as
one
part
of
the
jigsaw
,
then
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
will
have
few
people
in
prison
as
a
result
of
this
legislation
,
which
be
welcome
.
however
,
common
sense
must
speak
to
the
issue
of
overcrowding
in
prison
and
the
governance
procedure
for
the
prison
service
.
we
need
to
ask
whether
somebody
like
Ms
Kathleen
McMahon
could
have
stay
within
the
system
if
she
have
be
allow
a
great
deal
of
autonomy
to
allow
she
to
progress
the
agenda
upon
which
she
have
embark
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
the
Dóchas
centre
.
there
be
overcrowding
and
there
seem
to
be
a
shortage
of
prison
place
.
the
minister
recently
state
in
this
House
that
Kilworth
prison
be
still
on
the
agenda
.
in
real
term
there
be
no
sign
of
that
prison
and
the
creation
of
extra
place
.
a
wide
debate
need
to
take
place
on
this
issue
.
we
support
the
Bill
,
which
we
hope
will
reduce
the
number
of
people
in
prison
.
we
hope
a
qualitative
and
quantitative
approach
take
to
how
the
prison
system
be
run
.

I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
and
I
be
seek
to
ascertain
definitively
whether
he
be
give
any
credence
to
the
idea
of
introduce
a
de
facto
minimum
income
for
every
farmer
so
as
to
buttress
against
potential
market
instability
in
the
future
.
the
recent
volatility
in
the
dairy
sector
show
we
,
along
with
other
factor
,
just
how
volatile
farm
income
be
at
present
and
the
fact
that
there
will
have
to
be
a
EU
-
wide
response
to
this
.
what
I
be
really
try
to
ascertain
be
whether
the
minister
be
give
credence
to
the
notion
of
a
minimum
payment
for
farmer
and
,
if
so
,
whether
there
be
EU
-
wide
support
for
such
a
measure
.
the
minister
mention
the
historical
model
of
payment
,
and
I
acknowledge
the
speech
he
give
to
the
Seanad
recently
in
which
he
express
a
preference
for
the
retention
of
this
model
.
what
I
take
from
that
speech
,
however
,
be
that
the
historical
model
would
come
under
increase
attack
and
that
it
be
not
guarantee
into
the
future
.
that
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
minister
could
state
,
at
least
,
that
there
be
a
degree
of
stability
of
income
,
but
it
be
not
necessarily
guarantee
to
continue
if
the
model
change
,
unless
the
minister
state
otherwise
.
if
the
historical
model
change
,
will
that
compromise
basic
income
to
farmer
?
the
minister
's
reply
be
take
directly
from
a
recent
speech
he
give
to
the
Seanad
.
the
own
initiative
report
on
this
issue
be
author
by
Mr.
George
Lyon
,
MEP
,
a
liberal
Democrat
representative
for
Scotland
,
whose
party
be
a
member
of
the
same
group
within
the
European
Parliament
as
Fianna
Fáil
.
Mr.
Lyon
refer
to
the
desire
to
go
beyond
2020
for
phase
in
the
move
from
historic
to
area
-
base
payment
and
to
significant
difference
in
term
of
the
criterion
to
be
use
for
the
distribution
of
single
farm
payment
to
member
state
.
as
far
as
he
be
concerned
,
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
historical
model
will
be
no
more
.
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
point
that
there
be
increase
pressure
for
that
to
occur
.
if
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
majority
of
member
state
will
seek
to
move
away
from
the
historical
model
of
payment
,
then
what
be
the
current
thinking
within
the
Fianna
Fáil
group
in
the
European
Parliament
as
to
what
will
be
the
replacement
?
be
Mr.
Lyon
speak
for
all
Fianna
Fáil
Member
of
the
European
Parliament
when
he
speak
about
a
movement
towards
area
-
base
payment
?
I
do
not
hear
exactly
what
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
say
but
I
wonder
if
I
can
ask
—
—
appreciate
the
latitude
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
have
already
allow
I
,
I
be
just
about
to
state
that
at
meeting
of
the
agriculture
committee
of
which
Mr.
Lyon
be
a
member
,
Ireland
's
position
would
heretofore
have
be
put
forward
by
the
minister
,
but
that
be
no
long
necessarily
the
case
because
of
the
new
structure
in
place
follow
the
ratification
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
.
it
be
on
this
basis
that
I
give
great
credence
to
what
he
be
say
because
it
could
be
reflective
of
the
position
of
the
group
within
the
European
Parliament
to
which
he
belong
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
about
the
political
consideration
but
I
be
sure
he
will
acknowledge
that
George
Lyon
's
position
on
this
issue
will
be
very
influential
in
term
of
the
final
outcome
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
there
be
approximately
700
amendment
to
that
particular
report
currently
before
the
European
Parliament
.
the
key
for
we
at
this
stage
of
the
process
be
to
try
to
nail
down
a
more
definitive
government
position
,
that
be
,
to
ascertain
whether
the
minister
have
come
to
a
conclusion
regard
the
new
system
for
payment
for
farmer
post
2013
.
if
I
understand
he
correctly
the
minister
be
say
that
be
a
ongoing
process
and
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
accept
that
answer
.
if
we
take
the
three
fundamental
pillar
that
will
underpin
CAP
,
namely
,
water
management
,
biodiversity
and
climate
change
,
a
issue
will
arise
regard
the
whole
pillar
of
rural
development
and
whether
income
will
be
take
from
direct
payment
to
farmer
and
house
in
a
rural
development
pillar
,
which
could
see
it
go
into
a
administrative
function
through
various
local
body
and
development
organisation
.
do
the
minister
have
a
view
on
that
at
this
stage
?
have
a
clear
government
position
evolve
on
that
aspect
?
would
the
minister
acknowledge
that
there
be
reservation
by
farm
organisation
on
the
matter
on
the
basis
that
they
would
not
wish
to
see
income
be
diversify
into
that
area
at
the
risk
that
it
could
go
down
the
so
-
call
administrative
black
hole
?
if
one
's
solution
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
cattle
,
it
be
a
simplistic
way
of
look
at
the
problem
and
one
be
not
look
at
the
problem
of
ghg
properly
.
that
be
a
scientific
view
.
I
would
refer
the
Minister
of
State
to
TResearch
,
which
be
a
Teagasc
publication
in
this
regard
.
perhaps
he
might
acknowledge
that
look
at
the
area
of
animal
genetics
,
animal
management
,
animal
nutrition
and
performance
stimulant
would
be
a
good
way
to
reduce
ghg
like
methane
and
that
there
be
a
scientific
basis
for
do
that
.
would
he
acknowledge
that
any
proposal
to
implement
the
McCarthy
report
as
it
pertain
to
the
scientific
budget
would
have
a
impact
on
Teagasc
's
operation
and
on
reduce
methane
emission
potentially
in
the
long
run
?
we
need
to
take
a
more
lateral
view
.
early
,
the
minister
refer
to
the
consultation
process
and
say
that
the
commission
will
publish
documentation
.
can
member
of
this
house
be
provide
with
a
insight
into
the
view
of
the
Irish
permanent
representation
in
Brussels
?
in
that
way
we
could
be
make
aware
of
how
the
process
be
progress
.
I
do
not
ask
about
the
sow
or
the
poultry
,
although
I
be
glad
to
hear
there
be
something
in
the
offing
on
that
point
.
what
be
the
exact
timeframe
for
the
minister
to
conclude
scheme
for
dairy
hygiene
,
sheep
fencing
and
water
harvesting
?
on
what
date
will
that
scheme
come
into
effect
?
this
issue
boil
down
to
some
simple
fact
.
Fermoy
Town
Council
have
be
instruct
to
fix
a
fish
pass
on
the
River
Blackwater
in
Fermoy
to
adhere
to
a
edict
from
the
European
Commission
hand
down
on
foot
of
a
complaint
by
person
or
body
unknown
on
the
matter
of
the
impediment
to
fish
swim
up
river
west
of
Fermoy
.
the
local
council
do
not
have
the
means
to
pay
for
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
,
which
be
protect
and
which
the
council
own
.
the
estimate
cost
of
repair
be
€
100000
.
the
Department
be
unwilling
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
repair
.
last
Christmas
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Conor
Lenihan
,
give
Fermoy
Town
Council
until
the
end
of
2010
to
repair
the
damage
fish
pass
at
Fermoy
weir
to
become
compliant
on
foot
of
the
complaint
to
the
EU
Commission
.
the
Southern
Regional
Fishery
Board
,
which
may
or
may
not
have
be
the
originator
of
the
complaint
and
which
favour
the
replacement
of
the
weir
with
a
rock
ramp
pass
,
when
ask
through
a
freedom
of
information
request
about
its
involvement
in
the
matter
inform
the
secretary
of
the
rowing
club
,
Mr.
Donal
O'Keeffe
,
that
old
file
be
destroy
in
a
flood
in
2009
.
in
the
meantime
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Conor
Lenihan
,
inform
Fermoy
Rowing
Club
last
week
that
he
be
deeply
concerned
no
progress
have
be
make
in
the
past
six
month
.
he
go
on
to
indicate
that
the
rock
ramp
would
definitely
happen
if
Fermoy
Town
Council
do
not
repair
the
fish
pass
.
when
inform
that
the
council
have
no
money
to
effect
this
repair
,
the
Minister
of
State
make
it
clear
it
be
the
duty
of
Fermoy
Town
Council
,
as
owner
of
the
weir
,
a
protect
structure
,
to
find
the
money
somewhere
.
the
minister
say
that
he
cannot
give
they
money
towards
the
cost
of
repair
to
the
fish
pass
.
however
,
the
government
,
of
which
the
minister
be
a
member
,
be
willing
spend
a
multiple
of
€
100000
in
order
to
install
a
rock
ramp
pass
at
the
behest
of
the
Southern
Regional
Fishery
Board
.
incidentally
,
there
be
no
indication
that
the
EU
Commission
have
instruct
the
government
to
install
a
rock
ramp
pass
but
it
be
satisfied
that
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
be
sufficient
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
still
do
not
know
how
many
salmon
be
move
up
river
,
because
there
be
no
fish
counter
in
Fermoy
town
.
we
all
want
to
see
fish
be
catch
on
the
rod
,
and
I
do
not
particularly
wish
to
see
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
take
the
lion
's
share
of
the
spoil
below
in
Clondulane
weir
,
but
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
a
balance
strike
between
ensure
that
fish
have
safe
passage
and
guard
the
future
of
the
rowing
club
.
let
the
government
assist
with
the
cost
of
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
and
install
a
fish
counter
in
Fermoy
.
let
common
sense
prevail
.
what
about
the
cost
argument
?
even
minor
work
be
unaffordable
to
the
town
council
.
the
Minister
of

's

detail
provide
with

question
.
we
have
shif
the
blame
on
to
the
manager
now
.
that
be
a
subtle
shift
in
position
.
why
not
have
a
public
inquiry
?
the
government
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
after
spend
€
22
billion
on
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
how
many
case
have
be
try
under
that
legislation
?
that
be
only
rubbish
;
ráiméis
in

Dé
.
Fianna
Fáil
wine
and
dine
they
or
else
it
be
the
other
way
around
.
base
on
Department
of
Finance
figure
.
I
will
start
by
nail
the
lie
that
be
come
from
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
in
regard
to
the
Labour
Party
and
any
policy
it
may
or
may
not
have
.
I
invite
Deputy
McGrath
,
Collins
and
Byrne
to
take
a
look
at
the
Labour
Party
website
.
therein
they
will
see
at
least
50
position
and
policy
paper
on
a
wide
range
of
subject
from
tourism
right
through
the
economy
.
I
invite
they
,
in
particular
,
to
take
a
look
at
the
Labour
Party
proposal
on
the
creation
of
a
strategic
investment
bank
that
will
get
this
economy
up
and
run
again
.
it
will
create
wealth
and
job
and
will
be
use
in
a
manner
which
be
productive
and
will
grow
the
economy
,
through
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
and
can
be
use
effectivity
to
get
this
economy
up
and
run
again
.
I
want
to
nail
this
lie
which
be
now
emerge
from
Fianna
Fáil
that
somehow
we
be
a
party
which
be
devoid
of
policy
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
anybody
in
the
Labour
Party
who
put
they
name
to
a
ballot
paper
because
it
suggest
somehow
that
we
be
devoid
of
any
kind
of
substance
politically
before
we
ever
decide
to
enter
politics
we
have
always
be
a
policy
-
drive
party
.
I
invite
people
to
take
a
look
at
we
record
in
term
of
we
involvement
in
this
house
down
through
the
year
and
age
.
the
record
will
speak
for
itself
on
that
matter
.
when
we
be
in
government
the
people
of
this
country
will
see
that
we
will
do
we
good
for
they
and
will
not
be
pander
to
vested
interest
.
on
the
report
,
nobody
,
include
I
who
be
on
my
first
mandate
,
have
perfect
knowledge
on
the
fateful
night
of
September
on
the
government
's
position
or
the
true
picture
of
where
the
bank
stand
.
it
be
right
and
proper
that
when
we
be
legislate
in
this
house
that
every
single
deputy
who
be
give
a
mandate
in
this
House
have
perfect
knowledge
.
it
be
very
clear
now
—
we
do
not
seek
to
take
political
advantage
from
it
—
that
the
guarantee
which
be
give
on
that
night
be
too
wide
-
range
.
it
be
too
big
a
blanket
,
in
term
of
how
it
cover
the
individual
bank
.
anybody
who
examine
the
report
in
any
objective
fashion
will
see
that
it
be
too
wide
range
.
anybody
who
be
a
ordinary
decent
citizen
of
this
land
will
see
that
the
cost
of
cover
Anglo
Irish
Bank
have
be
€
22
billion
so
far
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
the
€
22
billion
spend
thus
far
be
money
that
the
next
government
will
be
down
in
term
of
be
able
to
provide
service
to
the
ordinary
decent
citizen
of
this
country
.
Fianna
Fáil
deputy
will
be
lambast
we
from
the
other
side
of
the
House
for
not
deliver
service
because
we
will
be
down
€
22
billion
.
this
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
classic
game
.
it
be
act
as
surreptitiously
as
possible
and
be
spin
the
story
that
wind
down
the
bank
in
a
orderly
manner
will
cost
a
multiple
of
€
22
billion
,
even
though
we
do
not
know
that
for
certain
.
we
want
transparency
so
that
every
citizen
,
regardless
of
he
or
she
political
affiliation
,
can
decide
whether
the
government
of
the
day
be
do
a
decent
job
.
this
independent
report
clearly
have
not
vindicate
the
government
's
position
.
they
criticism
of
past
macro-economic
policy
and
the
over
reliance
on
tax
break
be
as
clear
as
the
nose
on
my
face
.
the
bottom
line
be
good
governance
in
the
bank
,
a
proper
regulatory
framework
and
a
public
inquiry
that
allow
we
to
understand
the
relationship
between
politics
and
banking
so
that
we
can
develop
legislation
that
ensure
the
chicanery
we
have
become
use
to
over
the
past
decade
will
be
no
more
.
would
the
deputy
have
do
two
mass

must

of
American
that
grace

the
Labour
Party
motion
,
under
the
stewardship
of
deputy
Upton
,
seek
to
develop
Ireland
's
capacity
as
a
eco-tourism
destination
.
one
of
Ireland
's
natural
advantage
be
the
unspoiled
3500
mile
of
coastline
.
it
be
so
indented
that
one
be
never
more
than
80
mile
from
the
sea
.
add
to
this
the
800
lake
and
river
.
paddle
sport
like
sea
kayaking
and
river
kayaking
be
,
as
yet
,
a
untapped
potential
.
while
organisation
such
as
the
Irish
Sea
Kayaking
Association
,
ISKA
,
be
active
in
promote
this
sport
,
the
time
be
right
for
they
to
be
include
in
a
new
consultative
process
that
develop
capacity
in
this
area
.
we
have
underestimate
the
potential
for
eco-tourism
,
particularly
as
a
maritime
nation
.
the
report
of
the
tourism
renewal
group
recognise
the
need
for
domestic
marketing
.
it
state
:
domestic
demand
have
a
vital
role
in
help
enterprise
survive
the
current
international
downturn
and
particularly
the
current
negative
impact
of
the
sterling
exchange
rate
on
we
large
and
near
market
.
similar
argument
apply
to
the
economic
rationale
for
domestic
as
to
international
marketing
.
domestic
destination
compete
directly
with
overseas
destination
for
Irish
tourist
.
we
take
a
more
lateral
view
than
that
articulate
in
the
review
in
respect
of
the
marketing
target
.
Ireland
always
seem
to
tailor
its
product
towards
the
UK
or
North
American
market
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
that
,
in
order
to
build
the
capacity
of
the
tourism
product
,
we
must
move
away
from
the
narrow
focus
of
sell
,
for
example
,
a
weekend
by
the
lake
of
Killarney
,
although
there
be
a
market
segment
for
that
product
.
we
need
to
examine
minority
sport
such
as
kayaking
and
develop
they
into
segment
.
give
we
natural
environment
and
easy
access
to
the
sea
,
a
eco
-
tourism
product
be
there
to
be
develop
.
to
assist
this
process
,
we
must
build
a
stakeholder
model
that
allow
group
such
as
the
ISKA
,
which
have
lead
expedition
all
over
the
world
,
to
develop
a
product
to
encourage
kayaker
to
visit
this
country
.
such
organisation
have
the
necessary
contact
,
intelligence
gathering
and
viral
network
to
assist
in
create
a
domestic
and
international
product
that
will
bring
people
to
we
shore
.
I
refer
to
sea-
kayaking
but
we
can
develop
a
model
for
other
such
niche
ecotourism
product
like
surfing
,
mountaineering
and
hill
-
walking
.
the
idea
be
to
bring
this
people
in
as
part
of
the
stakeholder
process
.
this
people
have
the
necessary
contact
on
the
international
stage
.
I
have
sea-
kayake
and
go
mountaineering
in
other
part
of
the
world
.
one
do
this
through
build
up
contact
through
membership
of
various
organisation
.
we
need
to
bring
this
people
together
as
part
of
a
stakeholder
group
to
develop
the
product
domestically
and
use
that
contact
in
the
exist
marketing
framework
to
slowly
develop
the
market
we
need
in
order
to
bring
people
to
we
shore
.
this
be
take
a
more
lateral
view
of
build
product
in
niche
area
.
that
be
the
future
for
the
specific
ecotourism
product
this
country
have
the
potential
to
develop
.

to
deputy
Durkan
at
this
stage
.
this
be
a
democracy
and
there
be
a
wide
range
of
view
in
we
party
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
?
do
the
minister
get
advice
from
the
Attorney
General
on
that
?
what
be
the
Attorney
General
's
advice
on
that
?
three
time
last
week
we
support
they
.
the
minister
should
get
he
fact
right
.
we
be
see
the
minister
's
true
colour
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
minister
's
amendment
no.
1
,
which
state
in
paragraph
(
2
)
that
a
person
who
hunt
deer
with
two
or
more
dog
shall
be
guilty
of
a
offence
,
but
in
paragraph
(
3
)
state
it
shall
not
be
a
offence
for
a
person
on
foot
to
hunt
deer
with
two
or
more
dog
,
under
and
in

with
section
29
and
section
42
.
to
satisfy
my
thirst
for
knowledge
on
the
minister
's
line
of
think
on
this
,
will
he
clarify
for
the
House
what
be
in
and
what
be
out
?
section
2

3
be
related
in
this
sense
,
beg
the
acting
Chairman
's
indulgence
.
we
want
clarification
from
the

on
he
position
on
other
type
of
deer
hunting
.
what
be
on
he
mind
in
respect
of
other
type
of
deer
hunting
?
it
be
still
a
little
unclear
.
the
minister
's
own
deputy
say
that
.
that
be
a
patronising
statement
if
ever
I
hear
one
.
this
be
like
a
counselling

this
be
surreal

be
the
minister
of
State
aware
of
the
situation
with
the
Midleton
train
at
present
?
if
he
want
to
speak
authoritatively
,
he
should
check
he
fact
.
the
guideline
that
be
publish
be
only
guideline
.
when
deputy
Batt
O'Keeffe
be
Minister
of
State
in
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
he
publish
guideline
on
the
relaxation
of
rule
for
one
-
off
house
in
rural
area
.
the
guideline
that
be
issue
state
councillor
must
have
regard
to
development
plan
as
they
exist
in
local
authority
area
.
however
,
the
local
development
plan
itself
have
very
stringent
rule
and
regulation
on
green
belt
area
,
and
certain
type
of
designation
for
particular
area
which
supersede
the
guideline
themselves
.
it
do
not
make
any
change
whatsoever
to
the
number
of
one
-
off
house
build
as
a
result
of
the
publication
of
that
guideline
.
similarly
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Gormley
,
publish
guideline
last
week
—
or
give
notice
of
he
intention
to
publish
guideline
—
on
house
on
national
secondary
route
.
I
be
aware
of
three
case
of
people
who
have
a
genuine
housing
need
who
wish
to
build
on
family
own
land
on
a
national
secondary
route
.
I
have
regard
to
the
guideline
publish
by
the
minister
but
I
be
tell
by
the
local
authority
that
the
development
plan
,
which
be
adopt
by
the
member
elect
by
the
people
will
supersede
that
guideline
.
there
be
a
precedent
whereby
a
local
authority
grant
planning
on
a
national
secondary
route
and
it
be
appeal
by
the
NRA
to
a
Bord
Pleanála
in
any
case
.
the
issuance
of
guideline
be
a
bit
of
a
sham
to
be
honest
.
sometimes
,
they
be
deliberately
put
out
there
by
minister
to
give
voice
to
the
idea
that
they
be
somehow
deal
with
a
issue
.
in
reality
,
I
have
never
see
they
have
a
effect
in
how
they
be
transpose
.
the
local
development
plan
as
pass
under
a
reserve
function
always
seem
to
take
precedent
.
in
essence
,
the
point
I
be
try
to
make
be
that
if
we
further
diminish
the
power
of
local
public
representative
to
intervene
in
plan
case
or
in
the
planning
law
,
too
much
power
will
be
cede
to
the
minister
who
may
not
have
regard
to
local
factor
and
the
grey
area
that
exist
which
might
push
a
case
one
way
or
the
other
.
if
too
much
power
be
prescribe
in
a
centralised
way
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
ability
of
a
local
authority
to
function
as
it
relate
to
planning
,
and
good
planning
at
that
.
I
fail
to
understand
the
Green
Party
's
position
on
this
.
I
state
respectfully
and
without
any
malice
that
what
deputy
Gogarty
be
say
in
effect
be
that
the
gentleman
and
lady
on
local
authority
have
receive
they
democratic
mandate
from
the
people
but
the
Green
Party
do
not
trust
they
to
exercise
that
mandate
as
it
relate
to
the
planning
process
and
therefore
it
will
instigate
a
set
of
rule
and
regulation
that
will
supersede
they
power
.
by
implication
,
what
be
state
be
that
the
people
be
wrong
.
the
people
put
in
the
councillor
and
therefore
there
be
a
implication
in
the
legislation
that
the
councillor
make
mistake
and
the
Green
Party
will
come
along
and
rectify
that
mistake
in
a
condescending
and
patronising
fashion
.
it
be
no
way
to
legislate
.
it
be
not
the
way
to
legislate
.
it
absolutely
and
utterly
patronise
the
people
on
this
side
of
the
House
who
try
to
give
voice
to
that
try
to
build
house
who
have
genuine
housing
need
and
who
want
to
retain
the
right
to
live
in
they
local
community
.
they
will
not
be
here
for
too
much
long
and
thank
God
for
it
.
then
we
can
get
to
a
situation
where
the
House
will
start
legislate
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
and
not
on
the
basis
of
—
—
—
—
the
nanny
state
,
where
a
small
rump
in
the
Parliament
can
control
how
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
can
think
.
we
need
to
move
away
from
that
line
of
legislation
.
I
be
tired
of
the
Member
to
my
right
come
to
the
House
and
day
in
day
out
use
language
that
debase
this
House
.
he
may
disagree
with
my
point
of
view
and
I
may
disagree
with
the
deputy
's
point
of
view
and
we
will
spar
but
it
be
never
personal
.
however
,
with
privilege
I
stand
before
the
people
here
as
a
member
for
Cork
East
and
I
will
not
allow
other
member
to
debase
the
House
's
legislative
programme
by
impose
legislation
that
be
undemocratic
and
will
have
serious
permutation
for
how
local
authority
will
be
able
to
operate
because
it
give
too
much
power
to
the
minister
.
I
say
that
without
use
of
bad
language
,
without
debase
the
House
and
without
bring
the
debate
down
into
the
morass
to
which
other
would
like
to
bring
it
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
I
feel
will
have
a
deep
impact
on
the
ability
of
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
deliver
acute
service
.
for
the
past
five
year
we
have
be
through
a
number
of
process
in
relation
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
include
the
Horwath
,
Wrixon
and
Teamwork
review
.
now
,
through
a
new
national
reconfiguration
process
,
the
HSE
will
seek
,
in
a
underhand
and
surreptitious
way
,
to
undermine
the
ability
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
acute
service
.
I
have
before
I
a
document
in
respect
of
this
matter
.
the
people
who
represent
the
interest
of
the
hospital
and
who
live
within
its
catchment
area
be
undergo
a
reconfiguration
process
,
head
up
by
Professor
John
Higgins
.
there
be
general
agreement
that
change
be
need
within
the
hospital
and
that
there
will
be
implication
for
the
delivery
of
acute
service
,
but
that
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
should
not
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
in
other
word
,
if
there
be
to
be
a
loss
or
diminution
of
acute
surgical
service
,
they
would
be
buttress
by
acute
medical
service
.
we
have
buy
into
that
process
and
have
be
give
assurance
in
relation
to
it
.
we
now
discover
documentation
emanate
from
the
HSE
show
that
it
seek
to
assign
to
every
hospital
in
the
country
a
new
modelling
system
range
from
1
to
4
,
depend
on
the
category
of
hospital
,
and
which
will
put
Mallow
into
the
no.
2
category
.
the
document
state
that
this
hospital
will
not
have
a
icu
so
the
patient
and
doctor
need
to
be
make
aware
that
the
resource
be
not
in
place
to
provide
the
full
spectrum
of
a
acute
hospital
resuscitation
,
that
be
,
intubation
,
ventilation
and
resuscitation
,
ivr
.
the
patient
must
give
inform
consent
and
have
knowledge
of
this
prior
to
admission
.
a
ceiling
of
care
discussion
need
to
take
place
and
be
document
with
appropriate
patient
prior
to
admission
to
this
facility
.
the
document
go
on
to
say
that
standard
of
care
should
be
measure
and
comparable
to
that
deliver
at
a
model
3
and
model
4
hospital
.
a
model
3
or
4
hospital
would
be
the
equivalent
of
Cork
University
Hospital
,
which
be
a
tertiary
centre
and
the
near
geographically
to
Mallow
.
I
demand
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Pat
Healy
,
regional
director
of
operation
for
the
HSE
south
region
.
I
demand
respectfully
,
as
be
my
right
as
a
Oireachtas
Member
,
a
meeting
with
Ms
Laverne
McGuinness
and
Mr.
Brian
Gilroy
,
who
be
in
charge
of
efficiency
,
and
I
demand
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
Health
and
Children
discuss
this
document
because
it
will
have
serious
implication
for
the
delivery
of
acute
care
.
by
a
surreptitious
and
secretive
method
,
the
HSE
will
seek
to
diminish
the
ability
of
Mallow
to
deliver
acute
care
.
if
a
ceiling
of
care
discussion
have
to
take
place
on
every
admission
,
most
people
will
not
be
admit
to
the
hospital
and
will
have
to
go
to
CUH
,
thereby
reduce
the
ability
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
deliver
service
.
there
be
many
scenario
where
resuscitation
might
be
appropriate
for
a
individual
on
whom
a
"
do
not
resuscitate
"
order
have
be
place
,
for
example
,
anaphylactic
reaction
to
a
infusion
.
such
a
notion
have
major
consequence
for
the
status
and
reputation
of
a
hospital
and
for
the
esteem
of
that
work
there
.
discussion
about
ceiling
of
care
as
espouse
in
this
process
be
,
in
most
clinical
situation
,
unnecessary
and
often
inappropriate
and
counter
-
productive
.
I
wonder
if
divide
patient
into
category
of
access
with
regard
to
resuscitation
be
unconstitutional
,
in
that
it
would
negate
the
rights
of
a
patient
.
number
in
the
hospital
would
be
so
reduce
that
it
would
not
be
viable
.
that
be
what
be
at
play
here
.
this
be
a
attempt
by
the
HSE
at
national
level
to
undermine
the
local
reconfiguration
process
which
all
of
the
stakeholder
have
buy
into
.
we
recognise
that
change
be
need
but
it
seem
the
HSE
be
try
push
through
a
plan
whereby
hospital
like
Mallow
will
no
long
be
able
to
provide
acute
care
,
whether
medical
or
surgical
,
and
the
4500
people
who
be
serve
in
a
acute
setting
in
Mallow
will
have
make
they
way
through
CUH
,
which
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
that
service
because
the
capital
investment
have
not
be
make
there
.
we
need
transparency
.
I
be
ask
,
as
be
my
right
as
a
Oireachtas
member
represent
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
for
a
meeting
with
the
HSE
at
national
level
so
that
I
can
learn
what
plan
be
afoot
and
what
surreptitious
method
be
be
employ
in
the
downgrade
of
hospital
like
Mallow
.

people
who
have
a
genuine
regard
for
field
sport
and
for
the
welfare
of
the
animal
they
keep
.
for
the
most
part
,
they
be
not
in
it
for
the
primary
motivation
of
profit
,
in
the
sense
of
develop
breeding
establishment
.
the
gain
for
such
people
be
a
potential
win
at
such
a
venue
as
Clonmel
or
Youghal
and
for
the
love
of
the
sport
.
there
be
no
fiduciary
gain
for
the
most
part
.
most
of
this
people
have
be
involved
in
the
sport
at
a
intergenerational
level
.
if
a
book
be
keep
of
they
expense
,
one
could
be
guarantee
that
they
have
make
a
loss
during
the
year
they
have
be
involved
in
the
sport
.
the
primary
motivation
be
not
profit
but
a
love
of
the
pursuit
of
the
sport
.
it
be
genuine
and
integral
for
this
people
.
it
be
a
affront
to
insult
this
people
with
some
of
the
language
I
have
hear
from
various
side
of
the
House
and
we
must
speak
for
they
.
we
wish
to
speak
for
they
in
a
modest
and
reasonable
way
.
what
be
the
current
state
of
negotiation
between
the
Minister
's
Department
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
if
there
be
such
negotiation
,
regard
pend
legislation
?
be
there
a
timeframe
?
be
there
head
of
a
Bill
for
amend
legislation
?
what
be
the
status
of
the
propose
amendment
to
the
1958
Act
?
there
have
not
be
enough
clarity
on
that
.
we
be
be
ask
to
pass
legislation
on
the
basis
of
a
leap
of
faith
.
in
essence
,
a
greyhound
owner
look
at
the
legislation
who
have
not
be
in
touch
with
the
icc
or
Bord
to
gcon
in
the
past
number
of
week
would
not
be
aware
of
what
negotiation
have
take
place
.
therefore
,
there
be
still
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
proposal
.
if
member
be
be
ask
to
pass
this
legislation
,
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
the
substantive
nature
of
that
negotiation
,
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
outcome
of
that
deliberation
,
and
if
we
be
to
have
regard
and
to
have
trust
in
the
minister
or
the
government
of
the
day
to
deliver
the
right
kind
of
amendment
to
the
1958
Act
.
we
be
try
to
clear
the
way
in
respect
of
the
body
of
animal
welfare
legislation
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
agree
with
we
line
of
question
in
that
we
be
merely
seek
clarification
.
we
seek
clarification
on
the
negotiation
with
the
icc
and
Bord
to
gCon
regard
the
role
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
vis-à
-
vo
the
amend
1958
legislation
.
the
second
point
concern
how
specifically
that
act
will
be
amend
.
the
animal
welfare
Bill
be
under
the
auspices
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
on
no
few
than
ten
occasion
,
the
Labour
Party
have
ask
the
Taoiseach
when
that
legislation
will
be
publish
.
we
do
not
have
a
Bill
before
we
even
though
we
be
tell
it
will
be
publish
in
the
autumn
.
if
this
be
on
the
C
list
of
the
government
's
legislative
programme
,
where
be
the
balance
of
priority
and
how
do
the
minister
envisage
its
implementation
?
will
legislation
enact
now
be
supersede
by
that
legislation
or
be
it
separate
?
it
be
very
confusing
.
I
be
relatively
new
to
this
game
but
I
be
try
to
speak
with
common
sense
.
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
all
I
seek
from
he
be
some
clear
unambiguous
answer
to
which
member
be
entitle
.
the
minister
should
be
ministerial
.
the
minister
should
behave
with
the
appropriate
level
of
decorum
and
should
not
behave
like
a
schoolboy
.
the
minister
should
cut
to
the
chase
.
perhaps
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
should
be
bring
in
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
Minister
's
second
stage
speech
where
he
state
:
I
have
also
state
that
I
understand
the
legitimate
concern
of
certain
industry
sector
,
such
as
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
,
and
I
be
prepared
to
accommodate
they
as
good
I
can
.
for
that
reason
it
be
propose
that
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
would
amend
the
Greyhound
Industry
Act
1958
to
legislate
for
welfare
provision
for
member
of
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
.
we
note
the
word
"
welfare
provision
"
.
give
that
the
minister
have
state
that
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
indication
today
of
what
will
be
in
the
amend
legislation
,
which
we
accept
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
be
no
ambiguity
and
so
that
the
greyhound
industry
be
not
place
in
a
position
where
it
be
take
a
giant
leap
of
faith
in
term
of
what
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
might
offer
by
way
of
the
amend
legislation
,
we
propose
a
amendment
that
would
make
it
clear
and
unambiguous
as
to
where
the
minister
's
intention
lie
.
if
he
be
to
support
the
amendment
that
would
give
great
solace
to
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
,
the
Irish
Coursing
Club
and
to
every
single
dog
owner
throughout
the
country
who
course
hare
or
race
greyhound
in
such
place
as
Curraheen
Park
and
Youghal
.

on
9
August
,
when
the
Dáil
be
in
recess
,
HIQA
announce
a
investigation
into
ongoing
service
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
tonight
I
want
to
put
forward
the
view
of
that
I
represent
who
have
a
particular
interest
in
the
investigation
and
who
feel
strongly
that
it
be
spurious
and
unnecessary
.
the
investigation
be
announce
on
the
basis
of
a
specific
complaint
about
procedure
from
someone
at
the
hospital
.
we
now
know
that
be
not
the
case
,
and
know
there
be
no
specific
incident
related
to
the
treatment
of
a
person
.
we
also
know
the
investigation
arise
from
the
fact
that
in
April
2009
,
HIQA
publish
the
report
of
the
investigation
into
the
quality
and
safety
or
service
in
Ennis
,
that
there
would
be
recommendation
arise
from
that
,
and
that
a
report
would
follow
for
Mallow
,
which
be
a
similar
hospital
but
that
have
never
be
put
forward
by
the
HSE
.
it
be
on
foot
of
that
alone
that
HIQA
decide
to
go
into
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
the
process
at
present
be
that
HIQA
have
meet
representative
of
the
hospital
and
the
staff
and
be
continue
its
investigation
.
the
staff
at
the
hospital
operate
in
constrain
circumstance
and
be
punch
above
they
weight
.
in
June
,
after
many
year
of
campaigning
,
a
executive
management
board
be
finally
put
in
place
.
the
hospital
be
under
the
auspices
of
CUH
but
for
year
it
be
leave
on
its
own
,
devoid
of
support
from
the
large
hospital
.
I
will
bet
money
that
when
the
report
be
publish
,
it
will
clearly
show
that
the
staff
and
personnel
at
the
hospital
have
deliver
,
in
spite
of
the
HSE
bear
down
on
they
while
refuse
to
put
in
place
adequate
funding
.
this
report
will
vindicate
the
doctor
,
nurse
and
other
staff
in
the
hospital
by
show
they
be
in
no
way
negligent
and
be
do
more
than
they
should
to
deliver
service
.
it
will
also
show
that
management
structure
be
inadequate
and
the
HSE
never
properly
resource
the
administrative
function
at
the
hospital
,
which
lead
to
inadequacy
in
term
of
report
procedure
.
it
will
also
show
that
CUH
never
adequately
recognise
Mallow
for
the
facility
it
be
as
part
of
its
operation
.
I
want
to
point
out
that
the
staff
support
the
hospital
and
maintain
that
service
can
be
modify
.
they
be
willing
to
work
with
the
HSE
to
achieve
that
and
doctor
,
nurse
and
staff
will
buy
into
the
change
management
process
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
reduce
service
facility
,
however
,
or
to
see
the
hospital
's
capacity
be
sacrifice
on
the
HSE
's
altar
of
cost
efficiency
.
this
be
key
because
we
will
modify
service
but
we
must
not
reduce
capacity
.
we
can
deliver
the
service
within
the
hospital
but
we
must
be
give
the
opportunity
to
do
so
.

early
today
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
state
the
follow
:
today
,
we
have
be
give
more
bad
news
about
the
two
institution
to
which
I
refer
.
the
Financial
Times
state
that
the
cost
in
respect
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
will
be
€35
billion
and
€
5
billion
for
the
tiny
building
society
that
be
know
as
Irish
nationwide
.
that
be
the
pass
to
which
the
minister
and
he
leader
,
the
Taoiseach
,
have
bring
this
country
.
today
be
black
Thursday
and
the
minister
and
he
party
,
Fianna
Fáil
,
will
be
remember
for
visit
it
upon
this
country
.
I
be
a
optimistic
person
by
nature
.
I
come
into
this
House
in
2007
as
a
Opposition
deputy
.
when
my
party
,
the
Labour
Party
,
be
elect
to
govern
this
country
,
how
will
we
get
it
out
of
the
economic
maelstrom
in
which
we
find
ourselves
?
to
say
it
will
be
a
herculean
task
be
to
put
it
mildly
.
I
listen
intently
to
the
contribution
from
the
Fianna
Fáil
side
of
the
House
,
which
look
backwards
in
they
analysis
of
the
situation
.
they
do
not
give
I
grounds
for
optimism
.
it
be
especially
disheartening
to
hear
someone
of
my
own
generation
,
deputy
Thomas
Byrne
,
seek
to
undermine
the
Labour
Party
as
part
of
he
contribution
to
a
debate
on
the
financial
institution
as
they
be
now
.
when
the
deputy
refer
to
Labour
's
2007
manifesto
and
the
promise
or
aspiration
contain
therein
,
he
neglect
to
mention
that
that
promise
and
aspiration
be
base
on
figure
that
be
then
in
the
public
domain
.
the
figure
to
which
I
refer
be
provide
by
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
plan
in
the
manifesto
be
cost
in
respect
of
the
economic
climate
that
obtain
at
that
time
.
it
be
not
credible
for
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
to
attack
the
Labour
Party
for
what
have
happen
in
the
past
two
year
,
even
if
do
so
be
part
of
some
defence
mechanism
.
I
have
state
publicly
on
previous
occasion
that
I
have
a
great
regard
for
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Mansergh
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
depth
of
knowledge
he
possess
and
the
value
he
espouse
.
however
,
the
Minister
of
State
indicate
early
that
because
Madame
Christine
Lagarde
have
bestow
she
imprimatur
on
the
strategy
that
have
be
adopt
,
this
be
somehow
a
justification
—
—
—
—
for
that
strategy
.
Madame
Lagarde
be
representative
of
the
centre
right
in
France
and
be
a
member
of
President
Sarkozy
's
government
.
I
would
not
be
look
to
France
in
search
of
a
degree
of
comfort
or
solace
with
regard
to
this
country
's
current
economic
position
.
we
be
,
however
,
very
fortunate
that
we
be
part
of
the
European
Union
and
that
we
have
access
to
the
European
Central
Bank
,
ECB
.
I
suspect
the
latter
shore
up
we
position
in
respect
of
the
bond
issue
in
recent
week
.
I
would
be
anxious
to
discover
the
degree
to
which
the
ECB
interven
in
this
regard
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
this
be
a
black
day
.
however
,
I
be
move
to
state
that
I
be
of
a
generation
that
benefit
from
the
fact
that
,
socially
,
politically
and
economically
,
Ireland
look
outwards
during
the
1980
and
1990
.
we
draw
economic
strength
from
the
pooling
of
sovereignty
that
occur
with
we
European
neighbour
at
that
time
.
as
a
result
of
this
,
people
of
my
generation
benefit
by
be
able
to
travel
,
obtain
a
education
and
gain
proper
employment
.
in
the
late
1990
and
early
2000s
,
however
,
we
think
we
could
go
it
alone
.
we
become
extremely
greedy
and
selfish
and
begin
to
look
inwards
again
.
in
order
to
claw
we
way
out
of
the
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
we
will
be
oblige
to
look
outwards
once
again
.
we
must
work
with
we
European
neighbour
in
order
to
find
solution
to
the
economic
problem
that
exist
.
I
sit
the
leave
certificate
in
1991
.
I
be
of
the
generation
which
benefit
from
the
abolition
of
university
fee
.
many
of
the
other
member
of
my
generation
who
also
benefit
in
this
way
travel
the
world
for
a
number
of
year
and
return
to
Ireland
when
the
economic
climate
appear
bright
.
this
people
,
some
of
whom
be
friend
of
mine
,
get
married
,
have
child
and
buy
house
for
astronomical
price
.
it
be
we
generation
that
will
be
oblige
to
pay
for
the
profligacy
and
disastrous
economic
policy
prefer
by
the
so
-
call
Republican
party
.
if
it
be
give
the
opportunity
to
govern
,
the
Labour
Party
,
and
people
of
my
generation
,
will
get
we
out
of
the
morass
to
which
I
refer
.
in
the
past
it
be
the
Labour
Party
which
make
the
ultimate
sacrifice
.
during
previous
period
of
severe
economic
difficulty
,
it
be
my
party
which
take
the
tough
decision
that
be
necessary
to
place
the
country
back
on
a
even
keel
.
the
country
have
be
hole
below
the
water
line
but
we
be
not
beat
yet
.
I
refuse
to
be
beat
.
I
be
of
that
generation
of
politician
whose
member
will
be
oblige
to
look
not
two
or
three
but
rather
20
year
hence
in
order
to
identify
how
we
want
we
society
to
develop
.
we
will
be
oblige
to
set
down
a
formula
to
achieve
we
goal
in
this
regard
.
the
figure
that
emerge
early
today
mean
the
next
government
,
of
which
I
be
sure
Labour
will
be
a
part
,
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
context
of
be
able
to
repair
the
damage
that
have
be
do
.
that
be
a
message
which
must
be
put
across
.
we
will
not
give
up
on
the
Irish
people
.
although
there
be
a
air
of
despair
and
depression
in
this
Parliament
today
,
I
can
inform
the
Minister
of
State
that
we
will
fight
with
every
fibre
of
we
being
in
order
to
try
to
claw
we
way
out
of
we
current
difficulty
.
the
Irish
people
will
do
so
because
they
be
resourceful
.
deputy
Quinn
refer
to
the
time
he
spend
as
minister
for
Finance
.
when
it
be
once
again
in
government
,
the
Labour
Party
will
work
to
claw
the
country
out
of
the
mess
in
which
it
currently
find
itself
.
we
may
,
as
in
the
past
,
pay
the
ultimate
price
by
lose
the
general
election
which
follow
.
however
,
we
will
do
what
be
necessary
because
we
be
patriot
.
we
will
not
do
what
be
require
for
personal
gain
,
we
will
do
it
because
we
believe
in
this
country
and
its
people
.
it
will
take
a
great
deal
of
time
to
do
what
need
to
be
do
.
a
message
must
be
send
to
the
people
that
it
will
be
the
Labour
Party
that
will
rectify
the
problem
cause
by
the
policy
that
be
follow
during
the
past
13
year
.
it
will
not
be
easy
and
the
people
know
that
.
what
citizen
want
be
some
honesty
.
if
the
Labour
Party
be
honest
and
state
that
the
next
five
year
be
go
to
be
tough
but
that
there
will
be
a
point
below
which
no
citizen
will
be
permit
to
fall
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
the
people
will
give
we
the
chance
to
do
what
be
require
.
that
be
all
we
be
seek
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
a
article
by
Colm
Keena
in
the
Irish
Times
on
21
September
.
Mr.
Keena
report
that
:
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
have
indicate
he
believe
the
December
budget
should
involve
a
package
of
cut
in
excess
of
€
3
billion
so
Ireland
can
keep
reduce
its
deficit
on
track
.
Prof
Patrick
Honohan
say
yesterday
the
government
's
multi-year
plan
for
reduce
the
deficit
need
"
explicit
reprogramming
"
and
this
be
"
clearly
necessary
soon
"
.
he
do
not
want
to
go
into
detail
for
any
give
year
,
but
there
be
a
overall
need
for
reprogramming
...
if
the
economy
stay
on
track
with
what
have
be
initially
envisage
,
the
deficit
would
come
close
to
3
per
cent
by
2014
.
"
but
as
the
IMF
and
other
have
note
,
the
real
economy
,
the
price
level
and
interest
rate
on
government
borrowing
have
evolve
in
a
less
favourable
way
.
service
of
the
additional
debt

to
bank
restructuring

a
negative
factor
.
"
with
the
passage
of
time
,
one
come
to
learn
what
be
mean
when
language
be
use
in
a
certain
way
.
the
term
"
explicit
programming
"
be
code
for
state
that
a
deficit
target
of
3
%
by
2014
be
just
not
tenable
.
that
be
particularly
true
in
light
of
the
figure
produce
today
.
where
do
this
leave
we
?
deputy
Coveney
bring
some
degree
of
realism
to
the
debate
by
outline
a
agree
approach
in
term
of
how
we
might
proceed
.
I
be
sure
the
deputy
's
thought
in
this
regard
be
base
on
he
experience
as
a
mep
.
in
Europe
,
programme
be
multi-annual
in
nature
and
there
be
a
political
consensus
in
respect
of
they
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
European
partner
will
allow
for
the
fact
that
the
banking
crisis
have
cost
we
so
much
that
any
servicing
of
a
deficit
or
any
stimulus
package
will
be
a
major
challenge
and
that
we
need
some
degree
of
stability
and
political
consensus
as
to
how
that
might
be
reach
.
a
election
tomorrow
morning
would
clear
the
air
and
allow
for
a
alternative
government
to
be
able
to
tell
the
people
that
we
be
start
on
a
new
footing
.
we
could
also
say
to
we
partner
in
the
European
Union
and
the
European
Commission
that
there
be
a
new
impetus
as
to
how
we
can
get
ourselves
out
of
the
mess
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
but
that
it
might
take
long
than
the
period
envisage
in
the
target
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
less
than
the
3
%
by
2014
.
Ireland
be
a
test
bed
and
there
be
no
paradigm
for
where
we
be
at
the
moment
.
nobody
in
Europe
can
judge
how
this
will
pan
out
.
it
would
be
fundamentally
dishonest
for
I
as
a
representative
of
the
people
of
Cork
East
to
say
that
I
know
exactly
what
the
answer
be
because
I
do
not
.
I
be
try
to
grapple
with
this
figure
and
it
be
impossible
.
it
would
be
wrong
of
I
to
claim
there
be
a
model
for
where
Ireland
be
now
,
which
be
why
we
need
to
work
outwardly
and
why
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
will
ultimately
be
we
saviour
.
many
of
my
fellow
citizen
would
claim
that
some
of
the
blame
for
this
should
be
lay
at
the
door
of
Europe
.
when
people
speak
of
Europe
they
do
so
as
a
concept
that
be
somehow
out
there
,
but
we
be
Europe
.
while
we
may
be
on
the
periphery
geographically
,
we
be
part
of
that
decision
-
making
process
and
we
may
need
more
help
from
we
European
neighbour
to
ensure
that
we
can
rebuild
from
the
ash
of
a
republic
that
be
in
a
terrible
state
at
the
moment
.
I
believe
in
this
republic
and
that
we
can
find
a
way
out
of
this
.
we
must
not
be
afraid
to
take
tough
decision
to
ensure
we
citizen
have
some
hope
for
the
future
.
we
should
not
give
up
or
give
in
to
a
body
such
as
the
IMF
.
we
sovereignty
must
mean
something
more
than
just
a
economic
value
.
we
need
to
recreate
the
value
system
or
go
back
to
previous
value
system
we
have
in
this
country
and
work
in
partnership
with
we
European
Union
neighbour
to
look
outwardly
for
some
solution
to
the
problem
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
now
that
the
banking
system
have
be
bring
into
temporary
public
ownership
it
need
to
go
through
a
major
overhaul
.
the
culture
that
exist
,
which
have
not
change
since
September
2008
,
must
be
revisit
.
if
the
guarantee
that
be
provide
in
2008
have
not
change
the
banking
culture
and
people
in
the
real
economy
be
still
suffer
owe
to
lack
of
credit
,
then
give
that
we
have
take
this
bank
into
temporary
public
ownership
we
should
do
whatever
we
deem
necessary
on
behalf
of
the
people
to
ensure
that
bank
be
function
as
they
should
and
we
should
make
no
apology
for
that
.
we
have
be
too
deferential
to
the
banking
mogul
here
.
I
have
search
the
Statute
Book
to
ascertain
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
bring
this
guy
out
in
handcuffs
and
do
the
perp
walk
as
famously
mention
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Gormley
.
I
know
a
change
in
the
constitution
and
a
change
in
law
would
be
require
to
effect
that
.
how
many
of
they
have
be
arrest
and
bring
before
the
court
for
threaten
the
very
sovereignty
of
the
State
?
the
silver
-
haired
fox
in
the
Department
of
Finance
and
that
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
side
of
the
House
have
leave
the
people
of
my
generation
and
the
people
of
the
generation
to
come
after
I
with
a
albatross
of
debt
around
they
neck
.
Fianna
Fáil
politician
have
the
temerity
to
come
out
and
attack
the
Labour
Party
.
what
be
patriotism
?
they
be
not
patriot
and
never
be
.
they
be
self
-
interested
and
always
be
.
now
be
the
time
for
patriotism
and
for
honesty
in
order
to
restore
this
republic
and
give
it
some
sense
of
dignity
.
in

should
get
out

go

the
motion
speak
to
the
very
notion
of
capacity
and
that
there
will
be
no
further
loss
of
capacity
.
we
support
that
very
notion
.
in
regard
to
the
reconfiguration
process
,
in
particular
as
it
pertain
to
hospital
such
as
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
there
be
often
the
accusation
that
we
be
be
overtly
parochial
.
it
must
be
remember
that
a
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
will
serve
more
than
100000
people
and
will
have
approximately
100
gps
refer
to
it
.
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
under
the
umbrella
of
Cork
University
Hospital
but
there
be
a
deficiency
in
that
Cork
University
Hospital
have
never
view
Mallow
General
Hospital
as
be
under
its
umbrella
or
its
ambit
.
the
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
be
in
the
hospital
currently
.
a
case
be
be
make
in
regard
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
by
all
of
the
stakeholder
,
include
the
hospital
representative
group
,
the
gps
and
the
consultant
,
that
we
will
accept
change
.
we
accept
change
management
and
that
there
be
budgetary
constraint
but
we
want
a
more
lateral
view
to
be
take
by
the
HSE
in
regard
to
the
future
capacity
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
we
will
accept
change
in
regard
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
but
one
can
do
that
and
save
money
without
reduce
capacity
.
what
be
need
be
for
the
sister
hospital
,
Cork
University
Hospital
,
and
the
HSE
to
think
more
laterally
about
how
they
deploy
resource
from
the
centre
to
the
margin
to
serve
this
community
such
that
one
do
not
have
a
bottleneck
effect
,
that
be
,
a
reduction
of
capacity
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
filter
through
to
Cork
University
Hospital
and
thereby
undermine
the
capacity
which
will
not
be
there
because
the
budgetary
provision
will
not
be
make
to
allow
for
increase
capacity
at
Cork
University
Hospital
.
we
speak
common
sense
.
large
swathe
of
the
population
be
serve
by
the
hospital
mention
in
the
motion
.
we
note
that
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
not
mention
in
the
Fine
Gael
motion
but
I
be
sure
that
be
a
oversight
on
its
part
.
we
speak
for
that
hospital
and
support
the

in
that
regard

can

I
find

strange
that
it

position
with
that

many
of

this

I
be
pleased
with
the
progress
to
date
under
the
RDP
,
which
continue
to
facilitate
access
to
significant
financial
resource
for
rural
community
since
it

result
in

which
be
provide
invaluable
support
to

and
there
be
no
question
of

divert
away
from

the

currently
have
register
project
activity
of
€
71
million
,
with
almost
€
30
million
at
a
advanced
stage
of
development

expenditure

date
amount
to
almost
€
47
million
,
which
include
funding
for
a
diverse
range
of
project
from
support

the
build
and
maintenance
of
community
infrastructure
and
the
provision
of
training
in
a
variety
of
discipline
for
rural
dweller
.
I
be
confident
that
all
of
the
activity
fund
under

date
be
contribute
to
the
creation
of
the
right
condition
for

lag
to
explore
all
possible

the
maximum
possible
resource
be
employ
to
drive
a
export
-
lead
economic
recovery
and
the
development
of
a
smart
economy
.
there
be
a
sense
in
which
food
and
the
agrifood
sector
have
take
a
back
seat
in
the
past
20
year
because
of
the
government
's
blind
faith
in
the
construction
industry
.
I
be
glad
this
rearguard
action
have
come
at
a
time
when
there
be
a
latent
realisation
that
agriculture
be
vital
to
the
country
's
need
and
its
future
development
.
the
report
's
aspiration
be
a
return
to
basic
with
clear
target
and
a
vision
set
out
.
the
agrifood
sector
have
see
a
shift
over
the
past
several
year
from
commodity
-
base
supply
to
a
brand
-
cent
and
consumer
-
focus
approach
.
that
,
in
itself
,
present
challenge
.
how
will
we
ensure
the
shift
from
a
commodity
-
base
supply
to
add
gross
value
to
food
produce
?
the
government
's
claim
that
the
smart
economy
will
be
the
foundation
for
economic
renewal
be
still
nebulous
.
one
can
apply
smart
economy
principle
to
the
idea
of
food
and
food
production
but
it
need
to
be
flesh
out
more
.
the
food
harvest
2020
report
point
out
the
smart
economy
will
ensure
the
primary
producer
will
have
high
value
output
and
reduce
cost
while
maintain
high
productivity
.
it
also
claim
the
food
industry
will
have
more
target
research
and
development
component
,
will
collaborate
more
and
will
respond
to
the
market
in
a
more
enhance
fashion
.
this
be
wonderful
term
which
I
would
readily
endorse
but
how
will
this
all
happen
?
there
should
be
a
follow
-
up
document
to
flesh
out
this
language
,
which
be
a
little
too
nebulous
.
there
should
also
be
concrete
action
plan
for
implement
the
policy
,
if
we
be
to
support
it
.
we
support
the
aspiration
in
the
document
.
from
a
consumer
's
point
of
view
,
the
smart
economy
can
facilitate
a
more
inform
choice
and
lead
to
more
innovative
product
range
.
there
must
also
be
a
educational
component
in
the
policy
.
when
we
talk
about
the
smart
approach
,
we
must
include
a
great
partnership
between
industry
and
science
,
foster
the
entrepreneurial
culture
and
innovation
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
agrifood
sector
's
position
within
the
smart
economy
be
recognise
and
act
on
in
real
term
.
the
Labour
Party
agree
that
we
have
a
opportunity
in
this
policy
document
to
deepen
the
link
with
green
issue
.
we
natural
environment
and
the
fact
that
we
have
a
grass
-
base
agricultural
system
comprise
one
of
we
great
comparative
advantage
,
but
the
mere
recognition
of
this
fact
be
not
sufficient
.
we
must
develop
a
deep
approach
to
what
it
mean
.
we
talk
about
Ireland
be
a
green
country
and
the
opportunity
arise
from
that
comparative
advantage
,
but
how
do
we
take
that
aspiration
forward
?
the
opportunity
arise
from
the
green
economy
be
clear
from
the
point
of
view
of
primary
producer
,
the
food
industry
,
consumer
and
the
country
.
there
be
very
transparent
method
of
production
and
full
traceability
in
food
production
.
this
should
be
a
comparative
advantage
relative
to
third
country
that
be
try
to
export
into
the
European
Union
.
the
fact
that
it
be
a
grass
-
base
agricultural
system
mean
we
have
natural
resource
benefit
,
as
outline
in
the
document
,
but
a
great
role
for
agriculture
in
the
economic
recovery
require
that
European
Union
funding
for
that
aim
be
enhance
or
at
least
preserve
at
current
level
.
we
welcome
the
document
and
the
global
context
outline
in
it
.
there
will
be
massive
demand
for
food
due
to
population
growth
.
as
the
document
state
,
the
world
's
population
in
1999
pass
the
6
billion
threshold
and
be
due
to
reach
7
billion
in
2010
.
by
2025
,
it
be
expect
to
reach
8
billion
.
that
present
a
massive
opportunity
for
this
country
.
give
the
increase
desertification
due
to
climate
change
in
other
region
and
peripheral
nation
,
Ireland
's
grass
-
base
agriculture
should
mean
it
be
well
place
to
benefit
,
particularly
within
the
dairy
sector
where
we
anticipate
Ireland
become
a
major
global
player
.
when
we
consider
the
dairy
sector
we
traditionally
think
of
brand
such
as
Kerrygold
.
Liquid
milk
be
a
major
commodity
but
the
cap
proposal
that
be
due
to
be
publish
in
November
by
the
European
Commission
will
pose
a
threat
to
the
national
envelope
of
approximately
€
1.3
billion
that
Ireland
receive
.
if
there
be
a
reduction
in
that
budget
,
it
could
cause
challenge
for
the
dairy
sector
and
undermine
the
policy
the
government
be
seek
to
roll
out
under
food
harvest
2020
.
the
Irish
Co-operative
Organisation
Society
,
ICOS
,
be
hold
its
national
conference
this
week
and
one
of
the
issue
it
will
address
be
how
the
dairy
sector
will
prepare
for
the
end
of
milk
quota
.
this
will
present
a
challenge
for
co-operative
in
Ireland
.
the
question
be
whether
the
co-operative
movement
in
its
current
form
will
be
well
place
to
meet
the
twofold
challenge
of
the
increase
in
the
global
population
,
and
the
increase
demand
that
go
with
it
,
and
the
post
-
milk
quota
situation
.
will
Ireland
be
able
to
make
the
change
necessary
to
ensure
the
amount
of
milk
be
produce
can
be
increase
by
the
anticipate
50
%
which
be
deem
possible
under
a
quota
free
regime
?
everything
we
use
be
home
produce
and
net
input
and
output
be
local
.
in
a
increase
market
for
dairy
product
,
there
should
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
Irish
economy
as
a
result
.
this
will
obviously
add
to
growth
figure
.
one
of
the
matter
due
to
be
discuss
at
the
ICOS
national
conference
be
the
cost
of
prepare
for
high
milk
output
.
how
will
the
relationship
between
farmer
,
who
be
shareholder
,
and
they
co-operative
continue
in
the
post
-
quota
situation
?
what
will
the
nature
of
that
relationship
be
after
2013
and
will
farmer
be
able
to
embrace
the
challenge
?
I
believe
they
will
.
many
people
in
the
dairy
sector
be
vie
to
gear
up
for
that
eventuality
,
but
there
be
also
a
generational
shift
in
that
regard
.
there
will
have
to
be
a
common
mechanism
to
regulate
milk
production
and
it
must
have
a
all
-
island
approach
.
whether
it
be
a
all
-
island
or
one
Ireland
approach
be
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
we
believe
there
should
be
a
deepening
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
part
of
the
island
to
achieve
such
a
common
mechanism
.
there
must
be
a
consensus
between
co-operative
with
regard
to
the
potential
for
the
dairy
sector
and
this
can
only
come
from
the
people
who
own
the
co-operative
.
it
will
probably
require
a
change
in
mindset
and
a
more
lateral
view
as
to
how
we
can
look
at
the
market
strategically
.
it
have
be
suggest
that
Ireland
could
become
another
New
Zealand
or
that
perhaps
Ireland
should
ally
itself
with
New
Zealand
to
create
a
type
of
duopoly
to
control
milk
supply
from
grass
-
feed
cattle
.
this
be
necessary
to
compete
in
a
global
market
and
we
should
not
be
ashamed
to
look
strategically
at
how
that
can
happen
.
there
be
a
critique
of
the
New
Zealand
model
in
that
land
ownership
structure
be
more
fluid
there
than
they
be
here
,
which
facilitate
the
existence
of
that
model
.
here
it
be
a
little
more
difficult
due
to
the
great
tie
to
the
land
,
but
that
be
a
challenge
which
should
be
examine
.
the
key
point
be
that
we
should
take
a
more
lateral
view
in
term
of
how
to
gain
a
great
foothold
in
the
global
dairy
market
.
if
form
strategic
alliance
be
require
,
we
should
at
least
examine
the
possibility
even
if
they
do
not
come
to
fruition
.
we
must
take
a
more
lateral
view
in
form
we
strategy
.
accord
to
food
harvest
2020
,
there
will
be
a
increase
in
the
global
population
.
the
question
for
Ireland
be
how
to
maximise
that
potential
.
the
theory
be
that
the
dairy
sector
must
consolidate
further
and
traditional
behaviour
must
be
examine
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
we
increase
we
milk
supply
to
cater
for
that
demand
.
the
success
of
food
harvest
2020
will
be
predicate
on
ensure
that
more
young
farmer
enter
the
sector
.
this
should
become
a
priority
.
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
there
be
a
report
by
Macra
to
Feirme
indicate
that
less
than
7
%
of
Europe
's
farmer
be
under
the
age
of
35
year
.
the
food
harvest
2020
report
put
emphasis
on
give
young
people
access
to
farming
but
the
educational
aspect
of
that
must
be
examine
more
deeply
.
if
the
strategy
be
to
be
successful
,
it
must
be
base
on
a
clear
and
unambiguous
need
to
provide
active
measure
to
ensure
participation
rate
by
young
people
.
there
be
a
suggestion
that
if
there
be
specific
scheme
for
young
people
under
the
new
CAP
,
it
would
go
a
long
way
towards
address
the
challenge
of
ensure
a
throughput
of
new
farmer
.
the
policy
would
bear
fruit
arise
from
that
.
member
be
familiar
with
the
adage
that
it
be
hard
to
teach
a
old
dog
new
trick
.
if
there
be
a
throughput
of
young
farmer
,
they
would
be
well
able
to
adapt
to
new
method
and
will
bring
forward
the
policy
as
necessary
.
one
of
the
key
deficiency
in
the
report
be
the
lack
of
a
coherent
chapter
on
education
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
have
the
target
of
increase
the
value
of
the
primary
output
in
agriculture
,
fishery
and
forestry
by
€
1.5
billion
or
33
%
compare
to
the
2007
to
2009
average
,
increase
the
value
add
in
agriculture
,
food
,
fishery
and
wood
product
by
€
3
billion
or
a
40
%
increase
on
2005
and
have
a
export
target
of
€
12
billion
for
the
sector
,
represent
a
42
%
increase
compare
to
2007
to
2009
,
but
if
that
be
to
be
achieve
there
will
have
to
be
a
more
fundamental
educational
input
for
the
reason
I
have
outline
.
even
though
innovation
be
take
place
in
the
beef
,
dairy
and
wood
sector
,
if
the
age
profile
of
farmer
be
high
there
will
be
a
lag
time
in
reach
that
target
.
it
will
be
necessary
to
increase
the
throughput
of
young
people
who
be
educate
specifically
to
achieve
that
target
.
if
the
overall
vision
be
base
on
act
smart
,
think
green
and
achieve
growth
and
if
the
Department
be
try
to
prioritise
research
and
development
,
improve
skill
level
,
increase
good
practice
,
foster
creativity
and
improve
consumer
preference
,
this
can
only
be
achieve
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
current
paradigm
.
in
other
word
,
the
underlying
assumption
need
to
change
.
the
Labour
Party
's
view
be
that
there
have
to
be
a
root
and
branch
review
of
the
educational
aspect
of
how
to
proceed
.
we
acknowledge
that
centre
of
excellence
like
ucc
,
which
have
specialist
knowledge
food
production
,
should
be
incorporate
into
the
roll
-
out
of
this
policy
and
become
active
stakeholder
.
we
also
need
to
overhaul
subject
such
as
agricultural
science
at
second
level
.
a
farming
-
related
model
or
a
food
-
related
model
-
module
of
education
could
be
introduce
into
the
leave
certificate
curriculum
to
develop
,
foster
and
create
the
aspiration
outline
in
the
overall
vision
.
we
believe
that
the
young
people
start
,
especially
in
second
level
institution
,
the
more
of
a
opportunity
there
will
be
to
create
the
coterie
of
food
and
agribusiness
entrepreneur
need
to
sustain
the
policy
.
if
it
be
a
2020
strategy
,
it
have
to
be
implement
on
the
basis
of
ensure
that
we
start
now
and
we
start
at
second
level
to
ensure
more
people
be
bring
through
the
educational
system
with
a
focus
on
food
production
and
all
that
entail
.
there
be
major
challenge
in
the
fiscal
and
economic
context
.
the
report
issue
by
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Enterprise
,
trade
and
Innovation
under
rapporteur
,
deputy
Arthur
Morgan
,
and
Chairman
,
deputy
Willie
Penrose
,
examine
what
be
require
to
expand
employment
in
the
agrifood
sector
.
it
take
a
deep
view
of
what
need
to
be
do
and
one
of
the
area
it
examine
be
the
role
of
co-operative
.
I
refer
to
the
ICOS
model
and
to
its
meeting
this
week
to
discuss
how
to
improve
the
co-operative
movement
and
the
need
for
great
consolidation
.
one
of
the
aspiration
in
the
Morgan
report
be
to
ensure
a
important
role
for
co-operative
.
it
state
:
the
government
need
to
support
the
co-operative
enterprise
from
start
-
up
to
employee
buy
-
out
in
the
agri
food
sector
.
co-operative
have
a
long
tradition
in
the
agri
food
sector
in
Ireland
where
some
business
,
which
start
out
as
local
co-op
have
go
on
to
be
multi-national
and
market
leader
such
as
in
the
area
of
dairy
product
.
the
co-operative
Movement
have
play
a
central
role
in
the
economic
development
of
rural
Ireland
.
co-operative
enterprise
create
many
benefit
for
business
,
employee
and
community
.
that
aspiration
should
be
incorporate
into
the
strategy
.
the
development
of
a
new
generation
of
co-operative
,
particularly
for
organic
foodstuff
,
must
play
a
role
in
create
new
job
in
the
agrifood
sector
.
establish
a
co-operative
may
be
the
most
viable
option
for
start
a
new
business
and
government
policy
need
to
reflect
this
.
the
Labour
Party
will
stand
over
that
aspiration
and
we
believe
that
it
need
to
be
incorporate
into
a
government
policy
where
one
go
back
to
first
principle
.
there
be
a
need
for
great
consolidation
within
the
co-operative
movement
in
the
dairy
sector
where
scaling
upwards
will
achieve
a
great
export
market
without
lose
core
principle
and
deepening
relationship
with
the
local
market
.
there
be
massive
scope
in
this
area
but
there
be
also
a
role
,
for
instance
,
for
enterprise
development
agency
to
assist
in
the
process
of
add
value
to
the
industry
.
the
Morgan
report
outline
how
access
to
expertise
and
capital
for
venture
and
project
,
which
provide
economic
benefit
but
which
may
not
happen
if
leave
to
market
force
alone
,
can
be
increase
.
in
other
word
,
state
involvement
be
vital
in
this
process
.
improve
skill
set
be
one
of
the
aspiration
in
the
growth
and
competitiveness
chapter
of
the
food
harvest
2020
document
.
it
acknowledge
the
role
of
Teagasc
,
the
Marine
Institute
and
university
and
other
third
level
institution
and
state
they
have
a
crucial
role
in
create
and
disseminate
new
knowledge
.
if
one
own
a
exist
business
and
if
one
wish
to
retrain
,
there
be
programme
which
be
tailor
to
one
's
need
.
for
instance
,
a
programme
in
ucc
be
aim
at
people
work
within
the
Artisan
food
sector
and
it
be
design
to
try
to
encourage
they
to
add
value
to
they
product
and
to
learn
new
business
skill
.
however
,
there
be
a
cost
component
to
do
the
course
and
,
very
often
,
people
work
within
that
sector
be
operate
on
tight
margin
and
find
it
difficult
to
get
funding
for
course
such
as
this
.
if
we
want
to
concentrate
on
education
and
to
try
to
upskill
people
or
get
a

a

on

when
be
the

date
for

its

be
to
make

on

of

of
a

.
in

word
—
—
—
—

commit
to

—
——
in

of
the
fact
that
we
have
enact
the
legislation
in
this
House
.
we
be
already
hear
report
about
Cork
Prison
and
other
prison
be
overcrowded
.
they
be
partly
overcrowded
because
of
such
situation
.
when
will
we
see
the
commencement
of
that
legislation
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
be
I
give
to
understand
then
that
the
negotiation
on
the
appointment
of
the
receiver
have
conclude
and
that
the
Taoiseach
be
satisfied
that
the
act
will
commence
on
1
January
?
I
expect
deputy
Durkan
know
it
off
by
heart
.
I
should
like
to
share
time
with
deputy
Arthur
Morgan
,
with
the
permission
of
the
House
.
I
,
too
,
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
welcome
this
legislation
.
as
with
any
consolidation
Bill
,
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
simplify
procedure
and
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
it
will
potentially
reduce
the
compliance
burden
on
small
and
family
business
and
family
farm
,
and
this
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
remark
on
the
January
1982
budget
.
my
late
father
play
no
small
part
in
that
particular
decision
as
regards
vat
on
child
's
shoe
,
so
that
be
a
decision
which
have
work
its
way
into
the
annal
of
we
family
,
and
we
be
proud
of
it
.
there
be
not
much
to
be
say
,
apart
from
acknowledge
it
as
be
a
fine
body
of
work
.
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act
1997
,
instigate
by
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
have
a
similar
type
of
effect
.
however
,
the
1997
Act
have
be
amend
in
every
Finance
Bill
since
,
and
arguably
have
lead
to
a
unwieldy
tax
system
.
one
hope
that
this
legislation
will
remain
as
codify
and
in
that
sense
,
retain
its
purity
.
there
be
not
much
more
to
be
say
.
we
have
some
amendment
in
respect
of
certain
part
of
the
Bill
,
but
nothing
substantive
.
we
shall
deal
with
that
on
committee
stage
.
we
congratulate
the
minister
,
official
of
the
Department
and
everyone
who
have
a
part
in

the
legislation
.
it
be
no
easy
task
and
they
be
to
be
commend
.

what
about
deputy
Gogarty
's
comment
?
the
government
should
have
do
that
anyway
.
God
forbid
.
I
be
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
although
the
motion
speak
specifically
to
the
incompetence
of
the
government
,
with
particular
regard
to
the
banking
crisis
,
it
be
important
to
speak
about
the
lack
of
regulation
of
the
money
lending
and
debt
advisory
sector
.
in
the
current
regulatory
environment
there
be
a
coterie
of
so
-
call
debt
adviser
who
charge
rate
commensurate
with
the
usurer
of
Shakespeare
's
"
the
Merchant
of
Venice
"
.
this
be
a
outrage
and
a
further
indicator
of
the
indifference
this
government
show
towards
ordinary
working
people
.
this
be
evidence
in
its
recent
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
pose
on
license
moneylender
.
it
may
be
say
I
be
stray
slightly
from
the
gut
of
the
motion
but
in
speak
on
this
sector
my
party
believe
there
must
be
a
level
of
equity
in
the
way
a
government
and
a
regulatory
regime
examine
financial
service
.
if
one
talk
about
give
power
to
the
Garda
and
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
,
one
must
also
examine
how
that
power
be
divide
up
and
to
which
sector
they
should
apply
.
the
motion
speak
of
this
power
apply
specifically
to
the
banking
sector
but
my
party
believe
it
be
essential
that
we
consider
the
wide
financial
service
sector
.
on
27
October
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Finance
whether
he
attention
have
be
draw
to
the
fact
that
the
country
's
large
license
home
collection
moneylender
have
acquire
a
additional
13000
customer
in
the
past
year
and
what
he
plan
be
to
introduce
a
system
of
regulation
for
debt
collection
agency
.
the
minister
respond
:
in
my
role
as
Minister
for
Finance
I
have
responsibility
for
the
development
of
the
legal
framework
govern
the
regulation
of
financial
institution
in
Ireland
.
the
day
to
day
responsibility
for
the
supervision
of
this
financial
institution
be
a
matter
for
the
Central
Bank
,
which
be
independent
in
the
exercise
of
its
regulatory
function
.
the
Central
Bank
issue
licence
to
money
lender
on
a
yearly
basis
.
the
Central
Bank
have
produce
a
consumer
protection
code
for
license
money
lender
and
under
this
code
money
lender
be
require
to
prominently
indicate
the
high
-
cost
nature
of
the
loan
on
all
loan
documentation
where
the
APR
be
23
%
or
high
.
the
disclosure
must
take
the
follow
form
,
there
must
be
a
warning
that
this
be
a
high
-
cost
loan
and
money
lender
must
also
provide
consumer
who
demonstrate
difficulty
in
meet
they
repayment
with
information
on
debt
counselling
service
such
as
the
money
advice
and
budgeting
service
which
provide
free
independent
advice
and
guidance
.
the
reply
continue
:
other
provision
of
the
code
cover
a
range
of
area
include
unsolicited
contact
and
unsolicited
credit
facility
,
handle
complaint
,
arrears
and
guarantee
and
debt
collection
.
.
.
the
deputy
may
wish
to
note
that
in
the
case
of
financial
institution
which
use
debt
collection
firm
the
Central
Bank
have
impose
requirement
under
its
consumer
protection
code
that
offer
protection
to
consumer
.
this
code
oblige
the
regulate
financial
institution
that
it
cover
to
ensure
that
any
outsource
collection
activity
comply
with
the
requirement
of
the
code
.
this
mean
that
outsource
activity
should
uphold
principle
in
the
code
such
as
the
requirement
for
institution
to
not
exert
undue
pressure
or
undue
influence
on
the
customer
,
act
honestly
,
fairly
and
professionally
and
with
due
skill
and
diligence
in
the
good
interest
of
its
consumer
and
prohibit
personal
visit
to
or
oral
communication
with
consumer
except
in
specify
circumstance
.
the
deputy
may
also
wish
to
note
that
the
National
consumer
Agency
provide
extensive
information
on
its
website
and
through
its
helpline
to
help
consumer
avoid
get
into
debt
difficulty
.
the
agency
also
provide
information
for
that
at
risk
of
not
be
able
to
meet
loan
repayment
.
I
know
of
nobody
who
have
borrow
money
who
have
be
offer
such
information
or
be
even
aware
of
they
rights
and
entitlement
.
this
be
people
who
traditionally
come
from
work
-
class
area
,
have
fall
on
tougher
time
and
be
borrowing
from
the
moneylender
.
there
must
be
a
role
for
the
regulator
in
regard
to
this
sector
because
not
only
be
it
under
-
regulate
but
it
deal
with
the
most
vulnerable
people
in
we
society
at
this
time
.
my
party
see
a
glaring
discrepancy
in
the
way
this
sector
be
be
treat
where
we
see
a
light
touch
approach
apply
.
the
minister
's
response
to
my
parliamentary
question
reflect
a
mish
-
mash
type
of
response
that
do
not
deal
directly
with
the
problem
of
moneylender
and
how
insidious
they
have
become
.
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
the
regulatory
regime
have
borne
down
very
heavily
on
the
credit
union
sector
,
unnecessarily
so
,
some
would
argue
.
in
essence
,
we
support
the
motion
but
if
we
be
to
use
opportunity
such
as
this
to
take
a
look
at
the
regulatory
regime
we
contend
the
government
must
also
examine
other
aspect
of
financial
service
.
it
must
examine
the
moneylending
sector
and
ask
whether
it
place
too
heavy
a
hand
on
the
credit
union
sector
.
if
one
take
the
credit
union
sector
as
a
example
,
it
be
one
that
have
never
need
a
bail
out
.
this
House
have
never
debate
whether
the
credit
union
sector
be
go
into
crisis
because
we
know
full
well
it
be
not
,
even
though
there
may
be
a
small
handful
of
credit
union
which
have
encounter
serious
difficulty
.
the
regulatory
response
from
government
,
however
,
have
be
to
bear
down
heavily
on
the
credit
union
sector
—
unnecessarily
,
we
contend
—
but
not
to
do
anything
in
regard
to
regulation
of
the
moneylending
sector
which
adversely
affect
that
people
who
be
most
vulnerable
and
therefore
need
to
be
regulate
.
we
can
have
no
faith
that
this
government
will
introduce
adequate
measure
for
the
Garda
or
the
director
of
corporate
Enforcement
when
we
see
clearly
from
the
reply
to
my
parliamentary
question
that
the
government
be
fail
to
legislate
adequately
for
the
moneylending
sector
while
go
hell
for
leather
to
regulate
the
credit
union
sector
.
moneylending
be
a
hidden
sector
,
one
that
need
to
be
examine
and
that
should
be
subject
to
Garda
monitoring
.
I
believe
it
be
on
12
February
last
year
that
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
deputy
John
Gormley
,
state
in
a
debate
on
the
recapitalisation
of
AIB
and
Bank
of
Ireland
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
change
in
the
regime
such
that
people
would
have
to
do
"
the
perp
walk
"
,
to
cite
the
expression
he
use
.
nobody
yet
have
do
the
perp
walk
and
we
question
why
there
have
not
be
progress
since
12
February
2009
in
that
regard
.
there
be
no
body
,
committee
or

of
Defence

within

legislation
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
,
but
I
ask
he
to
forgive
I
if
I
miss
something
in
he
reply
.
will
the
government
achieve
a
target
of
10000
ha
.
this
year
:
yes
or
no
?
I
wish
to
consider
the
matter
from
two
perspective
.
would
the
minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
ensure
the
target
be
meet
would
potentially
capture
in
the
private
forestry
sector
up
to
160000
tonne
of
co2
?
accord
to
the
private
forestry
sector
,
if
the
State
be
to
purchase
carbon
credit
for
that
amount
,
it
would
cost
approximately
€
46
million
.
while
the
10000
hectare
be
a
aspirational
figure
,
would
the
minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
we
should
move
beyond
aspiration
at
this
stage
?
there
be
a
clear
need
in
a
very
productive
sector
to
ensure
that
the
investment
will
yield
a
multiplier
of
the
benefit
in
the
long
term
.
the
minister
mention
that
the
average
payment
per
person
will
be
€
4000
per
annum
,
which
be
below
the
€
5000
maximum
.
to
what
do
he
attribute
this
figure
?
what
be
the
up
to
date
position
regard
that
who
be
leave
reps
3
?
will
they
be
accommodate
under
the
AEOS
next
year
?
speak
of
the
estimate
,
be
the
minister
confident
he
can
secure
the
€
50
million
next
year
,
or
more
,
depend
on
the
demand
for
the
scheme
?
we
have
all
be
lobby
by
the
IFA
this
week
and
this
be
one
of
the
issue
that
have
arise
.
if
we
take
the
deputy
's
point
about
the
food
harvest
2020
report
,
would
the
minister
acknowledge
that
one
criticism
of
the
document
,
which
we
support
,
be
that
if
we
be
to
achieve
that
target
,
particularly
in
the
dairy
sector
,
there
must
be
a
major
restructuring
in
the
use
of
land
and
stock
?
to
incentivise
new
blood
into
the
sector
,
the
relief
must
be
continue
and
extend
.
do
the
minister
agree
with
that
point
?
all
party
welcome
the
food
harvest
2020
report
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
the
implementation
body
's
membership
be
not
wide
enough
?
will
he
agree
he
should
have
include
representative
from
this
side
of
the
House
as
we
represent
a
significant
proportion
of
the
population
?
will
the
minister
guarantee
the
€
641
million
allocate
to
the
agrifood
research
and
development
programme
will
be
maintain
to
achieve
this
policy
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
commitment
to
flexibility
in
the
implementation
process
.
however
,
the
Labour
Party
believe
it
need
to
be
widen
.
will
the
minister
consider
engage
with
party
on
this
side
of
the
House
to
achieve
this
?
I
fail
to
see
how
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
have
a
bear
on
this
question
.
will
the
minister
provide
some
direction
as
to
when
a
statutory
code
of
conduct
will
be
put
in
place
?
when
will
this
happen
?
we
seek
a
specific
time
and
date
.
will
the
minister
not
acknowledge
there
be
a
certain
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
Minister
of
State
sit
beside
he
,
deputy
Cuffe
,
have
refer
to
Terra
Madre
and
the
slow
food
movement
,
which
comprise
small
organic
producer
who
seek
to
find
a
export
market
?
meanwhile
,
in
this
country
,
the
government
be
capitulate
to
the
Tescos
and
Asdas
of
this
world
which
seek
to
gain
a
foothold
here
.
will
the
minister
confirm
that
he
will
do
everything
in
he
power
to
ensure
that
the
retail
planning
guideline
will
not
be
move
or
shif
in
any
way
to
facilitate
the
"
Tescoification
"
of
the
Irish
grocery
sector
and
to
ensure
that
we
can
protect
the
primary
producer
to
whom
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Cuffe
,
refer
such
that
we
retain
a
good
mix
and
not
do
not
sell
ourselves
out
to
the
large
multiple
?
with
all
due
respect
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
—
—
the
government
should
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
be
.
the
minister
be
well
aware
that
it
be
knock
on
the
door
.
if
he
be
not
aware
of
this
,
he
should
be
.
I
raise
this
matter
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
€300
million
be
spend
annually
in
Cork
on
prefabricate
building
in
the
primary
school
sector
.
today
,
we
learn
through
RTE
that
€330
million
of
the
budget
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
have
not
yet
be
spend
.
I
use
the
particular
example
of
Midleton
because
three
primary
school
be
house
in
inadequate
condition
.
I
put
the
question
to
the
minister
about
the
educational
need
of
Midleton
in
the
future
and
the
answer
state
:
"
school
accommodation
requirement
in
the
Midleton
/
Carrigtwohill
area
have
be
consider
as
part
of
this
detailed
study
of
the
identify
area
,
which
indicate
that
up
38
additional
primary
classroom
may
be
require
across
that
area
to
cater
for
increase
enrolment
up
to
the
school
year
2014
/
15
.
"
there
be
three
school
in
the
area
—
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
,
a
Educate
together
school
and
a
gaelscoil
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
's
response
will
point
out
the
Department
have
apply
for
planning
permission
at
Ballinacurra
,
a
site
that
would
be
woefully
inadequate
for
meet
the
long
-
term
need
of
primary
school
in
Midleton
.
the
Educate
together
school
be
house
in
the
local
rugby
club
at
a
cost
of
€
45,000
per
year
.
the
gaelscoil
be
spend
approximately
€
81000
on
rental
cost
and
be
be
house
in
the
local
community
centre
.
I
do
not
have
the
figure
for
the
third
school
.
if
we
take
a
lateral
approach
about
how
to
provide
this
,
we
can
make
savings
in
the
long
run
.
we
want
the
Department
to
come
down
and
make
a
proper
study
and
assessment
of
the
educational
requirement
in
the
Midleton
area
so
that
it
can
adhere
to
the
aim
to
meet
the
need
for
38
additional
primary
school
classroom
and
adhere
to
the
various
etho
that
exist
.
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
be
largely
a
Church
of
Ireland
denomination
school
.
along
with
the
Educate
together
school
and
the
gaelscoil
,
it
could
be
house
on
one
campus
,
but
the
Ballinacurra
site
be
woefully
inadequate
.
something
must
be
do
.
in
the
case
of
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
,
the
school
authority
have
a
imaginative
plan
and
have
seek
a
loan
from
the
Department
in
order
to
carry
out
the
work
.
it
have
prove
it
can
do
this
work
in
the
past
.
if
the
Department
get
out
of
its
centralised
,
structuralised
tendency
to
think
along
the
same
line
,
this
people
could
achieve
they
aim
.
they
seek
a
little
help
from
the
government
in
order
to
do
so
.
similarly
,
the
Educate
together
school
be
house
in
the
local
rugby
club
and
be
offer
a
site
at
the
local
co-op
,
which
it
could
rent
at
a
significantly
low
price
than
the
Department
be
pay
at
present
.
why
do
we
not
think
laterally
about
how
we
can
help
they
?
Midleton
be
a
barometer
for
many
town
beyond
the
Pale
.
I
ask
the
Department
and
the
minister
to
take
on
board
the
submission
make
by
the
school
and
to
recognise
the
deficiency
at
the
Ballinacurra
site
.
I
call
on
someone
to
please
meet
with
this
people
and
think
a
little
more
laterally
about
how
they
be
go
to
deliver
for
educational
need
in
the
primary
sector
in
the
future

already
.
at
this
point
,
member
should
not
only
be
talk
about
head
of
agreement
and
so
on
.
there
be
a
sense
that
because
the
economy
have
take
such
a
downturn
,
a
issue
such
as
climate
change
can
move
to
the
back
burner
.
I
reiterate
a
point
make
by
deputy
Barrett
by
question
the
reason
the
election
of
a
mayor
for
Dublin
be
be
prioritise
through
change
in
legislation
.
why
do
that
measure
take
great
precedence
than
a
issue
such
as
climate
change
in
the
legislative
programme
before
member
?
I
refer
to
today
's
Order
of
Business
in
the
Dáil
and
the
furore
,
partly
start
by
I
I
admit
,
on
the
decision
by
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
to
critique
a
government
decision
on
the
closure
of
the
Irish
sugar
industry
.
while
one
may
ask
the
reason
this
be
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
discussion
,
I
be
town
mayor
of
Mallow
at
the
time
when
the
sugar
factory
there
close
and
one
issue
I
seek
to
put
on
the
political
agenda
be
a
examination
of
the
potential
for
ethanol
production
.
it
be
consider
that
if
Ireland
be
move
out
of
sugar
production
and
if
the
African
,
caribbean
and
Pacific
country
be
go
to
be
give
a
great
slice
of
the
market
under
the
everything
but
Arm
initiative
,
then
this
be
a
WTO
decision
to
which
one
would
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
be
oblige
to
buy
in
to
.
at
that
time
,
I
be
strongly
of
the
opinion
,
base
on
sound
advice
,
that
there
be
potential
at
least
for
a
survival
mechanism
for
the
plant
for
two
year
.
thereafter
,
once
the
market
have
open
up
,
it
would
be
a
case
of
sink
or
swim
depend
on
how
the
global
market
go
.
it
be
now
evident
that
the
global
market
for
sugar
have
increase
but
in
the
absence
of
the
continuation
of
sugar
production
at
the
Mallow
plant
there
could
have
be
a
move
towards
a
ethanol
production
facility
.
timing
be
everything
because
this
year
,
the
House
have
transpose
the
bio-fuel
obligation
legislation
,
which
seek
to
ensure
that
each
tank
of
petrol
have
ethanol
or
alternative
fuel
source
as
part
of
its
constituent
composition
.
the
Labour
Party
strongly
believe
that
stimulation
of
a
ethanol
production
market
within
Ireland
be
possible
but
to
be
able
to
so
do
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
in
place
a
set
of
tariff
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
reject
this
position
.
I
be
not
try
to
score
political
point
because
if
I
understand
he
position
correctly
,
he
wish
to
go
back
to
ascertain
what
would
be
the
commission
position
on
such
a
proposal
.
member
opposite
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
in
that
assessment
.
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
precedent
in
respect
of
ethanol
importation
as
I
understand
that
other
country
be
place
a
tariff
on
importation
to
stimulate
local
production
within
they
country
.
I
represent
the
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
within
which
be
locate
the
Whitegate
refinery
.
I
be
reliably
inform
that
for
a
number
of
year
,
the
big
oil
company
operate
at
Whitegate
have
be
store
up
undenatured
ethanol
that
more
than
likely
have
be
import
from
third
country
such
as
Brazil
.
while
it
be
probably
derive
from
former
forestry
site
,
Ireland
have
not
even
start
localise
production
.
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
I
refer
to
the
attempt
to
wean
ourselves
off
petrol
and
to
substitute
it
with
alternative
energy
source
.
one
do
not
do
this
by
allow
big
oil
company
to
control
the
political
agenda
,
thereby
enable
they
to
meet
they
obligation
under
the
bio
-
fuel
obligation
scheme
by
import
from
location
such
as
South
America
because
that
do
not
make
any
sense
.
at
that
time
,
when
member
be
do
battle
on
this
Bill
,
I
would
have
think
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
would
have
be
ahead
of
the
curve
.
I
would
have
expect
he
to
play
,
dare
I
say
it
,
the
green
jersey
card
by
assert
that
Ireland
would
stimulate
local
demand
.
this
come
back
full
circle
to
my
point
about
Irish
sugar
and
how
,
at
a
time
when
Ireland
be
import
substitute
ethanol
to
put
in
its
car
,
it
could
have
a
ethanol
industry
that
could
provide
the
same
service
.
this
be
where
political
thinking
in
Ireland
have
become
so
disjointed
.
we
must
begin
to
think
more
laterally
about
how
to
achieve
we
aim
.
we
must
start
by
ascertain
where
we
want
to
go
and
what
be
we
target
.
thereafter
,
we
should
look
towards
achieve
that
target
without
fear
of
be
perceive
to
be
too
nationalistic
.
I
do
not
use
the
word
"
nationalistic
"
in
the
narrow
sense
by
which
most
people
define
it
.
I
mean
have
some
pride
in
we
ability
to
produce
such
ethanol
ourselves
to
be
able
to
stimulate
local
production
.
this
could
then
offset
many
of
the
challenge
Ireland
face
vis-à
-
vo
the
production
of
carbon
result
from
the
importation
of
substitute
.
on
the
issue
of
forestry
,
the
state
government
target
in
the
revise
programme
for
government
be
to
achieve
10000
hectare
per
annum
.
at
present
,
I
understand
that
approximately
7000
hectare
be
be
achieve
,
therefore
,
Ireland
still
be
off
-
target
.
forestry
be
a
productive
indigenous
sector
that
have
a
multiplier
into
the
local
economy
.
there
be
a
justification
,
even
in
this
constrain
economic
time
,
for
continue
the
subsidisation
of
that
sector
.
if
,
for
instance
,
a
government
can
justify
the
subsidisation
of
foreign
direct
investment
type
job
,
whereby
a
grant
or
subsidy
be
give
to
a
company
for
each
job
create
,
the
same
logic
can
apply
where
we
seek
to
upscale
indigenous
sector
.
if
we
be
to
target
climate
change
,
forestry
will
become
a
fulcrum
in
term
of
achieve
target
.
with
the
impending
budget
,
I
ask
the
government
to
take
a
look
at
this
again
.
fund
this
sector
will
create
a
economic
multiplier
that
will
assist
local
economy
.
I
ask
the
government
to
bear
that
in
mind
.
I
express
solidarity
with
the
worker
and
grower
in
north
Cork
,
the
area
with
which
I
be
most
familiar
,
who
fight
tooth
and
nail
and
through
thick
and
thin
to
try
to
keep
the
sugar
factory
in
Mallow
operational
.
they
be
give
a
clear
indication
that
the
factory
have
a
viable
future
if
efficiency
and
change
work
practice
be
introduce
.
have
agree
to
the
change
,
the
workforce
be
sell
out
by
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
.
the
Tánaiste
,
who
be
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
and
food
at
the
time
,
make
the
follow
statement
to
the
House
this
morning
:
second
,
as
then
Minister
for
Agriculture
and
food
,
I
oppose
the
commission
's
proposal
,
as
the
Member
will
be
aware
and
lead
the
group
of
14
in
its
opposition
to
that
reform
.
I
lead
that
opposition
with
a
number
of
other
colleague
in
the
European
Union
.
there
be
a
disparity
between
this
statement
and
the
minute
of
the
meeting
of
the
Council
of
Minister
of
20
February
2006
,
which
state
:
the
Council
successfully
adopt
by
qualify
majority
the
three
regulation
on
the
reform
of
the
sugar
sector
as
set
out
in
document
5588/06
,
5589/06
,
5590/06
.
the
Greek
,
Polish
,
and
Latvian
delegation
vote
against
.
if
the
Greek
,
Polish
and
Latvian
delegation
vote
against
the
so
-
call
reform
,
only
the
Tánaiste
,
who
be
a
party
to
the
discussion
in
the
Council
of
Minister
and
claim
she
oppose
the
proposal
,
be
in
a
position
to
describe
what
occur
at
the
meeting
.
why
be
she
not
present
to
clarify
the
matter
?
she
owe
a
explanation
to
the
grower
of
north
Cork
and
elsewhere
in
the
country
as
well
as
the
worker
who
lose
they
job
as
a
result
of
the
decision
take
by
the
Council
of
Minister
.
I
remind
the
minister
that
some
of
the
same
worker
have
to
wait
for
more
than
12
month
for
redundancy
payment
.
I
be
a
councillor
at
the
time
and
have
to
seek
supplementary
welfare
payment
on
the
behalf
of
worker
at
the
Mallow
plant
,
pend
the
outcome
of
negotiation
with
Greencore
,
a
company
that
have
receive
million
of
euro
from
the
compensation
fund
.
that
story
be
never
tell
because
we
be
in
the
midst
of
the
Celtic
tiger
and
the
government
side
do
not
want
to
hear
it
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
former
minister
shif
she
position
from
one
in
which
she
be
in
a
block
minority
with
other
country
to
one
in
which
she
accept
the
compensation
package
.
she
owe
it
to
people
in
north
Cork
,
all
that
who
grow
beet
and
everyone
else
who
be
affect
by
the
decision
to
explain
the
reason
she
shif
she
position
.
that
be
the
least
the
House
deserve
in
term
of
the
history
of
this
episode
.
in
2005
,
I
state
that
if
Ireland
be
to
stop
produce
sugar
,
the
perfect
place
to
start
produce
ethanol
be
either
Carlow
or
Mallow
.
ethanol
be
now
be
import
into
Whitegate
.
the
Labour
Party
tab
a
amendment
on
the
biofuel
Bill
provide
for
the
imposition
of
a
tariff
on
ethanol
import
to
stimulate
local
production
.
despite
the
presence
of
the
Green
Party
in
government
,
this
measure
have
not
be
take
.
if
we
be
not
to
produce
sugar
again
,
we
should
at
least
produce
ethanol
locally
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
biofuel
obligation
.
the
government
must
explain
the
position
it
take
on
this
matter
.
regard
the
night
of
20
February
2006
,
I
understand
the
difficulty
for
the
current
minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
need
to
account
for
a
decision
take
in
2006
at
a
meeting
at
which
he
be
not
present
.
therefore
,
he
be
reliant
on
the
official
.
ideally
,
the
then
minister
should
be
in
the
Chamber
so
that
we
could
have
a
full
and
frank
account
of
what
occur
at
the
meeting
.
why
do
the
government
shift
its
position
?
while
we
be
consider
the
matter
from
the
perspective
of
Mallow
and
the
protection
of
job
and
a
viable
national
industry
,
there
be
grounds
for
hope
because
of
the
block
minority
.
the
Tánaiste
state
it
be
a
group
of
14
member
state
.
I
understand
that
,
under
the
old
regime
,
a
block
minority
consist
of
nine
member
state
.
why
do
the
government
shift
its
position
from
a
block
minority
of
nine
to
accede
to
the
cessation
of
trading
as
a
industry
?
something
must
have
happen
.
perhaps
a
vested
interest
interven
because
it
want
to
take
the
compensation
.
this
could
have
be
a
minority
group
of
large
grower
,
the
government
or
even
Greencore
,
which
might
have
decide
that
it
be
go
to
get
out
of
the
industry
and
apply
political
pressure
on
the
government
to
that
effect
.
the
question
of
the
golden
share
and
related
responsibility
come
into
play
in
this
respect
.
I
understand
that
the
1990
legislation
make
provision
for
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
to
acquire
a
special
share
in
the
hold
company
and
to
exercise
the
rights
attach
to
that
share
.
however
,
the
minister
state
that
he
have
no
rights
in
the
context
of
the
share
.
forgive
I
,
as
I
be
not
a
lawyer
or
a
solicitor
,
but
if
the
minister
be
tell
the
House
that
we
have
a
golden
share
with
no
rights
attach
to
it
in
term
of
the
performance
of
the
company
,
why
do
we
have
a
golden
share
in
the
first
instance
?
what
be
its
purpose
if
we
could
not
influence
internal
Greencore
decision
on
the
compensation
package
and
the
industry
's
future
in
Ireland
?
I
will
tell
the
House
the
reason
.
the
government
do
not
care
about
the
future
of
the
industry
.
vest
interest
have
sufficient
influence
in
government
circle
to
tell
it
to
adopt
the
new
negotiating
position
of
take
the
money
and
run
.
if
we
have
the
support
of
the
other
member
state
,
we
could
have
retain
a
block
minority
.
if
the
contrary
be
the
case
,
then
the
minister
should
tell
we
.
I
refer
to
the
stand
-
alone
paragraph
which
state
that
we
have
a
proficient
factory
—
this
be
obviously
a
reference
to
the
Mallow
factory
in
point
30
as
the
minister
have
state
.
have
the
minister
be
in
contact
with
the
commission
regard
that
specific
point
of
the
report
?
what
have
be
the
commission
's
response
to
the
minister
on
that
matter
and
on
the
report
in
general
?
deputy
Jack
Wall
have
already
state
that
the
decision
have
not
be
justify
on
the
risk
of
low
price
reduce
the
supply
of
sugar
beet
to
a
uneconomic
level
.
we
do
not
really
know
what
the
true
market
would
be
,
post
-
restructuring
.
my
information
in
2005
be
that
Greencore
be
go
to
proceed
with
production
and
move
into
a
post
-
quota
scenario
and
then
see
how
the
market
would
pan
out
.
this
be
the
impression
give
to
I
by
senior
people
within
Greencore
at
the
time
.
in
other
word
,
even
if
the
quota
regime
be
not
in
place
,
the
industry
might
survive
for
a
year
or
two
in
a
new
market
scenario
.
if
after
that
time
the
industry
do
not
survive
,
there
might
be
a
possibility
it
could
diversify
into
ethanol
and
other
such
product
.
I
ask
for
the
minister
's
view
at
this
stage
.
will
I
be
allow
make
another
contribution
late
?
so
the
government
stitch
up
the
legislation
very
well
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
scattergun
approach
.
the
everything
but
Arm
Initiative
be
something
of
a
fallacy
in
term
of
a
justification
for
the
government
's
position
on
the
loss
of
a
industry
which
go
back
to
the
foundation
of
the
State
.
the
minister
,
in
he
justification
,
weaken
he
own
argument
because
the
everything
but
Arm
Initiative
and
the
ACP
country
have
not
find
the
foothold
in
the
European
market
that
they
be
suppose
to
get
as
a
result
of
the
restructuring
of
the
sugar
industry
.
the
bottom
line
here
be
that
what
be
a
sustainable
industry
have
be
sell
down
the
river
but
it
be
let
go
too
easily
.
that
be
factually
incorrect
.
by
the
end
of
year
two
of
a
three
year
process
,
the
voluntary
approach
be
not
work
and
it
be
come
in
under
quota
.
it
be
far
below
the
commission
's
target
in
fact
.
you
be
a
gas
.
you
will
try
any
trick
in
the
book
.

who

will
the

clarify
he
reply
?
do
I
interpret
he
correctly
when
he
say
there
be
no
impediment
to
the
process

it
would
be
subject
to
a
EU
commission
proposal

be
there
a
clause
in

that
result
in
the
closure
of
the
industry
,
which
say
that
no
sugar
beet
should
be
produce
in

up
to
2017
?
that
need
to
be
clarify
by
he
.
have
he
regret
?
do
he
now
feel
government
policy
at
the
time
be
short
-
sight
in
that
even
if
we
be
not
produce
sugar
,
we
could
have
use
the
sugar
beet
crop
to
produce
ethanol
to
fulfil
we
obligation
under
the
bio-fuel
scheme
and
we
would
not
have
to
import
undenatured
ethanol
from
third
country
such
as
Brazil
because
we
could
blend
it
into
stock
at
Whitegate
and
produce
a
indigenous
crop
?
that
reply
be
extremely
disappointing
but
I
do
not
want
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
in
so
far
as
Greencore
,
as
the
commercial
entity
responsible
for
process
sugar
,
state
it
would
renounce
its
quota
but
there
be
a
disconnect
between
that
and
the
political
decision
take
at
Council
of
Minister
level
,
to
which
Fianna
Fáil
be
a
party
,
to
accept
the
restructuring
package
as
it
pertain
to
Ireland
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
post
-2015
we
could
grow
sugar
beet
again
in
Ireland
,
if
not
to
supply
the
confectionery
market
,
to
ensure
we
can
meet
we
obligation
under
the
bio-fuel
scheme
?
the
minister
have
not
answer
my
question
about
the
potential
of
the
sugar
beet
crop
in
the
production
of
ethanol
.
the
minister
be
kick
to
touch
again
.
this
be
the
only
forum
I
have
to
have
my
question
answer
.
I
want
the
minister
to
give
a
opinion
on
whether
we
can
produce
ethanol
on
a
indigenous
basis
.
he
be
kick
to
touch
again
.
that
sum
up
this
government
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
it
be
one
of
that
issue
where
we
need
a
broad
political
consensus
for
the
final
outcome
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
minister
be
begin
to
tie
down
the
three
option
and
be
be
specific
about
the
second
option
.
I
also
welcome
he
statement
on
payment
and
upper
ceiling
for
large
farm
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
minister
be
say
about
potential
capping
and
the
need
for
further
detail
on
that
.
if
Ireland
be
to
go
for
the
second
option
—
I
realise
that
it
be
early
day
in
negotiation
—
and
there
be
a
basic
rate
envisage
in
that
for
income
support
,
how
do
the
minister
envisage
that
this
will
work
out
in
real
term
?
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
response
with
regard
to
capping
and
to
the
Unite
Kingdom
's
position
.
it
be
clear
the
British
would
be
against
a
cap
for
reason
arise
from
they
monarchy
,
the
Queen
's
progeny
and
the
amount
of
land
they
own
.
consequently
,
this
would
stand
to
reason
.
however
,
I
refer
to
the
flexibility
arrangement
about
which
the
minister
have
speak
.
do
he
refer
to
flexibility
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
a
envelope
for
Ireland
regard
the
greening
aspect
,
whereby
Ireland
would
have
a
degree
of
flexibility
as
to
how
it
could
spend
such
fund
?
alternatively
,
do
he
refer
to
a
degree
of
flexibility
for
Ireland
with
regard
to
the
overall
envelope
?
the
minister
should
clear
this
up
.
that
be
reassuring
.
have
the
minister
read
the
article
by
Darragh
McCullough
and
Caitríona
Murphy
in
this
week
's
farming
section
of
the
Irish
Independent
?
the
article
in
question
refer
to
a
''
€35.7
m
cut
in
the
Department
of
Agriculture
's
budget
for
REPS
and
the
Agri
Environmental
option
Scheme
(
AEOS
)
next
year
''
.
I
apologise
.
I
can
paraphrase
the
document
.
the
article
,
which
suggest
that
the
remain
€
294
million
in
the
Department
's
budget
will
cover
just
9000
farmer
,
get
to
the
nub
of
the
issue
.
the
farmer
in
question
need
a
response
from
the
minister
.
I
ask
the
House
to
forgive
my
ignorance
when
I
say
I
do
not
follow
what
the
minister
say
,
to
be
frank
.
can
the
minister
guarantee
the
future
of
the
aeo
scheme
?
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
.
I
accept
that
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
be
among
the
dynamic
in
this
instance
.
he
say
that
"
4
%
of
sheep
meat
import
into
Ireland
last
year
come
from
New
Zealand
"
.
how
do
that
translate
in
term
of
monetary
value
?
I
do
not
know
if
the
Minister
of
State
have
that
figure
.
if
he
do
not
,
I
will
accept
it
and
suggest
they
may
be
forward
to
I
in
the
near
future
.
I
ask
for
clarification
.
from
where
have
the
minister
derive
the
figure
of
the
price
of
26
cent
per
litre
?
be
this
the
amount
that
would
make
it
sustainable
?
be
the
minister
now
say
that
pre-2015
there
be
no
possibility
of
subsidisation
of
beet
grow
for
the
production
of
ethanol
?
be
he
say
there
would
be
no
government
support
for
the
production
of
ethanol
from
sugar
beet
?
tell
that
to
the
Fine
Gael
boy
in
Mallow
.
the
minister
be
now
deliberately
provoke
a
debate
on
the
issue
.
the
minister
have
the
last
word
,
and
then
—
—
the
minister
be
provoke
a
debate
on
this
issue
.
that
be
a
cheap
parting
shot
.
you
could
not
be
up
to
they
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
minister
be
about
to
get
to
it
,
but
one
part
of
the
question
be
about
deficiency
find
by
he
inspector
in
the
past
.
on
the
basis
of
the
target
set
out
for
increase
production
in
that
area
,
what
bear
will
the
food
harvest
2020
proposal
have
on
this
scheme
?
he
be
hale
and
hearty
anyway
.
I
welcome
the
Fine
Gael
motion
,
which
the
Labour
Party
support
.
in
speak
on
the
question
of
political
and
economic
stability
,
we
have
before
we
proposal
by
the
European
Commission
in
relation
to
co-ordination
on
economic
governance
issue
.
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
be
the
very
existence
of
political
and
economic
co-ordination
on
issue
of
a
monetary
nature
.
event
in
recent
month
have
show
clearly
that
there
be
a
existential
crisis
as
regards
the
very
existence
of
the
euro
.
as
a
result
of
the
current
crisis
there
be
some
who
seek
to
impose
on
country
great
economic
and
political
co-ordination
in
return
for
the
continue
existence
of
the
euro
.
in
other
word
,
the
very
threat
we
see
to
the
euro
at
present
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
people
,
be
as
a
result
of
a
lack
of
great
political
co-ordination
.
my
view
be
that
if
the
government
of
the
day
be
to
talk
about
great
political
and
economic
co-ordination
at
a
European
level
,
we
must
be
very
honest
with
the
people
about
that
.
there
be
a
choice
now
in
this
country
as
regards
where
we
go
.
do
we
follow
a
intergovernmental
model
so
that
we
may
ensure
we
sovereignty
,
both
economic
and
political
,
or
do
we
go
for
a
deep
co-ordination
at
European
level
and
follow
a
intra-institutional
model
,
whereby
great
power
be
derive
by
the
European
Commission
?
instinctively
in
this
country
,
because
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
republic
,
there
be
a
view
to
the
effect
that
while
great
economic
co-ordination
be
necessary
and
we
subscribe
to
the
very
existence
of
the
euro
,
this
should
not
be
to
the
further
detriment
of
we
sovereignty
.
we
have
now
give
away
too
much
of
that
sovereignty
along
with
we
ability
to
be
able
to
make
and
break
we
own
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
.
there
have
to
be
a
breakpoint
which
determine
that
this
current
crisis
should
not
present
itself
as
a
opportunity
by
the
European
Commission
as
potential
for
deepening
European
integration
so
that
the
intra-institutional
model
win
out
over
the
intergovernmental
one
.
the
plan
that
have
be
put
before
we
,
on
which
we
will
not
be
even
entitle
to
vote
,
be
a
further
kick
in
the
tooth
to
the
citizen
of
Ireland
,
who
believe
very
strongly
that
they
should
have
the
ability
through
this
House
to
decide
as
to
its
efficacy
.
there
be
now
a
well
-
found
deepening
suspicion
that
this
crisis
have
present
itself
as
a
opportunity
by
the
European
Commission
and
the
intra-instion
to
deepen
they
grip
and
to
bring
about
a
federal
construct
for
the
European
Union
.
I
want
to
lay
down
a
marker
to
the
effect
that
any
new
government
must
think
carefully
as
regards
where
it
want
to
go
and
on
its
policy
in
relation
to
the
European
Union
in
this
respect
.
mine
and
future
generation
have
be
sell
down
the
river
,
and
deem
expendable
in
the
great
ever
swindle
to
which
the
people
of
Ireland
have
be
subject
as
a
result
of
the
economic
policy
of
this
government
.
I
note
the
presence
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
of
member
of
my
generation
,
some
of
whom
become
member
of
the
Dáil
around
the
same
time
as
I
do
.
I
be
speak
of
the
people
of
my
generation
.
while
there
be
no
blame
apportioning
to
that
generation
of
Fianna
Fáil
politician
,
there
be
a
sense
that
they
do
not
appreciate
the
anger
and
sheer
sense
of
betrayal
among
the
public
.
some
of
the
people
of
my
generation
on
the
government
bench
be
as
vigilant
as
they
elder
in
defend
the
party
line
and
the
sin
of
that
who
have
go
before
they
,
politically
.
if
this
country
be
go
to
mean
anything
,
I
believe
we
generation
of
politician
will
have
to
come
clean
with
the
people
and
begin
a
new
political
paradigm
that
ensure
it
will
not
be
about
serve
Fianna
Fáil
or
the
party
first
,
but
rather
the
people
,
so
that
they
be
sovereign
.
it
be
the
people
on
whom
we
will
rely
to
guide
we
in
term
of
how
the
country
should
be
govern
.
it
be
deplorable
that
a
deal
of
this
magnitude
could
be
bring
in
by
a
Fianna
Fáil
government
,
which
through
pure
chicanery
know
it
will
not
have
to
implement
half
of
it
and
that
a
large
part
of
the
deal
will
be
very
difficult
to
unhinge
for
any
incoming
administration
.
that
be
the
trick
of
the
Fianna
Fáil
party
and
that
be
what
it
have
do
for
generation
.
there
will
be
Fianna
Fáil
speaker
of
my
generation
tonight
who
will
defend
the
position
and
the
deal
with
great
gusto
,
know
full
well
that
they
will
be
on
this
side
of
the
House
in
six
month
time
when
we
will
have
to
defend
and
do
we
good
to
renegotiate
a
deal
into
which
the
government
have
manoeuvr
we
.
it
be
chicanery
of
the
high
order
.
that
we
cannot
vote
on
this
deal
make
a

the
very
sovereignty
of

I
wish
to
nail
the
lie
that
the
universal
social
charge
be
a
charge
.
it
be
in
fact
a
tax
and
let
we
call
it
what
it
be
.
Financial
resolution
no.
13
on
which
we
vote
on
Tuesday
state
:
that
,
with
effect
from
1
January
2011
,
there
shall
be
charge
,
levy
and
pay
,
in
accordance
with
the
provision
of
this
resolution
,
a
tax
to
be
know
as
"
universal
social
charge
"
in
respect
of
the
income
specify
in
paragraph
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
of
the
table
to
this
paragraph
.
so
it
be
a
tax
and
that
tax
be
a
time
bomb
that
will
seriously
affect
low
-
income
earner
with
serious
medical
condition
who
have
medical
card
and
be
exempt
from
the
other
levy
.
the
grouping
together
of
the
health
and
income
levy
under
this
universal
social
charge
—
that
be
,
universal
social
tax
—
will
mean
that
such
people
will
now
not
be
exempt
from
this
levy
,
will
be
subject
to
this
tax
and
will
have
they
already
meagre
and
marginal
income
reduce
further
by
the
imposition
of
this
tax
.
it
be
completely
and
utterly
regressive
.
I
find
myself
say
the
same
thing
this
year
as
I
do
in
the
debate
on
last
year
's
budget
;
any
principle
of
taxation
must
be
such
that
it
be
mete
out
fairly
and
in
a
equitable
fashion
.
this
run
contrary
to
the
canon
of
taxation
because
it
will
affect
that
people
on
marginal
income
who
also
have
serious
underlying
medical
condition
in
a
adverse
way
by
virtue
of
its
imposition
.
it
be
completely
unfair
and
should
be
oppose
.
I
stand
proud
that
we
party
will
oppose
the
imposition
of
this
tax
because
it
be
not
what
we
be
about
in
this
republic
and
any
country
with
proper
Republican
ideal
would
not
impose
such
a
tax
in
such
a
way
as
to
affect
that
people
who
be
on
such
marginal
income
.
the
Union
of
student
of
Ireland
provide
a
very
good
critique
of
Tuesday
's
budget
and
highlight
that
the
budget
seek
to
double
the
distance
require
to
qualify
for
the
non-adjacent
rate
of
third
level
grant
from
24
kilometer
to
45
kilometer
for
all
exist
and
new
applicant
from
September
2011
.
the
net
effect
be
that
it
will
exclude
working
-
class
family
from
the
potential
to
gain
a
grant
.
it
will
exclude
people
live
in
rural
area
from
be
able
to
get
a
third
level
grant
and
will
act
as
a
disincentive
for
people
who
want
to
upskill
and
come
back
into
the
educational
sphere
if
they
happen
to
be
live
such
distance
away
from
the
third
level
institution
they
want
to
attend
,
which
be
also
ludicrous
.
if
we
be
seek
to
get
people
back
to
work
,
arbitrary
band
such
as
this
discriminate
against
that
who
will
not
qualify
on
the
basis
of
distance
.
carer
be
protect
vulnerable
people
and
allow
they
to
live
independently
within
the
family
home
but
subject
to
help
from
that
who
be
care
for
they
.
why
have
the
government
create
a
further
disincentive
for
anybody
to
take
up
a
carer
's
allowance
when
the
net
impact
could
be
to
force
more
people
into
nursing
home
?
there
be
a
social
economy
and
we
need
to
take
a
more
lateral
view
by
regard
care
giver
as
people
who
be
make
a
active
contribution
and
who
should
get
a
due
reward
for
that
contribution
to
avoid
force
people
into
nursing
home
because
of
the
disincentive
.
deputy
Ó
Snodaigh
might
relay
that
to
he
colleague
.
we
be
interested
in
the
substantive
issue
.
I
wish
to
speak
about
social
assistance
scheme
and
,
specifically
,
the
farm
assist
payment
.
the
rate
of
payment
have
be
reduce
from
€
196
to
€
188
per
person
.
the
qualified
adult
dependant
allowance
go
from
€
130
down
to
€
124.80
.
I
speak
for
people
on
farm
assist
because
they
be
farming
very
small
holding
and
live
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
remote
rural
setting
.
I
be
talk
about
part
of
south
Kerry
,
Connemara
and
Sligo
and
Donegal
in
the
north
west
.
they
often
farm
marginal
land
.
the
fact
that
they
be
receive
the
farm
assist
payment
be
proof
that
they
income
from
farming
be
meagre
.
this
people
will
now
suffer
from
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
farm
assist
.
they
will
also
be
subject
to
increase
charge
to
get
they
child
to
primary
and
secondary
school
.
this
family
take
the
bus
because
do
not
have
they
own
transport
.
they
will
also
be
subject
to
the
new
universal
social
charge
.
they
farm
income
will
bring
they
into
the
social
charge
band
.
while
they
may
have
be
exempt
from
levy
in
the
past
,
they
be
now
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
.
the
universal
social
charge
be
not
a
charge
.
it
be
a
form
of
taxation
.
this
people
will
suffer
from
the
cut
in
social
welfare
rate
but
also
because
the
government
have
develop
this
inequitable
social
charge
.
we
must
speak
for
this
people
.
it
be
clear
that
Fianna
Fáil
no
long
speak
for
the
marginalised
people
who
live
in
rural
area
.
the
message
send
by
the
budget
to
this
people
be
that
they
may
have
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
all
they
life
but
they
,
and
they
vote
,
will
now
be
take
for
grant
.
however
,
I
can
see
from
the
number
of
call
I
have
receive
from
people
who
be
adversely
affect
by
this
budget
that
they
be
begin
to
change
they
mind
.
no
long
can
one
fool
this
people
with
false
promise
or
take
from
they
in
a
disproportionate
fashion
.
a
millionaire
make
a
net
gain
from
this
budget
while
a
person
make
a
marginal
income
from
a
small
farm
make
a
loss
.
a
family
with
a
child
in
university
will
be
further
catch
by
the
new
adjacency
ruling
for
third
level
grant
qualification
.
why
do
the
government
need
to
make
this
cut
?
there
be
no
level
of
equity
in
they
.
the
person
who
shape
this
budget
cannot
have
think
laterally
about
how
it
would
affect
people
on
the
margin
.
in
spite
of
we
political
difference
,
we
be
always
a
nation
of
people
who
seek
to
look
after
we
most
vulnerable
.
this
universal
social
charge
be
grossly
unfair
.
in
normal
time
,
we
might
have
accept
the
need
to
reduce
payment
for
farm
assist
,
for
example
.
however
,
the
universal
social
charge
add
a
further
financial
penalty
for
that
people
who
be
live
on
the
margin
.
the
same
be
true
of
the
cut
in
carer
's
allowance
and
in
other
rate
.
why
must
we
consistently
attack
this
people
?
there
be
no
logical
explanation
for
it
.
it
be
a
disproportionate
cut
and
be
contrary
to
the
canon
of
taxation
.
one
be
suppose
to
levy
tax
in
a
equitable
fashion
but
that
have
not
be
do
in
this
case
.
I
accept
that
we
be
discuss
the
social
Welfare
Bill
,
but
taxation
be
pertinent
to
the
argument
.
person
who
be
earn
money
and
be
also
in
receipt
of
social
welfare
will
suffer
a
double
whammy
because
they
will
come
into
the
net
of
the
universal
social
charge
as
well
as
suffer
a
reduce
rate
of
social
welfare
.
I
have
a
call
today
from
someone
who
have
a
very
marginal
income
and
be
dependent
on
a
medical
card
,
because
of
a
genuine
underlying
medical
condition
.
the
person
have
a
exemption
from
the
levy
but
will
not
be
exempt
from
the
new
charge
.
I
have
seek
advice
from
colleague
as
to
whether
such
a
person
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
household
have
a
income
,
should
apply
to
the
community
welfare
officer
for
a
home
heating
grant
in
the
come
month
.
we
should
ensure
that
household
with
a
marginal
income
be
not
penalise
further
.
this
people
may
be
in
they
30
and
40s
and
still
make
large
mortgage
repayment
,
which
eat
up
a
large
part
of
they
disposable
income
.
impose
charge
of
this
nature
on
that
people
could
tip
they
over
the
edge
and
force
they
to
rely
on
community
welfare
officer
or
supplementary
welfare
payment
in
order
to
sustain
life
and
limb
.
we
must
think
more
laterally
in
propose
budget
.
we
accept
that
there
have
to
be
cut
across
the
board
.
we
be
buy
into
the
idea
that
there
would
be
adjustment
.
however
,
in
a
proper
society
one
cannot
disproportionately
affect
people
who
be
already
marginalise
.
be
we
not
entitle
to
rise
to
we
foot
?
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Ferris
.
I
will
share
time
equally
with
the
deputy
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
bank
bonus
will
be
tax
at
a
rate
of
90
%
.
I
have
not
be
inform
as
to
the
number
of
employee
who
will
benefit
from
bonus
.
if
,
however
,
90
employee
of
the
bank
which
come
under
the
guarantee
be
to
benefit
from
a
bonus
of
€
40
million
,
each
of
they
would
receive
€
444444
.
if
a
tax
rate
of
90
%
be
apply
to
this
figure
,
they
would
each
receive
a
net
payment
of
approximately
€
44400
.
any
type
of
spin
which
seek
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
pay
this
bonus
will
not
work
because
the
beneficiary
will
still
receive
significant
sum
of
taxpayer
's
money
.
a
underhand
approach
have
be
take
and
the
legislation
need
to
be
revisit
in
this
regard
.
it
be
immoral
that
bonus
should
be
pay
to
fat
cat
when
that
on
the
minimum
wage
be
countenance
a
cut
in
they
income
.
some
6000
signature
of
people
oppose
the
cut
be
gather
in
the
past
24
hour
by
the
Migrants
Centre
of
Ireland
whose
member
campaign
outside
the
gate
of
the
House
today
.
the
payment
of
bonus
to
banker
be
a
affront
when
juxtapose
against
cut
in
the
income
of
people
who
be
barely
survive
on
the
minimum
wage
.
it
be
a
insult
and
certainly
not
how
the
country
should
do
its
business
.
the
introduction
of
the
new
universal
social
charge
will
bring
that
on
the
minimum
wage
into
the
tax
net
.
the
minister
misl
the
House
last
night
when
he
state
that
on
the
minimum
wage
would
not
be
subject
to
taxation
.
the
universal
social
charge
be
a
tax
,
as
explicitly
state
in
Financial
Resolution
no.
13
.
the
minister
state
:
"
in
the
measure
I
be
present
today
,
that
on
the
new
reduce
minimum
wage
will
not
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
.
"
be
he
suggest
that
that
on
the
minimum
wage
will
not
be
subject
to
the
universal
social
charge
?
it
be
as
clear
as
the
nose
on
my
face
that
if
one
earn
more
than
€
4004
,
one
will
be
subject
to
the
charge
at
a
rate
of
2
%
up
to
€
10000
.
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
one
can
claim
back
the
charge
for
the
first
€
4004
.
this
matter
should
be
clarify
.
the
bottom
line
,
however
,
be
that
the
government
be
not
only
reduce
the
minimum
wage
but
remove
the
exemption
enjoy
by
that
on
the
minimum
wage
and
subject
they
to
a
new
tax
.
this
measure
be
woefully
inadequate
and
inequitable
.
if
one
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
everyone
must
share
the
pain
proportionately
,
one
must
accept
that
the
proposal
require
people
on
the
minimum
wage
to
pay
a
disproportionate
amount
.
the
measure
must
be
oppose
.
I
be
proud
to
oppose
any
proposal
that
seek
to
reduce
the
pay
of
that
who

income

the

,
like
all
area
of
the
public

,
will
operate
on
a
reduce

the

reduction

each
of
this

will
operate
with

the
exception
be
the
Naval

the

however

the
specifics
in

acquisition
that
will
be
defer
or
postpone
will
be
the
subject
of
review
with
the
military
authority
in

2011
.
the
steady
investment
since
2000
mean
that
the
Defence

be
well
place
in
address
the
challenge
for
2011
and
the
adjustment
require
under

National

the
priority
in

will
be
on
maintain
the
capability
of

to
deliver
effective
service
across
all
of
the

assign

.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
.
I
propose
to
take
approximately
seven
minute
.
I
refer
in
the
first
instance
to
the
minister
's
speech
on
budget
day
.
he
state
:
"
in
the
measure
I
be
present
today
that
on
the
new
reduce
minimum
wage
will
not
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
"
.
if
ever
there
be
a
case
of
mislead
the
House
,
that
be
it
.
some
four
page
late
,
the
minister
introduce
the
universal
social
charge
,
which
be
define
in
the
financial
resolution
that
come
after
the
budget
speech
as
a
tax
.
it
be
a
tax
of
2
%
on
income
from
zero
to
approximately
€
10000
,
4
%
on
income
between
€
10000
and
€
16000
and
7
%
on
income
from
€
16000
upwards
.
not
only
have
that
concerned
suffer
the
reduction
in
the
minimum
wage
rate
of
itself
but
they
have
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
and
must
suffer
the
double
whammy
of
the
universal
social
charge
,
a
tax
,
on
top
of
it
.
to
give
a
idea
of
the
logic
and
a
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
minister
,
I
refer
the
House
to
the
debate
on
the
Financial
emergency
Measures
in
the
Public
Interest
Bill
of
Thursday
,
9
December
in
which
the
minister
state
:
the
government
decide
that
the
pay
of
the
Taoiseach
and
minister
should
be
cut
again
.
when
combine
with
the
change
in
taxation
and
prsi
in
the
budget
,
they
pay
will
drop
by
a
equivalent
percentage
amount
.
.
.
to
the
reduction
apply
to
the
minimum
wage
.
such
be
the
logic
that
dictate
how
this
government
work
.
it
be
the
logic
of
a
government
that
have
throw
out
the
window
the
idea
of
poverty
proof
any
taxation
or
budgetary
measure
.
it
be
high
time
it
be
boot
out
of
office
and
that
a
government
comprise
the
Labour
Party
be
bring
in
so
that
we
can
reverse
this
measure
and
restore
some
degree
of
equity
.
what
the
government
have
do
to
people
work
on
the
minimum
wage
be
grossly
unfair
;
there
be
no
other
way
of
put
it
.
it
be
contrary
to
any
canon
of
taxation
and
to
any
Republican
ideal
that
we
may
hold
in
term
of
how
one
treat
worker
in
a
economy
,
especially
that
on
the
margin
and
the
low
pay
.
it
be
grossly
unfair
and
it
should
be
reverse
.
when
the
Labour
Party
launch
its
budget
proposal
two
week
ago
,
reference
be
make
to
the
impact
of
the
national
minimum
wage
and
the
government
strategy
for
job
creation
.
accord
to
the
most
recently
available
statistic
,
41
%
of
that
on
the
live

have
a
manual
,
craft
or
industrial
background
.
one
third
of
that
aged
between
15
and
24
year
who
have
remain
in
the
labour
force
be
unemployed
.
we
be
concerned
that
116000
worker
,
some
6.6
%
of
the
workforce
,
be
live
below
the
poverty
line
;
that
the
working
poor
make
up
24
%
of
all
that
in
poverty
and
40
%
of
all

in

;
and
that
the

especially

upon

worker
.
a
total
of
68
%
of
that

hotel
,
catering
,
retail
and
wholesale
trade
.
low
or
no
employment
growth
be
anticipate
in
this
sector
in
future
because
there
will
be
a
permanent
contraction
from
boom
-
time
employment
level
.
consequently
,
a
cut
in
the
national
minimum
wage
will
not
lead
to
any
direct
job
creation
.
it
be
expect
the
primary
area
in
which
job
will
be
create
in
the
come
year
be
financial
service
,
insurance
,
business
and

and

and
ancillary

service
,
all
of
which
be
non-minimum

sector
.
the
Irish
labour
force
have
already
prove
itself
adaptable
and
flexible
.
the
decline
in

have
exceed
the
decrease
in

,
producer
price
and
gdp
by
11.2
%
between
2008
and
2010
.
in
manufacturing
,
the
real
effective
exchange
rate
be
expect
to
be
down
20
%
between
2008
and
2011
.
Lower
pay
manual
and
craft
job
have
be
hard
hit
by
the
reduction
in
gross
earnings
of
-
9.75
%
between
the
end
of
2008
and
the
start
of
2010
.
the
government
's
strategy
be
to
use
supply
side
solution
such
as
cut
social
welfare
benefit
and
the
national
minimum
wage
to
address
a
demand
-
lead
problem
in
a
slum
economy
.
this
be
a
illogical
,
incompetent
and
bogus
argument
for
that

rely
on
the
minimum
wage
.

Mr.
Kavanagh
from
Horse
Racing
Ireland
give
a
comprehensive
overview
on
the
state
of
play
at
today
's
meeting
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
his
overview
refer
to
a
fourth
consecutive
cut
to
the
horse
and
greyhound
racing
fund
which
have
fall
from
€
76
million
in
2008
to
€
57.2
million
in
2011
and
that
this
be
not
a
sustainable
position
from
which
to
develop
a
key
industry
.
across
the
political
divide
we
have
as
a
common
cause
the
interest
of
the
horseracing
and
greyhound
racing
industry
.
however
,
we
must
ensure
the
provision
at
paragraph
(
f
)
,
(
email
)
,
(
would
)
and
(
a
)
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
government
be
not
go
after
the
online
capture
.
I
would
like
further
clarification
as
to
how
this
provision
will
translate
in
real
term
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
taxpayer
through
the
Exchequer
should
continue
to
fund
the
industry
directly
through
the
provision
of
prize
money
.
we
all
understand
it
be
a
extensive
industry
and
support
the
aim
of
Horse
Racing
Ireland
,
but
we
must
ensure
tax
be
capture
from
the
punter
and
anybody
who
make
a
bet
whether
it
be
online
or
through
booky
office
on
-
street
.
I
speak
for
people
like
Mrs.
Bambury
in
Mallow
,
who
be
a
second
-
generation
bookmaker
but
who
do
not
have
a
online
presence
.
the
levy
be
be
collect
and
yet
there
be
bookmaker
in
Mallow
—
which
have
its
own
racecourse
—
which
have
a
on
-
street
and
online
presence
also
.
there
be
a
disparity
between
the
collection
from
the
on
-
street
presence
and
the
lack
of
a
collection
from
the
online
presence
.
we
should
go
after
the
online
betting
and
we
need
to
go
after
the
exchange
.
it
be
disingenuous
for
certain
celebrity
to
push
the
exchange
as
be
somehow
very
egalitarian
in
they
outlook
.
we
interpretation
be
that
,
by
they
very
nature
,
the
exchange
will
pay
out
the
prize
money
,
which
be
fair
enough
.
however
,
it
will
be
the
Exchequer
—
the
taxpayer
—
which
pay
the
prize
money
at
the
racing
stadia
and
so
on
.
we
need
to
introduce
a
level
playing
pitch
here
.
I
be
not
clear
as
to
the
various
paragraph
.
we
need
a
proper
analysis
.
perhaps
we
should
look
at
the
French
model
in
term
of
collection
.
the
submission
by
Mr.
Kavanagh
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
be
a
in
-
depth
one
and
there
be
a
actual
willingness
on
the
part
of
Horse
Racing
Ireland
to
engage
on
the
issue
of
capture
more
revenue
through
more
imaginative
means
.
I
ask
for
a
response
to
that
point
from
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
HRI
make
a
presentation
to
the
committee
today
.
there
be
9530
register
breeder
in
Ireland
,
some
15
%
be
overseas
investor
and
92
%
own

there
be
416

at
stud
in
2008
,
of
which
362
stand
for
a
fee
of
€
7000
or
less
.
we
must
support
the
industry
but
we
must
also
ensure
that
such
support
do
not
militate
against
the
taxpayer
.
the
industry
must
find
more
imaginative
way
to
fund
the
prize
money
henceforth
.
I
be

a
National
Strategy
for
High
Education
to
2030
,
otherwise
know
as
the
Hunt
report
,
be
publish
in
January
which
set
out
a
vision
for
the
future
development
and
direction
of
high
education
in
Ireland
over
the
next
two
decade
.
I
support
the
broad
analysis
of
the
strategy
in
recognise
the
central
role
high
education
play
in
economic
development
and
the
need
for
continue
state
investment
in
research
activity
.
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
I
will
be
work
closely
with
the
Minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
Innovation
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
and
other
colleague
in
co-ordinate
delivery
on
the
government
's
strategic
research
priority
and
in
seek
to
enhance
and
support
the
further
development
of
we
research
system
.
there
have
be
significant
investment
in
research
in
Ireland
over
the
past
decade
and
we
must
continue
to
build
on
this
investment
.
we
need
to
invest
across
the
full
range
of
discipline
,
include
the
humanity
and
social
science
,
to
maintain
a
broad
base
of
knowledge
and
capacity
,
couple
with
target
investment
in
specific
strategic
area
of
national
opportunity
.
we
must
continue
to
encourage
we
institution
to
work
together
and
build
critical
mass
around
area
of
key
strength
,
and
also
support
good
and
deep
working
relationship
with
industry
.
while
we
institution
have
develop
a
strong
base
of
research
activity
,
the
focus
of
the
next
stage
in
we
system
's
development
must
be
on
we
ability
to
maximise
the
impact
of
we
research
result
in
term
of
the
commercialisation
of
that
research
and
its
conversion
to
real
sustainable
job
.
in
this
regard
,
we
programme
for
government
pledge
to
introduce
a
number
of
measure
to
support
innovation
and
technology
development
in
we
institution
,
include
the
establishment
of
a
network
of
technology
research
centre
which
will
focus
on
apply
technological
research
in
specific
area
.
it
be
also
important
to
recognise
the
role
research
investment
play
more
generally
across
high
education
.
the
knowledge
create
through
research
and
the
skill
associate
with
research
activity
have
a
direct
bear
on
the
quality
of
teaching
and
learning
in
we
institution
and
on
the
formation
of
we
student
,
both
at
postgraduate
and
undergraduate
level
.
all
student
should
have
some
exposure
to
the
late
research
development
,
and
the
connection
between
the
teaching
and
research
mission
of
institution
must
remain
.
not
only
be
research
cover
under
the
education
and
skill
remit
but
there
be
also
a
important
function
under
the
enterprise
,
job
and
innovation
remit
.
within
that
substrata
there
be
a
specific
remit
vis-à
-
vis
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
,
PRTLI
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
alone
have
a
budget
of
€
160
million
for
2011
.
there
be
a
clear
priority
.
if
we
be
to
get
people
back
to
work
,
we
must
ensure
that
we
maintain
the
current
level
of
spending
within
that
area
in
so
far
as
possible
so
that
investment
can
be
maintain
.
it
will
thus
be
possible
through
SFI
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
research
programme
to
build
the
synergy
with
the
company
.
that
be
already
happen
;
the
model
be
well
establish
.
however
,
I
strongly
believe
that
the
government
's
job
must
be
to
try
to
grow
and
deepen
that
remit
and
commercialise
the
research
.
if
we
can
commercialise
the
research
and
continue
that
model
,
it
will
be
possible
to
create
more
job
from
the
third
level
sector
.

in

programme
for

a
commitment
have
be
give
to
establish
a
network
of
technology
research
centre
that
will
accelerate
the
exploitation
of
new
technology
and
bridge
the
gap
between
research
and
technology
commercialisation
.
the
initial
focus
will
be
in
the
key
area
of
biotechnology
,
nanotechnology
and
high
value
manufacturing
.
in
establish
the

,
cset
,
strategic
research
centre
and

centre
currently

my
intention
be
that
over
a
period
of
time
a
programme
will
be
devise
that
will
put
in
place
a
structure
,
or
structure
,
to
deliver
on
this
initiative
.
experience
have
show
that
the
good
result
be
deliver
when
such
centre
be
establish
by
means
of
a
competitive
process
.
in
this
way
the
good
proposal
come
to
the
top
,
idea
can
be
generate
and
refine
,
collaboration
establish
and
both
industry
and
research
centre
afford
a
opportunity
to
define
the
most
apposite
agenda
to
bring
together
both
the
need
of
the
present
and
the
opportunity
of
the
future
.
this
process
will
determine
both
the
timing
and
location
of
the
centre
.
the
programme
for
government
have
commit
to
the
initial
establishment
of
three
technology
research
centre
,
one
in
each
of
the
field
of
biotechnology
,
nanotechnology
and
high
value
manufacturing
.
the
establishment
of
a
apply
biotechnology
centre
be
timely
because
it
will
allow
Ireland
to
fully
capitalise
on
the
very
significant
investment
make
in
we
basic
research
base
since
the
late
1990
through
highly
talented
people
and
the
provision
of
world
-
class
infrastructure
.
nanotechnology
be
set
to
have
a
big
impact
on
sector
which
be
important
to
the
economy
,
in
particular
ICT
,
life
science
and
the
food
sector
.
Ireland
have
make
substantial
investment
in
nanotechnology
research
,
principally
in
CRANN
in
TCD
and
the
Tyndall
National
Institute
in
ucc
.
a
Forfás
review
of
the
nanotechnology
infrastructure
in
Ireland
propose
that
the
State
should
take
a
more
proactive
role
in
drive
the
commercialisation
of
nanotechnology
,
diversify
funding
and
collaborate
with
industry
and
academia
to
deliver
on
key
focus
area
and
leverage
exist
resource
more
fully
.
the
proposal
to
establish
technology
research
centre
can
facilitate
a
transformational
change
,
enable
Irish
industry
to
exploit
new
opportunity
.
the
timeframe
for
future
centre
will
be
determine
by
the
progress
and
success
of
the
three
initial
centre
.
we
already
have
a
process
in
place
which
adopt
the
cluster
approach
and
bring
together
industry
and
research
institution
.
the
purpose
be
to
create
synergy
between
industry
and
the
research
function
within
third
level
institution
in
order
that
research
finding
can
be
commercialise
.
in
the
apply
nanotechnology
sector
,
for
example
,
company
such
as
Aerogen
,
Analog
device
,
Intel
and
Medtronic
be
all
well
establish
and
already
have
well
establish
link
between
industry
and
the
research
component
.
the
deputy
have
raise
a
valid
point
as
to
when
research
take
place
and
when
the
finding
be
commercialise
.
a
relationship
be
develop
between
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
Enterprise
Ireland
and
it
be
grow
deep
as
the
month
pass
and
the
sector
become
a
more
important
part
of
the
economy
and
we
recovery
.
it
have
become
glaringly
obvious
that
we
need
to
ensure
the
two
agency
work
side
by
side
to
ensure
job
be
create
as
a
result
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
on
the
question
of
value
for
money
and
the
return
on
we
investment
.
I
have
the
same
question
and
,
therefore
,
beg
the
deputy
's
indulgence
in
give
a
response
.
at
this
time
I
be
be
brief
as
a
new
minister
of
State
and
only
develop
my
knowledge
of
the
situation
.
this
question
be
inherent
in
the
process
.
I
will
be
happy
to
share
information
with
the
deputy
in
due
course
.
the
deputy
's
comment
presuppose
that
there
be
no
interaction
between
the
private
sector
and
the
government
.
however
,
there
be
interaction
,
through
the
State
agency
.
I
invite
the
deputy
to
look
at
the
Enterprise
Ireland
website
or
interact
with
the
organisation
when
he
will
see
there
be
a
vast
array
of
company
which
interact
with
both
it
and
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
there
be
interaction
between
they
so
as
to
ensure
research
finding
can
be
commercialise
.
the
three
strand
select
be
industry
-
drive
and
drive
by
the
technology
leader
within
the
various
competence
centre
.
the
strategy
be
clear
and
well
think
out
.
if
the
deputy
have
idea
as
to
where
there
should
be
research
,
I
would
welcome
engagement
with
he
in
that
regard

the
programme
for

contain
a
commitment
that
the
government
within
thefirst
100
day
of
take

will
provide

this

will
contain

of
measure
to
support

creation
and
stimulate
economic
growth
,
while
enhance
the
activation
support
available

.
it
will
deliver
a

of
a
additional
15000

in

,
work
experience
and
educationalopportunity
for

detail
of
this
additional

place
will
be
contain
in
the
forthcoming

launch
,
which
be
due
next

.
the
activation

outline
in
the
initiative
will
be
in
addition
to
108500
training
place
,
168,000

further
education
sector
and
156000
place

high
education

,
which
the
unemployed
may
access
.
yes
.
I
nearly
refer
to
the
deputy
as
minister
as
I
mark
he
in
a
former
mandate
.
in
term
of
the
issue
raise
vis
-à
-
vis
graduate
,
there
will
be
a
clear
priority
within
the
upcoming
job
initiative
towards
adopt
a
qualitative
approach
to
internship
.
the
intention
be
to
take
a
more
holistic
view
of
the
workplace
programme
which
it
could
be
argue
be
not
necessarily
provide
for
the
progression
require
in
allow
student
to
progress
from
graduate
status
into
the
workplace
and
move
further
within
that
stream
.
there
be
a
clear
priority
in
term
of
internship
which
be
additional
to
the
exist
programme
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
there
be
at
least
276564
training
place
provide
for
if
one
take
the
FÁS
programme
,
the
Skillnet
programme
,
the
labour
market
activation
programme
,
the
plc
programme
and
the
VTOS
programme
.
they
be
well
encompass
and
the
15000
place
be
additional
.
it
be
envisage
that
there
will
be
a
particular
emphasis
on
provide
quality
internship
in
order
to
stem
the
tide
of
emigration
and
ensure
graduate
will
not
just
be
educate
to
take
up
job
in
such
place
as
Australia
and
other
country
.
a
qualitative
approach
will
be
take
to
the
placement
of
graduate
.
I
can
give
that
assurance
.
the
point
the
deputy
make
parallel
my
own
thinking
.
it
be
clear
that
what
be
require
be
a
more
holistic
approach
to
how
we
view
training
.
it
must
be
with
a
view
to
ensure
progression
and
a
outcome
in
order
that
the
person
in
training
either
stay
within
the
organisation
across
a
broad
public
or
private
sector
sphere
or
that
he
or
she
move
on
but
that
he
or
she
will
have
gain
a
progressive
experience
.
I
will
bear
in
mind
what
the
deputy
say
.
as
he
will
appreciate
,
at
this
juncture
I
cannot
say
what
will
be
in
the
job
initiative
document
,
but
there
will
be
a
clear
emphasis
on
the
point
he
make
.
the
programme
for
government
have
be
negotiate
and
mandate
by
the
House
.
the
most
prescient
approach
would
be
to
await
publication
of
the
job
initiative
.
I
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Ciaran
Cannon
.
the
review
group
be
establish
in
January
2009
.
the
review
be
carry
out
as
part
of
the
2009
-
11
round
of
value
for
money
review
approve
by
the
previous
government
and
conduct
in
accordance
with
the
criterion
for
such
review
set
out
in
the
Department
of
Finance
's
value
for
money
and
Policy
Review
Initiative
Guidance
Manual
.
the
emphasis
in
such
review
be
on
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
programme
under
examination
to
assess
value
for
money
in
they
delivery
.
the
composition
of
value
for
money
review
committee
can
vary
.
in
this
instance
,
membership
of
the
steering
committee
be
draw
from
my
Department
and
other
relevant
Department
and
include
a
independent
chairman
,
namely
,
Mr.
Willie
Soffe
,
former
county
manager
of
Fingal
County
Council
,
and
two
independent
expert
.
all
external
stakeholder
,
include
school
patron
and
parent
and
teacher
organisation
,
be
give
a
opportunity
to
make
they
view
on
the
school
transport
scheme
know
.
the
process
include
a
call
for
submission
on
a
range
of
specific
issue
which
result
in
85
submission
.
in
addition
,
follow
a
assessment
of
this
submission
and
in
order
to
give
stakeholder
a
further
opportunity
to
present
they
view
,
a
day
-
long
consultative
forum
be
organised
in
October
2009
by
the
steering
committee
with
a
combination
of
individual
session
and
a
open
forum
discussion
with
the
chairperson
and
committee
member
.
in
this
way
,
it
be
consider
by
the
steering
committee
that
all
stakeholder
be
afford
a
further
opportunity
to
make
a
meaningful
contribution
to
the
review
process
.
I
be
take
it
that
the
deputy
be
refer
to
the
issue
of
the
cessation
of
the
close
school
rule
,
CSR
,
as
it
relate
to
primary
school
transport
eligibility
.
this
change
be
announce
in
budget
2011
by
the
previous
Fianna
Fáil
-
Green
Party
government
and
derive
from
a
recommendation
in
the
publish
value
for
money
review
of
the
scheme
.
to
put
the
matter
in
context
,
the
review
show
that
the
unit
cost
of
primary
school
transport
be
€
1020
per
child
.
furthermore
,
the
four
year
national
recovery
plan
require
savings
of
€
4.5
million
to
be
make
through
operational
efficiency
and
other
savings
measure
in
the
school
transport
budget
in
2011
,
rise
to
overall
full
-
year
savings
of
€
17
million
by
2014
.
the
aggregation
of
the
measure
be
implement
arise
from
the
value
for
money
review
will
be
a
important
element
in
achieve
this
savings
.
it
be
important
to
stress
there
be
a
number
of
dimension
to
the
cessation
of
the
close
school
rule
.
the
first
of
this
which
will
be
implement
from
September
involve
the
uniform
application
of
the
distance
criterion
to
all
pupil
travel
under
the
primary
transport
scheme
,
include
that
travel
under
the
close
school
rule
.
this
mean
that
child
reside
less
than
3.2
kilometer
from
the
school
of
amalgamation
will
be
deem
ineligible
for
school
transport
.
in
such
case
,
the
child
concerned
may
apply
for
concessionary
transport
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
the
second
element
of
the
change
be
schedule
to
take
effect
in
September
2012
and
will
apply
only
in
the
case
of
pupil
commence
they
primary
education
from
that
date
.
this
second
element
will
restrict
school
transport
eligibility
for
that
pupil
enter
in
September
2012
to
pupil
who
meet
the
distance
eligibility
criterion
and
be
travel
to
they
near
school
.
available
statistic
,
base
on
sampling
undertake
as
part
of
the
value
for
money
review
,
indicate
that
the
impact
of
this
change
will
be
limit
as
the
majority
of
pupil
categorise
under
the
close
school
rule
be
,
in
fact
.
attend
they
near
school
.
therefore
,
the
majority
of
this
family
will
not
be
affect
by
this
change
.
before
implement
this
second
main
change
which
be
propose
for
2012
,
my
Department
have
request
Bus
Éireann
to
conduct
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
on
the
ground
impact
for
individual
school
and
the
rural
community
they
serve
.
this
analysis
will
be
base
on
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
information
available
on
current
school
transport
usage
pattern
and
I
expect
to
have
the
information
available
to
I
this
summer
.
I
will
then
have
a
opportunity
to
carefully
examine
the
likely
effect
of
this
change
well
in
advance
of
the
2012
implementation
date
.
I
concur
absolutely
with
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
on
the
basis
that
I
have
receive
representation
from
family
who
be
fearful
they
will
be
split
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
of
this
mechanism
.
I
be
aware
there
be
a
further
review
take
place
and
that
it
will
conclude
at
a
unspecified
date
some
time
this
summer
.
it
should
take
a
deep
look
at
exactly
how
many
will
be
affect
.
I
be
also
aware
of
the
potential
for
certain
parish
to
be
affect
adversely
,
whereby
a
amalgamate
school
may
,
ironically
,
have
reduce
number
in
the
future
.
there
be
no
question
but
that
a
number
of
issue
arise
from
the
implementation
of
the
initiative
.
however
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
give
we
some
time
pend
the
outcome
of
the
review
which
will
result
in
a
close
examination
of
the
exact
effect
on
family
.
I
hope
it
will
give
rise
to
a
further
set
of
public
utterance
by
the
minister
on
how
some
of
the
issue
could
be
tackle
.
no
additional
post
be
allocate
for
Traveller
pupil
under
DEIS
in
each
of
the
past
three
year
because
Traveller
pupil
in
all
school
,
include
that
in
the
DEIS
programme
,
be
support
under
the
resource
Teacher
for
Traveller
scheme
,
which
,
the
deputy
will
be
aware
be
discontinue
by
the
previous
government
.
however
,
up
to
this
year
,
Traveller
pupil
be
not
include
in
the
valid
enrolment
for
the
purpose
of
implement
the
more
favourable
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
DEIS
school
.
as
I
indicate
in
my
response
to
he
question
of
24
March
,
Traveller
pupil
have
be
include
in
the
valid
enrolment
for
the
purpose
of
allocate
additional
staffing
under
DEIS
from
the
2011
/
12
school
year
.
I
can
now
advise
the
deputy
that
81
post
have
be
provide
for
this
purpose
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue

,
in

I
assure
the
deputy
and
this
House
that
since
assume
office
I
have
incorporate
a
strong
focus
on
we
research
and
development
strength
and
incentive
in
my
engagement
with
government
and
business
abroad
,
and
with
overseas
government
and
business
presence
in
this
country
and
I
will
continue
to
do
so
.
I
engage
with
Commissioner
Máire
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
recently
when
I
meet
with
she
at
the
recent
Council
of
Minister
meeting
in
Budapest
.
I
signal
to
she
this
country
's
strong
intention
of
seek
to
ensure
that
we
can
draw
down
the
maximum
amount
and
hit
the
target
of
€600
million
under
the
current
framework
programme
7
and
that
we
would
endeavour
to
surpass
that
target
if
we
could
but
,
furthermore
and
more
importantly
,
that
we
would
engage
deeply
with
she
on
the
next
framework
programme
which
we
feel
would
ensure
that
we
can
continue
on
the
programme
for
research
and
development
in
this
country
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
research
engine
keep
go
and
we
can
build
on
that
.
I
do
not
know
how
much
time
I
have
.
in
establish
the
itinerary
for
any
official
visit
abroad
,
the
three
State
enterprise
agency
,
IDA
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
work
very
closely
together
,
with
my
own
Department
and
with
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
.
the
objective
be
clear
:
we
want
to
achieve
increase
sale
and
export
and
to
headline
we
attractiveness
as
a
locale
for
FDI
.
this
entail
set
out
we
stall
not
only
on
the
12.5
%
corporation
tax
rate
and
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
but
also
on
we
intellectual
capital
and
other
attraction
and
in
restore
reputational
damage
in
that
regard
also
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
Ireland
's
ongoing
development
as
a
centre
for
research
excellence
continue
to
be
a
crucial
factor
in
the
attraction
of
foreign
direct
investment
and
SFI
serve
as
a
magnet
of
attraction
for
FDI
through
its
support
of
research
expertise
in
ICT
,
biotechnology
and
energy
,
its
341

,
its
partnership
with

give
the
small
size
of
the
Irish

,
increase

will
be
largely
achieve

through

.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
therefore
focus
on
every
aspect
of
the
exporting
and
trade
development
process
and
the
promotion
of
Irish
company
on
overseas
trade
visit
be
a
key
part
of
this
process
.
overseas
visit
present
a
opportunity
to
build
awareness
among
the
international
community
of
the
availability
of
sophisticated
product
and
service
emerge
from
innovation
and
research
and
development
within
indigenous
industry
.
we
have
other
strength
,
complementary
to
we
fiscal
regime
and
intellectual
capital
.
the
availability
of
qualified
labour
,
a
workforce
note
among
peer
internationally
for
its
flexibility
and
adaptability
and
fall
cost
in
term
of
property
,
workforce
and
energy
.
we
task
,
work
together
with
the
relevant
Department
and
agency
,
be
to
marshal
all
of
this
strength
to
deliver
a
positive
outcome
.
on
the
first
part
of
the
question
,
as
the
deputy
be
well
aware
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
have
already
visit
India
and
a
further
visit
to
the
Unite
State
be
envisage
some
time
during
the
summer
.
the
deputy
will
also
be
aware
that
the
President
have
visit
the
Netherlands
.
part
of
that
process
involve
engage
on
the
European
Space
Agency
,
ESA
,
programme
in
which
six
Irish
company
be
already
involved
.
a
internal
engagement
in
ongoing
on
the
content
service
centre
.
we
do
not
have
definitive
timeline
at
this
stage
but
there
be
a
very
clear
direction
within
the
programme
for
government
that
we
would
build
on
the
exist
centre
of
excellence
and
create
three
additional
competence
centre
.
that
engagement
be
currently
ongoing
.
I
be
happy
to
engage
with
the
deputy
on
the
matter
,
as
I
would
be
with
any
member
of
the
House
,
because
it
be
in
the
national
interest
that
we
continue
to
ensure
we
can
build
on
the
€600
million
that
be
invest
in
research
and
development
in
this
country
.
the
research
and
sti
programme
will
be
vital
in
order
to
ensure
that
company
already
in
this
country
which
be
base
on
the
FDI
model
stay
here
and
that
we
can
build
and
add
to
what
exist
.
that
be
why
the
budget
line
be
vital
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
on
the
matter
.
I
thank
he
sincerely
for
he
kind
remark

that
be
a
bit
of
a
flimsy
argument
.
the
deputy
be
clutch
at
straw
.
give
we
a
little
time
.
the
deputy
have
some
neck
.
no
,
the
queen
be
come
.
I
welcome
the
job
initiative
.
it
be
not
design
to
be
a
panacea
and
I
do
not
believe
a
panacea
can
be
achieve
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
.
what
it
seek
to
do
,
however
,
be
to
provide
a
overarching
framework
which
will
underpin
the
economic
recovery
.
within
that
framework
there
be
a
set
of
criterion
so
exist
job
can
be
maintain
,
the
cost
of
do
business
can
be
reduce
,
people
can
be
help
back
to
work
and
there
can
be
a
attempt
to
restore
confidence
in
the
economy
.
in
that
way
people
can
begin
the
recovery
which
be
so
vital
to
we
national
interest
and
to
the
interest
of
that
people
who
be
look
at
this
House
and
ask
what
we
be
try
to
do
to
fulfil
we
mandate
to
they
.
at
this
juncture
member
of
the
Opposition
may
posit
the
notion
that
the
initiative
do
not
necessarily
fulfil
all
the
obligation
set
out
in
the
Labour
Party
or
Fine
Gael
manifesto
.
however
,
a
programme
for
government
be
agree
and
mandate
by
this
House
.
in
the
normal
day
to
day
life
of
a
parliament
we
score
point
off
one
another
—
this
be
vital
and
we
have
all
do
it
.
the
situation
be
that
we
will
not
get
the
400000
people
we
want
to
see
back
in
work
back
at
work
within
eight
or
nine
week
.
it
be
simply
not
possible
.
what
we
can
do
,
however
,
be
to
try
to
instil
some
confidence
and
some
pride
in
the
fact
that
governance
in
this
country
be
base
on
the
idea
that
we
will
serve
the
people
—
—
—
uto
the
good
of
we
ability
.
we
be
try
within
the
very
meagre
resource
we
have
—
which
be
squander
—
to
try
to
fulfil
a
programme
that
set
down
this
very
parameter
.
I
fulfil
the
research
and
innovation
brief
and
be
greatly
encourage
that
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
will
bring
about
a
benefit
in
ensure
we
can
try
to
fulfil
that
agenda
.
it
be
vital
to
we
national
interest
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
parameter
set
down
in
the
agenda
for
research
and
development
be
as
a
result
of
work
by
successive
government
in
the
past
,
include
the
previous
one
.
through
the
State
agency
they
identify
the
vital
part
research
and
innovation
fulfil
in
support
job
.
the
single
message
that
emerge
be
that
if
we
do
not
support
the
research
and
innovation
agenda
now
,
over
a
long
period
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
be
able
to
maintain
exist
job
acquire
through
foreign
direct
investment
.
if
parent
company
see
that
we
be
not
continue
we
investment
in
such
research
this
may
send
a
signal
that
this
agenda
be
be
sideline
.
it
be
vital
that
through
initiative
such
as
the
one
announce
yesterday
we
send
a
signal
to
the
world
that
we
will
continue
to
ensure
we
can
maintain
the
number
of
job
we
have
,
as
well
maintain
the
quality
link
between
research
and
foreign
direct
investment
related
job
and
thereby
continue
to
attract
further
job
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
about
the
area
of
research
and
development
.
the
positive
evidence
for
economic
recovery
be
clear
.
this
year
,
for
the
first
time
in
three
year
,
we
can
look
forward
to
positive
growth
which
we
fully
expect
to
accelerate
as
we
move
into
2012
and
beyond
.
this
be
by
contrast
with
the
year
between
2007
and
2010
when
the
volume
of
goods
and
service
produce
in
Ireland
fall
by
12
%
.
on
foot
of
recent
gain
in
competitiveness
and
improve
external
demand
the
export
sector
of
the
economy
be
once
again
perform
very
well
generally
.
last
year
export
increase
by
9.5
%
in
real
term
,
the
strong
rate
of
growth
for
more
than
a
decade
.
look
to
the
future
,
export
growth
be
project
at
around
6.75
%
in
2011
and
5.75
%
in
2012
.
we
focus
now
,
and
for
the
foreseeable
future
,
be
on
the
maintenance
and
growth
of
sustainable
job
.
I
be
glad
to
say
the
augury
be
good
on
this
front
.
the
number

this
come
about
because
of
the
proactivity
of

be
responsible
for
the

double

I
acknowledge
,
as
one
must
,
this
come
about
as

of
a

moreover
,
this

the

during
a

one
might
expect
to
see
company
make
cut
in
area
such
as

spend
but
the
BERD
figure
show
that
Irish
business
continue
to
invest
in
this

,
mainly
due
to
recognition
of
the
importance
of
bring

,
I
intend
to
have
the
review
complete
as
quickly
as
possible
.
I
propose
to
take
five
minute
.
I
refer
to
a
point
make
by
deputy
Luke
'
Ming
'
Flanagan
about
maximise
a
potential
within
community
to
grow
that
sector
and
to
develop
local
market
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
deputy
on
that
score
.
I
look
at
model
in
upstate
New
York
of
community
-
support
agriculture
.
I
be
very
much
on
the
same
page
as
the
deputy
on
that
issue
.
a
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
and
the
meat
sector
would
mean
a
small
number
of
large
farm
feed
into
a
co-operative
structure
which
will
probably
be
restructure
.
one
must
then
have
due
regard
for
the
small
community
-
base
agriculture
and
the
small
farm
and
they
place
in
a
community
and
social
structure
.
because
they
be
so
vital
we
need
to
ensure
they
be
not
leave
behind
.
I
hope
that
once
the
new
Oireachtas
committee
structure
be
up
and
run
we
will
be
able
to
discuss
that
kind
of
issue
.
local
authority
should
be
encourage
to
maximise
a
new
space
and
look
at
model
be
roll
out
in
place
such
as
Tralee
and
other
town
.
the
use
of
land
could
be
maximise
especially
around
urban
area
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
do
not
lose
the
family
farm
structure
.
the
family
farm
should
not
be
leave
behind
.
I
would
like
to
speak
about
the
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
.
milk
quota
will
be
abolish
in
2015
.
we
all
buy
into
the
food
harvest
2020
proposal
.
however
,
we
be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
it
may
present
some
constraint
.
will
great
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
result
in
jobless
growth
?
will
it
result
in
the
existence
of
just
one
or
two
milk
dryer
in
this
country
?
what
would
be
its
permutation
be
for
regional
growth
in
this
country
?
there
be
challenge
in
this
regard
.
if
there
be
a
50
%
increase
in
milk
production
,
it
must
be
accompany
by
job
creation
.
we
cannot
have
jobless
growth
.
we
must
ensure
we
continue
to
add
value
to
milk
as
a
commodity
.
that
be
where
my
research
and
innovation
brief
come
into
play
.
Teagasc
be
do
a
great
deal
of
work
on
infant
formula
at
its
Moorepark
facility
in
Fermoy
.
it
want
to
ensure
the
commodity
have
a
research
component
and
to
add
value
in
order
to
create
job
.
there
be
a
engagement
in
that
space
.
if
we
do
not
engage
politically
,
however
,
there
be
a
danger
that
we
could
get
leave
behind
.
my
role
be
to
prioritise
research
so
that
we
can
mine
as
much
potential
as
possible
from
the
food
industry
while
feed
into
policy
at
the
same
time
.
I
hope
we
can
realise
the
potential
of
research
in
assist
the
add
value
process
.
if
that
do
not
happen
,
there
be
a
danger
that
we
will
go
down
the
commodity
line
and
,
as
a
result
,
fail
to
create
the
type
of
job
we
need
to
create
in
this
sector
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
it
be
all
very
well
to
talk
about
the
expansion
of
the
dairy
and
meat
sector
,
but
there
be
a
danger
that
growth
will
not
be
accompany
by
job
creation
.
we
all
favour
expansion
.
we
do
not
know
what
the
post
-2015
scenario
will
be
.
many
young
farmer
be
scaling
up
at
the
moment
because
they
can
see
the
potential
that
offer
.
we
need
to
have
due
regard
for
that
small
farmer
who
do
not
have
the
require
economy
of
scale
to
act
in
a
similar
manner
.
we
be
conscious
of
the
need
of
that
sector
of
the
agricultural
community
.
the
provision
of
any
traffic
calming
measure
be
a
matter
for
each
local
authority
.

I
wish
to
sympathise
with
the
worker
and
they
family
.
this
decision
be
take
by
Vodafone
and
it
raise
some
question
which
have
be
clearly
and
well
articulate
by
the
Deputy
.
I
will
not
refer
to
my
script
because
I
honestly
believe
that
serious
question
have
be
raise
,
include
the
relationship
with
Vodafone
which
be
a
very
profitable
company
.
when
the
issue
be
raise
by
the
Deputy
,
Vodafone
supply
the
Department
with
some
information
which
would
not
necessarily
have
answer
the
question
put
.
with
this
in
mind
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
I
some
leeway
so
I
can
interact
with
Vodafone
's
public
affair
section
,
and
with
Enterprise
Ireland
because
I
understand
Rigney
Dolphin
be
a
client
company
,
and
so
that
we
can
examine
the
exact
reason
the
outsource
have
begin
.
accord
to
a
document
receive
from
Vodafone
,
it
be
expect
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
consultation
process
the
credit
and
collection
activity
will
be
outsource
to
a
specialist
supplier
in
Ireland
.
mobile
datum
and
customer
operation
will
transfer
to
a
exist
group
subsidiary
base
in
Egypt
and
mobile
back
office
will
transfer
to
a
subsidiary
company
base
in
India
.
I
also
understand
that
Ireland
be
not
the
only
country
affect
by
the
Vodafone
move
.
the
group
also
move
call
centre
operation
from
Germany
to
Egypt
.
rather
than
give
the
Deputy
a
pro
forma
answer
,
I
ask
they
to
allow
I
some
leeway
.
deputy
Adams
refer
to
the
Communication
worker
's
Union
and
if
it
have
be
in
touch
with
he
,
I
would
be
more
than
happy
to
field
a
telephone
call
from
it
on
this
matter
.
I
cannot
give
any
guarantee
as
it
be
a
corporate
decision
.
all
I
can
say
be
that
we
be
commit
to
try
to
retain
job
.
the
State
agency
in
this
region
as
well
as
the
Louth
County
Enterprise
Board
will
continue
to
promote
Dundalk
as
a
centre
for
inward
investment
and
enterprise
development
.
I
acknowledge
the
Deputy
have
raise
some
interesting
point
.
Vodafone
employ
1200
staff
in
various
location
in
Ireland
which
be
a
significant
investment
in
this
country
and
that
must
be
acknowledge
.
however
,
question
have
be
raise
this
evening
and
perhaps
this
merit
further
examination
.
I
would
be
happy
to
oblige
the
deputy
in
so
far
as
I
be
able
to
do
so
and
I
will
endeavour
to
help
they
in
this
regard
.
there
be
great
synergy
between
tourism
and
sport
.
in
particular
sport
tourism
can
be
a
valuable
instrument
in
the
promotion
of
Ireland
both
at

will
further
boost
we
economy

showcase

long

the

seek

for
disconnection
from

,
as
have
be
introduce

simply
propose
to
provide
explicitly
for

to
be
grant
,
as
obligate
by
the
two
EU
directive
I
mention
early
.
additional
information
not
provide
on

all

enshrine
in

domestic

by

as
I
have
state
,
a

I
have
just

as
it
happen
I
have
take

in
the
matter
when
the
judgment
be
issue
.
I
have
consult
official
in
my
Department
and
,
as
minister
,
I
have
signal
today
that
the

must
make
progress
on
this
matter
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
provide
a
definitive
timeline
to
the

at
this
juncture
but
,
as
he
state
,
there
be
a
clear
and
urgent
need
to
engage
on

issue
and
to
ensure
the

.
I
will
revert
to

on
the

give
it

be
a
quite
complex
area
,
I
ask
that
I
may
revert
to

however

clear
for

to

the

that
who
advocate

of

point
to
the
significant
body
of

rights
legislation
now
in

as
provide
adequate
legal
protection
for
employee
rights
and
interest
.
however
,
the
review
team
conclude
that
it
be
not
accurate
to
suggest
that
the
body
of
primary
employment
rights
legislation
currently
in

adequately
cover
matter

with

and

.
most
of
the
EROs
provide
for
overtime
payment
and
premium
payment
to
that
require
to
work
on
Sunday
.
this
provision
be
a
source
of
significant
concern
to
employer
in
sector
which
normally
trade
on
Sunday
.
they
contend
that
the
cost
of
employ
staff
on
Sunday
be
now
prohibitive
.
independently
of
the
JLCs
,
the
obligation
to
provide
additional
compensation
for
Sunday
working
be
derive
primarily
from
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
.
the
review
team
believe
,
however
,
that
the
mode
of
compliance
with
that
provision
should
be
address
to
ensure
uniform
and
fair
arrangement
across
the
affect
sector
.
there
be
potentially
substantial
competitive
gain
that
could
be
realise
in
some
of
the
affect
sector
by
reform
the
structure
of
decision
making
in
jlc
so
that
the
system
be
more
flexible
and
responsive
to
the
need
of
particular
sector
.
competitiveness
can
also
be
enhance
by
simplify
the
system
in
a
way
that
reduce
the
burden
of
supervision
and
compliance
and
by
provide
a
degree
of
co-ordination
and
oversight
over
the
system
that
ensure
arrangement
across

be
reasonable
and
proportionate

I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Regina
Doherty
and
Buttimer
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
Mallow
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
commitment
that
be
give
on
Mallow
General
Hospital
regard
accident
and
emergency
service
but
I
be
open
to
correction
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
Mallow
Hospital
Action
Committee
since
I
enter
public
life
.
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
we
have
be
through
a
very
difficult
and
dramatic
time
,
especially
when
on
Tuesday
,
19
April
,
it
be
announce
by
the
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
,
HIQA
,
that
it
would
investigate
the
service
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
at
the
time
it
be
purport
that
the
investigation
be
on
foot
of
a
complaint
,
which
turn
out
not
to
be
the
case
.
when
HIQA
visit
the
hospital
,
it
find
the
staff
,
clinician
and
physician
be
absolutely
and
utterly
beyond
reproach
.
I
note
the
comment
of
deputy
Donnelly
.
in
parallel
with
the
investigative
process
,
there
be
a
roadmap
for
the
reconfiguration
of
Cork
and
Kerry
hospital
whereby
the
designation
of
Mallow
would
evolve
or
change
to
reflect
the
concern
that
arise
in
the
HIQA
report
.
all
the
stakeholder
,
include
the
hospital
action
committee
of
which
I
be
a
member
,
physician
,
gps
and
that
who
be
refer
to
the
hospital
be
part
of
the
process
.
the
endgame
be
to
ensure
we
could
maintain
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
in
order
that
more
service
would
be
take
out
of
Cork
University
Hospital
on
a
elective
basis
,
acute
surgical
service
could
be
maintain
and
a
urgent
care
centre
or
medical
assessment
unit
establish
which
would
allow
for
the
vast
bulk
of
case
that
present
on
a
emergency
basis
to
continue
to
be
deal
with
in
Mallow
.
we
be
on
that
route
map
until
I
discover
this
week
that
certain
force
within
the
HSE
want
to
derail
it
and
go
way
beyond
the
HIQA
recommendation
to
reduce
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
.
I
be
encourage
by
a
meeting
I
have
with
the
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
James
Reilly
.
he
reflect
a
statement
he
make
when
the
HIQA
report
be
issue
,
namely
,
that
he
be
strongly
commit
to
the
role
of
small
hospital
.
I
can
only
speak
for
Mallow
with
any
great
authority
.
we
now
need
to
get
the
roadmap
back
on
track
so
that
if
we
have
to
go
through
change
management
,
it
will
reflect
HIQA
.
however
,
it
must
not
be
solely
for
budgetary
reason
.
it
have
to
allow
for
a
situation
to
arise
whereby
we
can
take
more
of
the
elective
procedure
that
can
be
do
in
Mallow
and
have
a
short
stay
surgical
unit
in
order
that
we
can
continue
to
have
a
emergency
department
facility
and
begin
to
facilitate
the
structure
around
CUH
.
if
we
proceed
along
a
pathway
that
seek
to
excise
acute
surgery
or
the
acute
medicine
programme
from
Mallow
in
a
short
space
of
time
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
contribute
to
the
risk
profile
of
large
hospital
like
CUH
.
we
must
be
cognisant
and
very
wary
of
the
need
to
ensure
hospital
such
as
Mallow
have
a
role
.
we
need
to
consider
in
a
more
lateral
way
how
the
role
can
proceed
.
Mallow
differ
from
other
hospital
in
that
HIQA
have
examine
it
and
provide
recommendation
.
the
issue
of
licensing
be
come
down
the
track
.
no
matter
what
one
's
political
hue
be
—
I
accept
this
a
long
time
ago
—
one
have
to
take
the
view
that
one
do
not
reduce
the
capacity
.
the
HIQA
requirement
should
be
meet
,
we
should
ensure
that
a
hospital
have
a
license
to
practice
and
that
service
can
be
deliver
,
albeit
possibly
in
a
different
way
.

which
engage
with

where
a

be
find
.
I
would

time
adviser

I
be
willing

if
the

specific
people
who
have
identify
a
range
of
issue
,
the
Department
will
have
to
engage
with
such
people

it
be
vital

my

and
the
HEA
,
in
collaboration
with
the
Secretariat
to
the

on

Skill

,
be
also
work
closely
with

to

my
attention
have
not
be
draw
to
the
specific
comment
of
the
UK
company
MD
to
which
the
deputy
refer
.
however
,
I
be
aware
that
the
Irish
equivalent
company
point
out
that
cloud
datum
be
not
in
any
different
position
than
any
other
kind
of
datum
in
term
of
its
exposure
to
government
access
,
whether
by
the
US
or
many
other
country
.
a
recent
report
by
ENISA
,
the
EU
body
responsible
for
information
security
conclude
that
hold
datum
in
the
cloud
could
represent
both
a
risk
and
a
protection
in
that
the
concentration
of
datum
may
be
a
attractive
target
but
the
economy
of
scale
can
allow
defence
to
be
more
robust
.
the
Irish
data
Protection
Commissioner
have
point
out
that
robust
EU
and
national
datum
protection
law
must
be
comply
with
and
that
the
legislation
be
technology
neutral
and
must
be
comply
with
equally
when
datum
be
move
to
the
cloud
.
Ireland
be
extremely
well
-
place
to
take
advantage
of
the
rapidly
-
grow
international
potential
of
cloud
computing
.
a
recent
report
commission
by
Microsoft
have
estimate
that
by
2014
the
cloud
computing
industry
in
Ireland
could
be
worth
€
9.5
billion
and
employ
8600
people
.
now
more
than
ever
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
seize
opportunity
like
this
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
job
will
be
create
automatically
,
and
government
must
act
decisively
and
urgently
if
we
be
to
position
Ireland
as
a
world
leader
in
this
high
-
growth
sector
.
in
May
I
announce
the
establishment
of
a
€
5
million
apply
research
centre
in
cloud
computing
,
which
will
bring
industry
and
researcher
in
this
sector
together
in
order
to
turn
good
idea
into
good
job
.
I
have
also
establish
a
cross-Government
implementation
group
on
cloud
computing
,
to
support
the
implementation
of
the
ambitious
programme
for
government
commitment
on
cloud
computing
.
in

the

that

this

provide

some
of
the
confusion
evident
in
some
of
the
public

it

show
that

the

this

we

that
represent
a

within

with

there

in

33.7

by

that
have
risen
to

—
—
—
at
a
cost
in
excess
of
€340
million
.
as
deputy
McGrath
be
interject
,
it
should
be
note
for
the
record
—
—
—
—
that
he
be
a
member
of
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
that
implement
a
lot
of
the
decision
—
—
—
—
that
be
make
that
give
rise
to
the
detrimental
situation
in
which
this
economy
and
society
find
itself
.
he
be
the
classic
Tadhg

thaobh
and
ex-Fianna
Fáil
revisionist
who
jump
ship
when
it
be
politically
expedient
for
he
to
do
so
.
that
should
be
put
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
in
all
,
there
be
more
than
20000
adult
,
include
snas
and
resource
-
learning
support
teacher
in
school
to
support
child
with
special
educational
need
.
each
year
my
Department
make
detailed
plan
,
take
account
of
population
growth
,
for
future
allocation
of
resource
across
all
area
of
education
,
include
special
education
.
in
this
context
,
deputy
may
wish
to
know
that
the
pupil
population
to
SNA
ratio
have
reduce
from
252:1
in
2001
to
78:1
in
2010
.
by
any
standard
the
development
and
growth
of
the
special
need
assistant
programme
have
be
remarkable
.
I
wish
to
stress
that
with
equitable
and
careful
management
and
distribution
of
this
resource
it
be
consider
that
there
should
be
sufficient
post
to
provide
access
to
sna
support
for
all
child
who
require
such
care
support
to
attend
school
.
deputy
will
be
aware
of
the
recent
value
for
money
and
policy
review
of
the
sna
scheme
.
the
review
have
find
that
the
scheme
be
support
school
in
meet
the
need
of
eligible
student
,
and
that
it
have
assist
as
many
student
as
possible
to
be
include
in
mainstream
school
.
however
,
the
review
also
point
to
a
possible
over
-
allocation
of
snas
in
school
of
which
10
%
be
in
special
school
and
up
to
27
%
in
mainstream
school
.
the
decision
to
introduce
a
cap
on
overall
sna
number
mean
that
all
sna
post
will
now
be
subject
to
annual
review
and
there
will
be
ongoing
monitoring
of
overall
sna
number
throughout
the
year
,
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
of
the
review
.
that
will
facilitate
the
allocation
of
sna
support
in
the
most
fair
and
equitable
way
.
I
note
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
in
that
regard
,
but
if
one
be
to
have
teaching
assistant
then
one
will
have
to
have
a
teaching
assistant
scheme
.
it
be
either
a
sna
scheme
or
it
be
a
teaching
assistant
scheme
.
the
case
she
make
be
a
genuine
one
.
the
review
have
also
conclude
that
the
SNA
scheme
have
move
away
from
the
objective
of
the
scheme
originally
envisage
,
which
be
to
provide
for
child
's
care
need
in
a
educational
setting
,
and
have
move
towards
sna
involvement
in
behavioural
,
therapeutic
,
pedagogical
and
administrative
duty
.
the
review
conclude
that
this
may
stem
from
a
lack
of
understanding
of
the
role
of
the
sna
which
have
lead
to
inefficiency
in
the
system
.
school
and
parent
have
come
to
expect
the
allocation
of
sna
post
for
student
whose
care
need
do
not
meet
the
term
of
the
scheme
.
I
wish
to
be
clear
in
explain
to
the
House
that
there
be
no
plan
for
the
expansion
of
the
sna
scheme
beyond
the
provision
of
support
to
school
to
enable
they
support
the
care
need
of
pupil
with
disability
.
the
value
for
money
and
policy
review
be
clear
in
that
respect
when
it
state
the
crucial
importance
of
communicate
the
purpose
of
the
sna
scheme
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
care
role
envisage
for
the
sna
be
understand
by
school
,
professional
and
parent
,
and
that
snas
be
not
use
to
supplement
teaching
or
as
therapeutic
support
for
student
.
the
NCSE
allocate
separate
additional
teaching
expertise
to
provide
the
additional
teaching
support
need
for
this
child
.
I
wish
to
be
clear
on
some
key
issue
regard
the
sna
scheme
:
snas
be
be
allocate
on
the
basis
of
priority
criterion
and
in
a
consistent
manner
.
the
NCSE
will
use
its
professional
judgment
in
that
regard
.
some
of
the
priority
criterion
which
apply
be
:
ensure
that
the
minimum
sna
to
special
class
ratio
be
maintain
in
both
special
school
and
special
class
;
ensure
that
school
which
have
enrol
child
with
the
most
significant
special
care
need
be
support
to
meet
that
need
;
ensure
the
provision
of
support
for
child
with
incontinence
issue
;
and
ensure
that
the
full
-
day
cover
provision
be
not
reduce
below
a
full
day
.
to
ensure
that
the
allocation
of
snas
for
the
2011
to
2012
school
year
be
manage
in
a
prudent
and
responsible
manner
,
the
NCSE
,
in
consultation
with
the
Department
,
have
decide
to
retain
approximately
475
of
the
10575
sna
post
in
order
that
they
be
available
to
be
allocate
over
the
remainder
of
the
school
year
.
that
will
ensure
the
NCSE
retain
the
capacity
to
meet
urgent
case
as
they
arise
over
the
school
year
while
also
ensure
that
the
overall
number
of
sna
post
allocate
will
remain
within
the
cap
number
of
10575
.
the
reserve
post
will
be
prioritise
to
address
appeal
and
emergency
case
,
acquire
injury
and
new
assessment
during
the
school
year
,
new
entrant
to
school
,
and
reconsideration
of
allocation
level
for
school
in
which
intervention
have
be
unsuccessful
.
a
process
will
be
in
place
in
the
new
school
year
to
review
allocation
decision
to
ensure
correct
procedure
be
follow
and
that
they
comply
with
the
Department
's
policy
.
I
understand
the
NCSE
will
communicate
this
to
school
early
in
the
new
school
year
.
school
,
for
they
part
,
must
demonstrate
that
they
have
make
every
effort
to
manage
they
allocation
of
sna
post
to
good
effect
.
in
2010
the
Department
provide
9600
post
for
learning
support
and
resource
teaching
.
it
be
intend
to
provide
9950
learning
support
and
resource
teaching
post
in
the
2011
-
2012
school
year
,
a
increase
of
350
.
this
be
a
historically
high
level
of
provision
.
it
have
be
calculate
that
,
base
on
the
number
of
application
receive
to
date
for
resource
teaching
support
by
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
,
a
allocation
of
90
%
of
the
identify
resource
teaching
allocation
can
be
make
to
school
in
the
first
instance
.
this
will
provide
school
with
the
majority
of
they
allocation
while
preserve
enough
capacity
to
ensure
the
department
can
provide
for
late
or
emergency
application
while
remain
within
ECF
obligation
.
I
wish
to
clarify
for
the
House
that
4538
post
available
in
mainstream
primary
school
under
the
general
allocation
model
of
additional
teaching
support
be
not
affect
by
the
90
%
measure
.
the
effect
of
a
90
%
allocation
of
resource
teaching
support
mean
a
reduction
of
six
minute
per
hour
of
resource
teaching
allocate
.
school
can
make
up
additional
time
through
grouping
of
child
,
double
of
child
and
more
effective
management
of
teaching
time
.
when
the
full
level
of
demand
be
know
,
the
initial
90
%
allocation
may
be
revisit
.
as
deputy
be
aware
,
a
number
of
section
of
the
Education
for
Person
with
special
Educational
need
Act
2004
have
be
commence
,
principally
that
establish
the
NCSE
and
that
promote
a
inclusive
approach
to
the
education
of
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
Department
have
establish
a
cross-
departmental
working
group
,
include
relevant
agency
personnel
,
to
consider
each
non-commenced
part
of
the
act
.
the
group
will
focus
on
prepare
a
plan
for
the
implementation
of
the
act
.
the
government
continue
to
ensure
all
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
have
access
to
psychological
assessment
.
we
have
commit
to
reverse
the
cap
place
on
the
number
of
psychologist
employ
by
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
.
the
issue
of
recruiting
more
psychologist
will
be
keep
under
review
in
the
context
of
the
overall
employment
control
framework
in
the
public
sector
.
there
be
no
change
propose
to
the
provision
of
school
transport
service
,
include
escort
,
for
eligible
child
with
special
educational
need
.
at
present
,
my
Department
also
provide
a
direct
grant
to
500
parent
to
support
they
school
transport
cost
.
the
grant
have
be
review
and
from
the
start
of
the
come
school
year
it
will
be
base
on
Civil
service
mileage
rate
.
in
the
face
of
economic
turmoil
,
the
government
have
prioritise
the
provision
of
support
for
pupil
with
special
educational
need
.
as
well
as
teacher
and
special
need
assistant
,
we
will
continue
to
provide
assistive
technology
,
specialist
equipment
,
adapt
school
building
and
special
school
transport
arrangement
.
we
will
protect
front
-
line
education
service
as
much
as
possible
within
the
resource
we
have
to
work
with
.
however
,
this
must
be
do
within
the
context
of
bring
we
overall
public
expenditure
back
into
line
with
what
we
can
afford
as
a
country
.
all
area
of
government
will
have
to
manage
on
a
reduce
level
of
resource
.
the
challenge
will
be
to
ensure
the
resource
that
can
be
provide
be
use
to
maximum
effect
to
achieve
the
good
possible
outcome
for

I
commend
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
House
.
will
the
deputy
repeat
that
?
I
be
resist
the
temptation
to
break
into

.
as
the

will
support

other
measure
announce
in

initiative
help
to
promote

in

such
as
halv
the

of

that

up
to

remove

cut

.
the
green
economy
be
a
area
which
could
become
strategically
important
for
Ireland
at
a
global
level
.
we
have
a
number
of
particular
strength
which
can
realise
job
and
growth
opportunity
and
contribute
to
export
-
lead
growth
.
the
sector
already
employ
18,775
people
and
the
value
of
the
Irish
market
in
this
sub-sector
be
estimate
at
€
3
billion
in
2010
.
however
,
the
value
of
the
sector
globally
be
set
to
increase
rapidly
,
drive
by
a
range
of
factor
,
include
EU
directive
and
regulation
,
rise
energy
cost
,
increase
investment
in

,
and

additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
the
Department
's
agency
,
namely
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
have
establish
unit
dedicate
to
work
with
both
indigenous
and
multinational
company
in
the
so
-
call
cleantech
sector
.
a
practical
example
of
the
success
of
Enterprise
Ireland
's
support
for
the
sector
be
see
in
last
week
's
announcement
of
the
creation
of
145
job
in
County
Galway
in
the
manufacturing
of
wind
turbine
.
another
notable
development
be
that
green
financial
service
be
part
of
the
new
strategy
for
the
IFSC
which
be
launch
by
the
Taoiseach
last
week
.
a
number
of
policy
issue
need
to
be
address
to
realise
the
potential
of
the
sector
.
some
relate
to
planning
and
licensing
.
other
relate
to
the
capacity
of
the
electricity
grid
and
the
price
for
delivery
of
renewable
energy
.
I
will
work
with
other
colleague
to
develop
this
policy
framework
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
on
the
change
of
emphasis
over
recent
year
,
but
I
disagree
with
he
on
the
Green
Party
's
agenda
.
all
party
in
the
House
have
be
engage
with
the
agenda
for
a
long
time
.
a
additional
2000
job
be
create
in
2011
.
a
cabinet
sub
-
committee
be
deal
directly
with
this
area
and
it
give
government
impetus
to
it
.
there
be
a
challenge
for
Ireland
in
the
next
phase
of
commitment
which
we
have
to
meet
on
carbon
reduction
.
that
should
give
rise
to
new
opportunity
in
this
field
.
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
how
many
job
will
be
create
.
no
one
can
do
that
and
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
do
so
.
however
,
I
agree
with
the
deputy
in
another
respect
.
a
swot
analysis
be
carry
out
and
it
show
that
there
be
a
lack
of
coherence
in
overall
policy
due
to
a
large
number
of
State
and
local
agency
be
involve
,
and
there
be
some
fragmentation
of
the
research
base
.
that
be
now
be
firmly
take
in
hand
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
Taoiseach
launch
the
strategy
for
the
international
financial
service
industry
2011
-
16
.
one
of
the
initiative
be
the
creation
of
the
Green
IFSC
whereby
we
pin
down
area
in
which
there
be
new
opportunity
range
from
carbon
management
,
ip
commercialisation
,
private
equity
investment
to
green
tech
fund
management
.
the
government
be
engage
in
this
space
.
it
be
impossible
,
realistically
,
to
set
a
finite
target
for
job
creation
.
the
main
point
be
that
we
be
set
down
the
policy
framework
by
which
we
can
drive
this
agenda
and
ensure
strong
political
co-ordination
and
coherence
.
on
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
's
proposal
,
I
respectfully
ask
he
to
make
contact
with

Rabbitte
,

that
he
seek

the
Commissioner
highlight
the
fact
that
upcoming
call
for
proposal
under
FP7
in
July
2011
and
July
2012
would
be
worth
approximately
€
18
billion
.
with
a
budget
of
over
€
50
billion
in
the
period
2007
to
2013
,
FP7
be
the
European
Union
's
main
instrument
for
funding
research
and
development
in
Europe
.
in
order
to
extract
the
maximum
benefit
from
the
opportunity
available

a

a

towards

across
all
the
Department

a
mix
of
guidance

Ireland
's

for

Achievement
of

already
award
to

.
I
be

will
achieve

the
next
European
Framework
Programme
for
Research
and
Innovation
,

be
call
Horizon
2020
,
will
operate
from
2014
to
2020
,
for
which
the
European
Commission
have
propose
a
budget
of
€
80
billion
in
its
recently
publish
multi-annual
financial
framework
for
the
period
.
while
no
target
have
be
set
for
the
next
framework
programme
which
have
yet
to
be
propose
by
the
commission
and
agree
by
the
Council
,
I
be
determined
to
ensure
ambitious
government
policy
be
in
place
in
order
that
we
can
continue
to
improve
we
performance
.
there
be
a
multi-
layer
approach
in
this
respect
.
there
be
clear
recognition
of
a
strong
policy
start
by
successive
government
which
form
the
foundation
for
ensure
the
maximisation
of
the
potential
for
the
drawdown
of
fund
.
we
be
already
involved
in
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
that
will
seek
to
concentrate
on
specific
theme
of
research
and
,
ultimately
,
commercialise
that
research
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
have
regard
to
the
educational
aspect
of
basic
research
and
the
commercialisation
agenda
.
the
prioritisation
exercise
which
involve
all
of
the
State
agency
interact
with
each
other
and
the
Department
be
about
ensure
we
maximise
the
potential
to
meet
we
target
.
in
regard
to
Horizon
2020
,
the
process
seek
to
ensure
we
will
be
more
ambitious
and
that
Ireland
will
become
a
agenda
setter
for
the
programme
.
if
I
be
to
proffer
a
personal
opinion
,
I
would
contend
we
could
be
do
more
on
the
commercialisation
agenda
.
if
we
be
spin
out
more
company
,
for
instance
,
from
the
high
education
institute
,
that
would
ultimately
lead
to
further
job
creation
.
it
must
be
remember
also
that
we
investment
in
research
,
or
research
,
development
and
innovation
,
through
the
collaborative
approach
with
all
of
the
foreign
direct
investment
company
house
here
,
ensure
they
continuation
in
the
country
.
it
also
ensure
great
innovation
in
this
company
.
it
be
a
two
-
prong
approach
.
it
be
about
try
to
achieve
more
in
the
commercialisation
space
through
the
creation
of
more
company
and
also
about
ensure
the
exist
foreign
direct
investment
,
FDI
,
infrastructure
be
not
compromise
in
any
way
.
it
be
also
about
ensure
the
research
component
be
maintain
.
the
high
Court
indicate
that
it
intend
to
grant
a
order
declare
section
42
,
43
,
and
45
of
the
Industrial
Relation
Act
1946
and
section
45
of
the
1990
Act
to
be
unconstitutional
.
in
this
new
Bill
,
the
response
by
deputy
O'Dea
have
be
to
import
the
exact
provision
of
four
original
section
that
have
feature
in
the
now
lap
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
.
the
2009
Bill
have
be
introduce
by
the
last
government
in
the
summer
of
2009
but
it
do
not
proceed
beyond
its
second
stage
reading
in
this
House
,
which
be
complete
on
11
February
2010
.
regrettably
that
Bill
fail
to
make
any
progress
on
the
last
government
's
legislative
programme
until
it
eventually
lap
with
the
end
of
the
last
dáil
.
the
only
really
novel
provision
in
this
Bill
be
at
section
7
,
which
repeal
section
45
of
the
1946
act
which
make
it
a
offence
for
a
employer
to
pay
to
a
worker
remuneration
less
than
the
statutory
minimum
remuneration
,
or
to
fail
to
comply
with
statutory
condition
of
employment
.
this
section
,
which
the
high
Court
rule
be
unconstitutional
,
be
the
subject
of
recommendation
19
in
the
independent
review
report
,
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
.
that
report
recommend
that
the
mechanism
for
enforce
ero
be
bring
into
line
with
that
for
regulate
employment
agreement
and
that
,
as
a
alternative
to
a
criminal
prosecution
,
a
complaint
could
be
bring
before
the
Labour
Court
.
the
report
recommend
that
NERA
be
authorise
to
bring
such
a
complaint
in
respect
of
either
a
REA
or
a
ero
.
I
welcome
the
proposal
to
decriminalise
the
initial
step
in
the
enforcement
process
of
ero
.
it
make
sense
,
as
Kevin
Duffy
and
Dr.
Walsh
have
recommend
,
to
allow
room
for
NERA
to
bring
a
complaint
to
the
Labour
Court
on
behalf
of
a
individual
or
group
of
worker
rather
than
retain
the
current
arrangement
where
enforcement
be
only
by
way
of
a
prosecution
before
the
District
Court
.
unfortunately
the
incorporation
of
the
propose
amendment
on
the
enforcement
of
ero
at
section
7
be
the
only
provision
in
the
Bill
that
respond
directly
to
the
specific
recommendation
in
the
independent
review
report
.
the
new
Bill
do
not
contain
any
provision
to
respond
to
other
specific
change
that
be
call
for
in
the
recommendation
of
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
.
recommendation
16
of
that
report
call
for
all
of
the
change
that
be
propose
in
the
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
to
be
enact
along
with
amendment
to
cover
the
additional
recommendation
make
in
the
report
regard
the
legislative
framework
within
which
both
the
ero
and
REA
system
operate
.
it
make
no
sense
to
tackle
this
task
in
a
piecemeal
way
or
to
leave
rea
to
the
mercy
of
some
continue
legal
challenge
.
unfortunately
this
Bill
do
not
address
the
significant
range
of
change
call
for
by
Kevin
Duffy
and
Dr.
Frank
Walsh
to
safeguard
the
statutory
wage
-
set
machinery
from
the
threat
of
constant
litigation
and
judicial
review
.
recommendation
1
of
the
independent
review
report
also
call
for
a
amendment
to
the
Industrial
Relation
act
of
1990
to
provide
a
means
whereby
the
scope
of
the
particular
establishment
order
of
jlc
could
be
review
by
the
Labour
Court
.
the
report
also
recommend
that
the
Labour
Court
be
empower
to
undertake
periodic
review
of
ero
in
the
interest
of
great
clarity
as
regards
they
purpose
and
the
classification
of
the
worker
and
the
type
of
enterprise
cover
.
action
with
regard
to
this
recommendation
will
be
crucial
to
provide
protection
for
ero
against
further
legal
challenge
.
recommendation
9
of
the
independent
review
report
also
call
for
amendment
to
be
make
to
the
Industrial
Relation
Act
of
1990
regard
the
constitution
and
proceedings
of
jlc
.
this
be
another
critical
area
in
which
action
be
now
require
in
light
of
the
high
court
ruling
.
unfortunately
at
a
time
when
it
be
vital
to
provide
more
certainty
for
vulnerable
worker
in
low
-
pay
sector
the
propose
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
present
by
deputy
O'Dea
offer
only
limited
protection
.
I
be
convinced
that
the
urgent
preparation
of
substantive
legislation
represent
the
only
reliable
means
of
guarantee
protection
for
vulnerable
worker
in
low
-
pay
sector
.

carry
out

the

refer

I
acknowledge
the
rate
of

highlight
by
the

.
Preliminary
result
show
68

only

the
survey
finding
will
help
we
obtain
a
clear
picture
of
what
be
happen
in

and
allow
we
to
plan
to
meet
training
need
.
the
school
have
until
26
September
to
respond
.
the
Department
be
keen
to
arrive
at
a
position
in
which
all
teacher
of
mathematics
have
a
qualification
in
the

.
it
be
make
arrangement
for
the
provision
of
a
new

programme
for
mathematics

which
will
provide
unqualified
mathematics

with
the
opportunity
to
upskill

knowledge
of
the

and
study

strategy
well
suit
to
the
new
project
math
syllabus
.
tender
will
be
invite
shortly
.
we
can
overcome
the
challenge
face
we
notwithstand
the
recruitment
embargo
.
the
national
centre
of
excellence
in
the
University
of
Limerick
be
do
a
great
deal
of
work
in
the
area
of
continue
professional
development
to
enable
teacher
to
attain
the
require
standard
.
in
addition
,
there
be
conversion
course
that
can
be
do
.
in
this
way
we
can
ensure
we
have
a
coterie
of
teacher
with
the
right
skill
set
to
help
we
to
achieve
we
aim
.
the
question
of
how
we
get
to
this
point
be
one
that
would
have
to
be
tease
out
over
a
long
time
period
than
the
two
minute
I
have
.
however
,
if
we
be
open
to
the
challenge
,
which
we
be
,
we
must
find
out
where
we
need
to
go
.
deputy
Murphy
raise
valid
issue
about
fragmentation
,
with
which
I
agree
.
we
must
ensure
there
be
standardisation
across
the
board
and
that
the
Teaching
Council
and
the
individual
board
of
management
be
sing
from
the
same
hymn
sheet
in
term
of
what
we
need
to
achieve
.
however
,
I
be
confident
that
the
project
Maths
initiative
,
in
spite
of
whatever
hiccup
it
may
have
along
the
way
,
will
ensure
we
can
help
the
student
currently
achieve
E
,
F
and
ng
grade
to
move
up
the
scale
.
I
be
less
concerned
about
that
currently
achieve
a
,
b
and
C
grade
.
the
introduction
of
bonus
point
for
math
will
facilitate
that
student
who
choose
not
to
do
honour
math
because
it
be
time
consume
.
they
can
devote
more
time
to
ordinary
level
math
and
still
get
a
reasonable
number
of
point
.
there
will
be
a
tender
process
for
training
and
continue
professional
development
.
we
be
engage
with
industry
and
academia
in
this
regard
,
but
there
be
challenge
.
we
will
not
turn
the
ship
around
within
the
next
12
month
.
however
,
we
be
engage
with
the
issue
in
a
deep
fashion
than
heretofore
.
base
on
the
sounding
I
have
take
outside
of
the
usual
advisory
group
—
I
have
delve
into
academia
and
seek
the
view
of
individual
teacher
—
there
be
a
sense
that
if
we
stay
on
track
with
Project
Maths
,
we
can
tackle
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
issue
involve
in
get
grade
up
.
I
apologise
for
not
give
deputy
Murphy
a
more
comprehensive
answer
,
but
I
will
be
happy
to
engage
further
with
she
on
a
individual
basis

I
thank
deputy
Smith
for
raise
this
matter
.
my
primary
concern
be
with
the
worker
face
uncertainty
today
.
take
account
of
the
domestic
economy
,
Aviva
have
decide
to
review
its
operation
to
ensure
its
capacity
be
in
line
with
domestic
demand
to
ensure
sustainability
.
Industry
figure
show
that
general
insurance
have
fall
by
more
than
20
%
in
the
past
two
year
,
while
life
insurance
and
pension
have
fall
by
more
than
30
%
,
due
to
concern
over
long
-
term
savings
and
people
cancel
or
reduce
pension
policy
.
Aviva
have
state
it
be
commit
fully
to
Ireland
and
be
currently
in
discussion
with
union
represent
staff
about
the
review
.
until
this
review
have
be
complete
,
it
would
be
premature
to
speculate
about
the
outcome
.
to
be
fair
,
it
be
pertinent
that
the
government
allow
the
union
to
engage
with
Aviva
to
see
where
that
process
might
go
.
as
for
the
role
of
the
IDA
,
the
deputy
have
great
knowledge
than
I
in
this
regard
and
be
well
aware
that
it
support
multinational
company
predominantly
trade
outside
Ireland
or
internationally
.
as
part
of
its
business
in
work
to
attract
international
activity
into
Ireland
from
multinational
company
,
the
IDA
have
be
in
contact
with
Aviva
at
both
corporate
and
local
level
.
the
minister
have
ask
the
IDA
,
give
its
knowledge
of
the
company
,
to
continue
to
work
with
it
to
mitigate
any
possible
negative
outcome
.
consequently
,
the
IDA
have
be
active
in
this
regard
.
Ireland
have
succeed
in
build
a
international
financial
service
industry
that
be
diverse
in
the
activity
carry
out
and
which
enjoy
a
world
-
lead
reputation
in
several
sector
.
while
the
past
three
year
have
represent
a
severe
stress
test
for
all
the
financial
centre
,
firm
at
the
International
Financial
Service
Centre
have
show
resilience
and
flexibility
.
employ
33000
people
directly
and
many
more
indirectly
,
the
IFSC
remain
both
critical
as
a
employer
and
as
a
centre
of
economic
activity
.
the
goal
of
ensure
that
job
and
economic
activity
be
protect
be
a
mainstay
for
the
government
and
I
ask
that
member
allow
further
review
to
take
place
and
for
the
discussion
to
conclude
with
the
union
represent
the
staff
.
the
government
undoubtedly
will
engage
at
a
late
point
.
yes
,
certainly
.
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
statement
.
there
be
no
sense
of
complacency
on
the
part
of
the
government
on
this
issue
.
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
the
cabinet
have
ask
the
IDA
,
give
its
knowledge
of
the
company
,
to
continue
to
work
with
it
to
mitigate
any
possible
negative
outcome
.
let
we
be
frank
.
I
can
dance
around
the
language
of
redundancy
and
job
loss
but
if
a
multinational
company
that
transcend
many
boundary
have
decide
the
course
of
action
it
will
take
,
it
be
difficult
for
government
to
influence
decision
.
nobody
want
job
loss
but
sometimes
decision
be
make
in
other
centre
,
financial
powerhouse
and
capital
city
other
than
Dublin
.
the
key
point
be
for
we
to
engage
with
the
company
and
try
to
move
it
from
its
current
trajectory
in
term
of
job
loss
.
we
will
do
everything
we
can
in
that
respect
.
if
the
company
make
a
decision
God
or
man
will
not
shift
it
.
we
should
be
honest
and
frank
about
the
discourse
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
the
same
situation
as
TalkTalk
do
not
arise
and
there
be
a
early
warning
system
that
ensure
we
can
engage
with
a
company
to
try
to
stem
the
flow
of
job
loss
and
learn
valuable
lesson
to
ensure
the
policy
be
taper
to
have
the
right
mix
of
company
.
I
will
engage
further
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
.
the
deputy
's
comment
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
and
I
will
relate
they
to
the
minister
and
the
IDA
.
the
Teaching
Council
recently
carry
out
a
survey
of
post
-
primary
school
to
ascertain
the
qualification
of
math
teacher
.
the
result
of
the
survey
show
that
a
significant
majority
of
teacher
—
68
%
—
teach
math
in
258
school
be
fully
qualified
to
do
so
,
that
29
%
have
pursue
some
study
in

and
that
only
2
%
have
not
obtain
third

qualification
or
pursue

in

.
the
Teaching
Council
have
ask
school
which
have
not
complete
the
early
survey
to
do
so
by
26
September
.
provide
for
high
quality
teaching
and
learning
of
mathematics
be
of
key
strategic
importance
to
the
State
.
as
part
of
the
government
's
overall
strategy
to
improve
the
teaching
and
learning
of
math
in
school
,
my
Department
be
make
arrangement
for
the

of
a
new
training
programme
for

teacher
.
this
will
provide
unqualified

knowledge
of

and
study
the
strategy
well
suit
to
the
new
project
math
syllabus
.
to
give
the
deputy
a
straight
answer
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
do
this
.
as
he
be
well
aware
,
the
board
of
management
of
school
have
autonomy
in
respect
of
who
they
hire
and
fire
.
there
be
a
issue
of
governance
in
that
regard
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
faith
in
the
process
be
undertake
.
we
must
obtain
the
result
of
the
survey
and
analyse
they
.
as
announce
on
12
September
,
a
programme
that
will
allow
for
continue
education
and
continue
professional
development
,
CPD
,
for
unqualified
math
teacher
be
to
be
roll
out
.
the
contract
in
this
regard
be
due
to
go
to
tender
shortly
.
I
would
be
cautious
with
regard
to
the
Department
exercising
control
over
decision
make
by
individual
school
.
again
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
faith
.
we
will
analyse
the
result
of
the
survey
and
proceed
cautiously
.
there
must
be
a
outcome
which
ensure
teacher
be
properly
qualified
and
that
student
obtain
good
result
in
they
examination
.
in
that
context
,
we
must
seek
to
ensure
there
be
a
deep
engagement
in
this
matter
.
we
will
not
turn
the
ship
around
overnight
;
it
be
go
to
take
some
time
to
do
this
.
be
the
deputy
refer
to
the
teaching
of
math
?
I
ask
that
the
deputy
table
a
separate
parliamentary
question
on
that
matter
.
this
question
relate
to
the
teaching
of
math
.
with
regard
to
deputy
Smith
's
question
,
there
be
no
exact
figure
for
the
take
-
up
of
CPD
.
however
,
I
will
endeavour
to
come
back
to
he
at
a
late
date
with
additional
information
on
the
matter
.
if
he
be
ask
whether
I
be
satisfied
with
the
rate
of
reply
to
the
survey
,
the
straight
answer
be
that
I
be
not
.
the
school
have
until
26
September
to
provide
response
to
it
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
some
forbearance
and
allow
we
to
assess
the
position
at
that
point
.
the
Department
and
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
be
extremely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
we
must
grapple
with
this
issue
.
we
must
do
so
on
the
basis
that
we
will
be
provide
with
a
true
picture
of
the
actual
scenario
.
in
that
context
,
the
agency
and
stakeholder
involve
have
be
give
a
clear
signal
to
the
effect
that
we
require
sound

my
comment

matter

in

to
concern

the
teaching
of
mathematics
,
I
expect
to
receive
shortly
full
figure
from
a
Teaching
Council
survey
of
the
qualification
of
mathematics
teacher
in
second

school
.
Initial
indication
from

school
which
have
respond
,
approximately
one
third
,
be
that
some
68
%
of

29
%

undergyne

as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
we
be
currently
engage
in
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
the
purpose
of
the
exercise
be
to
narrow
down
key
element
of
area
of
research
so
we
can
continue
to
attract
that
kind
of
FDI
in
order
that
we
can
ensure
we
have
a
platform
for
the
basic
research
and
apply
research
and
that
the
level
of
collaboration
between
industry
and
academia
be
deepen
so
we
can
ensure
we
can
continue
on
that
platform
and
to
put
we
even
high
up
the
global
ranking
in
research
and
innovation
.
no
party
or
government
should
claim
for
itself
this
evolutionary
process
which
have
be
put
in
place
since
1996
by
various
party
.
it
be
only
successful
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
organisation
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
,
the
IDA
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
Forfás
which
have
the
level
of
expertise
to
pitch
to
a
market
and
attract
the
type
of
company
we
need
.
I
apologise
to
Opposition
Member
because
my
time
be
limited
and
I
would
like
to
respond
.
since
July
,
some
1400
people
have
sign
up
to
the
job
initiative
and
the
national
internship
scheme
.
it
will
not
be
a
panacea
but
it
be
make
incremental
progress
.
that
be
how
the
government
will
proceed
.
we
will
not
have
a
great
leap
forward
within
the
next
thee
or
four
month
because
we
must
still
address
a
deficit
issue
which
have
be
acknowledge
by
all
side
of
the
House
.
there
will
be
difference
over
the
manner
in
which
we
continue
to
address
the
deficit
,
but
we
still
have
that
restraint
in
term
of
we
public
finances
which
hamper
one
's
ability
to
concentrate
solely
on
stimulus
.
it
will
be
a
mix
of
stimulus
and
retrenchment
,
which
be
the
reality
of
the
situation
.
I
will
not
blame
past
government
but
will
rather
look
forward
to
we
FDI
and
strong
export
sector
.
my
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
John
Perry
,
will
soon
be
receive
the
first
draft
report
of
the
small
business
advisory
group
.
he
announce
today
that
county
enterprise
board
will
get
another
€
3.1
million
.
this
be
all
initiative
which
locally
and
nationally
will
create
the
type
of
stimulus
we
need
.
it
be
a
slow
,
incremental
process
but
we
heart
and
mind
be
in
the
right
place
.
if
I
be
to
engage
in
a
bit
of
rhetoric
along
with
some
of
my
counterpart
in
opposition
,
I
would
say
that
to
govern
be
to
choose
.
that
mean
we
will
have
to
make
tough
decision
in
future
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
be
try
to
keep
the
basic
right
.
I
would
like
to
address
the
habitat
directive
and
farming
,
as
deputy
have
refer
to
they
.
the
"
food
harvest
2020
"
document
have
be
buy
into
by
all
stakeholder
involve
in
the
rural
economy
,
include
the
co-operative
movement
and
farming
organisation
.
we
will
see
tangible
growth
in
that
area
,
but
the
challenge
be
whether
it
will
be
jobless
growth
.
I
acknowledge
we
must
be
cognisant
of
that
also
.
flooding
be
refer
to
and
the
deputy
mention
he
inability
to
get
information
on
the
habitat
directive
.
however
,
not
one
deputy
in
the
technical
Group
have
ever
approach
I
as
a
minister
to
ask
for
any
kind
of
briefing
on
the
area
I
represent
,
which
be
a
foundation
for
the
growth
we
be
talk
about
.
like
other
minister
,
my
door
be
open
to
any
member
of
the
House
in
order
to
engage
with
they
constructively
on
any
aspect
.
let
we
do
away
with
the
rhetoric
that
have
fill
the
air
for
a
long
time
.
we
will
work
together
constructively
with
that
on
the
Opposition
bench
.
I
extend
the
invitation
.
I
extend
the
invitation
to
Opposition
Member
to
engage
with
we
on
a
personal
level
and
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
bring
they
agenda

I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
as
I
report
to
the
House
on
the
22
September
,
Aviva
be
undertake
a
review
of
its
operation
in
response
to
a
significant
reduction
in
demand
for
insurance
and
pension
product
.
Aviva
have
find
it
necessary
to
review
its
operation
here
to
ensure
its
cost
base
be
in
line
with
domestic
demand
to
ensure
sustainability
.
the
ceo
of
Aviva
Ireland
have
assure
the
minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
that
no
decision
have
be
take
on
the
final
structure
or
potential
job
loss
.
he
have
also
confirm
that
Aviva
be
commit
to
remain
a
significant
player
in
the
Irish
insurance
and
assurance
market
.
as
the
ceo
of
Aviva
have
confirm
that
the
company
be
in
ongoing
contact
with
employee
representative
,
it
would
be
premature
to
speculate
about
the
outcome
.
to
be
fair
,
it
be
pertinent
that
the
government
allow
the
union
to
engage
with
Aviva
to
see
where
that
process
might
lead
.
the
company
have
give
a
commitment
to
communicate
the
result
of
the
review
to
my
Department
and
IDA
Ireland
when
complete
.
we
anticipate
that
the
review
will
be
complete
by
the
end
of
October
.
in
the
interim
,
IDA
Ireland
be
in
contact
with
the
company
at
both
corporate
and
local
level
,
with
the
intention
of
mitigating
the
impact
of
potential
negative
outcome
follow
the
review
.
IDA
Ireland
be
also
in
dialogue
with
the
company
on
potential
future
opportunity
in
respect
of
the
company
's
significant
international
business
.
in
this
context
,
recent
media
coverage
do
not
reflect
a
formal
announcement
by
the
company
.
the
review
of
its
operation
be
ongoing
and
the
company
have
not
officially
confirm
the
scale
of
potential
job
loss
.
my
Department
,
through
IDA
Ireland
,
be
monitor
the
situation
closely
and
will
engage
further
with
the
company
at
any
stage
.
let
we
be
straight
.
if
a
global
company
such
as
Aviva
decide
to
restructure
,
it
be
pertinent
,
if
there
be
engagement
with
the
trade
union
in
the
organisation
,
that
we
allow
such

,
in

the
Irish
Patent
Office
provide
for
the
granting
of
patent
and
register
of
trademark
and
industrial
design
.
in
1964
,
a
new
Patent
Act
be
pass
to
bring
we
legislation
in
line
with
that
of
the
main
industrial
country
.
this
reflect
Ireland
's
outward
look
focus
for
economic
development
through
international
commerce
,
which
have
continue
to
this
day
.
the
main
body
of
Irish
patent
law
be
contain
in
the
Patent
Act
1992
which
now
serve
to
meet
we
national
need
and
we
international
obligation
.
over
the
past
decade
,
it
have
become
clear
that
Ireland
's
international
competitiveness
depend
increasingly
on
goods
and
service
,
which
have
high
knowledge
content
.
a
recent
report
show
that
enterprise
across
all
business
sector
spend
almost
€
1.8
billion
on
research
and
development
activity
in
2010
.
a
effective
patent
system
be
the
key
to
convert
that
investment
into
economic
growth
.
it
be
imperative
that
this
knowledge
be
capture
at
the
early
stage
,
protect
and
exploit
to
its
full
potential
.
today
,

be

through

or
through
the
European

Office

in
Munich

,
be
a
intergovernmental
institution
comprise
38
country
,
the
EU
27
along
with
11
other
European
country
.
the
function
of
the
office
be
to
examine
patent
application
and
grant
a
European
patent
if
the
relevant
condition
be
meet
.
it
be
worth
note
that
patent
application
originate
in
Ireland
to
the
European
patent
Office
have
be
increase
steadily
,
underline
the
importance
to
industry
of
European
patent
protection
.
patent
application
to
the
epo
have
risen
by
44
%
and
grant
of
European
patent
to
Irish
applicant
have
increase
by
21
%
since
2004
.
unfortunately
,
the
European
patent
process
can
be
expensive
and
complex
which
can
act
as
a
disincentive
,
especially
for
small
and
medium
-
size
firm
.
a
company
wish
to
protect
its
invention
across
Europe
apply
to
the
European
patent
Office
for
a
patent
.
once
a
European
patent
be
grant
by
the
office
the
proprietor
must
designate
the
country
where
he
or
she
want
patent
protection
and
then
the
patent
must
be
validate
in
each
member
state
.
at
this
stage
the
European
patent
effectively
become
a
bundle
of
national
patent
.
to
validate
a
patent
,
a
full
translation
of
the
patent
must
be
lodge
in
each
country
designate
,
in
the
national
language
of
that
country
.
this
translation
cost
make
up
a
very
sizeable
portion
of
the
cost
of
acquire
a
European
patent
and
the
cost
must
be
borne
by
the
applicant
.
as
a
result
,
the
European
patent
be
uncompetitive
when
compare
with
the
cost
of
obtain
US
and
Japanese
patent
.
let
I
put
the
matter
in
real
term
.
a
European
patent
validate
in
13
European
country
be
about
ten
time
more
expensive
than
a
US
patent
and
13
time
more
expensive
than
a
Japanese
patent
when
process
and
translation
cost
be
take
into
account
.
it
have
be
estimate
that
validate
a
patent
in
27
country
cost
€
32000
,
of
which
€
23000
be
for
translation
alone
.
Anecdotal
evidence
suggest
this
translation
into
national
language
be
hardly
ever
consult
.
only
1
%
of
patent
go
down
the
litigation
route
and
in
the
event
that
a
court
case
ensue
,
the
authentic
text
of
the
patent
before
the
judge
be
always
the
patent
text
as
grant
by
the
European
patent
Office
.
meanwhile
,
the
national
translation
require
all
over
Europe
remain
in
the
drawer
.
moreover
,
it
usually
take
four
or
five
year
to
process
and
grant
a
patent
in
the
European
patent
Office
.
consequently
,
this
translation
do
not
serve
the
purpose
of
inform
the
public
about
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
new
technology
,
as
they
be
only
require
to
be
file
after
the
patent
have
be
grant
.
there
be
other
cost
associate
with
the
translation
requirement
such
as
filing
and
publication
fee
to
local
national
office
.
local
patent
agent
often
act
as
intermediary
between
the
patent
proprietor
and
the
national
patent
office
where
the
translation
be
to
be
file
.
this
patent
agent
take
on
the
role
of
ensure
formal
requirement
lay
down
by
national
law
be
comply
with
and
the
correct
fee
be
pay
.
obviously
,
the
patent
agent
have
to
be
pay
for
provide
this
service
and
a
recent
study
conduct
by
the
European
Commission
conclude
that
this
cost
vary
from
around
€
150
to
€600
per
validation
,
depend
on
the
member
state
involve
.
if
a
patent
be
be
validate
in
a
number
of
country
,
we
can
see
how
this
cost
can
mount
up
.
they
particularly
affect
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
young
innovative
company
,
start
-
up
company
and
public
research
university
.
research
show
that
Irish
industry
,
as
elsewhere
,
often
take
a
selective
cost
effective
approach
when
designate
state
for
patent
protection
,
thus
leave
the
patent
vulnerable
in
that
state
not
designate
.
in
order
to
reduce
this
cost
,
a
intergovernmental
conference
hold
in
London
in
2000
adopt
the
London
agreement
.
this
agreement
,
which
enter
into
force
in
May
2008
,
set
out
to
reduce
the
cost
to
applicant
by
ease
the
requirement
to
file
translation
of
grant
patent
under
the
European
patent
Convention
in
that
country
that
sign
up
to
the
agreement
.
the
overall
aim
of
the
agreement
be
to
reduce
the
cost
of
translation
across
the
38
member
state
by
50
%
.
in
order
to
reach
this
level
of
reduction
,
it
be
vital
that
all
member
state
of
the
European
patent
Convention
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
.
article
65
of
the
European
patent
Convention
provide
that
any
contracting
state
may
require
a
translation
of
the
text
of
a
European
patent
into
one
of
its
language
,
if
that
language
be
different
from
the
language
in
which
the
patent
be
grant
.
under
the
London
agreement
,
the
party
to
the
agreement
undertake
to
waive
,
entirely
or
largely
,
the
requirement
for
translation
of
European
patent
to
be
file
in
they
national
language
.
in
effect
,
under
the
agreement
,
state
with
English
,
French
or
German
as
a
official
language
will
dispense
with
translation
requirement
entirely
for
the
patent
to
come
into
effect
.
have
English
as
a
official
language
,
Ireland
would
have
to
dispense
with
the
requirement
to
seek
a
translation
into
English
of
the
detailed
specification
of
European
patent
draw
up
in
French
or
German
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
claim
which
be
the
core
part
of
the
patent
that
define
the
limit
of
the
monopoly
would
continue
to
be
available
in
English
after
grant
.
section
119
(
6
)
of
the
Patent
Act
1992
require
that
a
European
patent
designate
Ireland
and
draw
up
in
either
French
or
German
must
have
its
specification
translate
into
English
for
that
patent
to
be
validate
in
Ireland
.
it
be
necessary
to
delete
section
119
(
6
)
and
corresponding
subsection
where
reference
to
this
translation
be
make
in
order
to
give
full
effect
in
we
legislation
to
the
London
agreement
.
in
order
to
assess
the
implication
for
Irish
inventor
and
business
,
my
Department
carry
out
a
regulatory
impact
assessment
of
the
London
agreement
in
2009
.
it
conclude
that
the
main
advantage
of
the
agreement
for
Irish
inventor
seek
patent
protection
abroad
be
that
they
would
no
long
be
require
to
furnish
translation
to
the
extent
currently
require
in
that
country
which
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
.
this
would
lead
to
significant
savings
when
filing
in
other
non-English
language
European
state
.
Translation
cost
,
publication
fee
and
patent
attorney
fee
would
be
reduce
,
with
the
great
save
on
translation
cost
.
for
example
in
2007
,
there
be
126
European
patent
grant
originate
from
Ireland
.
twenty
-
eight
state
be
designate
and
the
total
cost
of
translation
to
protect
the
patent
be
estimate
at
€
6
million
,
a
significant
cost
to
industry
.
this
figure
do
not
include
the
filing
and
publication
fee
to
the
national
office
or
patent
attorney
's
fee
.
the
London
agreement
be
a
optional
agreement
and
to
date
16
country
have
sign
it
.
however
,
we
accession
to
the
agreement
should
encourage
other
member
state
to
accede
,
thereby
reduce
further
the
cost
for
Irish
inventor
when
file
in
other
non-English
language
European
state
.
the
more
member
involve
,
the
great
the
benefit
to
European
business
.
I
see
the
Bill
as
just
the
first
step
in
reduce
the
burden
of
cost
involve
in
protect
patent
internationally
.
on
the
European
Union
front
,
we
be
work
with
other
member
state
towards
the
creation
of
unitary
patent
protection
that
will
have
the
effect
of
reduce
the
cost
of
registration
and
enforcement
of
patent
for
business
.
the
commission
's
proposal
for
a
single
EU
patent
have
be
under
discussion
for
over
50
year
and
we
be
finally
see
some
progress
.
at
the
EU
Competitiveness
Council
in
March
of
this
year
the
Council
authorise
the
use
of
the
enhance
co-operation
procedure
for
the
creation
of
unitary
patent
protection
in
that
member
state
that
wish
to
join
.
Ireland
be
one
of
25
member
state
which
be
forge
ahead
to
achieve
a
simple
,
cheap
and
more
robust
patent
system
in
the
European
Union
that
have
elude
we
of
decade
.
this
measure
,
when
fully
implement
,
will
enable
Irish
-
base
holder
of
patent
to
seek
protection
for
they
patent
across
the
25
member
state
support
the
unitary
patent
protection
—
represent
79
%
of
the
territory
of
the
European
Union
—
for
a
fraction
of
current
cost
.
the
commission
estimate
that
by
implement
unitary
patent
protection
,
the
overall
savings
to
European
business
could
reach
€
50
million
per
year
,
even
in
the
early
stage
.
this
cost
reduction
should
particularly
benefit
Irish
start
-
up
firm
and
small
business
.
when
fully
implement
,
this
measure
will
facilitate
a
big
reduction
in
cost
and
red
tape
which
will
provide
a
stimulus
for
European
innovation
and
make
patent
more
accessible
to
all
company
in
the
European
Union
.
enact
the
Bill
,
combine
with
we
accession
to
the
London
agreement
,
will
remove
the
current
expensive
translation
requirement
which
be
likely
to
lead
to
Ireland
be
designate
in
more
patent
application
and
to
more
patent
-
related
activity
in
Ireland
.
it
be
expect
that
more
inventor
and
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
currently
deter
from
register
patent
because
of
the
high
cost
involve
,
will
be
attract
to
protect
they
intellectual
property
across
Europe
.
this
will
further
support
Ireland
's
effort
to
generate
economic
growth
through
promote
and
innovate
good
process
and
product
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
I
thank
all
of
the
Deputy
who
have
contribute
to
the
debate
.
some
have
be
pertinent
to
the
legislation
before
we
,
other
arguably
not
so
.
I
will
seek
to
address
the
point
that
be
raise
in
regard
to
the
legislation
itself
.
as
a
aside
,
there
be
only
one
deputy
Finian
McGrath
and
one
could
not
patent
he
if
one
try
.
I
will
start
with
the
point
raise
about
the
UK
patent
box
regime
and
the
royalty
exemption
and
other
relief
that
be
suggest
by
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
and
also
the
point
raise
by
deputy
Donohoe
.
that
be
be
consider
at
present
under
the
budgetary
process
.
I
note
the
point
,
which
be
well
make
,
and
we
should
hear
more
about
it
anon
.
we
be
talk
about
innovation
,
utilise
human
capital
and
allow
for
where
someone
who
be
creative
and
have
a
idea
that
become
the
subject
of
a
patent
to
have
as
easy
as
possible
a
transition
of
that
idea
to
commercialisation
.
the
London
agreement
would
facilitate
that
process
through
the
translation
arrangement
.
that
be
really
what
we
be
talk
about
in
this
context
.
the
propose
change
in
the
legislation
would
result
in
a
modest
loss
of
revenue
to
the
Patent
Office
in
term
of
fee
for
translation
.
in
the
context
of
this
country
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
,
a
applicant
must
lodge
a
translation
in
the
office
within
six
month
of
grant
of
the
patent
together
with
a
fee
of
€
35
.
in
2010
that
come
to
€
33,215
.
the
level
of
renewal
fee
be
likely
to
increase
if
we
accede
to
the
agreement
and
it
be
likely
that
owe
to
the
lack
of
translation
requirement
,
this
country
will
be
designate
in
more
patent
application
to
the
European
Patent
Office
,
EPO
.
on
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
on
the
protection
system
,
the
unitary
patent
protection
system
will
address
the
excessive
cost
in
Europe
.
that
be
without
question
.
the
feasibility
of
the
international
content
clear
centre
,
which
be
raise
by
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
currently
under
examination
by
a
group
from
my
Department
which
include
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
.
there
be
a
process
under
way
in
respect
of
that
project
.
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
raise
point
on
the
physical
manifestation
of
the
patent
invention
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
direction
patent
application
be
take
worldwide
be
that
of
a
electronic
on
-
line
application
,
but
I
would
like
to
hear
more
from
deputy
Murphy
on
this
one
,
perhaps
at
a
late
stage
and
even
on
committee
stage
.
we
can
address
this
further
if
necessary
in
a
more
substantive
sense
.
the
question
of
tax
relief
on
patent
royalty
be
currently
under
review
in
advance
of
the
next
budget
,
and
that
should
address
deputy
Mitchell
O'Connor
's
point
on
the
UK
regime
.
there
be
many
other
point
raise
.
deputy
O'Dea
ask
when
the
EU
patent
will
come
into
effect
and
about
the
current
position
.
the
concept
of
the
EU
patent
,
previously
community
patent
,
be
to
provide
a
patent
system
that
will
be
affordable
,
especially
for
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
will
provide
automatic
patent
coverage
in
all
member
state
of
the
European
Union
.
as
deputy
O'Dea
point
out
,
as
protract
negotiation
over
many
year
fail
to
reach
agreement
on
the
EU
patent
,
the
Commission
have
request
to
examine
the
possibility
of
bring
a
proposal
under
enhance
co-operation
whereby
unitary
patent
protection
apply
to
this
member
state
willing
to
participate
will
be
introduce
.
so
far
,
25
out
of
the
27
member
state
of
the
EU
have
indicate
a
willingness
to
take
part
and
the
commission
envisage
that
the
first
unitary
patent
protection
will
issue
in
2013
.
as
be
the
case
normally
with
any
European
initiative
,
I
would
not
be
hold
to
that
timeframe
.
I
thank
the
Member
for
they
contribution
to
the
debate
.
in
my
introductory
speech
,
I
set
out
the
rationale
for
the
propose
patent
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
and
outline
the
financial
burden
on
industry
in
provide
the
full
translation
of
the
European
patent
to
ensure
full
protection
of
the
patent
across
Europe
.
I
also
state
that
this
translation
be
rarely
consult
and
,
as
such
,
offer
little
or
no
advantage
,
either
to
the
patent
holder
or
user
of
the
system
.
it
be
imperative
,
both
from
a
Irish
and
European
perspective
,
that
business
be
not
hamper
by
a
system
that
be
inefficient
and
costly
.
access
to
a
cost
-
effective
and
efficient
patent
system
be
key
to
stimulate
innovation
.
under
the
current
regime
,
the
high
cost
of
translate
grant
patent
act
as
a
deterrent
to
business
and
as
a
consequence
,
be
a
deterrent
to
innovation
.
currently
,
more
than
50
%
of
all
enterprise
in
Ireland
continue
to
engage
in
considerable
research
and
development
activity
in
spite
of
the
difficult
economic
environment
.
it
be
vital
that
they
innovation
be
capture
and
exploit
in
the
good
way
possible
.
a
patent
system
in
which
user
have
limited
access
due
to
high
translation
cost
do
not
serve
this
purpose
and
the
cost
savings
from
the
London
agreement
should
have
a
positive
effect
on
research
and
development
,
allow
for
resource
save
on
translation
to
be
reallocate
to
further
research
and
development
and
other
business
activity
.
that
be
the
kernel
of
this
legislation
.
I
hope
deputy
Clare
Daly
,
who
speak
about
taxation
of
corporate
,
get
the
point
of
this
legislation
.
it
be
about
be
able
to
facilitate
that
who
be
innovator
,
that
who
be
Irish
who
want
to
get
out
into
other
market
and
who
have
idea
.
we
facilitate
that
process
by
implement
the
London
agreement
so
that
we
can
make
that
passage
as
easy
as
possible
for
young
people
,
for
researcher
and
for
industry
.
I
hope
this
do
not
sound
patronising
.
I
suggest
that
every
member
of
this
House
,
if
they
have
a
opportunity
to
do
so
,
should
engage
with
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
,
IDA
Ireland
and
all
of
we
academic
institution
to
delve
into
,
and
inform
themselves
of
,
the
interaction
between
research
,
intellectual
property
copyright
and
the
innovation
and
commercialisation
take
place
.
I
have
undergyne
such
a
education
process
.
every
day
one
learn
more
about
this
field
.
before
member
come
into
the
House
and
make
sweeping
statement
about
taxation
of
innovation
,
they
should
be
well
inform
about
the
process
.
I
say
that
respectfully
and
in
a
debate
manner
in
the
spirit
in
which
we
debate
this
issue
in
the
House
.
it
be
not
mean
as
a
personal
statement
to
any
one
person
in
particular
.
we
should
be
careful
about
the
language
we
use
in
implement
legislation
.
this
be
technical
legislation
.
that
be
all
it
be
.
it
be
to
the
common
good
.
there
be
some
contention
that
it
may
not
be
,
but
I
argue
forcefully
that
it
be
to
the
common
good
ultimately
and
it
will
be
beneficial
to
this
country
.
the
more
country
that
sign
up
to
the
agreement
,
the
great
the
save
will
be
across
Europe
.
in
essence
,
by
even
one
country
join
up
,
the
savings
be
significant
.
it
have
be
estimate
that
since
the
entry
into
force
of
the
London
agreement
in
2008
,
on
average
savings
of
38
%
on
translation
cost
have
be
achieve
.
the
result
speak
for
themselves
.
that
be
what
we
be
try
to
achieve
here
today
.
on
some
other
point
raise
,
the
Patent
Office
run
business
seminar
across
the
country
aim
at
sme
,
start
-
up
and
entrepreneur
,
and
this
seminar
be
entitle
,
"
Building
a
business
on
you
idea
"
.
that
be
a
pertinent
point
.
it
speak
to
the
issue
of
innovation
and
how
ordinary
people
can
become
involved
in
the
process
if
they
have
idea
,
and
there
be
a
excellent
programme
,
through
the
Patent
Office
,
that
seek
to
achieve
that
.
the
seminar
include
talk
on
all
element
of
intellectual
property
,
ip
,
how
to
identify
ip
within
a
business
and
how
to
protect
it
.
they
also
provide
talk
on
State
support
to
industry
and
they
be
extremely
useful
.
on
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
,
the
number
of
patent
application
,
originate
in
Ireland
,
to
the
European
patent
Office
be
510
in
2010
,
a
slight
increase
from
498
in
2009
.
the
late
figure
for
patent
filing
in
2010
rank
Ireland
14th
of
the
38
country
in
the
European
patent
organisation
and
we
rank
23rd
in
the
patent
Cooperation
Treaty
international
ranking
which
cover
most
country
worldwide
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
make
the
point
that
the
number
of
national
patent
application
be
not
a
indicator
of
patent
activity
in
Ireland
.
in
Ireland
,
many
of
the
multinational
company
,
which
employ
thousand
and
which
undertake
and
fund
major
research
and
development
here
,
patent
they
product
on
a
global
level
.
patent
application
submit
by
large
multinational
organisation
in
the
Unite
State
,
for
example
,
would
not
show
Ireland
as
the
source
of
the
application
or
that
the
research
and
development
have
be
carry
out
in
Ireland
.
it
be
important
to
make
that
point
to
rebut
some
of
what
have
be
say
by
deputy
Clare
Daly
.
there
be
Irish
people
work
in
multinational
corporation
here
,
or
work
within
academic
institution
that
interface
with
that
same
corporation
,
who
be
produce
excellent
work
,
ground
-
breaking
world
-
class
research
base
on
Irish
intellectual
property
which
will
not
necessarily
be
register
as
Irish
,
but
it
be
still
Irish
people
produce
the
intellectual
property
and
that
be
the
most
important
point
.
it
form
the
basis
,
and
underpin
,
thousand
of
job
within
this
economy
.
it
be
important
to
send
out
a
more
positive
message
in
term
of
what
this
legislation
be
about
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer

the
select
sub

on
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
innovation

standing

under

the
Tánaiste
chair
the
new
export
council
which
bring
together
the
focus
of
this
work
.
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
be
engage
in
develop
trading
opportunity
in
emerge
economy
through
the
negotiation
of
free
-
trade
agreement
between
the
EU
and
third
country
and
improve
opportunity
for
exporter
can
also
emerge
from
reduction
in
tariff
and
non-tariff
barrier
through
trade
and
regulatory
discussion
between
the
EU
and
China
,
Russia
and
Brazil
.
to
answer
the
question
,
it
be
a
ongoing
process
and
one
must
speak
to
the
figure
.
between
2004
and
2010
,
merchandise
export
from
Ireland
to
Brazil
,
Russia
,
India
and
China
rise
by
approximately
122
%
and
in
the
same
period
service
export
to
that
country
rise
by688
%
.
another
key
example
of
this
success
be
the
fact
that
Ireland
now
have
a
significant
trade
surplus
with
China
,
which
be
a
dramatic
turnaround
from
the
position
only
four
year
previously
when
we
have
a
deficit
of
approximately
€
2.9
billion
.
I
understand
that
for
the
year
to
date
export
have
increase
by
approximately
6
%
—
—
the
overall
year
to
date
figure
show
a
increase
from
last
year
and
export
from
indigenous
industry
have
increase
by
approximately
10
%
.
the
omen
be
good
on
the
export
side
.
the
creation
of
the
export
trade
council
,
which
arise
from
the
trade
,
tourism
and
investment
strategy
,
signal
a
clear
intention
by
the
government
,
as
per
the
programme
for
government
,
to
drive
export
even
further
in
the
country
I
mention
early
.
the
new
council
's
membership
include
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Leo
Varadkar
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
and
senior
representative
from
the
relevant
agency
and
Department
.
this
derive
from
a
previous
policy
which
be
borne
out
of
common
sense
and
will
continue
.
there
be
great
emphasis
,
and
the
figure
bear
this
out
,
to
drive
export
in
the
so
-
call
BRIC
country
.
on
29
September
last
,
the
establishment
of
NewERA
be
announce
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
Minister
of
State
Fergus
O'Dowd
,
who
have
special
responsibility
for

the
government
take
the
decision
to
establish
NewERA
to
reform
the
manner
in
which
government
manage
its
shareholding
in
the
semi-State
company
.
it
be
one
of
the
key
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
and
be
central
to
we
plan
for
investment
.
NewERA
will
initially
be
establish
on
a
non-statutory
basis
as
a
shareholder
executive
within
the
NTMA
.
it
will
have
responsibility
for
review
capital
investment
plan
of
the
commercial
semi-State
company
from
a
shareholder
perspective
and
will
identify
possible
synergy
between
investment
programme
of
different
State
company
.
the
company
in
question
be
the
ESB
,
Bord
Gáis
,
EirGrid
,
Bord
to
Móna
and
Coillte
.
the
decision
to
establish
NewERA
be
a
important
element
in
the
government
's
strategy
to
create
job
and
promote
economic
growth
.
the
operation
of
NewERA
will
be
overseen
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
economic
infrastructure
,
of
which
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
a
member
.
the
government
be
do
everything
it
can
to
create
job
and
improve
Irish
infrastructure
.
part
of
this
be
to
ensure
that
critical
infrastructure
be
put
in
place
to
allow
enterprise
to
grow
now
and
in
the
future
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
which
arise
in
traditional
and
emerge
sector
.
the
fact
that
deputy
Fergus
O'Dowd
be
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
NewERA
be
incidental
in
term
of
this
be
a
whole
government
approach
to
the
issue
.
we
should
not
underestimate
the
fact
that
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
on
the
cabinet
sub
-committee
.
there
be
a
corporate
view
at
government
level
between
the
two
party
of
government
of
the
need
to
ensure
we
have
a
entity
that
will
carry
out
a
corporate
governance
function
from
a
shareholder
perspective
and
that
will
report
to
the
relevant
minister
and
be
overseen
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
economic
infrastructure
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
it
be
a
whole
of
government
approach
.
through
NewERA
,
the
government
be
take
control
of
the
infrastructure
as
per
the
semi-State
company
involve
.
regard
the
second
part
of
the
question
on
the
job
target
,
the
key
emphasis
be
to
ensure
we
get
it
up
and
run
.
we
must
get
the
key
strategic
infrastructure
fund
in
place
through
the
NPRF
and
we
must
become
more
efficient
in
term
of
how
we
run
this
company
.
infrastructure
be
the
key
at
this
point
.
there
be
a
commitment
in
line
with
obligation
to
the
troika
in
respect
of
non-strategic
state
asset
.
deputy
O'Dea
be
aware
of
why
we
be
in
that
position
.
the
key
issue
be
that
,
follow
the
appropriate
legislative
change
,
resource
will
be
channel
from
the
NPRF
to
productive
investment
.
we
be
talk
about
productive
investment
in
the
Irish
economy
.
I
realise
there
may
not
be
a
specific
target
of
a
number
of
job
.
although
one
of
the
party
in
government
set
out
a
specific
target
as
part
of
its
manifesto
,
there
be
a
programme
for
government
and
a
clear
convergence
in
term
of
what
both
party
be
try
to
achieve
.
we
must
be
mindful
of
target
and
ensure
we
have
a
efficient
organisation
in
NewERA
to
manage
infrastructure
and
investment
in
partnership
with
the
NPRF
,
use
the
strategic
infrastructure
fund
,
which
will
be
the
forerunner
to
the
strategic
infrastructure
bank
.
discussion
with
the
troika
be
ongoing
this
week
in
respect
of
the
issue
.
we
be
ensure
that
we
can
leverage
state
asset
to
create
job
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
have
a
political
philosophical
view
on
sell
state
asset
that
must
be
respect
but
there
be
a
process
of
engagement
with
the
troika
in
which
commitment
be
give
by
this
government
,
which
be
sovereign
.
we
be
not
go
to
disavow
that
commitment
but
,
as
a
government
,
we
be
in
the
business
of
seek
to
ensure
we
can
get
out
of
this
economic
morass
.
the
sale
of
state
asset
be
one
mechanism
by
which
we
can
do
this
.
we
want
to
create
a
efficient
tool
call
NewERA
so
we
can
ensure
that
we
can
leverage
the
asset
to
create
job
.
I
cannot
give
a
exact
answer
of
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
for
the
number
of
job
we
can
create
.
the
asset
will
be
use
in
a
way
that
seek
to
leverage
they
to
create
job
and
we
have
not
maximise
the
potential
of
that
State
asset
heretofore
.
my
Department
recently
carry
out
a
public
consultation
in
regard
to
this
matter
.
the
consultation
document
set
out
the
background
to
the
matter
arise
from
the
judgment

by
Mr.

.
however
,
in
the
judgment
refer
to
,
Mr.

hold
that

the
consultation
document
indicate
that
it
be
consider
necessary
to
restate
Ireland

in
propose

conscious
of
the

of
online
content
and

do
the

why

speak

I

the

will
give
we
the
usual
diatribe
about
the
state
of
the

and
he
political
view
.
why
do
the

not
talk
about
the

we
?
the

should
give
we
a
critique

,
as
he
see
it
.
be
that
not
laudable
?
