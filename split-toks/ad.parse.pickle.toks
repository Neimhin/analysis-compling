the

of
this

be
that
the
2007
version
of
the
Bill
,
in

7
(

,
set
forth
a
minimum
fine
on

of
€
10000
for
fine
set
prior
to
the
commencement
date
.
this
have
disappear
from
the
Bill
,
although
it
seem
a
appropriate
provision
to
maintain
the
hierarchy
of
penalty
between
summary
conviction
and
conviction
on
indictment
.
we
suggest
that
this
be
re-insert
.
I
will
not
delay
proceedings
except
to
say
that
I
agree
with
the
tenor
and
tone
of
the
amendment
tab
by
the
minister
.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
legislation
be
to
ensure
that
people
who
be
not
criminal
but
who
transgress
or
make
mistake
will
not
be
imprison
as
a
result
of
not
pay
fine
.
the
legislation
be
also
design
to
put
in
place
a
process
to
ensure
that
people
will
have
every
avenue
open
to
they
in
order
that
they
might
pay
fine
.
will
the
minister
clarify
the
position
with
regard
to
people
's
financial
circumstance
?
do
I
understand
that
there
be
some
degree
of
sympathy
for
person
who
may
have
transgress
and
who
might
find
themselves
subject
to
fine
?
will
the
new
process
take
into
account
a
individual
's
inability
to
pay
in
the
context
of
both
they
outgoing
and
they
overall
earnings
?
the
minister
refer
,
in
some
sympathy
,
to
person
who
may
have
unintentionally
transgress
and
indicate
that
,
for
obvious
reason
,
he
want
to
keep
they
out
of
prison
.
be
it
the
case
that
a
appoint
receiver
will
be
in
a
position
to
recover
property
from
someone
who
do
not
pay
a
fine
?
the
amendment
before
the
House
improve
the
legislation
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
citizen
must
be
give
every
means
and
opportunity
possible
to
pay
fine
and
avoid
prison
.
in
addition
,
the
legislation
must
contain
a
mechanism
which
ensure
that
no
one
will
take
advantage
of
any
perceive
softening
in
the
approach
of
put
in
place
a
system
of
fine
in
the
first
instance
.
I
welcome
the
amendment
.
I
presume
the
clock
start
now
.
on
the
recovery
order
in
section
16
,
subsection
2
state
:
"
before
make
a
recovery
order
,
the
court
shall
conduct
a
inquiry
into
the
financial
circumstance
of
the
person
who
have
fail
to
pay
the
fine
concerned
and
may
require
the
person
to
provide
the
court
with
such
information
as
it
may
specify

to
that
circumstance
.
"
although
I
be
not

specifically
to
the
amendment
we
be
deal
with

I
wish
to
give
notice
that

that
all

a

that

's
outgoing
should
potentially
be
take
into
account
also
in
adjudicate
on
the
issue
before
go
to
a
recovery
order
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
a
person
who
be
not
a
serial
offender
or
a
hardy
perennial
before
the
court
,
and
who
may
have
transgress
but
who
ordinarily
be
a
very
good
citizen
,
would
have
every
opportunity
to
pay
the
fine
if
they
do
not
have
the
means
immediately
at

disposal
.
I
would
like
to
get
further
clarity
on
that
.
I

.
I
take
on
board
what
the
minister
have
say
.
this
amendment
seek
to
ensure
a
sense
of
appropriateness
in
each
individual
case
.
I
be
satisfied
that
the
minister
's
position
on
this
amendment
have
already
be
deal
with
by
the
early
amendment
.
therefore
I
intend
to
withdraw
the
amendment
.
I
be
not
against
the
amendment
per
se
,
but
it
state
that
the
Court
Service
''
may
''
from
time
to
time
,
publish
in
such
a
manner
as
it
consider
appropriate
,
include
on
the
Internet
,
a
list
of
the
name
and
address
of
person
who
have
fail
to
pay
fine
impose
on
they
by
the
due
date
of
payment
.
I
assume
,
since
the
word
''
may
''
be
use
that
there
be
no
obligation
on
the
Court
service
to
publish
the
name
.
without
be
sarcastic
,
when
somebody
present
himself
or
herself
before
the
court
,
there
be
a
good
chance
the
court
reporter
from
the
Corkman
or
the
Leitrim
Observer
or
any
other
local
newspaper
will
publish
the
person
's
name
in
the
follow
edition
.
I
suggest
the
person
concerned
will
have
be
subject
to
enough
embarrassment
through
that
.
there
may
be
circumstance
where
this
impose
another
administrative
cost
on
the
Court
service
.
I
do
not
think
the
minister
have
set
out
how
much
this
will
cost
to
administer
.
by
virtue
of
use
of
the
word
''
may
''
,
I
wonder
if
it
will
ever
be
use
at
all
.
that
be
a
question
,
by
the
way
.
I
support
this
Bill

should
have
the
effect
of

culture

that
everyone
who
get
behind

to

behaviour

we
need
to
modify
how
we
,
as
a
society
,
deal
with
the
issue
of
alcohol
and
the
only
way
to
achieve
this
objective
be
to

,
I
have
the
great
respect
for
the
previous
speaker
,
deputy
Christy
O'Sullivan
.
I
,
too
,
be
only
too
well
aware
of
the
condition
experience
by
rural
dweller
who
be
frequently
disadvantage
by
virtue
of
they
rural
isolation
and
experience
a
lack
of
access
to
service
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
listen
to
government
deputy
deplore
the
state
of
rural
road
and
the
problem
of
rural
isolation
.
if
people
be
to
have
access
to
the
service
they
will
require
as
a
result
of
the
measure
provide
for
in
the
Bill
,
we
must
ensure
ancillary
service
be
in
place
to
meet
they
demand
and
need
.
for
instance
,
in
my
area

withdraw

which
serve
a
rural
area
and
individual

in

they
include
old
people
who
travel
to
town
such
as
Fermoy
,
Ballyhooly
and
Castletownroche
to
enjoy
a
drop
before
take
a
bus
home
late
in
the
evening
.
many
of
this
people
do
not
drive
and
will
no
long
have
access
to
the
service
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
close
the
route
.
this
problem
be
a
function
of
government
policy
because
a
ancillary
rural
transport
programme
be
not
in
place
to
pick
up
the
slack
arise
from
the
loss
of
the
service

in
particular
,
a
night
time

service
be
not
in
place
to
facilitate
that
who
want
to
act
responsibility
but
be
unable
to
avail
of
a
bus
service
.
government
policy
militate
against
the
very
people
who
experience
rural
isolation
.
we
need
to
be
clear
about
the
implication
of
the
legislation
.
if
we
support
the
Bill
on
the
basis
that
driver
behaviour
must
change
significantly
,
we
must
also
take
into
account
that
some
people
,
by
virtue
of
reside
in
rural
area
and
decide
to
behave
responsibly
as
require
under
the
legislation
,
will
no
long
have
access
to
the
local
pub
.
current
policy
do
not
meet
they
need
.
if
Bus
Éireann
drop
route
at
a
rate
of
knot
and
the
rural
transport
programme
be
not
roll
out
quickly
enough
to
pick
up
the
slack
,
particularly
with
regard
to
night
time
service
,
that
who
live
in
the
rural
area
obviously
will
be
affect
.
this
issue
need
to
be
tease
out
in
great
detail
.
on
the
commencement
of
the
section
which
will
become
operational
before
mid-2011
,
I
refer
to
the
Bills
digest
produce
by
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
unit
.
it
state
:
.
.
.
different
section
may
become
operational
before
other
.
some
of
the
provision
of
the
Bill
will
not
come
into
force
until

what
be
the
current
state
of
play
with
regard
to
the
Garda
's
capacity
to
recalibrate
the
ebt
machine
as
require
?
I
understand
the
legislation
reduce
blood
alcohol
limit
and
introduce
mandatory
alcohol
testing
for
driver
who
be
involved
in
traffic
collision
as
well
as
roadside

to
detect

who
be

one
would
expect
the
government
to
have
ensure
all
necessary
technology
be
available
prior
to
or
in
parallel
with
the
implementation
of
the
legislation
.
will
the
minister
provide
a
update
on
the
Garda
's
capacity
to
use
the
require
technology
?
on
road
collision
statistic
,
while
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
I
have
a
healthy
scepticism
about
some
of
the
statistic
produce
on
road
traffic
accident
.
the
government
have
state
its
commitment
to
improve
road
safety
and
the
number
of
death
on
Irish
road
decline
to
240
in
2009
.
it
be
estimate
that
25
%
of
road
accident
and
33
%
of
fatal
road
accident
be
attributable
to
alcohol
.
I
often
wonder
how
such
statistic
be
measure
and
what
process
be
use
by
the
Road
Safety
Authority
or
Garda
Síochána
to
produce
they
statistic
,
particularly
that
relate
to
road
fatality
.
I
be
not
sceptical
about
the
figure
but
I
question
the
qualitative
method
use
to
compile
the
statistic
use
for
make
a
argument
for
a
particular
proposal
.
I
ask
for
a
response
in
that
regard
.
I
welcome
the
provision
on
new
driver
.
we
cannot
disregard
the
link
between
driver
impairment
and
alcohol
consumption
.
it
have
be
prove
scientifically
and
be
support
by
anecdotal
evidence
.
common
sense
say
that
if
a
person
imbib
,
they
ability
to
operate
a
machine
or
vehicle
will
be
impair
.
the
Vintner
's
Federation
of
Ireland
oppose
the
reduction
in
the
limit
and
I
can
see
its
point
.
Anecdotal
evidence
suggest
that
they
regular
rural
customer
might
drink
a
pint
and
a
drop
before
amble
home
.
they
never
go
beyond
they
usual
level
of
imbibing
,
which
be
a
social
outlet
for
they
.
we
must
be
able
to
provide
for
that
who
use
the
pub
as
a
social
outlet
.
if
they
be
not
able
to
drive
,
how
will
we
facilitate
they
?
some
of
they
will
be
able
to
get
taxi
while
other
will
travel
with
neighbour
.
however
,
do
we
now
have
to
tell
they
that
there
be
no
other
alternative
?
in
implement
the
legislation
,
we
need
to
strike
a
balance
and
speak
for
that
people
as
well
.
the
section
create
a
distinction
between
newly
qualified
and
other
full
licence
holder
.
Novice

a

other

can
the
Minister
of
State
clarify
if
this
be
a
age
-
related
distinction
,
or
do
it
merely
distinguish
between
novice
and
experienced
driver
?
be
any
qualification
bring
into
play
concern
a
old
person
who
may
have
transgress
?
it
be
not
that
I
be
advocate
a
particular
position
on
that
,
but
I
be
seek
clarification
in
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
on
balance
we
be
experience
a
serious
erosion
of
service
in
rural
area
.
some
argue
that
the
decline
of
the
rural
pub
reflect
a
decline
in
overall
infrastructure
,
particularly
road
.
as
someone
who
meet
member
of
the
public
every
day
,
I
hold
that
view
myself
,
because
they
be
find
it
increasingly
difficult
to
access
service
.
that
be
particularly
the
case
for
old
people
.
I
would
distinguish
between
old
and
elderly
people
,
because
the
use
of
the
word
"
elderly
"
sometimes
imply
a
certain
infirmity
.
many
old
people
be
mobile
,
although
they
may
not
drive
.
we
always
have
a
sense
of
inter-generational
solidarity
in
this
country
,
but
it
be
be
undermine
by
stealth
.
when
draft
legislation
we
must
,
therefore
,
ensure
that
if
it
impact
on
one
service
we
should
try
to
replace
it
with
another
service
if
possible
.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
ensure
that
life
be
save
and
one
cannot
qualify
that
.
while
it
be
a
black
and
white
issue
,
there
be
grey
area
where
some
public
service
will
be
diminish
.
government
policy
on
rural
transport
should
be
structure
in
such
a
way
that
people
can
access
community
centre
or
pub
outside
normal
office
hour
if
they
wish
to
do
so

we

at
yesterday
's
meeting
of
the
agriculture
committee
,
a
motion
be
put
before
it
concern
the
Lost
at
Sea
scheme
and
a
decision
be
take
on
the
ombudsman
's
report
.
the
Labour
Party
have
circulate
a
motion
for
the
House
to
seek
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
would
discuss
this
matter
.
the
House
have
the
power
to
refer
it
to
the
committee
in
a
bid
to
seek
that
a
report
be
send
back
to
the
House
by
a
set
date
.
I
be
ask
that
the
Ombudsman
be
afford
a
opportunity
to
present
she
finding
on
the
Lost
at
Sea
scheme
.
she
have
not
be
afford
such
a
opportunity
to
date
.
yesterday
's
vote
by
the
committee
deny
she
that
opportunity
,
but
we
be
seek
to
table
the
matter
before
the
wide
House
so
as
that
the
Oireachtas
allow
she
a
opportunity
.
it
be
vital
—
—
the
motion
will
be
tab
before
the
House
.
the
issue
be
whether
the
House
will
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
the
recommendation
in
the
ombudsman
's
report
have
be
reject
.
this
be
a
serious
matter
.
if
the
House
decide
that
it
will
reject
a
report
place
before
it
,
then
—
—
it
be
a
serious
matter
.
I
be
ask
whether
it
could
be
take
—
—
—
—
on
government
time
.
it
be
a
important
matter
and
I
be
ask
that
it
be
take
during
government
time
.
on
the
same
issue
,
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
matter
,
which
be
apolitical
—
—
the
fact
remain
that
,
if
any
citizen
of
the
State
make
a
complaint
,
he
or
she
will
have
no
confidence
that
the
complaint
will
be
hear
—
—
——
if
the
report
be
reject
.

on
a
point
of
order
—
—
with
all
due
respect
,
I
indicate
on
this
issue
.
there
be
a
motion
before
the
House
and
all
the
Labour
Party
want
be
to
provide
the
ombudsman
with
a
opportunity
to
present
the
finding
of
she
report
before
a
designate
committee
,
preferably
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
that
be
on
the
Order
Paper
and
we
be
ask
that
there
be
some
degree
of
common
sense
in
term
of
how
this
be
approach
.
we
do
not
want
further
statement
in
the
dáil
on
this
matter
and
,
as
deputy
Gilmore
say
,
it
can
be
do
without
debate
if
we
facilitate
the
person
in
question
.
that
be
all
we
be
ask
.
it
be
a
very
reasonable
request
and
it
be
all
we
be
ask
.
I
note
what
the
Taoiseach
have
say
about
the
Ombudsman
's
act
be
silent
on
the
matter
.
again
,
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
Taoiseach
allow
the
Ombudsman
a
opportunity
to
present
she
finding
.
I
believe
that
be
a
reasonable
approach
.
this
can
be
do
in
a
non-partisan
way
.
I
be
sure
this
House
could
facilitate
such
a
process
.
I
support
the
amendment
on
the
basis
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Health
and
Children
report
on
primary
care
publish
last
month
.
there
be
a
view
that
the
primary
care
strategy
will
be
vital
in
term
of
health
care
provision
in
the
future
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
primary
care
centre
should
be
license
by
the
HSE
and
subject
to
the
rule
of
HIQA
.
if
one
adhere
to
the
goal
in
the
primary
care
strategy
,
one
would
encourage
more
people
to
be
treat
in
primary
care
centre
and
move
away
from
accident
and
emergency
centre
.
if
more
people
be
to
be
treat
in
primary
care
centre
,
then
it
be
obvious
that
we
need
more
such
centre
and
,
therefore
,
one
must
provide
some
degree
of
stimulus
to
bring
about
more
of
they
.
I
be
aware
of
one
such
centre
in
north
Cork
which
will
bring
together
approximately
17
general
practitioner
.
the
HSE
have
buy
in
as
a
active
stakeholder
in
that
process
and
the
PCCC
,
primary
,
community
and
continue
care
,
programme
will
arise
from
the
process
.
there
be
beneficial
social
outcome
as
a
result
of
facilitate
specific
relief
by
regulation
.
I
anticipate
the
minister
will
speak
to
the
issue
of
property
-
base
relief
and
there
be
general
agreement
in
respect
of
they
future
.
however
,
specific
relief
can
be
make
in
respect
of
capital
investment
or
equipment
.
we
must
be
far
-
reach
in
this
regard
.
I
admire
the
wording
put
forward
because
it
allow
the
minister
a
degree
of
latitude
.
we
should
consider
the
amendment
laterally
and
take
a
lateral
view
of
how
we
proceed
with
primary
care
centre
,
which
the
amendment
facilitate
.
it
take
a
regime
change
.
may
I
tease
out
the
figure
that
the
minister
place
before
we
and
seek
a
clarification
on
the
number
of
contract
that
be
under
negotiation
presently
?
I
may
have
misheard
the
minister
.
I
think
she
state
30
be
under
negotiation
.
I
want
to
get
a
more
qualitative
analysis
of
the
present
state
of
negotiation
.
the
reason
I
ask
that
be
because
I
believe
it
be
pertinent
to
the
amendment
.
the
current
state
of
negotiation
could
be
influence
by
whether
or
not
further
stimulus
be
give
to
primary
care
centre
that
may
be
under
negotiation
presently
or
that
person
may
be
think
of
set
up
where
they
may
have
start
cursory
negotiation
with
the
HSE
or
the
Department
of
Health
and
Children
.
give
the
present
state
of
the
economy
,
the
state
of
that
negotiation
will
be
predicate
on
whether
there
be
a
stimulus
provide
and
a
amendment
such
as
this
will
definitely
have
a
influence
in
bring
more
of
they
to
fruition
.
that
would
be
my
party
's
view
.
I
listen
with
interest
to
the
argument
put
forward
by
Government
deputy
,
particularly
from
the
Green
Party
Member
from
Carlow
,
because
I
never
hear
such
patronising
drivel
in
all
my
life
.
to
suggest
that
we
be
give
business
a
false
hope
by
bring
forward
this
Bill
reflect
the
unreality
of
Green
Party
Deputy
.
this
legislation
try
to
find
positive
solution
to
the
real
problem
that
people
face
in
village
,
town
and
city
throughout
the
country
because
they
cannot
renegotiate
they
rent
.
we
be
take
a
realistic
approach
to
the
problem
,
back
by
a
sound
body
of
legal
opinion
.
deputy
Kennedy
's
demand
that
we
put
we
legal
opinion
before
the
House
be
merely
a
digression
from
the
issue
at
hand
.
Fianna
Fáil
and
the
Green
Party
be
aware
that
we
be
offer
a
genuine
solution
but
they
will
not
even
entertain
we
attempt
to
build
a
positive
outcome
.
I
remind
deputy
White
that
the
Bill
seek
to
address
the
emergency
that
have
arise
in
regard
to
upward
-
only
rent
review
and
the
substantial
economic
havoc
that
such
provision
be
wreak
on
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
.
Rent
review
,
which
normally
occur
every
five
year
,
be
result
in
the
wind
up
of
a
large
number
of
company
.
in
many
case
,
liquidator
be
have
to
exercise
special
statutory
power
to
disclaim
onerous
lease
and
the
effective
abandonment
of
business
result
in
substantial
employment
loss
.
this
Bill
attempt
to
find
a
solution
to
this
serious
issue
.
we
be
not
give
anybody
false
hope
when
we
seek
to
find
a
way
to
help
this
business
survive
and
flourish
.
I
do
not
know
if
deputy
White
receive
as
many
e-mail
on
this
issue
as
I
do
.
I
wish
to
share
with
she
one
such
e-mail
I
receive
from
a
lady
in
Mallow
who
operate
a
small
niche
business
call
Fountain
of
Angel
.
her
rent
be
€
8500
per
annum
.
she
tell
I
in
she
e-mail
that
the
upward
-
only
rent
review
clause
be
unfair
and
discriminate
against
tenant
.
it
be
put
she
under
significant
pressure
and
call
into
question
the
viability
of
she
business
.
if
she
try
to
leave
,
however
,
the
landlord
be
entitle
to
pursue
she
for
loss
of
income
for
the
remainder
of
she
lease
,
which
happen
to
have
a
term
of
11
year
.
this
situation
be
not
help
by
auctioneer
who
give
misleading
information
and
it
reflect
every
e-mail
we
have
receive
on
this
issue
.
this
be
a
real
issue
and
it
must
be
deal
with
in
a
real
political
sense
and
that
be
what
we
seek
to
do
tonight
.
other
matter
that
must
be
tackle
include
the
hold
on
legal
opinion
and
the
hold
that
auctioneer
,
landlord
and
property
owner
have
over
people
.
we
should
think
more
laterally
about
how
to
allow
business
to
survive
,
a
purpose
at
the
heart
of
the
Bill
.
the
proposal
be
perfectly
realistic
for
people
who
live
in
the
real
world
.
we
do
not
contend
that
we
be
give
people
false
hope
.
we
be
serious
enough
to
put
forward
a
Bill
of
this
nature
because
we
wish
to
tackle
this
issue
realistically
such
that
we
can
give
small
business
a
opportunity
to
flourish
.
that
be
the
motive
from
which
this
Bill
emanate
.
the
minister
would
be
good
react
to
deputy
Gilmore
's
proposal
.

the
reason
I
ask
the
question
be
because
we
have
a
opportunity
in
this
country
to
phase
out
such
fuel
as
coal
and
they
can
quite
easily
be
replace
by
miscanthus
.
farmer
tell
I
that
the
establishment
cost
be
quite
high
and
that
the
grant
could
be
improve
,
if
possible
,
to
assist
in
that
regard
.
do
I
hear
the
Minister
of
State
correctly
when
he
state
that
he
be
preclude
by
European
Union
rule
from
expand
or
increase
that
level
of
grant
aid
?
I
ask
he
to
expand
on
that
point
.
once
the
crop
have
be
establish
,
be
there
any
scope
to
improve
the
increment
for
weed
control
,
the
control
of
pest
and
also
plough
and
cultivation
?
if
he
be
unable
to
increase
the
grant
for
the
establishment
of
the
crop
,
perhaps
he
could
consider
a
increase
on
the
embed
side
,
if
I
could
use
that
expression
.
will
the
minister
of
State
agree
there
be
many
company
facilitate
farmer
in
establish
the
crop
in
the
first
instance
and
that
the
expertise
exist
?
will
he
acknowledge
the
potential
for
this
crop
and
that
perhaps
the
government
be
under
-
value
the
potential
of
this
crop
in
meet
a
alternative
energy
need
?
will
he
also
acknowledge
that
there
may
be
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
farmer
to
switch
into
this
crop
because
the
scheme
itself
be
understld
?
the
government
need
to
do
a
marketing
job
to
encourage
more
farmer
to
diversify
into
this
crop
,
give
the
level
of
expertise
,
particularly
in
the
east
Cork
and
west
Limerick
region
where
two
company
that
be
market
leader
be
only
itching
to
get
more
farmer
under
they
ambit
but
they
need
a
great
financial
incentive
.
I
be
unsure
whether
the
question
related
to
competition
policy
or
food
labelling
,
but
I
will
address
both
matter
while
I
have
the
opportunity
.
I
appreciate
that
.
will
the
Minster
acknowledge
in
respect
of
food
labelling
that
there
be
no
willingness
on
the
part
of
certain
EU
country
to
proceed
with
a
change
to
the
country
of
origin
label
regime
in
operation
at
present
,
because
it
would
materially
affect
they
trade
and
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
?
if
there
be
a
real
political
initiative
at
EU
level
in
respect
of
this
issue
,
the
Government
and
the
Green
Party
would
be
shouting
about
it
from
the
rooftop
.
let
we
not
be
disingenuous
about
it
.
I
refer
to
the
Competition
Act
.
I
appreciate
the
Spanish
EU
Presidency
be
take
initiative
in
respect
of
this
issue
but
there
be
already
a
considerable
body
of
law
on
the
Irish
Statute
Book
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
the
Competition
Act
2002
,
which
incorporate
the
treaty
on
the
functioning
of
the
EU
,
prohibit
agreement
and
concerted
practice
which
have
as
they
"
object
or
effect
the
prevention
,
restriction
or
distortion
of
competition
in
trade
on
any
goods
"
?
will
the
minister
further
acknowledge
that
upon
the
abolition
of
the
grocery
order
in
December
2005
it
be
state
that
certain
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
non-dominant
undertaking
in
the
grocery
trade
would
effectively
be
legislate
for
—
—
the
dearth
of
legislation
be
cause
the
situation
we
have
at
the
moment
.
have
the
Minister
of
State
a
opinion
on
the
fact
that
the
committee
take
a
unanimous
decision
across
all
of
the
political
party
boundary
and
across
the
political
spectrum
,
and
that
such
decision
be
base
on
hear
a
corpus
of
evidence
from
all
side
?
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
he
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
it
be
a
unanimous
view
,
which
should
be
take
seriously
by
he
in
determine
the
final
outcome
,
and
that
when
the
committee
take
the
view
,
it
do
so
on
the
basis
that
the
aim
of
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
be
not
mutually
exclusive
from
that
of
HSI
and
that
there
would
be
no
threat
to
HSI
by
cede
the
studbook
to
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
——
—
—
I
respect
the
view
of
the
Minister
of
State
but
the
line
minister
be
sit
right
beside
he
.
be
it
in
order
for
I
to
ask
whether
the
senior
minister
in
the
Department
would
have
a
view
on
this
or
would
proffer
a
view
to
the
House
on
this
?
this
be
very
much
a
case
of
"
yes
,
Minister
"
.
I
be
amazed
at
how
we
operate
this
parliament
,
which
need
to
be
seriously
modernise
and
overhaul
.
it
be
ludicrous
.
I
just
have
a
surreal
moment
.
I
feel
I
have
a
bit
-
part
in
"
yes
,
minister
.
"
I
appreciate
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle's
—
—
—
—
weighty
advice
but
we
need
to
speak
to
a
little
bit
of
common
sense
as
well
.
be
there
a
final
position
on
the
EU
's
position
in
term
of
this
negotiation
or
be
there
continuous
bilateral
talk
on
the
Irish
position
at
the
WTO
?
the
decline
in
farm
employment
have
be
stark
.
the
loss
of
employment
in
the
construction
industry
,
as
acknowledge
by
the
minister
,
be
also
have
a
major
bear
on
off
-
farm
employment
.
a
report
by
David
Meredith
of
Teagasc
's
rural
economy
research
centre
in
Kinsealy
,
County
Dublin
,
highlight
that
70
%
of
farmer
record
low
secondary
education
as
they
high
qualification
,
mean
they
be
more
vulnerable
to
a
economic
downturn
.
if
only
6
%
of
farmer
have
a
third
level
degree
,
will
the
minister
agree
more
have
to
be
do
to
encourage
young
farmer
to
up
-
skill
so
if
they
need
a
off
-
farm
income
they
will
have
good
employment
choice
and
still
be
able
to
part
-
time
farm
?
will
he
also
agree
it
be
important
to
provide
proper
resource
to
the
agricultural
college
?
the
rate
of
decline
be
from
115000
in
2008
to
98000
in
2009
.
not
all
of
the
agricultural
college
will
be
able
to
take
up
that
slack
to
re-educate
this
farmer
.
while
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
response
,
he
will
have
to
wide
the
scope
of
the
exist
education
policy
.
in
support
of
deputy
McGinley
's
point
,
will
the
government
extend
a
invitation
as
per
the
Labour
Party
request
to
facilitate
the
ombudsman
in
one
of
the
committee
to
allow
she
to
present
the
finding
in
she
report
?

I
wish
to
start
by
quote
Commissioner
Piebalgs
,
who
state
:
Europe
's
energy
import
dependency
be
forecast
to
reach
64
%
in
2020
.
.
.
that
be
why
the
commission
do
all
it
can
to
improve
European
level
of
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
include
biofuel
.
.
.
this
growth
[
in
greenhouse
gas
emission
]
threaten
to
cancel
out
the
savings
be
make
elsewhere
.
on
present
trend
,
transport
will
account
for
more
than
60
%
of
the
EU
's
increase
in
carbon
dioxide
emission
between
2005
and
2020
.
there
be
a
global
debate
at
the
moment
on
the
scarcity
of
food
supply
.
there
be
that
,
particularly
the
ngo
who
represent
develop
country
,
who
have
rightly
state
that
the
move
towards
bio
-
fuel
production
globally
be
have
a
impact
on
global
food
price
.
the
question
for
we
be
where
we
strike
the
balance
.
give
such
a
high
dependence
on
fossil
fuel
,
we
cannot
detract
from
tackle
that
issue
.
if
we
do
not
take
action
now
,
it
will
have
serious
implication
.
the
Labour
Party
's
view
be
that
while
we
acknowledge
that
the
increase
in
food
price
globally
be
as
a
result
of
the
movement
towards
bio-fuel
,
we
also
acknowledge
that
appropriate
land
use
and
rule
govern
deforestation
would
assist
in
attain
a
great
balance
between
the
two
.
in
essence
we
welcome
the
introduction
of
a
bio
-
fuel
obligation
scheme
.
the
reduction
of
the
target
from
the
5.75
%
reflect
current
economic
reality
.
perhaps
the
right
condition
be
not
in
place
to
reach
that
target
in
the
first
instance
.
the
legislation
before
we
be
a
realistic
attempt
to
try
to
shift
the
focus
from
fossil
fuel
to
alternative
energy
,
which
we
welcome
.
in
establish
a
bio
-
fuel
obligation
scheme
that
seek
to
ensure
that
4
%
of
transport
fuel
be
derive
renewable
source
from
July
2010
,
we
must
ensure
that
such
a
obligation
be
as
favourable
as
possible
to
exist
domestic
bio-fuel
company
and
to
new
company
that
will
emerge
.
it
be
vital
that
the
bio-fuel
obligation
scheme
become
a
source
of
potentiality
,
particularly
regard
the
rural
economy
.
we
must
ensure
we
can
stimulate
supply
domestically
to
avoid
excessive
reliance
on
import
in
order
to
fulfil
the
requirement
of
the
bio-fuel
obligation
scheme
.
for
instance
,
the
Munster
region
traditionally
depend
largely
on
the
sugar
beet
industry
with
approximately
31000
hectare
give
over
to
the
production
of
sugar
.
there
be
a
potential
for
diversion
of
land
use
in
order
to
be
able
to
meet
this
obligation
.
if
company
wish
to
set
up
in
order
to
assist
in
meet
the
obligation
here
,
it
would
stimulate
a
demand
that
could
be
fill
by
the
rural
economy
,
which
be
what
we
should
be
do
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
this
obligation
and
end
up
import
the
raw
material
in
order
to
meet
that
obligation
.
we
need
to
consider
the
economic
potential
on
this
island
to
facilitate
that
.
inherent
within
the
bio-fuel
obligation
scheme
be
a
capacity
for
growth
and
economic
development
of
a
sector
which
be
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
in
its
infancy
in
this
country
.
bio-fuel
industry
lobbyist
,
such
as
Ethanol
Ireland
,
have
maintain
a
starting
point
which
would
mandate
that
,
in
order
for
any
ethanol
to
be
eligible
for
a
obligation
certificate
,
it
would
have
to
meet
the
en
15376
standard
and
be
designate
as
Taric
or
cn
code
22071000
.
it
have
be
suggest
by
Ethanol
Ireland
that
a
situation
similar
to
that
in
Germany
would
be
appropriate
.
in
the
Seanad
,
the
minister
,
in
he
response
on
this
issue
to
Senator
Joe
O'Toole
,
state
,
more
or
less
,
that
Ireland
have
a
obligation
to
remain
within
the
WTO
rule
and
in
compliance
with
EU
regulation
.
my
understanding
of
this
be
that
the
introduction
of
a
tariff
could
not
unfairly
restrict
import
,
and
that
this
be
the
government
position
.
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
statement
in
regard
to
the
regulation
and
we
will
revisit
that
at
a
further
stage
.
the
simple
issue
here
,
and
let
we
not
forget
that
we
be
debate
this
issue
at
a
time
when
the
economy
be
on
its
knee
,
be
that
compliance
with
EU
and
WTO
rule
must
be
mutual
with
this
country
's
need
to
create
new
economic
opportunity
,
particularly
within
the
rural
economy
.
the
question
arise
,
therefore
,
as
to
whether
it
be
possible
to
introduce
a
amendment
which
would
tally
with
the
German
or
other
EU
member
state
's
position
.
as
we
understand
it
,
the
Seanad
amendment
be
fully
consistent
with
EU
trade
guideline
and
do
not
restrict
import
unfairly
or
unduly
.
there
be
concern
,
outline
by
the
minister
in
the
Seanad
,
for
the
implication
for
this
island
and
the
cross
-border
impact
as
to
whether
this
could
lead
to
a
distortion
in
term
of
the
impact
where
pricing
model
may
differ
.
Senator
Joe
O'Toole
sum
it
up
correctly
when
he
state
in
the
Seanad
debate
:
the
minister
say
that
from
a
national
perspective
the
only
substantial
problem
with
the
course
of
action
propose
be
that
the
United
Kingdom
have
not
adopt
such
a
measure
and
give
that
we
import
60
%
of
we
road
transport
fuel
from
the
UK
,
such
a
measure
would
have
the
potential
to
increase
cost
to
Irish
consumer
substantially
as
they
would
have
to
be
supply
with
a
different
blend
of
bioethanol
.
that
be
probably
the
most
challenging
of
all
the
point
make
.
he
further
state
:
most
Brazilian
fuel
ethanol
be
transport
to
Europe
in
bulk
tanker
in
a
undenatured
state
.
normally
,
it
be
only
denature
at
the
point
of
receipt
into
the
member
state
to
benefit
from
the
low
tariff
and
technical
requirement
.
most
of
it
be
bring
into
Rotterdam
and
subsequently
break
down
and
then
distribute
across
Europe
.
good
practice
recommend
that
blend
take
place
as
close
as
possible
to
the
point
of
distribution
.
hence
,
the
point
of
blend
tend
to
be
the
destination
member
state
.
currently
in
Ireland
,
bioethanol
blend
usually
occur
at
the
point
of
receipt
in
the
bond
—
whichever
bond
facility
it
go
into
.
with
regard
to
petroleum
,
we
currently
import
approximately
50
%
of
we
requirement
from
the
UK
,
35
%
through
Whitegate
and
the
balance
from
Scandinavia
,
through
Derry
.
we
have
be
reliably
inform
that
all
the
oil
major
in
Ireland
will
have
blend
capacity
and
undenatured
ethanol
at
they
facility
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
this
have
be
confirm
separately
to
I
as
be
correct
.
Topaz
,
in
Whitegate
,
already
have
full
capability
.
even
if
oil
company
opt
to
blend
in
the
UK
or
mainland
Europe
,
this
be
pan-European
supplier
that
already
supply
some
member
state
with
a
product
similar
to
the
Irish
specify
product
.
all
that
matter
be
that
the
bioethanol
come
into
Ireland
satisfy
the
definition
under
the
bio-fuel
legislation
,
which
must
comply
with
Taric
code
22071000
and
EN
15376
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
's
speech
in
the
Seanad
,
he
allude
to
the
fact
that
because
the
UK
have
not
adopt
such
a
measure
,
and
give
the
massive
rate
of
importation
from
the
UK
,
there
could
be
a
cost
impact
for
the
Irish
consumer
.
I
hope
this
be
a
matter
the
minister
will
go
into
further
on
the
next
stage
.
to
deal
with
Taric
or
cn
code
22071000
,
Ethanol
Ireland
produce
a
paper
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
and
every
member
in
the
House
have
have
sight
of
.
in
it
,
Ethanol
Ireland
suggest
that
the
German
bio
-
fuel
quota
law
would
be
the
most
appropriate
for
this
jurisdiction
.
there
be
two
provision
within
that
law
and
this
would
effectively
create
a
barrier
to
import
from
non-EU
source
be
eligible
for
certificate
unless
they
be
of
a
quality
equal
to
EU
production
and
have
pay
the
high
of
the
two
tariff
's
applicable
to
ethanol
,
namely
,
19.2
cent
per
litre
versus
10.2
cent
per
litre
.
the
issue
for
Ethanol
Ireland
be
that
Irish
-
produce
ethanol
can
compete
with
that
produce
elsewhere
in
the
EU
and
with
non-EU
import
if
that
import
be
of
a
similar
purity
and
attract
the
19.2
cent
per
litre
tariff
.
I
should
point
out
that
I
hold
no
brief
for
Ethanol
Ireland
but
it
be
the
only
group
I
have
have
a
interaction
with
in
regard
to
the
potential
domestic
producer
and
I
believe
its
voice
probably
speak
for
the
domestic
industry
in
this
sense
.
there
have
be
,
to
my
knowledge
,
extensive
discussion
with
the
Department
on
this
issue
,
mainly
overcome
the
Department
's
issue
relate
to
the
pump
price
impact
and
on
the
economic
potential
of
a
indigenous
bio-fuel
industry
.
in
the
Seanad
,
the
minister
give
himself
the
power
to
make
regulation
pertain
to
the
eligibility
of
bio-fuel
.
in
discussion
I
have
have
with
Ethanol
Ireland
,
the
reason
give
for
choose
this
way
be
that
if
the
specific
regulation
be
include
in
the
Bill
itself
,
it
would
require
notification
to
the
EU
,
as
the
minister
have
state
.
this
would
result
in
a
potential
delay
in
implementation
of
the
Bill
,
which
,
give
the
timeframe
involve
in
the
bio-fuel
obligation
scheme
,
would
not
be
acceptable
.
we
will
have
to
deal
with
this
issue
again
on
the
next
stage
as
it
warrant
further
discussion
.
the
essence
of
this
issue
be
whether
,
by
regulation
,
bio
-ethanol
use
for
transport
fuel
must
comply
with
EN
15376
and
,
if
import
,
must
have
be
import
under
Taric
code
22071000
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
obligation
certificate
.
the
two
provision
would
effectively
create
a
barrier
to
import
,
as
I
have
already
outline
.
the
other
issue
in
regard
to
the
obligation
be
whether
the
three
main
EU
policy
objective
be
be
meet
,
namely
,
the
reduction
in
co2
emission
,
increase
security
of
energy
supply
,
and
the
maximisation
of
EU
,
national
and
regional
social
and
economic
benefit
.
if
we
can
create
a
situation
on
this
island
which
allow
for
a
new
market
or
a
new
industry
which
will
take
as
much
of
the
market
share
as
possible
in
term
of
create
a
domestic
supply
and
a
domestic
market
,
this
legislation
should
seek
to
create
the
condition
which
will
bring
that
about
.
as
deputy
Coveney
say
,
farming
and
agri-business
be
in
a
state
of
flux
at
present
in
that
there
be
uncertainty
in
regard
to
the
dairy
sector
and
the
meat
sector
.
we
have
to
recognise
that
if
we
do
not
grasp
this
opportunity
now
,
it
could
be
lose
for
a
long
time
.
the
minister
's
speech
give
a
sense
that
he
wish
to
create
domestic
supplies
for
this
and
if
we
can
facilitate
that
,
it
be
the
way
to
go
.
we
must
not
be
afraid
to
take
this
course
of
action
.
other
country
have
already
implement
tariff
under
various
model
.
I
see
no
reason
why
we
cannot
be
protectionist
in
we
attitude
to
this
issue
.
if
the
obligation
exist
,
Ireland
should
be
able
to
ensure
its
own
security
of
supply
by
use
domestic
means
.
I
welcome
the
Bill
and
will
study
the
Minister
's
speech
in
depth
before
committee
stage
.
this
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
we
should
not
be
ashamed
to
protect
we
own
domestic
supply
in
a
way
that
be
congruous
with
WTO
and
EU
rule
.
I
be
pleased
to
inform
the
deputy
that
I
announce
detail
of
the
successful
applicant
under
the
current
Summer
Works
Scheme
on
19
April
,
2010
.
some
1490
primary

benefit
from

and
medium
scale
building
work
this
summer
under
the
€
122
million
investment
programme
announce
.
the
Planning
and
Building
unit
of
my
Department
will
shortly
contact
all

approve
for

with
detail
and
instruction
on
how
to
proceed
.
detail
of
the
successful
application
be
available
on
the
Department
's
website
,
www.education.ie.
I
wish
to
specifically
address
the
issue
of
credit
union
and
they
ability
to
reschedule
loan
and
pay
dividend
at
the
same
time
.
part
7
refer
to
section
15
(
7
)
of
the
Bill
,
which
seek
to
amend
section
35
of
the
credit
Union
Act
,
will
make
it
impossible
for
credit
union
to
undertake
reschedule
and
pay
a
dividend
to
member
.
this
be
because
the
cost
to
credit
union
of
additional
reserve
arise
from
the
reschedule
would
leave
nothing
to
be
pay
out
by
way
of
a
dividend
.
this
could
cause
member
to
withdraw
savings
from
credit
union
,
result
in
they
have
less
money
to
loan
out
and
force
member
into
the
hand
of
loan
shark
or
moneylender
.
the
minister
for
Finance
undertake
in
April
2009
to
review
section
35
of
the
credit
Union
Act
1997
to
make
it
easy
for
credit
union
to
accommodate
member
desire
to
reschedule
they
loan
,
due
to
the
recession
.
the
Acting
Chairman
,
deputy
Noel
O'Flynn
,
will
be
aware
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
have
undertake
extensive
consultation
with
all
the
representative
body
on
this
and
other
regulatory
provision
.
the
economic
and
regulatory
affair
committee
's
consultation
,
under
the
chairmanship
of
deputy
Moynihan
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
surpass
that
of
the
Department
of
Finance
in
that
the
latter
's
consultation
process
have
be
more
limited
and
technical
difficulty
be
now
manifest
on
the
eve
of
this
legislation
be
pass
into
law
.
I
understand
that
the
expert
committee
establish
by
the
Minister
's
Department
be
limit
originally
in
its
membership
and
meet
infrequently
.
the
propose
regulatory
requirement
underpin
this
legislation
will
result
,
to
my
mind
,
in
the
opposite
to
what
be
intend
by
the
minister
unless
amendment
be
make
on
committee
stage
.
if
not
amend
,
it
will
mean
a
more
restrictive
regime
around
credit
union
,
deny
they
the
ability
to
meet
the
need
of
some
member
impact
by
unemployment
,
wage
cut
and
even
public
service
levy
.
I
be
sure
this
be
not
what
the
minister
have
intend
when
the
legislation
be
first
draft
.
it
be
impossible
and
unwise
to
look
at
the
Central
Bank
Bill
as
it
relate
to
a
ease
of
restriction
on
credit
union
loan
duration
limit
,
without
look
at
what
the
registrar
propose
as
the
underlying
requirement
and
operational
guideline
.
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
view
the
propose
legislative
change
as
a
opportunity
to
impose
yet
more
stringent
reserve
and
liquidity
requirement
upon
credit
union
,
it
could
be
argue
.
this
have
to
be
see
in
the
context
that
credit
union
be
the
most
reserve
-
rich
financial
institution
in
the
State
.
the
registrar
introduce
a
regulatory
or
non-distributable
minimum
capital
reserve
requirement
of
10
%
for
credit
union
in
2009
—
a
very
stringent
reserve
requirement
,
give
that
the
bank
at
present
be
baulk
at
they
new
standard
of
8
%
.
it
should
also
be
measure
against
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
credit
union
benefit
from
a
additional
layer
of
protection
in
the
form
of
a
self
-
fund
mutual
stabilisation
fund
,
the
savings
protection
scheme
,
under
the
auspices
of
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
.
there
be
a
very
real
danger
of
over
-
egg
the
cake
in
this
particular
instance
.
the
registrar
propose
to
apply
he
section
35
requirement
to
all
credit
union
regardless
of
whether
a
credit
union
wish
to
avail
of
the
extension
to
the
section
35
limit
.
this
be
something
that
must
be
address
on
committee
stage
.
the
registrar
be
propose
a
liquidity
requirement
of
25
%
to
30
%
where
the
section
35
exemption
be
avail
of
.
even
the
current
20
%
liquidity
requirement
be
very
onerous
when
measure
against
the
standard
the
regulator
currently
apply
against
banking
.
there
be
every
danger
here
that
the
combination
of
the
registrar
's
and
minister
's
proposal
will
have
the
impact
of
rendering
it
impossible
for
credit
union
to
pay
a
dividend
to
they
member
.
if
all
surplus
fund
must
be
plough
into
additional
reserve
,
credit
union
dividend
will
suffer
,
drive
fund
out
of
responsible
credit
union
and
into
irresponsible
bank
.
it
must
be
state
,
and
the
minister
must
accept
,
that
no
credit
union
have
need
to
be
bail
out
by
the
State
.
no
taxpayer
's
money
have
be
pour
into
a
single
credit
union
,
to
my
knowledge
,
and
the
vast
majority
of
credit
union
be
part
of
a
voluntary
mutual
stabilisation
fund
which
act
as
a
backstop
to
the
State
deposit
guarantee
scheme
.
there
be
ongoing
call
for
this
stabilisation
scheme
to
be
regulate
by
the
registry
of
credit
Union
and
extend
to
all
credit
union
in
the
State
.
the
registrar
seem
to
be
take
the
view
that
every
reschedule
loan
be
a
at
-
risk
loan
.
this
be
a
false
assumption
.
many
credit
union
member
be
take
the
responsible
route
when
confront
by
a
drop
in
income
and
approach
they
credit
union
immediately
,
before
arrears
occur
,
to
renegotiate
they
payment
.
this
must
also
be
consider
on
committee
stage
.
the
proposal
before
the
House
today
,
if
unaltered
,
will
tie
the
hand
of
credit
union
behind
they
back
.
it
be
inconsistent
of
the
regulator
to
encourage
bank
to
reschedule
loan
for
they
borrower
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
financially
penalise
credit
union
that
seek
to
accommodate
they
member
.
practical
amendment
need
to
be
agree
on
committee
stage
.
a
balance
must
be
strike
between
the
need
of
borrower
and
saver
and
the
requirement
to
supplement
already
strong
reserve
.
I
understand
the
credit
union
representative
association
,
include
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
,
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
the
National
Supervisor
's
Forum
and
the
credit
union
themselves
,
have
be
in
negotiation
with
the
regulator
and
the
Department
of
Finance
on
this
issue
.
I
look
forward
to
the
introduction
of
positive
amendment
that
will
add
strength
to
the
credit
union
movement
,
which
be
one
of
the
few
bright
light
on
the
financial
horizon
.
the
minister
for
Finance
set
out
,
in
April
2009
,
to
make
it
easy
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
the
need
of
member
experience
unemployment
and
reduce
income
by
afford
great
flexibility
to
credit
union
to
extend
loan
term
,
where
necessary
,
beyond
five
year
.
his
Department
enter
into
limited
consultation
on
this
matter
and
it
be
the
registrar
of
credit
union
and
not
the
Department
that
become
the
driver
in
this
reform
.
the
result
be
legislation
that
make
it
more
difficult
—
that
be
,
more
expensive
—
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
member
request
for
reschedule
loan
.
I
be
not
say
credit
union
should
not
have
strong
reserve
.
nobody
be
argue
that
.
I
fully
support
the
registrar
's
introduction
of
the
regulatory
reserve
requirement
in
2009
and
commend
credit
union
on
build
up
they
capital
reserve
to
10
%
as
a
result
of
this
requirement
.
this
compare
favourably
with
the
equivalent
figure
for
bank
,
which
be
8
%
.
however
,
this
house
should
pause
for
thought
when
we
see
yet
another
reserve
-
drive
initiative
from
the
registrar
that
have
not
be
the
subject
of
a
regulatory
impact
analysis
.
credit
union
representative
association
be
responsible
body
and
be
warning
against
the
financial
impact
of
this
late
—
dare
I
say
it
—
hurry
imposition
by
the
registrar
.
it
be
unwise
for
this
House
to
consider
such
a
imposition
when
the
registrar
and
the
Department
have
clearly
not
undertake
a
impact
analysis
.
Impact
model
produce
by
credit
union
body
show
many
credit
union
face
nil
dividend
return
to
member
as
a
result
of
the
minister
's
proposal
.
the
propose
change
will
not
address
the
need
of
unemployed
credit
union
member
but
will
make
it
impossibly
expensive
for
credit
union
to
respond
to
the
need
of
they
member
.
in
addition
,
and
equally
importantly
,
the
measure
will
jeopardise
the
ability
of
many
credit
union
to
pay
dividend
to
they
member
,
which
will
drive
money
out
of
credit
union
over
time
and
ultimately
damage
this
great
not
-
for
-
profit
resource
.
ultimately
,
the
only
body
that
will
gain
from
the
weaken
of
the
credit
union
movement
will
be
bank
and
moneylender
.
it
could
be
argue
that
this
be
a
hurry
and
ill
-
conceive
measure
.
it
merit
careful
scrutiny
before
damage
be
inflict
on
the
credit
union
sector
.
this
sector
have
not
demand
any
bailout
at
taxpayer
's
expense
and
it
have
act
with
probity
at
all
time
,
although
there
be
some
notable
exception
.
look
at
the
credit
union
movement
,
one
must
be
convince
that
it
have
act
for
the
common
good
at
all
time
.
it
be
a
responsible
sector
with
its
own
stabilisation
fund
.
when
we
hear
warning
from
the
credit
union
representative
association
of
the
damage
that
this
so
-
call
reform
will
bring
,
we
must
take
cognisance
of
this
and
act
cautiously
.
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
have
extensive
power
of
regulation
and
be
currently
oversee
a
review
of
the
credit
union
sector
on
behalf
of
the
Department
of
Finance
.
Radical
proposal
to
heap
additional
reserve
requirement
on
a
already
reserve
-
rich
credit
union
sector
need
careful
consideration
.
I
urge
that
this
take
place
and
that
there
be
plenty
of
dialogue
with
the
representative
association
.
I
hope
they
concern
will
be
reflect
in
the
minister
's
response
and
in
amendment
introduce
to
the
Bill
on
Committee
stage
.
I
ask
the
Acting
Chairman
how
much
time
I
have
leave
.
I
understand
the
Fine
Gael
speaker
be
next
.
I
have
make
my
point
.
if
there
be
a
government
speaker
in
the
House
,
I
will
yield
to
she
,
if
that
be
in
order
.
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Lenihan
,
in
response
to
a
Parliamentary
question
today
in
regard
to
the
Mazar
review
of
lending
to
small
and
medium
enterprise
state
:
the
third
Mazar
report
on
lending
to
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
which
cover
the
period
from
October
to
December
2009
,
show
that
credit
application
in
number
and
value
term
rise
slightly
in
the
last
quarter
of
2009
over
the
previous
quarter
,
which
be
encouraging
.
the
level
of
application
for
credit
appear
to
be
stabilise
and
Mazar
also
report
a
small
improvement
in
the
overall
credit
approval
rate
.
however
,
the
reduction
in
the
stock
of
credit
,
as
repayment
exceed
new
credit
,
and
in
credit
quality
report
by
the
bank
remain
a
concern
for
the
government
.
to
address
this
concern
,
I
announce
early
this
month
that
AIB
and
Bank
of
Ireland
be
to
make
available
a
minimum
of
€
3
billion
each
for
new
or
increase
credit
facility
,
include
work
capital
target
at
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
in
the
real
economy
in
each
of
the
next
two
year
.
the
small
and
medium
enterprise
group
appear
before
the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
and
Regulatory
affair
yesterday
.
its
member
constitute
more
than
98
%
of
all
business
entity
in
Ireland
and
number
more
than
240000
in
term
of
the
number
of
business
they
represent
and
employ
just
under
one
million
people
.
in
response
to
question
on
the
Mazar
report
,
Mr.
Fielding
,
the
representative
,
state
that
,
with
regard
to
access
to
credit
,
the
Mazar
report
publish
last
week
have
be
hijack
by
the
bank
.
in
the
first
two
Mazar
report
there
be
major
input
from
the
Department
of
Finance
,
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
and
small
business
.
we
do
not
even
know
the
third
report
be
come
out
and
it
be
launch
at
a
joint
press
conference
by
Mazar
and
the
Irish
Banking
Federation
with
no
Department
of
Finance
,
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
or
small
to
medium
enterprise
.
it
be
very
disappointing
from
we
point
of
view
.
in
further
deliberation
on
the
difficulty
face
small
business
we
speak
about
the
employment
subsidy
scheme
.
Mr.
Fielding
go
on
to
state
that
last
summer
the
Tánaiste
introduce
the
employment
subsidy
scheme
.
initially
,
it
be
for
exporter
only
but
it
be
extend
to
all
company
.
I
direct
the
follow
comment
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
.
however
,
Mr.
Fielding
go
on
to
state
that
in
the
small
print
one
see
it
be
extend
to
all
company
except
that
employ
few
than
ten
people
,
immediately
exclude
90
%
of
all
business
.
therefore
,
government
policy
on
employment
relate
to
firm
employ
ten
or
more
employee
.
it
give
a
unfair
advantage
to
that
employ
11
as
against
a
firm
employ
nine
people
.
the
government
do
not
have
bottomless
pocket
but
one
would
think
more
could
be
do
when
one
see
the
amount
of
money
be
invest
in
the
bank
.
this
be
the
word
of
the
person
who
represent
98
%
of
business
in
the
country
.
this
be
he
view
in
respect
of
funding
and
the
role
of
bank
in
this
society
at
the
moment
.
there
be
a
vacuum
at
present
.
it
be
the
view
of
ISME
that
there
remain
a
significant
lending
deficit
which
undermine
competitiveness
,
constrain
productivity
,
threaten
recovery
and
put
at
risk
the
ability
of
sme
to
gain
access
to
working
capital
and
growth
capital
.
that
be
what
this
motion
be
about
.
the
banking
crisis
have
seriously
impair
the
capacity
of
Irish
bank
to
lend
to
the
SME
sector
.
I
refer
to
the
answer
I
receive
to
my
question
on
the
Mazar
report
.
the
minister
state
that
a
letter
be
send
to
both
Bank
of
Ireland
and
AIB
on
7
April
of
this
year
require
they
to
prepare
a
sme
lending
plan
,
break
down
by
sector
and
geography
for
submission
to
the
Department
by
12
May
.
what
do
this
tell
we
about
the
government
's
response
to
lending
in
the
SME
sector
in
the
first
instance
and
the
bank
response
since
the
guarantee
be
put
in
place
in
September
2008
in
respect
of
lending
in
the
SME
sector
?
it
be
non-existent
;
it
be
not
happen
.
the
evidence
of
a
letter
on
7
April
this
year
do
not
inspire
confidence
into
the
process
be
undertake
in
respect
of
the
systemic
bank
and
other
bank
at
present
.
the
minister
also
state
both
bank
be
expect
to
make
credit
available
.
both
bank
be
expect
to
make
credit
available
immediately
and
be
not
to
wait
until
plan
be
submit
.
the
bottom
line
be
we
have
a
viable
plan
here
,
one
which
will
facilitate
lending
to
the
SME
sector
.
we
can
do
this
post
haste
,
which
be
what
need
to
be
do
to
effect
growth
in
this
economy
again
.
the

a
new
Irish

will
be
consider
in

.
in

detailed
analysis
of

carry
out
by
forward

,
the
Department
be
also
currently
examine
a
number
of
broad
policy
issue

of

.
as
part
of
this
,
consideration
be
be
give
to
the
setting
up
of
a
new
framework
in
relation
to
the
establishment
of
new
second
level
school
and
they
patronage
.
with
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
I
,
too
,
wish
to
warmly
congratulate
deputy
Connick
on
he
accession
to
the
position
of
Minister
of
State
.
I
wish
he
well
and
look
forward
to
work
with
he
.
I
be
disappointed
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
if
the
scheme
be
design
with
biodiversity
in
mind
,
will
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
hedgerow
in
particular
and
road
margin
and
the
biodiversity
within
be
be
threaten
by
the
illegal
dumping
of
plastic
,
which
,
in
turn
,
will
have
a
effect
on
biodiversity
over
time
?
will
he
also
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
a
opportunity
,
through
this
scheme
,
for
farmer
to
work
in
partnership
with
the
local
authority
to
ensure
drainage
mechanism
be
put
in
place
?
we
could
potentially
have
a
arterial
drainage
type
scheme
at
a
local
level
and
could
also
,
by
incentivise
farmer
to
maintain
the
hedge
row
,
create
from
this
some
degree
of
income
.
I
believe
this
be
a
miss
opportunity
.
if
the
scheme
be
so
diverse
,
be
not
a
whole
farm
scheme
and
relate
to
issue
such
as
tree
planting
,
moor
land
grazing
,
lake
catchment
,
mix
grazing
and
conservation
of
wild
bird
habitat
then
I
honestly
believe
a
opportunity
have
go
abeg
to
do
something
to
stem
the
tide
of
illegal
dumping
and
to
bring
farmer
and
landowner
into
partnership
in
term
of
seek
to
alleviate
that
problem
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
be
glad
the
Minister
of
State
mention
the
word
"
flooding
"
because
one
can
have
all
the
nitrate
alleviation
measure
in
the
world
,
but
if
one
do
not
tackle
the
issue
of
flooding
it
do
not
amount
to
anything
.
would
the
Minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
since
the
serious
flooding
last
year
nothing
have
be
do
,
in
concrete
term
,
to
instigate
measure
which
would
prevent
such
flooding
happen
again
,
in
particular
in
the
Shannon
basin
region
?
the
consultation
process
be
lag
behind
the
need
for
direct
action
on
flooding
event
,
such
as
that
we
see
in
the
west
and
throughout
the
Shannon
region
.
action
be
now
need
and
it
precede
the
consultation
process
.
we
should
not
envisage
a
situation
in
the
come
month
like
that
which
we
see
previously
,
in
term
of
its
effect
on
agriculture
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
in
a
position
to
change
the
system
now
.
I
be
also
reassure
by
the
minister
's
reply
.
give
the
allege
breach
of
contract
,
will
a
mechanism
be
introduce
to
facilitate
the
compensation
of
farmer
for
loss
of
contract
?
potentially
,
the
company
have
abuse
its
dominant
position
by
allegedly
breach
contract
.
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
that
?
not
if
one
be
loyal
to
Beamish
.
we
all
have
to
be
see
to
be
do
something
when
it
come
to
the
dairy
sector
but
it
appear
that
every
mechanism
that
could
be
put
in
place
have
be
put
in
place
.
I
refer
to
the
market
management
regime
,
the
export
refund
scheme
and
intervention
stock
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
until
such
time
as
there
be
a
pick
-
up
in
global
demand
that
the
system
will
remain
as
it
be
for
some
time
?
perhaps
I
be
wrong
but
it
appear
that
not
much
more
can
be
do
in
term
of
intervene
to
facilitate
a
recovery
until
such
time
as
global
demand
for
milk
and
milk
-
base
product
pick
up
.
I
do
not
have
access
to
the
tabular
information
.
however
,
I
accept
the
minister
's
reply
.
in
pose
the
question
I
be
interested
in
find
out
why
farmer
be
become
liable
for
penalty
and
what
be
the
source
of
the
non-compliance
.
if
we
have
a
record
of
that
information
,
matter
could
be
rectify
in
future
.
how
many
do
not
submit
payment
claim
or
do
so
late
?
the
minister
state
the
problem
in
Kerry
be
sort
today
.
what
exactly
do
he
mean
by
that
?
when
?
when
can
the
farmer
expect
they
payment
?
I
should
say
at
the
outset
that
Cobh
community
hospital
be
a
facility
that
be
very
well
-
regard
by
the
people
of
Cobh
.
I
have
be
ask
by
my
Labour
Party
colleague
on
Cobh
Town
Council
to
raise
this
issue
as
a
matter
of
urgency
because
there
be
a
situation
whereby
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
have
take
over
the
fair
deal
scheme
as
it
relate
to
Cobh
hospital
.
that
will
have
serious
permutation
for
the
cost
per
patient
per
week
in
that
it
be
state
that
the
possible
drop
in
fee
from
€
1200
to
€
800
per
bed
per
week
could
result
in
a
serious
deficit
.
obviously
a
deficit
in
funding
would
have
a
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
patient
to
remain
within
the
hospital
in
the
first
instance
,
but
also
severely
impact
on
the
hospital
's
ability
to
take
in
new
patient
.
it
be
a
38
-
bed
hospital
and
there
be
approximately
40
staff
.
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
be
the
issue
whereby
care
for
we
old
people
who
be
in
community
-
base
facility
be
be
erode
by
this
government
through
a
process
of
stealth
.
the
government
's
model
of
health
care
be
about
roll
back
the
State
and
this
wonderful
community
-
base
facility
so
that
they
may
be
completely
and
utterly
subsume
into
a
private
nursing
home
model
,
thereby
roll
back
the
stakesholding
that
community
have
within
this
hospital
which
make
they
the
excellent
facility
they
be
.
it
be
all
be
do
under
the
wonderful
guise
of
HIQA
rule
and
the
fact
that
this
institution
be
old
.
anything
that
be
deem
to
be
old
in
this
new
paradigm
we
have
with
this
government
be
deem
not
to
be
of
sufficient
standard
.
I
want
to
speak
for
hospital
such
as
Cobh
,
the
welfare
home
in
Youghal
and
Nazareth
House
in
Mallow
,
all
of
which
provide
a
excellent
standard
of
care
,
but
be
now
under
threat
because
of
the
new
rule
that
have
come
into
play
through
the
fair
deal
scheme
and
the
new
punish
hiqa
standard
.
all
I
want
to
do
here
be
make
the
case
for
Cobh
community
hospital
,
in
that
it
be
a
excellent
facility
.
there
be
a
significant
buy
-
in
from
the
people
of
Cobh
into
this
hospital
.
the
staff
coterie
be
very
loyal
to
the
hospital
.
the
patient
there
be
happy
,
and
I
would
hope
the
government
ensure
the
continuation
of
this
hospital
in
perpetuity
,
especially
for
the
old
people
of
Cobh
who
will
use
it
,
hopefully
,
into
the
future
.

and
sing

for
Ireland
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Ferris
.
I
wish
to
respond
to
the
last
two
speaker
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Bill
which
we
believe
be
predicate
on
common
sense
,
do
what
it
say
on
the
tin
and
be
unambiguous
in
what
it
seek
to
do
,
that
be
,
decriminalise
certain
transgression
under
the
law
.
for
Fianna
fáil
to
suggest
somehow
that
any
amendment
to
the
current
position
would
wreak
havoc
on
the
sustainability
of
the
future
of
the
industry
be
,
to
be
frank
,
patronise
to
the
thousand
of
fishing
family
who
seek
to
make
a
living
from
this
industry
.
it
be
quite
patronising
to
the
person
who
have
take
the
time
to
do
the
research
and
come
before
this
House
,
and
,
in
a
genuine
sense
,
who
seek
to
provide
a
solution
to
a
problem
the
House
have
be
debate
since
2005
.
I
have
examine
the
historical
debate
and
it
have
to
be
state
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
that
the
committee
deal
with
this
matter
have
a
very
unite
view
.
there
be
cross-party
support
for
a
amendment
to
the
legislation
in
order
that
one
would
not
criminalise
a
person
,
as
deputy
Sheahan
have
point
out
.
such
a
person
would
not
be
bring
before
the
court
if
he
or
she
be
4
kg
over
a
quota
.
that
be
the
type
of
ludicrous
situation
which
deputy
O'Keeffe
's
Bill
seek
to
address
.
that
be
fair
.
in
examine
the
commission
's
Green
Paper
on
the
reform
of
the
common
Fishery
Policy
,
it
state
that
a
minuscule
amount
,
as
I
understand
it
,
be
afford
to
fishery
protection
.
I
agree
the
Sea
-
Fishery
Protection
Authority
be
need
,
but
there
be
a
perception
that
the
authority
be
not
work
in
partnership
or
in
tandem
with
the
fishing
organisation
or
the
fisherman
themselves
.
it
be
perceive
,
on
the
quay
side
,
as
be
against
this
people
.
I
will
speak
about
that
in
great
detail
late
.
I
also
wish
to
address
the
remark
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
do
not
understand
the
logic
behind
the
follow
comment
:
I
be
not
convinced
,
unfortunately
,
that
this
Bill
would
contribute
positively
to
the
rebuild
of
fish
stock
.
quite
the
opposite
,
in
fact
,
my
belief
be
that
it
could
result
in
increase
the
level
of
illegal
fishing
and
further
drive
down
the
biomass
of
fish
stock
lead
to
a
collapse
of
many
of
the
key
commercial
stock
around
the
coast
on
which
we
fishing
industry
be
so
dependent
.
there
be
a
assumption
in
that
comment
that
if
the
current
provision
whereby
a
man
who
overfish
by
4
kg
be
not
subject
to
the
potential
for
administrative
sanction
or
sanction
before
a
court
be
change
or
amend
in
any
way
,
such
a
man
will
fish
at
a
level
of
200
kg
over
quota
the
follow
day
.
there
be
a
underlying
assumption
that
if
some
of
the
sanction
be
amend
or
soften
,
the
fishing
industry
and
all
that
who
own
vessel
will
err
on
the
side
of
criminality
or
will
flout
the
law
.
it
be
true
that
some
have
transgress
and
should
be
subject
to
the
full
rigour
of
the
law
.
however
,
for
Fianna
Fáil
and
the
government
to
suggest
that
any
amendment
would
lead
to
a
serious
undermine
and
depletion
of
we
fish
stock
and
would
have
a
effect
on
sustainability
be
over
-
egg
the
pudding
.
in
he
speech
the
Minister
of
State
remark
in
respect
of
France
that
all
member
state
,
include
Ireland
,
be
under
close
scrutiny
by
the
commission
.
he
further
remark
that
in
the
case
of
France
,
in
2005
the
European
Court
of
Justice
impose
a
fine
of
€
20
million
together
with
a
fine
of
€
57.8
million
for
every
month
until
the
appropriate
level
of
regulation
be
apply
to
its
fishing
industry
.
do
the
minister
of
State
contextualise
that
statement
?
do
he
state
how
much
the
fishing
industry
be
worth
to
France
?
do
he
state
what
percentage
that
fine
be
relative
to
the
overall
industry
in
France
?
common
sense
dictate
that
fine
of
€
20
million
and
€
57.8
million
be
a
drop
in
the
ocean
by
comparison
with
what
the
industry
be
worth
to
France
.
it
could
not
care
less
about
sanction
.
few
fisherman
in
France
be
subject
to
the
equivalent
of
the
Sea
-
Fishery
Protection
Authority
enter
and
confiscate
they
boat
and
bring
they
up
before
the
civil
court
within
two
or
three
week
or
subject
to
file
go
to
the
French
DPP
or
the
Attorney
General
.
that
be
simply
not
the
case
in
France
but
if
the
Minister
of
State
can
prove
otherwise
I
would
be
pleased
to
hear
it
.
it
be
a
matter
of
relativity
.
we
be
all
aware
there
be
fisherman
who
be
no
saint
;
it
be
well
document
.
however
,
if
the
government
be
go
to
give
we
a
argument
against
propose
legislation
,
at
least
it
should
give
we
something
factual
,
not
something
out
of
context
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
proportionality
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
in
he
speech
.
he
state
that
successive
fishery
minister
have
seriously
consider
the
imposition
of
administrative
sanction
follow
representation
and
that
on
a
number
of
occasion
the
advice
of
successive
Attorneys
General
have
be
seek
in
relation
to
this
approach
.
he
further
state
that
the
legal
advice
be
that
impose
sanction
such
as
that
set
out
in
the
Fine
Gael
Bill
would
undermine
the
exist
legislative
framework
,
allow
offender
to
avoid
the
very
serious
penalty
,
prosecution
and
forfeiture
of
gear
by
payment
of
a
fine
of
€
1000
or
less
.
however
,
the
Bill
clearly
state
there
be
no
reason
one
cannot
go
after
that
person
who
flout
the
law
,
who
be
repeat
offender
and
who
have
be
in
breach
on
successive
occasion
.
it
be
still
possible
to
impose
the
full
rigour
of
the
law
and
I
do
not
understand
why
the
Minister
of
State
cannot
apply
the
same
logic
here
to
the
situation
that
apply
to
that
who
use
quad
on
the
mountain
,
to
which
deputy
O'Keeffe
refer
.
I
believe
this
point
be
worthy
of
a
response
by
the
government
.
as
I
understand
the
Bill
,
it
allow
for
a
scenario
whereby
a
element
of
discretion
be
apply
.
if
someone
seriously
flout
the
law
,
one
can
bring
that
person
before
the
court
.
however
,
where
a
person
exceed
the
limit
of
4
kg
,
for
example
,
which
have
happen
,
one
do
not
apply
the
full
rigour
of
the
law
because
it
be
such
a
small
administrative
mistake
or
transgression
and
therefore
common
sense
apply
.
I
do
not
understand
the
government
's
position
in
this
regard
.
we
support
the
Bill
.
it
have
be
discuss
at
cross-party
level
and
at
committee
in
the
past
.
there
have
be
agreement
and
I
do
not
understand
why
the
current
situation
prevail
in
the
House
.
it
speak
to
the
culture
in
this
house
as
well
,
and
it
speak
volume
about
why
people
outside
the
House
be
so
cynical
when
one
position
be
take
outside
and
inside
the
House
,
but
then
a
person
vote
in
a
different
way
.
it
feed
into
the
cynicism
about
politician
when
we
give
rich
tea
and
sympathy
to
a
position
but
then
vote
against
it
when
it
come
to
the
substance
of
the
matter
.
we
agree
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
good
enforcement
be
necessary
for
more
effective
fishery
management
system
.
question
arise
in
we
mind
in
respect
of
criminal
sanction
and
a
equitable
way
of
deal
with
non-compliance
of
fishery
management
system
.
if
the
figure
be
to
be
believe
,
the
marine
sector
yield
a
annual
turnover
of
almost
€
3
billion
and
support
44000
job
.
this
figure
be
supply
by
the
Sea
-
Fishery
Protection
Authority
2007
report
.
if
we
be
to
believe
it
,
then
we
must
examine
in
great
detail
where
sanction
should
be
apply
.
we
all
agree
that
any
illegal
activity
that
endanger
the
fish
stock
of
this
island
must
be
punish
.
when
speak
to
the
Sea
-
Fishery
and
Maritime
Jurisdiction
Bill
in
2005
,
my
colleague
,
deputy
Tommy
Broughan
,
state
the
most
effective
route
for
implement
a
workable
and
successful
means
of
control
seem
to
be
to
impose
harsh
criminal
penalty
only
on
the
most
persistent
and
extreme
offender
,
which
correspond
with
the
point
I
make
early
.
this
Bill
allow
for
such
a
mechanism
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
strongly
then
,
as
now
,
that
other
breach
should
be
deal
with
by
mechanism
such
as
administrative
penalty
,
on
-
the
-
spot
fine
and
a
transparent
and
predictable
point
system
on
licence
similar
to
that
which
apply
to
owner
of
motor
vehicle
find
to
be
transgress
the
law
.
a
amount
of
consternation
exist
among
Irish
fisherman
about
the
role
of
the
SFPA
.
there
be
a
perception
among
fisherman
that
they
come
under
great
scrutiny
from
the
authority
's
officer
and
that
non-Irish
vessel
be
leave
off
the
hook
.
we
should
examine
this
in
great
detail
.
on
page
27
of
the
authority
's
2007
report
there
be
a
reference
to
the
number
of
instance
where
legal
action
be
take
by
the
SFPA
against
Irish
vessel
.
of
the
99
case
in
which
legal
action
be
require
,
some
23
be
refer
to
the
Attorney
General
's
office
,
52
write
warning
be
issue
and
24
detention
order
be
make
.
there
be
99
case
from
19174
landing
in
2007
.
this
figure
may
have
be
update
since
.
let
we
compare
this
to
the
figure
for
non-Irish
vessel
.
in
2007
,
there
be
1,465
landing
and
1351
inspection
whereupon
enforcement
be
take
in
42
case
.
of
the
42
case
,
some
18
result
in
detention
order
,
warning
letter
account
for
23
case
and
one
file
be
send
to
the
Attorney
General
.
we
must
speak
to
relativity
because
when
we
compare
the
number
of
inspection
of
Irish
to
non-Irish
vessel
we
must
factor
in
the
number
of
landing
as
well
.
perhaps
this
address
deputy
Sheahan
's
early
point
.
in
essence
,
base
on
this
figure
it
could
be
argue
there
be
no
evidence
to
suggest
Irish
owner
be
scrutinise
more
.
however
,
I
be
certain
that
the
fisherman
's
organisation
would
have
a
strong
view
on
the
matter
and
such
datum
should
be
scrutinise
independently
.
the
essential
point
be
that
of
the
legal
action
take
,
the
vast
bulk
be
administrative
in
nature
.
however
,
there
be
little
or
no
analysis
provide
by
the
SFPA
as
to
the
nature
of
that
administrative
and
detention
-
related
sanction
.
the
Bill
,
rightly
,
point
out
that
"
the
sea
fishing
community
in
Ireland
have
be
aggrieved
at
the
use
of
onerous
criminal
penalty
to
control
even
minor
breach
of
technical
regulation
"
.
this
be
the
essence
of
the
Bill
and
it
be
on
this
basis
we
support
it
.

I
welcome
the
minister
's
comment
in
regard
to
the
assess
means
in
a
balance
fashion
and
I
support
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
it
be
a
cause
for
concern
that
there
may
be
industrious
and
imaginative
people
who
see
this
provision
as
a
potential
mine
for
economic
gain
.
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
have
sum
up
the
issue
well
.
we
must
prevent
situation
where
the
cost
of
recovery
of
the
fine
exceed
the
fine
itself
.
it
would
be
dangerous
to
allow
that
type
of
culture
to
emerge
.
Seanad
amendment

be
quite
vague
in
this
regard
,
indicate
that
the
minister
may
specify
the
"
rate
at
which
fee
that
may
be
so
deduct
shall
be
calculate
"
.
there
must
be
clarity
in
order
to
prevent
the
system
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
in
fairness
,
we
must
acknowledge
a
decent
Bill
when
it
come
before
we
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
ensure
that
the
minister
would
take
into
account
a
person
's
earnings
and
means
when
make
a
decision
on
imprisonment
.
I
be
glad
that
have
happen
.
I
take
the
minister
's
point
about
the
small
percentage
of
that
who
be
in
prison
as
a
result
of
non-payment
of
fine
.
however
,
this
Bill
be
only
one
part
of
a
jigsaw
that
need
to
be
examine
,
because
the
overall
prison
service
must
also
be
examine
.
the
recent
departure
of
Kathleen
McMahon
and
John
Lonergan
be
significant
and
we
must
take
cognisance
of
what
Ms
McMahon
be
say
in
respect
of
the
governance
procedure
that
dictate
how
the
prison
system
be
run
.
there
be
a
issue
of
overcrowding
and
there
be
scenario
where
we
have
three
or
four
people
in
a
cell
.
the
former
governor
of
Mountjoy
Prison
have
speak
extensively
about
the
humane
treatment
of
prisoner
.
the
idea
of
a
prisoner
slop
out
in
this
day
and
age
be
ludicrous
.
if
we
take
the
Fines
Bill
as
one
part
of
the
jigsaw
,
then
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
will
have
few
people
in
prison
as
a
result
of
this
legislation
,
which
be
welcome
.
however
,
common
sense
must
speak
to
the
issue
of
overcrowding
in
prison
and
the
governance
procedure
for
the
prison
service
.
we
need
to
ask
whether
somebody
like
Ms
Kathleen
McMahon
could
have
stay
within
the
system
if
she
have
be
allow
a
great
deal
of
autonomy
to
allow
she
to
progress
the
agenda
upon
which
she
have
embark
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
the
Dóchas
centre
.
there
be
overcrowding
and
there
seem
to
be
a
shortage
of
prison
place
.
the
minister
recently
state
in
this
House
that
Kilworth
prison
be
still
on
the
agenda
.
in
real
term
there
be
no
sign
of
that
prison
and
the
creation
of
extra
place
.
a
wide
debate
need
to
take
place
on
this
issue
.
we
support
the
Bill
,
which
we
hope
will
reduce
the
number
of
people
in
prison
.
we
hope
a
qualitative
and
quantitative
approach
take
to
how
the
prison
system
be
run
.

the
provision
of
a
new
building
for
the
school
to
which
the
deputy
refer
necessitate
the
acquisition
of
a
site
.
the
Patron
have
decide
to
make
this
acquisition
.
when
a
site
be
available
,
consideration
can
be
give
to
the
inclusion
of
a
building
project
for
the
school
in
the
School
Building
and
Modernisation
Programme
.
however
,
in
light
of
the
current
level
of
demand
on
the
Department
's
capital
budget
,
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
indicative
timeframe
for
the
progression
of
a
building
project
for
the
school
at
this
time
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
and
I
be
seek
to
ascertain
definitively
whether
he
be
give
any
credence
to
the
idea
of
introduce
a
de
facto
minimum
income
for
every
farmer
so
as
to
buttress
against
potential
market
instability
in
the
future
.
the
recent
volatility
in
the
dairy
sector
show
we
,
along
with
other
factor
,
just
how
volatile
farm
income
be
at
present
and
the
fact
that
there
will
have
to
be
a
EU
-
wide
response
to
this
.
what
I
be
really
try
to
ascertain
be
whether
the
minister
be
give
credence
to
the
notion
of
a
minimum
payment
for
farmer
and
,
if
so
,
whether
there
be
EU
-
wide
support
for
such
a
measure
.
the
minister
mention
the
historical
model
of
payment
,
and
I
acknowledge
the
speech
he
give
to
the
Seanad
recently
in
which
he
express
a
preference
for
the
retention
of
this
model
.
what
I
take
from
that
speech
,
however
,
be
that
the
historical
model
would
come
under
increase
attack
and
that
it
be
not
guarantee
into
the
future
.
that
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
minister
could
state
,
at
least
,
that
there
be
a
degree
of
stability
of
income
,
but
it
be
not
necessarily
guarantee
to
continue
if
the
model
change
,
unless
the
minister
state
otherwise
.
if
the
historical
model
change
,
will
that
compromise
basic
income
to
farmer
?
the
minister
's
reply
be
take
directly
from
a
recent
speech
he
give
to
the
Seanad
.
the
own
initiative
report
on
this
issue
be
author
by
Mr.
George
Lyon
,
MEP
,
a
liberal
Democrat
representative
for
Scotland
,
whose
party
be
a
member
of
the
same
group
within
the
European
Parliament
as
Fianna
Fáil
.
Mr.
Lyon
refer
to
the
desire
to
go
beyond
2020
for
phase
in
the
move
from
historic
to
area
-
base
payment
and
to
significant
difference
in
term
of
the
criterion
to
be
use
for
the
distribution
of
single
farm
payment
to
member
state
.
as
far
as
he
be
concerned
,
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
historical
model
will
be
no
more
.
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
point
that
there
be
increase
pressure
for
that
to
occur
.
if
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
majority
of
member
state
will
seek
to
move
away
from
the
historical
model
of
payment
,
then
what
be
the
current
thinking
within
the
Fianna
Fáil
group
in
the
European
Parliament
as
to
what
will
be
the
replacement
?
be
Mr.
Lyon
speak
for
all
Fianna
Fáil
Member
of
the
European
Parliament
when
he
speak
about
a
movement
towards
area
-
base
payment
?
I
do
not
hear
exactly
what
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
say
but
I
wonder
if
I
can
ask
—
—
appreciate
the
latitude
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
have
already
allow
I
,
I
be
just
about
to
state
that
at
meeting
of
the
agriculture
committee
of
which
Mr.
Lyon
be
a
member
,
Ireland
's
position
would
heretofore
have
be
put
forward
by
the
minister
,
but
that
be
no
long
necessarily
the
case
because
of
the
new
structure
in
place
follow
the
ratification
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
.
it
be
on
this
basis
that
I
give
great
credence
to
what
he
be
say
because
it
could
be
reflective
of
the
position
of
the
group
within
the
European
Parliament
to
which
he
belong
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
about
the
political
consideration
but
I
be
sure
he
will
acknowledge
that
George
Lyon
's
position
on
this
issue
will
be
very
influential
in
term
of
the
final
outcome
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
there
be
approximately
700
amendment
to
that
particular
report
currently
before
the
European
Parliament
.
the
key
for
we
at
this
stage
of
the
process
be
to
try
to
nail
down
a
more
definitive
government
position
,
that
be
,
to
ascertain
whether
the
minister
have
come
to
a
conclusion
regard
the
new
system
for
payment
for
farmer
post
2013
.
if
I
understand
he
correctly
the
minister
be
say
that
be
a
ongoing
process
and
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
accept
that
answer
.
if
we
take
the
three
fundamental
pillar
that
will
underpin
CAP
,
namely
,
water
management
,
biodiversity
and
climate
change
,
a
issue
will
arise
regard
the
whole
pillar
of
rural
development
and
whether
income
will
be
take
from
direct
payment
to
farmer
and
house
in
a
rural
development
pillar
,
which
could
see
it
go
into
a
administrative
function
through
various
local
body
and
development
organisation
.
do
the
minister
have
a
view
on
that
at
this
stage
?
have
a
clear
government
position
evolve
on
that
aspect
?
would
the
minister
acknowledge
that
there
be
reservation
by
farm
organisation
on
the
matter
on
the
basis
that
they
would
not
wish
to
see
income
be
diversify
into
that
area
at
the
risk
that
it
could
go
down
the
so
-
call
administrative
black
hole
?
if
one
's
solution
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
cattle
,
it
be
a
simplistic
way
of
look
at
the
problem
and
one
be
not
look
at
the
problem
of
ghg
properly
.
that
be
a
scientific
view
.
I
would
refer
the
Minister
of
State
to
TResearch
,
which
be
a
Teagasc
publication
in
this
regard
.
perhaps
he
might
acknowledge
that
look
at
the
area
of
animal
genetics
,
animal
management
,
animal
nutrition
and
performance
stimulant
would
be
a
good
way
to
reduce
ghg
like
methane
and
that
there
be
a
scientific
basis
for
do
that
.
would
he
acknowledge
that
any
proposal
to
implement
the
McCarthy
report
as
it
pertain
to
the
scientific
budget
would
have
a
impact
on
Teagasc
's
operation
and
on
reduce
methane
emission
potentially
in
the
long
run
?
we
need
to
take
a
more
lateral
view
.
early
,
the
minister
refer
to
the
consultation
process
and
say
that
the
commission
will
publish
documentation
.
can
member
of
this
house
be
provide
with
a
insight
into
the
view
of
the
Irish
permanent
representation
in
Brussels
?
in
that
way
we
could
be
make
aware
of
how
the
process
be
progress
.
I
do
not
ask
about
the
sow
or
the
poultry
,
although
I
be
glad
to
hear
there
be
something
in
the
offing
on
that
point
.
what
be
the
exact
timeframe
for
the
minister
to
conclude
scheme
for
dairy
hygiene
,
sheep
fencing
and
water
harvesting
?
on
what
date
will
that
scheme
come
into
effect
?
this
issue
boil
down
to
some
simple
fact
.
Fermoy
Town
Council
have
be
instruct
to
fix
a
fish
pass
on
the
River
Blackwater
in
Fermoy
to
adhere
to
a
edict
from
the
European
Commission
hand
down
on
foot
of
a
complaint
by
person
or
body
unknown
on
the
matter
of
the
impediment
to
fish
swim
up
river
west
of
Fermoy
.
the
local
council
do
not
have
the
means
to
pay
for
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
,
which
be
protect
and
which
the
council
own
.
the
estimate
cost
of
repair
be
€
100000
.
the
Department
be
unwilling
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
repair
.
last
Christmas
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Conor
Lenihan
,
give
Fermoy
Town
Council
until
the
end
of
2010
to
repair
the
damage
fish
pass
at
Fermoy
weir
to
become
compliant
on
foot
of
the
complaint
to
the
EU
Commission
.
the
Southern
Regional
Fishery
Board
,
which
may
or
may
not
have
be
the
originator
of
the
complaint
and
which
favour
the
replacement
of
the
weir
with
a
rock
ramp
pass
,
when
ask
through
a
freedom
of
information
request
about
its
involvement
in
the
matter
inform
the
secretary
of
the
rowing
club
,
Mr.
Donal
O'Keeffe
,
that
old
file
be
destroy
in
a
flood
in
2009
.
in
the
meantime
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Conor
Lenihan
,
inform
Fermoy
Rowing
Club
last
week
that
he
be
deeply
concerned
no
progress
have
be
make
in
the
past
six
month
.
he
go
on
to
indicate
that
the
rock
ramp
would
definitely
happen
if
Fermoy
Town
Council
do
not
repair
the
fish
pass
.
when
inform
that
the
council
have
no
money
to
effect
this
repair
,
the
Minister
of
State
make
it
clear
it
be
the
duty
of
Fermoy
Town
Council
,
as
owner
of
the
weir
,
a
protect
structure
,
to
find
the
money
somewhere
.
the
minister
say
that
he
cannot
give
they
money
towards
the
cost
of
repair
to
the
fish
pass
.
however
,
the
government
,
of
which
the
minister
be
a
member
,
be
willing
spend
a
multiple
of
€
100000
in
order
to
install
a
rock
ramp
pass
at
the
behest
of
the
Southern
Regional
Fishery
Board
.
incidentally
,
there
be
no
indication
that
the
EU
Commission
have
instruct
the
government
to
install
a
rock
ramp
pass
but
it
be
satisfied
that
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
be
sufficient
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
still
do
not
know
how
many
salmon
be
move
up
river
,
because
there
be
no
fish
counter
in
Fermoy
town
.
we
all
want
to
see
fish
be
catch
on
the
rod
,
and
I
do
not
particularly
wish
to
see
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
take
the
lion
's
share
of
the
spoil
below
in
Clondulane
weir
,
but
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
a
balance
strike
between
ensure
that
fish
have
safe
passage
and
guard
the
future
of
the
rowing
club
.
let
the
government
assist
with
the
cost
of
the
repair
of
the
fish
pass
and
install
a
fish
counter
in
Fermoy
.
let
common
sense
prevail
.
what
about
the
cost
argument
?
even
minor
work
be
unaffordable
to
the
town
council
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
be
wholly
inadequate
and
quite
disingenuous
.

provide

question
.
we
have
shif
the
blame
on
to
the
manager
now
.
that
be
a
subtle
shift
in
position
.
why
not
have
a
public
inquiry
?
the
government
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
after
spend
€
22
billion
on
Anglo
Irish
Bank
.
how
many
case
have
be
try
under
that
legislation
?
that
be
only
rubbish
;
ráiméis
in

Dé
.
Fianna
Fáil
wine
and
dine
they
or
else
it
be
the
other
way
around
.
base
on
Department
of
Finance
figure
.
I
will
start
by
nail
the
lie
that
be
come
from
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
in
regard
to
the
Labour
Party
and
any
policy
it
may
or
may
not
have
.
I
invite
Deputy
McGrath
,
Collins
and
Byrne
to
take
a
look
at
the
Labour
Party
website
.
therein
they
will
see
at
least
50
position
and
policy
paper
on
a
wide
range
of
subject
from
tourism
right
through
the
economy
.
I
invite
they
,
in
particular
,
to
take
a
look
at
the
Labour
Party
proposal
on
the
creation
of
a
strategic
investment
bank
that
will
get
this
economy
up
and
run
again
.
it
will
create
wealth
and
job
and
will
be
use
in
a
manner
which
be
productive
and
will
grow
the
economy
,
through
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
and
can
be
use
effectivity
to
get
this
economy
up
and
run
again
.
I
want
to
nail
this
lie
which
be
now
emerge
from
Fianna
Fáil
that
somehow
we
be
a
party
which
be
devoid
of
policy
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
anybody
in
the
Labour
Party
who
put
they
name
to
a
ballot
paper
because
it
suggest
somehow
that
we
be
devoid
of
any
kind
of
substance
politically
before
we
ever
decide
to
enter
politics
we
have
always
be
a
policy
-
drive
party
.
I
invite
people
to
take
a
look
at
we
record
in
term
of
we
involvement
in
this
house
down
through
the
year
and
age
.
the
record
will
speak
for
itself
on
that
matter
.
when
we
be
in
government
the
people
of
this
country
will
see
that
we
will
do
we
good
for
they
and
will
not
be
pander
to
vested
interest
.
on
the
report
,
nobody
,
include
I
who
be
on
my
first
mandate
,
have
perfect
knowledge
on
the
fateful
night
of
September
on
the
government
's
position
or
the
true
picture
of
where
the
bank
stand
.
it
be
right
and
proper
that
when
we
be
legislate
in
this
house
that
every
single
deputy
who
be
give
a
mandate
in
this
House
have
perfect
knowledge
.
it
be
very
clear
now
—
we
do
not
seek
to
take
political
advantage
from
it
—
that
the
guarantee
which
be
give
on
that
night
be
too
wide
-
range
.
it
be
too
big
a
blanket
,
in
term
of
how
it
cover
the
individual
bank
.
anybody
who
examine
the
report
in
any
objective
fashion
will
see
that
it
be
too
wide
range
.
anybody
who
be
a
ordinary
decent
citizen
of
this
land
will
see
that
the
cost
of
cover
Anglo
Irish
Bank
have
be
€
22
billion
so
far
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
the
€
22
billion
spend
thus
far
be
money
that
the
next
government
will
be
down
in
term
of
be
able
to
provide
service
to
the
ordinary
decent
citizen
of
this
country
.
Fianna
Fáil
deputy
will
be
lambast
we
from
the
other
side
of
the
House
for
not
deliver
service
because
we
will
be
down
€
22
billion
.
this
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
classic
game
.
it
be
act
as
surreptitiously
as
possible
and
be
spin
the
story
that
wind
down
the
bank
in
a
orderly
manner
will
cost
a
multiple
of
€
22
billion
,
even
though
we
do
not
know
that
for
certain
.
we
want
transparency
so
that
every
citizen
,
regardless
of
he
or
she
political
affiliation
,
can
decide
whether
the
government
of
the
day
be
do
a
decent
job
.
this
independent
report
clearly
have
not
vindicate
the
government
's
position
.
they
criticism
of
past
macro-economic
policy
and
the
over
reliance
on
tax
break
be
as
clear
as
the
nose
on
my
face
.
the
bottom
line
be
good
governance
in
the
bank
,
a
proper
regulatory
framework
and
a
public
inquiry
that
allow
we
to
understand
the
relationship
between
politics
and
banking
so
that
we
can
develop
legislation
that
ensure
the
chicanery
we
have
become
use
to
over
the
past
decade
will
be
no
more
.
would
the
deputy
have
do
two

the
Labour
Party
motion
,
under
the
stewardship
of
deputy
Upton
,
seek
to
develop
Ireland
's
capacity
as
a
eco-tourism
destination
.
one
of
Ireland
's
natural
advantage
be
the
unspoiled
3500
mile
of
coastline
.
it
be
so
indented
that
one
be
never
more
than
80
mile
from
the
sea
.
add
to
this
the
800
lake
and
river
.
paddle
sport
like
sea
kayaking
and
river
kayaking
be
,
as
yet
,
a
untapped
potential
.
while
organisation
such
as
the
Irish
Sea
Kayaking
Association
,
ISKA
,
be
active
in
promote
this
sport
,
the
time
be
right
for
they
to
be
include
in
a
new
consultative
process
that
develop
capacity
in
this
area
.
we
have
underestimate
the
potential
for
eco-tourism
,
particularly
as
a
maritime
nation
.
the
report
of
the
tourism
renewal
group
recognise
the
need
for
domestic
marketing
.
it
state
:
domestic
demand
have
a
vital
role
in
help
enterprise
survive
the
current
international
downturn
and
particularly
the
current
negative
impact
of
the
sterling
exchange
rate
on
we
large
and
near
market
.
similar
argument
apply
to
the
economic
rationale
for
domestic
as
to
international
marketing
.
domestic
destination
compete
directly
with
overseas
destination
for
Irish
tourist
.
we
take
a
more
lateral
view
than
that
articulate
in
the
review
in
respect
of
the
marketing
target
.
Ireland
always
seem
to
tailor
its
product
towards
the
UK
or
North
American
market
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
that
,
in
order
to
build
the
capacity
of
the
tourism
product
,
we
must
move
away
from
the
narrow
focus
of
sell
,
for
example
,
a
weekend
by
the
lake
of
Killarney
,
although
there
be
a
market
segment
for
that
product
.
we
need
to
examine
minority
sport
such
as
kayaking
and
develop
they
into
segment
.
give
we
natural
environment
and
easy
access
to
the
sea
,
a
eco
-
tourism
product
be
there
to
be
develop
.
to
assist
this
process
,
we
must
build
a
stakeholder
model
that
allow
group
such
as
the
ISKA
,
which
have
lead
expedition
all
over
the
world
,
to
develop
a
product
to
encourage
kayaker
to
visit
this
country
.
such
organisation
have
the
necessary
contact
,
intelligence
gathering
and
viral
network
to
assist
in
create
a
domestic
and
international
product
that
will
bring
people
to
we
shore
.
I
refer
to
sea-
kayaking
but
we
can
develop
a
model
for
other
such
niche
ecotourism
product
like
surfing
,
mountaineering
and
hill
-
walking
.
the
idea
be
to
bring
this
people
in
as
part
of
the
stakeholder
process
.
this
people
have
the
necessary
contact
on
the
international
stage
.
I
have
sea-
kayake
and
go
mountaineering
in
other
part
of
the
world
.
one
do
this
through
build
up
contact
through
membership
of
various
organisation
.
we
need
to
bring
this
people
together
as
part
of
a
stakeholder
group
to
develop
the
product
domestically
and
use
that
contact
in
the
exist
marketing
framework
to
slowly
develop
the
market
we
need
in
order
to
bring
people
to
we
shore
.
this
be
take
a
more
lateral
view
of
build
product
in
niche
area
.
that
be
the
future
for
the
specific
ecotourism
product
this
country
have
the
potential
to
develop

put

ask
what
constitute

in

reply

the

state
a
emergency
be
determine
by
the
treat
clinician
,
the
contract
general
dental
practitioner
,
in
agreement
with
the
local
HSE
.
dentist
throughout

be
try

provide
emergency
treatment
under

people
with

condition
,
such
as
a
person
with
Alzheimer
's

I
be
aware
.
what
will
the
minister
do
to
ensure
vulnerable
people
will
be
able
to
avail
of
that
dental
treatment
service
?
I
call
for
a
statement
from
the
minister
or
a
debate
in
the
House
so
that
we
can
ensure
this
service
be
provide
for
vulnerable
people
.
the
minister
say
in
she
response
that
there
be
provision
for
emergency
treatment
,
but
this
treatment
be
not
be
approve
at
local
level
by
the
HSE
.
and
Fianna
Fáil
.
the
Irish
people
be
wrong
,
be
they
?
do
the
minister
of
State
include
fish
in
this
argument
?
I
ask
about
fish
because
we
be
on
a
philosophical
debate
.
be
he
not
now
run
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
hound
on
that
front
?

to
I
,
I
do
not
intend
to
go
into
some
of
the
comment
I
have
just
hear
.
I
have
no
intention
of
personalise
this
issue
even
though
people
have
refer
to
I
and
to
my
colleague
.
in
the
view
of
the
Labour
Party
,
the
bottom
line
be
whether
this
legislation
be
necessary
at
present
,
whether
it
be
purely
politically
motivate
or
whether
it
be
base
on
true
animal
welfare
.
in
2007
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Gormley
,
issue
a
licence
to
the
Ward
Union
Hunt
on
which
,
unless
I
be
mistaken
,
he
place
27
condition
.
in
2008
,
he
issue
a
licence
to
the
Ward
Union
Hunt
on
which
34
condition
be
place
.
in
2009
,
he
issue
a
licence
to
the
Ward
Union
Hunt
,
unless
I
be
mistaken
,
on
which
he
place
35
condition
.
if
one
speak
to
the
rights
of
man
,
common
sense
or
a
man
's
motivation
,
if
at
that
time
,
he
as
minister
issue
a
licence
for
that
hunt
to
proceed
,
surely
that
include
a
tacit
understanding
that
he
recognise
its
right
to
exist
as
a
hunt
?
why
be
he
now
move
,
in
2010
,
to
revoke
the
licence
?
it
be
bad
legislation
—
—
——
and
the
solution
propose
by
deputy
Higgins
in
1997
be
a
reasoned
,
rational
and
responsible
approach
.
the
absolute
fundamentalist
who
exist
within
this
Parliament
legislate
on
a
absolutist
approach
.
it
be
the
wrong
way
to
do
so
because
I
foresee
trouble
ahead
in
respect
of
this
legislation
.
it

the

to
legislate

I
propose
to
share
my
time
with
deputy
Bernard
Durkan
,
Willie
Penrose
and
Mary
O'Rourke
.
as
I
speak
on
this
issue
last
week
,
I
propose
to
yield
to
deputy
Durkan
at
this
stage
.
this
be
a
democracy
and
there
be
a
wide
range
of
view
in
we
party
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
?
do
the
minister
get
advice
from
the
Attorney
General
on
that
?
what
be
the
Attorney
General
's
advice
on
that
?
three
time
last
week
we
support
they
.
the
minister
should
get
he
fact
right
.
we
be
see
the
minister
's
true
colour
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
minister
's
amendment
no.
1
,
which
state
in
paragraph
(
2
)
that
a
person
who
hunt
deer
with
two
or
more
dog
shall
be
guilty
of
a
offence
,
but
in
paragraph
(
3
)
state
it
shall
not
be
a
offence
for
a
person
on
foot
to
hunt
deer
with
two
or
more
dog
,
under
and
in
accordance
with
section
29
and
section
42
.
to
satisfy
my
thirst
for
knowledge
on
the
minister
's
line
of
think
on
this
,
will
he
clarify
for
the
House
what
be
in
and
what
be
out
?
section
2
and
3
be
related
in
this
sense
,
beg
the
acting
Chairman
's
indulgence
.
we
want
clarification
from
the
minister
on
he
position
on
other
type
of
deer
hunting
.
what
be
on
he
mind
in
respect
of
other
type
of
deer
hunting
?
it
be
still
a
little
unclear
.
the
minister
's
own
deputy
say
that
.
that
be
a
patronising
statement
if
ever
I
hear
one
.
this
be
like
a
counselling
session
.
this
be
surreal
.
I

be
the
minister
of
State
aware
of
the
situation
with
the
Midleton
train
at
present
?
if
he
want
to
speak
authoritatively
,
he
should
check
he
fact
.
the
guideline
that
be
publish
be
only
guideline
.
when
deputy
Batt
O'Keeffe
be
Minister
of
State
in
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
he
publish
guideline
on
the
relaxation
of
rule
for
one
-
off
house
in
rural
area
.
the
guideline
that
be
issue
state
councillor
must
have
regard
to
development
plan
as
they
exist
in
local
authority
area
.
however
,
the
local
development
plan
itself
have
very
stringent
rule
and
regulation
on
green
belt
area
,
and
certain
type
of
designation
for
particular
area
which
supersede
the
guideline
themselves
.
it
do
not
make
any
change
whatsoever
to
the
number
of
one
-
off
house
build
as
a
result
of
the
publication
of
that
guideline
.
similarly
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Gormley
,
publish
guideline
last
week
—
or
give
notice
of
he
intention
to
publish
guideline
—
on
house
on
national
secondary
route
.
I
be
aware
of
three
case
of
people
who
have
a
genuine
housing
need
who
wish
to
build
on
family
own
land
on
a
national
secondary
route
.
I
have
regard
to
the
guideline
publish
by
the
minister
but
I
be
tell
by
the
local
authority
that
the
development
plan
,
which
be
adopt
by
the
member
elect
by
the
people
will
supersede
that
guideline
.
there
be
a
precedent
whereby
a
local
authority
grant
planning
on
a
national
secondary
route
and
it
be
appeal
by
the
NRA
to
a
Bord
Pleanála
in
any
case
.
the
issuance
of
guideline
be
a
bit
of
a
sham
to
be
honest
.
sometimes
,
they
be
deliberately
put
out
there
by
minister
to
give
voice
to
the
idea
that
they
be
somehow
deal
with
a
issue
.
in
reality
,
I
have
never
see
they
have
a
effect
in
how
they
be
transpose
.
the
local
development
plan
as
pass
under
a
reserve
function
always
seem
to
take
precedent
.
in
essence
,
the
point
I
be
try
to
make
be
that
if
we
further
diminish
the
power
of
local
public
representative
to
intervene
in
plan
case
or
in
the
planning
law
,
too
much
power
will
be
cede
to
the
minister
who
may
not
have
regard
to
local
factor
and
the
grey
area
that
exist
which
might
push
a
case
one
way
or
the
other
.
if
too
much
power
be
prescribe
in
a
centralised
way
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
ability
of
a
local
authority
to
function
as
it
relate
to
planning
,
and
good
planning
at
that
.
I
fail
to
understand
the
Green
Party
's
position
on
this
.
I
state
respectfully
and
without
any
malice
that
what
deputy
Gogarty
be
say
in
effect
be
that
the
gentleman
and
lady
on
local
authority
have
receive
they
democratic
mandate
from
the
people
but
the
Green
Party
do
not
trust
they
to
exercise
that
mandate
as
it
relate
to
the
planning
process
and
therefore
it
will
instigate
a
set
of
rule
and
regulation
that
will
supersede
they
power
.
by
implication
,
what
be
state
be
that
the
people
be
wrong
.
the
people
put
in
the
councillor
and
therefore
there
be
a
implication
in
the
legislation
that
the
councillor
make
mistake
and
the
Green
Party
will
come
along
and
rectify
that
mistake
in
a
condescending
and
patronising
fashion
.
it
be
no
way
to
legislate
.
it
be
not
the
way
to
legislate
.
it
absolutely
and
utterly
patronise
the
people
on
this
side
of
the
House
who
try
to
give
voice
to
that
try
to
build
house
who
have
genuine
housing
need
and
who
want
to
retain
the
right
to
live
in
they
local
community
.
they
will
not
be
here
for
too
much
long
and
thank
God
for
it
.
then
we
can
get
to
a
situation
where
the
House
will
start
legislate
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
and
not
on
the
basis
of
—
—
—
—
the
nanny
state
,
where
a
small
rump
in
the
Parliament
can
control
how
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
can
think
.
we
need
to
move
away
from
that
line
of
legislation
.
I
be
tired
of
the
Member
to
my
right
come
to
the
House
and
day
in
day
out
use
language
that
debase
this
House
.
he
may
disagree
with
my
point
of
view
and
I
may
disagree
with
the
deputy
's
point
of
view
and
we
will
spar
but
it
be
never
personal
.
however
,
with
privilege
I
stand
before
the
people
here
as
a
member
for
Cork
East
and
I
will
not
allow
other
member
to
debase
the
House
's
legislative
programme
by
impose
legislation
that
be
undemocratic
and
will
have
serious
permutation
for
how
local
authority
will
be
able
to
operate
because
it
give
too
much
power
to
the
minister
.
I
say
that
without
use
of
bad
language
,
without
debase
the
House
and
without
bring
the
debate
down
into
the
morass
to
which
other
would
like
to
bring
it
.
I
wish
to
raise
a
issue
which
I
feel
will
have
a
deep
impact
on
the
ability
of
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
deliver
acute
service
.
for
the
past
five
year
we
have
be
through
a
number
of
process
in
relation
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
include
the
Horwath
,
Wrixon
and
Teamwork
review
.
now
,
through
a
new
national
reconfiguration
process
,
the
HSE
will
seek
,
in
a
underhand
and
surreptitious
way
,
to
undermine
the
ability
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
acute
service
.
I
have
before
I
a
document
in
respect
of
this
matter
.
the
people
who
represent
the
interest
of
the
hospital
and
who
live
within
its
catchment
area
be
undergo
a
reconfiguration
process
,
head
up
by
Professor
John
Higgins
.
there
be
general
agreement
that
change
be
need
within
the
hospital
and
that
there
will
be
implication
for
the
delivery
of
acute
service
,
but
that
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
should
not
be
undermine
in
any
way
.
in
other
word
,
if
there
be
to
be
a
loss
or
diminution
of
acute
surgical
service
,
they
would
be
buttress
by
acute
medical
service
.
we
have
buy
into
that
process
and
have
be
give
assurance
in
relation
to
it
.
we
now
discover
documentation
emanate
from
the
HSE
show
that
it
seek
to
assign
to
every
hospital
in
the
country
a
new
modelling
system
range
from
1
to
4
,
depend
on
the
category
of
hospital
,
and
which
will
put
Mallow
into
the
no.
2
category
.
the
document
state
that
this
hospital
will
not
have
a
icu
so
the
patient
and
doctor
need
to
be
make
aware
that
the
resource
be
not
in
place
to
provide
the
full
spectrum
of
a
acute
hospital
resuscitation
,
that
be
,
intubation
,
ventilation
and
resuscitation
,
ivr
.
the
patient
must
give
inform
consent
and
have
knowledge
of
this
prior
to
admission
.
a
ceiling
of
care
discussion
need
to
take
place
and
be
document
with
appropriate
patient
prior
to
admission
to
this
facility
.
the
document
go
on
to
say
that
standard
of
care
should
be
measure
and
comparable
to
that
deliver
at
a
model
3
and
model
4
hospital
.
a
model
3
or
4
hospital
would
be
the
equivalent
of
Cork
University
Hospital
,
which
be
a
tertiary
centre
and
the
near
geographically
to
Mallow
.
I
demand
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Pat
Healy
,
regional
director
of
operation
for
the
HSE
south
region
.
I
demand
respectfully
,
as
be
my
right
as
a
Oireachtas
Member
,
a
meeting
with
Ms
Laverne
McGuinness
and
Mr.
Brian
Gilroy
,
who
be
in
charge
of
efficiency
,
and
I
demand
that
the
Joint
Committee
on
Health
and
Children
discuss
this
document
because
it
will
have
serious
implication
for
the
delivery
of
acute
care
.
by
a
surreptitious
and
secretive
method
,
the
HSE
will
seek
to
diminish
the
ability
of
Mallow
to
deliver
acute
care
.
if
a
ceiling
of
care
discussion
have
to
take
place
on
every
admission
,
most
people
will
not
be
admit
to
the
hospital
and
will
have
to
go
to
CUH
,
thereby
reduce
the
ability
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
to
deliver
service
.
there
be
many
scenario
where
resuscitation
might
be
appropriate
for
a
individual
on
whom
a
"
do
not
resuscitate
"
order
have
be
place
,
for
example
,
anaphylactic
reaction
to
a
infusion
.
such
a
notion
have
major
consequence
for
the
status
and
reputation
of
a
hospital
and
for
the
esteem
of
that
work
there
.
discussion
about
ceiling
of
care
as
espouse
in
this
process
be
,
in
most
clinical
situation
,
unnecessary
and
often
inappropriate
and
counter
-
productive
.
I
wonder
if
divide
patient
into
category
of
access
with
regard
to
resuscitation
be
unconstitutional
,
in
that
it
would
negate
the
rights
of
a
patient
.
number
in
the
hospital
would
be
so
reduce
that
it
would
not
be
viable
.
that
be
what
be
at
play
here
.
this
be
a
attempt
by
the
HSE
at
national
level
to
undermine
the
local
reconfiguration
process
which
all
of
the
stakeholder
have
buy
into
.
we
recognise
that
change
be
need
but
it
seem
the
HSE
be
try
push
through
a
plan
whereby
hospital
like
Mallow
will
no
long
be
able
to
provide
acute
care
,
whether
medical
or
surgical
,
and
the
4500
people
who
be
serve
in
a
acute
setting
in
Mallow
will
have
make
they
way
through
CUH
,
which
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
that
service
because
the
capital
investment
have
not
be
make
there
.
we
need
transparency
.
I
be
ask
,
as
be
my
right
as
a
Oireachtas
member
represent
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
for
a
meeting
with
the
HSE
at
national
level
so
that
I
can
learn
what
plan
be
afoot
and
what
surreptitious
method
be
be
employ
in
the
downgrade
of
hospital
like
Mallow
.
the
provision
of
a
early
start
pre-school
for
Traveller
child
would
be
contrary
to
the
recommendation
set
out
in
the
2006
Traveller
Education
Strategy
.
this
strategy
build
on
early
report
,
include
the

specifically
recommend
the

of

this
include
the

with

2010
of

the
Labour
Party
seek
,
by
way
of
amendment
,
to
ensure
the
act
do
not
apply
to
any
matter
regulate
by
the
Greyhound
Industry
Act
1958
and
1993
.
we
believe
strongly
that
if
we
be
to
support
the
Dog
breeding
Establishments
Bill
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
that
there
be
a
clear
and
unambiguous
attempt
by
the
stakeholder
in
the
greyhound
industry
in
conjunction
with
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
to
ensure
the
code
of
practice
put
in
place
to
ensure
the
welfare
of
the
greyhound
be
maintain
.
I
speak
on
behalf
of
the
small
breeder
;
this
be
the
people
I
represent
.
the
situation
at
present
be
such
that
when
one
visit
a
stud
dog
with
a
bitch
with
the
intention
of
breed
a
litter
,
the
fact
be
publicise
in
the
sport
press
immediately
.
when
pup
be
bear
one
notify
the
icc
,
Irish
Coursing
Club
,
within
14
day
.
detail
of
date
of
birth
and
size
of
litter
be
publish
in
the
sport
press
.
the
bitch
can
be
inspect
anytime
during
this
period
.
the
control
steward
inspect
the
pup
and
take
a
DNA
sample
.
at
12
week
old
,
the
control
steward
tattoo
the
full
litter
on
both
ear
;
the
left
ear
with
a
personal
identification
number
and
the
right
ear
with
the
litter
number
.
before
they
be
12
month
old
,
the
pup
be
officially
name
and
they
marking
enter
into
they
identity
card
.
this
be
the
current
procedure
as
they
stand
.
I
be
in
favour
of
field
sport
and
course
and
I
have
be
at
greyhound
meeting
.
the
people
I
represent
be
that
who
rear
pup
.
they
do
not
consider
that
the
establishment
or
kennel
they
have
be
dog
breeding
establishment
.
they
be
genuine
people
who
have
a
genuine
regard
for
field
sport
and
for
the
welfare
of
the
animal
they
keep
.
for
the
most
part
,
they
be
not
in
it
for
the
primary
motivation
of
profit
,
in
the
sense
of
develop
breeding
establishment
.
the
gain
for
such
people
be
a
potential
win
at
such
a
venue
as
Clonmel
or
Youghal
and
for
the
love
of
the
sport
.
there
be
no
fiduciary
gain
for
the
most
part
.
most
of
this
people
have
be
involved
in
the
sport
at
a
intergenerational
level
.
if
a
book
be
keep
of
they
expense
,
one
could
be
guarantee
that
they
have
make
a
loss
during
the
year
they
have
be
involved
in
the
sport
.
the
primary
motivation
be
not
profit
but
a
love
of
the
pursuit
of
the
sport
.
it
be
genuine
and
integral
for
this
people
.
it
be
a
affront
to
insult
this
people
with
some
of
the
language
I
have
hear
from
various
side
of
the
House
and
we
must
speak
for
they
.
we
wish
to
speak
for
they
in
a
modest
and
reasonable
way
.
what
be
the
current
state
of
negotiation
between
the
Minister
's
Department
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
if
there
be
such
negotiation
,
regard
pend
legislation
?
be
there
a
timeframe
?
be
there
head
of
a
Bill
for
amend
legislation
?
what
be
the
status
of
the
propose
amendment
to
the
1958
Act
?
there
have
not
be
enough
clarity
on
that
.
we
be
be
ask
to
pass
legislation
on
the
basis
of
a
leap
of
faith
.
in
essence
,
a
greyhound
owner
look
at
the
legislation
who
have
not
be
in
touch
with
the
icc
or
Bord
to
gcon
in
the
past
number
of
week
would
not
be
aware
of
what
negotiation
have
take
place
.
therefore
,
there
be
still
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
proposal
.
if
member
be
be
ask
to
pass
this
legislation
,
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
the
substantive
nature
of
that
negotiation
,
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
outcome
of
that
deliberation
,
and
if
we
be
to
have
regard
and
to
have
trust
in
the
minister
or
the
government
of
the
day
to
deliver
the
right
kind
of
amendment
to
the
1958
Act
.
we
be
try
to
clear
the
way
in
respect
of
the
body
of
animal
welfare
legislation
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
agree
with
we
line
of
question
in
that
we
be
merely
seek
clarification
.
we
seek
clarification
on
the
negotiation
with
the
icc
and
Bord
to
gCon
regard
the
role
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
vis-à
-
vo
the
amend
1958
legislation
.
the
second
point
concern
how
specifically
that
act
will
be
amend
.
the
animal
welfare
Bill
be
under
the
auspices
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
on
no
few
than
ten
occasion
,
the
Labour
Party
have
ask
the
Taoiseach
when
that
legislation
will
be
publish
.
we
do
not
have
a
Bill
before
we
even
though
we
be
tell
it
will
be
publish
in
the
autumn
.
if
this
be
on
the
C
list
of
the
government
's
legislative
programme
,
where
be
the
balance
of
priority
and
how
do
the
minister
envisage
its
implementation
?
will
legislation
enact
now
be
supersede
by
that
legislation
or
be
it
separate
?
it
be
very
confusing
.
I
be
relatively
new
to
this
game
but
I
be
try
to
speak
with
common
sense
.
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
all
I
seek
from
he
be
some
clear
unambiguous
answer
to
which
member
be
entitle
.
the
minister
should
be
ministerial
.
the
minister
should
behave
with
the
appropriate
level
of
decorum
and
should
not
behave
like
a
schoolboy
.
the
minister
should
cut
to
the
chase
.
perhaps
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
should
be
bring
in
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
the
Minister
's
second
stage
speech
where
he
state
:
I
have
also
state
that
I
understand
the
legitimate
concern
of
certain
industry
sector
,
such
as
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
,
and
I
be
prepared
to
accommodate
they
as
good
I
can
.
for
that
reason
it
be
propose
that
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
would
amend
the
Greyhound
Industry
Act
1958
to
legislate
for
welfare
provision
for
member
of
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
.
we
note
the
word
"
welfare
provision
"
.
give
that
the
minister
have
state
that
it
be
not
possible
to
give
a
indication
today
of
what
will
be
in
the
amend
legislation
,
which
we
accept
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
be
no
ambiguity
and
so
that
the
greyhound
industry
be
not
place
in
a
position
where
it
be
take
a
giant
leap
of
faith
in
term
of
what
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
might
offer
by
way
of
the
amend
legislation
,
we
propose
a
amendment
that
would
make
it
clear
and
unambiguous
as
to
where
the
minister
's
intention
lie
.
if
he
be
to
support
the
amendment
that
would
give
great
solace
to
the
Irish
Greyhound
Board
,
the
Irish
Coursing
Club
and
to
every
single
dog
owner
throughout
the
country
who
course
hare
or
race
greyhound
in
such
place
as
Curraheen
Park
and
Youghal

on
9
August
,
when
the
Dáil
be
in
recess
,
HIQA
announce
a
investigation
into
ongoing
service
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
tonight
I
want
to
put
forward
the
view
of
that
I
represent
who
have
a
particular
interest
in
the
investigation
and
who
feel
strongly
that
it
be
spurious
and
unnecessary
.
the
investigation
be
announce
on
the
basis
of
a
specific
complaint
about
procedure
from
someone
at
the
hospital
.
we
now
know
that
be
not
the
case
,
and
know
there
be
no
specific
incident
related
to
the
treatment
of
a
person
.
we
also
know
the
investigation
arise
from
the
fact
that
in
April
2009
,
HIQA
publish
the
report
of
the
investigation
into
the
quality
and
safety
or
service
in
Ennis
,
that
there
would
be
recommendation
arise
from
that
,
and
that
a
report
would
follow
for
Mallow
,
which
be
a
similar
hospital
but
that
have
never
be
put
forward
by
the
HSE
.
it
be
on
foot
of
that
alone
that
HIQA
decide
to
go
into
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
the
process
at
present
be
that
HIQA
have
meet
representative
of
the
hospital
and
the
staff
and
be
continue
its
investigation
.
the
staff
at
the
hospital
operate
in
constrain
circumstance
and
be
punch
above
they
weight
.
in
June
,
after
many
year
of
campaigning
,
a
executive
management
board
be
finally
put
in
place
.
the
hospital
be
under
the
auspices
of
CUH
but
for
year
it
be
leave
on
its
own
,
devoid
of
support
from
the
large
hospital
.
I
will
bet
money
that
when
the
report
be
publish
,
it
will
clearly
show
that
the
staff
and
personnel
at
the
hospital
have
deliver
,
in
spite
of
the
HSE
bear
down
on
they
while
refuse
to
put
in
place
adequate
funding
.
this
report
will
vindicate
the
doctor
,
nurse
and
other
staff
in
the
hospital
by
show
they
be
in
no
way
negligent
and
be
do
more
than
they
should
to
deliver
service
.
it
will
also
show
that
management
structure
be
inadequate
and
the
HSE
never
properly
resource
the
administrative
function
at
the
hospital
,
which
lead
to
inadequacy
in
term
of
report
procedure
.
it
will
also
show
that
CUH
never
adequately
recognise
Mallow
for
the
facility
it
be
as
part
of
its
operation
.
I
want
to
point
out
that
the
staff
support
the
hospital
and
maintain
that
service
can
be
modify
.
they
be
willing
to
work
with
the
HSE
to
achieve
that
and
doctor
,
nurse
and
staff
will
buy
into
the
change
management
process
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
reduce
service
facility
,
however
,
or
to
see
the
hospital
's
capacity
be
sacrifice
on
the
HSE
's
altar
of
cost
efficiency
.
this
be
key
because
we
will
modify
service
but
we
must
not
reduce
capacity
.
we
can
deliver
the
service
within
the
hospital
but
we
must
be
give
the
opportunity
to
do
so
.

early
today
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
state
the
follow
:
today
,
we
have
be
give
more
bad
news
about
the
two
institution
to
which
I
refer
.
the
Financial
Times
state
that
the
cost
in
respect
of
Anglo
Irish
Bank
will
be
€35
billion
and
€
5
billion
for
the
tiny
building
society
that
be
know
as
Irish
nationwide
.
that
be
the
pass
to
which
the
minister
and
he
leader
,
the
Taoiseach
,
have
bring
this
country
.
today
be
black
Thursday
and
the
minister
and
he
party
,
Fianna
Fáil
,
will
be
remember
for
visit
it
upon
this
country
.
I
be
a
optimistic
person
by
nature
.
I
come
into
this
House
in
2007
as
a
Opposition
deputy
.
when
my
party
,
the
Labour
Party
,
be
elect
to
govern
this
country
,
how
will
we
get
it
out
of
the
economic
maelstrom
in
which
we
find
ourselves
?
to
say
it
will
be
a
herculean
task
be
to
put
it
mildly
.
I
listen
intently
to
the
contribution
from
the
Fianna
Fáil
side
of
the
House
,
which
look
backwards
in
they
analysis
of
the
situation
.
they
do
not
give
I
grounds
for
optimism
.
it
be
especially
disheartening
to
hear
someone
of
my
own
generation
,
deputy
Thomas
Byrne
,
seek
to
undermine
the
Labour
Party
as
part
of
he
contribution
to
a
debate
on
the
financial
institution
as
they
be
now
.
when
the
deputy
refer
to
Labour
's
2007
manifesto
and
the
promise
or
aspiration
contain
therein
,
he
neglect
to
mention
that
that
promise
and
aspiration
be
base
on
figure
that
be
then
in
the
public
domain
.
the
figure
to
which
I
refer
be
provide
by
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
plan
in
the
manifesto
be
cost
in
respect
of
the
economic
climate
that
obtain
at
that
time
.
it
be
not
credible
for
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
to
attack
the
Labour
Party
for
what
have
happen
in
the
past
two
year
,
even
if
do
so
be
part
of
some
defence
mechanism
.
I
have
state
publicly
on
previous
occasion
that
I
have
a
great
regard
for
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Mansergh
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
depth
of
knowledge
he
possess
and
the
value
he
espouse
.
however
,
the
Minister
of
State
indicate
early
that
because
Madame
Christine
Lagarde
have
bestow
she
imprimatur
on
the
strategy
that
have
be
adopt
,
this
be
somehow
a
justification
—
—
—
—
for
that
strategy
.
Madame
Lagarde
be
representative
of
the
centre
right
in
France
and
be
a
member
of
President
Sarkozy
's
government
.
I
would
not
be
look
to
France
in
search
of
a
degree
of
comfort
or
solace
with
regard
to
this
country
's
current
economic
position
.
we
be
,
however
,
very
fortunate
that
we
be
part
of
the
European
Union
and
that
we
have
access
to
the
European
Central
Bank
,
ECB
.
I
suspect
the
latter
shore
up
we
position
in
respect
of
the
bond
issue
in
recent
week
.
I
would
be
anxious
to
discover
the
degree
to
which
the
ECB
interven
in
this
regard
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
this
be
a
black
day
.
however
,
I
be
move
to
state
that
I
be
of
a
generation
that
benefit
from
the
fact
that
,
socially
,
politically
and
economically
,
Ireland
look
outwards
during
the
1980
and
1990
.
we
draw
economic
strength
from
the
pooling
of
sovereignty
that
occur
with
we
European
neighbour
at
that
time
.
as
a
result
of
this
,
people
of
my
generation
benefit
by
be
able
to
travel
,
obtain
a
education
and
gain
proper
employment
.
in
the
late
1990
and
early
2000s
,
however
,
we
think
we
could
go
it
alone
.
we
become
extremely
greedy
and
selfish
and
begin
to
look
inwards
again
.
in
order
to
claw
we
way
out
of
the
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
we
will
be
oblige
to
look
outwards
once
again
.
we
must
work
with
we
European
neighbour
in
order
to
find
solution
to
the
economic
problem
that
exist
.
I
sit
the
leave
certificate
in
1991
.
I
be
of
the
generation
which
benefit
from
the
abolition
of
university
fee
.
many
of
the
other
member
of
my
generation
who
also
benefit
in
this
way
travel
the
world
for
a
number
of
year
and
return
to
Ireland
when
the
economic
climate
appear
bright
.
this
people
,
some
of
whom
be
friend
of
mine
,
get
married
,
have
child
and
buy
house
for
astronomical
price
.
it
be
we
generation
that
will
be
oblige
to
pay
for
the
profligacy
and
disastrous
economic
policy
prefer
by
the
so
-
call
Republican
party
.
if
it
be
give
the
opportunity
to
govern
,
the
Labour
Party
,
and
people
of
my
generation
,
will
get
we
out
of
the
morass
to
which
I
refer
.
in
the
past
it
be
the
Labour
Party
which
make
the
ultimate
sacrifice
.
during
previous
period
of
severe
economic
difficulty
,
it
be
my
party
which
take
the
tough
decision
that
be
necessary
to
place
the
country
back
on
a
even
keel
.
the
country
have
be
hole
below
the
water
line
but
we
be
not
beat
yet
.
I
refuse
to
be
beat
.
I
be
of
that
generation
of
politician
whose
member
will
be
oblige
to
look
not
two
or
three
but
rather
20
year
hence
in
order
to
identify
how
we
want
we
society
to
develop
.
we
will
be
oblige
to
set
down
a
formula
to
achieve
we
goal
in
this
regard
.
the
figure
that
emerge
early
today
mean
the
next
government
,
of
which
I
be
sure
Labour
will
be
a
part
,
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
context
of
be
able
to
repair
the
damage
that
have
be
do
.
that
be
a
message
which
must
be
put
across
.
we
will
not
give
up
on
the
Irish
people
.
although
there
be
a
air
of
despair
and
depression
in
this
Parliament
today
,
I
can
inform
the
Minister
of
State
that
we
will
fight
with
every
fibre
of
we
being
in
order
to
try
to
claw
we
way
out
of
we
current
difficulty
.
the
Irish
people
will
do
so
because
they
be
resourceful
.
deputy
Quinn
refer
to
the
time
he
spend
as
minister
for
Finance
.
when
it
be
once
again
in
government
,
the
Labour
Party
will
work
to
claw
the
country
out
of
the
mess
in
which
it
currently
find
itself
.
we
may
,
as
in
the
past
,
pay
the
ultimate
price
by
lose
the
general
election
which
follow
.
however
,
we
will
do
what
be
necessary
because
we
be
patriot
.
we
will
not
do
what
be
require
for
personal
gain
,
we
will
do
it
because
we
believe
in
this
country
and
its
people
.
it
will
take
a
great
deal
of
time
to
do
what
need
to
be
do
.
a
message
must
be
send
to
the
people
that
it
will
be
the
Labour
Party
that
will
rectify
the
problem
cause
by
the
policy
that
be
follow
during
the
past
13
year
.
it
will
not
be
easy
and
the
people
know
that
.
what
citizen
want
be
some
honesty
.
if
the
Labour
Party
be
honest
and
state
that
the
next
five
year
be
go
to
be
tough
but
that
there
will
be
a
point
below
which
no
citizen
will
be
permit
to
fall
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
the
people
will
give
we
the
chance
to
do
what
be
require
.
that
be
all
we
be
seek
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
a
article
by
Colm
Keena
in
the
Irish
Times
on
21
September
.
Mr.
Keena
report
that
:
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
have
indicate
he
believe
the
December
budget
should
involve
a
package
of
cut
in
excess
of
€
3
billion
so
Ireland
can
keep
reduce
its
deficit
on
track
.
Prof
Patrick
Honohan
say
yesterday
the
government
's
multi-year
plan
for
reduce
the
deficit
need
"
explicit
reprogramming
"
and
this
be
"
clearly
necessary
soon
"
.
he
do
not
want
to
go
into
detail
for
any
give
year
,
but
there
be
a
overall
need
for
reprogramming
...
if
the
economy
stay
on
track
with
what
have
be
initially
envisage
,
the
deficit
would
come
close
to
3
per
cent
by
2014
.
"
but
as
the
IMF
and
other
have
note
,
the
real
economy
,
the
price
level
and
interest
rate
on
government
borrowing
have
evolve
in
a
less
favourable
way
.
service
of
the
additional
debt
related
to
bank
restructuring
be
also
a
negative
factor
.
"
with
the
passage
of
time
,
one
come
to
learn
what
be
mean
when
language
be
use
in
a
certain
way
.
the
term
"
explicit
programming
"
be
code
for
state
that
a
deficit
target
of
3
%
by
2014
be
just
not
tenable
.
that
be
particularly
true
in
light
of
the
figure
produce
today
.
where
do
this
leave
we
?
deputy
Coveney
bring
some
degree
of
realism
to
the
debate
by
outline
a
agree
approach
in
term
of
how
we
might
proceed
.
I
be
sure
the
deputy
's
thought
in
this
regard
be
base
on
he
experience
as
a
mep
.
in
Europe
,
programme
be
multi-annual
in
nature
and
there
be
a
political
consensus
in
respect
of
they
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
European
partner
will
allow
for
the
fact
that
the
banking
crisis
have
cost
we
so
much
that
any
servicing
of
a
deficit
or
any
stimulus
package
will
be
a
major
challenge
and
that
we
need
some
degree
of
stability
and
political
consensus
as
to
how
that
might
be
reach
.
a
election
tomorrow
morning
would
clear
the
air
and
allow
for
a
alternative
government
to
be
able
to
tell
the
people
that
we
be
start
on
a
new
footing
.
we
could
also
say
to
we
partner
in
the
European
Union
and
the
European
Commission
that
there
be
a
new
impetus
as
to
how
we
can
get
ourselves
out
of
the
mess
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
but
that
it
might
take
long
than
the
period
envisage
in
the
target
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
less
than
the
3
%
by
2014
.
Ireland
be
a
test
bed
and
there
be
no
paradigm
for
where
we
be
at
the
moment
.
nobody
in
Europe
can
judge
how
this
will
pan
out
.
it
would
be
fundamentally
dishonest
for
I
as
a
representative
of
the
people
of
Cork
East
to
say
that
I
know
exactly
what
the
answer
be
because
I
do
not
.
I
be
try
to
grapple
with
this
figure
and
it
be
impossible
.
it
would
be
wrong
of
I
to
claim
there
be
a
model
for
where
Ireland
be
now
,
which
be
why
we
need
to
work
outwardly
and
why
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
will
ultimately
be
we
saviour
.
many
of
my
fellow
citizen
would
claim
that
some
of
the
blame
for
this
should
be
lay
at
the
door
of
Europe
.
when
people
speak
of
Europe
they
do
so
as
a
concept
that
be
somehow
out
there
,
but
we
be
Europe
.
while
we
may
be
on
the
periphery
geographically
,
we
be
part
of
that
decision
-
making
process
and
we
may
need
more
help
from
we
European
neighbour
to
ensure
that
we
can
rebuild
from
the
ash
of
a
republic
that
be
in
a
terrible
state
at
the
moment
.
I
believe
in
this
republic
and
that
we
can
find
a
way
out
of
this
.
we
must
not
be
afraid
to
take
tough
decision
to
ensure
we
citizen
have
some
hope
for
the
future
.
we
should
not
give
up
or
give
in
to
a
body
such
as
the
IMF
.
we
sovereignty
must
mean
something
more
than
just
a
economic
value
.
we
need
to
recreate
the
value
system
or
go
back
to
previous
value
system
we
have
in
this
country
and
work
in
partnership
with
we
European
Union
neighbour
to
look
outwardly
for
some
solution
to
the
problem
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
now
that
the
banking
system
have
be
bring
into
temporary
public
ownership
it
need
to
go
through
a
major
overhaul
.
the
culture
that
exist
,
which
have
not
change
since
September
2008
,
must
be
revisit
.
if
the
guarantee
that
be
provide
in
2008
have
not
change
the
banking
culture
and
people
in
the
real
economy
be
still
suffer
owe
to
lack
of
credit
,
then
give
that
we
have
take
this
bank
into
temporary
public
ownership
we
should
do
whatever
we
deem
necessary
on
behalf
of
the
people
to
ensure
that
bank
be
function
as
they
should
and
we
should
make
no
apology
for
that
.
we
have
be
too
deferential
to
the
banking
mogul
here
.
I
have
search
the
Statute
Book
to
ascertain
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
bring
this
guy
out
in
handcuffs
and
do
the
perp
walk
as
famously
mention
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Gormley
.
I
know
a
change
in
the
constitution
and
a
change
in
law
would
be
require
to
effect
that
.
how
many
of
they
have
be
arrest
and
bring
before
the
court
for
threaten
the
very
sovereignty
of
the
State
?
the
silver
-
haired
fox
in
the
Department
of
Finance
and
that
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
side
of
the
House
have
leave
the
people
of
my
generation
and
the
people
of
the
generation
to
come
after
I
with
a
albatross
of
debt
around
they
neck
.
Fianna
Fáil
politician
have
the
temerity
to
come
out
and
attack
the
Labour
Party
.
what
be
patriotism
?
they
be
not
patriot
and
never
be
.
they
be
self
-
interested
and
always
be
.
now
be
the
time
for
patriotism
and
for
honesty
in
order
to
restore
this
republic
and
give
it
some
sense
of
dignity
.
in
ainm
Dé
the
government
should
get
out
of
here
and
go
,
and
give
we
a
chance
to
rule
the
country
.

the
motion
speak
to
the
very
notion
of
capacity
and
that
there
will
be
no
further
loss
of
capacity
.
we
support
that
very
notion
.
in
regard
to
the
reconfiguration
process
,
in
particular
as
it
pertain
to
hospital
such
as
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
there
be
often
the
accusation
that
we
be
be
overtly
parochial
.
it
must
be
remember
that
a
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
will
serve
more
than
100000
people
and
will
have
approximately
100
gps
refer
to
it
.
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
under
the
umbrella
of
Cork
University
Hospital
but
there
be
a
deficiency
in
that
Cork
University
Hospital
have
never
view
Mallow
General
Hospital
as
be
under
its
umbrella
or
its
ambit
.
the
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
be
in
the
hospital
currently
.
a
case
be
be
make
in
regard
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
by
all
of
the
stakeholder
,
include
the
hospital
representative
group
,
the
gps
and
the
consultant
,
that
we
will
accept
change
.
we
accept
change
management
and
that
there
be
budgetary
constraint
but
we
want
a
more
lateral
view
to
be
take
by
the
HSE
in
regard
to
the
future
capacity
of
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
we
will
accept
change
in
regard
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
but
one
can
do
that
and
save
money
without
reduce
capacity
.
what
be
need
be
for
the
sister
hospital
,
Cork
University
Hospital
,
and
the
HSE
to
think
more
laterally
about
how
they
deploy
resource
from
the
centre
to
the
margin
to
serve
this
community
such
that
one
do
not
have
a
bottleneck
effect
,
that
be
,
a
reduction
of
capacity
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
filter
through
to
Cork
University
Hospital
and
thereby
undermine
the
capacity
which
will
not
be
there
because
the
budgetary
provision
will
not
be
make
to
allow
for
increase
capacity
at
Cork
University
Hospital
.
we
speak
common
sense
.
large
swathe
of
the
population
be
serve
by
the
hospital
mention
in
the
motion
.
we
note
that
Mallow
General
Hospital
be
not
mention
in
the
Fine
Gael
motion
but
I
be
sure
that
be
a
oversight
on
its
part
.
we
speak
for
that
hospital
and
support
the
motion
in
that
regard
.

can
the

indicate
when

I
find
it
strange
that
it
be
not
possible
to
indicate
the
position
with
that
Bill
because
commitment
be
give
on
this
legislation
.
there

who
be
party
to

they
face
a
nightmare
in

of

could
time
be

available
to
the
House
to
discuss
this
issue
because
many
of
the
scheme
be
underperfor
?
this
be
a
vital
issue
so
we
should
arrange
a
debate
in
this
house

a
discussion
with
the
Pension
Board
on
the
funding
of
that
scheme
.
the
main
objective
of

I
be
pleased
with
the
progress
to
date
under
the
RDP
,
which
continue
to
facilitate
access
to
significant
financial
resource
for

and
there
be
no
question
of

currently
have
register

activity
of
€
71
million
,
with
almost
€
30
million
at

amount
to
almost
€
47
million

diverse
range
of
project

build
and
maintenance
of
community
infrastructure
and
the
provision
of

in
a
variety
of
discipline
for
rural

.
I
be
confident
that
all
of
the
activity
fund

be
contribute
to
the
creation
of
the
right
condition
for

the
sun
may
be
shine
in
Castletown
—
—
—
—
but
I
know
other
businesspeople
who
be
be
put
to
the
pin
of
they
collar
by
the
Revenue
commissioner
and
other
agency
of
the
State
whereby
if
—
—
I
apologise
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
I
forget
to
ask
if
I
could
share
my
time
with
Deputy
Morgan
,
Penrose
and
Upton
.
I
be
aware
of
business
in
the
small
to
medium
-
size
enterprise
sector
which
have
the
ability
to
trade
they
way
out
of
they
difficulty
,
some
of
which
have
already
reach
agreement
with
Revenue
on
excise
,
vat
return
,
income
tax
etc.
,
but
now
find
that
some
of
the
agency
of
the
State
,
include
Revenue
,
because
there
be
such
a
clamour
to
get
money
in
,
be
change
that
term
somewhat
.
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
examine
.
the
motion
refer
to
the
sme
sector
,
the
loan
guarantee
etc
.
however
,
we
need
to
look
to
the
wide
aspect
and
the
potential
of
the
SME
sector
within
the
economy
.
where
Revenue
be
now
put
the
squeeze
on
business
that
have
the
capability
to
trade
they
way
out
of
difficulty
,
we
respectfully
suggest
there
might
be
some
word
from
some
minister
to
suggest
to
Revenue
that
while
it
will
get
the
tax
due
and
every
person
will
maintain
he
or
she
responsibility
for
that
,
it
should
be
more
relaxed
in
lengthen
the
term
so
that
some
of
this
business
be
not
put
out
of
business
for
want
of
good
term
from
Revenue
and
other
State
agency
.
while
it
be
say
there
be
a
oversupply
of
house
in
the
market
,
at
the
same
time
some
business
be
still
willing
to
build
house
because
there
be
still
a
demand
by
people
,
in
rural
area
in
particular
,
who
want
to
build
,
for
example
,
one
-
off
house
on
family
-
own
land
or
in
locality
with
which
they
have
a
connection
.
many
people
of
my
generation
who
have
receive
mortgage
approval
be
find
that
such
approval
last
for
only
three
month
.
however
,
a
small
building
company
cannot
operate
on
the
basis
that
someone
have
approval
for
only
three
month
.
extend
the
approval
to
six
or
nine
month
would
also
help
small
building
firm
,
most
of
which
be
family
-
own
and
intergenerational
,
to
get
up
and
run
.
it
be
a
case
of
look
at
thing
more
laterally
.
I
would
also
like
to
concentrate
on
the
issue
of
the
regulatory
burden
ascribe
to
the
small
to
medium
-
size
enterprise
sector
.
on
2
June
,
Mr.
Seán
Gorman
,
chairman
of
the
high
-
level
group
on
business
regulation
at
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
Innovation
,
attend
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
to
discuss
the
work
of
the
group
in
identify
way
to
reduce
the
administrative
burden
on
business
arise
from
regulation
.
the
high
-
level
group
be
establish
in
2007
to
act
as
the
fulcrum
which
government
,
business
and
union
could
tackle
issue
such
as
administrative
burden
and
red
tape
issue
,
and
propose
simplification
procedure
to
reduce
sme
's
cost
burden
.
accord
to
the
term
of
reference
of
the
group
as
elucidate
by
Mr.
Gorman
"
its
remit
be
to
identify
the
administrative
burden
place
on
business
,
in
particular
small
and
medium
-
sized
enterprise
,
arise
from
regulation
or
other
administrative
requirement
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
taxation
;
health
and
safety
regulation
;
employment
law
;
environmental
regulation
;
company
law
and
statistical
return
;
to
determine
way
to
reduce
and
simplify
administrative
burden
and
to
eliminate
they
where
they
be
unnecessary
.
"
the
bottom
line
for
the
group
be
to
reduce
the
paperwork
associate
with
regulation
,
and
simplify
and
streamline
the
information
flow
between
business
and
government
.
the
question
for
the
group
be
whether
it
have
achieve
its
aim
and
whether
adequate
resource
be
attribute
to
this
task
.
since
2008
the
CSO
,
in
co-operation
with
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
Innovation
,
have
adopt
its
standard
cost
model
to
compare
the
result
.
Mr.
Steve
MacFeely
of
the
CSO
,
who
also
address
the
committee
that
day
,
state
:
previously
we
have
be
use
the
EUROSTAT
recommend
methodology
.
the
standard
cost
model
measure
the
burden
in
term
of
money
rather
than
time
.
from
that
study
,
we
estimate
that
the
CSO
impose
a
burden
of
approximately
€
10
million
per
annum
on
Irish
business
.
that
account
for
about
0.5
%
of
total
regulatory
burden
and
be
consistent
with
finding
in
other
country
.
compare
with
the
figure
for
bank
bailout
etc.
,
€
10
million
be
probably
minuscule
.
for
a
small
business
,
however
,
perhaps
a
sole
trader
or
a
business
employ
few
than
five
people
,
reduce
that
kind
of
cost
would
increase
turnover
and
should
be
consider
.
the
Labour
Party
would
seek
to
address
the
baseline
target
.
if
the
target
be
a
reduction
of
25
%
by
2012
,
it
would
appear
there
be
not
enough
departmental
staff
to
deal
with
the
high
-
level
group
aspiration
adequately
to
move
forward
the
agenda
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
any
target
have
be
reach
to
date
in
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
for
small
business
.
a
new
political
impetus
should
drive
this
agenda
and
no
more
lip
service
should
be
pay
to
reduce
the
cost
burden
.
the
government
have
sign
up
to
a
EU
target
in
this
respect
.
the
challenge
face
we
now
,
give
that
this
process
start
in
1999
and
have
be
through
two
transition
,
be
that
we
be
in
a
economic
downturn
.
there
be
a
serious
urgency
about
this
because
of
the
cost
implication
for
that
same
business
.
there
be
a
25
%
target
for
2012
but
it
must
be
remember
that
the
SME
sector
be
under
significant
pressure
.
we
clearly
should
have
have
a
yearly
target
.
the
high
-
level
group
have
meet
only
five
time
in
2009
and
if
the
need
to
reduce
the
regulation
burden
on
business
be
critical
then
the
group
should
meet
monthly
.
this
be
a
view
that
be
propose
by
deputy
Kieran
O'Donnell
when
the
high
-
level
group
appear
before
the
committee
.
the
group
be
examine
five
key
area
where
business
have
state
they
have
issue
.
this
include
the
burden
of
comply
with
tax
law
,
health
and
safety
,
employment
law
and
environmental
regulation
.
the
fifth
area
be
company
law
and
the
related
area
of
statistical
return
.
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
economic
and
Regulatory
affair
,
I
question
the
high
-
level
group
on
the
cost
burden
arise
from
the
work
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
.
I
do
so
on
the
basis
that
we
want
the
cost
of
health
and
safety
measure
reduce
without
compromise
the
safety
of
worker
.
on
health
and
safety
,
the
administrative
cost
associate
with
the
IO
/
20
risk
assessment
be
€
167
million
,
and
€
146
million
for
the
io
/
13
safety
statement
.
as
a
percentage
of
the
overall
cost
burden
,
this
amount
to
51
%
and
44
%
,
respectively
.
how
,
in
practical
term
,
be
it
propose
to
reduce
the
burden
of
this
two
area
by
25
%
by
the
end
of
2012
?
I
be
somewhat
sceptical
about
the
target
be
reach
.
it
need
a
new
political
impetus
.
what
I
be
say
do
not
necessarily
speak
to
the
motion
,
but
in
term
of
the
spirit
of
the
motion
and
give
some
kind
of
a
fillip
and
assistance
to
the
SME
sector
,
we
also
need
to
review
the
regulatory
burden
the
sector
be
face
.

the
Labour
Party
welcome
the
proposal
contain
in
food
harvest
2020
and
that
eminent
person
such
as
Seán
Brady
chair
the
group
that
comprise
a
wide
array
of
stakeholder
involve
in
the
agrifood
,
fishery
and
forestry
sector
.
the
report
be
worthy
of
support
in
that
its
key
action
recognise
the
need
to
ensure
the
maximum
possible
resource
be
employ
to
drive
a
export
-
lead
economic
recovery
and
the
development
of
a
smart
economy
.
there
be
a
sense
in
which
food
and
the
agrifood
sector
have
take
a
back
seat
in
the
past
20
year
because
of
the
government
's
blind
faith
in
the
construction
industry
.
I
be
glad
this
rearguard
action
have
come
at
a
time
when
there
be
a
latent
realisation
that
agriculture
be
vital
to
the
country
's
need
and
its
future
development
.
the
report
's
aspiration
be
a
return
to
basic
with
clear
target
and
a
vision
set
out
.
the
agrifood
sector
have
see
a
shift
over
the
past
several
year
from
commodity
-
base
supply
to
a
brand
-
cent
and
consumer
-
focus
approach
.
that
,
in
itself
,
present
challenge
.
how
will
we
ensure
the
shift
from
a
commodity
-
base
supply
to
add
gross
value
to
food
produce
?
the
government
's
claim
that
the
smart
economy
will
be
the
foundation
for
economic
renewal
be
still
nebulous
.
one
can
apply
smart
economy
principle
to
the
idea
of
food
and
food
production
but
it
need
to
be
flesh
out
more
.
the
food
harvest
2020
report
point
out
the
smart
economy
will
ensure
the
primary
producer
will
have
high
value
output
and
reduce
cost
while
maintain
high
productivity
.
it
also
claim
the
food
industry
will
have
more
target
research
and
development
component
,
will
collaborate
more
and
will
respond
to
the
market
in
a
more
enhance
fashion
.
this
be
wonderful
term
which
I
would
readily
endorse
but
how
will
this
all
happen
?
there
should
be
a
follow
-
up
document
to
flesh
out
this
language
,
which
be
a
little
too
nebulous
.
there
should
also
be
concrete
action
plan
for
implement
the
policy
,
if
we
be
to
support
it
.
we
support
the
aspiration
in
the
document
.
from
a
consumer
's
point
of
view
,
the
smart
economy
can
facilitate
a
more
inform
choice
and
lead
to
more
innovative
product
range
.
there
must
also
be
a
educational
component
in
the
policy
.
when
we
talk
about
the
smart
approach
,
we
must
include
a
great
partnership
between
industry
and
science
,
foster
the
entrepreneurial
culture
and
innovation
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
agrifood
sector
's
position
within
the
smart
economy
be
recognise
and
act
on
in
real
term
.
the
Labour
Party
agree
that
we
have
a
opportunity
in
this
policy
document
to
deepen
the
link
with
green
issue
.
we
natural
environment
and
the
fact
that
we
have
a
grass
-
base
agricultural
system
comprise
one
of
we
great
comparative
advantage
,
but
the
mere
recognition
of
this
fact
be
not
sufficient
.
we
must
develop
a
deep
approach
to
what
it
mean
.
we
talk
about
Ireland
be
a
green
country
and
the
opportunity
arise
from
that
comparative
advantage
,
but
how
do
we
take
that
aspiration
forward
?
the
opportunity
arise
from
the
green
economy
be
clear
from
the
point
of
view
of
primary
producer
,
the
food
industry
,
consumer
and
the
country
.
there
be
very
transparent
method
of
production
and
full
traceability
in
food
production
.
this
should
be
a
comparative
advantage
relative
to
third
country
that
be
try
to
export
into
the
European
Union
.
the
fact
that
it
be
a
grass
-
base
agricultural
system
mean
we
have
natural
resource
benefit
,
as
outline
in
the
document
,
but
a
great
role
for
agriculture
in
the
economic
recovery
require
that
European
Union
funding
for
that
aim
be
enhance
or
at
least
preserve
at
current
level
.
we
welcome
the
document
and
the
global
context
outline
in
it
.
there
will
be
massive
demand
for
food
due
to
population
growth
.
as
the
document
state
,
the
world
's
population
in
1999
pass
the
6
billion
threshold
and
be
due
to
reach
7
billion
in
2010
.
by
2025
,
it
be
expect
to
reach
8
billion
.
that
present
a
massive
opportunity
for
this
country
.
give
the
increase
desertification
due
to
climate
change
in
other
region
and
peripheral
nation
,
Ireland
's
grass
-
base
agriculture
should
mean
it
be
well
place
to
benefit
,
particularly
within
the
dairy
sector
where
we
anticipate
Ireland
become
a
major
global
player
.
when
we
consider
the
dairy
sector
we
traditionally
think
of
brand
such
as
Kerrygold
.
Liquid
milk
be
a
major
commodity
but
the
cap
proposal
that
be
due
to
be
publish
in
November
by
the
European
Commission
will
pose
a
threat
to
the
national
envelope
of
approximately
€
1.3
billion
that
Ireland
receive
.
if
there
be
a
reduction
in
that
budget
,
it
could
cause
challenge
for
the
dairy
sector
and
undermine
the
policy
the
government
be
seek
to
roll
out
under
food
harvest
2020
.
the
Irish
Co-operative
Organisation
Society
,
ICOS
,
be
hold
its
national
conference
this
week
and
one
of
the
issue
it
will
address
be
how
the
dairy
sector
will
prepare
for
the
end
of
milk
quota
.
this
will
present
a
challenge
for
co-operative
in
Ireland
.
the
question
be
whether
the
co-operative
movement
in
its
current
form
will
be
well
place
to
meet
the
twofold
challenge
of
the
increase
in
the
global
population
,
and
the
increase
demand
that
go
with
it
,
and
the
post
-
milk
quota
situation
.
will
Ireland
be
able
to
make
the
change
necessary
to
ensure
the
amount
of
milk
be
produce
can
be
increase
by
the
anticipate
50
%
which
be
deem
possible
under
a
quota
free
regime
?
everything
we
use
be
home
produce
and
net
input
and
output
be
local
.
in
a
increase
market
for
dairy
product
,
there
should
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
Irish
economy
as
a
result
.
this
will
obviously
add
to
growth
figure
.
one
of
the
matter
due
to
be
discuss
at
the
ICOS
national
conference
be
the
cost
of
prepare
for
high
milk
output
.
how
will
the
relationship
between
farmer
,
who
be
shareholder
,
and
they
co-operative
continue
in
the
post
-
quota
situation
?
what
will
the
nature
of
that
relationship
be
after
2013
and
will
farmer
be
able
to
embrace
the
challenge
?
I
believe
they
will
.
many
people
in
the
dairy
sector
be
vie
to
gear
up
for
that
eventuality
,
but
there
be
also
a
generational
shift
in
that
regard
.
there
will
have
to
be
a
common
mechanism
to
regulate
milk
production
and
it
must
have
a
all
-
island
approach
.
whether
it
be
a
all
-
island
or
one
Ireland
approach
be
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
we
believe
there
should
be
a
deepening
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
part
of
the
island
to
achieve
such
a
common
mechanism
.
there
must
be
a
consensus
between
co-operative
with
regard
to
the
potential
for
the
dairy
sector
and
this
can
only
come
from
the
people
who
own
the
co-operative
.
it
will
probably
require
a
change
in
mindset
and
a
more
lateral
view
as
to
how
we
can
look
at
the
market
strategically
.
it
have
be
suggest
that
Ireland
could
become
another
New
Zealand
or
that
perhaps
Ireland
should
ally
itself
with
New
Zealand
to
create
a
type
of
duopoly
to
control
milk
supply
from
grass
-
feed
cattle
.
this
be
necessary
to
compete
in
a
global
market
and
we
should
not
be
ashamed
to
look
strategically
at
how
that
can
happen
.
there
be
a
critique
of
the
New
Zealand
model
in
that
land
ownership
structure
be
more
fluid
there
than
they
be
here
,
which
facilitate
the
existence
of
that
model
.
here
it
be
a
little
more
difficult
due
to
the
great
tie
to
the
land
,
but
that
be
a
challenge
which
should
be
examine
.
the
key
point
be
that
we
should
take
a
more
lateral
view
in
term
of
how
to
gain
a
great
foothold
in
the
global
dairy
market
.
if
form
strategic
alliance
be
require
,
we
should
at
least
examine
the
possibility
even
if
they
do
not
come
to
fruition
.
we
must
take
a
more
lateral
view
in
form
we
strategy
.
accord
to
food
harvest
2020
,
there
will
be
a
increase
in
the
global
population
.
the
question
for
Ireland
be
how
to
maximise
that
potential
.
the
theory
be
that
the
dairy
sector
must
consolidate
further
and
traditional
behaviour
must
be
examine
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
we
increase
we
milk
supply
to
cater
for
that
demand
.
the
success
of
food
harvest
2020
will
be
predicate
on
ensure
that
more
young
farmer
enter
the
sector
.
this
should
become
a
priority
.
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
there
be
a
report
by
Macra
to
Feirme
indicate
that
less
than
7
%
of
Europe
's
farmer
be
under
the
age
of
35
year
.
the
food
harvest
2020
report
put
emphasis
on
give
young
people
access
to
farming
but
the
educational
aspect
of
that
must
be
examine
more
deeply
.
if
the
strategy
be
to
be
successful
,
it
must
be
base
on
a
clear
and
unambiguous
need
to
provide
active
measure
to
ensure
participation
rate
by
young
people
.
there
be
a
suggestion
that
if
there
be
specific
scheme
for
young
people
under
the
new
CAP
,
it
would
go
a
long
way
towards
address
the
challenge
of
ensure
a
throughput
of
new
farmer
.
the
policy
would
bear
fruit
arise
from
that
.
member
be
familiar
with
the
adage
that
it
be
hard
to
teach
a
old
dog
new
trick
.
if
there
be
a
throughput
of
young
farmer
,
they
would
be
well
able
to
adapt
to
new
method
and
will
bring
forward
the
policy
as
necessary
.
one
of
the
key
deficiency
in
the
report
be
the
lack
of
a
coherent
chapter
on
education
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
have
the
target
of
increase
the
value
of
the
primary
output
in
agriculture
,
fishery
and
forestry
by
€
1.5
billion
or
33
%
compare
to
the
2007
to
2009
average
,
increase
the
value
add
in
agriculture
,
food
,
fishery
and
wood
product
by
€
3
billion
or
a
40
%
increase
on
2005
and
have
a
export
target
of
€
12
billion
for
the
sector
,
represent
a
42
%
increase
compare
to
2007
to
2009
,
but
if
that
be
to
be
achieve
there
will
have
to
be
a
more
fundamental
educational
input
for
the
reason
I
have
outline
.
even
though
innovation
be
take
place
in
the
beef
,
dairy
and
wood
sector
,
if
the
age
profile
of
farmer
be
high
there
will
be
a
lag
time
in
reach
that
target
.
it
will
be
necessary
to
increase
the
throughput
of
young
people
who
be
educate
specifically
to
achieve
that
target
.
if
the
overall
vision
be
base
on
act
smart
,
think
green
and
achieve
growth
and
if
the
Department
be
try
to
prioritise
research
and
development
,
improve
skill
level
,
increase
good
practice
,
foster
creativity
and
improve
consumer
preference
,
this
can
only
be
achieve
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
current
paradigm
.
in
other
word
,
the
underlying
assumption
need
to
change
.
the
Labour
Party
's
view
be
that
there
have
to
be
a
root
and
branch
review
of
the
educational
aspect
of
how
to
proceed
.
we
acknowledge
that
centre
of
excellence
like
ucc
,
which
have
specialist
knowledge
food
production
,
should
be
incorporate
into
the
roll
-
out
of
this
policy
and
become
active
stakeholder
.
we
also
need
to
overhaul
subject
such
as
agricultural
science
at
second
level
.
a
farming
-
related
model
or
a
food
-
related
model
-
module
of
education
could
be
introduce
into
the
leave
certificate
curriculum
to
develop
,
foster
and
create
the
aspiration
outline
in
the
overall
vision
.
we
believe
that
the
young
people
start
,
especially
in
second
level
institution
,
the
more
of
a
opportunity
there
will
be
to
create
the
coterie
of
food
and
agribusiness
entrepreneur
need
to
sustain
the
policy
.
if
it
be
a
2020
strategy
,
it
have
to
be
implement
on
the
basis
of
ensure
that
we
start
now
and
we
start
at
second
level
to
ensure
more
people
be
bring
through
the
educational
system
with
a
focus
on
food
production
and
all
that
entail
.
there
be
major
challenge
in
the
fiscal
and
economic
context
.
the
report
issue
by
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Enterprise
,
trade
and
Innovation
under
rapporteur
,
deputy
Arthur
Morgan
,
and
Chairman
,
deputy
Willie
Penrose
,
examine
what
be
require
to
expand
employment
in
the
agrifood
sector
.
it
take
a
deep
view
of
what
need
to
be
do
and
one
of
the
area
it
examine
be
the
role
of
co-operative
.
I
refer
to
the
ICOS
model
and
to
its
meeting
this
week
to
discuss
how
to
improve
the
co-operative
movement
and
the
need
for
great
consolidation
.
one
of
the
aspiration
in
the
Morgan
report
be
to
ensure
a
important
role
for
co-operative
.
it
state
:
the
government
need
to
support
the
co-operative
enterprise
from
start
-
up
to
employee
buy
-
out
in
the
agri
food
sector
.
co-operative
have
a
long
tradition
in
the
agri
food
sector
in
Ireland
where
some
business
,
which
start
out
as
local
co-op
have
go
on
to
be
multi-national
and
market
leader
such
as
in
the
area
of
dairy
product
.
the
co-operative
Movement
have
play
a
central
role
in
the
economic
development
of
rural
Ireland
.
co-operative
enterprise
create
many
benefit
for
business
,
employee
and
community
.
that
aspiration
should
be
incorporate
into
the
strategy
.
the
development
of
a
new
generation
of
co-operative
,
particularly
for
organic
foodstuff
,
must
play
a
role
in
create
new
job
in
the
agrifood
sector
.
establish
a
co-operative
may
be
the
most
viable
option
for
start
a
new
business
and
government
policy
need
to
reflect
this
.
the
Labour
Party
will
stand
over
that
aspiration
and
we
believe
that
it
need
to
be
incorporate
into
a
government
policy
where
one
go
back
to
first
principle
.
there
be
a
need
for
great
consolidation
within
the
co-operative
movement
in
the
dairy
sector
where
scaling
upwards
will
achieve
a
great
export
market
without
lose
core
principle
and
deepening
relationship
with
the
local
market
.
there
be
massive
scope
in
this
area
but
there
be
also
a
role
,
for
instance
,
for
enterprise
development
agency
to
assist
in
the
process
of
add
value
to
the
industry
.
the
Morgan
report
outline
how
access
to
expertise
and
capital
for
venture
and
project
,
which
provide
economic
benefit
but
which
may
not
happen
if
leave
to
market
force
alone
,
can
be
increase
.
in
other
word
,
state
involvement
be
vital
in
this
process
.

one
of
the
aspiration
in

and

chapter
of
the
food

2020
document

it
acknowledge
the
role
of
Teagasc
,
the
Marine
Institute
and
university
and
other
third
level
institution
and
state
they
have
a
crucial
role
in
create
and
disseminate
new
knowledge
.
if
one
own
a
exist
business
and
if
one
wish
to
retrain
,
there
be
programme
which
be
tailor
to
one
's
need
.
for
instance
,
a
programme
in
ucc
be

at
people
work
within
the
Artisan
food
sector
and
it
be
design
to
try
to
encourage
they
to
add
value
to
they

and
to
learn
new

skill
.
however
,
there
be
a
cost
component
to
do
the

and
,
very
often
,
people
work
within
that
sector
be
operate
on
tight
margin
and
find
it
difficult
to
get
funding
for

such
as
this
.
if
we
want
to
concentrate
on
education
and
to
try
to
upskill
people
or
get
a
more

they

and
they
cannot

if
we
be

about

it

to

can
we
expect
the
publication
of
the
Dublin
commission
's
report
in
respect
of
matter
be
investigate
in
the
diocese
of
Cloyne
?
the
Fines
Act
2010
be
enact
this
year
.
the
commencement
order
have
not
be
sign
yet
.
I
tab
a
parliamentary
question
on
the
matter
.
when
be
the
exact
date
for
the
commencement
of
the
legislation
?
its
purpose
be
to
make
imprisonment
a
last
resort
on
default
of
payment
of
a
fine
.
in
other
word
—
—
—
—
people
be
still
be
commit
to
prison
for
non-payment
of
fine
—
—
——
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
have
enact
the
legislation
in
this
House
.
we
be
already
hear
report
about
Cork
Prison
and
other
prison
be
overcrowded
.
they
be
partly
overcrowded
because
of
such
situation
.
when
will
we
see
the
commencement
of
that
legislation
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
be
I
give
to
understand
then
that
the
negotiation
on
the
appointment
of
the
receiver
have
conclude
and
that
the
Taoiseach
be
satisfied
that
the
act
will
commence
on
1
January
?
I
expect
deputy
Durkan
know
it
off
by
heart
.
I
should
like
to
share
time
with
deputy
Arthur
Morgan
,
with
the
permission
of
the
House
.
I
,
too
,
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
welcome
this
legislation
.
as
with
any
consolidation
Bill
,
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
simplify
procedure
and
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
it
will
potentially
reduce
the
compliance
burden
on
small
and
family
business
and
family
farm
,
and
this
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
remark
on
the
January
1982
budget
.
my
late
father
play
no
small
part
in
that
particular
decision
as
regards
vat
on
child
's
shoe
,
so
that
be
a
decision
which
have
work
its
way
into
the
annal
of
we
family
,
and
we
be
proud
of
it
.
there
be
not
much
to
be
say
,
apart
from
acknowledge
it
as
be
a
fine
body
of
work
.
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act
1997
,
instigate
by
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
have
a
similar
type
of
effect
.
however
,
the
1997
Act
have
be
amend
in
every
Finance
Bill
since
,
and
arguably
have
lead
to
a
unwieldy
tax
system
.
one
hope
that
this
legislation
will
remain
as
codify
and
in
that
sense
,
retain
its
purity
.
there
be
not
much
more
to
be
say
.
we
have
some
amendment
in
respect
of
certain
part
of
the
Bill
,
but
nothing
substantive
.
we
shall
deal
with
that
on
committee
stage
.
we
congratulate
the
minister
,
official
of
the
Department
and
everyone
who
have
a
part
in
draft
the
legislation
.
it
be
no
easy
task
and
they
be
to
be
commend
.

what
about
deputy
Gogarty
's
comment
?
the
government
should
have
do
that
anyway
.
God
forbid
.
I
be
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
Fine
Gael
motion
.
although
the
motion
speak
specifically
to
the
incompetence
of
the
government
,
with
particular
regard
to
the
banking
crisis
,
it
be
important
to
speak
about
the
lack
of
regulation
of
the
money
lending
and
debt
advisory
sector
.
in
the
current
regulatory
environment
there
be
a
coterie
of
so
-
call
debt
adviser
who
charge
rate
commensurate
with
the
usurer
of
Shakespeare
's
"
the
Merchant
of
Venice
"
.
this
be
a
outrage
and
a
further
indicator
of
the
indifference
this
government
show
towards
ordinary
working
people
.
this
be
evidence
in
its
recent
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
pose
on
license
moneylender
.
it
may
be
say
I
be
stray
slightly
from
the
gut
of
the
motion
but
in
speak
on
this
sector
my
party
believe
there
must
be
a
level
of
equity
in
the
way
a
government
and
a
regulatory
regime
examine
financial
service
.
if
one
talk
about
give
power
to
the
Garda
and
the
Director
of
corporate
Enforcement
,
one
must
also
examine
how
that
power
be
divide
up
and
to
which
sector
they
should
apply
.
the
motion
speak
of
this
power
apply
specifically
to
the
banking
sector
but
my
party
believe
it
be
essential
that
we
consider
the
wide
financial
service
sector
.
on
27
October
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Finance
whether
he
attention
have
be
draw
to
the
fact
that
the
country
's
large
license
home
collection
moneylender
have
acquire
a
additional
13000
customer
in
the
past
year
and
what
he
plan
be
to
introduce
a
system
of
regulation
for
debt
collection
agency
.
the
minister
respond
:
in
my
role
as
Minister
for
Finance
I
have
responsibility
for
the
development
of
the
legal
framework
govern
the
regulation
of
financial
institution
in
Ireland
.
the
day
to
day
responsibility
for
the
supervision
of
this
financial
institution
be
a
matter
for
the
Central
Bank
,
which
be
independent
in
the
exercise
of
its
regulatory
function
.
the
Central
Bank
issue
licence
to
money
lender
on
a
yearly
basis
.
the
Central
Bank
have
produce
a
consumer
protection
code
for
license
money
lender
and
under
this
code
money
lender
be
require
to
prominently
indicate
the
high
-
cost
nature
of
the
loan
on
all
loan
documentation
where
the
APR
be
23
%
or
high
.
the
disclosure
must
take
the
follow
form
,
there
must
be
a
warning
that
this
be
a
high
-
cost
loan
and
money
lender
must
also
provide
consumer
who
demonstrate
difficulty
in
meet
they
repayment
with
information
on
debt
counselling
service
such
as
the
money
advice
and
budgeting
service
which
provide
free
independent
advice
and
guidance
.
the
reply
continue
:
other
provision
of
the
code
cover
a
range
of
area
include
unsolicited
contact
and
unsolicited
credit
facility
,
handle
complaint
,
arrears
and
guarantee
and
debt
collection
.
.
.
the
deputy
may
wish
to
note
that
in
the
case
of
financial
institution
which
use
debt
collection
firm
the
Central
Bank
have
impose
requirement
under
its
consumer
protection
code
that
offer
protection
to
consumer
.
this
code
oblige
the
regulate
financial
institution
that
it
cover
to
ensure
that
any
outsource
collection
activity
comply
with
the
requirement
of
the
code
.
this
mean
that
outsource
activity
should
uphold
principle
in
the
code
such
as
the
requirement
for
institution
to
not
exert
undue
pressure
or
undue
influence
on
the
customer
,
act
honestly
,
fairly
and
professionally
and
with
due
skill
and
diligence
in
the
good
interest
of
its
consumer
and
prohibit
personal
visit
to
or
oral
communication
with
consumer
except
in
specify
circumstance
.
the
deputy
may
also
wish
to
note
that
the
National
consumer
Agency
provide
extensive
information
on
its
website
and
through
its
helpline

into
debt
difficulty
.
the
agency
also
provide
information
for
that
at
risk
of
not
be
able
to
meet
loan
repayment
.
I
know
of
nobody
who
have
borrow
money
who
have
be
offer
such
information
or
be
even
aware
of
they
rights
and
entitlement
.
this
be
people
who
traditionally
come
from
work
-
class
area
,
have
fall
on
tougher
time
and
be
borrowing
from
the
moneylender
.
there
must
be
a
role
for
the
regulator
in
regard
to
this
sector
because
not
only
be
it
under
-
regulate
but
it
deal
with
the
most
vulnerable
people
in
we
society
at
this
time
.
my
party
see
a
glaring
discrepancy
in
the
way
this
sector
be
be
treat
where
we
see
a
light
touch
approach
apply
.
the
minister
's
response
to
my
parliamentary
question
reflect
a
mish
-
mash
type
of
response
that
do
not
deal
directly
with
the
problem
of
moneylender
and
how
insidious
they
have
become
.
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
the
regulatory
regime
have
borne
down
very
heavily
on
the
credit
union
sector
,
unnecessarily
so
,
some
would
argue
.
in
essence
,
we
support
the
motion
but
if
we
be
to
use
opportunity
such
as
this
to
take
a
look
at
the
regulatory
regime
we
contend
the
government
must
also
examine
other
aspect
of
financial
service
.
it
must
examine
the
moneylending
sector
and
ask
whether
it
place
too
heavy
a
hand
on
the
credit
union
sector
.
if
one
take
the
credit
union
sector
as
a
example
,
it
be
one
that
have
never
need
a
bail
out
.
this
House
have
never
debate
whether
the
credit
union
sector
be
go
into
crisis
because
we
know
full
well
it
be
not
,
even
though
there
may
be
a
small
handful
of
credit
union
which
have
encounter
serious
difficulty
.
the
regulatory
response
from
government
,
however
,
have
be
to
bear
down
heavily
on
the
credit
union
sector
—
unnecessarily
,
we
contend
—
but
not
to
do
anything
in
regard
to
regulation
of
the
moneylending
sector
which
adversely
affect
that
people
who
be
most
vulnerable
and
therefore
need
to
be
regulate
.
we
can
have
no
faith
that
this
government
will
introduce
adequate
measure
for
the
Garda
or
the
director
of
corporate
Enforcement
when
we
see
clearly
from
the
reply
to
my
parliamentary
question
that
the
government
be
fail
to
legislate
adequately
for
the
moneylending
sector
while
go
hell
for
leather
to
regulate
the
credit
union
sector
.
moneylending
be
a
hidden
sector
,
one
that
need
to
be
examine
and
that
should
be
subject
to
Garda
monitoring
.
I
believe
it
be
on
12
February
last
year
that
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
,
deputy
John
Gormley
,
state
in
a
debate
on
the
recapitalisation
of
AIB
and
Bank
of
Ireland
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
change
in
the
regime
such
that
people
would
have
to
do
"
the
perp
walk
"
,
to
cite
the
expression
he
use
.
nobody
yet
have
do
the
perp
walk
and
we
question
why
there
have
not
be
progress
since
12
February
2009
in
that
regard
.
there
be
no
body
,
committee
or

of

legislation
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
,
but
I
ask
he
to
forgive
I
if
I
miss
something
in
he
reply
.
will
the
government
achieve
a
target
of
10000
ha
.
this
year
:
yes
or
no
?
I
wish
to
consider
the
matter
from
two
perspective
.
would
the
minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
ensure
the
target
be
meet
would
potentially
capture
in
the
private
forestry
sector
up
to
160000
tonne
of
co2
?
accord
to
the
private
forestry
sector
,
if
the
State
be
to
purchase
carbon
credit
for
that
amount
,
it
would
cost
approximately
€
46
million
.
while
the
10000
hectare
be
a
aspirational
figure
,
would
the
minister
of
State
acknowledge
that
we
should
move
beyond
aspiration
at
this
stage
?
there
be
a
clear
need
in
a
very
productive
sector
to
ensure
that
the
investment
will
yield
a
multiplier
of
the
benefit
in
the
long
term
.
the
minister
mention
that
the
average
payment
per
person
will
be
€
4000
per
annum
,
which
be
below
the
€
5000
maximum
.
to
what
do
he
attribute
this
figure
?
what
be
the
up
to
date
position
regard
that
who
be
leave
reps
3
?
will
they
be
accommodate
under
the
AEOS
next
year
?
speak
of
the
estimate
,
be
the
minister
confident
he
can
secure
the
€
50
million
next
year
,
or
more
,
depend
on
the
demand
for
the
scheme
?
we
have
all
be
lobby
by
the
IFA
this
week
and
this
be
one
of
the
issue
that
have
arise
.
if
we
take
the
deputy
's
point
about
the
food
harvest
2020
report
,
would
the
minister
acknowledge
that
one
criticism
of
the
document
,
which
we
support
,
be
that
if
we
be
to
achieve
that
target
,
particularly
in
the
dairy
sector
,
there
must
be
a
major
restructuring
in
the
use
of
land
and
stock
?
to
incentivise
new
blood
into
the
sector
,
the
relief
must
be
continue
and
extend
.
do
the
minister
agree
with
that
point
?
all
party
welcome
the
food
harvest
2020
report
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
the
implementation
body
's
membership
be
not
wide
enough
?
will
he
agree
he
should
have
include
representative
from
this
side
of
the
House
as
we
represent
a
significant
proportion
of
the
population
?
will
the
minister
guarantee
the
€
641
million
allocate
to
the
agrifood
research
and
development
programme
will
be
maintain
to
achieve
this
policy
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
commitment
to
flexibility
in
the
implementation
process
.
however
,
the
Labour
Party
believe
it
need
to
be
widen
.
will
the
minister
consider
engage
with
party
on
this
side
of
the
House
to
achieve
this
?
I
fail
to
see
how
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
have
a
bear
on
this
question
.
will
the
minister
provide
some
direction
as
to
when
a
statutory
code
of
conduct
will
be
put
in
place
?
when
will
this
happen
?
we
seek
a
specific
time
and
date
.
will
the
minister
not
acknowledge
there
be
a
certain
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
Minister
of
State
sit
beside
he
,
deputy
Cuffe
,
have
refer
to
Terra
Madre
and
the
slow
food
movement
,
which
comprise
small
organic
producer
who
seek
to
find
a
export
market
?
meanwhile
,
in
this
country
,
the
government
be
capitulate
to
the
Tescos
and
Asdas
of
this
world
which
seek
to
gain
a
foothold
here
.
will
the
minister
confirm
that
he
will
do
everything
in
he
power
to
ensure
that
the
retail
planning
guideline
will
not
be
move
or
shif
in
any
way
to
facilitate
the
"
Tescoification
"
of
the
Irish
grocery
sector
and
to
ensure
that
we
can
protect
the
primary
producer
to
whom
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Cuffe
,
refer
such
that
we
retain
a
good
mix
and
not
do
not
sell
ourselves
out
to
the
large
multiple
?
with
all
due
respect
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
—
—
the
government
should
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
be
.
the
minister
be
well
aware
that
it
be
knock
on
the
door
.
if
he
be
not
aware
of
this
,
he
should
be
.
I
raise
this
matter
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
€300
million
be
spend
annually
in
Cork
on
prefabricate
building
in
the
primary
school
sector
.
today
,
we
learn
through
RTE
that
€330
million
of
the
budget
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
have
not
yet
be
spend
.
I
use
the
particular
example
of
Midleton
because
three
primary
school
be
house
in
inadequate
condition
.
I
put
the
question
to
the
minister
about
the
educational
need
of
Midleton
in
the
future
and
the
answer
state
:
"
school
accommodation
requirement
in
the
Midleton
/
Carrigtwohill
area
have
be
consider
as
part
of
this
detailed
study
of
the
identify
area
,
which
indicate
that
up
38
additional
primary
classroom
may
be
require
across
that
area
to
cater
for
increase
enrolment
up
to
the
school
year
2014
/
15
.
"
there
be
three
school
in
the
area
—
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
,
a
Educate
together
school
and
a
gaelscoil
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
's
response
will
point
out
the
Department
have
apply
for
planning
permission
at
Ballinacurra
,
a
site
that
would
be
woefully
inadequate
for
meet
the
long
-
term
need
of
primary
school
in
Midleton
.
the
Educate
together
school
be
house
in
the
local
rugby
club
at
a
cost
of
€
45,000
per
year
.
the
gaelscoil
be
spend
approximately
€
81000
on
rental
cost
and
be
be
house
in
the
local
community
centre
.
I
do
not
have
the
figure
for
the
third
school
.
if
we
take
a
lateral
approach
about
how
to
provide
this
,
we
can
make
savings
in
the
long
run
.
we
want
the
Department
to
come
down
and
make
a
proper
study
and
assessment
of
the
educational
requirement
in
the
Midleton
area
so
that
it
can
adhere
to
the
aim
to
meet
the
need
for
38
additional
primary
school
classroom
and
adhere
to
the
various
etho
that
exist
.
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
be
largely
a
Church
of
Ireland
denomination
school
.
along
with
the
Educate
together
school
and
the
gaelscoil
,
it
could
be
house
on
one
campus
,
but
the
Ballinacurra
site
be
woefully
inadequate
.
something
must
be
do
.
in
the
case
of
St.
John
the
Baptist
national
school
,
the
school
authority
have
a
imaginative
plan
and
have
seek
a
loan
from
the
Department
in
order
to
carry
out
the
work
.
it
have
prove
it
can
do
this
work
in
the
past
.
if
the
Department
get
out
of
its
centralised
,
structuralised
tendency
to
think
along
the
same
line
,
this
people
could
achieve
they
aim
.
they
seek
a
little
help
from
the
government
in
order
to
do
so
.
similarly
,
the
Educate
together
school
be
house
in
the
local
rugby
club
and
be
offer
a
site
at
the
local
co-op
,
which
it
could
rent
at
a
significantly
low
price
than
the
Department
be
pay
at
present
.
why
do
we
not
think
laterally
about
how
we
can
help
they
?
Midleton
be
a
barometer
for
many
town
beyond
the
Pale
.
I
ask
the
Department
and
the
minister
to
take
on
board
the
submission
make
by
the
school
and
to
recognise
the
deficiency
at
the
Ballinacurra
site
.
I
call
on
someone
to
please
meet
with
this
people
and
think
a
little
more
laterally
about
how
they
be
go
to
deliver
for
educational
need
in
the
primary
sector
in
the
future

I
will
follow
on
from
the
theme
as
espouse
by
deputy
McManus
on
the
role
of
the
ombudsman
.
in
a
speech
give
by
she
recently
on
she
office
and
this
institution
,
she
quote
from
a
speech
make
by
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
deputy
Noel
Dempsey
,
in
which
he
state
:
[
W
]e
should
.
.
.
return
Dáil
Éireann
to
a
central
place
in
public
thinking
.
it
should
be
the
battleground
for
idea
,
the
location
for
intellectual
debate
.
.
.
where
the
bright
and
good
work
in
concert
to
achieve
optimal
result
over
the
long
term
,
not
cheap
point
-
scoring
in
the
short
term
.
that
be
the
word
of
a
Fianna
Fáil
minister
—
a
Front
Bench
senior
minister
of
long
standing
.
the
ombudsman
refer
to
the
lose
at
sea
report
.
I
can
only
speak
about
my
own
experience
of
this
parliament
and
state
that
the
manner
which
the
lose
at
sea
report
be
deal
with
suggest
to
I
that
no
matter
what
the
Ombudsman
's
finding
be
,
the
government
be
go
to
have
a
partisan
,
party
political
view
on
whether
it
would
support
it
.
from
the
point
of
view
of
citizen
and
the
complainant
this
denigrate
they
position
.
for
a
complainant
to
come
forward
in
the
first
instance
and
to
go
through
the
process
of
make
a
complaint
to
the
ombudsman
be
quite
a
lengthy
and
stressful
process
.
it
be
particularly
traumatic
for
the
Byrne
family
with
regard
to
the
lose
at
sea
report
.
for
the
government
then
to
reject
out
of
hand
a

due

Dempsey
be
—
—
I
suggest
take
the
Minister
of
State
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
.
I
understand
that
€
100
million
have
be
commit
over
three
year
by
the
Taoiseach
,
deputy
Cowen
,
to
assist
poorer
country
to
tackle
climate
change
.
consequently
,
either
the
minister
,
when
respond
to
this
debate
,
or
someone
from
the
government
side
should
indicate
the
current
status
of
this
initiative
to
member
.
the
content
of
the
Bill
have
already
be
anticipate
in
the
joint
committee
's
report
.
member
often
speak
in
this
house
about
the
partisan
nature
of
politics
and
I
agree
it
be
understandable
that
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
House
will
divide
on
political
or
philosophical
issue
or
on
managerial
issue
pertain
to
how
the
country
should
proceed
.
however
,
a
issue
such
as
this
,
on
which
a
cross-
party
report
have
be
produce
that
have
be
accept
by
all
political
stakeholder
and
with
the
Green
Party
in
power
,
should
surely
be
out
of
the
starting
block
already
.
at
this
point
,
member
should
not
only
be
talk
about
head
of
agreement
and
so
on
.
there
be
a
sense
that
because
the
economy
have
take
such
a
downturn
,
a
issue
such
as
climate
change
can
move
to
the
back
burner
.
I
reiterate
a
point
make
by
deputy
Barrett
by
question
the
reason
the
election
of
a
mayor
for
Dublin
be
be
prioritise
through
change
in
legislation
.
why
do
that
measure
take
great
precedence
than
a
issue
such
as
climate
change
in
the
legislative
programme
before
member
?
I
refer
to
today
's
Order
of
Business
in
the
Dáil
and
the
furore
,
partly
start
by
I
I
admit
,
on
the
decision
by
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
to
critique
a
government
decision
on
the
closure
of
the
Irish
sugar
industry
.
while
one
may
ask
the
reason
this
be
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
discussion
,
I
be
town
mayor
of
Mallow
at
the
time
when
the
sugar
factory
there
close
and
one
issue
I
seek
to
put
on
the
political
agenda
be
a
examination
of
the
potential
for
ethanol
production
.
it
be
consider
that
if
Ireland
be
move
out
of
sugar
production
and
if
the
African
,
caribbean
and
Pacific
country
be
go
to
be
give
a
great
slice
of
the
market
under
the
everything
but
Arm
initiative
,
then
this
be
a
WTO
decision
to
which
one
would
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
be
oblige
to
buy
in
to
.
at
that
time
,
I
be
strongly
of
the
opinion
,
base
on
sound
advice
,
that
there
be
potential
at
least
for
a
survival
mechanism
for
the
plant
for
two
year
.
thereafter
,
once
the
market
have
open
up
,
it
would
be
a
case
of
sink
or
swim
depend
on
how
the
global
market
go
.
it
be
now
evident
that
the
global
market
for
sugar
have
increase
but
in
the
absence
of
the
continuation
of
sugar
production
at
the
Mallow
plant
there
could
have
be
a
move
towards
a
ethanol
production
facility
.
timing
be
everything
because
this
year
,
the
House
have
transpose
the
bio-fuel
obligation
legislation
,
which
seek
to
ensure
that
each
tank
of
petrol
have
ethanol
or
alternative
fuel
source
as
part
of
its
constituent
composition
.
the
Labour
Party
strongly
believe
that
stimulation
of
a
ethanol
production
market
within
Ireland
be
possible
but
to
be
able
to
so
do
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
in
place
a
set
of
tariff
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
reject
this
position
.
I
be
not
try
to
score
political
point
because
if
I
understand
he
position
correctly
,
he
wish
to
go
back
to
ascertain
what
would
be
the
commission
position
on
such
a
proposal
.
member
opposite
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
in
that
assessment
.
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
precedent
in
respect
of
ethanol
importation
as
I
understand
that
other
country
be
place
a
tariff
on
importation
to
stimulate
local
production
within
they
country
.
I
represent
the
constituency
of
Cork
East
,
within
which
be
locate
the
Whitegate
refinery
.
I
be
reliably
inform
that
for
a
number
of
year
,
the
big
oil
company
operate
at
Whitegate
have
be
store
up
undenatured
ethanol
that
more
than
likely
have
be
import
from
third
country
such
as
Brazil
.
while
it
be
probably
derive
from
former
forestry
site
,
Ireland
have
not
even
start
localise
production
.
in
respect
of
climate
change
,
I
refer
to
the
attempt
to
wean
ourselves
off
petrol
and
to
substitute
it
with
alternative
energy
source
.
one
do
not
do
this
by
allow
big
oil
company
to
control
the
political
agenda
,
thereby
enable
they
to
meet
they
obligation
under
the
bio
-
fuel
obligation
scheme
by
import
from
location
such
as
South
America
because
that
do
not
make
any
sense
.
at
that
time
,
when
member
be
do
battle
on
this
Bill
,
I
would
have
think
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
would
have
be
ahead
of
the
curve
.
I
would
have
expect
he
to
play
,
dare
I
say
it
,
the
green
jersey
card
by
assert
that
Ireland
would
stimulate
local
demand
.
this
come
back
full
circle
to
my
point
about
Irish
sugar
and
how
,
at
a
time
when
Ireland
be
import
substitute
ethanol
to
put
in
its
car
,
it
could
have
a
ethanol
industry
that
could
provide
the
same
service
.
this
be
where
political
thinking
in
Ireland
have
become
so
disjointed
.
we
must
begin
to
think
more
laterally
about
how
to
achieve
we
aim
.
we
must
start
by
ascertain
where
we
want
to
go
and
what
be
we
target
.
thereafter
,
we
should
look
towards
achieve
that
target
without
fear
of
be
perceive
to
be
too
nationalistic
.
I
do
not
use
the
word
"
nationalistic
"
in
the
narrow
sense
by
which
most
people
define
it
.
I
mean
have
some
pride
in
we
ability
to
produce
such
ethanol
ourselves
to
be
able
to
stimulate
local
production
.
this
could
then
offset
many
of
the
challenge
Ireland
face
vis-à
-
vo
the
production
of
carbon
result
from
the
importation
of
substitute
.
on
the
issue
of
forestry
,
the
state
government
target
in
the
revise
programme
for
government
be
to
achieve
10000
hectare
per
annum
.
at
present
,
I
understand
that
approximately
7000
hectare
be
be
achieve
,
therefore
,
Ireland
still
be
off
-
target
.
forestry
be
a
productive
indigenous
sector
that
have
a
multiplier
into
the
local
economy
.
there
be
a
justification
,
even
in
this
constrain
economic
time
,
for
continue
the
subsidisation
of
that
sector
.
if
,
for
instance
,
a
government
can
justify
the
subsidisation
of
foreign
direct
investment
type
job
,
whereby
a
grant
or
subsidy
be
give
to
a
company
for
each
job
create
,
the
same
logic
can
apply
where
we
seek
to
upscale
indigenous
sector
.
if
we
be
to
target
climate
change
,
forestry
will
become
a
fulcrum
in
term
of
achieve
target
.
with
the
impending
budget
,
I
ask
the
government
to
take
a
look
at
this
again
.
fund
this
sector
will
create
a
economic
multiplier
that
will
assist
local
economy
.
I
ask
the
government
to
bear
that
in
mind
.
I
express
solidarity
with
the
worker
and
grower
in
north
Cork
,
the
area
with
which
I
be
most
familiar
,
who
fight
tooth
and
nail
and
through
thick
and
thin
to
try
to
keep
the
sugar
factory
in
Mallow
operational
.
they
be
give
a
clear
indication
that
the
factory
have
a
viable
future
if
efficiency
and
change
work
practice
be
introduce
.
have
agree
to
the
change
,
the
workforce
be
sell
out
by
the
Fianna
Fáil
government
.
the
Tánaiste
,
who
be
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
and
food
at
the
time
,
make
the
follow
statement
to
the
House
this
morning
:
second
,
as
then
Minister
for
Agriculture
and
food
,
I
oppose
the
commission
's
proposal
,
as
the
Member
will
be
aware
and
lead
the
group
of
14
in
its
opposition
to
that
reform
.
I
lead
that
opposition
with
a
number
of
other
colleague
in
the
European
Union
.
there
be
a
disparity
between
this
statement
and
the
minute
of
the
meeting
of
the
Council
of
Minister
of
20
February
2006
,
which
state
:
the
Council
successfully
adopt
by
qualify
majority
the
three
regulation
on
the
reform
of
the
sugar
sector
as
set
out
in
document
5588/06
,
5589/06
,
5590/06
.
the
Greek
,
Polish
,
and
Latvian
delegation
vote
against
.
if
the
Greek
,
Polish
and
Latvian
delegation
vote
against
the
so
-
call
reform
,
only
the
Tánaiste
,
who
be
a
party
to
the
discussion
in
the
Council
of
Minister
and
claim
she
oppose
the
proposal
,
be
in
a
position
to
describe
what
occur
at
the
meeting
.
why
be
she
not
present
to
clarify
the
matter
?
she
owe
a
explanation
to
the
grower
of
north
Cork
and
elsewhere
in
the
country
as
well
as
the
worker
who
lose
they
job
as
a
result
of
the
decision
take
by
the
Council
of
Minister
.
I
remind
the
minister
that
some
of
the
same
worker
have
to
wait
for
more
than
12
month
for
redundancy
payment
.
I
be
a
councillor
at
the
time
and
have
to
seek
supplementary
welfare
payment
on
the
behalf
of
worker
at
the
Mallow
plant
,
pend
the
outcome
of
negotiation
with
Greencore
,
a
company
that
have
receive
million
of
euro
from
the
compensation
fund
.
that
story
be
never
tell
because
we
be
in
the
midst
of
the
Celtic
tiger
and
the
government
side
do
not
want
to
hear
it
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
former
minister
shif
she
position
from
one
in
which
she
be
in
a
block
minority
with
other
country
to
one
in
which
she
accept
the
compensation
package
.
she
owe
it
to
people
in
north
Cork
,
all
that
who
grow
beet
and
everyone
else
who
be
affect
by
the
decision
to
explain
the
reason
she
shif
she
position
.
that
be
the
least
the
House
deserve
in
term
of
the
history
of
this
episode
.
in
2005
,
I
state
that
if
Ireland
be
to
stop
produce
sugar
,
the
perfect
place
to
start
produce
ethanol
be
either
Carlow
or
Mallow
.
ethanol
be
now
be
import
into
Whitegate
.
the
Labour
Party
tab
a
amendment
on
the
biofuel
Bill
provide
for
the
imposition
of
a
tariff
on
ethanol
import
to
stimulate
local
production
.
despite
the
presence
of
the
Green
Party
in
government
,
this
measure
have
not
be
take
.
if
we
be
not
to
produce
sugar
again
,
we
should
at
least
produce
ethanol
locally
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
biofuel
obligation
.
the
government
must
explain
the
position
it
take
on
this
matter
.
regard
the
night
of
20
February
2006
,
I
understand
the
difficulty
for
the
current
minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
need
to
account
for
a
decision
take
in
2006
at
a
meeting
at
which
he
be
not
present
.
therefore
,
he
be
reliant
on
the
official
.
ideally
,
the
then
minister
should
be
in
the
Chamber
so
that
we
could
have
a
full
and
frank
account
of
what
occur
at
the
meeting
.
why
do
the
government
shift
its
position
?
while
we
be
consider
the
matter
from
the
perspective
of
Mallow
and
the
protection
of
job
and
a
viable
national
industry
,
there
be
grounds
for
hope
because
of
the
block
minority
.
the
Tánaiste
state
it
be
a
group
of
14
member
state
.
I
understand
that
,
under
the
old
regime
,
a
block
minority
consist
of
nine
member
state
.
why
do
the
government
shift
its
position
from
a
block
minority
of
nine
to
accede
to
the
cessation
of
trading
as
a
industry
?
something
must
have
happen
.
perhaps
a
vested
interest
interven
because
it
want
to
take
the
compensation
.
this
could
have
be
a
minority
group
of
large
grower
,
the
government
or
even
Greencore
,
which
might
have
decide
that
it
be
go
to
get
out
of
the
industry
and
apply
political
pressure
on
the
government
to
that
effect
.
the
question
of
the
golden
share
and
related
responsibility
come
into
play
in
this
respect
.
I
understand
that
the
1990
legislation
make
provision
for
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
to
acquire
a
special
share
in
the
hold
company
and
to
exercise
the
rights
attach
to
that
share
.
however
,
the
minister
state
that
he
have
no
rights
in
the
context
of
the
share
.
forgive
I
,
as
I
be
not
a
lawyer
or
a
solicitor
,
but
if
the
minister
be
tell
the
House
that
we
have
a
golden
share
with
no
rights
attach
to
it
in
term
of
the
performance
of
the
company
,
why
do
we
have
a
golden
share
in
the
first
instance
?
what
be
its
purpose
if
we
could
not
influence
internal
Greencore
decision
on
the
compensation
package
and
the
industry
's
future
in
Ireland
?
I
will
tell
the
House
the
reason
.
the
government
do
not
care
about
the
future
of
the
industry
.
vest
interest
have
sufficient
influence
in
government
circle
to
tell
it
to
adopt
the
new
negotiating
position
of
take
the
money
and
run
.
if
we
have
the
support
of
the
other
member
state
,
we
could
have
retain
a
block
minority
.
if
the
contrary
be
the
case
,
then
the
minister
should
tell
we
.
I
refer
to
the
stand
-
alone
paragraph
which
state
that
we
have
a
proficient
factory
—
this
be
obviously
a
reference
to
the
Mallow
factory
in
point
30
as
the
minister
have
state
.
have
the
minister
be
in
contact
with
the
commission
regard
that
specific
point
of
the
report
?
what
have
be
the
commission
's
response
to
the
minister
on
that
matter
and
on
the
report
in
general
?
deputy
Jack
Wall
have
already
state
that
the
decision
have
not
be
justify
on
the
risk
of
low
price
reduce
the
supply
of
sugar
beet
to
a
uneconomic
level
.
we
do
not
really
know
what
the
true
market
would
be
,
post
-
restructuring
.
my
information
in
2005
be
that
Greencore
be
go
to
proceed
with
production
and
move
into
a
post
-
quota
scenario
and
then
see
how
the
market
would
pan
out
.
this
be
the
impression
give
to
I
by
senior
people
within
Greencore
at
the
time
.
in
other
word
,
even
if
the
quota
regime
be
not
in
place
,
the
industry
might
survive
for
a
year
or
two
in
a
new
market
scenario
.
if
after
that
time
the
industry
do
not
survive
,
there
might
be
a
possibility
it
could
diversify
into
ethanol
and
other
such
product
.
I
ask
for
the
minister
's
view
at
this
stage
.
will
I
be
allow
make
another
contribution
late
?
so
the
government
stitch
up
the
legislation
very
well
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
scattergun
approach
.
the
everything
but
Arm
Initiative
be
something
of
a
fallacy
in
term
of
a
justification
for
the
government
's
position
on
the
loss
of
a
industry
which
go
back
to
the
foundation
of
the
State
.
the
minister
,
in
he
justification
,
weaken
he
own
argument
because
the
everything
but
Arm
Initiative
and
the
ACP
country
have
not
find
the
foothold
in
the
European
market
that
they
be
suppose
to
get
as
a
result
of
the
restructuring
of
the
sugar
industry
.
the
bottom
line
here
be
that
what
be
a
sustainable
industry
have
be
sell
down
the
river
but
it
be
let
go
too
easily
.
that
be
factually
incorrect
.
by
the
end
of
year
two
of
a
three
year
process
,
the
voluntary
approach
be
not
work
and
it
be
come
in
under
quota
.
it
be
far
below
the
commission
's
target
in
fact
.
you
be
a
gas
.
you
will
try
any
trick
in
the
book
.
who
be
the
minister
quote
?
who
be
the
economist
?

will
the

clarify

reply

do
I
interpret
he
correctly
when
he
say
there
be
no
impediment
to
the
process

it
would
be
subject
to
a
EU
commission
proposal

be
there
a
clause
in

that
result
in

closure
of
the
industry
,
which
say
that
no
sugar
beet
should
be
produce
in

up

that
need
to
be
clarify
by
he
.
have
he
regret
?
do
he
now
feel
government
policy
at
the
time
be
short
-
sight
in
that
even
if
we
be
not
produce
sugar
,
we
could
have
use
the
sugar
beet
crop
to
produce
ethanol
to
fulfil
we
obligation
under
the
bio-fuel
scheme
and
we
would
not
have
to
import
undenatured
ethanol
from
third
country
such
as
Brazil
because
we
could
blend
it
into
stock
at
Whitegate
and
produce
a
indigenous
crop
?
that
reply
be
extremely
disappointing
but
I
do
not
want
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
.
I
accept
what
the
minister
be
say
in
so
far
as
Greencore
,
as
the
commercial
entity
responsible
for
process
sugar
,
state
it
would
renounce
its
quota
but
there
be
a
disconnect
between
that
and
the
political
decision
take
at
Council
of
Minister
level
,
to
which
Fianna
Fáil
be
a
party
,
to
accept
the
restructuring
package
as
it
pertain
to
Ireland
.
will
the
minister
acknowledge
that
post
-2015
we
could
grow
sugar
beet
again
in
Ireland
,
if
not
to
supply
the
confectionery
market
,
to
ensure
we
can
meet
we
obligation
under
the
bio-fuel
scheme
?
the
minister
have
not
answer
my
question
about
the
potential
of
the
sugar
beet
crop
in
the
production
of
ethanol
.
the
minister
be
kick
to
touch
again
.
this
be
the
only
forum
I
have
to
have
my
question
answer
.
I
want
the
minister
to
give
a
opinion
on
whether
we
can
produce
ethanol
on
a
indigenous
basis
.
he
be
kick
to
touch
again
.
that
sum
up
this
government
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
it
be
one
of
that
issue
where
we
need
a
broad
political
consensus
for
the
final
outcome
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
minister
be
begin
to
tie
down
the
three
option
and
be
be
specific
about
the
second
option
.
I
also
welcome
he
statement
on
payment
and
upper
ceiling
for
large
farm
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
minister
be
say
about
potential
capping
and
the
need
for
further
detail
on
that
.
if
Ireland
be
to
go
for
the
second
option
—
I
realise
that
it
be
early
day
in
negotiation
—
and
there
be
a
basic
rate
envisage
in
that
for
income
support
,
how
do
the
minister
envisage
that
this
will
work
out
in
real
term
?
I
acknowledge
the
minister
's
response
with
regard
to
capping
and
to
the
Unite
Kingdom
's
position
.
it
be
clear
the
British
would
be
against
a
cap
for
reason
arise
from
they
monarchy
,
the
Queen
's
progeny
and
the
amount
of
land
they
own
.
consequently
,
this
would
stand
to
reason
.
however
,
I
refer
to
the
flexibility
arrangement
about
which
the
minister
have
speak
.
do
he
refer
to
flexibility
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
a
envelope
for
Ireland
regard
the
greening
aspect
,
whereby
Ireland
would
have
a
degree
of
flexibility
as
to
how
it
could
spend
such
fund
?
alternatively
,
do
he
refer
to
a
degree
of
flexibility
for
Ireland
with
regard
to
the
overall
envelope
?
the
minister
should
clear
this
up
.
that
be
reassuring
.
have
the
minister
read
the
article
by
Darragh
McCullough
and
Caitríona
Murphy
in
this
week
's
farming
section
of
the
Irish
Independent
?
the
article
in
question
refer
to
a
''
€35.7
m
cut
in
the
Department
of
Agriculture
's
budget
for
REPS
and
the
Agri
Environmental
option
Scheme
(
AEOS
)
next
year
''
.
I
apologise
.
I
can
paraphrase
the
document
.
the
article
,
which
suggest
that
the
remain
€
294
million
in
the
Department
's
budget
will
cover
just
9000
farmer
,
get
to
the
nub
of
the
issue
.
the
farmer
in
question
need
a
response
from
the
minister
.
I
ask
the
House
to
forgive
my
ignorance
when
I
say
I
do
not
follow
what
the
minister
say
,
to
be
frank
.
can
the
minister
guarantee
the
future
of
the
aeo
scheme
?
I
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
reply
.
I
accept
that
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
be
among
the
dynamic
in
this
instance
.
he
say
that
"
4
%
of
sheep
meat
import
into
Ireland
last
year
come
from
New
Zealand
"
.
how
do
that
translate
in
term
of
monetary
value
?
I
do
not
know
if
the
Minister
of
State
have
that
figure
.
if
he
do
not
,
I
will
accept
it
and
suggest
they
may
be
forward
to
I
in
the
near
future
.
I
ask
for
clarification
.
from
where
have
the
minister
derive
the
figure
of
the
price
of
26
cent
per
litre
?
be
this
the
amount
that
would
make
it
sustainable
?
be
the
minister
now
say
that
pre-2015
there
be
no
possibility
of
subsidisation
of
beet
grow
for
the
production
of
ethanol
?
be
he
say
there
would
be
no
government
support
for
the
production
of
ethanol
from
sugar
beet
?
tell
that
to
the
Fine
Gael
boy
in
Mallow
.
the
minister
be
now
deliberately
provoke
a
debate
on
the
issue
.
the
minister
have
the
last
word
,
and
then
—
—
the
minister
be
provoke
a
debate
on
this
issue
.
that
be
a
cheap
parting
shot
.
you
could
not
be
up
to
they
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
minister
be
about
to
get
to
it
,
but
one
part
of
the
question
be
about
deficiency
find
by
he
inspector
in
the
past
.
on
the
basis
of
the
target
set
out
for
increase
production
in
that
area
,
what
bear
will
the
food
harvest
2020
proposal
have
on
this
scheme
?
he
be
hale
and
hearty
anyway
.
I
welcome
the
Fine
Gael
motion
,
which
the
Labour
Party
support
.
in
speak
on
the
question
of
political
and
economic
stability
,
we
have
before
we
proposal
by
the
European
Commission
in
relation
to
co-ordination
on
economic
governance
issue
.
what
go
to
the
heart
of
this
be
the
very
existence
of
political
and
economic
co-ordination
on
issue
of
a
monetary
nature

event
in

have
show
clearly

be

existence

be

seek
to
impose
on

great
economic
and
political
co-ordination

continue
existence

.
in
other
word
,
the
very
threat
we
see
to
the
euro
at
present
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
people
,
be
as
a
result
of
a
lack
of
great
political
co-ordination
.
my
view
be
that
if
the
government
of
the
day
be
to
talk
about
great
political
and
economic
co-ordination
at
a
European
level
,
we
must
be
very
honest
with
the
people
about
that
.
there
be
a
choice
now
in
this
country
as
regards
where
we
go
.
do
we
follow
a
intergovernmental
model
so
that
we
may
ensure
we
sovereignty
,
both
economic
and
political
,
or
do
we
go
for
a
deep
co-ordination
at
European
level
and
follow
a
intra-institutional
model
,
whereby
great
power
be
derive
by
the
European
Commission
?
instinctively
in
this
country
,
because
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
republic
,
there
be
a
view
to
the
effect
that
while
great
economic
co-ordination
be
necessary
and
we
subscribe
to
the
very
existence
of
the
euro
,
this
should
not
be
to
the
further
detriment
of
we
sovereignty
.
we
have
now
give
away
too
much
of
that
sovereignty
along
with
we
ability
to
be
able
to
make
and
break
we
own
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
.
there
have
to
be
a
breakpoint
which
determine
that
this
current
crisis
should
not
present
itself
as
a
opportunity
by
the
European
Commission
as
potential
for
deepening
European
integration
so
that
the
intra-institutional
model
win
out
over
the
intergovernmental
one
.
the
plan
that
have
be
put
before
we
,
on
which
we
will
not
be
even
entitle
to
vote
,
be
a
further
kick
in
the
tooth
to
the
citizen
of
Ireland
,
who
believe
very
strongly
that
they
should
have
the
ability
through
this
House
to
decide
as
to
its
efficacy
.
there
be
now
a
well
-
found
deepening
suspicion
that
this
crisis
have
present
itself
as
a
opportunity
by
the
European
Commission
and
the
intra-instion
to
deepen
they
grip
and
to
bring
about
a
federal
construct
for
the
European
Union
.
I
want
to
lay
down
a
marker
to
the
effect
that
any
new
government
must
think
carefully
as
regards
where
it
want
to
go
and
on
its
policy
in
relation
to
the
European
Union
in
this
respect
.
mine
and
future
generation
have
be
sell
down
the
river
,
and
deem
expendable
in
the
great
ever
swindle
to
which
the
people
of
Ireland
have
be
subject
as
a
result
of
the
economic
policy
of
this
government
.
I
note
the
presence
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
of
member
of
my
generation
,
some
of
whom
become
member
of
the
Dáil
around
the
same
time
as
I
do
.
I
be
speak
of
the
people
of
my
generation
.
while
there
be
no
blame
apportioning
to
that
generation
of
Fianna
Fáil
politician
,
there
be
a
sense
that
they
do
not
appreciate
the
anger
and
sheer
sense
of
betrayal
among
the
public
.
some
of
the
people
of
my
generation
on
the
government
bench
be
as
vigilant
as
they
elder
in
defend
the
party
line
and
the
sin
of
that
who
have
go
before
they
,
politically
.
if
this
country
be
go
to
mean
anything
,
I
believe
we
generation
of
politician
will
have
to
come
clean
with
the
people
and
begin
a
new
political
paradigm
that
ensure
it
will
not
be
about
serve
Fianna
Fáil
or
the
party
first
,
but
rather
the
people
,
so
that
they
be
sovereign
.
it
be
the
people
on
whom
we
will
rely
to
guide
we
in
term
of
how
the
country
should
be
govern
.
it
be
deplorable
that
a
deal
of
this
magnitude
could
be
bring
in
by
a
Fianna
Fáil
government
,
which
through
pure
chicanery
know
it
will
not
have
to
implement
half
of
it
and
that
a
large
part
of
the
deal
will
be
very
difficult
to
unhinge
for
any
incoming
administration
.
that
be
the
trick
of
the
Fianna
Fáil
party
and
that
be
what
it
have
do
for
generation
.
there
will
be
Fianna
Fáil
speaker
of
my
generation
tonight
who
will
defend
the
position
and
the
deal
with
great
gusto
,
know
full
well
that
they
will
be
on
this
side
of
the
House
in
six
month
time
when
we
will
have
to
defend
and
do
we
good
to
renegotiate
a
deal
into
which
the
government
have
manoeuvr
we
.
it
be
chicanery
of
the
high
order
.
that
we
cannot
vote
on
this
deal
make
a
mockery
of
the
very
sovereignty
of
this
country
,

I
wish
to
nail
the
lie
that
the
universal
social
charge
be
a
charge
.
it
be
in
fact
a
tax
and
let
we
call
it
what
it
be
.
Financial
resolution
no.
13
on
which
we
vote
on
Tuesday
state
:
that
,
with
effect
from
1
January
2011
,
there
shall
be
charge
,
levy
and
pay
,
in
accordance
with
the
provision
of
this
resolution
,
a
tax
to
be
know
as
"
universal
social
charge
"
in
respect
of
the
income
specify
in
paragraph
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
of
the
table
to
this
paragraph
.
so
it
be
a
tax
and
that
tax
be
a
time
bomb
that
will
seriously
affect
low
-
income
earner
with
serious
medical
condition
who
have
medical
card
and
be
exempt
from
the
other
levy
.
the
grouping
together
of
the
health
and
income
levy
under
this
universal
social
charge
—
that
be
,
universal
social
tax
—
will
mean
that
such
people
will
now
not
be
exempt
from
this
levy
,
will
be
subject
to
this
tax
and
will
have
they
already
meagre
and
marginal
income
reduce
further
by
the
imposition
of
this
tax
.
it
be
completely
and
utterly
regressive
.
I
find
myself
say
the
same
thing
this
year
as
I
do
in
the
debate
on
last
year
's
budget
;
any
principle
of
taxation
must
be
such
that
it
be
mete
out
fairly
and
in
a
equitable
fashion
.
this
run
contrary
to
the
canon
of
taxation
because
it
will
affect
that
people
on
marginal
income
who
also
have
serious
underlying
medical
condition
in
a
adverse
way
by
virtue
of
its
imposition
.
it
be
completely
unfair
and
should
be
oppose
.
I
stand
proud
that
we
party
will
oppose
the
imposition
of
this
tax
because
it
be
not
what
we
be
about
in
this
republic
and
any
country
with
proper
Republican
ideal
would
not
impose
such
a
tax
in
such
a
way
as
to
affect
that
people
who
be
on
such
marginal
income
.
the
Union
of
student
of
Ireland
provide
a
very
good
critique
of
Tuesday
's
budget
and
highlight
that
the
budget
seek
to
double
the
distance
require
to
qualify
for
the
non-adjacent
rate
of
third
level
grant
from
24
kilometer
to
45
kilometer
for
all
exist
and
new
applicant
from
September
2011
.
the
net
effect
be
that
it
will
exclude
working
-
class
family
from
the
potential
to
gain
a
grant
.
it
will
exclude
people
live
in
rural
area
from
be
able
to
get
a
third
level
grant
and
will
act
as
a
disincentive
for
people
who
want
to
upskill
and
come
back
into
the
educational
sphere
if
they
happen
to
be
live
such
distance
away
from
the
third
level
institution
they
want
to
attend
,
which
be
also
ludicrous
.
if
we
be
seek
to
get
people
back
to
work
,
arbitrary
band
such
as
this
discriminate
against
that
who
will
not
qualify
on
the
basis
of
distance
.
carer

vulnerable
people
and
allow
they
to
live
independently
within
the
family
home
but
subject
to
help
from
that
who

for
they
.
why
have
the
government
create
a
further
disincentive
for
anybody
to
take
up
a
carer
's
allowance
when
the
net
impact
could
be
to
force
more
people
into
nursing
home
?
there
be
a

we

take
a
more
lateral
view
by
regard

giver
as

for

to

assist
payment
.
the
rate
of
payment
have
be
reduce
from
€
196
to
€
188
per
person
.
the
qualified
adult
dependant
allowance
go
from
€
130
down
to
€
124.80
.
I
speak
for
people
on
farm
assist
because
they
be
farming
very
small
holding
and
live
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
remote
rural
setting
.
I
be
talk
about
part
of
south
Kerry
,
Connemara
and
Sligo
and
Donegal
in
the
north
west
.
they
often
farm
marginal
land
.
the
fact
that
they
be
receive
the
farm
assist
payment
be
proof
that
they
income
from
farming
be
meagre
.
this
people
will
now
suffer
from
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
farm
assist
.
they
will
also
be
subject
to
increase
charge
to
get
they
child
to
primary
and
secondary
school
.
this
family
take
the
bus
because
do
not
have
they
own
transport
.
they
will
also
be
subject
to
the
new
universal
social
charge
.
they
farm
income
will
bring
they
into
the
social
charge
band
.
while
they
may
have
be
exempt
from
levy
in
the
past
,
they
be
now
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
.
the
universal
social
charge
be
not
a
charge
.
it
be
a
form
of
taxation
.
this
people
will
suffer
from
the
cut
in
social
welfare
rate
but
also
because
the
government
have
develop
this
inequitable
social
charge
.
we
must
speak
for
this
people
.
it
be
clear
that
Fianna
Fáil
no
long
speak
for
the
marginalised
people
who
live
in
rural
area
.
the
message
send
by
the
budget
to
this
people
be
that
they
may
have
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
all
they
life
but
they
,
and
they
vote
,
will
now
be
take
for
grant
.
however
,
I
can
see
from
the
number
of
call
I
have
receive
from
people
who
be
adversely
affect
by
this
budget
that
they
be
begin
to
change
they
mind
.
no
long
can
one
fool
this
people
with
false
promise
or
take
from
they
in
a
disproportionate
fashion
.
a
millionaire
make
a
net
gain
from
this
budget
while
a
person
make
a
marginal
income
from
a
small
farm
make
a
loss
.
a
family
with
a
child
in
university
will
be
further
catch
by
the
new
adjacency
ruling
for
third
level
grant
qualification
.
why
do
the
government
need
to
make
this
cut
?
there
be
no
level
of
equity
in
they
.
the
person
who
shape
this
budget
cannot
have
think
laterally
about
how
it
would
affect
people
on
the
margin
.
in
spite
of
we
political
difference
,
we
be
always
a
nation
of
people
who
seek
to
look
after
we
most
vulnerable
.
this
universal
social
charge
be
grossly
unfair
.
in
normal
time
,
we
might
have
accept
the
need
to
reduce
payment
for
farm
assist
,
for
example
.
however
,
the
universal
social
charge
add
a
further
financial
penalty
for
that
people
who
be
live
on
the
margin
.
the
same
be
true
of
the
cut
in
carer
's
allowance
and
in
other
rate
.
why
must
we
consistently
attack
this
people
?
there
be
no
logical
explanation
for
it
.
it
be
a
disproportionate
cut
and
be
contrary
to
the
canon
of
taxation
.
one
be
suppose
to
levy
tax
in
a
equitable
fashion
but
that
have
not
be
do
in
this
case
.
I
accept
that
we
be
discuss
the
social
Welfare
Bill
,
but
taxation
be
pertinent
to
the
argument
.
person
who
be
earn
money
and
be
also
in
receipt
of
social
welfare
will
suffer
a
double
whammy
because
they
will
come
into
the
net
of
the
universal
social
charge
as
well
as
suffer
a
reduce
rate
of
social
welfare
.
I
have
a
call
today
from
someone
who
have
a
very
marginal
income
and
be
dependent
on
a
medical
card
,
because
of
a
genuine
underlying
medical
condition
.
the
person
have
a
exemption
from
the
levy
but
will
not
be
exempt
from
the
new
charge
.
I
have
seek
advice
from
colleague
as
to
whether
such
a
person
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
household
have
a
income
,
should
apply
to
the
community
welfare
officer
for
a
home
heating
grant
in
the
come
month
.
we
should
ensure
that
household
with
a
marginal
income
be
not
penalise
further
.
this
people
may
be
in
they
30
and
40s
and
still
make
large
mortgage
repayment
,
which
eat
up
a
large
part
of
they
disposable
income
.
impose
charge
of
this
nature
on
that
people
could
tip
they
over
the
edge
and
force
they
to
rely
on
community
welfare
officer
or
supplementary
welfare
payment
in
order
to
sustain
life
and
limb
.
we
must
think
more
laterally
in
propose
budget
.
we
accept
that
there
have
to
be
cut
across
the
board
.
we
be
buy
into
the
idea
that
there
would
be
adjustment
.
however
,
in
a
proper
society
one
cannot
disproportionately
affect
people
who
be
already
marginalise
.
be
we
not
entitle
to
rise
to
we
foot
?
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Ferris
.
I
will
share
time
equally
with
the
deputy
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
bank
bonus
will
be
tax
at
a
rate
of
90
%
.
I
have
not
be
inform
as
to
the
number
of
employee
who
will
benefit
from
bonus
.
if
,
however
,
90
employee
of
the
bank
which
come
under
the
guarantee
be
to
benefit
from
a
bonus
of
€
40
million
,
each
of
they
would
receive
€
444444
.
if
a
tax
rate
of
90
%
be
apply
to
this
figure
,
they
would
each
receive
a
net
payment
of
approximately
€
44400
.
any
type
of
spin
which
seek
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
pay
this
bonus
will
not
work
because
the
beneficiary
will
still
receive
significant
sum
of
taxpayer
's
money
.
a
underhand
approach
have
be
take
and
the
legislation
need
to
be
revisit
in
this
regard
.
it
be
immoral
that
bonus
should
be
pay
to
fat
cat
when
that
on
the
minimum
wage
be
countenance
a
cut
in
they
income
.
some
6000
signature
of
people
oppose
the
cut
be
gather
in
the
past
24
hour
by
the
Migrants
Centre
of
Ireland
whose
member
campaign
outside
the
gate
of
the
House
today
.
the
payment
of
bonus
to
banker
be
a
affront
when
juxtapose
against
cut
in
the
income
of
people
who
be
barely
survive
on
the
minimum
wage
.
it
be
a
insult
and
certainly
not
how
the
country
should
do
its
business
.
the
introduction
of
the
new
universal
social
charge
will
bring
that
on
the
minimum
wage
into
the
tax
net
.
the
minister
misl
the
House
last
night
when
he
state
that
on
the
minimum
wage
would
not
be
subject
to
taxation
.
the
universal
social
charge
be
a
tax
,
as
explicitly
state
in
Financial
Resolution
no.
13
.
the
minister
state
:
"
in
the
measure
I
be
present
today
,
that
on
the
new
reduce
minimum
wage
will
not
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
.
"
be
he
suggest
that
that
on
the
minimum
wage
will
not
be
subject
to
the
universal
social
charge
?
it
be
as
clear
as
the
nose
on
my
face
that
if
one
earn
more
than
€
4004
,
one
will
be
subject
to
the
charge
at
a
rate
of
2
%
up
to
€
10000
.
there
be
a
question
mark
over
whether
one
can
claim
back
the
charge
for
the
first
€
4004
.
this
matter
should
be
clarify
.
the
bottom
line
,
however
,
be
that
the
government
be
not
only
reduce
the
minimum
wage
but
remove
the
exemption
enjoy
by
that
on
the
minimum
wage
and
subject
they
to
a
new
tax
.
this
measure
be
woefully
inadequate
and
inequitable
.
if
one
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
everyone
must
share
the
pain
proportionately
,
one
must
accept
that
the
proposal
require
people
on
the
minimum
wage
to
pay
a
disproportionate
amount
.
the
measure
must
be
oppose
.
I
be
proud
to
oppose
any
proposal
that
seek
to
reduce
the
pay
of
that
who
be
on
marginal
income

the
programme
provide
for
new
start
and
the
continuation
of
capital
building
project
already
underway
.
no
project
will
be
cancel
as
a
result
of
the
reduce
capital
allocation
in
2011
.
however
the
capital
programme
will
be
revise
to
reflect
available
funding
.
the
specifics
in
relation
to
equipment
acquisition
that
will
be
defer
or
postpone
will
be
the
subject
of
review
with
the
military
authority
in
January
2011
.
the
steady
investment
since
2000
mean
that
the
Defence
Force
be
well
place
in
address
the
challenge
for
2011
and
the
adjustment
require
under
the
National
recovery
Plan
.
the
priority
in
the
come
year
will
be
on
maintain
the
capability
of
the
Defence
Force
to
deliver
effective
service
across
all
of
the
role
assign
by
government
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Michael
D.
Higgins
.
I
propose
to
take
approximately
seven
minute
.
I
refer
in
the
first
instance
to
the
minister
's
speech
on
budget
day
.
he
state
:
"
in
the
measure
I
be
present
today
that
on
the
new
reduce
minimum
wage
will
not
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
"
.
if
ever
there
be
a
case
of
mislead
the
House
,
that
be
it
.
some
four
page
late
,
the
minister
introduce
the
universal
social
charge
,
which
be
define
in
the
financial
resolution
that
come
after
the
budget
speech
as
a
tax
.
it
be
a
tax
of
2
%
on
income
from
zero
to
approximately
€
10000
,
4
%
on
income
between
€
10000
and
€
16000
and
7
%
on
income
from
€
16000
upwards
.
not
only
have
that
concerned
suffer
the
reduction
in
the
minimum
wage
rate
of
itself
but
they
have
be
bring
into
the
tax
net
and
must
suffer
the
double
whammy
of
the
universal
social
charge
,
a
tax
,
on
top
of
it
.
to
give
a
idea
of
the
logic
and
a
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
minister
,
I
refer
the
House
to
the
debate
on
the
Financial
emergency
Measures
in
the
Public
Interest
Bill
of
Thursday
,
9
December
in
which
the
minister
state
:
the
government
decide
that
the
pay
of
the
Taoiseach
and
minister
should
be
cut
again
.
when
combine
with
the
change
in
taxation
and
prsi
in
the
budget
,
they
pay
will
drop
by
a
equivalent
percentage
amount
.
.
.
to
the
reduction
apply
to
the
minimum
wage
.
such
be
the
logic
that
dictate
how
this
government
work
.
it
be
the
logic
of
a
government
that
have
throw
out
the
window
the
idea
of
poverty
proof
any
taxation
or
budgetary
measure
.
it
be
high
time
it
be
boot
out
of
office
and
that
a
government
comprise
the
Labour
Party
be
bring
in
so
that
we
can
reverse
this
measure
and
restore
some
degree
of
equity
.
what
the
government
have
do
to
people
work
on
the
minimum
wage
be
grossly
unfair
;
there
be
no
other
way
of
put
it
.
it
be
contrary
to
any
canon
of
taxation
and
to
any
Republican
ideal
that
we
may
hold
in
term
of
how
one
treat
worker
in
a
economy
,
especially
that
on
the
margin
and
the
low
pay
.
it
be
grossly
unfair
and
it
should
be
reverse
.
when
the
Labour
Party
launch
its
budget
proposal
two
week
ago
,
reference
be
make
to
the
impact
of
the
national
minimum
wage
and
the
government
strategy
for
job
creation
.
accord
to
the
most
recently
available
statistic
,
41
%
of
that
on
the
live
register
have
a
manual
,
craft
or
industrial
background
.
one
third
of
that
aged
between
15
and
24
year
who
have
remain
in
the
labour
force
be
unemployed
.
we
be
concerned
that
116000
worker
,
some
6.6
%
of
the
workforce
,
be
live
below
the
poverty
line
;
that
the
working
poor
make
up
24
%
of
all
that
in
poverty
and
40
%
of
all

in

;
and
that
the
minimum
wage
be
especially

upon

protection

other
vulnerable
worker
.
a
total
of
68
%
of
that

in
the
hotel
,
catering
,
retail
and
wholesale
trade
.
low
or
no
employment
growth
be
anticipate
in
this
sector
in
future
because
there
will
be
a
permanent
contraction
from
boom
-
time
employment
level
.
consequently
,
a
cut
in
the
national
minimum
wage
will
not
lead
to
any
direct
job
creation
.
it
be
expect
the
primary
area
in
which
job
will
be
create
in
the
come
year
be
financial
service
,
insurance
,
business
and
communication
service
and
health
and
ancillary
care
service
,
all
of
which
be
non-minimum
wage
sector
.
the
Irish
labour
force
have
already
prove
itself
adaptable
and
flexible
.
the
decline
in
unit
labour
cost
have
exceed
the
decrease
in
consumer
price
,
producer
price
and
gdp
by
11.2
%
between
2008
and
2010
.
in
manufacturing
,
the
real
effective
exchange
rate
be
expect
to
be
down
20
%
between
2008
and
2011
.
Lower
pay
manual
and
craft
job
have
be
hard
hit
by
the
reduction
in
gross
earnings
of
-
9.75
%
between
the
end
of
2008
and
the
start
of
2010
.
the
government
's
strategy
be
to
use
supply
side
solution
such
as
cut
social
welfare
benefit
and
the
national
minimum
wage
to
address
a
demand
-
lead
problem
in
a
slum
economy
.
this
be
a
illogical
,
incompetent
and
bogus
argument
for
that
who
rely
on
the
minimum
wage
.

Mr.
Kavanagh
from
Horse
Racing
Ireland
give
a
comprehensive
overview
on
the
state
of
play
at
today
's
meeting
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
his
overview
refer
to
a
fourth
consecutive
cut
to
the
horse
and
greyhound
racing
fund
which
have
fall
from
€
76
million
in
2008
to
€
57.2
million
in
2011
and
that
this
be
not
a
sustainable
position
from
which
to
develop
a
key
industry
.
across
the
political
divide
we
have
as
a
common
cause
the
interest
of
the
horseracing
and
greyhound
racing
industry
.
however
,
we
must
ensure
the
provision
at
paragraph
(
f
)
,
(
email
)
,
(
would
)
and
(
a
)
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
government
be
not
go
after
the
online
capture
.
I
would
like
further
clarification
as
to
how
this
provision
will
translate
in
real
term
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
taxpayer
through
the
Exchequer
should
continue
to
fund
the
industry
directly
through
the
provision
of
prize
money
.
we
all
understand
it
be
a
extensive
industry
and
support
the
aim
of
Horse
Racing
Ireland
,
but
we
must
ensure
tax
be
capture
from
the
punter
and
anybody
who
make
a
bet
whether
it
be
online
or
through
booky
office
on
-
street
.
I
speak
for
people
like
Mrs.
Bambury
in
Mallow
,
who
be
a
second
-
generation
bookmaker
but
who
do
not
have
a
online
presence
.
the
levy
be
be
collect
and
yet
there
be
bookmaker
in
Mallow
—
which
have
its
own
racecourse
—
which
have
a
on
-
street
and
online
presence
also
.
there
be
a
disparity
between
the
collection
from
the
on
-
street
presence
and
the
lack
of
a
collection
from
the
online
presence
.
we
should
go
after
the
online
betting
and
we
need
to
go
after
the
exchange
.
it
be
disingenuous
for
certain
celebrity
to
push
the
exchange
as
be
somehow
very
egalitarian
in
they
outlook
.
we
interpretation
be
that
,
by
they
very
nature
,
the
exchange
will
pay
out
the
prize
money
,
which
be
fair
enough
.
however
,
it
will
be
the
Exchequer
—
the
taxpayer
—
which
pay
the
prize
money
at
the
racing
stadia
and
so
on
.
we
need
to
introduce
a
level
playing
pitch
here
.
I
be
not
clear
as
to
the
various
paragraph
.
we
need
a
proper
analysis
.
perhaps
we
should
look
at
the
French
model
in
term
of
collection
.
the
submission
by
Mr.
Kavanagh
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
be
a
in
-
depth
one
and
there
be
a
actual
willingness
on
the
part
of
Horse
Racing
Ireland
to
engage
on
the
issue
of
capture
more
revenue
through
more
imaginative
means
.
I
ask
for
a
response
to
that
point
from
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
be
conscious
of
time
.
HRI
make
a
presentation
to
the
committee
today
.
there
be
9530
register
breeder
in
Ireland
,
some
15
%
be
overseas
investor
and
92
%
own

in

,
of
which
362

a

we
must
support
the
industry
but
we
must
also
ensure
that
such
support
do
not
militate
against
the
taxpayer
.
the
industry
must
find
more
imaginative
way
to
fund
the
prize
money
henceforth
.

I
support
the
broad
analysis
of

in

the
central
role
high

play
in

the
need

as

I
will

the

priority
and
in
seek
to
enhance
and
support
the
further
development
of
we
research
system
.
there
have
be
significant
investment
in
research
in
Ireland
over
the
past
decade
and
we
must
continue
to
build
on
this
investment
.
we
need
to
invest
across
the
full
range
of
discipline
,
include
the
humanity
and
social
science
,
to
maintain
a
broad
base
of
knowledge
and
capacity
,
couple
with
target
investment
in
specific
strategic
area
of
national
opportunity
.
we
must
continue
to
encourage
we
institution
to
work
together
and
build
critical
mass
around
area
of
key
strength
,
and
also
support
good
and
deep

relationship
with

while
we

have
develop
a
strong

the

must
be
on
we
ability
to
maximise
the
impact
of
we
research
result
in
term
of
the
commercialisation
of
that
research
and
its
conversion
to
real
sustainable
job
.
in
this
regard
,
we
programme
for
government
pledge
to
introduce
a
number
of
measure
to
support
innovation
and
technology
development
in
we
institution
,
include
the
establishment
of
a
network
of
technology
research
centre
which
will
focus
on
apply
technological
research
in
specific
area
.
it
be
also
important
to
recognise
the
role
research
investment
play
more
generally
across
high
education
.
the
knowledge
create
through
research
and
the
skill
associate
with
research
activity
have
a
direct
bear
on
the
quality
of
teaching
and
learning
in
we
institution
and
on
the
formation
of
we
student
,
both
at
postgraduate
and
undergraduate
level
.
all
student
should
have
some
exposure
to
the
late
research
development
,
and
the
connection
between
the
teaching
and
research
mission
of
institution
must
remain
.
not
only
be
research
cover
under
the
education
and
skill
remit
but
there
be
also
a
important
function
under
the
enterprise
,
job
and
innovation
remit
.
within
that
substrata
there
be
a
specific
remit
vis-à
-
vis
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
,
PRTLI
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
alone
have
a
budget
of
€
160
million
for
2011
.
there
be
a
clear
priority
.
if
we
be
to
get
people
back
to
work
,
we
must
ensure
that
we
maintain
the
current
level
of
spending
within
that
area
in
so
far
as
possible
so
that
investment
can
be
maintain
.
it
will
thus
be
possible
through
SFI
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
research
programme
to
build
the
synergy
with
the
company
.
that
be
already
happen
;
the
model
be
well
establish
.
however
,
I
strongly
believe
that
the
government
's
job
must
be
to
try
to
grow
and
deepen
that
remit
and
commercialise
the
research
.
if
we
can
commercialise
the
research
and
continue
that
model
,
it
will
be
possible
to
create
more
job
from
the
third
level
sector
.

in
the
programme
for
government
a
commitment
have
be
give
to
establish
a
network
of
technology
research
centre
that
will
accelerate
the
exploitation
of
new
technology
and
bridge
the
gap
between
research
and
technology
commercialisation
.
the
initial
focus
will
be
in
the
key
area
of
biotechnology
,
nanotechnology
and
high
value
manufacturing
.
in
establish
the
technology
research
centre
network
I
intend
to
build
on
the
exist
infrastructure
of
relevant
centre
for
science
engineering
and
technology
,
cset
,
strategic
research
centre
and
competence
centre
currently
in
place
.
my
intention
be
that
over
a
period
of
time
a
programme
will
be
devise
that
will
put
in
place
a
structure
,
or
structure
,
to
deliver
on
this
initiative
.
experience
have
show
that
the
good
result
be
deliver
when
such
centre
be
establish
by
means
of
a
competitive
process
.
in
this
way
the
good
proposal
come
to
the
top
,
idea
can
be
generate
and
refine
,
collaboration
establish
and
both
industry
and
research
centre
afford
a
opportunity
to
define
the
most
apposite
agenda
to
bring
together
both
the
need
of
the
present
and
the
opportunity
of
the
future
.
this
process
will
determine
both
the
timing
and
location
of
the
centre
.
the
programme
for
government
have
commit
to
the
initial
establishment
of
three
technology
research
centre
,
one
in
each
of
the
field
of
biotechnology
,
nanotechnology
and
high
value
manufacturing
.
the
establishment
of
a
apply
biotechnology
centre
be
timely
because
it
will
allow
Ireland
to
fully
capitalise
on
the
very
significant
investment
make
in
we
basic
research
base
since
the
late
1990
through
highly
talented
people
and
the
provision
of
world
-
class
infrastructure
.
nanotechnology
be
set
to
have
a
big
impact
on
sector
which
be
important
to
the
economy
,
in
particular
ICT
,
life
science
and
the
food
sector
.
Ireland
have
make
substantial
investment
in
nanotechnology
research
,
principally
in
CRANN
in
TCD
and
the
Tyndall
National
Institute
in
ucc
.
a
Forfás
review
of
the
nanotechnology
infrastructure
in
Ireland
propose
that
the
State
should
take
a
more
proactive
role
in
drive
the
commercialisation
of
nanotechnology
,
diversify
funding
and
collaborate
with
industry
and
academia
to
deliver
on
key
focus
area
and
leverage
exist
resource
more
fully
.
the
proposal
to
establish
technology
research
centre
can
facilitate
a
transformational
change
,
enable
Irish
industry
to
exploit
new
opportunity
.
the
timeframe
for
future
centre
will
be
determine
by
the
progress
and
success
of
the
three
initial
centre
.
we
already
have
a
process
in
place
which
adopt
the
cluster
approach
and
bring
together
industry
and
research
institution
.
the
purpose
be
to
create
synergy
between
industry
and
the
research
function
within
third
level
institution
in
order
that
research
finding
can
be
commercialise
.
in
the
apply
nanotechnology
sector
,
for
example
,
company
such
as
Aerogen
,
Analog
device
,
Intel
and
Medtronic
be
all
well
establish
and
already
have
well
establish
link
between
industry
and
the
research
component
.
the
deputy
have
raise
a
valid
point
as
to
when
research
take
place
and
when
the
finding
be
commercialise
.
a
relationship
be
develop
between
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
Enterprise
Ireland
and
it
be
grow
deep
as
the
month
pass
and
the
sector
become
a
more
important
part
of
the
economy
and
we
recovery
.
it
have
become
glaringly
obvious
that
we
need
to
ensure
the
two
agency
work
side
by
side
to
ensure
job
be
create
as
a
result
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
on
the
question
of
value
for
money
and
the
return
on
we
investment
.
I
have
the
same
question
and
,
therefore
,
beg
the
deputy
's
indulgence
in
give
a
response
.
at
this
time
I
be
be
brief
as
a
new
minister
of
State
and
only
develop
my
knowledge
of
the
situation
.
this
question
be
inherent
in
the
process
.
I
will
be
happy
to
share
information
with
the
deputy
in
due
course
.
the
deputy
's
comment
presuppose
that
there
be
no
interaction
between
the
private
sector
and
the
government
.
however
,
there
be
interaction
,
through
the
State
agency
.
I
invite
the
deputy
to
look
at
the
Enterprise
Ireland
website
or
interact
with
the
organisation
when
he
will
see
there
be
a
vast
array
of
company
which
interact
with
both
it
and
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
there
be
interaction
between
they
so
as
to
ensure
research
finding
can
be
commercialise
.
the
three
strand
select
be
industry
-
drive
and
drive
by
the
technology
leader
within
the
various
competence
centre
.
the
strategy
be
clear
and
well
think
out
.
if
the
deputy
have
idea
as
to
where
there
should
be
research
,
I
would
welcome
engagement
with
he
in
that
regard

the
programme
for

contain
a
commitment
that
the
government
within
thefirst
100
day
of
take
office
,
will
provide
a

initiative
.
this

will
contain
apackage
of

to
support

creation
and
stimulate
economic
growth
,
while
enhance
the
activation
support
available
for

of

of
this

outline
in

will

in

to
108500
training
place
,
168,000

in

further
education
sector

156000
place

high
education
sector

the
unemployed
may
access

yes
.
I
nearly
refer
to
the
deputy
as
minister
as
I
mark
he
in
a
former
mandate
.
in
term
of
the
issue
raise
vis
-à
-
vis
graduate
,
there
will
be
a
clear
priority
within
the
upcoming
job
initiative
towards
adopt
a
qualitative
approach
to
internship
.
the
intention
be
to
take
a
more
holistic
view
of
the
workplace
programme
which
it
could
be
argue
be
not
necessarily
provide
for
the
progression
require
in
allow
student
to
progress
from
graduate
status
into
the
workplace
and
move
further
within
that
stream
.
there
be
a
clear
priority
in
term
of
internship
which
be
additional
to
the
exist
programme
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
there
be
at
least
276564
training
place
provide
for
if
one
take
the
FÁS
programme
,
the
Skillnet
programme
,
the
labour
market
activation
programme
,
the
plc
programme
and
the
VTOS
programme
.
they
be
well
encompass
and
the
15000
place
be
additional
.
it
be
envisage
that
there
will
be
a
particular
emphasis
on
provide
quality
internship
in
order
to
stem
the
tide
of
emigration
and
ensure
graduate
will
not
just
be
educate
to
take
up
job
in
such
place
as
Australia
and
other
country
.
a
qualitative
approach
will
be
take
to
the
placement
of
graduate
.
I
can
give
that
assurance
.
the
point
the
deputy
make
parallel
my
own
thinking
.
it
be
clear
that
what
be
require
be
a
more
holistic
approach
to
how
we
view
training
.
it
must
be
with
a
view
to
ensure
progression
and
a
outcome
in
order
that
the
person
in
training
either
stay
within
the
organisation
across
a
broad
public
or
private
sector
sphere
or
that
he
or
she
move
on
but
that
he
or
she
will
have
gain
a
progressive
experience
.
I
will
bear
in
mind
what
the
deputy
say
.
as
he
will
appreciate
,
at
this
juncture
I
cannot
say
what
will
be
in
the
job
initiative
document
,
but
there
will
be
a
clear
emphasis
on
the
point
he
make
.
the
programme
for
government
have
be
negotiate
and
mandate
by
the
House
.
the
most
prescient
approach
would
be
to
await
publication
of
the
job
initiative
.
I
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Ciaran
Cannon
.
the
review
group
be
establish
in
January
2009
.
the
review
be
carry
out
as
part
of
the
2009
-
11
round
of
value
for

review
approve
by
the
previous
government
and
conduct
in
accordance
with
the
criterion
for
such
review
set
out
in
the
Department
of
Finance
's
value
for
money
and
Policy
Review
Initiative
Guidance
Manual
.
the
emphasis
in
such
review
be
on
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
programme
under
examination
to
assess
value
for
money
in
they
delivery
.
the
composition
of
value
for
money
review
committee
can
vary
.
in
this
instance
,
membership
of
the
steering
committee
be
draw
from
my
Department
and
other
relevant
Department
and
include
a
independent
chairman
,
namely
,
Mr.
Willie
Soffe
,
former
county
manager
of
Fingal
County
Council
,
and
two
independent
expert
.
all
external
stakeholder
,
include
school
patron
and
parent
and
teacher
organisation
,
be
give
a
opportunity
to
make
they
view
on
the
school
transport
scheme
know
.
the
process
include
a
call
for
submission
on
a
range
of
specific
issue
which
result
in
85
submission
.
in
addition
,
follow
a
assessment
of
this
submission
and
in
order
to
give
stakeholder
a
further
opportunity
to
present
they
view
,
a
day
-
long
consultative
forum
be
organised
in
October
2009
by
the
steering
committee
with
a
combination
of
individual
session
and
a
open
forum
discussion
with
the
chairperson
and
committee
member
.
in
this
way
,
it
be
consider
by
the
steering
committee
that
all
stakeholder
be
afford
a
further
opportunity
to
make
a
meaningful
contribution
to
the
review
process
.
I
be
take
it
that
the
deputy
be
refer
to
the
issue
of
the
cessation
of
the
close
school
rule
,
CSR
,
as
it
relate
to
primary
school
transport
eligibility
.
this
change
be
announce
in
budget
2011
by
the
previous
Fianna
Fáil
-
Green
Party
government
and
derive
from
a
recommendation
in
the
publish
value
for
money
review
of
the
scheme
.
to
put
the
matter
in
context
,
the
review
show
that
the
unit
cost
of
primary
school
transport
be
€
1020
per
child
.
furthermore
,
the
four
year
national
recovery
plan
require
savings
of
€
4.5
million
to
be
make
through
operational
efficiency
and
other
savings
measure
in
the
school
transport
budget
in
2011
,
rise
to
overall
full
-
year
savings
of
€
17
million
by
2014
.
the
aggregation
of
the
measure
be
implement
arise
from
the
value
for
money
review
will
be
a
important
element
in
achieve
this
savings
.
it
be
important
to
stress
there
be
a
number
of
dimension
to
the
cessation
of
the
close
school
rule
.
the
first
of
this
which
will
be
implement
from
September
involve
the
uniform
application
of
the
distance
criterion
to
all
pupil
travel
under
the
primary
transport
scheme
,
include
that
travel
under
the
close
school
rule
.
this
mean
that
child
reside
less
than
3.2
kilometer
from
the
school
of
amalgamation
will
be
deem
ineligible
for
school
transport
.
in
such
case
,
the
child
concerned
may
apply
for
concessionary
transport
.
additional
information
not

the
second
element
of
the
change
be
schedule
to
take

in
September
2012
and
will
apply
only
in
the
case
of
pupil

they

from
that
date
.
this
second
element
will
restrict
school
transport

for
that
pupil

in
September
2012
to
pupil
who
meet
the

that
the
impact
of
this
change
will
be
limit
as
the
majority
of
pupil
categorise
under
the
close
school
rule
be
,
in
fact
.
attend
they
near
school
.
therefore
,
the
majority
of
this
family
will
not
be
affect
by
this
change
.
before
implement
this
second
main
change
which
be
propose
for
2012
,
my
Department
have
request
Bus
Éireann
to
conduct
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
on
the
ground
impact
for
individual
school
and
the
rural
community
they
serve
.
this
analysis
will
be
base
on
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
information
available
on
current
school
transport
usage
pattern
and
I
expect
to
have
the
information
available
to
I
this
summer
.
I
will
then
have
a
opportunity
to
carefully
examine
the
likely
effect
of
this
change
well
in
advance
of
the
2012
implementation
date
.
I
concur
absolutely
with
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
on
the
basis
that
I
have
receive
representation
from
family
who
be
fearful
they
will
be
split
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
of
this
mechanism
.
I
be
aware
there
be
a
further
review
take
place
and
that
it
will
conclude
at
a
unspecified
date
some
time
this
summer
.
it
should
take
a
deep
look
at
exactly
how
many
will
be
affect
.
I
be
also
aware
of
the
potential
for
certain
parish
to
be
affect
adversely
,
whereby
a
amalgamate
school
may
,
ironically
,
have
reduce
number
in
the
future
.
there
be
no
question
but
that
a
number
of
issue
arise
from
the
implementation
of
the
initiative
.
however
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
give
we
some
time
pend
the
outcome
of
the
review
which
will
result
in
a
close
examination
of
the
exact
effect
on
family
.
I
hope
it
will
give
rise
to
a
further
set
of
public
utterance
by
the
minister
on
how
some
of
the
issue
could
be
tackle
.
no
additional
post
be
allocate
for
Traveller
pupil
under
DEIS
in
each
of
the
past
three
year
because
Traveller
pupil
in
all
school
,
include
that
in
the
DEIS
programme
,
be
support
under
the
resource
Teacher
for
Traveller
scheme
,
which
,
the
deputy
will
be
aware
be
discontinue
by
the
previous
government
.
however
,
up
to
this
year
,
Traveller
pupil
be
not
include
in
the
valid
enrolment
for
the
purpose
of
implement
the
more
favourable
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
DEIS
school
.
as
I
indicate
in
my
response
to
he
question
of
24
March
,
Traveller
pupil
have
be
include
in
the
valid
enrolment
for
the
purpose
of
allocate
additional
staffing
under
DEIS
from
the
2011
/
12
school
year
.
I
can
now
advise
the
deputy
that
81
post
have
be
provide
for
this
purpose
.
I
propose
to
take
question

I
assure
the

and
this

that
since
assume
office
I
have
incorporate
a
strong
focus
on
we
research
and
development
strength
and
incentive
in
my
engagement
with
government
and
business
abroad
,
and
with
overseas
government
and
business
presence
in
this
country
and
I
will
continue
to
do
so
.
I
engage
with
Commissioner
Máire
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
recently
when
I
meet
with
she
at
the
recent
Council
of
Minister
meeting
in
Budapest
.
I
signal
to
she
this
country
's
strong
intention
of
seek
to
ensure
that
we
can
draw
down
the
maximum
amount
and
hit
the
target
of
€600
million
under
the
current
framework
programme
7
and
that
we
would
endeavour
to
surpass
that
target
if
we
could
but
,
furthermore
and
more
importantly
,
that
we
would
engage
deeply
with
she
on
the
next
framework
programme
which
we
feel
would
ensure
that
we
can
continue
on
the
programme
for
research
and
development
in
this
country
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
research
engine
keep
go
and
we
can
build
on
that
.

with

with

the
objective
be
clear
:
we
want
to

to
headline

a
locale
for
FDI
.
this
entail

out
we
stall
not
only
on
the
12.5
%
corporation
tax
rate
and
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
but
also
on
we
intellectual
capital
and
other
attraction
and
in
restore
reputational
damage
in
that
regard
also
.
additional
information
not

Ireland
's
ongoing
development
as
a

for
research
excellence
continue
to
be
a
crucial
factor
in
the

of
foreign

work
together
with
the
relevant
Department
and
agency
,
be
to
marshal
all
of
this
strength
to
deliver
a
positive
outcome
.
on
the
first
part
of
the
question
,
as
the
deputy
be
well
aware
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
have
already
visit
India
and
a
further
visit
to
the
Unite
State
be
envisage
some
time
during
the
summer
.
the
deputy
will
also
be
aware
that
the
President
have
visit
the
Netherlands
.
part
of
that
process
involve
engage
on
the
European

,
programme
in
which
six
Irish
company
be
already
involved
.
a
internal
engagement
in
ongoing
on
the
content
service
centre
.
we
do
not
have
definitive
timeline
at
this
stage
but
there
be
a
very
clear
direction
within
the
programme
for
government
that
we
would
build
on
the
exist
centre
of
excellence
and
create
three
additional
competence
centre
.
that
engagement
be
currently
ongoing
.
I
be
happy
to
engage
with
the
deputy
on
the
matter
,
as
I
would
be
with
any
member
of
the
House
,
because
it
be
in
the
national
interest
that
we
continue
to
ensure
we
can
build
on
the
€600
million
that
be
invest
in
research
and
development
in
this
country
.
the
research
and
sti
programme
will
be
vital
in
order
to
ensure
that
company
already
in
this
country
which
be
base
on
the
FDI
model
stay
here
and
that
we
can
build
and
add
to
what
exist
.
that
be
why
the
budget
line
be
vital
.
I
will
revert
to
the

on
the

.

that
be
a
bit
of
a
flimsy
argument
.
the
deputy
be
clutch
at
straw
.
give
we
a
little
time
.
the
deputy
have
some
neck
.
no
,
the
queen
be
come
.
I
welcome
the
job
initiative
.
it
be
not
design
to
be
a
panacea
and
I
do
not
believe
a
panacea
can
be
achieve
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
.
what
it
seek
to
do
,
however
,
be
to
provide
a
overarching
framework
which
will
underpin
the
economic
recovery
.
within
that
framework
there
be
a
set
of
criterion
so
exist
job
can
be
maintain
,
the
cost
of
do
business
can
be
reduce
,
people
can
be
help
back
to
work
and
there
can
be
a
attempt
to
restore
confidence
in
the
economy
.
in
that
way
people
can
begin
the
recovery
which
be
so
vital
to
we
national
interest
and
to
the
interest
of
that
people
who
be
look
at
this
House
and
ask
what
we
be
try
to
do
to
fulfil
we
mandate
to
they
.
at
this
juncture
member
of
the
Opposition
may
posit
the
notion
that
the
initiative
do
not
necessarily
fulfil
all
the
obligation
set
out
in
the
Labour
Party
or
Fine
Gael
manifesto
.
however
,
a
programme
for
government
be
agree
and
mandate
by
this
House
.
in
the
normal
day
to
day
life
of
a
parliament
we
score
point
off
one
another
—
this
be
vital
and
we
have
all
do
it
.
the
situation
be
that
we
will
not
get
the
400000
people
we
want
to
see
back
in
work
back
at
work
within
eight
or
nine
week
.
it
be
simply
not
possible
.
what
we
can
do
,
however
,
be
to
try
to
instil
some
confidence
and
some
pride
in
the
fact
that
governance
in
this
country
be
base
on
the
idea
that
we
will
serve
the
people
—
—
—
uto
the
good
of
we
ability
.
we
be
try
within
the
very
meagre
resource
we
have
—
which
be
squander
—
to
try
to
fulfil
a
programme
that
set
down
this
very
parameter
.
I
fulfil
the
research
and
innovation
brief
and
be
greatly
encourage
that
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
will
bring
about
a
benefit
in
ensure
we
can
try
to
fulfil
that
agenda
.
it
be
vital
to
we
national
interest
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
parameter
set
down
in
the
agenda
for
research
and
development
be
as
a
result
of
work
by
successive
government
in
the
past
,
include
the
previous
one
.
through
the
State
agency
they
identify
the
vital
part
research
and
innovation
fulfil
in
support
job
.
the
single
message
that
emerge
be
that
if
we
do
not
support
the
research
and
innovation
agenda
now
,
over
a
long
period
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
be
able
to
maintain
exist
job
acquire
through
foreign
direct
investment
.
if
parent
company
see
that
we
be
not
continue
we
investment
in
such
research
this
may
send
a
signal
that
this
agenda
be
be
sideline
.
it
be
vital
that
through
initiative
such
as
the
one
announce
yesterday
we
send
a
signal
to
the
world
that
we
will
continue
to
ensure
we
can
maintain
the
number
of
job
we
have
,
as
well
maintain
the
quality
link
between
research
and
foreign
direct
investment
related
job
and
thereby
continue
to
attract
further
job
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
about
the
area
of
research
and
development
.
the
positive
evidence
for
economic
recovery
be
clear
.
this
year
,
for
the
first
time
in
three
year
,
we
can
look
forward
to
positive
growth
which
we
fully
expect
to
accelerate
as
we
move
into
2012
and
beyond
.
this
be
by
contrast
with
the
year
between
2007
and
2010
when
the
volume
of
goods
and
service
produce
in
Ireland
fall
by
12
%
.
on
foot
of
recent
gain
in
competitiveness
and
improve
external
demand
the
export
sector
of
the
economy
be
once
again
perform
very
well
generally
.
last
year
export
increase
by
9.5
%
in
real
term
,
the
strong
rate
of
growth
for
more
than
a
decade
.
look
to
the
future
,
export
growth
be
project
at
around
6.75
%
in
2011
and
5.75
%
in
2012
.
we
focus
now
,
and
for
the
foreseeable
future
,
be
on
the
maintenance
and
growth
of
sustainable
job
.
I
be
glad
to
say
the
augury
be
good
on
this
front
.
the
number
of
foreign
investment
project
in
Ireland
rise
by
15
%
in
2010
.
this
come
about
because
of
the
proactivity
of
state
agency
such
as
IDA
Ireland
which
be
responsible
for
the
creation
of
approximately
11000
job
,
more
than
double
the
figure
of
5000
for
2009
.
that
transcend
two
mandate
,
two
government
.
I
acknowledge
,
as
one
must
,
this
come
about
as
part
of
a
previous
government
's
mandate
.
moreover
,
this
be
quality
project
.
in
the
area
of
attractiveness
for
research
and
development
project
,
Ireland
be
position
in
fifth
place
,
behind
Finland
,
Taiwan
,
Israel
and
Puerto
Rico
.
the

and
development
,
BERD
,
be
publish
on
29
April
and
it
,
too
,
tell
a
positive
story
.
the
BERD
result
indicate
that
in
spite
of
expectation
research
and
development
expenditure
in
indigenous
Irish
business
remain
strong
during
2009
and
estimate
indicate
continue
growth
in
research
and
development
spend
in
2010
.
during
a
recession
one
might
expect
to
see
company
make
cut
in
area
such
as
innovation
and
research
and
development
spend
but
the
BERD
figure
show
that
Irish
business
continue
to
invest
in
this
area
,
mainly
due
to
recognition
of
the
importance
of
bring
new
and
innovative
goods
and
service
to
the
market
in
order
to
remain
competitive
and
to
grow
export
.
this
be
very
positive
as
this
sustained
research
and
development
investment
be
what
will
underpin
future
economic
growth
,
job
and
export
.
I
wish
I
have
more
time
but
be
glad
to
have
what
I
have
.
today
I
attend
a
event
where
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
a
company
with
a
significant
presence
in
this
country
,
have
its
global
management
structure
meet
at
Carton
House
.
that
company
sustain
more
than
2000
job
in
this
country
.
arise
from
that
,
Science

host
a

which
show
how
innovative
Ireland

.
there
be
a
showcase
,
with
more
than
30
company
and
research
function
come
together
.
there
be
one
clear
message
that
come
across
when
one
talk
to
people
from
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
other
company
of
that
nature
.
we
must
send
a
signal
to
they
that
we
want
to
push
out
the
boundary
on
framework
programme
7
,
which
see
a
target
of
some
€600
million
be
achieve
.
we
must
show
that
we
can
look
forward
,
via
the
European
Commissioner
,
Máire
Geoghegan
Quinn
,
and
a
enhance
relationship
with
the
European
Commission
,
to
continue
,
in
framework
8
,
to
push
the
boundary
further
.
we
must
signal
to
company
like
Johnson
&
Johnson
we
commitment
to
the
research
and
development
component
and
show
we
be
commit
to
the
spend
in
hit
certain
target
that
will
see
we
grow
job
in
the
area
.
investment
make
in
recent
year
be
already
begin
to
pay
off
.
the
initiative
launch
yesterday
be
a
signalling
exercise
to
company
that
have
invest
in
this
country
.
it
state
we
be
still
very
serious
about
ensure
we
can
retain
they
and
the
right
kind
of
condition
so
the
company
and
researcher
we
fund
will
be
able
to
sustain
this
economy
in
the
long
run
.
during
the
1970
we
depend
on
agriculture
in
term
of
input
from
a
European
Union
perspective
,
while
during
the
1980
and
1990
it
be

.
the
next
big
tranche
in
sustain
job
will
be
on
the
research
,
scientific
,

side
.
we
must
continue
with
this
agenda
.
may
I

point

it

,
I
intend

have
the
review
complete
as
quickly
as
possible
.
I
propose
to
take
five
minute
.
I
refer
to
a
point
make
by
deputy
Luke
'
Ming
'
Flanagan
about
maximise
a
potential
within
community
to
grow
that
sector
and
to
develop
local
market
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
deputy
on
that
score
.
I
look
at
model
in
upstate
New
York
of
community
-
support
agriculture
.
I
be
very
much
on
the
same
page
as
the
deputy
on
that
issue
.
a
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
and
the
meat
sector
would
mean
a
small
number
of
large
farm
feed
into
a
co-operative
structure
which
will
probably
be
restructure
.
one
must
then
have
due
regard
for
the
small
community
-
base
agriculture
and
the
small
farm
and
they
place
in
a
community
and
social
structure
.
because
they
be
so
vital
we
need
to
ensure
they
be
not
leave
behind
.
I
hope
that
once
the
new
Oireachtas
committee
structure
be
up
and
run
we
will
be
able
to
discuss
that
kind
of
issue
.
local
authority
should
be
encourage
to
maximise
a
new
space
and
look
at
model
be
roll
out
in
place
such
as
Tralee
and
other
town
.
the
use
of
land
could
be
maximise
especially
around
urban
area
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
do
not
lose
the
family
farm
structure
.
the
family
farm
should
not
be
leave
behind
.
I
would
like
to
speak
about
the
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
.
milk
quota
will
be
abolish
in
2015
.
we
all
buy
into
the
food
harvest
2020
proposal
.
however
,
we
be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
it
may
present
some
constraint
.
will
great
consolidation
of
the
dairy
sector
result
in
jobless
growth
?
will
it
result
in
the
existence
of
just
one
or
two
milk
dryer
in
this
country
?
what
would
be
its
permutation
be
for
regional
growth
in
this
country
?
there
be
challenge
in
this
regard
.
if
there
be
a
50
%
increase
in
milk
production
,
it
must
be
accompany
by
job
creation
.
we
cannot
have
jobless
growth
.
we
must
ensure
we
continue
to
add
value
to
milk
as
a
commodity
.
that
be
where
my
research
and
innovation
brief
come
into
play
.
Teagasc
be
do
a
great
deal
of
work
on
infant
formula
at
its
Moorepark
facility
in
Fermoy
.
it
want
to
ensure
the
commodity
have
a
research
component
and
to
add
value
in
order
to
create
job
.
there
be
a
engagement
in
that
space
.
if
we
do
not
engage
politically
,
however
,
there
be
a
danger
that
we
could
get
leave
behind
.
my
role
be
to
prioritise
research
so
that
we
can
mine
as
much
potential
as
possible
from
the
food
industry

feed
into
policy
at
the

I
hope
we
can
realise
the
potential
of
research
in

the
add
value
process

if
that
do
not
happen
,
there
be
a
danger
that
we
will
go
down
the
commodity
line
and
,
as
a
result
,
fail
to
create
the
type
of
job
we
need
to
create
in
this
sector
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
it
be
all
very
well
to
talk
about
the
expansion
of
the
dairy
and
meat
sector
,
but
there
be
a
danger
that
growth
will
not
be
accompany
by
job
creation

we
all
favour
expansion

we
do
not
know
what
the
post

scenario
will
be
.
many
young

be
scaling
up
at
the
moment
because
they
can
see
the
potential
that

we
need
to
have
due

for
that
small

who
do
not
have
the
require
economy
of
scale
to
act
in
a
similar
manner
.
we
be
conscious
of
the
need
of
that
sector
of
the
agricultural
community
.
the
provision
of

a
matter
for

this
decision
be
take
by
Vodafone
and
it
raise
some
question
which
have
be
clearly
and
well
articulate
by
the
Deputy
.
I
will
not
refer
to
my
script
because
I
honestly
believe
that
serious
question
have
be
raise
,
include
the
relationship
with
Vodafone
which
be
a
very
profitable
company
.
when
the
issue
be
raise
by
the
Deputy
,
Vodafone
supply
the
Department
with
some
information
which
would
not
necessarily
have
answer
the
question
put
.
with
this
in
mind
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
I
some
leeway
so
I
can
interact
with
Vodafone
's
public
affair
section
,
and
with
Enterprise
Ireland
because
I
understand
Rigney
Dolphin
be
a
client
company
,
and
so
that
we
can
examine
the
exact
reason
the
outsource
have
begin
.
accord
to
a
document
receive
from
Vodafone
,
it
be
expect
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
consultation
process
the
credit
and
collection
activity
will
be
outsource
to
a
specialist
supplier
in
Ireland
.
mobile

customer

a
exist
group
subsidiary
base
in
Egypt
and
mobile
back
office
will
transfer
to
a
subsidiary
company
base
in
India
.
I
also
understand
that
Ireland
be
not
the
only
country
affect
by
the
Vodafone
move
.
the
group
also
move
call
centre
operation
from
Germany
to
Egypt
.
rather
than
give
the
Deputy
a
pro
forma
answer
,
I
ask
they
to
allow
I
some
leeway
.

to
the

if
it
have
be
in
touch
with
he
,
I
would
be
more
than
happy
to
field
a
telephone
call
from
it
on
this
matter
.
I
cannot
give
any
guarantee
as
it
be
a
corporate
decision
.
all
I
can
say
be
that
we
be
commit
to
try
to
retain
job
.
the
State
agency
in
this

as
well
as
the
Louth
County
Enterprise
Board
will
continue
to
promote
Dundalk
as
a
centre
for
inward
investment
and
enterprise
development
.
I
acknowledge
the
Deputy
have
raise
some
interesting
point
.
Vodafone
employ
1200
staff
in
various
location
in
Ireland
which
be
a
significant
investment
in
this
country
and
that
must
be
acknowledge
.
however
,
question
have
be
raise
this
evening
and
perhaps
this
merit
further
examination
.
I
would
be
happy
to
oblige
the
deputy
in
so
far
as
I
be
able
to
do
so
and
I
will
endeavour
to
help
they
in
this
regard
.

be
great
synergy

in
the
EMI
v.

high
Court
judgment
of
11
October
2010
,
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
decide
that
he
be
constrain
by
the
wording
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
and
could
not
grant
a
injunction
in

of

of

against
a
information
service
provider
,
isp
,
in
the
circumstance
of
''
mere

''
.
accordingly
,
he
state
that
Ireland
be
in
breach
of
its
EU
obligation
in
that
respect
.
"
mere

"
provide
that
if
a

do
not

modify
the

do

,
it
be
grant
a
"

"
against

by
virtue
of
the

.
however
,
this
do
not
affect
the
power
of
the
court
to
require
service
provider
to
terminate
or
prevent
copyright
infringement
.
two
EU
directive
,
namely
,
the
copyright
directive
of
2001
and
the
enforcement
directive
of
2004
specifically
require
that
the
holder
of
copyright
,
author
,
music
composer
,
lyricist
,
record
producer
,
etc.
,
be
in
a

apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a

or

right
.
my
Department
have
consider
that
injunction
be
already
available
under
section
40
(
4
)
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
and
the
inherent
power
of
the

to
grant

,
which
be
equitable
and
discretionary
remedy
,
grant
accord
to
settle
principle
,
develop
by
the
court
.
however
,
this
be
not
the
court
's
view
in
the
case
.
have
examine
the
high
court
judgement
refer
to
,
which
be
extremely
long
and
complex
,
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
my
Department
seek
the
advice
of
the
then
Attorney
General
as
to
the
implication
of
the
judgment
and
any
legislative
change
which
might
be
require
arise
from
it
.
in
furnish
he
advice
on
the
issue
raise
,
the
Attorney
General
indicate
it
would
be
prudent
to
consult
both
with
he
office
and
with
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
with
regard
to
any
implement
measure
arise
from
the
ruling
concerned
to
ensure
that
any
such
measure
do
not
impose
any
unnecessarily
onerous
obligation
on
the
Internet
service
provider
.
accordingly
,
my
Department
have
be
in
consultation
with
both
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
as
to
the
term
of
any
legislative
instrument
which
should
be
make
in
this
area
and
I
expect
to
consult
interested
party
to
the
case
very
soon
about
propose
action
in
this
respect
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
my
Department
do
not
propose
to
introduce
a
"
three
strike
"
regime
for
disconnection
from
the
Internet
,
as
have
be
introduce
by
France
and
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
but
simply
propose
to
provide
explicitly
for
injunction
to
be
grant
,
as
obligate
by
the
two
EU
directive
I
mention
early
.
additional
information
not
provide
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
all
other
member
state
of
the
European
Union
would
have
power
to
grant
such
injunction
enshrine
in
they
domestic
legislation
by
virtue
of
they
transposition
of
the
aforementioned
two
directive
.
as
I
have
state
,
a
consultation
process
be
ongoing
.
as
minister
,
I
have
just
come
to
this
issue
,
although
as
it
happen
I
have
take
a
interest
in
the
matter
when
the
judgment
be
issue
.
I
have
consult
official
in
my
Department
and
,
as
minister
,
I
have
signal
today
that
the
government
must
make
progress
on
this
matter
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
provide
a
definitive
timeline
to
the
deputy
at
this
juncture
but
,
as
he
state
,
there
be
a
clear
and
urgent
need
to
engage
on
this
issue
and
to
ensure
the
directive
be
properly
transpose
.
I
will
revert
to
the
deputy
.
while
I
be
not
obfuscate
on
the
answer
,
give
it
be
a
70
-
page
judgment
and
be
a
quite
complex
area
,
I
ask
that
I
may
revert
to
the
deputy
within
a
week
,
when
some
indicative
timeline
could
be
available
.

the
programme
for
government
state
:
we
will
reform
the
Joint
Labour
Committee
structure
begin
with
the
appointment
of
independent
chairperson
to
jlc
who
will
retain
a
casting
vote
.
Reform
option
will
examine
the
rate
of
pay
for
atypical
hour
.
to
inject
some
context
into
the
debate
and
,
perhaps
,
give
a
account
of
the
conclusion
of
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
,
the
so
-
call
independent
review
,
I
will
speak
to
some
of
the
fact
as
they
pertain
to
that
report
.
the
basic
framework
of
the
current
JLC
-
REA
regulatory
system
should
be
retain
,
the
report
conclude
.
however
,
the
system
require
overhaul
to
make
it
fair
and
more
responsive
to
change
economic
circumstance
and
labour
market
condition
.
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
recommendation
of
the
report
be
to
create
a
framework
within
which
great
efficiency
and
necessary
adjustment
in
payroll
cost
can
be
achieve
in
the
affect
sector
.
lower
the
basic
jlc
rate
to
the
level
of
the
minimum
wage
rate
be
unlikely
to
have
a
substantial
effect
on
employment
,
the
report
conclude
.
have
investigate
the
size
of
the
wage
differential
in
some
detail
,
the
review
team
do
not
find
evidence
of
substantial
wage
premium
.
even
to
err
on
the
side
of
the
strand
of
the
literature
that
find
the
large
negative
effect
from
minimum
wage
on
employment
,
the
result
imply
that
cut
minimum
wage
lower
total
earnings
of
low
wage
worker
and
have
potentially
important
distributional
consequence
.
however
,
as
be
clear
for
all
to
see
,
the
minimum
wage
have
be
restore
.
that
who
advocate
abolition
of
the
current
system
point
to
the
significant
body
of
employment
rights
legislation
now
in
force
as
provide
adequate
legal
protection
for
employee
rights
and
interest
.
however
,
the
review
team
conclude
that
it
be
not
accurate
to
suggest
that
the
body
of
primary
employment
rights
legislation
currently
in
force
adequately
cover
matter
deal
with
by
ero
and
rea
.
most
of
the
EROs
provide
for
overtime
payment
and
premium
payment
to
that
require
to
work
on
Sunday
.
this
provision
be
a
source
of
significant
concern
to
employer
in
sector
which
normally
trade
on
Sunday
.
they
contend
that
the
cost
of
employ
staff
on
Sunday
be
now
prohibitive
.
independently
of
the
JLCs
,
the
obligation
to
provide
additional
compensation
for
Sunday
working
be
derive
primarily
from
section
14
of
the
Organisation
of
work
Time
Act
1997
.
the
review
team
believe
,
however
,
that
the
mode
of
compliance
with
that
provision
should
be
address
to
ensure
uniform
and
fair
arrangement
across
the
affect
sector
.
there
be
potentially
substantial
competitive
gain
that
could
be
realise
in
some
of
the
affect
sector
by
reform
the
structure
of
decision
making
in
jlc
so
that
the
system
be
more
flexible
and
responsive
to
the
need
of
particular
sector
.
competitiveness
can
also
be
enhance
by
simplify
the
system
in
a
way
that
reduce
the
burden
of
supervision
and
compliance
and
by
provide
a
degree
of
co-ordination
and
oversight
over
the
system
that
ensure
arrangement
across
sector
be
reasonable
and
proportionate
.
nothing
in
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
be
radical
,
depend
on
one
's
point
of
view
.
it
speak
to
the
issue
of
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
but
also
to
the
issue
of
reform
in
regard
to
examine
the
rate
for
atypical
hour
,
which
be
deal
with
in
the
programme
for
government
.
a
process
be
under
way
in
which
all
the
stakeholder
have
be
consult
,
include
trade
union
interest
,
and
I
understand
there
have
be
extensive
consultation
in
that

this
will
bring
about
a
measure
solution
so

I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Regina
Doherty
and
Buttimer
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
Mallow
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
commitment
that
be
give
on
Mallow
General
Hospital
regard
accident
and
emergency
service
but
I
be
open
to
correction
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
Mallow
Hospital
Action
Committee
since
I
enter
public
life
.
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
we
have
be
through
a
very
difficult
and
dramatic
time
,
especially
when
on
Tuesday
,
19
April
,
it
be
announce
by
the
Health
Information
and
quality
Authority
,
HIQA
,
that
it
would
investigate
the
service
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
at
the
time
it
be
purport
that
the
investigation
be
on
foot
of
a
complaint
,
which
turn
out
not
to
be
the
case
.
when
HIQA
visit
the
hospital
,
it
find
the
staff
,
clinician
and
physician
be
absolutely
and
utterly
beyond
reproach
.
I
note
the
comment
of
deputy
Donnelly
.
in
parallel
with
the
investigative
process
,
there
be
a
roadmap
for
the
reconfiguration
of
Cork
and
Kerry
hospital
whereby
the
designation
of
Mallow
would
evolve
or
change
to
reflect
the
concern
that
arise
in
the
HIQA
report
.
all
the
stakeholder
,
include
the
hospital
action
committee
of
which
I
be
a
member
,
physician
,
gps
and
that
who
be
refer
to
the
hospital
be
part
of
the
process
.
the
endgame
be
to
ensure
we
could
maintain
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
in
order
that
more
service
would
be
take
out
of
Cork
University
Hospital
on
a
elective
basis
,
acute
surgical
service
could
be
maintain
and
a
urgent
care
centre
or
medical
assessment
unit
establish
which
would
allow
for
the
vast
bulk
of
case
that
present
on
a
emergency
basis
to
continue
to
be
deal
with
in
Mallow
.
we
be
on
that
route
map
until
I
discover
this
week
that
certain
force
within
the
HSE
want
to
derail
it
and
go
way
beyond
the
HIQA
recommendation
to
reduce
the
capacity
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
.
I
be
encourage
by
a
meeting
I
have
with
the
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
James
Reilly
.
he
reflect
a
statement
he
make
when
the
HIQA
report
be
issue
,
namely
,
that
he
be
strongly
commit
to
the
role
of
small
hospital
.
I
can
only
speak
for
Mallow
with
any
great
authority
.
we
now
need
to
get
the
roadmap
back
on
track
so
that
if
we
have
to
go
through
change
management
,
it
will
reflect
HIQA
.
however
,
it
must
not
be
solely
for
budgetary
reason
.
it
have
to
allow
for
a
situation
to
arise
whereby
we
can
take
more
of
the
elective
procedure
that
can
be
do
in
Mallow
and
have
a
short
stay
surgical
unit
in
order
that
we
can
continue
to
have
a
emergency
department
facility
and
begin
to
facilitate
the
structure
around
CUH
.
if
we
proceed
along
a
pathway
that
seek
to
excise
acute
surgery
or
the
acute
medicine
programme
from
Mallow
in
a
short
space
of
time
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
contribute
to
the
risk
profile
of
large
hospital
like
CUH
.
we
must
be
cognisant
and
very
wary
of
the
need
to
ensure
hospital
such
as
Mallow
have
a
role
.
we
need
to
consider
in
a
more
lateral
way
how
the
role
can
proceed
.
Mallow
differ
from
other
hospital
in
that
HIQA
have
examine
it
and
provide
recommendation
.
the
issue
of
licensing
be
come
down
the
track
.
no
matter
what
one
's
political
hue
be
—
I
accept
this
a
long
time
ago
—
one
have
to
take
the
view
that
one
do
not
reduce
the
capacity
.
the
HIQA
requirement
should
be
meet
,
we
should
ensure
that
a
hospital
have
a
license
to
practice
and
that
service
can
be
deliver
,
albeit
possibly
in
a
different
way
.

my

the
specific
comment
of
the
UK
company
MD
to
which
the

refer
.
however
,
I
be
aware
that
the
Irish
equivalent
company
point
out
that
cloud
datum
be
not
in
any
different
position
than
any
other
kind
of
datum
in
term
of
its
exposure
to
government
access
,
whether
by
the
US
or
many
other
country
.
a
recent
report
by
ENISA
,
the
EU
body
responsible
for
information
security
conclude
that
hold
datum
in
the
cloud
could
represent
both
a
risk
and
a
protection
in
that
the
concentration
of
datum
may
be
a
attractive
target
but
the
economy
of
scale
can
allow
defence
to
be
more
robust
.
the
Irish
data
Protection
Commissioner
have
point
out
that
robust

and
national
datum
protection
law

with
and
that

must

Ireland

a

by

have
estimate
that
by

the

computing
industry
in
Ireland
could
be
worth

9.5
billion
and
employ
8600
people
.
now
more
than
ever
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
seize
opportunity
like
this
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
job
will
be
create
automatically
,
and
government
must
act
decisively
and
urgently
if
we
be
to
position
Ireland
as
a
world
leader
in
this
high
-
growth
sector
.
in
May
I
announce
the
establishment
of
a

centre
in

,
which
will
bring
industry
and
researcher
in
this

together
in

to

into

.
I
have
also

group
on

,
to
support
the
implementation
of
the
ambitious
programme
for

on

in

I
have
clarify

the
finding
that

,
that
it
be
contrary
to
good

that

this
evening
's
debate
provide
a
opportunity
to
clarify
some
of
the
confusion
evident
in
some
of
the
public
comment
on
the
provision
of

it

important
to
note
that
15
%

Skill
—

1.3
billion

the

show
that

economic
difficulty
,
funding

that
represent
a
increase

will
recognise
that
it
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
educational
service
be
deliver
within
the
limit
of
the

within
this
limit
however
the
government
will
prioritise
and
support

.
the
government
will
not
however
re-visit
the
previous

on
the
number
of

bear
with

through

the
Munster
intonation
.
there
be
10575
sna

—
—
—
at
a
cost
in

of

million
.
as
deputy

be
interject
,
it
should
be
note
for
the
record
—
—
—
—
that
he
be
a

of
the
Fianna

government
that
implement
a
lot
of
the

—
—
—
—
that
be
make
that
give
rise
to
the
detrimental
situation
in
which
this
economy
and

find
itself
.
he
be
the
classic
Tadhg

and
ex-Fianna

revisionist
who
jump
ship
when
it
be
politically
expedient
for
he
to
do
so
.
that
should
be
put
on
the
record
of
the

.
in
all
,
there
be
more
than
20000
adult
,
include

in

know
that
the

SNA
ratio
have
reduce
from
252:1
in

.
by
any
standard
the
development
and
growth
of
the
special
need
assistant
programme
have
be
remarkable
.
I
wish
to
stress
that
with
equitable
and
careful
management
and
distribution
of
this
resource
it
be
consider
that
there
should
be
sufficient
post

all
child

require
such
care
support
to
attend
school
.
deputy

be
aware
of
the
recent
value
for
money

review
of
the

the

have
find
that

and
that
it
have
assist

be
include
in
mainstream
school
.
however
,
the
review
also
point
to
a
possible
over
-
allocation
of
snas
in
school
of
which
10
%
be
in
special
school
and
up
to
27
%
in
mainstream
school
.
the
decision
to
introduce
a
cap
on
overall
sna
number
mean
that
all
sna
post
will
now
be
subject
to
annual
review
and
there
will
be
ongoing
monitoring
of
overall
sna
number
throughout
the
year
,
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
of
the
review
.
that
will
facilitate
the
allocation
of
sna
support
in
the
most
fair
and
equitable
way
.
I
note
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
in
that
regard
,
but
if
one
be
to
have
teaching
assistant
then
one
will
have
to
have
a
teaching
assistant
scheme
.
it
be
either
a
sna
scheme
or
it
be
a
teaching
assistant
scheme
.
the
case
she
make
be
a
genuine
one
.
the
review
have
also
conclude
that
the
SNA
scheme
have
move
away
from
the
objective
of
the
scheme
originally
envisage
,
which
be
to
provide
for
child
's
care
need
in
a
educational
setting
,
and
have
move
towards
sna
involvement
in
behavioural
,
therapeutic
,
pedagogical
and
administrative
duty
.
the
review
conclude
that
this
may
stem
from
a
lack
of
understanding
of
the
role
of
the
sna
which
have
lead
to
inefficiency
in
the
system
.
school
and
parent
have
come
to
expect
the
allocation
of
sna
post
for
student
whose
care
need
do
not
meet
the
term
of
the
scheme
.
I
wish
to
be
clear
in
explain
to
the
House
that
there
be
no
plan
for
the
expansion
of
the
sna
scheme
beyond
the
provision
of
support
to
school
to
enable
they
support
the
care
need
of
pupil
with
disability
.
the
value
for
money
and
policy
review
be
clear
in
that
respect
when
it
state
the
crucial
importance
of
communicate
the
purpose
of
the
sna
scheme
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
care
role
envisage
for
the
sna
be
understand
by
school
,
professional
and
parent
,
and
that
snas
be
not
use
to
supplement
teaching
or
as
therapeutic
support
for
student
.
the
NCSE
allocate
separate
additional
teaching
expertise
to
provide
the
additional
teaching
support
need
for
this
child
.
I
wish
to
be
clear
on
some
key
issue
regard
the
sna
scheme
:
snas
be
be
allocate
on
the
basis
of
priority
criterion
and
in
a
consistent
manner
.
the
NCSE
will
use
its
professional
judgment
in
that
regard
.
some
of
the
priority
criterion
which
apply
be
:
ensure
that
the
minimum
sna
to
special
class
ratio
be
maintain
in
both
special
school
and
special
class
;
ensure
that
school
which
have
enrol
child
with
the
most
significant
special
care
need
be
support
to
meet
that
need
;
ensure
the
provision
of
support
for
child
with
incontinence
issue
;
and
ensure
that
the
full
-
day
cover
provision
be
not
reduce
below
a
full
day
.
to
ensure
that
the
allocation
of
snas
for
the
2011
to
2012
school
year
be
manage
in
a
prudent
and
responsible
manner
,
the
NCSE
,
in
consultation
with
the
Department
,
have
decide
to
retain
approximately
475
of
the
10575
sna
post
in
order
that
they
be
available
to
be
allocate
over
the
remainder
of
the
school
year
.
that
will
ensure
the
NCSE
retain
the
capacity
to
meet
urgent
case
as
they
arise
over
the
school
year
while
also
ensure
that
the
overall
number
of
sna
post
allocate
will
remain
within
the
cap
number
of
10575
.
the
reserve
post
will
be
prioritise
to
address
appeal
and
emergency
case
,
acquire
injury
and
new
assessment
during
the
school
year
,
new
entrant
to
school
,
and
reconsideration
of
allocation
level
for
school
in
which
intervention
have
be
unsuccessful
.
a
process
will
be
in
place
in
the
new
school
year
to
review
allocation
decision
to
ensure
correct
procedure
be
follow
and
that
they
comply
with
the
Department
's
policy
.
I
understand
the
NCSE
will
communicate
this
to
school
early
in
the
new
school
year
.
school
,
for
they
part
,
must
demonstrate
that
they
have
make
every
effort
to
manage
they
allocation
of
sna
post
to
good
effect
.
in
2010
the
Department
provide
9600
post
for
learning
support
and
resource
teaching
.
it
be
intend
to
provide
9950
learning
support
and
resource
teaching
post
in
the
2011
-
2012
school
year
,
a
increase
of
350
.
this
be
a
historically
high
level
of
provision
.
it
have
be
calculate
that
,
base
on
the
number
of
application
receive
to
date
for
resource
teaching
support
by
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
,
a
allocation
of
90
%
of
the
identify
resource
teaching
allocation
can
be
make
to
school
in
the
first
instance
.
this
will
provide
school
with
the
majority
of
they
allocation
while
preserve
enough
capacity
to
ensure
the
department
can
provide
for
late
or
emergency
application
while
remain
within
ECF
obligation
.
I
wish
to
clarify
for
the
House
that
4538
post
available
in
mainstream
primary
school
under
the
general
allocation
model
of
additional
teaching
support
be
not
affect
by
the
90
%
measure
.
the
effect
of
a
90
%
allocation
of
resource
teaching
support
mean
a
reduction
of
six
minute
per
hour
of
resource
teaching
allocate
.
school
can
make
up
additional
time
through
grouping
of
child
,
double
of
child
and
more
effective
management
of
teaching
time
.
when
the
full
level
of
demand
be
know
,
the
initial
90
%
allocation
may
be
revisit
.
as
deputy
be
aware
,
a
number
of
section
of
the
Education
for
Person
with
special
Educational
need
Act
2004
have
be
commence
,
principally
that
establish
the
NCSE
and
that
promote
a
inclusive
approach
to
the
education
of
child
with
special

.
the
Department
have
establish
a
cross-
departmental
working
group
,
include
relevant
agency
personnel
,
to
consider
each
non-commenced
part
of
the
act
.
the
group
will
focus
on
prepare
a
plan
for
the
implementation
of
the
act
.
the
government
continue
to
ensure
all
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
have
access
to
psychological
assessment
.
we
have
commit
to
reverse
the
cap
place
on
the
number
of
psychologist
employ
by
the
National
Educational
Psychological
Service
.
the
issue
of
recruiting
more
psychologist
will
be
keep
under
review
in
the
context
of
the
overall
employment
control
framework
in
the
public
sector
.
there
be
no
change
propose
to
the
provision
of
school
transport
service
,
include
escort
,
for
eligible
child
with
special
educational
need
.
at
present
,
my
Department
also
provide
a
direct
grant
to
500
parent
to
support
they
school
transport
cost
.
the
grant
have
be
review
and
from
the
start
of
the
come
school
year
it
will
be
base
on
Civil
service
mileage
rate
.
in
the
face
of
economic
turmoil
,
the
government
have
prioritise
the
provision
of
support
for
pupil
with
special
educational
need
.
as
well
as
teacher
and
special

assistant
,
we
will
continue
to
provide
assistive

,
specialist
equipment
,
adapt
school
building
and
special

arrangement
.
we
will
protect
front

line
education
service
as
much
as
possible
within
the
resource
we
have
to
work
with
.
however
,
this
must
be
do
within
the
context
of
bring
we
overall
public
expenditure
back
into
line
with
what
we
can
afford
as
a
country
.
all
area
of
government
will
have
to
manage
on

.
the
challenge
will
be
to
ensure
the
resource
that
can
be
provide
be
use
to
maximum
effect
to
achieve
the
good
possible
outcome
for

.
I
commend
the
government
's
amendment
to

will
the

this

the
single
big
area
of

.
the
Chamber
also
express
the
view
that
,
for
the
long
term
,
initiative
in
second
level
education
in
mathematics
and
science
would
be
crucial
to
address
the
matching
of
skill
with

,
technology
and
Engineering
employment
opportunity
.
the
information
request
by
the
deputy
be
be
compile
and
will
be
forward
as
soon
as
possible
.
the
"
green
economy
"
be
a
term
use
to
categorise
a
range
of
economic
activity
which
contribute
to
low
greenhouse
gas
emission
,
good
resource
usage
,
and
respect
for
the
environment
.
it
cover
a
range
of
activity
from
carbon
trading
to
energy
efficient
and
environmentally
friendly
product
,
renewable
energy
and
eco-tourism
.
the
programme
for
government
make
commitment
to
support
the
sector
,
include
through
increase
support
for
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
energy
programme
,
establish
Ireland
as
a
renewable
manufacturing
hub
to
attract
international
and
domestic
investment
,
and
expand
renewable
energy
generation
to
achieve
we
renewable
energy
target
.
clearly
,
implementation
of
this
agenda
span
several
Department
and
state
agency
.
as
part
of
the
job
initiative
,
the
minister
for
Finance
announce
that
a
additional
€
30
million
would
be
invest
in
the
national
retrofit
home
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
energy
programme
this
year
.
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
have
indicate
that
this
initiative
will
support
a
additional
2000
job
in
2011
.
other
measure
announce
in
the
job
initiative
help
to
promote
job
in
green
tourism
,
such
as
halv
the
low
rate
of
employer
's
prsi
until
the
end
of
2013
on
job
that
pay
up
to
€356
per
week
,
remove
the
travel
tax
and
cut
the
low
rate
of
vat
.
the
green
economy
be
a
area
which
could
become
strategically
important
for
Ireland
at
a
global
level
.
we
have
a
number
of
particular
strength
which
can
realise
job
and
growth
opportunity
and
contribute
to
export
-
lead
growth
.
the
sector
already
employ
18,775
people
and
the
value
of
the
Irish
market
in
this
sub-sector
be
estimate
at
€
3
billion
in
2010
.
however
,
the
value
of
the
sector
globally
be
set
to
increase
rapidly
,
drive
by
a
range
of
factor
,
include
EU
directive
and
regulation
,
rise
energy
cost
,
increase
investment
in
environmental
service
and
infrastructure
,
consumer
preference
,
and
climate
change
and
international
agreement
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
the
Department
's
agency
,
namely
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
have
establish
unit
dedicate
to
work
with
both
indigenous
and
multinational
company
in
the
so
-
call
cleantech
sector
.
a
practical
example
of
the
success
of
Enterprise
Ireland
's
support
for
the
sector
be
see
in
last
week
's
announcement
of
the
creation
of
145
job
in
County
Galway
in
the
manufacturing
of
wind
turbine
.
another
notable
development
be
that
green
financial
service
be
part
of
the
new
strategy
for
the
IFSC
which
be
launch
by
the
Taoiseach
last
week
.
a
number
of
policy
issue
need
to
be
address
to
realise
the
potential
of
the
sector
.
some
relate
to
planning
and
licensing
.
other
relate
to
the
capacity
of
the
electricity
grid
and
the
price
for
delivery
of
renewable
energy
.
I
will
work
with
other
colleague
to
develop
this
policy
framework
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
on
the
change
of
emphasis
over
recent
year
,
but
I
disagree
with
he
on
the
Green
Party
's
agenda
.
all
party
in
the
House
have
be
engage
with
the
agenda
for
a
long
time
.
a
additional
2000
job
be
create
in
2011
.
a
cabinet
sub
-
committee
be
deal
directly
with
this
area
and
it
give
government
impetus
to
it
.
there
be
a
challenge
for
Ireland
in
the
next
phase
of
commitment
which
we
have
to
meet
on
carbon
reduction
.
that
should
give
rise
to
new
opportunity
in
this
field
.
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
how
many
job
will
be
create
.
no
one
can
do
that
and
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
do
so
.
however
,
I
agree
with
the
deputy
in
another
respect
.
a
swot
analysis
be
carry
out
and
it
show
that
there
be
a
lack
of
coherence
in
overall
policy
due
to
a
large
number
of
State
and
local
agency
be
involve
,
and
there
be
some
fragmentation
of
the
research
base
.
that
be
now
be
firmly
take
in
hand
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
Taoiseach
launch
the
strategy
for
the
international
financial
service
industry
2011
-
16
.
one
of
the
initiative
be
the
creation
of
the
Green
IFSC
whereby
we
pin
down
area
in
which
there
be
new
opportunity
range
from
carbon
management
,
ip
commercialisation
,
private
equity
investment
to
green
tech
fund
management
.
the
government
be
engage
in
this
space
.
it
be
impossible
,
realistically
,
to
set
a
finite
target
for
job
creation
.
the
main
point
be
that
we
be
set
down
the
policy
framework
by
which
we
can
drive
this
agenda
and
ensure
strong
political
co-ordination
and
coherence
.
on
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
's
proposal
,
I
respectfully
ask
he
to
make
contact
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
and
that
he
seek
to
meet
he
to
ask
he
to
consider
it
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
and
I
have
have
separate
meeting
recently
with
the
European
Commissioner
for
Research
,
Innovation
and
Science
,
Maire
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
,
with
a
view
to
build
strong
relationship
to
ensure
Ireland
maximise
the
benefit
of
we
position
in
the
European
Union
in
term
of
job
and
opportunity
to
further
develop
the
economy
.
most
recently
,
the
minister
meet
the
commissioner
on
24
June
when
they
hold
a
event
in
Dublin
to
highlight
opportunity
for
Irish
researcher
,
business
and
educational
institution
under
the
European
Union
's
Seventh
Framework
Programme
for
Research
and
technological
Development
,
FP7
.
the
Commissioner
highlight
the
fact
that
upcoming
call
for
proposal
under
FP7
in
July
2011
and
July
2012
would
be
worth
approximately
€
18
billion
.
with
a
budget
of
over
€
50
billion
in
the
period
2007
to
2013
,
FP7
be
the
European
Union
's
main
instrument
for
funding
research
and
development
in
Europe
.
in
order
to
extract
the
maximum
benefit
from
the
opportunity
available
within
FP7
,
a
national
support
network
have
be
put
in
place
,
head
by
the
national
director
for
FP7
base
in
Enterprise
Ireland
who
lead
a
team
of
national
contact
point
for
various
element
of
the
programme
.
this
support
structure
ensure
a
co-ordinate
and
coherent
approach
be
adopt
towards
FP7
across
all
the
Department
,
agency
and
other
organisation
involve
.
through
this
support
structure
,
a
mix
of
guidance
,
advice
and
financial
assistance
be
available
to
encourage
researcher
and
company
,
large
and
small
,
to
avail
of
the
opportunity
within
the
programme
.
the
range
of
financial
support
available
include
travel
support
which
assist
researcher
to
meet
potential
partner
and
proposal
preparation
support
for
academic
co-ordinator
and
company
,
cover
all
cost
include
with
the
submission
of

application
.
Ireland
's
target
for
the
drawdown
of
fund
from
FP7
in
the
lifetime
of
the
programme
be
€600
million
.
Achievement
of
this
target
be
well
on
track
,
with
some
€300
million
already
award
to
date
.
I
be
determined
that
we
will
achieve
the
target
set
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
the
next
European
Framework
Programme
for
Research
and
Innovation
,
to
be
call
Horizon
2020
,
will
operate
from
2014
to
2020
,
for
which
the
European
Commission
have
propose
a
budget
of
€
80
billion
in
its
recently
publish
multi-annual
financial
framework
for
the
period
.
while
no
target
have
be
set
for
the
next
framework
programme
which
have
yet
to
be
propose
by
the
commission
and
agree
by
the
Council
,
I
be
determined
to
ensure
ambitious
government
policy
be
in
place
in
order
that
we
can
continue
to
improve
we
performance
.
there
be
a
multi-
layer
approach
in
this
respect
.
there
be
clear
recognition
of
a
strong
policy
start
by
successive
government
which
form
the
foundation
for
ensure
the
maximisation
of
the
potential
for
the
drawdown
of
fund
.
we
be
already
involved
in
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
that
will
seek
to
concentrate
on
specific
theme
of
research
and
,
ultimately
,
commercialise
that
research
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
have
regard
to
the
educational
aspect
of
basic
research
and
the
commercialisation
agenda
.
the
prioritisation
exercise
which
involve
all
of
the
State
agency
interact
with
each
other
and
the
Department
be
about
ensure
we
maximise
the
potential
to
meet
we
target
.
in
regard
to
Horizon
2020
,
the
process
seek
to
ensure
we
will
be
more
ambitious
and
that
Ireland
will
become
a
agenda
setter
for
the
programme
.
if
I
be
to
proffer
a
personal
opinion
,
I
would
contend
we
could
be
do
more
on
the
commercialisation
agenda
.
if
we
be
spin
out
more
company
,
for
instance
,
from
the
high
education
institute
,
that
would
ultimately
lead
to
further
job
creation
.
it
must
be
remember
also
that
we
investment
in
research
,
or
research
,
development
and
innovation
,
through
the
collaborative
approach
with
all
of
the
foreign
direct
investment
company
house
here
,
ensure
they
continuation
in
the
country
.
it
also
ensure
great
innovation
in
this
company
.
it
be
a
two
-
prong
approach
.
it
be
about
try
to
achieve
more
in
the
commercialisation
space
through
the
creation
of
more
company
and
also
about
ensure
the
exist
foreign
direct
investment
,
FDI
,
infrastructure
be
not
compromise
in
any
way
.
it
be
also
about
ensure
the
research
component
be
maintain
.
the
high
Court
indicate
that
it
intend
to
grant
a
order
declare
section
42
,
43
,
and
45
of
the
Industrial
Relation
Act
1946
and
section
45
of
the
1990
Act
to
be
unconstitutional
.
in
this
new
Bill
,
the
response
by
deputy
O'Dea
have
be
to
import
the
exact
provision
of
four
original
section
that
have
feature
in
the
now
lap
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
.
the
2009
Bill
have
be
introduce
by
the
last
government
in
the
summer
of
2009
but
it
do
not
proceed
beyond
its
second
stage
reading
in
this
House
,
which
be
complete
on
11
February
2010
.
regrettably
that
Bill
fail
to
make
any
progress
on
the
last
government
's
legislative
programme
until
it
eventually
lap
with
the
end
of
the
last
dáil
.
the
only
really
novel
provision
in
this
Bill
be
at
section
7
,
which
repeal
section
45
of
the
1946
act
which
make
it
a
offence
for
a
employer
to
pay
to
a
worker
remuneration
less
than
the
statutory
minimum
remuneration
,
or
to
fail
to
comply
with
statutory
condition
of
employment
.
this
section
,
which
the
high
Court
rule
be
unconstitutional
,
be
the
subject
of
recommendation
19
in
the
independent
review
report
,
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
.
that
report
recommend
that
the
mechanism
for
enforce
ero
be
bring
into
line
with
that
for
regulate
employment
agreement
and
that
,
as
a
alternative
to
a
criminal
prosecution
,
a
complaint
could
be
bring
before
the
Labour
Court
.
the
report
recommend
that
NERA
be
authorise
to
bring
such
a
complaint
in
respect
of
either
a
REA
or
a
ero
.
I
welcome
the
proposal
to
decriminalise
the
initial
step
in
the
enforcement
process
of
ero
.
it
make
sense
,
as
Kevin
Duffy
and
Dr.
Walsh
have
recommend
,
to
allow
room
for
NERA
to
bring
a
complaint
to
the
Labour
Court
on
behalf
of
a
individual
or
group
of
worker
rather
than
retain
the
current
arrangement
where
enforcement
be
only
by
way
of
a
prosecution
before
the
District
Court
.
unfortunately
the
incorporation
of
the
propose
amendment
on
the
enforcement
of
ero
at
section
7
be
the
only
provision
in
the
Bill
that
respond
directly
to
the
specific
recommendation
in
the
independent
review
report
.
the
new
Bill
do
not
contain
any
provision
to
respond
to
other
specific
change
that
be
call
for
in
the
recommendation
of
the
Duffy
Walsh
report
.
recommendation
16
of
that
report
call
for
all
of
the
change
that
be
propose
in
the
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Bill
2009
to
be
enact
along
with
amendment
to
cover
the
additional
recommendation
make
in
the
report
regard
the
legislative
framework
within
which
both
the
ero
and
REA
system
operate
.
it
make
no
sense
to
tackle
this
task
in
a
piecemeal
way
or
to
leave
rea
to
the
mercy
of
some
continue
legal
challenge
.
unfortunately
this
Bill
do
not
address
the
significant
range
of
change
call
for
by
Kevin
Duffy
and
Dr.
Frank
Walsh
to
safeguard
the
statutory
wage
-
set
machinery
from
the
threat
of
constant
litigation
and
judicial
review
.
recommendation
1
of
the
independent
review
report
also
call
for
a
amendment
to
the
Industrial
Relation
act
of
1990
to
provide
a
means
whereby
the
scope
of
the
particular
establishment
order
of
jlc
could
be
review
by
the
Labour
Court
.
the
report
also
recommend
that
the
Labour
Court
be
empower
to
undertake
periodic
review
of
ero
in
the
interest
of
great
clarity
as
regards
they
purpose
and
the
classification
of
the
worker
and
the
type
of
enterprise
cover
.
action
with
regard
to
this
recommendation
will
be
crucial
to
provide
protection
for
ero
against
further
legal
challenge
.
recommendation
9
of
the
independent
review
report
also
call
for
amendment
to
be
make
to
the
Industrial
Relation
Act
of
1990
regard
the
constitution
and
proceedings
of
jlc
.
this
be
another
critical
area
in
which
action
be
now
require
in
light
of
the
high
court
ruling
.
unfortunately
at
a
time
when
it
be
vital
to
provide
more
certainty
for
vulnerable
worker
in
low

pay
sector
the
propose
Industrial

the

carry
out
the
survey
of

the

refer

I
acknowledge
the
rate
of

.
Preliminary
result
show
68
%
of

,
29

only
2
%
do
not
have
any

.
the
survey
finding
will
help
we
obtain
a
clear
picture
of
what
be
happen
in
school
and
allow
we
to
plan
to
meet
training
need
.
the
school
have
until
26
September
to
respond
.
the
Department
be
keen
to
arrive
at
a
position
in
which
all
teacher
of
mathematics
have
a
qualification
in
the
subject
.
it
be
make
arrangement
for
the
provision
of
a
new
training
programme
for
mathematics
teacher
which
will
provide
unqualified
mathematics
teacher
with
the
opportunity
to
upskill
they
knowledge
of
the
subject
and
study
the
strategy
well
suit
to
the
new
project
math
syllabus
.
tender
will
be
invite
shortly
.
we
can
overcome
the
challenge
face
we
notwithstand
the
recruitment
embargo
.
the
national
centre
of
excellence
in
the
University
of
Limerick
be
do
a
great
deal
of
work
in
the
area
of
continue
professional
development
to
enable
teacher
to
attain
the
require
standard
.
in
addition
,
there
be
conversion
course
that
can
be
do
.
in
this
way
we
can
ensure
we
have
a
coterie
of
teacher
with
the
right
skill
set
to
help
we
to
achieve
we
aim
.
the
question
of
how
we
get
to
this
point
be
one
that
would
have
to
be
tease
out
over
a
long
time
period
than
the
two
minute
I
have
.
however
,
if
we
be
open
to
the
challenge
,
which
we
be
,
we
must
find
out
where
we
need
to
go
.
deputy
Murphy
raise
valid
issue
about
fragmentation
,
with
which
I
agree
.
we
must
ensure
there
be
standardisation
across
the
board
and
that
the
Teaching
Council
and
the
individual
board
of
management
be
sing
from
the
same
hymn
sheet
in
term
of
what
we
need
to
achieve
.
however
,
I
be
confident
that
the
project
Maths
initiative
,
in
spite
of
whatever
hiccup
it
may
have
along
the
way
,
will
ensure
we
can
help
the
student
currently
achieve
E
,
F
and
ng
grade
to
move
up
the
scale
.
I
be
less
concerned
about
that
currently
achieve
a
,
b
and
C
grade
.
the
introduction
of
bonus
point
for
math
will
facilitate
that
student
who
choose
not
to
do
honour
math
because
it
be
time
consume
.
they
can
devote
more
time
to
ordinary
level
math
and
still
get
a
reasonable
number
of
point
.
there
will
be
a
tender
process
for

we

with
industry
and

in
this

,
but
there
be
challenge
.
we
will
not
turn
the
ship
around
within
the
next
12
month
.
however
,
we
be
engage
with
the
issue
in
a
deep
fashion
than
heretofore
.
base
on
the
sounding
I
have
take
outside
of
the
usual
advisory
group
—
I
have
delve
into
academia
and
seek
the
view
of
individual
teacher
—
there
be
a
sense
that
if
we
stay
on
track
with
Project
Maths
,
we
can
tackle
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
issue
involve
in
get
grade
up
.
I
apologise
for
not
give
deputy
Murphy
a
more
comprehensive
answer
,
but
I
will
be
happy
to
engage
further
with
she
on
a
individual
basis

I
thank
deputy
Smith
for
raise
this
matter
.
my
primary
concern
be
with
the
worker
face
uncertainty
today
.
take
account
of
the
domestic
economy
,
Aviva
have
decide
to
review
its
operation
to
ensure
its
capacity
be
in
line
with
domestic
demand
to
ensure
sustainability
.
Industry
figure
show
that
general
insurance
have
fall
by
more
than
20
%
in
the
past
two
year
,
while
life
insurance
and
pension
have
fall
by
more
than
30
%
,
due
to
concern
over
long
-
term
savings
and
people
cancel
or
reduce
pension
policy
.
Aviva
have
state
it
be
commit
fully
to
Ireland
and
be
currently
in
discussion
with
union
represent
staff
about
the
review
.
until
this
review
have
be
complete
,
it
would
be
premature
to
speculate
about
the
outcome
.
to
be
fair
,
it
be
pertinent
that
the
government
allow
the
union
to
engage
with
Aviva
to
see
where
that
process
might
go
.
as
for
the
role
of
the
IDA
,
the
deputy
have
great
knowledge
than
I
in
this
regard
and
be
well
aware
that
it
support
multinational
company
predominantly
trade
outside
Ireland
or
internationally
.
as
part
of
its
business
in
work
to
attract
international
activity
into
Ireland
from
multinational
company
,
the
IDA
have
be
in
contact
with
Aviva
at
both
corporate
and
local
level
.
the
minister
have
ask
the
IDA
,
give
its
knowledge
of
the
company
,
to
continue
to
work
with
it
to
mitigate
any
possible
negative
outcome
.
consequently
,
the
IDA
have
be
active
in
this
regard
.
Ireland
have
succeed
in
build
a
international
financial
service
industry
that
be
diverse
in
the
activity
carry
out
and
which
enjoy
a
world
-
lead
reputation
in
several
sector
.
while
the
past
three
year
have
represent
a
severe
stress
test
for
all
the
financial
centre
,
firm
at
the
International
Financial
Service
Centre
have
show
resilience
and
flexibility
.
employ
33000
people
directly
and
many
more
indirectly
,
the
IFSC
remain
both
critical
as
a
employer
and
as
a
centre
of
economic
activity
.
the
goal
of
ensure
that
job
and
economic
activity
be
protect
be
a
mainstay
for
the
government
and
I
ask
that
member
allow
further
review
to
take
place
and
for
the
discussion
to
conclude
with
the
union
represent
the
staff
.
the
government
undoubtedly
will
engage
at
a
late
point
.
yes
,
certainly
.
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
statement
.
there
be
no
sense
of
complacency
on
the
part
of
the
government
on
this
issue
.
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
the
cabinet
have
ask
the
IDA
,
give
its
knowledge
of
the
company
,
to
continue
to
work
with
it
to
mitigate
any
possible
negative
outcome
.
let
we
be
frank
.
I
can
dance
around
the
language
of
redundancy
and
job
loss
but
if
a
multinational
company
that
transcend
many
boundary
have
decide
the
course
of
action
it
will
take
,
it
be
difficult
for
government
to
influence
decision
.
nobody
want
job
loss
but
sometimes
decision
be
make
in
other
centre
,
financial
powerhouse
and
capital
city
other
than
Dublin
.
the
key
point
be
for
we
to
engage
with
the
company
and
try
to
move
it
from
its
current
trajectory
in
term
of
job
loss
.
we
will
do
everything
we
can
in
that
respect
.
if
the
company
make
a
decision
God
or
man
will
not
shift
it
.
we
should
be
honest
and
frank
about
the
discourse
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
the
same
situation
as
TalkTalk
do
not
arise
and
there
be
a
early
warning
system
that
ensure
we
can
engage
with
a
company
to
try
to
stem
the
flow
of
job
loss
and
learn
valuable
lesson
to
ensure
the
policy
be
taper
to
have
the
right
mix
of
company
.
I
will
engage
further
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
.
the
deputy
's
comment
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
and
I
will
relate
they
to
the
minister
and
the
IDA
.
the
Teaching
Council
recently
carry
out
a
survey
of
post
-
primary
school
to
ascertain
the
qualification
of
math
teacher
.
the
result
of
the
survey
show
that
a
significant
majority
of
teacher
—
68
%
—
teach
math
in
258
school
be
fully
qualified
to
do
so
,
that
29
%
have
pursue
some
study
in
math
and
that
only
2
%
have
not
obtain
third
level
qualification
or
pursue
study
in
math
.
the
Teaching
Council
have
ask
school
which
have
not
complete
the
early
survey
to
do
so
by
26
September
.
provide
for
high
quality
teaching
and
learning
of
mathematics
be
of
key
strategic
importance
to
the
State
.
as
part
of
the
government
's
overall
strategy
to
improve
the
teaching
and
learning
of
math
in
school
,
my
Department
be
make
arrangement
for
the
provision
of
a
new
training
programme
for
math
teacher
.
this
will
provide
unqualified
math
teacher
with
the
opportunity
to
upskill
they
knowledge
of
mathematics
and
study
the
strategy
well
suit
to
the
new
project
math
syllabus
.
to
give
the
deputy
a
straight
answer
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
do
this
.
as
he
be
well
aware
,
the
board
of
management
of
school
have
autonomy
in
respect
of
who
they
hire
and
fire
.
there
be
a
issue
of
governance
in
that
regard
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
faith
in
the
process
be
undertake
.
we
must
obtain
the
result
of
the
survey
and
analyse
they
.
as
announce
on
12
September
,
a
programme
that
will
allow
for
continue
education
and
continue
professional
development
,
CPD
,
for
unqualified
math
teacher
be
to
be
roll
out
.
the
contract
in
this
regard
be
due
to
go
to
tender
shortly
.
I
would
be
cautious
with
regard
to
the
Department
exercising
control
over
decision
make
by
individual
school
.
again
,
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
faith
.
we
will
analyse
the
result
of
the
survey
and
proceed
cautiously
.
there
must
be
a
outcome
which
ensure
teacher
be
properly
qualified
and
that
student
obtain
good
result
in
they
examination
.
in
that
context
,
we
must
seek
to
ensure
there
be
a
deep
engagement
in
this
matter
.
we
will
not
turn
the
ship
around
overnight
;
it
be
go
to
take
some
time
to
do
this
.
be
the
deputy
refer
to
the
teaching
of
math
?
I
ask
that
the
deputy
table
a
separate
parliamentary
question
on
that
matter
.
this
question
relate
to
the
teaching
of
math
.
with
regard
to
deputy
Smith
's
question
,
there
be
no
exact
figure
for
the
take
-
up
of
CPD
.
however
,
I
will
endeavour
to
come
back
to
he
at
a
late
date
with
additional
information
on
the
matter
.
if
he
be
ask
whether
I
be
satisfied
with
the
rate
of
reply
to
the
survey
,
the
straight
answer
be
that
I
be
not
.
the
school
have
until
26
September
to
provide
response
to
it
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
have
some
forbearance
and
allow
we
to
assess
the
position
at
that
point
.
the
Department
and
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
be
extremely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
we
must
grapple
with
this
issue
.
we
must
do
so
on
the
basis
that
we
will
be
provide
with
a
true
picture
of
the
actual
scenario
.
in
that
context
,
the
agency
and
stakeholder
involve
have
be
give
a
clear
signal
to
the
effect
that
we
require
sound
datum
.
we
cannot
make
proper
policy
decision
unless
such
datum
which
must
be
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
be
forthcoming
.
I
hope
the
deputy
will
accept
my
comment
on
this
matter
in
good
faith
.
in
relation
to
concern
regard
the
teaching
of
mathematics
,
I
expect
to
receive
shortly
full
figure
from
a
Teaching
Council
survey
of
the
qualification
of
mathematics
teacher
in
second
level
school
.
Initial
indication
from
the
school
which
have
respond
,
approximately
one
third
,
be
that
some
68
%
of
math
teacher
be
fully
qualified
to
do
so
,
29
%
have
undergyne
some
study
in
math
and
2
%
have
no

qualification
/
study
in
math
.

as

we

the
purpose

narrow

that
the

to
put

even
high

this
evolutionary

have
be
put

it
be
only
successful
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
organisation

the

it

not

a
great
leap
forward
within
the
next
thee
or
four
month
because
we
must
still
address
a
deficit
issue
which
have
be
acknowledge
by
all
side
of
the
House
.
there
will
be
difference
over
the
manner
in
which
we
continue
to
address
the
deficit
,
but
we
still
have
that
restraint
in
term
of
we
public
finances
which
hamper
one
's
ability
to
concentrate
solely
on
stimulus
.
it
will
be
a
mix
of
stimulus
and
retrenchment
,
which
be
the
reality
of
the
situation
.
I
will
not
blame
past
government
but
will
rather
look
forward
to
we
FDI
and
strong
export
sector
.
my
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
John
Perry
,
will
soon
be
receive
the
first
draft
report
of
the
small
business
advisory
group
.
he
announce
today
that
county
enterprise
board
will
get
another
€
3.1
million
.
this
be
all
initiative
which
locally
and
nationally
will
create
the
type
of
stimulus
we
need
.
it
be
a
slow
,
incremental
process
but
we
heart
and
mind
be
in
the
right
place
.
if
I
be
to
engage
in
a
bit
of
rhetoric
along
with
some
of
my
counterpart
in
opposition
,
I
would
say
that
to
govern
be
to
choose
.
that
mean
we
will
have
to
make
tough
decision
in
future
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
be
try
to
keep
the
basic
right
.
I
would
like
to
address
the
habitat
directive
and
farming
,
as
deputy
have
refer
to
they
.
the
"
food
harvest
2020
"
document
have
be
buy
into
by
all
stakeholder
involve
in
the
rural
economy
,
include
the
co-operative
movement
and
farming
organisation
.
we
will
see
tangible
growth
in
that
area
,
but
the
challenge
be
whether
it
will
be
jobless
growth
.
I
acknowledge
we
must
be
cognisant
of
that
also
.
flooding
be
refer
to
and
the
deputy
mention
he
inability
to
get
information
on
the
habitat
directive
.
however
,
not
one
deputy
in
the
technical
Group
have
ever
approach
I
as
a
minister
to
ask
for
any
kind
of
briefing
on
the
area
I
represent
,
which
be
a
foundation
for
the
growth
we
be
talk
about
.
like
other
minister
,
my
door
be
open
to
any
member
of
the
House
in
order
to
engage
with
they
constructively
on
any
aspect
.
let
we
do
away
with
the
rhetoric
that
have
fill
the
air
for
a
long
time
.
we
will
work
together
constructively
with
that
on
the
Opposition
bench
.
I
extend
the
invitation
.
I
extend
the
invitation
to
Opposition
Member
to
engage
with
we
on
a
personal
level
and
we
will
do
everything
we

to

I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
as
I
report
to
the
House
on
the
22
September
,
Aviva
be
undertake
a
review
of
its
operation
in
response
to
a
significant
reduction
in
demand
for
insurance
and
pension
product
.
Aviva
have
find
it
necessary
to
review
its
operation
here
to
ensure
its
cost
base
be
in
line
with
domestic
demand
to
ensure
sustainability
.
the
ceo
of
Aviva
Ireland
have
assure
the
minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
that
no
decision
have
be
take
on
the
final
structure
or
potential
job
loss
.
he
have
also
confirm
that
Aviva
be
commit
to
remain
a
significant
player
in
the
Irish
insurance
and
assurance
market
.
as
the
ceo
of
Aviva
have
confirm
that
the
company
be
in
ongoing
contact
with
employee
representative
,
it
would
be
premature
to
speculate
about
the
outcome
.
to
be
fair
,
it
be
pertinent
that
the
government
allow
the
union
to
engage
with
Aviva
to
see
where
that
process
might
lead
.
the
company
have
give
a
commitment
to
communicate
the
result
of
the
review
to
my
Department
and
IDA
Ireland
when
complete
.
we
anticipate
that
the
review
will
be
complete
by
the
end
of
October
.
in
the
interim
,
IDA
Ireland
be
in
contact
with
the
company
at
both
corporate
and
local
level
,
with
the
intention
of
mitigating
the
impact
of
potential
negative
outcome
follow
the
review
.
IDA
Ireland
be
also
in
dialogue
with
the
company
on
potential
future
opportunity
in
respect
of
the
company
's
significant
international
business
.
in
this
context
,
recent
media
coverage
do
not
reflect
a
formal
announcement
by
the
company
.
the
review
of
its
operation
be
ongoing
and
the
company
have
not
officially
confirm
the
scale
of
potential
job
loss
.
my
Department
,
through
IDA
Ireland
,
be
monitor
the
situation
closely
and
will
engage
further
with
the
company
at
any
stage
.
let
we
be
straight
.
if
a
global
company
such
as
Aviva
decide
to
restructure
,
it
be
pertinent
,
if
there
be
engagement
with
the
trade
union
in
the
organisation
,
that
we
allow
such
a
process
to
proceed
.
I
have
state
IDA
Ireland
be
in
dialogue
with
the
company
on

future
opportunity
.
I
have
also
state
it

in
contact
with
the
company
at
both
corporate

local
level
,
with
a
view
to
mitigating
the
impact
of
potential
negative
outcome
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
which
I
will
pass
on
to
IDA
Ireland
.
however
,
it
be
vital
that
we
allow
the
review
to
take
place
.
the
ceo
have
assure
the
minister
that
no
decision
have
be
take
on
the
final
structure
and
potential
job
loss
.
however
,
it
be
important
that
we
take
on
board
what
the
deputy
be
say
and
reflect
the
concern
outline
and
the
view
that
IDA
Ireland
raise
the
ante
in
advance
of
the
review
.
that
be
a
fair
point
.

to

set
out
the
context
in

.

,
in

the
Irish
Patent
Office
provide
for
the
granting
of
patent
and
register
of
trademark
and
industrial
design
.
in
1964
,
a
new
Patent
Act
be
pass
to
bring
we
legislation
in
line
with
that
of
the
main
industrial
country
.
this
reflect
Ireland
's
outward
look
focus
for
economic
development
through
international
commerce
,
which
have
continue
to
this
day
.
the
main
body
of
Irish
patent
law
be
contain
in
the
Patent
Act
1992
which
now
serve
to
meet
we
national
need
and
we
international
obligation
.
over
the
past
decade
,
it
have
become
clear
that
Ireland
's
international
competitiveness
depend
increasingly
on
goods
and
service
,
which
have
high
knowledge
content
.
a
recent
report
show
that
enterprise
across
all
business
sector
spend
almost
€
1.8
billion
on
research
and
development
activity
in
2010
.
a
effective
patent
system
be
the
key
to
convert
that
investment
into
economic
growth
.
it
be
imperative
that
this
knowledge
be
capture
at
the
early
stage
,
protect
and
exploit
to
its
full
potential
.
today
,

through

Office

be
a
intergovernmental
institution
comprise
38
country
,
the
EU
27
along
with
11
other
European
country
.
the
function
of
the
office
be
to
examine
patent
application
and
grant
a
European
patent
if
the
relevant
condition
be
meet
.
it
be
worth
note
that
patent
application
originate
in
Ireland
to
the
European

Office
have
be
increase
steadily
,
underline
the
importance
to

of

protection
.
patent
application
to
the
epo
have
risen
by
44
%
and
grant
of
European
patent
to
Irish
applicant
have
increase
by
21
%
since
2004
.
unfortunately
,
the
European
patent
process
can
be
expensive
and
complex
which
can
act
as
a
disincentive
,
especially
for
small
and
medium
-
size
firm
.
a
company
wish
to
protect
its
invention
across
Europe
apply
to
the
European
patent
Office
for
a
patent
.
once
a
European
patent
be
grant
by
the
office
the
proprietor
must
designate
the
country
where
he
or
she
want
patent
protection
and
then
the
patent
must
be
validate
in
each
member
state
.
at
this
stage
the
European
patent
effectively
become
a
bundle
of
national
patent
.
to
validate
a
patent
,
a
full
translation
of
the
patent
must
be
lodge
in
each
country
designate
,
in
the
national
language
of
that
country
.
this
translation
cost
make
up
a
very
sizeable
portion
of
the
cost
of
acquire
a
European
patent
and
the
cost
must
be
borne
by
the
applicant
.
as
a
result
,
the
European
patent
be
uncompetitive
when
compare
with
the
cost
of
obtain
US
and
Japanese
patent
.
let
I
put
the
matter
in
real
term
.
a
European
patent
validate
in
13
European
country
be
about
ten
time
more
expensive
than
a
US
patent
and
13
time
more
expensive
than
a
Japanese
patent
when
process
and
translation
cost
be
take
into
account
.
it
have
be
estimate
that
validate
a
patent
in
27
country
cost
€
32000
,
of
which
€
23000
be
for
translation
alone
.
Anecdotal
evidence
suggest
this
translation
into
national
language
be
hardly
ever
consult
.
only
1
%
of
patent
go
down
the
litigation
route
and
in
the
event
that
a
court
case
ensue
,
the
authentic
text
of
the
patent
before
the
judge
be
always
the
patent
text
as
grant
by
the
European
patent
Office
.
meanwhile
,
the
national
translation
require
all
over
Europe
remain
in
the
drawer
.
moreover
,
it
usually
take
four
or
five
year
to
process
and
grant
a
patent
in
the
European
patent
Office
.
consequently
,
this
translation
do
not
serve
the
purpose
of
inform
the
public
about
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
new
technology
,
as
they
be
only
require
to
be
file
after
the
patent
have
be
grant
.
there
be
other
cost
associate
with
the
translation
requirement
such
as
filing
and
publication
fee
to
local
national
office
.
local
patent
agent
often
act
as
intermediary
between
the
patent
proprietor
and
the
national
patent
office
where
the
translation
be
to
be
file
.
this
patent
agent
take
on
the
role
of
ensure
formal
requirement
lay
down
by
national
law
be
comply
with
and
the
correct
fee
be
pay
.
obviously
,
the
patent
agent
have
to
be
pay
for
provide
this
service
and
a
recent
study
conduct
by
the
European
Commission
conclude
that
this
cost
vary
from
around
€
150
to
€600
per
validation
,
depend
on
the
member
state
involve
.
if
a
patent
be
be
validate
in
a
number
of
country
,
we
can
see
how
this
cost
can
mount
up
.
they
particularly
affect
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
young
innovative
company
,
start
-
up
company
and
public
research
university
.
research
show
that
Irish
industry
,
as
elsewhere
,
often
take
a
selective
cost
effective
approach
when
designate
state
for
patent
protection
,
thus
leave
the
patent
vulnerable
in
that
state
not
designate
.
in
order
to
reduce
this
cost
,
a
intergovernmental
conference
hold
in
London
in
2000
adopt
the
London
agreement
.
this
agreement
,
which
enter
into
force
in
May
2008
,
set
out
to
reduce
the
cost
to
applicant
by
ease
the
requirement
to
file
translation
of
grant
patent
under
the
European
patent
Convention
in
that
country
that
sign
up
to
the
agreement
.
the
overall
aim
of
the
agreement
be
to
reduce
the
cost
of
translation
across
the
38
member
state
by
50
%
.
in
order
to
reach
this
level
of
reduction
,
it
be
vital
that
all
member
state
of
the
European
patent
Convention
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
.
article
65
of
the
European
patent
Convention
provide
that
any
contracting
state
may
require
a
translation
of
the
text
of
a
European
patent
into
one
of
its
language
,
if
that
language
be
different
from
the
language
in
which
the
patent
be
grant
.
under
the
London
agreement
,
the
party
to
the
agreement
undertake
to
waive
,
entirely
or
largely
,
the
requirement
for
translation
of
European
patent
to
be
file
in
they
national
language
.
in
effect
,
under
the
agreement
,
state
with
English
,
French
or
German
as
a
official
language
will
dispense
with
translation
requirement
entirely
for
the
patent
to
come
into
effect
.
have
English
as
a
official
language
,
Ireland
would
have
to
dispense
with
the
requirement
to
seek
a
translation
into
English
of
the
detailed
specification
of
European
patent
draw
up
in
French
or
German
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
claim
which
be
the
core
part
of
the
patent
that
define
the
limit
of
the
monopoly
would
continue
to
be
available
in
English
after
grant
.
section
119
(
6
)
of
the
Patent
Act
1992
require
that
a
European
patent
designate
Ireland
and
draw
up
in
either
French
or
German
must
have
its
specification
translate
into
English
for
that
patent
to
be
validate
in
Ireland
.
it
be
necessary
to
delete
section
119
(
6
)
and
corresponding
subsection
where
reference
to
this
translation
be
make
in
order
to
give
full
effect
in
we
legislation
to
the
London
agreement
.
in
order
to
assess
the
implication
for
Irish
inventor
and
business
,
my
Department
carry
out
a
regulatory
impact
assessment
of
the
London
agreement
in
2009
.
it
conclude
that
the
main
advantage
of
the
agreement
for
Irish
inventor
seek
patent
protection
abroad
be
that
they
would
no
long
be
require
to
furnish
translation
to
the
extent
currently
require
in
that
country
which
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
.
this
would
lead
to
significant
savings
when
filing
in
other
non-English
language
European
state
.
Translation
cost
,
publication
fee
and
patent
attorney
fee
would
be
reduce
,
with
the
great
save
on
translation
cost
.
for
example
in
2007
,
there
be
126
European
patent
grant
originate
from
Ireland
.
twenty
-
eight
state
be
designate
and
the
total
cost
of
translation
to
protect
the
patent
be
estimate
at
€
6
million
,
a
significant
cost
to
industry
.
this
figure
do
not
include
the
filing
and
publication
fee
to
the
national
office
or
patent
attorney
's
fee
.
the
London
agreement
be
a
optional
agreement
and
to
date
16
country
have
sign
it
.
however
,
we
accession
to
the
agreement
should
encourage
other
member
state
to
accede
,
thereby
reduce
further
the
cost
for
Irish
inventor
when
file
in
other
non-English
language
European
state
.
the
more
member
involve
,
the
great
the
benefit
to
European
business
.
I
see
the
Bill
as
just
the
first
step
in
reduce
the
burden
of
cost
involve
in
protect
patent
internationally
.
on
the
European
Union
front
,
we
be
work
with
other
member
state
towards
the
creation
of
unitary
patent
protection
that
will
have
the
effect
of
reduce
the
cost
of
registration
and
enforcement
of
patent
for
business
.
the
commission
's
proposal
for
a
single
EU
patent
have
be
under
discussion
for
over
50
year
and
we
be
finally
see
some
progress
.
at
the
EU
Competitiveness
Council
in
March
of
this
year
the
Council
authorise
the
use
of
the
enhance
co-operation
procedure
for
the
creation
of
unitary
patent
protection
in
that
member
state
that
wish
to
join
.
Ireland
be
one
of
25
member
state
which
be
forge
ahead
to
achieve
a
simple
,
cheap
and
more
robust
patent
system
in
the
European
Union
that
have
elude
we
of
decade
.
this
measure
,
when
fully
implement
,
will
enable
Irish
-
base
holder
of
patent
to
seek
protection
for
they
patent
across
the
25
member
state
support
the
unitary
patent
protection
—
represent
79
%
of
the
territory
of
the
European
Union
—
for
a
fraction
of
current
cost
.
the
commission
estimate
that
by
implement
unitary
patent
protection
,
the
overall
savings
to
European
business
could
reach
€
50
million
per
year
,
even
in
the
early
stage
.
this
cost
reduction
should
particularly
benefit
Irish
start
-
up
firm
and
small
business
.
when
fully
implement
,
this
measure
will
facilitate
a
big
reduction
in
cost
and
red
tape
which
will
provide
a
stimulus
for
European
innovation
and
make
patent
more
accessible
to
all
company
in
the
European
Union
.
enact
the
Bill
,
combine
with
we
accession
to
the
London
agreement
,
will
remove
the
current
expensive
translation
requirement
which
be
likely
to
lead
to
Ireland
be
designate
in
more
patent
application
and
to
more
patent
-
related
activity
in
Ireland
.
it
be
expect
that
more
inventor
and
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
currently
deter
from
register
patent
because
of
the
high
cost
involve
,
will
be
attract
to
protect
they
intellectual
property
across
Europe
.
this
will
further
support
Ireland
's
effort
to
generate
economic
growth
through
promote
and
innovate
good
process
and
product
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
I
thank
all
of
the
Deputy
who
have
contribute
to
the
debate
.
some
have
be
pertinent
to
the
legislation
before
we
,
other
arguably
not
so
.
I
will
seek
to
address
the
point
that
be
raise
in
regard
to
the
legislation
itself
.
as
a
aside
,
there
be
only
one
deputy
Finian
McGrath
and
one
could
not
patent
he
if
one
try
.
I
will
start
with
the
point
raise
about
the
UK
patent
box
regime
and
the
royalty
exemption
and
other
relief
that
be
suggest
by
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
and
also
the
point
raise
by
deputy
Donohoe
.
that
be
be
consider
at
present
under
the
budgetary
process
.
I
note
the
point
,
which
be
well
make
,
and
we
should
hear
more
about
it
anon
.
we
be
talk
about
innovation
,
utilise
human
capital
and
allow
for
where
someone
who
be
creative
and
have
a
idea
that
become
the
subject
of
a
patent
to
have
as
easy
as
possible
a
transition
of
that
idea
to
commercialisation
.
the
London
agreement
would
facilitate
that
process
through
the
translation
arrangement
.
that
be
really
what
we
be
talk
about
in
this
context
.
the
propose
change
in
the
legislation
would
result
in
a
modest
loss
of
revenue
to
the
Patent
Office
in
term
of
fee
for
translation
.
in
the
context
of
this
country
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
,
a
applicant
must
lodge
a
translation
in
the
office
within
six
month
of
grant
of
the
patent
together
with
a
fee
of
€
35
.
in
2010
that
come
to
€
33,215
.
the
level
of
renewal
fee
be
likely
to
increase
if
we
accede
to
the
agreement
and
it
be
likely
that
owe
to
the
lack
of
translation
requirement
,
this
country
will
be
designate
in
more
patent
application
to
the
European
Patent
Office
,
EPO
.
on
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
on
the
protection
system
,
the
unitary
patent
protection
system
will
address
the
excessive
cost
in
Europe
.
that
be
without
question
.
the
feasibility
of
the
international
content
clear
centre
,
which
be
raise
by
deputy
Donohoe
,
be
currently
under
examination
by
a
group
from
my
Department
which
include
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
.
there
be
a
process
under
way
in
respect
of
that
project
.
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
raise
point
on
the
physical
manifestation
of
the
patent
invention
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
direction
patent
application
be
take
worldwide
be
that
of
a
electronic
on
-
line
application
,
but
I
would
like
to
hear
more
from
deputy
Murphy
on
this
one
,
perhaps
at
a
late
stage
and
even
on
committee
stage
.
we
can
address
this
further
if
necessary
in
a
more
substantive
sense
.
the
question
of
tax
relief
on
patent
royalty
be
currently
under
review
in
advance
of
the
next
budget
,
and
that
should
address
deputy
Mitchell
O'Connor
's
point
on
the
UK
regime
.
there
be
many
other
point
raise
.
deputy
O'Dea
ask
when
the
EU
patent
will
come
into
effect
and
about
the
current
position
.
the
concept
of
the
EU
patent
,
previously
community
patent
,
be
to
provide
a
patent
system
that
will
be
affordable
,
especially
for
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
will
provide
automatic
patent
coverage
in
all
member
state
of
the
European
Union
.
as
deputy
O'Dea
point
out
,
as
protract
negotiation
over
many
year
fail
to
reach
agreement
on
the
EU
patent
,
the
Commission
have
request
to
examine
the
possibility
of
bring
a
proposal
under
enhance
co-operation
whereby
unitary
patent
protection
apply
to
this
member
state
willing
to
participate
will
be
introduce
.
so
far
,
25
out
of
the
27
member
state
of
the
EU
have
indicate
a
willingness
to
take
part
and
the
commission
envisage
that
the
first
unitary
patent
protection
will
issue
in
2013
.
as
be
the
case
normally
with
any
European
initiative
,
I
would
not
be
hold
to
that
timeframe
.
I
thank
the
Member
for
they
contribution
to
the
debate
.
in
my
introductory
speech
,
I
set
out
the
rationale
for
the
propose
patent
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
and
outline
the
financial
burden
on
industry
in
provide
the
full
translation
of
the
European
patent
to
ensure
full
protection
of
the
patent
across
Europe
.
I
also
state
that
this
translation
be
rarely
consult
and
,
as
such
,
offer
little
or
no
advantage
,
either
to
the
patent
holder
or
user
of
the
system
.
it
be
imperative
,
both
from
a
Irish
and
European
perspective
,
that
business
be
not
hamper
by
a
system
that
be
inefficient
and
costly
.
access
to
a
cost
-
effective
and
efficient
patent
system
be
key
to
stimulate
innovation
.
under
the
current
regime
,
the
high
cost
of
translate
grant
patent
act
as
a
deterrent
to
business
and
as
a
consequence
,
be
a
deterrent
to
innovation
.
currently
,
more
than
50
%
of
all
enterprise
in
Ireland
continue
to
engage
in
considerable
research
and
development
activity
in
spite
of
the
difficult
economic
environment
.
it
be
vital
that
they
innovation
be
capture
and
exploit
in
the
good
way
possible
.
a
patent
system
in
which
user
have
limited
access
due
to
high
translation
cost
do
not
serve
this
purpose
and
the
cost
savings
from
the
London
agreement
should
have
a
positive
effect
on
research
and
development
,
allow
for
resource
save
on
translation
to
be
reallocate
to
further
research
and
development
and
other
business
activity
.
that
be
the
kernel
of
this
legislation
.
I
hope
deputy
Clare
Daly
,
who
speak
about
taxation
of
corporate
,
get
the
point
of
this
legislation
.
it
be
about
be
able
to
facilitate
that
who
be
innovator
,
that
who
be
Irish
who
want
to
get
out
into
other
market
and
who
have
idea
.
we
facilitate
that
process
by
implement
the
London
agreement
so
that
we
can
make
that
passage
as
easy
as
possible
for
young
people
,
for
researcher
and
for
industry
.
I
hope
this
do
not
sound
patronising
.
I
suggest
that
every
member
of
this
House
,
if
they
have
a
opportunity
to
do
so
,
should
engage
with
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
,
IDA
Ireland
and
all
of
we
academic
institution
to
delve
into
,
and
inform
themselves
of
,
the
interaction
between
research
,
intellectual
property
copyright
and
the
innovation
and
commercialisation
take
place
.
I
have
undergyne
such
a
education
process
.
every
day
one
learn
more
about
this
field
.
before
member
come
into
the
House
and
make
sweeping
statement
about
taxation
of
innovation
,
they
should
be
well
inform
about
the
process
.
I
say
that
respectfully
and
in
a
debate
manner
in
the
spirit
in
which
we
debate
this
issue
in
the
House
.
it
be
not
mean
as
a
personal
statement
to
any
one
person
in
particular
.
we
should
be
careful
about
the
language
we
use
in
implement
legislation
.
this
be
technical
legislation
.
that
be
all
it
be
.
it
be
to
the
common
good
.
there
be
some
contention
that
it
may
not
be
,
but
I
argue
forcefully
that
it
be
to
the
common
good
ultimately
and
it
will
be
beneficial
to
this
country
.
the
more
country
that
sign
up
to
the
agreement
,
the
great
the
save
will
be
across
Europe
.
in
essence
,
by
even
one
country
join
up
,
the
savings
be
significant
.
it
have
be
estimate
that
since
the
entry
into
force
of
the
London
agreement
in
2008
,
on
average
savings
of
38
%
on
translation
cost
have
be
achieve
.
the
result
speak
for
themselves
.
that
be
what
we
be
try
to
achieve
here
today
.
on
some
other
point
raise
,
the
Patent
Office
run
business
seminar
across
the
country
aim
at
sme
,
start
-
up
and
entrepreneur
,
and
this
seminar
be
entitle
,
"
Building
a
business
on
you
idea
"
.
that
be
a
pertinent
point
.
it
speak
to
the
issue
of
innovation
and
how
ordinary
people
can
become
involved
in
the
process
if
they
have
idea
,
and
there
be
a
excellent
programme
,
through
the
Patent
Office
,
that
seek
to
achieve
that
.
the
seminar
include
talk
on
all
element
of
intellectual
property
,
ip
,
how
to
identify
ip
within
a
business
and
how
to
protect
it
.
they
also
provide
talk
on
State
support
to
industry
and
they
be
extremely
useful
.
on
deputy
Clare
Daly
's
point
,
the
number
of
patent
application
,
originate
in
Ireland
,
to
the
European
patent
Office
be
510
in
2010
,
a
slight
increase
from
498
in
2009
.
the
late
figure
for
patent
filing
in
2010
rank
Ireland
14th
of
the
38
country
in
the
European
patent
organisation
and
we
rank
23rd
in
the
patent
Cooperation
Treaty
international
ranking
which
cover
most
country
worldwide
.
however
,
it
be
important
to
make
the
point
that
the
number
of
national
patent
application
be
not
a
indicator
of
patent
activity
in
Ireland
.
in
Ireland
,
many
of
the
multinational
company
,
which
employ
thousand
and
which
undertake
and
fund
major
research
and
development
here
,
patent

.
patent
application
submit
by
large
multinational

in
the
Unite
State
,
for
example
,
would
not
show
Ireland
as
the
source
of
the
application
or
that
the
research
and
development
have
be
carry
out
in
Ireland
.
it
be
important
to
make
that
point
to
rebut
some
of
what
have
be
say
by
deputy
Clare
Daly
.
there
be
Irish
people
work
in
multinational
corporation
here
,
or
work
within
academic
institution
that
interface
with
that
same
corporation
,
who

on
Irish
intellectual

which
will
not
necessarily
be
register
as
Irish
,
but
it
be
still
Irish
people
produce
the
intellectual
property
and
that
be
the
most
important
point
.
it
form
the
basis
,
and
underpin
,
thousand
of

within
this
economy
.
it
be
important
to
send
out
a
more
positive
message
in
term
of
what
this
legislation
be
about
.

trade
mission
support
this
work
.
under
the
programme
for
government
,
the
Department
of

Trade
have
take
particular
responsibility
for
trade
promotion
.
this
mean
the
diplomatic
service
be
fully
engage
in
promote
trade
and
plan
have
be
develop
for
each
of
Ireland
's
target
market
.
the
Tánaiste
chair
the
new
export
council
which
bring
together
the
focus
of
this
work
.
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
be
engage
in
develop
trading
opportunity
in
emerge
economy
through
the
negotiation
of
free
-
trade
agreement
between
the
EU
and
third
country
and
improve
opportunity
for
exporter
can
also
emerge
from
reduction
in
tariff
and
non-tariff
barrier
through
trade
and
regulatory
discussion
between
the
EU
and
China
,
Russia
and
Brazil
.
to
answer
the
question
,
it
be
a
ongoing
process
and
one
must
speak
to
the
figure
.
between
2004
and
2010
,
merchandise
export
from
Ireland
to
Brazil
,
Russia
,
India
and
China
rise
by
approximately
122
%
and
in
the
same
period
service
export
to
that
country
rise
by688
%
.
another
key
example
of
this
success
be
the
fact
that
Ireland
now
have
a
significant
trade
surplus
with
China
,
which
be
a
dramatic
turnaround
from
the
position
only
four
year
previously
when
we
have
a
deficit
of
approximately
€
2.9
billion
.
I
understand
that
for
the
year
to
date
export
have
increase
by
approximately
6
%
—
—
the
overall
year
to
date
figure
show
a
increase
from
last
year
and
export
from
indigenous
industry
have
increase
by
approximately
10
%
.
the
omen
be
good
on
the
export
side
.
the
creation
of
the
export
trade
council
,
which
arise
from
the
trade
,
tourism
and
investment
strategy
,
signal
a
clear
intention
by
the
government
,
as
per
the
programme
for
government
,
to
drive
export
even
further
in
the
country
I
mention
early
.
the
new
council
's
membership
include
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Leo
Varadkar
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
and
senior
representative
from
the
relevant
agency
and
Department
.
this
derive
from
a
previous
policy
which
be
borne
out
of
common
sense
and
will
continue
.
there
be
great
emphasis
,
and
the
figure
bear
this
out
,
to
drive
export
in
the
so
-
call
BRIC
country
.
on
29
September
last
,
the
establishment
of
NewERA
be
announce
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
Minister
of
State
Fergus
O'Dowd
,
who
have
special
responsibility
for
NewERA
.
the
government
take
the
decision
to
establish
NewERA
to
reform
the
manner
in
which
government
manage
its
shareholding
in
the
semi-State
company
.
it
be
one
of
the
key
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
and
be
central
to
we
plan
for
investment
.
NewERA
will
initially
be
establish
on
a
non-statutory
basis
as
a
shareholder
executive
within
the
NTMA
.
it
will
have
responsibility
for
review
capital
investment
plan
of
the
commercial
semi-State
company
from
a
shareholder
perspective
and
will
identify
possible
synergy
between
investment
programme
of
different
State
company
.
the
company
in
question
be
the
ESB
,
Bord
Gáis
,
EirGrid
,
Bord
to
Móna
and
Coillte
.
the
decision
to
establish
NewERA
be
a
important
element
in
the
government
's
strategy
to
create
job
and
promote
economic
growth
.
the
operation
of
NewERA
will
be
overseen
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
economic
infrastructure
,
of
which
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
a
member
.
the
government
be
do
everything
it
can
to
create
job
and
improve
Irish
infrastructure
.
part
of
this
be
to
ensure
that
critical
infrastructure
be
put
in
place
to
allow
enterprise
to
grow
now
and
in
the
future
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
which
arise
in
traditional
and
emerge
sector
.
the
fact
that
deputy
Fergus
O'Dowd
be
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
NewERA
be
incidental
in
term
of
this
be
a
whole
government
approach
to
the
issue
.
we
should
not
underestimate
the
fact
that
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
on
the
cabinet
sub
-committee
.
there
be
a
corporate
view
at
government
level
between
the
two
party
of
government
of
the
need
to
ensure
we
have
a
entity
that
will
carry
out
a
corporate
governance
function
from
a
shareholder
perspective
and
that
will
report
to
the
relevant
minister
and
be
overseen
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
economic
infrastructure
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
it
be
a
whole
of
government
approach
.
through
NewERA
,
the
government
be
take
control
of
the
infrastructure
as
per
the
semi-State
company
involve
.
regard
the
second
part
of
the
question
on
the
job
target
,
the
key
emphasis
be
to
ensure
we
get
it
up
and
run
.
we
must
get
the
key
strategic
infrastructure
fund
in
place
through
the
NPRF
and
we
must
become
more
efficient
in
term
of
how
we
run
this
company
.
infrastructure
be
the
key
at
this
point
.
there
be
a
commitment
in
line
with
obligation
to
the
troika
in
respect
of
non-strategic
state
asset
.
deputy
O'Dea
be
aware
of
why
we
be
in
that
position
.
the
key
issue
be
that
,
follow
the
appropriate
legislative
change
,
resource
will
be
channel
from
the
NPRF
to
productive
investment
.
we
be
talk
about
productive
investment
in
the
Irish
economy
.
I
realise
there
may
not
be
a
specific
target
of
a
number
of
job
.
although
one
of
the
party
in
government
set
out
a
specific
target
as
part
of
its
manifesto
,
there
be
a
programme
for
government
and
a
clear
convergence
in
term
of
what
both
party
be
try
to
achieve
.
we
must
be
mindful
of
target
and
ensure
we
have
a
efficient
organisation
in
NewERA
to
manage
infrastructure
and
investment
in
partnership
with
the
NPRF
,
use
the
strategic
infrastructure
fund
,
which
will
be
the
forerunner
to
the
strategic
infrastructure
bank
.
discussion
with
the
troika
be
ongoing
this
week
in
respect
of
the
issue
.
we
be
ensure
that
we
can
leverage
state
asset
to
create
job
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
have
a
political
philosophical
view
on
sell
state
asset
that
must
be
respect
but
there
be
a
process
of
engagement
with
the
troika
in
which
commitment
be
give
by
this
government
,
which
be
sovereign
.
we
be
not
go
to
disavow
that
commitment
but
,
as
a
government
,
we
be
in
the
business
of
seek
to
ensure
we
can
get
out
of
this
economic
morass
.
the
sale
of
state
asset
be
one
mechanism
by
which
we
can
do
this
.
we
want
to
create
a
efficient
tool
call
NewERA
so
we
can
ensure
that
we
can
leverage
the
asset
to
create
job
.
I
cannot
give
a
exact
answer
of
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
for
the
number
of
job
we
can
create
.
the
asset
will
be
use
in
a
way
that
seek
to
leverage
they
to
create
job
and
we
have
not
maximise
the
potential
of
that
State
asset
heretofore
.
my
Department
recently
carry
out
a
public
consultation
in
regard
to
this
matter
.
the
consultation
document
set
out
the
background
to
the
matter
arise
from
the
judgment
issue
by
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
in
the
high
Court
in
the
case
of
EMI
Records
(
Ireland
)
Limited
and
other
v.
UPC
Communication
Ireland
Limited
.
it
indicate
that
it
have
be
consider
heretofore
that
injunction
,
as
require
under
Directive
2001
/
29
/
EC
of
the
European

available
in
Irish
law
under
subsection
40
(
4
)
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
.
however
,
in
the
judgment
refer
to
,
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
hold
that
he
be
constrain
by
the
wording
of
the
2000
act
and
could
not
grant
a
injunction
,
as
seek
,
in
regard
to
infringement
of

against
a

service
provider
in
the

of
"
mere
conduit
"
,
as
set
out
in
the
EU
e-commerce
directive
,
2000
/31
/
EC
.
accordingly
,
and
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
the
consultation
document
indicate
that
it
be
consider
necessary
to
restate
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the

concerned
.
in
propose
to
do
so
,
it
be
point
out
that
the
Department
be
particularly
conscious
of
the
importance
of
online
content
and
digital
business
in
the
Irish
context
and
that
,
accordingly
,
it
be
simply
seek
to
ensure
Ireland

continue
compliance
with
its
obligation
under
the
relevant
EU
directive
,
follow

legal
adviser
and
the
Attorney
General
's
office
.
I
will
not

I
want
to

EU
at
present
.
the
Road
Safety
Authority
(
RSA
)
represent
my
Department
at
this
discussion
and
I
be
inform
that
the
proposal
relate
only
to
vehicle
standard
,
not
to
the
vehicle
's
use
or
the
driver
,
and
specify
the
standard
to
be
apply
to
new
motorcycle
.
the
proposal
present
a
legal
framework
for
the
type
approval
and
increase
market
surveillance
of
moped
,
motorcycle
and
quad
,
which
will
replace
and
simplify
the
exist
Framework
directive
2002
/
24
/
ec
.
Contrary
to
suggestion
that
have
be
make
by
various
party
,
the
propose
regulation
do
not
include
provision
for
mandatory
wear
of
high
visibility
clothing
by
motorcyclist
,
ban
old
motorcycle
from
urban
area
or
change
to
driver
licensing
.
the
propose
regulation
be
design
to
improve
the
safety
of
that
who
belong
to
a
vulnerable
road
user
group
and
who
account
,
proportionately
,
for
the
high
fatality
and
injury
rate
among
all
road
user
.
the
main
element
of
the
propose
regulation
relate
to
mandatory
anti-lock
braking
system
,
prevention
of
tampering
with
the
powertrain
and
automatic
use
of
headlamp
on
.
the
regulation
be
also
design
to
reduce
vehicle
emission
for
this
type
of
vehicle
,
which
,
statistic
show
,
currently
be
not
reduce
in
line
with
other
road
vehicle
such
as
car
,
bus
and
goods
vehicle
.
the
Road
Safety
Authority
have
recently
publish
a
information
note
on
the
proposal
on
they
website
,
and
they
be
invite
feedback
from
stakeholder
and
the
general
public
before
29th
October
,
2011
.
the
RSA
's
Motorcycle
Safety
Action
plan
have
a
action
for
the
compulsory
wear
of
high
visibility
vest
by
2014
.
this
initiative
be
base
upon
research
into
road
traffic
collision
involve
motorcyclist
.
observation
study
conduct
by
the
Road
Safety
Authority
have
in
the
past
report
already
high
visibility
clothing
wear
rate
of
approximately
40
%
by
motorcyclist
in
Ireland
and
it
may
be
high
now
.
the
RSA
be
carry
out
a
follow
up
study
which
be
due
to
commence
this
month
.
the
RSA
will
have
analyse
the
datum
and
will
release
the
finding
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
in
the
event
that
there
be
high
wear
rate
by
2014
,
the
Road
Safety
Authority
will
then
re-evaluate
the
need
for
compulsory
wear
of
high
-
visibility
vest
.
however
if
there
be
a
need
to
make
a
high
visibility
vest
compulsory
,
the
Road
Safety
Authority
will
not
make
a
decision
on
the
type
of
high
visibility
vest
without
consult
with
motorcyclist
and
the
industry
.
it
be
the
intention
of
the
RSA
to
encourage
the
use
of
high
visibility
vest
by
offer
they
free
of
charge
to
motorcyclist
.
do
the
deputy
support
it
?
why
be
deputy
speak
to
it
then
?
I
actually
think
the
deputy
be
bluff
.
the
deputy
will
give
we
the
usual
diatribe
about
the
state
of
the
globe
and
he
political
view
.
why
do
the
deputy
not
talk
about
the
legislation
before
we
?
the
deputy
should
give
we
a
critique
of
the
legislation
,
as
he
see
it
.
be
that
not
laudable
?

the

present

for

and

from
the

:
the

as
a

for
export
,
growth
and
job
;
the

of
key

;
the
regulatory

the

.
the
Secretary
General
of

Department
,
upon

recent

,
submit
a
draft
interim

this

be
currently
be
review
by
the

and
it
be
intend
that
the
group
will
meet
shortly
for
the
purpose
of
agree
the
content
of
the
report
and
a
action
plan
to
implement
its
recommendation
.
the
group
's
final
report
be
expect
before
the
end
of
this
year
.
Ireland
be
extremely
well
place
to
take
advantage
of
the
rapidly
grow
international
potential
of
cloud
computing
.
a
recent
report
commission
by
Microsoft
have
estimate
that
,
by
2014
,
the
cloud
computing
industry
in
Ireland
could
be
worth
€
9.5
billion
and
employ
between
8500
and
9000
people
.
now
,
more
than
ever
,
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
seize
opportunity
like
this
.
this
job
will
be
create
automatically
,
and
the
government
must
act
decisively
and
urgently
if
we
be
to
position
Ireland
as
a
world
leader
in
this
high
-
growth
sector
.
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
on
cloud
computing
set
out
the
government
's
intention
in
this
important
area
of
the
ICT
industry
.
we
job
be
to
engage
with
the
centre
for
management
and
organisation
development
,
CMOD
.
the
government
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
this
.
one
could
say
work
be
ongoing
on
make
the
ICT
infrastructure
more
user
friendly
.
there
will
be
challenge
,
potentially
in
regard
to
industrial
relation
peace
,
but
I
believe
strongly
that
through
proper
engagement
with
all
the
stakeholder
across
government
and
by
take
a
more
horizontal
approach
as
oppose
to
the
more
siloed
approach
we
be
use
to
,
we
can
achieve
something
and
become
global
leader
in
adopt
early
new
technology
such
as
that
associate
with
cloud
computing
.
I
do
not
quite
get
the
last
point
.
I
be
not
aware
of
such
problem
.
I
say
that
openly
and
honestly
.
research
be
ongoing
and
the
centre
be
in
the
process
of
develop
a
cloud
computing
strategy
for
the
public
service
,
which
it
intend
to
bring
to
the
government
for
consideration
and
approval
in
the
first
quarter
of
2012
.
if
a
specific
issue
arise
,
I
would
love
to
hear
the
deputy
's
thought
.
I
fundamentally
disagree
with
the
deputy
.
if
he
be
willing
to
show
I
the
source
of
the
statistic
he
cite
,
I
will
revert
to
he
on
the
matter
.
EMC
,
the
Irish
Internet
Association
,
Facebook
,
IBM
,
Microsoft
,
Fujitsu
,
Dell
and
A&L
Goodbody
be
all
engage
in
this
process
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
process
because
if
we
can
become
global
leader
by
dint
of
be
early
adopter
we
will
have
a
competitive
advantage
.
I
recognise
that
problem
arise
in
broadband
provision
but
the
capacity
be
present
in
term
of
cloud
.
if
the
deputy
engage
further
with
the
Department
,
we
can
send
he
some
fact
on
the
issue
.
on
job
creation
,
this
Department
must
deal
with
the
reality
of
the
capital
funding
available
to
it
.
on
10
November
the
government
publish
its
infrastructural
and
capital
investment
medium
-
term
exchequer
framework
for
the
period
2012
to
2016
.
overall
,
capital
investment
total
€
17
billion
have
be
allocate
across
Department
.
in
one
way
or
another
,
all
of
this
€
17
billion
ultimately
have
a
focus
on
job
creation
.
the
government
's
role
be
to
create
the
condition
within
which
it
will
maximise
the
impact
of
this
capital
allocation
and
support
the
private
sector
in
the
creation
of
job
.
within
the
medium
-
term
framework
the
State
's
support
to
enterprise
and
innovation
have
be
protect
and
prioritise
and
clear
target
for
job
creation
have
be
set
.
when
average
over
the
lifetime
of
the
framework
,
the
job
creation
target
for
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
be
set
to
approximately
22659
per
annum
.
the
capital
allocation
for
programme
fund
by
the
Department
be
to
be
increase
in
2012
to
€
514
million
,
a
increase
of
€
6
million
on
the
2011
allocation
,
and
support
to
industry
will
be
maintain
in
excess
of
pre-recession
level
when
total
capital
expenditure
be
at
its
high
.
this
represent
a
strong
commitment
in
this
department
to
the
development
of
enterprise
and
provide
the
development
agency
with
sufficient
resource
to
target
aggressively
the
project
and
investment
that
will
drive
economic
renewal
.
in
set
out
this
level
of
capital
investment
in
the
productive
economy
the
government
have
be
cognisant
of
issue
,
include
maximise
the
achievement
of
value
for
money
and
the
sustainability
of
job
creation
measure
.
while
the
notion
of
spend
a
additional
€
3.1
billion
per
annum
on
job
creation
might
sound
attractive
,
what
the
economy
need
be
structural
change
.
the
government
must
ensure
the
enterprise
development
support
and
agency
be
fit
for
purpose
and
well
position
to
help
Ireland
to
move
out
of
the
current
downturn
by
create
sustainable
job
and
continue
to
grow
export
in
traditional
key
market
,
as
well
as
target
high
growth
market
such
as
the
BRIC
country
for
both
export
and
inward
investment
.
the
government
have
make
inroad
in
bring
about
this
change
,
as
well
as
restore
confidence
across
enterprise
,
investor
and
consumer
.
for
example
,
work
be
advance
within
the
Department
on
determine
the
extent
of
the
restructuring
of
the
county
enterprise
board
;
IDA
Ireland
have
restructure
in
order
that
more
of
its
staff
be
in
client
-
face
job
,
while
Enterprise
Ireland
have
make
operational
a
new
potential
exporter
division
which
will
target
company
with
export
potential
.
this
be
just
a
few
example
of
the
change
be
bring
about
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
which
be
make
in
good
faith
.
however
,
in
respect
of
the
government
's
capital
allocation
,
there
have
be
a
4
%
increase
in
Enterprise
Ireland
's
capital
budget
for
2012
.
I
will
rush
through
the
figure
because
I
be
conscious
of
the
time
constraint
,
but
there
have
be
a
10
%
increase
in
the
number
of
high
potential
start
-
up
company
,
a
20
%
increase
in
the
number
of
innovation
partnership
and
expenditure
of
€
18
million
on
the
innovation
fund
.
the
key
point
be
that
the
government
be
try
to
set
down
the
foundation
or
the
bedrock
on
which
one
can
sustain
job
over
a
long
period
.
if
one
consider
Sinn
Féin
's
proposal
for
capital
expenditure
,
they
entail
borrowing
something
like
€
1.7
billion
from
the
European
investment
Bank
.
it
be
talk
out
of
both
side
of
its
mouth
in
this
regard
—
there
be
a
bit
of
the
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
about
it
—
because
,
on
the
one
hand
,
it
state
it
would
not
pay
back
money
to
the
European
institution
from
which
Ireland
have
borrow
money
while
,
on
the
other
,
it
would
have
no
problem
in
borrowing
approximately
€
1.7
billion
from
the
European
investment
Bank
.
this
do
not
stack
up
.
the
government
be
try
to
create
long
-
term
sustainable
job
,
but
the
deputy
be
talk
about
short
-
term
project
base
on
capital
expenditure
.
this
do
not
stack
up
.
in
fairness
to
the
pensioner
who
be
outside
the
gate
of
Leinster
House
today
,
if
I
interpret
the
vox
pop
correctly
,
the
strong
message
also
extend
to
the
amount
of
money
be
take
in
administration
fee
.
I
respectfully
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
I
to
answer
the
question
.
the
pensioner
be
as
adamant
in
they
opposition
to
that
aspect
.
let
we
take
another
look
and
look
at
the
issue
from
the
perspective
of
the
communication
pass
between
Department
.
however
,
with
all
due
respect
,
as
the
question
tab
by
the
deputy
pertain
to
capital
expenditure
of
€
3.1
billion
,
he
will
forgive
I
if
I
do
not
have
a
exact
answer
for
he
on
the
issue
of
the
pension
fund
mention
.
the
Seventh
EU
Framework
Programme
for
Research
and
Development
(
FP7

,
with
a
budget
of
over
€
50

be
very
positive

like
many
in
the
international
community
,
the
government
have
be
closely
follow
event
in
Egypt
in
recent
day
in
the
run-up
to
historic
parliamentary
election
which
be
due
to
get
under
way
on
28
November
.
we
all
recall
the
event
last
February
in
Tahrir
Square
which
prove
so
inspiring
,
when
the
discredite
government
of
former
President
Hosni
Mubarak
be
sweep
away
in
a
impressive
demonstration
of
people
power
.
in
the
intervene
nine
month
,
Ireland
and
its
EU
partner
have
be
monitor
closely
the
transition
to
democratic
rule
in
Egypt
.
we
have
be
offer
all
possible
political
support
and
respond
positively
to
request
for
practical
assistance
.
it
be
recognise
that
,
as
in
other
country
undergo
democratic
transformation
in
the
region
,
the
uprising
in
Egypt
that
end
President
Mubarak
's
rule
be
a
genuinely
popular
one
,
draw
support
from
all
sector
of
society
,
and
that
it
be
for
Egypt
itself
to
determine
the
pace
of
its
own
transition
and
how
the
international
community
can
well
assist
.
it
need
to
be
recognise
that
profound
and
historic
change

the
former

have
be
publicly
put
on
trial
for

,
a
event
to
behold
for
ordinary
Egyptians
when
they
consider
how
impregnable
the
rule
of
President

appear
just
one
short
year
ago
.
despite
this
,
concern
have
be
grow
in
recent
month
at
the
overall
slow
pace
of
the
transition
in
Egypt
and
the
degree
of
real

and

.
despite

as
a
hard
hit
Amnesty

highlight
in

,
we
have
continue
to
see

,
as
well
as
many

also
of
considerable
concern
have
be
the
growth
in

this
have
its
most
recent
manifestation
last

,
when
more

20

the

undertake
to
investigate

fully
and
also
promise

to
address
well
found
coptic
grievance
.
as
with
other
aspect
of
the
change
agenda
in
Egypt
,
the
pace
of
reform
have
be
slow
and
hesitant
.
most
recently
,
the
prospect
of
military
rule
continue
until
well
into
2013
have
cause
renew
apprehension
among
many
ordinary
Egyptians
,
as
well
as
Egypt
's
international
partner
.
that
this
and
other
failure
to
realise
the
full
promise
of
change
have
give
way
to
renew
violence
and
death
be
regrettable
.
the

other
in
the

as

part
of
Egypt
that

life
.
the
need
for
restraint
,
a
avoidance
of
all
violence
and
renew
dialogue
on
all
side
be
obvious
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
excessive
force
have
be

by
the
Egyptian
police
and
security
force
in
respond
to
what
be
peaceful
demonstration
in
Tahrir

and
other
Egyptian
city
.
the
clear
impetus
behind
all
the
renew
violence
and
tension
of
recent
day
be
the
failure
to
respect
fully
the
democratic
aspiration
of
the

.

the
demand

out
the

a

also
likely
to

this

a
step
forward

if

they

therefore

if

they
will
look

I
wish
to

with
Deputy

Seán

,
Alex
White
,
Patrick
O'Donovan
,
Eamonn

Paschal

.
it
be
essential
that
European
leader
make
and
implement
clear
decision
quickly
to
prove
we
share
determination
to
protect
we
currency
,
support
member
state
that
be
work
towards
economic
recovery
,
and
introduce
strong
rule
to
ensure
fiscal
discipline
.
that
be
the
word
of
the
Taoiseach
.
a
philosophical
debate
need
to
take
place
within
this
House
about
the
nature
of
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
.
we
either
have
a
inter-governmental
model
or
a
inter-institutional
or
community
method
base
model
.
the
question
the
Opposition
must
ask
itself
if
it
propose
a
strong
inter-
governmental
model
,
be
if
it
will
be
base
on
one
country
with
one
vote
or
a
qualified
majority
vote
mechanism
.
notwithstanding
the
current
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
since
1972
Ireland
traditionally
have
always
do
much
well
through
a
community
method
.
it
be
through
strong
inter-institutional
link
,
a
strong
European
parliament
and
small
member
state
bind
together
that
we
can
act
as
a
contrary
force
to
the
weight
of
the
large
country
.
if
we
implement
a
raw
inter
-
governmental
model
,
the
"
Merkozy
"
effect
will
always
continue
to
hold
sway
.
we
must
have
a
qualitative
debate
about
what
membership
entail
,
and
this
must
be
base
not
just
on
short
-
term
political
gain
by
certain
party
in
the
House
but
in
a
proper
discussion
of
membership
.
I
do
not
see
how
a
position
can
be
reconcile
where
a
party
believe
a
referendum
must
be
put
on
membership
but
it
also
argue
that
the
power
of
the
ECB
should
be
extend
to
cover
more
than
its
remit
with
regard
to
inflation
.
the
premise
of
the
belief
be
that
the
referendum
would
be
support
as
it
would
expand
the
power
of
the
ECB
.
the
Sinn
Féin
Party
must
grapple
with
that
idea
.
nobody
should
come
to
the
House
to
talk
about
such
wide
issue
as
the
loss
of
economic
sovereignty
without
spell
out
in
detail
what
that
mean
.
there
be
a
bit
of
a
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
approach
from
Sinn
Féin
on
the
matter
,
and
its
position
be
fundamentally
contradictory
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Tom
Barry
and
Peter
Fitzpatrick
.
the
government
be
attempt
to
create
a
necessary
framework
that
seek
to
reform
and
evolve
the
social
protection
code
.
I
would
like
to
address
my
comment
to
the
budgetary
measure
introduce
.
if
I
stray
from
the
exact
content
of
the
social
Welfare
Bill
2011
,
I
do
so
because
I
want
to
comment
on
it
in
a
wide
context
.
we
must
consider
the
social
Welfare
Bill
2011
in
the
wide
budgetary
context
.
there
be
thousand
of
worker
who
be
not
in
receipt
of
any
type
of
social
protection
measure
.
there
be
,
therefore
,
a
strongly
hold
view
that
reform
of
the
social
protection
code
be
necessary
.
I
take
on
board
the
view
espouse
by
that
speaker
who
precede
I
.
we
must
have
due
regard
to
the
extraordinary
fiscal
pressure
we
be
under
in
term
of
the
deficit
reduction
target
to
which
we
be
align
.
to
be
fair
,
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Burton
,
have
genuinely
seek
to
address
the
disability
payment
issue
.
the
government
have
listen
to
what
have
be
say
by
all
side
of
the
House
on
that
matter
and
have
move
to
address
it
.
some
of
we
be
only
in
government
a
relatively
short
time
and
we
openly
acknowledge
that
there
be
issue
in
the
budget
which
need
to
be
address
.
we
acknowledge
the
statement
make
by
member
on
the
opposite
side
in
relation
to
that
matter
.
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
state
that
the
pressure
on
we

the

cut
welfare
rate
,
increase
income
tax
on
working
people
,
to
protect
carer
and
to
standardise
child

payment
.
the
social
protection
measure
in
this
Bill
signal
a
move
by
government
to
move
we
country
close
to
economic
recovery
and
towards
the
restoration
of
we
sovereignty
.
some
€
4.2
million
will
be
provide
for

in

,
SOLAS
will

the

will
spend
€977
million
on

support
in

,
up
from
€
882

it
be
in

that

be
be
examine
,
as
well
as

so
that

who
lose
they
job
do
not
drift
into
long
-
term
unemployment

this
be
commit
to
in
the
budget
.
the
need
to
shift
from
a
passive
welfare
system
to
a
far
more
active
approach
be
vital
.
I
be
sure
we
would
all
subscribe
to
that
philosophy
regardless
of
we
own
political
ideological
view
.
the
government
will
publish
pathway
to
work
,
which
will
outline
its
approach
to
deepening
the
labour
market
activation
policy
area
.
in
my
view
,
the
social
protection
budget
need
to
be
view
holistically
.
Capital

on
job
create
programme
will
be
increase
in

.
my
Department
and
its
agency
will
be
able
to
continue
current
level
of
spending
on
job
creation
,
to
increase
the
scope
for
some
crucial
programme
and
to
implement
some
new
measure
.
in
my
area
of
responsibility
,
research
and
innovation
,
there
be
a
allocation
of
€370
million
for
2012
,
although
that
be
a
slight
decrease
at
only
98
%
of
last

.
however
,
it
allow
we
to
continue

I
thank

issue

a
number
of
point
have
be
raise
in

of
the
contribution

I
thank

Deputy
for
raise
this
important
matter

I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
the
opportunity
to
respond

I
be
concerned
at
the
continue
situation
at
the
Vita
Cortex
factory
in
Cork
which
have
involve
worker
at
the
plant
engage
in
a
sit
-
in
since
16
December
last
arise
from
a
dispute
with
they
employer
over
redundancy
payment
.
the
worker
involve
in
the
Vita
Cortex
sit-in
be
seek
severance
term
of
2.9
week
per
year
of
service
,
inclusive
of
statutory
redundancy
,
in
line
with
previous
redundancy
deal
at
the
company
,
and
they
maintain
this
will
amount
to
a
total
of
€
1.2
million
.
we
know
that
the
worker
have
be
offer
a
paltry
sum
of
€
1500
to
leave
the
premise
over
the
Christmas
period
and
they
rightly
reject
this
offer
claim
that
the
company
would
use
they
absence
to
remove
important
machinery
and
stock
.
the
company
state
that
it
inform
worker
that
they
redundancy
would
have
to
come
from
the
State
's
social
insurance
fund
unless
NAMA
agree
to
release
€
2.5
million
hold
on
deposit
by
another
Vita
Cortex
firm
on
foot
of
a
allied
Irish
Banks
,
AIB
,
loan
take
over
by
NAMA
.
however
,
NAMA
issue
a
statement
that
this
fund
be
put
out
of
reach
of
the
Vita
Cortex
group
not
by
NAMA
but
by
AIB
two
and
a
half
year
ago
when
they
be
pledge
as
security
for
loan
.
while
NAMA
have
state
that
it
empathise
with
the
Vita
Cortex
worker
,
it
have
state
that
:
"
unfortunately
legally
it
cannot
simply
use
charge
deposit
fund
pledge
against
loan
of
one
company
to
meet
cost
incur
by
a
separate
legal
entity
"
.
NAMA
also
state
that
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
owner
and
shareholder
of
Vita
Cortex
to
resolve
this
situation
.
it
be
difficult
to
disagree
with
that
contention
.
in
the
interest
of
achieve
a
resolution
in
this
dispute
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
urge
both
party
to
avail
of
the
State
's
industrial
relation
machinery
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
view
to
explore
way
of
resolve
the
issue
in
dispute
.
official
from
my
Department
be
in
contact
with
the
worker
's
union
representative
over
the
holiday
period
,
in
a
effort
to
clarify
the
issue
involve
and
to
make
they
aware
that
the
industrial
relation
machinery
of
the
State
be
available
to
help
they
resolve
the
dispute
.
I
understand
that
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
have
today
invite
both
party
to
meet
in
Cork
next
Tuesday
to
clarify
the
fact
and
to
explore
with
the
party
the
potential
for
move
forward
.
I
welcome
the
initiative
by
the
LRC
and
urge
both
party
to
engage
constructively
in
the
process
.
engagement
with
the
State
's
industrial
relation
machinery
offer
the
good
way
at
this
stage
.
the
ultimate
aim
be
to
ensure
that
the
rights
of
worker
be
vindicate
.
we
all
have
that
interest
at
heart
.
the
second
aim
be
to
ensure
that
corporate
social
responsibility
be
adhere
to
and
that
there
be
some
degree
of
corporate
governance
.
I
agree
with
the
Deputy
on
the
perceive
Byzantine
structure
of
Vita
Cortex
.
we
must
also
remember
that
Vita
Cortex
be
a
recipient
of
State
funding
.
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
this
state
to
ensure
that
we
can
shine
a
light
on
that
company
in
some
way
.
if
there
be
a
mechanism
through
which
a
query
can
be
make
to
the
director
of
corporate
enforcement
about
the
company
structure
,
then
I
actively
encourage
people
to
use
it
.
it
be
impossible
to
say
at
this
stage
what
the
premise
of
the
discussion
will
be
.
the
LRC
extend
the
invitation
just
today
and
I
hope
that
both
party
will
agree
to
engage
in
that
process
.
we
should
see
where
we
can
go
from
there
.
other
point
be
raise
in
respect
of
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
meeting
with
both
side
and
with
company
management
.
I
will
take
back
that
point
to
the
minister
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
State
will
use
its
force
in
a
positive
sense
to
ensure
that
worker
's
rights
be
vindicate
.
we
be
not
go
to
rest
on
that
-----
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
deputy
Martin
about
the
legal
basis
of
NAMA
's
position
.
I
will
also
bring
that
to
the
minister
.
no
one
political
entity
in
the
House
have
a
monopoly
on
the
rights
of
worker
.
I
speak
with
regard
to
the
Vita
Cortex
case
,
in
which
there
be
a
serious
breach
of
corporate
social
responsibility
and
corporate
governance
,
and
the
same
apply
in
respect
of
this
case
.
there
be
no
question
but
that
the
rights
of
worker
have
not
be
vindicate
and
have
be
trample
upon
.
under
legislation
from
1977
to
2007
govern
the
protection
of
employee
,
a
number
of
provision
deal
with
a
information
and
consultation
process
that
must
be
enter
into
prior
to
any
redundancy
be
implement
and
the
provision
of
information
to
employee
and
to
the
minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
in
this
case
,
the
minister
have
not
receive
any
statutory
notice
of
such
redundancy
.
that
be
a
serious
breach
in
the
first
instance
.
there
be
a
need
for
my
Department
to
engage
with
Mr.
Meegan
and
other
of
Mandate
who
,
it
be
report
meet
KPMG
today
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
assessment
of
what
transpire
at
that
meeting
because
the
point
raise
on
this
and
the
previous
topical
issue
matter
go
to
the
heart
of
industrial
relation
policy
and
vindicate
the
rights
of
worker
.
as
a
government
,
we
must
ensure
there
be
no
precedent
set
and
the
legislation
be
adhere
to
by
corporate
entity
,
individual
and
citizen
.
there
be
no
question
that
we
support
the
rights
of
worker
as
set
down
in
legislation
and
will
seek
to
do
so
.
by
way
of
be
helpful
,
I
express
my
willingness
to
meet
worker
representative
on
this
issue
in
order
that
we
can
provide
some
degree
of
assistance
where
possible
.
I
be
keep
my
statement
brief
because
I
realise
member
will
wish
to
make
further
submission
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
and
I
be
not
one
to
pay
lip
service
to
issue
such
as
this
.
with
respect
,
I
have
indicate
that
I
want
to
meet
the
worker
's
representative
on
this
issue
.
I
be
concerned
,
as
deputy
McDonald
have
point
out
,
that
there
be
a
perceive
breach
of
legislation
.
there
be
a
perceive
breach
of
legislation
in
respect
of
section
9
and
10
of
the
Protection
of
employment
Act
1977
and
Regulation
6
of
the
European
Community
(
Protection
of
employment
)
regulation
whereby
employee
,
whose
employer
have
not
comply
with
section
9
and
10
of
the
Protection
of
employment
Act
1977
,
may
refer
complaint
to
a
rights
commissioner
.
there
be
issue
around
the
mandatory
notice
to
employer
.
please
allow
I
that
mode
of
communication
and
let
we
see
how
we
can
proceed
.
I
would
point
out
that
Ireland
have
a
strong
and
robust
regime
for
deal
with
copyright
infringement
whether
in
the
digital
environment
or
otherwise
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
provide
a
technology
-
neutral
exclusive
right
for
copyright
owner
to
communicate
they
work
through
any
mode
.
the
Act
also
contain
extensive
provision
deal
with
infringement
of
that
right
or
other
,
whether
civil
or
criminal
.
the
rights
holder
may
proceed
against
that
who
infringe
they
copyright
in
a
number
of
way
.
for
example
,
in
the
digital
environment
,
it
be
a
infringement
for
the
person
provide
facility
(
such
as
a
internet
service
provider
)
not
to
remove
infring
material
when
notify
by
the
rights
holder
.
another
remedy
allow
the
rights
holder
to
obtain
the
identity
of
allege
infringer
,
include
that
involve
in
illegal
file
-
share
,
from
a
internet
society
service
provider
by
means
of
judicial
process
.
this
can
then
be
pursue
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
infringer
.
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
copyright
act
provide
for
secondary
and
contributory
liability
.
in
relation
to
one
of
the
remedy
available
to
rights
holder
,
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
fully
comply
with
EU
law
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
a
legislative
instrument
be
be
finalise
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
exist
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
judgement
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental

of
individual
who

such

it
be

that
this
measure
will

to

the

I
never
think
deputy
Tóibín
would
patronise
in
that
way
.
achieve
savings
in
the
Department
's
budget
have
require
difficult
decision
.
despite
pressure
on
spending
,
the
government
have
shield
to
the
great
extent
possible
front
line
service
in
school
.
the
government
have
and
will
continue
to
prioritise
target
support
for
school
,
with
the
most
concentrate
level
of
educational
disadvantage
through
the
DEIS
programme
and
action
plan
.
more
than
€
158
million
be
currently
be
provide
by
way
of
additional
resource
and
support
for
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
,
include
DEIS
.
this
be
only
part
of
a
overall
amount
of
some
€
700
million
,
which
continue
to
be
provide
to
tackle
educational
disadvantage
across
the
full
education
spectrum
,
from
pre-school
to
further
and
high
education
.
this
include
scheme
such
as
the
school
completion
programme
and
disadvantage
youth
,
which
now
come
under
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
and
the
school
meal
programme
,
which
come
under
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
a
key
aspect
of
the
EU
-
IMF
programme
of
support
and
Ireland
's
overall
budgetary
strategy
be
a
requirement
to
reduce
the
public
sector
payroll
.
this
be
a
particular
challenge
for
the
education
sector
,
consider
that
a
third
of
all
public
sector
employee
work
there
.
furthermore
,
unlike
in
other
country
,
we
school
-
go
population
be
rise
rapidly
and
place
must
be
provide
for
the
extra
70000
pupil
arrive
in
we
school
in
the
next
six
year
.
provide
for
increase
enrolment
be
a
key
priority
but
make
some
adjustment
to
teacher
number
be
unavoidable
,
give
budgetary
constraint
.
the
net
impact
on
overall
teacher
number
in
we
school
have
be
minimise
to
the
great
extent
possible
.
we
be
conscious
of
the
concern
of
some
school
which
will
be
adversely
affect
by
the
withdrawal
of
post
under
previous
disadvantaged
scheme
,
and
with
this
concern
in
mind
we
have
make
clear
since
the
budget
announcement
that
this
matter
would
be
manage
as
sensitively
as
possible
.
to
this
end
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
meet
school
principal
,
teacher
,
parent
and
community
representative
in
recent
week
to
hear
they
concern
and
clarify
the
position
of
announce
change
in
the
2012
budget
to
post
allocate
to
school
under
previous
scheme
to
tackle
educational
disadvantage
.
the
minister
have
hold
many
meeting
with
member
of
my
parliamentary
party
and
all
government
colleague
,
who
have
perform
a
invaluable
service
in
assist
he
in
develop
a
understanding
of
the
impact
of
the
propose
measure
in
this
school
.
it
be
in
this
context
that
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
have
be
direct
to
report
to
the
minister
within
the
next
four
week
on
the
position
of
DEIS
band
one
and
band
two
school
which
currently
have
post
under
scheme
predate
DEIS
.
that
will
do
in
the
context
of
staff
allocation
due
to
issue
to
all
school
in
the
come
week
.
we
look
forward
to
receive
that
report
and
continue
the
process
of
engagement
with
school
on
the
impact
of
the
measure
announce
in
the
2012
budget
.
it
be
for
job
creation
.
the
deputy

about
the
use
of
language
,
but
she

around
with
it
herself
.
I
move

be
the
deputy
be
ironic
,
talk
about
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
?
it
be
scandalous
to
be
lecture
like
that
.
official
in
my

be
currently
make
the
necessary
arrangement
with
a
view

launch

round
of

Sports
Capital
Programme
early
this
year
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
consider
and
valuable
contribution
to
the
debate
.
I
will
start
by
provide
clarification
on
last
point
make
,
on
the
assumption
that
the
deputy
may
be
leave
the
Chamber
.
student
can
study
Russian
on
the
leave
certificate
curriculum
.
there
be
a
number
of
Confucius
institute
throughout
the
State
where
Chinese
language
may
be
learn
,
as
well
as
at
University
College
Cork
and
quite
a
number
of
secondary
school
.
as
to
Portuguese
,
I
may
revert
to
the
deputy
on
that
one
.
I
note
the
point
he
be
make
;
we
be
conscious
of
that
.
in
he
introductory
speech
,
the
minister
set
out
the
rationale
for
the
propose
Protection
of
employee
(
temporary
Agency
work
)
Bill
2011
,
which
be
necessary
to
meet
we
obligation
to
transpose
the
EU
directive
on
temporary
and
agency
worker
.
in
the
contribution
by
deputy
on
the
Bill
,
it
have
be
evident
that
there
be
,
in
general
,
a
overall
welcome
for
the
Bill
in
this
House
,
with
most
deputy
express
they
support
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
be
a
fair
and
balance
measure
to
improve
the
level
of
protection
for
agency
worker
under
employment
law
.
while
deputy
have
indicate
broad
support
for
the
thrust
of
the
Bill
,
I
note
the
intention
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
deputy
to
table
amendment
on
committee
stage
in
order
to
achieve
great
clarity
in
some
aspect
of
the
Bill
.
in
several
intervention
on
the
Bill
,
there
have
be
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
need
for
balance
in
the
manner
in
which
the
EU
directive
be
transpose
,
so
that
the
necessary
protection
for
agency
worker
do
not
act
as
a
deterrent
to
we
ability
to
sustain
exist
job
and
increase
employment
.
give
the
current
challenge
that
face
the
government
in
the
domestic
labour
market
and
the
economy
generally
,
the
Bill
have
be
draft
with
a
view
to
achieve
this
necessary
balance
.
it
provide
that
agency
worker
be
afford
equal
treatment
,
in
respect
of
they
basic
working
and
employment
condition
,
with
directly
recruit
employee
who
occupy
the
same
job
.
this
mark
a
further
important
step
forward
in
worker
's
rights
and
build
on
the
already
considerable
baseline
of
rights
afford
to
agency
worker
in
this
country
who
be
protect
under
the
exist
suite
of
employment
legislation
.
the
government
be
fully
commit
to
decent
standard
of
employment
across
the
spectrum
of
work
.
it
be
clear
that
agency
worker
have
,
on
a
incremental
basis
,
be
bring
within
the
scope
of
employment
rights
legislation
over
many
year
,
include
legislation
on
the
payment
of
wage
and
unfair
dismissal
.
in
addition
,
agency
worker
in
Ireland
,
unlike
in
some
other
jurisdiction
,
also
enjoy
entitlement
under
redundancy
payment
legislation
.
in
term
of
minimum
standard
of
pay
,
temporary
agency
worker
be
already
cover
in
legislation
govern
the
national
minimum
wage
;
as
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
government
have
,
true
to
the
commitment
give
in
the
pre-election
period
last
year
,
reverse
the
reduction
in
the
minimum
wage
rate
.
this
Bill
therefore
build
on
exist
standard
of
protection
that
be
confer
on
agency
worker
and
reflect
the
government
's
willingness
to
fully
support
the
principle
of
fair
treatment
for
agency
worker
.
the
government
must
have
regard
to
other
equally
valid
concern
that
have
be
express
about
the
need
to
create
a
positive
environment
for
business
to
grow
and
develop
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
importance
of
agency
worker
in
the
multinational
sector
as
well
as
in
the
domestic
economy
.
a
fully
function
labour
market
that
contribute
to
the
retention
of
job
,
and
indeed
future
growth
,
be
important
in
this
challenging
time
.
we
must
maintain
labour
market
flexibility
in
all
area
,
include
the
area
of
agency
work
,
which
provide
flexibility
for
worker
and
employer
alike
.
deputy
raise
a
number
of
issue
during
the
course
of
the
debate
.
with
regard
to
the
failure
of
the
national
social
partner
to
reach
agreement
on
a
qualifying
period
before
equal
treatment
would
apply
,
this
be
,
as
the
minister
outline
in
he
introductory
speech
on
the
Bill
,
a
matter
of
regret
,
as
it
would
at
least
mean
that
recruitment
agency
that
operate
both
north
and
south
of
the
Border
would
be
operate
under
similar
arrangement
in
both
jurisdiction
to
allow
a
all
-
of
-
Ireland
approach
.
while
there
be
still
time
for
the
national
social
partner
to
negotiate
agreement
on
this
issue
should
the
basis
for
such
a
agreement
become
apparent
before
the
deliberation
of
the
Oireachtas
on
this
Bill
be
complete
and
the
Bill
be
enact
,
the
basis
for
such
agreement
be
not
currently
in
evidence
and
,
as
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
Legislature
cannot
unilaterally
provide
for
this
derogation
.
the
legislation
be
,
with
the
exception
of
the
offence
provision
,
be
make
retrospective
to
5
December
2011
-
that
be
,
the
date
of
transposition
of
the
directive
.
this
be
because
the
State
be
obligate
by
virtue
of
its
EU
commitment
under
the
treaty
to
have
the
transposing
measure
in
place
as
and
from
the
transposition
date
,
and
the
advice
available
to
the
government
indicate
that
this
course
of
action
be
require
.
I
appreciate
the
difficulty
associate
with
retrospective
application
,
and
that
be
why
,
in
the
interest
of
provide
the
great
possible
level
of
clarity
to
all
party
affect
by
this
legislation
,
my
Department
move
quickly
,
follow
the
breakdown
of
negotiation
on
the
qualifying
period
with
the
national
social
partner
on
30
November
2011
,
to
communicate
with
the
various
stakeholder
.
advertisement
be
take
out
in
the
national
newspaper
and
the
Department
produce
a
guidance
document
and
place
it
on
its
website
to
cover
the
issue
of
great
interest
to
all
party
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
importance
of
agency
work
in
the
multinational
and
domestic
sector
and
point
out
that
,
contrary
to
common
perception
,
agency
worker
be
in
some
instance
very
well
remunerate
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
directive
and
this
Bill
aim
to
provide
a
new
minimum
floor
of
basic
entitlement
and
pay
.
for
this
reason
,
there
be
no
intention
to
include
other
element
that
be
not
require
by
the
directive
,
such
as
pension
,
sick
pay
,
maternity
top
-
up
and
benefit
-
in
-
kind
.
the
latter
be
discretionary
element
that
be
not
,
in
the
word
of
the
directive
,
binding
and
generally
applicable
.
give
the
current
economic
circumstance
,
now
be
not
the
time
to
try
to
provide
gilt
-
edged
condition
of
employment
when
the
creation
of
employment
on
a
fair
and
equitable
basis
be
what
be
require
.
under
this
Bill
,
agency
worker
be
entitle
to
be
treat
,
in
they
basic
working
and
employment
condition
,
include
pay
,
as
if
they
be
directly
recruit
by
the
hiring
organisation
to
occupy
the
same
job
.
I
be
conscious
that
a
number
of
intervention
have
focus
on
the
need
for
a
comparator
in
this
situation
,
and
have
refer
to
the
test
under
section
2
of
the
Bill
in
which
any
such
comparable
employee
might
be
identify
.
I
be
conscious
that
the
Bill
need
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
to
ensure
delivery
of
the
fundamental
principle
enshrine
in
article
5.1
of
the
directive
.
in
this
regard
,
it
be
not
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
and
the
entitlement
of
agency
worker
to
equal
treatment
to
have
a
real
-
what
might
be
term
flesh
-
and
-
blood
-
comparator
;
section
6
of
the
Bill
provide
for
this
.
of
course
,
where
there
be
such
a
comparator
,
that
make
it
easy
to
establish
that
equal
treatment
apply
,
and
this
be
provide
for
in
section
6
(
1
)
(
a
)
of
the
Bill
.
where
there
be
no
such
comparator
,
section
6
(
2
)
(
b
)
effectively
place
the
onus
of
responsibility
on
the
hirer
to
notify
the
employment
agency
of
the
relevant
term
and
condition
,
include
pay
rate
,
that
would
apply
if
a
comparable
employee
be
to
be
hire
by
the
hirer
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
outworking
of
the
legislation
give
rise
to
intricate
and
complex
issue
at
a
operational
level
.
for
this
reason
,
they
consider
that
the
Bill
would
benefit
from
further
clarification
in
some
instance
.
in
legislation
of
this
nature
,
which
be
design
to
embrace
the
main
principle
and
policy
at
issue
,
it
be
difficult
to
encompass
all
of
the
outworking
of
the
legislation
that
follow
on
from
the
Bill
.
while
I
agree
that
the
Bill
will
need
to
be
perfect
in
certain
aspect
to
provide
some
necessary
clarification
-
in
that
context
,
it
be
intend
to
table
some
amendment
on
committee
stage
-
many
of
the
issue
raise
by
deputy
will
be
clarify
by
the
development
of
further
guidance
.
it
have
be
the
practice
of
the
Department
in
introduce
new
employment
legislation
to
prepare
a
guidance
publication
that
be
well
gear
to
deal
in
great
depth
with
the
detail
require
,
and
that
be
also
the
intention
in
this
instance
.
finally
,
there
be
some
discussion
about
section
7
of
the
Bill
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
,
in
particular
,
have
concern
about
this
section
in
case
it
be
intend
as
some
type
of
escape
hatch
from
the
provision
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
important
to
clarify
that
this
be
not
the
intention
behind
section
7
,
which
be
a
provision
that
be
welcome
by
all
stakeholder
in
that
it
will
recognise
exist
collective
arrangement
in
place
such
as
under
register
employment
agreement
in
some
sector
.
it
will
also
allow
for
the
conclusion
,
in
the
future
,
of
collective
arrangement
at
workplace
or
sectoral
level
and
provide
a
mechanism
for
the
registration
,
subject
to
approval
,
of
this
agreement
by
the
Labour
Court
.
this
type
of
flexibility
in
the
labour
market
be
very
much
welcome
by
all
party
that
have
a
interest
in
this
legislation
.
as
I
mention
early
,
it
be
intend
to
bring
forward
a
number
of
amendment
on
committee
stage
with
a
view
to
clarify
certain
aspect
that
have
be
already
mention
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
consider
intervention
on
this
important
Bill
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
sub
-
committee
on
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
innovation
pursuant
to
Standing
Order
82a
(

)
(
a
)
(
6
)
(
a
)
.
in
the
context
of
overall
necessary
difficult
expenditure
reduction
measure
announce
in
budget
2012
,
new
student
enter
postgraduate
course
from
the
2012
-
2013
academic
year
onwards
will
not
be
entitle
to
any
maintenance
payment
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
however
,
that
student
who
meet
the
qualifying
condition
for
the
special
rate
of
grant
will
be
eligible
to
have
they
postgraduate
tuition
fee
pay
up
to
the
maximum
fee
limit
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
in
addition
,
a
further
limited
number
of
student
who
would
previously
have
qualify
under
the
standard
grant
threshold
will
qualify
to
have
a
€
2000
contribution
make
towards
the
cost
of
they
fee
.
however
,
there
will
be
a
new
income
threshold
for
this
payment
which
will
be
low
than
the
standard
grant
threshold
.
the
income
threshold
for
this
level
of
grant
be
be
determine
in
the
context
of
the
formulation
of
the
student
grant
scheme
for
the
2012
-
13
academic
year
.
the
answer
to
the
second
question
be
9,435
.
regard
the
first
question
,
I
do
not
have
a
specific
date
but
the
review
be
ongoing
.
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
supply
by
the
66
grant
awarding
authority
show
that
9,435
postgraduate
student
be
in
receipt
of
a
student
grant
.
the
distinction
between
the
two
be
not
specify
but
I
can
come
back
to
deputy
Smith
on
that
point
.
in
a
full
year
,
2000
student
on
the
low
income
will
meet
the
qualifying
condition
for
the
special
rate
of
grant
and
will
have
they
fee
pay
up
to
the
maximum
fee
limit
allowable
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
another
4000
student
will
receive
a
fee
contribution
of
€
2000
.
the
new
arrangement
will
apply
to
two
third
of
the
postgraduate
cohort
on
the
low
income
,
which
be
arguably
a
wide
cohort
of
student
.
it
be
like
try
to
measure
how
long
be
a
piece
of
string
.
we
cannot
predict
the
impact
of
this
in
term
of
exact
number
and
participation
rate
.
participation
rate
at
third
level
be
determine
by
a
myriad
of
factor
and
income
be
not
the
only
criterion
.
Parental
aspect
,
social
and
cultural
factor
,
the
level
of
pre-exist
educational
attainment
,
whether
someone
be
in
employment
,
whether
someone
have
lose
a
job
and
a
certain
amount
of
income
be
other
factor
.
one
can
safely
assume
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
but
we
do
not
know
for
certain
and
there
be
no
way
of
measure
its
impact
.
it
be
part
of
a
package
of
measure
the
Department
and
the
government
have
to
take
in
reduce
spending
.
we
be
honest
about
that
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
the
student
assistance
fund
,
at
the
behest
of
individual
institution
,
be
retain
and
that
tax
relief
for
postgraduate
student
be
retain
.
arise
from
this
budgetary
adjustment
,
the
people
who
be
least
affect
be
the
people
who
will
be
give
the
great
chance
to
go
to
postgraduate
education
,
namely
,
that
who
be
on
the
low
income
threshold
.
we
have
try
to
protect
and
preserve
that
.
that
be
a
very
subjective
statement
.
there
be
no
way
of
predict
the
number
of
people
who
will
apply
for
postgraduate
course
,
except
to
say
that
it
be
increase
year
on
year
.
ironically
,
this
increase
be
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
economic
sovereignty
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Smith
in
respect
of
interaction
with
industry
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
will
be
publish
and
its
purpose
be
to
derive
great
economic
benefit
from
the
research
we
be
carry
out
.
there
be
a
deepening
collaboration
between
industry
and
academia
in
term
of
research
.
I
be
talk
to
global
company
that
provide
thousand
of
job
in
this
country
and
I
be
talk
to
indigenous
firm
that
want
to
move
into
the
space
of
take
on
board
more
graduate
.
Labour
market
activation
measure
,
which
will
be
launch
shortly
,
will
also
attest
to
this
.
in
term
of
the
finite
number
,
we
must
know
the
number
of
people
who
will
apply
for
funding
before
we
know
the
endgame
in
term
of
the
amount
allocate
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
level
of
a
person
's
economic
resource
have
a
impact
on
the
level
of
educational
attainment
.
we
be
seek
to
ensure
we
can
fund
that
with
the
low
income
.
a
number
of
postgraduate
research
base
course
be
fund
by
industry
or
through
call
.
we
must
also
bear
this
in
mind
.
I
be
pleased
to
note
that
the
National
Competitiveness
Council
endorse
the
approach
outline
in
literacy
and
Numeracy
for
learning
and
Life
which
I
launch
in
July
2011
.

I
would
point
out
that
Ireland
have
a
strong
and
robust
regime
for
deal
with
copyright
infringement
whether
in
the
digital
environment
or
otherwise
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
provide
a
technology
-
neutral
exclusive
right
for
copyright
owner
to
communicate
they
work
through
any
mode
.
the
Act
also
contain
extensive
provision
deal
with
infringement
of
that
right
or
other
,
whether
civil
or
criminal
.
the
rights
holder
may
proceed
against
that
who
infringe
they
copyright
in
a
number
of
way
.
for
example
,
in
the
digital
environment
,
it
be
a
infringement
for
the
person
provide
facility
(
such
as
a
internet
service
provider
)
not
to
remove
infring
material
when
notify
by
the
rights
holder
.
another
remedy
allow
the
rights
holder
to
obtain
the
identity
of
allege
infringer
,
include
that
involve
in
illegal
file
-
share
,
from
a
internet
service
provider
by
means
of
judicial
process
.
this
can
then
be
pursue
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
infringer
.
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
copyright
act
provide
for
secondary
and
contributory
liability
.
in
relation
to
one
of
the
remedy
available
to
rights
holder
,
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
fully
comply
with
EU
law
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
a
legislative
instrument
be
be
finalise
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
exist
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
judgement
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
Internet
Service
Provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
and
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
.
it
be
expect
that
this
measure
will
be
introduce
this
month
.
the
minister
do
not
have
information
in
relation
to
the
cost
of
copyright
infringement
in
the
area
of
digital
piracy
.
independent
research
as
to
the
effect
of
illegal
downloading
be
limit
therefore
the
cost
of
such
activity
be
not
readily
quantifiable
.
however
,
in
the
judgement
of
Mr
Justice
Charleton
in
EMI
&
other
versus
UPC
(
2009
no.
s472
p
)
it
be
note
that
Mr
Dick
Doyle
of
the
Irish
record
Music
Association
posit
a
cost
of
€
20
m
per
annum
in
relation
to
music
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue

to

,
inclusive
,
together
.
I
be
actively
pursue
the
rationalisation
programme
set
out
in
the
Public
Service
Reform
Plan
with
the
relevant
agency
.
development
so
far
in
relation
to
agency
for
which
I
have
responsibility
be
that
Dundalk
Port
Company
merge
with
Dublin
Port
Company
on
12
July
2011
.
Tralee
and
Fenit
Harbour
Authority
transfer
to
the
control
of
Kerry
County
Council
with
effect
from

.
Baltimore
and
Skibbereen
Harbour
and
Kinsale
Harbour
transfer
to
the
control
of
Cork
County
Council
,
and
Arklow
Harbour
transfer
to
the
control
of
Wicklow
County
Council
,
with
effect
from
1
January
2012
.
I
also
recently
announce
that
Dublin
Tourism
be
be
merge
with
its
parent
body
—
Failte
Ireland
—
as
part
of
the
rationalisation
programme
.
furthermore
,
there
be
a
review
be
undertake
with
regard
to
the
future
tourism
role
of
Shannon
Development
and
its
possible
integration
into
Fáilte
Ireland
,
while
coach
Ireland
have
be
subsume
into
the
Irish
Sports
Council
.
on
the
issue
of
possible
further
rationalisation
,
the
Public
Service
Reform
Plan
require
that
a
number
of
other
agency
be
subject
to
critical
review
which
will
be
complete
by
June
of
this
year
.
in
addition
,
a
port
policy
review
be
at
a
advanced
stage
and
I
hope
to
publish
a
revise
policy
document
in
the
come
month
.
Port
company
restructuring
be
one
of
the
issue
be
consider
as
part
of
the
policy
review
.
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
the
potential
savings
from
rationalisation
until
full
detail
of
each
implementation
have
be
work
through
with
the
agency
in
question
.
there
be
no
proposal
to
introduce
a
government
guarantee
export
credit
insurance
scheme
for
Irish
exporter
to
this
country
.
the
government
's
position
on
this
issue
have
be
inform
by
the
finding
of
the
2009
report
commission
by
my
Department
from
KPMG
consultant
.
that
report
establish
that
the
introduction
of
such
a
scheme
would
be
expensive
,
with
significant
ongoing
cost
arise
for
the

in

of

a

be
about

and
this
cost
would
rise
significantly
if

in

,
it
be
find
that
such

and
that
a
negligible
number
of

be
connect
with

under

state

rule
,
any
such
state
scheme
be
not
normally
permissible
for
short

.
most
Irish
export
fall
into
this
category
.
a
temporary
derogation
be

in
2009
due
to
the
financial
crisis
at
that
time
.
that
be
now
under
review
and
be
very
unlikely
to

maintain
.
even
under

current

,
the
specific
provision
of
any

must
be
approve
by
the

would
include
a

that
the

should
be
high
than

provide
in

this
be
a
considerable
deterrent
to

,
and
some
of

have
poor
uptake
for

reason
.
in

have
recover

and
the

have
recover
significantly
,
with
both
new

and

.
this
have
greatly
improve
the
availability
of
export

on

the

the

give

of

the

,
both

additional

not

floor
of
the

.
while
the
background
research
and
analytical
element
of
the
KPMG
report
cannot
therefore
be
release
,
the
key
overall
finding
be
publicise
at
the
time
and
support
the
view
that
a
State
support
scheme
of
short
-
term
export
credit
insurance
should
not
be
introduce
.
this
remain
the
position
but
will
be
keep
under
ongoing
review
,
include
in
light
of
advice
and
evidence
from
the
appropriate
agency
and
business
representative
group
.
as
the
government
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
efficient
use
of
scarce
resource
,
a
commitment
of
large
-
scale
funding
to
a
initiative
with
marginal
benefit
for
Irish
industry
and
high
level
risk
to
the
State
would
be
unwise
.
I
appreciate
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
.
the
strict
confidentiality
clause
,
which
be
one
of
the
condition
that
apply
when
people
give
information
during
the
compilation
of
that
report
,
should
be
respect
.
we
can
provide
the
deputy
with
the
information
that
be
available
from
Enterprise
Ireland
about
export
figure
and
the
opportunity
that
be
arise
in
the
BRIC
country
.
the
deputy
also
ask
about
investment
in
job
and
the
opportunity
that
will
arise
after
February
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
ongoing
at
government
level
to
compile
the
new
action
plan
for
job
.
more
lateral
theme
be
be
explore
as
we
do
that
.
I
hope
the
deputy
will
take
in
good
faith
my
assurance
that
we
be
try
to
explore
and
mine
as
many
opportunity
as
we
can
.
I
say
that
in
response
to
the
point
she
make
about
job
creation
.
if
I
understand
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
correctly
,
she
say
we
should
avail
of
the
intellectual
capacity
of
people
who
will
find
themselves
in
a
new
situation
after
February
of
this
year
.
the
State
need
to
provide
opportunity
to
such
people
,
or
engage
with
they
at
least
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
the
private
investment
decision
of
a
individual
be
matter
for
the
individual
in
question
.
I
take
the
point
that
be
make
about
find
a
vehicle
for
a
lump
-
sum
investment
.
I
respectfully
suggest
the
deputy
should
engage
with
the
minister
for
Finance
with
a
view
to
explore
possibility
in
that
area
.

I
will
begin
by
confirm
that
this
be
absolutely
not
a
version
of
the
SOPA
legislation
.
it
be
a
restatement
of
a
position
on
copyright
that
the
government
have
hold
to
be
the
case
.
the
Charleton
judgment
in
the
case
of
EMI
v.
UPC
hold
that
Ireland
be
not
ad
idem
with
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
we
be
implement
a
statutory
instrument
to
give
voice
to
that
judgment
and
bring
we
into
line
with
the
directive
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
be
implement
in
the
State
.
every
member
state
of
the
European
Union
have
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
,
in
line
with
EU
legislation
,
in
the
event
of
a
perceive
infringement
of
the
copyright
of
a
party
.
prior
to
the
Charleton
judgment
,
to
which
we
be
not
a
party
,
we
position
be
that
we
be
in
line
with
EU
legislation
.
I
do
not
have
one
.
when
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
issue
he
judgment
,
we
consider
it
be
good
to
remove
any
doubt
by
restate
we
position
,
as
set
out
in
the
2000
Act
.
that
be
what
be
before
we
today
-
a
amendment
to
the
act
to
ensure
we
be
in
line
with
the
judgment
.
every
member
state
have
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
in
the
event
of
a
perceive
breach
of
copyright
.
before
a
judge
make
a
decision
he
or
she
will
need
to
have
regard
to
the
e-commerce
directive
which
state
there
be
inherent
rights
in
the
EU
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
to
freedom
of
expression
and
that
the
copyright
directive
provide
that
a
internet
service
-
provider
have
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
and
to
have
regard
to
the
right
of
ordinary
user
to
be
able
to
use
the
Internet
freely
and
openly
.
we
would
not
seek
to
prejudice
this
right
in
any
way
.
I
be
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
the
State
fund
new
technology
,
the
development
of
web
-
base
technology
to
the
tune
of
million
of
euro
annually
and
we
very
conscious
of
the
need
to
continue
to
do
so
.
I
take
deputy
Murphy
's
point
about
the
abdication
of
responsibility
.
however
,
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
deputy
that
we
need
to
see
a
dialogue
,
a
engagement
,
between
the
internet
service
-
provider
on
one
hand
,
the
copyright
holder
on
the
other
side
and
a
space
in
between
for
a
very
highly
active
Internet
web
-
base
community
.
they
all
need
to
sit
down
together
to
chart
a
way
forward
.
personally
,
I
be
not
averse
to
the
notion
of
primary
legislation
but
no
matter
what
action
be
decide
upon
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
Charlton
judgment
.
if
,
prior
to
this
judgment
,
the
State
already
hold
that
a
person
could
seek
infringement
proceedings
where
a
breach
of
copyright
be
perceive
and
there
have
be
no
site
close
down
as
a
result
,
we
be
merely
restate
what
be
in
the
copyright
Act
or
add
to
it
,
then
it
be
logical
to
assume
there
will
not
be
a
move
to
close
down
further
website
.
I
apologise
.
this
be
a
issue
which
warrant
more
time
but
I
will
speak
again
if
I
may
.
that
be
not
what
I
say
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
no
national
authority
or
court
can
require
a
internet
service
-
provider
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
of
the
information
it
transmit
on
its
network
.
that
give
rights
to
the
Internet
service
-
provider
and
to
the
individual
ip
address
or
the
individual
user
.
this
mean
the
isp
cannot
be
ask
to
monitor
all
the
datum
of
each
of
its
customer
in
order
to
prevent
any
future
infringement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
this
be
clearly
state
in
EU
law
.
we
be
attempt
to
balance
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
and
to
transpose
that
which
be
already
in
EU
law
and
then
to
recognise
the
rights
of
the
individual
user
,
the
individual
business
and
not
to
limit
the
freedom
of
the
Internet
.
nobody
want
to
limit
the
freedom
of
the
Internet
because
this
be
counter
-
intuitive
.
we
live
in
a
democracy
and
we
thrive
on
the
business
we
have
create
in
this
country
,
through
state
intervention
and
subsidy
which
support
that
type
of
business
.
the
business
model
pertain
to
the
music
industry
be
increasingly
and
arguably
-
I
will
not
use
the
word
outmoded
-
a
evolve
process
.
so
long
as
it
be
a
case
of
never
the
twain
shall
meet
,
then
no
matter
how
one
legislate
primarily
in
this
field
,
as
soon
as
one
legislate
,
the
Internet
,
of
its
very
nature
,
will
evolve
in
a
way
to
circumnavigate
the
legislation
.
in
my
view
,
the
stakeholder
must
sit
down
together
in
a
organic
fashion
because
if
they
do
not
reach
a
agreement
then
no
matter
what
government
be
in
power
,
it
will
never
be
able
to
legislate
for
this
issue
.
give
the
level
of
activity
on
the
Internet
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
,
and
the
level
of
innovation
,
no
one
member
state
,
no
one
geographical
boundary
,
can
set
law
to
try
to
control
it
.
this
be
a
commonly
-
hold
view
to
a
certain
extent
.
I
think
a
liberal
view
be
take
,
in
the
main
,
regard
the
power
of
the
Internet
and
its
inherent
good
.
however
,
as
a
EU
member
state
,
Ireland
must
have
regard
to
copyright
law
.
anyone
who
generate
intellectual
property
have
a
right
but
that
right
be
not
superior
to
the
right
of
the
Internet
service
-
provider
nor
superior
to
the
right
of
the
individual
user
.
when
government
legislate
,
they
must
be
very
careful
.
I
assure
deputy
that
I
will
give
this
matter
more
study
.
we
will
be
implement
the
statutory
instrument
,
I
will
be
very
straight
about
that
-----
it
be
imminent
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
exact
time
but
a
note
will
be
prepare
for
cabinet
.
I
will
have
to
defer
to
the
Chief
Whip
's
office
in
that
regard
.
the
central
point
be
that
that
people
within
that
community
need
to
start
come
together
.
the
isp
and
the
music
industry
people
need
to
sit
down
with
each
other
.
they
have
be
tinker
around
the
edge
of
this
issue
for
a
long
time
.
Ireland
need
to
take
a
strategic
view
as
to
how
it
pitch
itself
-----
-----in
term
of
legislation
.

let
I
start
by
repeat
that
I
fully
subscribe
to
the
freedom
,
the
opportunity
and
the
access
to
information
that
the
Internet
provide
we
with
.
Ireland
be
home
to
some
of
the
world
's
most
innovative
Internet
company
and
we
be
determined
to
grow
we
reputation
as
a
location
where
smart
people
and
this
smart
company
can
continue
to
innovate
in
this
fast
moving
arena
.
the
last
thing
innovator
need
be
a
culture
where
the
output
of
they
creative
endeavour
have
to
be
lock
away
or
keep
secret
for
the
fear
of
theft
.
Ireland
be
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
modern
suite
of
intellectual
property
law
that
by
they
very
nature
balance
a
range
of
compete
interest
and
rights
in
a
manner
that
be
see
right
across
the
globe
as
reasonable
and
proportionate
.
I
intend
that
this
will
continue
.
in
regard
to
the
propose
statutory
instrument
,
it
may
be
useful
to
explain
the
background
against
which
the
requirement
for
a
amendment
to
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
have
arise
.
in
the
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
high
Court
judgment
of
11
October
2010
,
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
decide
that
he
be
constrain
by
the
wording
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
and
thus
could
not
grant
a
injunction
to
prevent
infringement
of
copyright
against
a
information
service
provider
,
isp
,
in
the
circumstance
of
''
mere
conduit
''
transient
communication
.
in
do
so
,
he
state
that
Ireland
have
not
fully
transpose
the
relevant
EU
directive
.
the
"
mere
conduit
"
principle
provide
that
if
a
isp
do
not
initiate
a
transmission
,
or
modify
the
material
contain
in
a
transmission
and
do
not
select
the
receiver
of
the
transmission
,
it
be
grant
a
"
safe
harbour
"
against
liability
by
virtue
of
the
e-commerce
directive
2000
/
31
/
ec
.
however
,
accord
to
the
same
directive
,
this
freedom
from
liability
do
not
affect
the
power
of
the
court
to
require
service
provider
to
terminate
or
prevent
copyright
infringement
.
I
point
out
that
two
EU
directive
,
namely
,
the
copyright
directive
2001
and
the
enforcement
directive
2004
require
that
the
holder
of
copyright
-
author
,
music
composer
,
lyricist
,
record
producer
,
etc.
-
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
what
be
a
intermediary
?
in
a
nutshell
,
a
intermediary
be
a
isp
which
provide
mere
conduit
,
caching
or
host
service
on
the
Internet
.
my
Department
have
consider
that
injunction
be
available
under
section
40
(
4
)
of
the
copyright
Act
and
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
grant
injunction
,
which
be
equitable
and
discretionary
remedy
,
grant
accord
to
settle
principle
,
develop
by
the
court
.
however
,
this
be
not
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
's
view
.
in
regard
to
the
legal
advice
,
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
be
ask
by
my
Department
and
that
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
for
its
advice
as
to
the
implication
of
the
high
court
judgment
.
the
office
have
advise
that
the
obligation
contain
in
the
directive
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
rightholder
must
have
a
mechanism
available
to
they
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
where
they
intellectual
property
rights
be
be
breach
.
separately
the
office
advise
that
the
prudent
course
be
to
introduce
a
regulation
to
ensure
compliance
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
very
sensitive
issue
.
we
seek
to
strike
a
balance
between
creator
and
user
and
intermediary
in
regard
to
online
service
and
business
,
which
be
of
great
importance
to
Ireland
's
economy
.
consider
this
,
and
in
the
context
of
the
obligation
due
under
the
EU
directive
,
discussion
take
place
with
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
and
the
legal
adviser
in
we
Department
in
order
to
frame
a
draft
regulation
and
put
it
into
the
public
domain
for
consultation
.
the
regulation
follow
the
wording
of
the
copyright
directive
so
that
we
be
in
compliance
and
include
a
very
important
proviso
that
the
court
shall
have
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
any
person
likely
to
be
affect
and
this
include
,
where
appropriate
,
a
direction
require
a
person
to
be
notify
of
the
application

my

in

follow

,
I
have
meeting
with
representative
from
many
of
the
above
body
include
,
isp
,
rightsholder
and
consumer
.
the
consultation
attract
over
50
submission
from
interested
party
.
several
of
this
submission
contain
legal
argument
in
regard
to
the
issue
,
as
well
as
comment
in
respect
of
the
draft
statutory
instrument
which
be
publish
as
part
of
the
consultation
process
.
this
comment
be
forward
by
my
Department
to
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
for
further
consideration
.
follow
this
,
and
after
meeting
with
interested
party
,
it
be
clearly
necessary
to
proceed
with
the
statutory
instrument
which
will
restate
the
law
in
relation
to
injunction
against
intermediary
which
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
the
judgment
.
this
will
make
compliance
with
the
copyright
directive
manifestly
clear
.
the
wording
of
the
statutory
instrument
have
be
formally
draft
and
the
text
be
publish
last
Thursday
,
26
January
.
there
be
no
change
of
policy
be
put
forward
in
the
propose
legislative
measure
.
it
be
merely
a
restatement
of
the
position
that
be
consider
to
be
in
place
before
a
high
court
judgment
of
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
in
October
2010
.
I
would
like
people
to
note
the
timeline
,
which
be
in
October
2010
.
Ireland
be
oblige
to
provide
that
rightsholder
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
legal
proceedings
against
the
State
have
be
issue
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
UPC
case
and
damage
arise
from
a
successful
challenge
could
be
substantial
.
the
European
Commission
also
request
information
,
on
22
December
2011
,
on
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the
copyright
directive
.
while
the
copyright
directive
require
that
rights
holder
must
be
able
to
seek
a
injunction
against
intermediary
to
prevent
or
terminate
a
infringement
,
the
court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
have
hold
that
this
must
be
interpret
in
a
way
which
allow
a
fair
balance
to
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
EU
law
have
hold
that
copyright
be
not
a
absolute
right
but
must
be
balance
with
other
rights
protect
by
the
European
Union
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
-
such
as
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
datum
protection
,
and
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
-
and
that
any
remedy
must
be
proportionate
.
no
national
authority
or
court
can
require
a
isp
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
of
the
information
that
it
transmit
on
its
network
.
this
mean
a
isp
cannot
be
ask
to
monitor
all
the
datum
of
each
of
its
customer
in
order
to
prevent
any
future
infringement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
National
court
must
strike
a
fair
balance
between
the
protection
of
copyright
and
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
.
as
regards
relevant
case
law
,
I
refer
to
the
recent
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
,
CJEU
,
case
,
Scarlet
v.
Sabam
,
C
-
70/10
,
which
enunciate
the
general
principle
in
relation
to
the
balance
require
to
be
take
into
account
.
in
this
case
on
24
November
2011
,
the
CJEU
clearly
lay
out
the
aforementioned
principle
that
will
guide
all
national
court
in
future
.
I
beg
you
indulgence
on
this
,
acting
chairperson
,
because
there
be
some
pertinent
point
.
I
will
read
fast
.
in
that
case
,
the
CJEU
also
find
that
require
a
isp
to
install
a
contested
filter
system
would
not
be
respect
the
requirement
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
right
to
intellectual
property
and
the
freedom
to
conduct
business
,
the
right
to
protection
of
personal
datum
and
the
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
.
I
be
fully
aware
that
concern
have
be
express
that
the
propose
statutory
instrument
mirror
the
stop
Online
Piracy
Act
in
the
Unite
State
.
however
,
I
would
point
out
that
this
concern
be
not
base
on
fact
.
the
most
worry
aspect
of
the
US
proposal
would
involve
block
access
to
website
internationally
;
take
down
entire
website
for
one
infring
item
;
block
access
to
website
by
the
US
state
enforcement
without
notice
;
target
company
between
the
site
and
end
-user
,
without
notice
-
for
example
,
service
provider
,
search
engine
,
payment
network
provider
and
advertising
network
;
impose
a
monitoring
of
content
requirement
on
Internet
company
and
,
in
effect
,
force
they
to
self
-
censor
;
extension
of
criminal
liability
;
the
by
-
passing
of
safe
-
harbour
provision
in
copyright
law
;
lack
of
due
process
;
disregard
for
fundamental
human
rights
;
and
the
involvement
of
government
in
civil
infringement
area
,
etc
.
I
would
stress
that
such
a
regime
could
not
be
introduce
in
the
EU
,
where
the
safe
-
harbour
provision
be
protect
in
the
e-commerce
directive
and
where
,
in
implement
EU
law
,
the
European
Union
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
must
be
apply
.
this
include
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
,
protection
of
datum
,
the
right
to
protection
of
personal
datum
and
the
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
with
the
right
to
intellectual
property
.
critically
,
any
order
grant
must
be
proportionate
.
this
matter
must
be
consider
when
deliberate
on
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
it
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
note
that
the
purpose
of
the
propose
statutory
instrument
be
simply
to
provide
explicitly
that
injunction
may
be
seek
,
as
obligate
by
the
two
EU
directive
that
I
have
already
refer
to
,
namely
,
the
copyright
directive
,
2001
and
the
enforcement
directive
,
2004
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
such
injunction
be
available
in
all
other
EU
member
state
by
virtue
of
the
two
directive
already
refer
to
.
they
have
be
require
since
at
least
December
2002
and
since
that
time
the
Internet
have
flourish
.
in
grant
such
injunction
,
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
justice
of
the
European
Union
judgment
.
as
I
have
already
state
,
this
judgment
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
the
statutory
instrument
be
sufficient
because
,
particularly
follow
the
court
of
justice
decision
in
the
Scarlet
v.
Sabam
case
,
the
court
have
authoritative
guidance
on
the
balance
to
be
achieve
between
,
on
the
one
hand
,
intellectual
property
rights
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
internet
service
provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
,
the
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
and
proportionality
of
any
remedy
.
I
thank
the
Member
opposite
and
I
appreciate
the
acting
Chairman
's
discretion
.
my
Department
launch
a
independent
review
committee
on
9
May
2011
,
with
a
view
to
examine
and
review
the
exist
Irish
copyright
and
legislative
framework
.
the
copyright
Review
Committee
be
a
independent
body
.
its
term
of
reference
be
clear
and
,
in
general
,
be
concerned
with
identify
any
area
that
might
be
deem
to
create
barrier
to
innovation
,
and
to
make
recommendation
to
resolve
any
problem
identify
.
follow
the
advice
of
both
the
former
and
current
Attorneys
General
,
it
be
consider
necessary
that
Ireland
's
position
in
ensure
that
rightsholder
can
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
be
use
to
infringe
they
copyright
,
must
be
restate
.
otherwise
,
the
State
be
at
risk
of
action
against
it
,
which
would
probably
result
in
substantial
damage
.
nothing
the
review
committee
could
suggest
can
change
this
fact
.
it
be
difficult
to
see
what
condition
could
be
attach
to
the
statutory
instrument
that
be
not
already
provide
for
by
EU
law
,
for
example
,
datum
protection
,
freedom
of
expression
,
information
,
and
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
.
the
copyright
review
committee
be
expect
to
publish
its
first
consultation
papershortly
follow
consideration
of
the
submission
receive
.
one
of
the
item
for
further
consideration
could
be
a
voluntary
forum
for
all
stakeholder
,
in
which
various
copyright
matter
could
be
discuss
.
a
intermediary
be
a
isp
that
provide
mere
conduit
,
caching
or
host
service
on
the
Internet
.
as
such
,
a
entity
such
as
www.boards.ie,
because
it
avail
of
the
hosting
exemption
,
could
be
consider
a
intermediary
.
however
,
no
injunction
may
be
take
against
it
provide
it
abide
by
the
notice
and
take
down

as
set
out
in
the

related
Right
Act
2000
,
to
which
section
40
(

)
refer
.
in
conclusion
,
in
propose
to
amend
the
copyright
legislation
,
I
be
particularly
conscious
of
the
importance
of
online
content
and
digital
business
in
the
Irish
context
and
,
by
introduce
the
propose

I
be

to

Ireland
's

compliance
with
its
obligation
under

the
decision
of
the

it
be
clear
from
the
ruling
of
the
European
court
that
any
remedy
apply
will
have
to
be
proportionate
and
we
can
be
confident
that
this
approach
protect
rightsholder
by
allow
they

we
must
provide

,
the
date
by
which

to
have

/

.
have
that
provision
enshrine
in
EU
law
and
the
law
of
member

for
a
decade
have
not

the
development
of
the
Internet

.
on
the
contrary
,
the
Internet

I
thank
the
Acting
Chairman
for
she
indulgence
in
grant
I
a
few
extra
minute
.
as
I
outline
in
my
speech
,
one
must
have
regard
to
proportionality
.
the
Sabam
ruling
be
such
that
if
somebody
be
to
seek
a
injunction
before
a
judge
,
the
latter
would
have
to
establish
that
infringement
occur
in
the
first
instance
.
in
make
such
a
decision
,
a
judge
must
have
regard
to
the
basic
rights
that
exist
.
member
articulate
the
circumstance
that
arise
in
this
regard
with
reference
to
the
EU
charter
of
fundamental
rights
and
the
rights
in
the
copyright
directive
.
a
judge
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
be
a
copyright
holder
and
that
there
be
a
individual
isp
,
a
business
,
with
the
right
to
conduct
its
business
,
as
be
inherent
in
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
in
other
word
,
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
be
not
superior
to
that
of
the
individual
citizen
or
business
.
with
regard
to
seek
a
injunction
and
measure

,
there
be
no
way
of

the
actual
cost
,
even
though
individual
have
come
forward
with
proposal
on
the
cost
of
a
high
court
injunction
.
I
would
have
faith
in
the
fact
that
the
Irish
judicial
system
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
be
specific
rights
regard
monitoring
,
especially
in
light
of
the
Sabam
ruling
.
on
the
effect
of
a
isp
,
one
must
ask
what
be
a
intermediary
.
I
have
outline
this
in
my
speech
and
will
probably
not
repeat
it
.
it
be
question
of
proportionality
.
if
a
person
be
access
a
site
such
as
www.youtube.com
and
be
not
act
legally
,
a
court
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
need
for
proportionality
.
why
would
a
Irish
court
shut
down
a
Irish
website
,
potentially
with
million
of
user
,
because
of
the
action
of
one
person
?
one
could
argue
it
would
be
a
infringement
of
the
right
of
the
business
person
to
conduct
he
business
.
the
issue
of
proportionality
,
therefore
,
must
come
into
play
.
there
be
certain
fundamental
rights
that
must
be
adhere
to
.
before
a
injunction
be
seek
,
a
judge
in
Ireland
would
have
to
have
complete
regard
for
that
rights
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
I
do
not
believe
reputational
damage
will
arise
from
this
.
it
be
a
statutory
instrument
.
we
must
ask
its
purpose
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
's
judgment
in
the
case
of
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
.
advice
receive
from
the
Attorney
General
under
the
last
and
current
mandate
state
that
,
in
order
to
remove
any
doubt
as
to
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
to
seek
a
injunction
,
the
good
approach
would
be
to
amend
exist
legislation
.
in
this
statutory
instrument
,
all
we
be
do
be
amend
exist
legislation
,
namely
the
copyright
act
.
have
regard
to
the
Charleton
ruling
,
we
be
put
ourselves
in
a
position
in
which
there
will
be
no
doubt
as
to
whether
we
will
be
compliant
with
EU
law
.
no
.
I
draw
attention
to
the
circumstance
that
would
obtain
if
we
be
not
a
party
to
the
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
case
.
it
could
be
state
that
,
under
the
copyright
Act
2000
,
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
over
a
infringement
already
exist
.
we
be
merely
restate
that
position
.
the
reason
for
much
of
the
controversy
on
this
stem
from
the
fact
that
this
issue
have
be
arise
for
well
over
a
year
,
bear
in
mind

I
make
it

on
this
issue
.
as
late
as
last
Thursday
,
I
meet
the
Irish
Internet
Association
and
have
further
discussion
with
it
.
we
be
not
try
to
impose
something
.
if
we
be
to
legislate
from
a
primary
perspective
in
regard
to
the
Internet
,
we
would
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
we
would
do
that
give
there
be
so
many
disparate
community
within
the
web
space
as
well
as
the
copyright
holder
.
my
prefer
option
,
give
the
EU
be
now
look
at
the
copyright
or
e-commerce
directive
,
be
that
the
community
would
start
talk
across
the
various
and
disparate
grouping
,
such
as
the
hoster
,
the
isp
,
the
software
developer
,
the
copyright
holder
and
so
on
.
it
be
important
that
this
community
start
to
consult
with
the
various
stakeholder
within
the
community
to
begin
the
process
of
come
up
with
a
strategic
view
as
to
how
we
can
either
legislate
primarily
or
put
in
place
voluntary
agreement
.
my
prefer
option
be
for
voluntary
agreement
because
assume
all
stakeholder
come
to
the
table
honestly
and
openly
,
this
ensure
that
if
primary
legislation
be
implement
it
do
not
become
outmoded
or
outdated
as
soon
as
it
be
enact
by
virtue
of
further
innovation
within
the
web
.
what
we
be
do
here
be
merely
restate
a
position
which
we
hold
to
have
already
exist
,
namely
,
uphold
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
while
have
regard
to
the
balance
of
rights
in
that
respect
.
I
do
not
believe
primary
legislation
be
require
at
this
stage
.
the
technical
Group
have
put
forward
a
proposal
for
a
statutory
instrument
.
if
time
allow
and
bear
in
mind
there
be
more
question
to
follow
,
I
would
like
to
answer
the
individual
point
the
technical
Group
have
make
give
it
have
put
forward
a
honest
and
open
solution
to
this
issue
.
while
I
have
only
have
a
brief
few
hour
to
analyse
it
,
since
it
be
submit
today
at
12.45
p.m.
,
there
be
some
issue
within
it
which
I
would
like
to
address
because
I
consider
it
a
honest
effort
to
address
the
issue
at
hand
.
on
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
's
point
,
Ireland
have
the
concept
of
the
take
-
down
notice
.
I
use
www.boards.ie
and
there
be
other
example
with
which
we
be
all
familiar
,
such
as
YouTube
.
if
a
person
become
a
member
of
www.boards.ie,
the
presumption
be
that
the
person
have
sign
up
to
a
set
of
behavioural
protocol
by
which
he
or
she
will
abide
,
and
will
not
say
anything
defamatory
or
do
anything
that
be
in
breach
of
copyright
,
as
a
individual
user
.
if
the
person
do
that
,
there
be
a
mechanism
so
that
,
through
its
own
monitoring
mechanism
,
www.boards.ie
can
expel
a
errant
user
or
somebody
who
be
,
if
I
may
use
the
term
,
act
the
maggot
.
therefore
,
this
already
exist
as
a
voluntary
code
deal
with
behaviour
.
if
,
however
,
we
begin
legislate
in
a
proscriptive
way
for
every
single
behaviour
on
the
Internet
,
we
will
be
go
down
a
very
narrow
funnel
.
as
I
have
state
and
to
answer
deputy
O'Dea
's
question
,
the
informal
competitiveness
council
be
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
set
of
action
in
regard
to
the
issue
we
be
talk
about
,
which
be
the
correct
approach
.
however
,
the
reason
we
have
have
to
implement
the
statutory
instrument
,
as
the
deputy
will
appreciate
give
he
be
a
member
of
the
last
government
,
be
that
this
have
be
ongoing
for
a
considerable
period
and
the
State
be
potentially
expose
to
be
sue
by
various
entity
.
I
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
it
be
taxpayer
's
money
which
be
potentially
in
question
.
the
point
be
that
I
do
not
believe
a
Irish
judge
,
if
he
or
she
be
have
regard
to
the
e-commerce
directive
,
will
not
also
have
regard
to
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
,
which
have
come
into
operation
and
be
the
legal
entity
,
and
also
the
SABAM
ruling
.
I
do
not
believe
any
Irish
judge
would
not
adhere
to
the
principle
of
proportionality
in
this
sense
.
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
take
-
down
notice
,
if
a
hoster
decide
it
be
not
go
to
take
down
the
content
follow
a
take
-
down
notice
on
the
assumption
that
this
take
-
down
notice
be
on
foot
of
a
real
breach
of
copyright
,
perhaps
it
be
then
open
for
the
person
against
whom
the
infringement
occur
to
seek
the
injunction
.
what
we
want
to
do
be
to
get
into
a
space
in
this
country
where
the
system
operate
on
a
voluntary
basis
,
with
clear
protocol
.
to
be
fair
,
the
music
industry
need
to
adopt
new
model
and
need
to
begin
to
get
its
music
on
to
more
platform
,
as
note
by
deputy
O'Dea
,
and
need
to
begin
find
new
mechanism
for
sell
its
music
.
already
,
Netflix
be
come
on
stream
,
which
will
also
give
rise
to
issue
.
the
more
content
that
be
legally
available
through
a
multitude
of
mechanism
,
the
more
likely
it
be
we
will
encounter
copyright
theft
and
piracy
issue
.
that
be
where
we
want
to
get
to
.
however
,
I
do
not
believe
the
State
should
be
too
prescriptive
about
how
we
get
to
that
point
.
I
would
like
to
see
the
community
come
together
on
that
issue
.
I
refer
to
deputy
Ferris
's
point
.
person
be
interpret
this
as
we
do
the
bid
of
the
large
corporation
.
this
be
not
the
stop
on
-
line
piracy
act
,
SOPA
.
we
be
not
extend
massive
power
of
intervention
so
that
we
can
step
into
the
breach
to
try
to
protect
one
side
over
another
.
this
be
not
SOPA
legislation
.
this
be
balancing
the
right
of
a
copyright
holder
against
the
right
of
a
individual
.
there
be
inherent
rights
in
the
charter
of
fundamental
rights
and
in
the
e-commerce
directive
which
give
rights
to
the
individual
company
to
conduct
its
business
.
we
must
also
have
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
copyright
holder
,
which
could
be
a
small
publishing
house
.
person
perceive
the
copyright
holder
to
be
"
big
music
"
but
it
could
be
a
small
internet
publishing
business
,
a
person
create
he
or
she
own
music
at
home
.
they
have
copyright
and
certain
protection
.
I
do
not
believe
this
measure
will
be
use
by
big
business
as
a
tool
to
beat
down
website
.
Google
be
one
of
the
big
corporation
in
the
world
and
it
have
a
right
to
do
business
here
if
it
have
a
Irish
or
European
Union
domain
.
that
rights
be
protect
but
be
not
subservient
to
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
.
I
take
the
deputy
up
on
a
point
he
make
about
the
statutory
instrument
.
he
be
infinitely
more
experienced
than
I
be
,
as
a
legislator
,
and
he
will
appreciate
that
this
be
not
new
policy
and
therefore
a
statutory
instrument
can
apply
.
we
be
not
at
odd
with
the
programme
for
government
in
this
because
we
be
only
amend
legislation
.
I
reply
respectfully
to
the
deputy
in
that
regard
.
this
be
a
balancing
between
the
two
.
the
small
guy
or
girl
who
begin
with
the
gaming
industry
have
certain
rights
as
copyright
holder
and
we
must
protect
they
as
much
as
we
must
protect
the
citizen
's
right
to
access
the
Internet
.
proportionality
be
the
key
to
this
debate
.
at
this
point
,
I
will
address
the
point
submit
by
the
technical
Group
in
regard
to
the
statutory
instrument
.
I
will
briefly
give
my
analysis
of
they
.
there
be
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
two
statutory
instrument
.
I
respect
the
point
make
.
we
be
not
set
out
a
new
policy
framework
but
clarify
legislation
through
a
amendment
to
the
copyright
act
.
we
be
go
back
to
the
position
prior
to
the
EMI
v.
UPC
case
where
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
by
a
copyright
holder
be
there
.
I
note
the
technical
Group
's
alternative
clause
propose
the
statutory
instrument
be
of
two
-
year
duration
.
we
have
to
monitor
event
,
however
,
in
the
intervene
two
year
and
move
quickly
if
essential
balance
be
not
maintain
.
that
would
be
imped
by
a
two
-
year
clause
.
on
the
technical
Group
's
paragraph
c
,
my
propose
statutory
instrument
already
include
a
provision
that
the
court
will
have
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
any
person
affect
by
virtue
of
the
grant
of
any
such
injunction
and
the
court
will
give
such
direction
,
include
where
appropriate
a
direction
require
a
person
to
be
notify
of
the
application
.
this
cover
the
technical
Group
's
point
and
to
we
mind
it
would
be
the
action
of
a
prudent
judge
.
on
paragraph
would
,
the
remedy
of
damage
will
not
be
available
against
a
intermediary
provide
it
abide
by
the
e-commerce
directive
.
again
,
the
e-commerce
directive
have
certain
rights
which
protect
the
business
.
give
the
wide
variety
of
circumstance
that
may
prevail
,
it
be
feel
the
good
approach
be
to
have
the
matter
deal
with
case
by
case
through
a
judicial
process
which
must
balance
all
the
rights
involve
.
protection
be
already
in
place
under
European
law
.
the
European
Court
of
Justice
require
all
remedy
must
be
proportionate
while
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression
and
to
conduct
a
business
must
be
balance
with
the
right
to
intellectual
property
in
consider
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
provide
in
law
for
the
protection
of
personal
datum
,
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
,
the
right
to
property
and
consumer
protection
.
on
paragraph
email
,
one
cannot
predict
future
circumstance
.
that
be
why
we
again
feel
the
good
approach
be
to
deal
with
the
matter
case
by
case
through
the
judicial
process
.
many
rights
be
involved
in
this
paragraph
such
as
the
right
to
copyright
and
to
intellectual
property
in
general
.
the
first
matter
to
be
consider
be
to
establish
if
there
be
a
infringement
.
if
lawful
content
be
also
include
,
the
right
of
make
available
by
the
owner
of
the
lawful
content
have
to
be
consider
.
the
rights
of
the
citizen
,
consumer
and
end
-
user
in
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
must
also
be
take
into
account
.
the
right
to
datum
protection
must
come
into
the
mix
on
the
point
make
by
the
technical
Group
.
the
right
of
the
Internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
to
conduct
a
business
and
all
that
it
entail
must
also
be
upheld
.
for
the
purpose
of
clarity
,
the
technical
Group
submit
a
alternative
statutory
instrument
,
and
I
be
address
specific
point
in
it
.
on
paragraph
f
and
gram
of
the
technical
Group
's
submission
concern
injunction
,
this
matter
be
already
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
.
EU
law
have
hold
any
measure
must
be
fair
and
proportionate
and
not
excessively
costly
.
yet
again
,
give
the
vary
circumstance
that
could
arise
,
we
feel
a
case
-
by
-
case
analysis
and
the
balancing
of
rights
and
consideration
of
all
matter
by
judicial
process
be
the
proper
forum
for
such
decision
.
on
deputy
Keating
's
point
about
publicise
this
,
I
want
to
reiterate
we
have
a
open
consultation
on
it
.
I
state
on
the
record
I
be
available
to
meet
anybody
.
I
have
send
out
three
communication
to
all
deputy
,
across
all
party
,
and
Senator
on
this
issue
so
far
.
I
have
engage
with
the
media
in
as
open
a
fashion
as
possible
.
I
be
willing
to
talk
to
people
and
be
make
myself
available
to
the
Internet
community
to
talk
to
it
on
this
.
on
deputy
Buttimer
's
point
about
the
implication
of
this
amendment
,
I
reiterate
this
be
about
balancing
the
rights
of
Internet
user
,
internet
business
and
the
copyright
holder
.
the
isp
,
as
I
outline
early
,
be
the
mere
conduit
,
the
mechanism
through
which
information
flow
.
they
act
responsibly
,
as
do
individual
website
,
and
in
the
majority
of
case
do
not
overtly
seek
to
facilitate
copyright
theft
.
a
solution
to
the
problem
might
be
voluntary
agreement
in
place
between
copyright
holder
and
individual
isp
,
hoster
and
caching
company
.
I
do
not
believe
we
be
do
the
bid
of
big
business
because
there
be
as
many
-
a
multitude
of
-
small
Irish
copyright
holder
on
this
island
who
have
the
right
to
certain
protection
which
be
not
superior
to
the
other
rights
I
have
outline
prior
to
this
.
I
thank
deputy
for
a
consider
and
thoughtful
debate
.
we
key
belief
be
that
we
cannot
trample
on
the
rights
of
individual
citizen
or
business
.
we
be
try
to
uphold
that
belief
and
all
we
be
do
with
this
amending
legislation
be
ensure
we
be
on
the
right
side
of
EU
law
.
copyright
be
a
principle
to
which
this
state
adhere
but
I
reiterate
it
be
not
a
superior
right
for
the
purpose
of
this
statutory
instrument
.
I
disagree
with
deputy
Donnelly
's
contention
.
the
mechanism
by
which
www.boards.ie
operate
be
such
that
if
member
do
anything
untoward
,
a
take
down
notice
can
be
issue
to
the
website
.
I
be
sure
www.boards.ie
comply
with
take
down
notice
where
illegal
activity
or
defamatory
comment
be
suspect
.
why
would
that
threaten
its
core
business
?
I
listen
to
the
deputy
.
person
speak
about
the
cost
of
defence
.
just
because
one
apply
for
a
injunction
,
the
judge
will
not
necessarily
grant
it
.
we
must
have
regard
for
the
rights
of
individual
company
to
conduct
they
business
and
for
citizen
to
express
themselves
freely
.
nobody
be
trample
on
that
rights
.
this
statutory
instrument
restate
a
position
which
we
already
hold
prior
to
the
Charleton
judgment
.
it
be
important
that
all
the
stakeholder
sit
down
with
each
other
to
chart
a
strategy
on
how
this
space
will
operate
in
the
future
.
in
the
context
of
the
disparate
nature
of
the
user
and
business
that
operate
in
this
space
,
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
chart
a
way
forward
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
make
myself
available
to
facilitate
that
process
.
as
recently
as
this
morning
,
there
be
engagement
with
the
Internet
community
through
the
Irish
Internet
Association
as
one
of
the
stakeholder
.
we
be
open
to
that
discussion
.
in
regard
to
sign
the
statutory
instrument
,
I
have
address
the
issue
raise
by
the
technical
Group
.
I
have
already
state
that
it
be
we
intention
to
proceed
with
the
statutory
instrument
.
the
State
have
be
expose
on
this
issue
,
which
have
be
ongoing
since
November
2010
,
and
what
we
be
do
be
a
proportionate
response
.
we
will
not
infringe
on
anybody
's
right
to
conduct
a
business
or
to
free
expression
through
the
Internet
.
in
regard
to
the
alternative
statutory
instrument
propose
by
T.J.
McIntyre
,
I
have
debate
the
issue
with
he
in
public
media
and
I
be
not
averse
to
engage
with
the
digital
rights
community
with
a
view
to
hammer
out
a
strategy
.
however
,
we
have
to
implement
the
statutory
implement
and
we
be
do
so
on
foot
of
advice
from
two
Attorneys
General
.
I
have
to
take
account
of
the
sound
advice
give
by
a
Attorney
General
.
this
legislative

the
future
of

web

the
State
,
but
we
be
not
change
the
wording
of
the
statutory
instrument
.
I
remind
deputy
Donnelly
that
I
have
state
that
on
numerous
occasion
,
with
all
due
respect
.
if
I
may
-----
some
background
information
may
be
useful
in
appreciate
the
context
of
the
propose
legislative
instrument
.
the
EU
provide
in
the
e-commerce
directive
2000/31
/
ec
for
exemption
from
liability
for
copyright
infringement
for
intermediary
service
provider
in
case
of
mere
conduit
,
caching
and
host
,
upon
certain
condition
.
this
be
to
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
e-commerce
and
telecommunication
industry
.
although
such
provider
be
thus
free
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
EU
copyright
directive
2001
/
29
/
ec
(
as
allow
for
in
the
e-Commerce
directive
)
provide
that
rights
holder
must
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
comply
with
EU
law
.
as
you
will
appreciate
,
for
a
member
of
the
European
Union
,
non-compliance
with
EU
law
be
a
very
serious
matter
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
it
have
be
decide
to
introduce
a
Statutory
instrument
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
various
judgment
of
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
.
EU
law
have
hold
that
copyright
be
not
a
absolute
right
but
must
be
balance
with
other
rights
protect
by
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
.
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
,
on
24
November
2011
,
clearly
lay
out
this
principle
that
will
guide
all
national
court
in
future
(
Case
C-70/10
-
SABAM
)
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
Internet
Service
Provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
and
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
281
and
291
together
.
in
relation
to
the
scenario
the
deputy
have
outline
,
it
be
important
to
mention
that
copyright
holder
will
not
have
power
to
compel
the
intermediary
as
state
.
the
copyright
owner
will
have
the
right
to
apply
to
the
high
court
for
a
injunction
against
a
intermediary
in
respect
of
work
in
which
he
hold
the
copyright
.
the
propose
statutory
instrument
allow
for
the
possibility
of
apply
for
a
injunction
only
in
respect
of
a
particular
work
.
this
would
have
to
be
consider
by
a
court
in
its
deliberation
on
the
granting
of
a
injunction
against
a
intermediary
.
furthermore
,
all
remedy
contemplate
must
be
proportionate
,
as
require
by
the
copyright
directive
,
and
take
into
account
the
various
judgment
of
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
in
this
area
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
follow
the
adoption
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
,
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
apply
to
the
court
when
implement
EU
law
.
this
mean
that
in
consider
the
grant
of
a

,
a
court
must
balance

property
right
with
the
other
fundamental

guarantee

,
include
:
protection
of
personal
datum
,
freedom
of

and
information
,
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
and
right
to

.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
requirement
be
legislate
for
be
to
ensure
that

be
in

it
be
not
a

piracy
or
simply
host
copyright
material
.
it
must
be
show
that
the
service
in
question
be
use
to
infringe
copyright
.
the
legislation
propose
be
a
restatement
of
the
situation
that
be
think
to
pertain
prior
to
the
EMI
&
onsoger
v

judgment

counterfeit
and
pirated
goods
.
as
you
be
aware
,
counterfeiting
and
piracy
be
now
serious
problem
which
undermine
legitimate
trade
and
the
sustainable
development
of
the
world
economy
.
the
growth
of
this
illegal
trade
have
lead
the
ACTA
participant
to
agree
to
develop
a
instrument
that
will
strengthen
international
co-operation
regard
this
serious
development
.
ACTA
be
a
agreement
about
the
enforcement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
it
do
not
oblige
any
of
its
EU
signatory
to
create
new
substantive
rights
or
to
change
exist
one
.
it
only
commit
its
EU
signatory
to
ensure
that
the
right
holder
can
fully
assert
they
rights
if
,
when
and
where
they
exist
.
the
ACTA
provision
be
compatible
with
exist
EU
law
.
therefore
,
it
will
not
require
any
revision
or
adaptation
of
EU
law
and
will
not
require
any
Member
State
to
review
the
measure
or
instrument
by
which
they
implement
relevant
EU
law
.
my
Department
have
consult
the
relevant
Department
affect
by
ACTA
and
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
to
ascertain
compliance
of
Irish
legislation
with
the
provision
of
ACTA
.
it
be
not
expect
that
there
will
be
a
need
to
amend
current
Irish
legislation
.
however
,
before
ratify
ACTA
,
my
Department
will
again
confirm
with
all
relevant
Department
of
State
and
with
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
,
that
all
legislative
and
administrative
requirement
be
in
place
to
enable
Ireland
to
fulfil
its
obligation
under
the
agreement
.
the
Directorate
General
for
Trade
organised
a
stakeholder
consultation
exercise
in
both
2009
and
2010
.
my
department

in
addition
,
my
Department

a
wide
range
of
stakeholder

invite
they
to
take
part
in
the
exercise
.
my
Department
have
also
provide
information
regard
ACTA
on
its
website
,
include
the
final
text
of
the
Treaty
.
under
the
term
of
the
treaty
on
the
functioning
of
the
EU
,
the
EU
and
its
Member
State
cannot
conclude
the
agreement
without
the
consent
of
the
European
Parliament
.
the
Parliament
's
International
Trade
Committee

,
and
be
expect
to

a
decision
on
whether
to
approve
it
in
April
or
May
.
a
final
plenary
vote
be
tentatively
schedule
for
June
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
296
and
297
together
.
as
the
deputy
be
aware
the
judgment
of
the
high
Court
in
the
case
of
EMI
&
onsoger
v
UPC
hold
that
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
that
Ireland
do
not
comply
with
EU
law
.
as
you
will
appreciate
,
non-compliance
with
EU
law
be
a
very
serious
matter
.
follow
a
public
consultation
process
which
be
conduct
by
my
Department
,
and
take
all
matter
into
account
,
include
the
opinion
of
the
Attorney
General
,
it
be
feel
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
restatement
of
the
situation
which
be
consider
to
pertain
in
Irish
law
in
relation
to
injunction
against
intermediary
prior
to
the
judgment
in
the
EMI
&
onsoger
v
UPC
case
.
this
be
necessary
to
ensure
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
it
be
for
this
reason
that
a
legislative
instrument
be
propose
.
I
wish
to
state
that
no
policy
change
be
propose
in
the
Statutory
Instrument
as
it
have
be
the
intention
of
the
copyright
and
related
rights
act
to
provide
such
civil
remedy
and
it
have
be
assume
that
such
be
the
case
up
to
the
high
court
judgment
in
EMI
Ireland
&
other
versus
UPC
.
accordingly
,
the
wording
of
the
propose
Statutory
instrument
have
be
frame
in
a
manner
which
merely
give
effect
to
the
wording
of
the
EU
copyright
Directive
(
i.e.
article
8
(
3
)
of
2001/29
/
ec
)
rather
than
extend
its
scope
beyond
that
of
intermediary
.
the
intend
purpose
of
the
propose
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
to
enact
new
EU
legislation
but
rather
it
seek
to
merely
restate
the
position
that
be
think
to
exist
in
the
copyright
legislation
prior
to
justice
Charleton
's
judgment
here
and
in
all
EU
Member
State
.
accordingly
,
the
introduction
of
this
measure
by
way
of
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
policy
outline
in
the
Programme
for
government
.
some
background
information
may
be
useful
in
appreciate
the
context
of
the
propose
legislative
instrument
.
the
EU
provide
in
the
e-commerce
directive
2000/31
/
ec
for
exemption
from
liability
for
copyright
infringement
for
intermediary
service
provider
in
case
of
mere
conduit
,
caching
and
host
,
upon
certain
condition
.
this
be
to
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
e-commerce
and
telecommunication
industry
.
although
such
provider
be
thus
free
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
EU
copyright
directive
2001
/
29
/
ec
(
as
allow
for
in
the
e-Commerce
directive
)
provide
that
rights
holder
must
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
the

judgment
(
in

ors
v

)
hold
that
by

as

,
non-compliance
with

serious
matter
.
my
Department
have
consider
that

under

40
(
4
)
of
the
copyright
Act
and
the
inherent
power
of
the

to
grant

,
which
be
equitable
and
discretionary
remedy
,
grant
accord
to
settle
principle
,
develop
by
the

.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
it
have
decide
to
introduce
a
Statutory
instrument
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
this
judgment
.
