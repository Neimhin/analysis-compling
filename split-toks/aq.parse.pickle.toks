have
estimate
that
,
by
2014
,
the
cloud
computing
industry
in
Ireland
could
be
worth
€
9.5
billion
and
employ
between
8500
and
9000
people
.
now
,
more
than
ever
,
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
seize
opportunity
like
this
.
this
job
will
be
create
automatically
,
and
the
government
must
act
decisively
and
urgently
if
we
be
to
position
Ireland
as
a
world
leader
in
this
high
-
growth
sector
.
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
on
cloud
computing
set
out
the
government
's
intention
in
this
important
area
of
the
ICT
industry
.
we
job
be
to
engage
with
the
centre
for
management
and
organisation
development
,
CMOD
.
the
government
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
this
.
one
could
say
work
be
ongoing
on
make
the
ICT
infrastructure
more
user
friendly
.
there
will
be
challenge
,
potentially
in
regard
to
industrial
relation
peace
,
but
I
believe
strongly
that
through
proper
engagement
with
all
the
stakeholder
across
government
and
by
take
a
more
horizontal
approach
as
oppose
to
the
more
siloed
approach
we
be
use
to
,
we
can
achieve
something
and
become
global
leader
in
adopt
early
new
technology
such
as
that
associate
with
cloud
computing
.
I
do
not
quite
get
the
last
point
.
I
be
not
aware
of
such
problem
.
I
say
that
openly
and
honestly
.
research
be
ongoing
and
the
centre
be
in
the
process
of
develop
a
cloud
computing
strategy
for
the
public
service
,
which
it
intend
to
bring
to
the
government
for
consideration
and
approval
in
the
first
quarter
of
2012
.
if
a
specific
issue
arise
,
I
would
love
to
hear
the
deputy
's
thought
.
I
fundamentally
disagree
with
the
deputy
.
if
he
be
willing
to
show
I
the
source
of
the
statistic
he
cite
,
I
will
revert
to
he
on
the
matter
.
EMC
,
the
Irish
Internet
Association
,
Facebook
,
IBM
,
Microsoft
,
Fujitsu
,
Dell
and
A&L
Goodbody
be
all
engage
in
this
process
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
process
because
if
we
can
become
global
leader
by
dint
of
be
early
adopter
we
will
have
a
competitive
advantage
.
I
recognise
that
problem
arise
in
broadband
provision
but
the
capacity
be
present
in
term
of
cloud
.
if
the
deputy
engage
further
with
the
Department
,
we
can
send
he
some
fact
on
the
issue
.
on
job
creation
,
this
Department
must
deal
with
the
reality
of
the
capital
funding
available
to
it
.
on
10
November
the
government
publish
its
infrastructural
and
capital
investment
medium
-
term
exchequer
framework
for
the
period
2012
to
2016
.
overall
,
capital
investment
total
€
17
billion
have
be
allocate
across
Department
.
in
one
way
or
another
,
all
of
this
€
17
billion
ultimately
have
a
focus
on
job
creation
.
the
government
's
role
be
to
create
the
condition
within
which
it
will
maximise
the
impact
of
this
capital
allocation
and
support
the
private
sector
in
the
creation
of
job
.
within
the
medium
-
term
framework
the
State
's
support
to
enterprise
and
innovation
have
be
protect
and
prioritise
and
clear
target
for
job
creation
have
be
set
.
when
average
over
the
lifetime
of
the
framework
,
the
job
creation
target
for
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
be
set
to
approximately
22659
per
annum
.
the
capital
allocation
for
programme
fund
by
the
Department
be
to
be
increase
in
2012
to
€
514
million
,
a
increase
of
€
6
million
on
the
2011
allocation
,
and
support
to
industry
will
be
maintain
in
excess
of
pre-recession
level
when
total
capital
expenditure
be
at
its
high
.
this
represent
a
strong
commitment
in
this
department
to
the
development
of
enterprise
and
provide
the
development
agency
with
sufficient
resource
to
target
aggressively
the
project
and
investment
that
will
drive
economic
renewal
.
in
set
out
this
level
of
capital
investment
in
the
productive
economy
the
government
have
be
cognisant
of
issue
,
include
maximise
the
achievement
of
value
for
money
and
the
sustainability
of
job
creation
measure
.
while
the
notion
of
spend
a
additional
€
3.1
billion
per
annum
on
job
creation
might
sound
attractive
,
what
the
economy
need
be
structural
change
.
the
government
must
ensure
the
enterprise
development
support
and
agency
be
fit
for
purpose
and
well
position
to
help
Ireland
to
move
out
of
the
current
downturn
by
create
sustainable
job
and
continue
to
grow
export
in
traditional
key
market
,
as
well
as
target
high
growth
market
such
as
the
BRIC
country
for
both
export
and
inward
investment
.
the
government
have
make
inroad
in
bring
about
this
change
,
as
well
as
restore
confidence
across
enterprise
,
investor
and
consumer
.
for
example
,
work
be
advance
within
the
Department
on
determine
the
extent
of
the
restructuring
of
the
county
enterprise
board
;
IDA
Ireland
have
restructure
in
order
that
more
of
its
staff
be
in
client
-
face
job
,
while
Enterprise
Ireland
have
make
operational
a
new
potential
exporter
division
which
will
target
company
with
export
potential
.
this
be
just
a
few
example
of
the
change
be
bring
about
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
which
be
make
in
good
faith
.
however
,
in
respect
of
the
government
's
capital
allocation
,
there
have
be
a
4
%
increase
in
Enterprise
Ireland
's
capital
budget
for
2012
.
I
will
rush
through
the
figure
because
I
be
conscious
of
the
time
constraint
,
but
there
have
be
a
10
%
increase
in
the
number
of
high
potential
start
-
up
company
,
a
20
%
increase
in
the
number
of
innovation
partnership
and
expenditure
of
€
18
million
on
the
innovation
fund
.
the
key
point
be
that
the
government
be
try
to
set
down
the
foundation
or
the
bedrock
on
which
one
can
sustain
job
over
a
long
period
.
if
one
consider
Sinn
Féin
's
proposal
for
capital
expenditure
,
they
entail
borrowing
something
like
€
1.7
billion
from
the
European
investment
Bank
.
it
be
talk
out
of
both
side
of
its
mouth
in
this
regard
—
there
be
a
bit
of
the
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
about
it
—
because
,
on
the
one
hand
,
it
state
it
would
not
pay
back
money
to
the
European
institution
from
which
Ireland
have
borrow
money
while
,
on
the
other
,
it
would
have
no
problem
in
borrowing
approximately
€
1.7
billion
from
the
European
investment
Bank
.
this
do
not
stack
up
.
the
government
be
try
to
create
long
-
term
sustainable
job
,
but
the
deputy
be
talk
about
short
-
term
project
base
on
capital
expenditure
.
this
do
not
stack
up
.
in
fairness
to
the
pensioner
who
be
outside
the
gate
of
Leinster
House
today
,
if
I
interpret
the
vox
pop
correctly
,
the
strong
message
also
extend
to
the
amount
of
money
be
take
in
administration
fee
.
I
respectfully
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
I
to
answer
the
question
.
the
pensioner
be
as
adamant
in
they
opposition
to
that
aspect
.
let
we
take
another
look
and
look
at
the
issue
from
the
perspective
of
the
communication
pass
between
Department
.
however
,
with
all
due
respect
,
as
the
question
tab
by
the
deputy
pertain
to
capital
expenditure
of
€
3.1
billion
,
he
will
forgive
I
if
I
do
not
have
a
exact
answer
for
he
on
the
issue
of
the
pension
fund
mention
.
the
Seventh

in

run-up
to
historic
parliamentary
election
which
be
due
to
get
under

on
28
November
.
we
all
recall
the
event
last
February
in
Tahrir
Square
which
prove
so
inspiring
,
when
the
discredite
government
of
former
President
Hosni
Mubarak
be
sweep
away
in
a
impressive
demonstration
of
people
power
.
in
the
intervene
nine
month
,
Ireland
and
its
EU
partner
have
be
monitor
closely
the
transition
to
democratic
rule
in
Egypt
.
we
have
be
offer
all
possible
political
support
and
respond
positively
to
request
for
practical
assistance
.
it
be

that
,
as
in

democratic
transformation
in

,
the
uprising
in
Egypt
that

President
Mubarak
's
rule
be
a
genuinely
popular
one
,
draw
support
from

that
it
be
for
Egypt
itself
to
determine
the
pace
of
its

transition
and
how
the

can

assist

it
need
to
be
recognise
that
profound
and
historic
change
have
take
place
in
Egypt
during
the
past
nine
month

previously
.
the
former
President
and
he
close
associate
have
be
publicly
put
on
trial
for
they
crime
,
a
event
to
behold
for
ordinary
Egyptians
when
they
consider
how
impregnable
the
rule
of
President
Mubarak
appear
just
one
short
year
ago
.
despite
this
,
concern
have
be
grow
in
recent
month
at
the
overall
slow
pace
of
the
transition
in
Egypt
and
the

also
of
considerable
concern
have
be
the

its

last

,
when

as
with

the

most

the

have
cause
renew
apprehension
among

that
this
and

there

the

if

they

therefore
,
if

they
will
look

Seán

,
Alex

,
Patrick
O'Donovan
,
Eamonn

it
be
essential
that
European
leader
make
and
implement
clear
decision
quickly
to
prove
we
share
determination
to
protect
we
currency
,
support
member
state
that
be
work
towards
economic
recovery
,
and
introduce
strong
rule
to
ensure
fiscal
discipline
.
that
be
the
word
of
the
Taoiseach
.
a
philosophical
debate
need
to
take
place
within
this
House
about
the
nature
of
we
membership
of
the
European
Union
.
we
either
have
a
inter-governmental
model
or
a
inter-institutional
or
community
method
base
model
.
the
question
the
Opposition
must
ask
itself
if
it
propose
a
strong
inter-
governmental
model
,
be
if
it
will
be
base
on
one
country
with
one
vote
or
a
qualified
majority
vote
mechanism
.
notwithstanding
the
current
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
since
1972
Ireland
traditionally
have
always
do
much
well
through
a
community
method
.
it
be
through
strong
inter-institutional
link
,
a
strong
European
parliament
and
small
member
state
bind
together
that
we
can
act
as
a
contrary
force
to
the
weight
of
the
large
country
.
if
we
implement
a
raw
inter
-
governmental
model
,
the
"
Merkozy
"
effect
will
always
continue
to
hold
sway
.
we
must
have
a
qualitative
debate
about
what
membership
entail
,
and
this
must
be
base
not
just
on
short
-
term
political
gain
by
certain
party
in
the
House
but
in
a
proper
discussion
of
membership
.
I
do
not
see
how
a
position
can
be
reconcile
where
a
party
believe
a
referendum
must
be
put
on
membership
but
it
also
argue
that
the
power
of
the
ECB
should
be
extend
to
cover
more
than
its
remit
with
regard
to
inflation
.
the
premise
of
the
belief
be
that
the
referendum
would
be
support
as
it
would
expand
the
power
of
the
ECB
.
the
Sinn
Féin
Party
must
grapple
with
that
idea
.
nobody
should
come
to
the
House
to
talk
about
such
wide
issue
as
the
loss
of
economic
sovereignty
without
spell
out
in
detail
what
that
mean
.
there
be
a
bit
of
a
Tadhg
a
dá
thaobh
approach
from
Sinn
Féin
on
the
matter
,
and
its
position
be
fundamentally
contradictory
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
deputy
Tom
Barry
and
Peter
Fitzpatrick
.
the
government
be
attempt
to
create
a
necessary
framework
that
seek
to
reform
and
evolve
the
social
protection
code
.
I
would
like
to
address
my
comment
to
the
budgetary
measure
introduce
.
if
I
stray
from
the
exact
content
of
the
social
Welfare
Bill
2011
,
I
do
so
because
I
want
to
comment
on
it
in
a
wide
context
.
we
must
consider
the
social
Welfare
Bill
2011
in
the
wide
budgetary
context
.
there
be
thousand
of
worker
who
be
not
in
receipt
of
any
type
of
social
protection
measure
.
there
be
,
therefore
,
a
strongly
hold
view
that
reform
of
the
social
protection
code
be
necessary
.
I
take
on
board
the
view
espouse
by
that
speaker
who
precede
I
.
we
must
have
due
regard
to
the
extraordinary
fiscal
pressure
we
be
under
in
term
of
the
deficit
reduction
target
to
which
we
be
align
.
to
be
fair
,
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Burton
,
have
genuinely
seek
to
address
the
disability
payment
issue
.
the
government
have
listen
to
what
have
be
say
by
all
side
of
the
House
on
that
matter
and
have
move
to
address
it
.
some
of
we
be
only
in
government
a
relatively
short
time
and
we
openly
acknowledge
that
there
be
issue
in
the
budget
which
need
to
be
address
.
we
acknowledge
the
statement
make
by
member
on
the
opposite
side
in
relation
to
that
matter
.
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
state
that
the
pressure
on
we
social
welfare
budget
be
enormous
.
the
financial
allocation
for
jobseeker
's
payment
increase
from
€
1.4
billion
in
2007
to
€
3.9
billion
this
year
,
a
increase
of
176
%
.
the
provision
for
State
pension
have
increase
from
€
3.75
billion
in
2007
to
€
4.7
billion
this
year
.
we
will
need
to
increase
this
financial
allocation
year
-
on
-
year
owe
to
the
demographic
profile
.
a
additional
allocation
of
€
1.75
million
will
be
require
in
2012
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Burton
,
be
honour
the
government
's
commitment
not
to
cut
welfare
rate
,
increase
income
tax
on
working
people
,
to
protect
carer
and
to
standardise
child
benefit
payment
.
the
social
protection
measure
in
this
Bill
signal
a
move
by
government
to
move
we
country
close
to
economic
recovery
and
towards
the
restoration
of
we
sovereignty
.
some
€
4.2
million
will
be
provide
for
training
on
CE
through
the
national
training
fund
.
in
addition
,
SOLAS
will
continue
to
provide
access
by
CE
participant
to
its
training
programme
.
the
Department
will
spend
€977
million
on
employment
support
in
2012
,
up
from
€
882
million
in
2011
.
it
be
in
that
context
that

the
need
to
shift
from
a
passive

system
to
a
far
more
active
approach
be
vital
.
I
be
sure
we
would
all
subscribe
to
that
philosophy
regardless

the

will
publish

will
outline
its

in

view
,
the

need
to
be
view
holistically

my
Department
and
its
agency
will
be
able
to
continue
current
level
of
spending
on
job
creation

to
increase
the
scope
for
some
crucial

to
implement
some
new

in
my
area
of
responsibility

research

,
there
be
a
allocation
of
€370

although
that
be
a
slight
decrease
at
only
98

however
,
it
allow

in
each
of
the
contribution

I
thank
the
Deputy
for
raise
this
important
matter
and
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
for
the
opportunity
to
respond
.
I
be
concerned
at
the
continue
situation
at
the
Vita
Cortex
factory
in
Cork
which
have
involve
worker
at
the
plant
engage
in
a
sit
-
in
since
16
December
last
arise
from
a
dispute
with
they
employer
over
redundancy
payment
.
the
worker
involve
in
the
Vita
Cortex
sit-in
be
seek
severance
term
of
2.9
week
per
year
of
service
,
inclusive
of
statutory
redundancy
,
in
line
with
previous
redundancy
deal
at
the
company
,
and
they
maintain
this
will
amount
to
a
total
of
€
1.2
million
.
we
know
that
the
worker
have
be
offer
a
paltry
sum
of
€
1500
to
leave
the
premise
over
the
Christmas
period
and
they
rightly
reject
this
offer
claim
that
the
company
would
use
they
absence
to
remove
important
machinery
and
stock
.
the
company
state
that
it
inform
worker
that
they
redundancy
would
have
to
come
from
the
State
's
social
insurance
fund
unless
NAMA
agree
to
release
€
2.5
million
hold
on
deposit
by
another
Vita
Cortex
firm
on
foot
of
a
allied
Irish
Banks
,
AIB
,
loan
take
over
by
NAMA
.
however
,
NAMA
issue
a
statement
that
this
fund
be
put
out
of
reach
of
the
Vita
Cortex
group
not
by
NAMA
but
by
AIB
two
and
a
half
year
ago
when
they
be
pledge
as
security
for
loan
.
while
NAMA
have
state
that
it
empathise
with
the
Vita
Cortex
worker
,
it
have
state
that
:
"
unfortunately
legally
it
cannot
simply
use
charge
deposit
fund
pledge
against
loan
of
one
company
to
meet
cost
incur
by
a
separate
legal
entity
"
.
NAMA
also
state
that
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
owner
and
shareholder
of
Vita
Cortex
to
resolve
this
situation
.
it
be
difficult
to
disagree
with
that
contention
.
in
the
interest
of
achieve
a
resolution
in
this
dispute
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
urge
both
party
to
avail
of
the
State
's
industrial
relation
machinery
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
view
to
explore
way
of
resolve
the
issue
in
dispute
.
official
from
my
Department
be
in
contact
with
the
worker
's
union
representative
over
the
holiday
period
,
in
a
effort
to
clarify
the
issue
involve
and
to
make
they
aware
that
the
industrial
relation
machinery
of
the
State
be
available
to
help
they
resolve
the
dispute
.
I
understand
that
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
have
today
invite
both
party
to
meet
in
Cork
next
Tuesday
to
clarify
the
fact
and
to
explore
with
the
party
the
potential
for
move
forward
.
I
welcome
the
initiative
by
the
LRC
and
urge
both
party
to
engage
constructively
in
the
process
.
engagement
with
the
State
's
industrial
relation
machinery
offer
the
good
way
at
this
stage
.
the
ultimate
aim
be
to
ensure
that
the
rights
of
worker
be
vindicate
.
we
all
have
that
interest
at
heart
.
the
second
aim
be
to
ensure
that
corporate
social
responsibility
be
adhere
to
and
that
there
be
some
degree
of
corporate
governance
.
I
agree
with
the
Deputy
on
the
perceive
Byzantine
structure
of
Vita
Cortex
.
we
must
also
remember
that
Vita
Cortex
be
a
recipient
of
State
funding
.
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
this
state
to
ensure
that
we
can
shine
a
light
on
that
company
in
some
way
.
if
there
be
a
mechanism
through
which
a
query
can
be
make
to
the
director
of
corporate
enforcement
about
the
company
structure
,
then
I
actively
encourage
people
to
use
it
.
it
be
impossible
to
say
at
this
stage
what
the
premise
of
the
discussion
will
be
.
the
LRC
extend
the
invitation
just
today
and
I
hope
that
both
party
will
agree
to
engage
in
that
process
.
we
should
see
where
we
can
go
from
there
.
other
point
be
raise
in
respect
of
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
meeting
with
both
side
and
with
company
management
.
I
will
take
back
that
point
to
the
minister
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
State
will
use
its
force
in
a
positive
sense
to
ensure
that
worker
's
rights
be
vindicate
.
we
be
not
go
to
rest
on
that
-----
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
deputy
Martin
about
the
legal
basis
of
NAMA
's
position
.
I
will
also
bring
that
to
the
minister
.
no
one
political
entity
in
the
House
have
a
monopoly
on
the
rights
of
worker
.
I
speak
with
regard
to
the
Vita
Cortex
case
,
in
which
there
be
a
serious
breach
of
corporate
social
responsibility
and
corporate
governance
,
and
the
same
apply
in
respect
of
this
case
.
there
be
no
question
but
that
the
rights
of
worker
have
not
be
vindicate
and
have
be
trample
upon
.
under
legislation
from
1977
to
2007
govern
the
protection
of
employee
,
a
number
of
provision
deal
with
a
information
and
consultation
process
that
must
be
enter
into
prior
to
any
redundancy
be
implement
and
the
provision
of
information
to
employee
and
to
the
minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
in
this
case
,
the
minister
have
not
receive
any
statutory
notice
of
such
redundancy
.
that
be
a
serious
breach
in
the
first
instance
.
there
be
a
need
for
my
Department
to
engage
with
Mr.
Meegan
and
other
of
Mandate
who
,
it
be
report
meet
KPMG
today
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
assessment
of
what
transpire
at
that
meeting
because
the
point
raise
on
this
and
the
previous
topical
issue
matter
go
to
the
heart
of
industrial
relation
policy
and
vindicate
the
rights
of
worker
.
as
a
government
,
we
must
ensure
there
be
no
precedent
set
and
the
legislation
be
adhere
to
by
corporate
entity
,
individual
and
citizen
.
there
be
no
question
that
we
support
the
rights
of
worker
as
set
down
in
legislation
and
will
seek
to
do
so
.
by
way
of
be
helpful
,
I
express
my
willingness
to
meet
worker
representative
on
this
issue
in
order
that
we
can
provide
some
degree
of
assistance
where
possible
.
I
be
keep
my
statement
brief
because
I
realise
member
will
wish
to
make
further
submission
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
and
I
be
not
one
to
pay
lip
service
to
issue
such
as
this
.
with
respect
,
I
have
indicate
that
I
want
to
meet
the
worker
's
representative
on
this
issue
.
I
be
concerned
,
as
deputy
McDonald
have
point
out
,
that
there
be
a
perceive
breach
of
legislation
.
there
be
a
perceive
breach
of
legislation
in
respect
of
section
9
and
10
of
the
Protection
of
employment
Act
1977
and
Regulation
6
of
the
European
Community
(
Protection
of
employment
)
regulation
whereby
employee
,
whose
employer
have
not
comply
with
section
9
and
10
of
the
Protection
of
employment
Act
1977
,
may
refer
complaint
to
a
rights
commissioner
.
there
be
issue
around
the
mandatory
notice
to
employer
.
please
allow
I
that
mode
of
communication
and
let
we
see
how
we
can
proceed
.
I
would
point
out
that
Ireland
have
a
strong
and
robust
regime
for
deal
with
copyright
infringement
whether
in
the
digital
environment
or
otherwise
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
provide
a
technology
-
neutral
exclusive
right
for
copyright
owner
to
communicate
they
work
through
any
mode
.
the
Act
also
contain
extensive
provision
deal
with
infringement
of
that
right
or
other
,
whether
civil
or
criminal
.
the
rights
holder
may
proceed
against
that
who
infringe
they
copyright
in
a
number
of
way
.
for
example
,
in
the
digital
environment
,
it
be
a
infringement
for
the
person
provide
facility
(
such
as
a
internet
service
provider
)
not
to
remove
infring
material
when
notify
by
the
rights
holder
.
another
remedy
allow
the
rights
holder
to
obtain
the
identity
of
allege
infringer
,
include
that
involve
in
illegal
file
-
share
,
from
a
internet
society
service
provider
by
means
of
judicial
process
.
this
can
then
be
pursue
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
infringer
.
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
copyright
act
provide
for
secondary
and
contributory
liability
.
in
relation
to
one
of
the
remedy
available
to
rights
holder
,
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
fully
comply
with
EU
law
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
a
legislative
instrument
be
be
finalise
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
exist
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
judgement
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be

by
such
measure

and
right
of
freedom
of

it
be
expect
that
this
measure
will
be

this
month

I
propose
to
take
question

the
Statutory

be
be

I
never
think
deputy
Tóibín
would
patronise
in
that
way
.
achieve
savings
in
the
Department
's
budget
have
require
difficult
decision
.
despite
pressure
on
spending
,
the
government
have
shield
to
the
great
extent
possible
front
line
service
in
school
.
the
government
have
and
will
continue
to
prioritise
target
support
for
school
,
with
the
most
concentrate
level
of
educational
disadvantage
through
the
DEIS
programme
and
action
plan
.
more
than
€
158
million
be
currently
be
provide
by
way
of
additional
resource
and
support
for
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
,
include
DEIS
.
this
be
only
part
of
a
overall
amount
of
some
€
700
million
,
which
continue
to
be
provide
to
tackle
educational
disadvantage
across
the
full
education
spectrum
,
from
pre-school
to
further
and
high
education
.
this
include
scheme
such
as
the
school
completion
programme
and
disadvantage
youth
,
which
now
come
under
the
Department
of
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
and
the
school
meal
programme
,
which
come
under
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
a
key
aspect
of
the
EU
-
IMF
programme
of
support
and
Ireland
's
overall
budgetary
strategy
be
a
requirement
to
reduce
the
public
sector
payroll
.
this
be
a
particular
challenge
for
the
education
sector
,
consider
that
a
third
of
all
public
sector
employee
work
there
.
furthermore
,
unlike
in
other
country
,
we
school
-
go
population
be
rise
rapidly
and
place
must
be
provide
for
the
extra
70000
pupil
arrive
in
we
school
in
the
next
six
year
.
provide
for
increase
enrolment
be
a
key
priority
but
make
some
adjustment
to
teacher
number
be
unavoidable
,
give
budgetary
constraint
.
the
net
impact
on
overall
teacher
number
in
we
school
have
be
minimise
to
the
great
extent
possible
.
we
be
conscious
of
the
concern
of
some
school
which
will
be
adversely
affect
by
the
withdrawal
of
post
under
previous
disadvantaged
scheme
,
and
with
this
concern
in
mind
we
have
make
clear
since
the
budget
announcement
that
this
matter
would
be
manage
as
sensitively
as
possible
.
to
this
end
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
meet
school
principal
,
teacher
,
parent
and
community
representative
in
recent
week
to
hear
they
concern
and
clarify
the
position
of
announce
change
in
the
2012
budget
to
post
allocate
to
school
under
previous
scheme
to
tackle
educational
disadvantage
.
the
minister
have
hold
many
meeting
with
member
of
my
parliamentary
party
and
all
government
colleague
,
who
have
perform
a
invaluable
service
in
assist
he
in
develop
a
understanding
of
the
impact
of
the
propose
measure
in
this
school
.
it
be
in
this
context
that
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
have
be
direct
to
report
to
the
minister
within
the
next
four
week
on
the
position
of
DEIS
band
one
and
band
two
school
which
currently
have
post
under
scheme
predate
DEIS
.
that
will
do
in
the
context
of
staff
allocation
due
to
issue
to
all
school
in
the
come
week
.
we
look
forward
to
receive
that
report
and
continue
the
process
of
engagement
with
school
on
the
impact
of
the
measure
announce
in

2012
budget

it
be
for
job
creation
.
the

be
the
deputy
be
ironic
,
talk
about
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
?
it
be
scandalous
to
be
lecture
like
that

official
in
my

currently
make
the
necessary
arrangement
with

of

Sports
Capital
Programme
early
this
year
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
consider
and
valuable
contribution
to
the
debate
.
I
will
start
by
provide
clarification
on
last
point
make
,
on
the
assumption
that
the
deputy
may
be
leave
the
Chamber
.
student
can
study
Russian
on
the
leave
certificate
curriculum
.
there
be
a
number
of
Confucius
institute
throughout
the
State
where
Chinese
language
may
be
learn
,
as
well
as
at
University
College
Cork
and
quite
a
number
of
secondary
school
.
as
to
Portuguese
,
I
may
revert
to
the
deputy
on
that
one
.
I
note
the
point
he
be
make
;
we
be
conscious
of
that
.
in
he
introductory
speech
,
the
minister
set
out
the
rationale
for
the
propose
Protection
of
employee
(
temporary
Agency
work
)
Bill
2011
,
which
be
necessary
to
meet
we
obligation
to
transpose
the
EU
directive
on
temporary
and
agency
worker
.
in
the
contribution
by
deputy
on
the
Bill
,
it
have
be
evident
that
there
be
,
in
general
,
a
overall
welcome
for
the
Bill
in
this
House
,
with
most
deputy
express
they
support
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
be
a
fair
and
balance
measure
to
improve
the
level
of
protection
for
agency
worker
under
employment
law
.
while
deputy
have
indicate
broad
support
for
the
thrust
of
the
Bill
,
I
note
the
intention
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
deputy
to
table
amendment
on
committee
stage
in
order
to
achieve
great
clarity
in
some
aspect
of
the
Bill
.
in
several
intervention
on
the
Bill
,
there
have
be
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
need
for
balance
in
the
manner
in
which
the
EU
directive
be
transpose
,
so
that
the
necessary
protection
for
agency
worker
do
not
act
as
a
deterrent
to
we
ability
to
sustain
exist
job
and
increase
employment
.
give
the
current
challenge
that
face
the
government
in
the
domestic
labour
market
and
the
economy
generally
,
the
Bill
have
be
draft
with
a
view
to
achieve
this
necessary
balance
.
it
provide
that
agency
worker
be
afford
equal
treatment
,
in
respect
of
they
basic
working
and
employment
condition
,
with
directly
recruit
employee
who
occupy
the
same
job
.
this
mark
a
further
important
step
forward
in
worker
's
rights
and
build
on
the
already
considerable
baseline
of
rights
afford
to
agency
worker
in
this
country
who
be
protect
under
the
exist
suite
of
employment
legislation
.
the
government
be
fully
commit
to
decent
standard
of
employment
across
the
spectrum
of
work
.
it
be
clear
that
agency
worker
have
,
on
a
incremental
basis
,
be
bring
within
the
scope
of
employment
rights
legislation
over
many
year
,
include
legislation
on
the
payment
of
wage
and
unfair
dismissal
.
in
addition
,
agency
worker
in
Ireland
,
unlike
in
some
other
jurisdiction
,
also
enjoy
entitlement
under
redundancy
payment
legislation
.
in
term
of
minimum
standard
of
pay
,
temporary
agency
worker
be
already
cover
in
legislation
govern
the
national
minimum
wage
;
as
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
government
have
,
true
to
the
commitment
give
in
the
pre-election
period
last
year
,
reverse
the
reduction
in
the
minimum
wage
rate
.
this
Bill
therefore
build
on
exist
standard
of
protection
that
be
confer
on
agency
worker
and
reflect
the
government
's
willingness
to
fully
support
the
principle
of
fair
treatment
for
agency
worker
.
the
government
must
have
regard
to
other
equally
valid
concern
that
have
be
express
about
the
need
to
create
a
positive
environment
for
business
to
grow
and
develop
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
importance
of
agency
worker
in
the
multinational
sector
as
well
as
in
the
domestic
economy
.
a
fully
function
labour
market
that
contribute
to
the
retention
of
job
,
and
indeed
future
growth
,
be
important
in
this
challenging
time
.
we
must
maintain
labour
market
flexibility
in
all
area
,
include
the
area
of
agency
work
,
which
provide
flexibility
for
worker
and
employer
alike
.
deputy
raise
a
number
of
issue
during
the
course
of
the
debate
.
with
regard
to
the
failure
of
the
national
social
partner
to
reach
agreement
on
a
qualifying
period
before
equal
treatment
would
apply
,
this
be
,
as
the
minister
outline
in
he
introductory
speech
on
the
Bill
,
a
matter
of
regret
,
as
it
would
at
least
mean
that
recruitment
agency
that
operate
both
north
and
south
of
the
Border
would
be
operate
under
similar
arrangement
in
both
jurisdiction
to
allow
a
all
-
of
-
Ireland
approach
.
while
there
be
still
time
for
the
national
social
partner
to
negotiate
agreement
on
this
issue
should
the
basis
for
such
a
agreement
become
apparent
before
the
deliberation
of
the
Oireachtas
on
this
Bill
be
complete
and
the
Bill
be
enact
,
the
basis
for
such
agreement
be
not
currently
in
evidence
and
,
as
deputy
will
be
aware
,
the
Legislature
cannot
unilaterally
provide
for
this
derogation
.
the
legislation
be
,
with
the
exception
of
the
offence
provision
,
be
make
retrospective
to
5
December
2011
-
that
be
,
the
date
of
transposition
of
the
directive
.
this
be
because
the
State
be
obligate
by
virtue
of
its
EU
commitment
under
the
treaty
to
have
the
transposing
measure
in
place
as
and
from
the
transposition
date
,
and
the
advice
available
to
the
government
indicate
that
this
course
of
action
be
require
.
I
appreciate
the
difficulty
associate
with
retrospective
application
,
and
that
be
why
,
in
the
interest
of
provide
the
great
possible
level
of
clarity
to
all
party
affect
by
this
legislation
,
my
Department
move
quickly
,
follow
the
breakdown
of
negotiation
on
the
qualifying
period
with
the
national
social
partner
on
30
November
2011
,
to
communicate
with
the
various
stakeholder
.
advertisement
be
take
out
in
the
national
newspaper
and
the
Department
produce
a
guidance
document
and
place
it
on
its
website
to
cover
the
issue
of
great
interest
to
all
party
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
importance
of
agency
work
in
the
multinational
and
domestic
sector
and
point
out
that
,
contrary
to
common
perception
,
agency
worker
be
in
some
instance
very
well
remunerate
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
directive
and
this
Bill
aim
to
provide
a
new
minimum
floor
of
basic
entitlement
and
pay
.
for
this
reason
,
there
be
no
intention
to
include
other
element
that
be
not
require
by
the
directive
,
such
as
pension
,
sick
pay
,
maternity
top
-
up
and
benefit
-
in
-
kind
.
the
latter
be
discretionary
element
that
be
not
,
in
the
word
of
the
directive
,
binding
and
generally
applicable
.
give
the
current
economic
circumstance
,
now
be
not
the
time
to
try
to
provide
gilt
-
edged
condition
of
employment
when
the
creation
of
employment
on
a
fair
and
equitable
basis
be
what
be
require
.
under
this
Bill
,
agency
worker
be
entitle
to
be
treat
,
in
they
basic
working
and
employment
condition
,
include
pay
,
as
if
they
be
directly
recruit
by
the
hiring
organisation
to
occupy
the
same
job
.
I
be
conscious
that
a
number
of
intervention
have
focus
on
the
need
for
a
comparator
in
this
situation
,
and
have
refer
to
the
test
under
section
2
of
the
Bill
in
which
any
such
comparable
employee
might
be
identify
.
I
be
conscious
that
the
Bill
need
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
to
ensure
delivery
of
the
fundamental
principle
enshrine
in
article
5.1
of
the
directive
.
in
this
regard
,
it
be
not
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
and
the
entitlement
of
agency
worker
to
equal
treatment
to
have
a
real
-
what
might
be
term
flesh
-
and
-
blood
-
comparator
;
section
6
of
the
Bill
provide
for
this
.
of
course
,
where
there
be
such
a
comparator
,
that
make
it
easy
to
establish
that
equal
treatment
apply
,
and
this
be
provide
for
in
section
6
(
1
)
(
a
)
of
the
Bill
.
where
there
be
no
such
comparator
,
section
6
(
2
)
(
b
)
effectively
place
the
onus
of
responsibility
on
the
hirer
to
notify
the
employment
agency
of
the
relevant
term
and
condition
,
include
pay
rate
,
that
would
apply
if
a
comparable
employee
be
to
be
hire
by
the
hirer
.
a
number
of
deputy
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
outworking
of
the
legislation
give
rise
to
intricate
and
complex
issue
at
a
operational
level
.
for
this
reason
,
they
consider
that
the
Bill
would
benefit
from
further
clarification
in
some
instance
.
in
legislation
of
this
nature
,
which
be
design
to
embrace
the
main
principle
and
policy
at
issue
,
it
be
difficult
to
encompass
all
of
the
outworking
of
the
legislation
that
follow
on
from
the
Bill
.
while
I
agree
that
the
Bill
will
need
to
be
perfect
in
certain
aspect
to
provide
some
necessary
clarification
-
in
that
context
,
it
be
intend
to
table
some
amendment
on
committee
stage
-
many
of
the
issue
raise
by
deputy
will
be
clarify
by
the
development
of
further
guidance
.
it
have
be
the
practice
of
the
Department
in
introduce
new
employment
legislation
to
prepare
a
guidance
publication
that
be
well
gear
to
deal
in
great
depth
with
the
detail
require
,
and
that
be
also
the
intention
in
this
instance
.
finally
,
there
be
some
discussion
about
section
7
of
the
Bill
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
,
in
particular
,
have
concern
about
this
section
in
case
it
be
intend
as
some
type
of
escape
hatch
from
the
provision
of
the
Bill
.
it
be
important
to
clarify
that
this
be
not
the
intention
behind
section
7
,
which
be
a
provision
that
be
welcome
by
all
stakeholder
in
that
it
will
recognise
exist
collective
arrangement
in
place
such
as
under
register
employment
agreement
in
some
sector
.
it
will
also
allow
for
the
conclusion
,
in
the
future
,
of
collective
arrangement
at
workplace
or
sectoral
level
and
provide
a
mechanism
for
the
registration
,
subject
to
approval
,
of
this
agreement
by
the
Labour
Court
.
this
type
of
flexibility
in
the
labour
market
be
very
much
welcome
by
all
party
that
have
a
interest
in
this
legislation
.
as
I
mention
early
,
it
be
intend
to
bring
forward
a
number
of
amendment
on
committee
stage
with
a
view
to
clarify
certain
aspect
that
have
be
already
mention
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
consider
intervention
on
this
important
Bill
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
sub
-
committee
on
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
innovation
pursuant
to
Standing
Order
82a
(
3
)
(
a
)
(
6
)
(
a
)
.
in
the
context
of
overall
necessary
difficult
expenditure
reduction
measure
announce
in
budget
2012
,
new
student
enter
postgraduate
course
from
the
2012
-
2013
academic
year
onwards
will
not
be
entitle
to
any
maintenance
payment
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
however
,
that
student
who
meet
the
qualifying
condition
for
the
special
rate
of
grant
will
be
eligible
to
have
they
postgraduate
tuition
fee
pay
up
to
the
maximum
fee
limit
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
in
addition
,
a
further
limited
number
of
student
who
would
previously
have
qualify
under
the
standard
grant
threshold
will
qualify
to
have
a
€
2000
contribution
make
towards
the
cost
of
they
fee
.
however
,
there
will
be
a
new
income
threshold
for
this
payment
which
will
be
low
than
the
standard
grant
threshold
.
the
income
threshold
for
this
level
of
grant
be
be
determine
in
the
context
of
the
formulation
of
the
student
grant
scheme
for
the
2012
-
13
academic
year
.
the
answer
to
the
second
question
be
9,435
.
regard
the
first
question
,
I
do
not
have
a
specific
date
but
the
review
be
ongoing
.
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
supply
by
the
66
grant
awarding
authority
show
that
9,435
postgraduate
student
be
in
receipt
of
a
student
grant
.
the
distinction
between
the
two
be
not
specify
but
I
can
come
back
to
deputy
Smith
on
that
point
.
in
a
full
year
,
2000
student
on
the
low
income
will
meet
the
qualifying
condition
for
the
special
rate
of
grant
and
will
have
they
fee
pay
up
to
the
maximum
fee
limit
allowable
under
the
student
grant
scheme
.
another
4000
student
will
receive
a
fee
contribution
of
€
2000
.
the
new
arrangement
will
apply
to
two
third
of
the
postgraduate
cohort
on
the
low
income
,
which
be
arguably
a
wide
cohort
of
student
.
it
be
like
try
to
measure
how
long
be
a
piece
of
string
.
we
cannot
predict
the
impact
of
this
in
term
of
exact
number
and
participation
rate
.
participation
rate
at
third
level
be
determine
by
a
myriad
of
factor
and
income
be
not
the
only
criterion
.
Parental
aspect
,
social
and
cultural
factor
,
the
level
of
pre-exist
educational
attainment
,
whether
someone
be
in
employment
,
whether
someone
have
lose
a
job
and
a
certain
amount
of
income
be
other
factor
.
one
can
safely
assume
it
will
have
a
negative
impact
but
we
do
not
know
for
certain
and
there
be
no
way
of
measure
its
impact
.
it
be
part
of
a
package
of
measure
the
Department
and
the
government
have
to
take
in
reduce
spending
.
we
be
honest
about
that
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
the
student
assistance
fund
,
at
the
behest
of
individual
institution
,
be
retain
and
that
tax
relief
for
postgraduate
student
be
retain
.
arise
from
this
budgetary
adjustment
,
the
people
who
be
least
affect
be
the
people
who
will
be
give
the
great
chance
to
go
to
postgraduate
education
,
namely
,
that
who
be
on
the
low
income
threshold
.
we
have
try
to
protect
and
preserve
that
.
that
be
a
very
subjective
statement
.
there
be
no
way
of
predict
the
number
of
people
who
will
apply
for
postgraduate
course
,
except
to
say
that
it
be
increase
year
on
year
.
ironically
,
this
increase
be
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
economic
sovereignty
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Smith
in
respect
of
interaction
with
industry
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
will
be
publish
and
its
purpose
be
to
derive
great
economic
benefit
from
the
research
we
be
carry
out
.
there
be
a
deepening
collaboration
between
industry
and
academia
in
term
of
research
.
I
be
talk
to
global
company
that
provide
thousand
of
job
in
this
country
and
I
be
talk
to
indigenous
firm
that
want
to
move
into
the
space
of
take
on
board
more
graduate
.
Labour
market
activation
measure
,
which
will
be
launch
shortly
,
will
also
attest
to
this
.
in
term
of
the
finite
number
,
we
must
know
the
number
of
people
who
will
apply
for
funding
before
we
know
the
endgame
in
term
of
the
amount
allocate
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
level
of
a
person
's
economic
resource
have
a
impact
on
the
level
of
educational
attainment
.
we
be
seek
to
ensure
we
can
fund
that
with
the
low
income
.
a
number
of
postgraduate
research
base
course
be
fund
by
industry
or
through
call
.
we
must
also
bear
this
in
mind
.
I
be
pleased
to
note
that
the
National
Competitiveness
Council
endorse
the
approach
outline
in
literacy
and
Numeracy
for
learning
and
Life
which
I
launch
in
July
2011
.

I
would
point
out
that
Ireland
have
a
strong
and
robust
regime
for
deal
with
copyright
infringement
whether
in
the
digital
environment
or
otherwise
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
provide
a
technology
-
neutral
exclusive
right
for
copyright
owner
to
communicate
they
work
through
any
mode
.
the
Act
also
contain
extensive
provision
deal
with
infringement
of
that
right
or
other
,
whether
civil
or
criminal
.
the
rights
holder
may
proceed
against
that
who
infringe
they
copyright
in
a
number
of
way
.
for
example
,
in
the
digital
environment
,
it
be
a
infringement
for
the
person
provide
facility
(
such
as
a
internet
service
provider
)
not
to
remove
infring
material
when
notify
by
the
rights
holder
.
another
remedy
allow
the
rights
holder
to
obtain
the
identity
of
allege
infringer
,
include
that
involve
in
illegal
file
-
share
,
from
a
internet
service
provider
by
means
of
judicial
process
.
this
can
then
be
pursue
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
infringer
.
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
copyright
act
provide
for
secondary
and
contributory
liability
.
in
relation
to
one
of
the
remedy
available
to
rights
holder
,
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
fully
comply
with
EU
law
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
a
legislative
instrument
be
be
finalise
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
exist
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
judgement
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
Internet
Service
Provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
and
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
.
it
be
expect
that
this
measure
will
be
introduce
this
month
.
the
minister
do
not
have
information
in
relation
to
the
cost
of
copyright
infringement
in
the
area
of
digital
piracy
.
independent
research
as
to
the
effect
of
illegal
downloading
be
limit
therefore
the
cost
of
such
activity
be
not
readily
quantifiable
.
however
,
in
the
judgement
of
Mr
Justice
Charleton
in
EMI
&
other
versus
UPC
(

it
be
note
that
Mr

a
cost
of

20
m
per

development
so
far
in

agency
for
which
I
have
responsibility
be
that
Dundalk

on

.
Tralee
and

and
Arklow

transfer

,
with

I
also
recently
announce
that
Dublin
Tourism
be
be
merge
with
its
parent
body
—
Failte

—
as

of
the
rationalisation

.
furthermore
,
there
be
a
review

with

to
the
future
tourism
role
of
Shannon
Development
and
its
possible
integration
into
Fáilte
Ireland
,
while
coach
Ireland
have
be
subsume
into
the
Irish
Sports
Council
.
on
the
issue
of
possible
further
rationalisation
,
the
Public
Service
Reform
Plan
require
that
a
number
of
other
agency
be
subject
to
critical
review
which
will
be
complete
by
June
of
this
year
.
in
addition
,
a
port
policy
review
be
at
a
advanced
stage
and
I
hope
to
publish
a
revise
policy
document
in
the
come
month
.
Port
company
restructuring
be
one
of
the
issue
be
consider
as
part
of
the
policy
review
.
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
the
potential
savings
from
rationalisation
until
full
detail
of
each
implementation
have
be
work
through
with
the
agency
in
question
.
there
be
no
proposal
to
introduce
a
government
guarantee
export
credit
insurance
scheme
for
Irish
exporter
to
this
country
.
the
government
's
position
on
this
issue
have
be
inform
by
the
finding
of
the
2009
report
commission
by
my
Department
from
KPMG
consultant
.
that
report
establish
that
the
introduction
of
such
a
scheme
would
be
expensive
,
with
significant
ongoing
cost
arise
for
the
State
.
annual
cost
in
respect
of
quite
a
low
level
of
intervention
in
the
export
credit
market
would
be
about
€
1.7
million
,
and
this
cost
would
rise
significantly
if
high
risk
profile
export
be
cover
.
in
addition
,
it
be
find
that
such
a
scheme
would
be
of
very
limited
impact
and
that
a
negligible
number
of
job
could
be

with
such
a

.
under

rule
,
any
such
state

be
not

most
Irish

into
this
category
.
a

due
to
the
financial

that
be

even
under

the

for
risk
and
the
market
have
recover
significantly
,
with
both
new
entrant
to
the
market
and
new
product
be
offer
.
this
have
greatly
improve
the
availability
of
export
credit
insurance
on
the
commercial
market
.
the
publication
of
the
detailed
KPMG
report
be
not
possible
.
the
forensic
analysis
on
the
operation
of
the
market
for
this
type
of
insurance
be
only
possible
through
the
provision
of
sensitive
,
confidential
datum
and
detailed
company
specific
information
to
KPMG
.
this
information
be
provide
to
KPMG
on
the
condition
of
strict
confidentiality
.
give
the
commercial
sensitivity
of
this
material
and
the
limited
number
of
company
in
the
market
,
both
KPMG
and
the
Department
sign
legally
bind
agreement
with
the
insurer
that
the
information
provide
would
not
be
release
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
while
the
background
research
and
analytical
element
of
the
KPMG
report
cannot
therefore
be
release
,
the
key
overall
finding
be
publicise
at
the
time
and
support
the
view
that
a
State
support
scheme
of
short
-
term
export
credit
insurance
should
not
be
introduce
.
this
remain
the
position
but
will
be
keep
under
ongoing
review
,
include
in
light
of
advice
and
evidence
from
the
appropriate
agency
and
business
representative
group
.
as
the
government
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
efficient
use
of
scarce
resource
,
a
commitment
of
large
-
scale
funding
to
a
initiative
with
marginal
benefit
for
Irish
industry
and
high
level
risk
to
the
State
would
be
unwise
.
I
appreciate
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
.
the
strict
confidentiality
clause
,
which
be
one
of
the
condition
that
apply
when
people
give
information
during
the
compilation
of
that
report
,
should
be
respect
.
we
can
provide
the
deputy
with
the
information
that
be
available
from
Enterprise
Ireland
about
export
figure
and
the
opportunity
that
be
arise
in
the
BRIC
country
.
the
deputy
also
ask
about
investment
in
job
and
the
opportunity
that
will
arise
after
February
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
ongoing
at
government
level
to
compile
the
new
action
plan
for
job
.
more
lateral
theme
be
be
explore
as
we
do
that
.
I
hope
the
deputy
will
take
in
good
faith
my
assurance
that
we
be
try
to
explore
and
mine
as
many
opportunity
as
we
can
.
I
say
that
in
response
to
the
point
she
make
about
job
creation
.
if
I
understand
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
correctly
,
she
say
we
should
avail
of
the
intellectual
capacity
of
people
who
will
find
themselves
in
a
new
situation
after
February
of
this
year
.
the
State
need
to
provide
opportunity
to
such
people
,
or
engage
with
they
at
least
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
the
private
investment
decision
of
a
individual
be
matter
for
the
individual
in
question
.
I
take
the
point
that
be
make
about
find
a
vehicle
for
a
lump
-
sum
investment
.
I
respectfully
suggest
the
deputy
should
engage
with
the
minister
for
Finance
with
a
view
to
explore
possibility
in
that
area
.

I
will
begin
by
confirm
that
this
be
absolutely
not
a
version
of
the
SOPA
legislation
.
it
be
a
restatement
of
a
position
on
copyright
that
the
government
have
hold
to
be
the
case
.
the
Charleton
judgment
in
the
case
of
EMI
v.
UPC
hold
that
Ireland
be
not
ad
idem
with
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
we
be
implement
a
statutory
instrument
to
give
voice
to
that
judgment
and
bring
we
into
line
with
the
directive
.
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
be
implement
in
the
State
.
every
member
state
of
the
European
Union
have
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
,
in
line
with
EU
legislation
,
in
the
event
of
a
perceive
infringement
of
the
copyright
of
a
party
.
prior
to
the
Charleton
judgment
,
to
which
we
be
not
a
party
,
we
position
be
that
we
be
in
line
with
EU
legislation
.
I
do
not
have
one
.
when
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
issue
he
judgment
,
we
consider
it
be
good
to
remove
any
doubt
by
restate
we
position
,
as
set
out
in
the
2000
Act
.
that
be
what
be
before
we
today
-
a
amendment
to
the
act
to
ensure
we
be
in
line
with
the
judgment
.
every
member
state
have
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
in
the
event
of
a
perceive
breach
of
copyright
.
before
a
judge
make
a
decision
he
or
she
will
need
to
have
regard
to
the
e-commerce
directive
which
state
there
be
inherent
rights
in
the
EU
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
to
freedom
of
expression
and
that
the
copyright
directive
provide
that
a
internet
service
-
provider
have
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
and
to
have
regard
to
the
right
of
ordinary
user
to
be
able
to
use
the
Internet
freely
and
openly
.
we
would
not
seek
to
prejudice
this
right
in
any
way
.
I
be
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
the
State
fund
new
technology
,
the
development
of
web
-
base
technology
to
the
tune
of
million
of
euro
annually
and
we
very
conscious
of
the
need
to
continue
to
do
so
.
I
take
deputy
Murphy
's
point
about
the
abdication
of
responsibility
.
however
,
I
respectfully
suggest
to
the
deputy
that
we
need
to
see
a
dialogue
,
a
engagement
,
between
the
internet
service
-
provider
on
one
hand
,
the
copyright
holder
on
the
other
side
and
a
space
in
between
for
a
very
highly
active
Internet
web
-
base
community
.
they
all
need
to
sit
down
together
to
chart
a
way
forward
.
personally
,
I
be
not
averse
to
the
notion
of
primary
legislation
but
no
matter
what
action
be
decide
upon
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
Charlton
judgment
.
if
,
prior
to
this
judgment
,
the
State
already
hold
that
a
person
could
seek
infringement
proceedings
where
a
breach
of
copyright
be
perceive
and
there
have
be
no
site
close
down
as
a
result
,
we
be
merely
restate
what
be
in
the
copyright
Act
or
add
to
it
,
then
it
be
logical
to
assume
there
will
not
be
a
move
to
close
down
further
website
.
I
apologise
.
this
be
a
issue
which
warrant
more
time
but
I
will
speak
again
if
I
may
.
that
be
not
what
I
say
.
I
reiterate
the
point
that
no
national
authority
or
court
can
require
a
internet
service
-
provider
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
of
the
information
it
transmit
on
its
network
.
that
give
rights
to
the
Internet
service
-
provider
and
to
the
individual
ip
address
or
the
individual
user
.
this
mean
the
isp
cannot
be
ask
to
monitor
all
the
datum
of
each
of
its
customer
in
order
to
prevent
any
future
infringement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
this
be
clearly
state
in
EU
law
.
we
be
attempt
to
balance
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
and
to
transpose
that
which
be
already
in
EU
law
and
then
to
recognise
the
rights
of
the
individual
user
,
the
individual
business
and
not
to
limit
the
freedom
of
the
Internet
.
nobody
want
to
limit
the
freedom
of
the
Internet
because
this
be
counter
-
intuitive
.
we
live
in
a
democracy
and
we
thrive
on
the
business
we
have
create
in
this
country
,
through
state
intervention
and
subsidy
which
support
that
type
of
business
.
the
business
model
pertain
to
the
music
industry
be
increasingly
and
arguably
-
I
will
not
use
the
word
outmoded
-
a
evolve
process
.
so
long
as
it
be
a
case
of
never
the
twain
shall
meet
,
then
no
matter
how
one
legislate
primarily
in
this
field
,
as
soon
as
one
legislate
,
the
Internet
,
of
its
very
nature
,
will
evolve
in
a
way
to
circumnavigate
the
legislation
.
in
my
view
,
the
stakeholder
must
sit
down
together
in
a
organic
fashion
because
if
they
do
not
reach
a
agreement
then
no
matter
what
government
be
in
power
,
it
will
never
be
able
to
legislate
for
this
issue
.
give
the
level
of
activity
on
the
Internet
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
,
and
the
level
of
innovation
,
no
one
member
state
,
no
one
geographical
boundary
,
can
set
law
to
try
to
control
it
.
this
be
a
commonly
-
hold
view
to
a
certain
extent
.
I
think
a
liberal
view
be
take
,
in
the
main
,
regard
the
power
of
the
Internet
and
its
inherent
good
.
however
,
as
a
EU
member
state
,
Ireland
must
have
regard
to
copyright
law
.
anyone
who
generate
intellectual
property
have
a
right
but
that
right
be
not
superior
to
the
right
of
the
Internet
service
-
provider
nor
superior
to
the
right
of
the
individual
user
.
when
government
legislate
,
they
must
be
very
careful
.
I
assure
deputy
that
I
will
give
this
matter
more
study
.
we
will
be
implement
the
statutory
instrument
,
I
will
be
very
straight
about
that
-----
it
be
imminent
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
exact
time
but
a
note
will
be
prepare
for
cabinet
.
I
will
have
to
defer
to
the
Chief
Whip
's
office
in
that
regard
.
the
central
point
be
that
that
people
within
that
community
need
to
start
come
together
.
the
isp
and
the
music
industry
people
need
to
sit
down
with
each
other
.
they
have
be
tinker
around
the
edge
of
this
issue
for
a
long
time
.
Ireland
need
to
take
a
strategic
view
as
to
how
it
pitch
itself

let
I
start
by
repeat
that
I
fully
subscribe
to
the
freedom
,
the
opportunity
and
the
access
to
information
that
the
Internet
provide
we
with
.
Ireland
be
home
to
some
of
the
world
's
most
innovative
Internet
company
and
we
be
determined
to
grow
we
reputation
as
a
location
where
smart
people
and
this
smart
company
can
continue
to
innovate
in
this
fast
moving
arena
.
the
last
thing
innovator
need
be
a
culture
where
the
output
of
they
creative
endeavour
have
to
be
lock
away
or
keep
secret
for
the
fear
of
theft
.
Ireland
be
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
modern
suite
of
intellectual
property
law
that
by
they
very
nature
balance
a
range
of
compete
interest
and
rights
in
a
manner
that
be
see
right
across
the
globe
as
reasonable
and
proportionate
.
I
intend
that
this
will
continue
.
in
regard
to
the
propose
statutory
instrument
,
it
may
be
useful
to
explain
the
background
against
which
the
requirement
for
a
amendment
to
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
have
arise
.
in
the
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
high
Court
judgment
of
11
October
2010
,
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
decide
that
he
be
constrain
by
the
wording
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
and
thus
could
not
grant
a
injunction
to
prevent
infringement
of
copyright
against
a
information
service
provider
,
isp
,
in
the
circumstance
of
''
mere
conduit
''
transient
communication
.
in
do
so
,
he
state
that
Ireland
have
not
fully
transpose
the
relevant
EU
directive
.
the
"
mere
conduit
"
principle
provide
that
if
a
isp
do
not
initiate
a
transmission
,
or
modify
the
material
contain
in
a
transmission
and
do
not
select
the
receiver
of
the
transmission
,
it
be
grant
a
"
safe
harbour
"
against
liability
by
virtue
of
the
e-commerce
directive
2000
/
31
/
ec
.
however
,
accord
to
the
same
directive
,
this
freedom
from
liability
do
not
affect
the
power
of
the
court
to
require
service
provider
to
terminate
or
prevent
copyright
infringement
.
I
point
out
that
two
EU
directive
,
namely
,
the
copyright
directive
2001
and
the
enforcement
directive
2004
require
that
the
holder
of
copyright
-
author
,
music
composer
,
lyricist
,
record
producer
,
etc.
-
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
what
be
a
intermediary
?
in
a
nutshell
,
a
intermediary
be
a
isp
which
provide
mere
conduit
,
caching
or
host
service
on
the
Internet
.
my
Department
have
consider
that
injunction
be
available
under
section
40
(
4
)
of
the
copyright
Act
and
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
grant
injunction
,
which
be
equitable
and
discretionary
remedy
,
grant
accord
to
settle
principle
,
develop
by
the
court
.
however
,
this
be
not
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
's
view
.
in
regard
to
the
legal
advice
,
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
be
ask
by
my
Department
and
that
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
for
its
advice
as
to
the
implication
of
the
high
court
judgment
.
the
office
have
advise
that
the
obligation
contain
in
the
directive
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
rightholder
must
have
a
mechanism
available
to
they
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
where
they
intellectual
property
rights
be
be
breach
.
separately
the
office
advise
that
the
prudent
course
be
to
introduce
a
regulation
to
ensure
compliance
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
very
sensitive
issue
.
we
seek
to
strike
a
balance
between
creator
and
user
and
intermediary
in
regard
to
online
service
and
business
,
which
be
of
great
importance
to
Ireland
's
economy
.
consider
this
,
and
in
the
context
of
the
obligation
due
under
the
EU
directive
,
discussion
take
place
with
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
and
the
legal
adviser
in
we
Department
in
order
to
frame
a
draft
regulation
and
put
it
into
the
public
domain
for
consultation
.
the
regulation
follow
the
wording
of
the
copyright
directive
so
that
we
be
in
compliance
and
include
a
very
important
proviso
that
the
court
shall
have
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
any
person
likely
to
be
affect
and
this
include
,
where
appropriate
,
a
direction
require
a
person
to
be
notify
of
the
application
.
this
latter
provision
respects
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
after
consultation
with
the
Attorney
General
's
office
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
,
my
Department

process
.
this
comment
be
forward
by
my
Department
to
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
for
further
consideration
.
follow
this
,
and
after
meeting
with
interested
party
,
it
be
clearly
necessary
to
proceed
with
the
statutory
instrument
which
will
restate
the
law
in
relation
to
injunction
against
intermediary
which
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
the
judgment
.
this
will
make
compliance
with
the
copyright
directive
manifestly
clear
.
the
wording
of
the
statutory
instrument
have
be
formally
draft
and
the
text
be
publish
last
Thursday
,
26
January
.
there
be
no
change
of
policy
be
put
forward
in
the
propose
legislative
measure
.
it
be
merely
a
restatement
of
the
position
that
be
consider
to
be
in
place
before
a
high
court
judgment
of
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
in
October
2010
.
I
would
like
people
to
note
the
timeline
,
which
be
in
October
2010
.
Ireland
be
oblige
to
provide
that
rightsholder
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
legal
proceedings
against
the
State
have
be
issue
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
UPC
case
and
damage
arise
from
a
successful
challenge
could
be
substantial
.
the
European
Commission
also
request
information
,
on
22
December
2011
,
on
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the
copyright
directive
.
while
the
copyright
directive
require
that
rights
holder
must
be
able
to
seek
a
injunction
against
intermediary
to
prevent
or
terminate
a
infringement
,
the
court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
have
hold
that
this
must
be
interpret
in
a
way
which
allow
a
fair
balance
to
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
EU
law
have
hold
that
copyright
be
not
a
absolute
right
but
must
be
balance
with
other
rights
protect
by
the
European
Union
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
-
such
as
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
datum
protection
,
and
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
-
and
that
any
remedy
must
be
proportionate
.
no
national
authority
or
court
can
require
a
isp
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
of
the
information
that
it
transmit
on
its
network
.
this
mean
a
isp
cannot
be
ask
to
monitor
all
the
datum
of
each
of
its
customer
in
order
to
prevent
any
future
infringement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
National
court
must
strike
a
fair
balance
between
the
protection
of
copyright
and
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
.
as
regards
relevant
case
law
,
I
refer
to
the
recent
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
,
CJEU
,
case
,
Scarlet
v.
Sabam
,
C
-
70/10
,
which
enunciate
the
general
principle
in
relation
to
the
balance
require
to
be
take
into
account
.
in
this
case
on
24
November
2011
,
the
CJEU
clearly
lay
out
the
aforementioned
principle
that
will
guide
all
national
court
in
future
.
I
beg
you
indulgence
on
this
,
acting
chairperson
,
because
there
be
some
pertinent
point
.
I
will
read
fast
.
in
that
case
,
the
CJEU
also
find
that
require
a
isp
to
install
a
contested
filter
system
would
not
be
respect
the
requirement
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
right
to
intellectual
property
and
the
freedom
to
conduct
business
,
the
right
to
protection
of
personal
datum
and
the
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
.
I
be
fully
aware
that
concern
have
be
express
that
the
propose
statutory
instrument
mirror
the
stop
Online
Piracy
Act
in
the
Unite
State
.
however
,
I
would
point
out
that
this
concern
be
not
base
on
fact
.
the
most
worry
aspect
of
the
US
proposal
would
involve
block
access
to
website
internationally
;
take
down
entire
website
for
one
infring
item
;
block
access
to
website
by
the
US
state
enforcement
without
notice
;
target
company
between
the
site
and
end
-user
,
without
notice
-
for
example
,
service
provider
,
search
engine
,
payment
network
provider
and
advertising
network
;
impose
a
monitoring
of
content
requirement
on
Internet
company
and
,
in
effect
,
force
they
to
self
-
censor
;
extension
of
criminal
liability
;
the
by
-
passing
of
safe
-
harbour
provision
in
copyright
law
;
lack
of
due
process
;
disregard
for
fundamental
human
rights
;
and
the
involvement
of
government
in
civil
infringement
area
,
etc
.
I
would
stress
that
such
a
regime
could
not
be
introduce
in
the
EU
,
where
the
safe
-
harbour
provision
be
protect
in
the
e-commerce
directive
and
where
,
in
implement
EU
law
,
the
European
Union
Charter
of
Fundamental
rights
must
be
apply
.
this
include
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
,
protection
of
datum
,
the
right
to
protection
of
personal
datum
and
the
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
with
the
right
to
intellectual
property
.
critically
,
any
order
grant
must
be
proportionate
.
this
matter
must
be
consider
when
deliberate
on
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
it
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
note
that
the
purpose
of
the
propose
statutory
instrument
be
simply
to
provide
explicitly
that
injunction
may
be
seek
,
as
obligate
by
the
two
EU
directive
that
I
have
already
refer
to
,
namely
,
the
copyright
directive
,
2001
and
the
enforcement
directive
,
2004
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
such
injunction
be
available
in
all
other
EU
member
state
by
virtue
of
the
two
directive
already
refer
to
.
they
have
be
require
since
at
least
December
2002
and
since
that
time
the
Internet
have
flourish
.
in
grant
such
injunction
,
the
court
must
take
account
of
Court
of
justice
of
the
European
Union
judgment
.
as
I
have
already
state
,
this
judgment
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
the
statutory
instrument
be
sufficient
because
,
particularly
follow
the
court
of
justice
decision
in
the
Scarlet
v.
Sabam
case
,
the
court
have
authoritative
guidance
on
the
balance
to
be
achieve
between
,
on
the
one
hand
,
intellectual
property
rights
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
internet
service
provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
,
the
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
and
proportionality
of
any
remedy
.
I
thank
the
Member
opposite
and
I
appreciate
the
acting
Chairman
's
discretion
.
my
Department
launch
a
independent
review
committee
on
9
May
2011
,
with
a
view
to
examine
and
review
the
exist
Irish
copyright
and
legislative
framework
.
the
copyright
Review
Committee
be
a
independent
body
.
its
term
of
reference
be
clear
and
,
in
general
,
be
concerned
with
identify
any
area
that
might
be
deem
to
create
barrier
to
innovation
,
and
to
make
recommendation
to
resolve
any
problem
identify
.
follow
the
advice
of
both
the
former
and
current
Attorneys
General
,
it
be
consider
necessary
that
Ireland
's
position
in
ensure
that
rightsholder
can
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
be
use
to
infringe
they
copyright
,
must
be
restate
.
otherwise
,
the
State
be
at
risk
of
action
against
it
,
which
would
probably
result
in
substantial
damage
.
nothing
the
review
committee
could
suggest
can
change
this
fact
.
it
be
difficult
to
see
what
condition
could
be
attach
to
the
statutory
instrument
that
be
not
already
provide
for
by
EU
law
,
for
example
,
datum
protection
,
freedom
of
expression
,
information
,
and
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
.
the
copyright
review
committee
be
expect
to
publish
its
first
consultation
papershortly
follow
consideration
of
the
submission
receive
.
one
of
the
item
for
further
consideration
could
be
a
voluntary
forum
for
all
stakeholder
,
in
which
various
copyright
matter
could
be
discuss
.
a
intermediary
be
a
isp
that
provide
mere
conduit
,
caching
or
host
service
on
the
Internet
.
as
such
,
a
entity
such
as
www.boards.ie,
because
it
avail
of
the
hosting
exemption
,
could
be
consider
a
intermediary
.
however
,
no
injunction
may
be
take
against
it
provide
it
abide
by
the
notice
and
take
down

as
set
out
in
the

and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
to
which
section
40
(

)
refer
.
in
conclusion
,
in
propose
to
amend
the
copyright
legislation
,
I
be
particularly
conscious
of
the
importance
of
online
content
and
digital
business
in
the
Irish
context
and
,
by
introduce
the
propose
statutory

I
be
simply

to

Ireland

compliance
with
its
obligation
under

the
decision
of
the

it
be
clear
from
the
ruling
of
the
European
court
that
any
remedy
apply
will
have
to
be
proportionate
and
we
can
be
confident
that
this
approach
protect
rightsholder
by

they

we
must
provide

to

the
date
by
which

to

.
have
that
provision
enshrine
in
EU
law
and
the
law

for
a
decade
have
not

the
development
of

on

contrary
,
the
Internet

I
thank
the
Acting
Chairman
for
she
indulgence
in
grant
I
a
few
extra
minute
.
as
I
outline
in
my
speech
,
one
must
have
regard
to
proportionality
.
the
Sabam
ruling
be
such
that
if
somebody
be
to
seek
a
injunction
before
a
judge
,
the
latter
would
have
to
establish
that
infringement
occur
in
the
first
instance
.
in
make
such
a
decision
,
a
judge
must
have
regard
to
the
basic
rights
that
exist
.
member
articulate
the
circumstance
that
arise
in
this
regard
with
reference
to
the
EU
charter
of
fundamental
rights
and
the
rights
in
the
copyright
directive
.
a
judge
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
be
a
copyright
holder
and
that
there
be
a
individual
isp
,
a
business
,
with
the
right
to
conduct
its
business
,
as
be
inherent
in
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
in
other
word
,
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
be
not
superior
to
that
of
the
individual
citizen
or
business
.
with
regard
to
seek
a
injunction
and
measure

,
there
be
no
way
of
determine
the
actual
cost
,
even
though
individual
have
come
forward
with
proposal
on
the
cost
of
a
high
court
injunction
.
I
would
have
faith
in
the
fact
that
the
Irish
judicial
system
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
be
specific
rights
regard
monitoring
,
especially
in
light
of
the
Sabam
ruling
.
on
the
effect
of
a
isp
,
one
must
ask
what
be
a
intermediary
.
I
have
outline
this
in
my
speech
and
will
probably
not
repeat
it
.
it
be
question
of
proportionality
.
if
a
person
be
access
a
site
such
as
www.youtube.com
and
be
not
act
legally
,
a
court
would
have
to
have
regard
to
the
need
for
proportionality
.
why
would
a
Irish
court
shut
down
a
Irish
website
,
potentially
with
million
of
user
,
because
of
the
action
of
one
person
?
one
could
argue
it
would
be
a
infringement
of
the
right
of
the
business
person
to
conduct
he
business
.
the
issue
of
proportionality
,
therefore
,
must
come
into
play
.
there
be
certain
fundamental
rights
that
must
be
adhere
to
.
before
a
injunction
be
seek
,
a
judge
in
Ireland
would
have
to
have
complete
regard
for
that
rights
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
I
do
not
believe
reputational
damage
will
arise
from
this
.
it
be
a
statutory
instrument
.
we
must
ask
its
purpose
.
we
must
bear
in
mind
Mr.
Justice
Charleton
's
judgment
in
the
case
of
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
.
advice
receive
from
the
Attorney
General
under
the
last
and
current
mandate
state
that
,
in
order
to
remove
any
doubt
as
to
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
to
seek
a
injunction
,
the
good
approach
would
be
to
amend
exist
legislation
.
in
this
statutory
instrument
,
all
we
be
do
be
amend
exist
legislation
,
namely
the
copyright
act
.
have
regard
to
the
Charleton
ruling
,
we
be
put
ourselves
in
a
position
in
which
there
will
be
no
doubt
as
to
whether
we
will
be
compliant
with
EU
law
.
no
.
I
draw
attention
to
the
circumstance
that
would
obtain
if
we
be
not
a
party
to
the
EMI
and
other
v.
UPC
case
.
it
could
be
state
that
,
under
the
copyright
Act
2000
,
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
over
a
infringement
already
exist
.
we
be
merely
restate
that
position
.
the
reason
for
much
of
the
controversy
on
this
stem
from
the
fact
that
this
issue
have
be
arise
for
well
over
a
year
,
bear
in
mind
the
Charleton
judgment
be
in
2010
.
the
new
government
instigate
a
review
and
engage
in
consultation
.
person
be
accuse
we
of
not
consult
but
we
have
a
consultation
period
.
I
make
it
clear
to
people
that
I
be
open
to
discussion
with
all
stakeholder
on
this
issue
.
as
late
as
last
Thursday
,
I
meet
the
Irish
Internet
Association
and
have
further
discussion
with
it
.
we
be
not
try
to
impose
something
.
if
we
be
to
legislate
from
a
primary
perspective
in
regard
to
the
Internet
,
we
would
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
we
would
do
that
give
there
be
so
many
disparate
community
within
the
web
space
as
well
as
the
copyright
holder
.
my
prefer
option
,
give
the
EU
be
now
look
at
the
copyright
or
e-commerce
directive
,
be
that
the
community
would
start
talk
across
the
various
and
disparate
grouping
,
such
as
the
hoster
,
the
isp
,
the
software
developer
,
the
copyright
holder
and
so
on
.
it
be
important
that
this
community
start
to
consult
with
the
various
stakeholder
within
the
community
to
begin
the
process
of
come
up
with
a
strategic
view
as
to
how
we
can
either
legislate
primarily
or
put
in
place
voluntary
agreement
.
my
prefer
option
be
for
voluntary
agreement
because
assume
all
stakeholder
come
to
the
table
honestly
and
openly
,
this
ensure
that
if
primary
legislation
be
implement
it
do
not
become
outmoded
or
outdated
as
soon
as
it
be
enact
by
virtue
of
further
innovation
within
the
web
.
what
we
be
do
here
be
merely
restate
a
position
which
we
hold
to
have
already
exist
,
namely
,
uphold
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
while
have
regard
to
the
balance
of
rights
in
that
respect
.
I
do
not
believe
primary
legislation
be
require
at
this
stage
.
the
technical
Group
have
put
forward
a
proposal
for
a
statutory
instrument
.
if
time
allow
and
bear
in
mind
there
be
more
question
to
follow
,
I
would
like
to
answer
the
individual
point
the
technical
Group
have
make
give
it
have
put
forward
a
honest
and
open
solution
to
this
issue
.
while
I
have
only
have
a
brief
few
hour
to
analyse
it
,
since
it
be
submit
today
at
12.45
p.m.
,
there
be
some
issue
within
it
which
I
would
like
to
address
because
I
consider
it
a
honest
effort
to
address
the
issue
at
hand
.
on
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
's
point
,
Ireland
have
the
concept
of
the
take
-
down
notice
.
I
use
www.boards.ie
and
there
be
other
example
with
which
we
be
all
familiar
,
such
as
YouTube
.
if
a
person
become
a
member
of
www.boards.ie,
the
presumption
be
that
the
person
have
sign
up
to
a
set
of
behavioural
protocol
by
which
he
or
she
will
abide
,
and
will
not
say
anything
defamatory
or
do
anything
that
be
in
breach
of
copyright
,
as
a
individual
user
.
if
the
person
do
that
,
there
be
a
mechanism
so
that
,
through
its
own
monitoring
mechanism
,
www.boards.ie
can
expel
a
errant
user
or
somebody
who
be
,
if
I
may
use
the
term
,
act
the
maggot
.
therefore
,
this
already
exist
as
a
voluntary
code
deal
with
behaviour
.
if
,
however
,
we
begin
legislate
in
a
proscriptive
way
for
every
single
behaviour
on
the
Internet
,
we
will
be
go
down
a
very
narrow
funnel
.
as
I
have
state
and
to
answer
deputy
O'Dea
's
question
,
the
informal
competitiveness
council
be
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
set
of
action
in
regard
to
the
issue
we
be
talk
about
,
which
be
the
correct
approach
.
however
,
the
reason
we
have
have
to
implement
the
statutory
instrument
,
as
the
deputy
will
appreciate
give
he
be
a
member
of
the
last
government
,
be
that
this
have
be
ongoing
for
a
considerable
period
and
the
State
be
potentially
expose
to
be
sue
by
various
entity
.
I
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
it
be
taxpayer
's
money
which
be
potentially
in
question
.
the
point
be
that
I
do
not
believe
a
Irish
judge
,
if
he
or
she
be
have
regard
to
the
e-commerce
directive
,
will
not
also
have
regard
to
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
,
which
have
come
into
operation
and
be
the
legal
entity
,
and
also
the
SABAM
ruling
.
I
do
not
believe
any
Irish
judge
would
not
adhere
to
the
principle
of
proportionality
in
this
sense
.
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
take
-
down
notice
,
if
a
hoster
decide
it
be
not
go
to
take
down
the
content
follow
a
take
-
down
notice
on
the
assumption
that
this
take
-
down
notice
be
on
foot
of
a
real
breach
of
copyright
,
perhaps
it
be
then
open
for
the
person
against
whom
the
infringement
occur
to
seek
the
injunction
.
what
we
want
to
do
be
to
get
into
a
space
in
this
country
where
the
system
operate
on
a
voluntary
basis
,
with
clear
protocol
.
to
be
fair
,
the
music
industry
need
to
adopt
new
model
and
need
to
begin
to
get
its
music
on
to
more
platform
,
as
note
by
deputy
O'Dea
,
and
need
to
begin
find
new
mechanism
for
sell
its
music
.
already
,
Netflix
be
come
on
stream
,
which
will
also
give
rise
to
issue
.
the
more
content
that
be
legally
available
through
a
multitude
of
mechanism
,
the
more
likely
it
be
we
will
encounter
copyright
theft
and
piracy
issue
.
that
be
where
we
want
to
get
to
.
however
,
I
do
not
believe
the
State
should
be
too
prescriptive
about
how
we
get
to
that
point
.
I
would
like
to
see
the
community
come
together
on
that
issue
.
I
refer
to
deputy
Ferris
's
point
.
person
be
interpret
this
as
we
do
the
bid
of
the
large
corporation
.
this
be
not
the
stop
on
-
line
piracy
act
,
SOPA
.
we
be
not
extend
massive
power
of
intervention
so
that
we
can
step
into
the
breach
to
try
to
protect
one
side
over
another
.
this
be
not
SOPA
legislation
.
this
be
balancing
the
right
of
a
copyright
holder
against
the
right
of
a
individual
.
there
be
inherent
rights
in
the
charter
of
fundamental
rights
and
in
the
e-commerce
directive
which
give
rights
to
the
individual
company
to
conduct
its
business
.
we
must
also
have
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
copyright
holder
,
which
could
be
a
small
publishing
house
.
person
perceive
the
copyright
holder
to
be
"
big
music
"
but
it
could
be
a
small
internet
publishing
business
,
a
person
create
he
or
she
own
music
at
home
.
they
have
copyright
and
certain
protection
.
I
do
not
believe
this
measure
will
be
use
by
big
business
as
a
tool
to
beat
down
website
.
Google
be
one
of
the
big
corporation
in
the
world
and
it
have
a
right
to
do
business
here
if
it
have
a
Irish
or
European
Union
domain
.
that
rights
be
protect
but
be
not
subservient
to
the
right
of
the
copyright
holder
.
I
take
the
deputy
up
on
a
point
he
make
about
the
statutory
instrument
.
he
be
infinitely
more
experienced
than
I
be
,
as
a
legislator
,
and
he
will
appreciate
that
this
be
not
new
policy
and
therefore
a
statutory
instrument
can
apply
.
we
be
not
at
odd
with
the
programme
for
government
in
this
because
we
be
only
amend
legislation
.
I
reply
respectfully
to
the
deputy
in
that
regard
.
this
be
a
balancing
between
the
two
.
the
small
guy
or
girl
who
begin
with
the
gaming
industry
have
certain
rights
as
copyright
holder
and
we
must
protect
they
as
much
as
we
must
protect
the
citizen
's
right
to
access
the
Internet
.
proportionality
be
the
key
to
this
debate
.
at
this
point
,
I
will
address
the
point
submit
by
the
technical
Group
in
regard
to
the
statutory
instrument
.
I
will
briefly
give
my
analysis
of
they
.
there
be
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
two
statutory
instrument
.
I
respect
the
point
make
.
we
be
not
set
out
a
new
policy
framework
but
clarify
legislation
through
a
amendment
to
the
copyright
act
.
we
be
go
back
to
the
position
prior
to
the
EMI
v.
UPC
case
where
the
right
to
seek
a
injunction
by
a
copyright
holder
be
there
.
I
note
the
technical
Group
's
alternative
clause
propose
the
statutory
instrument
be
of
two
-
year
duration
.
we
have
to
monitor
event
,
however
,
in
the
intervene
two
year
and
move
quickly
if
essential
balance
be
not
maintain
.
that
would
be
imped
by
a
two
-
year
clause
.
on
the
technical
Group
's
paragraph
c
,
my
propose
statutory
instrument
already
include
a
provision
that
the
court
will
have
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
any
person
affect
by
virtue
of
the
grant
of
any
such
injunction
and
the
court
will
give
such
direction
,
include
where
appropriate
a
direction
require
a
person
to
be
notify
of
the
application
.
this
cover
the
technical
Group
's
point
and
to
we
mind
it
would
be
the
action
of
a
prudent
judge
.
on
paragraph
would
,
the
remedy
of
damage
will
not
be
available
against
a
intermediary
provide
it
abide
by
the
e-commerce
directive
.
again
,
the
e-commerce
directive
have
certain
rights
which
protect
the
business
.
give
the
wide
variety
of
circumstance
that
may
prevail
,
it
be
feel
the
good
approach
be
to
have
the
matter
deal
with
case
by
case
through
a
judicial
process
which
must
balance
all
the
rights
involve
.
protection
be
already
in
place
under
European
law
.
the
European
Court
of
Justice
require
all
remedy
must
be
proportionate
while
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression
and
to
conduct
a
business
must
be
balance
with
the
right
to
intellectual
property
in
consider
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
provide
in
law
for
the
protection
of
personal
datum
,
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
,
the
right
to
property
and
consumer
protection
.
on
paragraph
email
,
one
cannot
predict
future
circumstance
.
that
be
why
we
again
feel
the
good
approach
be
to
deal
with
the
matter
case
by
case
through
the
judicial
process
.
many
rights
be
involved
in
this
paragraph
such
as
the
right
to
copyright
and
to
intellectual
property
in
general
.
the
first
matter
to
be
consider
be
to
establish
if
there
be
a
infringement
.
if
lawful
content
be
also
include
,
the
right
of
make
available
by
the
owner
of
the
lawful
content
have
to
be
consider
.
the
rights
of
the
citizen
,
consumer
and
end
-
user
in
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
must
also
be
take
into
account
.
the
right
to
datum
protection
must
come
into
the
mix
on
the
point
make
by
the
technical
Group
.
the
right
of
the
Internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
to
conduct
a
business
and
all
that
it
entail
must
also
be
upheld
.
for
the
purpose
of
clarity
,
the
technical
Group
submit
a
alternative
statutory
instrument
,
and
I
be
address
specific
point
in
it
.
on
paragraph
f
and
gram
of
the
technical
Group
's
submission
concern
injunction
,
this
matter
be
already
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
.
EU
law
have
hold
any
measure
must
be
fair
and
proportionate
and
not
excessively
costly
.
yet
again
,
give
the
vary
circumstance
that
could
arise
,
we
feel
a
case
-
by
-
case
analysis
and
the
balancing
of
rights
and
consideration
of
all
matter
by
judicial
process
be
the
proper
forum
for
such
decision
.
on
deputy
Keating
's
point
about
publicise
this
,
I
want
to
reiterate
we
have
a
open
consultation
on
it
.
I
state
on
the
record
I
be
available
to
meet
anybody
.
I
have
send
out
three
communication
to
all
deputy
,
across
all
party
,
and
Senator
on
this
issue
so
far
.
I
have
engage
with
the
media
in
as
open
a
fashion
as
possible
.
I
be
willing
to
talk
to
people
and
be
make
myself
available
to
the
Internet
community
to
talk
to
it
on
this
.
on
deputy
Buttimer
's
point
about
the
implication
of
this
amendment
,
I
reiterate
this
be
about
balancing
the
rights
of
Internet
user
,
internet
business
and
the
copyright
holder
.
the
isp
,
as
I
outline
early
,
be
the
mere
conduit
,
the
mechanism
through
which
information
flow
.
they
act
responsibly
,
as
do
individual
website
,
and
in
the
majority
of
case
do
not
overtly
seek
to
facilitate
copyright
theft
.
a
solution
to
the
problem
might
be
voluntary
agreement
in
place
between
copyright
holder
and
individual
isp
,
hoster
and
caching
company
.
I
do
not
believe
we
be
do
the
bid
of
big
business
because
there
be
as
many
-
a
multitude
of
-
small
Irish
copyright
holder
on
this
island
who
have
the
right
to
certain
protection
which
be
not
superior
to
the
other
rights
I
have
outline
prior
to
this
.
I
thank
deputy
for
a
consider
and
thoughtful
debate
.
we
key
belief
be
that
we
cannot
trample
on
the
rights
of
individual
citizen
or
business
.
we
be
try
to
uphold
that
belief
and
all
we
be
do
with
this
amending
legislation
be
ensure
we
be
on
the
right
side
of
EU
law
.
copyright
be
a
principle
to
which
this
state
adhere
but
I
reiterate
it
be
not
a
superior
right
for
the
purpose
of
this
statutory
instrument
.
I
disagree
with
deputy
Donnelly
's
contention
.
the
mechanism
by
which
www.boards.ie
operate
be
such
that
if
member
do
anything
untoward
,
a
take
down
notice
can
be
issue
to
the
website
.
I
be
sure
www.boards.ie
comply
with
take
down
notice
where
illegal
activity
or
defamatory
comment
be
suspect
.
why
would
that
threaten
its
core
business
?
I
listen
to
the
deputy
.
person
speak
about
the
cost
of
defence
.
just
because
one
apply
for
a
injunction
,
the
judge
will
not
necessarily
grant
it
.
we
must
have
regard
for
the
rights
of
individual
company
to
conduct
they
business
and
for
citizen
to
express
themselves
freely
.
nobody
be
trample
on
that
rights
.
this
statutory
instrument
restate
a
position
which
we
already
hold
prior
to
the
Charleton
judgment
.
it
be
important
that
all
the
stakeholder
sit
down
with
each
other
to
chart
a
strategy
on
how
this
space
will
operate
in
the
future
.
in
the
context
of
the
disparate
nature
of
the
user
and
business
that
operate
in
this
space
,
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
chart
a
way
forward
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
make
myself
available
to
facilitate
that
process
.
as
recently
as
this
morning
,
there
be
engagement
with
the
Internet
community
through
the
Irish
Internet
Association
as
one
of
the
stakeholder
.
we
be
open
to
that
discussion
.
in
regard
to
sign
the
statutory
instrument
,
I
have
address
the
issue
raise
by
the
technical
Group
.
I
have
already
state
that
it
be
we
intention
to
proceed
with
the
statutory
instrument
.
the
State
have
be
expose
on
this
issue
,
which
have
be
ongoing
since
November
2010
,
and
what
we
be
do
be
a
proportionate
response
.
we
will
not
infringe
on
anybody
's
right
to
conduct
a
business
or
to
free
expression
through
the
Internet
.
in
regard
to
the
alternative
statutory
instrument
propose
by
T.J.
McIntyre
,
I
have
debate
the
issue
with
he
in
public
media
and
I
be
not
averse
to
engage
with
the
digital
rights
community
with
a
view
to
hammer
out
a
strategy
.
however
,
we
have
to
implement
the
statutory
implement
and
we
be
do
so
on
foot
of
advice
from
two
Attorneys
General
.
I
have
to
take
account
of
the
sound
advice
give
by
a
Attorney
General
.
this
legislative
measure
be
be
introduce
on
foot
of
the
legal
advice
my
Department
have
obtain
.
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
be
ask
by
my
Department
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
for
advice
on
the
implication
of
the
high
court
judgment
and
it
have
advise
that
the
obligation
set
out
in
the
directive
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
rights
holder
must
be
give
a
mechanism
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
where
they
intellectual
property
rights
be
be
breach
.
the
Attorney
General
's
office
advise
separately
that
the
prudent
course
be
to
introduce
a
regulation
to
ensure
compliance
.
that
be
merely
what
we
be
do
.
I
thank
all
who
contribute
to
this
debate
and
reassure
citizen
that
this
State
and
successive
government
have
invest
heavily
in
new
technology
related
to
the
web
and
communication
.
if
I
may
be
allow
to
finish
off
-----
with
all
due
respect
to
the
Member
opposite
,
I
have
take
on
board
the
point
they
have
make
and
address
they
individually
.
I
respectfully
suggest
they
should
defer
to
they
legal
adviser
.
I
will
also
defer
to
they
legal
adviser
on
this
so
that
we
can
have
a
strategic
conversation
about
how
the
future
of
the
web
operate
in
the
State
,
but
we
be
not
change
the
wording
of
the
statutory
instrument
.
I
remind
deputy
Donnelly
that
I
have
state
that
on
numerous
occasion
,
with
all
due
respect
.
if
I
may
-----
some
background
information
may
be
useful
in
appreciate
the
context
of
the
propose
legislative
instrument
.
the
EU
provide
in
the
e-commerce
directive
2000/31
/
ec
for
exemption
from
liability
for
copyright
infringement
for
intermediary
service
provider
in
case
of
mere
conduit
,
caching
and
host
,
upon
certain
condition
.
this
be
to
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
e-commerce
and
telecommunication
industry
.
although
such
provider
be
thus
free
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
EU
copyright
directive
2001
/
29
/
ec
(
as
allow
for
in
the
e-Commerce
directive
)
provide
that
rights
holder
must
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
a
high
court
judgment
have
hold
that
,
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
suggest
that
Ireland
do
not
comply
with
EU
law
.
as
you
will
appreciate
,
for
a
member
of
the
European
Union
,
non-compliance
with
EU
law
be
a
very
serious
matter
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
it
have
be
decide
to
introduce
a
Statutory
instrument
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
this
judgment
.
in
grant
such
injunction
the
court
must
take
account
of
various
judgment
of
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
.
EU
law
have
hold
that
copyright
be
not
a
absolute
right
but
must
be
balance
with
other
rights
protect
by
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
.
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
,
on
24
November
2011
,
clearly
lay
out
this
principle
that
will
guide
all
national
court
in
future
(
Case
C-70/10
-
SABAM
)
.
this
require
that
a
fair
balance
be
strike
between
the
various
fundamental
rights
protect
by
the
community
legal
order
and
the
principle
of
proportionality
.
that
would
include
,
inter
alia
,
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
individual
who
be
affect
by
such
measure
,
the
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
Internet
Service
Provider
,
the
protection
of
private
datum
and
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
information
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
281
and
291
together
.
in
relation
to
the
scenario
the
deputy
have
outline
,
it
be
important
to
mention
that
copyright
holder
will
not
have
power
to
compel
the
intermediary
as
state
.
the
copyright
owner
will
have
the
right
to
apply
to
the
high
court
for
a
injunction
against
a
intermediary
in
respect
of
work
in
which
he
hold
the
copyright
.
the
propose
statutory
instrument
allow
for
the
possibility
of
apply
for
a
injunction
only
in
respect
of
a
particular
work
.
this
would
have
to
be
consider
by
a
court
in
its
deliberation
on
the
granting
of
a
injunction
against
a
intermediary
.
furthermore
,
all
remedy
contemplate
must
be
proportionate
,
as
require
by
the
copyright
directive
,
and
take
into
account
the
various
judgment
of
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
in
this
area
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
follow
the
adoption
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
,
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
apply
to
the
court
when
implement
EU
law
.
this
mean
that
in
consider
the
grant
of
a
injunction
,
a
court
must
balance
the
intellectual
property
right
with
the
other
fundamental
rights
guarantee
by
the
Charter
,
include
:
protection
of
personal
datum
,
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
and
right
to
property
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
requirement
be
legislate
for
be
to
ensure
that
right
holder
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for

it
be
not
a
matter
of
believe
or

piracy
or
simply
host
copyright
material
.
it
must
be
show
that
the
service
in
question
be
use
to
infringe
copyright
.
the
legislation
propose
be
a
restatement
of
the
situation
that
be
think
to
pertain
prior
to
the
EMI
&
onsoger
v
UPC
judgment
in

2010

a

it
be

until

case
.
this
be
necessary
to
ensure
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
this
directive
and
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
require
that
all
remedy
must
be
proportionate
and
that
the
right
of
freedom
of
expression
and
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
must
be
balance
with
the
right
to
intellectual
property
in
consider
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
since
the
adoption
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
,
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
must
apply
when
implement
EU
law
.
this
mean
that
in
consider
the
grant
of
a
injunction
,
a
court
must
balance
the
intellectual
property
right
with
the
other
fundamental
rights
guarantee
by
the
Charter
which
include
:
protection
of
personal
datum
,
freedom
of

and
information
,
freedom
to
conduct

,
right
to

and
consumer
protection
.
the
Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade
agreement
,
ACTA
,
to
which
the
deputy
be
refer
,
be
a
international
legal
framework
to
more
effectively
combat
the
proliferation
of
counterfeit
and
pirated
goods
.
as
you
be
aware
,
counterfeiting
and
piracy
be
now
serious
problem
which
undermine
legitimate
trade
and
the
sustainable
development
of
the
world
economy
.
the
growth
of
this
illegal
trade
have
lead
the
ACTA
participant
to
agree
to
develop
a
instrument
that
will
strengthen
international
co-operation
regard
this
serious
development
.
ACTA
be
a
agreement
about
the
enforcement
of
intellectual
property
rights
.
it
do
not
oblige
any
of
its
EU
signatory
to
create
new
substantive
rights
or
to
change
exist
one
.
it
only
commit
its
EU
signatory
to
ensure
that
the
right
holder
can
fully
assert
they
rights
if
,
when
and
where
they
exist
.
the
ACTA
provision
be
compatible
with
exist
EU
law
.
therefore
,
it
will
not
require
any
revision
or
adaptation
of
EU
law
and
will
not
require
any
Member
State
to
review
the
measure
or
instrument
by
which
they
implement
relevant
EU
law
.
my
Department
have
consult
the
relevant
Department
affect
by
ACTA
and
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
to
ascertain
compliance
of
Irish
legislation
with
the
provision
of
ACTA
.
it
be
not
expect
that
there
will
be
a
need
to
amend
current
Irish
legislation
.
however
,
before
ratify
ACTA
,
my
Department
will
again
confirm
with
all
relevant
Department
of
State
and

as
the
deputy
be
aware
the
judgment
of
the
high
Court
in
the
case
of
EMI
&
onsoger
v
UPC
hold
that
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
that
Ireland
do
not
comply
with
EU
law
.
as
you
will
appreciate
,
non-compliance
with
EU
law
be
a
very
serious
matter
.
follow
a
public
consultation
process
which
be
conduct
by
my
Department
,
and
take
all
matter
into
account
,
include
the
opinion
of
the
Attorney
General
,
it
be
feel
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
restatement
of
the
situation
which
be
consider
to
pertain
in
Irish
law
in
relation
to
injunction
against
intermediary
prior
to
the
judgment
in
the
EMI
&
onsoger
v
UPC
case
.
this
be
necessary
to
ensure
Ireland
's
compliance
with
the
EU
copyright
directive
.
it
be
for
this
reason
that
a
legislative
instrument
be
propose
.
I
wish
to
state
that
no
policy
change
be
propose
in
the
Statutory
Instrument
as
it
have
be
the
intention
of
the
copyright
and
related
rights
act
to
provide
such
civil
remedy
and
it
have
be
assume
that
such
be
the
case
up
to
the
high
court
judgment
in
EMI
Ireland
&
other
versus
UPC
.
accordingly
,
the
wording
of
the
propose
Statutory
instrument
have
be
frame
in
a
manner
which
merely
give
effect
to
the
wording
of
the
EU
copyright
Directive
(
i.e.
article
8
(
3
)
of
2001/29
/
ec
)
rather
than
extend
its
scope
beyond
that
of
intermediary
.
the
intend
purpose
of
the
propose
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
to
enact
new
EU
legislation
but
rather
it
seek
to
merely
restate
the
position
that
be
think
to
exist
in
the
copyright
legislation
prior
to
justice
Charleton
's
judgment
here
and
in
all
EU
Member
State
.
accordingly
,
the
introduction
of
this
measure
by
way
of
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
policy
outline
in
the
Programme
for
government
.
some
background
information
may
be
useful
in
appreciate
the
context
of
the
propose
legislative
instrument
.
the
EU
provide
in
the
e-commerce
directive
2000/31
/
ec
for
exemption
from
liability
for
copyright
infringement
for
intermediary
service
provider
in
case
of
mere
conduit
,
caching
and
host
,
upon
certain
condition
.
this
be
to
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
e-commerce
and
telecommunication
industry
.
although
such
provider
be
thus
free
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
EU
copyright
directive
2001
/
29
/
ec
(
as
allow
for
in
the
e-Commerce
directive
)
provide
that
rights
holder
must
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
the

judgment
(
in

that
by

.

Department
have

(
4
)
of
the

Act
and
the
inherent
power
of
the

to
grant

,
which
be
equitable
and
discretionary
remedy
,
grant
accord
to
settle
principle
,
develop
by
the
court
.
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
,
it
have
decide
to
introduce
a
Statutory
instrument
to
restate
the
position
that
be
consider
to
pertain
prior
to
this
judgment
.

I

out

301
answer
on

last
.
Contrary
to
the
deputy
's
suggestion
,
I
understand
from
Iarnród
Éireann
,
that
rail
freight
be
in
fact
a
grow
part
of
its
business
.
I
have
refer
the
deputy
's
question
to
the
company
for
direct
reply
.
please
inform
my
private
office
if
you
do
not
receive
a
reply
within
10
working
day
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
he
have
speak
about
a
specific
area
in
County
Donegal
.
the
broad
school
transport
scheme
be
a
significant
operation
manage
by
Bus
Éireann
on
behalf
of
the
Department
.
it
transport
113000
child
,
include
more
than
8,000
with
special
need
,
and
4000
vehicle
be
use
daily
.
it
have
be
in
operation
for
more
than
40
year
.
for
the
purpose
of
reply
to
the
deputy
,
the
definition
of
school
transport
catchment
boundary
have
be
the
subject
of
many
submission
and
representation
to
the
Department
during
the
year
.
it
be
widely
consider
by
many
that
the
current
catchment
boundary
area
do
not
reflect
change
demographic
.
change
to
the
post
-
primary
school
transport
scheme
be
announce
in
budget
2011
.
one
of
this
change
which
will
take
effect
from
the
commencement
of
the
2012
-
13
school
year
mean
that
the
use
of
the
catchment
area
system
as
a
means
of
determine
eligibility
will
cease
for
all
pupil
enter
a
post
-
primary
school
as
first
entrant
.
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
be
that
this
create
the
potential
to
split
family
.
by
way
of
provide
assistance
and
acknowledge
County
Donegal
as
a
peripheral
location
,
I
suggest
the
deputy
either
make
direct
representation
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Cannon
,
who
have
responsibility
for
school
transport
or
contact
the
school
transport
section
of
the
Department
.
I
acknowledge
there
will
be
anomaly
under
the
scheme
.
on
the
budgetary
provision
,
there
be
no
two
way
about
it
,
a
budgetary
save
will
be
make
,
but
if
it
can
be
do
in
a
way
that
try
to
apply
the
principle
of
common
sense
and
weed
out
anomaly
so
as
to
avoid
the
split
of
family
member
and
if
a
special
case
can
be
make
for
the
region
to
which
the
deputy
refer
,
my
respectful
suggestion
to
he
be
to
make
representation
to
the
minister
.
a
recent
survey
show
that
82
%
of
pupil
attend
they
near
post
-
primary
school
.
I
agree
that
there
can
be
anomaly
in
the
system
which
have
be
well
document
by
the
deputy
.
I
will
speak
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Cannon
,
about
the
matter
.
I
also
advise
the
deputy
to
make
representation
to
the
school
transport
section
of
the
Department
.
since
my
appointment
in
March
2011
,
the
Taxi

Review
Steering
Group

be
set
up
under

Alan
Kelly
.
that
group
have
now

it
be
therefore
no
long

.
I
be
actively

the
rationalisation
programme
set
out

the
Public
Service
Reform

the
relevant

.
the
plan

be

of
other

be

publication
which
I
launch
in

2011
,
be
that

.
the
European

,
give
the

would
be

the

act
as
a
single
point

Ireland
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to

give
that
,
primarily
through

each

the

to
pertain

in

,
prior

.
this
judgment
also
state
that
Ireland
be
not
in
compliance
with
its
obligation
under

.
several
concern
be
express
after
the
judgment
by
interested
party
.
accordingly
a
public
consultation
be
hold
on
the
wording
of
the

this

be
widely
publicise
at

be

I
be
extremely
grateful
to
that
interested

,
group

individual
who
respond

they
submission
have
prove
very
valuable
in
provide
a
comprehensive
understanding

the
differ
view
on
the
many
issue
involve
.
there
be
also
liaison
with
the
Office

the

and
the

of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
.
the
submission
be
carefully
consider
and
legal
opinion
contain
therein
be
refer
to
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
.
I
also
meet
with
several
organisation
with
specific
interest
.
the
matter
be
debate
in
the
dáil
on
31st
January
2012
.
I
make
it
clear
then
that
any
injunction
under
the
propose
amendment
of
the
copyright
Act
2000
would
have
to
be
consider
in
the
context
of
the
pronouncement
of
the
Court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
in
judgment
connect
with
this
area
.
this
judgment
(
particularly
Sabam
v
Scarlet
and
Sabam
v
Netlog
)
hold
that
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
right
to
intellectual
property
must
be
balance
against
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
other
who
would
be
affect
by
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
this
rights
include
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
,
to
privacy
,
to
freedom
to
receive
and
impart
information
.
in
addition
,
any
measure
propose
should
not
be
unnecessarily
complicated
or
costly
.
since
the
Lisbon
Treaty
,
any
legislation
uphold
EU
law
be
bind
by
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Right
of
the
European
Union
.
as
the
nature
of
injunction
which
may
be
seek
be
infinitely
varied
,
I
consider
that
the
good
protection
for
balancing
all
the
rights
involved
will
be
obtain
by
a
careful
scrutiny
on
a
case

I
will

the
propose
statutory
instrument
be
intend
to
ensure
the
return
to
the
legal
position
that
be
consider
to
pertain
,
in
relation
to
injunction
against
intermediary
,
prior
to
a
high
court
judgment
in
October
2010
.
this
judgment
also
state
that
Ireland
be
not
in
compliance
with
its
EU
obligation
under
copyright
Directive
2001
/
29
/
EC
.
the
wording
of
the
propose
statutory
instrument
only
allow
a
right
holder
to
apply
for
a
injunction
in
respect
of
a
particular
work
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
requirement
be
legislate
for
be
to
ensure
that
right
holder
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
a
injunction
against
intermediary
whose
service
be
use
by
a
third
party
to
infringe
a
copyright
or
related
right
.
it
should
be
note
that
the
EU
copyright
directive
only
direct
that
a
injunction
may
be
apply
for
—
it
do
not
mandate
that
it
should
be
grant
.
it
be
also
important
to
note
that
the
granting
of
injunction
be
not
a
automatic
procedure
.
injuncion
involve
a
judicial
process
before
the
high
Court
.
copyright
must
be
balance
in
that
process
by
a
consideration
of
the
other
rights
involve
,
e.g.
protection
of
private
datum
,
freedom
of
expression
and
information
,
the
right
to
conduct
a
business
.
any
remedy
must
be
proportionate
.
this
be
also
speel
out
in
the
draft
Statutory
instrument
when
it
be
explicitly
lay
down
that
the
rights
of
any
person
(
include
business
)
likely
to
be
affect
,
must
be
give
due
regard
when
the
court
be
deliberate
on
the
granting
of
a
injunction
.
in
other
word
,
before
grant
any
such
injunction
,
a
court
will
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
block
access
to
a
website
could
involve
damage
to
the
owner
of
the
legal
content
on
that
website
.
the
court
must
ensure
any
remedy
be
not
contrary
to
the
right
of
information
or
freedom
of
expression
and
that
any
measure
propose
should
not
be
unnecessarily
complicated
or
costly
.
any
injunction
under
the
propose
amendment
of
the
copyright
Act
2000
would
have
to
be
consider
in
the
context
of

available

and
Skill
.
this
initiative
will
impact
positively
on
all
region
of
the
country
.
I
take
the
point
the
deputy
be
raise
.
we
be
be
imaginative
in
ensure
there
be
a
micro-
finance
fund
for
small
business
.
the
new
partial
credit
guarantee
scheme
be
design
to
help
the
SME
sector
.
if
one
talk
about
the
direct
subsidisation
of
a
business
-
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
on
the
encouragement
or
retention
of
employment
within
exist
business
-
one
must
be
mindful
of
the
consequence
.
where
there
be
two
company
trade
in
the
same
sector
,
one
thriving
and
the
other
not
,
and
one
support
directly
the
one
that
be
not
thriving
,
one
must
realise
there
be
permutation
regard
State
aid
rule
on
direct
subsidisation
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
seek
to
create
the
type
of
programme
to
which
all
business
will
be
able
to
subscribe
,
such
that
we
can
try
to
retain
employment
.
in
the
two
type
of
business
to
which
the
deputy
allude
,
the
phenomenon
he
describe
could
be
see
a
consequence
of
a
direct
drop
in
consumer
demand
,
which
be
have
a
major
impact
.
we
must
also
factor
that
into
the
equation
.
the
deputy
's
point
be
well
make
but
we
be
try
to
address
the
problem
through
programme
support
and
direct
-
credit
support
for
company
that
be
thriving
and
will
survive
.
to
be
fair
and
objective
about
this
,
we
be
think
outside
the
box
.
research
and
development
tax
credit
will
encourage
great
business
growth
.
the
Revenue
job
assist
scheme
will
also
help
,
while
PRSI
programme
entice
employer
to
retain
employee
and
there
be
a
tax
break
for
that
purpose
.
on
the
demand
and
supply
side
we
be
try
to
encourage
company
to
retain
people
in
job
.
it
be
a
extremely
difficult
thing
to
do
because
one
must
adhere
to
State
-
aid
rule
in
do
so
.
we
have
be
imaginative
in
try
to
get
people
back
into
the
work
force
through
labour
market
activation
measure
,
include
the
pathway
to
work
scheme
.
we
will
stay
on
that
course
.
the
essential
point
in
the
deputy
's
question
concern
a
direct
subsidy
to
individual
business
.
we
be
try
to
take
a
more
imaginative
view
on
that
by
put
in
place
the
temporary
credit
guarantee
scheme
and
the
micro-
finance
fund
.
in
addition
,
we
be
encourage
employer
through
tax
break
and
prsi
credit
.
that
be
the
way
to
stimulate
growth

EU

also
provide
through

which
run
from

unlike

funding
under

not

almost

of

truthfully
,
it
be
not
possible
to
say
how
many
job
have
be
create
as
a
result
of
this
programme
.
it
be
important
to
note
the
number
of
successful
application
in
the
SME
sector
be
over
1000
while
in
the
multinational
sector
,
it
be
270
.
in
the
SME
sector
,
we
have
take
in
over
€
66
million
in
funding
with
€
21
million
in
the
multinational
sector
.
while
it
do
not
answer
the
deputy
's
question
directly
,
it
do
signify
the
scheme
be
support
exist
job
.
the
criterion
set
down
for
adherence
to
the
programme
be
one
of
excellence
in
term
of
the
research
industry
and
academic
collaboration
.
the
key
message
in
my
reply
be
that
if
we
hit
the
€600
million
target
for
the
current
framework
programme
,
it
would
be
a
extremely
good
result
.
move
into
the
new
framework
programme
for
2020
which
have
a
potential
pot
of
€
85
billion
,
I
be
ambitious
for
this
country
that
we
would
hit
or
surpass
the
€600
million
target
.
that
will
benefit
exist
employment
and
create
further
job

the

regulation
2012
have
today
be
sign
and
simultaneously
I
have
launch
the
next
stage
of
the
copyright
Review
Committee
review
of
Ireland
's
copyright
legislation
,
aim
at
remove
barrier
to
innovation
.
I
acknowledge
the
desire
of
some
interested
party
that
this
instrument
be
more
detailed
and
more
prescriptive
.
however
the
high
Court
now
have
significant
guidance
from
the
European
Court
of
Justice
on
the
implementation
of
the
measure
,
and
will
have
to
ensure
any
remedy
provide
will
uphold
the
follow
principle
:
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
isp
;
the
absolute
requirement
that
a
isp
cannot
be
require
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
on
the
information
it
carry
on
its
network
;
any
measure
must
be
fair
and
proportionate
and
not
be
unnecessarily
complicated
or
costly
;
the
fundamental
rights
of
a
isp
's
customer
must
be
respect
,
namely
they
right
to
protection
of
they
personal
datum
and
they
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
.
I
believe
that
in
Ireland
we
must
build
on
we
very
substantial
achievement
in
the
creative
and
digital
media
industry
,
and
become
a
model
of
international
good
practice
for
innovation
in
this
area
.
Ireland
be
home
to
some
of
the
world
's
most
innovative
internet
company
,
and
we
be
determined
to
grow
we
reputation
as
a
location
where
smart
people
and
smart
company
can
innovate
in
this
fast
-
move
arena
.
it
be
necessary
for
we
to
proceed
to
sign
this
Statutory
instrument
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with
we
obligation
under
EU
law
.
the
intend
purpose
of
the
propose
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
to
enact
new
EU
legislation
but
rather
it
seek
to
merely
restate
the
position
that
be
think
to
exist
within
the
copyright
legislation
prior
to
justice
Charleton
's
judgement
here
and
in
all
EU
Member
State
.
accordingly
,
I
be
satisfied
that
the
introduction
of
this
measure
by
way
of
Statutory
Instrument
be
not
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
policy
outline
in
the
Programme
for
government
.
as
there
be
clearly
many
diverse
interest
,
it
be
important
that
interested
party
come
together
and
work
in
a
constructive
way
to
map
the
path
forward
.
for
this
reason
I
be
particularly
anxious
that
the
consultation
paper
launch
today
be
study
and
comprehensively
respond
to
by
all
interested
party
.
the
challenge
now
be
to
examine
what
measure
we
can
take
to
develop
Ireland
's
law
in
this
area
in
such
a
way
as
to
provide
the
great
possible
encouragement
for
innovation
in
the
creative
and
digital
industry
to
take
place
here
.
this
be
a
very
complex
area
of
law
,
which
affect
industry
that
be
develop
rapidly
and
where
the
interest
of
many
diverse
and
change
party
interact
with
each
other
.
my
ambition
to
make
Ireland
a
model
of
international
good
practice
in
this
area
will
not
be
easily
achieve
,
and
as
this
debate
develop
I
urge
all
interested
party
on
all
side
to
come
together
and
work
in
a
constructive
and
realistic
way
to
the
benefit
of
all
.
in
that
context
,
I
be
commit
to
review
and
update
the
copyright
legislation
currently
in
place
in
order
to
strike
the
correct
balance
between
encourage
innovation
and
protect
creativity
.
this
paper
have
be
prepare
by
the
copyright
Review
Committee
in
response
to
submission
receive
and
public
engagement
.
I
urge
all
interested
party
,
include
information
provider
and
isp
,
innovator
,
rights
-
holder
,
consumer
and
end
-user
,
to
study
it
carefully
and
engage
in
a
constructive

on
all
the
issue
.
this
be
a
valuable
opportunity
for
all
interested
party
to
express
they
view
and
to
make
a
meaningful
contribution
towards
shape
the
future
development
of
Irish
copyright
law
.
I
be
confident
that
the
work
be
carry
out
by
the
copyright
Review
Committee
,
with
the
interaction
and
input
of
the
interested

,
will
result
in

question
put
and
agree
to
.
I
thank
deputy
Michael
McGrath
for
raise
this
issue
.
as
the
deputy
be
aware
10575
special
need
assistant
post
be
available
for
allocation
to
school
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
.
this
be
the
same
number
of
post
available
for
allocation
in
the
current
school
year
.
therefore
,
there
have
be
no
reduction
in
the
overall
number
of
SNA
post
available
for
allocation
in
the
come
school
year
.
the
government
have
maintain
funding
for
special
education
and
for
sna
support
at
a
time
when
there
have
be
a
requirement
to
make
expenditure
savings
in
range
of
area
.
with
equitable
and
careful
management
and
distribution
of
this
resource
it
be
consider
that
there
will
be
sufficient
post
to
provide
access
to
sna
support
for
all
child
who
require
such
care
and
support
to
attend
school
in
accordance
with
departmental
criterion
.
through
its
network
of
local
special
educational
need
organiser
,
SENOs
,
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
be
responsible
for
allocate
special
need
assistant
to
school
to
support
child
with
special
educational
need
.
the
NCSE
operate
within
my
Department
's
criterion
in
allocate
such
support
and
this
include
a
requirement
for
it
to
have
regard
to
the
overall
cap
on
number
.
in
the
context
of
the
overall
limit
on
the
number
of
sna
post
available
,
it
be
necessary
for
the
NCSE
to
prioritise
application
and
to
distribute
sna
resource
equitably
and
efficiently
throughout
all
school
.
one
of
the
priority
criterion
apply
in
the
allocation
of
sna
post
be
to
ensure
that
the
minimum
sna
to
special
class
ratio
be
maintain
in
special
school
and
special
class
.
in
the
case
of
the
school
refer
to
by
the
deputy
,
a
special
school
for
child
with
autism
,
I
understand
it
have
a
enrolment
of
24
pupil
at
present
with
staffing
of
one
principal
and
five
mainstream
class
teacher
as
well
as
16
snas
.
this
be
a
total
of
22
staff
catering
for
the
need
of
24
pupil
and
equate
to
a
sna
to
pupil
ratio
of
1:1.5
and
a
overall
adult
to
pupil
ratio
of
1:1.1
.
this
be
a
exceptionally
high
level
of
support
and
be
considerably
in
excess
of
the
current
recommend
sna
ratio
for
special
class
group
,
include
child
with
autism
spectrum
disorder
,
as
outline
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
circular
0038
/
10
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
ratio
of
two
snas
per
special
class
group
of
six
child
.
the
NCSE
have
advise
all
school
,
include
the
school
refer
to
by
the
deputy
,
of
they
sna
allocation
for
the
current
school
year
,
take
into
account
the
care
need
of
qualifying
pupil
attend
each
school
.
school
have
be
advise
to
make
application
to
the
NCSE
for
sna
support
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
by
16
March
2012
.
they
will
be
advise
of
they
allocation
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
by
late
May
or
early
June
2012
base
on
the
number
of
valid
application
receive
by
16
March
.
therefore
,
no
final
sna
allocation
for
2012
-
13
have
be
make
for
this
school
yet
.
whereas
the
NCSE
have
indicate
to
the
school
that
base
on
its
current
pupil
number
it
have
four
surplus
sna
post
,
until
any
application
for
potential
new
entrant
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
be
consider
no
final
determination
will
be
make
.
I
understand
the
NCSE
be
due
to
meet
representative
of
the
school
shortly
to
discuss
staffing
requirement
for
the
come
school
year
.
the
NCSE
will
advise
the
school
by
late
May
or
early
June
of
its
sna
allocation
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
.
I
thoroughly
respect
the
fact
that
the
deputy
must
advocate
for
the
school
in
he
constituency
and
I
do
not
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
case
make
by
he
in
respect
of
the
school
and
the
good
work
it
carry
out
.
however
,
the
deputy
have
admit
a
overall
cap
be
in
place
.
a
process
be
under
way
in
respect
of
sna
allocation
and
we
should
have
regard
to
this
fact
.
the
deputy
's
claim
that
this
a
callous
decision
must
be
tackle
in
the
sense
that
the
overall
budget
within
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
have
be
reduce
and
we
must
ask
ourselves
why
we
have
come
to
this
stage
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
but
give
that
it
be
a
special
junior
primary
school
I
be
hopeful
that
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
will
have
regard
to
this
fact
and
a
process
be
under
way
.
the
allocation
of
snas
to
school
change
over
time
and
we
should
acknowledge
this
.
child
may
have
diminish
care
need
over
time
.
some
child
leave
school
at
the
end
of
each
school
year
and
the
pupil
population
of
a
school
may
change
over
time
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
sna
allocation
process
for
the
2012
-
13
school
year
be
still
under
way
.
school
have
be
advise
to
make
application
by
16
March
and
they
will
be
advise
of
they
sna
allocation
by
late
May
.
the
case
be
well
make
by
the
deputy
and
I
hope
the
NCSE
will
have
regard
to
this
during
its
deliberation
.
I
thank
deputy
Dowds
for
raise
this
matter
and
for
the
opportunity
to
respond
.
Stobart
Ireland
be
part
of
the
Stobart
Group
which
,
I
understand
,
operate
from
over
40
site
across
the
UK
and
Europe
.
Stobart
Ireland
begin
operate
in
2008
win
the
transport
service
contract
with
Tesco
in
2010
to
distribute
all
of
the
product
it
keep
at
depot
at
Ballymun
and
Donabate
in
Dublin
.
on
15
February
last
,
SIPTU
announce
that
follow
a
ballot
of
its
member
,
Stobart
driver
have
vote
to
strike
over
concern
about
they
working
condition
and
serve
notice
of
industrial
action
.
Stobart
Ireland
driver
subsequently
carry
out
a
36
-
hour
work
stoppage
on
Thursday
and
Friday
,
23
and
24
February
.
I
understand
that
a
picket
by
driver
be
hold
at
the
company
's
main
Irish
depot
in
Ballymun
,
Dublin
on
Thursday
from
6.00
p.m.
until
11.30
p.m
.
Rest
time
,
roster
and
general
working
condition
have
be
identify
by
SIPTU
as
the
factor
that
lead
to
the
decision
to
strike
.
SIPTU
maintain
that
this
grievance
have
be
put
before
the
company
for
some
time
but
the
company
fail
to
address
the
issue
.
it
appear
that
Stobart
Ireland
respond
to
the
threat
of
industrial
action
by
take
the
unusual
step
of
initiate
its
own
ballot
of
driver
.
the
company
claim
that
its
ballot
show
that
only
a
minority
back
industrial
action
.
it
claim
that
the
outcome
demonstrate
a
lack
of
support
for
the
plan
strike
and
call
on
the
union
to
cease
its
industrial
action
.
SIPTU
describe
the
company
ballot
as
a
coercive
tactic
and
deny
that
the
outcome
of
the
company
ballot
could
be
deem
to
articulate
the
clear
voice
of
the
majority
of
worker
in
the
driver
category
.
I
understand
that
Stobart
Ireland
have
initially
welcome
the
suggestion
to
attend
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
on
the
eve
of
the
industrial
action
.
the
company
request
that
the
threat
of
strike
action
be
lift
as
a
condition
of
its
willingness
to
engage
with
the
industrial
relation
dispute
service
.
however
,
as
the
industrial
action
proceed
as
plan
,
the
company
decline
to
engage
in
conciliation
talk
.
accord
to
report
,
the
company
have
fly
in
40
agency
driver
from
the
UK
to
replace
the
strike
worker
.
SIPTU
have
claim
that
the
driver
fly
in
be
not
inform
of
the
background
to
the
dispute
in
Dublin
before
they
arrive
.
it
appear
that
the
company
do
not
proceed
,
however
,
to
deploy
the
replacement
driver
.
I
understand
that
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
be
maintain
contact
with
both
party
to
the
dispute
and
will
continue
to
remain
available
to
assist
in
try
to
resolve
the
issue
in
dispute
.
I
would
urge
the
party
to
agree
to
avail
of
the
service
of
the
State
's
industrial
relation
machinery
and
to
engage
fully
in
the
process
.
I
urge
they
to
put
they
difficulty
and
difference
behind
they
and
approach
the
process
in
good
faith
and
with
a
view
to
accept
the
outcome
of
the
process
.
Ireland
's
system
of
industrial
relation
be
essentially
voluntary
in
nature
and
responsibility
for
the
resolution
of
industrial
dispute
between
employer
and
worker
,
whether
in
redundancy
or
other
collective
dispute
,
rest
with
the
employer
,
the
worker
and
they
representative
.
the
State
provide
the
industrial
relation
dispute
settlement
machinery
to
support
party
in
they
effort
to
resolve
they
difference
.
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
have
extensive
experience
in
assist
party
to
resolve
issue
of
rest
time
,
roster
and
other
general
working
condition
and
in
achieve
a
high
rate
of
mutually
acceptable
settlement
on
such
issue
.
even
what
often
appear
to
be
the
most
intractable
of
dispute
be
capable
of
resolution
where
both
side
engage
constructively
and
in
good
faith
in
this
voluntary
process
.
I
would
urge
the
party
involved
in
this
dispute
to
work
together
to
break
the
current
impasse
by
utilise
the
establish
machinery
for
dispute
resolution
,
who
be
available
to
assist
at
short
notice
.
Stobart
Ireland
be
a
extremely
big
company
with
a
large
footprint
across
Ireland
.
I
be
aware
of
it
from
personal
experience
on
the
road
between
Cork
and
Dublin
where
I
have
notice
a
exceptionally
high
presence
of
Stobart
truck
.
I
contend
that
we
have
a
highly
evolve
labour
relation
infrastructure
in
this
country
and
we
would
ask
company
to
engage
in
corporate
social
responsibility
and
come
a
bit
of
the
road
towards
meeting
need
that
will
ensure
driver
can
operate
safely
.
we
would
urge
all
company
that
win
contract
in
Ireland
to
engage
constructively
with
the
State
machinery
set
up
for
dispute
resolution
.
if
we
can
achieve
that
,
I
be
hopeful
some
compromise
can
be
hammer
out
through
the
labour
relation
machinery
that
exist
in
this
country
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
.
in
response
,
I
contend
that
the
legitimacy
of
the
Labour
Relation
Commission
,
which
have
open
its
door
to
facilitate
a
process
,
be
one
the
State
,
Irish
worker
and
most
employer
buy
into
.
that
be
the
right
way
to
proceed
on
this
issue
.
I
hope
the
Stobart
organisation
will
have
due
regard
to
that
process
.
deputy
Dowds
be
more
school
on
that
.
there
be
legislation
to
protect
every
worker
's
rights
and
in
respect
of
dispute
resolution
.
it
be
voluntary
by
nature
,
but
we
must
be
fair
and
balance
in
how
we
approach
the
issue
and
I
would
hope
any
reasonable
company
,
or
any
entity
,
would
use
the
voluntary
mechanism
that
be
available
.
that
be
the
way
to
proceed
.
if
that
fail
,
we
will
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it
.
as
the
deputy
be
aware
it
be
prohibit
under
exist
legislation
within
the
State
to
illegally
hack
into
the
wireless
internet
of
a
third
party
.
it
be
a
matter
for
the
Garda
Síochána
to
investigate
and
prosecute
any
such
illegal
activity
involve
the
illegal
hack
into
a
third
party
's
wireless
internet
.
access
to
the
internet
be
normally
the
subject
of
a
contract
between
a
individual
(
or
entity
)
and
a
internet
service
provider
.
any
issue
arise
between
the
party
regard
this
access
should
in
the
first
instance
be
deal
with
in
the
normal
course
of
they
business
agreement
.

at
end
of
life
.
the
laptop
to
be
upgrade
this
year
be
no
long
fit
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
be
originally
obtain
.
I
thank
Deputy
Nash
,
Terence
Flanagan
and
Kirk
for
raise
this
matter
.
this
be
the
second
time
in
the
space
of
a
year
that
Vodafone
and
its
operation
have
become
the
subject
of
a
topical
Issue
Debate
in
this
House
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
the
anxiety
that
the
propose
transfer
of
the
290
agency
post
and
27
direct
Vodafone
post
to
Teleperformance
create
for
the
worker
and
they
family
,
as
well
as
the
local
community
.
Vodafone
Ireland
announce
on
Thursday
,
22
March
that
it
have
complete
a
review
of
the
company
's
current
contract
mobile
call
-
centre
operation
.
the
company
have
state
that
follow
this
review
,
it
will
be
adopt
a
new
model
for
its
mobile
customer
care
,
result
in
a
move
to
a
new
provider
,
Teleperformance
,
which
be
headquarter
in
Newry
.
Rigney
Dolphin
be
the
previous
provider
of
this
service
at
Vodafone
's
office
in
Dundalk
.
I
be
inform
that
Teleperformance
currently
provide
a
variety
of
care
and
support
service
to
the
Vodafone
Group
in
a
range
of
other
market
,
include
the
UK
.
I
understand
that
this
change
have
arise
out
of
Vodafone
's
ongoing
review
of
customer
care
.
as
part
of
the
change
,
27
Vodafone
role
and
290
contract
role
currently
provide
by
Rigney
Dolphin
,
will
transfer
to
Teleperformance
.
I
be
inform
that
the
transfer
will
be
under
a
transfer
of
undertaking
,
protection
of
employment
arrangement
.
I
understand
that
Vodafone
Ireland
and
Rigney
Dolphin
be
currently
enter
a
six
-
week
consultation
process
with
employee
representative
,
prior
to
the
new
arrangement
take
effect
.
and
that
at
the
end
of
this
period
,
Vodafone
envisage
there
will
be
a
direct
transfer
to
Teleperformance
of
this
employee
within
they
current
role
.
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
I
to
comment
further
at
this
point
.
Rigney
Dolphin
will
remain
a
provider
to
Vodafone
Ireland
for
its
call
centre
sale
and
fix
care
function
.
I
hope
that
the
party
concerned
will
use
this
period
to
ensure
there
be
meaningful
dialogue
about
the
company
's
proposal
.
it
be
a
core
priority
of
the
government
to
retain
and
create
the
maximum
number
of
job
in
the
State
.
I
would
strongly
encourage
the
party
in
this
case
to
explore
to
the
full
extent
,
whatever
possibility
remain
to
retain
job
in
the
State
.
if
there
be
anything
that
the
government
or
its
agency
can
meaningfully
do
to
assist
in
this
regard
,
there
will
be
no
hesitation
on
we
part
.
notwithstanding
the
ongoing
effort
on
minimise
the
impact
of
the
Vodafone
decision
,
I
wish
to
assure
the
House
that
the
State
enterprise
agency
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
and
Louth
County
Enterprise
Board
,
will
continue
to
make
every
effort
possible
to
develop
new
employee
opportunity
for
Dundalk
.
a
number
of
issue
have
be
raise
.
I
have
no
problem
in
principle
with
the
Member
from
county
Louth
and
Dublin
seek
a
meeting
with
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
about
this
matter
.
in
the
first
instance
,
there
be
national
and
strategic
issue
in
regard
to
the
precarious
nature
of
call
centre
job
.
there
be
the
issue
of
the
transfer
of
undertaking
from
one
company
to
another
operating
on
behalf
of
Vodafone
-
as
a
global
corporate
entity
,
one
might
say
.
there
be
the
issue
of
corporate
social
responsibility
and
there
be
the
actual
worry
people
have
.
deputy
Kirk
refer
to
Mr.
Pickering
and
whether
the
issue
of
mobility
arise
in
he
particular
circumstance
.
I
will
relay
this
message
to
the
minister
.
my
instinct
be
that
if
the
Member
present
who
have
a
concern
be
to

a
meeting

he
this
issue
might
be

of
2010
from
my
Department
to
the
National
Transport
Authority
(
NTA
)
with
effect
from
1
December
2010
.
in
the
circumstance
,
I
have
forward
you
correspondence
to
the
NTA
for
its
attention
and
direct
reply
,
and
to
arrange
a
meeting
if
it
deem
necessary
.
he
should
inform
my
private
office
if
he
do
not
receive
a
reply
within
ten
working
day
.
I
would
note
that
the
information
provide
to
my
office
do
not
include
the
name
of
the
company
,
but
my
private
office
have
not
receive
any
such
meeting
request
from
a
company
as
describe
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Paschal
Donohoe
and
Heather
Humphrey
.
I
welcome
the
announcement
by
Mylan
Incorporated
of
220
job
in
the
Gaeltacht
in
Connemara
.
this
be
a
testament
to
the
hard
work
that
have
be
do
by
the
government
in
spite
of
the
awful
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
as
a
result
of
the
previous
speaker
's
government
's
action
.
in
spite
of
that
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
we
be
still
win
new
business
and
new
investment
and
we
be
,
in
spite
of
the
economic
constraint
,
send
out
signal
to
the
business
community
that
Ireland
be
open
for
business
and
that
we
be
,
against
the
head
,
do
we
very
good
to
restore
that
economic
sovereignty
that
be
lose
through
the
action
of
the
previous
speaker
and
the
government
of
which
he
be
a
cabinet
member
.
for
the
record
of
this
House
and
for
any
historical
purpose
,
deputy
Ó
Cuív
be
a
cabinet
minister
in
the
previous
government
that
bring
this
country
to
its
knee
.
when
I
listen
to
the
revisionist
rubbish
come
from
that
gentlemen'
mouth
,
it
would
make
the
hair
stand
on
the
back
of
one
's
neck
.
it
be
a
absolute
disgrace
that
anybody
who
be
a
cabinet
minister
in
the
previous
government
would
come
in
here
and
seek
to
lecture
any
other
member
on
this
side
of
the
House
about
where
he
perceive
that
we
be
go
wrong
in
term
of
the
path
that
we
be
on
to
try
to
restore
we
economic
sovereignty
.
when
I
listen
to
he
word
,
I
must
say
that
they
be
quite
confused
.
I
do
not
understand
one
iota
of
what
he
be
say
.
he
contradict
himself
when
he
state
that
nobody
understand
this
treaty
and
then
,
in
another
sentence
,
that
the
treaty
do
not
go
far
enough
.
it
be
contradictory
verbiage
.
it
be
time
that
he
be
call
on
the
bluff
and
bluster
that
we
have
hear
from
he
this
past
few
month
.
it
behove
we
,
as
parliamentarian
,
to
speak
responsibly
when
we
come
into
this
House
.
we
all
be
prone
to
oratorical
flourish
.
I
do
not
exclude
myself
from
that
process
,
but
I
think
we
endeavour
to
speak
the
truth
.
Ratification
of
this
treaty
be
fundamental
to
Ireland
's
recovery
.
the
instability
that
have
plag
the
euro
have
be
a
destabilising
feature
of
the
EU
polity
and
one
which
have
diminish
we
stature
as
a
continent
in
hegemonic
term
.
the
euro
be
we
currency
.
it
be
Ireland
's
currency
and
the
treaty
be
about
bring
stability
to
the
entire
eurozone
.
as
a
small
open
economy
subject
to
the
vagary
of
global
economic
shift
,
Ireland
's
national
interest
be
well
serve
by
we
continuation
as
a
member
of
this
currency
.
Irish
ratification
of
the
treaty
would
further
enhance
grow
international
confidence
in
we
ongoing
recovery
.
we
be
on
target
to
reduce
we
budget
deficit
to
under
3
%
by
2015
and
we
export
be
grow
strongly
.
nobody
would
claim
that
the
treaty
be
the
sole
answer
to
Europe
's
economic
problem
,
but
it
be
a
crucial
part
of
a
wide
package
of
necessary
measure
.
the
treaty
must
be
accompany
by
more
action
to
achieve
growth
and
job
,
particularly
at
EU
level
.
membership
of
a
strong
stable
euro
be
vital
for
the
development
of
the
economy
.
achieve
a
European
investment
programme
for
growth
and
job
should
be
a
European
aspiration
and
one
that
be
well
serve
by
co-operation
with
we
eurozone
partner
.
I
reiterate
that
,
only
today
,
Mylan
Incorporated
announce
more
than
220
new
position
in
addition
to
the
exist
operation
in
Ireland
.
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
ensure
that
investment
such
as
this
continue
in
the
future
.
Ratification
of
this
treaty
will
help
to
ensure
that
Ireland
be
see
as
a
safe
place
to
do
business
.
any
claim
that
reject
the
treaty
will
mean
no
more
difficult
decision
be
require
be
patently
false
and
disingenuous
.
there
have
be
claim
from
member
of
the
Opposition
that
this
treaty
will
lead
to
further
austerity
and
hardship
for
the
Irish
people
.
to
that
who
call
this
a
austerity
treaty
I
say
this
.
it
be
a
falsehood
to
create
a
narrative
that
implicitly
suggest
that
voting
"
no
"
mean
end
fiscal
consolidation
.
the
simple
fact
be
that
we
,
as
a
sovereign
government
,
must
stabilise
we
public
finances
.
that
be
a
moral
imperative
.
it
be
a
moral
imperative
to
ensure
that
future
generation
be
leave
a
half
decent
legacy
with
which
to
live
.
a
debt
to
gdp
ratio
of
more
than
90
%
damage
growth
and
Ireland
's
debt
to
gdp
ratio
be
expect
to
peak
at
approximately
118
%
this
year
.
we
take
in
only
€
7
million
for
each
€
10
million
spend
.
we
borrow
€
44
million
daily
to
run
the
country
.
that
be
equivalent
to
France
borrowing
almost
€600
million
a
day
.
this
simply
be
not
sustainable
and
we
cannot
afford
to
leave
that
burden
to
future
generation
.
in
Ireland
's
case
,
the
stability
treaty
require
we
to
do
no
more
than
we
be
already
do
to
rebalance
the
public
finances
.
the
treaty
do
not
prevent
investment
.
what
it
do
be
ensure
we
have
sustainable
finances
,
balance
budget
,
or
budget
in
surplus
in
good
time
and
no
unsustainable
deficit
in
recessionary
time
.
investment
be
perfectly
possible
in
this
circumstance
.
that
be
a
classical
Keynesian
theory
.
Keynes
's
theory
have
be
misinterpret
by
some
to
suit
some
political
narrative
.
Keynes
be
not
simply
about
stimulus
package
that
never
need
to
be
pay
for
.
the
economist
,
Seamus
Coffey
of
ucc
,
recently
state
that
have
the
treaty
and
the
wide
package
of
measure
now
be
consider
through
close
macroeconomic
surveillance
be
in
place
over
the
past
decade
,
Ireland
's
economic
crash
would
probably
have
be
less
severe
and
we
probably
would
not
have
need
a
bailout
in
2010
.
that
who
oppose
this
treaty
in
Ireland
never
state
where
Ireland
will
get
the
funding
for
a
stimulus
package
.
they
only
offer
slogan
about
tax
the
rich
,
and
yet
refuse
to
back
initiative
such
as
a
property
tax
.
they
think
that
government
borrowing
do
not
have
to
be
pay
back
and
that
there
be
no
negative
consequence
to
default
.
there
have
also
be
question
around
why
Ireland
need
access
to
the
European
stability
mechanism
if
the
intention
be
to
return
to
the
market
next
year
.
the
government
have
every
intention
of
return
to
the
international
lending
market
next
year
.
the
existence
of
the
ESM
will
make
this
process
easy
.
the
ESM
be
a
safety
net
and
will
mean
that
we
will
be
in
a
good
bargain
position
when
we
be
look
for
market
funding
.
this
treaty
will
come
into
effect
when
12
eurozone
country
ratify
it
by
1
January
2013
or
early
.
unlike
previous
EU
treaty
,
Ireland
do
not
have
a
veto
over
this
treaty
.
the
only
people
affect
by
a
Irish
"
no
"
would
be
the
Irish
people
themselves
.
decide
not
to
ratify
this
treaty
would
make
Ireland
's
economic
recovery
more
difficult
by
,
crucially
,
deny
we
future
access
to
the
ESM
.
we
be
work
to
ensure
no
second
bailout
will
be
necessary
,
but
the
very
fact
of
not
have
the
insurance
policy
of
ESM
access
could
undermine
international
confidence
in
we
recovery
.
the
Irish
Labour
Party
have
long
argue
that
fiscal
consolidation
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
growth
and
that
one
cannot
work
without
the
other
.
that
be
why
we
,
with
we
colleague
in
government
,
be
continually
press
for
more
growth
initiative
in
Europe
.

I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
the
State
Examination
Commission
be
establish
as
a
independent
agency
in
2003
to
deal
with
all
operational
issue
relate
to
state
examination
.
the
minister
do
not
have
a
role
in
the
selection
criterion
for
the
appointment
of
superintendent
of
state
examination
.
the
State
Examination
Commission
have
provide
I
with
the
follow
information
.
during
the
period
of
the
write
examination
each
June
much
of
the
integrity
of
the
examination
process
depend
on
the
manner
in
which
superintendent
perform
they
assign
task
.
it
be
a
critical
role
,
one
that
have
be
perform
with
excellence
,
skill
and
dedication
by
thousand
of
superintendent
during
the
year
.
superintendent
have
a
range
of
important
duty
during
a
three
week
period
in
June
.
this
include
the
safe
custody
of
the
examination
paper
and
complete
examination
script
and
the
safe
and
proper
conduct
of
each
day
's
examination
in
line
with
the
rule
and
procedure
lay
down
by
the
State
Examination
Commission
.
some
4700
superintendent
have
be
appoint
by
the
State
Examination
Commission
to
almost
750
second
level
school
for
the
2012
examination
.
this
do
not
include
almost
9000
superintendent
appoint
locally
by
school
,
mindful
of
the
specific
need
of
each
individual
student
,
to
supervise
student
with
special
educational
need
.
typically
,
examination
superintendent
be
draw
from
the
pool
of
unemployed
,
serve
and
retire
teacher
.
they
be
appoint
each
year
by
the
State
Examination
Commission
through
public
advertisement
in
the
national
newspaper
,
by
issue
last
year
's
superintendent
with
a
application
form
and
provide
supplies
of
application
form
for
all
post
-
primary
school
.
examination
centre
can
accommodate
up
to
50
examination
candidate
.
in
the
main
,
the
State
Examination
Commission
appoint
experienced
teacher
as
examination
superintendent
.
there
be
a
long
-
standing
policy
of
appoint
unemployed
and
substitute
teacher
before
draw
on
other
applicant
.
it
be
consider
that
teacher
's
classroom
management
skill
and
experience
of
work
with
young
people
be
equally
require
for
the
effective
conduct
of
the
examination
superintending
duty
.
for
reason
of
examination
integrity
,
superintendent
be
not
assign
to
they
own
school
,
any
school
in
which
they
have
teach
in
the
previous
five
year
,
any
centre
in
which
they
have
a
relative
sit
a
examination
or
within
a
16
kilometer
radius
of
they
home
address
.
I
hope
I
have
respond
adequately
to
the
deputy
's
concern
.
I
have
full
sympathy
for
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.
while
he
make
a
logical
and
cogent
case
,
if
I
be
to
be
honest
,
we
must
speak
to
the
independence
of
the
State
Examination
Commission
in
term
of
the
role
of
superintendent
and
so
forth
.
the
deputy
be
absolutely
right
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
make
statement
on
the
role
of
retire
teacher
.
I
respectfully
ask
the
deputy
to
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
in
respect
of
get
that
number
.
if
he
would
like
to
communicate
with
I
afterwards
,
perhaps
we
can
discuss
a
mechanism
by
which
this
issue
should
be
raise
with
the
State
Examination
Commission
,
so
as
to
allow
for
a
situation
to
exist
whereby
the
person
who
write
to
the
deputy
would
at
least
have
some
sort
of
a
chance
,
have
apply
for
five
year
in
a
row
,
if
I
understand
the
deputy
correctly
.
that
throw
up
a
particular
scenario
which
,
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
,
should
be
raise
as
a
issue
.
there
be
a
public
issue
involve
and
I
have
sympathy
with
the
case
the
deputy
be
make
.
I
will
talk
to
the
minister
about
this
.
if
it
be
a
independent
commission
then
there
may
be
issue
about
how
to
approach
it
and
the
commission
's
clear
and
unambiguous
role
in
this
.
however
,
I
certainly
have
sympathy
for
the
view
express
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
have
-
at
the
risk
of
be
accuse
of
ageism
-
young
,
part
-
time
teacher
take
up
this
role
on
a
annual
basis
.
I
will
talk
to
the
deputy
afterwards
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
he
say
we
all
agree
that
savings
need
to
be
make
.
if
he
agree
with
that
premise
,
then
it
be
not
enough
to
suggest
that
he
change
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
without
provide
a
alternative
to
make
savings
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
give
I
the
opportunity
to
outline
to
the
House
the
position
on
the
budgetary
measure
relate
to
the
staffing
of
small
primary
school
,
to
which
I
assume
he
be
refer
.
there
be
no
scope
in
this
year
's
departmental
budget
to
reverse
this
measure
or
indeed
any
of
the
budget
measure
concern
teacher
allocation
at
second
level
.
furthermore
,
the
unallocated
deficit
in
the
education
budget
for
2013
be
€
77
million
,
and
€
147
million
for
2014
.
there
be
no
easy
solution
to
this
challenge
.
the
government
have
protect
education
as
much
as
it
can
.
far
great
reduction
in
the
number
of
public
servant
be
be
make
in
other
sector
relative
to
that
in
school
,
but
there
be
limit
on
the
number
of
teaching
post
we
can
afford
.
in
the
case
of
primary
school
,
there
be
no
increase
in
the
staffing
schedule
general
average
of
28:1
for
the
allocation
of
classroom
teacher
at
primary
level
.
however
,
there
be
a
phase
increase
in
the
pupil
threshold
for
the
allocation
of
classroom
teacher
in
small
primary
school
.
as
part
of
the
budget
decision
announce
,
the
number
of
pupil
require
to
gain
and
retain
a
teaching
post
in
small
primary
school
will
be
gradually
increase
between
September
2012
and
September
2014
.
the
school
concerned
be
that
with
four
or
few
classroom
teacher
with
enrolment
of
few
than
86
pupil
.
all
school
be
be
treat
equally
irrespective
of
the
type
of
patronage
.
the
government
recognise
that
small
school
be
a
important
part
of
the
social
fabric
of
rural
community
.
with
the
notable
exception
of
that
Deputy
who
be
in
large
conurbation
,
we
all
represent
constituency
where
there
be
strong
and
viable
rural
community
,
so
we
be
very
conscious
of
this
issue
as
well
.
the
small
school
will
continue
to
be
a
feature
of
we
education
landscape
.
however
,
this
do
not
mean
that
small
school
can
stand
still
or
never
have
they
staffing
level
change
to
something
that
be
more
affordable
and
sustainable
for
this
difficult
and
challenging
time
.
the
teacher
in
small
school
cannot
be
immune
from
the
requirement
that
be
be
ask
of
all
public
servant
to
deliver
we
public
service
on
a
reduce
level
of
resource
.
even
after
all
this
budget
measure
be
implement
,
small
school
will
,
in
relative
term
,
be
well
staff
than
medium
to
large
school
,
which
be
currently
operate
at
a
general
average
of
one
classroom
teacher
for
every
28
pupil
.
the
phasing
of
this
measure
can
provide
the
school
concerned
with
time
to
consider
the
potential
for
amalgamation
with
other
school
where
this
be
feasible
.
if
amalgamation
take
place
,
they
will
be
voluntary
and
follow
decision
take
by
local
community
and
not
by
the
Department
.
the
Department
have
expand
the
exist
appeal
process
so
that
it
be
accessible
to
the
73
small
school
that
be
lose
a
classroom
post
as
a
result
of
the
budget
measure
.
this
school
will
not
lose
they
classroom
post
if
any
of
they
be
project
increase
enrolment
in
September
2012
that
would
be
sufficient
to
allow
they
to
retain
they
exist
classroom
post
over
the
long
term
.
the
detailed
arrangement
be
set
out
in
the
Department
's
staffing
circular
that
be
publish
on
the
Department
's
website
.
the
appeal
board
meeting
be
take
place
this
week
and
school
will
be
notify
of
the
outcome
as
soon
as
possible
.
a
value
for
money
examination
of
small
school
,
to
which
the
deputy
refer
,
have
be
carry
out
and
the
Department
expect
to
publish
the
analysis
and
finding
of
that
in
the
near
future
.
I
hope
this
report
will
foster
constructive
engagement
both
in
the
Oireachtas
and
among
all
interested
party
in
examine
the
challenge
ahead
and
how
good
to
provide
for
primary
education
in
rural
and
disperse
community
.
with
due
respect
to
the
deputy
,
if
he
want
to
speak
about
a
particular
school
in
he
constituency
,
I
respectfully
suggest
he
should
have
put
that
into
wording
of
the
text
of
the
matter
.
I
reiterate
that
the
unallocated
deficit
in
the
education
budget
for
2013
be
€
77
million
and
it
be
€
147
million
for
2014
.
if
I
understand
the
deputy
correctly
,
he
say
that
there
be
a
school
in
he
constituency
that
be
burst
at
the
seam
and
he
ask
why
do
we
not
take
some
of
pupil
out
of
that
school
and
populate
a
small
school
in
the
constituency
with
they
.
we
be
not
in
the
business
in
this
country
of
engineering
solution
whereby
we
would
go
into
people
's
house
and
say
they
must
put
they
son
or
daughter
into
a
particular
school
because
one
school
be
burst
at
the
seam
and
another
one
be
just
about
thriving
.
we
do
not
interfere
with
parental
decision
.
we
do
not
interfere
with
parental
decision
as
to
where
they
decide
to
send
they
child
to
school
.
that
would
set
a
dangerous
precedent
if
that
be
what
the
deputy
be
suggest
.
if
the
deputy
be
talk
about
take
pupil
out
of
school
and
put
they
into
other
school
,
he
be
set
a
dangerous
precedent
.
Parental
choice
as
to
where
one
send
one
's
child
to
school
be
paramount
.
it
be
important
we
recognise
that
within
this
State
.
there
be
not
much
else
I
can
say
.
I
have
say
it
all
.
will
the
deputy
yield
for
a
interjection
?
would
the
deputy
acknowledge
that
the

I
thank
the
Deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
I
reiterate
my
concern
at
the
treatment
of
this
young
person
which
be
completely
at
variance
with
any
Republican
principle
to
which
we
adhere
as
Democrat
.
the
manner
in
which
this
young
person
be
treat
be
also
un-Christian
.
I
sympathise
with
she
and
agree
with
the
Deputy
.
I
can
confirm
to
the
House
that
the
Department
and
the
minister
take
this
matter
very
seriously
.
on
foot
of
correspondence
from
the
Ombudsman
for
Children
,
the
Department
have
initiate
a
inspection
of
the
school
concerned
and
that
inspection
be
ongoing
.
the
first
part
involve
a
unannounced
incidental
inspection
visit
which
take
place
in
February
.
a
second
inspection
visit
will
be
complete
this
month
.
it
be
expect
that
the
report
on
the
inspection
will
be
complete
before
the
end
of
June
.
in
order
not
to
prejudice
the
outcome
of
the
inspector
's
report
,
I
do
not
propose
to
comment
further
on
the
specific
case
.
that
be
not
to
fudge
the
issue
,
but
in
respect
of
enrolment
generally
,
the
current
position
be
that
every
school
be
legally
oblige
to
publish
its
enrolment
policy
in
such
a
manner
as
the
board
,
with
the
agreement

,
consider
appropriate

change
in
regulation
and
legislation
on
how
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
allocate
place
to
student
.
Central
to
the
question
of
enrolment
be
the
need
to
ensure
a
fair
and
transparent
system
in
all
school
which
do
not
discriminate
unfairly
against
student
or
parent
.
the
discussion
paper
on
a
regulatory
framework
for
school
enrolment
contain
suggestion
on
how
the
process
of
enrol
in
school
can
be
make
more
open
,
equitable
and
consistent
.
the
have
make
it
clear
that
the
paper
be
not
mean
to
be
prescriptive
,
nor
have
any
decision
be
make
as
to
what
element
will
be
contain
in
any
final
regulation
or
legislation
.
the
purpose
of
the
paper
be
to
lead
and
provoke
debate
on
enrolment
policy
and
practice
.
education
partner
and
interested
party

invite
to
submit
they
view
to
the
Department
by
28
October
last
and
official
be
co-ordinate
the
submission
receive
.
the
feedback
from
this
consultation
will
help
inform
the
nature
and
scope
of
a
new
regulatory
framework
for
school
enrolment
.
the
minister
intend
to
bring
legislative
proposal
to
government
this
year
,
the
primary
aim
of
which
will
be
to
ensure
every
child
be
treat
fairly
and
have
a
place
at
school
.
I
hope
this
answer
be
a
adequate
response
to
the
question
raise
by
the
Deputy
.
there
be
no
timeframe
for
the
legislation
.
with
regard
to
enrolment
policy
,
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
publicly
and
privately
fund
school
.
that
be
a
personal
opinion
.
if
we
cherish
all
the
child
equally
,
where
they
go
to
school
should
not
affect
how
they
be
treat
.
that
be
a
personal
view
but
it
be
one
I
would
articulate
in
any
legislative
piece
and
I
have
make
my
view
know
to
the
minister
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
consider
view
on
the
issue
.
all
education
stakeholder
throughout
the
land
would
look
with
empathy
on
this
case
.
there
be
sense
of
empathy
for
the
girl
give
the
manner
in
which
she
be
treat
.
this
example
be
a
aberration
in
the
system
.
a
decision
be
take
by
one
school
.
the
system
and
its
stakeholder
,
by
its
nature
,
be
empathetic
and
deal
positively
with
people
in
all
sort
of
circumstance
.
I
take
the
point
make
about
the
need
for
great
co-ordination
at
departmental
level
.
that
be
something
that
could
be
work
through
the
Joint
Committee
on
Jobs
,
social
Protection
and
Education
.
perhaps
a
initiative
could
arise
out
of
that
meeting
that
have
take
place
.
the
minister
have
make
it
very
clear
that
discrimination
of
this
nature
be
unacceptable
.
we
would
all
agree
with
that
position
and
I
restate
it
.
I
wish
to
share
time
with
Deputy
Doyle
,
Keaveney
,
Jim
Daly
and
McNamara
.
I
be
proud
to
be
present
today
because
it
be
the
first
anniversary
of
the
announcement
by
the
then
president
of
the
Labour
Party
,
Mr.
Michael
D.
Higgins
,
of
he
candidacy
for
the
office
of
President
of
Ireland
.
with
you
permission
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
I
will
quote
from
he
statement
of
that
day
:
the
Labour
Party
be
the
old
party
in
Ireland
and
be
found
in
the
year
before
one
of
the
great
confrontation
between
labour
and
capital
in
the
history
of
the
Irish
State
,
the
great
lock
-
out
in
Dublin
of
1913
.
he
go
on
to
say
:
what
be
then
a
poverty
stricken
and
vulnerable
movement
of
labour
seek
to
organise
against
a
version
of
capitalism
that
refuse
the
most
basic
rights
to
worker
,
include
the
very
right
to
organise
.
that
confrontation
require
courage
,
tenacity
,
solidarity
and
,
above
all
,
a
commitment
to
class
and
history
beyond
the
short
-
term
challenge
.
we
should
never
forget
that
.
to
this
day
we
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
struggle
of
the
labour
movement
of
1913
.
moreover
,
as
they
heir
we
be
require
to
make
a
analysis
of
we
own
difficult
time
to
craft
a
strategy
and
to
deliver
we
view
of
a
alternative
society
with
a
sustainable
and
productive
connection
between
economy
and
society
in
the
institution
that
can
deliver
it
.
that
man
,
thankfully
,
be
now
President
of
Ireland
.
I
be
proud
to
be
here
to
say
we
be
continue
,
to
the
good
of
we
ability
,
on
he
legacy
and
vision
.
on
the
legislation
,
and
that
particular
vision
,
give
the
day
that
be
in
it
,
I
be
glad
to
see
the
pupil
of
the
Presentation
primary
school
of
Doneraile
in
the
Gallery
because
we
must
have
regard
to
they
future
.
it
be
precisely
in
the
vision
set
out
by
person
date
back
to
1913
,
and
through
person
like
President
Michael
D.
Higgins
,
that
such
narrative
continue
.
we
do
we
good
to
ensure
there
be
a
future
for
that
child
.
the
plight
of
employee
in
the
current
economic
environment
be
foremost
in
the
deliberation
of
government
as
it
seek
to
stimulate
the
creation
of
job
and
a
return
to
economic
growth
.
various
high
-
profile
case
that
have
be
widely
report
in
the
media
highlight
the
precarious
nature
of
employment
in
some
sector
at
present
and
the
need
to
ensure
vulnerable
employee
be
treat
fairly
by
employer
and
they
complaint
adequately
adjudicate
by
the
appropriate
employment
rights
body
of
the
State
.
no
doubt
the
propose
Bill
under
discussion
here
this
evening
be
well
intend
.
however
,
it
be
impractical
in
its
scope
and
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
achieve
.
ultimately
,
it
could
serve
only
to
expose
the
taxpayer
and
employer
to
additional
burden
while
also
,
ironically
,
act
as
a
chill
factor
to
the
creation
of
vitally
necessary
new
employment
in
the
State
.
we
need
only
go
back
to
one
of
the
original
EU
directive
of
1998
in
this
area
which
note
the
need
"
for

economic
and
social
development

Sinn

seek
to

effectively
allow

I

if

be

I

the

also
ensure
that

in

it

,
I
be
satisfied
the
current

contain
in

,
be
sufficient
for
this
purpose
.
the

section
9
and
10
of
the
Protection

,
as
amend
,
make
it
mandatory
on

to
engage
in

process
with

to

30

the
exist

for

range
of
sanction
to

against

he
or

fail
to

section
12
of
the
act
make
it
mandatory
for
a
employer
to
notify
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
of
he
or
she
intention
to
create
collective
redundancy
at
least
30
day
prior
to
the
first
dismissal
take
effect
.
as
I
have
indicate
,
while
the
thrust
behind
the
legislation
may
be
well
intend
,
ultimately
,
this
Bill
be
impractical
and
crucially
may
expose
the
taxpayer
and
the
wide
economy
to
major
unintended
consequence
.
there
be
two
main
difficulty
with
the
Bill
.
the
90
-
day
consultation
period
for
large
company
be
unrealistic
and
be
inconsistent
with
the
flexibility
need
by
company
to
make
decision
on
restructuring
and
change
.
the
one
certainty
be
that
by
impose
a
consultation
period
as
long
as
90
day
,
the
rule
will
be
honour
more
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
.
equally
,
it
could
involve
a
prolonged
period
of
uncertainty
for
employee
,
some
of
whom
may
be
discourage
from
remain
with
a
particular
employer
in
what
would
be
a
artificially
extend
period
of
doubt
.
the
propose
period
of
90
day
be
significantly
great
than
in
most
other
EU
member
state
.
significantly
,
the
UK's
Department
of
Business
,
Innovation
and
Skill
be
also
actively
evaluate
the
relevance
of
the
continue
application
of
the
90
-
day
provision
in
the
context
of
its
own
economic
circumstance
.
the
proposal
surround
the
circumstance
of
a
company
cease
trading
and
the
granting
of
redundancy
payment
be
overly
simplistic
and
potentially
let
the
employer
off
the
hook
for
what
he
or
she
should
be
rightfully
pay
by
way
of
redundancy
payment
.
the
proposal
have
the
potential
to
encourage
abuse
by
employer
and
will
expose
the
taxpayer
to
cost
that
he
or
she
should
not
have
to
bear
.
I
ask
the
House
to
bear
in
mind
that
company
that
be
operate
outside
of
this
jurisdiction
.
it
must
be
also
recognise
that
several
of
the
case
that
have
give
rise
to
this
Bill
concern
a
small
number
of
intractable
scenario
where
sudden
wind
-
up
have
occur
as
the
result
of
court
order
,
many
of
which
have
be
extra-jurisdictional
,
typically
in
the
UK
,
and
no
consultation
or
information
period
whatsoever
-
be
it
30
day
or
90
day
-
take
place
.
a
extend
notification
period
to
employee
in
such
difficult
and
atypical
circumstance
would
be
of
limited
use
in
seek
to
improve
the
circumstance
of
affect
employee
.
the
exist
30
day
information
and
consultation
period
and
the
30
day
notification
period
to
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
have
serve
the
State
well
for
more
than
30
year
and
neither
employer
nor
employee
representative
have
ever
seek
they
amendment
.
this
be
because
,
in
the
majority
of
normal
collective
redundancy
situation
,
employer
comply
with
the
require
information
and
consultation
period
,
specifically
that
no

a
30
day
period

in
fact
,
in
practice
,
the
notice
period
provide
in

collective

very
often
exceed
the
minimum
statutory
provision
.
a
representative
sample
of
redundancy
notification
receive
by
the
minister
in
2012
show
that
a
majority
of
employee
in
collective
redundancy
situation
already
receive
in
excess
of
30
day
's
notice
that
redundancy
be

for
the
company
.
more
than
65
%
of
the
notification
provide
for
a
minimum
period
of
six
week
before

while
50
%
provide
for
a
minimum
period
of
two
month
before

.
even
in

wish

the
concern
that
have
be
express
by
you

the

regulation

be
sign
into

on
29
February

however
,
I
would
like
to
explain
that
this
legislative
measure
concern
injunction
against
intermediary
have
be
introduce
to
clarify
the
situation
that
arise
follow
a
high
court
judgment
in
the
case
of
EMI
and
other
-v-
UPC
.
this
judgment
hold
that
by
reason
of
provision
of
the
copyright
and
related
Right
Act
2000
,
a
injunction
be
not
available
in
case
of
transient
communication
,
and
that
Ireland
do
not
comply
with
EU
law
.
as
you
will
appreciate
,
non-compliance
with
EU
law
be
a
very
serious
matter
.
I
be
satisfied
that
the
high
Court
now
have
significant
guidance
in
the
implementation
of
the
legislative
measure
which
have
be
introduce
arise
from
the
underpin
EU
directive
,
as
interpret
by
the
recent
court
of
Justice
of
the
European
Union
case
law
,
to
ensure
that
any
remedy
provide
will
uphold
the
follow
principle
:
freedom
to
conduct
a
business
enjoy
by
operator
such
as
isp
;
the
absolute
requirement
that
a
isp
cannot
be
require
to
carry
out
general
monitoring
on
the
information
it
carry
on
its
network
;
any
measure
must
be
fair
and
proportionate
and
not
be
unnecessarily
complicated
or
costly
;
the
fundamental
rights
of
a
isp
's
customer
must
be
respect
,
namely
they
right
to
protection
of
they
personal
datum
and
they
freedom
to
receive
or
impart
information
.
I
would
like
to
point
out
that
I
be
determined
to
ensure
that
Ireland
will
be
a
premier
location
where
innovation
can
flourish
and
where
innovation
be
facilitate
by
we
copyright
law
.
in
this
regard
,
I
be
commit
to
review
and
update
the
copyright
legislation
currently
in
place
in
order
to
strike
the
right
balance
between
encourage
innovation
and
protect
creativity
.
in
this
context
,
please
note
that
the
copyright
review
Committee
publish
a
wide
-
range
consultation
Paper
on
29
February
,
2012
which
examine
the
current
copyright
legislative
framework
to
identify
any
area
of
the
legislation
that
might
be
deem
to
create
barrier
to
innovation
.
the
Consultation
Paper
be
a
discussion
document
which
set
out
issue
and
concern
which
be
express
to
the
committee
in
submission
from
a
broad
spectrum
of
interested
party
on
foot
of
a
initial
consultation
process
hold
during
the
summer
of
2011
(
in
the
region
of
100
submission
be
receive
during
the
initial
consultation
process
)
.
the
fundamental
aim
of
this
Paper
be
to
begin
the
process
of
sketch
reform
to
Irish
copyright
law
to
further
innovation
without
deny
protection
to
that
who
need
copyright
law
to
innovate
.
I
would
specifically
refer
to
Chapter
6
of
the
review
Committee
's
consultation
Paper
which
be
concerned
with
intermediary
and
it
be
state
that
"
one
of
the
main
question
for
the
present
review
be
whether
the
copyright
balance
between
rights
-
holder
and
intermediary
now
require
further
amendment
,
in
particular
to
incentivise
innovation
.
"
if
any
interested
party
have
any
concern
in
this
regard
,
I
would
suggest
that
they
engage
with
this
review
process
.
my
Department
do
not
have
office
in
Waterford
city
or
county

I
have
ask
the

request

from
the

that
the
local
group
concern
be
explore
the
possible
avenue
of
funding
for
the
development
of
its
area
as
a
tourism
location
.
in
this
regard
,
I
think
the
good
approach
would
be
for
the
group
to
first
engage
with
Fáilte
Ireland
who
can
advise
on
what
funding
be
available
and
where
good
to
apply
for
the
various
project
they
be
plan
.
accordingly
,
if
the
deputy
can
supply
my
office
with
the
relevant
contact
detail
,
I
will
notify
Fáilte
Ireland
and
ask
it
to
make
direct
contact
with
the
group
.
the
memorandum
of
understanding
have
not
be

yet

the

be
be
a

premature

have

Sinn

the

come
out

we
be
much

organised
,
Micheál
.
the
deputy
be
not
listen
to
the
answer
.
can
I
clarify
?
I
be
read
a
response
that
be
pertinent
to
the
issue
deputy
Flanagan
be
raise
.
it
be
in
order
to
assist
with
the
reply
.
I
say
that
sincerely
.
I
be
a
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Quinn
,
be
unavoidably
detain
elsewhere
.
I
thank
deputy
Flanagan
for
raise
this
important
matter
.
the
deputy
refer
to
a
announcement
last
December
that
the
means
test
for
student
grant
will
be
amend
to
take
account
of
the
value
of
certain
capital
asset
as
well
as
income
for
the
2013
-
14
academic
year
.
a
considerable
body
of
report
over
a
number
of
year
have
strongly
recommend
the
introduction
of
a
capital
test
for
student
grant
,
on
the
grounds
of
equity
and
fairness
.
the
introduction
of
such
a
test
would
create
a
more
equitable
basis
for
means
testing
where
a
more
complete
analysis
be
undertake
of
a
family
's
capacity
to
support
they
child
in
pursue
further
or
high
education
.
the
deputy
will
appreciate
,
in
the
context
of
the
current
financial
climate
,
the
importance
of
accurately
target
increasingly
scarce
resource
to
that
who
need
they
most
and
this
have
become
a
high
priority
.
while
the
introduction
of
a
capital
asset
test
for
student
grant
may
have
traditionally
be
perceive
as
likely
to
impact
in
particular
on
farming
community
,
I
assure
the
deputy
this
be
not
the
object
of
the
proposal
.
the
means
test
will
be
apply
fairly
to
all
applicant
.
deputy
Flanagan
may
be
aware
that
a
dedicated
capital
asset
test
implementation
group
have
be
establish
.
the
group
have
be
charge
with
bring
forward
detailed
implementation
proposal
for
new
means
testing
arrangement
for
student
grant
,
to
include
the
value
of
asset
,
for
new
applicant
begin
in
the
2013
-
14
academic
year
.
the
group
have
meet
on
three
occasion
and
its
deliberation
be
ongoing
.
I
anticipate
the
group
will
report
to
the
minister
by
the
summer
and
will
make
recommendation
on
the
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
various
class
of
asset
.
any
proposal
will
require
further
government
agreement
and
will
necessitate
legislative
amendment
.
it
will
,
therefore
,
be
agree
at
cabinet
level
.
the
short
reply
be
that
any
decision
of
this
nature
be
ultimately
a
political
decision
to
be
decide
by
government
.
we
must
await
the
recommendation
of
the
implementation
group
and
have
consideration
to
that
recommendation
.
however
,
it
be
ultimately
a
political
decision
.
I
share
the
concern
raise
by
deputy
Flanagan
in
that
I
,
too
,
represent
a
constituency
with
a
significant
agricultural
output
and
where
for
a
certain
coterie
of
the
farming
community
,
income
would
be
meagre
,
to
be
frank
about
it
.
there
have
to
be
some
regard
to
the
tool
of
the
trade
,
as
it
be
,
that
be
necessary
to
derive
that
income
.
the
minister
have
meet
with
ICMSA
representative
and
he
have
have
regard
to
the
position
espouse
by
they
and
the
implementation
group
be
work
as
we
speak
and
we
await
its
recommendation
.
however
,
it
will
be
ultimately
a
decision
for
government
.
I
thank
deputy
Neville
for
raise
this
issue
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
very
serious
issue
of
bullying
.
tackle
the
issue
of
bullying
,
and
in
particular
homophobic
bullying
in
school
,
be
a
key
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
.
bullying
can
ruin
a
young
person
's
enjoyment
of
some
of
the
most
important
year
of
he
or
she
life
and
in
some
case
can
have
tragic
consequence
.
deputy
Neville
sum
it
up
when
he
speak
about
the
pervasive
nature
of
this
form
of
bullying
.
it
can
act
as
a
barrier
to
a
young
person
have
equal
access
to
education
.
I
note
that
deputy
Neville
refer
to
the
document
draft
by
GLEN
,
the
Gay
and
Lesbian
Equality
Network
.
I
be
to
meet
with
that
organisation
's
chair
,
Mr.
Kieran
Rose
,
shortly
so
that
we
can
drive
a
agenda
that
speak
to
the
concern
raise
by
deputy
Neville
.
research
have
show
that
,
unfortunately
,
homophobic
bullying
be
a
problem
in
Irish
school
,
and
a
correlation
have
be
find
between
homophobic
bullying
and
serious
mental
health
difficulty
such
as
suicide
.
that
be
one
of
the
reason
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Quinn
,
convene
a
anti-bullying
forum
recently
,
on
17
May
,
to
explore
way
to
tackle
the
serious
problem
of
bullying
in
school
.
that
date
,
17
May
,
mark
the
International
Day
against
Homophobia
and
Transphobia
.
the
forum
,
which
be
well
attend
and
think
-
provoke
,
consider
issue
around
all
form
of
bullying
include
homophobic
bullying
,
cyber
bullying
and
racist
bullying
.
there
be
a
range
of
speaker
at
the
forum
,
which
include
contribution
from
official
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
,
and
from
a
acknowledge
academic
in
the
field
of
anti-bully
.
there
be
also
contributor
from
the
school
sector
,
include
the
various
perspective
of
school
principal
,
parent
and
pupil
.
the
objective
be
to
explore
with
all
the
relevant
stakeholder
how
good
to
tackle
bullying
in
school
.
a
further
objective
be
to
consider
what
change
or
updating
of
exist
practice
and
procedure
be
require
to
achieve
this
,
have
regard
to
what
be
feasible
to
implement
in
the
current
financial
climate
.
the
outcome
of
the
discussion
at
the
forum
will
provide
a
opportunity
to
set
out
a
roadmap
on
how
good
to
tackle
all
form
of
bullying
in
we
school
.
a
considerable
amount
of
work
to
address
the
issue
of
bullying
in
school
have
be
do
by
State
agency
and
ngo
,
such
as
GLEN
and
BeLonG
to
.
we
need
to
address
how
we
can
deepen
the
impact
of
the
measure
that
be
already
in
place
and
also
strengthen
the
culture
of
awareness
in
school
.
the
work
of
the
forum
and
any
recommendation
from
it
must
be
cognisant
of
the
current
difficult
and
challenging
budgetary
environment
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
also
establish
a
working
group
on
tackle
bullying
.
the
outcome
,
recommendation
and
submission
from
the
forum
will
assist
the
working
group
in
its
deliberation
.
the
first
phase
to
be
address
by
the
working
group
will
be
homophobic
bullying
.
there
will
be
a
opportunity
for
all
interested
stakeholder
to
submit
they
view
in
writing
.
student
,
teacher
,
parent
and
all
other
interested
party
be
invite
to
submit
they
view
on
this
important
topic
by
29
June
2012
.
deputy
Neville
have
take
a
strong
lead
on
this
issue
.
if
we
continue
to
engage
in
fora
such
as
this
one
,
we
will
be
able
to
shed
more
light
on
the
issue
,
thus
have
the
require
beneficial
outcome
.
we
all
believe
that
bullying
be
a
issue
we
can
address
by
share
we
experience
and
work
together
to
produce
a
effective
response
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
he
input
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
the
work
that
be
already
be
do
by
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
to
combat
and
prevent
bullying
.
the
inspectorate
provide
help
to
school
by
support
,
advise
on
and
evaluate
anti-bully
measure
.
this
be
do
through
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
evaluation
process
,
and
through
the
social
,
personal
and
health
education
subject
inspection
.
there
be
therefore
a
wide
range
of
service
in
that
area
.
I
note
deputy
Neville
's
point
about
some
school
be
willing
to
engage
in
anti-bully
programme
while
other
be
less
so
.
if
there
be
a
submission
to
that
effect
come
through
this
process
,
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
should
take
it
on
board
in
order
to
have
a
qualitative
outcome
to
this
issue
.
ultimately
,
the
more
educate
we
all
be
as
citizen
about
this
matter
,
the
more
it
will
be
clarify
and
demystify
.
the
more
normalise
we
culture
become
around
this
issue
,
the
less
pervasive
it
will
be
.
if
we
can
change
a
culture
we
can
then
modify
behaviour
positively
.
I
note
deputy
Neville
's
point
and
I
hope
there
will
be
some
mechanism
to
address
the
lack
of
engagement
by
some
school
on
this
matter
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
important
matter
.

be
more
susceptible
to
the
economic
downturn
and
external
shock
.
in
this
context
,
it
be
unsurprising
then
that
local
authority
mortgage
arrears
should
exceed
that
in
the
commercial
sector
and
the
Department
's
most
recent
information
put
the
level
of
loan
in
arrears
at
almost
28
%
.
in
2009
,
the
Department
issue
guideline
for
the
granting
of
local
authority
housing
loan
which
apply
stringent
condition
and
a
more
homogenous
process
across
all
34
administration
.
credit
check
of
application
by
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
be
a
central
component
of
this
initiative
,
and
loan
advance
under
the
new
regime
be
perform
considerably
good
than
pre-2009
one
.
however
,
it
be
important
that
household
face
difficulty
be
treat
fairly
and
consistently
across
all
local
authority
area
.
in
that
regard
,
the
Department
issue
comprehensive
guidance
in
2010
base
on
the
regulator
's
code
of
practice
.
this
be
to
ensure
that
case
of
local
authority
mortgage
arrears
be
handle
in
a
manner
that
be
sympathetic
to
the
need
of
the
particular
household
while
also
protect
the
position
of
the
local
authority
concerned
.
recognise
the
increase
difficulty
with
local
authority
mortgage
arrears
,
the
Department
have
be
work
in
conjunction
with
the
City
and
County
manager
Association
to
produce
a
loan
management
manual
,
the
publication
of
which
be
imminent
.
this
will
provide
borrower
in
distress
with
a
suite
of
option
under
a
mortgage
arrears
resolution
process
,
MARP
,
to
deal
with
they
loan
.
it
closely
mirror
the
Financial
Regulator
's
revise
code
of
conduct
on
mortgage
arrears
,
which
come
into
effect
on
1
January
2011
.
it
provide
for
a
collaborative
engagement
between
borrower
and
lender
to
either
restructure
the
loan
to
a
sustainable
level
,
or
else
recognise
its
sustainability
and
act
accordingly
.
whereas
it
would
be
hope
that
as
many
home
owner
as
possible
could
be
facilitate
under
the
MARP
,
it
would
be
unrealistic
not
to
accept
the
inevitability
of
a
proportion
of
loan
be
deem
unsustainable
.
in
this
circumstance
the
local
authority
and
the
borrower
would
need
to
face
the
inevitability
of
the
loan
be
unsustainable
and
act
accordingly
in
a
collaborative
and
co-operative
manner
.
local
authority
will
continue
to
deal
with
distressed
borrower
with
the
same
forbearance
and
sympathy
they
have
exhibit
in
the
past
.
they
will
facilitate
where
at
all
possible
as
many
home
owner
as
possible
to
retain
they
property
and
service
they
debt
until
such
time
as
we
return
to
less
challenging
time
.
I
do
not
have
a
date
in
respect
of
the
question
the
deputy
ask
but
respectfully
suggest
that
if
he
be
to
table
a
parliamentary
question
or
send
I
on
note
on
it
,
I
would
be
happy
to
try
to
oblige
he
.
we
do
not
have
a
definitive
timeline
for
the
publication
of
the
guideline
but
I
will
endeavour
to
come
back
to
the
deputy
on
that
.
the
deputy
refer
to
106
home
in
the
case
of
County
Offaly
.
I
be
not
sure
if
that
be
the
rate
of
arrears
,
to
what
exact
figure
that
would
amount
,
or
what
it
would
be
as
a
percentage
of
the
loan
book
in
the
Offaly
area
.
if
there
be
issue
pertain
to
he
specific
area
,
I
have
a
open
mind
in
term
of
engagement
or
at
least
I
can
refer
they
to
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
.
have
be
a
member
of
a
local
authority
and
as
somebody
who
continue
to
interface
with
a
local
authority
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
,
it
be
fair
to
reiterate
that
the
level
of
sympathy
and
empathy
with
individual
client
be
one
kind
of
a
positive
engagement
where
the
local
authority
endeavour
to
do
its
very
good
for
the
client
in
question
.
I
believe
we
would
all
agree
on
that
point
.
however
,
there
be
a
inevitability
that
a
certain
number
of
mortgage
will
go
under
.
on
the
specific
issue
the
deputy
raise
,
it
be
not
fair
to
assume
that
because
there
be
a
lack
of
a
timescale
for
the
publication
the
deputy
would
infer
that
it
will
not
be
before
the
summer
recess
.
I
can
come
back
to
he
on
the
specific
matter
raise
and
refer
they
to
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
.
I
will
undertake
to
also
refer
the
deputy
's
question
on
the
share
ownership
scheme
to
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
.
I
be
not
try
to
dodgeball
the
issue
,
I
simply
do
not
have
the
specific
reply
to
the
deputy
's
question
and
I
would
rather
not
try
to
play
a
game
of
bluff
.
I
be
happy
to
conclude
the
discussion
on
second
stage
of
the
credit
Guarantee
Bill
2012
.
this
legislation
will
address
some
of
the
difficulty
be
face
every
day
by
small
and
medium
enterprise
,
sme
,
throughout
the
country
,
which
I
have
be
make
aware
of
daily
since
be
appoint
minister
of
State
last
year
.
the
ability
of
we
sme
to
succeed
and
grow
underpin
we
future
potential
for
employment
,
growth
and
prosperity
,
and
this
Bill
show
we
commitment
to
implement
change
and
reform
in
a
step
by
step
approach
,
to
re-energise
the
economy
,
meet
the
challenge
of
recovery
,
address
a
fail
economic
model
,
restore
confidence
and
to
enhance
Ireland
's
position
in
the
world
.
I
wish
to
respond
to
some
of
the
comment
make
by
member
.
in
the
context
of
the
finer
detail
of
how
the
scheme
will
operate
,
the
minister
will
lay
the
scheme
before
the
House
as
soon
as
this
legislation
be
enact
.
this
provision
be
provide
for
in
section
6
of
the
Bill
.
as
for
the
use
of
personal
guarantee
,
the
bank
still
will
be
able
to
consider
the
normal
and
usual
way
that
security
be
provide
by
borrower
.
invoice
discounting
will
be
eligible
for
the
guarantee
scheme
.
the
guarantee
will
be
for
three
year
but
the
loan
may
be
for
a
long
term
.
the
legislation
provide
for
the
premium
payment
to
be
pay
upfront
.
however
,
this
matter
of
the
timing
of
the
payment
be
be
reconsider
and
amendment
may
be
tab
on
committee
stage
.
the
scheme
will
be
demand
-
lead
and
the
government
will
follow
performance
and
take
-
up
closely
.
if
figure
show
that
demand
exceed
€
150
million
,
this
figure
can
be
revisit
and
amend
,
if
necessary
.
regard
loan
that
be
default
,
the
bank
will
follow
they
normal
recovery
procedure
.
this
matter
of
recovery
will
be
cover
in
the
scheme
.
as
for
the
issue
of
late
payment
of
invoice
cause
difficulty
to
small
business
,
the
Department
will
transpose
the
new
EU
directive
on
late
payment
before
16
March
2013
.
with
regard
to
ensure
additionality
of
lending
under
the
guarantee
scheme
,
the
Department
be
in
talk
with
the
bank
at
present
to
ensure
they
fully
understand
they
obligation
.
the
loan
provide
under
the
scheme
will
be
closely
monitor
to
ensure
they
fall
within
the
two
market
failure
the
scheme
be
design
to
address
.
in
respect
of
the
risk
-
share
ratio
,
this
be
a
joint
commitment
by
the
government
and
the
bank
.
the
combination
of
guarantee
rate
and
default
limit
will
deliver
a
overall
risk
share
of
50:50
.
loss
over
the
default
rate
must
be
borne
by
the
bank
.
in
the
context
of
the
microfinance
fund
,
it
will
avail
of
the
EU
progress
guarantee
facility
as
soon
as
the
lending
entity
be
establish
.
I
also
point
out
that
first
step
,
which
lend
to
micro-enterprise
,
already
avail
of
this
EU
guarantee
facility
.
any
further
issue
to
which
I
have
not

will
be

on
committee
stage
.

the
Minister

will
produce

for
the

the

which
be
a

of
economic

.
it
also
form
a
essential

the
strategy
be
to

the
government
have

to

to

the
Taoiseach
,
"
the

world
in

to
do

"
by
2016
and
it
can
achieve
that
target
.
the

a
legitimate
and
important
role
in

environment
for

,
such
as
this
measure
,
can
help
market
function
well
,
give
certainty
to

and
confidence
to

.
I
believe
this
legislation
will
inspire
confidence
among
sme
in
the
bank
's
ability
to
provide
a
improve
service
to
SME
customer
,
include
previously

borrower
.
it
have
be
frequently
acknowledge
in
the
recent
past
that
there
will
be
a
cohort
of
discourage
borrower
who
assume
they
would
be
turn
down
and
therefore
do
not
apply
for
credit
.
the
introduction
of
a
guarantee
scheme
may
help
to
support
this
group
to
pursue
business
opportunity
again
.
the
majority
of
Ireland
's
enterprise
sector
comprise
small
business
.
now
more
than
ever
,
ambitious
and
energetic
business
owner
,
entrepreneur
and
manager
who
can
play
a
real
part
in
drive
a
positive
uplift
in
the
economy
be
need
.
they
be
the
job
creator
and
innovator
and
must
be
encourage
and
support
to
have
the
confidence
to
make
they
mark
and
build
a
good
future
for
themselves
and
this
country
.
this
be
the
all
too
often
unseen
risk
taker
and
innovator
and
it
always
will
be
the
hard
-
work
and
entrepreneurial
skill
of
such
individual
that
will
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
success
of
Ireland
's
sme
.
all
this
company
have
financing
need
through
the
various
stage
of
business
development
such
as
start
up
,
manage

,
invest
in

or

,
marketing
strategy
,
innovation
and
research
and
development
,
expand

and
enter
new
market
.
it
be
essential
that
the
financial
system
support
the
need
of
sme
through
all
this
stage
.
many
business
have
contact
the
Department
about
the
problem
cause
by
they
difficulty
in
access
credit
.
all
member
,
as
public
representative
,
be
aware
of
the
difficulty
that
face
people
within
they
constituency
and
nationwide
.
increase
risk
aversion
among
bank
have
make
it
significantly
hard
for
small
company
to
obtain
finance
in
recent
year
compare
with
the
period
before
the
crisis
.
Herein
lie
the
mismatch
between
the
need
of
productive
business
and
the
bank
finance
available
.
while
bank
be
try
to
reduce
risk
,
business
lending
,
especially
to

,
be
risky
.
entrepreneurship
be
risky
.
introduce
new
product
and
service
be
risky
.
export
to
emerge
market
be
risky
.
innovation
be
risky
.
this
Bill
will
enable
the
government
to
absorb
some
of
the
risk
of
lending
in
order
that
business
can
get
on
with
what
they
do
well
.
we
must
dismantle
unnecessary
barrier
that
stymie
growth
and
hold
back
investment
.
that
be
exactly
what
this
government
be
determine
to
do
and
this
Bill
move
we
in
that
direction
.
I
personally
have
meet
various
company
that
be
at
the
margin
of
sme
commercial
lending
decision
because
the
business
have
insufficient
security
or
the
lender
do
not
have
the
skill
to
carry
out
a
appropriate
assessment
of
the
business
proposition
.
it
be
essential
to
address
this
issue
in
a
way
that
will
not
reduce
the
onus
on
bank
to
honour
they
commitment
to
increase
sme
lending
overall
but
which
would
facilitate
additional
lending
over
and
above
that
commitment
.
in
conclusion
,
this
Bill
be
important
legislation
.
it
will
assist
in
the
government
's
plan
to
reshape
the
finance
landscape
to
render
it
more
effective
in
meet
the
need
of
Irish
business
.
the
government
be
take
decisive
action
to
create
the
environment
that
support
new
company
,
new
job
and
new
economic
opportunity
.
I
refer
to
action
that
keep
open
the
door
of
Irish
business
,
support
exist
business
to
scale
up
and
expand
and
facilitate
more
people
who
have
the
ambition
and
drive
to
set
up
they
own
business
.
this
Bill
be
just
one
of
the
many
step
for
delivery
of
such
a
challenging
agenda
.
I
move
:
that
the

20
million
labour
market
education
and
training
fund
will
include
specific
provision
for
that
under
25
year
of
age
.
FÁS
have
issue
a
call
for
expression
of
interest
from
training
and
education
provider
in
regard
to
this
fund
.
in
the
three
year
prior
to
the
government
take
office
,
more
than
300000
job
be
lose
.
this
scale
of
job
loss
cannot
be
reverse
overnight
,
but
we
be
systematically
deliver
on
the
commitment
we
make
in
the
action
plan
for
job
and
pathway
to
work
.
while
employment
may
fluctuate
from
quarter
to
quarter
in
this
transition
phase
of
we
economic
recovery
,
the
significant
job
announcement
since
January
-
which
include
BSkyB
,
Mylan
,
Apple
,
Eli
Lilly
,
PayPal
and
other
-
point
to
the
return
of
a
level
of
confidence
in
the
Irish
economy
that
will
translate
into
a
increase
in
the
number
of
people
in
employment
as
the
job
come
on
stream
.
on
deputy
Brendan
Smith
's
question
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
have
inform
I
there
be
no
difficulty
with
a
engagement
between
the
Department
and
the
company
to
which
the
deputy
refer
.
yes
.
a
dialogue
can
be
enter
into
in
that
respect
.
on
the
question
of
whether
the
job
initiative
introduce
by
the
government
be
prove
a
success
,
the
central
point
be
that
this
be
a
ship
which
will
take
a
long
time
to
turn
around
.
we
acknowledge
the
figure
and
be
bold
and
honest
enough
not
to
bury
we
head
in
the
sand
in
that
regard
.
we
be
seek
to
implement
a
set
of
policy
prerogative
in
the
form
of
labour
market
activation
measure
and
education
-
related
measure
.
the
latter
include
JobBridge
,
pathway
to
work
and
Springboard
,
while
the
former
include
the
extension
of
the
PRSI
incentive
scheme
in
a
way
that
incentivise
employer
to
engage
employee
and
intern
.
we
be
also
concerned
with
identify
skill
shortage
and
seek
to
address
that
through
the
education
sphere
.
all
of
that
will
take
time
.
on
the
procurement
issue
,
the
action
plan
for
job
include
a
range
of
deliverable
for
the
end
of
2012
,
to
which
I
respectfully
ask
deputy
Peadar
Tóibín
to
have
regard
.
if
he
do
not
accept
what
I
be
say
,
he
should
speak
with
representative
of
the
State
agency
task
with
this
action
,
who
will
demonstrate
the
action
they
be
undertake
at
the
behest
of
the
government
.
there
be
a
reporting
mechanism
attach
to
the
deliverable
which
see
the
cabinet
sub
-committee
on
economic
recovery
and
job
report
directly
to
the
Taoiseach
.
it
be
not
at
all
accurate
to
say
we
activity
in
this
regard
be
base
merely
on
aspiration
.
with
respect
to
the
deputy
,
my
response
point
to
the
clear
action
point
we
be
drive
in
regard
to
procurement
.
in
July
2011
my
proposal
for
reform
of
consumer
and
competition
legislation
be
approve
by
government
.
this
embody
two
commitment
give
in
the
programme
for
government
,
namely
,
the
merger
of
the
National
consumer
Agency
and
the
Competition
Authority
and
the
introduction
of
a
legislative
base
for
a
code
of
practice
in
the
grocery
sector
.
in
addition
,
the
proposal
give
effect
to
the
recommendation
of
the
advisory
group
on
media
merger
and
update
certain
element
of
competition
and
consumer
law
.
under
the
proposal
,
responsibility
for
the
application
of
the
public
interest
test
in
respect
of
media
merger
will
transfer
to
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
.
the
Bill
be
currently
be
draft
by
the
Office
of
the
Parliamentary
counsel
.
the
consolidation
of
the
various
element
of
consumer
and
competition
law
into
a
single
act
be
entirely
in
keep
with
the
principle
of
good
regulation
and
with
the
trend
within
government
to
consolidate
and
simplify
legislation
for
ease
of
reference
for
all
user
.
all
of
the
element
of
the
package
be
important
measure
to
be
deliver
.
I
see
no
benefit
in
progress
a
stand
-
alone
item
of
legislation
for
one
element
,
to
be
follow
in
due
course
by
a
more
comprehensive
package
of
reform
.
I
expect
the
consumer
and
competition
Bill
to
be
publish
late
this
year
.

I

and

together
.
my
department
,
through
the
Patent
Office
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
County
Enterprise
Board
offer
a
range
of
support
to
assist
and
enable
entrepreneur
and
enterprise
to
exploit
the
value
of
intellectual
Property
(

)
and
to
engage
in
the
optimal
exploitation
of

specifically
in

reflect
Enterprise
Ireland
's
enterprise
development
mission
,
the
agency
support
company
to
be
more
competitive
through

.
a
output
from
this
can
be
the
creation
of
patent
intellectual
Property
(
ip
)
,
however
,
measure
the
resultant
number
of
patent
application
be
not
a
effective
metric
to
assess
the
output
from
this
support
.
this
be
because
there
be
many
alternative
and
often
more
appropriate
way
for
company
to
capture
and
exploit
they
intellectual
property
.
for
example
,
in
the
software
sector
patent
may
be
prohibit
by
patent
law
,
therefore
,
copyright
be
a
more
common
means
of
secure
a
company

intellectual

.
Enterprise
Ireland
therefore
do
not
set
target
for
the
number

for

on

where
this

in
some
circumstance
the
most
effective
way
for
a

to
secure

(

be
not
to

Fáilte

do
not
issue
licence
to
run
caravan

camping
park
but
be
responsible
for
maintain
a
register
of
such
park
and
for
set
the
minimum
standard
for
registration
.
it
be
illegal
under
the
Tourist
Traffic
Act
for
park
which
be
not
register
to
describe
themselves
as
caravan
park
or
camping
park
or
a
number
of
further
protect
title
.
to
qualify
for
registration
,
park
must
consist
of
20
or
more
pitch
and
must
comply
and
be
operate
in
accordance
with
all
the
statutory
requirement
of
local
and
other
authority
include
planning
,
health
and
safety
,
water
supply
,
sewage
disposal
and
fire
precaution
.
only
when
park
meet
this
and
the
other
minimum
requirement
set
by
Fáilte
Ireland
can
they
be
register
as
Caravan
and
Camping
park
.
however
,
it
be
not
illegal
under
tourism
legislation
for
a
facility
to
operate
once
it
do
not
describe
itself
use
one
of
the
protect
title
and
Fáilte
Ireland
have
no
statutory
role
in
monitor
such
facility
.
this
facility
may
in
some
case
be
operate
in
contravention
of
other
statutory
requirement
,
e.g.
planning
,
health
and
safety
,
fire
,
etc
.
in
that
regard
,
such
potential
breach
should
be
take
up
with
the
appropriate
authority
,
e.g.
the
relevant
local
Authority
with
regard
to
possible
breach
of
planning
regulation
.
as
registration
of
such
park
be
a
operational
matter
for
Fáilte
Ireland
,
I
have
refer
the
deputy
's
question
to
they
for
further
information
and
direct
reply
.
if
you
do
not
hear
from
the
agency
within
ten
working
day
,
please
contact
my
private
office
.
the
scheme
will
not
be
debate
.
good
practice
be
to
lay
scheme
before
the
Oireachtas
and
not
to
engage
in
debate
on
individual
scheme
.
I
cannot
accept
amendment
no.
2
,
the
purpose
of
which
be
to
have
the
scheme
debate
.
on
Committee
Stage
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
clearly
indicate
he
be
unwilling
to
engage
in
a
further
full
-
blow
,
policy
-
base
discussion
on
the
temporary
partial
loan
guarantee
scheme
when
present
it
to
the
Oireachtas
.
the
time
for
policy
-
base
discussion
be
during
the
presentation
of
Bills
to
the
Oireachtas
,
not
on
the
presentation
of
secondary
legislation
.
I
understand
deputy
be
offer
the
opportunity
to
contact
official
from
the
Department
in
the
interest
of
discuss
the
draft
scheme
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
,
to
date
,
any
request
in
this
regard
have
be
receive
.
to
my
knowledge
,
they
have
not
but
the
matter
be
open
to
clarification
.
the
operator
of
the
scheme
be
currently
run
workshop
with
the
bank
.
the
target
date
for
go
live
with
the
scheme
be
August
.
as
soon
as
the
Bill
be
enact
,
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
try
to
ensure
we
meet
this
target
.
many
of
the
argument
that
have
be
put
forward
by
Opposition
spokesperson
be
also
put
forward
in
the
previous
debate
on
the
Bill
.
the
minister
have
be
definitive
in
the
context
of
reply
to
that
argument
.
I
do
not
know
if
deputy
O'Dea
be
play
politics
with
this
issue-----
-----
but
I
suspect
he
be
do
so
.
there
be
no
precedent
which
would
prevent
the
scheme
,
once
it
be
up
and
run
,
be
debate
by
the
committee
.
there
be
no
lack
of
clarity
on
my
part
or
that
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
respect
of
that
matter
.
the
Bill
before
the
House
be
enable
legislation
and
the
scheme
be
the
subject
of
a
procurement
exercise
.
there
be
actually
two
such
exercise
carry
out
in
respect
of
the
scheme
,
one
for
the
design
consultant
and
the
other
for
the
operator
.
the
deputy
be
a
former
cabinet
minister
.
he
would
have
have
control
over
policy
in
the
various
Department
in
which
he
serve
and
he
know
exactly
how
the
game
be
play
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
he
be
also
aware
we
be
oblige
to
comply
with
the
timeline
relate
to
public
procurement
.
it
take
time
to
draft
the
legislation
and
deal
with
the
various
technical
detail
involve
.
however
,
this
be
necessary
to
ensure
we
get
it
right
.
the
process
be
all
but
complete
and
we
want
to
ensure
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
roll
out
the
scheme
in
August
.
if
the
committee
want
to
discuss
the
scheme
thereafter
,
there
be
absolutely
no
issue
in
that
regard
.
that
be
a
give
.
it
be
a
fundamental
democratic
principle
that
the
committee
be
give
that
opportunity
.
without
be
disingenuous
,
I
apologise
to
the
deputy
if
he
find
my
remark
personally
hurtful
,
although
a
element
in
my
brain
tell
I
he
skin
be
thick
than
he
might
let
on
.
the
deputy
know
that
when
I
say
we
know
how
the
game
be
play
,
I
mean
there
be
a
process
and
a
system
in
place
.
I
be
speak
in
a
metaphorical
sense
.
we
be
move
to
ensure
we
can
put
the
scheme
in
place
and
expedite
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
the
scheme
must
be
target
towards
commercially
viable
business
.
we
be
conscious
that
business
have
fail
in
the
last
while
.
that
be
why
we
be
anxious
to
get
the
scheme
up
and
run
before
the
fall
of
the
year
.
business
that
be
in
trouble
will
not
,
necessarily
,
be
support
by
the
scheme
.
a
application
must
be
viable
and
accompany
by
a
business
plan
,
with
potential
projection
for
the
business
.
the
figure
of
2
%
have
to
be
charge
,
in
line
with
state
aid
requirement
.
in
tab
amendment
opposition
deputy
must
have
regard
to
this
.
state
aid
rule
must
be
adhere
to
.
we
must
be
cognisant
of
this
in
order
that
when
we
communicate
we
respective
party
position
on
the
Bill
,
the
public
will
be
make
aware
that
the
2
%
charge
be
not
be
impose
simply
for
the
sake
of
levy
a
charge
.
there
be
a
onus
on
we
to
do
this
.
it
be
important
to
answer
the
point
.
a
charge
have
to
be
make
under
State
aid
rule
.
we
all
accept
that
premise
.
that
be
fact
.
the
decision
be
for
0.8
%
upwards
.
the
government
choose
2
%
as
the
most
appropriate
rate
because
one
must
allow
a
appropriate
figure
to
be
able
to
cover
loss
contribute
to
by
administrative
and
other
cost
.
one
must
factor
that
in
.
we
be
deal
,
essentially
,
with
taxpayer
's
money
and
we
must
factor
in
a
potential
figure
for
that
loss
and
2
%
be
deem
to
be
the
most
appropriate
figure
in
that
respect
.
I
have
just
be
hand
a
note
on
the
progress
fund
.
we
do
intend
to
approach
the
European
investment
Fund
,
EIF
,
re
support
for
the
microfinance
fund
.
that
will
be
introduce
in
the
House
in
the
come
week
.
there
will
be
progress
in
that
regard
.
perhaps
we
can
communicate
with
the
deputy
on
that
particular
issue
as
well
.
I
understand
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
have
already
give
a
commitment
that
there
would
be
a
review
of
the
scheme
after
a
year
of
operation
.
it
would
be
right
and
proper
that
a
review
would
take
place
.
as
a
matter
of
course
one
would
have
to
review
the
scheme
and
I
believe
the
minister
's
commitment
be
sufficient
.
one
could
argue
that
there
may
not
be
sufficient
datum
,
pattern
or
trend
emerge
on
the
type
of
lending
that
arise
from
the
scheme
before
a
12
month
period
have
elapse
.
that
be
the
justification
for
the
government
's
decision
in
that
respect
.
however
,
the
commitment
have
be
definitively
give
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
that
respect
.
the
review
will
be
broad
and
comprehensive
and
will
not
be
restrictive
as
per
the
amendment
suggest
.
the
policy
commitment
be
to
conduct
a
review
and
to
lay
it
before
both
house
.
the
matter
be
adequately
deal
with
in
section
10
.
invoice
financing
will
be
eligible
for
the
scheme
.
we
will
monitor
closely
the
performance
and
we
will
consider
if
other
type
of
credit
should
be
include
,
as
per
deputy
O'Dea
's
point
.
we
will
make
change
if
we
deem
it
necessary
follow
the
review
.
we
be
try
to
ensure
that
we
get
the
scheme
off
the
ground
,
put
a
review
mechanism
in
place
after
12
month
base
on
qualitative
criterion
and
then
if
modification
or
adjustment
need
to
be
make
there
be
a
open
mind
in
government
on
the
matter
.
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
point
which
have
be
make
in
good
faith
.
a
scheme
of
this
nature
will
be
vital
in
provide
the
credit
necessary
to
fund
business
which
be
the
backbone
of
the
economy
.
in
this
light
,
it
would
be
ridiculous
not
to
review
the
scheme
after
a
certain
time
.
it
be
important
that
it
be
review
.
before
continue
,
I
would
be
oblige
if
,
in
accordance
with
stand
Order
140
,
the
chair
would
direct
the
clerk
to
make
a
verbal
correction
to
the
text
of
the
Bill
.
it
relate
to
the
ordering
on
page
4
of
the
Bill
of
the
definition
of
"
participate
lender
"
and
"
participate
borrower
"
.
I
request
that
the
order
of
this
two
definition
be
change
in
order
that
the
definition
of
"
participate
borrower
"
be
place
before
the
definition
of
"
participate
lender
"
in
keep
with
the
alphabetical
layout
of
the
definition
on
page

.

be

the
general
approach
of
the

in

planning

be
to
plan
on

basis
of
attendance

deputy
Smith
take
a
innovative
view
of
how
the
topical
issue
debate
should
be
utilise
in
respect
of
lobbying
for
the
new
school
.
that
be
a
lateral
and
imaginative
view
.
I
respectfully
suggest
that
the
deputy
should
table
a
parliamentary
question
or
discuss
the
issue
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
.
it
have
be
note
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
there
may
be
individual
vagary
relate
to
county
Tipperary
and
Cavan
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Ciarán
Cannon
,
have
specific
responsibility
for
this
area
.
he
be
not
averse
to
hear
the
individual
view
of
the
Deputy
in
respect
of
the
vagary
of
the
system
as
they
work
out
in
the
two
constituency
.
however
,
we
must
emphasise
that
,
to
allow
parent
ample
time
to
consider
the
school
option
,
a
20
-
month
gap
be
allow
between
the
announcement
of
this
measure
and
the
time
when
parent
need
to
apply
for
school
transport
.
child
who
wish
to
attend
the
same
school
as
they
old
sibling
but
who
be
not
eligible
for
school
transport
to
the
school
may
apply
for
transport
to
the
school
on
a
concessionary
basis
in
accordance
with
the
term
of
the
scheme
.
this
change
be
post
on
the
Department
's
website
in
October
2011
and
the
update
scheme
be
make
available
on
1
February
2012
.
the
Department
contact
post
-
primary
school
directly
on
two
occasion
in
addition
to
the
relevant
education
partner
formally
advise
they
of
the
change
.
with
regard
to
the
impact
of
the
change
,
the
deputy
may
be
aware
that
,
as
part
of
the
value
for
money
review
,
a
examination
be
conduct
of
selection
of
school
transport
catchment
boundary
which
test
the
application
of
a
arrangement
where
the
transport
be
available
to
the
near
post
-
primary
centre
.
this
conclude
that
82
%
of
the
pupil
be
attend
they
near
post
-
primary
school
.
in
general
,
exist
eligible
child
will
retain
they
eligibility
for
the
remainder
of
they
post
-
primary
education
provide
they
circumstance
do
not
change
.
the
revise
eligibility
criterion
be
confine
to
that
family
who
have
child
newly
enter
post
-
primary
school
.
this
change
in
eligibility
be
be
apply
equitably
on
a
national
basis
and
,
in
some
case
,
pupil
in
the
same
area
or
family
may
be
eligible
for
transport
to
different
school
during
the
transitional
period
of
five
year
.
in
this
case
,
transport
and
the
concessionary
basis
may
be
a
option
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
I
understand
the
issue
involve
concern
the
outcome
of
a
tendering
process
for
the
running
of
a
bar
in
Terminal
1
of
Dublin
Airport
.
the
Dublin
Airport
Authority
have
confirm
that
the
tender
process
for
the
outlet
in
question
be
conduct
through
the
official
Journal
of
the
European
Union
's
system
for
public
procurement
and
be
fully
compliant
with
all
guideline
.
the
tender
documentation
for
the
outlet
in
question
state
that
transfer
of
undertaking
legislation
may
apply
and
advise
potential
tenderer
to
seek
advice
on
such
legislation
.
the
restructuring
currently
under
way
at
a
number
of
outlet
be
a
matter
for
the
operator
in
question
.
I
be
not
privy
to
the
detail
of
transfer
or
the
party
involve
.
one
can
not
but
have
sympathy
for
that
involved
in
this
dispute
.
without
fudge
the
issue
and
in
seek
to
give
a
honest
answer
to
the
deputy
,
I
must
suggest
firmly
that
industrial
relation
machinery
need
to
come
into
play
on
this
issue
.
I
hope
both
side
will
agree
to
a
process
in
which
such
machinery
can
be
utilise
to
come
to
a
resolution
that
be
satisfactory
to
both
.
I
have
to
hand
a
very
detailed
response
on
the
rights
of
employee
in
regard
to
transfer
of
undertaking
but
I
do
not
believe
it
be
necessary
to
read
it
out
.
however
,
I
strongly
support
the
idea
that
labour
relation
machinery
should
be
utilise
in
this
instance
.
I
would
be
very
surprised
if
there
have
not
already
be
a
move
in
that
regard
.
I
agree
with
everything
deputy
Lyons
have
say
.
let
we
be
frank
and
honest
about
it
.
the
issue
at
hand
here
be
one
of
corporate
social
responsibility
,
a
term
we
bandy
around
from
time
to
time
and
can
use
quite
easily
.
if
there
be
a
transfer
of
undertaking
here
,
as
deputy
Lyons
state
,
it
say
something
about
the
morality
of
the
company
.
there
be
a
strong
sense
here
of
a
obligation
on
the
part
of
SPP
,
where
it
have
take
over
a
facility
in
what
be
,
effectively
,
a
state
entity
,
to
ensure
the
rights
of
the
worker
be
vindicate
or
at
least
that
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
experience
of
the
exist
staff
who
go
into
the
new
undertaking
.
in
this
instance
,
though
we
recognise
that
no
law
have
be
break
,
there
be
a
certain
corporate
social
responsibility
.
I
hope
that
common
sense
will
prevail
and
that
the
extensive
machinery
of
the
state
in
labour
relation
could
be
apply
in
this
instance
.
it
be
important
that
this
issue
be
raise
on
the
floor
of
this
House
also
.
it
send
a
signal
back
to
this
entity
that
this
matter
be
be
look
at
by
government
and
that
there
be
a
consciousness
in
this
house
of
the
issue
deputy
Lyons
raise
.
in
February
,
we
debate
the
budget
measure
in
regard
to
teacher
staffing
schedule
for
school
.
the
debate
over
the
past
two
evening
have
be
a
rerun
of
that
debate
.
while
deputy
Flanagan
's
Bill
be
well
intend
,
it
be
fundamentally
misconceive
.
I
do
not
say
that
in
a
disrespectful
way
.
the
proposal
the
deputy
advance
would
keep
school
open
even
if
there
be
not
enough
pupil
to
sustain
they
.
therefore
,
the
government
will
be
oppose
this
Bill
.
the
value
-
for
-
money
review
of
small
primary
school
,
currently
be
finalise
in
my
department
,
should
be
available
after
the
summer
recess
.
the
review
be
simply
about
evaluate
all
the
fact
to
inform
future
policy
in
this
area
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
will
publish
the
review
and
bring
it
before
this
House
so
we
can
have
a
wide
-
range
and
properly
inform
debate
on
its
outcome
and
proposal
.
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
one
third
of
public
sector
employee
in
the
State
work
in
the
education
sector
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
not
possible
to
exempt
staffing
in
education
completely
from
the
government
's
need
to
reduce
expenditure
.
this
be
particularly
the
case
at
a
time
when
the
school
-
go
population
be
increase
.
there
will
be
more
difficult

who
have
the
potential
to

who
would

newly

proposition
that
do
not

criterion

the
potential

proposal
will
be
the
dominant
factor
in

credit
decision
.
it

ultimately
be
for

so
it
will
be

lead
in

it

Delivery
of

support

business
planning

will

lay
before

the
deputy
refer
to
a
unique
case
.
there
be
a
code
of
practice
in
the
scheme
whereby
a
decision
must
be
make
within
two
week
or
15
day
-
I
will
have
to
check
the
exact
timeframe
.
the
core
principle
of
the
microenterprise
loan
fund
be
that
even
in
good
economic
circumstance
the
risk
criterion
might
not
be
meet
by
a
certain
coterie
of
people
,
such
as
the
person
to
whom
the
deputy
refer
.
they
might
be
credit
-
worthy
but
they
do
not
fit
within
the
banking
criterion
.
the
fund
be
design
for
people
in
that
position
.
give
that
the
local
body
will
then
feed
into
that
process
,
one
hope
there
will
be
a
fit
solution
for
such
people
so
they
will
not
have
to
incur
massive
administrative
cost
to
be
able
to
access
the
fund
so
they
can
start
they
business
.
it
will
be
within
two
year
.
I
be
bring
in
a
series
of
target
initiative
to
make
it
easy
for
micro-enterprise
and
small
and
medium
enterprise
to
access
credit
.
the
micro-enterprise
loan
fund
scheme
,
which
be
expect
to
be
operational
from
early
autumn
,
will
facilitate
up
to
€
40
million
in
additional
lending
to
micro-enterprise
over
the
next
five
year
.
the
government
be
in
the
process
of
introduce
the
temporary
partial
loan
guarantee
scheme
for
micro-enterprise
and
small
and
medium
enterprise
which
,
because
of
a
lack
of
collateral
or
the
sector
in
which
they
operate
,
face
difficulty
in
access
traditional
bank
credit
.
this
initiative
couple
with
the
recently
launch
second
call
under
the
innovation
fund
and
the
development
capital
scheme
will
strongly
contribute
to
address
the

need

modernisation

stage
of

up

to

report
,
a
demand
survey
show
that
only
36
%
of

seek

in
the
April
-
September
period

as
the
domestic
economy
recover
and

seek
to
increase

,
the
demand
for
lending
will
increase
and
two

will
point
to

the
ultimate
aim
be
to
drive
credit
through

the
relatively
poor

condition
of
some

of
the
factor

some
of

Irish
Bank
Resolution
Corporation

IBRC
,
will
seek
new
credit
and
will
need
to

to

.
if
that
bank
be
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide
that
credit
when
the
upturn
arrive
,
it
will
be
another
factor
.
if
the
deputy
will
bear
with
I
,
I
be
look
for
the
figure
.
the
economic
management
council
,
EMC
,
engage
with
the
bank
to
ensure
that
they
deliver
.
the
deputy
must
acknowledge
that
they
have
deliver
on
they
2011
lending
target
.
I
be
struggle
to
find
the
figure
on
the
percentage
in
term
of
credit
.
they
be
to
hand
.
the
report
compile
by
the
accounting
firm
Mazar
show
that
67
%
of
complete

by
the

represent
a
increase
of
2
%
on
the
previous
year
's
report
,
with
the
rate
of
refusal
fall
by
a
corresponding
amount
of
approximately
28
%
.
despite
the
downturn
,
the
report
indicate
that
some
company
be
still
in
a
position
to
protect
they
finances
from
potential

it
be
important
that
we
give
ISME
,
the
small

community
and
its
other
representative
organisation
they
due
regard
,
but
it
be
also
important
that
we
be
objective
in
we
interpretation
of
the
figure
.
if
one
drill
into
the
figure
,
one
will
realise
that
some
of
the
result
in
the
survey
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
base
on
media
perception
of
credit
.
it
be
important
that
we
assess
the
qualitative
criterion

can
be
take
to
optimise
the
potential
of
cloud
.
in
the
meantime
,
a
number
of
other
initiative
related
to
cloud
computing
be
under
way
,
include
under
the
action
plan
for
job
.
this
include
the
€
1.2
million
initial
research
programme
in
the
cloud
computing
technology
centre
announce
in
April
,
which
be
aim
at
help
to
make
Ireland
a
world
leader
in
this
fast
grow
area
and
at
make
a
significant
contribution
to
job
and
economic
growth
.
the
initiative
also
include
the
ICT
skill
action
plan
,
which
be
launch
early
this
year
and
include
the
provision
of
course
relevant
to
the
skill
require
for
the
cloud
computing
industry
.
the
National
Standard
Association
of
Ireland
,
with
the
assistance
and
support
of
the
Irish
Internet
Association
,
IIA
,
have
develop
the
SWiFT
10
guide
,
which
be
aim
at
business
of
all
size
consider
the
adoption
of
cloud
computing
.
additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
in
addition
,
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
have
place
information
on
its
website
which
will
be
useful
for
business
move
to
the
cloud
,
with
a
obvious
emphasis
on
the
datum
protection
issue
related
to
such
a
move
.
I
understand
the
public
sector
strategy
on
cloud
computing
be
close
to
finalisation
in
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
will
be
publish
shortly
.
yes
.
yes
.
I
agree
with
everything
the
deputy
have
say
.
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Howlin
,
be
engage
on
its
usefulness
for
reduce
cost
in
the
public
sector
and
there
be
much
concentration
on
this
in
the
wide
public
sector
.
membership
of
the
group
vary
from
people
involve
in
industry
to
that
in
the
Department
and
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
we
all
realise
its
value
and
we
know
who
in
industry
operate
in
this
sphere
,
for
example
EMC
in
my
area
.
there
be
a
strong
sense
the
cloud
computing
strategy
can
set
new
target
for
investment
in
digital
media
and
the
Internet
when
one
consider
exist
opportunity
for
technology
company
and
new
and
emerge
area
.
we
will
marry
with
this
the
potential
for
datum
centre
and
the
consideration
of
Ireland
for
potential
inward
investment
for
this
.
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
,
deputy
Pat
Rabbitte
,
have
specific
responsibility
for
this
area
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
deputy
have
engage
with
he
on
this
matter
,
but
I
suggest
he
do
so
because
he
would
get
a
definitive
answer
on
what
we
be
do
with
regard
to
broadband
.
for
the
purpose
of
address
the
issue
of
the
potential
of
cloud
computing
,
I
realise
certain
business
operate
in
certain
geographical
area
will
face
challenge
and
there
be
no
question
about
this
.
we
will
spend
€
1.2
million
on
a
initial
research
programme
and
a
cloud
computing
technology
centre
.
with
regard
to
the
potential
of
this
area
,
we
be
look
at
hit
global
research
target
and
pitch
Ireland
's
potential
globally
.
the
National
Standard
Authority
of
Ireland
have
adopt
the
SWiFT
10
guide
and
I
would
like
to
find
out
how
many
business
be
aware
of
this
at
present
.
if
we
can
build
consciousness
about
the
potential
of
cloud
computing
in
tandem
with
meet
the
challenge
with
regard
to
broadband
we
will
be
do
well
in
term
of
meet
global
measurement
.
if
the
deputy
be
concerned
about
a
specific
course
I
would
welcome
further
information
on
it
and
I
be
happy
to
speak
directly
to
he
on
this
matter
.
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
,
in
tandem
with
industry
,
have
develop
a
specific
course
on
this
.
Mr.
Bob
Savage
of
EMC
be
on
the
govern
body
of
CIT
so
one
be
confident
this
course
have
large
industry
buy
-
in
.
if
the
industry
have
problem
with
or
concern
about
course
we
need
to
hear
about
they
.
the
government
be
tackle
unemployment
generally
through
the
twin
strategy
of
the
action
plan
for
job
and
the
pathway
to
work
scheme
.
the
aim
of
the
action
plan
for
job
be
to
support
the
creation
of
100000
net
new
job
by
2016
,
while
the
objective
of
pathway
to
work
be
to
provide
that
who
be
unemployed
with
the
appropriate
training
and
skill
to
avail
of
the
job
opportunity
which
will
arise
as
the
economy
recover
.
the
long
-
term
unemployed
be
a
priority
target
group
for
the
measure
in
pathway
to
work
.
while
many
of
the
new
measure
include
in
the
action
plan
for
job
be
not
confine
to
that
who
be
long
-
term
unemployed
,
they
will
be
of
particular
relevance
to
they
need
.
for
example
,
the
microenterprise
loan
fund
will
provide
fund
for
people
who
wish
to
start
business
in
they
local
economy
but
have
be
refuse
credit
by
the
bank
.
other
measure
such
as
the
Revenue
job
assist
scheme
,
which
be
use
by
employer
to
take
on
person
who
be
long
-
term
unemployed
,
be
be
promote
both
by
extension
of
the
coverage
of
the
scheme
in
the
Finance
Bill
and
through
the
dissemination
of
information
.
the
employer
job
(
PRSI
)
incentive
scheme
have
be
simplify
and
extend
.
this
scheme
provide
exemption
from
the
payment
of
employer
prsi
contribution
for
18
month
when
a
qualify
unemployed
person
be
recruit
.
under
pathway
to
work
,
the
Department
of
social
Protection
be
commit
to
support
over
85000
job
placement
,
work
experience
and
back
to
education
beneficiary
this
year
,
include
through
the
JobBridge
internship
programme
.
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
have
announce
1000
additional
place
on
JobBridge
this
year
.
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
will
provide
more
than
450000
education
and
training
place
this
year
across
the
range
of
provision
in
the
high
education
,
further
education
and
training
sector
,
include
through
the
Springboard
programme
.
more
than
3500
people
have
graduate
from
the
first
round
of
Springboard
programme
,
which
be
put
in
place
in
2011
,
and
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
recently
announce
a
further
6000
new
place
on
the
programme
for
2012
.
we
all
acknowledge
that
over
the
past
year
this
country
have
go
through
major
restructuring
in
term
of
how
the
economy
work
.
the
minister
already
state
that
if
all
the
egg
be
in
one
sector
and
if
it
fail
,
it
have
a
monstrous
effect
on
the
economy
.
we
be
try
to
put
in
place
a
set
of
programme
which
will
allow
people
to
upskill
and
retrain
,
so
that
we
have
a
skillset
.
I
mention
the
number
of
construction
job
alone
which
be
lose
.
the
only
way
we
can
get
people
back
into
the
workforce
be
to
upskill
and
retrain
they
but
that
do
not
happen
within
one
,
two
or
three
month
.
we
must
allow
time
for
that
to
take
effect
.
all
side
of
the
House
must
acknowledge
-
let
we
be
apolitical
about
this
-
that
we
have
provide
incentive
on
the
Revenue
side
and
on
the
employer
side
and
we
have
allow
for
credit
to
be
make
available
through
the
micro-enterprise
partial
loan
guarantee
scheme
.
the
government
be
actively
intervene
to
try
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
to
create
the
right
condition
.
I
take
the
point
make
about
the
cost
to
business
and
a
reduction
in
the
regulatory
burden
.
I
would
acknowledge
that
we
need
to
do
more
on
EU
target
in
term
of
the
cost
of
the
regulatory
burden
but
I
would
also
say
there
be
a
discussion
at
cabinet
level
in
regard
to
local
authority
funding
and
the
cost
to
business
at
local
level
.
local
authority
cannot
continue
to
rely
,
in
the
way
they
have
do
,
on
the
ratepayer
who
have
be
squeeze
in
term
of
fund
local
government
.
the
cabinet
be
discuss
this
issue
.
however
,
one
must
acknowledge
that
because
of
the
tidal
wave
which
hit
we
as
a
result
of
the
collapse
in
the
construction
sector
,
in
particular
,
which
have
fuel
the
economy
,
we
have
to
restructure
the
economy
on
macroeconomic
grounds
and
put
in
place
this
type
of
programme
which
do
not
bear
fruit
in
the
timeframe
about
which
the
deputy
speak
.
it
will
take
long
.

in
November
2011
the
Minister
for
Finance
,
Michael
Noonan
,
TD
,
announce
a
new
seed
Capital
Scheme
(
SCS
)
to
encourage
individual
currently
or
formerly
in

business
venture
.
the
change
introduce
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
include
a
widening
of
the
type
of
company
eligible
under
the
scheme
.
this
widening
of
the
scope
of
the
scheme
remove
the
requirement
for
certification
by
Enterprise
Ireland
.
the
scheme
provide
for
a
refund
of

by
a
individual
who

the

,
which

who

the

be

the

not

there

for

there

at

to

the

criterion
for

in

say
,

would
be
very
different
from
the
application
criterion
for

.
however
,
in

with
the
recommendation
of
the
Research
Prioritisation
Steering
Group
's
report
,
for
the
purpose
of
competitive
call
for

,
research
funding
agency
will
be
adapt
they
application
process
to
the
stage
-
gate
process
.
this
mean
that
research
funder
will
consider
how
to
assess
relevance
to
,
and
impact
on
,
one
of
the
14
priority
area
of
opportunity
identify
as
likely
to
deliver
economic
and
societal
impact
.
while
obviously
recognise
the
need
to
allow
sufficient
flexibility
to
accommodate
the
outcome
require
by
specific
programme
,
it
be
envisage
that
agency
will
ensure
that
relevance
to
the
priority
area
be
one
of
the
key
criterion
in
assess
application
and
in
this
way
will
ensure
a
degree
of
consistency
across
agency
.
the
stage
gate
model
will
not
apply
to
in
-
company
R&D
funding
.
in
addition
,
the
Research
Prioritisation
Steering
Group
's
report
recommend
there
should
be
coherence
and
a
consistency
of
approach
between
funding
programme
to
reduce
the
administration
burden
on
both
agency
and
applicant
and
also
to
allow
for
system
level
evaluation
.
implementation
of
this
recommendation
will
be
consider
by
the
Prioritisation
Action
Group
in
as
part
of
its
ongoing
sequencing
of

the

of

be
to
develop
Ireland
's

in
strategic

while

note
that

in

funding
to

last
year
.
a
major
impact
attributable
to
SFI
have
be
,
and
continue
to
be
,
its
underpin
role
for
the
enterprise

creation
activity
of

.
SFI
fund
research
activity
be
focal
point

also
assist

collaborate

which
employ

over
the
past
number
of
year
the
SFI
investment
have
help
to
significantly
enhance

's

this
can
be
evidence
by
the
fact
that
in

the
value
of

foreign

approval
achieve
by
the
IDA
that

level
be

,
a

.
this
be
a
significant
indicator
of
the
strong
research
capacity
that
SFI
,
along
with
other
research
funder
,
have
help
to
develop
in
Ireland
in
recent
year
.
through
the
quality
of

human
capital
and
the
excellence
of
we
research
,
Ireland
have
succeed
in
attract
some
of
the
most
innovative
company
in
the
world
.
for
example
:
9
of
the
top
10
Pharmaceutical
company
in
the
world
now
have
operation
here
.
similarly
15
of
the
top
25
Medical
device
company
now
have
operation
in
Ireland
;
as
do
8
of
the
top
10
global
technology
company
;
and
10
of
the
world
's
top
sell
drug
be
produce
in
Ireland
.
in
term
of
SFI
activity
in
2012
,
the
capital
funding
provision
of

156
m
this
year
will
allow
the

to
maintain
its
support
to
28
top
-
class
research
centre
whilst
also
support
a
cohort
of
approximately
3000
researcher
position
.
this
matter
be
formally
review
by
my
Department
through
Forfás
which
commission
a
expert
report
by
consultant
Georgia
Tech
in
2001
to
examine
the
case
for
Irish
participation
in
a
number
of
intergovernmental
research
organisation
include
CERN
.
that
report
conclude
that
because
of
high
cost
and
limited
industrial
development
return
membership
should
not
be
pursue
at
that
time
.
since
then
,
of
course
,
the
severely
deplet
resource
which
this
government
inherit
have
mean
that
there
be
a
even
great
imperative
to
ensure
that
publicly
fund
research
and
development
will
yield
the
maximum
benefit
for
the
country
—
most
particularly
in
term
of
downstream
job
.
Ireland
's
membership
of
international
research
organisation
be
review
on
a
regular
basis
and
in
the
case
of
the
European
Space
Agency
,
for
example
,
the
value
of
membership
in
term
of
support
to
Irish
company
and
researcher
be
consider
to
justify
the
cost
of
we
membership
.
CERN
be
a
major
international
project
which
deservedly
have
receive
much
attention
in
recent
week
arise
from
major
and
exciting
discovery
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
Irish
researcher
be
not
preclude
from
participate
in
and
benefit
from
the
work
be
do
at
CERN
.
in
a
ideal
world
,
of
course
it
would
be
desirable
to
be
involved
in
this
major
project
,
base
in
Europe
as
it
be
.
the
issue
be
whether
we
should
divert
very
scarce
,
and
in
most
case
commit
funding
,
away
from
the
area
that
we
have
identify
as
have
the
good
chance
of
contribute
to
we
economic
recovery
.
the
cost
of
full
membership
be
understand
to
be
over
€
10
m
per
annum
.
while
other
associate
membership
option
may
be
available
involve
less
amount
,
the
issue
remain
that
a
decision
about
join
CERN
must
take
into
consideration
the
opportunity
cost
involve
as
payment
of
any
fee
would
mean
that
less
funding
be
available
for
we
exist
research
priority
.
should
budgetary
circumstance
change
the
matter
could
be
review
again
but
only
if
there
be
a
compelling
business
case
from
a
cost
/
benefit
viewpoint
.

information
available

I
thank

O'Connor
for

this
matter

the

of
selection
criterion

process

medical
school
be
a
matter
for
the
university
and
the
medical
school
in
line
with
they
statutory
autonomy
in
academic
affair
.
a
new
entry
process
for
admission
to
medical
school
be
introduce
in
2009
on
foot
of
a
recommendation
of
the
Fottrell
working
group
on
undergraduate
medical
education
and
training
.
the
report
of
the
Fottrell
working

form
the
basis
for
a
programme
of
wide
range
reform
and
expansion
of
medical

this
reform
also
provide
for
a
increase

to
485
and
the
introduction
of
a
new
graduate
entry
medicine
programme
with
240
place
annually
.
the
report
recommend
that
leave
certificate
result
should
no
long
be
the
sole
selection
method
for
entry
to
medical
education
at
undergraduate
level
and
that
a
two
stage
mechanism
should
be
apply
consist
of
the
result
obtain
in
leave
certificate
and
a
standardise
admission
test
which
would
assess
non-academic
skill
and
attribute
regard
as
important
for
the
practice
of
medicine
.
the
new
entry
mechanism
,
which
be
introduce
by
the
medical
school
in
2009
,
be
base
on
a
combination
of
leave
certificate
result
and
performance
in
a
independent
admission
test
,
HPAT
,
design
to
measure
student

problem
solving

understanding
and
reasoning
skill

at
the
outset
the
medical
school
commit
to
a
review
of
the
new

mechanism
within

year
of

more
generally
with

,
the

the

this
issue
.

articulate
they
in

I
be
sure
the

I
would

delighted
to
engage
with
she
further
on
the
question
of
Project
Maths
,
or
at

have
official
engage
with
she
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
would
be
happy
to
sit
down
with
she
to
discuss
this
area
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
the
tenor
in
which
he
make
he
contribution
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
late
quarterly
national
household
survey
,
QNHS
,
figure
show
a
increase
in
unemployment
,
but
we
never
say
recovery
would
be
fast
or
easy
.
the
government
inherit
a
job
market
in
free
fall
with
more
than
250000
private
sector
job
lose
in
the
three
year
before
we
take
office
.
that
be
not
a
political
charge
;
it
be
a
fact
.
at
the
peak
of
the
boom
,
almost
24
%
of
GNP
be
attributable
to
construction
,
12
%
of
total
employment
.
the
economy
be
in
transition
and
since
assume
office
,
we
have
deliver
on
the
plan
to
build
a
new
economy
.
part
of
this
be
support
a
transition
from
the
old
fail
economy
base
on
property
,
banking
and
debt
to
a
new
sustainable
economy
base
on
enterprise
,
export
and
innovation
.
the
cabinet
sub
-
committee
on
economic
recovery
and
job
,
through
the
action
plan
for
job
,
have
direct
identifiable
target
that
be
address
directly
with
the
Taoiseach
on
a
regular
basis
use
that
reporting
mechanism
.
part
of
that
process
involve
the
small
business
advisory
group
,
which
include
all
of
stakeholder
,
such
as
ISME
and
IBEC
.
they
be
part
of
the
process
of
get
the
recovery
we
so
badly
need
.
deputy
Calleary
mention
the
skill
shortage
.
there
be
a
constant
engagement
with
industry
.
I
meet
with
Google
the
day
before
yesterday
to
see
how
we
could
get
a
further
engagement
with
such
company
on
the
STEM
area
and
that
will
directly
feed
into
how
we
address
the
skill
shortage
.
there
be
already
programme
in
play
in
term
of
bridging
course
but
we
must
ensure
there
be
a
long
term
policy
goal
that
ensure
we
have
a
throughput
of
student
from
secondary
into
tertiary
who
be
actively
engage
in
the
STEM
agenda
,
through
course
such
as
project
math
,
so
the
right
sort
of
software
engineer
and
ICT
graduate
exist
for
the
skill
pool
need
to
sustain
the
economy
in
the
long
term
.
unfortunately
,
as
part
of
the
necessary
transition
,
job
continue
to
be
lose
in
construction
,
banking
and
the
public
sector
as
this
sector
return
to
more
realistic
level
.
while
the
headline
number
out
of
work
have
risen
in
the
late
return
,
the
CSO
datum
show
that
,
on
a
seasonally
adjust
basis
,
there
be
a
quarterly
decrease
of
3700
in
the
number
of
person
unemployed
in
quarter
two
compare
to
quarter
one
,
from
312000
to
309000
.
we
be
in
a
period
of
transformation
of
the
public
sector
as
a
necessary
step
to
manage
we
public
finances
in
a
good
way
.
the
number
of
employee
in
the
public
sector
have
decline
by
25,800
or
6.3
%
in
the
year
to
June
2012
while
the
number
of
employee
in
the
private
sector
decrease
by
0.3
%
over
the
same
period
.
this
be
a
improvement
on
the
decrease
of
2.2
%
in
that
employ
in
the
private
sector
in
the
previous
year
.
the
deputy
have
stand
where
I
be
stand
today
and
know
I
will
not
be
draw
on
the
budgetary
process
.
let
I
talk
,
however
,
about
the
EU
Presidency
.
one
of
the
central
theme
of
the
Irish
EU
Presidency
will
be
job
creation
.
there
will
be
statement
on
Ireland
's
position
on
get
Europe
to
engage
on
this
agenda
in
due
course
.
the
planning
be
ongoing
and
this
week
there
be
a
cabinet
sub
-committee
on
European
affair
where
each
of
the
Minister
and
Minister
of
State
involve
have
a
opportunity
to
discuss
the
EU
Presidency
and
the
core
theme
we
want
to
ensure
be
at
the
forefront
.
job
creation
and
growth
with
the
European
economy
will
form
part
of
that
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
on
the
public
utterance
of
Ben
Bernanke
on
the
US
Federal
Reserve
.
there
be
a
different
dynamic
in
the
US
because
it
operate
on
a
federal
basis
.
there
be
a
challenge
for
a
member
state
like
Ireland
to
ensure
great
EU
co-ordination
but
it
be
the
government
's
view
that
the
role
of
job
creation
must
be
to
the
forefront
of
the
Irish
Presidency
.
Horizon
2020
be
a
major
pot
of
money
,
around
€
80
billion
,
that
must
be
negotiate
,
along
with
the
multiannual
financial
framework
.
there
be
many
Irish
company
that
will
ultimately
benefit
from
that
once
it
be
negotiate
.
it
will
do
more
to
inject
further
capital
into
the
research
and
development
arm
of
Irish
company
and
sme
in
particular
to
create
that
job
that
we
want
in
the
economy
.
there
be
much
to
be
do
on
the
macroeconomic
side
.
I
reiterate
,
however
,
that
the
action
plan
for
job
be
a
clear
policy
statement
by
the
government
that
involve
all
of
the
stakeholder
,
include
small
business
,
IBEC
and
so
on
.
that
will
be
a
key
driver
for
job
creation
in
the
future
.

record

I
thank
deputy

we

move

every

.
we
be
also

the

in

the

work
closely
with

and
the

I
refer
the
deputy
to
page
68
and
69
of
the
third
progress
report
,
which
speak
further
to
the
issue
raise
by
he
.
it
be
hard
not
to
agree
with
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
in
relation
the
banking
sector
.
a
distinction
must
be
make
between
business

to
restructure
loan
in
order
to
survive
and
retain
they
viability
and
loan
generate
for
new
business
.
I
refer
the
deputy
to
the
Action
plan
for
Jobs
2012
and
the
third
progress
report
which
state
that
the
Department
of
Finance
publish
the
SME
lending
demand
survey
in
July
.
that
survey
of
1,505
company
show
that
during
the
six
month
period
survey
demand
for
credit
remain
low
,
with
only
38
%
of
sme
request
bank
credit
between
October
2011
to
March
2012
.
the
full
survey
and
finding
be
available
on
the
Department
of
Finance
website
.
I
take
on
board
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
in
relation
to
the
person
reference
specifically
by
he
.
I
believe
the
Taoiseach
address
that
point
today
during
leader
's
question
.
this
be
about
drive
new
relationship
between
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
pillar
bank
.
the
economic
Management
Council
have
already
indicate
it
will
meet
the
pillar
bank
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
there
be
no
question
that
there
be
a
sense
the
bank
be
not
come
forward
with
proposal
base
on
a
lateral
view
of
how
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
person
reference
by
the
deputy
who
may
have
a
viable
business
.
the
government
be
try
to
press
home
this
point
to
the
bank
.
there
be
a
role
for
the
economic
Management
Council
.
the
two
initiative
,
on
micro-enterprise
and
the
partial
loan
credit
guarantee
scheme
,
will
create
a
new
pillar
of
lending
and
will
be
government
back
.
this
will
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
on
the
sme
sector
of
the
economy
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
it
as
it
provide
I
with
a
opportunity
to
clarify
the
position
on
the
application
for
additional
accommodation
receive
from
Millstreet
Convent
national
school
,
County
Cork
.
it
be
a
co-educational
primary
school
catering
for
boy
and
girl
from
junior
infant
to
second
class
and
for
girl
only
from
third
to
sixth
class
.
I
be
aware
the
school
have
218
enrol
pupil
in
September
2011
and
that
the
current
enrolment
be
244
pupil
,
as
the
deputy
outline
.
I
understand
the
school
expect
enrolment
to
increase
further
next
September
2013
.
on
5
October
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
receive
a
application
from
the
school
for
the
provision
of
one
additional
mainstream
classroom
and
two
learning
support
room
to
meet
its
current
need
.
in
addition
,
the
Department
receive
a
further
application
from
the
school
on
15
October
for
major
capital
funding
to
provide
additional
mainstream
classroom
to
cater
for
the
school
's
project
long
term
enrolment
.
in
this
regard
,
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
will
examine
the
demographic
of
the
area
concerned
.
the
analysis
will
take
into
account
result
from
census
2011
,
child
benefit
datum
for
the
area
and
a
examination
of
current
school
enrolment
with
a
view
to
establish
future
accommodation
requirement
for
the
area
.
the
school
's
application
will
be
assess
in
the
context
of
the
Department
's
analysis
of
need
in
the
area
and
a
decision
on
the
application
will
be
convey
to
the
school
authority
subsequently
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
five
year
programme
which
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
announce
on
12
March
2012
will
provide
more
than
100000
permanent
school
place
,
of
which
80000
will
be
new
school
place
.
the
remainder
will
be
the
replacement
of
temporary
or
unsatisfactory
accommodation
.
where
a
immediate
enrolment
need
in
a
area
have
be
identify
,
such
as
the
appointment
of
a
additional
teacher
,
and
where
a
school
's
exist
accommodation
cannot
provide
for
this
growth
,
the
Department
consider
application
by
school
for
capital
funding
for
additional
classroom
,
mainly
on
a
devolve
basis
.
the
delivery
of
new
school
,
together
with
extension
project
to
meet
future
demand
,
will
be
the
main
focus
of
the
Department
's
budget
for
the
come
year
.
I
note
the
deputy
's
concern
in
this
regard
and
the
point
he
have
make
on
the
school
's
develop
school
status
.
I
reiterate
that
the
Department
will
be
in
contact
with
the
school
when
the
demographic
analysis
in
the
area
have
be
complete
.
if
,
through
the
good
office
of
the
deputy
,
the
board
of
management
be
to
contact
I
directly
,
I
would
be
happy
to
engage
with
the
school
,
subject
to
all
of
the
criterion
,
particularly
the
budgetary
criterion
,
lay
down
in
that
regard
.
perhaps
we
can
take
a
look
at
this
with
a
view
to
solve
the
problem
without
give
any
false
hope
at
this
stage
.
I
would
be
happy
to
visit
the
school
if
such
a
invitation
be
extend
to
I
.
I
be
not
make
any
promise
but
there
may
be
way
around
this
.
it
be
important
that
the
Department
have
the
opportunity
to
complete
the
vital
demographic
study
.

be

the

in

perhaps
the

might
debate
what
Sinn

be

Sinn

economic

for

twenty

and
the
six

he
should
table
a

on

the

I
be
much
close

people
than
the
deputy
believe
.
be
that
George

,
the
former
member
?
it
be
good
grub
too
.
I
have
taste
it
.
what
be
the
deputy
insinuating
?
the
Minister
of
State
will
agree
that
when
the
government
take
office
there
be
a
real
sense
of
hope
that
the
change
promise
by
both
the
Labour
Party
and
Fine
Gael
prior
to
the
election
would
herald
a
change
in
the
economic
direction
this
State
be
take
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
challenge
face
the
government
be
significant
,
and
no
one
will
underestimate
this
.
we
economic
sovereignty
have
be
hand
over
to
outside
force
by
Fianna
Fáil
,
a
fact
we
should
never
forget
.
some
of
the
individual
who
sit
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
and
lecture
we
in
the
Chamber
be
the
very
people
who
ruin
this
economy
,
bankrupt
the
State
and
drive
large
number
of
we
citizen
into
poverty
.
now
they
speak
as
if
they
have
be
sit
on
the
Opposition
bench
for
the
past
14
year
.
they
take
no
responsibility
for
what
they
have
do
.
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
they
have
no
moral
,
integrity
or
credibility
.
they
implement
policy
to
serve
they
own
selfish
political
agenda
and
for
no
other
reason
,
a
fact
we
should
never
let
they
forget
.
some
Fianna
Fáil
member
who
have
leave
the
House
live
on
huge
pension
while
the
policy
they
implement
have
force
many
of
we
people
into
income
poverty
,
mortgage
debt
and
tough
decision
over
whether
to
put
food
on
the
table
or
pay
a
electricity
bill
.
that
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
legacy
.
some
of
its
member
who
preach
to
all
side
in
the
Chamber
should
take
a
long
hard
look
in
the
mirror
and
think
before
they
open
they
mouth
.
as
we
now
approach
the
second
budget
of
this
Fine
Gael
-
Labour
Party
government
,
people
be
begin
to
lose
hope
that
it
will
bring
about
the
change
it
promise
.
some
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
have
already
be
renege
on
,
such
as
that
of
tackle
upward
-
only
rent
review
.
the
long
this
go
on
,
the
more
despondent
people
become
.
it
be
the
responsibility
not
just
of
the
government
but
of
the
Opposition
to
put
forward
credible
alternative
and
give
that
suffering
in
we
society
some
sense
of
hope
.
most
country
that
go
through
a
recession
recognise
the
importance
of
education
and
will
protect
funding
for
the
sector
.
they
recognise
it
have
a
key
role
in
the
recovery
of
any
economy
and
in
ensure
young
people
and
that
on
the
dole
be
give
the
skill
and
training
to
get
they
into
employment
and
contribute
to
economic
recovery
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
aware
there
be
a
protest
early
today
outside
Leinster
House
by
several
teacher
union
at
which
they
voice
they
concern
and
disgust
at
the
number
of
cut
to
the
education
sector
in
previous
budget
.
the
change
to
the
income
of
new
-
entrant
teacher
be
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
morale
.
many
of
they
be
now
face
with
the
prospect
of
earn
significantly
less
than
teacher
who
enter
the
profession
two
year
ago
.
give
that
this
be
the
individual
we
be
ask
to
assume
responsibility
for
educate
the
next
generation
of
citizen
upon
whom
we
will
rely
for
recovery
of
the
economy
,
it
be
a
shame
the
government
have
see
fit
to
target
they
income
.
it
be
a
detrimental
step
and
one
for
which
we
will
suffer
in
the
long
term
.
it
also
show
the
lack
of
importance
of
education
for
the
government
.
for
the
forthcoming
budget
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
have
say
up
to
€
77
million
will
have
to
come
out
of
the
education
budget
.
over
the
next
two
year
,
the
total
reduction
will
come
to
€
147
million
.
this
figure
exclude
cut
announce
in
last
year
's
budget
,
such
as
the
multi-annual
reduction
in
capitation
grant
.
this
type
of
cut
will
impact
on
the
quality
of
education
provide
in
we
school
and
university
.
there
be
no
way
of
skirt
around
this
issue
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Alex
White
,
will
agree
with
that
,
although
he
may
not
say
it
publicly
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
have
say
he
be
do
everything
he
can
to
ensure
front
-
line
service
be
protect
.
however
,
it
be
just
not
possible
to
take
that
amount
of
funding
out
of
a
education
budget
without
affect
front
-
line
service
or
the
quality
of
education
provision
.
I
have
no
doubt
the
minister
have
a
tough
job
and
be
face
some
significant
challenge
in
the
sector
.
however
,
it
be
not
just
he
responsibility
to
protect
education
.
it
be
the
responsibility
of
all
member
of
the
cabinet
to
put
a
special
emphasis
on
the
protection
of
the
education
budget
.
that
be
the
budget
that
have
a
potential
impact
on
we
opportunity
to
regain
we
economic
sovereignty
.
school
be
now
be
force
to
ask
parent
,
who
be
already
face
really
hard
choice
in
they
own
personal
finances
,
for
voluntary
contribution
to
balance
they
budget
due
to
cut
to
capitation
grant
.
I
have
see
letter
from
school
,
particularly
primary
school
,
in
Cork
ask
parent
for
they
child
to
bring
in
basic
essential
such
as
toilet
roll
and
hand
-
wash
.
they
be
also
ask
to
take
home
unfinished
lunch
and
paring
from
pencil
because
the
school
cannot
afford
to
empty
they
bin
.
I
implore
the
government
to
ensure
the
education
budget
be
protect
in
the
forthcoming
budget
.
if
the
plan
cut
of
€
77
million
go
ahead
,
there
be
no
doubt
the
cost
of
send
kid
to
school
will
increase
,
and
this
cost
will
have
to
be
borne
by
already
hard
-
press
parent
struggle
to
make
end
meet
.
it
should
be
remember
they
will
also
face
cut
in
other
area
such
as
social
welfare
.
I
hope
the
Minister
of
State
will
highlight
to
he
party
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
the
need
to
ensure
the
education
budget
cut
be
temper
as
much
as
possible
.
the
Minister
of

will
agree
that
when

there

we

hand

some
of
the
individual
who
sit
on

we
in

be
the
very
people
who
ruin
this
economy
,
bankrupt
the
State
and
drive
large
number
of
we
citizen
into
poverty
.
now
they
speak
as
if
they
have
be
sit
on
the
Opposition
bench
for
the
past
14
year
.
they
take
no
responsibility
for
what
they
have
do
.
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
they
have
no
moral
,
integrity
or
credibility
.
they
implement
policy
to
serve
they
own
selfish
political
agenda
and
for
no
other
reason
,
a
fact
we
should
never
let
they
forget
.
some
Fianna

member
who
have
leave
the

live
on
huge
pension
while
the
policy
they
implement
have
force
many
of

poverty
,
mortgage
debt

tough

over
whether

that
be
Fianna

some
of
its

should
take
a
long

look

the
long
this
go
on

the
more
despondent
people
become
.
it
be
the
responsibility
not

of
the
Opposition
to
put

credible
alternative

for

the

over

this
figure
exclude
cut
announce
in

such
as
the
multi-annual

this

there
be
no
way
of

the

with
that
,
although
he
may
not

it
publicly

the

have
say
he
be
do
everything
he
can

however
,
it

not

I
have
no

the

however
,
it

it

the

I
have
see

in
Cork
ask

for

to
bring
in
basic

they
be
also
ask
to
take
home
unfinished

and
paring
from

because
the
school
cannot

I
implore

be
protect
in
the
forthcoming

if
the
plan
cut
of
€
77

go
ahead
,
there
be
no

the

this

the

it

of

to
put

credible

give
that
suffering

we
should
never
let
they
forget
.
some
Fianna
Fáil
member
who
have
leave
the
House
live
on
huge
pension
while
the
policy
they
implement
have
force
many
of
we
people
into
income
poverty
,
mortgage
debt
and
tough
decision
over
whether
to
put
food
on
the
table
or
pay
a
electricity
bill
.
that
be
Fianna
Fáil
's
legacy
.
some
of
its
member
who
preach
to
all
side
in
the
Chamber
should
take
a
long
hard
look
in
the
mirror
and
think
before
they
open
they
mouth
.
as
we
now
approach
the
second
budget
of
this
Fine
Gael
-
Labour
Party
government
,
people
be
begin
to
lose
hope
that
it
will
bring
about
the
change
it
promise
.
some
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
have
already
be
renege
on
,
such
as
that
of
tackle
upward
-
only
rent
review
.
the
long
this
go
on
,
the
more
despondent
people
become
.
it
be
the
responsibility
not
just
of
the
government
but
of
the
Opposition
to
put
forward
credible
alternative
and
give
that
suffering
in
we
society
some
sense
of
hope
.
most
country
that
go
through
a
recession
recognise
the
importance
of
education
and
will
protect
funding
for
the
sector
.
they
recognise
it
have
a
key
role
in
the
recovery
of
any
economy
and
in
ensure
young
people
and
that
on
the
dole
be
give
the
skill
and
training
to
get
they
into
employment
and
contribute
to
economic
recovery
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
be
aware
there
be
a
protest
early
today
outside
Leinster
House
by
several
teacher
union
at
which
they
voice
they
concern
and
disgust
at
the
number
of
cut
to
the
education
sector
in
previous
budget
.
the
change
to
the
income
of
new
-
entrant
teacher
be
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
morale
.
many
of
they
be
now
face
with
the
prospect
of
earn
significantly
less
than
teacher
who
enter
the
profession
two
year
ago
.
give
that
this
be
the
individual
we
be
ask
to
assume
responsibility
for
educate
the
next
generation
of
citizen
upon
whom
we
will
rely
for
recovery
of
the
economy
,
it
be
a
shame
the
government
have
see
fit
to
target
they
income
.
it
be
a
detrimental
step
and
one
for
which
we
will
suffer
in
the
long
term
.
it
also
show
the
lack
of
importance
of
education
for
the
government
.
for
the
forthcoming
budget
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
have
say
up
to
€
77
million
will
have
to
come
out
of
the
education
budget
.
over
the
next
two
year
,
the
total
reduction
will
come
to
€
147
million
.
this
figure
exclude
cut
announce
in
last
year
's
budget
,
such
as
the
multi-annual
reduction
in
capitation
grant
.
this
type
of
cut
will
impact
on
the
quality
of
education
provide
in
we
school
and
university
.
there
be
no
way
of
skirt
around
this
issue
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Alex
White
,
will
agree
with
that
,
although
he
may
not
say
it
publicly
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
have
say
he
be
do
everything
he
can
to
ensure
front
-
line
service
be
protect
.
however
,
it
be
just
not
possible
to
take
that
amount
of
funding
out
of
a
education
budget
without
affect
front
-
line
service
or
the
quality
of
education
provision
.
I
have
no
doubt
the
minister
have
a
tough
job
and
be
face
some
significant
challenge
in
the
sector
.
however
,
it
be
not
just
he
responsibility
to
protect
education
.
it
be
the
responsibility
of
all
member
of
the
cabinet
to
put
a
special
emphasis
on
the
protection
of
the
education
budget
.
that
be
the
budget
that
have
a
potential
impact
on
we
opportunity
to
regain
we
economic
sovereignty
.
school
be
now
be
force
to
ask
parent
,
who
be
already
face
really
hard
choice
in
they
own
personal
finances
,
for
voluntary
contribution
to
balance
they
budget
due
to
cut
to
capitation
grant
.
I
have
see
letter
from
school
,
particularly
primary
school
,
in
Cork
ask
parent
for
they
child
to
bring
in
basic
essential
such
as
toilet
roll
and
hand
-
wash
.
they
be
also
ask
to
take
home
unfinished
lunch
and
paring
from
pencil
because
the
school
cannot
afford
to
empty
they
bin
.
I
implore
the
government
to
ensure
the
education
budget
be
protect
in
the
forthcoming
budget
.
if
the
plan
cut
of
€
77
million
go
ahead
,
there
be
no
doubt
the
cost
of
send
kid
to
school
will
increase
,
and
this
cost
will
have
to
be
borne
by
already
hard
-
press
parent
struggle
to
make
end
meet
.
it
should
be
remember
they
will
also
face
cut
in
other
area
such
as
social
welfare
.
I
hope
the
Minister
of
State
will
highlight
to
he
party
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
the
need
to
ensure
the
education
budget
cut
be
temper
as
much
as
possible
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
agree
that
when
the
government
take
office
there
be
a
real
sense
of
hope
that
the
change
promise
by
both
the
Labour
Party
and
Fine
Gael
prior
to
the
election
would
herald
a
change
in
the
economic
direction
this
State
be
take
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
challenge
face
the
government
be
significant
,
and
no
one
will
underestimate
this
.
we
economic
sovereignty
have
be
hand
over
to
outside
force
by
Fianna
Fáil
,
a
fact
we
should
never
forget
.
some
of
the
individual
who
sit
on
the
Fianna
Fáil
bench
and
lecture
we
in
the
Chamber
be
the
very
people
who
ruin
this
economy
,
bankrupt
the
State
and
drive
large
number
of
we
citizen
into
poverty
.
now
they
speak
as
if
they
have
be
sit
on
the
Opposition
bench
for
the
past
14
year
.
they
take
no
responsibility
for
what
they
have
do
.
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
they
have
no
moral
,
integrity
or
credibility
.
they
implement
policy
to
serve
they
own
selfish
political
agenda
and
for
no
other
reason
,
a
fact
we
should
never

I
thank
the
Deputy
for
raise
this
important
matter
.
a
new
,
fully
centralise
student
grant
application
system
be
launch
on
11
June
and
be
be
operate
by
a
central
grant
awarding
authority
,
the
Student
Universal
support
Ireland
,
which
be
know
by
the
wonderful
acronym
SUSI
and
which
have
be
establish
as
a
unit
of
the
city
of
Dublin
VEC
.
until
last
year
,
student
apply
to
66
local
authority
and
vec
for
grant
assistance
.
this
be
the
first
time
the
centralised
approach
have
be
take
in
the
history
of
the
State
.
deputy
be
aware
of
the
difficulty
with
which
this
body
have
be
deal
with
the
major
increase
in
number
apply
for
student
grant
in
recent
year
.
the
new
facility
automate
and
replace
the
previous
manual
application
arrangement
with
a
centralise
online
system
application
for
all
new
grant
application
nationwide
from
this
academic
year
onwards
.
the
system
have
be
design
in
such
a
way
as
to
guide
student
interactively
through
the
application
process
.
under
the
old
system
,
the
majority
of
third
level
student
be
pay
by
cheque
,
a
costly
and
inefficient
way
of
make
payment
.
under
SUSI
,
student
will
be
pay
monthly
directly
into
they
bank
account
.
this
lead
to
all
SUSI
grant
applicant
in
a
institution
receive
payment
in
the
same
way
,
by
electronic
fund
transfer
.
SUSI
have
receive
in
excess
of
66000
complete
application
for
student
grant
this
year
.
some
18000
application
be
complete
,
include
9000
application
that
have
be
refuse
and
9000
application
that
have
be
award
or
award
pend
submission
of
final
course
detail
by
the
student
.
in
addition
,
SUSI
be
await
documentation
from
student
for
21000
application
.
the
remain
27000
application
be
on
hand
for
processing
.
SUSI
be
aim
to
award
and
pay
all
successful
applicant
before
the
end
of
December
,
which
represent
a
significant
improvement
on
the
previous
system
in
many
part
of
the
country
.
to
date
,
some
6528
new
student
have
be
award
maintenance
or
fee
only
grant
.
a
maintenance
grant
have
be
award
to
2190
student
,
and
some
3729
student
be
await
a
maintenance
payment
.
the
payment
of
the
student
grant
be
contingent
on
the
supply
of
bank
account
detail
by
the
student
,
together
with
confirmation
of
registration
from
the
institution
attend
.
payment
for
new
student
commence
on
19
October
,
and
SUSI
will
continue
to
run
weekly
payment
during
November
to
ensure
student
receive
they
first
payment
as
soon
as
possible
.
it
be
inevitable
that
a
late
rush
of
application
will
cause
delay
in
a
student
grant
processing
system
and
the
subsequent
payment
of
student
grant
.
my
Department
be
continue
to
monitor
the
situation
in
close
consultation
with
SUSI
,
which
be
work
with
the
Union
of
student
in
Ireland
to
encourage
student
to
submit
outstanding
documentation
.
SUSI
be
also
constantly
seek
to
improve
the
information
available
online
and
from
its
helpdesk
,
e-mail
and
telephone
service
.
SUSI
be
await
documentation
on
21000
application
.
some
15000
student
have
not
respond
to
request
for
documentation
and
a
further
6000
have
submit
incomplete
documentation
.
I
acknowledge
the
remain
27000
application
be
on
hand
for
processing
-----
no
amount
of
rhetorical
flourish
,
rhetoric
or
nonsense
from
a
Fianna
Fáil
deputy
will
change
the
fact
that
SUSI
have
the
administrative
responsibility
for
the
area
.
there
be
broad
political
support
for
the
idea
of
have
one
centralise
system
because
of
the
lag
time
,
which
be
even
late
within
the
66
local
authority
heretofore
.
in
the
first
year
of
the
roll
-
out
of
the
new
system
,
one
always
get
glitch
-----
-----
but
the
main
point
be
that
student
eligible
for
grant
will
be
pay
.
there
be
no
question
about
it
.
the
Department
bring
in
the
USI
as
a
stakeholder
in
the
process
to
act
as
a
moderator
on
www.boards.ie
to
engage
with
student
through
the
process
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
that
27000
application
be
outstanding
and
should
be
expedite
.
a
additional
20
staff
member
be
process
the
documentation
receive
from
student
,
and
extra
staff
have
also
be
assign
to
SUSI
head
office
to
work
on
continually
improve
the
process
and
speed
up
processing
time
.
I
ask
for
common
sense
to
deal
with
this
calmly
and
rationally
,
not
to
seek
to
score
political
point
.
the

on

a
number
of
development
will
impact
on

in

during
the
come

year
.
first
,
the
commencement
of

of
the

will
prohibit
the
payment
of
people

as
teacher
in
recognise
school
unless
they
be

with
the
Teaching

.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
in
this
regard
.
the
second
major
development
will
be
enhance
requirement
from
April
2013
for
registration
with
the
Teaching
Council
as
a
further
education
teacher
.
the
requirement
for

will
be
increase
from
a

to
a
requirement
to
hold
a
teacher

at
the
time
to
seek
registration
with
the

and
to
ensure
that
they

.
if
such
people
avail
of
this
entitlement
at
the
time
and
subsequently
maintain

,
there
be
no
change
to

.
a
dispensation

at
the
time
and
there
be
no
basis
for
it
to
be
give
again
.
it
have
be
the
policy
of
the
Department
of
Education
and

for
some
time
that
only
qualified
and
register
teacher
should
be
employ
by
school

ensure
that

to

with
the
Teaching
Council
and
have
qualification
appropriate
to
the
sector
and
suitable
to
the
post
for
which
they
be
propose
.
since
2006
,
any
unregistered
person
employ
by
a
vec
in
a
teaching
post
have
be
on
notice
that
,
once
section
30
become
law
,
there
would
be
no
basis
to
continue
pay
he
or
she
.
therefore
,
such
person
can
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
continue
employment
beyond
the
period
of
time
that
it
take
the
school
to
source
a
register
teacher
.
it
be
expect
that
section
30
will
be
commence
late
in
the
school
year
.
this
will
ensure
that
only
register
teacher
be
employ
in

position
in

school
.
Separate
provision
will
be
make
for

situation
where
no

be
available
.
notice
of
the
imminent
commencement
of
section
30
and
the
Teaching
Council
's
registration
requirement
have
be
in
the
public
domain
for
some
time
.
sufficient
time
have
be
available
for
individual
to
engage
with
the
Teaching
Council
to
gain
registration
.
it
be
the
government
's
view
that
all
teacher
should
be
appropriately
qualified
.
this
be
surely
the
minimum
that
we
child
deserve
.
the
commencement
of
section
30
be
intend
to
buttress
that
policy
and
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
ensure
a
quality

that
this
be
a
technical
issue
,
it
be
important
that
my

the

where

,
have
allow

have

as

as

,
he

to

in

will
be

to
the
kind
of

which
will
be
permissible
under
the
ministerial
regulation
.
from
1
April
2013
,
under
the
Teaching
Council
registration
regulation
2009
,
the
threshold
for
entry
on
the
registry
will
increase
in
all
category
of
registration
.
since
the
Department
have
already
set
registration
as
a
requirement
for
employment
in
the
above
circular
,
this
high
threshold
apply
automatically
in
term
of
employment
from
1
April
next
independently
of
the
section

.
the
commencement
of

will
reinforce
the
Department
's
longstanding
position
that
education
in

by
the
State
must
be
deliver
by
appropriately
regulate
professional
.
I
do
not
think
anybody
would
argue
against
that
.
this
position
must
be
maintain
in
the
interest
of
provide
the
good
possible
education
for
the
very
student
about
whom
we
be
talk
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
which
I
be
take
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
.
the
fact
the
deputy
raise
it
give
we
a
opportunity
to
clarify
the
current
position
in
regard
to
the
application
for
additional
accommodation
at
Lanesboro
community
college
,
Lanesboro
,
County
Longford
.
I
be
aware
that
enrolment
at
the

enrolment
at

2011
consist
of

and
65

.
this
reveal
a
slight
increase
of
nine
mainstream
student
but
a
reduction
of
40
post

student
for
the
2012

school
year
.
in
November
2011
,
the
VEC
submit
a
application
for
capital
funding
to
the
Department
for
a
major
extension
at

.
however
,
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
in
view
of
the
very
real
need
to
ensure
that
a
child
have
access
to
a
school
place
,
the
delivery
of
essential
mainstream

main

for

.
the

focus
on
the
need

of

the
deputy
be
the
good
proponent
of
talk
down
the
clock
.
since
the
tragic
death
of
Savita
Halappanavar
,
the
issue
of
abortion
have
once
again
become
dominant
in
Irish
politics
.
it
be
a
double
tragedy
that
it
should
take
the
death
of
a
young
woman
to
again
focus
mind
on
the
requirement
to
protect
woman
and
to
address
the
unresolved
legal
issue
but
the
need
for
great
legal
clarity
have
be
there
for
a
long
time
.
disgracefully
,
that
need
have
be
neglect
by
successive
government
.
this
Bill
seek
to
provide
legal
clarity
.
it
may
not
be
the
require
answer
but
Sinn
Féin
believe
that
it
should
be
allow
to
proceed
to
committee
stage
where
it
can
be
amend
,
as
appropriate
,
and
we
will
vote
accordingly
.
legislation
can
now
be
address
in
light
of
the
report
of
the
Expert
Group
on
the
judgment
in
A
,
B
and
C
v.
Ireland
,
the
publication
of
which
I
welcome
early
.
the
report
remind
we
that
,
in
the
A
,
B
and
C
v.
Ireland
case
,
the
ECHR
find
that
Ms
C's
right
to
private
and
family
life
have
be
violate
contrary
to
article
8
of
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
the
court
hold
that
there
be
no
accessible
and
effective
procedure
to
enable
she
to
establish
whether
she
qualify
for
a
lawful
termination
of
pregnancy
in
accordance
with
Irish
law
.
that
,
in
a
nutshell
,
set
out
the
need
to
legislate
.
the
report
set
out
option
for
the
provision
of
lawful
termination
of
pregnancy
in
circumstance
where
there
be
a
real
and
substantial
risk
to
the
life
of
the
mother
which
can
only
be
avoid
by
a
termination
of
the
pregnancy
.
this
be
the
core
of
the
matter
on
which
we
have
to
provide
as
much
legal
certainty
as
possible
.
from
the
report
's
analysis
of
the
option
,
it
be
clear
that
primary
legislation
be
require
and
that
regulation
alone
will
not
suffice
.
the
detail
of
the
report
will
require
careful
scrutiny
in
the
day
ahead
,
for
example
,
to
assess
if
a
combination
of
primary
legislation
and
regulation
would
be
preferable
to
primary
legislation
alone
.
a
first
reading
of
the
report
make
clear
that
what
be
most
likely
require
be
both
primary
legislation
and
regulation
.
a
careful
balance
will
have
to
be
strike
between
make
legislation
too
prescriptive
and
leave
too
much
to
be
deal
with
by
regulation
.
it
be
absolutely
crucial
that
the
government
act
speedily
on
the
report
.
as
a
immediate
next
step
,
the
government
should
allow
the
Bill
to
proceed
to
Committee
stage
.
that
be
we
sincerely
hold
view
.
it
will
then
be
up
to
the
government
to
determine
when
committee
stage
will
be
take
.
this
can
be
do
in
consultation
with
all
party
and
any
number
of
amendment
can
be
bring
forward
to
make
the
Bill
fit
for
purpose
.
we
be
willing
to
play
we
part
in
all
of
that
.
we
should
not
have
to
wait
another
six
month
for
legislation
to
present
and
be
enact
.
as
a
Opposition
party
,
Sinn
Féin
be
willing
to
co-operate
with
the
government
and
all
party
and
voice
in
the
Oireachtas
to
achieve
the
good
outcome
and
the
state
outcome
,
which
be
the
protection
of
woman
in
all
circumstance
that
can
present
and
the
provision
of
certainty
for
medical
practitioner
where
legal
certainty
be
require
.
what
be
the
yield
?
how
many
of
they
be
there
?
we
see

will

the
House
be
about
to
hear
a
lecture
in
partitionist
politics
from
Sinn
Féin
.
with
the
chair
's
permission
,
I
would
like
to
share
my
time
with
Deputy
Harrington
,
Twomey
and
Kyne
.
I
will
conclude
my
contribution
within
the
two
minute
remain
before
the
so
,
after
which
my
time
will
revert
to
the
other
deputy
,
with
the
chair
's
permission
.
there
be
two
Sinn
Féins
on
this
island
-
Sinn
Féin
in
the
six
County
and
Sinn
Féin
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
.
they
preach
one
message
in
the
South
and
another
in
the
North
.
I
do
not
understand
Sinn
Féin
's
vehement
opposition
to
a
property
tax
in
the
South
,
as
it
do
not
appear
to
oppose
it
in
the
North
where
it
be
in
government
and
where
the
average
household
pay
approximately
£
1000
per
annum
.
if
Sinn
Féin
be
so
vehemently
oppose
to
property
tax
,
why
have
it
not
roll
back
on
that
tax
in
the
North
?
in
October
,
Sinn
Féin
nod
through
the
Welfare
Reform
Bill
in
the
North
,
which
will
have
the
effect
of
permanently
reduce
the
North
's
£
5.1
billion
benefit
bill
.
I
do
not
understand
why
Sinn
Féin
do
not
block
that
in
the
North
,
as
it
be
in
the
executive
.
I
think
I
have
one
minute
.
I
thank
the
deputy
again
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
presence
of
deputy
Kevin
Humphrey
.
I
will
convey
the
point
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
make
to
the
minister
for
direct
reply
.
notwithstanding
the
shocking
event
to
which
he
refer
,
we
should
remember
that
,
week
in
and
week

important
issue
.
I
be
a
graduate
of
the
College
of
Commerce
in
Cork
so
I
have
first
-
hand
knowledge
of
the
important
experience
people
gain
within
the
post
-
leave
certificate
sector
.
from
personal
experience
I
be
aware
that
at
a
particular
stage
in
one
's
life
one
may
not
be
entirely
sure
of
the
direction
one
want
to
take
.
the
PLC
sector
fill
a
important
gap
and
allow
people
to
take
some
time
and
pursue
course
while
they
decide
on
the
ultimate
direction
they
wish
to
take
,
both
academically
and
in
they
working
life
.
I
have
always
be
grateful
for
the
experience
I
gain
from
my
time
at
the
College
of
Commerce
in
Cork
,
particularly
as
it
afford
I
the
opportunity
to
take
the
time
to
make
the
decision
to
pursue
my
education
further
by
proceed
to
the
university
sector
.
I
place
this
fact
on
the
record
of
the
House
because
it
be
important
to
convey
to
people
the
fact
that
there
be
a
understanding
of
the
importance
of
the
PLC
sector
.
we
do
not
want
to
pay
lip
service
to
that
sector
,
particularly
as
we
be
conscious
of
its
progressive
nature
in
the
context
of
afford
people
the
space
to
decide
to
proceed
to
achieve
even
further
educational
or
vocational
attainment
.
ultimately
,
it
can
also
facilitate
they
in
the
context
of
career
attainment
.
I
wish
to
focus
on
the
position
in
respect
of
Cork
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
overly
parochial
but
I
do
want
to
discuss
the
impact
this
cut
will
have
in
County
Cork
.
I
be
only
too
well
aware
of
the
level
of
focus
there
have
be
on
the
level
of
reduction
in
the
two
Cork
vec
.
at
present
,
there
be
just
under
5400
plc
place
available
at
City
of
Cork
VEC
and
Cork
County
VEC
.
this
represent
a
significant
tranche
of
the
overall
number
of
such
place
throughout
the
country
.
there
be
316
staff
at
the
two
vec
.
the
VECs
be
expect
to
have
the
same
number
of
place
available
and
284
staff
from
next
September
.
this
be
,
by
some
margin
,
one
of
the
big
allocation
of
PLC
place
and
staff
in
the
country
.
it
be
only
right
that
a
county
as
important
as
Cork
should
have
such
a
high
level
of
resource
available
to
it
.
the
Department
sanction
the
teaching
post
to
the
vec
which
,
in
turn
,
allocate
they
to
the
school
and
college
under
they
remit
.
as
the
change
will
not
take
effect
until
September
,
the
VECs
have
the
opportunity
to
plan
how
good
to
deal
with
a
slightly
reduce
allocation
.
I
know
there
have
be
concern
that
the
most
innovative
course
,
particularly
in
cloud
computing
,
veterinary
nursing
and
computer
programming
,
be
at
risk
.
we
acknowledge
this
.
however
,
that
be
the
challenge
every
principal
of
a
college
of
further
education
will
have
to
manage
carefully
with
he
or
she
ceo
.
with
the
government
and
colleague
in
Cork
,
I
will
work
closely
with
the
ceo
and
local
principal
to
ensure
the
breadth
of
course
provision
be
maintain
,
particularly
in
the
cutting
edge
area
that
be
so
vital
to
we
economic
recovery
.
this
should
include
examine
whether
similar
course
offer
in
more
than
one
college
can
be
merge
to
ensure
niche
offering
be
maintain
.
teacher
allocation
should
not
be
fix
in
isolation
in
each
college
.
a
join
-
up
approach
to
course
delivery
and
necessary
redeployment
within
each
vec
area
be
absolutely
vital
.
I
welcome
and
acknowledge
the
fact
that
within
one
week
of
the
budget
announcement
last
month
the
minister
meet
personally
all
of
the
ceo
and
chairperson
of
the
VECs
.
he
ask
they
to
ensure
the
change
that
have
to
be
make
would
have
the
minimum
of
risk
for
front
-
line
service
in
so
far
as
be
possible
.
I
support
that
approach
fully
.
this
reflect
the
minister
's
awareness
of
the
good
work
of
the
PLC
sector
in
the
education
system
.
we
now
have
a
nine
-
month
window
of
opportunity
to
ensure
the
change
require
be
make
carefully
and
with
appropriate
consideration
.
my
priority
remain
to
ensure
all
that
use
further
education
service
in
Cork
and
other
area
can
access
the
course
that
will
help
they
to
up
-
skill
and
eventually
find
employment
.
deputy
on
both
side
of
the
House
constantly
say
we
have
to
look
to
other
part
of
the
education
system
if
further
adjustment
be
need
.
we
share
that
sentiment
and
that
be
precisely
what
the
government
have
do
in
this
instance
.
one
of
the
measure
announce
in
the
budget
will
see
the
teaching
allocation
in
PLC
college
increase
by
two
point
from
17
to
19
.
this
will
have
the
effect
of
bring
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
in
post
-
leave
certificate
college
which
teach
motivate
adult
into
line
with
that
in
second
level
school
.
this
will
provide
for
equity
.
we
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
it
will
result
in
the
loss
of
200
full
-
time
teaching
post
across
the
sector
.
however
,
we
must
support
a
strategy
of
prioritisation
at
a
time
of
reduce
resource
.
have
a
more
preferential
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
in
PLC
college
than
in
second
level
school
be
not
sustainable
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
address
the
House
on
this
important
issue
.
it
be
entirely
appropriate
that
we
highlight
the
importance
of
the
further
education
and
training
sector
,
both
as
part
of
the
education
system
which
promote
the
concept
of
lifelong
learning
and
as
part
of
the
country
's
future
in
term
of
re-skilling
and
upskilling
of
citizen
,
particularly
for
that
who
be
unemployed
.
while
it
would
be
preferable
not
to
have
to
make
any
reduction
,
the
government
have
seek
to
protect
front
-
line
education
service
to
the
great
extent
possible
through
the
protection
of
class
size
in
free
primary
and
second
level
school
and
the
protection
of
the
overall
number
of
special
need
assistant
,
resource
teacher
and
the
staffing
allocation
to
disadvantage
DEIS
school
.
because
of
rise
demographic
and
the
protection
provide
in
the
budget
for
current
teacher
allocation
,
this
will
mean
that
we
expect
to
hire
a
additional
450
primary
teacher
and
450
second
level
teacher
for
the
next
school
year
.
it
be
worth
reiterate
the
point
about
rise
demographic
and
the
economic
pressure
on
the
Department
's
budget
.
we
must
ensure
sufficient
number
of
primary
and
second
level
teacher
to
plan
for
the
rise
in
the
population
.
despite
the
economic
climate
,
the
government
have
show
its
strong
commitment
to
protect
and
invest
in
education
and
create
employment
for
teacher
.
it
be
also
worth
reflect
on
the
record
of
the
party
opposite
during
its
last
term
of
office
in
education
-----
I
have
never
be
in
government
before
.
almost
4450
post
in
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
have
be
take
out
of
the
education
system
since
2008
.
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
do
be
carry
out
under
budget
construct
by
some
of
the
Member
opposite
.
in
that
time
there
be
a
increase
in
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
in
primary
school
from
27
to
28
.
there
be
a
increase
in
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
in
secondary
school
from
18
to
19
.
there
be
also
the
removal
of
eligibility
for
student
support
grant
from
that
in
receipt
of
the
back
to
education
allowance
,
the
allowance
that
help
many
in
the
PLC
sector
.
vto
allowance
be
remove
for
that
pursue
post
-
leave
certificate
course
in
2010
.
the
party
opposite
change
the
favourable
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
of
17:1
to
19:1
for
the
leave
certificate
vocational
programme
in
2011
in
order
to
secure
a
reduction
of
approximately
200
post
which
be
justify
at
the
time
by
say
it
would
bring
it
into
line
with
the
normal
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
in
second
level
school
.
I
refer
to
the
withdrawal
of
resource
teacher
for
Traveller
child
at
primary
and
post
-
primary
level
in
order
to
secure
a
reduction
of
approximately
600
post
in
2011
.
I
refer
to
the
announcement
of
the
elimination
of
500
language
support
teacher
from
primary
and
second
level
school
in
2011
,
not
to
mention
the
elimination
of
the
post
of
primary
rural
co-ordinator
and
visit
teacher
for
Traveller
.
we
be
start
from
a
base
where
the
country
be
borrowing
€300
million
a
week
.
nobody
want
to
preside
over
a
situation
where
teacher
lose
they
job
.
we
be
try
within
the
education
budget
to
ensure
the
course
deliver
for
that
who
want
to
retrain
and
upskill
will
be
provide
within
the
vec
structure
.
we
seek
to
do
this
to
the
good
of
we
ability
.
it
be
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
effect
the
savings
require
.
I
be
the
beneficiary
of
accreditation
.
I
have
a
diploma
in
business
study
which
I
acquire
through
the
College
of
Commerce
in
Cork
.
I
have
first
-
hand
experience
of
PLC
course
which
assist
I
in
the
not
too
distant
past
and
assist
other
in
a
way
that
allow
for
progression
to
take
place
.
notwithstanding
the
loss
of
this
teaching
job
,
if
ceo
work
with
we
and
a
lateral
approach
be
take
,
we
be
confident
that
the
new
and
highly
innovative
course
which
allow
people
to
progress
to
university
and
institute
of
technology
can
be
preserve
in
a
way
that
will
allow
for
progression
through
the
system
.
it
be
vital
to
ensure
pupil
will
have
that
opportunity
to
come
into
the
plc
system
in
a
manner
that
it
will
cater
for
they
need
as
they
progress
through
they
career
.
where
be
the
deputy
get
the
figure
?
the
funding
for
DEIS
school
be
restore
.
the
deputy
be
incorrigible
.
this
be
downright
nonsense
.

I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
from
the
preventative
point
of
view
,
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
he
sentiment
regard
the
importance
of
raise
awareness
.
if
we
can
take
preventative
measure
and
utilise
early
intervention
measure
to
tackle
childhood
obesity
,
it
will
have
a
positive
effect
downstream
for
the
citizen
themselves
as
well
as
for
the
Exchequer
in
term
of
medical
intervention
and
so
forth
.
the
Department
be
commit
to
promote
healthy
lifestyle
choice
among
child
and
young
people
.
this
be
reflect
in
the
curriculum
for
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
.
the
successful
active
school
flag
,
ASF
,
programme
also
provide
evidence
to
the
effect
that
school
be
keenly
interested
in
ensure
that
they
student
have
positive
attitude
to
physical
activity
.
however
and
as
the
deputy
articulate
,
there
be
only
so
much
that
school
can
do
.
there
be
a
onus
on
parent
and
the
community
to
ensure
that
child
be
as
active
as
possible
outside
of
school
.
the
Department
recognise
the
importance
of
cultivate
healthy
attitude
in
child
.
this
be
reflect
in
the
primary

curriculum
for

of

and
the
importance
of
a
balance
and
healthy

along
with
be

in
post
-

,
the

on
healthy

,
and
physical

the

a
role
to
play

on

my
colleague
,
the

one
of
the
principle
of

this
principle
will
be
underpin
by
key
statement
of
learning
that

for

some
30

that

the
result

the

my

collaborate

co-operate
on
a
number
of
relevant

I
do
not
disagree
with
anything

spot
on
in

deputy
O'Donovan
illustrate
a
example
of
a
child
with
digestive
.
the
child
do
not
pack

box
and
neither
do
the

.
it
be
the
parent
.
school
act
in
loco
parentis
and
by
they
very
nature
will
do
so
much
.
I
refer
,
for
example
,
to
the
activity
around
the
active
school
flag
for
which
1000
primary
and
post

primary
school
have
register
.
a
total
of
156
flag
have
be
award
which
show
that
there
be
a
rise
consciousness
on
the

.
if
the
green
flag
initiative
be
anything
to
go
by
then
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
be
just
as
successful
in
term
of
raise
awareness
.
however
,
there
be
a
role
for
parent
as
well
,
and
for
community
and
teacher
involvement
.
technology
be
one
way
of
raise
that
kind
of
awareness
.
deputy
O’Donovan
refer
to
the
post
-
Christmas
rush
to
purchase
new
gear
and
to
get
exercise
.
we
all
have
post
-
Christmas
guilt
.
I
download
two
application
,
app
,
one
call
"
Run

"
and
the
other
"

.
such
app
will
help
to
modify
people
's
behaviour
.
I
accept
the
deputy
's
point
but
I
firmly
believe
there
be
a
strong
role
for
parent
,
and
we
speak
a
little
to
common
sense
.
I
be
happy
to
talk
to
the
deputy
again
on
the
matter
to
see
whether
we
can
progress
the
issue
in
the
wide
context
of
reduce
the
level
of
obesity
.
there
must
be
a

additional
information
not
give
on

in

vein
,
the

NPRF
have
develop
a

of

to
provide

pool

in

a
new
package
of
tax
measure
to
support
sme
be
outline
by
the
Minister
for
Finance
in
budget
2013
.
it
be
important
,
however
,
to
recognise
that
the
economic
transition
be
not
solely
about
the
volume
of
Exchequer
resource
aim
at
the
enterprise
sector
.
equally
important
in
the
2013
action
plan
for
job
will
be
the
reform
which
we
be
continue
to
implement
on
a
ongoing
basis
to
enhance
we
competitiveness
,
improve
the
environment
for

support

sectoral
strategy

the

will
be
publish
in
the
come
week
,
follow
approval
by

.
as
the
minister
have
say
,
the
government
must
create
a
set
of
condition
that
facilitate
growth
in
employment
rate
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
government
have
set
a
employment
rate
target
.
I
be
not
aware
of
a
precedent
for
that
.
the
deputy
refer
to
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
NPRF
.
it
will
be
use
to
support
the
sme
sector
and
provide
equity
,
credit
and
recovery
investment
.
the
NPRF
will
provide
up
to
€
850
million
on
a
commercial
basis
with
a
view
to
leverage
private
sector
funding
into
the
Irish
investment
market
.
the
government
be
create
condition
such
as
a
25
%
increase
in
the
threshold
for
vat
cash
receipt
basis
accounting
to
improve
cash
flow
for
sme
.
it
be
double
the
amount
of
expenditure
that
qualify
for
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
for
sme
so
that
we
can
support
more
innovation
by
business
.
that
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
foreign
direct
investment
.
it
be
extend
the
foreign
earnings
deduction
scheme
to
support
export
company
to
develop
a
presence
in
new
key
market
.
the
economic
transition
be
not
solely
about
the
volume
of
Exchequer
resource
aim
at
the
enterprise
sector
.
we
must
give
equal
importance
to
the
reform
that
will
result
from
instigate
a
range
of
measure
to
enhance
we
competitiveness
,
improve
the
environment
for
business
and
create
the
job
that
be
so
necessary
.
there
be
IDA
and
Enterprise
Ireland
target
.
because
of
the
constraint
of
time
here
in
the
House
I
would
be
happy
to
talk
to
the
deputy
about
that
target
.
he
be
welcome
to
come
to
the
Department
for
a
briefing
any
time
.
deputy
Tóibín
say
we
be
not
allocate
sufficient
resource
.
the
seed
and
venture
capital
scheme
have
€
175
million
of
Exchequer
funding
.
the
NPRF
will
spend
approximately
€
850
million
,
which
will
be
available
for
investment
in
the
Irish
sme
sector
.
the
IDA
have
a
allocation
of
€
86
million
for
2013
.
its
target
be
set
out
in
its
Horizon
2020
programme
.
we
have
allocate
€
120
million
to
Enterprise
Ireland
.
it
have
clear
target
to
support
high
potential
start
-
up
.
there
be

company
.
local
enterprise
office
have
be
establish

level
.
if
deputy
Tóibín
wish
to
critique
the
government
's
allocation
of
resource
on
each
of
that
specific
process
I
would
like
to
give
more
time
to
hammer
it
out
with
he
and
see
where
Sinn
Féin
think
we
should
allocate
more
resource
and
taxpayer
's
money
in
create
job
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
7
and
13
together
.
the
rise
in
youth
unemployment
as
a
result
of
the
global
economic
downturn
be
a
challenge
for
most
EU

for

,
be
currently
prepare
the
2013
Action
plan
for
Jobs
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
in
that
context
,
we
will
be
explore
further
measure
which
can
be
take
to
transform
we
economy
and
support
job
creation
to
support
this
group
of
unemployed
people
.
I
acknowledge
everything
that
the
deputy
say
.
there
be
no
get
away
from
the
fact
that
the
rate
of
youth
unemployment
be
extremely
high
,
include
across
all
of
Europe
.
a
strong
attempt
be
be
make
during
Ireland
's
Presidency
of
the
EU
Council
to
give
effect
to
the
youth
guarantee
and
to
ensure
that
we
create
the
climate
across
Europe
,
in
a
way
that
will
benefit
Ireland
,
to
ensure
a
return
of
people
to
work
.
the
Momentum
scheme
be
launch
before
Christmas
last
under
the
auspices
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
there
will
be
specific
project
available
under
that
programme
to
assist
that
aged
under
25
year
in
a
return
to
employment
through
training
to
work
opportunity
and
a
graduate
activation
programme
.
be
I
out
of
time
?
again
,
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
.
the
deputy
must
also
acknowledge
the
deep
structural
change
that
give
rise
to
this
unemployment
crisis
which
,
as
state
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
a
reply
to
a
early
question
,
be
we
dependence
on
construction
,
in
which
sector
many
of
the
skill
be
employ
.
a
sudden
downturn
which
result
in
one
have
to
make
a
correction
of
the
order
of
€
38
plus
billion
over
a
five
or
six
year
period
require
one
to
find
new
way
to
create
labour
market
activation
measure
.
we
believe
we
be
succeed
.
for
instance
,
many
job
have
be
create
through
the
JobBridge
scheme
.
I
heartily
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
crisis
in
the
area
of
youth
unemployment
.
to
repeat
the
point
,
we
all
agree
the
problem
of
emigration
be
scare
the
social
fabric
.
however
,
I
do
not
agree
with
the
rhetoric
that
it
be
all
negative
.
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
initiative
be
take
place
in
we
third
level
institution
,
and
out
there
be
a
boundless
creativity
which
do
not
work
its
way
into
the
discourse
in
a
House
such
as
this
.
one
have
only
to
go
to
this
institution
and
meet
this
people
.
I
take
issue
with
the
point
make
by
deputy
Tóibín
on
this
.
I
repeat
the
point
that
if
all
one
's
egg
be
put
into
the
construction
basket
and
a
downturn
in
the
sector
occur
,
it
will
give
rise
to
emigration
to
new
area
where
there
be
opportunity
such
as
western
Australia
,
Canada
and
North
America
.
this
be
exactly
what
we
be
see
happen
.
from
a
sectoral
point
of
view
we
be
see
this
trend
.
we
want
to
reverse
this
by
create
the
programme
we
have
to
allow
people
with
this
skillset
to
retrain
and
move
into
other
sector
.
we
be
do
this
and
by

we
be
slowly
succeed
in
this

I
thank
deputy
Doherty
for
raise
this
important
matter
.
I
be
speak
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
who
regret
he
be
unable
to
be
present
as
he
be
in
Dublin
Castle
in
he
capacity
as
Minister
for
Defence
.
I
can
inform
the
deputy
that
on
19
June
2012
,
the
minister
publish
a
report
on
the
criminal
justice
aspect
of
the
cash
for
gold
trade
,
which
be
prepare
by
he
Department
.
the
minister
have
formally
request
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
to
consider
the
content
of
the
report
,
obtain
the
view
of
all
relevant
interested
party
and
make
such
report
and
recommendation
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
and
to
the
government
as
it
deem
proportionate
and
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
.
the
minister
understand
that
the
committee
have
seek
view
from
stakeholder
and
he
be
await
receipt
of
the
committee
's
report
follow
the
conclusion
of
the
committee
's
deliberation
.
in
publish
that
report
,
the
minister
note
the
concern
that
member
of
the
public
have
express
about
the
proliferation
of
cash
for
gold
outlet
throughout
the
State
.
the
informal
purchase
of
jewellery
be
not
specifically
regulate
in
criminal
legislation
.
however
,
the
circumstance
under
which
jewellery
be
be
buy
or
sell
may
indicate
the
commission
of
certain
offence
,
such
as
handling
of
steal
property
or
possession
of
steal
property
under
section
17
and
18
of
the
criminal
Justice
(
theft
and
Fraud
Offences
)
Act
2001
.
the
report
indicate
that
this
provision
be
adequate
to
deal
with
any
such
offence
that
may
be
commit
in
the
cash
for
gold
situation
.
the
report
also
highlight
the
action
undertake
by
a
Garda
Síochána
in
consultation
with
the
minister
's
Department
.
all
cash
for
gold
premise
in
the
State
be
visit
by
a
Garda
Síochána
and
the
operator
make
aware
of
they
responsibility
and
obligation
under
the
law
with
regard
to
the
purchase
of
gold
and
other
item
of
jewellery
.
Garda
contact
information
provide
to
operator
will
facilitate
the
reporting
to
the
Garda
Síochána
of
any
suspicious
activity
.
the
minister
,
in
publish
the
report
,
congratulate
the
Commissioner
of
a
Garda
Síochána
for
he
prompt
and
proactive
response
to
this
matter
.
the
minister
have
state
that
it
be
arguably
inconsistent
that
there
be
specific
rule
and
regulation
that
apply
to
pawnbroker
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
to
assist
the
Garda
while
similar
appropriate
and
adapt
rule
and
regulation
do
not
apply
to
cash
for
gold
outlet
.
it
be
in
this
context
that
the
need
to
explore
the
issue
of
evidence
of
ownership
of
gold
and
jewellery
item
,
such
as
photo
id
and
other
evidence
of
ownership
mention
by
the
deputy
,
be
refer
to
in
the
report
and
no
doubt
will
be
the
subject
of
attention
in
the
course
of
the
Oireachtas
committee
's
consideration
of
the
issue
.
there
be
a
requirement
to
examine
carefully
the
resource
implication
of
any
role
envisage
for
a
Garda
Síochána
in
propose
new
regulatory
step
.
in
addition
,
in
frame
any
necessary
measure
in
respect
of
cash
for
gold
shop
,
it
be
important
to
ensure
consistency
in
they
application
in
so
far
as
they
would
also
apply
to
other
retail
outlet
that
may
trade
in
second
-
hand
gold
item
,
such
as
jewellery
and
antique
retailer
.
however
,
the
minister
be
of
the
view
that
it
be
important
to
avoid
create
unnecessary
form
-
fill
,
expense
and
bureaucracy
for
legitimate
business
that
make
no
significant
contribution
to
law
enforcement
or
the
protection
of
the
public
generally
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
forgive
I
for
have
a
prepare
response
because
the
minister
be
not
present
to
respond
.
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
I
thank
the
deputy
for
avail
of
the
topical
Issue
procedure
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
I
assure
she
,
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
that
she
constructive
remark
and
suggestion
will
be
note
.
the
minister
look
forward
to
the
Oireachtas
committee
's
response
to
the
issue
raise
in
he
departmental
report
on
the
cash
for
gold
sector
.
with
regard
to
burglary
,
the
minister
welcome
the
progress
be
make
by
a
Garda
as
part
of
Operation
Fiacla
,
which
be
focus
on
identify
and
target
gang
involve
in
burglary
.
operation
Fiacla
be
intelligence
drive
.
as
part
of
the
operation
,
specific
burglary
initiative
have
be
implement
in
each
Garda
region
to
target
suspect
offender
.
as
of
21
January
2013
,
3903
person
have
be
arrest
and
2142
person
have
be
charge
as
part
of
the
operation
,
show
that
the
Garda
Commissioner
be
effectively
deploy
the
substantial
resource
available
to
he
.
furthermore
,
the
late
quarterly
figure
for
burglary
,
by
comparison
with
that
prior
to
the
operation
's
introduction
,
suggest
the
operation
be
have
a
impact
.
while
it
be
clearly
no
consolation
to
that
who
have
have
to
endure
dreadful
experience
at
the
hand
of
gang
of
burglar
,
it
be
none
the
less
important
to
mention
that
the
most
recent
crime
figure
show
that
the
number
of
aggravate
burglary
have
decrease
by
over
17
%
on
the
previous
12
month
.
the
Garda
response
to
such
crime
be
robust
,
and
gang
and
individual
involve
in
burglary
be
pursue
with
determination
and
effectiveness
.
with
regard
to
cash
for
gold
operation
,
it
be
important
that
there
be
a
target
,
proportionate
and
balance
response
by
the
government
to
ensure
opportunity
for
criminal
to
obtain
cash
for
steal
gold
and
other
precious
metal
be
eliminate
while
not
affect
legitimate
trade
because
of
the
criminal
action
of
a
few
.
the
minister
have
indicate
that
the
objective
of
any
action
must
be
to
ensure
such
business
be
not
unknowingly
open
to
abuse
by
criminal
element
.
I
thank
former
Senator
McAleese
and
he
team
for
produce
this
report
.
I
completely
accept
its
finding
and
believe
the
woman
and
they
story
.
this
be
a
sad
chapter
in
we
history
.
I
thank
deputy
Calleary
for
tab
the
motion
but
we
would
not
be
discuss
the
matter
tonight
if
the
Taoiseach
have
act
properly
last
week
when
he
have
the
opportunity
to
apologise
unreservedly
to
all
the
woman
concerned
and
they
family
.
he
could
have
apologise
on
behalf
of
every
man
,
woman
and
child
in
this
country
.
he
have
a
mandate
as
Head
of
government
to
issue
such
a
apology
.
he
fail
to
grasp
that
opportunity
,
however
.
when
one
compare
the
utterance
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
as
Opposition
spokesman
with
what
he
say
now
,
one
cannot
but
think
he
be
play
politics
.
the
report
be
delay
and
take
long
than
expect
to
complete
,
even
though
only
a
small
minority
of
the
woman
be
interview
.
as
senior
departmental
official
be
on
the
committee
of
investigation
,
they
do
not
have
to
wait
to
read
the
report
.
the
government
should
have
be
man
enough
to
apologise
before
the
report
come
before
we
.
I
salute
the
undying
dignity
of
the
Magdalen
survivor
and
welcome
that
who
be
in
the
Gallery
tonight
.
it
behove
we
to
introduce
a
proper
redress
scheme
,
pay
pension
for
the
labour
they
carry
out
and
look
after
they
rights
and
housing
.
we
state
do
not
have
a
good
record
in
deal
with
sensitive
case
like
this
.
we
all
proclaim
to
be
horrify
at
the
mistreatment
of
child
but
not
long
ago
nearly
every
deputy
except
I
take
part
in
a
referendum
and
a
charade
in
which
the
Supreme
Court
find
that
the
government
steal
€
1.1
million
of
the
money
allocate
for
a
proper
referendum
campaign
.
nothing
have
change
.
we
might
say
we
be
in
modern
Ireland
but
slavery
and
ill
-
treatment
of
young
woman
and
boy
be
ongoing
.
we
can
not
be
wash
we
hand
as
if
we
be
all
new
people
with
new
thinking
.
this
be
go
on
under
we
nose
and
the
government
be
complicit
in
it
.
it
be
not
acceptable
that
mandarin
in
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
could
tie
the
Taoiseach
up
in
knot
and
prevent
he
from
say
what
he
want
to
say
.
I
believe
he
be
a
decent
man
.
I
be
not
lessen
the
plight
of
this
woman
when
I
say
that
all
of
they
have
family
,
some
of
which
be
not
poor
.
they
too
have
responsibility
.
we
all
know
of
case
in
we
community
when
this
be
allow
to
happen
with
the
complicity
of
State
authority
.
we
cannot
blame
the
State
for
everything
,
however
.
we
all
have
to
take
responsibility
.
I
know
of
people
and
case
which
be
hush
up
when
I
be
a
young
fellow
.
the
State
put
more
than
one
quarter
of
they
in
directly
but
family
and
people
must
also
look
into
they
heart
.
we
be
still
do
that
with
immigration
and
what
we
vote
for
in
the
middle
of
the
night
last
week
.
I
thank
former
Senator
McAleese
and
he

for

.
I
completely

it

the

put

,
range
may
receive

in
the

manner
as

they
receive
they

school
have
provision
,
under

,
to
allocate

target

to
that

also
to

,

with

GLD
will
generally
receive
approximately
2.5
teaching

per

under

this

be
reflective
of
the

which
be
provide
for

prior

the
introduction

can
I
beg
the
Ceann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
to
complete
the
question
?
historically
,
the
Department
allocate
resource
to
support
child
with
special
need
on
the
basis
of
category
of
disability
but
for
many
year
child
with
special
need
be
primarily
educate
in
special
school
or
special
class
.
this
school
and
class
be
designate
as
catering
for
a
specific
category
of
disability
,
but
the
report
of
the
special
Education
Review
Committee
,
SERC
,
of
1993
make
a
wide
range
of
recommendation
on
the
level
of
resource
that
should
be
allocate
to
cater
for
child
in
different
category
of
special
need
.
the
SERC
report
still
provide
much
of
the
basis
which
underpin
the
current
policy
and
provision
.
the
disability
category
set
out
in
the
SERC
report
form
the
basis
of
resource
allocation
.
that
report
do
not
identify
down
's
syndrome
as
a
particular
disability
category
for
the
allocation
of
resource
and
consideration
of
the
category
of
disability
to
be
cater
for
under
the
gam
base
on
high
incidence
or
less
severe
disability
be
cent
mainly
on
the
category
of
mild
general
learning
disability
detailed
in
the
SERC
report
.
I
refer
the
deputy
then
to
my
original
reply
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
deputy
Finian
McGrath
.
they
will
be
take
on
board
.
the
Children
's
Right
Alliance
report
note
that
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
receive
a
overall
"
b-
minus
"
grade
for
solid
progress
,
particularly
in
literacy
,
patronage
and
school
building
.
this
be
one
of
the
high
grade
give
to
any
department
and
reflect
well
on
the
overall
performance
of
we
education
system
.
the
report
also
note
that
the
level
of
investment
in
the
area
of
special
educational
need
be
maintain
in
the
current
school
year
but
that
implementation
of
the
Epsen
Act
have
be
delay
.
I
understand
and
acknowledge
the
concern
that
have
be
express
to
date
about
the
delay
in
implement
the
Epsen
Act
.
in
light
of
the
very
difficult
economic
situation
,
the
previous
government
defer
full
implementation
of
it
.
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
,
NCSE
,
have
advise
that
a
additional
investment
of
up
to
€235
million
per
annum
across
the
education
and
health
sector
would
be
require
to
fully
implement
the
Epsen
Act
.
in
the
Department
's
view
,
the
level
of
investment
require
could
be
great
.
while
the
minister
have
do
he
good
to
date
to
preserve
overall
funding
for
special
education
,
it
have
not
be
possible
to
identify
additional
resource
from
within
the
education
budget
to
cover
this
cost
.
the
NCSE
have
be
ask
to
provide
policy
advice
on
how
the
education
system
can
well
support
child
with
special
need
.
this
advice
will
guide
the
preparation
of
a
plan
on
how
aspect
of
Epsen
can
be
implement
,
include
prioritise
access
of
child
with
special
need
to
a
individual
education
plan
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.
as
I
state
early
,
the
NCSE
have
be
task
with
the
provision
of
policy
advice
on
the
appropriate
nature
and
configuration
of
educational
support
require
to
be
allocate
in
order
to
achieve
as
much
as
possible
of
Epsen
within
the
confines
of
the
parcel
of
funding
available
in
that
regard
.
the
government
will
endeavour
to
ensure
as
much
as
possible
of
it
be
implement
.
the
internal
assessment
be
that
the
cost
could
be
high
than
the
figure
which
I
mention
early
.
we
will
do
we
good
to
implement
Epsen
within
current
constraint
.
without
be
facetious
,
that
be
too
optimistic
.
a
number
of
section
have
already
be
implement
.
I
can
provide
a
list
of
all
the
section
that
have
be
implement
thus
far
but
for
the
sake
of
brevity
,
I
will
not
do
so
now
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
O'Brien
in
regard
to
ensure
great
collaboration
between
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
Health
and
for
people
to
think
outside
the
traditional
silo
within
which
they
exist
in
term
of
delivery
of
policy
outcome
.
I
note
the
point
make
in
that
regard
.

I
thank

the
position
on

raise

the

have
protect
front

line
service

to
the
great
extent
possible
in

there
will

in

school
for

be
also
fully
protect
,
with
no

how
good
to
sustain

for
widely
disperse
and
small
local
community
present
a
particular
challenge
,
especially
in
any
locality
where
enrolment
be

figure
.
the

be
intent
on
foster
pluralism
in
school

the

.
the

expect
to

at

at

the

the

however
,
this

have
the

to

,
a

not
available

.
there
be
some
concern
within
the
Church
of
Ireland
community
about
the
recent
budget
measure
affect
fee-

school
.
the
government
recognise
the
importance
of

attend
a

that
reflect

,
while
,
at

,
ensure

Kilkenny
College
that
it
be
enter
the

and
will
cease

it
be
a
welcome
development
that
the
school
consider
that
its
future
can
well
be
secure
through
the
free

and
that
it
can
continue
to
deliver
a

the
level
of
capitation
funding
in
recent
year
owe
to
the
need
to
operate
within
we
tight
budgetary
requirement
.
with
regard
to
the
fee-
charge
Protestant
school
,
there
be
a
arrangement
whereby
funding
be
provide
by
my
Department
for
the
Secondary
Education
Committee
,
SEC
,
a
organisation
run
by
the
church
involve
in
manage
the
Protestant
secondary
school
.
the
SEC
disburse
fund
to
the
Protestant
fee-
charging
school
on
behalf
of
pupil
who
would
otherwise
have
difficulty
in
meet
the
cost
of
fee
and
who
,
in
the
absence
of
such
financial
support
,
would
be
unable
to
attend
a
second
level
school
of
a
reformed
Church
or
Protestant
etho
.
funding
amount
to
€
6.5
million
annually
and
this
fund
ensure
necessitous
Protestant
child
can
attend
a
school
of
they
choice
.
regard
school
transport
provision
,
a
number
of
change
have
be
implement
in
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
transport
scheme
.
this
change
be
be
apply
equitably
on
a
national
basis
.
I
confirm
that
the
minister
and
he
relevant
departmental
official
will
continue
to
engage
with
the
relevant
education
sector
stakeholder
,
include
the
Church
of
Ireland
and
board
of
education
,
on
education
provision
for
all
area
.
on
the
first
question
,
I
can
facilitate
the
deputy
in
ensure
he
receive
guidance
on
the
guideline
on
and
process
involve
in
amalgamation
.
on
the
second
question
,
the
constitution
do
not
allow
for
either
positive
or
negative
discrimination
in
school
base
on
they
religious
etho
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
on
the
position
in
certain
area
of
the
country
where
there
be
a
one
-
teacher
school
and
,
owe
to
geographical
or
other
consideration
,
pupil
may
not
be
able
to
avail
of
the
near
school
with
they
etho
.
this
be
a
issue
with
which
we
have
to
grapple
.
I
know
from
my
experience
in
my
constituency
where
the
Department
have
have
consultation
with
the
local
bishop
that
there
be
ongoing
discussion
on
how
we
can
sort
out
this
issue
.
in
that
sense
,
there
be
a
open
door
.
on
the
point
on
one
-
teacher
school
,
I
would
be
of
the
mindset
that
we
need
to
take
this
example
and
grapple
with
they
example
by
example
.
I
would
certainly
have
a
open
mind
in
facilitate
that
process
.
there
be
nothing
bad
than
be
patronise
.
this
be
particularly
so
since
I
have
serve
in
this
House
since
2007
,
long
than
the
deputy
yonder
.
I
know
I
have
earn
my
place
here
.
over
the
past
two
night
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
have
have
a
interesting
and
passionate
debate
and
valid
point
have
be
make
by
both
side
.
sometimes
it
turn
a
little
bit
raucous
and
many
intervention
have
be
quite
rhetorical
.
in
response
to
some
point
make
by
party
across
the
bench
,
if
we
be
talk
about
the
restoration
of
this
economy
and
society
,
one
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
for
the
past
decade
or
so
,
investment
be
primarily
in
construction
,
which
fuel
the
economy
across
many
sector
.
when
that
sector
collapse
spectacularly
along
with
the
creation
of
the
credit
crisis
,
this
government
when
it
come
into
power
have
to
set
out
a
new
foundation
and
start
invest
in
new
area
so
that
one
can
upskill
and
retrain
the
very
worker
who
have
lose
they
job
and
now
have
to
emigrate
and
about
whom
Sinn
Féin
be
talk
.
one
must
put
in
place
a
set
of
new
idea
that
will
begin
new
investment
in
a
myriad
of
new
sector
across
the
economy
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
motion
in
this
house
about
labour
market
activation
,
I
would
rather
the
party
opposite
interrogate
Springboard
,
Momentum
,
the
ICT
skill
conversion
course
,
the
redundant
apprentice
placement
scheme
and
scheme
of
that
nature
.
if
there
be
a
critique
of
that
scheme
,
I
would
like
to
hear
it
.
one
either
agree
that
the
scheme
be
necessary
or
one
do
not
.
if
we
do
not
have
scheme
of
that
nature
,
we
will
not
provide
opportunity
for
that
people
,
mainly
young
man
who
rely
on
the
construction
sector
,
to
get
back
into
work
.
in
the
two
year
that
this
government
have
be
in
existence
,
we
have
put
a
myriad
of
scheme
in
place
of
which
there
have
be
a
large
take
up
.
they
have
be
quite
successful
,
particularly
JobBridge
where
a
number
of
people
have
secure
full
-
time
job
.
I
agree
with
some
of
the
point
make
by
member
opposite
in
respect
of
certain
area
of
Ireland
where
we
have
not
have
the
foreign
direct
investment
that
be
so
necessary
to
sustain
that
area
.
it
be
a
pity
I
have
only
one
minute
leave
because
I
be
only
get
start
.
I
have
offer
Sinn
Féin
a
chance
to
sit
down
with
I
and
interrogate
each
of
we
policy
,
many
of
which
I
cannot
articulate
because
of
the
limited
time
I
have
on
this
motion
,
and
I
think
it
will
take
I
up
on
this
offer
.
I
have
offer
it
a
chance
to
go
through
and
critique
each
one
of
that
scheme
as
long
as
it
be
a
objective
critique
and
not
rhetorical
and
empty
so
that
we
can
work
with
party
opposite
regardless
of
they
hue
to
get
we
out
of
this
crisis
.
Sinn
Féin
may
score
point
but
that
be
its
prerogative
as
a
Opposition
party
.
this
be
the
boxing
ring
and
that
be
the
job
of
Opposition
but
if
it
be
go
to
interrogate
the
government
,
it
should
not
use
empty
rhetoric
and
at
least
come
to
we
with
something
specific
that
critique
the
policy
we
be
put
forward
.
it
must
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
real
growth
in
the
economy
,
that
there
have
be
a
net
increase
in
job
,
that
we
be
continue
to
win
the
type
of
investment
that
be
necessary
across
a
myriad
of
sector
and
that
we
be
invest
in
this
sector
.
I
attend
a
InterTrade
Ireland
event
last
week
.
it
be
a
North
-
South
body
create
as
a
result
of
North
-
South
relation
.
I
meet
with
a
representative
from
Sinn
Féin
at
that
conference
.
there
be
a
acknowledgement
that
if
this
island
be
to
flourish
,
it
must
be
on
the
basis
of
build
cross-border
and
bilateral
link
with
we
neighbour
.
the
more
we
can
emb
that
within
the
system
and
the
more
opportunity
we
can
create
through
agency
like
InterTradeIreland
,
the
more
we
will
raise
the
economic
ship
of
this
island
.
I
apologise
for
the
fact
that
I
do
not
have
enough
time
to
respond
to
all
the
point
raise
.

be
the

I
refer
to

I
be
stand
in
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
who
be
abroad
on
business
.
both
he
and
I
have
be
greatly
encourage
by
the
level
of
support
express
by
Member
for
the
criminal
Justice
(
spend
Conviction
)
Bill
2012
.
it
be
historic
legislation
that
be
at
one
with
other
initiative
aim
at
make
we
criminal
justice
system
work
good
for
society
.
we
want
to
reduce
crime
,
see
offender
catch
and
bring
to
justice
.
we
want
they
to
undergo
whatever
sanction
the
court
impose
,
not
from
desire
for
revenge
but
to
ensure
that
who
offend
against
society
pay
they
debt
to
society
for
do
so
.
many
issue
be
raise
during
second
stage
which
I
be
confident
will
be
deal
with
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Shatter
,
on
Committee
stage
.
deputy
McNamara
raise
the
issue
of
the
T
case
of
which
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
be
aware
.
however
,
it
be
we
understanding
that
the
UK
government
will
appeal
it
to
the
Supreme
Court
.
the
Department
will
consider
the
implication
,
if
any
,
of
the
final
determination
of
that
case
for
we
vetting
arrangement
and
for
this
Bill
.
the
UK
system
of
vetting
be
very
different
to
ours
and
direct
comparison
be
not
necessarily
correct
.
this
can
be
revisit
on
committee
stage
.
on
the
point
raise
by
Deputy
Catherine
Murphy
and
Ryan
,
the
Bill
be
amend
in

provide
for
the
situation
they

offence
regard
one
incident
,
it
be
to
be
treat

.
I
thank

for
they
contribution
.
the

and
I
appreciate
the
general
welcome
give
to
this
Bill
.
all
the
suggestion
as
to
how
it
could
be
improve
will
be
consider
on

I
move

to

it
be
expect
that

it

note

the
deputy
can
rest
assure
that
the
responsible
minister
will
continue
to
closely
monitor
development
on
this
issue
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
that
it
be
farcical
for
one
minister
of
State
to
respond
to
four
issue
.
however
,
I
know
the
minister
,
deputy
James
Reilly
,
and
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Reilly
,
would
engage
directly
with
he
on
he
question
about
who
be
on
the
steering
group
and
the
detail
of
cost
and
timeline
.
I
note
,
however
,
that
the
patient
be
represent
on
the
group
and
,
if
the
process
be
work
properly
,
it
should
address
the
need
of
patient
and
they
family
.
I
tend
to
agree
with
the
deputy
on
the
issue
.
I
have
have
similar
experience
in
my
own
area
and
ensure
the
regional
director
of
operation
be
answerable
to
I
on
any
issue
arise
.
I
recognise
that
it
be
important
to
raise
this
issue
in
the
House
and
apologise
to
the
deputy
for
my
lack
of
intimate
knowledge
of
they
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
he
early
forbearance
.
I
have
now
be
provide
with
a
reply
from
the
Minister
of
social
Protection
,
who
be
out
of
the
country
at
this
time
.
social
welfare
legislation
provide
that
a
person
must
satisfy
the
condition
of
be
available
for
and
genuinely
seek
work
in
order
to
be
entitle
to
a
jobseeker

payment
.
any
person
who
fail
to
satisfy
this
condition
on
a
ongoing
basis
be
not
entitle
to
such
payment
.
obviously
,
to
be
fair
to
the
gentleman
mention
by
the
deputy
,
that
do
not
apply
in
he
case
.
unlike
other
jobseeker
,
who
must
sign
off
the
live
register
on
any
day
on
which
they
find

,
part

firefighter
be
pay
a
jobseeker
's
payment
in
respect
of
day
on
which
they
be
engage
in
firefighting
or
training
.
they
be
,
however
,
require
to
satisfy
other
statutory
condition
for
the
receipt
of
a
jobseeker
's
payment
-
that
be
,
they
must
continue
to
be
available
for
and
genuinely
seek
work
.
in
this
respect
,
decide
officer
do
not
treat
they
differently
from
any
other
jobseeker
.
I
accept
the
point
the
deputy
have
make
in
this
regard
,
but
I
do
not
have
the
full
detail
of
the
case
to
hand
.
with
regard
to
deal
with
the
systemic
issue
,
I
be
familiar
with
the
problem

of
the

again
,
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
it
would
do
no
harm
be
the

the

as

process
.
I
thank

of
the
type
and
issuing
of
transcript
of

I

respond
on

of
the
Minister

Health
.
it
be

a
average

be
type
at
Tallaght
hospital
each
month
.
Standard
non-urgent
report
be
usually
produce
within
two
or
three
week
.
the
number
of
report
that
need
to
be
type
have
increase
due
to
initiative
to
improve
access
to
imaging
.
more
patient
be
receive
radiography
examination
in
Tallaght
because
of
high
productivity
and
good
facility
.
for
example
,
a
second
ct
scanner
be
open
in
December
2012
.
a
initiative
with
Naas
General
Hospital
reduce
the
MRI
waiting
list
by
16
%
in
16
week
.
some
6000
examination
,
or
3.5
%
of
the
annual
total
of
172000

be
currently
untyped

some
3000
of
this
untyped

relate

.
the
remain
untyped

date
from

February
last

.
as
the
standard
turnaround
time
for
routine

be
two
to
three
week
,
this
tape
be
currently
delay
by
a
further
two
or
three
week
.
the
radiology
department
,
the
diagnostic
directorate
and
the
executive
team
be
take
a
number
of
step
to
address
this
issue
.
additional
clerical
support
be
be
provide
in
the
radiology
unit
to
assist
with
the
type
of
tape
.
it
be
intend
that
the
backlog
will
be
clear
in
approximately
five
week
.
the
hospital
have
initiate
demand
management
protocol
within
national
guideline
to
avoid
the
need
for
report
on
specific
image
such
as
orthopaedic
.
a
integrated
voice
recognition
system
that
be
pilot
last
year
will
be
introduce
from
early
April
.
this
will
eliminate
the
need
to
type
transcript
for
approximately
65
%
of
the
radiology
workload
.
it
be
expect
that
voice
recognition
for
all
reporting
in
Tallaght
will
be
fully
implement
by
the
first
quarter
of
2014
as
part
of
the
roll
-
out
of
the
national
integrate
medical
imaging
system
.
this
will
eliminate
the
need
to
transcribe
radiology
report
.
I
will
do
so
.
I
acknowledge
everything
that
have
be
say
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
important
matter
,
which
I
be
take
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Phil
Hogan
.
local

in

with
the
detail
enter
in
the
valuation
list
prepare
by
the
independent
commissioner
of
Valuation
under
the
Valuation
Act
2001
.
any
of
we
who
have
serve
on
local
authority
would
acknowledge
the
point
deputy
Lyons
have
make
in
this
regard
.
the
levying
and
collection
of
rate
be
matter
for
each
individual
local
authority
.
the
annual
rate
on
valuation
,
ARV
,
which
be
apply
to
the
valuation
of
each

,
determine
by
the

to
obtain
the
amount
payable

,
be
decide
by
the
elect
member
of
each
local
authority
in
the
annual
budget
and
its
determination
be
a
reserve
function
.
the
government
have
no
plan
at
this
juncture
to
introduce
a
temporary
levy
on
large
out
-
of
-
town
retail
operation
.
in
term
of
planning
policy
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Hogan
,
and
the
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
housing
and
planning
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
publish
new
development
contribution
guideline
in
January
2012
.
the
new
guideline
build
on
the
experience
gain
in
recent
year
and
also
align
development
contribution
policy
with
the
government
's
prioritisation
of
employment
creation
,
investment
and
sustainable
development
,
a
point
the
deputy
address
in
he
contribution
.
above
all
,
the
guideline
be
intend
to
support
proper
planning
and
sustainable
development
while
also
prioritise
job
creation
and
economic
investment
.
all
in
this
House
,
across
the
political
spectrum
,
be
aware
of
the
pressure
on
small
and
medium
enterprise
and
intergenerational
business
in
place
like
Naas
and
Finglas
,
to
which
the
deputy
refer
.
in
that
context
,
local
authority
have
be
ask
by
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
by
way
of
a
circular
letter
,
to
exercise
restraint
or
,
where
possible
,
reduce
commercial
rate
and
local
charge
for
2013
.
local
authority
have
respond
well
to
such
request
in
recent
year
and
,
in
2013
,
87
out
of
the
88
rating
authority
have
either
reduce
they
arv
or
keep
it
the
same
as
in
2012
.
the
deputy
refer
to
the
government
's
action
programme
for
effective
local
government
,
put
People
first
.
this
indicate
that
,
in
the
context
of
reorganisation
of
local
governance
structure
,
the
propose
new
municipal
district
will
provide
a
opportunity
to
achieve
a
more
coherent
approach
to
rate
and
charge
on
a
county
-
wide
basis
,
have
regard
to
funding
requirement
and
the
need
to
support
employment
and
business
competitiveness
.
to
be
honest
,
I
do
not
know
how
that
dynamic
will
work
in
Finglas
and
it
be
probably
easy
to
map
that
potential
in
term
of
county
such
as
Cork
,
where
there
be
distinct
municipal
area
that
do
not
border
on
a
large
metropolitan
area
.
it
will
be
a
challenge
,
and
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
point
in
this
regard
.
the
action
programme
propose
rate
harmonisation
to
cater
for
difference
between
ars
of
town
and
county
.
the
minister
's
approach
to
rate
harmonisation
will
seek
to
ensure
,
on
the
one
hand
,
that
harmonisation
do
not
lead
to
significant
net
loss
of
revenue
in
individual
county
,
with
consequential
implication
for
service
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
increase
in
rate
do
not
impact
negatively
on
business
and
employment
.
the
minister
have
inform
I
that
he
will
continue
to
keep
the
approach
to
rate
by
local
authority
under
active
review
and
that
he
be
determine
every
avenue
will
be
pursue
to
optimise
efficiency
and
contain
cost
in
the
local
government
sector
.
I
be
get
a
bit
peckish
think
of
four
Star
Pizza
.
it
be
a
long
way
to
Cork
.
I
might
pop
in
.
on
a
serious
note
,
I
concur
with
what
the
deputy
be
say
.
we
be
see
that
effect
throughout
the
landscape
.
there
be
factor
other
than
rate
influence
that
dynamic
.
the
deputy
be
right
about
out
-
of
-
town
multiple
be
able
to
house
all
product
across
a
broad
spectrum
,
which
be
certainly
have
a
effect
on
small
town
and
village
.
Small
town
and
village
must
be
creative
because
consumption
have
modify
considerably
.
conspicuous
consumption
have
virtually
flat
-
line
and
we
might
have
to
be
more
creative
about
how
we
re-imagine
town
centre
and
village
.
I
take
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
.

I
be
take
this
important
matter
on
behalf
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
,
who
wish
I
to
convey
he
apology
to
the
House
regard
the
fact
that
he
be
not
able
to
be
present
to
discuss
it
.
I
fully
acknowledge
the
concern
that
have
be
raise
.
we
have
all
receive
visit
to
we
constituency
office
from
farmer
in
recent
week
.
I
be
aware
that
the
Dairygold
Co-op
in
my
area
be
plan
to
import
hay
from
the
UK
in
order
to
try
to
alleviate
the
shortage
.
we
be
very
conscious
of
the
situation
in
which
farmer
,
particularly
that
who
live
in
more
disadvantaged
area
,
find
themselves
at
present
.
the
minister
have
ask
I
to
convey
he
acute
awareness
of
the
difficulty
be
experience
by
some
farmer
as
a
result
of
recent
unseasonable
weather
.
the
difficult
condition
which
obtain
on
farm
last
summer
have
be
compound
by
the
extend
winter
.
we
acknowledge
that
the
harsh
weather
of
recent
week
have
lead
to
delay
grass
growth
and
to
increase
demand
for
fodder
and
feed
.
animal
which
,
in
normal
condition
,
would
be
on
grass
at
this
time
of
year
have
have
to
be
keep
indoors
.
while
it
be
important
to
record
that
the
outlook
for
we
livestock
sector
remain
positive
and
that
price
be
relatively
strong
,
it
be
clear
that
the
condition
prevail
at
present
have
result
in
short
—
term
but
significant
management
challenge
.
this
include
cashflow
and
credit
issue
-
to
which
the
Member
opposite
refer
-
for
affect
farmer
who
be
face
with
the
burden
of
fodder
shortage
and
additional
feed
cost
.
in
the
context
of
the
measure
which
can
be
take
to
alleviate
the
problem
on
farm
,
the
minister
urge
farmer
to
contact
they
local
Teagasc
adviser
.
where
winter
fodder
be
limit
,
Teagasc
be
provide
specific
advice
and
assistance
on
how
to
cope
with
the
consequence
of
the
weather
condition
experience
this
spring
.
staff
at
all
Teagasc
office
be
available
to
provide
advice
to
farmer
over
the
phone
.
agricultural
adviser
be
equip
and
ready
to
outline
the
option
open
to
farmer
face
difficulty
and
to
make
plan
which
well
suit
they
situation
.
Teagasc
have
also
make
extensive
use
of
national
and
local
media
to
provide
farmer
with
advice
and
have
co-ordinate
with
farm
organisation
,
mart
,
local
authority
,
co-op
and
other
supplier
to
provide
target
advice
to
all
who
need
it
.
advice
for
farmer
on
coping
with
fodder
shortage
have
also
be
publish
,
include
guideline
to
dairy
and
drystock
farmer
with
little
or
no
grass
on
feed
this
spring
.
the
minister
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
Teagasc
for
its
effort
to
date
and
ask
that
this
be
intensify
in
the
come
day
until
the
problem
be
experience
be
alleviate
by
grass
growth
.
the
minister
also
note
that
farm
body
have
urge
farmer
to
assess
whether
they
have
surplus
fodder
in
stock
and
whether
they
be
in
a
position
to
make
some
available
to
other
in
difficulty
.
this
effort
be
to
be
commend
and
the
minister
echow
the
call
for
that
in
need
of
assistance
to
be
support
and
urge
people
who
have
fodder
to
spare
to
be
proactive
in
make
it
available
to
neighbour
farmer
who
be
encounter
severe
problem
.
this
be
a
occasion
when
solidarity
be
need
among
the
farming
community
.
it
be
also
the
case
that
farmer
have
increase
the
usage
of
concentrate
to
fill
the
fodder
gap
.
while
address
the
fodder
issue
,
in
some
case
this
have
result
in
problem
with
cashflow
and
access
to
work
capital
on
farm
.
in
response
to
farmer
's
concern
in
this
regard
,
the
minister
have
already
write
to
the
bank
and
will
meet
they
shortly
to
highlight
the
extreme
challenge
face
farmer
as
a
result
of
the
weather
.
at
that
point
,
he
will
urge
they
to
take
a
flexible
approach
to
deal
with
short
-
term
credit
issue
.
he
will
also
write
to
the
grain
and
feed
merchant
to
urge
they
to
be
flexible
during
this
difficult
period
.
it
be
important
that
financial
institution
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
while
the
current
difficulty
may
cause
cashflow
pressure
for
farmer
,
the
overall
outlook
for
the
sector
be
favourable
.
commodity
price
be
very
strong
and
the
positive
expectation
for
dairy
,
beef
and
lamb
price
mean
that
farmer
should
see
improve
market
return
for
they
produce
this
year
.
the
minister
would
also
ask
that
co-op
and
other
operate
in
the
agrifood
sector
be
sensitive
to
the
particular
difficulty
be
experience
by
farmer
supplier
this
spring
.
the
minister
recently
announce
a
extension
,
to
15
May
2013
,
for
the
closing
off
of
the
traditional
hay
meadow
measure
in
the
agri-environment
option
scheme
.
he
have
allow
a
deferral
of
one
month
to
the
closing
-
off
date
and
this
will
help
to
maximise
grass
utilisation
in
the
critical
recovery
period
as
the
weather
improve
and
grass
growth
resume
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
availability
of
forage
on
farm
present
a
ongoing
challenge
.
the
minister
have
great
confidence
,
however
,
in
the
resilience
and
ingenuity
of
the
Irish
farming
community
.
the
improvement
in
soil
temperature
during
the
past
week
be
very
welcome
and
should
see
a
return
to
more
normal
growth
rate
for
grass
and
crop
alike
.
this
,
together
with
relatively
positive
market
condition
,
should
see
a
significant
improvement
in
the
situation
in
the
come
week
.
I
take
the
Acting
Chairman
's
point
,
but
my
understanding
be
that
,
with
due
respect
to
the
chair
,
three
speaker
indicate
under
the
rule
of
the
House
and
four
speaker
be
grant
time
.
if
it
be
my
fault
that
the
time
allocation
have
be
impact
upon
,
I
apologise
and
stand
correct
.
no
deputy
do
not
acknowledge
the
problem
face
farmer
,
particularly
that
in
rural
and
disadvantaged
area
.
some
of
the
prescribe
solution
border
on
blind
rhetoric
.
fair
enough
,
as
that
be
part
and
parcel
of
what
we
be
about
in
the
House
.
however
,
that
a
former
cabinet
minister
claim
that
€
10
million
should
be
make
available
from
administration
and
other
source
within
the
Department
lead
I
to
the
conclusion
that
-----
-----
it
should
be
take
from
other
scheme
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
the
deputy
should
prescribe
from
which
scheme
and
farmer
the
money
would
be
take
.
this
be
a
difficult
situation
.
some
reasonable
intervention
be
make
about
the
potential
development
of
a
hardship
fund
.
in
that
sense
,
I
will
convey
the
deputy
's
concern
to
the
minister
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
have
a
technical
response
on
child
ingest
detergent
"
liquitab
"
and
I
will
outline
it
with
you
indulgence
,
acting
chairman
.
okay
.
I
take
the
point
.
I
understand
that
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
be
in
contact
with
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
,
HSA
,
as
the
competent
authority
for
detergent
regulation
last
August
to
September
,
as
it
be
concerned
about
the
number
of
incident
report
-
as
highlight
by
the
deputy
-
involve
child
and
liquid
detergent
tablet
.
more
than
50
%
of
the
inquiry
to
the
poison
centre
's
helpline
related
to
incident
with
"
liquitab
"
involve
child
,
with
the
majority
be
between
one
to
three
year
old
.
this
product
be
small
,
with
a
soft
texture
which
mean
they
be
easy
for
child
to
pick
up
and
squeeze
or
put
into
they
mouth
.
I
be
state
the
obvious
.
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
be
also
aware
of
a
report
in
the
media
in
2012
from
Scotland
,
report
five
child
,
all
under
the
age
of
two
,
who
be
admit
to
hospital
over
a
18
month
period
as
emergency
with
stridor
-
or
a
abnormal
breathing
sound
indicative
of
a
blockage
in
the
throat
-
and
drool
after
bite
into
a
liquid
detergent
capsule
.
as
a
result
of
that
and
information
from
the
UK
,
treatment
guideline
now
advise
that
"
child
aged
under
five
year
who
be
asymptomatic
but
have
be
expose
to
this
product
within
the
last
two
hour
should
be
refer
for
medical
assessment
"
.
therefore
,
it
be
essential
that
parent
and
guardian
contact
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
for
advice
if
they
child
ingest
a
"
liquitab
"
.
in
response
,
the
HSA
meet
with
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
and
with
the
manufacturing
company
who
be
place
this
product
on
the
Irish
market
to
discuss
the
issue
arise
.
the
HSA
also
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
EU
Commission
and
colleague
EU
member
state
.
in
response
to
its
engagement
with
industry
on
the
issue
,
all
of
that
company
that
place
the
product
on
the
market
in
Ireland
sign
up
to
the
voluntary
product
stewardship
programme
in
December
2012
,
which
involve
commitment
to
change
the
packaging
to
reduce
the
visibility
of
the
capsule
and
to
restrict
access
to
the
capsule
by
small
child
.
the
programme
also
cover
product
information
and
communication
about
keep
this
product
out
of
the
reach
of
child
,
as
well
as
a
awareness
campaign
design
to
keep
such
product
-
along
with
household
chemical
-
out
of
the
reach
of
child
.
the
campaign
be
be
prepare
by
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
with
the
engagement
of
industry
.
all
product
packaging
change
should
be
in
place
by
June
2013
.
the
HSA
and
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
continue
to
monitor
and
review
the
progress
of
the
product
stewardship
plan
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
as
recently
as
last
month
,
the
HSA
meet
with
the
IBEC
industry
representative
and
be
update
on
proposal
in
hand
with
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
concern
awareness
plan
for
the
product
,
along
with
progress
on
change
to
product
packaging
.
last
November
,
the
HSA
formally
raise
the
matter
at
EU
level
.
in
particular
,
the
HSA
seek
to
explore
the
possibility
of
take
action
under
the
EU
detergent
regulation
or
the
EU
dangerous
preparation
directive
as
a
means
of
address
the
current
issue
.
the
EU
Commission
's
consider
view
be
that
if
EU
measure
be
consider
necessary
,
the
provision
of
the
general
product
safety
directive
could
be
use
for
immediate
action
and
for
long
-
term
measure
and
what
be
know
as
a
"
restriction
"
proposal
under
the
EU
reach
regulation
could
be
examine
.
the
commission
have
indicate
,
however
,
that
while
further
discussion
would
be
require
with
member
state
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
measure
,
it
would
prefer
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
voluntary
action
be
undertake
by
industry
.
I
be
close
to
the
end
of
the
response
.
AISE
-
the
EU
industry
representative
organisation
for
the
sector
-
explain
that
the
capsule
have
be
develop
to
meet
"
sustainability
"
challenge
and
consumer
request
for
"
easy
to
use
"
detergent
.
one
might
say
that
could
be
deem
as
a
typical
industry
response
.
it
also
outline
the
action
already
put
in
place
or
ongoing
by
practically
all
individual
company
concerned
and
present
proposal
for
further
future
action
,
include
specific
labelling
and
warning
icon
on
the
packaging
and
awareness
raising
campaign
.
I
have
a
few
more
point
to
make
but
in
recognition
of
the
amount
of
time
available
I
will
conclude
now
and
respond
follow
deputy
Conway
's
supplementary
question
.
again
,
I
fully
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.
it
be
fair
to
say
-
I
speak
objectively
-
that
the
HSA
be
quite
fastidious
in
term
of
how
it
approach
matter
such
as
this
one
.
the
government
be
happy
to
allow
the
HSA
to
continue
to
work
with
the
National
Poison
Information
Centre
to
monitor
and
review
progress
on
the
voluntary
product
stewardship
programme
.
if
further
measure
be
necessary
there
be
potential
for
the
backup
of
potential
reach
-
type
legislation
at
EU
level
on
the
matter
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
move
:
"
that
the
Bill
be
now
read
a
second
Time
.
"
I
will
briefly
outline
the
principal
objective
of
the
Bill
.
the
primary
change
extend
the
remit
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
.
through
funding
support
via
we
high
education
institution
,
SFI
will
be
able
to
fund
apply
research
as
well
as
continue
to
support
orient
basic
research
.
this
will
allow
SFI
to
take
the
outcome
of
the
research
close
to
market
through
increase
commercialisation
,
the
development
of
new
product
,
the
generation
of
new
service
and
technology
and
lead
to
the
creation
of
new
sustainable
quality
job
for
Ireland
.
I
stress
that
the
foundation
will
continue
to
support
basic
research
.
the
legislation
will
also
allow
SFI
to
broaden
its
programme
offering
to
cover
the
14
priority
and
six
underpin
area
identify
by
the
research
prioritisation
steering
group
and
approve
by
government
in
March
2012
.
importantly
,
the
legislation
will
also
enable
the
foundation
to
provide
funding
on
a
all
-
island
basis
for
the
first
time
.
subject
to
the
excellence
and
strategic
criterion
be
meet
,
SFI
will
therefore
be
able
to
fund
researcher
and
institution
base
in
Northern
Ireland
.
it
will
also
allow
the
foundation
to
enter
,
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
collaborative
arrangement
with
international
partner
and
help
Ireland
leverage
significant
non-Exchequer
research
funding
into
the
country
.
in
do
so
,
it
will
also
enable
Ireland
to
support
the
wide
EU
research
agenda
through
programme
be
support
under
the
EU
's
Horizon
2020
strategy
,
which
will
have
approximately
€
70
billion
available
in
research
funding
from
2014
onwards
.
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
I
be
eager
that
Ireland
should
aggressively
target
Horizon
2020
funding
and
the
extend
SFI
legislation
should
enhance
we
success
rate
.
the
Bill
also
provide
a
legislative
basis
for
SFI
to
stimulate
the
study
and
awareness
of
the
STEM
subject
:
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
.
in
addition
,
it
include
a
number
of
ancillary
provision
that
be
not
specific
to
SFI
,
but
which
relate
to
Enterprise
Ireland
,
El
,
IDA
Ireland
and
enterprise
development
function
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
;
amendment
of
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
specific
to
we
enterprise
agency
;
and
strengthen
Forfás
's
function
to
provide
research
datum
so
as
to
fall
in
line
with
international
good
practice
.
I
shall
comment
further
on
this
late
but
I
will
first
give
a
brief
overview
of
the
recent
progression
of
we
research
and
innovation
system
,
of
SFI
and
its
role
and
of
the
rationale
for
the
change
propose
in
the
Bill
.
this
legislation
afford
we
a
ideal
opportunity
to
remind
ourselves
of
the
reason
government
around
the
world
fund
research
and
development
.
it
be
universally
accept
that
the
private
sector
do
not
fund
research
and
development
at
the
optimum
level
for
economic
and
societal
benefit
.
there
be
many
reason
for
this
but
primary
among
they
be
the
inherent
risk
and
uncertainty
of
such
investment
.
the
commercial
return
from
research
and
development
investment
,
particularly
in
basic
research
,
be
often
insufficiently
clear
-
cut
for
the
private
investor
.
another
likely
factor
be
that
the
direct
return
to
the
private
research
and
development
investor
be
often
eclipse
by
the
societal
return
.
consider
research
in
a
Irish
context
,
I
do
not
subscribe
to
the
argument
that
Ireland
,
as
a
small
open
economy
,
can
simply
avoid
significant
investment
in
research
and
development
,
particularly
basic
research
,
and
simultaneously
take
advantage
of
and
benefit
from
discovery
make
elsewhere
.
Discovery
,
and
the
benefit
it
bring
,
do
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
.
if
Ireland
be
to
absorb
externally
generate
new
knowledge
and
take
advantage
of
it
,
we
must
have
the
capability
to
understand
and
use
this
new
knowledge
.
the
good
way
of
ensure
we
can
create
new
knowledge
be
to
conduct
excellent
and
relevant
research
and
development
ourselves
.
Ireland
need
to
be
a
"
knowledge
generator
"
if
further
creator
of
knowledge
be
to
be
entice
to
the
country
.
a
constantly
develop
and
change
global
economy
and
society
require
Ireland
to
keep
pace
if
we
position
in
the
international
marketplace
be
to
be
maintain
and
enhance
.
we
must
continue
to
invest
appropriately
in
create
and
innovate
to
ensure
we
can
successfully
compete
in
global
term
.
this
be
just
some
of
the
reason
the
government
need
to
encourage
and
supplement
private
investment
in
research
and
development
.
in
Ireland
,
there
have
be
significant
public
investment
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
since
the
late
1990
-
primarily
to
address
a
number
of
critical
deficit
.
follow
decade
of
under
investment
in
research
and
development
we
lag
well
behind
we
competitor
.
we
research
capability
then
be
well
below
the
OECD
norm
.
we
lack
a
core
of
talented
,
high
quality
research
personnel
,
perform
industrially
relevant
research
.
this
combination
of
factor
imped
we
ability
to
attract
and
maintain

scale
,
knowledge
intensive
industrial
project
to
Ireland
while
we
be
simultaneously
fail
to
develop
indigenous
,
internationally
competitive
,
high
growth
firm
.
we
industrial
policy
in
the
latter
part
of
the
1990
,
therefore
,
come
to
be
base
on
the
conclusion
that
we
need
to
move
up
the
employment
value
chain
by
generate
we
own
research
talent
pool
to
create
the
job
of
the
future
and
diversify
from
low
cost
,
low
end
manufacturing
.
in
this
context
,
in
1998
,
the
Irish
Council
for
Science
,
Technology
and
Innovation
undertake
a
technology
foresight
exercise
,
which
seek
to
identify
emerge
area
that
would
be
the
key
to
we
economic
development
and
enhance
competitiveness
.
the
result

report
recommend
that
government
should
establish
a
fund
to
enable
Ireland
to
become

deputy
Ó
Caoláin
have
be
relentless
in
pursue
justice
for
the
woman
.
in
spite
of
the
many
difficulty
and
frustration
he
have
experience
over
the
year
,
he
never
give
up
.
have
read
the
woman
's
story
,
I
find
it
horrifying
to
imagine
the
procedure
.
I
cannot
imagine
what
it
must
have
be
like
to
have
go
through
it
.
the
one
word
to
describe
the
procedure
be
barbaric
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
reconcile
that
barbarism
with
what
we
associate
with
the
medical
profession
.
doctor
swear
the
hippocratic
oath
,
which
be
basically
about
practise
medicine
ethically
and
honestly
.
while
there
be
variation
of
the
oath
,
I
read
today
a
comment
that
warmth
,
sympathy
and
understanding
may
outweigh
the
surgeon
's
knife
or
the
chemist
's
drug
.
warmth
,
sympathy
and
understanding
be
very
sadly
lack
for
the
woman
involve
.
I
join
other
in
acknowledge
the
woman
present
in
the
Visitor
Gallery
who
suffer
that
cruelty
.
I
acknowledge
they
pain
-
for
many
of
they
they
acute
continue
pain
.
they
have
get
on
with
they
life
throughout
all
that
pain
through
perseverance
and
the
great
support
they
give
each
other
.
deputy
Ó
Caoláin
mention
mutilation
,
which
be
also
a
apt
word
for
a
procedure
that
unhinge
the
pelvis
,
sever
joint
and
sunder
pubic
bone
.
some
woman
end
up
permanently
disabled
,
incontinent
and
in
pain
.
very
sadly
,
some
woman
lose
they
baby
follow
the
procedure
.
it
be
a
operation
that
be
undertake
with
no
explanation
give
to
the
woman
as
to
what
be
happen
-
never
mind
why
it
be
happen
.
the
last
time
we
discuss
the
matter
the
minister
make
certain
statement
about
this
be
a
standard
operation
,
mostly
use
as
emergency
surgery
and
safe
than
a
caesarean
section
.
he
do
not
accept
then
that
this
be
a
barbaric
act
.
however
,
all
of
that
be
refut
by
Ms
Marie
O'Connor
,
who
make
very
detailed
comment
about
each
of
that
point
.
I
listen
to
the
Minister
's
speech
from
my
office
after
I
have
to
leave
the
Chamber
.
I
acknowledge
that
he
make
a
commitment
to
deal
with
the
issue
sensitively
and
fairly
,
which
be
why
he
be
accept
the
Bill

it

it

it
beggar
belief
that
it
ever

down

road
of

.
I
note
the
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
.
the
review
commence
in
October
2010
under
the
Fianna
Fáil
-
Green
Party
Government
and
such
value
for
money
review
be
part
and
parcel
of
governance
within
the
State
.
it
be
important
that
we
try
to
ensure
as
we
good
we
can
that
the
etho
of
rural
school
be
maintain
in
the
context
of
the
positive
impact
they
have
on
they
community
.
I
again
acknowledge
the
deputy
's
concern
in
this
regard
and
I
reiterate
that
the
report
be
be
finalise
.
it
have
,
therefore
,
not
be
complete
and
the
concern
raise
by
both
deputy
should
form
part
of
the
policy
outcome
.
however
,
no
final
policy
decision
have
be
make
.
it
be
not
right
for
deputy
to
up
the
rhetoric
on
this
issue
when
a
final
decision
have
not
yet
be
make
.
in
the
case
of
rural
school
with
only
a
small
number
of
pupil
,
it
be
eminently
reasonable
and
sensible
to
proceed
with
amalgamation
when
they
can
be
achieve
through
a
process
of
consensus
.
the
annual
savings
to
be
achieve
be
available
for
everyone
to
see
.
the
budget
measure
set
out
a
target
of
save
250
post
over
a
three
year
period
.
deputy
McConalogue
be
a
member
of
the
party
which
instigate
the
review
in
question
.
let
we
be
honest
about
how
we
approach
this
issue
.
it
be
appropriate
to
have
a
value
for
money
report
on
small
school
.
it
be
not
propose
to
compromise
the
etho
that
exist
in
rural
community
.
I
do
not
propose
to
mouth
platitude
about
represent
either
a
rural
or
urban
community
because
most
deputy
be
familiar
with
the
importance
of
rural
school
and
they
positive
impact
on
local
community
.
from
a
policy
point
of
view
,
the
decision
must
have
regard
to
this
fact
.
the
State
Examination
Commission
,
SEC
,
have
statutory
responsibility
for
the
certificate

a

from

however

perhaps

which
he
refer

raise
it
directly
with

the

be
satisfied
that

process
operate
in
a
open
and
transparent
manner
.
notwithstanding
this
,
I
be
willing
to
examine
the
specific
critique
of
the
system
make
by
a
eminent
and
qualified
person
who
have
do
a
assessment
of
a
student
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
provide
I
with
the
detail
of
the
case
.
the
deputy
raise
a
issue
in
the
context
of
the
transition
from
junior
to
leave
certificate
in
term
of
one
be
a
devolve
system
while
the
other
be
independent
.
there
seem
to
be
a
question
regard
the
need
for
further
clarification
on
that
transition
in
the
context
of
how
the
two
-----
-----system
operate
.
the
deputy
indicate
that
he
have
refer
the
particular
case
involve
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
.
if
he
could
refer
it
again
-----
-----i
will
revert
to
he
on
the
matter
.
the
national
strategy
for

a
range
of

last
November
the

announce
the
establishment
of
the
national

for
the
enhancement
of

and

,
which
will
provide
a
platform
for

as

with
respect
,
I
hope
I
understand
the
deputy
's
question
.
if
he
be
express
concern
in
respect
of
the
focus
on
teaching
,
I
be
not
quite
clear
from
where
he
underlying
assumption
that
there
be
issue
around
teaching
within
the
third
level
sector
come
.
perhaps
I
miss
something
in
that
regard
.
there
be
a
national
strategy
in
respect
of
teaching
in
the
high
education
sector
.
the
national
forum
for
the
enhancement
of
teaching
and
learning
be
launch
in
November
2012
and
be
chair
by
Professor
Sarah
Moore
of
the
University
of
Limerick
.
the
national
forum
will
consolidate
and
build
upon
the
strength
of
exist
individual
institution
and
they
teaching
and
learning
framework
.
the
work
of
the
national
forum
be
under
way
and
I
hope
this
provide
a
answer
to
one
part
of
the
deputy
's
question
.
the
national
forum
will
provide
a
key
system
-
level
infrastructure
for
the
support
of
the
national
strategy
and
serve
as
a
platform
for
academic
-
lead
enhancement
of
teaching
.
its
focus
will
be
on
add
value
by
provide
a
structure
through
which
this
institutional
and
network
initiative
can
be
synergise
and
leverage
.
the
nascent
forum
hold
its
first
meeting
in
March
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
each
academic
institution
have
its
own
degree
of
autonomy
.
the
deputy
will
appreciate
the
high
education
block
grant
of
over
€
1
billion
.
I
be
of
the
view
that
the
aim
behind
the
national
strategy
will
complement
the
goal
of
we
make
a
great
economic
impact
through
the
creation
of
further
job
and
enhance
people
's
learning
experience
.
as
already
state
,
in
the
context
of
the
teaching
experience
the
national
forum
be
examine
the
development
of
innovative
pedagogy
and
the
technology
which
support
this
.
in
itself
,
this
be
quite
innovative
.
it
be
also
consider
whether
it
might
be
necessary
to
broaden
student
's
first
year
experience
or
whether
prescribe
course
should
be
retain
.
the
straight
answer
to
the
deputy
's
question
on
mining
datum
be
that
such
datum
be
already
available
.
I
be
just
about
to
say
that
measure
teaching
outcome
from
either
a
quantitative
or
qualitative
point
of
view
be
quite
challenging
,
particularly
in
view
of
the
different
academic
etho
which
obtain
within
the
various
high
education
institution
.
one
way
to
try
to
ensure
more
efficient
outcome
from
a
teaching
point
of
view
be
to
consider
professional
academic
development
and
the
research
which
underpin
it
.
the
system
at
post
-
primary
level
be
highly
evolve
.
there
should
also
be
a
system
that
be
promote
at
tertiary
level
.
if
there
be
great
academic
professional
development
,
there
be
good
teacher
,
more
specialty
be
create
and
good
outcome
be
drive
.
this
issue
be
be
consider
as
part
of
the
national
forum
.
the
straight
answer
to
the
deputy
's
question
be
that
I
be
unsure
as
to
whether
we
have
that
datum
.
we
can
check
for
he
.
however
,
there
be
a
focus
on
he
point
regard
the
need
for
metric
and
index
.
the
"
teacher
's
Voice
"
be
a
report
base
on
the
Association
of
Secondary
teacher
,
Ireland
,
ASTI
's
consultation
with
teacher
on
the
new
framework
for
junior
cycle
.
it
be
valuable
to
have
access
to
this
finding
,
which
be
be
consider
within
the
department
.
at
the
ASTI
conference
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
make
a
point
of
commend
the
ASTI
for
the
content
of
the
report
and
the
process
that
lead
to
its
publication
.
he
have
read
the
report
and
be
listen
carefully
to
the
concern
of
teacher
.
the
Department
have
establish
a
education

with

the

I
take
the
point
make
by
the
president
of
the
ASTI
.
it
conduct
a
survey
of
teacher
,
the
response
of
whom
be
clear
and
have
be
acknowledge
by
the
minister
,
but
Mr.
Breslin
state
that
,
while
it
be
clear
from
teacher
's
response
that
some
aspect
of
the
minister
's
framework
have
the
potential
to
improve
the
educational
experience
of
young
people
in

,
teacher
be
resoundingly
state
that
this
potential
be
contingent
upon
assessment
and
certification
procedure
that
be
fair
,
transparent
and
,
critically
,
do
not
undermine
educational
standard
.
there
be
cross-party
agreement
on
this
point
,
give
the
fact
that
the
House
have
pass
a
motion
support
the
junior
cycle
reform
.
the
Member
opposite
vote
in
favour
of
that
reform
.
there
be
a
process
of
consultation
.
there
be
pageantry
and
choreography
to
this
setpiece
event
in
the
Chamber
.
as
a
opposition
spokesperson
,
there
be
a
little
jousting
and
political
point
scoring
.
that
be
fair
enough
,
but
every
deputy
acknowledge
the
need
for
junior
cycle
reform
and
want
it
to
go
the
right
way
and
to
be
base
on
consensus
and
consultation
.
there
should
be
proper
continue
professional
development
for
teacher
if
they
be
to
embrace
a
new
way
of
teaching
.
the
assessment
aspect
will
be
concerned
with
improve
learning
outcome
and
not
just
prove
they
,
if
the
deputy
know
what
I
mean
.
the
role
of
the
ASTI
and
teacher
in
this
will
be
paramount
.
it
be
the
most
important
role
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
ongoing
consultation
with
teacher
and
they
representative
organisation
.
there
be
a
mechanism
to
this
end
as
the
junior
cycle
be
roll
out
.
I
do
not
know
whether
I
can
elaborate
further
.
as
the
deputy
will
be
aware
,
there
be
two
school
on
this
site
,
a
junior
school
and
a
senior
school
,
both
of
which
have
temporary
accommodation
in
addition
to
they
permanent
structure
and
have
apply
to
the
department
for
replacement
permanent
building
.
the
next
step
to
progress
a
building
project
for
the
school
involve
the
appointment
of
a
design
team
and
the
commencement
of
the
architectural
planning
process
.
school
building
project
such
as
this
one
that
be
not
include
in
the
five
-
year
construction
programme
will
continue
to
be
progress
to
final
planning
stage
in
anticipation
of
further
fund
be
available
to
the
Department
in
the
future
.
my
Department
have
decide
to
build
a
new
primary
school
close
to
the
school
in
question
in
order
to
meet
a
identify
demographic
need
in
the
area
.
Lucan
have
be
identify
as
a
area
in
which
there
will
be
a
requirement
for
significant
additional
school
provision
at
post
-
primary
and
primary
level
during
the
come
year
.
it
be
within
this
context
that
,
in
2011
,
the
minister
announce
the
future
establishment
of
a
new
1000
-
pupil
second
level
school
and
a
new
16
-
classroom
primary
school
.
the
primary
school
will
open
in
temporary
accommodation
in
September
2013
under
the
patronage
of
County
Dublin
vec
.
it
will
be
a
multidenominational
,
English
medium
,
co-educational
primary
school
.
both
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
will
cater
for
increase
demographic
demand
in
the
general
Lucan
area
.
the
deputy
should
make
the
request
.
the
deputy
should
make
the
request
in
writing
.
it
be
on
the
record
.
the
deputy
will
appreciate
that
the
demographic
issue
be
clear
.
his
situation
in
Lucan
be
not
untypical
of
other
part
of
the
country
,
include
my
area
where
there
be
serious
demographic
demand
.
there
be
a
feeling
among
exist
school
that
they
have
be
bypass
in
favour
of
the
creation
of
new
school
.
however
,
the
demographic
projection
figure
do
not
lie
and
therefore
we
face
a
cliff
in
certain
part
of
the
country
in
term
of
educational
provision
and
it
be
necessary
to
build
new
school
.
without
plámás
,
I
sympathise
with
the
view
express
by
deputy
Keating
.
if
he
make
a
request
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
the
minister
will
take
it
from
there
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
7
,
34
,
48
and
59
together
.
the
promotion
of
student
well
-
being
and
positive
mental
health
strategy
in
school
be
a
key
aim
of
my
department
.
accordingly
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
direct
my
Department
's
support
service
to
review
and
prioritise
support
for
school
on
the
guideline
for
mental
health
promotion
which
he
launch
recently
with
my
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kathleen
Lynch
.
the
guideline

and

to

the

relevant
support
for
school
be
outline
in
the
document
.
I
accept
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
.
perhaps
it
be
a
commentary
on
life
in
this
country
at
present
for
people
who
be
unemployed
,
employ
or
in
specific
profession
that
the
level
of
stress
have
increase
dramatically
.
we
have
have
a
recession
for
more
than
five
year
at
this
stage
and
that
take
its
toll
.
decision
have
be
make
on
budgetary
issue
pertain
to
education
involve
a
reduction
in
service
as
a
result
of
the
macroeconomic
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
in
my
experience
,
teacher
as
a
cohort
be
very
supportive
of
each
other
in
term
of
develop
mechanism
for
deal
with
stress
.
I
have
a
open
mind
on
the
issue
.
I
honestly
do
not
know
how
the
Department
can
put
in
place
mechanism
that
be
fund
to
assist
teacher
specifically
to
alleviate
stress
.
I
do
not
know
how
one
would
achieve
that
without
achieve
it
in
other
area
of
the
public
sector
also
.
there
be
definite
guideline
on
student
.
it
be
a
apolitical
space
.
through
provide
guideline
for
the
promotion
of
mental
health
and
suicide
prevention
,
the
State
be
do
a
lot
to
ensure
the
health
and
well
-
being
of
pupil
.
the
straight
answer
to
the
deputy
's
question
be
that
I
do
not
know
how
one
would
develop
a
mechanism
that
be
fund
specifically
for
teacher
but
I
have
a
open
mind
on
the
matter
.
there
be
common
ground
here
.
what
have
amaze
I
since
become
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
two
year
ago
be
the
well
-
spring
of
initiative
in
school
and
the
level
of
cohesion
between
teacher
and
pupil
in
they
collaboration
on
such
project
.
we
all
acknowledge
that
and
I
accept
the
point
that
we
should
examine
some
of
this
project
to
determine
whether
we
can
pilot
they
across
the
educational
landscape
.
we
be
often
accuse
in
this
house
of
be
out
of
touch
but
very
often
we
have
we
finger
on
the
pulse
in
term
of
what
be
happen
in
we
own
community
.
I
have
notice
a
enormous
amount
of
enthusiasm
from
pupil
about
try
to
ensure
the
emotional
and
mental
well
being
of
they
fellow
pupil
.
I
have
not
see
anything
like
the
level
of
positivity
that
I
have
see
in
the
last
two
year
,
in
term
of
the
willingness
of
pupil
to
engage
with
and
try
to
help
they
fellow
student
.
that
be
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
on
overall
well
being
within
school
.
the
evidence
for
that
may
be
anecdotal
but
we
be
see
a
improvement
in
this
regard
.
I
take
the
point
make
about
the
stress
and
strain
that
teacher
be
under
.
I
also
understand
they
in
loco
parentis
role
in
school
but
school
be
community
make
up
of
student
,
teacher
and
parent
,
all
work
together
.
the
question
be
ask
as
to
whether
we
can
specifically
fund
service
for
teacher
who
be
in
distress
or
under
stress
without
also
do
so
for
the
wide
populace
but
I
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
.
as
to
whether
we
can
get
specific
scheme
or
pilot
project
under
way
,
I
do
not
see
why
not
.
wear
my
research
hat
,
I
can
say
that
it
can
be
very
easy
to
do
so
.
good
idea
,
like
the
CoderDojo
initiative
,
for
example
,
be
very
easily
replicate
across
the
landscape
.
if
specific
initiative
be
be
carry
out
in
school
in
certain
area
at
present
,
I
do
not
see
why
they
cannot
be
replicate
across
the
country
.
there
would
be
no
additional
cost
because
it
be
simply
about
learn
from
other
school
and
replicate
that
across
the
system
.
I
be
always
happy
to
engage
on
this
agenda
.
the
Department
currently
spend
some
€
1.3
billion
or
15
%
of
its
budget
in
support
of
child
with
special

,

on

and

therefore
,
not

there
be
540

.
this

with
a
ratio
of
one

and
a

other

,

and

the

the
most

or
who

.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
issue
,
which
be
specific
to
he
area
.
department
official
and
I
would
be
very
interested
to
hear
how
the
process
with
the
vec
could
take
shape
,
with
a
view
to
engage
further
in
the
process
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
very
specific
geographical
location
,
my
own
view
-
without
be
in
full
possession
of
the
fact
of
the
case
make
by
the
deputy
-
be
that
the
issue
should
be
consider
seriously
.
I
hope
that
be
a
acceptable
response
,
although
it
may
not
fully
answer
the
question
with
figure
.
if
there
be
a
specific
project
in
which
the
deputy
or
other
member
be
involve
,
and
where
the
Department
should
be
more
active
,
I
be
quite
happy
to
engage
further
with
the
deputy
on
the
issue
.
if
the
deputy
could
make
a
request
to
the
senior
minister
,
I
will
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
issue
be
raise
in
the
House
,
along
with
the
matter
raise
by
deputy
Keating
.
I
acknowledge
each
of
the
contribution
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
there
be
540
autism
-
specific
class
approve
throughout
the
country
.
there
be
specific
pocket
where
there
be
shortage
or
where
issue
may
need
to
be
address
.
they
can
be
raise
through
this
forum
and
on
the
floor
of
the
House
but
also
by
way
of
direct
representation
to
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Quinn
,
or
parliamentary
question
.
with
respect
to
deputy
Wallace
,
I
would
not
be
expect
to
be
completely
au
None
with
the
school
to
which
he
refer
.
perhaps
he
would
table
a
parliamentary
question
to
address
the
specific
issue
about
the
service
rather
than
I
give
a
stock
answer
.
there
be
a
maximum
of
six
child
in
each
special
class
with
a
teacher
and
at
least
two
special
need
assistant
.
extra
assistance
be
provide
where
the
child
require
it
,
and
sometimes
on
a
one
-
to
-
one
basis
.
funding
for
home
tuition
be
also
available
at
ten
hour
per
week
for
child
with
autism
up
to
three
year
,
increase
to
20
hour
per
week
once
the
child
be
three
year
old
if
a
placement
be
not
available
in
a
early
intervention
class
.
I
do
not
know
if
that
speak
directly
to
deputy
O'Brien
's
issue
but
we
can
engage
further
on
it
.
I
propose
to
take
question
Nosemcue
9
and
12
together
.
the
survey
of
parental
preference
be
undertake
largely
in
town
and
suburb
.
it
be
also
open
to
parent
of
preschool
or
primary
school
child
in
rural
area
or
rural
school
to
participate
in
the
survey
.
the
purpose
of
the
survey
be
to
establish
if
parent
want
a
more
diverse
range
of
primary
school
patron
in
they
area
.
follow
on
from
the
recent
publication
of
the
result
of
the
survey
of
primary
school
patronage
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
write
to
the
Roman
Catholic
patron
in
the
23
area
where
parental
demand
for

have
be

in
the
most

he
have
request
they
consider
option
for
reconfigure
school
under
they

to
allow
the
transfer
of
a
school
to
a
new

.
the
Roman
Catholic
patron
have
be
ask
to
submit
a
interim
response
within
three
month
and
a
final
response
with
detailed
proposal
on

within
six
month
.
early

have
be
conduct
in
five

and
,
as
a
result
,

be
also
be
consider
in
respect
of
this
.
the
survey
be
conduct
in
43
area
across
the
country
.
we
have
take
the
response
to
that
survey
and
be
act
accordingly
.
there
be
a
process
under
way
with
the
exist
patron
to
consider
the
option
.
there
be
a
timeframe
for
response
.
the
small
school
issue
have
not
be
decide
yet
so
the
link
with
this
issue
be
incongruous
.
the
accusation
of
hypocrisy
,
therefore
,
do
not
stand
.
this
go
back
to
the
set
piece
where
question
be
put
to
the
minister
and
the
deputy
be
entitle
to
make
whatever
political
charge
he
want
.
that
be
part
and

of
the
game
of

I
do
not

the
link
between
the
two

to
be

survey
be
conduct
in
43

and
we
should
wait
and
see
what
the
result
be
and
what
response
the
exist

will
make
.
none
of
we
be
averse
to
a
bit
of
political
banter
from
time
to
time
but
the
purpose
of
this
set

piece
be
to
get
to
the
nub
of
the
question
.
follow
the

the

of

,
there
be
sufficient

for
a

in

of

to
support

however
,
this

where

as

at
this
juncture
I
will
refer
to
some
recent
misinform
commentary
in
various

on

prioritisation
and
the
extension
of

into

,
for
instance
,
that
such
action
signal
a
so

call

for

in

and
that
the

be
no

commit
to

,
technology
and

.
this
commentary
do
not
reflect
what
be
actually
happen
.
on
25
February
2013
,
we
have
the
large
ever
research
announcement
of
its
kind
in
this
country
,
involve
seven
large
-
scale
research
centre
,
support
800
researcher
,
and
represent
a
total
investment
of
€300
million
over
the
next
six
year
,
€200
million
of
which
will
be
provide
by
the
Exchequer
via
SFI
and
a
further
€
100
million
come
from
more
than
150
industry
partner
.
at
the
end
of
January
,
we
also
have
€
60.8
million
of
new
SFI
investigator
award
across
a
range
of
fundamental
research
area
,
primarily
the
life
science
,
ICT
,
mathematics
and
energy
.
in
November
2012
,
SFI
also
announce
€
30
million
in
key
research
infrastructure
award
.
all
three
of
this
significant
research
announcement
by
government
,
through
SFI
,
be
underpin
by
talented
basic
research
scientist
.
all
of
the
above
be
of
direct
relevance
to
support
basic
research
excellence
in
this
country
that
be
directly
relevant
to
we
economic
and
societal
development
.
one
can
add
to
that
example
the
fact
that
SFI
's
budget
for
2013
be
maintain
at
very
close
to
2012
level
,
as
be
the
basic
research
funding
allocation
of
approximately
€
35
million
be
provide
to
the
Irish
Research
Council
this
year
.
to
return
to
section
4
,
this
section
also
include
a
new
function
to
enable
SFI
to
promote
and
support
awareness
and
understanding
of
stem
.
that
be
originally
a
function
of
the
discover
science
and
engineering
,
dse
,
programme
initiate
by
Forfás
in
2003
,
the
objective
be
to
heighten
stem
awareness
so
as
to
increase
the
number
of
student
study
the
physical
science
and
mathematics
;
promote
a
positive
attitude
to
stem
career
;
and
foster
a
great
public
understanding
of
the
physical
science
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
and
they
value
to
society
.
in
March
2012
,
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Bruton
,
transfer
responsibility
for
delivery
of
the
dse
programme
from
Forfás
to
SFI
on
a
administrative
basis
.
the
Bill
now
put
SFI
's
science
awareness
activity
on
a
proper
legislative
footing
.
where
appropriate
,
SFI
will
consult
the
minister
for
Education
and
Skill
on
STEM
related
issue
.
the
House
will
be
aware
that
I
be
minister
of
State
in
both
of
that
Department
.
move
on
to
section
5
,
under
the
Industrial
Development
Act
2003
as
it
stand
,
SFI
at
present
do
not
have
the
power
to
directly
fund
research
group
outside
the
Republic
of
Ireland
.
section
5
will
grant
additional
power
for
SFI
to
provide
funding
to
researcher
and
institution
base
in
Northern
Ireland
,
thereby
advance
opportunity
for
collaboration
between
research
group
North
and
South
.
this
section
will
also
allow
SFI
,
subject
to
the
minister
's
consent
,
to
enter
cost
-
share
collaborative
research
arrangement
with
international
partner
in
area
where
Irish
researcher
have
real
potential
to
achieve
add
value
from
such
arrangement
.
International
collaboration
on
research
bring
together
resource
,
pool
knowledge
,
enhance
scientific
excellence
,
and
thereby
achieve
great
success
in
address
research
problem
and
deliver
great
efficiency
.
it
open
up
access
to
external
non-Exchequer
funding
,
facility
and
networking
opportunity
for
Irish
researcher
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available
.
when
opportunity
arise
,
it
be
important
for
Ireland
,
through
SFI
and
other
national
funder
,
to
be
ready
and
available
to
participate
in
international
programme
in
area
where
Ireland
have
research
strength
.
the
European
Commission
's
proposal
for
research
and
innovation
funding
for
the
period
2014
to
2020
,
Horizon
2020
,
include
allocation
of
co-funding
for
member
state
collaboration
,
subject
to
"
clear
financial
commitment
of
the
participate
country
,
include
prior
commitment
to
pool
national
and
-
or
regional
investment
for
transnational
research
and
innovation
"
.
therefore
,
as
part
of
Ireland
's
effort
to
maximise
we
drawdown
from
EU
research
funding
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
be
in
the
right
position
to
engage
in
EU
common
-
pot
arrangement
,
where
appropriate
.
I
will
turn
briefly
to
some
of
the
other
matter
deal
with
in
the

,
in

,

.
section

repeal
the

by
so
do
,
the
Bill
will
facilitate
the
reorganisation
of

function
in
the
Shannon
free

.
in
2011
,
in
recognition
of
the
severe
financial
difficulty
that
Shannon
Development
face
follow
the
collapse
of
the
property
market
,
the
government
agree
to
review
the
future
role
of
that
agency
.
deputy
will
be
aware
that
Shannon
Development
engage
in
property
transaction
and
,
unfortunately
,
the
crash
have
severely
impact
upon
the
company
's
ability
to
raise
revenue
in
this
way
.
follow
careful
consideration
of
this
matter
,
the
government
agree
in
principle
in
May
2012
to
separate
Shannon
Airport
from
the
Dublin
Airport
Authority
and
to
merge
Shannon
Airport
and
Shannon
Development
into
a
new
aviation

focus
entity
which
would
lead
to
the
optimisation
of
enterprise
development
arrangement
in
the
region
.
the
government
decision
also
provide
for
the
transfer
of
Shannon

's
function
relate
to
indigenous
enterprise
and
foreign

,
to

,
respectively

one
think
of

I
do

this
be

it

deal

the
immensely
difficult
set

face
approximately

in

over

that
who

after

they

it

it

not
the
case
that
the
Irish
interest

have
be
target
in
some
way
,
but
immigration
be
a
controversial
issue
in

,
and
300
amendment
to

have
be
tab
.
I
meet
people
on
Capitol
Hill
when
I
be
there
over
the
St.

's

who
tell
I
it
be
not
a
question
of
what
happen
on
Capitol

,
in

Senate

in

what
happen
on
chat
show
and
radio
talk
show
when
it
become
a
wide
political
issue
.
the
deputy
ask
what
could
be
do
to
help
.
we
be
very
much
on

of
the
matter
.
I
be
in
regular
contact
with
key
people
promote
the
legislation

the
Taoiseach

I
speak

leader
in

the

in

be
also
very

on

I
know
member
of
this
house
on
all
side
have
contact
of
one
kind
or
another
with
different
political
party
in
the
Unite
State
,
and
now
be
the
time
to
use
that
in
a
positive
way
.
we
should
use
that
link
to
promote
what
we
want
to
achieve
.
in
do
so
,
we
must
be
sensitive
to
the
political
reality
that
immigration
in
the
Unite
State
be
a
sensitive
political
issue
,
as
it
be
here
or
anywhere
else
in
Europe
.
we
must
be
aware
of
that
sensitivity
in
promote
we
case
because
this
be
the
first
big
break
in
the
issue
.
we
have
always
state
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
be
the
way
to
resolve
the
problem
of
the
undocumented
Irish
and
there
be
now
a
Bill
that
I
be
anxious
to
see
pass
.
this
involve
real
politics

member
of

be
subject

of

it

of
one
kind
or
another
with
different
political
party
in
the
Unite
State
,
and
now
be
the
time
to
use
that
in
a
positive
way
.
we
should
use
that
link
to
promote
what
we
want
to
achieve
.
in
do
so
,
we
must
be
sensitive
to
the
political
reality
that
immigration
in
the
Unite
State
be
a
sensitive
political
issue
,
as
it
be
here
or
anywhere
else
in
Europe
.
we
must
be
aware
of
that
sensitivity
in
promote
we
case
because
this
be
the
first
big
break
in
the
issue
.
we
have
always
state
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
be
the
way
to
resolve
the
problem
of
the
undocumented
Irish
and
there
be
now
a
Bill
that
I
be
anxious
to
see
pass
.
this
involve
real
politics
and
member
of
the
House
of
Representative
and
the
Senate
be
subject
to
lobbying
of
various
kind
as
well
as
public
comment
.
we
be
lobby
we
case
and
we
should
use
any
contact
we
have
to
further
it
.
all
the
work
which
the
government
be
do
through
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
aim
to
transform
we
economy
from
one
that
become
over
dependent
on
property
,
construction
and
debt
to
one
focus
on
enterprise
,
innovation
and
export
.
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
be
focus
on
sustain
and
create
employment
for
new
entrant
to
the
labour
market
and
the
unemployed
,
many
of
whom
be
under
25
.
there
be
strong
evidence
that
the
plan
be
work
.
the
IDA
have
have
the
good
two
year
in
a
decade
for
job
growth
while
Enterprise
Ireland
company
be
win
new
market
and
grow
employment
significantly
.
over
the
past
15
month
,
the
private
sector
have
add
1000
job
per
month
.
while
it
be
true
that
there
be
continue
job
loss
in
more
traditional
sector
that
grow
disproportionately
during
the
credit
bubble
,
such
as
construction
,
financial
,
insurance
and
administrative
activity
,
we
have
see
a
increase
in
employment
in
sector
target
by
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
,
include
ICT
,
digital
gaming
,
tourism
and
the
agrifood
sector
.
many
of
the
job
on
offer
in
this
sector
be
particularly
attractive
to
young
people
.
in
addition
,
the
government
have
a
range
of
initiative
to
support
young
people
to
prepare
for
employment
through
job
experience
and
training
.
this
include

the
Department
of

Protection

additional
information
not
give
on
the
floor
of
the
House
my
Department
be
also
keen
to
support
young
entrepreneur
and
,
in
this
context
,
initiative
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
's
competitive
start
fund
and
new
frontier
programme
,
along
with
the
microenterprise
loan
fund
,
will
all
contribute
to
support
young
entrepreneur
.
last
week
,
we
commence
a
consultation
on
how
we
can
well
promote
entrepreneurship
in
Ireland
and
we
will
be
look
in
particular
at
the
scope
to
increase
youth
entrepreneurship
.
the
government
recognise
that
there
have
be
a
increase
in
net
emigration
,
particularly
among
young
people
,
since
the
start
of
the
recession
.
in
the
year
to
April
2012
net
migration
reach
34000
,
of
whom
26000
be
Irish
national
.
this
reflect
the
impact
of
the
crash
which
over
a
three
-
year
period
see
the
loss
of
over
250000
job
in
the
private
sector
.
the
concerted
drive
to
make
employment
a
top
priority
across
the
whole
of
government
be
help
to
alter
that
outlook
for
employment
.
employment
in
the
private
sector
be
now
grow
by
1000
per
month
.
the
government
's
aim
be
that
,
by
continue
the
process
of
transform
we
economy
step
by
step
through
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
,
we
can
provide
opportunity
for
employment
in
Ireland
.
I
will
provide
some
figure
and
interrogate
they
correctly
.
I
acknowledge
the
report
to
which
deputy
Tóibín
refer
.
of
the
87000
people
who
have
emigrate
from
Ireland
in
the
year
up
to
April
2012
,
less
than
half
of
they
,
40600
people
,
be
not
Irish
.
many
of
they
be
non-Irish
people
who
come
to
Ireland
over
the
previous
decade
or
so
for
work
and
be
now
return
home
.
the
CSO
figure
show
53000
people
come
to
Ireland
last
year
and
20600
be
Irish
national
return
home
.
extrapolate
from
the
figure
,
the
year
from
1992
to
2012
show
a
certain
number
of
Irish
people
choose
to
emigrate
for
career
or
personal
reason
.
I
beg
indulgence
of
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
we
must
distinguish
between
the
gross
figure
and
the
net
figure
and
extrapolate
the
number
of
people
who
be
not
Irish
and
who
be
return
to
they
home
country
to
provide
a
more
realistic
view
.
with
regard
to
youth
unemployment
,
of
the
68000
people
within
the
age
category
to
which
deputy
Tóibín
refer
up
to
2012
,
the
15
to
19
year
old
category
contain
18500
people
who
be
unemployed
,
with
49500
in
the
21
to
24
year
old
category
.
the
idea
of
this
scheme
and
the
good
way
to
ensure
people
do
not
emigrate
be
to
ensure
there
be
a
place
for
people
to
reskill
,
retrain
or
remain
within
formal
education
.
that
give
they
the
good
chance
of
a
opportunity
.
there
be
a
myriad
of
scheme
,
training
programme
and
educational
place
do
that
at
present
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
we
want
as
many
young
people
to
be
give
the
opportunity
and
we
must
create
a
supply
of
course
and
upskilling
.
let
we
take
the
figure
of
18500
in
the
15
to
19
year
old
category
.
why
be
18500
young
people
between
the
age
of
15
and
19
unemployed
?
there
be
no
reason
they
cannot
fit
into
a
course
,
a
placement
,
a
internship
or
continue
education
to
ensure
we
can
extrapolate
from
the
figure
of
18500
,
which
would
cause
a
serious
dent
in
the
youth
unemployment
figure
.
the
same
apply
to
the
category
of
that
aged
20
to
24
.
when
figure
be
quote
,
the
language
be
use
refer
to
Irish
people
emigrate
.
it
be
important
to
interrogate
the
figure
and
extrapolate
from
they
because
there
be
a
natural
rate
of
people
who
be
welcome
to
this
country
,
who
work
in
this
country
and
will
return
to
they
native
land
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
it
.
the
demand
side
issue
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
be
tackle
.
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
include
a
number
of
regulatory
measure
to
encourage
business
.
it
be
acknowledge
that
demand
have
bottome
out
but
the
government
be
try
to
put
in
place
a
set
of
measure
to
address
the
250000
job
lose
between
2008
and
2011
.
this
job
be
ally
,
for
the
most
part
,
to
the
construction
sector
so
we
must
invest
in
new
area
of
opportunity
in
the
sector
.
that
young
people
,
who
be
work
in
mine
in
Australia
as
we
speak
because
they
have
construction
-
related
degree
,
will
come
back
and
have
other
area
of
opportunity
.
the
government
be
not
rest
on
its
laurel
.
with
regard
to
the
youth
guarantee
,
it
be
my
understanding
-
and
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
can
clarify
it
further
-
that
this
be
still
part
of
the
negotiation
under
the
Irish
Presidency
of
the
Council
of
the
European
Union
.
I
thank
my
colleague
in
the
technical
Group
for
support
the
motion
and
other
member
for
they
contribution
,
although
many
of
the
contribution
be
standard
and
disappointing
in
the
context
of
the
debate
in
the
State
about
the
future
of
Europe
.
the
motion
only
call
for
two
simple
action
-
to
initiate
a
debate
through
civil
society
on
the
future
direction
of
the
EU
and
to
ensure
treaty
change
include
a
process
to
allow
member
to
voluntary
leave
the
eurozone
and
not
the
Union
.
what
be
miss
from
the
government
contribution
be
a
discussion
about
the
future
of
the
Union
.
that
be
a
sign
of
the
problem
in
the
State
and
the
government
.
there
be
no
discussion
about
the
future
.
I
remind
member
that
Barroso
,
Hollande
and
Merkel
be
all
talk
about
the
future
and
they
have
a
map
and
a
plan
of
where
the
future
will
lie
.
Barroso
have
say
in
the
past
that
Europe
have
all
the
hallmark
of
a
empire
.
on
7
May
,
he
state
:
"
the
proposal
he
will
bring
forward
on
treaty
change
will
look
like
political
science
fiction
but
they
will
be
a
reality
in
a
few
year
time
"
.
he
be
look
to
the
future
and
he
know
what
future
he
want
for
Europe
.
Hollande
want
a
EU
government
with
harmonise
tax
and
budget
to
tackle
the
crisis
.
Merkel
want
more
Europe
and
want
to
work
towards
the
creation
of
a
European
army
.
they
know
the
future
they
want
and
be
it
because
the
government
party
know
what
it
be
that
they
do
not
want
to
have
this
debate
and
do
not
want
the
people
to
know
where
the
future
lie
.
the
future
be
a
unite
state
of
Europe
or
a
federal
Europe
with
a
army
and
a
centralised
government
in
which
a
nation
such
as
Ireland
will
have
no
say
and
will
only
be
a
small
part
of
it
.
the
amendment
tab
by
Fianna
Fáil
and
Sinn
Féin
be
interesting
.
the
party
have
peg
they
political
future
and
the
future
of
this
country
to
stabilise
the
euro
and
get
through
this
crisis
with
the
euro
intact
.
the
trade
off
for
that
will
be
the
political
science
fiction
to
which
Barroso
refer
come
to
fruition
.
the
political
party
will
peg
themselves
to
stabilise
the
euro
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
sleepwalk
the
country
into
the
unite
state
of
Europe
.
the
Taoiseach
state
in
the
House
last
June
that
this
would
never
happen
and
he
would
never
let
it
happen
on
he
watch
.
however
,
it
will
happen
over
the
next
few
year
and
we
will
wake
up
some
morning
and
realise
we
be
in
a
unite
state
of
Europe
with
everyone
wonder
how
we
get
there
.
we
will
have
arrive
at
that
point
because
we
peg
ourselves
solely
to
the
preservation
of
the
euro
.
the
only
policy
the
government
be
pursue
be
to
maintain
the
euro
and
the
trade
off
for
that
will
be
the
creation
of
the
European
super
state
that
the
elite
in
Europe
want
to
make
a
reality
.
that
be
the
sad
reflection
of
this
government
's
policy
on
the
eurozone
and
the
euro
currency
.
we
should
ensure
a
treaty
change
to
allow
a
member
state
to
voluntarily
leave
the
euro
and
leave
policy
option
open
.
Fianna
Fáil
say
the
euro
be
irrevocably
and
irreplaceably
here
to
stay
.
the
European
Central
Bank
say
the
same
and
that
it
be
never
intend
that
any
member
state
would
leave
the
economic
and
monetary
union
but
this
motion
call
for
that
option
.
it
be
a
policy
option
which
a
government
can
pursue
but
every
party
in
this
House
have
tie
itself
to
the
euro
and
the
further
integration
to
complete
fiscal
union
and
to
the
political
union
which
go
with
it
.
deputy
Mitchell
accuse
I
of
sedition
for
tab
this
motion
.
I
be
afraid
we
need
to
see
more
sedition
in
this
House
.
we
see
the
sedition
of
the
Labour
Party
before
the
election
when
it
promise
all
sort
of
thing
in
term
of
what
it
would
do
in
Europe
.
however
,
when
it
get
under
the
ring
of
Fine
Gael
,
which
be
the
Irish
version
of
the
Tory
Party
and
not
anybody
on
the
independent
bench
,
its
sedition
be
slowly
put
to
a
end
.
we
need
more
sedition
and
more
debate
about
what
the
future
hold
so
that
we
can
make
we
decision
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
and
not
blindly
follow
what
we
be
tell
to
do
.

wonder
how
we
get
there
.
we
will
have
arrive
at
that
point
because
we
peg
ourselves
solely
to
the
preservation
of
the
euro
.
the
only
policy
the
government
be
pursue
be
to
maintain
the
euro
and
the
trade
off
for
that
will
be
the
creation
of
the
European
super
state
that
the
elite
in
Europe
want
to
make
a
reality
.
that
be
the
sad
reflection
of
this
government
's
policy
on
the
eurozone
and
the
euro
currency
.
we
should
ensure
a
treaty
change
to
allow
a
member
state
to
voluntarily
leave
the
euro
and
leave
policy
option
open
.
Fianna
Fáil
say
the
euro
be
irrevocably
and
irreplaceably
here
to
stay
.
the
European
Central
Bank
say
the
same
and
that
it
be
never
intend
that
any
member
state
would
leave
the
economic
and
monetary
union
but
this
motion
call
for
that
option
.
it
be
a
policy
option
which
a
government
can
pursue
but
every
party
in
this
House
have
tie
itself
to
the
euro
and
the
further
integration
to
complete
fiscal
union
and
to
the
political
union
which
go
with
it
.
deputy
Mitchell
accuse
I
of
sedition
for
tab
this
motion
.
I
be
afraid
we
need
to
see
more
sedition
in
this
House
.
we
see
the
sedition
of
the
Labour
Party
before
the
election
when
it
promise
all
sort
of
thing
in
term
of
what
it
would
do
in
Europe
.
however
,
when
it
get
under
the
ring
of
Fine
Gael
,
which
be
the
Irish
version
of
the
Tory
Party
and
not
anybody
on
the
independent
bench
,
its
sedition
be
slowly
put
to
a
end
.
we
need
more
sedition
and
more
debate
about
what
the
future
hold
so
that
we
can
make
we
decision
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
and
not
blindly
follow
what
we
be
tell
to
do
.
I
thank
my
colleague
in
the
technical
Group
for
support
the
motion
and
other
member
for
they
contribution
,
although
many
of
the
contribution
be
standard
and
disappointing
in
the
context
of
the
debate
in
the
State
about
the
future
of
Europe
.
the
motion
only
call
for
two
simple
action
-
to
initiate
a
debate
through
civil
society
on
the
future
direction
of
the
EU
and
to
ensure
treaty
change
include
a
process
to
allow
member
to
voluntary
leave
the
eurozone
and
not
the
Union
.
what
be
miss
from
the
government
contribution
be
a
discussion
about
the
future
of
the
Union
.
that
be
a
sign
of
the
problem
in
the
State
and
the
government
.
there
be
no
discussion
about
the
future
.
I
remind
member
that
Barroso
,
Hollande
and
Merkel
be
all
talk
about
the
future
and
they
have
a
map
and
a
plan
of
where
the
future
will
lie
.
Barroso
have
say
in
the
past
that
Europe
have
all
the
hallmark
of
a
empire
.
on
7
May
,
he
state
:
"
the
proposal
he
will
bring
forward
on
treaty
change
will
look
like
political
science
fiction
but
they
will
be
a
reality
in
a
few
year
time
"
.
he
be
look
to
the
future
and
he
know
what
future
he
want
for
Europe
.
Hollande
want
a
EU
government
with
harmonise
tax
and
budget
to
tackle
the
crisis
.
Merkel
want
more
Europe
and
want
to
work
towards
the
creation
of
a
European
army
.
they
know
the
future
they
want
and
be
it
because
the
government
party
know
what
it
be
that
they
do
not
want
to
have
this
debate
and
do
not
want
the
people
to
know
where
the
future
lie
.
the
future
be
a
unite
state
of
Europe
or
a
federal
Europe
with
a
army
and
a
centralised
government
in
which
a
nation
such
as
Ireland
will
have
no
say
and
will
only
be
a
small
part
of
it
.
the
amendment
tab
by
Fianna
Fáil
and
Sinn
Féin
be
interesting
.
the
party
have
peg
they
political
future
and
the
future
of
this
country
to
stabilise
the
euro
and
get
through
this
crisis
with
the
euro
intact
.
the
trade
off
for
that
will
be
the
political
science
fiction
to
which
Barroso
refer
come
to
fruition
.
the
political
party
will
peg
themselves
to
stabilise
the
euro
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
sleepwalk
the
country
into
the
unite
state
of
Europe
.

it
be
important
to
note
that

do
not
contain

however
,
even
after

,
the
discretionary

available

will
still
be
quite
considerable

there
be
some
concern
within
the
Church
of
Ireland
community
about
the
recent
budget
measure
affect
fee-
charging

.
this
government
recognise
the
importance
of
ensure
that
student
from
a
Protestant
or
reform
church
background
can
attend
a
school
that
reflect
they
denominational
etho
while
at
the
same
time
ensure
that

be
in

with
the
provision
of
the
constitution
.
the
issue
of

for
widely
disperse
and
small
local
community
do
present
a
particular
challenge
,
especially
where
enrolment
be

the

wish
to
foster

in

and
regards
support

include

to
maintain
they
school
as
be
part
of
that
policy

with
regard
to
the

,
a
arrangement
exist
whereby

by
my
Department
to
the
Secondary

,
a

the

would

this

in
conclusion
,
I
wish
to
confirm
that

continue

in

up
to

scrutiny

of

.
I
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
that
the
number
of
error
in
the
examination
be
a
cause
for
concern
.
the
State
Examination
Commission
have
express
its
regret
for
the
error
make
.
in
response
to
deputy
Anthony
Lawlor
,
I
have
a
delegate
function
as
Minister
of
State
and
have
responsibility
for
the
project
math
curriculum
,
for
example
.
as
such
,
one
could
say
the
deputy
be
address
the
line
minister
on
this
issue
.
I
take
the
point
he
be
make
which
be
important
.
as
we
be
in
the
midst
of
the
examination
process
,
it
be
important
to
reassure
pupil
who
go
through
this
issue
yesterday
that
the
error
will
be
take
into
account
in
the
mark
scheme
.
the
State
Examination
Commission
set
the
paper
in
a
independent
process
,
which
be
very
much
at
arm
's
length
from
the
Department
.
issue
arise
yesterday
,
however
,
for
which
there
must
be
a
degree
of
accountability
to
the
parent
department
in
the
resolution
of
such
issue
into
the
future
.
as
the
Deputy
say
,
what
we
must
do
now
be
ensure
we
get
pupil
through
the
rest
of
they
examination
.
we
must
ensure
the
remain
examination
paper
be
robustly
check
to
avoid
error
and
that
there
be
a
reporting
mechanism
and
a
degree
of
accountability
by
the
State
Examination
Commission
to
the
Department
about
what
occur
in
the
paper
refer
to
by
the
Deputy
.
from
a
logistical
point
of
view
,
in
a
typical
year
the
examination
involve
over
116500
candidate
in
over
4900
main
examination
centre
and
10000
special
centre
,
over
250
test
instrument
,
90
curricular
and
15
non-curricular
subject
,
over
6000
examiner
,
3
million
individual
exam
paper
comprise
over
34
million
page
and
just
under
2
million
test
item
.
notwithstanding
that
,
error
still
take
place
.
if
we
acknowledge
the
error
take
place
,
all
we
must
do
be
ensure
there
be
a
degree
of
accountability
.
there
must
be
accountability
for
why
the
error
take
place
and
the
reparation
in
term
of
how
we
ensure
it
do
not
happen
again
.
I
do
not
agree
with
the
analysis
that
we
should
sack
member
of
the
State
Examination
Commission
,
which
have
be
a
independent
agency
since
2003
.
I
strongly
believe
there
should
be
full
accountability
in
a
transparent
way
with
regard
to
what
happen
to
the
paper
.
I
be
confident
we
will
get
the
answer
to
the
question
in
due
course
.
while
the
leave
certificate
and
junior
certificate
be
ongoing
,
we
should
ensure
student
and
parent
be
assure
and
remain
confident
the
State
Examination
Commission
will
take
into
account
the
error
make
.
the
error
will
be
record
and
reflect
in
the
mark
scheme
and
no
one
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
as
a
result
of
the
error
.
from
the
initial
statement
of
the
State
Examination
Commission
,
I
be
confident
that
will
take
place
.
if
we
be
send
a
message
from
the
House
,
the
important
thing
be
that
we
give
the
assurance
that
no
student
can
be
disadvantage
as
a
result
of
a
error
on
the
examination
paper
.
I
doubt
any
student
be
watch
this
proceedings
but
if
they
parent
be
watch
or
if
this
debate
be
report
,
it
be
important
to
give
they
a
sense
of
confidence
that
whatever
error
occur
will
be
reflect
in
the
mark
scheme
in
a
way
that
ensure
student
be
not
put
at
a
disadvantage
.
I
be
confident
that
will
be
the
case
vis-à
-
vis
how
the
State
Examination
Commission
will
handle
this
matter
.
I
have
confidence
in
it
in
that
sense
.
I
take
on
board
what
be
be
say
in
respect
of
a
review
.
we
need
to
get
the
student
over
the
line
for
the
remain
exam
and
give
they
a
sense
that
this
will
be
sort
out
.
there
must
be
a
degree
of
accountability
and
whether
that
involve
a
entire
review
be
not
something
to
go
into
at
this
stage
.
one
must
allow
for
some
margin
of
error
in
anything
one
do
in
life
.
that
be
not
to
justify
anything
that
happen
but
we
must
ensure
that
error
such
as
that
in
question
8
and
in
the
CSPE
exam
,
for
example
,
do
not
happen
again
.
where
fundamental
error
occur
,
check
and
balance
should
be
put
in
place
to
ensure
they
be
weed
out
at
a
early
stage
and
that
there
be
a
proper
filtration
process
.
at
this
juncture
,
I
wish
to
reassure
people
that
the
mark
scheme
will
reflect
the
difficulty
student
experience
in
the
exam
and
the
time
lose
in
term
of
answer
question
.
that
must
be
reflect
in
some
compassionate
way
and
I
be
confident
it
will
be
.
as
it

I
be

I
do

will
merely
respond

the
point

.
Ireland
's
corpus

employment
rights

provide
a
comprehensive
and
strong
set

rights

the

further
significant
reform
in

area
,
include
the
restoration
of
the
minimum

to

.
the
historian
who
will
read
this
transcript
,
perhaps
in

for
the
purpose
of

have
contribute
to
this
evening
's
debate
with
regard
to
they
position
on
the
restoration
of
the
minimum
wage
.
we
have
level
the
playing
field
for
agency
worker
by
bring
they
wage
into
line
with
they
full
-
time
counterpart
.
we
enact
the
Industrial
Relation
(
amendment
)
Act

after
the
high
Court
find

we

the
first
round
of
consultation
with
stakeholder
in
line
with
the
programme
for
government
commitment
in
the
area
of
collective
bargain
.
yesterday
deputy
Nulty
suggest
that
Ireland
's
law
on
collective
bargain
be
not
in
conformity
with
International
Labour
Organization
,
ILO
,
convention
.
it
be
important
to
reiterate
in
the
context
of
the
complaint
make
by
ICTU
and
Impact
that
the
ILO
's
committee
on
freedom
of
association
do
not
find
that
Ireland
be
in
breach
of
its
obligation
under
ILO
convention
in
respect
of
collective
bargain
rights
.
neither
do
the
ILO
find
that
a
resolution
of
the
difficulty
arise
over
the
Ryanair
Supreme
Court
judgment
would
require
the
introduction
of
a
legal
regime
of
mandatory
trade
union
recognition
.
no
such
requirement
be
a
feature
of
the
international
convention
to
which
Ireland
be
a
party
and
which
uphold
the
principle
of
voluntary
negotiation
between
employer
and
worker
's
organisation
.
the
programme
for
government
contain
a
commitment
to
reform
the
current
law
on
employee
's
rights
to
engage
in
collective
bargain
.
we
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
conclude
the
consultation
on
this
commitment
shortly
and
will
report
to
government
in
the
autumn
on
the
outcome
of
this
process
and
on
what
proposal
to
improve
the
voluntary
system
of

relation
might
be

in

.

be
make
by
a
number
of

Court
ruling
which
strike
down
certain
provision
of
the
Industrial
Relation
Act
1946
govern
the
registration
of

agreement
.
deputy
Calleary
in
particular
draw
attention
to
the
implication
of
the
absence
of

the
existence
of
such

this
be
a
significant
judgment
which
have
raise
a
number
of
important
question
,
include
possible
implication
for
the
2012
Act
.
the

Supreme
Court
decision

of
urgency

ask
when
Ireland
will
ratify
the
ILO
convention
on
domestic
worker
.
during
its
Presidency
the
Irish
government
have
work
in
close
co-operation
with
the
European
Commission
to
promote
the
ratification
of
this
important
convention
in
the
EU
.
we
have
steer
through
a
decision
of
the
European
Council
which
authorise
member
state
to
ratify
the
domestic
worker
convention
.
this
decision
be
in
keeping
with
Ireland
's
effort
to
promote
decent
work
for
all
inside
and
outside
the
Union
,
of
which
protect
the
working
condition
of
worker
be
a
key
aspect
,
as
well
as
be
in
line
with
Ireland
's
national
priority
of
ratify
this
convention
.
the
Irish
presidency
will
deliver
the
Council
decision
authorise
member
state
of
the
European
Union
to
ratify
convention
no.
189
on
domestic
worker
.
Ireland
will
be
among
the
early
ratifier
of
this
important
convention
.
the
forward
momentum
under
the
Irish
Presidency
in
respect
of
the
ratification
process
in
the
European
Union
need
to
be
build
upon
and
there
be
a
need
for
the
European
Union
to
provide
leadership
in
the
global
effort
to
promote
decent
work
for
domestic
worker
and
develop
this
sector
.
let
nobody
say
the
government
be
regressive
on
the
rights
of
worker
.
I
will
point
to
a
robust
body
of
EU
legislation
,
with
66
European
Union
directive
in
which
Ireland
be
a
partner
,
on
improvement
in
the
workplace
in
term
of
safety
and
condition
.
there
be
a
august
and
robust
body
of
legislation
on
the
rights
of
worker
.
if
we
be
consider
history
it
be
important
that
we
do
not
try
to
revise
it
in
short
five
-
minute
burst
of
rhetoric
.
perhaps
we
should
structure
a
debate
during
private
Member
's
time
on
the
historical
narrative
and
legacy
of
the
lock
-
out
of
1913
to
also
look
at
the
fact
that
in
this
country
we
now
have
wonderful
opportunity
for
young
people
in
new
area
of
technology
,
nanotechnology
,
immunology
and
medical
device
.
we
probably
have
the
good
research
scientist
and
the
well
-
educate
workforce
in
Europe
.
we
be
be
provide
with
new
opportunity
.
let
this
be
the
legacy
of
1913
.
let
this
be
part
of
the
debate
.
let
we
make
space
for
a
proper
debate
on
this
legacy
,
but
not
in
five
-
minute
segment
.
I
appreciate
that
.
that
must
delight

it

the

need
to

perhaps

Boyd
Barrett
might
like
to
save
they
for
Committee
stage
when
the

will
be
present
.
the
Bill
have
be
bring
forward
to
provide
a
statutory
basis
for
the
multi-annual
medium
-
term
expenditure
framework
.
I
be
pleased
deputy
have
engage
on
the
Bill
and
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
some
of
the
point
raise
on
second
Stage
and
which
we
can
debate
further
on
committee
stage
next
week
.
deputy
Fleming
raise
the
fact
that
non-voted
expenditure
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
expenditure
ceiling
be
legislate
for
in
the
Bill
.
the
position
be
that
non-voted
expenditure
represent
expenditure
which
the
Oireachtas
have
declare
by
law
be
to
be
pay
from
the
Central
Fund
without
annual
reference
to
the
Dáil
.
this
be
item
which
be
a
permanent
charge
on
the
state
revenue
and
represent
that
service
which
be
payable
out
of
the
Central
Fund
by
the
continue
authority
of
statute
and
be
not
,
therefore
,
subject
to
the
same
type
of
annual
process
as
vote
expenditure
.
the
large
item
be
the
service
of
the
national
debt
.
other
item
include
Ireland
's
contribution

the
EU
budget
;
the
salary
,
pension
and
allowance
of
the
President
,
Judiciary
and
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
;
and
the
expense
of
return
officer
.
it
be
not
true
the
Dáil
be
not
make
aware
of
Central
Fund
activity
.
it
be
regularly
report
in
Exchequer
statement
and
the
Department
of

each

as
detail
of
the
national
debt
.
they
must
be
lay
before
Dáil
Éireann
not
late
than
30
September
.
the
Bill
do
not
deal
with
debt
service
or
other
Central
Fund
charge
and
consequently
do
not
propose
any
change
to
this
long
-
standing
practice
,
which
be
in

with
the
constitution
.
the

be
in

be
take
further
action
to
bring
about
,
improvement
in

reporting

generally
.
this
will
enable
Ireland
to
realise
a
number
of
benefit
from
enhance
fiscal
disclosure
,
primarily
in
respect
of
the
understanding
of
and
access
to
fiscal
information
,
which
should
help
to
promote
and
encourage
market
investment
in
government
debt
.
with
this
in
mind
,
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
with
the
Department
of

of

I
thank
deputy
Buttimer
for
raise
this
topical
issue
.
the
HPSC
collect
datum
on
new
hiv
and
AIDS
diagnosis
.
data
for
2012
show
that
the
total
number
of
HIV
infection
report
in
all
year
up
to
2012
have
risen
to
6629
.
while
the
annual
number
of
newly
diagnose
hiv
infection
have
be
decrease
since
2008
,
there
be
a
slight
increase
in
the
overall
number
of
new
hiv
diagnosis
in
2012
,
amount
to
7
%
,
as
the
deputy
state
.
of
the
new
diagnosis
,
there
be
166
among
gay
man
,
the
high
number
ever
record
in
that
risk
group
.
this
be
the
predominant
mode
of
transmission
of
hiv
in
Ireland
.
while
some
aspect
of
the
prevention
agenda
have
prove
successful
in
the
past
and
have
reach
large
proportion
of
the
population
,
the
statistic
continue
to
show
that
increasingly
people
be
either
not
hear
or
be
choose
to
disregard
the
message
,
and
be
engage
in
risky
behaviour
.
we
need
to
deliver
target
prevention
programme
in
order
to
address
this
situation
through
partnership
between
non-governmental
organisation
,
ngo
,
and
the
statutory
service
.
the
ongoing
high
incidence
among
the
MSM
group
,
specifically
among
the
young
msm
,
be
a
particular
cause
for
concern
especially
since
the
MSM
group
have
respond
well
to
awareness
and
prevention
campaign
in
the
past
.
clearly
,
not
only
must
the
message
reach
the
target
audience
,
but
they
must
make
a
impact
when
they
do
.
we
must
do
this
in
a
cost
-
effective
manner
that
deliver
the
big
impact
for
investment
.
the
Gay
Health
Network
,
GHN
,
and
the
HSE
run
a
awareness
campaign
specifically
focus
for
man
who
have
sex
with
man
,
or
MSM
.
this
campaign
,
Man2Man.ie
,
be
promote
over
a
12
-
month
period
,
from
December
2011
to
December
2012
,
and
comprise
four
phase
,
with
key
message
develop
by
a
peer
youth
group
facilitate
by
BeLonG
to
Youth
Service
.
it
be
therefore
very
timely
and
relevant
that
tomorrow
the
HSE
and
the
Gay
Health
Network
will
launch
the
result
of
the
joint
national
hiv
prevention
and
sexual
health
awareness
programme
for
man
who
have
sex
with
man
.
subject
to
resource
,
it
be
hope
to
extend
this
awareness
campaign
.
the
11th
annual
Gay
Health
Forum
programme
target
young
msm
and
aim
to
raise
awareness
,
build
self
-
esteem
and
equip
man
to
be
able
to
make
safe
sex
choice
.
in
the
area
of
responsible
sexual
behaviour
,
the
ongoing
stigma
attach
to
hiv
and
other
sexually
transmit
infection
,
stis
,
be
undoubtedly
one
of
the
underlying
reason
for
the
ongoing
high
incidence
level
of
new
case
of
hiv
and
other
stis
.
on
the
wide
issue
of
sexual
health
,
the
Department
of
Health
have
establish
a
high
level
steering
group
to
oversee
the
draft
of
a
national
sexual
health
strategy
.
it
will
focus
on
improve
sexual
health
and
well
-
being
and
will
address
the
surveillance
,
testing
,
treatment
and
prevention
of
hiv
and
stis
,
crisis
pregnancy
,
and
sexual
health
education
and
promotion
.
moreover
,
the
strategy
will
be
in
line
with
the
framework
for
health
and
well
-
being
,
which
provide
a
policy
framework
that
address
the
wide
determinant
of
health
and
health
inequality
.
to
reiterate
,
I
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
point
make
by
deputy
Buttimer
,
specifically
he
point
that
52
%
of
that
concerned

have
the
benefit

that

the

be
determine
that

he
remain

that

manner
that
will
facilitate
the

to
be
frank
and
honest
with
the
deputy
,
as
I
be
not
the
line
minister
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
answer
he
specific
question
about
legislation
on
minimum
pricing
and
transport
.
I
will
,
however
,
refer
he
question
to
the
relevant
minister
.
the
Portmarnock
and
Howth
area
be
patrol
from
Malahide
and
Howth
Garda
station
.
Malahide
Garda
station
be
in
the
Coolock
Garda
district
,
while
Howth
Garda
station
be
in
the
Raheny
district
.
this
district
in
turn
form
part
of
the
Dublin
metropolitan
region
north
Garda
division
,
the
personnel
strength
of
which
be
733
on
30
April
2013
.
the
personnel
strength
of
Raheny
and
Coolock
district
on
30
April
be
176
and
221
,
respectively
.
the
personnel
strength
of
Malahide
and
Howth
Garda
station
be
36
and
40
,
respectively
,
on
30
April
.
while
Malahide
Garda
station
be
not
open
on
a
24
-
hour
basis
,
this
do
not
in
any
way
diminish
the
policing
service
to
the
area
in
question
because
it
free
up
gardaí
for
operational
policing
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
raise
this
issue
as
it
give
I
a
opportunity
to
clarify
the
position
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
.
while
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
deputy
Joan
Collins
regard
the
presence
of
the
senior
minister
,
it
should
be
note
that
I
be
a
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
the
government
have
maintain
the
€
1.3
billion
of
annual
funding
for
additional
teaching
resource
and
special
need
assistant
,
snas
,
to
support
child
with
special
educational
need
at
a
time
when
there
be
a
requirement
to
make
expenditure
savings
across
a
range
of
area
.
as
the
Tánaiste
outline
to
the
House
this
morning
,
two
out
of
every
five
adult
work
in
we
school
be
solely
dedicate
to
catering
for
the
need
of
child
with
special
educational
need
.
we
have
no
doubt
about
the
value
of
the
service
that
this
staff
provide
and
the
value
child
and
they
parent
derive
from
it
.
however
,
we
be
not
in
a
position
to
dramatically
increase
the
number
of
special
need
assistant
or
any
other
service
for
reason
of
which
everyone
be
aware
.
no
one
can
doubt
the
government
's
commitment
to
special
education
.
we
have
maintain
the
number
of
resource
teacher
and
special
need
assistant
in
the
system
since
come
into
office
,
despite
enormous
budgetary
pressure
in
education
and
every
other
front
-
line
service
.
that
say
,
as
a
public
representative
,
I
be
acutely
aware
of
the
concern
that
have
be
express
by
parent
and
teacher
in
the
media
in
the
last
48
hour
.
we
need
to
be
clear
in
all
debate
,
both
in
this
House
and
elsewhere
,
about
what
this
change
mean
to
ensure
we
avoid
create
any
unnecessary
distress
or
alarm
.
the
provision
for
sna
support
for
the
next
school
year
will
remain
at
exactly
the
same
level
as
the
provision
for
the
current
school
year
.
in
its
announcement
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
point
to
a
increase
in
demand
for
resource
teaching
post
of
the
order
of
slightly
more
than
10
%
.
deputy
will
be
aware
that
child
with
learning
support
and
special
educational
need
be
support
through
learning
support
provision
and
NCSE
-
allocate
resource
teacher
.
in
primary
school
,
learning
support
be
provide
through
the
general
allocation
model
and
similar
direct
provision
be
make
in
post
-
primary
school
.
this
support
have
be
maintain
for
this
year
.
the
year
-
on
-
year
growth
in
the
overall
student
population
be
approximately
1.3
%
.
this
year
,
the
demand
for
additional
resource
teacher
from
the
NCSE
have
grow
by
more
than
10
%
.
while
the
NCSE
be
not
yet
in
a
position
to
provide
a
clear
analysis
of
the
underlying
reason
for
the
very
large
increase
in
demand
this
year
,
it
be
clear
that
some
of
this
increase
demand
arise
from
the
migration
of
student
from
learning
support
provision
to
NCSE
-
allocate
resource
teacher
support
.
this
have
create
a
significant
additional
pressure
on
the
resource
available
to
the
NCSE
.
however
,
it
should
also
have
reduce
,
by
equal
measure
,
the
pressure
on
the
learning
support
resource
already
allocate
to
school
.
school
be
encourage
to
make
maximum
use
of
they
resource
and
learning
support
teaching
allocation
through
appropriate
grouping
and
pair
of
child
,
as
appropriate
,
to
ensure
child
do
not
lose
out
on
teaching
time
.
this
be
a
vital
point
for
parent
to
hear
because
a
increase
in
the
use
of
more
collaborative
,
team
-
base
approach
to
teaching
can
help
ensure
that
no
child
will
face
a
significant
reduction
in
the
amount
of
time
spend
with
he
or
she
resource
teacher
.
I
wish
to
reiterate
two
point
.
the
year
-
on
-
year
growth
in
the
overall
student
population
be
1.3
%
and
the
demand
for
additional
teaching
resource
from
the
NCSE
have
grow
by
10
%
.
if
we
be
to
be
serious
about
this
issue
,
we
must
interpret
that
dynamic
,
which
have
not
yet
be
do
.
the
NCSE
be
not
yet
in
a
position
to
provide
a
clear
analysis
of
the
underlying
reason
for
the
large
increase
in
demand
this
year
.
there
be
no
overall
reduction
in
resource
teacher
number
for
the
come
school
year
.
the
number
of
post
available
to
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
for
allocation
be
5,265
,
which
be
the
same
as
last
year
.
we
must
ensure
we
provide
the
service
.
that
5,265
be
in
addition
to
the
4450
learning
support
teacher
provide
to
all
school
to
support
child
with
less
complex
learning
need
,
give
a
total
of
9950
teacher
for
child
with
special
educational
need
.
we
need
to
hear
from
the
NCSE
as
to
why
there
be
a
increase
in
the
overall
population
of
1.3
%
and
the
correlation
between
that
and
the
massive
increase
in
demand
.
that
need
to
be
interpret
in
some
way
.
we
must
also
ensure
we
get
the
good
possible
use
of
the
€
1.3
billion
spend
annually
to
support
child
with
special
educational
need
.
that
be
why
we
ask
the
NCSE
last
year
to
provide
the
policy
advice
on
how
student
with
special
educational
need
should
be
support
in
future
.
one
of
the
recommendation
make
by
the
NCSE
in
its
policy
advice
be
that
a
new
model
should
be
develop
for
the
allocation
of
additional
teaching
resource
to
mainstream
school
base
on
the
profile
need
of
each
school
.
on
foot
of
this
advice
,
the
minister
ask
the
NCSE
to
proceed
immediately
to
establish
a
working
group
to
develop
a
proposal
for
consideration
of
a
revise
allocation
mechanism
as
set
out
in
the
principal
recommendation
of
the
report
.
the
aim
of
this
new
mechanism
will
be
to
ensure
all
learning
support
and
resource
teacher
post
be
allocate
to
school
in
line
with
the
school
's
educational
profile
and
need
for
such
support
rather
than
use
other
mechanism
such
as
the
number
of
student
in
a
school
or
the
number
of
class
teacher
in
a
school
.
we
be
conscious
there
be
challenge
,
and
in
make
any
change
to
we
support
for
child
with
special
educational
need
,
we
also
need
to
protect
the
gain
we
have
make
.
base
on
the
allocation
of
resource
from
1993
to
now
,
there
have
be
a
massive
increase
in
the
level
of
support
by
the
State
for
this
area
.
I
wish
to
give
assurance
that
consultation
will
be
a
key
aspect
in
the
implementation
of
any
of
the
recommendation
.
I
be
rather
disappointed
because
I
think
there
might
be
some
imaginative
idea
from
the
deputy
opposite
in
respect
of
discuss
the
action
the
government
be
take
to
address
the
decline
of
town
centre
throughout
the
country
.
the
deputy
refer
to
town
within
he
constituency
which
be
probably
similar
in
character
to
that
in
my
constituency
.
I
have
analyse
the
situation
in
the
town
I
familiar
with
.
during
the
boom
year
section
23
investment
prevail
and
in
some
instance
one
could
argue
this
be
put
together
by
the
party
opposite
.
now
,
there
be
a
lack
of
occupancy
in
many
of
the
building
and
there
be
empty
storefront
throughout
the
country
as
a
result
of
that
taxation
policy
and
the
ill
-
inform
government
policy
of
the
past
.
they
have
lead
we
to
the
point
where
many
of
we
town
throughout
the
country
have
be
hollow
out
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
reasonable
and
rational
debate
on
this
issue
we
should
not
start
from
the
premise
that
economic
history
or
the
decline
start
only
two
year
ago
.
we
need
to
go
back
to
2007
and
2008
onwards
in
order
to
figure
out
where
town
be
now
.
I
will
give
the
response
that
I
have
be
give
on
the
rate
issue
.
the
action
programme
propose
rate
harmonisation
to
cater
for
difference
between
annual
rate
on
valuation
of
town
and
county
.
the
approach
of
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
to
rate
harmonisation
seek
to
ensure
that
,
on
the
one
hand
,
harmonisation
do
not
lead
to
significant
net
loss
of
revenue
in
individual
county
with
consequential
implication
for
service
,
and
,
on
the
other
,
increase
in
rate
do
not
impact
negatively
on
business
and
employment
.
in
this
regard
local
authority
have
already
be
ask
by
the
Department
by
way
of
circular
to
exercise
restraint
,
and
,
where
possible
,
reduce
commercial
rate
in
2013
.
in
fairness
to
many
local
authority
,
this
be
what
they
have
do
or
they
have
maintain
rate
at
pre-exist
level
.
there
be
several
issue
.
why
have
town
centre
decline
?
there
significant
property
rights
in
this
country
such
that
it
be
very
difficult
for
a
town
council
or
a
local
authority
to
intervene
where
a
building
be
not
occupy
or
where
it
be
fall
into
decline
.
the
property
rights
of
the
owner
seem
to
take
precedence
over
the
wide
social
responsibility
in
respect
of
the
upkeep
of
the
premise
.
that
be
one
challenge
for
local
authority
in
term
of
attract
new
activity
to
the
main
street
.
there
be
also
the
fact
that
in
any
town
throughout
Ireland
at
the
moment
there
be
a
increase
number
of
courier
van
deliver
goods
that
have
be
purchase
online
.
this
be
have
a
serious
impact
in
term
of
high
street
retail
sale
as
well
.
one
need
only
discuss
the
matter
with
one
's
peer
,
friend
and
family
to
get
a
sense
of
how
much
activity
be
be
drive
online
nowadays
.
the
deputy
make
a
point
about
IDA
visit
.
I
have
no
specific
knowledge
in
respect
of
IDA
visit
in
the
area
he
refer
to
but
I
know
from
my
experience
in
my
region
that
there
have
be
significant
IDA
visit
.
however
,
often
the
decision
be
make
by
the
relevant
person
,
business
or
company
that
they
wish
to
locate
to
large
conurbation
because
of
the
particular
type
of
business
that
be
come
into
Ireland
at
the
moment
,
especially
in
the
information
and
communication
technology
sector
.
in
this
sector
,
young
company
and
young
people
be
look
to
move
to
cluster
around
large
conurbation
because
it
be
deem
to
be
more
attractive
than
locate
to
more
regional
town
such
as
my
town
of
Mallow
.
that
be
a
major
challenge
as
well
.
domestic
demand
have
flat
-
line
.
therefore
,
to
say
that
the
government
be
at
fault
for
the
flat
-
lining
of
domestic
demand
make
no
sense
.
the
government
,
in
fairness
,
be
try
to
create
the
job
and
replenish
the
job
that
be
lose
.
a
total
of
250000
job
be
lose
between
2008
and
2011
.
nobody
can
convince
I
that
if
one
put
all
one
's
egg
in
the
construction
basket
and
if
that
fail
,
then
it
would
not
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
retail
or
the
shape
of
town
and
retail
business
within
town
.
we
must
create
the
job
to
create
domestic
demand
and
we
be
make
a
good
fist
of
it
although
it
be
take
time
.
we
must
be
more
imaginative
in
term
of
how
the
planning
guideline
,
which
be
issue
recently
,
will
impact
.
we
must
ensure
,
as
per
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
January
O'Sullivan
,
that
the
planning
system
play
a
key
role
in
support
competitiveness
in
the
retail
sector
in
order
that
there
be
a
advance
choice
for
the
consumer
while
promote
and
support
the
vitality
and
viability
of
city
and
town
centre
and
contribute
to
a
high
standard
of
urban
design
.
the
objective
of
the
guideline
in
the
manual
be
to
provide
a
clear
framework
for
the
continue
development
of
the
retail
sector
in
a
way
that
provide
certainty
for
retailer
and
community
by
strengthen
national
planning
policy
requirement
for
all
planning
authority
.
the
remainder
of
the
response
will
be
available
to
the
deputy
.
I
will
respond
to
deputy
Troy
's
supplementary
question
.
what
idea
do
deputy
Troy
have
?
I
will
stay
here
for
a
while
.
when
be
that
?
how
long
be
Fianna
Fáil
in
government
?
can
deputy
Troy
not
understand
the
cynicism
on
this
side
of
the
House
when
we
hear
proposal
of
that
nature
?
the
memorandum
of
understanding
,
MOU
,
sign
by
the
troika
introduce
the
property
tax
.
Fianna
Fáil
negotiate
the
agreement
with
the
troika
,
which
be
a
sovereign
agreement
.
I
do
not
know
the
deputy
's
position
on
the
property
tax
but
it
should
be
a
significant
revenue
stream
for
local
authority
and
should
redress
the
balance
in
term
of
the
burden
over
many
decade
that
have
be
place
on
business
in
regard
to
the
annual
rate
of
valuation
.
it
will
be
a
opportunity
,
for
instance
,
for
councillor
of
the
deputy
's
party
to
have
a
clear
policy
document
and
prerogative
on
how
it
would
be
implement
at
municipal
or
local
authority
level
.
I
look
forward
to
see
some
of
that
idea
within
my
own
local
authority
,
Cork
County
Council
.
the
cost
of
parking
be
competitive
in
most
town
around
the
country
because
there
be
good
interaction
between
business
and
local
authority
and
many
business
be
represent
on
local
authority
.
the
issue
be
how
one
regenerate
town
.
I
accept
deputy
Troy
's
point
about
energy
cost
,
rate
and
ability
to
pay
but
the
singular
issue
relate
to
demand
.
it
will
take
some
time
to
reverse
the
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
such
that
we
can
create
the
job
to
ensure
a
sufficient
level
of
retail
demand
.
the
approach
be
demand
lead
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
about
come
forward
with
idea
for
empty
shop
but
because
of
property
rights
the
local
authority
cannot
force
specific
type
of
retail
activity
into
specific
area
.
it
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do
.
I
beg
you
indulgence
,
acting
chairman
.
we
see
the
demise
of
development
contribution
which
be
a
major
source
of
income
for
local
authority
during
the
boom
year
.
Cork
County
Council
spend
wisely
on
build
up
social
infrastructure
but
the
funding
have
practically
disappear
.
I
agree
that
one
can
no
long
rely
on
rate
payer
-
businesspeople
-
to
fund
local
government
.
that
be
why
I
look
forward
to
Fianna
Fáil
member
of
local
authority
support
and
strike
the
new
rate
on
the
property
tax
when
the

come

type
of
activity
to

deputy

refer
.
in
general
term
,
we
understand
the
concern
express
by
the
Deputy
.
there
be
no
intention
whatsoever
to
move
away
from
the
model
of
interaction
with
parent
and
that
kind
of
continual
monitoring
of
the
student
's
work
and
they
interaction
in
the
classroom
and
so
on
with
teacher
.
we
want
to
ensure
we
continue
to
have
standardise
testing
in
area
such
as
English
reading
,
science
and
mathematics
,
so
that
standard
be
in
place
,
and
to
have
a
set
of
guideline
in
place
to
monitor
the
quality
assurance
aspect
of
this
.
we
want
to
ensure
guideline
on
moderation
,
which
will
be
confirm
by
the
principal
.
if
there
be
any
vagary
in
the
system
,
a
mechanism
will
be
put
in
place
to
monitor
they
and
to
ensure
a
datum
profile
be
set
up
,
so
that
the
national
and
the
individual
school
's
profile
will
be
monitor
.
the
result
award
in
every
school
will
be
send
to
the
Department
,
so
that
there
be
a
national
monitoring
system
in
place
.
it
will
also
be
subject
to
national
and
international
assessment
and
a
full
reporting
mechanism
will
be
put
in
place
by
2017
.
the
concern
raise
by
the
Deputy
be
be
work
through
the
system
in
advance
of
the
roll
-
out
of
the
new
junior
cycle
.
the
first
one
will
be
through
English
in
2014
.
there
will
be
much
learning
from
that
experience
in
term
of
how
it
will
pan
out
.
a
significant
amount
of
continue
professional
development
will
be
put
in
place
for
teacher
not
only
on
the
pedagogy
or
the
subject
side
,
but
also
in
term
of
the
modality
of
the
assessment
.
there
be
still
some
way
to
go
on
this
.
I
take
the
point
the
deputy
make
but
I
do
not
agree
with
she
that
teacher
be
professionally
develop
-
out
;
they
be
not
.
as
in
any
profession
,
we
must
ensure
100
%
of
the
profession
take
up
continue
professional
development
when
it
be
offer
,
include
the
various
type
of
continue
professional
development
which
will
become
available
for
this
very
process
.
this
be
a
evolve
process
and
there
be
still
some
way
to
go
on
this
.
we
genuinely
recognise
the
concern
articulate
by
the
deputy
and
we
be
very
conscious
that
we
be
ask
teacher
to
do
a
lot
.
we
have
ask
they
to
do
quite
a
lot
in
term
of
project
mathematics
and
other
subject
area
and
change
the
thinking
in
regard
to
move
away
from
learning
by
rote
to
a
more
collaborative
learning
type
of
system
,
which
be
difficult
to
do
if
one
have
be
teach
a
certain
system
for
quite
a
number
of
year
.
we
be
conscious
of
that
which
be
why
we
want
to
ensure
the
support
be
put
in
place
for
that
teacher
who
,
as
the
deputy
say
,
be
professional
in
they
own
right
.
we
want
to
ensure
it
be
a
smooth
a
transition
as
possible
.
in
the
five
minute
available
I
will
do
my
good
to
address
the
content
of
the
Bill
.
the
Bill
propose
to
extend
the
discrimination
grounds
in
the
equal
Status
Act
,
which
deal
with
provision
of
goods
and
service
,
but
not
in
the
employment
Equality
Act
,
which
cover
employment
,
by
add
five
or
six
new
grounds
for
discrimination
which
have
be
articulate
by
deputy
Stanley
.
the
exist
equality
legislation
prohibit
discrimination
on
nine
grounds
,
but
also
contain
a
range
of
qualification
and
exception
to
ensure
that
we
avoid
unintended
and
extreme
consequence
.
thus
,
discrimination
base
on
age
be
outlaw
,
but
we
ensure
that
child
be
protect
and
special
treatment
can
be
provide
for
old
people
where
that
be
appropriate
.
gender
may
not
be
use
to
discriminate
in
employment
,
except
,
for
example
,
in
employment
provide
intimate
caring
service
.
many
of
the
contribution
from
the
Opposition
bench
last
night
cover
employment
issue
,
to
which
the
Bill
as
publish
do
not
apply
.
we
be
tell
last
night
that
this
be
a
draft
error
that
can
be
easily
fix
.
however
,
it
be
not
the
type
of
draft
error
that
can
easily
be
correct
.
that
be
because
there
be
no
exception
or
qualification
propose
in
the
Bill
in
respect
of
the
propose
five
new
grounds
.
that
be
a
serious
omission
.
as
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Lynch
,
say
last
night
,
equality
legislation
seek
to
eliminate
unfair
or
prejudicial
discrimination
base
on
a
person
's
inherent
characteristic
-
gender
,
race
or
age
,
for
example
-
rather
than
affect
rational
assessment
of
risk
base
on
a
person
's
previous
action
.
the
question
of
wipe
the
record
of
criminal
conviction
,
for
example
,
require
a
nuanced
approach
via
spend
conviction
legislation
.
I
acknowledge
deputy
Dara
Murphy
's
point
in
that
regard
.
in
certain
employment
area
,
as
well
as
in
the
provision
of
certain
goods
and
service
,
a
history
of
conviction
for
serious
criminal
offence
,
such
as
sexual
offence
,
fraud
or
theft
,
can
be
directly
relevant
risk
factor
which
should
be
take
into
account
.
the
second
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
sub
-committee
on
Transport
,
Tourism
and
sport
pursuant
to
standing
order
82a
(

and
(

(

and

(

of
the

order
relative
to
Public
business

in
the
most
recent
innovation
union
scoreboard
it
be
most
encouraging
to
see
Ireland
retain
its
position
among
that
member
state
with
above
average
performance
in
they
research
and
innovation
system
.
this
complement
Ireland
's
recent
rank
of
tenth
in
the
Global
Innovation
Index
2013
which
be
also
a
very
positive
affirmation
of
we
capability
in
this
area
.
in
the
Innovation
Union
Scoreboard
,
Ireland
be
notably
rank
first
for
economic
effect
I
will
be
able
to
answer
the
second
half
of
the
question
,
relate
to
copyright
review
,
in
the
second
tranche
of
the
time
allocate
.
the
straight
answer
to
that
question
be
"
yes
"
.
I
will
read
into
the
record
the
issue
in
regard
to
the
independent
copyright
review
committee
.
this
committee
be
establish
in
May
2011
and
its
aim
be
to
examine
the
Irish
copyright
framework
in
order
to
identify
area
that
might
be
consider
to
create
barrier
to
innovation
and
to
make
recommendation
to
resolve
any
problem
identify
,
whether
at
national
or
EU
level
.
I
expect
this
committee
will
present
its
final
report
during
this
month
.
I
agree
that
we
in
this
country
must
ensure
we
strike
a
balance
to
ensure
that
,
where
new
business
model
be
come
forward
in
this
digital
age
-
deputy
Catherine
Murphy
refer
to
the
digitalised
society
-
we
create
a
legislative
package
that
be
in
line
with
the
time
we
live
in
.
I
agree
the
legislation
be
possibly
outdated
in
that
sense
.
the
copyright
review
be
a
independent
process
and
be
be
do
on
a
pro
bono
basis
.
I
apologise
but
I
want
to
answer
the
question
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
if
the
recommendation
of
that
independent
review
group
state
that
change
to
legislation
be
need
,
we
will
have
to
look
seriously
at
what
that
recommendation
be
in
the
first
instance
.
I
have
not
see
the
report
,
although
we
be
expect
it
this
month
.
it
could
be
that
Ireland
want
to
place
itself
ahead
of
the
EU
curve
.
it
must
be
remember
that
we
be
at
present
hinder
in
some
respects
by
the
EU
's
legislative
framework
on
copyright
.
I
would
like
to
come
back
in
if
I
can
.
I
have
not
see
the
report
because
it
be
a
independent
body
and
we
have
absolutely
respect
the
fact
it
be
independent
.
the
term
of
reference
set
out
by
the
government
be
to
examine
current
national
copyright
legislation
and
identify
any
area
that
be
perceive
to
create
barrier
to
innovation
,
and
to
identify
solution
for
remove
this
barrier
and
make
recommendation
as
to
how
this
solution
might
be
implement
through
change
to
national
legislation
.
there
might
be
a
challenge
where
there
be
both
EU
legislation
and
national
legislation
,
and
where
a
national
legislature
like
we
own
might
want
to
move
ahead
of
the
EU
position
.
on
the
other
hand
,
it
might
transpire
that
national
copyright
legislation
require
to
be
amend
but
cannot
be
amend
,
bear
in
mind
that
Irish
copyright
legislation
be
bind
by
the
EU
's
directive
on
copyright
and
related
rights
and
other
international
obligation
.
the
term
of
reference
also
include
make
recommendation
for
change
to
EU
directive
that
will
eliminate
the
barrier
to
innovation
and
optimise
the
balance
between
protect
creativity
and
promote
and
facilitate
innovation
.
everybody
recognise
the
right
to
protection
of
copyright
but
there
be
so
many
new
business
model
that
have
evolve
in
a
online
setting
in
this
digital
age
we
live
in
.
give
the
fact
we
own
situation
be
such
that
we
have
so
many
"
bear
on
the
Internet
"
company
present
here
in
Ireland
and
employ
thousand
of
people
,
the
legislation
have
to
be
frame
in
a
way
that
be
reflective
of
the
time
we
live
in
.
I
move
amendment
no.

I
sincerely
thank

they
constructive
and
positive
approach
to
the
consideration
of
this
Bill
.
the
primary
change
extend
SFI
's
remit
through
this
legislation
be
as
follow
.
as
well
as
continue
to
support
orient
basic
research
in
accordance
with
its
current
remit
,
SFI
will
now
be
able
to
fund
apply
research
through
funding
support
via
the
high
education
institution
.
essentially
,
this
will
allow
SFI
to
bring
research
outcome
close
to
the
market
through
increase
commercialisation
,
the
development
of
new
product
and
the
generation
of
new
service
and
technology
.
ultimately
,
this
will
lead
to
the
creation
of
new
sustainable
quality
job
for
the
country
.
the
legislation
will
also
enable
the
realignment
of
the
strategic
focus
of
SFI
to
cover
the
strategic
area
identify
in
the
research
prioritisation
steering
group
and
approve
by
the
government
in
March
last
year
.
significantly
,
the
legislation
will
for
the
first
time
also
enable
SFI
to
provide
funding
on
a
all
-
island
basis
,
enable
it
to
fund
researcher
and
institution
base
in
Northern
Ireland
link
with
institution
or
company
in
the
State
,
subject
to
excellence
and
strategic
criterion
be
meet
.
it
will
also
allow
SFI
to
enter
,
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
collaborative
arrangement
with
international
partner
and
help
Ireland
leverage
significant
non-Exchequer
research
funding
into
the
country
.
in
do
so
,
it
will
also
enable
Ireland
to
support
the
wide
EU
research
agenda
through
programme
be
support
under
the
European
Union
's
Horizon
2020
programme
which
will
have
a
budget
of
more
than
€
70
billion
in
the
period
2014
to
2020
.
I
be
particularly
proud
that
the
Irish
Presidency
chair
this
negotiation
and
,
personally
,
proud
of
the
work
all
of
we
agency
and
Department
have
do
in
reach
a
successful
political
conclusion
of
the
negotiation
.
as
former
chairman
of
this
negotiation
,
I
be
proud
that
we
will
potentially
have
a
funding
stream
of
approximately
€
1
billion
which
will
surpass
the
target
set
in
the
current
framework
programme
.
the
Bill
also
provide
a
legislative
basis
for
SFI
to
stimulate
the
study
and
awareness
of
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
stem
,
subject
.
in
addition
,
there
be
a
number
of
ancillary
provision
in
the
Bill
that
be
not
specific
to
SFI
but
which
relate
to
enterprise
development
function
in
the
Shannon
free
zone
,
amendment
of
the
freedom
of
information
,
foi
,
act
specific
to
the
enterprise
agency
,
and
strengthen
Forfás
's
function
to
provide
research
datum
so
as
to
fall
in
line
with
international
good
practice
.
the
Bill
be
extremely
important
for
Irish
research
.
it
afford
we
a
ideal
opportunity
to
build
on
a
decade
or
more
of
sustained
and
necessary
government
investment
in
research
and
development
.
in
a
Irish
context
,
as
a
small
open
economy
that
be
very
much
affect
by
outside
development
in
Europe
and
the
wide
world
,
it
be
not
tenable
to
avoid
substantial
research
and
development
investment
in
the
hope
of
take
advantage
of
and
benefit
from
research
discovery
elsewhere
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
research
outcome
generate
economic
gain
and
research
perform
country
be
careful
to
protect
they
research
and
development
investment
.
in
such
a
context
,
Ireland
must
be
equally
forward
think
in
its
approach
to
create
improve
research
and
development
outcome
.
the
Bill
fit
the
bill
in
that
regard
.
I
be
particularly
encourage
by
the
all
-
island
and
international
partnership
aspect
of
the
Bill
.
such
collaboration
present
the
potential
for
gain
great
add
value
from
we
research
investment
in
leverage
investment
into
the
country
and
will
simultaneously
bolster
we
capacity
to
generate
programme
capable
of
attract
Horizon
2020
funding
from
the
European
Union
.
in
my
role
as
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
I
be
keen
for
Ireland
to
aggressively
target
Horizon
2020
funding
and
the
extend
Science
Foundation
Ireland
legislation
will
support
we
effort
to
enhance
we
success
rate
in
this
regard
.
the
promotion
of
the
study
of
stem
science
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
subject
be
also
a
great
interest
of
mine
in
my
complementary
brief
as
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
it
be
essential
that
we
school
student
receive
the
right
stimulus
to
encourage
they
interest
in
this
area
.
they
be
,
after
all
,
the
pipeline
that
will
produce
Ireland
's
engineer
,
mathematician
and
scientist
of
the
future
.
therefore
,
the
outreach
and
awareness
work
undertake
by

in
this
area
be
of
the
utmost
importance
.
this
be
reflect
in

I
be

will
play
a
significant
role
in
turn
this
good
idea
into
job
.
it
be
worth
note
that

that
Ireland

rank
tenth
out
of

I
be
confident

together
with
both
the

,
will
maintain
research

allocation
in

with

.
in
2014
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
and
Enterprise
Ireland
will
continue
to
leverage
EU
and
private
sector
funding
for
research
programme
,
build
on
the
success
to
date
.
in
2012
,
Irish
researcher
across
the
country
both
in
industry
and
in
the
public
research
system
leverage
over
€
100
million
in
funding
from
the
EU
's

funding
programme
,
the
Seventh

up
from

.
to
date
in

,
over
€
86.5
million
have
be
leverage
from
this
funding
source
.
in
the
come
year
,
there
will
be
a
roll
-
out
of
the
European

's
next
research
and
development
funding
programme
,
Horizon
2020
,
which
be
negotiate
during
the
Irish
Presidency
,
and
I
have
the
privilege
of
chair
that
negotiation
.
with
a
total
budget
of
over
€
70
billion
to
2020
,
we
national
research
and
development
community
be
well
place
to
win
significant
funding
from
Horizon
2020
,
in
the
order
of
€
1
billion
over
the
period
to
2020
,
along
with
funding
from
other
non-Exchequer
source
.
significant
improvement
be
make
to
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
in
budget
2014
,
along
with
a
statement
of
intent
that
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
base
year
will
be
phase
out
entirely
over
time
as
resource
allow
in
order
to
improve
the
overall
international
competitiveness
of
the
regime
.
this
improvement
,
which
include
a
increase
in
the
amount
of
expenditure
allow
on
a
full
-
volume
basis
-
without
reference
to
the
base
year
-
from
€
200000
to
€
300000
and
a
increase
in
the
outsource
limit
from
10
%
to
15
%
,
will
increase
Ireland
's
attractiveness
as
a
location
for
research
and
development
activity
and
result
in
additional
job
in
2014
.
the
evidence
indicate
that
the
government
's
strategy
of
accelerate
the
economic
and
societal
return
from
we
science

pay
off

this
prove
that
we
be
invest
smartly
in
this
area
and
that
we

the
government
's
action
plan
for
job
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
18
job
be
still
be
retain
and
it
be
survive
as
a
entity
.
one
hope
that
it
will
grow
over
time
and
that
the
lose
job
could
be
claw
back
.
I
also
note
the
point
that
the
deputy
make
on
the
other
technology
centre
that
be
available
.
if
the
deputy
contact
the
local
agency
and
Department
official
about
that
site
,
I
be
sure
there
will
be
a
positive
engagement
on
they
potential
in
that
region
.
I
acknowledge
fully
that
this
be
job
loss
.
they
be
go
from
51
employee
down
to
18
,
which
be
a
significant
number
.
I
understand
the
deputy
's
point
on
the
impact
in
a
more
rural
setting
than
in
a
large
urban
conurbation
.
if
we
be
to
have
any
meaningful
role
on
renew
the
manufacturing
industry
in
this
country
,
then
it
must
be
on
the
basis
of
balance
regional
development
.
however
,
when
company
decide
to
go
to
a
particular
region
,
it
be
ultimately
a
company
decision
.
we
all
acknowledge
in
this
house
that
a
corporate
decision
have
be
make
and
we
can
only
set
out
what
be
available
on
the
ground
for
this
company
,
but
they
be
the
ultimate
decider
of
where
they
locate
.
however
,
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.

they
refer
.
Young
people
have
be
the
group
most
seriously
affect
by
the
collapse
of
employment
follow
Ireland
's
economic
crash
.
however
,
youth
employment
have
stabilise
in
the
past
year
and
appear
set
to
start
grow
as
the
economic
recovery
continue
.
Recent
labour
market
figure
publish
by
the
CSO
indicate
that
the
number
of
young
people
under
25
year
of
age
in
employment
increase
by
3200
in
the
year
to
quarter
three
2013
.
the
number
of
young
people
who
be
unemployed
fall
by
13600
in
the
past
12
month
.
the
government
be
work
to
tackle
the
issue
of
youth
opportunity
in
the
labour
market
through
the
combine
effort
of
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
and
pathway
to
work
strategy
.
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
have
seek
to
bring
about
a
transition
in
the
job
and
enterprise
sector
to
develop
new
job
opportunity
in
sustainable
sector
and
to
create
100000
job
by
2016
.
this
work
will
continue
vigorously
in
the
come
year
.
however
,
it
be
encouraging
to
see
record
growth
of
job
in
we
export
sector
and
sign
of
progress
across
a
range
of
sector
.
it
will
be
vital
to
sustain
this
growth
in
employment
in
order
to
deliver
job
opportunity
to
young
entrant
.
through
pathway
to
work
,
the
government
have
bring
in
a
range
of
new
initiative
to
support
young
people
look
for
employment
such
as
JobsPlus
,
JobBridge
,
Springboard
,
Momentum
,
and
the
ICT
action
plan
,
which
be
deliver
by
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
the
government
be
take
step
to
increase
the
number
of
place
and
make
other
enhancement
to
that
scheme
where
possible
.
for
example
,
JobBridge
have
increase
from
5000
place
initially
to
8500
place
be
currently
available
.
the
JobsPlus
initiative
,
which
be
currently
available
to
that
who
be
unemployed
for
12
month
or
more
,
be
be
extend
from
1
January
next
to
that
under
the
age
of
26
who
have
be
unemployed
for
six
month
or
more
.
my
Department
,
together
with
Enterprise
Ireland
,
be
also
examine
option
for
CEB
-
lead
initiative
aim
at
promote
youth
entrepreneurship
,
include
a
mix
of
financial
support
for
business
start
-
up
,
feasibility
study
and
mentoring
.
it
be
also
work
with
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
to
develop
the
Youth
Guarantee
,
in
line
with
the
agreement
reach
under
the
Irish
Presidency
early
this
year
.
the
youth
guarantee
be
negotiate
under
the
Irish
Presidency
.
a
sum
of
€
3
billion
will
be
provide
by
the
European
social
Fund
and
a
new
budget
line
of
€
3
billion
will
also
be
provide
.
we
will
submit
we
plan
to
the
EU
by
the
end
of
2013
.
a
interdepartmental
group
have
be
set
up
in
this
regard
comprise
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
Education
and
Skill
,
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
Children
and
Youth
affair
,
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
the
Taoiseach
and
we
Department
,
and
they
be
all
work
on
the
plan
.
it
be
important
,
though
,
to
acknowledge
1600
job
a
week
be
be
lose
in
the
three
year
before
we
take
office
but
now
the
economy
be
create
1200
job
per
week
.
that
job
be
be
take
up
by
young
people
as
well
.
there
have
be
a
positive
change
in
employment
over
the
past
12
month
.
a
total
of
19500
young
people
have
leave
the
live
register
to
take
up
work
in
the
past
12
month
.
we
have
have
four
consecutive
quarter
of
job
creation
.
JobBridge
be
not
the
panacea
for
the
teaching
profession
,
but
the
evidence
be
that
we
be
create
more
teaching
job
through
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
by
virtue
of
demographic
change
with
a
increase
in
the
birth
rate
,
and
the
deputy
will
acknowledge
that
many
project
be
under
way
to
reflect
that
in
we
own
county
of
Cork
.
JobBridge
be
a
labour
activation
measure
,
which
be
have
a
positive
effect
on
get
people
into
work
.
approximately
500
job
match
have
be
take
up
as
a
result
of
the
JobsPlus
scheme
.
MOMENTUM
comprise
a
€
20
million
package
offer
6500
training
place
through
36
education
provider
in
87
location
.
we
be
conduct
a
review
of
apprenticeship
because
if
one
look
at
where
job
be
lose
,
young
people
be
last
in
,
first
out
.
we
need
to
examine
,
in
particular
,
how
we
can
upskill
that
who
lose
job
in
the
construction
industry
,
and
that
be
why
have
introduce
Springboard
,
the
start
you
own
business
initiative
,
and
the
home
renovation
scheme
,
which
will
have
a
positive
knock
-
on
effect
in
get
young
people
back
into
the
workplace
.
there
be
a
vigorous
and
robust
response
to
this
issue
,
but
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
about
the
youth
guarantee
.
the
plan
be
be
formulate
and
we
can
discuss
that
when
it
come
to
fruition
.

the

be
not

I
understand
from

the

and
the
option
for
the
building
in
its

however
,
it

that
come
in
and
conduct
site
visit
which
make
the
final
decision
as
to
where
they
will
locate
they

.
perhaps
we
could
explore
further
the
dynamic
that
exist
in

to
the

of

I
refer
the

to
my
early
reply
of
6th
November
,
in
which
I
set
out
the
wide
context
to
the
conduct
of
this
case
.
I
thank
deputy
Harris
for
raise
this
issue
.
he
speak
about
certain
report
and
intervention
make
by
people
whom
he
name
within
the
community
.
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
view
within
the
Department
that
all
be
rosy
.
as
minister
with
a
particular
responsibility
for
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
stem
,
education
,
I
can
tell
the
deputy
that
the
three
minister
within
the
Department
-
Deputy
Quinn
and
Cannon
and
myself
-
be
very
much
of
the
view
that
the
pipeline
of
skill
that
be
so
vital
for
this
economy
and
society
must
start
through
a
system
of
policy
intervention
.
I
want
to
tell
the
deputy
about
some
of
that
intervention
.
on
Monday
of
this
week
the
public
consultation
phase
of
the
development
of
a
new
digital
strategy
for
school
be
launch
.
the
potential
for
use
technology
in
the
classroom
be
huge
and
we
be
utterly
aware
of
that
potential
,
but
we
have
to
examine
what
be
the
actual
benefit
we
expect
from
use
technology
in
school
,
how
we
measure
progress
and
how
we
can
further
emb
ICT
seamlessly
across
all
curricula
.
the
forthcoming
reform
of
the
junior
cycle
will
allow
for
the
optional
introduction
of
school
-
develop
short
course
of
100
hour
's
duration
.
this
will
provide
further
opportunity
for
school
to
progress
the
provision
of
course
in
ICT
.
to
address
the
intervention
make
by
James
Whelton
to
which
the
deputy
refer
,
a
short
course
on
programming
and
coding
,
and
also
in
digital
media
and
literacy
,
will
be
available
to
school
for
they
junior
cycle
programme
from
September
2014
.
the
National
Council
for
Curriculum
and
Assessment
,
NCCA
,
be
currently
consult
on
the
content
of
this
short
course
.
we
must
remember
that
it
be
important
that
the
content
be
relevant
.
we
be
invite
submission
on
that
up
to
20
December
of
this
year
.
the
focus
in
school
be
on
use
ICT
as
a
tool
in
learning
.
this
be
support
also
by
a
professional
development
programme
for
teacher
and
by
investment
in
ICT
infrastructure
.
such
infrastructure
be
vital
.
by
the
end
of
2014
all
second
-
level
school
will
be
connect
to
a
100
mbp
broadband
service
at
a
cost
of
€
40
million
.
that
will
feed
very
much
into
this
agenda
as
well
.
the
NCCA
have
develop
a
key
skill
framework
at
senior
cycle
in
which
each
skill
be
break
down
into
essential
element
and
learning
outcome
.
several
of
the
element
encourage
the
effective
use
of
ICT
for
manage
and
present
information
.
as
only
59
second
remain
in
this
time
slot
and
what
I
wish
to
say
be
not
cover
in
my
reply
,
I
want
to
tell
the
deputy
about
the
STEM
education
advisory
group
,
which
comprise
academic
,
industry
partner
and
expert
in
the
field
of
education
,
include
,
for
example
,
a
representative
from
the
NCCA
.
that
advisory
group
be
set
up
by
myself
and
it
be
chair
independently
.
it
be
a
independent
review
group
that
will
examine
all
aspect
of
stem
education
in
Ireland
and
industrial
need
.
it
be
easy
for
constituent
group
to
make
statement
about
how
this
affect
they
realm
,
but
until
we
map
out
the
entirety
of
stem
education
provision
in
the
country
there
be
no
point
in
formulate
a
national
policy
.
individual
initiative
be
take
place
that
be
worthy
.
NCCA
-
related
initiative
sponsor
by
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
be
take
place
,
but
if
we
be
to
truly
understand
the
dynamic
at
play
here
,
it
be
vital
that
we
ensure
we
can
map
the
entirety
of
the
activity
.
that
be
the
reason
we
bring
in
people
from
company
such
as
Intel
who
form
part
of
the
membership
of
the
STEM
education
advisory
group
,
and
it
be
through
they
intervention
that
we
will
be
able
to
map
out
that
activity
and
inform
the
policy
provision
that
need
to
be
make
thereafter
.
we
can
not
be
complacent
about
this
agenda
.
we
be
very
cognisant
of
the
fit
report
and
of
future
skill
need
,
around
which
there
be
no
complacency
.
that
be
the
reason
the
Department
have
programme
such
as
Momentum
,
which
seek
to
bridge
that
gap
.
there
be
a
short
-
term
view
but
,
as
minister
,
I
have
a
tendency
towards
the
long
-
term
view
.
that
be
why
I
have
a
internal
meeting
this
morning
on
the
area
of
STEM
education
provision
at
primary
level
.
it
be
at
primary
level
that
we
have
to
create
the
most
impact
in
term
of
CPD
,
the
knowledge
of
teacher
and
ensure
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
involve
,
include
industry
,
be
cognisant
of
the
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
throughput
and
a
seamless
continuum
between
primary
and
post
-
primary
and
on
to
tertiary
level
.
I
believe
strongly
that
it
be
at
primary
level
that
we
emb
a
conceptual
understanding
of
stem
education
,
and
that
involve
ICT
provision
.
I
agree
with
the
point
make
by
deputy
Simon
Harris
.
we
must
ask
whether
we
should
teach
ICT
as
a
specific
course
or
assist
teacher
in
improve
teaching
and
learning
across
the
curriculum
through
the
use
of
ICT
.
there
be
a
distinction
to
be
make
.
it
be
a
cliché
but
child
be
digital
native
.
there
be
a
gap
in
some
area
of
the
education
system
in
term
of
the
dynamic
through
which
kid
learn
in
the
classroom
and
how
they
embrace
technology
outside
the
classroom
.
my
focus
be
on
content
knowledge
around
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
STEM
.
we
must
use
ICT
as
a
mechanism
to
deliver
a
great
conceptual
understanding
of
stem
.
that
be
the
challenge
for
we
time
.
Mr.
James
Whelton
be
someone
who
influence
people
and
be
a
thought
leader
in
respect
of
coding
and
teaching
teacher
to
code
.
we
will
implement
this
in
the
junior
cycle
and
we
will
see
where
we
go
from
there
.
there
be
a
mathematics
pilot
project
in
the
west
of
Ireland
,
champion
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Ciarán
Cannon
.
through
embrace
course
and
pilot
project
,
we
will
see
how
to
translate
they
across
the
system
to
create
a
long
-
term
beneficial
impact
.
curriculum

in
2003

the

major
impact
on

in
2013
in
respect
of
the

Assessment
,

,
result
.
it
be
too
early
to
map
project
math
onto
2013
PISA
result
but
the
next
set
of
PISA
result
will
map
the
effect
of
project
math
and
will
have
a
positive
effect
.
I
agree
with
the
sentiment
express
by
the
deputy
in
respect
of
Project
Maths
and
that
be
why
we
have
take
a
partnership
approach
.
the
deputy
mention
at
the
outset
that
industry
player
be
inform
we
of
the
skill
shortage
in
respect
of
they
need
.
we
be
try
to
meet
it
and
there
be
a
challenge
in
the
short
term
but
we
be
also
think
in
the
long
term
.
this
be
about
sustainable
job
in
the
ICT
sector
in
the
medium
to
long
term
.
community
throughout
the
country
which
be
gather
to
try
to
take
on
the
might
of
EirGrid
be
face
with
a
state
organisation
fund
by
they
tax
and
international
money
which
can
employ
the
good
consultant
available
.
this
have
ensure
the
good
engineering
,
planning
and
public
relation
consultant
in
the
country
be
work
to
the
Grid25
agenda
.
when
they
try
to
find
people
to
make
a
case
for
they
they
be
scramble
to
fundraise
to
pay
fee
and
they
find
the
selection
available
be
not
what
it
could
be
if
EirGrid
be
not
in
the
market
.
we
be
ask
David
to
take
on
Goliath
and
David
want
to
know
that
he
argument
will
be
assess
in
a
independent
way
.
that
be
why
we
believe
a
independent
analysis
should
be
carry
out
in
respect
of
the
various
factor
involve
,
and
this
analysis
should
include
input
from
all
stakeholder
.
on
this
occasion
,
the
stakeholder
must
be
the
community
that
will
be
affect
by
the
plan
rather
than
just
the
usual
suspect
.
person
who
may
be
affect
should
not
only
come
to
realise
that
fact
after
the
event
.
they
should
not
wake
up
with
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
EirGrid
three
or
four
year
into
the
project
state
that
they
home
be
on
a
prefer
route
.
it
should
not
be
the
case
that
publish
route
can
be
change
and
that
more
house
can
be
affect
as
a
result
.
that
who
be
inform
last
March
that
they
would
not
be
affect
by
the
Grid
West
project
awoke
one
Monday
morning
in
October
to
discover
that
they
house
be
now
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
prefer
corridor
.
when
they
seek
reason
,
they
be
give
different
answer
.
during
this
debate
and
at
meeting
of
the
joint
committee
,
government
deputy
have
express
concern
about
both
the
consultation
process
and
EirGrid
's
ability
or
willingness
to
manage
the
information
flow
from
it
to
the
community
involve
and
to
deal
with
the
concern
of
that
community
.
that
deputy
be
now
go
to
vote
confidence
in
that
consultation
process
and
in
a
organisation
which
have
not
do
well
to
date
in
the
context
of
deal
with
that
process
or
disseminate
information
to
the
community
to
which
I
refer
.
it
have
never
be
we
intention
to
have
the
project
suspend
.
what
we
be
seek
be
a
independent
analysis
of
the
various
aspect
relate
to
it
.
to
paraphrase
the
Taoiseach
,
Paddy
should
be
give
the
clear
information
he
require
.
if
that
happen
,
matter
might
progress
and
people
might
begin
to
have
confidence
.
none
of
the
community
affect
by
the
project
have
confidence
in
either
EirGrid
or
its
ability
to
respect
they
concern
or
to
take
account
of
this
in
the
final
plan
relate
to
Grid25
.
the
feeling
among
many
in
the
community
in
question
be
that
EirGrid
be
go
to
proceed
to
use
the
power
already
at
its
disposal
-
and
perhaps
additional
one
it
might
be
grant
next
year
-
to
ram
the
project
through
,
despite
the
concern
be
express
.
this
Oireachtas
have
a
responsibility
to
provide
reassurance
to
the
community
involve
on
economic
,
health
and
other
grounds
.
we
must
ensure
that
they
be
not
blind
by
spin
and
that
they
do
not
roll
over
in
front
of
the
EirGrid
juggernaut
.
with
its
motion
,
Fianna
Fáil
have
present
the
House
with
the
opportunity
to
do
just
that
.
we
all
believe
in
the
need
to
upgrade
the
grid
.
however
,
this
cannot
be
do
at
a
cost
to
community
and
at
the
expense
of
community
solidarity
.
another
nasty
aspect
of
the
project
be
that
community
which
be
unite
and
whose
member
be
work
well
together
be
be
split
down
the
middle
.
EirGrid
be
hand
out
money
to
landowner
in
order
to
try
to
ensure
this
matter
will
be
do
and
deal
with
in
the
near
future
.
EirGrid
will
eventually
move
on
but
the
legacy
relate
to
how
this
project
be
be
implement
will
be
one
of
bitterness
and
division
in
community
which
,
to
date
,
have
be
exemplar
of
the
concept
of
meitheal
and
of
work
together
.
the
Oireachtas
be
be
give
the
opportunity
to
state
that
it
want
a
different
perspective
and
that
a
independent
review
should
be
carry
out
.
we
extend
to
government
deputy
a
invitation
to
join
we
in

that
which
we
seek

affect
should
not
only
come
to
realise
that
fact
after
the
event
.
they
should
not
wake
up
with
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
EirGrid
three
or
four
year
into
the
project
state
that
they
home
be
on
a
prefer
route
.
it
should
not
be
the
case
that
publish
route
can
be
change
and
that
more
house
can
be
affect
as
a
result
.
that
who
be
inform
last
March
that
they
would
not
be
affect
by
the
Grid
West
project
awoke
one
Monday
morning
in
October
to
discover
that
they
house
be
now
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
prefer
corridor
.
when
they
seek
reason
,
they
be
give
different
answer
.
during
this
debate
and
at
meeting
of
the
joint
committee
,
government
deputy
have
express
concern
about
both
the
consultation
process
and
EirGrid
's
ability
or
willingness
to
manage
the
information
flow
from
it
to
the
community
involve
and
to
deal
with
the
concern
of
that
community
.
that
deputy
be
now
go
to
vote
confidence
in
that
consultation
process
and
in
a
organisation
which
have
not
do
well
to
date
in
the
context
of
deal
with
that
process
or
disseminate
information
to
the
community
to
which
I
refer
.
it
have
never
be
we
intention
to
have
the
project
suspend
.
what
we
be
seek
be
a
independent
analysis
of
the
various
aspect
relate
to
it
.
to
paraphrase
the
Taoiseach
,
Paddy
should
be
give
the
clear
information
he
require
.
if
that
happen
,
matter
might
progress
and
people
might
begin
to
have
confidence
.
none
of
the
community
affect
by
the
project
have
confidence
in
either
EirGrid
or
its
ability
to
respect
they
concern
or
to
take
account
of
this
in
the
final
plan
relate
to
Grid25
.
the
feeling
among
many
in
the
community
in
question
be
that
EirGrid
be
go
to
proceed
to
use
the
power
already
at
its
disposal
-
and
perhaps
additional
one
it
might
be
grant
next
year
-
to
ram
the
project
through
,
despite
the
concern
be
express
.
this
Oireachtas
have
a
responsibility
to
provide
reassurance
to
the
community
involve
on
economic
,
health
and
other
grounds
.
we
must
ensure
that
they
be
not
blind
by
spin
and
that
they
do
not
roll
over
in
front
of
the
EirGrid
juggernaut
.
with
its
motion
,
Fianna
Fáil
have
present
the
House
with
the
opportunity
to
do
just
that
.
we
all
believe
in
the
need
to
upgrade
the
grid
.
however
,
this
cannot
be
do
at
a
cost
to
community
and
at
the
expense
of
community
solidarity
.
another
nasty
aspect
of
the
project
be
that
community
which
be
unite
and
whose
member
be
work
well
together
be
be
split
down
the
middle
.
EirGrid
be
hand
out
money
to
landowner
in
order
to
try
to
ensure
this
matter
will
be
do
and
deal
with
in
the
near
future
.
EirGrid
will
eventually
move
on
but
the
legacy
relate
to
how
this
project
be
be
implement
will
be
one
of
bitterness
and
division
in
community
which
,
to
date
,
have
be
exemplar
of
the
concept
of
meitheal
and
of
work
together
.
the
Oireachtas
be
be
give
the
opportunity
to
state
that
it
want
a
different
perspective
and
that
a
independent
review
should
be
carry
out
.
we
extend
to
government
deputy
a
invitation
to
join
we
in
obtain
that
which
we
seek
.
I
be
respond
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
who
be
out
of
the
country
on
government
business
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
raise
this
issue
and
share
they
concern
about
the
570
job
lose
at
the
Merck
Sharp
and
Dohme
,
MSD
,
site
at
Swords
and
the
150
job
lose
at
the
Pfizer
site
in
Newbridge
,
County
Kildare
.
I
express
my
sympathy
on
the
loss
of
the
job
and
the
impact
on
individual
and
they
family
.
Pfizer
,
like
so
many
company
compete
internationally
,
undertake
a
review
of
its
operation
with
a
view
to
reduce
cost
to
ensure
the
future
viability
of
the
plant
.
this
have
result
in
150
job
loss
in
Newbridge
.
the
global
pharmaceutical
industry
be
experience
a
number
of
challenge
owe
to
patent
expiry
and
over
-
capacity
within
manufacturing
and
,
in
this
context
,
Pfizer
be
no
exception
.
Great
efficiency
and
competitiveness
be
continually
be
seek
across
all
Pfizer
site
in
order
to
compete
on
the
change
landscape
.
Pfizer
be
a
lead
pharmaceutical
employer
,
with
3200
employee
across
seven
operation
in
Ireland
.
the
company
's
capital
investment
in
Ireland
since
its
inception
exceed
$
7
billion
.
Pfizer
have
a
key
manufacturing
presence
here
in
active
pharmaceutical
ingredient
,
solid
dose

and
biopharmaceutal

it
also
have

the
Irish
operation
manufacture
some
of
its
well
-
sell
medicine
for
arthritis
,
infectious
disease
,
high
cholesterol
and
cancer
.
Pfizer
have
indicate
that
its
other
operation
in
Ireland
will
not
be
affect
by
the
decision
.
in
the
past
two
year
the
company
have
make
two
significant
investment
in
Ireland
,
most
recently
of
€
130
million
in
the
Clondalkin
and
Ringaskiddy
site
.
over
600
staff
will
still
be
employ
in
Newbridge
.
IDA
Ireland
be
work
closely
with
the
company
to
ensure
the
good
result
for
the
site
.
with
regard
to
the
MSD
site
at
Swords
,
the
company
be
a
value
pharmaceutical
investor
in
Ireland
.
while
it
announce
some
time
ago
the
closure
of
the
Rathdrum
plant
by
2015
-
there
be
now
this
news
about
the
site
at
Swords
-
it
continue
to
employ
over
1100
staff
in
its
other
facility
in
Ireland
,
locate
in
Carlow
,
Cork
,
Tipperary
and
Leopardstown
in
Dublin
.
significant
investment
have
be
make
in
this
plant
.
unfortunately
,
the
company
have
have
to
undertake
a
review
of
its
worldwide
manufacturing
capability
to
improve
overall
operational
effectiveness
.
follow
the
merger
of
msd
with
Schering
Plough
,
the
combine
operation
have
excess
manufacturing
capacity
worldwide
.
accordingly
,
the
company
decide
to
close
the
Swords
operation
by
2017
and
transfer
production
to
other
factory
in
the
group
locate
in
country
abroad
.
the
gradual
shutdown
of
the
plant
give
a
valuable
space
to
seek
a
new
operation
for
the
factory
.
it
be
not
anticipate
that
any
staff
will
have
to
leave
before
mid-2014
at
the
early
and
that
130
job
will
be
lose
in
the
second
half
of
2014
.
the
remain
position
will
be
phase
out
in
the
follow
three
year
up
to
the
end
of
2017
.
the
ultimate
decision
in
both
case
be
make
by
the
parent
company
on
strictly
commercial
grounds
and
what
be
see
by
the
company
as
be
in
the
good
interest
of
the
group
as
a
whole
.
we
keep
in
close
contact
with
key
foreign
company
about
they
operation
in
Ireland
.
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
meet
senior
US
-
base
management
in
MSD
last
month
.
the
government
have
strategy
for
job
creation
that
be
now
start
to
bear
fruit
.
unemployment
level
have
start
to
reduce
and
we
have
have
a
number
of
good
win
for
the
country
in
recent
month
.
while
it
be
of
little
immediate
consolation
to
the
employee
of
Pfizer
and
MSD
,
the
macroeconomic
indicator
show
job
growth
.
in
term
of
foreign
direct
investment
,
Ireland
continue
to
be
attractive
because
of
we
corporation
tax
and
research
and
development
tax
rate
.
over
1000
multinational
corporation
have
choose
Ireland
and
they
employ
146000
people
directly
.
I
cannot
answer
the
question
about
whether
specific
meeting
have
be
hold
.
perhaps
we
might
revert
to
the
Deputy
on
that
point
.
I
do
not
have
the
information
seek
in
deputy
Willie
O'Dea
's
first
question
,
but
we
can
find
it
for
he
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
this
be
a
vital
sector
in
Ireland
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
if
some
of
the
entity
be
face
the
patent
cliff
or
be
cost
centre
or
profit
centre
,
decision
be
take
at
corporate
and
headquarters
level
and
that
they
have
implication
for
site
such
as
that
in
Swords
and
Newbridge
.
this
be
private
entity
and
we
be
at
the
mercy
of
decision
take
at
corporate
level
.
that
do
not
mean
,
however
,
that
we
be
not
try
to
anticipate
global
trend
in
the
pharma
sector
.
in
the
constituency
of
deputy
Willie
O'Dea
we
announce
the
establishment
of
the
SSPC
research
cluster
.
it
bring
the
pharmaceutical
industry
together
to
look
at
future
trend
.
while
the
State
may
be
move
away
from
investment
in
research
and
drug
discovery
,
not
that
we
be
take
the
eye
off
the
ball
,
and
move
strategically
towards
manufacturing
from
the
molecule
to
medicine
,
this
investment
,
in
which
we
partner
the
industry
,
will
ensure
the
sustainability
of
the
industry
in
this
country
.
the
industry
have
be
locate
here
for
a
long
time
,
part
of
the
reason
for
which
be
the
current
corporation
tax
rate
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
debate
about
trend
in
the
sector
,
such
company
be
locate
here
because
of
the
corporation
tax
rate
,
the
availability
of
human
capital
,
access
to
research
and
development
tax
rate
and
research
facility
such
as
the
Niberg
facility
which
open
over
a
year
ago
.
it
be
a
bioprocessing
facility
.
it
be
important
to
put
this
on
the
record
of
the
House
,
because
quite
a
number
of
question
have
be
ask
of
I
.
I
thank
the

it
be
a
case
of
kick

,
so
to

,
before

.
the

Bill
will
give
statutory

overall
,
in

,
we
have
set
a
target
for

target
be
not
set

opportunity
.
however
,
I
intend
place
a
particular
focus
on
manufacturing
in
2014
.
the
sector
have
lose
50000
job
in
the
year
up
to
2010
.
it
have
see
a
modest
return
to
growth
in
employment
over
the
past
few
year
,
with
a
additional
8,000
job
have
be
create
in
the
past
year
alone
.
there
be
now
213600
directly
employ
in
the

in
Ireland
and
when
account
be
take
of
indirect

,
it
now
support
more
than
427000

the
Forfás

for
the

,
identify
that
a

arise
from
the

and
the

,
there
be
now
a
range
of
initiative
in

by
the

,
address
perception

choice
and
remove
barrier
to

.
as
the
deputy
will
realise
,
innovation
be
a
key
characteristic
of
grow
company
in
both
the
manufacturing
and
service
sector
,
but
it
be
not
possible
to
disaggregate
the
contribution
make
by

towards

job
creation
in
that
sector
.
Enterprise

in

will
lead
to

deputy
Calleary
also
raise
the
issue
of
Carrisbrook
House
.
upon
the
re-organisation
of
the
enterprise
development
agency
in
1994
,
Forfás
acquire
responsibility
for
the
leasehold
interest
,
maintenance
and
repair
of
the
former
IDA
headquarters
,
Carrisbrook
House
.
Forfás

the
building
until
July
2013
,
when
responsibility

the
management
of
the
lease
and
property

to
IDA
Ireland
as
part
of
progress
the
integration
of
Forfás
with
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
Carrisbrook
house
be
originally
acquire
by
AnCO
in
1969
on
a
65
-
year
full
repairing
lease
.
it
be
one
of
the
Dublin
office
occupy
by
the
former
IDA
up
to
1985
when
the
IDA
centralise
in
Wilton
Park
House
.
since
then
,
Carrisbrook
House
have
be
sublet
to
a
number
of
tenant
and
be
fully
sublet
by
Forfás
to
the
middle
of
2008
.
approximately
15
%
of
the
building
be
sublet
to
a
embassy
and
the
remainder
of
the
building
be
unoccupied
,
but
be
be
actively
market
to
potential
new
tenant
.
however
,
the
vacating
of
the
space
in
question
coincide
with
the
economic
downturn
.
every
effort
have
be
make
by
Forfás
to
seek
replacement
tenant
or
to
dispose
of
the
leasehold
interest
.
work
with
professional
estate
agent
,
a
number
of
marketing
initiative
be
undertake
since
2008
.
Forfás
have
also
work
with
IDA
Ireland
in
market
the
property
for
potential
tenant
.
in
2011
and
2012
,
Forfás
step
up
direct
marketing
and
during
this
time
there
be
12
viewing
of
the
building
.
in
the
context
of
difficult
market
condition
,
and
despite
a
number
of
engagement
with
potential
tenant
,
a
let
have
not
be
secure
.
the
IDA
have
now
assume
responsibility
for
all
property
formerly
manage
by
Forfás
and
will
continue
the
effort
to
secure
tenant
for
Carrisbrook
House
.
the
cost
of
the
vacant
space
in
Carrisbrook
House
be
approximately
€
1.2
million
for
2012
.
it
be
hope
that
as
the
economy
continue
to
recover
and
as
demand
for
commercial
premise
continue
to
rise
,
in
particular
in
Dublin
,
IDA
Ireland
will
be
successful
in
fill
the
vacant
office
space
in
Carrisbrook
House
.
deputy
Calleary
also
ask
this
morning
about
the
Advisory
Council
on
Science
,
Technology
and
Innovation
,
which
be
support
by
Forfás
staff
.
the
current
membership
of
the
advisory
council
be
stand
down
with
effect
from
25
September
2013
,
pend
the
finalisation
of
the
Forfás
integration
process
and
overall
policy
on
public
service
reform
.
this
do
not
rule
out
the
option
of
establish
a
advisory
council
of
a
similar
nature
on
a
alternative
footing
if
this
be
deem
appropriate
at
some
stage
in
the
future
.
there
have
be
many
development
in
the
research
and
technology
agenda
over
the
past
two
year
.
the
report
of
the
research
prioritisation
group
be
publish
.
we
have
14
priority
area
arise
from
that
report
,
give
rise
to
14
action
plan
.
Forfás
play
a
integral
part
in
that
process
.
if
it
be
not
for
Forfás
,
it
would
not
be
as
successful
a
process
,
such
be
the
good
work
it
carry
out
.
the
process
will
form
the
main
pillar
of
we
research
strategy
up
to
2017
.
deputy
might
say
that
I
would
say
that
anyway
,
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
,
but
it
be
very
pertinent
to
my
brief
.
a
deputy
raise
the
issue
of
pension
.
a
substantial
portion
of
the
Forfás
non-pay
budget
for
2014
have
be
subsume
into
the
Department
's
budget
to
reflect
progress
to
date
on
the
integration
project
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
Forfás
also
have
responsibility
for
the
pension
cost
of
retire
staff
of
Forfás
,
IDA
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
,
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
certain
former
agency
,
such
as
a
Bord
Tráchtála
,
the
Institute
for
Industrial
Research
and
Standard
,
the
National
Board
for
Science
and
Technology
and
Eolas
,
under
the
Industrial
Development
Act
1993
to
2003
.
as
legal
employer
of
1150
staff
across
the
development
agency
,
Forfás
centrally
manage
the
pension
scheme
of
Forfás
itself
and
its
precede
organisation
,
the
associate
pension
compliance
obligation
and
related
staff
benefit
and
insurance
scheme
.
I
hope
that
go
towards
answer
the
point
make
about
the
outturn
for
2013
and
2014
in
respect
of
pension
.
there
be
32
staff
and
two
head
of
division
to
be
assign
to
the
strategic
policy
division
.
that
question
be
ask
in
respect
of
staffing
.
deputy
Broughan
make
a
number
of
point
,
one
of
which
be
about
social
enterprise
.
that
be
not
pertinent
to
this
Bill
,
but
there
be
a
interdepartmental
group
on
social
enterprise
which
meet
I
and
the
social
enterprise
task
force
on
a
regular
basis
.
if
there
be
a
issue
with
the
potential
of
social
economy
and
community
enterprise
in
north
Dublin
,
the
deputy
can
contact
I
and
we
can
facilitate
a
further
discussion
on
that
.
deputy
Broughan
also
raise
the
issue
of
the
cost
of
relocate
the
function
.
there
be
no
additional
cost
associate
with
the
transfer
of
function
,
and
deputy
McGrath
raise
this
point
as
well
.
the
Forfás
property
function
have
be
transfer
to
IDA
Ireland
,
along
with
some
share
service
function
.
exist
budget
in
respect
of
this
function
transfer
to
the
IDA
and
there
be
no
proposal
to
increase
this
budget
.
there
may
be
some
cost
associate
with
the
relocation
of
INAB
to
the
hsa
,
but
this
will
be
relatively
small
and
will
be
meet
from
within
exist
budget
.
I
hope
I
have
answer
deputy
O'Brien
's
point
about
independent
and
critical
analysis
.
we
all
agree
that
the
commitment
be
there
.
it
be
important
that
the
independence
be
maintain
and
that
the
body
would
have
that
ability
to
construct
its
own
report
.
there
be
also
issue
about
unemployment
and
youth
unemployment
.
I
do
not
intend
get
into
a
macroeconomic
debate
.
there
be
other
mechanism
for
address
that
political
point
that
be
make
.
point
be
also
make
about
IDA
regional
development
.
Specific
deputy
make
point
about
they
own
constituency
.
IDA
Ireland
and
Enterprise
Ireland
be
revise
they
regional
strategy
which
will
seek
to
overcome
and
address
problem
which
may
be
hamper
regional
development
.
I
know
the
IDA
recently
announce
plan
to
provide
office
and
building
in
a
number
of
regional
location
in
the
come
year
.
it
be
fair
to
say
IDA
Ireland
actively
promote
centre
throughout
the
country
,
but
in
my
experience
,
if
we
look
at
that
company
come
in
now
,
particularly
in
the
technology
sector
,
they
be
often
young
company
bear
on
the
Internet
and
they
seem
to
want
to
cluster
in
area
where
there
be
already
much
activity
,
such
as
Dublin
and
large
urban
conurbation
like
Cork
and
Limerick
.
they
be
not
inclined
to
move
outside
that
large
urban
conurbation
,
so
there
be
no
doubt
that
this
provide
a
challenge
.
very
often
the
client
company
make
the
ultimate
decision
on
where
to
locate
,
follow
site
visit
.
it
be
important
to
recognise
that
as
well
.
there
be
no
doubt
there
be
still
a
regional
disparity
and
a
challenge
in
respect
of
the
growth
in
the
eastern
side
of
the
country
relative
to
other
regional
area
.
that
be
something
we
be
address
through
action
plan
for
Jobs
.
the
implementation
team
task
with
oversee
the
integration
of
Forfás
into
the

have
make
considerable
progress
ahead
of
the

with
the
relevant
agency
the
most
appropriate

we

,
retain
they

and
condition
from
they

therefore
,
there
be
no
diminution
of

in

sense
.
we
will
also
commence

at
the

time
,
which
provide
for

,
that

I
thank

on

I
deliberately
do
not
address
issue
raise
that
be
not
pertinent
to
the

.
deputy
-
I
be
guilty
too
in
this
regard
-
have
a
tendency
to
take
advantage
of

stage
debate
to
introduce
matter
which
be
extraneous
to
the

be
debate
.
while
the

be
technical
in
nature
,
it
be
important
legislation
which
will
give

to
the
decision
to
integrate
the

and

of

in
the

of

Forfás
,
through

will
have
a

play
in
this

I
wish
I
could
address
every
single
point
that
be
raise
in
the
debate
but
in
the
five
minute
I
have
I
will
try
to
stick
to
the
more
salient
and
pertinent
point
.
I
note
deputy
Donnelly
's
Bill
.
deputy
Wallace
have
refer
to
it
as
Stephen
's
Bill
.
that
be
something
that
might
catch
on
in
public
parlance
.
question
have
be
ask
about
the
legal
reason
the
government
have
for
oppose
the
Bill
.
as
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
point
out
last
night
,
there
be
some
feature
of
the
Bill
that
give
rise
to
constitutional
concern
.
one
of
that
be
the
role
of
the
court
.
under
the
current
examinership
process
the
court
be
sit
over
the
process
,
take
into
account
all
the
relevant
interest
of
that
that
will
be
affect
by
the
rescue
and
make
a
independent
assessment
of
the
appropriate
outcome
.
in
deputy
Donnelly
's
Bill
,
the
court
be
less
of
a
feature
in
the
process
,
only
enter
it
at
the
very
end
,
when
time
be
run
out
,
or
at
a
early
stage
only
if
a
appeal
be
make
.
another
issue
of
concern
be
the
way
in
which
creditor
can
pursue
they
interest
.
under
exist
law
,
a
creditor
be
hear
by
the
court
from
the
start
.
that
be
quite
different
from
the
provision
in
the
Bill
where
a
creditor
have
to
mount
a
case
and
meet
a
high
threshold
of
proof
that
,
in
many
case
,
require
a
in
-
depth
knowledge
of
the
company
's
affair
that
would
not
easily
be
within
he
or
she
remit
or
to
borrow
the
colloquial
expression
,
within
he
or
she
ken
.
the
Bill
also
give
new
power
to
examiner
to
alter
the
debt
owe
to
other
.
this
appear
to
be
quite
wide
range
and
may
stray
into
what
be
more
properly
the
preserve
of
the
court
.
when
all
of
the
provision
be
take
together
,
as
they
be
in
the
Bill
,
there
be
a
danger
of
make
a
unjust
and
disproportionate
attack
on
the
property
rights
of
that
who
have
,
in
good
faith
,
supply
goods
and
service
.
examinership
have
be
on
the
Statute
Book
for
nearly
25
year
.
any
proposal
for
alteration
of
that
try
and
test
formula
need
careful
consideration
.
the
House
be
currently
in
the
middle
of
consideration
of
the
company
Bill
2012
with
all
its
reform
and
modernisation
that
be
design
to
simplify
the
establishment
and
management
of
a
company
.
as
some
Deputy
acknowledge
,
only
a
few
week
ago
we
enact
the
company
(
Miscellaneous
provision
)
act
2013
to
make
it
easy
for
small
company
to
have
they
examinership
case
hear
in
the
circuit
Court
.
we
all
share
the
hope
of
that
Deputy
who
mention
it
that
it
will
bring
a
noticeable
improvement
once
it
be
in
operation
,
which
should
be
soon
.
we
acknowledge
that
perhaps
we
could
do
more
.
that
be
why
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
announce
last
night
that
he
be
set
up
a
working
group
to
further
examine
the
remain
recommendation
of
the
Company
Law
Review
Group
in
the
area
of
examinership
to
assess
whether
they
offer
a
viable
and
less
costly
solution
.
the
minister
also
say
that
some
of
the
concern
raise
by
deputy
Donnelly
will
be
examine
in
the
course
of
the
working
group
's
deliberation
.
we
should
thank
deputy
Donnelly
for
the
considerable
time
and
effort
he
have
put
into
the
proposal
.
we
all
acknowledge
he
work
in
that
regard
.
we
regret
that
on
this
occasion
we
cannot
support
the
Bill
but
it
be
the
government
's
firm
intention
to
keep
do
all
it
can
to
support
enterprise
so
that
they
flourish
.
some
point
be
raise
by
deputy
about
the
nature
of
enterprise
support
.
some
of
that
issue
can
be
tease
out
by
a
committee
.
we
challenge
the
number
in
term
of
the
balance
between
foreign
direct
investment
and
support
for
indigenous
industry
but
I
do
not
have
time
to
address
that
concern
tonight
.
I
have
a
tendency
to
switch
off
because
I
have
hear
the
deputy
's
speech
a
million
time
.
the
single
transferable
speech
be
a
bit
tiresome
and
it
do
not
speak
to
the
Bill
.
no
,
it
do
not
.
this
be
boring
.
why
do
the
deputy
not
make
a
submission
to
the
working
group
?

I
propose
to
take

I
welcome
this
debate
and
thank
deputy
Finian
McGrath
for
tab
this
Bill
and
give
we
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
allocation
of
resource
teaching
support
for
pupil
with
special
educational
need
,
include
pupil
with
down
's
syndrome
.
I
be
take
the
Bill
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
apologis
for
he
absence
as
he
be
abroad
on
government
business
today
.
there
be
a
ongoing
court
case
in
the
high
court
on
the
issue
of
resource
teacher
allocation
for
child
with
down
's
syndrome
,
which
obviously
limit
somewhat
the
contribution
I
can
make
to
the
debate
.
the
Bill
propose
to
afford
statutory
recognition
to
down
's
syndrome
as
a
low
incidence
disability
for
resource
teaching
allocation
purpose
,
in
all
instance
,
irrespective
of
a
pupil
's
level
of
general
learning
disability
as
identify
in
a
professional
assessment
.
it
also
propose
to
give
statutory
effect
to
the
provision
of
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
Circular
02/05
which
provide
for
the
level
of
resource
teaching
hour
to
be
allocate
for
all
low
incidence
disability
category
.
I
wish
to
make
clear
that
the
government
do
not
intend
to
oppose
the
Bill
on
second
stage
.
however
,
to
be
very
clear
about
its
approach
,
the
Bill
will
be
refer
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Education
and
social
Protection
where
it
can
be
consider
in
the
context
of
the
forthcoming
proposal
to
establish
a
completely
new
model
for
the
allocation
of
resource
teaching
support
in
mainstream
school
.
rather
than
fix
the
exist
flawed
system
of
resource
allocation
in
primary
legislation
,
the
government
's
prefer
approach
be
to
create
a
with
all
due
respect
,
I
can
not
be
blame
for
that
.
I
be
conscious
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
have
yet
to
speak
again
and
only
six
minute
remain
in
the
slot
.
I
genuinely
thank
all
deputy
for
they
consider
view
in
the
debate
.
the
government
's
non-opposition
to
the
Bill
be
not
a
cynical
ploy
.
we
want
to
state
categorically
we
have
accept
the
advice
of
the
National
Council
for
special
Education
and
there
be
no
question
the
development
of
a
new
model
for
allocate
additional
resource
teaching
support
to
school
must
be
explore
.
the
intention
of
the
new
model
will
be
to
allocate
resource
as
fairly
as
possible
to
that
school
most
in
need
of
this
resource
and
to
provide
great
autonomy
-
I
cannot
emphasise
enough
the
word
"
autonomy
"
-
for
school
in
target
the
resource
to
the
pupil
who
need
they
most
regardless
of
they
disability
,
categorisation
or
diagnosis
and
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
contain
in
the
report
.
it
be
clear
the
report
will
fully
address
the
issue
raise
with
regard
to
pupil
with
down
's
syndrome
and
the
reason
we
be
take
the
approach
we
be
on
the
Bill
be
to
allow
for
it
to
be
refer
to
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Education
and
social
Protection
where
it
can
be
consider
in
the
context
of
the
forthcoming
proposal
to
establish
a
completely
new
model
for
the
allocation
.
I
sincerely
take
the
point
raise
by
deputy
on
the
length
of
time
between
now
and
September
2015
,
when
the
report
will
issue
.
I
certainly
will
take
it
up
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
arise
from
the
intervention
make
by
Deputy
across
the
House
.
all
deputy
be
mindful
of
the
historical
perspective
on
the
challenge
and
the
unconditional
love
one
feel
from
people
in
the
community
.
it
have
be
well
-
articulate
by
deputy
in
certain
testimony
and
we
have
all
encounter
it
from
people
with
down
's
syndrome
.
we
be
genuinely
try
to
deal
with
the
issue
.
I
understand
people
be
absolutely
and
utterly
frustrated
at
this
stage
and
I
be
confident
the
issue
raise
on
the
time
-
lag
will
be
address
by
the
Oireachtas
committee
,
but
I
assure
the
House
I
will
take
they
up
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
.
in
accordance
with
Standing
Order
117A

the

be
the
deputy
be
rhetorical
?
his
colleague
have
reserve
a
position
on
universal
health
insurance
.
be
that
deputy
Shane
Ross
?
he
be
a
big
exponent
of
sell
share
.
there
be
a
little
revisionism
in
the
technical
Group
.
this
morning
on
radio
I
hear
deputy
Joe
Higgins
describe
this
debate
as
narcissistic
.
however
,
I
view
it
as
a
opportunity
to
explain
to
the
House
what
I
be
do
in
the
area
of
research
and
innovation
and
what
endeavour
be
under
way
in
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
.
my
aim
be
as
much
to
inform
the
House
on
ongoing
development
as
to
articulate
-
I
will
not
use
the
word
"
celebrate
"
-
the
achievement
of
the
government
to
date
,
give
that
250000
job
be
destroy
during
the
three
year
prior
to
we
take
office
.
it
be
only
right
and
proper
that
we
should
come
to
the
House
to
give
a
account
to
the
tribune
of
the
people
.
I
would
not
describe
myself
as
a
narcissist
.
this
day
when
I
pass
a
mirror
,
I
tend
to
avoid
look
at
my
reflection
.
my
hair
be
reced
and
turn
somewhat
grey
,
while
my
waistline
be
expand
.
similarly
,
I
think
it
be
unfair
to
describe
the
government
as
narcissistic
.
the
government
recognise
that
we
must
employ
the
good
of
we
research
and
innovation
infrastructure
to
create
job
.
its
strategy
be
to
accelerate
the
economic
and
societal
return
on
we
science
,
technology
and
innovation
investment
,
to
further
strengthen
enterprise
engagement
and
take
-
up
of
public
research
and
to
drive
commercialisation
.
in
other
word
,
we
want
to
turn
good
idea
into
job
.
in
this
way
,
implementation
of
research
prioritisation
which
have
be
under
way
since
March
2012
will
see
the
majority
of
public
research
funding
align
with
14
priority
area
.
this
be
the
area
in
which
we
be
most
likely
to
get
economic
and
societal
return
,
particularly
in
the
form
of
job
,
as
well
as
underpin
platform
area
of
science
and
technology
and
certain
integrate
infrastructure
to
support
the
priority
area
.
instead
of
put
all
of
we
egg
into
the
construction
basket
,
we
be
invest
taxpayer
's
money
smartly
in
area
in
which
we
know
we
will
get
a
return
not
only
for
large
urban
area
but
also
in
regional
development
.
the
report
of
the
research
prioritisation
steering
group
identify
the
14
area
of
opportunity
which
should
receive
the
majority
of
competitive
public
investment
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
in
the
come
five
year
.
the
area
be
identify
on
the
basis
of
exist
strength
of
the
public
research
system
,
strength
of
the
indigenous
and
foreign
direct
investment
enterprise
base
,
opportunity
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
potential
to
deliver
job
.
a
key
goal
in
the
process
of
research
prioritisation
will
be
a
significantly
enhance
focus
on
collaborative
research
with
enterprise
by
grow
the
number
of
researcher
in
enterprise
and
enhance
the
flow
of
researcher
between
academia
and
enterprise
.
the
whole
-
of
-
government
prioritisation
action
group
which
I
chair
be
task
with
implement
research
prioritisation
and
significant
progress
have
be
make
since
its
inaugural
meeting
in
the
spring
of
2012
.
the
group
operate
under
the
broad
authority
of
the
cabinet
committee
on
economic
recovery
and
job
and
meet
on
a
regular
basis
.
the
priority
area
encompass
the
area
of
energy
,
food
,
health
,
ICT
and
innovation
in
business
process
and
service
.
Considerable
activity
have
emerge
from
each
of
this
core
area
not
only
in
Dublin
,
Cork
and
Limerick
but
also
through
the
institute
of
technology
which
have
a
wide
regional
constitution
.
action
plan
have
be
develop
for
each
of
the
priority
area
to
identify
the
action
require
across
research
funding
organisation
.
engagement
with
relevant
stakeholder
on
the
draft
action
plan
take
place
at
the
end
of
2012
and
the
plan
be
approve
by
the
government
in
June
2013
.
many
of
the
action
focus
on
address
specific
need
of
enterprise
in
the
research
community
and
ensure
appropriate
funding
be
put
in
place
to
underpin
this
14
area
.
couple
with
that
,
during
the
Presidency
of
the
Council
of
the
European
Union
which
Ireland
hold
,
I
be
a
party
to
the
negotiation
on
Horizon
2020
,
a
€
80
billion
fund
which
be
one
of
the
most
significant
pillar
of
EU
funding
.
we
have
set
a
target
for
Ireland
to
draw
down
€
1.8
billion
during
the
lifetime
of
that
programme
.
I
chair
some
of
the
negotiation
on
that
pillar
of
funding
.
I
be
proud
to
say
that
the
delivery
of
€
1.25
billion
to
Irish
academic
institution
partner
with
industry
will
allow
we
to
create
the
type
of
job
we
need
to
disrupt
that
flow
of
emigration
so
that
when
graduate
be
come
out
of
the
university
and
institute
of
technology
there
be
potential
pathway
for
they
to
map
onto
the
area
of
opportunity
of
which
I
speak
,
such
as
ICT
,
food
and
medical
device
,
in
a
way
that
allow
for
they
to
gain
the
necessary
accreditation
from
tertiary
up
to
PhD
level
,
but
also
encourage
the
creation
of
the
intellectual
property
and
new
innovation
that
be
so
vital
to
industry
in
a
way
that
create
job
.
we
have
also
,
since
2012
,
put
in
place
a
new
intellectual
property
protocol
.
this
outline
new
structure
to
encourage
more
business
to
commercialise
research
and
development
by
ensure
that
they
can
access
the
result
of
State
-
fund
research
with
great
clarity
and
certainty
.
any
business
that
have
a
idea
can
take
that
idea
to
a
academic
institution
to
see
whether
it
can
innovate
in
a
way
that
create
wealth
,
new
intellectual
property
,
new
licensing
and
,
ultimately
,
job
,
because
this
be
what
it
be
all
about
.
the
prioritisation
action
group
,
PAG
,
be
also
consider
how
application
procedure
for
research
funding
can
be
adjust
to
assess
relevance
to
and
impact
on
the
priority
area
.
we
have
a
core
standard
.
it
be
a
excellent
standard
that
be
monitor
by
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
which
be
lead
the
way
as
the
core
funding
agency
in
this
regard
.
furthermore
,
in
response
to
recommendation
to
align
the
supply
and
demand
of
train
researcher
,
the
Irish
Research
Council
have
roll
out
a
employment
-
base
PhD
and
master
's
degree
programme
in
which
awardee
will
be
employee
,
with
the
majority
of
time
spend
in
-
company
.
rather
than
have
phd
stay
within
academia
-
the
vast
majority
of
they
move
out
into
industry
anyway
-
we
be
,
through
a
structure
PhD
,
encourage
a
increase
number
to
spend
time
in
company
during
the
course
of
they
PhD
work
.
this
be
vital
to
disrupt
the
pattern
,
in
a
positive
sense
,
to
create
more
company
,
spin-out
and
spin-in
to
sustain
the
economy
for
the
future
.
we
have
create
seven

,
which
we
will
fund
over
six
year
.
this
centre

the
key

.
the
High
Education
Authority
have
undertake
a
national
inventory
of
all
significant
publicly

,
and
a
online

in

with
compile
this

the
HEA
have
develop

for

we
be
open
up
the

to
enterprise
and
to
other
institution
so
that
it
be
not
keep
within
silo
and
individual

be
not
proprietorial
about
the
piece
of

they
have
within

.
we
be
try
to
open
up
the
landscape
and
break
down
the
silo
in
a
way
that
allow
for
great
collaboration
,
not
only
in
a
politically
expedient
way
between

,
but
in
a
deep
way
.
it
be
important
that
we
do
so
because
we
be
such
a
small
country
.
the

this
be
a
apolitical
space
.
no
one
political

in
this
House
underpin
what
we
be
do
.
I
would
give
due
credit
to
previous
government
that
lay
the
foundation
for
where
we
be
now
through
the
programme
for
research
in

,
which
allow
we
to
build
out

the

industry
,
government
and
academia
allow
the
creation
of
economy
of
scale
in
a
way
that
allow
we
to
leverage
the
opportunity
of
Horizon
2020
,
the
EU
funding
stream
of
€
80
billion
,
which
be
negotiate
on
the
basis
of
we
study
the
great
societal
challenge
of
we
time
-
aging
,
food
,
health
,
transport
,
smart
grid
,
smart
city
,
etc
.
by
work
in
parallel
with
that
thematic
area
in
Ireland
,
we
will
achieve
great
leverage
opportunity
.
we
believe
that
by
adopt
this
simple
philosophy
we
will
create
a
impact
within
a
three
-
to
five
-
year
period
.
it
be
make
a
investment
for
the
future
.
it
go
beyond
a
typical
five
-
year
government
mandate
.
we
be
try
to
lay
down
a
foundation
for
the
next
phase
of
development
from
the
point
of
view
of
research
and
innovation
.
over
the
next
six
year
,
the
total
investment
will
be
over
€300
million
.
SFI
,
through
its
multi-annual
programme
,
will
provide
€
200
million
and
industry
will
come
up
with
€
100
million
,
in
cash
and
in
-
kind
contribution
.
by
bring
industry
to
partner
with
the
academic
institution
through
the
creation
of
this
centre
,
we
will
create
a
international
impact
.
the
process
be
collaborative
and
,
as
I
have
say
,
it
work
across
all
institution
.
its
purpose
be
also
to
map
out
new
opportunity
with
other
jurisdiction
.
we
be
strongly
of
the
view
that
we
can
collaborate
more
with
Northern
Ireland
and
be
aware
of
the
opportunity
that
will
exist
between
institution
on
both
side
of
the
Border
.
when
we
launch
Horizon
at
national
level
,
we
be
cognisant
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
,
by
partner
with
institution
in
the
North
,
we
could
create
economy
of
scale
that
would
allow
great
leverage
for
funding
opportunity
across
each
of
the
thematic
area
of
which
I
speak
early
.
we
have
156
distinct
company
across
seven
research
centre
.
there
will
be
more
research
centre
to
come
.
we
creation
of
seven
centre
of
a
significant
scale
have
be
a
success
,
but
we
must
carefully
monitor
its
impact
.
we
have
put
in
place
a
set
of
metric
-
clear
indicator
.
if
it
be
taxpayer
's
money
,
we
must
ensure
we
achieve
that
impact
and
be
monitor
the
work
of
each
of
that
seven
centre
.
however
,
the
seven
centre
involve
all
of
the
academic
institution
in
some
way
,
shape
or
form
,
and
as
I
state
,
it
be
base
along
thematic
line
.
in
the
research
centre
,
the
area
on
which
we
be
focus
include
big
datum
,
datum
analytic
and
marine
renewable
energy
.
we
be
look
outwards
,
towards
the
sea
.
person
talk
about
we
be
a
maritime
nation
.
we
be
look
at
the
potential
for
marine
renewable
energy
.
we
be
bring
a
lot
of
industry
partner
into
that
and
a
new
maritime
research
centre
be
be
create
in
Cork
.
we
be
also
look
at
pharmaceutical
manufacturing
-
in
which
there
be
lot
of
activity
throughout
the
country
-
as
well
as
drug
synthesis
,
connect
health
,
neonatal
care
,
photonics
,
and
functional
food
.
we
be
look
not
only
at
the
production
of
core
food
product
but
also
at
the
area
of
gut
health
,
in
which
one
can
add
additional
functionality
to
food
,
for
example
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
deliver
medicine
.
we
be
look
at
the
next
phase
of
food
production
.
we
be
also
look
at
nanotechnology
.
all
of
this
area
be
one
in
which
Ireland
be
a
significant
international
leader
.
we
be
not
start
afresh
on
the
journey
.
this
be
area
of
core
competence
in
which
Ireland
have
a
significant
international
reputation
.
this
allow
we
to
bring
in
industry
that
have
be
long
establish
and
new
company
to
partner
with
we
to
try
to
create
the
necessary
impact
.
this
be
multidisciplinary
research
team
which
cut
across
enterprise
,
education
,
health
,
the
public
sector
,
energy
and
the
environment
.
in
the
job
announcement
in
2013
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
have
link
with
72
%
of
IDA
Ireland
job
announcement
.
the
kernel
of
that
be
that
more
of
the
win
in
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
be
predicate
on
we
strong
research
and
innovation
base
.
it
be
all
about
human
capital
,
not
just
corporation
tax
.
the
investment
create
through
IDA
Ireland
be
also
predicate
on
this
strong
research
and
development
base
.
we
must
continue
to
focus
on
this
and
not
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
.
the
number
of
job
associate
with
the
30

be
1,757

of
which
SFI
have
link
with
1,265

SFI
directly
support
a
cohort
of
approximately
3000

across
Ireland

with
regard
to
the
policy
area
for
which
I
have
responsibility
,
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
,
STEM
,
we
be
very
much
aware
of
the
current
project
math
process
.
we
be
drive
through
the
education
system
a
need
for
great
conceptual
understanding
by
all
student
of
mathematical
and
scientific
concept
.
the
bonus
point
for
mathematics
at
post
-
primary
level
and
project
math
be
have
a
impact
.
there
will
be
challenge
further
down
the
line
.
as
long
as
the
university
and
the
high
education
institute
control
the
CAO
and
CAS
system
,
there
will
be
a
challenge
in
respect
of
inflate
point
where
demand
increase
.
we
be
cognisant
of
this
point
.
we
have
also
set
up
a
STEM
educational
review
group
chair
by
Professor
Brian
McCraith
of
DCU
.
we
be
look
at
introduce
industry
to
partner
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
to
move
beyond
the
disparate
number
of
stem

related
project
happen
throughout
the
country

we
have
many
great
stem
-
related
activity
that
encourage
great
understanding
by
primary
and
post
-
primary
student
in
the
area
of
STEM
,
but
we
want
a
national
co-ordinate
approach
.
if
we
partner
with
industry
in
a
more
co-ordinate
way
,
the
hope
be
industry
will
begin
to
contribute
upfront
cash
to
replicate
it
in
area
that
do
not
have
this
kind
of
activity

the

I

the

,
and
the
technical
specification
define
the
structure
and
the
use
of
the
unique
identifier
for
communication
between

.
I
hope
I
have
cover
they
.
at
the
outset
,
I
do
not
propose
to
support
this
amendment
.
this
series
of
amendment
propose
to
insert
the
word
"
manage
and
control
"
into
section
of
the
Bill
.
when
one
consider
it
,
the
objective
appear
to
be
to
cause
all
company
register
in
Ireland
to
be
tax
resident
in
Ireland
.
one
must
think
carefully
about
this
and
neither
I
nor
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
be
in
a
position
to
consider
the
full
impact
or
consequence
of
any
change
to
tax
law
because
such
a
exercise
,
for
the
purpose
of
this
Bill
,
come
within
the
remit
and
the
function
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
moreover
,
the
propose
amendment
be
illegal
under
both
European
Union
and
international
law
.
the
provision
would
fall
foul
of
the
European
Union
law
on
freedom
of
establishment
,
which
be
a
core
aspect
of
European
Union
law
.
compliance
with
this
be
monitor
closely
by
the
European
Commission
and
Ireland
recently
have
be
require
by
the
commission
to
change
a
provision
of
Irish
law
,
which
require
that
at
least
one
director
of
a
Irish
company
be
resident
in
Ireland
.
this
provision
,
as
propose
,
would
go
much
further
and
effectively
would
require
all
management
activity
to
occur
within
the
State
.
this
clearly
would
be
a
hindrance
to
cross
-
border
trade
within
the
European
Union
and
would
trammel
significantly
the
ability
of
a
company
from
another
European
Union
member
state
to
establish
itself
in
Ireland
.
furthermore
,
the
proposal
would
put
Ireland
in
breach
of
obligation
under
double
taxation
agreement
with
other
country
.
this
be
completely
unprecedented
and
would
be
highly
prejudicial
to
Irish
commerce
and
to
Ireland
's
reputation
internationally
.
consequently
,
for
this
reason
I
will
not
be
accept
this
amendment
.
as
one
government
minister
among
many
,
we
have
spend
considerable
time
over
the
past
three
year
in
travel
abroad
and
encourage
investment
.
I
recently
have
return
from
the
mid-west
of
the
Unite
State
,
where
Ireland
's
reputation
regard
the
potential
for
foreign
direct
investment
be
very
strong
.
a
clear
message
be
come
from
the
Unite
State
of
America
,
to
name
one
country
as
a
example
,
that
there
be
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
company
to
explore
the
option
of
invest
in
a
country
like
Ireland
.
Specific
meeting
have
be
hold
with
specific
target
company
through
IDA
Ireland
,
company
have
be
bring
out
through
Enterprise
Ireland
and
no
one
I
have
meet
have
mention
anything
about
we
reputation
.
the
opposite
be
the
case
and
while
I
would
be
interested
to
see
the
set
of
metric
to
which
the
deputy
have
access
-
if
there
be
reputational
issue
-
when
it
come
to
a
decision
by
a
company
to
invest
in
Ireland
,
base
on
the
company
that
have
be
attract
here
even
over
the
past
24
month
,
it
be
clear
there
be
significant
interest
in
Ireland
in
respect
of
inward
investment
and
create
job
.
I
move
amendment
no.
